ooh i hope you die in the heck &gt;:(
---
shatered glasses... best map in the historty
---
The Game is good for Nurse.
---
I think the confusion came from the fact that they can be purchased for shards on the mobile version.
---
What is that video, is that a thing I missed lmao
---
They tweeted about the issue and they are looking into. Hopefully its resolved by tonight
---
Matchmaking
---
It's my Michael Myers cosplay from April. The image on the left is from a year before.
---
Well, it could've been worse. You could've played Billy or Huntress on that map ...
---
Buddy, the post is talking about how almost every killer is countered by their own maps. Like Huntress is terrible on her own map. Doctor is terrible on his map, but technically so is everyone not named Spirit or Nurse.
---

---
The post is not complaining about how maps are survivor favored. Again, it is pointing out that it is weird how maps counter their respective killer.
---
Better then a mori. Muhahahahahahahahaaaa
---
That swing at the end lmfao
---
I FOUND THAT RESTARTING MY PLAYSTATION HELPED!
---
Well, I don't know what perks do you have, so I can't say.
---
There's a lot of people downvoting you for being correct.

At least he gave that +9000 bonus.

naaa, billy at least is 115% and huntress can still throw hatchets a windows
---
How would that even work. Are you going to flash their ears? 
---
This is possibly the stupidest thing I've read on these forums. Screenshotting so when get stomped in a game I can looked at this post and be reminded that most survivors that play this game are beyond stupid.
---
I did, what happened?
---
Or or hear me out. Dont flashlight at pallets lmao
---
Alright then but why the fuck did you bring a flashlight and healed in front of a baby legion mate ? Thats literals making fun of that baby legion and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than you‚Äù
---
Git good
---
They don't get points for altruism or objective if they only hide the entire game.
---
Hiding....
---
Dont worry it‚Äôs not that good anyway
---
Bc it either a random who joined a swf an they are dying or u had a hex ruin and we‚Äôre actually good with the killer so they didn‚Äôt finish any gens and now 2 of there friends are dead so they try to find the hatch to get the points
---
Us women/girls play all sorts of games. But this game doesn't result in us getting harassed nearly as much.
---
*and a 5 blink nurse just in case*
---
Laurie
---
Camping is a legitimate strategy if
---
* The exit gates are open
---
* You know the other survivors are around from their behavior earlier in the game so they're not getting anything done
---
* You have multiple survivors in the basement (at that point it's kind of their fault for allowing such a situation to happen anyway) 
---
Otherwise when I play survivor I don't even complain about it because I know all the generators will be done and the killer will leave with a 1k or lucky 2k at best.
---
One map has to be the biggest I guess
---
N-nothing
---
Its just that I wanted to sleep in Dwights house for a bit
---
Why in the actual fuck are the cosmetics for Tapp and The Pig double the price of the chapter
---
How do u get so many shards? Those outfits cost like 20k or something
---
Kate brought tenacity
---
Papa D or baby D?
---
I mean isn‚Äôt rank supposed to be your skill level like rank 20 players are worse than rank 1 players and rank 10 is in the middle I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the whole reason for the ranking system (this was before the rank reset happened)
---
Juat use whatever survivor build you already use. Theyre just skins.
---
As a pig main... I can say this is my favorite fanart yet !!!
---
Do you have a version without the üíØ though???
---
Buying cosmetics for a character you bought for a game you purchased, what next?
---
Eh, not really. I just played a game where I was unlucky/bad enough to get hooked first. The survivor who spawned with me came for the save, the other two very slowly made their way toward me while hiding for five to 10 seconds every few feet. Once I was finally unhooked I (unfortunately) got hooked again (yeah, it wasn't a good game for me, not the point). Feng once again came while one of the other survivors literally hid in the basement and the other one hid behind a rock. Totally useless and obviously frightened to death.
---
So they were literally not doing gens and not baiting the killer and not getting totems and not searching chests they were just.. hiding.
---
No worries bruh just keep it üíØ
---
Trapper is Op, sometimes you can 4k with him.
---
I love it ; v ;

Make sure he doesn't go for the hook escape. I've lost a lot of players I was trying to go soft on cause I though it was thier second hook.
---
Quentin best boy.
---
A lot of gay guys too
---
Hey its time i ask. What does tunneling mean in this game and why is everyone always like ‚Äúno tunneling‚Äù.
---
"Oh hey dude how many bloodpoints you got?"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"69 bloodpoints."
---
"Aha you know what that means!"
---
  
---
\*sniff\* "I don't have enough money for discordance tier 3"
---
Happen to me today. i let him send me invite and it works like that I can‚Äôt invite him for game. Both of us appear online.
---
&gt; but it enables him to basically assure first hits and maybe even distribute some damage, which makes some survivors waste time mending and maybe healing.
---
Yeah that's what I thought their power would feel and be like. But it's not. Survivors who know to play against Legion don't heal they just mend the deep wound since it doesn't matter if they are injured because without their power Legion can't catch semi-decent survivors. Ensuring first hits is great, if you can follow up on it. Legion can't. Legion is even worse than Wraith as an M1 Killer because Wraith can immediatly follow up after the first hit. Legion has to suffer what feels like a rank 3 DS. I even tried Thanatophobia on Legion, but even when all stay injured (because vs Legion you can basically use no perks except no mither and still have an easy game) Thanatophobia's slow is kind of meh against good survivors.
---
I'm not sure it'd be toxic to be mad about it, sucks when you get stuck and can't play.
---
Yea this sucks I put in a ticket I can only get into survivor but barely
---
Oh, dw! We told him not to!
---
If this is true, that is awesome. I remember seeing that Clown cosmetic thinking one step closer to Bunny Feng. The Feng cosmetic looks awesome too.
---
Prove thyself
---
I noticed it a lot today in Green ranks, loads of them were using the Sprint burst exploit too, get kinda frustrating.
---
Sweet. That lets the killers play around too.
---
Wraith and Pig are like the kings and queens of tunneling.
---
Most unfortunately, I am on PS4, and I had my messages blocked. I have them unblocked NOW, but I still have no negative messages worth noting, only have been called a faggot after messing up a skill check which led to the sender's death, and a garbage ass kid for crawling to a Claudette who was hiding from me so she could get hatch.
---
I know, it's just uninteresting
---
Take my upvote.
---
Trapper frisbees his fucken traps
---
The new hatch mechanic sucks, wish the gates would at least open when the killer closes hatch if you are near it, youd have to escape the killer but you would have chance
---
You need to fix one more generator than people are alive for the hathc to spawn. But it only open if there is only one survivor remain. (Except with a key)
---
Ghost boy easy
---
must be cool then !
---
Yeeeah that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong kiddo. They also get a bonus because you dc‚Äôd. Congratulations, you played yourself.
---
Nope I did not know that.
---
Bad Robot!
---
And they'll just get away with it(and probs make it worse) because people will just keep paying for it anyway...
---
it's the cosmetic we deserve
---
I tend to use streamline, intensify and stretch as a base with vitality and power drift added on from there i would go for vitality and augar message if you're going for a stealth build.
---
Plague to me should definitely always stay near the top of B tier bc she has great tools to apply pressure on survs (broken status effect), and has an extremely effective downing tool (corrupt purge). Trapper being the worst also bugs me because as a trapper main myself I can assure you even rank 1 survs cannot possibly predict and disarm all your traps if you don't just place them under pallets and windows. It's all about making the most out of your terrible early game to get those traps into high traffic areas (tall grass being the best). Having the ability to down 2 survs simultaneously in a chase is an extremely underrated power and happens more often than you think with good traps. Finally, I still wouldn't agree MM is better than GF.   GF's 1 shot is much more reliable albeit only on one surv at a time, but GF also has much more mind game potential than MM. OOO is definitely a major problem for GF if the survs are in coms, but I typically don't like to entertain that scenario as SWF is already broken as it is.
---
Why not?
---
 ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TIME A SURVIVOR TOLD ME TO KILL MYSELF. ALSO, OF COURSE I AM GOING TO JUST CAMP WHEN I HAVE TWO HOOKED SURVIVORS AND ALL THREE GENS LEFT IN MY LINE OF SIGHT. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? PRETEND I HAVE SOMETHING REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO CHECK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP?
---
ALSO DEAR P3 CLAUDETTE THAT THREW DOWN ALL PALLETS ON THE MAP BEFORE YOU GUYS GOT TWO GENS DONE, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO TRASHTALK ME EVEN THOUGH THE ONLY REASON YOU ARE ALIVE IS THE 3HOOK DELIVERANCE GUY THAT SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR YOU?
---
I'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR ABOUT A WEEK NOW AND THE ONLY NICE POSTGAME LOBBY I HAD WAS A TWITCHER SWF OF ALL PEOPLE.
---
SOMEONE EVEN ADDED ME AS FRIEND JUST TO INSULT ME FOR NOT LETTING THEM FARM AND KILLING THEM. "BUT I AM GIVING YOU BLOODPOINTS!" SHUT UP, NO MERCY FOR FARMERS.
---
And tunnels baby dwight.
---
&gt;No problem.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;They are going to either give us Halloween or put it up for sale soon. Bill is not in the game and never will be but his perks already are supposedly. not seen them personally
---
\-u/mjack33 two years ago
---
It is true lol their twitter posted this
---
Iridescent Head as base kit for Huntress.
---
Plague has Corrupt Purge all the time.  
---
What do you think ?
---
The thing that makes it suck sometimes, is that the killers aren't created equally. 
---
Playing Billy with his Enduring and Tinkerer perks feels easy. You get to swing through pallets amd get a warning of which gen to zoom to.
---
Playing Myers and having to obsessively hump your obsession with 3 perks that contradict each other while praying that the obsession somehow generates *more* Evil Within to drain is totally different.
---
Doing the Adept Freddy challenge means basically running no perks until the gates come into play.
---
Wraith's perks are useless. You guarantee that the guy you are chasing never gets away due to the overflow of scratch marks and bright blood, but have no pressure or chase power.
---
Nurse is obviously a cakewalk. You got Nurses and Thanatophobia to apply some pressure, pop on an additional blink if you don't get it first try, boom, Adept.
---
But man, it feels like BHVR balanced getting the Adept achievement specifically around Nurse. Because if it was just getting a 4k, everyone would have the Adept Nurse within their first day. But the rest of those goons? Damn, try using Huntress's perks. It's basically just praying Huntress Lullaby stays up the whole game because those other perks aren't pulling any weight.
---
It would've cost you $0 to not say this
---
Yep, they are really horrible and toxic.
---
Repost
---
I laughed at this for too long
---
I did!
---
That Feng outfit is nice. I will be getting them both when they are out
---
The only thing that's deep about this, is how many times this has been reposted.
---
I guess that kinda makes it a meta-meme in a way?
---
So i bought leatherface, turns out he is the most pitiful killer out of all of them, thanks for trolling me into wasting my money and bloodpoints
---
I like all those ideas except the last one. That kid of defeats the purpose of Trapper. All the other ones sound great though!
---
Depends on whats in the pills and syringe.
---
If it's just vitimans in the bottle then go with the syringe it's allways good to live life on the edge.
---
Queue everyone coming in saying "Old Freddy is OP, the one in the video just didn't know about the Double-Locker Reverse Dream World Tech to get moderately faster downs!"
---
I like the clown one a lot, but there were definitely better survivor costumes imo
---
Can you fucking imagine seeing a bear trap soaring through the air and hitting you in the shoulder. Fuck man.
---
It's Iridescent Head, Infantry Belt and Ebony Mori for me.
---
A little NOED in the mix for extra-angry.
---
me2
---
These look nothing like the killers even in their movies
---
Dirtbag move so glad she got what was coming to her.
---
For some reason I do the opposite, when I'm casual I lean, but when it gets intense I lean back in my seat.
---
He gets an add-on that‚Äôs let‚Äôs you fucking pull their ass back as well lol
---
**Pig:** Reduce RBT timer to 2 minutes (from 2 minutes and 30 seconds currently) and make it so the jigsaw trap auras are invisible for the first 30 seconds of the timer. Then buff her crouch from 96% speed to 105% speed (slightly slower speed than huntress and hag). Change her dash attack so that the roar plays as soon as it is charged rather than as soon as you begin charging the attack. And obviously, make her crouch speed with combat straps the default stat.
---
**Doctor:** When the 5th gen is activated, survivors in Madness III see five highlighted exit doors, only two of which are real. In Madness III fake doctors will appear w/ a red stain and move towards the survivor who triggered them. Increase the spawn frequency of illusory pallets. Decrease charge time of shock therapy power. Finally, in Madness III while fixing a generator a fake skill check noise will play intermittently with no corresponding check. For QOL, slightly decrease the difficulty of snap out of it skill checks.
---
**Plague:** Make it so corrupt purge can infect objects like vile purge. Reduce terror radius from 32 to 28 meters. Survivors who reach the "Broken" stage of sickness cannot progress generators. Increase frequency of cleansing fountains but also make it so Plague gets a notification when one is used to cleanse. 
---
That's all that comes to mind atm.
---
I think they're those Flintstone vitamin c gummies
---
o h  s h i t
---
Lmao
---
I've be getting high rank survivors even outside of SWF these days. I was at rank 17 getting dudes from rank 12.
---
Sorry, I just think Trapper is garbage without add-ons and his power doesn't make up for the time he lost setting his traps. Plus, he has too much counter play, I mean, Dead Hard is a meta perk and nobody gonna walk through grass against Trapper. 
---
I think Myers has stronger snow ball than Ghost Face and his power give him more than just instant down ( he also has faster vault speed and increased lunge in EW3 ), while Ghost Face has a shorter instant down duration for an individually survivor and nothing else. Also, Monitor and Abuse + Infectious Fright is dirty on Myers, very dirty, GF really doesn't have such a strong perk sinergy. Again, OoO and 30 seconds cooldown on his power + plus the fact that he can be revealed behind walls ( seeing happening with my eyes ) kill GF for me. 
---
And Plague doesn't seem able to keep the pressure very well without add-ons, but with at least 2 green add-ons, she might be able to.
---
Same concept. I think it would be cool if they added a Killer with a harpoon for just this. Killer shoots survivor, struggle bar similar to when they are carried (although smaller), insta-grab if reeled all the way in. Other survivors could come by and help out but that reveals their position and pulls them off gens.
---
Wait do need anyone at nurse tier. Once everyone is with billy and spirit it will be okay
---
There are some pretty bad ones üòÑ. I am a rank 16 killer ( I don't play killer often) and I will get matched with people who flashlight at every dropped pallet and every vaulted window. Once I was grouped up with a rank 2 survivor. I couldn't catch him. I tried but not for long.  Good luck out there
---
"NO GRANDPA, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOU SHOOTING DOWN AXIS AIRSHIPS AGAIN!"
---
you are a nutsack
---
Claaudette's are just the worst type of players to encounter on both sides.
---
Plot twist:  Huntress speaks 0 English and only heavily butchered backwoods Russian.  Literally does not understand Meg‚Äôs jabbering.
---
I bet it has fewer bugs as well
---
Hey this hurts. I'm the Claudette who turns away from the exit to come get you off the basement hook. BENELOVENT OH SWEET ALTRUISM.
---
The easiest rework they could‚Äôve done MONTHS ago would be to lower his sleep time from 7 seconds to like 3-4 seconds. Then with the add-ons you‚Äôd be able to make it immediate. Literally that would‚Äôve been the quickest way to fix him.
---

---
Ahh a fellow altruistic Claudette.. I once did 3 gens with multiple saves..  Even saved someone during the end game collapse with no one escapes death.. My reward? The person I saved threw a pallet down in front of me and killed me. Even t bagged behind the pallet.
---
Is this like the original model that they used before she came out or something?
---
Low key I was hoping this was a genuine post because I would have saved it to help with my adepts, but I still laughed lol

Yeah, and leave it for later. It's a great gen spot for later in game to prevent a three-gen strat

You shouldnt have wasted your time on him. Hes clearly just some killer bias rank 20 noob who is incapable of getting kills without noed.

I think you mean Nurse or Billy.  They're the most boring for survivors to play against.

Trapper is strong if you play him correctly faking traps or placing traps at corners of loops makes him strong.

---
Scratched mirror Myers is good there, as is Skillcheck Doctor, Pig with Amanda's Letter builds, Freddy with the Pill Bottle and Class Mural, etc. Really anything that lets a killer capitalize on lots of information quickly, without having to cross big maps as well as use the walls for cover to keep survivors wary
---
U did say, so stfu
---
Pog
---
Has this been happening more often? Because my last 4 games were full of laggy killers running through pallets-Hitting me-being stunned and sliding back to the opposite side
---
That‚Äôs fucked up
---
How do u get the names like that on the side?
---
What have you been smoking? By the time those traps are placed you're a couple of gens down, and even if you were to shut down a chase by having them walk into a trap you have to either waste a shit ton of time picking up the trap to reset it or go place it somewhere else. Trapper works in low ranks or against potatoes. He's an M1 killer with a gimmick power that hurts him more than it helps
---
He looks like hes been crying
---
Well it wasnt his fault that you are so bad that you need to camp to win
---
I‚Äôm gonna ask an honest question: maybe it has to do with the copyright of the saw series? Idk how these things work, but maybe this was the price they were forced to sell it to give enough money to the original copyright holders?
---
Idk I‚Äôm giving them a huge benefit of the doubt here
---
No, nurse and spirit. If they are good those games are over very quickly. Billy can still be ran around against good survivors.
---
*Flash lighting in and of itself isn't toxic*
---
 This has been a PSA.
---
Nurse Is definitely the most op killer, especially with her best add ons(omegablink is an instawin) Spirit with speed and duration add-ons is comfortably number 2 though.

Same here, while waiting for games as killer I keep getting a No Network Connection error, and I get logged out and have to sign in again. I‚Äôm able to sign in just fine but after waiting to find game I‚Äôll get that error before I even find a new lobby.
---
Who said otherwise? Doesn't stop Nurse from being bullshit
---
I love the sounds it makes. You hear it all throughout the menu and I feel like it might be a bug but if it is I don't want them to remove it.
---
Surely you can get ranks 7 killer and 9 survivor if you play enough. I'm just saying that SWF is still a bit overpowered, and sometimes you face 2-3 or even 4 SWF's in a row. It becomes a stress inducting machine. Not saying to actually remove it from the game, but apply some penalties, like do one more gen or increasing the time to complete actions like repairing and healing, idk, something to compensate for the ausence of the lack of information it was meant to be present.
---
eh pretty mild. Not as bad as opening a door and letting them get close just to mori them

So why hasn‚Äôt she been nerfed and why doesn‚Äôt everyone play her? Because she is very high skill cap and only a small percentage can play her to make her OP. I‚Äôd love to see a new player or even a some what experienced hop on nurse, she takes a lot of practice
---
I don't see why not, you do have a lot of generator protection but no chase perks, something M1 killers have a very high value on. Thrilling Tremors is cool because it doubles gen protection and tracking, tho more for tracking
---
Xbox dbd has shit frames
---
60fps should be coming one day right? The game isn‚Äôt X enhanced so the game should hit the pretty easy.

wew lad
---
Exactly what just happened to me. I'm trying survivor now to see if that works.
---
On PS4 it‚Äôs spirit and Billy.  Not a lot of nurses on PS4 and even less good ones at that.
---
Nurse
---
the devs said ps4 is having issues so it is possible Xbox is now effected by it as well
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1151959354087804928 looks like they are having issues on ps4

:D !

I would really like to see you and some other guys that say killer is easy even against SWF. Every match you have something to say "Oh I would have did this and win the game". Surely made some mistakes here, but not huge, survivors that actually repaired fast, even considering his lack of gen pressure.
---
&gt;why doesn‚Äôt everyone play her?
---
1. Have you ever been in red ranks? 60% of survivor matches in there are against nurse.
---
2. Playing only 1 killer gets boring.
---
&gt;why hasn‚Äôt she been nerfed
---
1. She isn't so OP to where she needs a nerf.
---
2. Killer mains would go ballistic.
---
&gt;she is very high skill cap
---
Kinda, she is probably the higgest skill cap killer but then again, as long as youre paying attention and have a little bit of experience, killer is pretty easy.
---
&gt;only a small percentage can play her to make her OP. 
---
Not true.
---
Nooo shit, Sherlock. Thats what I'm trying to say. Its literally the game, not survivors nor killers fault, just lack of balance from the devs.
---
This is good news, Brick‚Äôs great. He‚Äôs looking fit.  Boxing has taken a liking to him.

* **Rule 8** - Oversaturated Content. Oversatured posts are common &amp; uninteresting posts that do not add anything of value to the subreddit.

---
The idea is to prioritize area lock down over chasing, since you got a section of the map you don't need to worry about. Thought might swap Mad Grit for something else.
---
The rank 1 percentage is 80%. https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/270/X1L1JQEBEOMA.jpg
---
But to be clear, the devs made the flashlight avoidable, then took that away intentionally during animations wherein the Killer looks down and wouldn't logically be affected by them, and they're STILL exploitable? If it's not a bug that animation locks give FREE blinds, it's terrible design.
---
To me, getting a mori ritual is the most stressful ones especially if it‚Äôs a killer you don‚Äôt play. Leveling up Huntress or hag to get a green mori and then playing a game with not good perks and add ons and praying that you find the person you hooked already so you can mori them and they don‚Äôt dc. It‚Äôs just too stressful to me
---
I never have any issues at rank 1.
---
I'VE BEEN REALLY LUCKY BEING A NEW PLAYER WHO ISN'T USED TO PLAYING IN FIRST PERSON IN GETTING PRETTY NICE SURVIVORS WHO HAVE EVEN SAID NICE THINGS IN THE CHAT BUT SUDDENLY I GET FIVE GAMES IN A ROW WITH PEOPLE TEABAGGING AND INSULTING ME IN THE END GAME CHAT FOR BEING A SHITTY PLAYER. I KNOW I SUCK I GOTTA START FROM SOMEWHERE! :(

Bricky is fucking *hot*. Like idc how straight he is I want to *succ that bricc*

---
I only get bad frames as killer on the Snow map, don't remember what it's called. I get literally 5-10 fps on that map. As survivor I always get at least 40+.
---
Its not that its expensive. Its more along the lines that they teased the community with the odd pricing.

huh?

I was doing this but now it kicking me out mid game. All I want to do is drill people with Pig.

Its the lessor known trick to hag traps. It screws up survivor's chase  by messing with your camera for a split second. Its subtle but effective.

If you need to spend fifteen dollars, it cost 15 dollars.
---
Let me enlighten you, fun fact only 5% of PC players  have been to rank 5 survivor and 3% to rank 5 killer. Even though that‚Äôs not red ranks will count it. 60% of the rough 2-3% is nothing, so not everyone plays her, as we both said very high skill cap. Very high skill cap means that she‚Äôs hard to play, however she can be very good when mastered, but is not nerfed due to that skill cap. My point was that a killer is always OP if played perfect, but being nurse isn‚Äôt too OP as even in red ranks nurses still do struggle, even the best of killers have rough times on nurse. So yes she can be OP but so can every killer.
---
Yeah my FPS as a survivor is always good but sometimes I lag but killer I don‚Äôt have lag just really shitty FPS
---
it's still hard to loop a Billy
---
Yeah I feel it sometimes.  A lot of the times I have the headphones pushed just a bit back past the nipple of the hat so it's not annoying.
---
Yes! I like the hair update but physics really need to come back to some hairs. It's just stuck to her back. And Jane's ponytail has basically no physics anymore
---
*When they cry about a licensed outfit being expensive*
---
Lol, as a killer main I highly appreciate this.
---
No, i never said you were making this up. And tou have to be pretty ignorant to think that i proved your point. If only 40% of the people who bought the game consistently play it then that 5% and 3% arent as low if youre talking about active players.
---
It's not about supporting development. If you want to support development, you can go make a donation. This is about paying for a severely overpriced service that a lot of people will sadly feel they need (despite it obviously not being a necessity)
---
The game seems to be weird lately. I can‚Äôt explain why but I feel like issues are literally everywhere involving everything.
---
Okay, if it really is the hitboxes, there's an incredibly easy test. Go to a private game, have the killer and survivor stand in front of each other, and throw hatchets next to the surv, getting closer each time. If it really is the hitboxes, you'll see hits at this distance standing still. If it's the latency, which it is, because I've tested the exact thing I've just described, you'll never see hits like this.
---
Granted there can still be latency with servers, but it doesn't change the fact that *this has nothing to do with hitboxes*. Not like the real hitbox problem Huntress used to have, with those fuckin pickup trucks and picnic tables whose hitboxes extended to the heavens...
---
Chinese fashion is a mess*
---
Is it affecting you any if more people can enjoy the game?
---
If you ever get her with blood warden it‚Äôs gonna feel amazing
---
I like the Feng skin but the clown skin in kinda lame. Guess he needed some skins tho so whatever
---
Not strong enough to steamroll a game.
---
Holy fuck that clow skin actually won
---
If Killer mains were as thin-skinned and ill-mannered as Survivor mains, there would be no community.
---
Noed On Mr Myers
---
Not even 40% consistently play. It has about 14-20 thousand players consistently a day. It‚Äôs hard to know how many players have purchased but 150k reviews on the game. So probably over 1 million sales. But even with 150k players from the reviews. About 10% play consistently.  But it‚Äôs likely to be a lot a lot lower than that. Consistent players are a tiny percentage. Barely any game not even fort it‚Äôs keep 40% players active at this stage
---
Every killer can steamroll a game. Especially against unskilled survivors.
---
Dude I‚Äôm not hating on them but lowkey the controls gameplay itself just shouldn‚Äôt be controller
---
I hope they grossed you out. &lt;3
---
dude my friend gets tunneled literally every game and plays Quentin. He doesn't believe me when I told him it's because he mains Quentin.  its fucking funny
---
it's true on PS4. If you straight up close DBD, no one gets any points at all. Maybe it's been fixed, but before I took a several month break, you could cloes DBD and no one got anything for that match
---
It's a gift for some nice baby Dwight out there.
---
I use NOED as a sort of fail safe cause once they get the generators done I don't really focus on stalking and really focus on keeping them away from the gates. also when I use scratched mirror it gives me a lite version of tier 4
---
Oh, this is sick. :(
---
I don't know it, but I dunno if I want to now. It's such a creepy look. xD
---
I guess you have stricter standards for consistent than i do. But 40% was still high, youre right. But then again, you just furthered MY argument.
---
Just wait until after Christmas, when he's fattened up on naughty survivors.
---
*something something fan service something something*
---
Thank you so much! I really appreciate that. And yeah, Ace is a good boy! &lt;3
---
WHAT HAS CLAUDETTE *NOT* DONE?
---
Thank you very much! I was never going to buy any Clown skins (he's just far from one of my favorite killers to play), but this one was just irresistible!
---
boi you got outplayed
---
*don't forget to pack your bbq*
---
That's cute! I was calling them finger sandwiches. xD
---
He's been fasting in anticipation of eating the naughty survivors for Christmas.
---
He looks so pleased with himself, the smug little shit.
---
What you just described seems stressful, considering it makes you want to quit the game...
---
Freddy can't attack survivors unless they're asleep, and it takes him several seconds to put them to sleep.  He's helpless to stop them from healing the downed survivor and leaving.
---
This saddens me
---
Not trying to make this a circlejerk but the last two games I've played as killer I've been told to kill myself, accused of being a camper, accused of tunneling, tbagged... 
---
and it kinda keeps me from playing the game. I only ever say gg but survivors shit on me almost every game.
---
$100 says that this is actually bhvr's game. They are just milking the mobile market.
---
All credibility was lost with kiddo. Seriously, such a creativity-less diss. If anything, arguing with a child makes you look like the A-hole.
---
Giraffe neck? This is incredible.
---
Oh your friends actually unhook you before you die in this game. This is new to me
---
40% is wrong, and I don‚Äôt know what your argument is anymore, you‚Äôve babbled too much and gave same things I said.
---
Haha I had no idea people could do this. Hilarious

Identity V is arguably the best DbD wannabe out there imo, and it‚Äôs a mobile app too so there‚Äôs that.

Still, can‚Äôt they sue over the app in the pic? That‚Äôs LITERALLY the Trapper, pretty sure that‚Äôs still against copyrights.

Ps4? If so, there have been reports of such errors lately. BHVR is looking into it

Fair, but still, if they‚Äôre lazy about stuff like this it probably won‚Äôt look good for business.

Idk though I‚Äôm no expert.
---

---
But that's racist!!!
---
Jesus christ, another moron.
---
Last night I got to play three non-bugged games as Survivor due to the insane queue times on PS4. 
---
Game 1: Pink-haired Nea would sit near me doing nothing until someone in her SWF got in trouble. Then, she'd vault ledges, slam lockers, and miss skill checks on or new me until the Killer came to check. We'd both run, but they were rank 4 and I'm rank 13. I don't know how to 360 and juke very well. I managed to make up until their Meg got caught out, but got hooked second. I rescued Meg. They did not rescue me.
---
Game 2: Another SWF group decided that they wanted to play "Blind the Killer" all match. Three Blendettes with a femur offering to hit MacMillan. I repaired four out of five gens, but they trained the killer to me on the fifth. They repaired the fifth gen while I looped the clearly new Leatherface. They opened the gates and we escaped, but holy shit.
---
Game 3: Myers on Springwood. Relatively normal gameplay until the end, when the SWF's shirtless Dave vanished entirely instead of working on the fifth gen. His buds got hooked, but suicided instead of allowing us to rescue them. Like, I was five meters from one and zoop, there they went. I got hooked while trying to get the last gen done. When i died, he hatched before I could even fully leave the session.
---
I'm really glad you and yours try not to be toxic, but y'all are in the minority. Maybe one in twenty. Maybe.
---
No? My argument is that nurse is a tad OP. And the reaaon that it being a small percentage of people that actually play the game helps my argument is because you said that 5% of players have reached rank 5, ehen steam gets these statistics it includes all people that own the game. So realistically i would ballpark the playerbase who've gotten to rank 5 to be at least 35%.
---
Ghostface is a joke. Plague has real potential at red ranks.
---
who
---
If 60% of the best players, who want to win, are using this one killer because they think it gives them the best shot at winning. There's an issue.
---
That would be so good!!! Hitboxes are screwed, and some killers have McDonald wifi. Hopefully not for long!
---
The quality of this video ruins the joke.
---
I mean, that Leatherface should be in-game
---
Billy isn't as any where near as tough as Spirit
---
I mean, I guess it's good motivation to kill.
---
I'm not really sure. But I did like the reverse pallet drop where the survivor can gi through the Killer and drop the pallet and get to the other side.
---
Thx tokio :D
---
I would get Trapper and Wraith figures
---
But if you know how, you still can
---
That gives me some Dragon Age Inquisition vibes.
---
How do you get to say what Freddy is "meant to be?" The fucking devs are the ones that made him. I would think they would decide what he is supposed to be?
---
Spirit: Spooky girl
---
Legion: Stabby boi/girl
---
Plague: Pukey girl
---
Ghostface: Leaning boy?
---
Lmaoo I was feeling the same when looking back at the footage, literally used the bamboozle perk on his brain lol. Thank u for the kind words though, appreciate
---
Omg pretty good job so far
---
So Just because I use Micheal I can't use NOED okay pretty sure I can play anyway I want.
---
No, they nerfed him to the point his own abiliy hinders him. His vault speed was slowed so much that noy only does it look weird, but he is still able to be looped around some structures.
---
They also slowed his run speed so much that you probably won't catch anyone unless you get close to them first, and you definitely will not be able to get multiple survivors if they are not already bunched up on one gen.
---
He is useless...
---
lmao, this was pretty cool.
---
Killer or survivor main? Is either side op in your opinion?
---
Baby dwights have a tad more experience than dweets
---
Yea ? where.
---
Also what toxicity
---
What does it do?
---
Don't fucking put words in my mouth. What I said he was (tracking, stall, and stealth) is literally how they designed Freddy to be............ My problem is that they're ruining that theme.
---
I‚Äôll try
---
How dare you? You tried to kill the survivors, that's a dick move.
---
Yes, but she is not as popular as nurse or as gamechanging.
---
So luck is tied to the survivors percent chance of unhooking themselves? I always thought it measured the chance of a skillcheck occurring with higher luck decreasing the odds
---
Yep it‚Äôs a widespread problem on PS4 (I think it‚Äôs only on PS4), all my friends and other players are experiencing this problem. BHVR already addressed it on Twitter for PS4 so they‚Äôll fix it in a bit.
---
I think it works in this house and that house in farm map
---
True, but I also see less harrassment directed at female streamers of dbd. Is our toxic community somehow wholesomely not sexist? Or is it just the collective toxicity in the game brings us together?
---
Sorry that stuff happened my friend. I‚Äôm on PC, otherwise I‚Äôd say I hope me and my buddies find you and give you a decent game you deserve!! Good luck out there king :)
---
The DBD platinum on ps4 was one of the hardest platinums I have ever gotten. Especially the nurse trophies and the all 4 survivors escaping through the hatch trophy. I dont have friends so I had to get that one with no comm public lobbies.
---
It doesn't hurt that there are a lot of beefcakes in DBD though.
---
dragon age comming in hot around here hahah &lt;3
---
I'm a Survivor main but I do play plenty of Killer. Rank 1 on both every season but I mostly play Survivor with friends and can't stand solo Surviving I would rather play Killer. The game is still Survivor sided there is no doubt about that but nowadays a lot of people dont play as y that seriously so Survivors tend to lose. In a world where theres no add ons or perks being used Survivors should win like 80% of the time if not more if they all know what they are doing.
---
Fuck it I am now Zein 20th
---
They should've had freddys head coming out the top of a tv and arms coming out the sides of the tv, just like that welcome to prime time scene.
---
Really digging it. Thanks
---
Nope. As far as I'm aware, the more luck, the more chances you have of unhooking yourself and freeing yourself from a bear trap.. Haven't encountered anything else that seems to be affected by luck
---
Okay that good
---
Is nurse op? Does she need a nerf?
---
Welcome to our hell, where swf is broken and it's in tour best interest to not play any games hwere 4 survivors join at the same time.
---
Rule of the internet: You can't take them seriously if they have an anime profile pic.
---
Actually, that's one sentiment we partially share.  That reminisce a time when developers made more games instead of clinging to one.  Alas, I digress.  I still disagree with you here.
---
If these where pay to win features I might be inclined to agree.  They just aren't.   Cosmetics are purely optional and add nothing of substance.  No one is holding a gun to your head.  
---
 It's not greedy, lol.  You don't even know how much they're paying to the liscense holders.  Just don't buy it dude.
---
You'd think we're talking about the price of food here.  This is entertainment my friend.  The market self adjusts.
---
This conversation is pointless.  You're not going to convince me anymore I will you.  It means nothing to me, I don't own any cosmetics.  Except the puppet which I was happy to pay for, and glad knowing my money went to good use.  I think you all need to get over it really.
---
Luck affects the chance you get off hooks and the chance you escape from bear traps. It currently has no other functionality in game.
---
BHVR was a part of Identity V, do your research lmao
---
He‚Äôs d tier at best in my opinion
---
Looking like some good prototypes! I hope they do more killers eventually (Huntress and Nurse would probably do very well) and maybe even some survivors.
---
Lmao I'm sure its much more fun for you getting to kill survivors. I also play both sides and boy let me tell you. Playing killer takes SO much less skill than survivor it's not even funny. I'm sure you'd love to shoot fish in a barrel but I'm glad the hatch is in the game. It's one of the very few things outside of the killers control and it's fun to watch them complain about it.
---
It's not very obvious. I know people who will 99 their sprint burst to potentially avoid a hit.
---
SLIDE THEIR STEAM NAMES OVER HERE, I'LL STOMP THEIR &gt;!in-game!&lt; TEETH IN
---
I can imagine it and I needed it lol.
---
Can't forget your Iri Huntress with Infantry Belt
---
Nice caption, lol.
---
Literally just told you I can tell the difference and you wanna keep going? Ffs.

Lol!  Playing killer takes so much less skill.  Yikes man this has to be the most obvious troll bait ever dude.  There's no way you sincerely believe that or you're the babiest of survivors.  Killer takes so much more focus, decision making and multitasking it's not even funny.  This is just silly man
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Nurse us strong but I wouldnt say she is "OP". Mainly because if the survivors are fast enough on doing gens they should be fine. Nurse would end up with 1 or 2 kills max assuming she is not using add ons or a mori. Her add ons are what make her OP not her by herself. She is strong yes but not unstoppable you just have to know what you're doing and do gens. If they nerf Nurse they could possibly make her useless she is a hard character to balance. Either she will be very weak or very strong. She is slower than Survivors so her power has to make up for it.
---
I own her but I prefer her default
---
i would go ‚Äòdamn, cant believe i didnt think about that‚Äô and gg
---
Recently I've been having good Claudette players for teammates. This more applies to Nea and Jane for me
---
They don't pay any sort of license for their own characters and I've always thought they were overpriced really 
---
Anyways we'll have to agree to disagree. I'm just really over the greedy and exploitative video game publishers these days. Games really just want to rack in 120+ dollars and put in minimal effort for it. That's just business I suppose
---
YOU ARE *SUPPOSED* TO LOSE AS THE SURVIVOR, YOU JUST NEED TO BUY ENOUGH TIME BEFORE YOUR INEVITABLE DOWNING
---
YOU AREN'T MEANT TO LOOP THE KILLER ALL GAME EVERY GAME WITHOUT A SCRATCH, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO **DIE**
---
No, worst killer.
---
Why is Edd black in this
---
delayed until the 28th? i think thats the date but its a double episode
---
IT‚ÄôS FUCKING ANNOYING AND NOT FUN TO SEE MYSELF GET HIT 5 FEET AWAY FROM A WINDOW
---
You are right. Especially when the player uses DS aggressively (staying on a gen or going in a locker to bait you into interacting with them.
---
Pro tip: If you run make your choice, you will know when their DS expires because MYC will also expire.
---
Tea lmfaoooo
---
Cool to hear from a 5k hour player. I don‚Äôt think i could do that, this game has too much bs and toxicity.
---
Stalking boi 2.0?
---
Luck is exclusively chance to escape a beartrap or hook.
---
+1% chance per tier of luck offering.
---
Virgo's lips is +3% to all survivors, base odds is 4% for self unhooking.
---
In theory, if you make a max odds to self-unhook build and everyone runs the setup for it (Since it takes everyone using at least the team luck perk), you can get up to an 86% chance to unhook yourself over 3 tries (With Slippery Meat it increases to nearly a 96% chance).
---
This is why I, a Pig main, put the traps directly on the survivors to avoid this issue.
---
There's an update on Tuesday?
---
Is the Freddy rework going live in that update as well?
---
JUST GOT A 4K WITH A SCRATCHED MIRROR MYERS BUILD AND WAS ACCUSED OF HACKING. I TRIED EXPLAINING THAT I WAS RUNNING SCRATCHED MIRROR AND THE GUY SAID ‚ÄúI EVEN TOLD MY FRIENDS IM GONNA RUN TO THE BASEMENT AND HEAL AND SEE IF YOU FOLLOWED ME THERE‚Äù 
---
SO I EXPLAINED THAT I COULD SEE HIS AURA WHEN STALKING WITHIN 32 METERS AND HE SAID ‚ÄúYEAH RIGHT YOU ARENT FOOLING ANYONE‚Äù 
---
SO THEN I TOLD HIM I WAS ALSO RUNNING BBQ SO I COULD SEE HIM RUN TO THE BASEMENT AFTER I HOOKED HIS FRIEND AND THEN HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO LEAVE THE FUCKING CHAT FUCK SICK DICK LICK
---
Mhmm 100%. In dbd it‚Äôs just genera toxicity. Not racist sexist or anything like that because unless it‚Äôs on your profile no one knows. If I dare open my mouth in a game with VC (like Friday the 13th or deceit to name similar games to dbd) it‚Äôs all over. Funs ruined. Days ruined. It‚Äôs just impossible to play. I gave up on playing competitive because of the sexism and whenever I encounter it nowadays I just ditch and go to dbd to let my anger out. At least if people are toxic there it‚Äôs because of my actions not how I was born.
---
Speaking of this topic, has anyone realise when you hook Kate or pick her up her hair disappears and she is bald for like a second?
---
\*Oh boy! smooching time!\*
---
Yo man wtf I've been inviting you
---
Either a lag-switch or that Myers is playing on Mars. Definitely looks like one.
---
Ugh same
---
It looks exactly like old sb when it happens. When its 99% there is a slight pause in running because the exhaustion needs to go away.
---
I never even once ran into a 99% sb and I have 37 days played. New exploit shows up and suddenly 99% is a thing. No, stop being delusional.
---
Aww that's so sweet! ‚ù§‚ù§
---
Thanks for letting us know.

My friend is in white btw

---
Killer is the one who said that.
---
Yo I want that d100.
---
They call you toxic yet they abused a game breaking glitch?
---
Yep
---
Ill camp the hook but i will let them save and not tunnel the hooked survivors. For stealth killers this is very effective and can work even better than just looking for the other survivors
---
Mhmm. I still have the messages lol.
---
Pls teach me your ways
---
Ghostface is bad on his map because there id literally nothing for him to hide behind
---
Can you post them?
---
Question
---
Could yo I try this out and show us what it really looks like? I wanna see how false that image is
---
Had a game against trapper the other day and it took me more than 16 tries to get out
---
By making outstanding DLC packs and cosmetic packages that are tantalizing, ala Head Case and Charity Packs?
---
Dwight was just a ghost smh
---
Because it‚Äôs Adam
---
Idk how. Its just it my reactions I guess.
---
Probably from dedicated YouTube(ers) videos of DBD where the goal of the video is to be toxic so the community is following that example and being toxic too because their favorite YouTuber in DBd is funny/entertaining being toxic. Kinda bs
---
Not really. Companies pray there's no outrage, because that means they can try to push even further next time, this ruining the experience further for the silent.
---
When you post a screenshot of the same punchline people have seen a million times for the attention
---
Thank you homie &lt;3
---
haha should have just cooperated more ez
---
(DCs intensify)
---
Not necessarily. Some players, especially solo players, play very well and deserve the hatch escape. It‚Äôs not their fault their teammates died too early or couldn‚Äôt loop the killer for more than 5 seconds or making basic mistakes. Sometimes, the killer doesn‚Äôt deserve every kill. So I would say it‚Äôs very situational.
---
outplayed

Also, here are some previews so that you know what they look like in game! &lt;3

*crouching 32 meters away* what are you talking about?
---
it literally was a buff. they took his meme power, modified it a bit, and then turned legion into an m1 killer so that any noob could play them without experience or changing their gameplay
---
I‚Äôm such a bad killer I probably would bring insta down hatches and still lose
---
Sounds like you just happened to have enough cells left over. You can‚Äôt buy exactly 1188 Cells, meaning the only way to get enough cells is to pay $15 for the 1100 cell pack+the 500 cell pack. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs $15. Not everyone will end up having cells left over from their last purchase.
---
They might have been using Object of obsession or mettle of man. Both reveal survivor auras to you as a downside to the perk.
---
Never said you couldn‚Äôt. Said it was a bad look despite the caption of ‚ÄúFelt Nice.‚Äùü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

---
First he needs to steal Hillbilly's chainsaw so he can get on with some groovy world saving.
---
You want to make survivors escape instead of getting 1 free instadown? why?
---
Well that‚Äôs just not a smart leatherface.
---
&gt; Honestly any survivor that brags about a hatch escape period is beyond sad.
---
I mean a lot of the time, yeah, it's just that you found it first, but I've looped my way to it, juked my way to it, etc., it's not at all just a free escape all the time.
---
I like the animation, but I like the sounds of the other one
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
But you just said that you want them to do bones so you cant be gen rushed?
---
I true memelord adds in that watermark with photoshop
---
To quote AdmiralBahroo, "If you're a killer main, you hate the survivors. If you're a survivor main, you hate the survivors even more."
---
You wont get banned for seeing survivors aura, that's not an hack lmao, youre safe
---
But...it's not $15. I get what your saying but factually it is wrong.
---
Because NOED is a bullshit perk that doesn't tell survivors that their marked when literally every other perk in the game does. Rancor does, Make Your Choice does, Haunted Ground does, even Myers and Ghostface do. There is no reason why NOED shouldn't.
---
is that a power drill instead of a hidden blade? Metal
---
Bro watch the first one It's my favorite horror movie for sure
---
It is okay, we all feel the same.
---
I have and have burned about 15 moris because of it.
---
I try to not let that get to me. People are going to be toxic no matter what game you play.
---
My point is just break the pallet duuud
---
Bamboozle and fire up nurse. Shit's so broken it's a win during the loading screen.
---
You are under arrest for horny.
---
GREAT! NOW I CAN WATCH EVERYONE SEE EACH OTHER THEN DECIDE "EH, HE'S CLOSER HE'LL GET EM" WHILE I DIE ON FIRST HOOK
---
Scream is like, actually an incredible movie imo. Besides the fact that it‚Äôs meta as shit- it doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously, keeps you interested, and has one of my favorite performances by an actor in the horror genre (Matthew Lillard). 
---
Anyone w Netflix who hasn‚Äôt seen it yet I realllllly recommend it.
---
I'm just saying I've personally outplayed the killer hard a number of times to get hatch.  I'm not going to message someone about it or anything.
---
it's not instant but if you know they have NOED the second it activates you can go through the map back to totems you scouted out during the match.
---
And that 4% is very noticeable when you have enough experience.
---
One day you will find someone to encourage you.
---
You can do it!
---
Yeah I know it is, I just think it‚Äôs stupid that for some reason because nurse is the most strong killer in the game people literally tell you‚Äôre not allowed to use some perks on her. I understand the mentality of if you‚Äôre a good nurse you don‚Äôt need to run ruin and you can use the slot for something else more fun but you can‚Äôt deny that the stronger perks still help you the most. Let me play the game how I want because I‚Äôm not tunneling or camping so at least I‚Äôm not an asshole. I can‚Äôt disagree nurse is strong hence why I don‚Äôt play her often but if you‚Äôre gonna play her you should use whatever you please. Noed, Devour, and ruin as well as I‚Äôm sure a few others get a reputation on nurse as ‚Äúif you need them you‚Äôre just bad because nurse is so good she doesn‚Äôt need them‚Äù, however I can double pip 4K easy without if I try, they just make it even more easy
---
the controls make it near unplayable
---
and there's facecamping almost every game
---
might be better with a gamepad (or by basically cheating by emulating on PC)
---
/hug 
---
(It will be all better now don‚Äôt worry)
---
I have no clue :( I‚Äôm assuming so!
---
The med kits though
---
Or when you teleport five feet backwards to where the killer is and get caught cause fuck you for wanting to play the game
---
Should have brought Franklin's.  I always do if I see a SWF with medkits.
---
Ikr bro honestly if you run those perks on nurse you‚Äôre too dependent on them. Smh learn to play nurse with weaker perks she‚Äôs broken enough
---
i die a little on the inside when this happens
---
Isn't he one of the survivors though?
---
yes fortunetly
---
I never ever use the dash attack when sneaking up , cuz it makes the roar  alerts the survivors and i usually miss if they have sprint burst .
---
King crimson? A man of culture i see
---
Then how much is it? $10.88? That‚Äôs still too much for a skin.
---
**Which only makes him look better**
---
Kudos to you, Op.
---
anything that ain‚Äôt DbD is a DbD wannabe lmao
---
Is this a bad joke?
---
Have no idea, but just saying the Killer should have brought Franklin's for that match.
---
This glitch has been around since the wake up bug, but no one's talking about it at all for some reason~
---
I really don't think he's getting reworked because he's bad, I think he's getting reworked because it's not fun to be chased by someone that can see you when you get 24 meters away.
---
Who were we toxic to? How were we toxic to the killer tho
---
Nice
---
That is 100% a Franklins match if I‚Äôve ever seen one. 
---
Sadly even that doesn‚Äôt play around Instaheal. It can to a point but yeah. 
---
Who knows if the person has franklins either. Or even Leatherface
---
I run both premonition and spine chill.
---
Right...but $10 is the sweet spot huh?
---
he is highlighted, and his  name is joe in top right
---
[removed]
---
Protect the baby dweets
---
I got you,
---
"Bamboozle and fire up nurse. Shit's so broken it's a win during the loading screen."
---
I've seen only like two complaints and that's it
---
It can be really rough. You really do have to be a killer main to deal fairly against swf. 
---
Personally I play to get 4 bbq stacks as a mainly survivor main.
---
Lol appreciated
---
Yeah lol honestly if you use that build you need to learn to actually play nurse and stop relying on such strong crutch perks
---
Hear me out for a minute. ever since they changed exhaustion they forgot to rework exhaustion addons, which means if you hit a survivor even once, all exhaustion perks become empty perk slots.
---
You're "addon that you want to use" stops them from using the "perks they want to use". See the hypocrisy?
---
Fair point but gen-tapping is a reportable offense. We aren't talking flashlights or teabagging, were talking about something that's exploiting the game mechanics - like the killer body blocking you in a corner so you cant move. Its in the game but its not intended.
---
People can downvote all they want but gen tapping is equal to using the Sprint Burst glitch or any other exploit to cheat the game. You effective are passing a skill-mechanic by using the exploit. Idk how its rude to say if you feel like you need to use exploits in a game you don't deserve any respect. If your decent at a game you don't need to cheat, if you cheat you'll always be a noob becausr your never getting challenged to be better.
---
jesus christ beard look at all the upvotes on our comments
---
Got it. Someone messaged me today saying I was tunneling them. He kept going back to the same generator over and over so I don't know what he expected me to do. Just let him complete it? Lol
---
Games in the middle of transitioning to a big changing phase, proper seasons are being introduced and it‚Äôll change to once per season
---
Pretty much, that‚Äôs exactly what he expected. Survivor Privilege is real.
---
I sent you a request my id is Devtastic152
---
Well you can either watch the killer walking around or you can wait until they hit someone else.
---
When survivors see that NOED is active they get more careful, just like MYC or Haunted Grounds, and the killer will be busy looking for people instead of guarding the totem
---
Because Clown a) isn't a good killer and b) is very boring to play.  Good teachables though.  He really needs something else going on - just having a tossable snare is literally the laziest design ever.
---
Oh those are the guys that are just Madness Halluciation GENERATORS to me. I spam shock therapy on them until they're rank 3 and take advantage of the fact that they'll never stop summon Fake Doctors for me
---
Thank you. ...Is this piracy? Just curious.
---
Buying a battle pass to be allowed to grind for cosmetics for a character you bought in a game you purchased.
---
You mean pirate?I don't think so,the game is f2p permanently so you probably won't have any problems.
---
Yeah its not too bad.
---
Thank you!
---
I just ignore people who do that. They end up chasing me to get me to chase them. That's 1 less person doing gens.
---
 
---
So no.
---
For the sake of efficiency, you want to go down and pick up premonition, then go for the syptic agent, medkit and flashlight.
---
The entity will consume resiliance, go down, and when it consumes that envelope, the syringe will also be consumed in the same turn.
---
True true lol You ever get people send weird request? Like "Yo lemme see you step on a pie" or "Can I watch you walk on a pile of Legos?"
---
I'll probably buy a set just to help ya out &amp; for your time, this shit just intrigues me lol
---
*aggressive dab*
---
Most Neas are absolute crackheads
---
Hmm, this makes some sense - it's definitely not something I'm doing now. I tend to play it a bit more organically, I guess, I'll quietly kill generators even after I've maxed sometime I think if I know someone else is distracting the killer.
---
?
---
Leatherdaddy as a new skin please
---
Exactly first get the BP and then help your team
---
OouUuOoo girl, at least luckily for you those are super easy to work on. Easier the are to repair the cheaper
---
against old freddy, when being healed from the dying state you automatically wake up
---
Lol I wish I was a good enough survivor to do this. Instead I get camped on first hook and get T-bagged by Ghostface. Then derank until Rank 16. Have a good day and get all the way 14 or 13. Then the cycle repeats itself.
---
you can avoid that by not getting found, failing a skill check, having someone else wake you up, hiding in a locker...
---
Alrighty, I brought us a bit off track so I'm just gonna bring it on back. I'm not shitting on your play style. You soft patrol, which is different from camping, and play strategically. You're not out to ruin anyone's game at the detriment of your own points. The way you play sounds A-OK to me. My point is that a lot of people who camp do not play this way. Camping is actually very situational and normally only ever works in low ranks. Most campers I've encountered only end up screwing over themselves and the survivor who they are camping in the process. In other words, they are assholes that solely take enjoyment out of ruining another person's experience. 
---
I agree with that argument. It isn't fair that camping prevents a survivor from earning points...but at the same time it isn't fair to prohibit killers from camping as sometimes it really is the best course of action to take. Only the devs can make it fair. I think that a lot of anger is misdirected towards the other side (be it killer/survivor), when really people should be mad at the devs for their shitty point system. I believe that as long as a survivor's team is doing well while they are being camped, they should be getting points for the team's accomplishments. That way assholes will no longer have any reason to camp/people will feel a lot less frustrated when getting camped in general.
---
Are we talking ptb Freddy, Freddy now, or both? I must say, though, that does look pretty good!
---
Agreed!
---
It literally dictated the next decade of slasher films.
---
Sleepy Bois unite!
---
Both it works for either
---
Then worded it really weirdly. Because you made it sound like the killer deserves all 4 kills if he kills off 3 survivor and there are still remaining gens, and that the survivor who finds the hatch should consider themselves lucky. That is true, but they still deserve it if they played well and got screwed over by incompetent survivors.
---
I‚Äôd pay 10 bucks it
---
I mainly play chase centric characters, like Clown. Ruin is usually my main anti-gen perk, BBQ for points, and I jump around with the other two. Usually Brutal or something else that deals with pallets.
---
That's because it only changes who is host. Doesn't change net code nor how interactions play out.
---
So Sirvivors shouldn't see any real effect from dedicated servers. And what effect they do see would likely be worse than current thanks the data chain being longer than p2p. The Killer would have his own lag added on top of the Survivor's lag.
---
Say everyone has a ping of 80. In p2p, that's just 80ms lag for interactions as it is just Survivor to Killer. But in dedicated it is 160 ping in total for interactions. 80ms for Killer to the server then another 80ms for server to Survivor. Totaling 160ms lag for any interaction between 2 players thanks to adding a server to the data chain.
---
Nice build! I like the ones that include bbq and nurses because i feel like they can help boosted killers like myself track people down better :)
---
So we keep playing. They have no rewards for rank 1, nor any reason to stay rank 1, so they just reset it every month to make us work our way back up.
---
I wonder why that's a thing ...
---
Maybe Quentins face is especially punchable - poor thing :c
---
I've heard other players and youtubers say that leatherface is a little underpowered, and i dont seem to be able to play him very well : (. Do you have any tips for him that i can use?
---
lol that's a big brain Spirit right there!
---
I just don't want more licensed stuff until we get a new original chapter.
---
They're most likely to have an unfun playstyle indeed!
---

---
No this week‚Äôs is Wake Up, Bamboozle, Hex The Third Seal, &amp; Deliverance.
---
There aren't only clich√© Megs, also elite ones actually, but lately I encountered more of the first kind.
---
Failing skillchecks without ruin, running around the hook when playing against hag, just sneaking around the hook when the killer (not hag) is far away and you're almost out of struggle time ... The typical memed MegHead.
---
I run bbq, pop, ruin and thanatophobia and once i get to the purple red ranks i change out bbq with corrupt intervention. But thats me...
---
An individual try is 52% as you say (I remember 49%, but may have gotten an up the ante off), but you get 3 tries, which can total out to a high 80s percentage chance to unhook yourself.
---
There‚Äôs still a slight pause when they use the exploit because you have to let the shift button go to get the exploit. I‚Äôve run into 99%s before when I used to main killer. Now I don‚Äôt as much because I just fuck around around as killer or do dailies as killer because the pip system annoys me.
---
&gt;Playing killer takes SO much less skill than survivor it's not even funny.  
---
Wraith, Trapper, Doctor, Clown, Legion, Plague, and Ghostface mains would like to have a word with you
---
Yes it is. A good Billy can make looping hard.
---
Just a single luck offering doubles the chance survivors have almost.  If you take all 3 shots, you go from a 11.5% chance to self-unhook to a 19.5% chance.
---
Remember that many times survivors won't try and unhook themselves if they don't have that luck, so that drives the numbers down a lot that you run into "natural" self unhooks.   But if you have a luck offering or two, they may feel the odds are good enough to bother trying.
---
K.

Ok, good. I wanted to make sure because we reported him and wanted to make sure it was 90% possibility of a lag switch

Oh I knew its not on this weeks, but I swear I saw it on there recently

I‚Äôm about to do what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúpro gamer move‚Äù
---
Imagine caring about this.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm on Xbox and it doesn‚Äôt do that for me
---
No, you did word it weirdly. I didn‚Äôt project anything to it. The first part was you saying how a hatch escape is nothing to brag about, and that is true. 
---
Then you went on to justify the why. 
---
‚ÄúHatch is basically a consolation prize if you get it for getting your asses beat and not being able to finish the gens.‚Äù
---
Again, true, but also situational and doesn‚Äôt apply to the one survivor who played well and did everything I mentioned in my previous post. Nowhere did you exclude that one sole survivor or brought up any exceptions. There are four survivors after all, and everyone has to contribute. 
---
‚ÄúThe killer already killed the other 3 and you happened to get lucky by finding the free escape here tile lol.‚Äù
---
Why the ‚Äúlol‚Äù at the end of your sentence then, hm? What did you deem so funny about it? Because you firmly believe that if all three are already dead, the fourth deserves to die too, regardless of how well they played. And if they find the hatch, they‚Äôre lucky and don‚Äôt deserve to brag. But if they played well, why can‚Äôt they brag? What are you implying then? That the killer gets to brag when he finds the hatch first and kills the final survivor who played well? You DID word it poorly and I‚Äôm not projecting anything. Maybe English isn‚Äôt your first language, but if you want to make provocative statements like that, at least make sure it isn‚Äôt filled with (subtle) implications or at least make sure there isn‚Äôt room for misinterpretation. 
---
‚Äú...it certainly shouldn‚Äôt feel like an accomplishment or anything.‚Äù
---
Again. If the survivor played well, found the hatch before the killer, why can‚Äôt it be considered an accomplishment? They deserved it more than the killer if they performed very well and got screwed by incompetent survivors. And now we‚Äôre going back to my original statement: Not every killer deserves the 4th kill if the final survivor performed well during the trial. Because you‚Äôve mentioned NOTHING about the killer finding the hatch first, initiating EGC and killing off the final survivor. In that case, it certainly shouldn‚Äôt feel like an accomplishment to the killer either. Right? 
---
In addition, the fact you saw the need to downvote my post only goes to show how odious you are and can‚Äôt accept the fact that you worded your statement very poorly and very killer-sided. Makes you really wonder who of us really projects here or is delusional.
---
Perfect game btw
---
It takes a lot of effort to sue Chinese copyright pirates.
---
No I don‚Äôt. Please explain.
---
The wraith always had the wrapped up hooks that you see in autohaven on any map, etcetera for the other two killers and the hooks on their respective maps.
---
A long time ago up until huntress was released I think? You could tell what killer it was just by looking at the hooks, and the hooks would be that of the killers specific map. So if it was a trapper on coldwind there would be the hooks from Macmillan. But now all hooks are map specific
---
Bought Clown on release, levelled for teachables, did adept. Never touched him again other than dailies.
---
Those survivors were toxic, the game should have broke for them not the baby Dwight ü•∫
---
Why cant the devs just let you teleport traps to you? Would save lots of time and they can be recycled like hag's traps.
---
Played only a handful of games since reset as a result on PS4.
---
You simply doubling down on the same bullshit context you inferred into my comment only longer doesn't make you any more right dude.  You are framing this to fit what you want me to have said as opposed to what I did.  I'm over it though.  Please don't type the same thing a third time only longer.
---
Still very killer-sided and still ignorant. Funny how you chose to ignore everything I said even after picking apart your comment. Also, I‚Äôm not your dude. But sure, have it your way. Have a pleasant night.
---
Oh wow, Prestige 1? With Trapper? Must be the best Trapper out there.
---
I have not met a single Killer that has done this. They only do things similar to this at the start of the game when they pretty much give up. I've only seen toxic killers outside of the ones that just give you the win from the start.
---
Nah they're just Halloween decorations lol
---
Yes
---
My response to you...lol I clearly specified all of that. And the original comment was solely about a survivor messaging a killer to brag about a hatch escape nothing more.  Why would I have talked about the other side of the hatch period that had nothing to do with what I said.  This is just getting weird at this point man.  I'm done stop implying shit in others comments.  If you want to say something say it through your message don't apply it to mine lol.  Jesus Christ I can feel myself losing brain cells going in circles with you on this.  Why don't we call it a night.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to teabag back to a survivor when they do it!
---
you are wrong.i clearly got outplayed.
---
It got annoying hearing it all the time even though its good
---
but there was no luck modifier on your unhook progress bar
---
Imagine people caring about things that you don't care about.
---
- Some people like to play super casually - not caring what happens.
---
- Some people like to play semi casually - they play to win. If they lose, then no big deal.
---
- Some people like to play seriously - they play to win. De-pipping means you're "losing" and you're getting worse at the game. Pipping means you're getting better every day and discovering the extent to which you are performing in this activity/exercise
---
I want to see how well I can do in my current favourite hobby. Pipping proves how well I am doing.
---
Why is the way you play DBD better than the way I play DBD?
---
yea. i hope dedicated servers will be out soon .
---
and my arm
---
corrupt intervention would like a word
---
So your solution is to be rude about it now? Yes, very mature. And I did wish you a pleasant night, so why did you decide to come at me again? I clearly have my opinion and you have yours. Your statement is bearing subtle implications and that is my opinion. As long as you comment on here and aren‚Äôt careful about how you word your sentences, I have the freedom to state my opinion. The fact you tried to shut me up by telling me not to add my thoughts or comments to your statements only goes to show how defensive you‚Äôre getting. 
---
Please stop responding before I make you lose all your supposed brain cells. We wouldn‚Äôt want that. Again, have a pleasant night.
---
From my experience, the lag that caused that is due to the killer who is hosting. 
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong tho..
---
Mk X got it, we deserveeeeee it
---
That's not really the problem but okay
---
Lmao Freddy wears nothing other than his signature outfit that we already have.
---
Every time I want to play casual killer I get sweaty tryhard 4-mans and every time I go in sweaty it's laidback survivors
---
yeah, just you.  i played maybe 10 games tonight alone where the last 3 survivors all teabagged their way to the exit, some games had an added blinding flashlight thrown in for extra ‚Äúfun‚Äù
---
&gt;I like your style man
---
Rank up nurse and unlock the teachable it will then appear in all killer bloodwebs over time.
---
There was a submission page on the official DBD forums for the contest.
---
On PS4 I can't even remember when I got a "toxic" survivor. Just because people are a good at the game and have the nerve to... use game mechanics and stun killer with pallet( according to this it's toxic to stun killers with pallets) and extend the chase, that doesn't mean he is toxic, he is just good at the game. And using flashlight isn't toxic either, it's a skill. I wish I could use flashlight effectively.
---
At this point I doubt anyone who doesn't play D tier killers struggles in the game, I "win" probably around 90% of my games, it's a super rare occasion 2 people or more escape when I play the killer, and I main doctor and hag, I couldn't even imagine what win rate god tier spirits and nurses(on PC) have.
---
Same on survivor side, I escape maybe 20% of the time. My record for escapes in a row is 4. It's super rare to get a good team even when you are rank 1.
---
CQ sucks but moments like these make it memorable.
---
I see it now thanks
---
Well, good on you for helping a new player out! One of the reasons players get toxic is cause they are thrown into hell.
---
*laughs in Monitor and Abuse with Scratched Mirror Myers*
---
WHY THE FUCK WAS I ABLE TO GET ADEPT DAVID BEFORE JAKE. WHY IS IT WHEN I PLAY JAKE MY TEAMMATES WONT SAVE ME!!! THREE GAMES IN A ROW ONE HOOKED TO DEATH. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SEND HELP!!!!
---
The hiding in a Locker part is something that no one really says. I always thought Freddy could see you in the dream world so long as you were in that range until recently.
---
Sorry man that was my bad wording. Mori with the new skin
---
I do just fine at Rank 1 Trapper. Not every game with him will result in a 4K and is dependent on if you're going against some SWF. I recommend using just Trapper Bag and Sack together because of how common it is. Along with using Corrupt Intervention and Discordance to force Survivors near areas of non-trapped Gens and you'll have time to retrieve traps in the area of affected by Corrupt Intervention.
---
I agree, good to see that someone has some sense, I play both sides and I just don‚Äôt think any of the killers are so OP it throws off balance of anything, if anything, I think there are far too many unviable killers that high rank players can‚Äôt use at rank 1, and that‚Äôs why these survivor mains see so many spirits, nurse‚Äôs, Billy‚Äôs, etc.
---
Oh, ok thank you!
---
If you think that dedicated servers will fix this, I'm very sorry, but that's incredibly naive.
---
No problem
---
This is the stupidest shit in any fallout game
---
But then, I'll have to wait another 15 minutes for a game...
---
No problem man
---
Of course not. You can‚Äôt perform any action other than recovering when in dying state. Why would one specific item be any different
---
I want Robert England Freddy stuff
---
But trying to be rude but I can't wait for 1.4 million deaths...

What happened after?
---
Started watching FunGoose recently to get better at the game.  As soon as he sees keys/toolboxes in SWF watching him pull out the Nurse/Billy is scary.

---
I'm talking with tombstone piece.
---
hmmm, iam trying to get my Myers to P3 so i'll try to farm it to tier 3 after that
---
I run BBQ, Thanatophobia, Corrupt Intervention, and Surveillance.
---
Theres a lot of super nice people on both sides, they just usuall arent as outspoken as the mean ones :)
---
Yeah. Those games where you get Haddonfield as wraith against a 4 man swf and get completely destroyed, or those games where you play with 3 randoms against a killer running super strong add ons and all everyone dies on 5 gens
---
Thats so adorable and wholesome. I hope he has fun :)
---
you can escape hatch in  the dying state though...
---
Yeah they're actually very fast to open if your in a big map, like I said rng plays a huge part, not only this but if the killer finds the hatch first why SHOULD it be easy, if the killer has killed 3 people, AND found the hatch I think that escape should not be just handed to Survivors, just because they're the last one. If a killer has been demolished by Survivors do you think they should get a free kill just because they did badly? No. It's just people who want a survival horror game easier. Hell I play Survivor AND killer both to red ranks and I don't think it's sided for either role, you get either good rng or bad, I've been Survivor when the gates have spawned right next to each other, and I've had lerys when if you wait for the killer to go to the next gate, it's a free escape. I mean what would you propose? That killers can't close the hatch and we have a 3 year hatch standoff again? No thanks, I'd take a 50/50 chance over a patience game any day.
---
Gotta trap the fuck outta that killer shack then all you need is one survivor down there and the rest is eaaaasssyyy
---
That would piss me off as well, but you didn‚Äôt really do anything during the chase so you would have died in most cases
---
Oh shit, I forgot
---
Nah I understand what he‚Äôs saying but I don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs saying it. Spirit is a very fun character to play so I‚Äôm confused and curious as to why OP doesn‚Äôt like to play her.
---
one time I got 2 rank 2's a rank 7 and a rank 16..I'm a rank 12 killer :( but I got bullied hella hard

k thx

It's all fun and games till I put primer bulb and carb on my bubba with insidious

I'd say 2% for each trap plus 2% decrease given to each individual survivor that's been caught

Whenever I play Wraith (AKA whenever I get the Ninja Wraith combo) I do the same.  All shall learn to fear the Bing-Bong.

Would a) be op b) slow the game down too much c) frustrate the shit out of survivors, and d) be too hard to balance

Nop3
---
Never know though...
---
I can agree with this. Tbh, I hunt down those who are a pain in an ass first to lower the amount of escaped survivors, but they still did wwll
---
We‚Äôll rank 16-20 need the help, all new players are in those ranks, experienced players should be able to adapt once they figure it out.
---
That‚Äôs so sweet
---
You have a choice - invest money or time. DLC will give you 2 characters for $7 (ignoring regional prices and frequent sales).
---
"I have to invest 100 hours" sounds like it's a work for you. Are you not having fun playing the game?
---
Removed for salty after game chat

They changed it with Michael, since he relies on you not knowing who it is, I think.
---
Lmfao thats my lategame clutch build right there... works like a charm unless im a skillcheck potato
---
Invalidating other players actions is not a fun mechanic. Just browse this subreddit for high ping/lag clips. Can you find a single one with "wow, that was a fun moment" title?
---
Yeah I feel like I only have time to place 3 or 4 traps and then I will have to sweat my balls off in late game and slug 3 or even all survivors with STBFL...I'm not tryhard I also wanted to have a fun match too ok :'(
---
Brings me back
---
I do that when I lunge attack lol
---
Would be cool if she looked anything like this in the game, the ingame model is a monster
---
If I get at least 15k without escaping, I‚Äôm ok with it. If i outscore the killer at any time, I fucking won. Period.
---
Reason why i switched killer... P3 huntress for nothing :(
---
Why do people still care to rank up ? You don‚Äôt benefit anything from it... lmao
---
its sad when someone reposts and gets more upvotes than the original poster
---
The matchmaking is dogshit for low ranked players.
---
FUCK SURVIVORS WHO RUN OVER THE HATCH OR TO GENERATORS WHILE THEY'RE IN A CHASE WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON
---
If they tea bag it sucks and you have every right to be annoyed, but if they pallet stun and blind, you can't get mad at them, as they're literally just playing survivor well and correctly.
---
That spirit is not happy...
---
Yeah I can tell lmao
---
Go back to instagram with that language please
---
DbD described on reddit/forums feels nothing like DbD I play. "Mine" is not nearly as toxic as one I read about here.
---
it is not that should not happen in the first place
---
cheap way to get kills. but wtf
---
It does get said over and over. There's a lot of power in survivors abs they have a lot of control over the game. They send messages , get upset, and bm you all the while asking you to pay the way they see as fair. Then you'll get the games which you may lose but the survivors are just good to play against and it makes it all worth it. üòÅ
---
According to the Survivor's rule book for killers yes. Other wise toxic players get offended
---
If a Freddy or a Ghostface carries you to the hatch, he‚Äôs going to do this.  I just expect it so I‚Äôm not annoyed.
---
And now, unless they're close to an exit gate, he's getting 4
---
Anything goes
---
Ah, promoted
---
I don't see this as a "giant flaw". You like the game? A lot? Buy DLC, support devs. Don't feel like it? Grind. Is it too long? Yes? No? Maybe? Who cares? You're still having fun playing characters you got in base game.
---
can give me a link to see that book? xd
---
Scream is one of the most iconic and beloved horror/slasher films ever made, and is still studied today as an amazing example of satire on a genre due to it not being comedy.
---
If you think it‚Äôs bad you didn‚Äôt get the joke.
---
While I‚Äôm not saying that the parent comment wasn‚Äôt an error, your correction is pretty douchy, especially when *one‚Äôs* is a possessive word.
---
*The bug needs removed from one‚Äôs ass*
---
He's gonna be annoying to deal with probably, but he seems fair enough
---
Obviously it would be quite a buff for survivors that would need to be compensated on the killer side...
---
Sure, the focus on the hooks is not really optimal. But if it were focused on the kills, the optimal thing would be to just tunnel suvivors down one by one.
---
Myers: NANI?!?!
---
Oh it's just a meme. Thanks to Samimation on YouTube. If he makes the actual book that would be funny
---
Honestly, that's pretty sad.
---
thanks bro
---
Once I got a message like this calling me a camping ho killer except I was a Survivor and she messaged the wrong person.  I‚Äôm guessing she‚Äôs embarrassed because she won‚Äôt reply at all despite me politely explaining her error.
---
Exactly me, can't make use of broken hatches if I can't aim.
---
Hmm this is what killers complain about though, getting baited?
---
This is what I say to them. Don't play along, keep your focus. Either commit to the chase or commit to map control.
---
You really think survivors are whining that killers aren't 'playing along' when they are trying to distract them?
---
Killers just call them toxic anyway and get upset.
---
Do it
---
The leatherface was not so good lmaoo
---
I actually know if some people who do nothing more than trash talk in games, they have no job, no partner, and little social life outside of playing a couple of games with friends
---
literally perfect xd
---
I thought that's what they did here.
---
What happened then?
---
They are really common from lvl 35 (at least for me) and I don‚Äôt understand why.
---
tHe FuCkInG sWaMp!1!!
---
No seriously, this map has somthing wrong for both killer and survivor.
---
&gt; I said that the grind for a single killer shouldn't take as long as it does 
---
Why do you think you know better than devs?
---
that was actually the sound Ace makes when getting in or out of a locker. All characters do a little grunt
---
Didn't you read the survivor rulebook for killers?
---
THICC
---
Doctor, my favorite build is - Save the best for last, enduring, huntress lullaby and distressing
---
Its a shame that if I try to use him in rank 10 or below I wont stand a chance against a SWF
---
No wonder their only joy stems from shittalking. That's honestly pretty sad and I hope the ones you know get better :/
---
Pig with BBQ, Enduring, Whispers and Monitor&amp;Abuse, no add-ons. Goal is to get a grab, decent Deviousness using dashes at loops, and 4 BBQ stacks. Completing all of those usually means game was fun.
---
Because clown is not a good killer in high rankszso people only get him for the perks and then they leave
---
When playing Legion, I sometimes go in answers instantly out of Frenzy to show that annoyed/raged expression.
---
Yeah man, I agree. Unless you're teabagging, flashlight clicking and pointing at every opportunity, you aren't toxic. Sadly some killers seem to think that looping or running away is toxic. How dare survivors try to stay alive right? By that logic, killer must be toxic for daring to hit them with his weapon.
---
I am a killer main by the way, just adding that before any butthurt users reply to me telling me I don't understand what it's like to play killer. :)
---
Yeah ok thats fsir.if they made it impossible on most maps they should fix it for the rest.
---
Solid e-entertainment.
---
I think its annoying and its just a taunt in general, so it can be considered toxic (unless you are doing ut to avoid a teammate death)
---
üíØ
---
I love this, looks like I have a new phone wallpaper
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Try to think on survivor sides. They just need to escape. They don't need 30k+ to get the adept.
---
I seriously can't decide whether you're trolling or just dumb man
---
I thought I recognized it as Wales too haha, was there in April! :)
---
The amount of people or the map is irrelevant, you shouldn‚Äôt be in the basement with the exit gates power anyway.
---
When those gates turn on all rules are thrown out the window
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty new too and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm embracing it. Sink or swim with the big boys. Except when the killer tunnels you for 3 straight hooks. Than I learn nothing from it lol
---
I'm pretty sure you can get banned for that. Then again I'm a console player so idk what I'm talking about.
---
It would be nice if they could see the thumbs up, at the very least, so that their positive behaviour is reinforced.
---
I don't hand them out like free candy, but if people are being good sports, or stay on through a DC, or if they're a rank 20 who ended up in the wrong part of town, then I'll usually give them their virtual updoot.
---
Ah okay, wording probably needs a tweak :D
---
What's "toxic" about 
---
1. Knowing for a fact that OP had a key 
---
2. Letting them have the hatch.
---
3. Wanting points before just letting them leave? 
---
Go on, I'll wait. ü§î
---
No, the picture is literally saying that this perk is now useful to help find totems faster.
---
Eh, he was hanging around to taunt the killer. He got what's coming for him. 
---
Unless you're trying to save someone else, leave.
---
She had adrenalin and used the key to jump out. Read my reply to the whole post.
---
Why are you wearing Chelsea boots indoors?
---
No one knows when it‚Äôs coming then devs said they are working on it so we just have to wait
---
I love how the endgame collapse makes things a lot more tense
---
I was playing a Freddy this morning that was using him off of an offering, anyways I was looping him for a good 1-2 minutes on a truck before he realized he had to put me in dream state to injure me. I‚Äôm not gonna lie I did the same thing as a Freddy my first time playing him so I felt his pain.
---
Gonna need to downvote cause of emojis eww
---
Standard enduring,spirit furry,bbq,ruin works since you are m1 killer for second hit.
---
You can go for sloppy and thanatophobia if you are sure you can chain those hits, discordance helps with that build too.
---
Amazing..
---
I dont recommend taking moris, they are unfun and expensive.
---
This is some nightmare fuel.
---
RoundedNumbers.jpeg
---
characters or cosmetics is what I use them for I find using them for perks to be wasteful for me anyway
---
Use it for Survivors and Killers that can be unlocked with Shards and then any Licenced Characters perk that appear in the Shrine. Perks cost 2000 Shards from the Shrine but you can get 3 of them and a new Survivor/Killer for 9000.
---
Wht's better? I am sorry I am fairly new, I don't understand much about perks. Any advices will be appreciated.
---
It is a tough one for sure. Good killers with good map pressure generally do OK but if you land a slower killer on one of the big maps it might as well be gg if you don't have ruin or it gets found right away. I hear a lot of people say another objective but again I dunno what that could be.
---
I tried closing the hatch again to see if it was possible and pushed the wrong button.
---
Exactly!
---
I use a time wasting build with thanataphobia, sloppy butcher, nurses calling, and a tracking perk with addons that extend frenzy and slow down mending, but that‚Äôs just me
---
Yes, that wasn't what they did, I'm just curious if it is possible. I don't think there will be more relevant thread to ask this, and I don't feel like making one for a simple game mechanics question.
---
Yea but what about the picture.
---
If you never want to buy a DLC keep 2000 shards on hand for when BBQ is on the shrine. Other than that i'd buy the hag fir ruin and devour and spirit for spirit fury and because she's a great killer overall.
---
Survivors you are good with the perks of the free ones, might keep an eye out for decisive strike if you get tunneled a lot, but i rarely feel the need
---
No because it's not sequential, it's not killer (60ms) then survivor (60ms)
---
agreed.. updated it now , added  some fake lights to highlight Damascus steel patterns on his weapon and got 9:16 aspect ratio this time :P.. im buying that chrome mask ( BVHR can u sneak in an ability to blind survivors if they try to flash light this mask .. you can always say its a bug and disable it if too many complain .. im just leaving it out there .. " rubs hands with evil smile" heheh)
---
It is though...
---
Shut up and take my money
---
I am very guilty of this. Easiest way to have me doing absolutely nothing is to pretend I don‚Äôt exist. Then down me with NOED after following you all game and facecamp.. or Rancor Mori.
---
Hahaha
---
Epic.
---
It makes you wish you could get another game with them so they can see what that actually looks like.
---
Kinda didn‚Äôt have a reason to leave they all were there.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
So true
---
Could have bugged out, I‚Äôve had it happen before.   I‚Äôve also had the bug where I can‚Äôt struggle or heal myself or others. Or he could have just been being a dick.
---
Come Tuesday, totems will be worth about as many bloodpoints as gens, so that might slow the game down bare litt.
---
He started teabagging and taunting as soon as he walked up to me, just being a dick I guess.
---
I came back to this game recently and thought the plague was broken with that laser beam vomit of death and thought she always had it. (Corruption Purge)
---
I'VE STILL YET TO PLAY AGAINST GHOSTFACE LIKE COME ON MY FAV HORROR FRANCHISES KILLER IS FINALLY ADDED AND I'VE SEEN NOTHING
---
Lullaby, fountains, jigsaw boxes, electricity static, dream timer: hold my beer
---
I feel like I lose when I dont escape only when using flashlights. To me those are so precious and feel like a noob for not being able to protect them...
---
Sounds like it, stuff like this is part of the reason I‚Äôve almost completely stopped playing solo.
---
I‚Äôve never played the game in a team, so I‚Äôve put up with a lot of bad team mates, but this was the first really bad teammate that made me flip my shit.
---
Xbox?
---
Yeah
---
it is not. they patched most of the maps so you cant get blocked in the basment they bovisuly forget this one
---
That wasnt letting him get the hatch ... that was giving false hope then it backfiring ... giving the hatch means you not fucking closing it.
---
Good names, but I'd have loved to see "i am baby dwight" to "Baby Dwight" and "Papa Dwight :)" to "Papa Dwight".
---
Inconsistencies when getting matching names really annoy me
---
Its because there was the stygma that only males play video games back in who knows when . Time has pass  , and yet a lot of males have grown up in toxic and sexist environments . That follows the everywhere , including  video games . In their mind  females or gays playing video games is rare , a joke , and voice chat is the first indicator that  you are not a straight male . Put your voice out there , you deserve to play every game like everyone else , they need to learn .

Alll gens were done, and the exit gates are opened. What did you expect him to do? Step aside &amp; let you guys waltz on out the gate? Instead of embarrassing yourself with a rage fit on reddit, you should have just escaped &amp; moved on.
---
I once used i guess mom and ds and still wasnt the obsession, the other survivor was. I was like well ok. In lobby i Saw this survivor had literally no obsession perks though, how does it work?
---
You only get hints when you haven't played against that killer before.
---
What hitboxes
---
Ahhhh adrenaline made them stand up then the key, I thought they used the key from downed. Thanks.
---
Dwight is Love! Dwight is life! Dwightism!
---
Yep. Any time.
---
Maybe not this specific version, but I've thought about a similar concept 2 years ago. What if the killer would have 2 time-travel abilities: the first one would reverse him to a position he was say 2 or 3 seconds ago (good for loops, needs to be very responsive and quick to use, like Tracer) and the second one would reverse him to a position where he was 20-30 seconds ago, optimal for map pressure. This one could take some time to channel, also no idea what a good cooldown would be here, but I think it should be above 30 seconds. Both of these would require quite some skill to use efficiently. 
---
I think this could work extremely well for an at least A-tier killer in DBD.
---
Yo OP when was this taken?
---
Sounds like rabid mice mating üòÇ
---
You may be right. I didn't give them what they came here for.
---
Since DS transfers the obsession when used, it sometimes starts the lobby with someone else as the obsession
---
Me running object and DS
---
Rly ?
---
I had this in all my matches
---
I saw the hint about the spirit so often
---
Imagine a flying P3 Claudette...
---
Playing a lot
---
I‚Äôm imagining the anime girl saying it and it got 10x funnier
---
A smaller buff that might also be nice is if they made it so he can't step in his own traps. That way if people know about his traps he'd at least get shorter loops than the people he's chasing, plus stepping in your own trap mid-chase is very demoralizing.
---
it was never a meme, it was just toxic
---
Whats bm?
---
But only for killer side.
---
As a survivor main, I disagree with this
---
Just because a killer is really powerful doesn‚Äôt mean they need a mega nerf, her addons could use some small tweaks but that‚Äôs about it, calm down with the anti nurse post spam.
---
She‚Äôs defending the ruin leave her alone
---
All other killer except billy and spirit should be buffed instead
---
Nah Seath's place was the Duke Archives but I'm pretty sure Prince Lothric banned Wraith from the Grand Archives as well
---
No wonder nurse is skinny af
---
The Grand Archive scholars were big Seath fanboys, you can't convince me they didn't have Seath vore fanfic
---
Play with higher tier survivors that do gens and go for smart saves
---
Bing bong
---
Nice Silent Hill 1 screenshot :D
---
Like legion, but actually scary!
---
bad manners. bullying, t-bagging, pointing
---
Ist's console. I guess it's harder hitting 360ing people, but yea he sucks.
---
Was gonna comment about butterfly effect but I gotta speed eat this cereal
---
I installed it to see what it was about, when you attack as killer you attack in place and don‚Äôt lunge so you end up chasing one survivor for the entire match
---
Jazz Hands!!!
---
Nurse screeching, chainsaw revving
---
Gotcha
---
There are ways to nerf her without ruining her base power. Still waiting for the addon rework they started talking about like 2 years ago. Also her lunge is stupid and should be shortened to force nurses to actually hit with their blinks
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; Same shitpost spam.
---
I should also mention that she face camped
---
Good ol hair being broken at auras.
---
Increasing gen time would be a bad idea because nobody wants to do gens for 100sec.
---
I‚Äôll change it in a bit so no more people get confused xD
---
It‚Äôs good, but you just gotta remember that even though it has the same concept of dbd, it has its own meta and it‚Äôs balanced on the high tiers. The main difference is that killers are expected to camp or else they will lose, but survivors can very easily rescue from a camping hunter unless the hunter bamboozles you.
---
Awesome!
---
It's like you didn't even read my comment past the first few words.  We literally agree.  Of course Dead Hard isn't that good when you get caught in a bad position, but Dead Hard is the best exhaustion perk in the game by far when used optimally, which is when you use it to get to a pallet or window.
---
It's why every single survivor at red ranks runs Dead Hard, it has no counterplay for the killer near pallets or windows.
---
Its always the megs
---
You just saying that cause you thought people would say no haha
---
...for survivors lol
---
Good ol‚Äô days for sure. Now we just have killer props for the most part.
---
Honestly I expected people to say yes
---
I totally agree, but I feel like they should make all outfits that have been out for like 6 months around half off price for AC and IS. They should also make all these older ones that are only available through AC purchasable through IS. This could be an event that lasts for a weekend and would be nice for the people who save up or don't have much IS or AC.
---
Bombgizzles
---
Very true
---
I love this idea
---
it's only for the first couple of times you face said killer
---
Depends when she did it, was it during the beginning or around when the exit gates were powered?
---
Both
---
Yeah I read that wall of text ;)
---
Damn, not THAT‚Äôs a compliment
---
HAHAHAHA! I've got to try this sometime.  
---
That's actually hilarious.
---
I did my adept ghostface my first game after rank reset. Couldn‚Äôt be bothered to try it at rank 1
---
There should be an addition to the game where survivors have to complete a certain task before starting to work on gens. Ruin could be adjusted to still slow down progress, but maybe not be lit as a hex totem until that particular task has been completed by the survivors. Coming from a survivor main.
---
is it true that ps4s actually sound like jet engines xbox ones barely make any noise
---
It would be cool to add different sounds when he shouts during the mori or when palletstunned with that skin.
---
That pig buff looks great
---
The Spirit could also look very cool as the witch.
---
Main Doctor here. Every time a survivor say something like that I say "I love you to"
---
They usually become even more pissed and I love it
---
I don‚Äôt know but i‚Äôm gonna just leave this comment here so i don‚Äôt lose this post. I need to know too since i have a few dlcs i still need to buy.
---
and it's reasoning like that, that makes it fair.  
---
I usually only bring a mori though if I see 3 or more flashlights  
---
Ebony Mori  
---
I got a few of them on my GF rn.
---
Legit
---
Witness my stand, „ÄåPsycho Killer„Äç!
---
It's on sale right now on PS4 with some of the dlcs also on sale
---
I see another man of culture running Plunderers.
---
I will bait tryhard tunnelers though usually I don't like the attention of the killer
---
When Ash climbs through windows, his clothes make a noise like he is wearing leather and I always assumed it was his man girdle.
---
&gt; I will say this... 
---
From the bottom of my heart...
---
I don‚Äôt think you can get banned for chase music but models will 100% get you banned.
---

Try playing on a Macbook in boot camp. The computer practically levitates from the fan.
---
I've had that happen as Bubba. I decided fuck it and tried chainsawing into the dude. Fucker ran into it and dced instantly.
---
No. I just feel bad for you guys that you‚Äôre so lonely and unloved that you show your aggression and then ask for more attention online. Your real life must be just full of depression, anxiety and no real relationships. You need professional help. Good luck.
---
good job UwU
---
holy shit you just used the N-word!
---
Ah, yeah that‚Äôs a joke, he‚Äôs most likely not a dumb ass, it was for comedic reasons, I actually totally forgot I put that there LOL
---
The trick is to also equip No Mither, most killers can't ignore an insta down
---
Lmao dude I‚Äôve got a boyfriend, have a ton of great friends, am currently in law school and couldn‚Äôt be enjoying life more ü§°
---
Servers don't make you upgrade your internet or buy a decent computer. And no its not just killer side. One shit survivor rig can sandbag everyone's game.
---
Well, still good job.
---
Hopefully they have another sale or you can earn him with free shards (if they don‚Äôt nerf him too much)
---
mfw quentin looks like this in game
---
New phone wallpaper inbound. Fantastic work!
---
Yup, mine sounds like it's about to explode as soon as I boot up the game
---
Wow, you bullied a new player. Goodjob.
---
I run ruin, haunted grounds, BBQ, and thatnophobia. Seems to work great
---
Jeez. Y‚Äôall are really hostile
---
Yes, you are. If you bully baby Nurses, be prepared to be bullied by good Nurses soon.
---
Flashlightsaves used to be so ez years ago now its really tough and almost impossible to make if the killer is looking out for it
---
Dedicated servers will hopefully fix this.
---
So what? NOED! See not hard to say!
---
Thanks dude, and yeah I have conventions coming up soon so I need to save as much money as I can, however I'm slowly working through getting all the DLC when I have spare money :p
---
I did like it when hooks was based on killers instead of maps. It made finding a hook and remembering which killers style was a funny sidegame, It'd also be interesting to see what kind of hooks leatherface and ghostface would have had
---
Bruh she face camped is several times. If she was new she would‚Äôve attacked us
---
ahahahahahah
---
#54/36509
---
Could be an indirect buff to BNP also. Allows you to work on the first generator from the start maybe?
---
i'm also a killer main. before when you could abuse basement stairs i'd only do it to wait out BT, nothing more. would never trap people like that just because i sucked entire game. that's not camping there, that's literally abusing and bming cause none of survivors can even try to do anything.
---
so cute
---
Just why would you waste so much time doing nothing? looks so dumb

fair enough, I just love the animations tbh, but I think the 2 hooks would be nice, and fuck bnp
---
I‚Äôm locking the comments bc y‚Äôall are hostile asf and clearly don‚Äôt like killers getting a taste of their own toxicity
---
Animations all over the place for both the pig and nea here.
---
there is certain sounds(survivor breathing, survivor movement, and other near silent sounds which could affect gameplay) but chase music at least isn't an issue since it would be client side, not server side. They would still have the same chase music but you could have your own.
---
I AGREE.  I'M A NEWB KILLER WHO JUST WANTED TO TRY SURVIVOR.  I'M SORRY I'M NEW.  I'M SORRY I'M FAILING SKILL CHECKS.  BUT TELLING ME TO QUIT DOESN'T HELP.  IF EVERYONE WHO SUCKS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY ARE NEW QUIT, THE PLAYERBASE WOULD DIE, AND THEN THE GAME WOULD DIE.
---
DO THE MATH YOU TOXIC TRASHBAGS!
---
Best rendition of Spirit I have ever seen, great job.
---
it's not about rules. i'm killer main, that's just scummy what he did already being Trapper who can trap the basement and get his fukin kill. but he decided to be complete cunt by bodyblocking unfixed shit. solely because he couldn't get kills entire game because he decided to camp his first downed person instead of spreading pressure by placing traps.
---
Except 90% if survivors who do this overestimate their ability, and do get insta downed, then most insta DC.
---
I wouldn't call Obsidian an indie dev even then, but yeah of course.
---
Yes, and you set a chase music to silence... Just for yourself. Do you not see how this is unfair advantage for you?
---
nah people don't like it when people are dicks to new players
---
He‚Äôs worse than Myers, but bugged so he ends up being Mr. Freedown
---
it's a [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VQCIZ_nWTY)
---
I was hoping you'd recognize it, but I guess it's pretty specific
---
First one is a Nurse, basically
---
Sure, but you're now hiding in a locker and when you come out you'll just be visible to him again.
---
Pretzel. Jack.
---
Then how is BT even an issue? BT and modern DS are literally just there to ensure the survivors get a fair game. I shouldn't have to distract the killer before I go for the save lol, because then they would just be camping.
---
DH can be played around if the killer knows you have it, and at worse it guarantees a pallet or vault. That rarely costs a killer the entire game.
---
Instaheals are broken, I'm not gonna defend those, but dead hard is absolutely fair.
---
That collision has me on the floor in a panic
---
Nah.
---
When you are so toxic that you troll yourself, therefore accidentally being not toxic.
---
Outstanding move.
---
And most of times they are using the brightest skins, like: Nea with pink hair, Feng with blue hair and face mask, etc.
---
I realized pretty early in that two people on my team were a toxic swf yesterday.
---
I kind of was hoping they would die but nah they got out, and tea bagged the gate until EGC was almost over.
---
P3 Claudette‚Äôs that hide all match and have builds like this.
---
1. Hag isn't God awful, she's a top 4 killer.
---
2. Devs buffed totems in the last 2 patches, so people have more reasons to cleanse them, so totems could serve as a secondary objective. But totems are still a optional objective and you can still ignore them, so maybe a secondary mandatory objective would help with gen speed and would make Ruin less required.
---
3. Also, map sizes play a big role, because some maps are just too big to protect gens unless you are playing Nurse, Billy or Spirit ( pretty much the meta killers ). Imagine playing a slow killer like Hag on Rotten Fields or like Huntress on Mother Dwellings, you are probably gonna to lose simply because the map is too big for your killer, so I think some maps should be made lower or gens shouldn't be too spread out on some maps, so you can protect them better.
---
&gt; You don't get any incentive to go after the obsession as the killer 
---
Dying Light? Play With Your Food?
---
Original idea was to emulate Myers' obsession with Laurie, I think. With more and more obsession perks that idea kinda vanished.
---
Some perks reward you for ignoring the obsession, or focusing the obsession entirely.
---
We tried -- He wanted Dwight. He was like "I want to do Dwight but [friend] is already playing him!" and it made us laugh bc like, he thought you could only have one of each üòÇ
---
Nurse can teleport to a place she hasn't been before and control survivor's heading, this killer can't. So he's more predictable than nurse, while still having anti loop potential.
---
He is!! :)
---
Mr. Dwight it's been an honor
---
I was tipped off about ghostface the first time I played against him then again it was the day he was released
---
Good job!
---
Oh man I love doing this.
---
The look on their faces as I close the hatch is supreme.
---
The look on their faces when I carry them to the exit gate instead is even better.
---
Gotcha!
---
Aaah I see now. Sorry about that.
---
You don't seem to understand it either. The problem here is that from the killer's PoV the hatchet landed on the survivor, it's the latter's PoV who makes people believe those hatchets should have never hit, and that's wrong. Dedicated servers will just make those hits connect more clearly from everyone's PoV... but they will still connect, they will still hit you. If anything, it could make the game more inconsistent because now the killer will also be subject to ping more than ever so depending on that it could make the game inconsistent from both sides whereas as now it's mostly... usually I'd say, from a survivor PoV. To the people who believe dedicated servers will turn them into Neo dodging hatchets: You're wrong.
---
I would love to use these. But do you still get banned for using these?
---
It turns into some straight Persona 4 shit for the Mori and they just shove you into the TV on their bodies and laugh. 
---
Also the Entity can have the happy face of a child.
---
It's totally ok to use the blue hair! I personally like it (although I dont have it). Just don't be rude and everything is good already.
---
Ok so that‚Äôs hurtful
---
Oh so this is why the pig skin is more expensive than the others
---
I personally much prefer playing Hag to playing Leatherface. The former I actually had a lot of fun with, the latter I just play survivor or my Pig main and occasionally throw points into LF to one day get BBQ.
---
Broken controller. Broken game. Broken players.
---
Heh fair enough. Make your bed btw you filthy animal üòÜ

Add it up one week before rank reset. First week after reset I can bully rank 12 killers too, but when you back to your rank(if you don't derank to feel better about yourself) true numbers will show up.
---
TBH i wish maps had different looking lockers so they fit the theme of the map better.
---
I'll take a swing at them like the pesky flies they are and continue on my way. Follow me and waste your flashlight on my back Meg, I'll get to you eventually
---
I literally did this the other day except I'd been having constant awful games as survivor.
---
Spirit prayer beads, omega blink nurses, insta-chain saw
---
Mori on all three
---
so I went into a killer game, put on all the most dickhead perks I could think of, put on a mori and let off some stress.
---
Hey I was rooting around to find stuff üòÇ It isn't as bad as it looks üëÄüòÇ
---
I saw him write that down aftrwards lol, ‚Äúneed to do this later‚Äù
---
They really are the worst and really kill my enjoyment of the game. If I end up with non-toxic survivors, it's an absolute blast but more and more it's just shitty people being shitty.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying lol. How can he report something like that?
---
As a killer you easily get 20k even for a bad game. As a survivor if you get 20k and don't escape it means you put in some fucking work and might think you deserved to escape. That's why I get mad for not escaping sometimes.
---
Also the goal of the game is to escape, not escaping is losing the game by definition.
---
Yep, always nice to have some type of exhaustion perk
---
Only a few times have I fallen to the collapse. But there was this one time where I ran out of time just before I escaped. I was ABSOLUTELY LIVID when that happened.
---
Did not know that, i only recently started playing dbd, mostly have been just playing spirit and trapper, just bought michael and leatherface but havent even tried michael yet
---
He said it was done on purpose to troll which is stupid considering end game would kill regardless.
---
it really makes no sense though, it‚Äôs only this game that seems to run shitty
---
I'm not bullying anyone, my survival rate is 37% which means I die 63% of the time  and those were all r11-6 matches
---
Wait it's 7 seconds? Wow. I didn't even know it took this long
---
Dead hard makes you immune to damage while dashing.
---
Just playing Michael for a daily and I get a 4 man swf who brings a white ward and a Lampkin Lane offering. Then they leave behind their friend to die on hook. Ffs
---
I can tell you the only time I camp or tunnel nowadays is when some asshole teabags the entire chase and clicks the flashlight, etc. Once I see I'm playing with those kind of people, I do whatever I can to make sure they're dead and out of the game.
---
I even have one of those little cooling stands with the fans on?

STILL LIKE AN F16 ON TAKE OFF

---
Sadly the good games are getting fewer and fewer lately.
---
I feel you it‚Äôs a pain but I‚Äôm gonna keep going only a few killers left then I‚Äôll have every adept done
---
Spirit is the second best killer in the game and isn't nowhere near as hard as Nurse, you just have to get used to follow sounds rather than scratch marks (if the survivors have Iron Will, however, it's a gamble everytime you use her ability).
---
Ghost Face, on the other hand, can be really lethal against unexperienced survivors that don't know how to take him out of his power or to loop properly. 
---
However, he's basically a normal M1 killer if survivors know what they are doing or are running some hard counters to his stealth ability (Object of Obsession, Spine Chill).
---
Personally, I would suggest to use some easier killers first to have a general idea on where survivors usually go and how they usually loop, then I would buy Spirit.
---
Dead hard makes you immune to damage while dashing. He would have been hit if he didn't use or have it.
---
It's because they're not face to face with you so there's no backlash if they say vulgar things. And a lot of kids are on these games who have no respect for anyone.
---
This match was extremely fun, the killer wasn't toxic at all, The Pig (even though they closed the hatch on me) made the match really fun, I was enjoying it because of the cosmetics that came out with her, and because she wasn't being toxic before they close the hatch and after they closed it
---
Reverse friendly fire, try it out
---
Once kill, no more kill
---
Yeah, the starting time is 7 seconds! Apparently he was great when he first came out, but the devs nerfed him cause of rank 20 players, and then he‚Äôs been not so good since. Every time I play him I use the add-ons that reduce the time. So had they just lowered this it would‚Äôve helped him so much. I love being able to track people you put to sleep, so I‚Äôm gonna miss it.
---
*heavy breathing* 
---
*heavy breathing in gratitude*
---
Sometimes it really feels that way playing killer, as if they're expecting to be able to bully you the way they can with AI enemies in rpgs.
---
Yeah, I believe trapper‚Äôs was all broken, wraith‚Äôs was wrapped in cloth, I don‚Äôt remember Billy‚Äôs but nurse‚Äôs was some sort of green metal.
---
Everyone is a cunt and that‚Äôs that
---
Wow. What an ass. I hate people who do that. I just don't get why you have to be a prick.
---
God I hate emojis too
---
There are a few single players games that run crappy on Xbox like just cause 3 but I've never had a multiplayer game run crappy. And dbd runs basically perfectly on my old Xbox one. I've always found that PlayStation has been better for single player games while Xbox is better for multiplayer games.
---
Ghostface‚Äôs hooks disappear if you look at them
---
I love playing insidious Leatherface for jumpscares, I play too much survivor to where I can never camp without feeling great shame. 
---
This guy camped you on Haddonfield of all places, the best map to use Jumpscare Leatherface.
---
The trick to it is once you see the survivor do it once, bait out another and wait it out. Works 90% of the time.
---
I haven‚Äôt had any other multiplayer games run poorly though, I‚Äôve barely played solo games
---
The new Freddy can teleport to generators, fake teleporting to generators. He has actual map pressure and even better mindgame potential than before. 
---
And he doesn‚Äôt have to wait to hit people anymore, and hitting people instantly puts them in the dream world.
---
Will the Snares and dream pallets have counterplay? Probably, but their much stronger and more fun powers than the riveting hold l2 and wait to hit people gameplay he has now.
---
Lmao üòÇüòÇ
---
Nicee!
---
I‚Äôm making a full PDF rule book of dumb survivor rules, feel free to shoot me things to put in it.

You mean Entity mains, i guess...

Honest question can someone explain RNG to me. I see it so often but have never seen a definition.

EXPOSED üíÄ
---
Poor Leatherface. Dude was just chilling in his home when David invades his home and tried to start up dangerous heavy machinery and steal his property in his chests
---
I think they should reduce prices for less-bought skins, at least. Like a sale, I mean
---
Wait what makes it so you can‚Äôt loop a hag but you can a billy? Billy practically ignores pallets and has a faster movement speed
---
I'm super jealous that you can 360 like that on console I always get stuck mid rotation. But good use of dead hard and nice escape I was worried insanity wouldn't let you use the key
---
Would have went with this one instead:
---
https://i.imgflip.com/2l3xgs.jpg
---
This is why killers are hated even for those who are non toxic suvivors
---
No offense but that would place in the 1% of players that think Hag is second to worst...and these are just players that have either never used her, or don‚Äôt know how. After Nurse, Spirit, Billy...Hag is usually ranked in the next one or two slots. On console, Hag is certainly a top 4 killer because of the difference in Nurse on console vs PC.
---
You see this all the time if you‚Äôve played enough.
---
Really doubt that happened...
---
I thought we already lost after the first 2 people got hooked early in the game but somehow we managed to pull through.  Then towards the end, this David did an awesome Dead Hard against chainsawing Billy.
---
If you have agitation it's really fun to carry them and chase people with them. Sorry but I can't help it when I see a chance to meme
---
Alright, i'll do it then, i just wanted someone else's opinions, appreciate it mate
---
Alright, thanks
---
It's 2019 and we can't have a good server system yet. I wonder if anything will be truly solved in September or they'll release a backwash version of a server system. I can't wait.
---
Ya flexed when you showed the totally accidental p2 ghostface
---
Another thing that's good about it is that even when you are exhausted you still won't stagger when you drop so it's like an added little bonus
---
Got it :D
---
Why not both?
---
I‚Äôve only noticed this on the main menu before you enter the campfire screen.
---
I once stepped into a trap and started to try to escape. Trapper came to me and stood near to see the show. I tried 36 times before he grabbed me up tired of waiting. He had no add ons.
---
Nice. Lol one time me and my friends all brought in Salty Lips and we ended up against a Pig. My friends were having a blast, getting traps off the first time, one even Kobe'd. And then there was me, wasted my escape attempts and ended up dying running to my fifth and last jigsaw box while my friends escaped.
---
Feels bad man. Just had a game where i got trapped 6 times because i was looping and escaped first time every time.
---
Damn that was close ! gg
---
Area 51 map?
---
In P2P There is still a back and forth for survivor packets which would still be 80ms up and 80ms down. you're still favoring the killer no matter what connection they have and that's what this is going to fix. Killer will no longer be able to lag and have an advantage.
---
Packets (hopefully) won't be lost from survivor to server any more which eliminates teleporting, rubberbanding, and "fix hitbox" complaints because you and the killer will be seeing the same thing.
---
Believe me, you do not know how much I share this feeling with you. Also, unrelated, but somehow, out of the 7 or so games I played with no mither, I survived all but one, only one of which was a hatch escape, and more than half of which I never was hit. Remember, no mither causes the broken status for the entire trial, meaning you are injured if not already, and can't be healed to healthy, but makes you not leave blood trails, makes your groans of pain quieter, makes perks like resilience always active, since you're injured, and allows you to always fully self recover when downed. Either I perform really well when I'm down in one hit, or I just got lucky.
---
*living in Australia intensifies*
---
Yes it was , thanks bro
---
Was that Meg or Phoebe Buffae?
---
Is pharmacy useful? I figured self care is better
---
I just started playing a week ago. I thought you always got out first try?
---
That's never happened to me period.
---
Love moments like these :')
---
The usual. Adrenaline, self care and other exhaustion perk of your choosing.
---
Here comes the trapper..
---
I submitted a ticket on support.deadbydaylight.com (2nd time I submit a ticket for cheating), I'm all ear if you have a better way.
---
I keep tabs on the cheater's steam profile and he has not gotten a game ban yet (I just hope he eventually does...)
---
How you bait it?
---
I don't think you're understanding my explanation, we're saying the same thing.
---
Is that leatheeface camping the window with insidious?
---
Prestige 3.
---
I would love to. But my huntress is level 5 and I cant justify grinding her out when I dislike playing her so much
---
Prestige 3
---
Yeah i know that, thanks
---
I'd rather have bond or decisive than self care tbh.
---
I‚Äôve tried to play without self care. It gives me anxiety lmao. But yeah, you can always use bond to get someone to heal you good point
---
Say you want to dodge a hatchet like in the clip.
---
In p2p, the Killer readies a hatchet to toss and it takes 80ms for a Survivor to see it. Then the Survivor can react to that and hopefully predict when the hatchet is tossed. But when the Killer does take that throw, it still takes 80ms for the Survivor to get that data. Ending with the posted clip of being hit where you just walked away from.
---
In a server, when a Killer readies a hatchet. It takes 80ms for that data to reach the server, then another 80ms for that data to reach a Survivor. By the time a Survivor can even react to a hatchet being raised up, 160ms has already passed. And when the hatchet is tossed, it takes 80ms for that data to get to the server. Hitting the server's last known location of that Survivor 80ms behind their current location. Ending in having even less time to react to anything but the exact same, if not worse, dodgy hits landed thanks to adding longer data chains.
---
Look at it this way. If you are talking to someone directly face to face (Lan), communication is near instant. If by phone (p2p), communication has a minor delay. But if you talk by using a 3rd person as a middle man, communication takes MUCH longer.
---
Adding a longer data chain will only make things worse for everyone. More so in melee focused gameplay when inches of ground makes or breaks a play.
---
LOL I WAS JK GOTCHA BIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH! B)
---
U should hit someone with ur ability and look around u and see if u can see anyone else, do this till everyone is in mending state or if u hit someone and u see no one near by just take the last one u hit. U should get thanathopia (idk how to type this) its pretty good with legion
---
Yes, definitely. I made the same swap a while back and it helped a lot. Not running Urban will force you to be chased more, and Balanced will help you in chases. You‚Äôll become a better survivor and have more fun :)
---
That's right!
---
No shit, but he used it as a plural.
---
Want me to list every possible correct use of 's next time?
---
I don‚Äôt think theres groups if ypu look on looking for group on xbox some people are willing to help newer players however theyre usually higher ranks like 1-7.
---
Nothing like a 1.9 star rated game
---
Fuck,  i forgot.
---
Wait death is not an escape
---
I only have 3 trophies left to get to platinum the original set. And they‚Äôre all nurse ones. The one killer that sucks on console
---
How Billy ignores pallets ? He is very weak against looping actually, he even can't use his chainsaw around windows and survivors can always avoid his curves, while Hag can trap loops and choke points which makes looping impossible, because you can't ignore traps unless you are crouching, but crouching won't gonna help you when you are chased by The Hag. Plus, there are some mind games you can play with the Phantasm Trap, but you need to understand how to play Hag first.
---
Use borrowed time, self care, and the rest is up to you. I feel borrowed is a must at any rank against any killer. Self care so you don‚Äôt have to waist time getting a team mate to heal you, and most other perks are just for what suits you best.
---
It‚Äôs always the Pig with terrible connection
---
I do agree that it is scumming however as long as he's not holding the game hostage I can't actively put any hate towards them.
---
The strategy is scummy as hell but if it works it works
---
I‚Äôve found there to be a pretty decent split between the two groups tbh.
---
I‚Äôve played hag and I absolutely hate it, but I was not aware she was this good
---
 I‚Äôll look more into it
---
No you can stab someone who's on the hook as many times as you want in frenzy, I haven't done it but you can
---
Oh you must be in rank6+ on ps4, everyone has Franklin's there
---
Fair enough I‚Äôll look into hag see what‚Äôs the big Whoopie. I hate hag so much but I‚Äôll look into it
---
Prestige 3, the highest level of Prestige possible.
---
You see, the Bloodweb stops gaining new levels once you hit Level 50. 
---
You now have a choice of resetting, losing all progress but gaining a cosmetic and slightly better chances at higher rarities or, like me, keep on consuming the Level 50 Bloodweb.
---
I mean just as a matter of caution I literally will not go back into the basement to save somebody if the basement has a blockable doorway

---
Ah okay
---
It literally is a combination of hitboxes, the way lag compensation works AND lastly the fact it's running on a shitty P2P system. Feel free to watch some of 4Gamers' cancerous DbD funny moments, you can see instances of people sitting on gens (behind the gen) and an axe comes flying, hits the air and the guy gets hit. No movement whatsoever.
---
BHVR tried out dedicated servers in the PTB and it failed. Go and look at gameplay of TF2 with projectiles like the guillotine. TF2 adds an additional 100ms of latency to your end and most of the time you're gonna sit at 40-80 ping on EU servers. It's still far better than what we have in DbD as of right now.
---
"Granted there can still be latency with servers, but it doesn't change the fact that this has nothing to do with hitboxes."
---
You're a moron.
---
Oh fuck i looked at him... He's powerless now
---
Been happening since 2017, might have to do with host connection; same way as sometimes you can‚Äôt wiggle or recover due to host.
---
It would be great if it's passive ability would be "you'll be matched with survivors under rank 10"
---
It's a sign that you should change...
---
Wouldn't self care as an extension of your statement be a bigger waste of time? A teammate healing you is 1/2 of the time.

Basically its the process for random chances. It stands for random number generator. My best guess is it has parameters in which it will pick a random number like 1-100. So for a 25%chance to be free from a trap, you would get freed when the rng picks 1-25 on the attempt.

Maybe failing a box puts you in the injured state, failing 2 puts you in deep wounds, and failing 3 downs you
---
0/10, doesn't look like a crack fiend.
---
Just kidding, looks pretty awesome, the hair especially is pretty on point.
---
Mine remains super quiet until I've put alot of time into playing it. But normally once it starts getting loud I put it into sleep mode for a minute or 2 and its quiet again.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 so that might be the difference.
---
Anyways, thank you mate
---
***Sounds of distant bing bonging***
---
Wind's howling
---
Thanks so much :D The hair was actually the thing that was giving me the most hassle üòÇ
---
&gt; A teammate healing you is 1/2 of the time.
---
Also waste the time of 2 people instead of 1. In addition to the time it takes you to find someone.
---
i almost want to steal this and turn it into a discord emote but i won't do that!
---
I ain‚Äôt mean! I be a legion main everyday!
---
Thanks
---
Love the console Freddy main that downvoted you üòÇ evened it out for ya
---
Yeah, hair (wig or otherwise) tends to be temperamental as shit in cosplay.
---
NANI!?!
---
While Dwight  was also being a bit of an ass by just staying around as he clearly wanted the killer to see him leave.
---
Considering he wasn't actively spamming the toxic notifications. I am a bit sad that he died instead of Claudette and Meg
---
It was a video I found on r/funnyvideos but it wasn‚Äôt captioned or related to dbd so I was like why not

God I would prefer going against a nurse than a doctor

Are you counting adrenaline as an exhaustion perk or memeing?
---
Outplayed? I guess that pig just had a better gaming chair.
---
Lol I just googled for a PNG of ghostface on a transparent background and that one came up. Then I googled images of creepy tunnels and made the font look like Farming Simulator and combined everything xD
---
thx for starting my day off good
---
I'm using this wig for Grover Underwood as well, but I dont want to put any hairspray or anything in it cause it flows so naturally üòÇ That's why I'm glad I just use my own buzzcut for cosplays like Dwight or Markus from Detroit become human üòÇ
---
Because nobody plays the Clown
---
UE is arguably the biggest placebo and BL is inarguably one of the best perks in the game, so yeh I'd say so.
---
Btw, this guide is outdated, it was made before The Hag buff and add-on rework, so the part with add-ons isn't valid today ( now her distance teleport and Phatasm Trap duration time are her best add-ons ). But the trips on how to play Hag from this guide are valid even today.
---
Clown and Legion also have their own music, as well as Myers when you select him. Plague also has different music
---
Goddamn no body blocks either lol rough.
---
original ps4's are basically nuclear reactors. playstation pro doesn't have this problem
---
Nani
---
Bruh, more like two minutes.
---
I get it, Hag is not the traditional type killer so at first glance it‚Äôs ‚Äúugh why is she so slow! This is stupid, she sucks!‚Äù You just have to learn how to use the traps. If you become good with them, she‚Äôs pretty deadly. A lot of bad hags use her to power to camp more or less (placing like 8 traps at the hook lol), not the way you wanna play it!
---
Photos of the pin?
---
Is it worth throwing your game away just because he got under your skin?
---
As a solo main, I agree
---
If that was the case what would be the point of placing traps?
---
Those teammates can be doing a gen while you heal. If a teammate or 2 is near you, then great! But if not then you can heal yourself instead of looking for a teammate to heal you, waisting time that could be done doing a gen.
---
I AM MORE SAD THAN ENRAGED BUT WHATEVER. LIKE NINE MONTHS AGO THIS SWF TEAM WAS BEING ALL FLASHLIGHT TYPICAL SHENANIGANS WHICH EVERY OTHER TIME WAS AWFUL. THEY DID IT SO WELL I WAS NOT MAD AND JUST IMPRESSED. IT WAS TRULY AMAZING TEAMWORK TO THE POINT ALL OF THE BODYBLOCKING AND FLASHLIGHTING WAS NOT EVEN RAGE INDUCING AND I DIDNT MESSAGE THEM TELLING THEM THAT. I HAVE PLAYED A LOT OF GAMES AND HAVE NEVER AGAIN SEEN A TEAM THAT WAS NAVY SEAL LEVEL OF FLAWLESS. SO I AM MAD I DID NOT MESSAGE THEM TO TELL THEM THEY WERE SO IMPRESSIVE THAT THEIR TOXIC SLUDGE FROZE INTO A BEAUTIFUL STATUE OF DAVID
---
People who taunt a Myers at the gate really piss me off. Give him all the stalk for tier 3 for people who aren't safe yet. It's just really dumb
---
You get info.
---
3rd to the right Calm Spirit. You dont alert crows while walking/running and you dont scream to doctor shocks or clown bottles at rank 3
---
4th to the right Distortion. You have 3 tokens. If your aura would be revealed (Bbq&amp;chili, nurse‚Äôs calling, etc) it consumes a token. Your aura isnt revealed and you dont leave scratch marks for 6 seconds
---
Calm spirit is a Jake perk and distortion is a Jeff perk
---
Hes not saying how the perks are similar, he means how good the perks are for both sides. Then similarity here is that they are both really op perks (before the DS nerf)
---
Mine doesnt make any sound.. everyone's ps4 must be old or something
---
That's a wig my dude, I have a buzz cut underneath that mop üòÇ
---
Is it just me or did he scream owo at end
---
Stack people as much as you can with your frenzy hits. Use add-on that increase your frenzy time or increase their mending time. Don't launch frenzy hits too easily, as survivors will often try to 360 you. Wait near them while they're spinning if you're not sure to hit them until you find the opportiny to get a stab.
---
When you frenzy stab someone go for the others, as hitting a dude twice is useless; while you are chasing one survivor the others lacks of you pressure and can just gen rush the shit out of you. Use Ruin to slow the game, Thanatophobia and Sloppy Butcher so their action speed is limited and they are forced to heal slower. Then use Barbecue and Chili ( mostly for the blood points so you can upgrade your Legion fast ) or Save the best for last ( as you use Feral Frenzy this perk gains a lot of stacks really quickly and helps you getting fast hits and hooks ). These 4 perks really synergise well together and with the killer, and allow you to become much more effective in chase, kepping surviror off generators and having more people injured at a time. Lastly, this is a general killer tip: never commit in a too long chase. Look for the Survivor and test him. If he's a good looper and you have difficulties catching this one, I promise you, you don't wanna lose your time on one dude while the others are comfortably completing the objectives. It is FINE leaving one Survivor, if it allows you to keep the pressure on the others. I was like that before and couldn't afford to let escape that one bitch that maked fun of me the entire game, but everyone escaped in a short time as a result. Now I prefer going for different targets if i found the Survivor I loop being too difficult to chase. I main Legion and Pig at red ranks on PS4 and I promise you, playing killer will become stressful and unfunny, but with experience you'll learn how to stop loops and to mind game Survivors to re-equillibrate the balance ;) Good luck with legion!
---
I hate that.. I always yell hes camping get at least 3 gens done and then come save me with borrowed time I still have my D to give them haha.
---
When the killer hits the survivor on hook, I totally think that too.
---
The challenge is now renamed "The infuriation"
---
Ohh lmao well that's a nice wig lmaoo.. hahaha buzz would probably be better also Haha
---
Yassss, I crack up!!
---
The fuck was the point of you commenting then?
---
Tuesday.
---
I think he's being serious. Dead Hard as the best exhaustion perk which would make Balanced Landing the second best
---
Naturally, I'm counting Adrenaline as an exhaustion perk.
---
Tbh I used to have hair similar to that, but buzzing it all is just so much easier üòÇ
---
I understood that reference
---
I must admit, as survivor, there's nothing I love more then a perfect rescue from a camper. 
---
As killer, it's the same, 'cept I usually mess it up, so they all die
---
Borrowed time only works in killer‚Äôs Terror Radius, so there are ways around that.
---
I literally go into every game assuming I'm going to die so that way if we escape I'm pleasantly surprised. People take the game too seriously and get overly mad for nothing really.
---
You should refrain from saying things that merely seems sarcastic.
---
Well you‚Äôre a Claudette with self care. You probably were hiding in the corner. Do a gen or unhook.
---
I would never put it on the same level as Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween, as those movies really popularized the genre. But the deal with Scream is that it was quite literally the trend setter for next 10 years (until we hit the age of reboots). Look at all the slashers that came out after, and notice how most of them took that meta style of Scream. The Chucky movies, Friday the 13th movies, and especially H20 are great examples of this.
---
*picks leatherface with FD and, just in case, noed* (and also because its my only killer above lvl20 except trapper)
---
Guess I'll snowball then
---
See mine stays pretty cool and quiet. But a few of the people I play with have the jet engine problem. It‚Äôs like hit or miss it seems.
---
And this is why survivors get a bad rep.
---
I‚Äôve pulled off lots of camper saves, usually you need at least 2 people to take a hit so everyone can run.
---
Hmm no I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it, chief.
---
Do you have self care and play her? Yup. That‚Äôs it. Do gens
---
He said all the hooks would be one killer‚Äôs
---
I use self care because my experience with people on this game is players don‚Äôt tend to heal their teammates. Self care exists for a reason. Equipping it doesn‚Äôt automatically make me a passive player.
---
Making a bigger hole in the head for her massive dick
---
I did but it got removed. Sorry.
---
That is not a fact. Nurse is generally accepted as the better killer, and she is more popular. You arent a red rank player huh?
---
When I first started playing killer I realized there would hardly be anything to complain about if people were mature enough not to let teabagging and clicking get to them.
---
Are you 13?
---
Emerald Herald x Covetous Demon vore
---
haha people trying to have fun haha
---
I feel like the last should be capitalized as it gets more aggressive
---
fuck thanks
---
How original, you win a prize.
---
Just wait a second. The survivor was able to successfully 360 multiple times because he predicted the killer would swing again the moment his cooldown was up. All the Doc had to do was not swing immediately after his cooldown.
---
it wasnt pushed back king crimson skipped it
---
Oh yeah, totally worth it.
---
Cloaked wraith, crouching piggy, shrouded ghostface or even anyone with insidious can cancel out BT.
---
Eh he‚Äôs just a shit killer
---
That's a really long sentence. Please don't do that.
---
Lol if it said ‚Äúrancor when last survivor is the obsession‚Äù I would have laughed more tho
---
I definitely don't remember
---
LOL! SADLY TRUE.
---
That‚Äôs so nice of him.
---
Leatherface ain‚Äôt that bad, perhaps you should git gud?
---
If you want to get better at facing loops, pick up Enduring from Hillbilly (teachable at level 30) and Spirit Fury from.. well Spirit of course (teachable at level 30 as well) The combo makes it so you can really swing through pallets without caring as much about the stun, though I would really highly recommend Enduring first, since Spirit Fury is really only worth it when you already have Enduring (and also Hillbilly is a free Killer, so you don't have to buy the Spirit DLC just for the perk if you don't want to) When you have Enduring, just swing through pallets that you think you can land hits on and don't respect them and be afraid of the stun. You can land some hits that you maybe shouldn't actually be able to, because no dedicated servers and DbD hitbox fuckery.
---
If you need to slow the game down, you're probably going to want to pick up Hex: Ruin from the Hag (teachable at level 35) it's the best game for slowing down Generator progress, even if it is really RNG dependent.
---
If you want a more in-depth guide for all things Legion, I make videos on YouTube about Killers and I can link you the Legion one if you want. I don't want to just straight out of the gate self-promote, so I'll link it only if its something you feel like you want to check out. (Fair warning: it is a like 34 minute video, so it can be a lot to watch if you don't have a lot of spare time.)
---
13h of menu 1h of pnzpnz
---
LOL,  I just ordered one of those to see if it would make a difference...
---
I‚Äôm not saying this wasn‚Äôt a good use of deadhard but I had to skip through 10 minutes of gameplay just to see this mind blowing moment and it was a letdown. 
---
I was expecting some hook save BT EGC play, or some epic beartrap dodge baiting trapper into a selftrap. Even DH‚Äôing an Unexpected spirit phase attack, Nurse teleport, Pig ambush, Corrupt vomit would have been more epic.
---
Simply put the hillbilly didn‚Äôt even have to be revving his chainsaw. Had he not been, he could‚Äôve baited it and made it significantly more exciting.
---
Approved
---
I think the menu sounds themselves need an overhaul, the sounds come off like theyre from an xbox 1 game menu
---
Link it up my friend! Appreciate it!
---
The only killer allowed to use NOED is old Freddy (bless his heart). Also, it is the killers adrenaline. The killers DS imo is a Mori, because you were supposed to have another chance of living after being hooked. With DS you were supposed to have another chance of hooking then after the save
---
The joke is based of the Dead by daylight parody it's mocking entitled people.

It happened to me once and i kept going where the map falls off and it teleported me to the killer shack
---
Weird! Maybe it's a new feature? Or maybe it's a knew "" feature"" (bug)
---
It's so weird. Saminations parody videos always get less than 500 upvotes, but still everybody knows about these videos.
---
I don't know how long you've been playing, but some of that has been due to change in mechanics as well. Instablinds were ridiculously broken.

That‚Äôs why you stay in the ranks with those guys I guess.

Poor Philip just can't catch a break :(
---
I barely get to play for an hour a night but mine hasn't made any noise besides that darn start up sound that wakes my family up.
---
Just straight up increasing Generator repair times would really fuck over mostly lower ranks where they aren't as proficient at looping the Killer while the rest of the team works on Generators, and they might even be missing Skill Checks here and there, regressing their own Generators. So just flat increasing Gen time would probably just make newer players quit the game which is bad for the game's overall health and growth.
---
At higher ranks, you might see a bit of a slowdown of the game, but given that a lot of experienced Survivors can hit Great Skill Checks a fair amount of the time, it wouldn't really mean that much to them.
---
I'm not sure what exactly BHVR can do to remedy the issue of Generators feeling like they get knocked out super quickly at higher ranks. I think the suggestion of alternative objectives is a nice one, but we already have totems and barely anyone even bothers because the extra BP isn't really worth it when you get 5k BP from just walking out the exit gates. When a lion's share of Survivors BP comes from surviving and exiting, Survivors are always going to want to... well, survive and exit.
---
They did mess around with the idea of alternative objectives with a few of the events in recent years, but even then people would slam out the Generators, and then grab some of the extra BP objectives before they left, so it didn't really solve the issue that much.
---
I'm sure BHVR is internally testing (please I hope to god they are) some way to balance the game to be less of a "just do the Gens and leave" style of play, but it isn't really something they can just slap a quick numbers change on and call it a day. It's (probably) going to require a big overhaul of the game's systems and the way the game plays out at the moment.
---
Cause if I see you I'm gonna down you. Just cause you got a trap on your head dont mean imma let you slide.
---
The camping however you lost me on.
---
Holy crap that was insane! How did he not see you?!
---
His stealth/stalk mode is canceled if you look at him for a few seconds
---
Sounds like you just don't like people disagreeing with you
---
Actually he is. Maybe you should just stop being mean?
---
If the trap is inactive, you're fair game. If it's active and I see you on a box, ill chase you away and hit you if possible, then go back to my own things. 
---
It's just how some piggys play, they're still young they'll figure it out eventually.
---
Trapper was the same as billy with like wired wrapped around it, billys was a naked metal pole.
---
Checking up on me? Maybe it‚Äôs time we check up  on him

r/wooosh?
---
i played a game last night and got 1 kill.  3 of em were escaping.  2 left, the 3rd decided to tbag at the gate.   now, i dont know why he decided to do that.   we had a nice game overall, i could've done better but i got some bp, i got 1 kill not bad.   
---
so he gets stuck...he cant leave.   now, normally i would just move aside and let them try to get out the other gate or the hatch (had this happen in another game last night and he got to the hatch)  but i decided  that karma served him right and he died somewhere in the distance.

Oh no, boo hoo my fragile sense of pride has been shattered, what ever shall I do? Look, it‚Äôs a game. There are better things to argue about then how people want to treat certain behaviours.
---
Same, though I tend to just slug you to delay you and hopefully get the trap to activate.
---
why? who would want this?
---
idk im just playing to stab mfs
---
Jake
---
Would have required them to recode that interaction so a killer could grab a downed survivor even while they were being healed, which would be a (fairly minor) indirect buff to all killers, for the sake of a character that was pretty much scheduled for a rework from release.
---
The bigger issue is really that the rework took so god damn long.

Everyone whining about the meme is a def cunt as survivor and has had this happen to them so they‚Äôre taking it out on OP. For shame, it says in the Survivor Handbook by Killers that-
---
Oh cool. It‚Äôll be up and running in no time, don‚Äôt worry.
---
The exhaustion and mangled addons are completely pointless. Also missed attack cooldown reduction on the current video tape is really useful, I wouldn't like it to be changed.  
---
I'd make the current Rule set no.2 her base kit and change the addon to make it so the trap triggers once you put it on someone's head, no matter if they did a gen or not. It's an ultrarare.
---
glad you did! lol
---
If you say so.  Personally I'm gonna go with my 50k floor 90k ceiling for doc.   Also half of all posts about most bloodpoints for killer are about Doc.

and when she downs Ash he should say "This is the most fun I've had with a Russian since '98"

&gt;  I dont think survivors should be able to spawn together without a shroud of union or binding

I noticed that I spawn with at least two other survivors really frequently without those offerings and I hate it

I've learned from friends in Georgia that cockroaches apparently love the stuff and sometimes get inside PS4s to eat it.

---
&gt; Camping already has its own punishments
---
barely. and the issue is that camping *also punishes other survivors for no reason*
---
Still lookin' good
---
I'm fine with slowing gens down a bit, but I believe the counter to camping and tunneling is in good survivor perks that punish a killer for camping, Tunneling well, if you get saved and then caught again it's your own fault. On the other side good killer perks might encourage killers to not camp/tunnel, but so far what I've seen in game I'm not really motivated to go for them.
---
Yall arent grasping the concept, I've literally went Gainst pigs that camp out the person with a trap on their heads then they get saved and they tunnel the person with a trap on their head instead of getting the person who saved and putting a trap on their heads.. pig players are dumb af.
---
I was clenching on every 360.
---
Well what ever rocks your boat I guess. Like the game didn't have enough toxic people to fill Madison square garden. I prefer winning my games and also I don't want to be a part of the toxicity problem. You're kinda petty if a person you don't even know gets under your skin that bad in a video game lol. Playing some shit like Eddie in Tekken I would understand but DBD? Nah
---
Wait... But where is momma Dwight?
---
&gt; I feel like Ghostface is almost impossible to break out of stalk at the moment
---
...It's absurdly easy now after they adjusted it
---
Camp then tunnel the person who had a trap on their head is counterproductive and dumb af
---
V nice

Fuck off little fuck boy..

Lol I love that there‚Äôs now a series of these, my Xbox page is filled with clips of bugs/questionable lag moments, maybe if we archive the footage the devs will see it (probably not though)
---
But we already have Clown
---
Hm hm hm hmmmm hmmm hmmmmmm
---
Doesn't have to be a huge increase for it to be felt. On the other hand if the gens required something be done first as opposed to just be rushed it might make for more engagement.
---
If I load up anything more intensive than the store page my original PS4 sounds like it's going to recreate Chernobyl. Playing Witcher 3 on it was a constant fear of it straight up exploding.
---
How the hell is nurse not on your nerf list?
---
The whole point of her power is to slow the game down... if you play pig like this you dont know how to play pig .

What perk is that?

That's already how the Jigsaw box works. At the beginning of the game, every player is given a box. Every time a RBT is placed on your head, it will be that box

Sure sure, keep telling yourself that.

Just because Playing as a Nurse is the Only Killer where the Player actually does have to have "Skill" in order to kill survivors.
---
Where most other killers. Just having perks will allow any Non Skilled Player to have a Imbalanced advantage.

I make liberal use of "C'mon guys I was only CLOWNIN around! :0) " and similar phrasing when I'm facing post game salt as Clown.
---
I don't know what rule book you're talking about, but answering toxicity with toxicity only drags you down to their level. You say you don't care yet you throw your game away because you're so easily tilted. I'd say you care a little too much to be honest
---
Looks like you're not too experienced... BBQ has the easiest counter in the world, just hide in lockers... Legion is currently one of the worst killers in the game, why would you nefr them? Ghostface is trash as well, he needs buffs, not nerfs. About NOED, just do bones...

You seem tilted to me friendo, reply quicker, you‚Äôre slower then Ghostface‚Äôs stalk meter.
---
i agree that adding something for killers and survivors to do would be good, and i also believe that there's a big problem with the hatch spawning even if zero gens have been repaired.
---
how about a third objective that determines if/when the hatch can spawn?  maybe there are some mechanical switches scattered across the map that survivors and killers can interact with.  if a certain number of them are turned on, then the hatch spawns.  but the killer can also turn them off or destroy them.  getting really tired of steamrolling survivors only to have the last one hop through the hatch with 1 or 0 gens repaired.
---
Definitely big noob. 
---
I do agree with him on buffing the ace perks though
---
Why Nurse's calling? It won't trigger from their mending action and the range is so low that they'll be out of it by the time they heal.
---
I quit Destiny 2 after Forsaken came out and it all went tits up. I stuck with it through the disappointment of Osiris and Warmind, I stuck through the raids that turned into an all-night affair, I just can't do all the grinding. It gave me flashbacks to Destiny 1's sword quest where you have to gather a bazillion materials. I was introduced to DBD and haven't looked back since. When the game is updating (seems like whenever I get on the console), I just play Crash Bandicoot and hold on to my sanity.

Frames Per Second is the overall Frames of the game. There is no possible way for the skill check to have seperate frames unless it is in a seperate program. which, BY THE WAY, it isn't. My dead by daylight runs at 60 FPS and there is no lag on skill checks. it does jitter, but I don't think that's any sort of lag, just bad game design. I have like 4.5K hours and I know almost anything about this game, so I think I would know how tf a simple ass skillcheck works. People who can't hit greats just complain, just like everyone else on this game. it's just complaining when in reality, a team of 4 perfect survivors, should all escape. it's not their fault you're not a perfect killer, and it's not their fault that they can actually hit fucking skill checks. so stop complaining about skill checks and gtfo this forum. Skill checks are possibly the easiest thing to hit, PC and Console. I play on both btw. you guys just need to stop complaining.
---
my favorite was "kill boosted adam" then a second one that said "do it"
---
Survivor main and it shows.
---
Megs after you unhook them even though you have We‚Äôll Make It and the killer‚Äôs on the other side of the map.
---
Because you know where they're going, and taking someone out of the game is much more impactful than putting a trap on someone's head.
---
Leaving your buddy to die?
---
Wow! I haven't had anyone tell me where their teammate was hiding. Since I am not good at killer I get a lot of gg ez or go back to playing survivor.  The best one was why didn't you try to kill us. It was literally my first game and couldn't find anyone. 
---
As a survivor I have been told to kill myself numerous times or that I am a crappy teammate for various reasons.
---
Lmao what did he say?
---
I was thinking this too. Different lockers and maybe a different style of locker (like regular looking lockers, e.g like in Outlast) for different maps.
---
People have been saying that mending isn't a healing action and thus isn't affected by the sloppy butcher nor does it trigger Nurse's calling. Though honestly I think it should.
---
He was dead on hook and if I tried to body block I would have died too
---
I think u did a thing
---
Tilted from what exactly? All I know you're just a dumb as shit teenager. You're gonna get beat the shit out of you if you have a behaviour like that in real life.
---
I don't unless there's literally no reason not to (if all remaining survivors already have a trap for example). I try to avoid tunneling where I can but if someone is consistently messing up and revealing themselves then that's on them, not me.

To add onto your comment, it's drawing updates.
---
Oh nooo, I‚Äôm quaking in my boots.
---
Damn this is out of date.  You'd have been right with the old Decisive that rewarded a free escape to avoid first hook for playing like shit but reworked Decisive only exists to punish babykillers who camp and tunnel now.  Did you make this meme 8 months ago and forget to post it or something?
---
The title is going to be my response whenever a survivor sends me a hate message when I do this to them, thanks OP!
---
I didn't even think of that. I like the idea though.
---
Oh gotcha. Very nice then! Was that your first off the hook escape? I did it once but the trophy didn‚Äôt pop so... it‚Äôs like I never did it at all!
---
He started by calling me a bitch, telling the game was PTW, and calling me a cheater. Eventually he complained I wasnt responding, and just started sending letters until I did.
---
Really annoying in a game where you have to hear survivors.
---
*tunnel vision activates*
---
Dude, reaching rank 1 in Dbd is like reaching gold in League, that's a low set limit to care for
---
Yeah you're not even denying what I said. Damn who breeds such retarded kids like what happened with your generation? Where did your parents go wrong. Stop talking shit pencil neck you'll hurt yourself
---
The camera angles on this were amazing.
---
No one chasing her and while running away from a generator.
---
All red addons are BROKEN, in fact you shouldn‚Äôt use addons at all it‚Äôs unfair on the survivors.
---
It‚Äôs especially worse on the menus, which might be why it‚Äôs more noticeable (since usually you focus more during a match). I think menus have uncapped FPS or something so the PS4 kicks into maximum overdrive to try to do its best when in reality it could just chill a bit.
---
Still kinda jet-engine midgame but not as bad as that boot up/load in.
---
This made my butthole clench.
---
Ya it was and I'm super proud, I'm a killer main so I rarely play survivor.
---
There's no frame cap on the intro.
---
You can woosh me all you want, if there was a joke there i didn't get it
---
Yeah, whenever pig puts a trap on my head it's *always* the last trap I check, and pig is *always* there at that last trap.
---
Theres no framecap on the intro to the game, until you get to the menu.
---
I dont think anything short of opening it up, cleaning everything and reapplying the thermal paste on the APU would do anything.
---
The other music drives me insane I will switch to an og killer just to get the normal song.
---
I really dont understand people who refuse to pay $ for in game DLC. The base game is only $20. DLCs arent expensive and go on sale all the time. 
---
Shards are supposed to take lots of time to earn, if it was quick and easy no one would spend $ to support the game. 
---
How much is your time worth? A $7 one time purchase is irrelevant to me.
---
I am just blown away people have that much free time I guess.  Between work, house work,a gf, and other activities/hobbies.  I am lucky to get 1-2 hours a day in play time.
---
Yeah pretty much. Sure I get wasted every now and then, but with constant shit weather and friends who are pussy whipped there's not much to do
---
This is a shitpost.
---
LMFAOOOOO!!!! That jojo end credit song has me dying
---
Also bill comes out on consoles Tuesday
---
Well the sound of her breathing gets pretty annoying after awhile in the menu so maybe this is the way to go
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt recognize it until you said
---
Well thats nice of hi- wait... Why am I Exposed now? Oh shit here we go again
---
Booth number is 4931!
---
Yup green ranks are the worst. Got to rank 8 but since nearly everyone quit because of the glitch on PS4, I‚Äôve been paired with greens and greys. Depip depip depip and I‚Äôm back to rank 10.
---
well that was the most cursed thing I read today
---
Okay your first statement is reasonable. I made a tier list and i got super downvoted because scream wasn't S tier with those 2 movies. But the thing is scream didn't influence any slashers besides 'i know what you did last summer'. It **definitely** influenced the horror genre as a whole but there are no notable slashers besides IKWYDLS that were influenced by scream. Friday the 13th and childs play both came out before scream. So unless you're talking about the sequels, you can't really say scream had any influence there. But H20 yes. Idk i think people are so caught up in how great of a movie scream was that they kinda go overboard on the influence it had. Thank you for the discussion, i just wanted some insight from the mind of a huge scream fan.
---
i try not to get effected by it but it's most of the time just some object of obsession dude with a flash light 24/7 tea bagging aura that is telling his teammates where i am and then just spam clicking flash light with some trash talk at the end. so getting that quite a bit is hard to not be botherd by it. i've also heard swf is not common but in low ranks it's almost half the games sometimes even more then half
---
That's not knocking them off.  That's the killer falling down on his own due to the speed of the chainsaw. 
---
Also, care to show the video of this awesome scene?
---
HEY GUYS
---
did you know that if you DROP A PALLET on a KILLER it'll STUN THEM?
---
Carbon Monoxide poisoning is serious shit and those lights have business being on at night. The generators make a lot of noise and his neighbors are sleeping :(
---
You're getting downvoted because elsewhere you snarkily comment you didn't even read the OP, so that means you just came in here to bitch about camping/tunneling.
---
Sometimes I'll wait until one of the perks in shop is one i already have and spend the shards to get 200,000 blood points
---
Sweet, thank you I've been looking for it :)
---
And that was the last anyone heard from DragonLayerOrnstein, his body was never found. Some say they can still hear him when moving in the fog, but these rumors have never been confirmed.
---
We shall keep posting!!
---
Nurse gets boring really fast. 
---
There is more to the game than winning.
---
I've had a few games that the lag/rubber-banding were so bad I just dc'd
---
Talking about the sequels, the tone of the franchises had a definite shift. I do think a lot of people oversell it's overall influence on the genre, but it was the most important horror movie of the 90s. And discussion is great, glad we could keep it civil.
---
Hahaha my exact feelings towards the pigs cosmetics
---
No problem! It‚Äôs kinda in front of the WB booth :)
---
MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN WAITING FOR A RESPONSE ON HIS SUPPORT TICKET FOR 9 MONTHS AND THE LAST THING THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID WAS "DO YOU STILL NEED HELP?" ON A TICKET WITH NO FUCKING RESPONSES!
---
I love Tapp with all my heart but by God he looks like he's ready to kill himself at any moment
---
I would never say men are all dicks. Most gamer guys that I meet irl and even in some games are great! But there are some games where unfortunately enough sexist dudes create extremely unwelcoming communities for women.  It only takes a few of the vocal minority to make it unfun for others.
---
You don‚Äôt get better item chances.
---
Me and my friends used to say look for wraith hooks.
---
Nurse and Billy would immediately blow their pick using their ability, and someone usually sees a trapper trap on spawn in.
---
Get PS4 Pro and it‚Äôs silent
---
Can you elaborate how this leads to camping?
---
In both system camping the first hook will lead to that player's death, its the same? The difference is that in current system, you can camp a player's second hook for only 1 minute, in my system its still 2 minute on every hooks.
---
I'm not trying to get fuck boys on myside..
---
No Xbox but may off accidentally hit it. Almost had all four on the ground until this happened too rip. But thanks for the advice if it happens again I‚Äôll try that
---
Maybe next time you do bones.
---
&gt;so is it that bad if a survivor chimes in?
---
Not at all. But see, now you're acting like you actually care about the topic at hand when you've made it painfully obvious that's not the case.
---
Why should anyone give you the benefit of the doubt when you come into a conversation with "LUL, TL;DR, STOOPID WLAL OF TXT. KILLERZ BAD THO AMIRITE?"
---
I was playing Huntress.
---
Detective Tapp was NOWHERE to be seen.
---
That was, unless I picked someone up. Then he'd just manifest into reality out of a box twenty feet away and flashlight blind me.
---
The dude was fuckin' on point. Amazing guy.
---
I mean once there is just 2 survivors left and you have 1 downed, a good killer doesn't even hook that downed survivor he will look for the second one to avoid hatch escapes.
---
It's just annoying because randoms dc after getting off their first hook and being tunneled.. like I played that shit out.. the pig did the samething to everyone
---
You rarely will bump into someone with DBD for XBOX
---
It‚Äôs that button with the two squares of you haven‚Äôt fixed it yet
---
Do you want me to screenshot my rank homie... I got no reason to front about my rank loser
---
it was a late night so i was like, FUCK IT WHY NOT?!
---
Its the menu button. The one on the left, not the start button. It inverts the controls. I believe you can disable it in the controls menu. Also, whats your gtag? I faced a nurse yesterday who seemed very confused lol.
---
to point out its not really rewarding when you reach prestige....
---
If lag every single game and smell shit everywhere you go check your shoes.
---
Then reply to that wall of text comment! There's a reason why this is a separate comment. Nothing is painfully obvious except you having stabbed your own eyes apparently.
---
Why? Because I refuse to play by your rules?
---
You mean ew XBOX!
---
yup
---
don t forget that guy that sabotages all the hooks
---
4 games in a row isn‚Äôt ‚Äúevery time‚Äù bud.
---
Doctor was always really bad, he has nothing helping him in any case. His anti-stealth is pointless because stealth isn't meta so he's basically countering something that doesn't need to be countered. His "anti loop" doesn't anti loop, his "game slowdown" slows him more than survivors(gettin survivors to tier 3 take too much time in chases and snapping out of it is ez pz). Maybe survivors got better at looping and started completely ignoring stealth.
---
Micheal has music for when you pick him, but I don't think he has custom music. :(
---
The PS4 Pros they started using with the RDR2 bundle are a different model that is much much quieter than the original Pro.
---
This
---
i love the idea, are you planning on doind it in status effects, items, addons and favors? if so, i¬¥d completely download them too!
---
Fun is not aloud when you are a killer main, everything is toxic
---
Spirit, GF is weak and super boring.
---
Starting off by doing 5 consecutive blinks to assert her dominance in the food chain.
---
I have absolutely face camped people out of pure spite knowing I'm giving away free generators. Yet it baffles me that people think that swarming around the hook instead of getting generators is a good idea. 99% of the time it just ends badly for them and they end up all getting hooked. 
---
 Whenever I get face camped I just tell my friends to get as many generators as possible. Alot of the time once you pop 3-4 generators killers get antsy and stop camping. If they dont oh well you let your allies win the game and move on.
---
What killer and add-ons start to matter in lower ranks
---
Also, I would suggest playing survivor a bit to learn how survivors loop so efficiently. Something as simple as chasing around a T/L wall clockwise vs counter-clockwise makes 3 loops worth of difference!
---
Hey, you're the one that seems to offended that you're getting downvoted and I offered an explanation. The fact that you felt the need to reply to your own comment is hilarious. 
---
The simple fact remains, you saw a post title talking about improving QoL for killers, came in, didn't read the main post, and then proceeded to whine "But what about camping/tunneling?" like you're owed it. And then proceed to go "LUL, stupid killers downvoting"
---
I don't know what else you expected from this.
---
I dont want custom music, the og one probably makes it cooler, i just want all the killers to have their own music(like wraith, billy etc.)
---
Well, I recently started playing Doctor and Leatherface a lot recently because I wanted their perks. Everything was fine with Leatherface because he had Franklin‚Äôs, but Doctor was the one who struggled the most. Oddly enough, I only really struggled as Doctor when it came to reading survivors‚Äô movements and dealing with gen rushing. As for Leatherface, loops. My usual build for Doctor is Distressing, Overcharge, NOED, and BBQ. For Leatherface, his 3 teachables (for a slug build I‚Äôm working on) and NOED. For Ghostface, Thrilling Tremors, Bamboozle, NOED, and Bitter Murmur. I‚Äôm only at rank 15, btw.
---
When looking for a game, it‚Äôll cancel the search and say Host Unreachable. Or it‚Äôll just kick you back to the main menu. Sometimes it works fine and you‚Äôll find a game but most of the times it won‚Äôt work.
---
It's buggy as hell for some reason. Even survivor que times are taking longer than usual. And Killer kicks me like 80% of the time.
---
wtf, you can't loop Spirit...
---
It's just circlejerking for upvotes
---
someone gave silver to this?
---
That was funny, LOL.
---
Dead man walking
---
It's super irritating and doesn't fit in the game's lore.
---
This just straight up rewards terrible play and punishes the other players. Why should I be instant dead on the hook because the same random got caught 6 times?
---
Not op tho
---
Don't worry man I'll call the whambulance about this
---
Without add ons you can hear spirit so you‚Äôd know if she‚Äôs using her power so yes you can loop spirit If she isn‚Äôt running prayer beads bracelet because you will her and know she is using her power
---
You want to see my network speed and PC specs?
---
Just a heads up: you can play anyone to get BP and just use those BP to level up killers you don't play but want the teachables. I did this with Nurse. 
---
LF and Doctor are some of the hardest killers to use effectively. If you go against good survivors they will loop LF well enough where you can't use your chainsaw and you'll have to hit them. 
---
Doctor is good for shutting down loops because his power stops survivors from vaulting. You need to switch to his power, use it, and quickly switch back and continue chase. It's made to force them to run into a wall instead of vaulting, then you can get your hit. 
---
Once you understand survivor movement you'll get better at baiting windows and predicting their movement to gain some ground. It's a pain in the ass and you'll get Tbagged a lot but stick with it.
---
Commit to a chase and down said survivor to apply some pressure. If you‚Äôve been chasing the same survivor for a while then you break the chase. Good survivors usually know where most pallets are 
---
Hope my two cents helped, if you have any other questions let me know!
---
This is gold
---
If the looper is busy trying to rescue then they're not doing gens and that's a good thing.  Just take a look around before you pick people up and if someone is hanging around, leave the downed person slugged long enough to chase the other one away or try to bait them into dropping the pallet.
---
Nah nah nah if you think camping is the most annoying thing for a survivor wait till you get downed/hooked first, and instead of gen rushing the face/proxy camper your teammates walk (not run) over to the hook, and save you only after you hit tier two
---
Also, u/Babyback-the-Butcher
---
Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPr_bQdVkj0) for some great looping tips
---
or maybe just don't camp them and try to win the game, if the survivor really is that bad you could just BM them on death hook.  
---
I don't see the point of throwing the game because someone mildly annoyed you :/
---
Guys I literally just mean changing client side music files to things like All-star just to meme. I'm not trying to change server side music to make myself silent or anything
---
I like the 3 strike system better, and plus I don‚Äôt think other players should be punished for the mistakes of their teammates
---
Or better yet when you are injured and on your last hook against a hag and then you unhook a teammate but they don't crouch. And if the hag is respectable they won't tunnel them so you end up having to fight her off.
---
HHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
HITBOXES can be fixed if the dedicated servers are good and you have good connection
---
I was exaggerating when I said intentional high ping, however in a way it would cause the killer to be more skill based due to timing. This would also be a killer specific ability and over time survivors would get prepared for "rewinds" during chases from the killer. Ping is not predictable, people are.
---
Are you on PlayStation? Because the touchpad inverts controls
---
DON'T BE TO HARD ON YOURSELF. 
---
I REPORTED TO MANY KILLERS FOR HACKING BEFORE I KNEW ABOUT IRON MAIDEN AND BBQ
---
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES
---
My rules? Just fun sucker is all you are.. I wait x amount of time to get in a match just to be camped and tunneled what waste of time, and time is precious...
---
I love his movies idc what anyone says.
---
I think hag is overpowered. XD
---
In the past, yes. But since i can just close the hatch and im more likely to find it before they do
---
BECAUSE FUCK YOU THAT'S WHY
---
I hope this has to do with console optimization
---
In which Continent do you live in? Just to make sure cuz if we live in same part of region it might be you!
---
Goddammit
---
It was today. So not your nurse
---
I've realized this a lot.. killers can do no wrong in this sub.. is there a survivor mains sub because this sub feels more like killermain.  It's just frustrating to play against people who are camping and tunneling .. I feel like an asshole if I dont try and at least save them and give them a chance..  it I try to just sit on gens.
---
This is hella wholesome. As a mostly friendly Piggy main, I love this.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main and I think both sides need to complete their objective (weather it‚Äôs killing it surviving) by any means. That‚Äôs the whole point of the game
---
It is
---
Damn immersed killers!!!!
---
WHY THE DUCK DOESN'T NURSES CALLING WORK ON MENDING DEEP WOUNDS
---
Indeed man, if Billy got behind you it was over.
---
Actually he just tossed that knife man
---
Yeah, I dont think theres been an announcement, but following the patern of 2 weeks after PTB always on a Tuesday, its safe to assume that its this Tuesday.
---
My problem is that I see posts like this all the fucking time and it‚Äôs just repetitive, there‚Äôs no point to them.
---
Acting like an asshole isn‚Äôt gonna get anybody to agree with you on anything. ‚ÄúFuck boys‚Äù or anybody else.
---
Idk it wouldn't work well against SWF
---
Better watch out for his traps
---
We just passed through utah salt flats yesterday. I swear that must have made by survivor tears
---
No. The adept reason is only using their three teachables.
---
You misread what I was saying. You cannot close the hatch while the survivor is still in the animation after opening with the key. You can close it after he jumped in it.
---
&gt;You are literally the one labeling a survivor point of view a bitching and a whine.
---
No, just you, because it's obvious you don't participate in many discussions in good faith.
---
&gt; I definitely don't expect anything from your comments anymore.
---
This is just gold considering your post history is a dumpster fire.
---
&gt;sometimes it's not about the game, it's about putting them in their place
---
I don't know if there is a fedora in this world big enough to accompany that statement
---
I just started playing a few days ago, but what's the point of gen tapping? Just happened to me in a game today and I was very confused.
---
Honestly yes. The menues have remained the same for too long.
---
That's what I was saying, or tried to say. Maybe I was unclear
---
That doesn't change the fact that you seem to have no idea how a peer to peer connection works.
---
It's because framerate is uncapped, so PS4 just goes all out and fans need to cool the the system.
---
lol, actually it was a legit question. feelsbadman
---
yes! it might take a little bit but i‚Äôll definitely do them!

Hag is not awful, wtf... especially compared to Leatherface. Also BBQ isn't needed at all.  
---
But yea ruin is needed... It really sucks gens are done so fast. They need to add other objectives in matches, just making gens get longer to finish would make playing survivor really boring.

‚Ä¢"stupid tunnler git gud youre garbage"- from a david who would always go back to the generator i originally yoinked him from, after his swf farmed him off hook and wouldnt heal him. and to be fair, i did down and hook his pal before going after him again. was playing spirit and got a 3k, the david wasnt the one who got out
---
‚Ä¢numerous times ive gotten the simple "trash. reported" for playing legion. and most of those times i played them for a daily and had 2-3 perks at best
---
‚Ä¢got spammed a metric fuckton of party invites from a p3 dwight who suicided on first hook. yet again, playing spirit and yoinked him off a gen. got my 4k and continued to play more decent killer games while the invites roll in for the next hour
---
‚Ä¢got called a camper for yoinking someone who came to unhook another survivor .5 seconds after the initial hook??? like i just barely finished the animation. chill.
---
survivor sides a little less salty, moreso shitposty and funny
---
‚Ä¢one time, this david i narrowly escaped with messaged me and started flirting with me, saying how id be the perfect girl for him and hed treat me right. but uh. im a VERY gay man in a happy relationship (if youre reading this, hi boo!! ily!!!). i told him i appreciated his uh. attempts? but that he was barking up the wrong tree. happy ending tho, he was understanding and didnt spew any homophobic shit
---
As a survivor main, I agree to this quote wholeheartedly.
---
r/Nobodyasked
---
1. You can't hear her if you are in her husk's TR
---
2. Even if you hear she's using her power you have no idea where she is. You can hear and see Nurse as well but it doesn't give you anything... 
---
I hate when people think the only power of Spirit is prayer beads, it's kinda dumb. She has insane chase potential and map pressure. I play her in red ranks and consistently win.
---
Yeah, but there's no punishment for fixing the first one if you're already injured then
---
Winter theme best theme.
---
Art team don't fix bugs yes I know. I don't need to understand that. My qualm isn't with Art team but with management.
---
No issues on my pro, clean your console. There are a couple of good youtube videos on how to do it just need some compressed air and the right security bit. I think it's a t9?
---
They wanna do it once for the achievement, then never care anymore.
---
wouldn‚Äôt work well at all*
---
Dang I wanted to see what happened lol
---
He can tell me to quit bitching When I asked a question? but I cant tell him to fuck off.. why dont you ride his dick a little harder.
---
What boot camp are you at that allows a macbook? Must be some Air Force shenanigans
---
It was happening to me earlier. If you wait long enough you‚Äôll eventually get a lobby, on both.
---
It‚Äôs just joking around dude don‚Äôt take it so dead serious
---
It reduces your chances of skill checks however it makes the process last twice as long
---
I find it useless as any at least half competent killers will have a vague idea where you are at. BBQ just helps to confirm it. And if 4 survivors are alive, most of the time where is someone near you, so killer sees him and comes to you anyway.
---
 That's a good point, maybe if you're already injured out puts you into deep wounds so then you have only 2 chances.
---
If your Chaser emblem is poor, it means that you need to find ways to extend your games without jeopardizing your sacrifices. Killers that have ways to subvert chases, such as with traps or the Pig's ambush, can often finish even great games with a bad Chaser emblem.
---
I have a Pro and I‚Äôm pretty sure you need a boarding pass just to be in my room when that bad boy starts up
---
This sounds like you could just turn old Freddy into this. Have them become part of the furry world and then when they're in it, go for the kill
---
Does ''in good faith'' mean kiss killer mains ass? Then no I guess I don't. It really isn't dumpster fire though lol. Yeah I make survivor sided comments on a sub that's very killer sided. Sometimes will get downvoted, its not that serious :D But keep using the word obvious instead of actually explaining your argument :) Have a nice evening.
---
So I was playing Legion (I think, the memory is a bit fuzzy) and I had basically won the game. The gens were done but I had sacrificed 3 survivors and closed the hatch, so I find the last guy trying to open the exit gate, hit him once and begin chasing him around. Up until that point I had never seen the endgame murder, so I thought that I would chase until the time ran out.
---
Yes, a dick move but it gets better.
---
The survivor runs to a hook that ha seen used, and I think they have figured out I was gonna wait for the timer so they showed no fear picking up something from the ground. Nevertheless they got to the closed hatch, opened it and jumped trough in front of my eyes.
---
Yes, a more experienced killer would figure out that the survivor had gotten a key and would hit them down, but hey I got bamboozled proper and that guy even making it out in that scenario due to my hubris is impressive enough.
---
And Ghostface. I wish they would go back to the other movie characters and put in the movie themes. Imagine picking Pig and getting that epic ass Saw theme.
---
Agreed
---
I think it would work well if every time they made sound of surviver it would be distorted slightly or wrong survivor
---
If it's anything it might be the gfx card. Open up some sort of viewer like the task manager to see if anything is maxing out while playing, and if it is, that's the issue. Maybe even dialing back a little isn't a bad idea.
---
Honestly the problem could even be thermal throttling, the laptop gets so hot that the only way to cool down is to essentially freeze.

Yes, Id like your ~~completely~~ ~~real~~ picture of your rank. Because that clearly defines how good you are at the game that no one ever complains about the ranking system not working.
---
*Violent coughing*
---
And Freddy should set the lobby to the dream world
---
What?
---
My problem isn't people flocking like lemmings, my problem is when the killer is face camping me and slapping me on the hook and the survivors just crouching in place for 2 minutes. Sometimes they're even as far away from the hook as possible and can't hear the terror radius but still just sit there crouching. And then in the last 10 seconds before I die they all rush to the hook and get downed.
---
Oh lol.
---
? Are you hooking everyone at least 2 to 3 times. If people are dying on their first hook that's not good... chase, hit,hook, break pallets hit gens, keep survivors off gens, rinse and repeat.
---
Here comes the trapper
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt even intentionally do it. Like I‚Äôll finish a chase look for someone else and just see them staring at me and go ‚Äúokie dokie don‚Äôt even have to search for you.‚Äù

You're embarrassing.

Oh thats right !, my bad, I get so confused with so many rules !
---
Welcome to the club, pal. Now you can see that, deep down, the killer is the real victim.
---
And as addition time just enough to run away when turning back so that if you too slow you get damage but if you quick to react both you and monster are in advantage since monster is closer and survivor is still not damaged
---
It‚Äôd be amazing if the saw theme played as the RBT timer ticked down building up as it gets closer to activating
---
You might as well buy the DLC right now tho its 50% off!!
---
Self care takes 32 seconds to heal yourself while self-healing from using a med kit only takes 16 seconds. Think about it like this, if you use self-care *twice* in a game then you spent 64 seconds *not doing gens*. Those 32 second intervals of just standing in one spot only serve to give the killer more time to hunt down the team.
---
Now I should say that pharmacy isn't a great perk if you want healing. The green med-kit is only worth 1 heal, maybe 2 if you hit the great skill checks to conserve charges. I simply want it because I plan to use it with botany knowledge to conserve charges and make healing faster. Which would allow me to take it out of the match if I escape for future use. So yeah, I just want to stock up on med-kits. Bit of a meme strategy, but that's what I want.
---
I have all the dlc I mean the cosmetics
---
The best perks are all from free survs so it doesn't really matter.
---
It's currently going on now.
---
So first of all you were bitching. Second of all you can tell anybody whatever you want. I‚Äôm just saying the abrasive name calling isn‚Äôt gonna get you anywhere. But obviously gauging by your combative response to me I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre not gonna grasp that concept.
---
The old Freddy when he needs to use his power to put them to sleep, maybe instead of putting them to sleep, they go in sort of an illusion world and instead of the killer it‚Äôs a survivor.
---
Lmfaooo yes exactly, i had a No Mither David stand directly in front of the hook in a bush for 30 seconds until the spirit heard his breathing and grunts and downed him. 
---
It sucks because when i play killer, survivors make zero mistakes and always kick the shit outta me, but the second i play survivor, its like someones lag switching their brains.
---
I mean, he used to not even start the match cloaked, so no they really did not.
---
then you should go for Kate. her perk dance with me removes sketch marks after you fast vault a window/locker for 3 seconds. it has a 60 second cool-down but works well with quick &amp; quiet or lithe.
---
Dead by daylight said trans rights.
---
DS then. One of the best perks.
---
True...
---
*stress intensifies*
---
im a rank 16 survivor and i just like it because it makes me feel really sneaky
---
Then I done get it, you camping ? Maybe upload your game play?
---
Just tell us which emblem ur failing on. If its chaser i suggest toying with them once its only 2 survivors left. Purposely have them win chases and extend the game.
---
Just grab them all it be probably about $20 for them all!!
---
Either feng min for lithe or Kate for dance with me
---
So tired of the lag.
---
I asked about the pig plays not how to get 12 year olds to like me on dbd reddit..

Ok then stop commenting on my post if you have no real value to offer...
---
You know that you always ignore the toxic player and go for the other. Never chase a survivor that wanta to be chased. What killer do you main by the way? You also want to play survivor aswell get used to the way you play, it's help.
---
Oracle predicts a great game
---
Kate's Dance with me can work wonders with Lithe, if you own Feng Min (not sure if you're playing on console or PC). I've lost plenty of killers that way.
---
I thought of that combo but adding quick and quiet to it.
---
It‚Äôs not your own fault if the killers ‚Äústrategy‚Äù is to proxy camp hooks and make a b line back to the hook the moment they see someone coming for the save. This is extremely common, and the most typical form of tunneling. So if the survivors need perks to attempt to stop these crappy killers, then killers should need perks to slow down gens. How is it fair to just address one in the base game, and not the other. Just as killers don‚Äôt want to have to bring ruin all the time, survivors shouldn‚Äôt have to feel required to bring DS and Borrowed Time every game. To address both issues is being fair.
---
The devs are already planning to change it so SWF groups get matchmade by their average rank, just stick it out for a bit longer
---
Amen üôèüèª
---
I personally don't like them because I feel they rob the characters of personality by making them all in one similar style. I know that's the point of the doll, but I simply don't like the aesthetic.
---
Haha.  RNG hates me
---
All good. It is a bit to read lol. I wasn't planning it but I love this game too much for it to just be ignored and quiet about it. They fixed Wake Up in less than a week.
---
That‚Äôs what my boyfriend does. It‚Äôs a great combo for losing the killer for sure
---
*(humming electric guitar intensifies)*
---
hmmmm,   hmmmMM,   hmmMMM hMMMMM HMMMM

What did they do? Tbagged you and blinded you? What else did survivors do to you? Called you a cunt?
---
Love these posts..
---
Better don't step in his traps...
---
Oh wait.. DO!.. Do... Step in his trap!
---
You're jaded, brother.  BHVR doesnt fit that description in the least.
---
The simple fact that the game punishes you for killing quickly, or not being chased on survivor side, is stupid.
---
That‚Äôs good because I have no idea how to get ANYBODY to like you.
---
When 3 gens pop at the same time yeah you got my attention XD
---
Not when you use bs addons .. shut up and take the challenge of the map.
---
I'm a consistent red rank survivor and killer, As survivor I come across a lot more spririts then I do nurses. Nurse and Spirit are equally tiered by the community, due to the fact that both of their abilities are really good.
---
Omg you guys see that? Its made with mematic!
---
Just where healing will take so long they usually get greedy and try to heal with me around I suppose bloodhound could be an alternative
---
Wait Feng is something you have to buy on PC? And plus I thought of Kate's dance with me and lithe with quick and quiet
---
15 hours a day is excessive!! Theres a whole world outside!
---
It really depends. You either got this info from xbox fanboys or people with 5 yr old playstations
---
Haha love the memes XD as a killer now I understand them more
---
505-5555 would be a vaild number, you just need to ignore the space.
---
Depends. If any killer is walking back to the hook when you get saved, if they don't see the person who saved you but they see you, they're going to go after you, simple as that.

I HATE BEING THE KILLER BUT THE GAME TEMPTS ME WITH DAILY RITUALS. ALL I NEED IS ONE MORE SACRIFICE TO GET IT AND THEN I CAN STOP BUT I DON'T WANT TO CAMP A SURVIVOR ON A HOOK BUT THEN I GET MAD WHEN THEY GET RESCUED UUGGGGHHHH
---
I have friends I'm not worried about online eboys..

Same thing can be said for the hatch fpr survivors sucking so one person gets a crutch to escape

HORROR BY THE WAY

Wow, I guess people hate achievements here. Hah

He‚Äôs too old for this shit

Nah they full on proxy camping while being crouched, then waits for the save and tunnels the guy with the party hat on...

you use a perk in the game? TUNNEL.

I'm a console player as well and bloodlust definitely sucks when being a killer.  I'm sure his fps was single digit when trying to hit you.  Great 360's though!

---
Hey, I'm completely fine with people playing 4SWF, but if they complain about me picking omegablink nurse against them I think they must be disabled :)
---
Preach
---
The hatch can't be stopped first off, and most killers just hook the third person, close the hatch, and camp the doors anyway.
---
Luck was on your side today.  Play the lotto.
---
I wish he started with all of his traps while still only having a limit of 2 traps carried afterwards.  He should be able to get his traps set up early game much faster.  It's his main massive drawback, if he could get get his traps set up where he wants to within a reasonable amount of time then he could actually be a decent killer.
---
It's really rough today with the camping and tunneling... so unfun to play against.. oh and all the spirits with prayer beads is driving me bonkers.
---
Quit crying, if they do that to you it‚Äôs for a reason. Blame your team mates for not being smart enough to work on gens or carry a perk like borrowed time, if your getting tunneled then have decisive strike handy, getting camped? Have team mates work on other things, be s good team mate take the fall for them. I‚Äôm a survivor main so no excuses
---
Dead hard is pre counterable. And i dont see people bitch about bloodwarden.

I can only buy one character because I only have 9000 shards

Can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt nuke that classic swing technique.

Sure but that didn‚Äôt happen. I said blowing gens, as in purposeful missed skill check.
---
luv how they downvoted ur comment. Just shows ur right.
---
What does Object of Obsession means?
---
First game I played yesterday I got told to kill myself and that my corpse should be raped, in that specific order. Because I brought Franklins.
---
But, then that makes the survivor the enemy? Lol how you gonna heal them, do gens with them? The killer just gotta let them self destruct lol good idea but not very Medusa like

---
A camper (and here i mean a real camper) usually won't be able to pip. I really don't see many hard campers at high ranks.

I think if you're in a kill your friends lobby, it looks like that.

I think you mean disconnect

Deny, David, Hag and Doctor (I believe) are all DLC characters that you either buy or come with special edition which is standard edition on console

Sad, but true.

&gt; It's really rough today with the camping and tunneling
---
I'm an old school player and i think it used to be worse back in the days. With new emblem system a camper will almost surely depip, so you don't see too many at high ranks. Devs also made it so you can unhook from sides, and added BT. There used to be NOTHING u can do vs a face camper.
---
Happens to me almost every game
---
Or you could break NOED. Look for it just like the killer looks for the hatch
---
i know everyone wants that as a skin but i want tcm 2 leatherface beginning, and 3d leatherface the most
---
True, true
---
Solo survivor que is 10 minutes. Killer que is one minute. Different ques is why they are different.
---
I'm not going to get Deliverance because I'm usually the first or second person hooked. And also most games I play the killer puppy guards and tunnels the hook Survivor
---
My ingame name is teabag at exit and sometimes the killer only wants me to be dead so he camps me. Aaa. I only teabag at exit as my name says and I dress with toxic colours but I am not so toxic actually.
---
"but dedicated servers will ruin dbd!!!!!"

Damn. My bad guys. Didnt realize a quick joke required me to take about 10 min.s for me to post. Ill remember that next time to not post anything unless I spend lots of time to make it perfect just for you. Remember. Im trying to be a proffesional streamer.
---
If the killer is nearby and able to get back to the hook yes. But there are times they luck out and both manage to get away. But usually risking pulling somebody off a hook with killer not that far away is a dumb idea because the rescuer gets smacked and the hooked person runs or vice versa; the person rescued just gets hit again and back on hook
---
In terms of your #6 I believe Killers in general already make more BP than the survivors. You can lose the match and not get a single survivor and only be at 5,000 BP deficit most of the time. Get any sacrifices and your BP amount drastically improves. When facing a good SWF and not a super experienced killer it's not expected to kill all of them or even the majority, however if one is determined enough you should be able to kill at least 2 unless you had a really bad day at the office. So I don't think a boost is necessary. In terms of the proximity chat, I'm all for more BP though I just thought that your proposal for facing SWF wasn't the best. Things like party chats on console completely negate it. (Seriously though Devs, hit us up with some more BP post match) Also perhaps another way the dev's can remedy your issue is to award BP at the end of the season with more BP for higher ranks, thus getting more for playing at a higher level.
---
This is a common insult I‚Äôve gotten too, usually on my hag games where I have a three gen. Sorry your brains stopped working and you were idiots with which gens you did, but I‚Äôm not any more fond than you are of taking 15 minutes to finish a game.

It's a you issue then.

Rule #321 from Survivor‚Äôs Rulebook for Killers
---
Hahah yeah she haunts me man
---
Feng auto corrected to deny for some reason
---
Nah like call them fuck boys and dick riders.
---
So she doesn‚Äôt have an active skill? Just a passive one?
---
No its just that both of you doing your jobs.
---
That's pretty stupid tbh. I know "the entity feeds off hope" but I feed off being rewarded for steam rolling survivors.
---
Now ok, i can get like being rewarded for game length and such, but if you immediately kill everyone and that decided sometimes you get the iridescent and sometimes you don't because of that, the devs really need to make ranked a separate mode or something so I can stop caring about their system
---
Yo, that is an awesome cosplay on the right.  Looks perfect!
---
Have seen this idea on here so many times, the killer would be c tier at best for lack of map pressure.
---
I feel if Ash has a killer counterpart, the killer would be the Evil Dead, and that‚Äôs what the evil dead does, is take another person.
---
You could make the point that the hatch it a crutch for the survivor. I just don‚Äôt see NOED is that powerful as people say it is
---
I don‚Äôt know what game you are playing friend, but it definitely isn‚Äôt dbd.
---
Ghostface can stalk you in like 5? seconds, he can 99% you and you need to be close to him to reveal him and it is also buggy. He also has add-ons to get a lower stalk time and a shorter reveal range. And he doesn‚Äôt have power? He also as a fast crouch much better than the pig.

Many people change the icons and no one got banned afaik. Changing anything else will probably result in a bam

I was playing as the Huntress and 2/3 other survivors whom werent hooked yet went for a poor Dwight.

I'll send one your way when I play again
---
I also don‚Äôt like the fact that you need to almost ask survivors to rescue who is hooked or you don‚Äôt get the emblem. There is times that I run for the other side of the map so that they can save who is in te hook but they just leet him die and I‚Äôm the one who suffers because of that.
---
You never really escape, your just playing the entity's game. Its balanced around killer 2k so the chances of you dieing are 50/50. I view de-pip as losing by definition because that's the only time you get punished for doing badly.

Oh the rng will "love" traps if you play the pig. It'll be one or two boxes for survivors every time.
---
Been playing since day one and i noticed it used to be a lot easier to get to rank 1 without even trying and now I‚Äôve noticed these ‚Äúwalls‚Äù you speak of. I‚Äôm glad the game is getting bigger but when a killer has some good skill it gets hard dealing with people who live by urban evasion and sprint burst. Lol my preferred rank is around 6 on ps4

can you imagine the shit this would lead to? i can almost guarantee some butthurt fucking random would seek out the killer, and just keep getting hung to grief their teammates.
---
Considering all my friends have the same issues it's definitely not a "me" issue.
---
Your'e outof your mind if you think a mori is equivalent to DS. A mori doesn't even use a perk slot and you can remove a player from the match after 1 hook. Decisive stops tunneling for 60 secs. I don't see the comparison here.
---
You know What? Fair.
---
Fair
---
Nobody said killers can't play Leatherface moron. Play who you want and quit complaining.
---
I got more achievements than you in 260 hours
---
Now is it okay to do that if I'm trying to get the killers attention off of my teammate(s) who may be a bit away trying to heal? Honest question lol.  Only time I teabag or click. Or... if a killer might show mercy if my team immediately dies and I'm just... scooting around hoping to just find a hatch or quick death.
---
I know how to beat the different types of jukes. The problem is knowing which one they're doing. Good players will mix it up, and with horrible frame rates, it's very hard to tell what they're doing, and sometimes jukes let them break LOS for long enough to get to a safe place. I find the best way is to predict which one they'll do and hit them before they get a chance to gain distance.
---
My wife when my ps4 sounds like its about to melt me tv stand, "wtf is that noise? Is it supposed to sound like that?"

NOED: permanent speed boost, instant down survivors

I see the similarity. Actually, no I don't.

There's heaps of icon packs you can get. You just replace the original ones

Looks like you were 1 second away from being exposed. Ghost face has to be looked at for 1.5 seconds and you have to have clear line of sight on 85% of his body. At the beginning of the clip, he was behind obstacles and you exposed him directly after he exposed you at the end.
---
Dude, I was making the same point as you did in your meme
---
The other guy said 'Use any perk' and I will tunnel and when I asked meaning of Object of Obsession (which is something for killer to be obsessed about) you butted in with unnecessary copy paste.

I think that she would be pretty bad imo, in the same day that she would be released, all the players would know to just not look at her direction at all, making her power pretty much impossible to use. I think that instead of that passive she should have an active skill that forces  survivors to look at her. Instead of having a skill that downs survivors quickly (like ghostface or myers) it would be pretty good if her powers was focused more on finding survivors
---
This doesn't even sound that strong. A 1 second blind is too short to mean anything, it doesn't help in a chase, and you literally just don't have to look at her to not trigger the ability.

Yeah it was around the last double bloodpoints event.
---
Thank you for your input!! I agree in the terms that killers do get more bloodpoints but I also firmly believe they deserve more than a single survivor. I don't think it needs to be anything drastic but even trying to get a killer match in the morning tends to be hard. I see your point though that people would abuse it. SWF at high ranks is something else though, so that's where my mind was. People do need more bloodpoints consistently though. There are many things now that are way too pricey.
---
I mean can you loop a killer whitout looking at it at all?
---
Here comes the trapper don‚Äôt step in his traps *snap* here comes the trapper you better eat some gingersnaps

You get more from co-op work. You'll get repair points and co-op points on top of it. You can max out objective pts by doing 2 co-op gens. IDK what you're talking about.

---
That's what it looks like when you kill a survivor by your own hand. Some perks let you do it, or you can bring a Momento Mori offering. Every killer has a different Mori animation.
---
the matchmaking is just fucked. There aren't any servers at the moment.
---
Its a bit rediculous when you can tell they are all on voice coms because as soon as I down one another is there with a flash light stunning me. I downed someone in the match like 6 times but didn't get a single hook.
---
yes, with my ps4 as soon as  you start up any game its just a fucking jet

I'm taking the assumption that all files that are hidden in unreadable folders and files are made that way to detect a ban, so icons and stuff since they don't affect anything are fine.

Not a sound to be heard from my Xbox One X when I play DbD. But if I play it on my PS4 Pro I literally have to turn the tv volume up to drown out the annoying sound.

Actually it was Rancor. Once the gates open you can kill your obsession

First part is pretty interesting. Not with you on the second part.

Why does it affect exit gates? I don't know how that really fits in with the whole hangmans thing.

Apparently not

I know it's rancor, he/she asked about the cutscene. Rancor is still a mori basically

PCMR amirite? XD

LOL :P :P :P

Killers think they should be able to 4k every game even though that is not how balance works lol
---
Lol niub

I thought it was pushed back because DP was working on Fire Force
---
He doesn't gave any map pressure, and with out map pressure you cant really make anything about the gens if you are in a big map

It triggers the same animation for a kill but i didn‚Äôt have to burn anything
---
Is it just on console people have issues or on PC too?
---
This is legendar- Hahahhaha...  Holy shitt, never laughed this much..
---
Nah, it was on PC, but I play on both. I got used to the controller and I have one plugged into my PC at all times, so I use it. DbD defaults to controller if it‚Äôs plugged in, so I don‚Äôt have any pc key prompts.

The elevator shows how many survivors up or down and which floor that could be cool
---
Mostly due to dust, if you give it a good clean with an air blower/compressed air it will sound much better
---
What does it do!?
---
Yeah, I was just so disappointed after Forsaken that I didn't feel like shelling out more money for a game that had consistently let me down since it was released. 
---
It's such a shame, too, because I absolutely adored Destiny 1, but got in the bandwagon after it was already dead so I didn't complete any of the raids. Then I got Destiny 2  and was in awe of how it looked, but the game just felt too easy, you know? I'm by no means an adept player, but D2 campaign, through the Red War, Osiris, Warmind and even Forsaken is hella easy.  
---
The hard, fun stuff (mainly raids, as they lack matchmaking) require people and my potato ass can't be looking for squads online because I'm not that good, my headset situation could be miles better, and my internet connection is a joke. Maybe I'll go back to it when I'm not frustrated with it anymore. 
---
I'm not on xbox :C, but on PS4. Thanks, though!
---
*all proceed to instantly escape traps because fuck you for playing like a smart person*
---
What if the killer has knock out? What would I do then?
---
Nope.
---
Insert image with baby dwight camping elevator
---
almost feels like a lagswitch
---
Not sure about XBOX, but my Destiny 1 edition PS4 sounds just like a jet engine when I start up DBD. First time it happened, I panicked and thought my system couldn't handle the game.
---
To be fair tho, my PC has great specs and also makes terrible noises when starting up the game and during load screens. Pretty sure it's just the game's optimization being dog shit.
---
I actually really love this idea, although I don't know how well it'd work in practice.
---
I mean, the elevator would be totally useless against the Nurse, Trapper could probably permanently shut down usage of the stairs with Iridescent Bar, and Doctor would probably be very annoying.
---
That said, it'd be unique and interesting, something DbD needs in more of in it's map selection IMO.
---
Yes they do, dummy. Before, if a killer closed the game, survivors wouldn't get jack shit, but nowadays they get their points, no matter how the killer DC'd.
---
You are just being dumb and salty.
---
when u at gate  with tier 3 evil within
---
I tried to be like you.  
---
Ended up Mori'd beside the hatch.
---
That is the joke
---
entity ritual
---
I play both and both mains are the fucking worst.
---
How do you get your perks to look like that?
---
DBD is oddly hard on GPUs imo. I have a 1060 in my PC and when I play DBD on medium it revs up like a jet engine. Doesn't do it with other games that have prettier graphics, just DBD.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
No idea what issue you are having but not happening with me on Xbox . It don't take more than 2 minutes to find a game .
---
They fixed that months ago.
---
&gt;Get some fucking skill you bitch.
---
Says the one getting looped for 3-4 gens. Cut the chase and go patrol, if you let a chase drag on like that you're throwing the game for yourself.
---
But one shit connection from another survivor can kill latency.
---
&gt;You get more from co-op work. You'll get repair points and co-op points on top of it. You can max out objective pts by doing 2 co-op gens. IDK what you're talking about.
---
I am talking about Emblem points, not bloodpoints.
---
He isn‚Äôt high rank. 
---
Look at how that player ‚Äújuked‚Äù him.
---
* This image link is either dead, deleted or broken. Please resubmit with a better link.
---
You're the problem with this game
---
YOU NEVER PLAYED TUBER SIMULATOR?!
---
lol
---
They never ever worked in the first place
---
Still waiting on them fixing this shit. It honestly makes playing killer unfun for me too. Takes all the excitement and skill lit of finding my prey by seeing a big ass blob on a gen.
---
Dont even get me started on the exit gate and deadhard bug. Annoying af.
---
Also, just two low level perks
---
Yeah, since there's no instablind anymore, you only get cucked by a flashlight save if you are not expecting it.
---
No worries, internet points are the last thing to worry about!
---
Just started playing The Pig and boy is it lovely. It's a nice feeling when you get slap a headtrap on survivor that's baiting you like that (if they happen to make a mistake). Sure they just might succesfully remove it in the end, but it adds just a bit of pressure on them. Suddenly they have one more thing to do before escaping, and they can't just bum-rush the exit gates if their friends get them open.
---
lol good idea
---
It isn‚Äôt a repost, I made it myself, the shit quality confirms that
---
I want that!
---
That's fine but that particular game is fundamentally unfair to OP. It's not like they lost on an even battlefield
---
Ugh, usually I don‚Äôt say things like this, but so does everyone, pal.
---
I had to become one with the entity.
---
But as soon as I got my unbreakable filled and was about to get up, she tried to pick me up and then that happened. We all have to be sacrificed one way or another
---
it feels like there‚Äôs only 50 people in the community so makes sense
---
I don‚Äôt think a full swf would use 3 shrouds
---
It is a repost. It's not original.
---
At least it's not his cousin.
---
sry man im new here
---
it‚Äôs pronounced nea.  ugh you‚Äôre such a MEG
---
/wholesomememes
---
Hmmm yea nurse would probably be fairly OP in that map
---
For trapper, i think the stairs could be made big enough so a single trap isn't enough to block it
---
Doctor would definitely be annoying on this lol
---
Lol yeah man ‚Äúbalance‚Äù is key
---
No dude its just the new killers having the same hit cone as the trapper. They just need to fix the animation then the problem will be fixed /s
---
I never said it was original but I made it

Wow that‚Äôs just sad

Or "What Now"

That's what happens when baby Dwight gets free hatch instead of a good ass whopping from time to time.

Um ok kid...  all you did was come on my post and bitch about how I chose to deal with dbags.. take your own advice and keep it moving.
---
Bad killer is the Real Meta
---
Adam
---
Diversion can help you with a stealthy playstyle + he has Deliverance which is a top tier perk so go with him
---
there aren't many survivors with stealth perks tbh, Distortion (from Jeff) is hella terrible, don't even bother grinding for it
---
Are you running the Whispers perk? It sounds almost exactly like David to me.
---
Search ‚Äúnot otzdarva which killer to buy‚Äù on YouTube. He has a really good video breaking it down
---
I have friends, but they have lives and jobs lol
---
My life as a sprint burst borrowed time running Meg main. Always multiples in the basement, too.
---
Taking someone else's joke and changing two words doesn't make you a content creator, bud.  It makes you an unoriginal thief.  And it's a repost.
---
Player level 56, killer rank 13 (atm) survivor rank 10, and yes low level perks because hes only a level 7 Freddy. No add ons. Collecting blood to get teachables before leveling him up.
---
Fucking w h a t
---
Omg it looks like freaking goat simulator
---
I just realized I made a spelling mistake
---
They were most likely joking, no way they could actually use "nae nae'd" as an insult
---
Tbh it's pretty good against nurse and billy, and even spirit with all the windows to escape her phasing. 
---
And since thats a majority of the killers in higher ranks it's not a bad idea to bring.
---
Yes, you can look away from the light, but Toxic Clauds love to do nothing but follow the killer to blind save or click their flashlight at the killer to get their attention. I'm not saying it's good, it's what annoying Clauds love.
---
Funny enough, the best teammate I ever had was a non swf and he flashlight saved me multiple times. I'm not saying that the people you played against weren't swf, but don't assume just cause they help eachother out.
---
Lol campers depip tunnelers as well if you can run them around
---
made with mematic
---
Idk I 4k with the Huntress and they only got one gen done. Then i get that message lol.
---
A cruel world at that.
---
You clearly have no idea about what you are talking about.
---
What fucks nurse on console is the garbage framerate, not the controller. Ofc it's better on a mouse, but the gap isn't that much.
---
Bad baby Dwight. Someone gets a spanking.
---
They just mentioned buying Kate with shards, not the outfit.
---
Well there was def a dbag in the interaction and it wasn‚Äôt him. Kid? I‚Äôm prolly at least 10 years older than you (at least I hope). And believe me it really shows by the way you choose to conduct yourself.
---
buy one u cant get with shards
---
That‚Äôs why I ask?
---
he's an idiot, dont bother
---
Maybe a rank thing? I'm pretty low rank
---
Thank.  You.
---
‚ÄúSpare the hook and spoil the Dweet!‚Äù
---
Is 120 supposed to be good or...
---
Low rank is honestly pretty chill, but once you get around 12 or so, good luck. Both sides get nasty.
---
This lasts for the first few hours you play because the killers still spook you.  Once that's no longer the case playing survivor is basically no pressure and even relaxing most of the time.  Killer is stressful AF.
---
Accept nature, it‚Äôs gone shave it.
---
Thank you, u/Ace-in-your-hole.
---
Why do I have this red circle around me?
---
Yeah my pro doesnt make a peep either. Seems we got lucky
---
Yea u can report them
---
I have no idea how to loop. I‚Äôve watched a few videos, but it seems like I‚Äôm so slow. Also hitting skill checks with high ping sucks.
---
Yay
---
Considering though that the vast majority of Wraiths just do the cloaked camp, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd consider him fun for both sides overall. I would agree though that an actual good Wraith is kinda fun, but maybe that‚Äôs cause it comes as such as a surprise when they aren‚Äôt just hanging around the hook thinking they using some clever strategy.
---
Getting picked up isn't too hard. It's only hard because the killer is usually RIGHT there when you're down.
---
Even if its counterable, it can still be used to secure a loop or get to a pallet without killer able to touch them, making it sometimes uncounterable
---
Honestly a bit disappointed with the lack of NSFW content for these new cosmetics on r/dbdgonewild
---
Ya, you can report them to both bhvr and steam/sony/microsoft, its against all those platforms tos
---
Is it actually counts as suicide propaganda?
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Because they are used to winning, so when they don't win they tend to put on a diaper and suck on a pacifier.
---
And they're rank 20 because they don't do anything worth points, so they never pip
---
Wow stop crying and grind up the Hag like everyone else
---
Emblem system, and survivors bragging about killers destroying them with Mori for achievement
---
So instead of making it easier for the killer achievements, you want both sides to be difficult? You do realize you would have to play survivor to get them too, right? This logic doesn't make sense.
---

He gets paid to play them.

But also fun and lots of things to see and do.

*sigh* "Again??"
---
On rank 20-10 yes on rank 9-1 no
---
honestly people don‚Äôt acknowledge nurse never should have been included.  Necessary, yes, but omegablink or five blink nurse with devour hope, ruin, noed, and barbecue and chili is ridiculously overpowered.  Some of her add ons just need adjustments, not heavy nerfs.
---
Nice tunneling gay f*ggot check your stained sweaty underpants...Probably read my bio :/

It definitely adds some nice Spice, but I don't exactly find it that fun, and no no, it's alright, Im just way too damn sensitive, You seem like a great guy &lt;3
---
Ohhh kkkk I didn‚Äôt know there was audio in the video. It‚Äôs portuguese
---
Is it just me or does it sound like she‚Äôs humming the godfather theme but with a little twist?
---
This game is poorly optimized across the board. It's even worse on PC. There is no reason this game should lock up 95% of my GPU resources.
---
nah ive had situations like this and its generally just particularly bad internet
---
Tum tums makes me scream
---
I hate him. You become exposed for 40 seconds, almost the same time as myers, it is extremely faster and easier to stalk with him and he can also 99%
---
Double pipping is easier for killer than survivor...please tell me youre joking.
---
Ok now i get what you mean
---
He sees your aura for a flash too, so you're exposing yourself as well.
---
Let‚Äôs just change the achievement to sacrifice all 4 survivors, this resolves the whole Mori issue that originally existed and honestly this still takes skill to achieve. Or they could just fix the pipping system  :|
---
What are the types of juke?
---
Lmaoo I high doubt you're ten years older than me. My age would definitely surprise ya. Im just at the age where I dont wanna deal with assholes and I'm gonna put them in their place. I truly believe this sub is full of young teenage boys who think they can talk to people however they want.. I've ran into some pretty shitty dudes on here calling me all sorts of things because of my opinion on a video game. So I gotta keep the guard up and put these young ones in their place.
---
i don‚Äôt condone it, but wraith‚Äôs mori would be better for the role.  the tragic drag back...
---
Hell's yeah! 
---
Every red rank killer runs pink and purple addons why cant survivors run their best addons? It's called balance lol
---
Well dont come at me stupidly and I'll remain chill..  teenagers aren't gonna talk to me reckless..it is what it is..
---
But there shouldn't be a "both sides" in this argument. You are going to be playing killer and survivor for the achievements. I can't imagine someone going "these killer achievements are hard, but at least the survivor achievements are hard too now!" Like, where is the benefit?
---
You didn't put anyone in a better position than they were without the proposed change.
---
It's just a fact dude lol largely because survivors compete for the emblems to an extent. There's not an unlimited amount of Altruism for instance
---
Unfortunately I am one that has fallen for BHVR‚Äôs cosmetics and have shelled out probably 7bills ok this shit when I could have been buying a new tv or some other random thing. I love the game, but I agree with everything that is posted by OP..
---
Edit: I have a spending problem.. üòî
---
You can‚Äôt actually be trying to argue that double pipping as killer is harder than double pipping as survivor. 
---
I‚Äôve seen it all.
---
What red rank killer doesnt bring their best shit ?
---
Make more friends, lol
---
I don‚Äôt like fucking gens for 80-240 seconds, also I like when little survivors shouting insults at me in post game chat because of camping (seriously there‚Äôs a scratch marks all over my butt)
---
Well, 100% extra bloodpoints every fucking round is nice.
---
But the real reason is that killer is so much more mechanically satisfying.
---
The problem with a group of four is that they feel like they lost if one of them died.
---
LoL.
---
Dude I have 600 friends on ps4... but I'm picky about who I play with and their play style so my circle of dbd friends is small.
---
Of course they all had balanced landing and one of them brought a haddon field offering
---
an illegal perk which according to the survivor's rulebook for killers makes you a "toxic camper noed tunneler noob bastard who should be gunned down the street like the degenerate you are".
---
That is literally what I just said. Yes. 
---
Double pipping as killer is easier than double pipping as survivor.
---
That would be it.  She was from ‚Äúnear Sao Paulo‚Äù.  I never knew that, even as someone who can speak no Portuguese, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to recognize the two dialects as belonging to the same language.  I suppose a lot of people who don‚Äôt speak English would get the same impression I did from hearing a Souther Good Ol‚Äô Boy and a Scotsman speaking.  How is it speaking to a Brazilian Portuguese, are they hard to understand as an old world Portuguese?
---
Sorry if these questions seem too personal, I just have a strong interest in accents.
---
Cannibal, simply because of BBQ perk.  It‚Äôs very strong and essentially makes playing killer into a full time 2x BP event.
---
They aren‚Äôt your friends they r randoms that you stuck with
---
fair point
---
PC in a nutshell?
---
How am I supposed to hit grapes when the skill check needle is having a stroke?
---
are you playing a Roblox ripoff
---
Yep. That‚Äôs why you never play high rank gameplay after rank reset. It‚Äôs absolute aids.
---
Im sorry but i have to disagree. I never have issues double pipping as survivor. Maybe in my personal experience its easier.
---
Maybe you just got REKT
---
Maybe death is an escape.
---
No way Nea‚Äôs touching me now
---
Second one looks a loot like billy boy.
---
Or even better, when you're not swf but have a common knowledge of how to play this game and help teammates so you instantly get accused of being "sweaty tryhard swf". Even more so, if the killer is a streamer, them and their chat will yell SWF over everything.
---
Me and i would assume huge chunk of the player base? Like not everyone plays this game to win no matter what, some people want to play weaker killers because playing top 3 is boring. Then i take wraith get farm map and 2 guys insta heal against me first time i down them and teabag at exit gates calling me trash. Not that fun i must say. Most people will jump on nurse after that then people will play against nurse bring insta next game and cycle continues.
---
All this time to learn the game and you still makes these kinds of comments? Disappointing. 
---
Instaheal is stronger than most killer add ons. And the fact that you can run it four times is super lame. 
---
‚ÄúBaLaNcE‚Äù

Just sucks because you denied them pips and points all because you didnt want to actually play the game, just wanted to depip yourself.

See if he‚Äôs dumb enough to tell you which branch, then his SO. I kinda doubt he‚Äôs being honest, but you never know with stupid.

No one escapes crutches.

Also, P3 Claudette gets bloodied dark clothes which gives her near predator level visibility on dark maps with default brightness.
---
I was defending the chest. Not my fault they stuck around.
---
Oh my god, is this that shit again?
---
You‚Äôre really on some shit. Nobody came at you and you went straight to fuck boy lol. I bet you tbag the exit gate and then talk shit about toxic killers
---
Holy shit, a yellow mori kill?!?! That‚Äôs rare as hell, mainly cause no one uses them.
---
Ugh.
---
The dailies demand blood
---
I like how he went from ‚Äúha ha ha‚Äù to ‚Äúoh fuck oh fuck‚Äù
---
DCing is toxic, but so is that ping. Holy shit. I‚Äôd quit that game honestly.
---
I‚Äôll take the buff only because it‚Äôs a useless, meme perk. 
---
But I‚Äôd definitely run it a lot more if it charged faster.
---
Stuns you, obviously.
---
Well good news that is probably the last pallet, bad news they have finished all the gens and are t-baging at the exit gate.

I dont think you understood what i said. I want both sides broken shit to be removed. Syringe and Nurse can go. I play survivor to just not in red ranks so i cant tell how it looks there but i also dislike going against spirits and nurses or instasaw. I wish to break that cycle of broken shit for broken shit that hurts people who just want normal games.

---
\*oink\*
---
no PC, this was some months ago
---
I don't use moris ever. Pink ones need to be removed until they're changed to only work on death hook survivors. And i rarely use strong add-ons. I was actually telling someone in twitch chat a few days ago that I don't use the plague's add-ons that increase the power of vile purge because it's unfair cheese
---
i also rarely use strong shit as survivor. the sheer number of instaheals i have rotting on my stripper cop tapp is nuts
---
but go off being a victim i guess

Fuck em'. You made it. You're good pal.

I hate both Red forest as both surv and killer.
---
this comment successfully committed nose exhale, thanks @EAO70
---
They sold me for the commodius I was carrying.
---
back when I only main survivor I honestly thought I was being nice and giving the killer a hit and some free bloodpoints before I left.
---
Now that I play both I can pretty certainly say that it definitely looks like the opposite of that, especially if they're teabagging
---
It relies on the killer being good, where good players will pay attention to how survivors act. If a Survivor is injured and constantly looking backwards, it's a very good chance they have Dead Hard, amplified by it's near constant presence in every game. It also relies on the killers knowing how to counter Dead Hard, which is to not lunge, but to get close enough and swing normally, as swings can be reacted to with Dead Hard. Waiting until you are close makes your attack impossible to react to with Dead Hard, forcing the survivor to take the down or waste Dead Hard to gain a bit of distance.
---
Faking Dead Hard is constantly looking backwards while injured, so that the killer will get closer to you, thinking you have Dead Hard, but using the lack of distance to 360 better. It's easier to juke a killer if you're right in front of them, since you vanish of their screen, forcing them to guess where you are.
---
Ugh I‚Äôm done here. You‚Äôre an immature prick
---
thanks :)
---
You're right that it depends on the killer. The least fun I've ever had in a dbd match was against a plague in the Memorial Institute.
---
&gt; i can't remember the last time i played a killer match without an instaheal in it. they're like the fucking plague right now
---
&gt; but go off being a victim i guess
---
lol ok kid.
---
I havent used it yet. I still need to get Adam.
---
plague is extremely weak on that map
---
I'm EU, we dont get too many nurses

The likelyhood of BHVR giving a shit is the same as winning the lottery though.

Tombstone+hair Myers getting gen rushed
---
Shit, that‚Äôs a day before my birthday. Early present I guess.
---
Yessir what will most likely happen is the message will be deleted and he‚Äôll get a warning sent to him through email and an alert on psn
---
AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT
---
Lmao the video is much more fun to watch instead of skipping but ok.
---
I think it's largely due to the fact his not the most viable of killers and he also has the option to farm faces from the original 4
---
Wow that was close

Time to retrap this bad  boii

Looks like its hunting season boys!!! Let see if we can hear them crying!!!

Thank you ghost-daddy

Aw~

Well odds are that survivor is healthy, so they‚Äôll both get away

lol fair enough

Very nice

I'd played on console for a while but I decided to buy it for pc. Its one of my first few games on PC so I'm still learning the controls (I barely play on my pc so I'm not used to m/k) and in end game chat this picks starts ranting about how I'm a waste of oxygen. I don't see why people feel the need to take this game so seriously.
---
Maybe follow them? Just an idea.
---
How inconsiderate of you
---
*sometimes*
---
They are fixing it if im not mistaken. The matchmaking will soon average their ranks and put them against a killer with that average rank. Cant remember where i saw that, but im pretty sure the Devs said they are working on it.
---
You can't get banned for camping those people are dumbasses
---
Idk man maybe you should kill the other 3 and lay them on the floor in front of the hook to start a party
---
Lmaooo bro chill out. Just giving you a tip since you posted a meme insinuating certain survivor perks are op. Not telling you how to play at all, if you wanna tunnel and eat BT and DS left and right, go for it.
---
I WISH I COULD BASH THE FACE IN OF EVERY PERSON THAT USES SELF CARE
---
Freddy players:Don‚Äôt change Freddy he is awesome.
---
Rank 20 survivors and tunneling killers: I can fix that.
---
Yay! Let‚Äôs hope for the best then
---
&gt; why would I not do it?
---
because this will severely harm your bp and emblem progress
---
Oh so you are why I can't get into a game just because I have the nerve to play with my friends.
---
Ooo nice
---
Dude... Spirit is a monster on console ...
---
ty :D
---
This game is often unfair. Rank reset is the worst of it. Besides, it's not like OP had red ranks in his match so I really don't see the huge deal. Better competition, take the challenge.
---
Well thats good because its someone who isnt doing anything the whole match, and you wont get blinded as long as you face a wall or be careful in certain situations when picking someone up.
---
I‚Äôd agree to this if it was the old DS but that is my opinion on it honestly
---
&gt; your teammates walk (not run) over to the hook, and save you only after you hit tier two
---
or they walk over, crouch behind something doing nothing until you die because they're waiting for the killer to move\leave
---
Have you considered uninstalling the game? Can‚Äôt get banned if you don‚Äôt play it
---
You still call it a PS4 after 14 hours? I call it a space nuke
---
i was not prepared to interpret the signal my eyes sent to my brain on this one.
---
Then don't get mad when people DC, they can play however they want or like
---
Also dont call me buddy, I could be your father.
---
&gt; I would actually say the exact same thing if it was the other way around lol.
---
Well, okay, well fair play then. Can't argue against consistency 
---
&gt; Just take the match as a learning experience and keep getting better.
---
This is my main issue: acting as if a new player can properly learn from something like this.
---
It's like tossing a duke ellington piece to a 6th grader and saying "just learn lol"
---
&gt; But what do you want?
---
I'm not claiming I know what the solution is, or that there is properly one. Just saying that new players should be miffed by this and ideally they wouldn't have to deal with it. I know that some ranking changes are coming up, including a longer season, and I think even that would mitigate this somewhat
---
I'm aware this is from a video or something but that is not how a book works wtf
---
Camping = Doing something ingame which is a legit strategy that has counterplay / gets supported by perks like Insidious. Camping can make you win a game against people that play overly altruistic.  
---
DC'ing = Ragequitting because you don't like that the guy with the job to kill you is trying to secure the kill on you. You are fucking your teammates up and you are doing something which can be punished through an ingame report.  
---
How stupid do you have to be to compare these things?
---
Blair witch chapter confirmed
---
You see it. Ah ha ha
---
Rip me I guess
---
Wait, what does crouching have to do with that? Does crouching not set off her traps?
---
Does it have to be that small on you‚Äôre screen? Please say no...
---
Twitch chat will regurgitate whatever bullshit their fav streamer spews out, there are so very few streamers who don't complain at absolutely anything that happens in the game that it's sad, it's like they live in a constant state of paranoia and stress and the chat just enables them.
---
Run spirit when there is no pallet and üëç
---
I only ever consider BM as toxic, tea bagging, flashlight spamming, pointing toxic, SWF is a function of the game and even as a killer main I think it could be made better for survivors, SWF isn‚Äôt toxic and I‚Äôm not sure who is out thinking it is.
---
Yep. Go play a game where the devs had communication in mind during development.
---
"BUT MUHH SURVIVORZ"
---
Killer mains have really great arguments
---
I feel ofended that you mock my people
---
Same thing occured on my game
---
Bloodpoint gain in game never changes. Let‚Äôs say you used an offering that gave you 100% more deviousness. You would earn deviousness normally but once the game ends whatever amount of deviousness bloodpoints you have is multiplied by 100%. So if you earned 8000 deviousness bloodpoints in game, you would get 16000 bloodpoints in deviousness once the game ends. The most bloodpoints you can earn in each category is 8000, nothing can change it.
---
He P1, not even a baby lmao.
---
Also I gotta ask the point of Thrill of the Hunt on its own.
---
Me and a friend joined a match and we both escaped and the killer had messaged me and started calling us toxic douchebags who he wish he got killed
---
I personally only wait at the gates to make sure everyone is getting out.
---
I wanna help everyone, but I also wanna be close enough to escape in case the killer is coming to murder my face off
---
No...
---
It's something survivors will learn to expect and it's not like the process will take very long, I'm thinking more along the lines of reversing milliseconds when it comes to the chasing of the survivors. The process of reversing a gen would probably take a lot of actions from the killer to actually happen. Maybe he would need to set traps that the survivors would need to walk past in order to fill up a bar that the survivors would get no negative effect. There would need to be lot to do this
---
Not if BHVR did something about campers. They literally just have to make the entity stop or slow considerably for the person on hook. That would mean even slower gens would still get done.
---
"gen rushing" = playing the game how it's meant to be played aka just doing gens.
---
One buddy + Me can do 4 gens while one guy is getting facecamped, if he doesn't sacrifice himself.  
---
So this should still be fine.
---
Games are over too quick. Especially if you don't run ruin.
---
You can't be banned, but it makes you a complete dick and ruins the game for everyone, including yourself. I suggest you stop.
---
Yep, the RNG of the boxes can be either the strongest part of Pig (if you get unlucky and need to search all the boxes before you find the key) or the weakest (if you find it on the first box).
---
I love yo have fun that's why I play video games to have fun..
---
Wat
---
K
---
Yeah crouching doesn't set off her traps which is why urban evasion is a good counter to hag.
---
It's not their fault for having friends. I can see why some people think like you, but what you need to realize is that it's all BHVR's fault for creating a game with no SWF in mind, balancing it around that and later on adding said feature. Right now there is no in-between: You either have absolutely zero means of communication (solo-queue) or you can coordinate extremely well over discord/whatever with your friend(s). Ultimately though, it's the devs fault not the players so blame who you gotta blame.
---
lol I actually tried it when they first introduced them on PTB, they were horrible.
---
But you needed it
---
Damn dude, you‚Äôve got weapons grade autism there.
---
Try not to let it slip that you‚Äôre a survivor main or people will build strawmen to insult then downvote u

I have played for a year and I‚Äôm at like 150 hours. My best friend started the same day he‚Äôs in 350 hours and his girlfriend started 6 months ago and is at 600 hours. I don‚Äôt have the time, sadly
---
‚ÄúCalling him Trash‚Äù
---
Well I can‚Äôt disagree with them
---
You sound very new to the role still.  Over time you'll learn why camping is such a piss poor strategy.  You'll lose game after game doing it against even halfway decent survivors.  You'll get terrible blood point rewards keeping your characters weaker than they can be and you'll struggle to rank up doing it.  Also it's just not fun at all to simply stand there staring at a hook.  As you become more experienced you'll see that pressuring gens and initiating chases with new survivors is the way to play.  You'll win so many more matches dude.  It's all good though.  Everyone camps initially while they're still figuring out how to play the game and no you can't be reported for doing it.  Camping and all the negative benefits that come along with it is punishment enough, the devs don't care if you do it.
---
I play ps4 so nurse isnt my issue... pigs addon that let's you see auras when crouched is a pink addon.. the question is do you actually play killer???  I finite tier 3 is rough, tombstone is rough if there isnt a locker nearby... I'm not arguing with your stupid opinion.
---
What the Hell is ‚ÄúKiller Diversion?‚Äù Missed skill checks or something?
---
Prayer beads spirit with this bug makes things even easier
---
Only if we finally get 2 killers.
---
Not everyone on the sub watches the youtube cartoon, dude.
---
At this point i disconnect from any killer with more than 60 ping, its really just not worth playing a game where i know im just gonna get mad because i get hit through a pallet or get commando pro‚Äôd.
---
Nahh if you actually talked to me you'd understand my sarcasm.. but these are just dry words with no context so you create your own emotion for each one. It is what is... its DBD reddit dont take it to serious bro. I'm here laughing at you thinking you gonna change my thoughts with your sermon.
---
Yup
---
Funny enough I play both sides just as much, Though haven't played killer much since the long as heck wait times
---
this is one of the most toxic things I've seen good god
---
They won't do that though because then the brand new players still learning the game that camp or the longer term players that are simply not good enough to get a kill without doing it would raise hell.  Devs have heavily deincentivized camping by punishing bps, ability to rank up and even creating perks to punish it such as decisive rework but beyond that I wouldn't expect them to ever take a hard line stance against it.  As shitty and unoptimal a playstyle it is technically it's their choice to play that way.
---
You are a good man. Thank You.
---
Omg this makes so much sense now... I've been having super bad unfun matches damn gens are giving me away?
---
Your math is absurdly off.  You do not have time to pop 4 gens yourself with only two people during a facecamp.  Start to finish a facecamp will guarantee a full solo gen per person.  You aren't doing two a piece in that time period.
---
It‚Äôs meant to bypass when the killer is using the perk Hex: Ruin. It makes it so good skill checks actually reduce the repair on a gen, and Greats just prevent the reduction instead of giving a boost. Gen tapping makes it so those skill checks won‚Äôt happen, but yea does take longer to repair. Ideally you want to practice to get Greats even when Ruin isn‚Äôt used so you get the boost.
---
I'm so fucking done with this subreddit, I'm gotta head out
---
Diversion is a meme perk but you have no clue how good that shit will get killers
---
Terrible killer, had to of heard the gen going so she should of kicked it.
---
Good meme, downvoted because of title tho, sorry man even ironically it‚Äôs pretty cringe
---
This game brings out the best and worst in me I must admit.
---
Thanks, I hate it.

All Myers had to do was switch targets at the basement.  He was T3 so it didn't matter who else he targeted.  He cucked himself so hard by playing into that borrowed time.  Easily should have been able to trade someone out
---
But this is the problem, they cater to cry babies and people that are "not good enough" which is why those types never actually get better at the game and it just creates a shitty circle. Granted I know you're not agreeing with that playstyle but I'm of the opinion that it should be punished even further. Like I say, as long as it's done in a way where survivors can't exploit it and that it shouldn't be in effect during end game collapse becuase that is when camping is a legit strategy sometimes. Bur I know BHVR will never do it which sucks because it does suck the fun out of things.
---
There is a "leave" button right in game that you can hit any time. You can even spectate and participate in the chat after you hit it.
---
Sounds like an ingame feature to me
---
Moonlight uh
---
Keep doing these, not only are they funny but it helps get it out there.
---
it never was. it was overused from the start. Startoff to literally any normie meme
---
hey dumbass, fix your grammar, i'm not worried about my feelings getting hurt, and just because i don't like pig doesn't mean i'm bad at her your moron. and yes you did, you are literally being the stubborn one in this debacle, please stop trying to enforce the fact that "my opinion is wrong" and stop replying, and get a life.  
---
like seriously, this is over my opinion on pig, how much of a toxic pig main do you need to be, to be as stubborn as you are right now. calm your tits and continue browsing memes and have fun, instead of getting pissy and being a moron towards me.
---
Awesome.
---
The problem is the killer is basically guranteed 1-2 kills for doing barely anything
---
Even easier for them if they run NOED/Ruin
---
Predator would be badass but these Area 51 memes are dead af
---
&gt; No matter what you do, you'll be accused of camping and tunneling.
---
Scott Jund was playing Huntress once and hooked a survivor then went to a locker in a jungle gym to reload. The hooked survivor's SWF friend was injured and ran in to get the save immediately and passed right in front of the same jungle gym so Scott hit him with a hatchet. The hooked guy goes "camping killer" and they both disconnected lmao
---
I've only had to deal with a missing UI in this game twice, and it was miserable each time. The most recent time was hilarious though. Had a Meg suicide on her first hook and then proceed to spam me with messages during the game letting me know how trash I was at red ranks to be gen tapping at red ranks. I mean, it was that or just take a chance and blow up every single gen I touched.
---

You already found my post, but here‚Äôs the link anyway:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ccvclx/check_one_off_the_list_of_stressful_achievements/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
I'm with you, I can't stand camping from a killer or survivor viewpoint.  It's a strategy for someone that has no strategy basically.  I'm just being realistic and realistically I just don't see them ever going through with it.
---
I hope they bring back the Halloween theme from 2017 man what a banger
---
Haha thank you, I got Adept Shape today and remembered this meme.
---
If we go by a hypothetical scenario where the killer facecamps the first person he gets, that would still guarantee 120 seconds + chase time for 3 survivors to do gens.  
---
And even then there was probably made gen-progress before the first gen happened.
---
This is enough time to finish the game.   
---
Enough time to leave before NOED even comes into play.   
---
But yes, it usually guarantees you 1 kill. Maybe 2 if the survivors play bad.  
---
But it will still be a depip, which usually is seen as a loss.
---
Thank you for the explanation
---
That was my worry. People assume you're just bad at the game when it's not your fault üòÇ
---
it will be either Trapper, Wraith or Leatherface, though imo Trapper is a bit better because he can at least block off certain loops while Wraith and Leatherface don't really have much going for them
---
Like I said, I'm willing to make a concession. 2 person teams. I'm not a monster.
---
Yeah lol, I saw your comment on my post and got worried you were about to meme swipe me. That was my first post to ever really take off. 
---
Myers best killer.
---
We need another summer event tbh
---
did you just rape him in the grass
---
It's fairly recent, and awards you a share of your team's generator and totem work while you're keeping the killer busy in a chase.
---
Thanks, I love it.
---
I dont know if you're serious or not, but he was joking.
---
Nah, I've seen a lot of post in this sub that basically say the same bs "Muh, it's ok to DC on Nurse guys".
---
Oh nah haha, just wanted to send that meme to one of my friends who plays DbD. And yes, Myers definitely best killer.
---
What's even worse is how hard it is to ignore it. Was playing a game the other day where I closed hatch on the last person and the two doors were relatively close together. After no door lights for the first half I started walking back towards the hatch because I remembered seeing a key in the lobby. Turned around to check if they were behind me and suddenly saw their body opening an exit gate through the light.
---
* Screenshot highlighting a salty chatlog.
---
it‚Äôs july Ed!
---
Once the hooked person dies he's not gonna stay there. I've had games where this exact scenario came into play and the survivor is going to die before all the gens are done. Then the killer goes to find the next person and facecamps them. I can see 4 gens being done maybe by the time the hooked person dies but there's no way all 5 are getting done.
---
Yup but you have to be in direct line of sight in between the killer and a generator.  Its been going on for a while, I just managed to take a picture today.
---
The first introduction of the servers were just to see if the servers could even hold the game and let it be playable, it's not for testing the gameplay of it, just if there could be any gameplay at all.
---
Thats the new Meg skin right?
---
Thanks! :)
---
Playing solo survivor is more frustrating than playing killer. Change my mind.
---
How dare you not want to play against a group of 3-4 people with an enormous advantage over you?
---
s/
---
She should just headbutt it in one swift movement
---
Pebble isn‚Äôt THAT bad. That buff sounds great and I would love it tho
---
I get these micro lags aswell, for example the first swing as killer always lags me, then the game usually runs fine
---
Because the game isn't balance arround the unlikely scenario where every killer just queues up, find 1 person, downs that person, and facecamps it from 1 to 0?
---
This isn't how majority of killers play.  
---
This isn't what they balance their game around.
---
In the original context he's pointing out all the trash everywhere.
---
&gt;!Guess you could argue not much has changed !&lt;
---
This is exactly what I told my friend.  "Welp can't unsee that, time to die survivor."
---
You might not but I enjoy his videos
---
Im with you, im with you, im with you. Okay, you lost me. Develop a strategy to support your killer. If you can't chainsaw across the map, play the gens in a way that makes them 3 gen themselves at the end
---
What rank is your killer bruh? If youre in brown/yellow that doesnt really count. Also what killer do you usually play? If youre using a meta killer youre kind of proving my point.
---
I was thinking that with Bloodlust becoming more unnecessary, they could apply it to killers outside of a chase.
---
For instance, every 30 seconds without spotting a survivor, the killer gets a 5% boost to movement speed which is immediately lost upon starting a chase.
---
You can even hear the specific gear noises when survivors are working on it
---
I didn't get it.
---
I‚Äôm in red ranks and I play all killers. I was playing Pig all day yesterday and I don‚Äôt think I lost any games
---
Hes my favorite too. And hees gettin a chrome mask soon
---
That's simply due to the poor optimization as we know it.
---
The PS4 is a higher performing machine than the Xbox tho, but I'm a PC player now mostly.
---
Trapper has an amazing advantage state when he works out and Wraith has the mobility to always be productive and in the action.
---
Leatherface just has nothin' :(
---
I play on xbox and my privacy settings and my friends are tight so the only way the could be able to figure out was that we joined the lobby at the same time before anyone else
---
uuhhhhhhh
---
Something to do with uncapped framerates in lobby menus and title screen, once I'm in a game I have zero noise, before that though it's so loud...
---
Ya, needing a strategy is a good point. We dont want all killers to be able to just M1 the entire game and get 4ks. So I see what youre saying. 
---
My issue mainly stems from the fact that survs dont really need a good strat, or even good items/add-ons to be able to perform well during a match. Where as in higher ranks a killer needs both to be able to expect to do well.
---
get headphones bitch
---
Defending the flag and camping are two different things. The camped survivor literally cant do anything about it. The other 3 can, but the one being campped can only sit on the hook and watch, or kill themselves. At least in COD, you, plus all 5 of your teammates can kill the person defending the flag, and take it back. Its impossible to stop a killer from camping a hook, and almost near impossible to get them off the hook if the killer is very determined to watch that one survivor die.
---
Thats an interesting idea. It would also help the lower tier killers apply map pressure when they dont really have anything in their kit to do that.
---
Already? Ok, thank you for the heads up at least
---
Ah, I see. I should have specified I was talking about Steam, I have no idea how that works on console. Lots of killer assume swf the moment the survivors play slightly decently anyway...
---
Wraith or Leatherface for sure
---
HELL NO
---
If I‚Äôm alone at a gate and team mates are still alive I‚Äôll hang out to see him if I need to save someone incase they get hooked
---
I was right behind the Myers he was blocking the gate when he was staring at them. I could have taken a hit and ran past him but he tiered up as I passed him and he downed me. It sucked.
---
Alright maybe I am lacking strategy and could be doing better.
---
For shits and giggles though have you considered then that Im not wrong or bad, but that you are simply better at the game than you realise? I mean, you cant balance the game to the bottom percent of players because it makes it too easy for everyone else, but you also cant balance for the top percent because that makes it to hard. After all most players are not in red ranks are they?
---
Nani the fuck
---
Nice wallpaper
---
Its only toxic when its 3 and they gen rush
---
Thank you, it's Firewatch inspired :)
---
I cant do it
---
Yeah, I think I remember reading that when the game became a PSPlus free title.  I was worried because the fans on my PS4 were spinning up like a jet engine... and of course I couldn't get into a game to save my life at the time, but fortunately that got patched :P
---
Myers
---
You forgot to make this a shitpost
---
You can use any of the Memento Mori offerings (Cypress, Ivory, or Ebony) OR you can use a perk that allows you to Kill survivors (Myers has a special item that lets him Kill as well, but he's the exception.)
---
Currently, those perks are Rancor (a Spirit teachable) and Hex: Devour Hope (a Hag teachable.)
---
Luckily, because Hex: Devour Hope is one of the Hag's perks, you can use it on her without any offerings or having to level her up! You just have to get five tokens on it, which you get by following the instructions on the perk description.
---
I legit didnt know this was a thing until now. Someone mentioned earlier that you should be able to "tip" a portion of your match points to a good player and I think thats a really good idea. Not mandatory but a cool way to say thank you to a player that helped you out.
---
I love the Nea=Entity jokes from the Samination series tho
---
Do the patch notes ever get released early as a "Here's what's coming up next!" thing? I recall something like that happening for Ghostface's "Hotfixes" like your stealth being cancelled if you get pallet-slammed and making the detection zone bigger.
---
Like the echo of their scream isn‚Äôt even over and they‚Äôre out and running
---
Quick google turns up some streamer jackass who got banned awhile back.
---
The days when Hangman's trick wouldve been the best perk in the game.
---
Oh i didn‚Äôt realize black lock meant the hatch. Thats not bad then. What is the earliest the hatch can spawn like could you still find it with a couple more than one player survivor left?
---
why did you posted his meme then?
---
What rank r u?
---
Because any rank above 8 or 6 have nurses that are GOD TIER
---
agree
---
Is this some kind of joke?

You're gross

Reminds me of Melanie Martinez

I never run ruin unless i'm playing Trapper because he has zero early game.
---
What is that black line?
---
Just make it yourself and place a white square over the text area in any photo editor, Google drawings being easiest
---
Well, in all of my experiences of red ranks, there have been: Billy‚Äôs, nurses, sometimes trappers and the occasional ghostface 
---
And they have all been super good
---
Did it
---
I think after a blink, everyone in a 128m range should become exposed for 100s.
---
I only get the sound when the game boots, before you actually press "X" to login or whatever. After that it does alright.
---
Keanu Reaves you say?
---
No mither ALONG with self care is meta? üòÇ someone obviously didn‚Äôt pay attention
---
Hex: Devour Tide Pods was in a monto video I believe and that's my favorite name I have ever seen but I did go against a killer on Xbox whose name was Plageypukepuke
---
It's a *useable* perk. It's nowhere near the likes of unusuable garbage like Left Behind, No Mither, Up The Ante, or Boil Over. But with that being said it's really weak and has a lot of limitations that really don't need to exist which stop it from even being used for fun.
---
I main trapper :3
---
The New freedy, doctor and clown
---
With Melanie Martinez's hair
---
Lots of ppl run them so I dont think they do in practice. But I believe BHVR said that they wont *unban* you if the anti cheat thinks youre cheating using icons. So its a use at your own risk type of deal.
---
I actually have no idea: I did this in paint so I might‚Äôve accidentally put that in somehow
---
It rarely actually does, and even then any killer who would chase a survivor to the point where they waste that much time is bad. 
---
The perks needs another use because after the 1st dead hard it's worthless to dodge.
---
I thought it was pointing at something. Spent a good 5 mins on that. Not a proud moment.
---
Camping leatherface became a thing for a reason
---
He was probably playing on mobile!
---
I think it probably stems from most players on this subreddit being PC players. If you had said that comment on r/xboxone then I highly doubt you would've been downvoted.
---
I hate so much when, for example, you are going at 30 milles x hours, and then you, without any smooth, turn to 25
---
How is him using his add revenue any different than you spending your paycheck???

When are they coming?

This feels reminiscent of smite or any mobile game and I don‚Äôt know how I feel about that honestly

No0b3 more specifically
---
Or I just log in and receive it and get off, and if you say I have to play a certain amount to receive it it becomes a chore which is worse
---
you can share them yes, but not repost them when you're not the original poster, that's not a very cool thing to do
---
What? Are you talking about the lag spike when i was running?
---
DbD cross platform?
---
Remember that BPs come in categories, so doing all five gens by yourself wont net you more points than the category will allow. It helps to make sure you do a little bit from each category so that you arent wasting time doing an activity that you can no longer get points in. Also look out to see if they are using BP multipliers because I think the post game screen reflects that. Meaning you could have gotten around the same amount of points but because of their offering they will end up with more.
---
Yeah! You were fast then when the perk ended!
---
IT'S HERE! 
---
but no seriously, there is no cross platform :)
---
Unless you have BL.
---
I actually use him quite a lot. I only use Clown, Spirit, Myers and Huntress on rotation (mainly). Clown is extremely underrated. I run Distressing, Colorophobia, Nurses Calling and Sloppy Butcher with some decent add ons and it works wonders.
---
In saying that I'm one of those rare people who tries to stay between rank 6-12 because I find games more fun around those ranks. When I was a rank 1 for seasons on seasons end it still was solid but if you were up against a group of solid survivors then it was a lot harder.
---
so... do u like the chapter?
---
*Gives high-five*
---
The 3 people who will make the entity feel their wrath
---
And everyone still used decisive and mettle of man. Who fuckin cares, people play how they want, both sides need to just get over it.
---
Yea, not a fan of killers with high ping hosting lobbies, hence the 4 gens left and 3 dead survivors. Killer was running ruin, overcharge and pop goes the weasel. Anytime we went back to a gen the game would lag and we‚Äôd miss the skill check and they‚Äôd basically be completely reset.
---
Go for it, I already did.
---
It's always like this, actually. You can typically see a small part of a Survivors body on a gen, regardless of position. It makes it easy to tell who is trying to genrush without Discordance.
---
It's so cheese, I hate it. But it lets me deal with toxic Survivors so...
---
If you're still having the problem:
---
Select DbD on steam-&gt;Properties-&gt;Local Files-&gt;Verify Integrity of game files
---
I had this problem twice, this solved it both times. :)
---
yours makes noise?
---
Ya agreed. The Halloween update did a lot to prevent every game from becoming a tour of every palette on the map, but some maps still feel like that some times.
---
I think in the next update they are making it so that anything that was completed while you looped the killer goes toward your personal emblems for pipping. 
---
And cleansing any totem (active or dull) will help you pip too.
---
Not sure if this is in the Tuesday update, or a future one.
---
Meh
---
It sucks, i miss the bp ranking
---
It‚Äôs all just preference. Not like there‚Äôs a abundance of inputs.
---
Just do it for Legion now.
---
It was close tho
---
Where did the Myers go to anyway? lol
---
HAAXX!!! 11!!! HITinG AccROsS Th3 MAp!!! AImbOt!!! 1!!1!
---
It's like this me and my mate are like around rank 12 and we just want have fun and we joke around 
---
But we've had killers dodge lobby's just because there's a 2 man swf and calls it toxic
---
Like we not hardcore professionals the most we get out is.
---
"You on a gen"
---
"Yeah"
---
"Cool"
---
"It's quiet think it's ghost Face" *random gets exposed*
---
"Alright cool"

But why presige Killers if you cant see It ingame in the 1st place?
---
Dwight is absorbing every locket in existence, in order to turn into iron dwight and making the entity feels his, and everyone's wrath!
---
No
---
When I play solo it takes time but 7 min. Play with 1 friends it is little bit faster usually 3~5 min . With 2 friends no game is found it take an hour to get 1 match.
---
Well that‚Äôs annoying
---
It‚Äôs sad that I‚Äôm a better leather face than hill billy lol
---
Really, god that‚Äôs like really bad even for DBD. I swear they fix one thing and break two other things.
---
Smaller chance of better addons that and you may like the bloody clothes
---
I wouldn‚Äôt pick them up. Moris, especially ebony, are super bugged and cause at least one survivor to DC /s
---
Honestly, until moris are reworked, and some of the best killer addons that are quite frankly easy to get, instaheals will stay the same and people will still use them. Why is it fair a huntress can run Iri head and an ebony, but a survivor cant use a one time use addon? Killers have tons of ways to instadown survivors, but survivors cant insta heal, once?
---
ye, its a returning bug
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm vegan.‚Äù
---
What if Ruin is just added baseline? It's a simple yet effective change, it won't solve the problem but I don't believe it's possible to get a perfect balance.
---
&gt; Survivors do need a good strategy 
---
Doing gens when not being chased is not a difficult strat to pull off. 
---
&gt;Looping the killer requires a lot of map knowledge 
---
Going to have to disagree with you there. Even after the last palette update there are still enough palettes on a map that you can run pretty well any direction and find one or a window to help you out. Memorizing where all the possible spawn locations are isnt necessary.
---
That‚Äôs basically the same situation me and my friend get then proceed to get called toxic. Not to mention we had a face camper then got called toxic after that match as well
---
Without loops, how are survivors supposed to have a chance? Just asking.
---
No thanks, as survivor , even Spirit feels waaaay top gasto at times
---
Same I have a around 1200 hours now got the game 8 month ago and also I never played a game that much before, still love it.
---
I never noticed until you brought it to my attention and now I am concerned for the health of my ps4. Should I keep playing dbd?
---
Everything is gross
---
"The dbd community" isn't really a place "dbd end game chat" or "end game chat" would've worked better
---
Helps me get to the basement undetected.
---
you‚Äôre probably rank 15 lol
---
Dude that is literally the bane of all killers not Nurse at Rank 1. 
---
The short answer is there really isnt a sure way. 
---
The long answer is a combination of capitalizing on survivor mistakes, minimizing your own, perk choice, and loop/map knowledge. Know which loops are mind game-able and which are safe.
---
I know exactly what you mean, just a really long sigh right in your ear, regardless of killer. It really freaks me out.
---
Have you played survivor before? Running pallet to pallet against a good killer is a death wish. Using them sparingly is a must when solo queuing. Even then, if your teammates use pallets you cant just run pallet to pallet cause you dont know which ones are peft. Like i said, there is more to it than you clearly understand.
---
THANK YOU lol at least somebody understood where I'm coming from üòÇ
---
I apologize OP. You fell victim to one of the classic blunders.
---
You're breathtaking!
---
That‚Äôs already in the game. You hardly get anything though.
---
The xbox jet kicks on every once and a while but it's not often.
---
‚ÄúGood!  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you!‚Äù- Emperor Entity
---
Holy crap
---
No I'm not.
---
How?
---
I just had a survivor complaining about bringing an ebony mori into the game. Telling me that I should "stop bringing a cruch and actually get good at the game". I played pig, hooked everyone twice and then slugged everyone before I used my mori. Only 1 gen was done and I didn't even have ruin, but obviously I am the one who needs to get good...
---
Life-taking?
---
I really want them to make this real, very cool
---
Oh Amanda you‚Äôre my Object of Obsession
---
ooh thank you!
---
Immersion is a helluva drug! Damn I hate scared players...
---
Woah...
---
That's like a whole new level..
---
Because if a survivor turns the corner without u seeing them thru the wall first you‚Äôd know it‚Äôs the killer
---
No bond would work on the killer
---
I don't feel like "just get over it" is the right response, it's an evolving game, if the community is unhappy with a perk, they should let it be heard. If they just need to suck it up, change won't come.
---
The players motto is always ‚ÄúAm I bad at the game? No the killers are just toxic‚Äù
---
Nah they weren't scared, they were just some assholes.
---
OP's not breathtaking.
