Thank you!

---
---
It's like half as long as a full generator if the killer has sloppy butcher, it takes FOREVER.
---
Oh I know it.
---
I thought I was reading about lights... what happened?
---
Don't lie to me!! You said you're too bih and left me there to die. Then tea bag the exit. Done make me angry!
---
Oh, word?! Thanks lol had no idea.
---
As a console player, can confirm!
---
I don‚Äôt get what you said. 
---

---
What I mean is, when the killer camps a hooked survivor for x amount of time, survivors  should get a speed bonus to repairing generators. This would discourage campers and encourage unhooked survivors to go for the gems instead of walking in circles or trying to bait a killer who won‚Äôt budge. If the killer gets a decent range from the hooked survivor for, let‚Äôs say 5 seconds, then the buff would reset back to 0.
---
Yeah, because the time between your first hit and when you down them should be 2 seconds in every situation otherwise you need to l2p..
---
It‚Äôs hard to listen when it‚Äôs a community filled with toxic 14 year olds who get pissed whenever they do anything other than work. Have you seen their posts about announcing cosmetics? It full of people getting mad for them for ‚Äúreleasing cosmetics not fixing bugs‚Äù.  BHVR does NOT have the best developers, and it doesn‚Äôt help when they first coded the game, they did a poor job of it. Since their code got fucked in the beginning it‚Äôs hard to fix things or even understand what‚Äôs causing them. DBD wasn‚Äôt meant to have a community of this size. If I‚Äôm not wrong this was their first standalone game. (They used to only port games)
---
I don't understand why "canonically smoked weed" is at the bottom and not top
---
Word.
---
Of course she does!  Haven‚Äôt you ever played **Bioshock**?
---
My mistake, I thought he meant hitting an injured survivor while carrying a light
---
:(
---
takes one minute to build up stage 1, then instantly disappears once you get stunned/remove one single pallet, useless
---
Why ;-;
---
I unlocked monitor and abuse when my Hag was level 20.  Shes now 45 and i still haven't seen it yet.  Im going to prestige 2 on her just so i have a chance at tier 3 Monitor. Ruin and Make your Choice
---
Which part is wrong? Or is the whole thing wrong?
---
Good riddance!
---
For someone who talks like they know everything about the game, you certainly don't know jack shit about the game. 
---
Sounds like you need to take a break and play something else.
---
That's a very valid criticism. I'd rather the game work than have some shades on ace
---
Yeah I know all the shit that causes issues but it's been 3 years and they are just starting on stuff. Ie freddy who should have been done months ago and I swear to God if they nerf him has hard as they nerfed legion this game will die. 
---
Let's hope dedicated servers fix things
---
Get spirit for spirit furry and also she‚Äôs bae asf
---
Uh.. no. It's not the "fangirls". Dont try to project the creepy oversexualization of killers into the ladies. Also we KNOW y'all gay men are here for the David and Myers.
---
God
---
I feel like Jane would also do something like that.
---
Game Developing companies aren‚Äôt just a whole bunch of coders. There is fields that each person works in based on skill. The people who make cosmetics aren‚Äôt the people who work on the code, cause they don‚Äôt know how. I hate people complaining about this because none of them know how companies are even organized. Design people work on design while devs work on developing. No-one is giving up their work for some shades.
---
 I p3d feng min and have every survivor perk in the game at rank 3 on her and I only have about 700 hours,  and I've also prestige other survivors and killers. It's not impossible. They are adding too many new perks though,  because the more perks they add that adds 9 more levels per character you want the teachable on *at least* so.. it gets bad.
---
Its bullshit on Nurse and Billy because it lets them mindlessly flowchart with their already powerful kits. Thats a problem with those killers tho, not the perk.
---
Its fine on the rest of the cast and not OP in the slightest.
---
Aah sloppy butcher, forgot about that
---
You forgot We‚Äôll Make It lol
---
We all see that big ole Pause symbol.
---
Yea if you're a wraith main, I would go for the spirit for spirit fury.
---
I don't understand what you're trying to say. That was me pausing it after I saved the clip from the match.
---
I Laphed
---
Exactly^
---
Go to party city where you belong
---
Oh right thanks, I kept pressing s again after letting go, one more thing, when do you swing your mouse left or right? is it on the direction, so d or a, or swing your mouse at a different time?
---
So you just put your team at a disadvantage then. Go play minecraft or something

---
Tyde Thyme is that you?
---
Lmfao boy no, definitely not $90 worth of DLCs, the DLCs are all cheap.
---
Lol, I had a camping and tunneling killer complain about DS and Dead Hard yesterday. He said he camped and tunneled to teach us cocky survivors about running bullshit perks and looping. The thing is the girl he initially camped and tunneled wasn't running those perks. He was also playing my main (Clown) so I reminded him that Clown is anti loop, he wouldnt have to worry about DS if he didn't tunnel and smart killers know to bait out DH...he stopped responding
---
Honestly the whole game is unbalanced to shit but im having a blast playing it regardless.
---
There's no problem with that (:
---
I mean you can already vault some windows like 8 times before it'll lock up cause entity blocker is bugged. Lol
---
Noed'ing someone headed for the gates
---
I main Plague and Spirit. I played Survivior a few days ago and the killer (which was a Nurse mind you) got pissy with my boyfriend for running this build he found from Monto that included dance with me and he was like "that's so bullshit how am I supposed to track you if you leave no scratch marks". 
---
Now my boyfriend is shy af and doesn't like to get into arguments so I responded with "how is he supposed to escape you if ur constantly blinking through walls and destroying all the counterplay we have to you?". He shut down the chat after that
---
Your tone seems very pointed right now
---
If I was tunneled to death hook there‚Äôs no harm to the team in me DC-ing. If I‚Äôm camped I‚Äôm not rewarding that with a kill. If I‚Äôm being fucked with and left as bait I‚Äôm not playing along with them.
---
I've always said if you DC you're worse than whatever thing you're complaining about. I never disconnected before unless it was actually my internet dying and I couldn't help it. I'd rather die on the hook and get points and jump back in
---
What if I'm wearing the Bunny Feng Min outfit? Then am I allowed into your basement?
---
Fuck yes
---
I can see it now, our future patch...
---
*-Ironworks second floor totem is now hidden better*

They look like big, good, strong hands, don‚Äôt they?
---
Oooh where is this?
---
Wraith x Nurse best ship!
---
I don't think they would add Vivien tbh they'd get a shitton of recognition if they added Tate or Violet
---
Imagine playing a 1v2 as killer with meta perks (BBQ‚Äôs aura reading especially being powerful when there‚Äôs two left) but still losing. And being looped as Plague? Where you only need to wait a little for them to be broken?
---

---
Ouch lol
---

---
I would not expect one until summer(July) bbq event.
---
If you say so
---
Thanks all
---
play with your food, you can end chases by turning invisible so free tokens
---
The only thing I don't like about it is often when I'm trying to 99% a hook, and then right at the last second I get a skill check. If I don't hit it, I make a noise indicator, and if I do it it, the hook drops, which is a noise indicator. :/
---
Some post by the devs somewhere about a week or two ago.
---
They‚Äôre adding it again now.
---
While I won't deny obvious DCs like when someone is downed, found first, etc, I can tell you not all are intentional.
---
I'm on console and have been repeatedly kicked from games lately, anywhere from mid chase to doing a gen, to nothing at all. As this happened no where near as much before I assume this is an issue with the game, I've been letting some killers know just so they know it wasn't intentional.
---
Sorry it's hampering your enjoyment, it's kind of happening to all of us at the moment.
---
Get wrecked, Laurie ;)
---
I've been wanting a Twisty cosmetic for Clown so bad
---
Is that a baby claudette
---
I‚Äôm not sure that that‚Äôs canon anymore. The official lore is that he dropped out at a rebellion against his CEO father that was trying to force Jake into his footsteps.
---
Then don't slug for a 4k? No one wants to do nothing for 4 minutes, can't blame people for DCing.
---
That‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúoriginal origin story‚Äù
---
The First thing I'm going to do is play "The helpful pig"
---
I will crouch around as pig and work on generators with the survivor and when all 4 are done, I will open the exit gates for them. Just for fun.
---
It really depends on both sides being able to make the most out of their resources and having good game sense. Survivors that don't work on gens, suck at chases, play too immersed, and/or get too altruistic can snowball the game in killer's favor. 
---
Killers that make tons of mistakes like not cutting corners in loops, bad tracking, respecting pallets, etc. can lose pressure and if it goes on too long can snowball the game in the survivor's favor. You wonder why sometimes getting one hook in 3 gens can basically lose the killer a ton of pressure.
---
Sometimes it's map RNG too for both sides too and sometimes there's not much each side can do.
---
Loved it! Awesome playing :)
---
1.The power, i think it sounds cool but the power should only work on healthy survivors, or if injured the distance where the killer can pull the survivor is less.
---
2. Perk one, slowing the survivor down after the first hit is too much, i would change it so that the mist effect is still on and that it would show the survivora location for 2 seconds.
---
3. Perk 2 (bait), idk this one seems too unfair to even have a chance to be considered in the game.
---
4. Perk 3 love the idea of the hooks change to noose and its effects, except the parts of being and not being highlighted, you ruined the perk with those last effects.
---
Overall looks like a nice idea for a killer
---
Thank you! ^_^
---
Eth Ytinte
---
Lullaby was the word I was looking for when I wrote this, thank you.
---
Glad it's not me, I really wasn't sure and I got into the game some time after Spirit release so I had no idea. Least I'm not as clumsy as I thought!
---
*oinks*
---
well am glad that some people on the other end understand it, its so strange too, thats why the collapse is going to help with that, after the gates are open and the survivors are really good, you as the killer can't do much unless you play a killer that hinders survivors or closes the gap
---
I usually use brutal strength, whispers, monitor, and enduring
---
Idk what I‚Äôm watching but I‚Äôm mesmerized
---
Now = past 4 months, at least. Since I bought it I have this problem
---
I believe I‚Äôve seen that killer ability idea before on a forum. For the life of me I can‚Äôt find it again, but regardless I like the idea.
---
Never made it in game as I recall just PTB. Didnt work out well at the time and has been reworked more to give us the end game collapse we have now which includes closing the hatch if I understand right.
---
If killer found hatch first they won* there was no chance, but the main reason was because it created a situation where survivors would just crouch around for ages because completing gens in a 1v1 is not possible if the killer is competent.
---
I figured it needed to have some way to mask the hooked survivor, but maybe it is overkill
---
Nurses calling on a plague, what a legend!
---
I get the feeling I've seen it too
---
There‚Äôs two types of Pig mains, passive friendly Pigs and absolute bloody nightmares
---
I understand when some DCs because of the game. The thing is, it's happening right after being downed, &amp; when found in lockers. It's not like it's happening mid chase, it's happening when the Survivor or Killer doesn't want to play anymore/rage quit. Killers DCing when they don't like a map is also something I am seeing a lot more. 
---
Like I said, I understand infinite loading and DBD kicking people just as the match starts, but mid chase/right after a down are too on the nose to be DBD messing up.
---
Happy cake day
---
....xD dead
---
No way to live
---
Had a group of swf had all gens done before I hit one.  Was so angry.
---
You go down to the basement and you'll only find hemlock bouquets.
---
This is why I always feel some type of way when people talk bad about perks. Majority of the time the perk doesn't work as planned (at least 80%). The amount of failed dead hards I see at rank 1 lol
---
I wasn't around then, but [on some maps](https://youtu.be/KqLrPLcqQAY?t=268) there were actually 10 (12?) generators spawned.

I would love an actual party system so when I play with friends we don‚Äôt have to constantly spam invite. Seems amazing the game has been out for so long with still no actual party system.
---
They put bbq on the shrine, what else do you expect? And btw, bbq is permanent, so it's not only for a week. So please, just dont ask for double BP.

If you‚Äôre being tunneled you are still giving your team free time to do gens lmao

Why is everyone asking for double BP? Bbq's on the shrine, and its permanent like wtf just get bbq
---
Good art! That Overwatch one especially. Which hero would make for the most interesting survivor, do you think? I'd be down for Hanzo or Symmetra.
---
That sweets perk is incredible. I think this killer would be difficult to put in game but I would love to see some of these kind of perks
---
Mori can be a drill doe to the ass.

---
Sure thing...
---
Correct. I knew that but isn't still the same rubber suit?
---
Just casual cheating. Yep.
---
Survive with friends. They probably knew eachother and thus the coordination
---
Game is doing great. Why do you feel that is shit though? I am assuming your opinion is very subjective because this is actually a fairly popular game well liked by many.
---
I don't think I am too upset with the killer having more control over the game. It adds to the whole power dynamic.
---
Ahhh shit here we go again...
---
I'm a simple girl, I see a prequel meme, I upvote.
---
I just use my PS4 controller for survivor lol
---
I don‚Äôt like the wasd for mobility and I don‚Äôt need the precision with a mouse for survivor  like I do with killer 
---
Though, I‚Äôd say just keep playing and the more you use it the better it‚Äôll get for you :)
---
So would using my computer be against the rules? Because apparently communication, something we‚Äôve had years prior to technology, is not allowed according to you.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs tough with matchmaking right now. Nice job getting the rank 8 though.
---
Makes the games more unpredictable and provides a level of tension that was missing before.
---
Been experimenting with killer lately, had a survivor DC right at the end of the match (about 15 minutes in), they were the last survivor, got caught because an attempted farm.
---
Yes! Please
---
And bunny Feng min!!
---
I'd put her on medicinal cannabis tbh
---
Start out with controller and slowly transition into mouse and keyboard. I use Xbox controller 100% as survivor and mouse and keyboard 100% when I play killer since it‚Äôs first person. Obviously m/k is better when using the flashlight but for everything else controller does the trick. 
---
This is my opinion but I think playing with controller is much easier. It‚Äôs also more relaxing since can chill on the couch or chair and not hunched over a desk. 
---
M/K has more sensitivity options and you can buttons such as mouse wheel to wiggle. People also use buttons to auto struggle so they don‚Äôt have to press the space bar like a madman.
---
SONO CHINO SADAME
---
All around me are familiar wra-ithes
---
Make hood and sweater one piece
---
And how would you ever enforce this?
---
I've been having issues as well. I used to gain almost 100k per match with just bbq. Now i'm lucky to get as much as a survivor does and that's with 3 hooks person, chases, hits, pallet breaks, gens kicked. I'm glad that my pig is fully maxed out. There's just no incentive to play killer for me right now. The BP gain is abysmal. I might as well play survivor and gain the exact same amount of BP as the killer. I don't think post game BP is being applied or perk specific bonuses are being applied at the end anymore because something is definitely off.
---
They will never ban it
---
@OP, this is also gonna burn you up inside a bit.
---
Not only does the hatch spawn after just three gens are done, allowing survivors to camp it at will with no repercussions (killers can't camp a hook are else they get penalized, but survivors can camp the hatch.. ok).. 
---
And not only are they making the hatch spawn and open for the last survivor no matter how many gens get done as an extra fuck you to killers who were wiping the floor with survivors (Completing three gens is too much work according to BHVR)...
---
But the cherry on top is that the rumor is that they are going to make survivors immune to being grabbed whilst jumping in the hatch. You'll have to make it to the hatch before them and close it to have any chance. And good luck with that - they'll have a head start on you unless you hook the third survivor near it. If a survivor is anywhere near it, they get the hatch no matter what.
---
Yes, a survivor will able to stand at the hatch during the end game (even if they've waited 2 minutes 59 seconds of the End Game Collapse), t-bag you, and then jump in right in the hatch in front of your face and even if you have been standing right there beside them you nor the Entity won't be able to do shit about it. You're just a useless zombie at their mercy. Gotta love that hatch balance. Completely fair. Gives killers an equal chance and getting that last survivor indeed.
---
And on the slight chance that you are so lucky as to find the hatch before the survivor is anywhere near it and manage to close it? They still get two exits to try to escape through since the gens are gonna be auto-powered even if they got no gens done.
---
To be clear - Even if zero gens get done, they still get three ways to escape you. So instead of just giving killers the chance to close the hatch 1 year ago when it was first introduced, they purposely didn't put it in the game for an entire damn year just so they can buff the ways survivors can escape you 1 year later.
---
And Remember Me is getting "reworked" too, so expect a nerf to that as well.
---
PLEASE! I HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING THIS FOR A YEAR.
---
Yea but I wanna get into mouse and keyboard ya know, but I think I might do this man thanks for the suggestion
---
Quad no mither hard counters plague
---
You sound like Kermit the frog
---
If they actually ban discord, then the game is dead. it will die. Like it or not you have to deal with it.
---
I tried to sound like the kid from the meme lol.
---
Well it depends. In the Olden days people left it 99% as a way to pop them all at the same time and be toxic because killers weren‚Äôt able to kick them back then. Nowadays I usually save it for adrenaline to kick in for me or someone else.
---
Lol. Kermit as the new killer confirmed?
---
Is this killer's fault that 4 guys wasn't able to make at least 2 gens? Hatch is a stupid mechanic (not killer main)
---
You're on to something...
---
What show is this from?
---
I'm aware. The outfit you're referencing has boob physics on the model so I assumed it was for Jane.
---
Hex: Swarm- Creatures of the entity take the form of bugs and linger and stick in swarms surrounding Generators, Hooks, Hex totems and chests. They emit an area of effect with a range of 4/8/12 metres. When a survivor enters this area of effect, bugs begin to form on the survivor and a meter begins to develop. It takes 15 seconds of prolonged exposure to finish the meter. When the meter is full, the survivor screams their location and gain the hindered and blind status for 60 seconds. This meter goes down for every second you are not in the swarms area of effect.
---
So lewd! It must be on r/dbdgonewild (not really but just memeing cus i think it's funny)
---
Every. Time. You know it's the Hag wtf!!
---
No, Rubber Man has no appearance. 
---
You‚Äôre thinking of the Addiction Demon.
---
I was being sarcastic, of course it‚Äôs aloud.
---
Literally just played two games with ruin and both games my teammates completely fucked around until someone found the totem. We lost a 4K then a 3K. Soooo irritating.
---
I feel like Tate would be too psychopathic to be a survivor.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it mean, remember we die
---
My bad, I've just recently woken up. For anyone else reading the official Dead by Daylight Discord has channels for KYF and SWF so... pretty sure they're ok with it

Idk why these cosmetics didn't come with Demise of the Faithful. They seem to fit the theme.
---
Oh, woopie! Another one of these posts, except less impressive, because last time I saw this there were 12 survivors. Fuck yes!
---
I agree, but also understand. But you also should adapt when playing with randoms by running perks that protect yourself. Like I'll run Bond so I can see when a survivor is running toward me with killer following. That level of sabatoge is ridiculous and unfortunately common place when playing with randoms. That said, it goes both ways. Killers DC all the damn time. Infuriating!
---
Also Hag and Kate's outfits are fucking amazing.
---
Lol isn‚Äôt it great?
---
Can sometimes be strategic. However it's more likely the survivors (probably SWF)  just wanna pop them at the same time to enrage the killer something.

People are going to call me crazy but I actually feel like open chat actually decreases toxicity. You are less likely to rage on someone when you can hear their voice, recognize there‚Äôs an actual feeling person on the other side. Not just some emotionless wall of text. I think part of the problem with this game‚Äôs community is that it forces people into party chat. Now that does encourage toxicity: everyone who isn‚Äôt in your party is a slathering idiot and every mistake they make is a hostile action.

We have a doctor. We have a plague. Do we really need a crossover of the two? :P
---
No, the Addiction Demon doesn‚Äôt. Sally summoned it after she threaded herself together with her junkie friends.
---
Swiping in mid air? How and why would that be bannable?
---
I have no idea and it didn't give me any real advantage except a tiny speed boost but all 4 survivors in the match were telling me it was bannable and they reported me.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it, you can‚Äôt get banned for it
---
i didnt think so but dude i was so worried. dont trust survivors i guess lol.

I think an issue *that* big (sounds being quieter ain‚Äôt too big a fix, I reckon) would take them a while to fix, and would be dropped in a big bundle o‚Äô patches. Then again, it‚Äôs been a problem for *forever* so, haha yeah I have no fuckin idea mate

The Rubber Man bangs people in both Murder House and in Apocalypse

---
I want killer to be 3rd person all the time.
---
Well Tapps job is being a narc sooooo
---
Agreed
---
If all survivor reports were viable, all killers would‚Äôve got banned.
---
Controversial opinion: devs nerf killers so much to make 4 out of 5 people playing survivor so that matchmaking balances itself.
---
You moms asshole is bait
---
Thanks.
---
Those things have nothing to do with voice-chatting with someone, which is why people are up in arms over SWF.
---
It might be implemented with the addition of dedicated servers, the reason they can‚Äôt do a party system right now is because when they go into a game, the killer is the new host, so when the killer leaves the game, there‚Äôs no more host

I play on console so post game isn‚Äôt bad and end game(idk what‚Äôs it‚Äôs called) should fix the toxic but dancing at gates. But OH the messages i get when I run a *mori*.
---
I have 200 hours in and still dont know if I like it.
---
They made it more precise once (2.2.0 PTB?) and it was way worse. You were basically able to shoot through some wall holes, Killer Shack was nothing for Huntress.
---
How? I play survivor and killer. As killer I usually easily get a 4k,  if I struggle you can always use NOED or other perks to rely on. As survivor I usually have the most blood points on my team,  and still don't always survive. You have to hit skill checks for gens and healing,  when do killers have them? Lol. Not saying either does not require skill,  just do not think at all that survivor's take less skill.
---
Devs never said anything about luck to keep it mysterious. A lot of tests say that luck never affect chests.
---
&gt; (granted he doesn't have any cosmetics that are separate head/torso, but...)
---
And that's why it works for Ash. Because his head and torso are one piece. Feng has the issue of the head and torso being seperate with sepera√æe slots.
---
Yes it is. You're abusing an exploit. You know what you're doing
---
Marry me pls
---
20-13 is easier as killer. 12-1 is harder as killer. Thats facts forshure man.
---
&gt; **drop a giant plank.**

This level of new is adorable. üòÇü§£
---
Me: ‚ÄúFinally, I got him-‚Äú 
---
*Final three gens pop, adrenaline procs and guy‚Äôs gonna have MoM*
---
Bing bing guess I‚Äôll just die
---
Yeah I'm glad more people are checking out Killer more. Everytime somebody brings up an argument, especially one about Killerd it's always sort of "Oh survivor has been very nerfed recently" and yeah? If that's the case that doesn't mean Killers still don't suffer. We go through a lot of shit.
---
What's the exploit then? I genuinely don't know.
---
Why do I find this so funny 
---
"B y e"
---
God damn! Looking nice.
---
To be fair you either get memelord Quentins that always get out or die heroically, or it‚Äôs a toxic Quentin who doesn‚Äôt know how to use a flashlight except for spam clicking at you and t-bagging at pallets
---
You know who you are. I know who you are.
---
When is it not having audio issues honestly?
---
I don't think its bannable but is being nerfed in the update(rework)
---
Chases take quite a bit of skill on the survivors side when done right.  I would agree that playing killer requires more focus and obviously multitasking.  But playing survivor definitely requires skill to keep that chase going especially if you're doing it the right way which is using as few pallets as humanly possible.  Lots of mindgames too against the killer.
---
I know and i dont even play legion i just had a daily :(
---
Hag gonna be looking exquisite
---
This got a chuckle from me, imagine facing Devour Hope at full stacks but then hearing the terror radius outside your room...
---
How would you see through that thing lol
---
You could just use Tapp's rock throw at a survivor to get the killer's attention on them instead of yourself. Doesn't stun them, but still dirty as fuck haha
---
Really? Cause everytime I'm the last one left I'm hunted mercilessly for sacrifice and blood. They crave to see my eyes go dark. To see me die lol
---
There‚Äôs not really much you can do about the matchmaking right now, but I‚Äôd recommend looking up some tip videos, knowledge is power in video games, and you can get knowledge before skill due to it being really accessible, good luck :)
---
Same tbh, guess we'll have to see next year
---
And today I found out that Barbecue is buggeed and some killers can see you inside lockers as it was before the changes!!!!
---
Yes please! I want my FUCKING BUNNY OUTFIT!!! Sorry I can't wait any longer
---
Dude it‚Äôs a joke chill
---
Bro, it worked! I have it all sorted
---
Oh my gosh, this is great haha
---
That makes sense. It still annoys me. Lol
---
Yeah, it would be nice to chat with others while soloing
---
Did you use the ini edits?
---
Have to be in those events when double blood points are active. I managed to get 3-4 killers P3 during those times it was crazy.. But yea I agree with you that the amount of Bloodpoint gains is kinda small sometimes but that's why you have the doctor to farm with half the time lol.
---
Congratulations, thats brag worthy.
---
My first weekend with the game I only had fun every 1 in 5 rounds. It can be very frustrating as a newcomer but as you learn the nuances of the game it'll suck you in.  Considering the ranks, I'm honestly impressed you managed that one kill and racked up as many points as you did on your first day.  Tells me you're on the right track. Sometimes this game will stack the odds against you and you just have try to take every loss as a learning experience.
---
Where is their company building or like servers for updates located?
---
Fuck yeah?!
---
Survive with friends, essentially people playing together.  
---
It's probably why you went up against such high ranks, as people really high in the ranks were queuing with lower people.  
---
Although Killer is fun and even my preferred role, it has a bit higher of a difficulty curve in the beginning as compared to survivor. I'd recommend trying that out first quite a bit.  
---
If you ever want someone to play with: [https://steamcommunity.com/id/mistresschara/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mistresschara/)
---
This game is absolute trash to begginers. The devs don't have a clue what they are doing and when you start you get to see why the community is so toxic.
---
It could‚Äôve also been a guy who has a friend who just bought the game, and wanted to play with him, like right now I think I‚Äôm around purple-ish rank and my friends aren‚Äôt as experienced as me, when I play with them I‚Äôm not trying to bully killers, I‚Äôm trying to have a good time with my friends, but, there is the off chance that it was some guys out to bully killers too
---
A o
---
here is a common situation: 4 randoms and two gens left two fix.
---
3 of the 4 gens are real tight close to each other and killer is in this area patrolling them to get a lockdown.
---
i see 3 people fucking around there, wasting time cause they can't split into two teams and work on different gens in the area for some reason. i honestly can't be arsed to join their party like that so i peacefully work on that distant gen cause momma needs them bloodpoints. i 99 that bad boy, sigh and go sacrifice my Asian body in order to take the killer out of the area since people are idiots and don't understand that 3 gen just like tunneling and camping 90% of time can be prevented or resolved if one of survivors sacrifices themselves to become easy prey for the killer. 
---
and if unfortunately i wasn't the one on the distant gen, 9/10 times some Claudette will pop it and there is no chance to deal with lockdown properly anymore, we will have to do the long ass 3 gen shit.
---
another situation: two gens left, you're on a distant gen and see that the guy is not being saved or you two are only ones left. you specifically 99 the gen to not draw attention, save, if possible hop on other gen or distract killer and pray to Entity your teammate is not an idiot and won't pop your gen. 
---
and one more: one or two gens left. i 99 one of them to check totems cause feel like killer might have noed. and pray to the Entity someone won't pop my damn gen.
---
the moral overall is - for killers 1 last gen in most cases means failure. so they start playing dirty which is understandable. to prevent unpleasant situations it's better to deceive the killer in having more time. i hate when survivors specifically rush last gen when someone is in chase or hooked and then can't save cause noed triggers so 7/10 cases the rushers also go down and everyone dies. if only they'd 99 that gen, saved, checked on totems... but that's the common problem with most survivors. they prefer to hold m1 or be in chase instead of actually thinking of strategies, have situational awareness and actual motherfucking fun, man. few times i had amazing teams of randoms, pure pleasure. they'd 99 gens if someone is caught in RBT, bodyblock and take aggro, actually cleanse when they see totems to not get hit by noed. oh, boy, these games worth all the trash dbd moments. wish more survivors had brains.
---
Dumb, but beautiful
---
You‚Äôll learn that giant planks are in fact your friend. The sound u make is the sound of pleasure
---
Yes :) 
---
https://youtu.be/RoPOiaSLXms
---
I followed this video and it worked 100%
---
Orrrrrr. U want to get someone of the hook as a distraction Then adrenaline. Or some one is hidden in recovery.. recovers. Then adrenaline. Or dont want the trap on someone's head to start countdown
---
Finaly, the *BEE* as Killer!
---
I dont understand. I learned about that my first two weeks of playing. And years later I see it happen all the time still
---
=,(
---
Can I have a veggie disk instead?
---
What killer u use?
---
Spirit with surveillance and discordance is decent.
---
U wot m8
---
The passion is definitely misdirected. I love the passion but I think it needs to be turned into something more positive and encouraging to devs and other players than a toxic cess pool
---
Lmfao you'll leave the match? So sensitive just tunnel them if it hurts you that much
---
My name Jeff...
---
Christ that was annoying.
---
The objective is to kill, I don‚Äôt care how many gens get done as long as they all die
---
My point was that I had 30 ping 
---
And this was happening.
---
That looks like a fuckin good game though, average of 25k across the board, well done.
---
and i mowi spamz dem heehee ü•¥üòçüòò
---
Going by what we‚Äôve been told by OP, this isn‚Äôt the case. You‚Äôre wrong.
---
I dont condone tbagging but if you camp/tunnel or run Devour Hope/Dying light you totally deserve it
---
Besides that dont be an ass were all here for fun
---
If you wanna use a shitty crutch, go ahead. But that won‚Äôt change that it‚Äôs a crutch and you are using it on an insta down killer.
---
Not true imo, in a game based on momentum anything that breaks that for free and gives a survivor a fresh start at a new chase is ok. I feel the same way about Insta heals
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
tunneling: specifically going after one survivor to secure a kill
---
noed: short for the perk ‚ÄúHex: No One Escapes Death‚Äù, which once the exit gates are powered instantly puts survivors into the dying state upon a successful attack
---
NOED: No One Escapes Death.  A hex often used by killers that lets them down survivors in one hit after all the generators are powered.
---
Stopping gens is 100% a killer objective and for you to pretend otherwise is nothing more than killing. By all accounts, go ahead and camp. Since killing is soooo much more important than stopling gens. 
---
Mhm, sure.
---
Tunneling is focusing on one specific survivor and going to down and kill them every chance you get. You don't leave them to chase other survivors right in front of you and you go after them right after an unhook. It ruins the survivors experience and sometimes can keep the killer from learning other skills and methods of play that's more productive point and rank wise. 
---
Noed is the hex perk "no one escapes death" which allows killers to instantly down who ever they hit on the first hit once all gens are done.
---
Yeah I definitely needed to lay down and give my brain a rest after struggling through that
---
uwu jeff here i come
---
Camping- When the killer stands right next to it stays near someone while they‚Äôre on the hook
---
Tunneling-When the killer only goes after 1 person, kills them, and then chooses someone else to go after for the game. 
---
NOED- No one escapes death. A perk that lets the killer one hit down survivors when exit gates are powered
---
Love ace
---
Perhaps, from this clip its just hitting a wounded survivor right in front of you. But could have been tunneling.
---
Face camping: The Killer standing right next to the hook preventing survivors from rescuing the hooked survivor.
---
Tunneling: Going after one Survivor at the expense of others. Not to be confused with just going after the first survivor you see or the  weaker survivor between the two in front of you, a Killer tunneling will go after one survivor for 3+ minutes without a hook or will actively stop chasing one survivor to go after another survivor that just got unhooked.
---
NOED: Hex: No One Escapes Death. It's a Killer perk that activates when all generators are powered that gives them a 5% speed boost and causes M1 attacks to down survivors instantly.
---
MoM: Mettle of Man, a Survivor Perk that after three hits, causes them to ignore the fourth hit if they were already injured.
---
DS: Decisive Strike, a Survivor perk that gives the Survivor a chance to immediately jump off of the Killer's shoulder if they were unhooked sixty seconds ago.
---
Any others you need?
---
Hes a big boy right? Scary dude.
---
At one point I seriously questioned if trying to finish this match was worth the health risk lol
---
The RZA, The GZA, Ol Dirty Bastard, Inspecta Deck, Raekwon the Chef, U-God, Ghostface Killa, Method Man
---
Huntress was the oldest, now the Plague is
---
This was happening to me the other day, its strange man, give them an explanation and let them take it or leave it.
---
why is this so funny it‚Äôs the simplicity of it I‚Äôm dying lmfao üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It‚Äôs not an exploit
---
Ace visCONTINUE
---
Nothing wrong with using it. It got two teabagging crazy survivors so I approve of this.
---
Third seal does not prevent survivors from seeing boxes.
---
Unnerving Presence does not affect Jihsaw skillchecks.
---
When it comes to perk/add on synergy Oi have 1 option.
---
Amanda‚Äôs Letter, Lery‚Äôs/Game offering, and play it like a budget scratched mirror Myers.
---
Sweets sounds a little overpowered. R&amp;W sounds a little underpowered. But Become Legend sounds interesting, I like it. The power seems cool. Overall I like it. Nice work!
---
This is true, you can't play survivor competitively. The problem I run into a lot is I can do 3 gens, I can loop the killer, and I can save, but I cant do them at the same time
---
M-E-T-H-O-D MAN!
---
EHM-EE-TEE-AYCH-OH-DEE MAN!
---
That makes way more sense. My only other competitive game has been overwatch and people get super hung up over rank, I presumed it was the same ^^;;; fr though, I‚Äôd love a quick play mode. I hate comp modes, people become animals.
---
They also haven't had an event in forever. We can have more than one nice thing at a time, and asking isn't going to make them take away BBQ. Also, as others said, survivor BP gain is pretty shitty. While BBQ basically secures 30-45k for killer WGLF isn't able to do that.
---
Dio is the next killer confirmed.
---
*Adam
---
‚ÄúNoed rewards killer who have a bad match‚Äù it shouldn‚Äôt. A killer should not be rewarded for failing. And the chainsaw is piss easy to hit.
---
Ve got 3 of those on my Myers
---
It doesn't work for chests right now they said in a dev stream a while back that they want it to, so maybe in the future.
---
Even Dwight is afraid!
---
You were against people well outside of your rank! I wish they would fix this so swf groups couldn't play with anyone lower than the lowest rank survivor. I'm sorry that happened, but don't get discouraged. You'll find other lobbies that fit your skill range and you'll grow naturally like the rest of us have. We all face these games from time to time, just push through and move on to the next match! If you get out played by people in a higher rank don't beat yourself up over it because you aren't on their level yet. So don't feel bad!
---
Those are cool changes
---
I live for the purgatory theory reference, kudos
---
I wasn't really giving an opinion. I'm just stating facts here about NOED. People ignore the side of NOED that makes it stupidly powerful to begin with. The 1 hit downs won't matter without the haste status effect being given to the killer if the survivor knows how to run the killer. You can juke 1 hit killers all day until they get that haste status effect then you're screwed because you can't outrun them. It's not really an opinion here.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't like NOED or people that use it but it doesn't change the fact that's what makes it strong.
---
Bullshit. I have played for like 2 hundred hours and can dodge saws easily.  On top of that with the way match making works a good killer for his rank gets pitted up against some high ranked survivors is more bs. It's perfectly fair to bring noed for some kind of sacrifice in those situations regardless of which killer you use. I assure you if someone is good enough you wont touch them with a saw.
---
There‚Äôs these things called survivor mains bud
---
They do this and you can say goodbye to a large portion of the player base. You can accept that and play around it, or keep crying in the subreddit.  Only 1 option will help you move forward.
---
Don‚Äôt want to be toxic here but being t-bagged by survivor is the last thing a killer would like to see
---
Meg escaped, she kobed and disappeared, they all played well and we all laughed about finding lockerboi in post game chat.
---
How's it taste Muthaphucka?
---
Well everything you just described leads me to believe spirit is easily the best choice
---
Claudette wouldn't smoke weed she's a preppy ass nerd
---
I never once said I was perfect and that I don't make mistakes. I'm just saying clicking a button isn't hard to do and is not skillful in any way, shape or form. I also never said one side is easier than the other. Things are only as hard as you make them or as long as it takes you to learn them. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Clown best killer
---
Toxic? It was a tactical play that in certain situations was smarter to do.
---
That's like saying killers slugging is toxic. It's a tactic.
---
Looks like they were going for their achievements
---
Hm, could be just a bad lag spike on the killer's end that affected you
---
So what? Is it bothering you that much?
---
Just no.
---
Could've been a lag spike on the killer's end that affected you
---
The word has quickly spread around that there is no penalty at all for DCing so survivors just love to abuse the heck out of it. Pretty sad.
---
Devour hope seriously of all the perks you choose devour hope. 
---
Are you serious. 
---
I cannot comprehend why you choose devour hope .
---
I don't understand.
---
What do you mean?
---
i don't mean to stereotype but she's a botanist from Canada
---
Imagine a realistic looking candyman chasing you in this game
---
Where did anybody mention camping? If I kill them the gens will stop themselves.
---
Except for Ace  whos of course ace.
---
Lol awesome man
---
Sound is borked since 2.6.0.
---
Chase music is too loud, making it impossible to hear breathing/pained grunts (as Killer) and footsteps (both sides) in a chase.
---
If the mid-chapter patch doesn't fix this, I ain't coming back to DBD.
---
Requires less attention/effort*  Playing killer requires focus the whole game while survivor requires total focus for only a quarter of that time
---
What the fuck am I looking at, looks like the legion is having a seizure.
---
This is art
---
No, matchmaking is fucked. Players your rank should not be seeing players that high up.
---
Otherwise, those are your average toxic survivor playing with their friend in voice chat.
---
They were tbagging after throwing a pallet (I learned it‚Äôs not called a plank) and insta destroying hooks but the best part was after I killed the rank 8 he called me trash for using a crutch killer.  Is wraith good?
---
I appreciate the attention with the survivors.
---
Nah, a decent Survivor can loop a Killer there for MINUTES.
---
Say it louder for the people in the back
---
Perhaps a family member got on an account? Makes sense if they weren‚Äôt able to catch two people for five gens.
---
I mainly player killer and dabble in SWF every now and then. 
---
I love playing killer but man the survivors are brutal. I avoid camping and tunneling to keep it fair and interesting but some players just frustrate the hell out of me and all I want to do is hook them and stare lol. 
---
The constant flashlight over any interaction, the teabagging, crouch blocks, etc. make it hard to even be remotely intimidating. I feel like I'm the survivor against 4 killers lmao.
---
It would just make the game more memey
---
Me a Killer Main reading this: ‚ÄúWait! This is a Survivor Main?‚Äù Meanwhile in my head an alarm is going off ‚ÄúTroll Alert! TROLL ALERT!!
---
To clarify: The person with the urban evasions and flashlight disconnected on deadhook.
---
but DC too much times will be banned that's for sure so minimizing DBD program and ignoring until end should be best solution
---
But in the movies she smoked lol
---
Adam with a cape
---
slugging is a very good play especially before endgame, It's pretty much free map pressure that pulls survivors off gens ( no ruin required ) seems like you need the other perspective you should look at is as a challenge or means to improve man. Don't be so willing to give up so easy because you swf (fun fact most people hate swfs) buuut i digress it was 1 gen and they needed to apply pressure and they did that. killers gotta kill and survivors gotta survive, You learned that persons mentality and if your really that dependent on blocking a challenge MLGA exists
---
She blazed it every day haha
---
Fake BS.
---
First time playing this i just want to give up because survivors always loop me and give me bad words at the end. But then i learned more things and now i see this game is actually fun sometimes
---
Turns out you're not a ninja the killer has eagle-eyes.

---
The adept achievements. Survive with x survivor using only their three perks. Three of them are doing that.
---
I'm a rather good survivor,  I've had messages from killers and other survivors asking me to be friends,  play with them and whatever else. But, I still sometimes miss skill checks,  run the wrong way and get caught,  slow vault,  or whatever else because I'm not perfect at the game and don't claim to be. Do I think skill checks are "hard" no not all,  but to some people who are newer or just struggle with checks it can be hard. You never know how long it takes another person to learn,  as I've said I think both sides come with issues and take skill.
---
C tier IMO
---
Nothing screams troll like survivor main that‚Äôs for sure.
---
I kinda want to agree with this, but maybe like if survivors can hear eachother within a range of like 16 meters or so. 
---
It would give reason for survivors to group up because it's currently much more efficient to be separated from your team. Giving more incentive for survivors to group up gives killers opportunity to create more pressure.
---
To be fair when I t-bag at the gates I like to think I'm just waving goodbye with my butt.
---
Good idea but I‚Äôm scared that the killer might shout at me
---
An*
---
In conclusion, I want a refund.
---
It's solo queue not swf. About rescuing my teammate that's because trying to do Nea's daily mission (rescue three teammate from hook). The first DBD game today and BM by Nurse (1/1)

I'm not lying and I'm not dumb. I'm very aware of this fact, no need to mudsling for no reason.

I was camped when BPS were brought into the trial and I did nothing to deserve the camping.
---
They aren't truly toxic. True toxicity is doing it all and not complaining whatsoever, and if provoked by the killer, give em an uninterested k.
---
So is the power just Bubba's chainsaw minus Tantrum, pallet breaking, and multihit?

Ohhh yeah that would be a good combo. Thanks for the info!
---
A work of art.

I hope you reported that piece of shit.

4 UE HOW WHAT IN THE DAMN

Way to be a douche bag over it man. Did you even read the method of looping I said? Lol. You are something else but enjoy that statement. Have a good one.

---
I hate that. You‚Äôre tbagging at the exits and I just think ‚ÄúI LET YOU LIVE‚Äù
---
The 3rd perk is actually a good idea
---
That‚Äôs true as well
---
With full BBQ and a green BP offering at minimum Im hitting ~65k a match on average.
---
If I throw on pudding or BPS that goes up to around 80k.
---
I can usually fill out a bloodweb every two matches. Its not really unreasonable from my experience.
---
I wish you could at least play multiple killers on Kill Your Friends, could make for some real goofy fun
---
matchmaking is a mess right now, but they are working on it! don‚Äôt give up on the game just yet

Thumb long asf. Type of thumb that non verbally says great job rather than good job. You have a 100% chance of getting picked up as a hitch hiker because your thumb can be seen from both sides of the road. Type to be able to control both controller joysticks with one thumb
---
This entire "series" is a joke thing anyway- I *want* Tony Todd as the character. It's why every week I try to alternate between a serious idea, and something funny. That's why last week was Winnie the Pooh. But even this suggestion *is* a joke. No way Tony Todd's Candyman is ever ending up in DbD.
---
I am just hoping that the change doesn't make it so killers can run out the clock to get kills that in the current patch they wouldn't have earned. It also makes NOED seem even more absurd as a perk, so I really hope it gets changed. It should work more like devour hope or huntress lullaby, because in its' current state it rewards killers for doing nothing. You can get shit on the whole game and get an easy 2k with NOED. At least Adrenaline is balanced around the fact that it is a waste of a perk slot at least 50% of the time for an average survivor.

Pharmacy gives you an Emergency Med Kit every time which is a pretty good med kit already but what you are really taking that perk for is the increased search speed and reduced noise when searching

I think Kate's arms alone in that pic could rip the Doctor in half.
---
I only just barely understand the loss meme but I still find it hilarious
---
Yea that will happen rarely when picking up survivors. Usually only happens when picking up someone in the process of disconnecting but ive had it happen to me randomly regardless.
---
Party chat really shouldn't be a thing, theres a reason they didn't include a voice channel for the survivors. It takes half the challenge out of it since you can know where each other and the killer is almost all the time.
---
your 1st item will always be a green medkit. if you're going for a plunderer build I'd recommend plunderers and ace in the hole.

Seriously, if you've never heard of It's Always sunny, watch it NOW.
---
Nea is easily in the top 10 hottest killers.
---
This game is just one giant self devouring meta meme isn't it?
---
Simple? Look at how simple it is for them to buff/rework Freddy.
---
Was billy
---
If tea-bagging gets under your skin, just remember that your mom didn't raise no pussy.
---
It also makes you miss a lot
---
MM is best scaredaddy, prove me wrong.
---
True that is often a thing.  I'd you ever try to farm though just add everyone to a group and hope they're a swf.  If one of them gets the message you're golden.  A lot of people are wary of fake farmers in game if there was no communication  beforehand.
---
PC - Game audio is popping and cutting in and out. 
---
Pull out my usb headphones to re-plug them to see if it helps.
---
Game gives me a warning " game security violation detected " and crashes.
---
Honestly when I play killer and see bps unless it's a red mori and I need a trophy or something, I just let them farm as long as they're willing to let me hook them twice
---
Yeah just like how the video works. You guys meet up say hey I saw the killer over there or be aware its Meyers.
---
The game is barely functional right now, the only content update I give a damn about is a fix to all this horrid bugs. They can machine gun cosmetics till the chamber is empty but they can't make a stable release, it's really gotten out of hand.
---
That's nothing, you depip if the killer dc's. I've dropped an entire rank before from back to back killer dc's the second the game starts.
---
I made something better when i took a massive shit this morning
---
Have him WRYYYYYY when he gets stunned by a pallet
---
But then you have clipping issues with any head that has hair. Even her default head would clip like mad and look horrible.
---
The best way is to not do a hoody. But make it a bunny eared skullcap. I can't remember the girl's name but think Bob's Burgers.
---
If you expect survivors to have fully functioning brains then you‚Äôre terribly mistaken...
---
Yeah, but you have to take the game head on sometimes
---
Do people actually think t-bagging is toxic, it‚Äôs just stupid to do it at pallets and I do it at the door cause I‚Äôve already won. I laugh at survivors who t-bag me at pallets as killer and I just go looking for survivors who aren‚Äôt at the door rather than foam at the mouth cause someone pressed a button multiple times.
---
That's nice. When are you going to fix the infinite loading screen bug?
---
Slit your wrists. Your entire family will be better off without you. You're nothing but a disappointment to them. The world will be a better place, and don't worry, no one will miss or remember you.
---
Hangman‚Äôs trick OP please nerf
---
Is that an ammo box add-on?
---
...I like this new direction survivors are going.
---
I like to run plunders, ace in the hole, pharmacist, and botany (for the green medkit). I then search for all the chest, usually I get something good out of the other two.
---
I think the Endgame Collapse is gonna shake things up. Pig will get ridiculous power during the actual collapse unless she's getting reworked - possibly Billy or Spirit tier. Keys are getting an indirect buff because, as far as I can tell, the killer can close the hatch (which spawns when 1 survivor is left regardless of generators) and if you don't have a key, you are instantly dead because you can't work on generators. Nurse and Billy might also struggle to get 4Ks now because of the hatch changes.
---
In all, I think survivor meta is leaning a little 9 stealth, and killer meta is strongly pointing to gameslow and map pressure as the dominant statistics. The meta for the rest of the game is likely gonna stay the same for a couple chapters.
---
Tl;DR - The meta is gonna change a little in a few days, but looping and Nurse will remain for a couple chapters at least.
---
Don‚Äôt generally draw too often but I was satisfied enough with this one that I thought I‚Äôd display it to this sub, enjoy
---
C&amp;C appreciated
---
So you're lying. Gotcha.
---
GIVE BUNNY FENG REEEEEE
---
I've had the same issues ever since the plague patch. However, I recently upgraded my internet speed and was given a newer modem and router. For whatever reason the game is now back to running like it did before the plague patch without endless DCs every game. So yeah, it's BHVRs fault, but it doesn't affect everyone's internet, so you could try asking your ISP for a more up to date modem and router and hope for the best.
---
I think she's both a liar and dumber than a brick.
---
I think we ALL know what quentin REALLY smoked.
---
That's so awesome
---
Plot twist: Mark is the killer. Slugs Coyote and facecamps him "you okay?"
---
as long as we all know that we're gonna live forever, whats the point?
---
Fancy hag!
---
Ever heard of space Billy? If you get a lucky hill you can bounce across the whole map like that. It's especially funny to do it and completely eliminate a loop that a survivor is trying by landing on them with the chainsaw
---
So NOED?
---
It's not true auto aim tho
---
What's even more awesome is they gave me a discount on the pizza because they bullied my T1 Myers with an infinite.
---
*Sips supreme*
---
I mean what is it then? On occasion I run into survivors who seem to know how to really take advantage of a killer who lungs a lot (me). My hit will trace after until it stops with them unharmed.
---
I love the post chat salt tbh, esp against SWF.
---
it's not, that's a troll account. He's got another one on this subreddit, he always puts "Bih" in his name. Complete tool
---
Aww :')
---
It's a reference to a comic called Loss. https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/loss
---
Make sure you face away from it too, been screwed out of a 4k by a feng with spine chill a few times
---
You say that which I haven't thought of. I wanted cosmetics for my killers hooks.
---
You clearly either play p3 claudette with an instabind or you're a p3 nurse
---
Besides the dank Blood Warden plays it might be really strong on Pig if you save your traps until the end and then just guard the jigsaw boxes.  Seems like a strong way to confirm an extra kill or two
---
Only thing you can do is record it and submit to the devs. I dont know what to tell you because I can get 40k+ on a bad game.
---
Nice one! Fourth perk is tricky, but if you‚Äôre a late game player, Left Behind would be nice with your build, except the endgame collapse will probably make Left Behind useless as flip.
---
This same glitch happens to Jason on friday the 13th. That's weird.
---
Fast vaults will notify. I've also had it glitch before and show me auras of locker survivors.
---
Good read
---
downvoted for sarcasm, that's painful
---
Hes op for the fact it's hard to run away. Good survivors will still RIP him a new one though.
---
Damn now I want a pepperoni pizza.
---
what a dumbass, couldn't even wait for the fatigue
---
I'm going to buy that doc skin so fast
---
So just a guy without a head then?
---
I'll love to be a passenger to that train
---
I'm new and I know to just power through ruin. What even.
---
I‚Äôd so love to make deals as the killer! Like if there‚Äôs only one guy left but I‚Äôm merciful, I might tell them to give me their item for their life.
---
When they hatch camp instead of doing gens so you don‚Äôt kill your self, and let the Leatherface get them because of barbeque
---
Masterfully done. Makes me consider possibly using Iron Will again. It's hard to tell when the perk actually DOES anything, but instances like this it's clear to see how clearly survivors without it telegraph themselves.
---
I don't think he knows there's no level cap and it's endless after 50.
---
So true I auto aimed and missed probably wouldve hit them if it didnt auto aim
---
Yeah that would be nice. Then when I'm running Resilience, Iron Will, Dead Hard and This Is Not Happening, people will stop standing there for 10 seconds trying to get me to let them heal me when I'm clearly focusing down a generator when the killer has gotten 4 hooks and no one but me has finished a gen. Also I can see when a TTV player has an extremely meta build and can know when to not check out their stream
---
KOBE!
---
You are welcome.
---
&gt;They tend to do things in increments... 
---
stares at legions corpse
---
That's only if the player is only using m2 to down. If he's using m1 and m2 or only m1  he's easy to escape against
---
I assume u/WinterFFBE thought you were trying to pass the video you captured as live footage, and felt so smart that he caught you, that he tried to call you out on it.
---
Don't worry OP, the rest of us do get that you were just making a meme with a funny situation.
---
Tend being the keyword...  :c
---
I have 7.1 too but to be really effective I kinda need to increase the game's volume, but some sounds are a lot louder than others. Beaking a pallet or a generator gives me ear damage every time.
---
If you could get all your perks in no time, then what do you have left to play for ? Your reason to grind is gone and so only reason to play is for fun, but for 90% it wouldn't be fun with a goal to grind
---
Not even a perk. Just let us vault over pallets. M1hold to break them, space and the taller killers steps up on it and hops down the other side, and the smaller killers vault over like survivors. 
---
Same or slightly faster speed as a window.
---
Everytime a survivor main plays killer 1 of 2 things happen. They get fucking rolled by 4 man swf with sb looping them, they t bag get 3 gens by the time you've downed one person but it doesn't matter because they all body block the hook then they all escape and t bag at the gate. Then they realise how shit it feels being a killer who just got fucked by some toxic survivors with flashlights.
---
 Or they get lucky and find 4 random rank 20s who have just bought the game, they kill them all and say "lmao I should just be a killer main it's so ez" then go back to survivor.
---
Flashlight clicking and tea-bagging are bad manners. Staying in the exit gate until forced out and body-blocking are just examples of good play, but dragging the game on once you know you've already won is not okay. Unnecessary action taken for the purpose of aggravating the killer are toxic.
---
Only thing I will ask the killer is why the mori but only when and if they have party  streamers other then that I say gg and gl unless their account is private since I'm on console
---
Killers are way too imbalanced/powerful than survivors, with equal skillet among players a killer has better odds of winning a game.
---
Oh but I can already see why its so toxic
---
I don't remember if I played early access or shortly after release but I recall trapper and wraith existing when I started and Billy being released shortly after I started.  I remember watching the spotlight video of the charging billy and thinking it was absurd.  Unless I'm remembering incorrectly Billy released after Wraith.
---
You know he‚Äôs not originally from DbD right? It‚Äôs cool he happens to be in DbD and also this ERB though!
---
I know, I might have used the wrong choise of words. I meant he is the first to be in DBD and an ERB
---
ah yes the good ole days when u could stack them and no one could see shit
---
cause maybe the survivor doesn't want to die? especially when it's their first hook
---
Because I don‚Äôt get salty that I get t-bagged and I do some mild t-bagging myself? Lmao ok I‚Äôll gladly be part of the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù.
---
Ps4 or pc? I had this issue for a while but changed a Wi-Fi setting and I haven't had this issue since, it could be worth a try. I only know for sure it works with ps4 though
---
There's an easy explanation for this. Farming is incredibly boring and waste of time from a survivor perspective, unless you want a specific achievement easily. If I want to farm I hop onto my Killer with BBQ and BP offerings and get hunder thousands of BP in half a day while playing the game as intended. Getting BP as a survivor even with WGLF is no match compared to farming BP as a Killer. They know you wan't to farm but they **refuse to acknowledge it** because as I mentioned it sucks out all the fun from the game. If I matchmake as a survivor I want to actually test my skills not get into a boring 10-15 minute farming session, you approxmiately get the same amount of BP by playing the Killer normally anways, so what's the point. **You think you are helping us by initiating a farm but you are doing the exact opposite**. If you want to be a Good Guy Killer then play as intended without tunneling and camping and maybe try to put everybody on the hook 2 times and at the end you can still let everybody go without making it boring as hell.
---
&gt; How the hell are survivors so dumb? 
---
TL;DR: We are not dumb, we just want you play as intented, or at least act like it.
---
I understand why people would do it. The only thing a killer has to worry about at this point is maaaaybe finding the hatch but if you do rescue them one of you WILL go down again if not both
---
This happens to me too
---
It's hitbox things. When your hit connects with the survivor's hitbox, it'll try to make it look as if it hits the player.
---
I main survivor, if I want to farm I hop onto my Killer with BBQ. I don't play survivor to farm, I want to enjoy the thrill of surviving. You don't get much less BP if you play the Killer as intented but if you initiate a farm you take away the main reason survivors queue up. It's not that they don't catch on, they just don't want to... big difference.
---
Didn't we already know this?
---
Hey, would you happen to know where I can watch it?
---
I would say,
---
1. don't damage your ears over a video game what the hell is wrong with you
---
2. Audio occlusion is bugged right now, sounds do not work as they should. [You can notice this most obviously by line of sighting a generator.](https://www.twitch.tv/scottjund/clip/OptimisticHeadstrongClipzPJSalt) So I wouldn't even try to handle it right now.
---
I'd dodge every lobby where there are more than 1 UE + SC gamers lmao
---
Fast as fuccboi
---
I play killer more than survivor, but when I play survivor I will sometimes teabag a lit-lot....i teabag a lot when I'm survivor.......am I a jerk?
---
No you didn't. You didn't read. Hatch is available no matter how many gens get done. If you close the hatch now the gates are available. And unless the gates are very close to each other or you know where the last survivor is -provided that they didn't just camp the hatch-  then you're screwed... Not unless you use a killer with map control. 
---
And killers already slug to get 4K. It's not fun for either side. It's not fun for the guy who got slugged. It's not fun for the killer to slug a guy and look for the 4th who could be hiding god knows where. It's not fun when the 4th guy runs up and revives the 3rd guy; all because of the bullshit where the longer a guy is downed the quicker they can be picked up, it's so much fun to chase the last guy and he takes a fraction to pick the other guy up and still keep a distance away from the killer. Not to mention, your autistic ass should know this, that the 3rd guy can just DC to guarantee that the 4th guy get Hatch. It's a very blatantly biased design choice to fuck over killers.
---
I thought you were going to play piano üë® man
---
Nothing better then having killer‚Äôs D/C after 1 minute because a gen finishes
---
Cool story comrade
---
I don't know if it was super unfair but it was kind of poorly designed at the time and so nobody could decide wether it was a good change or not so they didn't implement it.  
---
It's now a feature in the end game collapse and seems to have been reworked a bit to be a much better mechanic.  
---
Also, you can win hatch standoffs as either side, I just really don't want to sit around and wait or be forced into that situation. It's really poorly designed because of that and I'm glad they're changing it.
---
No actually
---
Killers almost always get more xp. Usually either the doctor or legion are the best earners. Combine either of those two with BBQ &amp; Chili and you should be leaving each match with at least 30k
---
Your welcome man, one of my favorite thing is to give the last survivor the hatch when he‚Äôs the only one who wasn‚Äôt toxic.
---
Last two games I've played I've actually crashed where it looks like a rage quit. 
---
I crashed after being found and puked on by a Plag, then the very next game I crashed after being one shot by a Myers. 
---
Actually starting to think the people who DC in my games aren't actually quitting, just crashing for no reason.
---
Here's an updated one.
---
https://youtu.be/l6k--wlopiE
---
I know. I mentioned it multiple time that it doesn't matter how many gens get done, fucktards still get their hatch. Another guy mentioned that they're removing the ability to grab them when they use hatch which is extra wetarded. If they nerf the shit out of NOED, Rancor, Blood Warden and Remember Me because of this bullshit I think I might honestly be done with this.
---
I'm tired of this fucking wetarded company constantly rewarding the cocksuckers with endless second chance abilities, and all while never fucking punishing them for disconnecting. I don't buy that they punish people because ragequitting has exploded in the last few months, largely due to their matchmaking fuckups, and I still get the same people who routinely ragequit in my lobby.
---
Is it possible to toggle off crouching on L3 on ps4? It‚Äôs stressful to randomly teabag killer when running for your life.
---
I make adrenaline plays or to pop multiple gens in rapid succession.
---
Also a minor psa: don't fucking pop a gen if someone 99s it on purpose
---
The point is that slamming a palette on a cloaked wraith gets me dead hard and i wont till' I get that burst of Adrenaline
---
If the survivors take too long and don't exit in time while trying to save other survivors, they Insta die and it counts as a sacrifice for the killer. That can totally be abused and used to killer advantage, I'm all for that tbh. When I play killer and the update releases I'm gonna have a solid end game build to stall as long as possible. 
---
And sure, killer objective is to kill. But survivor objective is to SURVIVE. You WILL NOT 4K every game. Accept it. You aren't supposed to let the survivors bend you over and they aren't obligated to bend over for you. You win some, you lose some. People have different ways of defining wining and losing in this game as well. Some determine by pips, some by blood points  (me), some by objective completion, some by emblems, and some genuinely just play to have fun (also me). 
---
I know you hate this, but it is just a game. You don't get paid to play it. You don't benefit financially or really any way playing this game. If you're this bent out of shape over it, you don't have to play. Stop making yourself miserable over it, no one wants that for you. 
---
You are not entitled to 4k. At all. You try your best, get better, learn different strategies, and find what works best. This intense anger and hatred you have for this game, for survivors, is not healthy for you, people you play against, or the community. You will not be fully catered to. Believe it or not, survivors are not fully catered to either. It may seem that way because you play solely killer, but I can tell you no matter what, I always get the most points as killer in every match regardless of kill number. You really do need to realize it is JUST A GAME.  your life is not threatened if you play poorly. You will not be killed if you have a bad match. Please, for the love of god, set your pride and ego aside for a moment and listen to other people, other killer mains especially, telling you this isn't the end of the world.
---
You should have run to your piano while the game was still live.
---
Feel cute, might stab some neas later
---
Love the doctors wicked caduceus staff.
---
I like how he's shining the flashlight directly on her ass
---
That's bamboozle.
---
What a pointless, shitty, defensive, passive aggressive ass comment you just posted. Holy shit that was not worth reading, you have literally posted nothing but entitled killer bullshit that is not only not worth the read, but outright wrong. 
---
Survivors escape by completing gens, you fucking tard. Your goal is to stop them, so by comparison, the killers goals include stopping gens. It isn‚Äôt fucking rocket science yet you still can‚Äôt see that, that is sad.
---
But it‚Äôs cool, keep using your shitty crutch perk that makes you feel less shitty, survivors will still laugh their asses off every time you don‚Äôt use it because of how fucking shit you are at the game. 
---
I could write a fucking thesis on why over half the bullshit you said about NOED is completely irrelevant for solo play, but you‚Äôre completely idiotic brain probably didn‚Äôt even think about that while writing that wall of schlock.
---
Stay bad kid, your cheap NOED kills won‚Äôt make you good. And they never will.
---
A win for me is the feeling that even if you didn't kill anyone, you've just made 4 other people's days just that but happier because they escaped.
---
Toxic forum nibbas be like: you're next
---
Yeah I just realized that gives you a lot of xp
---
Winning for me is having the most score.
---
Having a higher score than 2 survivors is a good game. 
---
Having the lowest score is a loss.
---
I still want to last the game a good amount of time, getting a 4k in 3 mins is as much fun as hooking no one for me.
---
I agree with this but not the beartrap thing. Other than that great idea.
---
In Philadelphia obviously
---
I'm backing you bruh let's get him
---
I'd say do. If they can get a refund they can get their money back and avoid the suffering.
---
Same here. Play to play, enjoy it, move on. What do you think is the stem for this toxic mind set a lot of players (not just killers) seem to have?
---
Suuuuure bud, mhm. Totally.
---
Decisive Strike makes it so that the Killer becomes obsessed with one Survivor. That doesn't necessarily mean the Decisive Strike user. If a obsession perk increases your chances of become the obsession, than it will be added as a bullet point in the perk description.
---
Chill out fam, you sound very angry and salty
---
And they knew to DC?
---
Not ghost face hopefully.
---
Peperonni comes from another country, the ping's too high!
---
What is there not to believe? Freddy without NOED is fine
---
Facts when I play killer I always look for the person who unhooked the survivor but they always hide so I have no choice but to tunnel the guy off hook or just leave him and go patrol gens which I do most of the time fuck immersed pussies. solo queue survivor really sucks
---
I thought it was about Jesus
---
Depends what killer you playing
---
[It had been questioned](http://reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bflq3y/just_encountered_this_one_of_the_most_tilting/eler290)
---
No, its far far far beyond that. "Add an extra hit before injured" Implies its not LIMITED. AT ALL TIMES you can be at 3 hits to down. Mettle of man at least has to be hit three times. and has the downside.
---
bruh
---
^^^beep ^^^beep ^^^outta ^^^the ^^^way
---
Man i would love to see DIO's mori, either ZA WARUDO coming out and punching a hole in the survivor's body and sending them flying, or
---
RODA ROLLA DA. WRYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
Oh. I totally missed that when I was skimming through comments. Oops.
---
I'm the opposite. Survivor main. When I play killer and anywhere from 1-4 people I get hate. It's funny because the comments I get don't make me mad, it makes me laugh for some reason. When I play survivor, however.. Teammates pass killer to me, dc at the start, dc when downed, suicide on hook, immerse and ignore gen, and finally killers that tunnel me because why the hell not
---
That sounds like every character.
---
No matter who they pick.
---
Either it's a hero or a toxic piece of shit
---
That‚Äôs just the PS4 version for you, it struggles to run this game for some reason.
---
Meg Thomas has no end. 
---
We can do this all day.
---
For me i take my headphones off and step back 5 paces before i dig into the bloodweb.
---
The first one is on par with no mither, second is literally mettle of men and the last one is pretty good, but it would probably replace alert completely
---
Goddamit
---
Yeah thats what Im saying
---
Damn lol imagine having emotes like this in game üòÇ
---
I think the idea is to prevent that communication working against the killer. Though higher tiers of play just uae discord or something anyway.
---
It kind of takes away from what the game is, your not supposed to have communication with other survivors in game, there were talks of stopping discord users to but I don't think that happened, its been a while since I've played, they broke the game with the legion patch for me
---
I‚Äôve overlapped Freddy on level 50 soooooo many times the game just won‚Äôt give me Monitor and abuse.
---
For real? I thought it was Jane, never really noticed it on Kate,
---
Yeah, I mean I wanna get bloodppomts but I‚Äôm not gonna farm my teammates and ruin there experience. 
---
I‚Äôm just waiting on WGLF to come up in my damn bloodweb üòÇ
---
Thanks for responding man üôè
---
I'd like killers that couldn't crawl through the grass like a snake, and then stick a fucking trap on your head.
---
Legion's old playstyle died and I'm very happy. He was terrible to play against and nobody liked it. Now Legion is kinda like wraith where he gets the first hit for free and then has to work for the second one. New Legion may not be the greatest but he's definitely better for the game than old legion
---
oh for a second I thought I was the Kate and my buddywas Jake and we had a hanging loading screen. we had that multiple times last evening, but looking at the builds it wasn't us. still feel bad for the people we had to send in as 2 mans tho
---
so let me get this straight. If i dont get found while doing a gen because i know how to avoid the killer, its my fault everyone died. If i unhook people and slip away back to my gen and dont get chased and they get themselves downed again, its my fault everyone died.  So by being good at one of the aspects of the game, not getting caught, its my fault everyone died.  Okay so im supposed to just loop the killer five ever until some nerds eventually do gens and i finally get hooked as the exit gates open then i get tunneled so everyone escapes except me. Makes perfect sense.
---
The Shrine of Secrets in the store menu currently has one of the best perks for killer going on; BBQ &amp; Chili. Effective survivor tracking and most importantly, more Bloodpoints every game. It will reduce a newbies BP grind tremendously.
---
I'm not sure how fast you can gain 2000 shards or if you even can by Tuesday, but definitely make it a priority if it looks possible for you
---
[removed]
---
I keep saying it, DbD needs a TAB screen to show bloodpoints, emblems, offerings and teammate perks. Most action games do have one if them to quickly know what's going on. It would probably encourage better gameplay. "I'm lacking in altruistism, so I should save someone" "I have no gens done, I should work on one" etc.
---
But I don't see how this will "slow the game down" which is what they said they were trying to do a while back?
---
Protests aren't always convenient but they are a necessary evil to bring forth change, perhaps one day BHVR will realize that what's wrong with Legion is also wrong with Nurse and fix that  killer as well then this won't be required
---
Can anyone help me understand why DBD keeps disconnecting my games? I'll be killer and all survivors will suddenly quit. Or I'll be survivor and the killer will "quit" for no reason. It's beyond the point of being salt DC. The timing is random too, sometimes the beginning of match, other times in the middle. Rarely I can finish a game and I'm tired of it.
---
The worst part is it isn't the internet dying because everything else is still working including psn. Playing on PS4 with a wired connection if anyone can help I'd really appreciate it.
---
It's kind of a good thing to reduce toxicity. That affects players performance.
---
Well you're not
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Downvotes mean crap and are cyclical thing. People are just too stupid to think further than "Oh but deaf people could use it", make that same comment on other time of day and it could just go up as well.
---
Nice explanation. I found out they were bs by hearing "7.1" and hearing the same thing through stereo headphones. It's kinda funny now whenever someone says "7.1 is a must for me in headsets"
---
Cept its not, did you not read the definition provided above?
---
Very good
---
This is not effective around low ranks because they tend to be new and clueless players. Try around 10-15. Also don‚Äôt chase and shock. Stand by a gen you know has a survivor. Repeatedly hit the gen or the background till they come
---
Well here's the thing sunshine, people can play the game exactly how they want and what the game allows for. The game offers several different perks that allow for a variety of play styles with stealth being one of those focuses. This is a game of hide and seek so not hiding isn't very sound logic. Also, it sounds to me that if this stealth guy isn't getting caught, he's the only one doing something right! Everyone will play the game how they like and there's nothing you can do to stop that. However, you can change how you play instead of placing the blame on others.
---
ah yes thanks for the update.
---
I also wanted to put that little of "Death is not an Escape" on, but that was a nightmare to create so I just left it at this.
---
When a legit player beats a hacker. Nothing beats that confidence my man
---
WGLF, Prove Thyself, Botany Knowledge, Self Care and a medkit. WGLF for overall point bonus, PT for objective, Botany for faster healing in general in case you don't get the unhook, Self Care and Medkit because that gives you points in survival which is the hardest to max
---
The hitboxes are fine. It's literally a basketball sized hitzone around the hatchet. I don't know if that sounds large to you, but it's really not. It just perfectly nestles the size of the Hatchet within it with the exception being that it's ball shaped and not hatchet shaped.
---
Every time someone complains about Huntress Hatchet hitboxes, it is most definitely a ping issue. We see the same shit happen with other killers when they somehow get that "across the pallet" lunge that somehow connects despite already being on the other side of the pallet. 
---
The hitboxes are fine, but we will still have this problem consistently until dedicated servers drop because as of right now, hits go off of what the host's client says to the survivors clients. On the host's screen, the survivor is always a couple milliseconds behind, and to them it's a clean hit.
---
Pretty cool  (:
---
I mean it takes a while but wasn't the grind back with legacy worse? I don't know because I got the game a few months ago so I could be wrong.
---
This. I was about to make a post similar to this but you nailed it. It‚Äôs not difficulty as much as it is engagement.
---
Getting 4bbq stack that's the only way to win as a killer
---
Just gotta point out that your second sentence is a double negative. It pretty much says that the game is built around survivors being to communicate
---
A little too far but for real: how the fuck can one eat pineapple pizza and not see it as a disgrace to pizza. Like, mate, there exists all these pizzas that are absolutely heavenly and you chose the one that is completely evil.
---
I do this if they just downed a teammate so they don't camp when all gens are done, so I either wait for a teammate to kamikaze run for a save then pop or save them myself then run back and pop. The worst is when I leave a gen at 99, walk away, then some idiot pops it immediately.
---
Sounds pretty easy to me?...
---
Do you regularly miss attacks or something? It's not a hatchet or a blink legion does basic attacks so just follow their movements if they try to 360 or something.
---
Vote me down all you want, doesn't make what I said any less true!
---
why am I being downvoted for being gay?
---
Less characters, more bug fix
---
They fucked up the skulls for mori‚Äôs and sacrifices when clown came out and never bothered to fix it lol. I haven‚Äôt seen many people complain about it so the devs probably don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs a small detail but it‚Äôs annoyed me too haha
---
Devil's Advocate: we focus on toxicity because it's OUR fault and something we can at least call each other out on.  The Devs have proven time and again that they don't listen to us or when they do, it takes them FOREVER to do something about it.
---
Oh you are wellcome sweet boy &lt;3 nah when you become better with the killer and dont play a low tier one you become a big deal for this salty pieces of toxic shit so the bes they can do is end game chat flaming which I dont give a fuck tbh
---
I've always had the opinion of doing the opposite. The "rarity" of perks is so meaningless because the usefulness of the perk is completely unrelated to color and the occurrence on a blood web is also irrelevant because there is ALWAYS 2 on a level 50 bloodweb, for example (always 1 at level 10, etc.)
---
Please ban this guy. I‚Äôm mad now
---
Imo don't start as killer, it will be rough.
---
The game is good. The matchmaking is trash and the community is a mixed bag (ranging from friendly to toxic).
---
This game have a very specific set of patterns for each maps. No knowing which one is safe or unsafe for the survivors as a killer means you might loose big time chasing a "runner" (survivor specialized on this task).
---
This game is broken by design, but can be fun sometimes. If you still want to play killer, accept that you need to have 75% of knowledge of the game (maps, perks, killer's abilities) to go against average survivors. Once you have that you'll run through them like butter.
---
I only t-bag at the gates when I'm playing Jane, but that's just to give the killer a show for their hard work. /s
---
Seriously though, the toxic behavior needs to stop.
---
It'd be kinda neat if the killers screen looked like that with the people they killed running and the survivors just saw the escapees
---
Hmm are you saying you never miss?
---
That seems to be what you're implying..
---
What a pain in the ass, I'm sorry man
---
Who‚Äôs art is that? Ace looks so pretty... But doesn‚Äôt he always ‚ô†Ô∏è
---
I mean you can use all the weird logic you want, but most people would agree the word rescue is used to infer someone saving another person. You don't say you rescued yourself, that's just silly.
---
I‚Äôm so happy not only are we still talking about bunny Minnie but that we also don‚Äôt care that it doesn‚Äôt work. Make it work. Change it. Just please put bunny ears and candy coloured jumpers on our fav toxic pro gamer:(((
---
NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
---
I remember being the only one to load in a match and I got paired up with a nurse and they let me work on all the gens and I gave them my sacrifice. What a nice nurse they were.
---
Don't pretend like its hard to hold W and press M1.
---
Unless you're playing spirit you're awful if you're regularly missing a basic follow the survivor and press a button hit.
---
This is something everyone does why would i stream it? Do you see Tru3/Zubat/Scottjund out there missing M1 hits more than once in a blue moon?
---
Yeah, I think nowadays he‚Äôs kind of come to terms with it being a meme but yeah he was a dick
---
Isn't it a bit too dark for your eyes OP?open your shutters
---
Its a issue that often ends up with 4 v 1 games, you have mob mentality on the 4 side, and you have generalization on the other side. The issue was that DBD did not curb such behavior when it was new and the game itself often encouraged it ontop of naturally frustrating mechanics for both sides. For the longest time Survivors had the significant power role that let them get a ego boost, then SWF pushed that advantage further and let those people mob up while playing, because of that you ended up with a vocal group of arrogant survivors who relied heavily on their safety nets to taunt the killer and equally became angry when their own mistakes finally outweighed said blankets.
---
Equally so the game itself encourages toxic mechanics for killers, Mori, rare addons, tunneling, all practical gameplay elements that often time were even just required when the game was so brazenly in the survivor favor. Now though its a case of why risk it, you could be nice but after the 100th SWF alpha squad you start to become more proactive instead of reactionary, why risk having them be toxic when you yourself can just slap on your Mori Omega blink nurse and haul ass before it happens.
---
Call out dicks for being dicks but lets address the fact the game mechanics encourages or still does encourage toxic behavior on both fronts and that is why the community became so volcanic.

---
Trapper works amazingly well.
---
Epic Rap Battles of history
---
Stealth if done right (=not crouching around with Claudette) is useful and can waste the killer's time. And it doesn't waste all the pallets in the map.
---
Stop shitting on stealth and git gud.
---
Same, a 20% increase on a 2 or 3 second animation is shit all compared to so many other perks you can use in its place, I really don't understand why it's used
---
Except the dev's acknowledged this and now consider it a feature.
---
Real talk I saw this shit on the store a month ago what is wrong with y‚Äôall
---
Not really sure what your going on about, here ill provide an example since you seem to be having trouble understanding. "The captives rescued themselves from their captors clutches by cutting the knots that bound them in place" As you can clearly see the word "rescue" and past tense form "rescued" can be used in reference to one's self.
---
Beyond throwing ad hominem at me, you have yet to explain why the definition provided isn't correct. Are you attempting to say a respected dictionary is incorrect?
---
Very true. As a survivor I usually hate these team mates, but I'll be honest, sometimes there is a decent player using urban evasion/spine chill effectively. As a spirit main, immersed players with Urban and Iron Will are my worst nightmare. It can actually be very effective in some cases.
---
Billy is trash on Haddonfield if you don't have Instant Saw add-ons. And I want to say that Spirit with Prayer Beads is amazing on this map.
---
Not thicc enough but her face and hair match Jane so well!
---
I really want to know what maps are considered killer sided or at least balanced ( besides The Game, and even that map isn't too good for Billy or Huntress ).
---
What's kobe?
---
When I'm playing killer there are definitely some hits that shouldn't have hit. I lunged at someone as Spirit the other day and there's no way it even looked like they remotely connected with my weapon. I don't know if it's just ping. Huntress hatchets are also iffy as hell right now, specifically on auto haven wreckers because we had one huntress throwing them through cars/ tires. It seems like recently they've gotten worse.
---
I played against a camping legion with noed... The totem was right at the hook too
---
Oh I‚Äôm sorry you poor soul
---
This would be an amazing matching survivor for The Bee‚Ñ¢
---
I'm watching 25% of all my games freeze in the loading menu or take 5-6 minutes to load instead of 5-10 seconds. It's been this way since they launched this mess of a game and the devs just keep crapping out DLC and the problems never get fixed.
---
Oh hey I didn't know The Entity played Rocket League,I guess that the entity truly does what it wants just like Mathieu said
---
There was, and perhaps currently is a bug, is when a chest spawns next to a bed, and killer grabs the survivor off, both of them teleport on top of the bed, you could use that to make this just perfect
---
Agreed. The other perks are useless but YNTUA cool be fun. Especially combined with Head-On
---
Again, I've never had these issues ü§∑ sorry to hear you gotta deal with them tho that blows
---
"others are worse" doesn't excuse how up-shits-creek DBD is imo. 25% of all my games have problems loading, and I reinstalled when trying it again this month. Games like Friday the 13th might be clunky unpolished messes but that doesn't mean DBD isn't a complete mess too. imo DBD is worse because they've continued to have the funding to crap out DLCs but almost nothing gets fixed. The only reason they're banning people for the latest Legion exploit is because it started dominating every video about the game on Youtube and twitch
---
I want Kate to carry me in those arms.
---
I know many people who've had the same issues. I would be more lenient if it seemed to be something on my end, but it's clear that a solid chunk of the playerbase gets these kind of issues constantly. There's people reporting they have to validate the files basically every day, others just get a 50/50 chance to even load into the game. It's been this way for 3 years now clearly and the devs just keep chugging the DLC-production along and seem to pretend this isn't happening.
---
I don‚Äôt think this is what a lag switch looks like. There have been more game desync bugs recently which didn‚Äôt have anything to do with connection. Always seems to happen in the basement aswell.
---
Haha, yes I am indeed planning other licensed killers! Before I make another trailer I will more than likely do a "Spotlight" video with chucky and show 3 perks I think would be cool as well as how he works etc.
---
Killer main here, we crave an actual match and (at least I) am trying to wrap it up and move on.
---
 Giving the survivor all the gens and wont give me my BBQ stacks. Devs make it so DCers or no shows count as hooks for BBQ? That's when party games start happening.
---
seeing survs at the end is bitter murmur and it's not a hey perk. 
---
you probably had noed but all totems have been destroyed before the gens were done
---
Noed doesn't show survivors. It increases your movement speed and makes you one hit people
---
NOED doesn‚Äôt show you the auras of players ?
---
What happened to that game? I was recently watching gameplays of it and looks great so far
---
What hill is that and what map?
---
"Why do people play this? I've tried it out again after years and it seems to still be buggy"  
---
"why don't you just leave then!"  
---
Thanks bro.
---
Successfully struggling off hook
---
Do you not know what NOED does? Literally just read the perk description, my guy.
---
You know what... you *may* have a point there =P
---
But that's the sort of mindset symmetrical gameplay fosters. A bunch of oppositional defiant  tweets on one side, and some deeply disturbed sadists (hi!) on the other.
---
Do you want to get more HillBilly in your game? That second perk is how you get more Hillbilly in your game.
---
It makes the game super boring tho. As a Killer it bores me to death when survs play stealth.
---
You‚Äôre literally ranting about why you dislike the game and asking why people are playing it, what did you expect people to do? Beg for you to come back to the game and care?
---
TTV in name = mori snuff show
---
At the cost of having a terrible game experience? That ain‚Äôt it, chief.

[You](https://imgur.com/a/Ze7yFnx) [asked](https://imgur.com/a/v16vYXD) [owo](https://imgur.com/a/K67Lp1S)
---
Some of my best games have been when i caught the little toxic fuckers who thought they were better than me. 
---
Example (one of many of my revenge): once when I was playing billy, a survivor was t bagging me at the gate, but they weren‚Äôt quite in the safe zone. I had run across the map, chainsawing, and got that little fucker. Justice.
---
Different versions of that has happened and it‚Äôs always great.
---
I‚Äôm not a camper and I‚Äôm not a tunneler. And even when they‚Äôre assholes I try to play as fair as I can just to beat them by keeping my cool getting multiple hooks. However, some of those SWF squads have gotten me worked up by loudly following me to the hook, following me in general, and flash lighting‚Äîyou know, the usual‚Äîand I‚Äôve stuck around the hook LOOKING for them or chasing them, etc, and then they‚Äôre toxic fucks calling me a camper, to kill myself, etc. BITCH DON‚ÄôT BE TOXIC. 
---
*sigh*
---
Exposed status effect means it only takes one hit to knock them down, it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with auras. The lingo is a bit confusing if you‚Äôre new.
---
So would you'll never take us alive cause the killer to drop a survivor and blind them both? I like it :)
---
It happened to me only once since DCs are so rampant against Legion but it‚Äôs true. They‚Äôre like Bigfoot; you encounter one and nobody believes you.
---
imo I explained that I was trying the game again after ages, realized not much had changed, and I'm wondering what makes people continue playing when this is the state of the game.
---
What kind of monster uses monstrous shrine?
---
Killers feel they have to camp because of how easy survivors have it, sadly most killers care about kills, not blood points or rank.
---
Really.... really I thought weve gone past this
---
Possibly. However, having it also stun the killer into dropping a survivor might make it a bit unbalanced.
---
the Lobby shouldnt have 200+ ping anyways as you connect to the Server not a random Host.
---
ah, a fellow man of culture.
---
Ace mains rise up
---
our luck is the superior kobe!
---
Nope. You just end up with 1-2 gens down when all your traps are set. Hag is powerful enough that smart trap placement can still get you a 4K.
---
It "Exposes" Players, in dbd that means "Down in 1 hit", a bit weird if you dont know it
---
Don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm being down voted but your welcome
---
I wish, I wouldn‚Äôt stop having sex with it, till it was fluffy mulch.
---
Everyone's a god at dbd until you ask them to prove it
---
Also the fact that most DLCs are cheaper during different discounts.
---
Congrats? I'm honestly not sure what you were trying to accomplish with this post.
---
You just need to change up your tactics or perks. Changing your angle of approach every time you return to a generator will confuse survivors into sneaking right into you sometimes.
---
I feel like the game was originally designed to be way more stealth based, and looping is just something that became the norm and the devs kept it that way. Sometimes I wish this game was more cat and mouse than just looping in circles.
---
Would be so good especially if people enter in the Roleplay
---
Well, most of these perks will change, so wait a few days more for the ptb.
---
Also, I dont think end game colapse is meant  to be (ok Im not very good at English so I will try my best to explain that) the "core" mechanic of the game. The game is still about hooking this boiz, not about killing them with the end game colapse. This mechanic will not give you most of the kills (except for some cases like some pig builds maybe), but may give you the las man because the survivors cant not stay arround waiting for the perfect borrow time moment, they will be forced to leave the game and let their mates hooked (on a feeling).
---
For a long time I was suggesting something like "give the killer more move speed at end game" or something like that. I think BHVR has a better idea. This will make the killer more terrifing and the game much more stresfull for the survivors (as it may be). For the first time in this game, the time is killers friend (as it should be).
---
It feels toxic in SWF when everyone else can coordinate it so that you need to hit 3 people at the hook to hook someone. They know when someone is about to get downed (that you were chasing or a while) and they can set you up so there is nothing you can do. This really feels toxic when you have to carry the survivor for a bit first so that dropping is not an option. 
---
Yes, there is a perk for taking hits, but there is also Insidious who‚Äôs entire purpose is to camp. 
---
The issue is the game developed in a way that the devs had no plan for. Look at the intro. The killer is supposed to be feared. There is no chat in the game for a reason. SFW on coms killed that.
---
But they can guarantee less ping, with the addition of ping thresholds, as long as the feature works. Exhibit A, CS:GO.
---
But swf already exists, and game should be balanced around it. Giving solo players more info is a good way to close gap between swf and solo.
---
"I don't have fun so NOBODY can have fun! If you have fun, your taste in games SUCKS and you should feel bad!"
---
She's on the ground, she could use some ass-istance.
---
He's fun with good add ons
---
Thank you end game collapse to get rid of this. Had a 30 minute period after I killed 2 out of 4 in a bad SFW game where I was just trying to find the last two people and the gates were open. (Didn‚Äôt have whispers).
---
His power has just gotten even more boring now. Hes an m1 killer who gets a free hit, thats all there is too it.
---
Hey, here is a bright idea. Don't hit them all, hit one guy and drop the survivor, then chase the guy you've just hit. Bonus points if you are playing someone who can catch them fast like Spirit or Huntress. That's how slugging works, and it's really effective at putting out pressure on the map.
---
It's not toxic at all, it's gameplay. Do you think it's toxic to bodyblock a survivor in a corner so that they can't dodge your chainsaw?
---
&gt;The killer is supposed to be feared.
---
The game would be fucking dead if it was hide and seek. Most of the playerbase plays for the killer/survivor interaction, not one side sitting in a corner and holding m1 all game while the other side is spending the whole match looking for immersed survivors.
---
I outright avoid people with names like that. They‚Äôre always unreasonably toxic.
---
We don't talk about leatherface
---
Time to break out the Iridescent Hatchets.
---
Speed limiter for hillbilly and Leatherface, stops their chainsaws from insta downing but gives them more BP for chainsaw hits.
---
You got a good amount of points for dealing with a SWF team. They have a huge advantage because they were likely taking to each other on Discord to relay to each other where you were. 
---
You did good for what you could.
---
is this
---
Even though there‚Äôs no excusing 4 DC‚Äôs there‚Äôs no context without showing your rank, offering and perks.
---
I find it fun, just don‚Äôt look at this game as competitive, just enjoy what you can and accept survivor are op, 
---
I like being chased as Survivor and it‚Äôs satisfying when you stealth around. 
---
As Killer, as long as it‚Äôs not SWF it‚Äôs fun out mindgaming people.
---
Tfw you have deadhard and get one shot (Michael, Billy, bubba, noed)
---
I can honestly say that the only time I get into Hatch standoffs are when the doors are already opened and that one survivor decides to waste my time instead of just walking. Out. The. Fucking. Door.
---
I can honestly say that I'm really looking forward to closing them as well.
---
Those addons are ugh to go against though..
---
You like bad ping huh
---
I think we'll have to wait and see. He will be a 115% movement speed killer with an almost free hit to start the chase. It all depends on how much he will struggle for the second one
---
2K hours on both survivor and killer here (used to play nurse around 700 hrs.)
---
I used to play nurse all the time just to rek't those toxic scrubs and P3 Squadette with flashlight. But then I stopped after the clown update and play walking killers instead.
---
It's hard to play killer when you eventually get mad by just playing them, but atleast it's not like the old days where infinite loops, instant flashlight, pallet-vacuum still exists.
---
I hade Ruin, enduring, NOED and nurse‚Äôs calling I‚Äôm rank 18 but I never play killer and I‚Äôm mostly main survivor but I thought it was pretty fun because I‚Äôm not so good with killer tbh. I now billy dose not require skill.
---
I now
---
I played with this guy. We met a Legion and he did DC lmao
---
Bamboozle too
---
You act like healing is not quick for mid game and this is not a problem at end game. 
---
Dropping someone is not an option when you were carrying them for a bit. A drop near the end of the wiggle bar results in a stun. It is either 30% or 25% wiggle bar progress. This is an issue. The Devs, like usual, added a Perk to resolve this instead of fixing the core game to make it balanced. 
---
You did not address the statement. The killer IS supposed to be feared. You and others not fearing the killer shows how much the game keeps straying. You are proving my point.
---
Found one of the survivors in the screenshot
---
spoken like a true entitled Survivor main
---
It's the way the hit system works once you press the button to swing whatever is in your current hitbox is what gets hit.
---
This is typically why people get hit through pallets because they hit registered before they threw down the pallet they get hit regardless.
---
Basically think of it as a small arc in front of the Killer once you press the button whatever's in that arc is getting hit.
---
This often means that hits that shouldn't have hit end up hitting and hits that definitely connected with the survivors miss because they technically want in the hit box at the time
---
because the devs actively communicate with the community, and despite seeming like it, theyre not completely oblivious to the issues. They're incompetent but not stupid and they're a lot more "personal" with the community than most dev-teams.
---
Well they decided to add some shit to the new legion nerf
---
And temple is double the  p a l l e t
---
I bet the one on the left has an amazing booty hole.
---
So Jane is both the person at the reception and his wife?
---
2nd perk is ridiculously broken
---
1st perk: useless
---
2nd perk: brokenly OP
---
3rd perk: interesting
---
Art
---
&gt; Well, most of these perks will change, so wait a few days more for the ptb.
---
&gt; 
---
Not according to the devs. So far they only specifically listed Left Behind and Remember Me.
---
&gt;#WILL ANY END GAME PERKS RECEIVE CHANGES?
---
&gt;Most end game perks will remain unchanged, but there will be tweaks to the following perks:
---
&gt;* Remember Me
---
&gt;* Left Behind
---
That average is not even close to 20. I was playing with a rank 20 buddy who just bought the game and I was rank 7 at the time and we never played someone under 13.
---
Anyone can start as obsession now, when the guy with DS uses it, he gets obsession
---
*know
---
Could someone clarify what 360'd means? It's the first time I've heard of it
---
What have you done!?
---
I'm on console and never went vs a good Huntress. The one I did go against eariler hard patrolled the hooked survivor. Her shots were point on but I dodge them so easily. She's a really fun killer but in higher ranks..OOF.
---
If survivors are smart, they will 99% both exit gates and just continue to play as they are before the "EGC". 
---
EGC only triggers when an exit gate is open so all you have to do is keep gates closed if you still need to do something in the trial. 
---
Obviously in solo play this will be harder to accomplish but SWF should have no problem at all playing around EGC.
---
This comment is cursed
---
Downvote cuz legion
---
inb4 taken down for ‚Äúunrelated content‚Äù
---
The game can suck to get into, especially with matchmaking being kind of shit. But keep at it! The game gets better once you get more experienced
---
Adam‚Äôs coat would fit better.  Also you forgot about the red stain.
---
&gt;Dropping someone is not an option when you were carrying them for a bit. A drop near the end of the wiggle bar results in a stun. It is either 30% or 25% wiggle bar progress. This is an issue. The Devs, like usual, added a Perk to resolve this instead of fixing the core game to make it balanced. 
---
But why pick them up after that? Chase the guy you've hit, hook them, leave the other guy on the ground and use him as bait/source of pressure. You are pulling everyone off of generators as someone has to unhook and someone has to pick the guy off the ground. You don't need to hook the first guy immediately, the killer doesn't have to hook people immediately. Slugging is a thing, and commonly used by more experienced players.
---
&gt;and coordination was specifically NOT added to the game for that reason.
---
&gt;You did not address the statement. The killer IS supposed to be feared. You and others not fearing the killer shows how much the game keeps straying. You are proving my point. 
---
I have addressed your point. I've said that if the killer was as feared as you are saying he should, the game would've been hide and seek instead of what it currently is. It wouldn't have any longevity and people would stop playing it.
---
They've added swf shortly after the game was introduced, if they didn't want coordination they would have removed it.
---
Anyone who doesn‚Äôt feel the same way, deserves to be cursed.
---
Unnerving presence does effect jigsaw boxes in fact currently the only killer perk that does.
---
Huntress lullaby doesn't work on it. Thanatophobia doesn't work on them.
---
Third seal as you stated before doesn't work
---
The one downside to this ( besides the severe lack of synergy) is unnerving presence by itself is rubbish. For most competent survivors who can hit skill checks it literally just makes it easier to get greats.
---
In fact the only reason unnerving presence is good on the doctor is simply because Madness skill checks help throw it off
---
Whats your gamer tag I can help you out and teach you how to 360 and some other stuff if you want
---
David‚Äôs not in this photo tho
---
I‚Äôm a rank 1 killer and the only advice I can give you is to keep at it. I remember when I was new I played a non m1 killer (a killer who is reliant on their power) so I didn‚Äôt get the experience needed so when I left grey ranks I got annhilated every time. I switched to a different killer and got the experience needed. Glad to see your playing an m1 killer to start so you just need time.
---
I use Mori:s vs toxic swf. I call it "Die with friends" and say it at the end of the match, while I receive their stuttering salt with delight. Welcome to the other side brother.
---
Who needs camping when you can just make it a 3v1 on second hook? ; - )
---
alright still not bannable
---
but t1 myers is weak and myers is only t1 in the very beginning
---
I would like to see something other than the bulb everytime I get a pink offering on my blood web. I have 30 if them on my main. I would also like bloody party streamers or green envelopes to come up more. I hardly ever get them anymore.  I spent 500k in bloodpoints on my main the other day and not 1 bloody party streamer.
---
I mean I'd rather chase someone for 5 minutes then find nobody at all in 5 minutes
---
if thats all a perk did that would be weak tbh
---
Link to these answers?
---
Indeed thanks to killers, but thanks to survivors like you as well who do not play toxic and are empathetic. I wish toxic killers and survivors alike were like you

Your advice pretty much amounts to play three specific Killers or get bent
---
I don't necessarily have a massive problem with the perk but the main issue is it wastes time and there's no counter to it. ( without being completely scummy)
---
1) Now you could camp the person until death
---
2) Camp them into struggle and then immediately tunnel them for the death hook
---
3) Just start bringing in ebony mori camp the 
---
survivor until they get freed and then tunnel and Mori them.
---
None of these methods are typically fun for the survivor or the killer
---
Say what you will about the old decisive strike but at least every killer had the option of just juggling the survivor if they were close enough to a hook.
---
It's countered by a majority of killer attacks, nurse blink, pig dash etc it just means you can't rely on M1's, which is annoying for sure and I don't disagree that it's a strong perk, but It's not as bad as the old DS as at least it doesn't stun and still awards points for hitting them.
---
lmfao

&gt;Scroll down to the Q&amp;A part
---
&gt;https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57702/the-legion-update
---
They updated it, interesting. At first it only listed Iri Button if I am not mistaken. 
---
Thanks for providing the link.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with Nurse mains? She‚Äôs a high skill high reward killer, who twists the game by making it reliant on how many mistakes she makes rather than how many mistakes survivors make against other killers. That dynamic may seem unfun but stealth is a great counter
---
She can‚Äôt kill what she can‚Äôt see, with no inherent form of anti-stealth just keep an eye out and listen for the shrieks. Honestly fighting her feels like going against a real horror movie killer, since as soon as she finds you there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôre dead. I find it fun, the heart stopping moments wondering if she saw me, only for her to walk past
---
Feared does not mean OP where the survivors need to go immersed. It means balanced. Stop thinking that it means swinging the pendulum way in the other direction.  The Devs should have integrated some of the perks into the main gameplay and not made them perks. This includes WGLF, a survivor perk. 
---
SWF doesn‚Äôt mean active coms. The devs have explicitly stated in a stream that they did not add coms because they wanted the fear and tension of being alone. They did not want Discord. In fact, using it is technically a violation of using 3rd party software, but they don‚Äôt enforce it.  There are too many streamers using it, though, so they are not going to do anything about it. This is why they should just integrate coms and balance killers around it. 
---
You obviously have your opinion about what you think the game is as a survivor main. I am not likely going to change that.
---
Never played against Legion? You're blessed, son.
---
&gt; It's countered by a majority of killer attacks, nurse blink
---
This is getting "fixed".
---
No way, my boi Bill would be talking to Nurse about both their breathing problems, though I‚Äôm sure Nurse doesn‚Äôt smoke
---
Rng isnt predictions though
---
I had them as well lol, jumped over pallets right at the start, downed them and they just went.
---
I like to find the hatch for the points tbh. But that‚Äôs just me being silly sometimes.
---
Yeahso I can get flamed for using by own build instead of the meta? No thanks.
---
I always found it funny watching youtubers laughing when they make 360 montage stuff then start getting pissy when they are losing, it really shows they enjoy the bullying but not being bullied then people start thinking that's what the games about and just follow in the footsteps of the toxic content creators. My favourite part of the game was getting messages from people that were nice it happened so rarely I would always try and say something nice or give tips to people I was unfairly matched against to try and help them get better at the game.
---
So Legion is basically a worst version of Spirit.
---
playing killer is a form of self-torture change my mind.
---
im really enjoying the game at the minute. i was like you and took a huge break from the game so i might just be going through my honeymoon stage all over again but i think the game is in a good place, and i generally find the plague to be fun to go against. the introduction of the end game collapse is lit as well
---
And the last for 6 months...
---
Saw someone whose name was Grab=DC. Immediately chose Spirit with Prayer Beads, and as luck would have it, he was grabbed at the start of the match. Insta dc, and farmed with everyone else.
---
Fellow Wraith main, it‚Äôs already been mentioned that Spirit Fury is a God send on him. And if you‚Äôre like me, you enjoy the mindgame aspect of Wraith‚Äôs power so you‚Äôll be a great Spirit when you get used to her. 
---
On an unrelated topic don‚Äôt forget to get BBQ before it leaves the bloodweb and takes another 2 years (Or soon after a killer rework, coincidentally) to come back!
---
DC's aren't acceptable, under any circumstances
---
Hard to kill what was never alive.
---
you can only get 4 purple flashlights full of teabagging p3 claudettes before you just face camp anyone that even looks like they might be an asshole (everyone is an asshole after playing killer long enough)
---
There‚Äôs no counter play with a competent nurse, you will be going down faster then a mixtape Legion.
---
&gt;  boy, you do not wanna live in a world without test servers
---
The alternative to test servers is not "no PTB".  What about actually have a decent QA team?
---
other than my dear sweet Amanda my other 2 mains are hag &amp; clown... i hate you... that's the killer perspective
---
(just a joke fyi(seriously, the amount of people that don't understand jokes on this sub...))
---
Yeah, thats also true
---
As I said, stealth is excellent against her. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, she‚Äôs THE most powerful killer since she wins chases outright but that just means that instead of focusing on looping and distracting the killer, you need to hide and use your wits
---
Th0nks
---
Then noed ftw xD
---
somebody has always gotta be in ~~Freddy~~ Legion tier.
---
Especially when they bum rush the hook, or the gates are open. What else is the killer supposed to do at that point?
---
That‚Äôs the PS4 version for you.
---
Wake up should have it opening speed increased.
---
Literally just having somebody with leader by you outperforms wake up considering it was released with Freddy it should at least be counter to remember me.
---
Technician should reduce all sounds that the generator can produce not just the sounds of you working on it. 
---
This would mean if someone has technician the killer would have to actively going visually see if the gen is being worked on. However once the person who has technician get off the gen or if somebody without technician starts working within the noise should come back.
---
It‚Äôs not perfect, never will be, but survivors aren‚Äôt as overwhelmingly overpowered like they used to be, the games probably the most balanced it‚Äôs ever been.
---
Luckily, your approval isn't needed for us to play whatever Killer we fuckin' want.
---
wow that addon went from the most OP addon to one of the worst addons ever
---
i'd rather just M1 them normally than spend up to like 2 minutes waiting for my power to fully recharge just so i can stab them again. 
---
i really feel like these changes to Legion aren't final and will probably be changed around in the PTB or after it.
---
Such innocence...
---
Cool, you just lose any respect and have no reason to brag when you win,
---
When the gates open I understant camping, I would do the same. There isnt much left to do.
---
There are no objectives, exactly. Outside of that situation, I‚Äôm one of the rarer non-camping Wraiths who prefers to use my mobility instead or standing still near a hook
---
Amanda is going to need you to leave... for... reasons...
---
I meant as head piece. Make it thick enough so it has no clipping issues with the casual jacket
---
I get this with the hag some times, then I have to try to explain how her traps work.
---
But Trapper is *always* smiling.
---
People can and will complain at all times, dont let them kill your experience in the game if you like it. I personnaly enjoy it a lot. The plague is pretty awesome too
---
Where is cheese
---
Don‚Äôt know what people think when I crouch to unhook them, then they sprint away only to of course be instadowned 
---
Of course you‚Äôre just a camping Hag though, get good camping is a handicap /s
---
This seems like it went a lot better than my first game back today did, at least. 
---
Played Plague and played just horribly. Devour Hope spawned almost in the center of the map and my first 2 chases lasted way too long. 
---
It was on Coal Tower as well, so it's not like I can even use map selection as an excuse. I just sucked at timing, tracking, pressure, everything.
---
Considering the situation is completely reversed on console, I don't think the argument hold much water. I think we've gotten an influx of newer players and killer tends to be more fun to mess around with until you have an understanding of the game.
---
Probably because DBD lost a huge part of their competent killer player base. You think it‚Äôs a coincidence BBQ and another meta killer perk just happened to appear on the shrine? Fuck no dude, that shit isn‚Äôt random. It‚Äôs a last ditch effort to attract more killers. They‚Äôve had that card under their sleeve for a long time now and have been saving it for when they know they screwed up.
---
I don‚Äôt think the majority of killers quit, I just think most of us are really burnt out with things like MoM amongst other things, and playing way less because of it. That‚Äôs my story anyways. 
---
So you guys get stuck with the newer killers who don‚Äôt know how to do anything but camp or tunnel.
---
Source: that‚Äôs my story. 
---
Enjoy the game.

Red ranked 400 hour killer that didn‚Äôt main nurse or billy. Nor camp or tunnel.
---
Oh Jesus I didn't know about Endgame collapse, I just watched the video. When does this go into effect? I just played a bunch of matches yesterday but didn't encounter it
---
Change you sensitivity settings in the dbd setting page to 100. It still isn't great but it helps a lot with 360s. If you ever wanna try it, I'd be down for a kyf so you can practice
---
He's the opposite of a "crutch killer". He was just reaching for insults because he was bad enough to die to a brand new player. You did pretty good considering, I wouldn't beat yourself up over your performance or dwell on the obviously salty person too much. They just want to drag you down to their level.
---
Squads that sabotage hooks aren't super common. People can get dailies to sabotage hooks as well so it's not always malicious. Teabagging is a bit more common but you gotta learn to laugh it off. Every second they spend teabagging at a pallet is lost distance for them, just think of it that way.
---
If trash talking in the psot-game lobby bothers you you can always close the chat with the arrow to the side of the chatbox. It'll stay closed for the rest of your session so you can just avoid any potential salt and idiocy. In the end though, it's even better to just not take any of it seriously whatsoever. DBD is not a competitive or balanced game so you shouldn't put any emotional stake into it.
---
Feedback would be appreciated :D
---
Heavy smoker nurse disagrees
---
Nurse‚Äôs Calling (No terror radius means nobody knows when they‚Äôre safe and for some reason self care is still so popular)
---
Spirit Fury (You can usually use your power to mindgame in chases but sometimes you just have to power through each one, especially on the coldwind maps. Don‚Äôt respect them with this perk, it‚Äôs just extending the chase. A broken pallet usually leads to a free hit before they reach the next one)
---
Hex: Devour Hope (A more controversial choice but I prefer punishing the survivors for just rushing gens instead of almost forcing them to with Ruin unless it‚Äôs someone woth
---
If I'm understanding correctly, the killer closing the hatch only applies if a survivor opens it with a key?
---
Holy shit, this made it to reddit? I never expected to find it here, I got my friends to go default Dwight squad as a joke and then we decided in being pizza boys with pizza toppings for names
---
Time to mori hawaiian
---
Got Ormond 3 times in a row yesterday and I swear I‚Äôd taken haddonfield over that
---
It looks great, you could make decals for computers and stuff.
---
I think they should give rewards for playing instead of punishing leavers, or maybe both options. People DC because there's no point in ranking up, absolutely none (except achievements which most of the dedicated players already have). Just make a point in ranking up and then, maybe insert a punish for quitters. 
---
They could give a blood point multiplier the higher you are ranked, for ex.
---
Lies, meatlovers is my favorite so it just made me sad.
---
Until the killer opens them
---
The devs originally intended it to be a solo teamwork game in the sense that you couldn't really communicate with your team, so you had to figure out who to trust and who not, who you could rely on, and who you wanted to rely on you. That original playstyle they intended is why you have to reinvite everyone to swf lobbies as well, because it wasn't an originally intended mechanism
---
It would be neat af if they added a proxy chat like in Friday 13 though
---
I got into the game saw 2 of my friends, turns around then got disconnected saying that the host DCed but my friends said they were still in the game, I was really sad too lol
---
Oh you idiot
---
Another "survivors are toxic" post..
---
Exactly! Haha, the other day I had 2 TTVs in my lobby and the one teabagged the other while I spirit mori'd them.
---
I linked my friends this post so they're probably looking through/will look through here
---
The hook progression stopping when camping was tested in the ptb and got abused by swf groups to punish not camping killer waisting all of their time, and that's why it didn't go love.
---
Tbh I feel like vigil is in a good place when used in builds. When using t3 vigil and a t3 exhaustion perk, it reduces the exhaustion by 8 seconds. So vigil + sprint burst can make sprint nurses be used every 32 seconds, that‚Äôs like how sprint burst was when the game first came out.
---
But when it‚Äôs not used in builds, it is kinda useless tho.
---
Omfg I love it
---
U know that 300 hours isnt even much
---
YES OH GOD PLEASE YES
---
This seems like such a good idea and will remove hard-core farming and all the uneccesery grind

I was the Hawaiian!\~

No bulli for u

---
Yeah maybe... i'll just have to see
---
It's actually a YPG-235! very good keyboards IMO.
---
Why do you feel that? I'm not asking to argue, I just want to understand why some players feel so strongly about it. I've seen a number of salt posts, one in particular that caused me to make this one, about how one survivor perk or one mechanic or one map is making someone want to quit the game, insult the devs ridiculously, and insult anyone else who has a different perspective. I'm curious to where that kind of thought originated from
---
Yes for new players like me, this is such hardcore grind and people argue with
---
"if you Don't like grinding, dbd isn't for you"
---
OR
---
"grinding makes the player get invested in the game more"
---
Dude I have 2500 hours in csgo I don't need hardcore BP grind to play a game I like, it's just too much for new players that often take the fun out of the game it's like , oh I need that teachable, gotta level up nurse, then even if you do there is no confirmation that you're gonna get it in your desired blood web
---
It sucks, I heard people saying to remove perk tiers and I agree as that will reduce the grind
---
Believe it or not I like doing that provided that that teammate actually deserved to get Moried.
---
Honestly lampkin lane is one of my favorite maps to play hag on
---
Being small is also a plus since they are harder to see during certain loops. Also trappers needs to get 2 hits without ability and has nothing to slow the game down, while legion will need only 1 and then it will slow down the game a lot more than trapper with all the healing/mending going on
---
i'm aware hahah, but it's still a great amount of time staring at that loading screen
---
They need to have more rewards for playing the full game and some sort of discouragement for not. Tbh id be fine with a significant blood point and shard percentage taken away. Idk about pc but I'm on console and majority of the time, if I dc at the beginning it's because I have a glitch (usually the wiggle one that makes it insanely hard to move), and if I dc later in game, for a while it was because I was so fed up with killers just camping and tunneling non stop, match after match after match. I've stopped dcing for that reason because I figure that's part of why killers have done that, since I've played killer for a while now. But I think, with all the glitches going unmatched that are game breaking or make the game insanely difficult to function in, it shouldn't be a time out punishment.
---
True. I don't have bbq yet so I haven't been able to see how it feels to play, I forget it stacks from hooks alone and not necessarily kills.
---
If we played again I'd be breaking out the OP Burgerking Myers out of spite. 2fast.
---
When you use shadowborn for the first time
---
A man of culture, I see
---
What is this perk? It‚Äôs like the subs favourite perk besides bbq and chilli
---
Scenarios like this are why BHVR needs to get the DC situation in order. Sucks, dude.
---
Who wouldn't want to turn Kate into a duckling :D
---
How do you go about getting that ID? Fairly new to steam still , I take it there is another ID rather than the display name ?
---
Well us Domino's employees have been receiving training and won't lay down easy
---
the amount of survivors that DC on their first down pisses me off as a survivor main, grow tf up if u dont wanna play just die on the hook
---
#P I Z Z A

---
I had this issue for months. Do you also get kicked out of lobbies or games randomly?
---
Joshu's lame and not as cold blooded as the others. Especially when we have a perfectly good business man from quiet Morioh.
---
That is true, but toxicity is something we can at least help change, we can whine and complain to the devs about the issues and that's it, after that it's up to them
---
Oh please. He'd only WRY for his mori. Getting stunned would just incite a hateful "muda muda..."
---
I HAAATE that. I main hag and people get so mad that I know my trap placements- in certain parts of buildings, inside shack and outside god pallet, so on. I got a message accusing me of tunneling- only salt message I've gotten since I started- and I was surprised. Not that hag is common to come across on ps4 though
---
A bunch of salty killers whining is the problem
---
This problem has been getting worse and worse this entire year. Annoyingly, the reaction from the community so far is mostly "lol, so??".
---
Hopefully once dedicated servers are implemented this behavior will be properly punished.
---
These upcoming weeks are going to be a DC fest
---
I laughed at this more than I should have.
---
I can help! In the PS4 website it will create a video where it will show your top 3 most played games on that account. Mine was 2000 hours. Hope this helped :)
---
Already got BBQ my wraith king
---
This was actually REALLY GOOD. Loved it.
---
The owner of the oink organization himself
---
Woah what happened to the text of the last paragraph
---
Deliverance guarantees you a self unhook on your first hook if you get a safe hook rescue on another survivor
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a survivor main and the rare time (literally 3 times per year) I play killer it always becomes evident what a bunch of scumbags survivors are. It‚Äôs crazy because it only takes one game for me to completely shift my biased survivor perspektiven to see them for the vermin they are.
---
Had this happen to me with Freddy. Get the Paintbrush and Pill Bottle, load in and it's already 2v1. The others DC and add ons are gone. :(
---
So basically this perk is only good once?
---
Honestly, that crow perk is a pretty good idea as long as the killer sees you too when you make a crow fly away
---
Bill takes care of their own now.
---
Of course, but that's the worst case, it's really just a different kind of headgame
---
That wiggle glitch is a pain, I've had three in the past 24 hours. I try not to DC but I can't survive loops with it...
---
Don't let the negative comments get to you, lots of killers feel your frustrations. Even when they finally give us the ability to close the hatch, they find a way to twist the knife even more. 
---
3 minutes is already more enough time, so the timer slowing to a crawl when survivors are in the dying state or hooked is absolute bullshit. The way that countdown bar looks it seems like it'll last 4-6 minutes if you hook someone. What kind of pressure is that for a countdown? Why should a killer hooking someone punish the killer during the end game? The timer should never slow down.
---
And then they take away a killer being able to grab you if you jump in the hatch in addition to giving you three escape possibilities even if you don't get any gens done. You can be terrible all game and hide in a corner then get the hatch at the end, and the killer doesn't pip because you escaped. Absurd.
---
As for DC bans.. not one person has ever came on here and said they were banned for ragequitting, so we know there is no ban policy for it. It's all bs that BHVR lied to us about. Ragequitting is at an all time high with no end in sight. It's only going to get dealt with if killers start doing it more which will cause survivors to make a stink about it. So long as survivors are doing it a majority of time it's a non-issue for BHVR.
---
DS.. buffed within 1 month of being nerfed. Mettle of Man at some point will probably to be buffed to affect killer's with powers, not nerfed in any way. And now the Pig's traps are about to get nerfed.
---
And don't be surprise if they nerf basements so that the stairs can be safer/wider as well just to appease survivors during the end-game. Can't have basements being a place to fear can we? Gotta guarantee those escapes.
---
Why are they holding these skins hostage üò°
---
I agree. I don't run MoM because of my playstyle. I tried it once and honestly hated it, it felt a bit gross to use. 
---
I wish they'd stop pushing new chapters and start adding new mechanics and stuff too. We have enough killers to be pacified for a year, especially if they're releasing content that effects how the game functions, like end game collapse for instance. Like they have a good amount now, they could totally focus on bugs, patches, and objectives. We need some QoL changes.
---
I hope someone other than me gave you a good answer.
---
Yes there is no matchmaking that is worth a damn in this game. What Behaviour call matchmaking is making sure there are at least 4 other people in a game with you.
---
It's actually a fun game if you ignore all of the bad matchmaking the only issue you will have is the grind to get enough Bloodpoints to make your character any way useful.
---
The best hint I can give you is to play Survivor with David until he is leveled up enough then keep playing him to get BP to spend on other characters including killers.
---
You will learn to deal with windows and pallets in time. You need to be using a high level killer or you will get players running rings around you when they know they can because your low level because it gets them BP. When you have a high level killer people will just cry NOED sucks and DC before you hook them so get use to people being morons.
---
I just deleted it to see if I reinstalled it if it would work. But I play using my hotspot because I can‚Äôt get internet where I live. Other games my connection is really good but it‚Äôs just Dead by Daylight that causing me issues right now.
---
Funny enough, I made it because of your post, lol.
---
Fairly sure you are bugged. Close and restart the Lobby.
---
Are you on console or PC?
---
A lot of people are mentioning Bloodwarden but because of the way hooking while End Game is in effect works I think it ultimately does not matter. The time for the collapse to complete is slowed while survivors are on hook. So even if Bloodwarden is activated. It doesn't give survivors only 2 minutes to escape. They are still going to have more than 3 minutes to get out. If that wasn't a feature Bloodwarden would be a lot stronger but the timer already negates the perk. I think Freddy is only really going to be effective when he has multiple survivors in the dream world and they try to open the gate after the hatch has been closed. But even then all the survivors will do is wake each other up.
---
Literally outside of Freddy and hatch standoffs I have no clue how this actually helps killer unless survivors get MUCH more bloodpoints for unhooking a survivor during this phase of the game. So that the survivors are more likely to get themselves killed. I mean all the survivors have to do is get out. Maybe someone else can explain what this actually brings to the table. 3 minutes is just a lot of time to work with. If it was just 1 or 2 minutes. Then yeah this would be a big deal. But 3 minutes has basically no impact.
---
A whole 3 minute timer that gets activated only after the doors open, instead of after the last gen got finished, is probably one of the dumbest things the developer ever did. 
---
This whole collapse thing will be so pointless.
---
Only good change is, finally, the introduction of the hatch mechanic.
---
Yep. I found a way to navigate it decently but even then it still isn't fun to play with. I've been lucky to not get the mega character glitch at least. I've gotten to the point with it where I just throw a pallet down or vault a window and crouch so the killer kills me, and get their bit of points instead of just a quitter bonus.
---
or running resilience too. i just got into that.
---
It's a whopping 3 minutes. Nothing will change and they will continue to show off.
---
Editorialization aside, you are generally correct here.
---
The OC said he loved the funny vignette and wanted to believe it wasn't staged, then the OP said it wasn't staged. That is misleading and false.
---
That's how mine was, but my other games aren't solely online like dbd is. I've used hotspot before and it's not the best and could be where your problems originate from. Keep pushing through, if the reinstall works then that's great! Be sure to update the post if that fixes it so peiple who search for this issue or sees it will know to try that
---
Does it? The timer is slowed whenever a survivor is hooked. So they will get more than 3 minutes to get out. It just gives the survivors an extra minute to unhook.
---
I don't run noed as killer either, and I hate going against it as survivor but there's pretty much no way to stop people from using it. If you asked survivors to stop using(insert strong perk here) they wouldn't and same goes for killers
---
*"If you wanna be my lover, you guys do fucking gens"*
---
New meme format?
---
[Deliverance](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Deliverance)? it allows you to escape a hook when you help someone else. good perk on its own, but some perks work well with it, like [Breakdown](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Breakdown)
---
got a 90 ping survivor when playing killer, playing hillbilly i hit them on that window and it registered  even though it was a chainsaw hit. they immediately dc'd and i dont blame them.
---
Yeah. Its decent, pretty niche i think
---
So the hatch can't even be closed before the exit gates are open? Lol the killer is legit going to have to open the gate that gives survivors 3+ minutes to escape? Alright then.
---
Imagine running Myers with noed.. boosted ass killer.
---
Wow thanks for the silver medal you legend!
---
I'm not sure what it means, but thanks!
---
*no one cares*
---
Could be. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I haven't check for "wiggle" but you can remap your controls. Idk if that's helpful
---
*cough*
---
Yeah, why not?
---
That's not a killer buff, that's how it should have been right from the start.
---
If you find the hatch first, you get out and you're safe, obviously. If I find the hatch first as killer, then you simply don't get out, cause I was here first. I don't even see how there is any discussion potential here.
---
How bout take 3 hits to go down but if you get hooked you start at stage 2 straight to the space jam.
---
They are so out of touch with their own game, it's not even funny.
---
What if the devs actually fixed the game so people dont want to dc
---
PC, ive tried restarting the lobby a few times same happens
---
There needs to be some incentive to not leave. Getting first downed usually means a shit game for the survivor where they spend the whole game just being on hook or tunneled.
---
I hate going against billys.. bbq Carrys them. It make me crazy. You know how annoying it is to try to fix a gen and someone goes down every 20 seconds? Run and find a locker each time because hiding behind gens doesnt always work depending on the angle of it.  For like 2 hours all my team faced was Billy's.  I was like if her face 1 more I'm gonna  DC. I'm over and not having fun.. maybe it was the same thing for them. Idkk..
---
so?
---
*Slander*
---
You‚Äôre good at discrediting those who may accuse you. When you‚Äôre aura may be shown to the killer, instead reveal the aura of a survivor for *4/3/2* seconds.
---
*Puddin pops*
---
You‚Äôre charisma distracts others from you‚Äôre crimes. When you‚Äôre aura is revealed to the killer, instead show the aura *10/15/20* meters to either the right or left.
---
*Shhhhh...*
---
You‚Äôre a master of medicine and manipulation. After successfully healing another survivor to full, they will gain one token. Each token will block any detection perk. Also, if The Nightmare is present, they will fall into the dream world upon token consumption.
---
Her body is 2D lol

90% of the Myers I go against run noed. I played against a Myers who went from 0k to a 4k because he got me then my teammates decided to be altruistic rather than just escape(which I would have definitely preferred). Crazy how noed can change the outcome of a match.
---
She needs to inspect that suspecious object... For hum... 
---
Science ! Yeah science !
---
There would be tension with a faster timer after someone got hooked while the timer is running.
---
There is zero tension with doing the opposite.
---
i hope that hitting a survivor twice in Feral Frenzy will do something, maybe give a sort of Hindered effect, maybe a reverse of that little Sprint Burst effect they get when hit. though i'm not sure if that would be fair. i don't think it would be that OP because if they do that, they'll have to go through their ARGHGHH cooldown. it might become a bit OP with cooldown addons but most survivors would probably have Dead Hard to counter such a thing.
---
My words exactly man. I agree 100%. Id love for them to take a break on pushing new content and bandaid it with events while they focus on core issues and bug fixes that have been in the game forever now.
---
No comeback on the Pig dash I see? OINK
---
You information is incorrect. As of Patch 2.6.0, which was added on March 6 2019, they have actually added pallets to every map, and hit boxes are frustratingly unchanged from this games inception. 
---
How long have you been playing this game?
---
If the doors are already open and then he's being able to hook one, of course he's staying there, why wouldn't he? It's probably his last change to hook someone. Going away from that is just dumb.
---
The missing eye of the last skull makes it even better. Like an actual skull missing an actual eye, the soul of a now erased and consumed survivor or something.
---
Glad to see I am not the only nice killer
---
The problem is there's almost no way to nerf nurse without turning her into crap. I say we just leave her but perhaps remove the ability to get 4 or 5 blinks. This is more anecdotal, but most nurses I play against are bad-decent and I personally enjoy chases against a nurse more than any other killer. I feel like it's a battle of juking each other and it's fun rather than just run to a pallet loop, rinse and repeat.
---
He had one job...
---
But I literally end up having a pip up match even if I get downed first, people be acting like downed first means they can't pip up. I even pip up in games occasionally if people do DC or kill themselves it's just alot harder and depends on the killers skill level.
---
Billy is trash on haddonfield, because he can't use his sprint properly (so many corners, corridors and other junk) and he can be looped normally, which is horrible on some haddonfield's pseudo infinites. 
---
Hag is shit because every place has a vault or pallet nearby so better survivors can just yeet over your traps. And 110% move speed means there are a lot of real infinites for hag
---
Nurse is nurse but that map has a lot of LOS breakers, so it's a bad map for nurse too.
---
Trapper is a pretty good killer there, but he is always good when there are infinites that people try to abuse. If the survivors can disarm your traps though... well youre out of luck
---
Woooooo stop here dude! Pig ain't a holy killer?
---
Its better than spending 10 minutes looking for a survivor whos just hiding at 4+ gens. Immersed survivors who want hatch are always gonna be there
---
Honestly just wait for them to say a curse word or make them mad with Kindness and when they curse hit them with a report and they will get punishment for it lmao
---
I love team names. Last night I played with Dad, Adopted Child 1, Adopted Child 2, and they were fucking hilarious. We started the match with me laughing my ass off. One of them mistook my Meg as Nea in pre-game chat, then started yelling "I'M SORRY MEG. DAD NEVER TOOK ME TO THE EYE DOCTOR."
---
Some people have fun makimg others mad
---
For me, Billy is one of the most fun killers to play against. For the disconnects it does not even matter what killer people play - get found  and downed fast = dc for so many.  And that snowballs. One disconnects, everyone else are  "justified" to disconnect now.  
---
FeelsBadMan
---
For sure, but I got 500 hours atm, and I've felt "done" with perks, killer and survivor since around 250 hours
---
Ofc I got many perks not unlocked but there are many I don't want to get, also the shrine is a way that helps your issue if you only want like 1 perk from a character
---
Survivors are only skins in the end, killers you don't need all of them unless you want to play them
---
And yeah ofc it's an incentive, like any game.
---
If we didn't need to unlock perks and we didn't get BP the game just wouldn't feel rewarding and then it gets boring
---
Unrelated, but nice name
---
Thats a good advice, thanks!
---
man, if this is what i sound like to my friends then no wonder I am called a chad.
---
Brutal killer and a 1k with enough hooks on everyone is a dub for me tbh
---
You can't for wiggle, unfortunately. The devs want us to suffer.
---
I‚Äôm dying...
---
I‚Äôve saved my auric cells just for bunny Feng
---
Please release it bhvr.
---
Lol I posted this once and some people told me to stop playing gimmick builds and just let my teammates get the points.
---
**"It was always you Helen"**
---
Play killer, do dailys, when I p3 anyone I'll always save up all the offerings till about level 47 or so, then use up all my offerings with items that compliment that particular offering. Warning though with the current state of the game I p2 Jane few days ago with about 20 combined green and yellow offerings and a few bps. Literally half of those offerings went to waste because of 3v1s starting out, multiple dcs, and kicked from game at loading screen. :(
---
I just respond with *angry penguin noises* or *angry cartoon grumbling*
---
Thats dumb af,
---
I play on PS4 and moving your left stick in a circle works great. Easier on the analog too.
---
BBQ carries them with points sure. But BBQ isn‚Äôt as reliable as you think it is.
---
Suck it up buttercup. Geez... can the survivors have anything without yall killers whining? They buffed bbq,ruin,devour,surveillance,spies and yall still wanna bitch about survivor perks.. like fuck off... 
---
As a survivor main... all I get is proxy camping/tunneling killers.. yall have awesome perks and still play like dbags.. I'm over the whining.. shut up
---
Latency is not the same as framerate. 
---
This is your computer struggling, open up task manager while you play and sort by CPU to find out what you need to close.
---
So do we know when these a dropping ?
---
lmao
---
They will become more common though because it will be far more viable than before.
---
I like the lore and idea, but visually he's pretty bland imo.
---
Often defuses then and we talk about problems with the game
---
Funny because I see the most complaints come from from pussy ass survivors like you. Even complaining about killers complaining right now. Boo fuckin hoo ü§£ü§£
---
Oof sorry
---
The only map left in the game that can still generate infinites, or so I have heard. Either way I like playing Trapper on this map.
---
I mean sure but so what its still better than people just hiding
---
I find this funny when people start smacking their controllers all around the shop, one of my friends actually managed to snap off the analog stick...
---
90% of the time it's fucking useless anyways. Either you always press E a nanosecond too late, are nowhere near a pallet to effectively use it, or it simply does nothing and exhausts you anyways.
---
Survivors are sick of the moris.. ebony mori is beyond broken imo
---
I actually unironically use this. Is that bad?
---
No! Now give me those benevolent points!
---
&gt;Its a looping perk, run an anti looping build. For example, i would deal with this with bamboozled, spirit fury, enduring, sloppy butcher. The extra hit is only going to buy them an extra 10-15 seconds if the pallets are expended/not nearby. Is that really worth an entire perk slot? Old DS would buy at least double that amount of time with the stun time.
---
If you are smart enough, you will know when MoM gets activated. Once you are protected, you can just start moving towards a safer area. 
---
Considering MoM has zero counters, you can just B-line out in the open towards an area cluttered with pallets and the killer will even give you a push while at it.
---
Guys no joke I'm having a hatch standoff rn with a p3 claudette
---
Game simply wasnt fun anymore playing as killer. Way too frustrating. I'm glad more people are realizing struggles but for me I can no longer actually play killer and enjoy myself, at best I'll play survivor.
---
At the same time it's unfortunate that due to the balance and environment of the game I almost NEVER reccomend the game to anybody as I would not consider it actually fun but more of feeding off of the high of having many bad experiences but that one good experience that feels great.
---
The devs need to stop patch working issues with perks you cant even take as killer because most of your slots are taken to counter bigger issues and there needs to be something done about survivor toxicity since they seem to be trying to curb camping through losing rank (not to say that camping is effective, if they are swarming hooks it is the only time it is.)
---
I run Adrenaline and Mettle of Man. Let's just finish the last generator, no need to heal me.
---
Dont worry about it
---
Dude, you post stuff like "I will DC If you emote one time" or "Survivor requires less skill" both your posts and comments are just a bunch of shit
---
Well that makes me feel special &lt;3
---
In Overwatch people complain that you lose SR when you disconnect from a ranked match, even if it wasn't your fault. But comparing that to DBD where there's literally no penalty, I know which I prefer.
---
Lol! I do this. Basically when someone messages me salty I'll bait them to curse. Works more than not
---
Kinda made it better lol
---
I‚Äôd love more movie killers. Imagine Pinhead with a chain he throws out that if it hooks a survivor drags them to him. Instead of hooks he has the pillar of pain that slowly rips survivors apart unless saved. His map would be the labarinth inside the lament configuration. Or Chucky and each map has piles of toys scattered around he can blend in with to ambush survivors. The Creeper from Jeepers Creepers could do his axe throw as his special and have the axe return to him if it misses a survivor. There‚Äôs a ton of fun ideas the devs could use.
---
REEEEEE
---
Red Mori is BS so I'm not surprised no one wanted to play against it.
---
Just had a game where I instantly stepped in a trap and got basement hooked, saved, stepped in a trap on the stairs, hooked in the basement again. Killer ended up staring at a wall in the basement and let me get unhooked and leave. Didn't get a kill that match because he let me go,  when I offered myself he downed me and got into a spot where when I was dropped I was forced out of the exit gate. (I didn't bm or anything, he just felt bad I think.) 
---
So trapper who played against a yellow shirt nea on the swamp map, if you see this, thank you for being a good sport about it
---
If they really want people to use that, make it considerably decrease charge time ffs
---
I had a Bill DC after walking into one of my traps as he tried to sneak to the top floor of that long roundabout on one map.
---
Buying the Leatherface DLC for Smartface = Galaxy Brain
---
Part of the game does not equal fun. When i play killer, i refuse to tunnel and camp. Its not fun for either party so why do it ? As "host" of the game as killer, its my job to do my job getting kills and make it fun. 
---
There's toxic people who'll try and ruin that but i actively try to combat it.
---
Ruin on a good billy/nurse is basically asking for DCs. Ruin at rank 18 is so overkill it's no wonder those potatoes so no hope.
---
1) Remove the whole deep wounds nonsense. Legion's attacks on wounded enemies down them properly  
---
2) Feral Frenzy takes longer to charge and can only be used fully charged. It also goes away after landing a hit. Missing a strike doesn't incur any penalties.  
---
That would turn them into a Nurse that can't go through walls. Here's where the second part comes in.  
---
3) Their speed is reduced to 105% to balance out Feral Frenzy and to make the next part easier  
---
4) In the closet spare clothing can be found. Frank can disguise himself as Dwight, Julie as Jake, Joey as Claudette and Susie can disguise herself as Meg. If either of those characters is present in the trial, they also wear their cosmetics. While disguised they can pretend to work in generators, while actually significantly reducing the fixing speed. The Legion can't attack with M1 while disguised, but can still use Feral Frenzy, immediately losing the disguise.  
---
And, as an icing on the cake  
---
5) If a survivor, whose cosmetics are used by Legion, dies, they are shown as alive in UI, until someone finds the hook they died on.
---
hey op do you take criticism?
---
The game is toxic because in its origin its made to be asymetrical and competitive, but somewhere down the line some people (not the devs) said it wasnt and we then got into a balance arguement and ever since its just gone down hill...its kinda the devs fault not settling hot topic debates and its streamers fault for promoting toxic behavior and depiping, and then...making them poster childs for their fog whisper program...the truth is we as a community actually enjoy toxic behavior and playstyles i know people will say i dont. But when notably toxic streamers have like 3K viewers i dont know what you mean or when people post negative comments here and get mad and downvote. Like OP i agree this game is super toxic i tell my friends dont play it, its insanely toxic.
---
Pebble OP confirmed
---
I get what your coming from but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea too many people who dodge
---
\&gt;devs see toxic survivors staying after gates are open
---
Devs: ***endgame:collapse time***
---
survivors: ^(noooo)
---
Getting like 9+ hooks
---
So quick questions though. 1) which killers are good and 2) what if you're simply not good at playing said killers? (I'm thinking Billy, nurse, spirit)
---
Like what do you do if you happen to like a mid tier killer best and just do much worse with a high tier killer due to either lack of practice or simply not knowing how to play said character?
---
I don't know if they can right now. I get kicked out of so many matches it's ridiculous.  It will show me that the killer dc'd. I will see all their perks get my points and everything. Sometimes it is obvious that the game kicked me out because I will be in chase or the killer is winning the match. 
---
They really need to fix this issue. I would hate to get punished for something I didn't do.
---
Omg what!!! Thank god he did not grab Detective along hahahahaha
---
Instead of a cool down, I think up to a certain range might be a bit more viable
---
Oh lol
---
Had this happen to me the other day. All of the gens were done, I killed the last person and saw the last person urbaning to the hatch. Walked over to it and just stood in front of it, put down my controller, and browsed the internet. This Nea legit spent about 10 minutes teabagging, walking around me, and sabotaging the hook right next to me before finally opening the door that was about 5 feet away. Even ***then***, she still waited another couple of minutes before finally leaving.
---
The survivor in me is gonna hate end game, but the killer in me in so damn excited.
---
A+
---
Just move it in a circular motion. It's a controller saver.
---
I made this post just for you, old timer~
---
That would be cool, but would that also mean killer could talk to the survivors?
---
Oh looküëÄ I found another person offended by the almighty crouch button.. lmaooooo I cant take you seriously.. spamming the crouch button doesnt effect the game in any sort of way. Chase them down hook them find another person. Why so Serious?
---
The hard school man. Keep playing and watch a lot of videos on youtube, guides but also gameplay (true talent). Try to learn from everyone arround and always keep trying. Also, always pick your favorite killers, but Ive to be honest...its not the same maining wraith than maining hillbilly... Just saying
---
Man, basically, just practice. It sucks for a while, but as long as you keep trying you'll get better.
---
Didn‚Äôt actually know they didn‚Äôt leave bodies if it was the game. Thnx for letting me know.
---
I like the crow one. It's like alert but for the crows!! I dig it.
---
Just do you and dont listen to what they say. If the exit gates are open and you have someone on the hook, you wont just leave the hook and risk them getting away. And if they say something like "You suck" or something else like that, just dont listen to them.

---
Ds? You think Ds as it is right now is unfun to play against?
---
I use it as a BP farming perk. Deliverance,DS,Prove Thyself and WGLF.
---
Save someone without getting caught,make sure the unhooked person is safe so you get deliverance active(take a hit near hook to get WGLF stacks if needed),when you get hooked unhook yourself immediately and let the killer down you and stab him with DS,then make sure to lose him or get hooked for a second time.
---
If you get second hook,make sure to not getting found ever again.In the meantime spot some teammates and do gens with them to get 2x BP from Prove Thyself.Get unhooks if the hook is nearby.That way I get 30+k BP every game as survivor,as well as wasting killer's time with deliverance and ds.

It would be nicer if the perk colour reflected its tier. It would also make searching for perks easier when you have all of them at tier 3.

Freddy's the untrackable tracker. He has aura-reading himself. Aura-reading perks still work against Freddy, but you have to be asleep to use them. He makes survivor-side aura-reading perks dangerous to use.
---
That‚Äôs hilarious. Someone needs to edit this with Billie Jean playing in the background and then when the hatchet hits the records scratches.
---
that type of survivor is also the kind that always dc's as soon as the killer gets them. =-=
---
It's a bit ridiculous imo
---
i feel like his power is a teeny tiny bit too nerfed, i think if they buffed it in some little way and also in a good way that doesn't make them OP then Legion would be perfect
---
First of all, dont worry about being bad at certain killers. If you play and play with them, you will become really good with any of them, its not hard. Youtube is full of guides. The most important part is to get the full game knoleage apart from the killer unique power. 
---
Youtube has a lot of tierlist videos on killers and perks. Try to see a lot of them, and also asking the reddit, because one particular person could missunderstand certain killer. For example, there are people saying that hag is bad. Well, actually hag is one of the most OP killers in the game. Just try all the killers, take your time, and get some favourites. You can play any of them, but if you wanna be competitive, maybe you may choose mayers above doctor, or plague above trapper.
---
Huntress doesn't have autoaim for her power tho
---
Downvote me all you want, but unpopular opinion:
---
This meme is overused and boring as hell. The ‚ÄúHar har shirtless Myers‚Äù circlejerk is on almost every thread nowadays and it‚Äôs annoying as fuck.
---
Lol poor killers, they deal with so toxicity, they cant spend one minute without playing fucking victim, keep crying because pallets are op so the devs remove them pls
---
Also if you look at the [second disconnect clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/ToughThoughtfulChowderCurseLit). You can listen to Tofu saying how many counter plays BBQ has and auras not showing. Behind generator,  hid in the locker, distortion and being closer than the range.
---
Maybe to lower-ranked players, yeah.
---
No way
---
Most survivors have no idea how the map can be abused. But oh boy, once you find one of those, you'll understand what i am talking about.
---
Firstly, sometimes the fences spawn some completely safe vaults. Almost every garage has a safe pallet, strode house with the basement window open can hold a killer for minutes.
---
 Some houses have multiple safe vaults upstairs, which creates legit infinites if the survivor has balanced landing.
---
There is also the "house of pain": the house that spawns with a gen down stairs and has two safe pallets. Can hold the killer 2 minutes with balanced landing or good vault rng.
---
This all coupled with the fences making it almost guaranteed to get to these locations, makes the map so survivor sided
---
Freddy is the worst killer by far and your whining about a perk that shouldn‚Äôt even be ran sucks against him.
---
It was great until you pointed out the right eye thing, now its all I see lol. You could probably get a sharpie and and do a little something if you wanted.
---
Honestly, if they depipped a whole level, that would make up for DCs. Maybe once dedicated servers arrive we can differentiate between dropped connections and actually selecting to DC. Also, more points for DCs
---
Good way to get mori'd yourself, but if you can get away with it more power to you =)
---
not with their rework LOL
---
BBQ is easy to counter and Freddy is very weak.
---
Can they stop releasing Claudette and Meg cosmetics, please ?
---
Ngl, I‚Äôll probably mori Hawaiian
---
Meg kneels before the overwhelming power of Claudette's battle stance.
---
Legion
---
I don't want bbq to change, it's not about being able to dodge it. I just kinda want consistency. If dark sense only works when you're in dream state against Freddy then bbq should work against survivors in dream state only.
---
This reminds me of a game I started as huntress in autohaven wreckers. Just for shits and giggles I threw a random hatchet across he map and hit someone. After that I never hit another person all game cause I was wheezing from laughter
---
I can kinda get where they're coming from, ive been playing survivor for the past two days so i can get my platinum trophy, and I've had about 2-5 games where ive enjoyed my self. My other matches have consisted of being camped, tunnled, farmed and a multitude of bugs, all of which would make me salty in time
---
freddy isn‚Äôt cloaked.
---
So far we've had the usual cycle of chapter release, with tons of cosmetics sprinkled in every week until the mid chapter, then the same thing until the next chapter. For this chapter we've had so little cosmetics. There were plague/jane cosmetics, then 2 weeks later we had Ash cosmetics, then another 2 weeks later we finally get billy and ace.
---
he's not that bad. just eat your death LIKE A MAN
---
Yep. I mainly play as killer now since I cannot handle the 3v1 dc 2v1 games. I just want to get my BBQ stacks and some fun chases. That is all! But with the current disconnect rate.. it is not happening either. People disconnect after first down, first getting found, first step in a bear trap etc. 
---
Also Twitch DBD challenges was such a fun thing they added to the game, but I cannot really enjoy and try to do my best with the disconnects ruining the matches.
---
Nicolas Cage is in National Treasure.
---
Not really, i can see the springs getting really worn with time
---
I agree with every point except your first one, as since there are several movies and each one has a different looking Jason, there could be a lot of cool cosmetics.
---
Still made you look though lol
---
Farming is not bannable..
---
Maybe for an extended ptb period.
---
DEVS I WAS FINE WITH DS, I WAS FINE WITH MOM, I WAS FINE WITH LEGION, I WAS FINE WITH ALL THE SHIT YOU GAVE ME(still really love this game), BUT NOW YOU HAVE GONE TO FUCKING FAR!
---
Legion's power is unbalanced. 
---
While Feral Frenzy can usually be more boring than OP for Survivors to face, there are no few add-ons and strategies/exploits that make Legion absolutely unstoppable.
---
Things like Moonwalking (with or without Bloodhound), Frank's Mixtape, or Cold Dirt +Joey's Mixtape can be used to give Legion an easy down and deny the Survivor a chance to Survive.
---
Or they recognize that the killer is coming back and if you keep forcing them to sprint to break off healing you guarantee that they are going to be found. Fuck the fuck off.
---
Sorry, this isn't the Wednesday thread?
---
Survivors already fuck each other over enough, we don't need perks for it too.
---
You can spin and keybind
---
I came to the sub for Dead By Daylight. If y‚Äôall want to start a Myers circlejerk sub, go at it. But this isn‚Äôt r/shirtlessmyers - this is r/deadbydaylight ‚Äì for dead by daylight. Which doesn‚Äôt have shirtless Myers in it. The joke is old and stale.
---
But the cloak was their idea of invisibility at that time, my thoughts is they didn't wanna do a fully invisible killer that early in game. They've found a way to have an "invisible" killer now with Freddy. I'd be fine with it not working against a cloaked wraith, because it defeats the purpose of his cloak- it would be consistent with how it works with other "invisible" characters.
---
Wheres the piggy?!
---
because freddy is in another world than survivors and wraith
---
EDIT: Just got my first reddit medal here on this reddit! Thanks guys!
---
Yeah honestly I want punishments for dcing, but I don‚Äôt think they can even begin that until the dedicated servers are up.
---
Yeah, I'm rank 8 atm and have been up against a couple rank 20 killers recently because I've been teaching a new player, who was also rank 20, how to play the game.
---
I just don't wiggle unless they're trying to get me in the basement. It's rare that there won't be a hook close enough.
---
That's the point though. I main a survivor and I hate some perks and add ons but that's why I play survivor it's a fun challenge unless killer is being a total dick just have fun
---
Any survivor group with 4 of the same good perk is really strong... MOM isn‚Äôt any diff then 4 adrenaline, hope, borrowed time, dead hard, or unbreakable
---
...Do you not know who Freddy Krueger is lmao
---
Honestly I'm tired of Billy cosmetic
---
I met a duo like that once, didn't DC, did 5 gens(the other 2 left), opend the gate and escaped, the killer killed his sandbagging buddy because he needed the points, they were fighting in the end chat. BEST FEELING EVER
---

‚ÄúShe knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.‚Äù
---
The survivor part is completely made up, was trying to make these two faces as similar as possible
---
I basically just read "this perk works against every killer I versus But because it dont work against this one killer particular they should change this one killer perk to only affect said killer and the rest gets full benefits."
---
Nigga what?
---
Yeah. That's the only reason I bout the currently garbo killer. I figured eventually they'd rework him (thank god) and he'd be more useful. That doesn't exactly change the fact that the perk doesn't run normally against him.
---
In A Near Future: "I'd like to Report that this Killer was playing Wraith without his Bell. I hope you ban them very soon. Ty."
---
Wraith is not strong. He's mid tier at best. The strong killers are the ones who have abilities that help in chases or when crossing the map quickly.
---
I find it really sad that the good killers counter MoM and most mid to bad killers can barely do anything if at all.
---
Pill bottle op
---
Yeah, let‚Äôs just take out their ability to escape all together, then we can have our fun with them *evil stare*
---
1. We‚Äôve got an upcoming *‚Äùrework‚Äù* (heavy nerf) that is gonna make legion incredibly weak. Most of the changes that are being implemented would be fine individually but all together are gonna make them very difficult to effectively use 
---
2.  Biggest reason, exploits/bugs making it essentially impossible to win against legion. Quote: *‚Äúno counterplay.‚Äù* End quote.
---
The Wraith isn't fully invisible even when he's cloaked unless he's standing still. Freddy is fully invisible. Like I said, Freddy's the untrackable tracker. Besides, it'd be broken as hell to be able to track him when you're in the state that he can't even hurt you in.
---
Then why did I get the reddit award for this post lol

Played doc. DC as soon as the game started. Not related to doc I don‚Äôt think. Second guy spun around me so I zapped and downed them, DC. Then another guy said ‚Äúshit‚Äù and DC‚Äôd. Farmers with the last guy. 6/10

Wraith can't hurt you when he's cloaked though. I'm not trying to argue like a bitch but it's just been on my mind, like you see what I'm getting at? I'm not genuinely angry or anything, just confused af over it
---
You clearly don't know how to play Freddy, friend.

I'm confused and expressing that, and definitely not over nothing brother oh yeah

Don‚Äôt DC. Just play kinda bad but get points

Co ty pierdolisz ?

Are you stupid bbq didn‚Äôt get buff you can hide behind a gen,go in another direction, hide in a locker, distortion, and sole survivor. They didn‚Äôt buff ruin what are you talking about? The last 3 perks you mentioned isn‚Äôt really good.

yes you are lmfao people explained how wraith and freddy are in different planes which is literally BHVR canon brother oh yeah

As a survivor I don't mind getting farmed if they have borrowed time, but if you yank me in front of a killer without it and gens are still left I am going to make sure you don't get a safe hook bonus y o u p i e c e o f f u c k i n g s h i t
---
I use it so rarely that every time I have it, I forget it completely. :(
---
Dude you're useless to talk to. That doesn't mean it should work against cloaked wraith.
---
I think you are right. I am sure we will see a lot of changes once the dedicated servers are up running smoothly. It will just take awhile.
---
On the contrary, that's exactly why.
---
The "I'm going to hide until the killer disconnects" matches are annoying and any solution is better then none.  But with the heavy handed emblem system this likely results in punishing a killer for doing well (only getting a silver for 3 kills).  And even at rank 15 it can result in a depip.
---
I dont see why they couldn't begin the collapse timer and give the survivor 3 mins to finish enough gens to escape, or better to reveal the survivor aura after 3 mins alone in the match with the killer.  The later solution would even solve new situations where a survivor camps the door so they can open it as soon as the hatch is shut and thus deny the killer a chance to guard the doors.
---
and ur being delusional brother oh yeah

---
This much is true, there are a lot of other reasons as well, killer coming back, focus on getting gens over heals, etc. Normally if a survivor runs from heals part way through, its most likely for a good reason.
---
... his cloak makes it extremely hard to see and track him. So why should dark sense work when he's cloaked, a stealth mechanic meant to make it significantly harder for survivors to see him?
---
wahh why can't the weak killers be nerfed more
---
Lol yes! That would make it even better
---
With the timer thing that would make me disconnect more so I have a long timer so I can‚Äôt rank up, it would literally have to stop you being able to queue for x amount of time
---
Yeah thats probably a good idea. I just feel like it deranks me way quicker when I DC. Like -2 every time

---
it's not inconsistent brother oh yeah not only is it in line with BHVR canon and character canon it makes sense for his power no matter how much you screech it's just like wraith even though it isn't
---
I just want to have fun. Killer is just stressful. When I play my heartbeat (ha) is really high and I‚Äôm nervous. Maybe surveillance will help
---
I stopped playing the game for ages (After I got the Halloween Doctor outfit)
---
Now I'm back I have people complimenting my skin or how I play really well. This is what I missed when I played at lower ranks.
---
This. For something that's ultra rare you can get a shit ton of hem in just a couple of bloodwebs. Sometimes you can even get 2 in a single one
---
A lot of bad behaviour doesn't really aggressively happen until the killer sets a negative precedent. Camping or failing with an overpowered kit (insta-saw, iri hatchet) immediately gets everyone to play really spiteful
---
I am a master procrastinator my friend
---
funny to me how someone that‚Äôs been playing for two years bitches about freddy. learn to play the game.
---
Now the video should be public
---
and I thought I play a lot
---
... you do realize the wraith not being detected bt dark sense whwn hes cloaked would be a buff for him, and that I'm saying it should work that way since CLOAK IS FOR STEALTH, yet you not only act like a trollish ass but accuse me of wanting weak ass killers. But ok brother oh yeah.

Edit: I want to de-rank to play with more casual players. I love the game, but It was much funner when I wasn‚Äôt goin against the teams of tryhards every match. Flickering the lights, bullying, it makes playing killer feel like your just the survivors play toy. Thats not what a killer should feel like. Ranks 12 to 1 are really bad as killer.

He was about the speed of a cloaked wraith.
---
I don't know if you were here when the game was first released but survivors would crouch behind you while you hooked someone and then unhook them as soon as you took 1 step away from the hook. The Trapper could also place traps right under a hooked survivor so other survivors couldn't disarm it and the unhooked survivor would fall right onto the trap......good times.....They weren't good times, they were very evil times.
---
The BBQ,Ruin, and Devour "buffs" were only for tier 1 and 2 of those perks which if we're being honest means nothing. Spies was buffed from a trash perk to a bad perk. I'll admit surveillance is pretty good after the rework but comparing that to the addition of MoM is laughable.
---
It‚Äôs a hard knock life for us M1 killers
---
I wouldn't disconnect. You could honestly just spend a few days afk for every match. Survivors will benefit and you'll get where you want in a more fair way. 
---
And I agree, red ranks aren't fun for me either. I'm at a comfy 12 and play for fun I stead of rank or points.

Careful, you're speaking the truth round here son you'll get shit on for saying that

As I've said in a couple of threads and on Bricky's video about it, it's too early to tell; Legion's power is definitely nerfed, but the Add-ons could make for some great gameplay if they are done correctly.
---
With the lower move speed bonus but higher duration, Iridescent Button, Sloppy Butcher, and Coulrophobia put the Survivors down to 30% heal speed as long as you have your power up. Map Wide. That's absolutely ridiculous, as it forces the Survivors to basically not be able to heal without wasting a huge amount of time, forcing them to run No Mither without the ability to pick themselves up as a fifth perk.
---
Add to that, Hex: Ruin or Hex: Huntress' Lullaby and Unnerving Presence with Iridescent Button means skill checks are a pain map wide as well. Healing, repairing, saboing.... increased chance of skill checks, no warning when they come, and they're 60% smaller. That will be brutal.
---
I dunno, I'm actually kind of excited for where they are taking the Legion, even if I know they still aren't going to be "good" when the rework hits.
---
As most people have explained the creator of Ctrl Alt Dlt was being criticized for not making anything serious so when he made a comic about a *fucking miscariage* the fact that it came so far out of left field just made the whole thing a massive joke.
---
The creator has embrased it as a joke but he made the comic largely because he was salty and couldn't take criticism.

I have never in the history of the word rescue heard it apply to any scenario where at least one other party didn't "rescue" the other.  I think you're overthinking this and finding fault in a description that seems accurate.  You won't get stacks for kobes.

imagine being such a baby killer you have to depend on dark sense to enjoy the game

I swear, those myers who get to tier 1 on someone and don't realize they can't get to tier 3 on that person are just weird.

Also. The addons DID extend the flashlight. Quite tragic.

I used to despise the map and I still am not its biggest fan that being said both the main boat as well as the docks are very very strong for looping.  It's the rest of the map that's designed for immersed plebs.

I always feel bad whenever there is a DC and i really wish it would be fair but i seriously hate farming for 15 minutes even though it would be "The nice thing to do" and would much rather just finish it quick and queue up again. Doesn't mean i'm tryharding.
---
Your forgot Jane.

*She would host a talk show with all the killers*

Okay
---
lmao you literally pulled that from my profile
---
There is no issue with the killer closing the hatch. I agree whoever finds it first should win. Unless there are 2 immediate dcs and the first person hooked suicides with 0 gens done. Survivors depends on each other to win. When this circumstance happens, which is often it's unfair. The killer gets his bps for the quiter bonus and the 1 survivor is left with a depip.
---
... it's a survivor perk. I play a stealth survivor build. Imagine being so butthurt over an opinion that a perk should be fixed in favor of more killers that you attempt to insult someone online for it.
---
Idk man, played nearly 500 hours of DBD at all ranks and watch tons of DBD streams. I played killer 90% of the time till the healing/ vault nerf to survivors happened, then switched to that since killer started becoming boringly easy. Once you know how to deal with shack and T+L walls and not mindgame yourself, cocky survivors seem to disappear from the face of the earth.
---
Killers always set the precedent for how salty a match is going to be first, unless a survivor puts in a haddonfield offering with balanced landing equipped. Everyone in the community past rank 15 kinda knows this.
---
If anyone is going to start the game of immediately hiding waiting for hatch then these people will never surpass rank 20 and also won't get any points. Plus these people woulnd't just suddenly pop up after the endgame release, If they exists then they exist now and would just wait until 2 gens are done and THEN hide until everyone dies.
---
I‚Äôve only done it if it‚Äôs quite obvious that the killer is tunneling me, or if they‚Äôre consistently camping. It just ruins the game for everyone
---
Yeah if the killer didn't play like filth in game just leave.  Unwarranted bm isn't cool.  Save it for those that deserve it.
---
Or your character gets the spasms. Deadhard is so shit you get punished for reaction.
---
user base here hates survivor salt posts
---
*survivor gets a decent perk for once that actually does have some counterplay*
---
"This perk is so op there's no counterplay"
---
How many times does this need to happen for people like you to not complain?
---
The incentive not to leave is bloodpoints. You don‚Äôt require any further incentive. If you get caught just play it through. Being salty and DCing just makes the game worse for literally everyone playing. Killer and survivors.

no

Exciting.  Maybe Ash is the start of our older licensed characters getting a bit more attention.

These have been in the game since Leatherface came out. They're the original 4 survivors faces and you get them by sacrificing the 4 original survivors 25 times.

hate to tell y'all but it honestly looks like [crap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LusX_1PUm0) tbh :/ relevant outfit at 2:05.

those are not the original survivor skins?

So, is this console only?

Because I have these masks on my PS4

But when I looked on my pic, they aren‚Äôt there

For this reason alone i feel safer injured a lot of the time. Including MoM? mate...

Screenshot is from PC
---
As somebody whose favorite killer is Trapper, I never expect to win. You probably made them very happy just by falling for their trap placements. That trap firing noise is the most satisfying noise in the game.
---
Alrighty, thanks :)
---
I wouldn't call it a buff myself, but the movespeed does make a big difference. He won't really be able to tunnel any better than someone like Trapper though, so, meh.

Why don‚Äôt I have the masks on pc then? That‚Äôs wild lol

XD it was right at the beginning of the match, no one had even been in chase yet. It was beautiful. I hope I made them happy though
---
Apparently it's salty baby QQ, or obviously a bhvr shill.
---
How many videos did ya dig through for this, OP?
---
Hmm I disagree.  I like it!  I dig Meg‚Äôs outfit too.  And though I don‚Äôt play Trapper ever, it‚Äôs cool to see him getting an outfit inspired by My Bloody Valentine.

Ok so I've been practicing, but when running in reverse like you said holding s then pressing d w a, why do I have to move my mouse right when pressing d i thought you had to move the mouse the opposite way? .... it's if i flick my mouse left when doing sdwa it just stops

Well hell yeah dude. Keep going. I was just letting you know cuz I made a new account for a fresh start and didn't expect my stuff to transfer

Bloodpoints (especially in a bad match where you barely get any) arent enough. Most players have perks they want.

Imagine complaining about S H A R P H A N D J O E unironically.

Lol i am thank you. How'd you know?

The trapple and detention icons have been in the game since the Nurse was released. Probably a killer that got scrapped.

in what way would patch notes explain their subjective experience with camping and tunneling killers??

Don‚Äôt worry, you will 100% get better. They were a group of 3 or 4 it looks like. The higher ranked players play with lower ranks so the killers will be easier to bully.

Don‚Äôt give up so soon! It happens to everyone when they first start, so don‚Äôt worry!
---
If theres 2 gens left and the killer is camping the hatch I go do gens I do 1 and go see if the killer moved from the hatch if he doesnt i go do the last one and then go back toward the hatch because then the killer starts to panick like oh fuck now there opening an exit gate, if the killer hasn't moved from the hatch I then open exits doors.. some killers are so dumb and hell bent on not letting survivors have hatch. Oh well I just made mad points doing gens and opening both exit doors lmao..
---
Wraith is easy as piss to track when he's cloaked if you have eyes.

Freddy's on an entirely different other plane of existence, lore-wise, and for the third time, he's not meant to be able to be tracked when you're awake.

Boil over doesn‚Äôt actually do much imo. Given that they were required to bring Sabo, those were the ones I‚Äôd pick. However, no sabo required, last perk would be tenacity
---
Lullaby, then.
---
Honestly, I don't think people staying hurt will be a good idea against Legion post-change. They're a regular M1 Killer, so looping them is going to be that much more difficult, and you could argue for SF + Enduring on Legion now.
---
As for Mending, I think we'll end up seeing Mending being a bit of a time waster but nothing too serious  will be done to it. If they made it a healing action, we'd have a more reasonable but still extremely annoying situation where Legion smacks you then runs off forcing you to mend yourself for an eternity. Healing is an action that you *can* take whenever you want. Mending is something you *have* to do when it's relevant.
---
1. [look at this flair](http://prntscr.com/ney6i8)

2. As I said, the patch is still not out and nothing stops people from playing as legion
---
I love how this implies there wasn't even a fourth person in the game like usual
---
I think we're done here, dude. You don't seem to give much of a shit about what I'm actually saying and that's obvious. I try making points pretty much about how a perk should be reworked *in a handful of killers favor* and that's ignored because I mentioned Freddy. There's no productive conversation and I'm fine leaving it that way with you tbh.
---
We do not stan FamilyDick
---
Wow those are shit perks that you just put there
---
My advice is play a killer you suck at in evey match if your goal is to depip..  at least you're still playing and not wasting everyone's time and maybe you'll then get better at that said killer. Dcing is annoying and waste of everyone's offerings.
---
Even though the patches aren't out it still means they are coming
---
Lol. Slow it down, friend. Just because I give you a chance to kill me and get more for yourself while trying to get more for myself doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm an asshole. Not like I teabag on the way, or something like that. End of the day it‚Äôs a game and I‚Äôm terrible at it overall, so if I can get some extra points by doing something unnecessary, then I sure will. You get a whole other chance to kill me and make me regret it.
---
MoM only triggers when injured... so it blocks chainsaw and all when injured but not when in the healthy state
---
You use Mettle of Man by taking a hit and losing the killer, getting healed, and continuing the objective until the next encounter or taking hits for a survivor the killer is carrying.
---
It rewards good play more than it does ever intentionally losing a chase. I don't think you can equate it to NOED for these reasons...
---
poor Tofu :( i always feel sorry for him when people play rudely, he's the nicest dude ever.
---
Yes. It is, imo, the worst thing to have ever happened to the game's health. 
---
My killer games have been insane
---
* plague game where a person I never even saw disconnected once they first saw me and one where someone disconnected on their second hook
---
* pig game where someone disconnected the second I saw them at the start of the game and someone who disconnected on their first hook
---
* Trapper game where the first person knocked down disconnected 
---
The plague game in particular was crazy because I was probably going to get donked on due to some big mistakes I made.
---
And I don't buy that it's because of the ranking changes because the devs eased survivor ranking and being hooked in my games isn't that big of a deal because I don't tunnel and don't even use Ruin so you don't have to worry about potatoes not doing gens
---
Haha that's funny
---
blessed by the entity
---
Ikr. Same with many other great streamers.
---
Would suck that as soon as he hooked u his bloodwarden went up and just breaks you're hopes and dreams lol.
---
I get that whenever I do the same. Tryhard camping Freddy. I hooked someone and they try to unhook immediately. I just leave as soon as the game ends now.
---
I dc if it‚Äôs a killer i can‚Äôt stand, like clown
---
Sunday is a day of rest, but not for the hook destroyers!!!

I think it blocks most things if you're going from injured to down

Wow, imagine camping someone with a trap on their head.This why I hate people who play as the pig they're beyond stupid.
---
God, this game is cancer
---
It's always the same cycle when something gets nerfed in any game, people flail around at first thinking it will literally be unplayable then it happens and people adapt to find a new way of playing.
---
Hmm who are you playing and what's your addons and perks? Play style? Theres gotta be a reason you're getting these type of messages constantly... I need more info to make a clear judgement
---
Or because South Park is OP
---
And Solo has ways to do so, by using certain perks. theres far too strong of set ups that can be done with perk communication. We don't need solo players seeing the team of people running adreniline and going, "I should put that on too"
---
Better eat the booty like grocerys.
---
You really, unironically think that this is a survivor sided update?
---
Your lack of playing one of the roles in this game has given you a broken perspective. You're so blinded by wanting the game to be easier that you've convinced yourself that updates that make it easier don't make it easier enough, and are survivor sided.
---
Thanks I learned some stuff from the guide.
---
So camping but with extra steps
---
That's one of my triggers... I hate it
---
I have only meet these people playing as the pig and I don't use add-ons regularly.
---
Uhhh if they mori'd you right after the unhook then it's your teammates damn fault for taking you off when the killer is right there.
---
Ace mains rise up against adams!!!
---
I love everything I'm seeing right now.

My hot take on these changes is that they're going to be a worse wraith since Mending is easily the least effective Stall mechanic in the game.  The first-hit mechanic is also among the worst in the game, because while Freddy, Wraith, and Pig can disengage and get a second sneak attack, Legion is just sorta stuck being M1 McGee.  I truthfully feel like nu-Legion is going to live and die by how good their addons are.  If they're Doc or Freddy levels of good, they'll be in a good place.  If they're not?  Ehhhh...
---
Considering you're the guy who sort of opened the door I was banging on to become a Freddy main though, I suppose I could afford to have a little more faith, ~~until the Freddy "rework" that I'll bet is actually going to be a nerf.~~
---
They should implement a "bad sportsmanship" lobby for these players like they do in GTA V
---
This entire post is wrong. They added pallets and did nothing with hit boxes lmfao wow

Looking for hatch gives me so much anxiety
---
Let's not forget them t-bagging you while you're being moried
---
I don't think you give much of a shit about what I'm actually saying and that's obvious, as well. I'm tired of repeating myself. I don't care if you stay ignorant.
---
Why not?
---
No. They're trying to make Claudettes stop wearing P3 shit every game.
---
You need to consider any game must suit all type of skills for players be it a good/decent/ bad to increase the potential number of players playing a game. 
---
If it's ultra hard players will quit, if it's easy it would be boring.
---
it's all over, Myers. I am become Big Meg.
---
Right
---
Did you let them go?
---
Trapper and Hag this map is absolutely devastating. Unfair really.
---
Any other killer outside of just basically really strong killers? AND the survivors all brought balanced landing? oof
---
Ladies and gentlemen, why Freddy is bottom tier.
---
Oh my god I ran into these exact guys - or at least people with a similar gimmick
---
All they did was hide in lockers. I made a game out of rounding them up and 'boxing' them by corralling their bodies up on one of those combine machines in Coldwind. I killed Pineapple (because fuck Pineapple) and the rest held a minute long crouch funeral around him before I let the rest go. Best match I ever had

That's it. Have a great day calling people idiots and attempting to degrade them for, again, opinions. You only really hurt yourself being like that.
---
It's very reliable I watched it happen for 2 hours yesterday. You cant change my mind.  Bbq Carrys killers. I know I play killer and I'm shit without it.
---
Tbh it only pisses me off if the other survivor has done nothing all game and I've had to save them from the hook multiple times only for them to leave me for dead first hook. At that point it just feels cheap and unfair that a survivor that did fuckall that game gets to survive and get hatch while you're left to rot. I've had a lot of games where that happens to me, and honestly I otherwise don't mind giving hatch. But if you've been sitting in a corner doing all of nothing all game, not even attempting objectives, that's when I get bitter.
---
I'd argue that Wraith is still better, because Wraith can disengage and try to catch them again.  If Legion does the same thing they get nothing.
---
Their war of attrition is also going to be quite bad since Mending is a laughable stall, and they honestly don't look like they have a lot going for them.  Their chase looks like it'll be pretty mediocre after the first hit, their stall, as mentioned, is laughable, and their mobility will still probably be worse than Spirit or Billy.
---
Whether or not they have good addons will be the deciding factor on if this killer is playable, or a meme.
---
Lol well I'll upvote you because I can take a joke. 
---
I try not to let tbagging bother me anymore. I mean these survivors just want to escape and you are trying to kill them. After playing Friday where Jason gets actually hit then tbagged a few times a game and actually gets murdered by Tommy in a cutscene where everybody tbags you.... people doing a tbag motion on nothing before running away scared seems pretty powerless. And sometimes they mess up and you catch them which is the best feeling ever. 
---
Only time I guess it bothers me is when all four people survive because I was playing fairly nice and they still had to stop to rub it in. It's like I guess I'll put NOED back on....
---
He's a mod so...
---
Yeah, i had a really quick game once like that. Used a BPS, match starts, killer spotted me within the first 20 seconds, i got downed and hooked, unhooked before killer go move away, downed and mori'd in like under 2-3 minutes. GG
---
I‚Äôm addicted to what people depict Rin as before death. Gimme more pretty human Rin uwu
---
If someone is running away from you and not getting healed then use your brain and think 'huh maybe they don't want healing'
---
Also SHOULD NOT forget other regular DBD players. Fun fair killers and survivors you and I used to face everyday are quitting the game due to its current community :/
---
Because the chances of wiggling free are slim to none unless someone is sabotaging or multiple people bodyblocking.
---
Why am I getting downvoted lol, you can easily juke me on my way down
---
Because once you've been hooked they tunnel you off the hook and mori you.. its ridiculous and super un fun to go against. I used it once and thought it was dumb af.
---
I didn‚Äôt notice the pallets added tbh. About 2 years ago they had double pallets and windows open. Now removed the double pallets and blocked off most Windows. That‚Äôs I meant.
---
I didn‚Äôt really read the update. Sorry if my post was incorrect, I just think playing killer is easier than it was before.
---
üê∞üê∞SUMMON THE BUNNYüê∞üê∞
---
Yeah I would recommend not playing too much so that you can get a refund and maybe rebuy it when the devs fix their goddamn game.
---
The first hit is not easy with Wraith especially against survivors with sprint burst. With Legion, they're following constantly and with a 115% movement speed, they're catching up faster than ever.
---
Wraith dishes no screen hampering effects so again, nothing like Wraith.
---
Um hello I know the counters but hiding behind a gen doesnt always work and there isnt always a locker nearby. It's just a pain in the ass to go against when the killer can get across the map in a couple if seconds.. you only get 3 distortion tokens
---
Go get it boy
---
You say this but then complain when the only fun thing to do is to DC smh
---
Tenacity would be pretty shit on that build, and boil over is specifically to stick with the theme of affecting hooks.
---
I like to think Laurie and Rin would be friends before their lives were ruined
---
I understand your frustration, but hear me out. If one of the only two remaining survivors is on hook and I KNOW the killer is patrolling them, im not going for the save. It would just be swapping places on hook or both die if I get slugged. However if both are alive Im doing gens
---
Do you camp the hook survivor or go after the person with the trap on their heads ?
---
I see you're a man of culture as well
---
This is not Groovy
---
Looking forward to it!!
---
Happens far too often. I just use the report button for balance.
---
*DC noise*
---
The fact that yall cry about every perk the survivor gets is laughable. So you gotta hit them an extra time oh well. Hate to say it but get good and continue the chase.
---
Add in game voice chat.

 The fact that ruin effects everyone at all tiers is a buff.

---
Oof poor legion main, are u gonna consider playing him after the nerd?
---
Well then more people dcing because f Billy.
---
Nobody:
---
OP:
---
It‚Äôs meant to be a trial where people die, but not for me
---
If the door is open, and other survivors are dead/out, why do you care how they escape? They‚Äôre clearly going to get out no matter what, so why do you feel like denying the survivor a few extra points just so they can‚Äôt get hatch? There‚Äôs no point in preventing hatch. It‚Äôs equivilant to the last survivor DCing after you down them preventing your 4th BBQ stack. They‚Äôve clearly already lost, but they‚Äôre denying you extra points
---
Gay icon Rebecca Moore
---
That's been in the files since before the nurse was released.
---
I was always planning on it. put the points and money into him. Why wouldn't I? Also, I'm not a "poor legion main" I think the nerfs are good and will make you salty ass survivor mains happy for once. Until you find another killer broken a week later.
---
Sometimes as much as you want to catch that little shit with the flashlight and facecamp him it's not worth it. A lot of times it's exactly what the guy wants. Go pick on somebody else and get him when he comes for the save. You know he will and he probably won't do very many generators in the meantime either. I'll only face camp if somebody is so worthless and toxic I feel sorry for their teammates and want to throw the game. Although usually it backfires and they all die rushing the hook to die with their toxic buddy instead of doing the gens becauase I'm "the bad guy". 
---
I don't understand it when a whole group tries to troll the killer or even killer trolls in general. When I got three people being really annoying I still usually get them all because nobody is rushing the gens they are just playing with me. And that guy who doesn't want to do gens but be a hero can be completely worthless. Like as a survivor I love to be the distraction but only after making the killer find me. In the meantime I'm sneaking generators.
---
The reason DC's became popular is that there is little to no punishment for DC'ing during a game despite there being rules against doing it. 
---
Most people wouldn't DC in case they did get banned for doing it thus they do not want to risk DC'ing during a match. Popular content creators have just highlighted the fact that if you leave during a match, there is very little punishment for it. 
---
As a result, people no longer have the fear of leaving the game because from their perspective, if popular content creators can DC with no punishment despite having so many people watching them, why should the player feel threatened to not DC. Even more so when Fog whispers DC during a match. The people that are supposed to represent the community of DBD breaking a rule with no consequence.
---
The whole Legion thing made the issue worse when it became a meme to just DC against Legion. When you make a joke about something then since people are laughing &amp; agreeing with it, players feel that it's acceptable to do so as it appears everyone else is doing it.
---
Legion just made the whole DC thing worse though mainly because of how unfun he is to play against. This kind of bred a mindset though for survivors that if they are not having fun in a match then DC'ing is the best solution.
---
Oh good one... it's very fitting for me.. I'm sassy and I'm a girl.. so? I mean try harder next time with your comeback. That was weak af.
---
ive always wondered what killers looked like before they were taken from the entity, thanks for this
---
I didn‚Äôt mean it in a toxic way I meant like ‚Äúaw your main is getting nerfed‚Äù
---
Oh really? I didn‚Äôt even know about that sorry. What I meant is the double pallets and all the open windows in some maps. I know I didn‚Äôt mention that in the post. My bad.
---
SURVIVORS! PREPARE FOR GLORY!
---
Well if people come up to body block for you they took a hit for no reason because you're to dense to wiggle. Always wiggle you never know what could happen.
---
Dc's in loading screen is probably not intended. Before I moved DBD install folder to SSD, I frequently get infinite loading screen and have to close the game, which counts as a DC. Now that I moved it to an SSD, I rarely get it, but I still get 3 survivor matches which means people are still getting it.
---
Still is a "haha ur bad ur killer bad now haha"
---
It takes two to tango
---
Not too bad an idea
---
I mean, if you're pretty new at the game and don't even have all 4 perk slots unlocked on all killers, yeah you'll run into survivors who have way more map and tile knowledge than you, and then throw in some flair to taunt you with as they get cocky.
---
Like there isn't much survivors can reasonably bully killers with except humping certain buildings or picking haddonfield with balanced landing. Like any bully scenario can be dealt with by just being a better killer.
---
Survivors can set the tone of the match by failing quicker. Hook farming, playing super immersed, not saving teammates/ sandbagging their own teammates, DC'ing at inopportune times... I honestly think survivors generally "bully" other survivors, intentionally or not, more often than any killer does.
---
On the other hand, killers DEFINITELY have way more influence. Unfair add-ons, playing incredibly boring (for example trapping the ever living shit around a hooked survivor while camping as Hag), camping or tunnelling... Killers can often play more inefficiently and make the game more boring for everyone involved. Not letting survivors get hook saves bones everyone in the lobby from points *and* any form of fun interaction. "I'm gonna camp this dude now" is often just the killer admitting to being out of their wits vs a certain team, and from what I've experienced there's *never* an instance where the killer can't just "play better" against survivors outside of haddonfield + balanced landing.
---
-----------------
---
No one gives a shit but this is my anecdote:
---
I've got to the point with nearly every killer where I just go in with a bloodpoint offering, zero add-ons, bbq + whispers + enduring for most of my base kit, and can 4k (or 3k + hatch escape) 90% of my matches before the 4th gen even pops. I walk straight away from hook, only slug if I know I can end the game in the next 40 seconds, give everyone 3 hooks, and never see any tea-bagging/ post game flame.
---
I definitely get the "runners" who wanna grab my attention with flashlight flicking while I'm chasing someone else, but they stop after they get a sense that I know maps myself.
---
Mind you this is all Rank 11-1 in the last few months.
---
Iv been placing bear traps around the hatch. Iv had tons of survivors run for it and get pegged by the traps and end up losing
---
I use it, and even with out the offering I get my self off the hook every 3/4 times
---
Dumb response. Teammate doesn't make a dumb move and unhook you, you don't die simple as that
---
You won right?
---
Well they have a road map and they release new content every season which is fair. But in the mean time they could fix the bugs. But I'm sure they have different teams for each thing. One for dlc content. one for cosmetics, one for game mechanics.
---
Oof that does sound toxic, I never considered legion bad, only annoying, especially with his addons (infinite mending, frank‚Äôs mixtape and Susie‚Äôs mixtape)
---
Nah, not needed.
---
Noed 2 lmao
---
Legion wasn't ruined by the devs, Legion was ruined by idiots abusing his game mechanics and bugs.  
---
I'm blaming the players for this one.
---
Oh my god youre so innocent and precious, do you play on pc, ps4, or xbox?
---
Definitely the add ons need a rework but the fact that they threaten to ban people for using don't unless blade instead of disabling one of them until they can fix it is stupid.
---
Enter the Strike Zone + Mettle of Man+ Adrenaline
---
Since I play lots of Doc I feel sorry for the pure stealth build survivors a lot of the time
---
I get what you mean
---
Hell no.
---
I thought you were gone, tf. Nice hypocrisy, complaining that I'm calling people idiots (which I'm not, btw...), when you were degrading me in your own post. I'm gonna block you now.
---
Getting hooked first when you deliverance is such a stab in the gut
---
Xbox
---
Cursed image
---
Yes
---
Please do.
---
Luck offerings are worthless, ask teammates to bring Up The Ante instead. Luck offering give you a maximum of 3% while you get 3% for each teammate alive that isn't you with the perk.
---
I don‚Äôt want to sound like a bitch because I love No0b3 but I do consider they should give him a temporary band to show people its not okay. Which sucks cause I‚Äôm sure streaming and making content is how he gets his money to survive but it made the community so much more toxic its exhausting.
---
Tbh I think this is his fault. If he knew the other one was about to die, wait til they‚Äôre dead and bam no chance for Kobe. How close were you to door?
---
That is why I bought them all. I will continue to support them as long as they continue the game.
---
Love the flair lol
---
yeah you did lol
---
I made a legacy meg dc because she tbagged me and i moonwalked the wall and swung as she vaulted the window. And she dcd
---
They say it dont be like it is but it do
---
It is probably due to all the camping and tunneling. If the match isn't fun why stay? Not saying I am doing it, that is the usual response I get when I ask post match.
---
i don't really think that tbh but Dwight was running at me while Spirit started phasing and i would've appreciate if Dwight bodyblocked for me but she downed me instead and yeah, whatever. i always thought mories are dumb tbh, i think those should be allowed after a survivor had been hooked twice, not once
---
Please dont ever say non-existing killers every again I have ptsd.
---
I play SWF so I'd know if anyone was coming to block, but whatever you're the dbd god I'll take your advice
---
What?
---
Will I accomplish my dreams and ambitions?  
---
I promise they're reasonable.
---
The killer that doesn't exist stop it I'm gonna pee my chair I'm crying and shaking right now
---
prepare to be shit on for no reason
---
uninstall bby
---
you refused to acknowledge what everyone was saying about the vast differences between wraith and freddy, canon, etc., but go ahead, keep calling us names.
---
&gt;~&gt; 
---
&lt;~&lt;
---
|Non existing killers|
---
&gt; They‚Äôre clearly going to get out no matter what, so why do you feel like denying the survivor a few extra points just so they can‚Äôt get hatch? 
---
Because they're still **looking** for the damn thing. If the other three get out and the last person no where near a door gets the hatch, fine. If I'm chasing the guy and he finds the hatch before I can get him, fine. If I've got no idea where he is, no idea where the hatch is, and they find it and get out, fine.
---
What's not fine is two people running around like idiots for three minutes because some jackass doesn't understand that 2,500 bps is a horrible return for three minutes when we both could already be in a game getting 10,000-20,000 more.
---
Get out the door. It's easier to find, we can both get on to other games, and you're holding the game hostage. You don't deserve the hatch just because it's there.
---
literally, I'll have to explain I prestiged legion, just to keep back at level 1, since I levelled him when he came out.
---
STOP IT IM CRYIGN
---
Thats the point lol
---
Well, I literally just said, SWF does it enough. SWF is not the way the game is meant to be played. Communication is not supposed to be in the game, thats the way its balanced.
---
The incentive of playing the game and getting points.
---
What do you want them to do?  Just give you the win?
---
It would be interesting to see speculation of the relationships between the survivors with one another. For example I think Dwight and Jake would be pretty good friends or Meg and Nea.
---
If I wanna play a game where I hit people and also taunt them into oblivion I play Devil May Cry, not Dead by Daylight. Don't know why the players in this game are so into just taunting eachother.
---
You called me an idiot and attacked me nonstop dude. I'm not uninstalling just because parts of the community are trash.
---
*no
---
With the upcoming Endgame Collapse he actually could win as the hatch would ne open right from the start.
---
Damn i woulda helped and played with ya
---
Alright, fair enough man. It‚Äôs a great perk, don‚Äôt get me wrong. Information is always useful, it‚Äôs just the information you don‚Äôt receive (or can‚Äôt see) that makes it unreliable. I don‚Äôt have any desire to change your mind. You are wrong though.
---
You are correct!
---
Here is the template for the perk/power symbols: https://www.kisspng.com/png-dead-by-daylight-template-michael-myers-reddit-img-5096434/preview.html
---
The font 'Roboto' is available at Dafont.com
---
And as for the white silhouettes: 
---
1. I grabbed screenshots from the necessary 'Ed, Edd n Eddy' episodes and cut out the objects I needed e.g. the Hat of Discipline, the shoe, etc. 
---
2. I made them black and white, then went into 'Levels' and increased the Black and White intensity (did not touch the Grey). 
---
2. I inverted the colours, and then set the blend mode to 'Screen' after placing the image over the perk/power symbols.
---
I hope this made sense. If not, feel free to ask and I'll make a better tutorial.
---
They're just making my job easier if anything lol
---
Because it's easier to ban people than do their jobs.

Boil over makes you affect killer movement more. That‚Äôs it. Because all the hooks should be broken in any area you come to. Tenacity benefits you by picking you up quicker with no mither and making the most use out of flip flop

I was spinning around with a chainsaw back revving, Claudette was spinning around my torso, and this went on for a few seconds.
---
I thought I lost her,  just said "Fuck it" and fully charged the chainsaw as I aimed to traverse away.
---
The auto aim spun me 180 degrees, and into her face.
---
My first experience with autoaim working well.
---
Otherwise, auto aim fucks me over 99% of the time.
---
You forget how incompetent the devs can be.
---
I don't camp but when I find a survivor I will go after them no matter what.
---
I have him, hillbilly, trapper, nurse, hag, doctor, and Myers.  Who should I play?
---
&gt;being salty you can‚Äôt win with an exploit anymore. 
---
Here‚Äôs the problem. It‚Äôs unfair. On top of the community hating this killer. There‚Äôs a lot of unfair shit in this game. But this is just, incredibly bad.
---
But it is already in the game and it‚Äôs not gonna just disappear. So you can just either ignore it or balance game around that.

---
I welcome being the main guy to piss off asshole survivors but at the same time these DCs will get frustrating very quickly.
---
Instead of banning people who might not even know they're abusing an exploit how about BHVR fix their game?
---
I'd definitely have to agree when you say Freddy isn't as bad as everyone says, when actually played to a high skill level he's fierce.
---
I'd agree with this. The devs need to stop pretending they can balance the game around a lack of information when 3rd party chat software exists. This will never stop being a problem if they don't balance the game with coms in mind.
---
Then whats the point of a mori, when you can literally just hook them and get the same result?
---
I don't mind a lot about gameplay bugs, but they could fix infinite loading and loading freeze, at least. Their lack of care is killing their golden eggs duck
---
Most of the time if i dc its because ive had a series of terrible games where the killers have been toxic or bailed out by the countless bugs of dbd.
---
Except they released a warning in the news, which pops up for every new player that gets on.
---
I love Noob3 too but I agree that DC'ing should now be punished regardless of the perpetrator. It has really ruined the balance of the game when it's becoming a 3v1 for most killer games which ruins the survivor experience &amp; fuels more negativity within the games community. 
---
The Devs should really issue a warning about cracking down on excessive DC's. Instead of banning people like noob3 they should just warn the whole community, similar to how they issued the warning about the Legion glitch &amp; have been actively monitoring players abuse of the glitch.
---
Banning people out of nowhere will result in a mass community reaction if players like Noob3 or Jendenise get temp banned from the game. 
---
Best solution is to just warn then begin to monitor DC activity. Give people some reaction time &amp; force them to now be aware of the consequence of DC'ing. 
---
If the Devs don't then this will only get worse &amp; promote more negativity &amp; friction between the killer &amp; survivor community.
---
BHVR is stupid. They could disable the add ons. But nah, they doing the ban thing.
---
I only now realised that this lad looks exactly like David King.
---
Hmm...considering how powerful the Hat of Discipline is in the 'Ed, Edd n Eddy' canon, one can only assume it is capable of breaking a pallet.
---
Survivor is so much more fun than killer. Don‚Äôt even bother
---
Bullshit happens every now and then, nothing we can do about it sorry :( I had a doctor yesterday was letting us pity farm after 2 dcs. Guess what he comes back every f‚Äôing 10 seconds and shocks us to M3 causing us to almost get no progress done at all. Then after gen 2 this guy slugs me multiple times and sacrifices me. I was so mad I dced before last hook
---
Tryhard = killer doing their job. Grow up m8.
---
Except it will. there is no reason to put someone into mend now, as Legion. Its pointless. COMPLETELY. You cannot apply ANY pressure on someone who has deep wounds on now that as long as they're in your terror radius, their bar will not go down, plus your hits don't do anything. All his power is good for now is getting a free first hit then m1ing as a 115 killer.
---
And the only hex perk they have is TotH and it ends up a waste of time that got you killed when you look post game.
---
She don't need to hear all the survivor mains bullshit
---
I feel like Dwight would be that needy friend no matter what or where.
---
I'm sure she's nice once you get to know her!
---
No that tells me exactly what I need to know, I can replicate the effect now, thanks!
---
Or balance the game around Solo, like they've been doing. And will continue to do. If you want info, use perks that give you info. If you want to know what the others are running, message them. It makes no sense to just make every match as close to SWF as possible because you want to know ahead of time that claudette will be courching around the edges of the map the whole game.
---
Cute lil 0inker lying in wait for her prey

"...and say his name". I don't know how to bring this to you, but...
---
You can't tell me what to do. You're not my dad
---
P3 Bill will always unhook you and bodyblock killer. He will always save you and is usually the Jesus of your current game because he ultimately gets sacrificed
---
I mean, realms aren't really "supposed" to have 5 maps. That's what they did at the start (and really not even then, as Macmillan only got its fifth map a year after release) but that doesn't mean they always have to do that. But I really wish they would add maps to existing locations every once in a while, and not just as part of DLC. I don't see them stopping releasing DLC anytime soon though, because they need to make money, and that's the best way to do it.
---
prestige 3. when you get to level 50 you can completely reset your characters perks and items and offerings and addons in exchange for better perks and items in the bloodweb and a bloody uniform part. p3 is the highest prestige. for survivors p1 is shirt p2 is pants and p3 is head. idk what killer is I can't remember
---
my only issue with bodyblocking is that dropping survivors if you have to is broken and often doesn't work
---
That's a really awful idea imo
---
They will be ruined in the sense that the power can be taken out of their kit essentially and they will play pretty much the same. I feel this is what plagues killers like Wraith in that he doesn't exactly need to use his power but it isn't overtly strong to entice you to use it in the first place, not as bad as Freddy who's power is essentially you need to wait 7 seconds before you can hit this survivor you found.
---
Wraith and Freddy are the ones I compare them to the most as those 2 have some of the better powers for securing the initial hit in a chase but afterwords the power doesn't do much to help them at all and it just devolves to looping/chasing until you catch the survivor as a basic M1 killer.
---
All the power is good for is hitting a survivor then leaving them alone to go and hit another with even LESS penalty to the survivor you leave as they don't have to worry about mending until you're safely away from them, and if you keep chasing them they still don't have to worry about mending since they're in your terror radius.
---
Legion actually sounds like one of the worst trackers now too, the feral frenzy removes both blood and scratches and you only activate killer instinct once you initially stab a person and it only goes off on people you haven't hit yet (i.e most likely haven't injured). Couple that with the fact that you can't down or further injure the survivor anymore at all with frenzy after the 1st hit. It at least incentivizes survivors to heal against you now but that's not exactly hard to do or out of the ordinary against most killers anyway. Feral Frenzy is also worthless as a power against injured survivors unless your goal is to hit them with it and then using the killer instinct to track another person thus just leaving that person alive.
---
Then you have the penalty of ending your frenzy when you miss an attack which I find odd. I thought one of the benefits of frenzy was having no attack cooldown which is pointless if the power ends if you miss once, and I understand punishing missing, but I feel it would've made sense to just lose like 5% of frenzy per missed attack so that after a couple missed attacks you're punished by ending your power prematurely though you still get the benefit of no attack cooldowns in tight situations.
---
Then you have the fact that you can't use frenzy until it's fully charged which won't really mean much other than that it offers even less use of travel and (coupled with the fact that it's useless now for harming injured survivors or even downing them) won't likely find use in most survivor confrontations after the first few seconds of chase i.e. like an uncloaking Wraith or while falling asleep.
---
People make it sound like oh they're 115 now, that automatically means all is right with the world which tells me people DRASTICALLY overestimate the how much of a difference that makes especially on a killer that can't capitalize on it with their power.
---
This CAN change depending on how the add-ons will change and just how much longer/slower frenzy is. But at base this is a straight up massacre of the killer(s) as a whole.
---
Honestly, I might have pretended to go for the pebble just to humor him.
---
Yeah I really wish they could make his stance a little more threatening.
---
Clearly didn't read them then.
---
ok
---
It should be fixed with one of the last patches. It will say you depip in the post game but you actually didnt.

---
Yamaoka's
---
Yeah i had that issue, i try to drop them and it wont because there isn't enough space for them to fall
---
My only issue with it is that they can crouch and just be completely outside of your line of sight and that leaves you wondering why the fuck you're not moving to where you want to be, which wastes precious time. People can just crouch behind/beside the killer and bodyblock them near a pallet, hook, etc. Survivors should be sticking up into the killer's POV at least a little bit if they try to do this.
---
They said they are working on the fix. And people can still use the addons they just cant use them together. There is nothing wrong with using one of the add ons with other add ons.
---
What do you propose then?
---
How do you have 77 auric cells?
---
This should really be a high-priority on their list of things to deal with. It‚Äôs actually fucking ridiculous how long it takes to play this game.
---
Yesterday my friend had an hour until he had to leave and we had 2 infinite loading screens and the only two games we got into were 3 player games. Fucking ridiculous.
---
I spend over half my time on this game actually trying to get into it rather than actually playing. Unreal how abnormal it‚Äôs become to have a normal game.
---
Yeah I've never seen a more obvious troll account
---
Out of curiosity, is there anyway to track the progress on those unlocks?
---
The best is pressing it and getting hit anyway while it‚Äôs active and you go down and get exhausted.
---
You can see them by looking down
---
Turning my camera around and seeing Leatherface chasing me. He is just very unsettling to me.

---
So do I, the killer choice is great!
---
I cannot believe you want me to smile when you have single handedly destroyed my hopes and dreams for this game. How is it that you hurt an entire group of players to appease a handful of "snowflake" killers. This game should be renamed dead in water.

When you caption a meme and it takes quite a lot of words to get your point across about a very specific situation that is quite rare to happen but at least you thought it was funny so you end up spending a lot of time of making the meme but its not really that funny but at least you it makes you feel wholesome

You're part of the reason this game needs to remove ranked until a good rank/punishment system is implemented.
---
Story time:
---
The only time I've been toxic without reason was when I was checking out the boobs mechanic in Kate. So i was ducking and standing. so right after I discovered it was true and she had that,  i suddenly heard a bell, so my first tought was "Quickly, act as if you knew he was there and continue taunting or the wraith'll think you are a pervert" So i continued to provoke that wraith. until I could lose him.
---
The only killer with 3 basekit perks that I actually enjoy a lot. When I saw the beaten Dwight I feelt bad for him =( poor Dwight
---
Right. Hopefully the next update changes that
---
I don't think so. bodyblocking the killer at a hook from either of the killer's sides seems fundamentally different than the front, and the field of view is partially what the problem is in that instance when it really isn't for bodyblocking from the front
---
I agree, I would love to see Philip Ojomo before the entity took him. Man's a damned tragic character who was just doing his best.
---
SFW, yes. I was referring to the comms via Discord. Those were explicitly not included to add the ‚Äúfear factor‚Äù. The problem is the Devs haven‚Äôt quite admitted to themselves that nearly all the SWF groups use Discord (why wouldn‚Äôt you talk to your friends if you are already on the computer). This changes how the game is played, but the game isn‚Äôt really designed for it. That, I feel, is where the major issue of balance between killer and survivor comes in. Killer can be OP in solo. Survivor can be OP in SWF.
---
Bodyblocking isn‚Äôt an issue, imo.
---
I don‚Äôt know tbh.
---
&gt;I would love your thoughts on my comments in here.
---
I can't take these comments seriously enough to bother answering with actual explanations to why this is a dumb discussion.
---
How old are you? I dont even mean that as insult, but something like that cant reasonably come from anyone but a long time unemployed or a kid knowing they can play all afternoon.
---
For me I like using the emblem system to determine how well i play. It just adds another layer for me and makes it more interesting.
---
Spinning if not fast enought feels like it takes longer. I did it before but when i heard my friend smack his controller and got out of the killer grasp, never again i rolled that stick
---
‚ÄúMuch like Freddy‚Äù 
---
Yea I‚Äôm not sensing anything good here.
---
Feels like dc'ing is a major problem on PC huh? I mean, I play on PS4 an while theres a lot of dc, is nothing compared to pc plataform. I wonder why though, since the pc offer a better quality in gameplay overall
---
It‚Äôs just license issues, the only reason Ash has multiple is Bruce Campbell letting BHVR use his likeness.
---

---
Look at me. I'm the killer now
---
This whole legion outrage created more dcs and as a result it created the "I'm not having fun, so I'm going to DC" mentality. Now some people use it for any situation where they aren't having fun
---
They say you get better perks on your bloodweb (higher percentage to get rarer perks and items). I‚Äôm currently working towards it, I just learned about this recently myself.
---
And also once you get to level 50, don‚Äôt get the gem in the middle until you farm a lot of bloodpoints (max 1,000,000) . The gem in the middle is for you to prestige. You can keep working on that same bloodweb once you reach 50 until you are done farming since it keeps coming back once you‚Äôre some.
---
It‚Äôs a glitch and inconsistent at that. Obviously against that but I don‚Äôt identify bodyblocking with that.
---
It will likely go onto the PTB alongside the Legion changes this wednesday or next wednesday. I'd say sooner rather than later as the trailer has been out for a bit and the Legion changes were announced awhile ago.
---
After about a week to two weeks of testing it will go live.
---
The major kinda throws me off. Major would be season 3 of the show or a new movie. I highly doubt this is a announcement for a chapter.

Bodyblocking should be bannable to be honest... This is clearly exploiting!!! At the very least if a survivor is under the hook while the killer is carrying someone, that survivor should receive exposed status for a minute!!!! ^/s
---
It's on PC, acknowledged by devs, and is bannable.
---
Yeah its gotten out of hand. I want to understand what counts as these people as fun. I‚Äôm pretty sure it involves tea bagging a killer after stunning them but thats just my theory.
---
I have no idea on the Console side, I can only guess that one part of the problem is the after game chat  and the toxicity build from it.
---
Lol dude its just common sense to wiggle, ya kno just in case the killer fucks up and goes the long way to a hook. Fuck if they dont wiggle and I see basement I'm heading that way.. once you start wiggling I'll be to close for you to wiggle out.

The only thing is, don't just leave against a swf. Just because its a swf doesn't mean they are try harding in anyway, they may be better than you but they aren't necessarily bad people.

For some reason this game contains only the two extremes of people, the nice people who are just having fun and just say gg. Or the people who are honestly more annoying than anything else in this game, they t-bag at every chance and say ggez after every game.

but just remember to have fun and eventually you will learn to counter most things

Ooooo i forgot about that part and i use the perk lolol that makes sense
---
So... whose fault do you think it is that Legion's mechanics are so fundamentally broken in the first placethat players are abusing them like this? It couldn't possibly be the developer's faultfor that kind of error, could it?
---
People are letting BHVR off the hook far too easily on this - they were told in closed testing that Legion was broken, that were told in the PTB that legion was broken, they were told on release that Legion was broken, they were told in the mid-chapter update that Legion was broken, and they're still being told Legion is broken months later to this very day.

I hate this game more and more. I am not a particular good survivor but I loved playing. Now every patch seems to me like only the killer benefits from it. I only played killer in the beginning for trying out so I am not that sure. But like you stated it, I think there‚Äôs no need for a hatch anymore. They could simply get rid of it.

These are cute! Would you consider doing other characters?

Wiggle should not be set to left stick in the first place, its A D to wiggle on PC so why not something like L1/R1 or L2/R2?

NON EXISTING KILLERS

Exactly this, I completely stopped playing killer at rank reset because I was sick of people with MoM, sprint burst, Adrenaline and urban evasion t-bagging at every single pallet or window.
---
So you rather vs nurse than legion? Yikes
---
THAT'S IT IM DEAD
---
Who tf actually cares enough to look at the killers perks, add someone on steam, then the person has to care enough to add you back, then I'm gonna tell them the killers perks. The devs have to be dumb to think that
---
But you can be arsed to respond with non-answers?
---
They have separate teams working on separate things. The people who do bug fixes are not the same people who do the work towards releasing a Killer, survivor and map.
---
Except the knife add ons don't stack
---
Yeah with double pallets and vacuum back in 2017 exhaustion perks needed a nerf, but now that there is a reasonable amount of pallets exhaustion perks would only trigger twice in a chase if you are like really bad at catching survivors
---
Maybe some people just don't want to farm? It's kind of boring and can get pretty annoying when you just want to play a normal game.
---
Legion is going to end up like every other Killer that has no ability to pressure survivors in a chase, apply map pressure, or force survivors to spend time doing things that aren't productive to the team's escape efforts. Legion is basically going to be a Trapper with one trap.
---
It's hard to tell if Legion will be completely unplayable, but I do know that they've made their power the least threatening part of the kit - meaning Legion is now in the "M1 Killer Hellhole" of Trapper, Pig, Doctor and so on of Killers who can't do anything against a competent team over Rank 15.
---
DC = 10 minute time out, simple.
---
I am Bad, I lol
---
don't get it. what is this?
---
1000 iq pig
---
If the killer can‚Äôt find hooks to begin with because of the loss of their aura when nearing them it makes it so your teammates have more time to find the hook to sabo. I‚Äôve ran this build many times, tenacity is far less useful for the build.
---
I have the same issue. I stopped being pissed at survivor who dc because I got kicked out five times in a row midgame. It said the killer did but my friend was still ingame.... for me it‚Äôs simply unplayable right now
---
GOOD POST OP
---
You can heal faster with self care if you use botany.
---
The main difference is just how few options you have to counter MoM.
---
To counter borrowed time you just target the unhooker, (but that won't work if the unhooker has MoM).
---
Dead hard can be predicted unless it's used just to extend a loop, which is strong but not as strong as a free hit.
---
Adrenaline, well tbh I hate adrenaline anyway but at least the game can be over before it activates, which is possible but less likely for MoM, and it has the cost of putting you in exhaustion even if you weren't already.
---
Unbreakable is a counter to slugging. If you have the chance and the reason to slug for an extended time then you're probably already doing well. Its biggest effect is as a comeback perk to keep the game from being lost if the killer downs everyone, it can win games that were almost lost but it usually doesn't turn a winning game into an unstoppable one.
---
With MoM though, you either have to devote the game to countering one use of it (as it's almost impossible to tunnel everyone before it comes into play), you have to play a character or perk that can counter it, or you have to just take it.
---
Then no offense but that kinda confirms you don‚Äôt know what your talking about. like legion before yea he was flawed and yeah I didn‚Äôt like him but what they did was exponentially too much. his power is useless in the sense that it can‚Äôt even help down survivors which is what a killers powers are for plus his power is too easily countered. When you played legion how many times did you hit your hits?
---
Parks and rec
---
Still no again. Consider killers not 115, having double Sprint burst or dead hard would be stupid. Let it be.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Wraith also gets a speed boost whenever cloaked and out of combat. Legion can‚Äôt even use Feral Frenzy to travel because they get hard stun locked when coming out of it and they lose the ability use it a chase. Legion will have next to no map pressure.
---
I would love to see some perk rebalancing on both sides, would be a lot more fun if most perks were usable instead of having 6 meta perks on each side
---
That would've been a really interesting idea but I think there would've maybe been too big an issue of people not playing him. Like yeah, survivors are basically just skins but I would imagine BHVR doesn't want everyone to level one up for perks and never touching them again.
---
Not bad people -&gt; literally ruining the game for new players and making life needlessly difficult for long term players often de ranking to make sure they get that easier to beat killer player rather than the 100th Billy or nurse because that's all that is viable at top ranks.
---
I dont think it's good advice to tell them to have fun when they are expressing they are NOT having fun right now. Which if they arent it doesnt get any better if they get to a higher rank.
---
Best thing to do is refund, play survivor, or uninstall. Or in rare cases where you have 5 irl friends go play with them in kill your friends. Otherwise he is just putting himself through stress on the promise of "he will get better then the game will be fun".
---
Why are you dissing Bae?
---
Now that is nostalgic!

WHY THE HELL IS THE YELLOW ADD-ON CALLED "GREEN DRESS"?!?
---
Nerfed* and pretty weak.
---
I think that too! I‚Äôm gonna try to go over almost every non viable perk and make a post about them
---
Nah. You're the idiot. The game isn't only played on pc.
---
They should implement some kind of penalty system that will deter people from rage quitting. I'd say a time penalty but that might be a bit lax for this game.
---
If it was 100% reliable, then I could hook someone and see their aura if they were outside the distance. That‚Äôs not the case.
---
You can hide behind a generator aura. You can use distortion. You can hide in a locker. You can run inside the zone real quick. A SWF team can bait the killer to the opposite side of the map by showing their aura while the others hide. All this can work against the killer.
---
As you can see, I‚Äôm sure we can both agree this isn‚Äôt as reliable as you make it sound. The fact that you say you ‚Äúsuck without it‚Äù, just means it‚Äôs your crutch, not every other killers. That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a survivor main and this is very obvious. I mean no offense by this, but this is why you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Anyways. I‚Äôm not gonna waste any more time explaining the obvious just because you want to refute clear evidence. So, good luck in your matches.
---
Its annoying but its fair enough, the pig could just hook you after all
---
Yeah... the devs didn't really think it through.
---
How?
---
Your opinion is different than mine. I dislike but respect that.
---
It said 28% percent was lost. That seems like a pretty decent amount considering that I had killed two survivors already and would have pipped if it didn't take the points. It also counts if someone is running around the hook or running to the hook during chase.
---
Your blade needs sharpening there edge lord.
---
Ok Sir Rusty Blayde
---
ah okay thx I'm not familiar with that layout so I wasn't sure how to read it
---
No cant hes the worst killer what do u mean. You have to wait SEVEN SECONDS before hitting a survivor. Anyone who would main freddy is a complete idiot, they are going to do well at all
---
The only ways this would be good is if paired with an add-on that allowed you to use feral frenzy regardless of how full the power gauge is. Which let‚Äôs face It there won‚Äôt be an add-on like that. They are straight up slaughtering this killer.
---
I didn't catch the name tag I was hoping they're a part of the community on here hence the post
---
I think it's best to wait a bit and actually see some games before declaring it is a nerf
---
Wow, much leak, very proof.
---
My biggest fear with the changes is that they will actually require a very similar playstyle to other Killers. Legion was fun to play because of the unique experience they offered and while they weren't fun to go against for many people they've changed it in a way where I feel Legion is fun to go against now but not to play as they're just an M1 killer with a first hit whereas Pig, Myers, and Freddy are all M1 killers with first hits but also have other more interesting powers.  
---
I suppose the PTB will reveal all but I'd rather Legion be terrible and unique then be generic in any way. And these changes seem to make them both bad and boring.
---
Bodyblocking is the easiest thing ever to counter, walk to the nearest hook and only swing when they are blocking the prompt to hook. 
---
90% of the time you hook the survivor anyway and the one time you dont the whole team is injured and no progression has been made on gens, I dont know why people moan about it.
---
I commited a tiny bruh
---
Cheatable? Is there some glitch or exploit that is broken?
---
I agree the glitches need to be fixed but that‚Äôs not really relevant to this thread. OP‚Äôs just having issues with bodyblocking in general.
---
I wasn't toxic, I just gave the killer a hard time. Think we had the gates open too
---
I couldn‚Äôt care less about pipping, a pip can‚Äôt unlock perks but you know what does? 
---
Bloodpoints
---
So if those gates are powered that sacrifice is more important
---
Sounds boring?  Yeah, I agree it is boring when people DC and ruin the match.  It's even more boring to stand around for 10 min while people repair gens.  I don't get a whole lot of time to game so I'd prefer to actually be playing the game rather than farming.  I shouldn't have to punish myself just because some other guy rage quit.
---
After the gate is open it should get rid of the camping penalty because as soon as the gates open the game is over. Walking away from the hook with the gates open is just dumb
---
I do not blame killers who DC on Haddonfield. I‚Äôve noticed that Lerys is becoming eerily similar to Haddonfield, it has a lot of extremely safe vaults.
---
Pirate killer would be dope, something seems fishy here though.
---
The only thing I don't like with this change is how survivors mend timers don't go down when you mend, and since it no longer goes down in the terror radius the only way you go down from deep wounds is to refuse to mend at all. I'm happy with all the other changes as it already fits my current playstyle.
---
I never really place more than 2 or 3 traps at the start and I might put one maaaaaaybe two down as I move to check gens for survivors. I use Discordance to help me get an idea of how the early game pressure needs to go
---
No it‚Äôs clearly a nerf. Nothing was reworked he was just massively nerfed and got a slight increase to Movement speed and Terror Radius.
---
Ah man. You‚Äôre a freddy main too? You have my condolences my friend.
---
I didn't hate it or anything, it just felt a little lower quality than they used to do. the costumes weren't as well done and they should have found someone else to do Freddy's voice. There wasn't anything terrible about it, just gonna take them a while to get back to where they were
---
I disagree. 
---
Fairly infrequently does the 7 seconds actually fuck you over. Even then, using a range addon mitigates this issue heavily, to the point where you won't even notice the timer. 
---
I used to main Freddy and I had plenty of fun and good times with him.
---
Can‚Äôt we be both?
---
If youve killed two I have no idea why you were camping that hard, soft patrolling until you spot the last guy and then chasing him out would have worked. 
---
Camping ever is generally bad for pipping, even after the gates powered trying to get another guy usually gets more pip points
---
I dont know exactly how it would work, but I know the devs would never go through with it. Too much time and effort. I guess we have to accept legion for who they are.
---
That's not true. You don't lose any points when another survivor is within 10 meters of the hook. You don't even know what you're talking about.
---
A lot of the good killers left. Having the devs straight up tell us they didn‚Äôt wanna make good killers. Didn‚Äôt sit well with any of us. Then they sealed the deal by murdering a Killer after the year and a half it took them to finally revive Freddy.
---
I agree that its pretty stupid. Like i aint a swf just let me see the perks and move on. Nobody cares enough to message someone the killer perks when they die. What i do care about is my time and i dont wanna wait for the game to end just to see if my noed prediction was right
---
OP told me that this is an issue they have as well so it's perfectly relevant
---
Who the FUCK brings spirit fury ON A NURSE?!?!?! fucking loved this video man, that shit was so funny
---
Ok I was just memeing lmao I love playing Freddy, and your guide helped me a lot with his playstyle. I just hate the people who just do the same thing I did, only reference the 7 seconds in an argument about why hes bottom tier.
---
His power can be exploited, not allowing a targeted survivor to get a chance to mend because the Legion is always after them, forcing them to try and hold chase as long as possible with little to no chance of being able to mend.
---
There's also Moonwalking (walking backwards) as Legion, which lets you still go after a survivor without technically being in chase. It takes some skill to moonwalk well though, and can really anger some survivors. No matter what you do though, you'll probably have people upset at you-
---
You're like a giant Meg spider. I loved the part when you went down into your burrow for the rescue.
---
I‚Äôve been cleansing a totem and someone popped the last gen then it lit up and the killer saw me do it. She was pissed and I had to run for about 2 mins before someone got the doors open.
---
Shit?
---
What are your thoughts on other related issues people mentioned like
---
*bodyblocking occurring from the side and back
---
* the inability to drop a survivor
---
How did I get nearly 30 percent taken away then? I only camped one person at the end of the game and the only other time was when someone else was around the hook.
---
What about the ability to bodyblock from the side and back and inability to drop a survivor you're carrying?
---
Freddy really needed a complete rework, not just tweaks like other killers. His power is more of a drawback than an advantage.
---
Gotta get all the tags you can
---
Must sexually identify as what
---
They should honestly just introduce some kind of warning that the injured survivor has Mettle of Man activated while healing.
---
Legion is very nerfed. Trust me I get that he was given something to compensate for his now useless ability but it‚Äôs not enough. 
---
A killers power means everything. Yes perks play a huge part but abilities are undoubtedly more important. Legions ability was deep wound. It was flawed from the start. Deep wound in theory was supposed to offer a punishing bleed out and instead it offered a unique way to down survivors. Now it offers neither. And any chance at a bleed out was also ripped away. Let‚Äôs say a survivor did get away and forget to mend or maybe wasn‚Äôt fast enough. Now mending pauses the timer when in the terror radius AND when mending. Which means a survivor forced to get up will not be punished for mending it a bad spot. They are also ripping away legions unique method of downing. 
---
Deep wound is useless now. Not only does it offer nothing in terms of the deep wound it also doesn‚Äôt help in chases. Honestly they should scrap deep wounds entirely. Make it an injure that cant down. Because no matter what scenario you put it in Deep wound is completely useless. And the fact that the devs are undoubtedly going to leave add-ons that affect the deep wound status effect in means that not only does the legion have a useless deep wound that doesn‚Äôt work or do anything useful in general but now the killer will also have useless add-ons that aren‚Äôt worth running. 
---
I‚Äôll never understand how people think this will be good in any shape or form. His power was completely slaughtered. He will be banished to the ‚ÄúI just got looped for 5 gens‚Äù killers. And 115 movement speed is a laughable buff as it will only help slightly.
---
Back again u/DeadByBS is back. Tell a friend.
---
There are add ons for that
---
Why should i do that?
---
Hit them
---
Cause you find the connection in everything
---
Please pick up your fucking 5?
---
Not outside of making yourself a .txt document.
---
You dont know how annoying it is when I 99% myself with Self-care and have resilience and as I'm walking up to or away from a gen I get tapped to full by a teammate,
---
I personally feel like they stayed the same and I loves Freddy's voice but I can see your opinion and won't judge you for it. But agree that the Jean Grey line was dope.
---
&gt; ive played the game for over a year, mainly killer
---
same
---
&gt;  and I have no idea what your talking about
---
multiple other people *in this very comment section* have described the same thing. it's a very rare occurrence but it is the most rage inducing thing i have ever experienced 
---
&gt; A survivor blocking the hook can just be smacked if they are blocking the hook prompt there isnt some weird thing you can do to not be hit
---
I don't get why this is hard for you. if a survivor is blocking from the back or side, they cannot just be hit from wherever the fuck you want. again, multiple other people have described this happening
---
&gt; If you want to drop the survivor when survivors are blocking fine but its the wrong play and gives the survivors what they want you to leave the downed guy and not get a hook
---
AGAIN if you are right in front of the hook and this glitch where they can block from behind and beside you is being used, you have to drop them
---
There's already teams working constantly on doing this. It's not that all the devs work on one chapter at a time, there are bug fixing teams and optimization teams and chapter teams all working constantly. Just because they're releasing DLC doesn't mean they aren't working on other things, infact we know that they are because they've been working on dedicated servers and the infinite loading screen, we've already gotten the first patch for the latter.
---
You can't just put people on a job in software development, they have to know how their part works, how to perform their role (not just how to code, but what their tasks and procedures are in the team) and their team has to be able to coordinate their efforts, bigger teams hurt development more often than they help. If they were to devote everyone just to optimization and bug fixes it would take 3 months of nothing but training before they could get back to work at half the speed they already have.
---
If we want to focus more efforts on bug fixing and optimization, the real way to do it would be to spend more time bug-fixing chapters before they come out, maybe a chapter every 3.5 months instead of 3. Then they'd probably be creating the chapters faster than they're getting released, and a small amount of people could be redirected from that into re-working more of the old content that needs it, since that's close to their role already.
---
well that of course too
---
I would think essentially make it a lot like Spies Of The Shadows but for survivors
---
And that they're back, been waiting a long time for this
---
I jus don‚Äôt understand what took away that 3 from 80 tbh, most stuff seems to be even numbers in the store.
---
Thanks man I‚Äôll give it a shot. Just gotta dump some BP into him to get some different stuff. I just assumed the anti pallet build would be good but I guess it‚Äôs not a strong as I hoped. I end chases pretty quickly but I see what you mean by if it doesn‚Äôt end fast enough to leave so the traps don‚Äôt get disarmed. I‚Äôve also encountered a lot of the times my traps are totally left alone, they either just avoid the pallet that it‚Äôs at or just never go near them. I guess trap placements I‚Äôll get better as I go on. I know window traps to shut down infinite‚Äôs are good but other than that and just at pallets I really don‚Äôt know where else to trap
---
Once you get out of low-mid ranks you don‚Äôt find many if no campers at all since camping means you don‚Äôt actually gain any ranks.
---
can't promise anything but imma try
---
huh so you think it's okay that survivors can block without being between you and the objective. interesting to see people defend anti-killer glitches hmm
---
&gt; if you‚Äôre aware of your surroundings it‚Äôs not an issue if they‚Äôre behind you. Just turn around and hit them.
---
not viable if you have one on the side and one on the back and killer field of vision actually makes this incredibly difficult. it's not as easy as you're pretending
---
Vondruke.
---
If you have autism, it does not mean you are stupid. I work in an engineering firm and work with several people on the spectrum. You just have to find your niche where you can work at your pace in your way. 
---
For the game, it may be your current rank and region, but my experience has been mostly SWF in coms during killer matches. At least a 2 man, but 3 and 4 mans are common. When you see 3-4 people load in, one with a flashlight (purple), one with a toolbox (BNP), and one with a medkit (insta-heal), it is kind of obvious. Usually one has Small Game and runs finds the totems or traps. 
---
I don‚Äôt dodge matches or DC, so I have to put up with people purposely being toxic.
---
Clickbait to get a high upvoted post ^_^
---
Yup and instead of fixing the problem or blocking certain add ons until they can fix the many problems with legion, they instead are gonna ban players. This company has a back asswords approach to dealing with things and also communicating with its players, until way later when the damage is already done. But like any corporation it‚Äôs all about making that money and fuck the customer! I know I‚Äôm not a game dev but come on have some common sense and take care of things as they occur, I doubt it‚Äôs that hard to block something since every other game dev does this until it‚Äôs fixed. So what if you have to pull that killer down to fix it, at least then it shows you care about the customers. Don‚Äôt throw it to the back of the closet because you wanna make a buck.
---
I replied to you elsewhere, and stop being disingenuous. You know this is not possible in this particular situation I'm describing
---
i look sexy as fuck ngl
---
I had something similar happen where the totem light up right as I was at 98% finished...the killer immediately DC'd lmao
---
If its a glitch your talking about then im done, its not supposed to be in the game and your just trying to be technically right by talking about a glitch. Im talking about playing the actual game and dealing with bodyblocking not dealing with glitches. Why are you talking about a glitch in a discussion about bodyblocking (never seen this glitch before btw)

Honestly perks like adrenaline and MoM need to be ultra rare. Too much of a game shattering perks to not have them be ultra rare.
---
lol. feel free to post it yourself with the clickbait title
---
Not real.
---
For a second I thought that was a bong
---
I mean its boring if survivors legit genrush but tbh the terms long since lost meaning. Actual genrushing is doing gens and ignoring everything else in the game, letting teamates die and just doing gens and leaving
---
Hahaha I also found that humorous.
---
Gen rushing is not toxic, think of it this way, is it toxic to score lots of points in basketball to keep your lead so your team can win or should you let the other team catch up before you keep scoring?
---
Did the flashlight pay for his cab after ?

Seriously I was wondering today about how awesome it would look if Kate had some kind of like white dress, now I‚Äôm seriously excited.

---
That's literally a straight upgrade to self care before the healing changes, when it was a near-mandatory perk, AND it now gives a bloodpoint bonus? 
---
It's hardly a bad perk at all now, it's just not something you take every game like it was.

&gt; If its a glitch your talking about then im done

oh okay you should tell this to all the people screeching about legion exploits :)

&gt; Im talking about playing the actual game and dealing with bodyblocking not dealing with glitches. Why are you talking about a glitch in a discussion about bodyblocking (never seen this glitch before btw)

Because the glitch is associated directly with bodyblocking? fucking christ this should be obvious

oh fugg im wrong better be self-righteous anyway
---
You're not wrong. Just bring a med kit at that point.
---
I‚Äôd try to change your mind if you had one
---
I swear, maybe it's just because I'm only rank 17, but survivors only ever want to "save" me from the hook after they run the killer in front of me, which, shockingly enough, kills me everytime.
---
Love this game, sticking to being good ol Micky Myers.
---
no but you can't complain when NOED hits you
---
Haha it looks like shit on a hook
---
I needed this today.
---
Do people have a particular issue with Billy? I main him and I've never had a DC because of it, maybe I'm lucky. I know Nurse and Legion aren't fun at all to play against but I always thought playing against Billy was pretty fun and engaging, assuming he isn't running Moonshine and cross-map snipes you on a generator.

Farmer? Farmer John?

So I have dark matter and ever dlc weapon and maps plus hero gear in bo3 will I loose all that if I change my name has someone checked bo3 yet

That‚Äôs just scummy

---
Yeah, the issue is that they're going to default to the exact playstyle of other killers. Pretty much the opposite of the OP.
---
*Mains Killer*
---
It's not much, but it's honest work
---
The ones of this sub are. I love it.
---
technician... eww
---
That‚Äôs gotta suck tho, you‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh hell ya I got my noed‚Äù and then it gets destroyed
---
First time playing survivor, I've been playing killer for 2 years
---
GenRushing is not real its just them doing the only objective pretty much doing gens
---
Right. That is my issue. The best killers actually have their own play-style. Here, it will be first hit mindlessly free, then 115% M1 killer like every other. You can‚Äôt outsmart people with your special (unique) power. No mind-gaming with the power. Unless something special happens with the addons, it will be bland Trapper without traps. 
---
Yes,  you can still regular mindgame, but that means downing the survivor is not special and unique to that killer.
---
According to your theory the next killer doesn‚Äôt need to relate to the plague. You say that the Nightmare is related to the Wraith even though he was released quite a few chapters later.
---
To be fair the devs are pretty good already and from a siege veteran, I‚Äôm pretty sure there are fewer then 10 devs working on that cash grab of game and I hope it rots, operation health sucked.
---
Dead by daylight how ever seems to have consistent new fixes and updates, but I‚Äôm not sure if a health update would help and probably only just make the game stale, so you‚Äôd be right
---
I've played killer for 2 years and thus was my first time playing survivor so idk what perks to choose
---
Why is this post not showing on the feed?
---
He doesn't have any putting this dbd wouldn't make any sense since the Babadook is all in Amelia's head

I've been using that name for the past few days lol hope you're talking about me
---
To rank now you have to do things in all four categories. That's the only way you're going to pip up now with the new ranking system. Good luck!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call them stupid straight up but the way they are approaching the situation has a level of stupidity and ignorance.
---
The problem is that deep wounds doesn't really apply pressure. Since they aren't changing the time and making it less impactful  (when it was already pretty weak) it's going to be a hard nerf. If the Legion leaves after hitting you you can just start mending immediately and have it half done before they hit another person. Basing the killer around a terrible effect like deep wounds was a mistake.
---
I love doing this. It‚Äôs hilarious to trick Survivors into jumping into the Hatch and then hooking them.
---
Indeed I do think I got a little heated. The way they approached his exploit nature was very uncontent creator like of them.
---
The hitbox when vaulting through a window is also fucked, you can be a solid 5 steps away from the window and still get hit from the otherside. It honestly makes the game almost unplayable
---
How is that scummy? The killer‚Äôs job is to kill. If you can guarantee a kill, what should stop you? Particularly when exit gates are open?
---
This is genius
---
I remember one time when I was looping a pig, threw her a pallet while she swung, stuned her, the animation got interrupted- but she teleported at the other side of the pallet and hit me.
---
It was so confusing we look at each other like ????? She even looked at the pallet and then at me and then at the pallet again. She gave me a head start and then resumed our chase lol
---
To be fair they were doing terrible anyways and probably wouldn't have gotten a single kill anyways. They hadn't gotten a single hook at that point and I assume they were fairly new to the game or to playing as the plague.
---
They did it as killers were ranking up to easily and getting to ranks they had no business being in, now ranks are more about overall performance
---
Understandable no worries :) hopefully the butchering of Legion will put an end to this wave of unnecessary excessive dc‚Äôing
---
Do you have a link to the vid?
---
Theres like a 5% chance to do it at least let them try and if you want the kill smack em back down
---
Billy cry.

I have DBD installed on my SSD. Out of my friend group, I seem to be the most likely to freeze on load. My friend and I compared stats and hardware and the only difference we can discern is that I'm on Windows 7 and he's on 10. It happens to me ~1/15 games. Really sucks because it's so hard to find lobbies where the host won't instantly leave or have 600 ping. And then you gotta make it past the loading screen. And then if you're lucky enough to have all 4 load in, you have to hope that people won't d/c after their first or second down. It's a tired shitshow.

Toxic ass pig

pig isn't holding the game hostage, and if anything is just wasting her own time when she could have downed and hooked the claudette much faster
---
For a bit of context, this is a fan perk made months before Dark Devotion and the Demise of the Faithful chapter. It was designed as a perk for The Actor (aka Ghostface of Scream) Ever since the new chapter was released I thought the perk sounded familiar and recently rediscovered this fan-made chapter.
---
110% killers have a huge problem with large structures with any windows. Most of the game's loops are decently balanced around 115%. I main Wraith and I don't find most maps to be painful if I play them right.
---
You can crunch through tiles pretty quick once you got a hang of the game.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
If this nerf happened and he was kept at 110%, he'd be incredibly weak. But 115%? Idk, he seems pretty damn strong. Like a flat out better pig/ doc/ wraith.
---
Nope. It's super frustrating. I've been playing DBD for over a year and even had an early phase of "maining" Bubba and I still haven't unlocked Athlete or Smartface spite Meg and Clauds being super common.

Dark Devotion?

I'm not sure what to do with this

why? she's not doing anything against the rules.
---
what exactly is wrong here
---
You got the easy ones then. Potatoes that think they are Ochido. I get them every so often. The toxic ones I see have 1 or 2 people (safely) doing gens whenever I am chasing one of them and constantly relay my position. Nothing I can do to stop them. 
---

You know.... The one on the hook can't stop someone from farming them off the hook. It isn't a "mistake." You're ruining the game for someone even more than their teammate just did. So basically you're admitting to being a tunneling piece of shit because for you it's better to "punish" someone who was just griefed by their teammate. Not everyone is swf. There's a lot more people that solo queue. So instead of punishing the griefer, you go after the guy that had no control over the situation. Fuck logic though right?

I only DC when i have to leave, or an emergency is happening, if you DC cause you downed, then you are a moron.

I‚Äôve never heard of blocking from the side or seen it happen but thats obviously not intended to work like that and its also obvious thats not what the guy I replied to is talking about. He‚Äôs saying its OP har a survivor can crouch out of a killer‚Äôs FOV and be in the way and that the half a second it takes to look down and smack them is ‚Äúprecious time‚Äù wasted. Which is just ridiculously pathetic
---
Not being able to drop someone is really stupid though and Im not sure why it happens. I‚Äôve never tested it but Im pretty sure if a survivor stands to your left then you cant drop the survivor thats on your shoulder for some reason.
---
Normal bodyblocking though is not an issue and is very rarely ever useful. In most cases it just gives the killer a free hit because of how close hooks are to each other on most maps now.
---
It is a bad perk. You waste 1/2 of a gen healing in a game where you get rewarded for playing aggressively
---
Less nsfw fan art
---
Well this is canon now.
---
If you cant see it then they are jumping in and out of lockers all the time in chases to anoy the killer, i dont mind since it means they are not doing gens. But there is no other purpose of it then to anoy... did you watch it without sound maby?
---
Idk then... that sucks
---
These tier lists are so stupid, I love it.
---
&gt; Normal bodyblocking though is not an issue and is very rarely ever useful. In most cases it just gives the killer a free hit because of how close hooks are to each other on most maps now.
---
I literally never disputed this at all and in fact my comments even say that bodyblocking is fine. I'm just saying that there are some glitches connected to it that fuck the killer for no reason
---
It amazes me too how people can be so toxic in DbD. I thought that the roles were simple. The killer has to kill the survivors, while the survivors try to escape. There can't be that much toxicity because everyone has a certain role, right? Wow, was I wrong.
---
What's up with the hostility? I just took a screenshot of what i saw
---
Wait I missed the memo? What's an infinite mend glitch?
---
The Adam was afk because he had to eat but after he came back he was doing one gen and after that the killer got panic and Adam could get the hatch
---
If your 3 teamates are doing gens, by the time you are dead the game is out

I‚Äôve never been cross map hatcheted before. I hit them but they do not hit me :(

More context: My friend wasn‚Äôt having the same issues on there side which I showed near the end of the video and only they got out because we were distracted and laughing so hard. The auras were all messed up and the Sky was glitching around. If you want me to post the other videos on Reddit I will.

One time I was playing Myers and got a 4K with no gens done and still didn‚Äôt pip.

When I first saw the spirit, I was kinda hoping the survivor struggling sounds would be louder because..... when picked up..... she sets the survivor.. on her shoulder with jagged glass sticking out.
---
Not really anymore imo. People mostly were annoyed by him when he was overly common in high ranks. He is still relatively common but not over the top and at least he is no Legion/Nurse. Some people also dislike playing against Spirit because there is no real getting away against here once you are injured. 
---
Billy is strong but not really annoying to play against.

I don‚Äôt care how hard a SWF whoops my ass, I‚Äôm gonna be laughing about the silly stuff they come up with the whole game
---
Classic PS4 version haha
---
Exactly, positive reinforcement is the way to go for this issue. You just know its bad thing if NOBODY cares about depipping.
---
Decided to edit some crappy phone photos of my Plague since the photographer couldn't make it to the con, sooo I made the best of it.  
---
Tried to show off the prosthetic on the last photo. You can see some blisters on the arms. I'm sure if I had more time I'd be able to do better but oh well. I stressed together this entire cosplay and started day 2 or 3 of the PTB &gt; - &gt;
---
The killer seems confused "wtf that nea doing...?"
---
I feel called out.
---
I have a better strategy to not getting disconnects.
---
1. Go to DbD
---
2. Delete DbD
---
Thank me later.
---
Many years ago this was a terrifying sight. Pure sabo Jakes that permakilled every hook on the map. This way back when, before even the hag herself, when this was scarier than flashlight SWFs.
---
Probably not, so you don't end up trying to pick up survivor and accidentally open the gate.
---
Back when this was scarier than flashlight SWFs
---
Yea the problem is that the gens were completed way too fast which basically made killing them useless. Killing survivors doesn‚Äôt count toeards any of the 4 categories. So basically I had bronze and gray categories.
---
Doubt. Hitting her, chasing her and hitting her again, and would have been faster slightly maybe, but hanging her up again and risking another rescue, why when you could only wait 10 more seconds and she's gone completely?
---
It's smart, would have done the same.
---
genuinely. that man plays a SCARY Billy and while i've never faced him (rank + location, i think), i have friends who have, and i watch his stream all the time. he's like, basically the least toxic person playing this game right now, it feels like.
---
Less than three
---
Maybe they could implement a 100% faster repair speed if you are the only one alive. This would make it viable to get a generator alone. Kind of like a stronger Left Behind.
---
Not as much as Doctor fam. Plus it's hard to know if it's a real smile ith that mask on.
---
I do too. Nurse is way stronger but games against Legion are M1 simulator slogfests.
---
If the Nurse doesn't run too strong addons it caneven be fun trying to mindgame her.
---
When survivors do gens too quickly it badically fucks up killers rank. So I recommend just leaving if theres tool boxes.
---
‚ÄúWraith isn‚Äôt doing so good in the meta.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs give him a speed buff when he‚Äôs uncloaking.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúGood idea!‚Äù
---
*several months later*
---
‚ÄúLegion isn‚Äôt doing so good in the meta.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs too fast for survivors without having any application for said speed, leaving legion players constantly moon walking due to the absolute worthlessness of their ability.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWell let‚Äôs just fuck his entire sprint ability and make him speed walk‚Äù
---
‚ÄúW-what?‚Äù
---
*whispering* ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do a pretty good job.‚Äù
---
I didn‚Äôt have sound. Yeah the locker jumping was really obnoxious
---
what's that on the wraiths face?
---
It depends on exit gate location. If they are next to each other, that is cruel.
---
Very true.
---
I dunno. Spamming locker notifications is extremely obnoxious
---
Myers has enough add ons that make him have different play styles which keeps playing him fresh. 
---
Hag is fun to pop up and scare people 
---
Clown is also pretty fun too
---
Nice bait.
---
Spooky
---
Lol, so??
---
how bait i literally despise billy
---
Get a 100% boost to generator repairs once you are alone. 40 seconds isn't that long and could give you a chance to repair before the killer arrives.
---
This is false
---
Same for p3 claud
---
Or.
---
**3.** You don't do it at all because it only works.in 0.02% of all cases anyway.
---
1)you cannot say you should plan on winning a game ASAP with the new ranking system it punishes quick games.
---
2) VC gives survivors huge advantages and to neglect that is the biggest convoluted thought you could possibly muster. It removes major surprise factors from the killer and quickly notify other survivors of actual aggro from the killer and their next move. It's not about how you perform as a killer it's about the unfair advantage that it adds for the survivors. If VC is done correctly it allows allows survivors when chased by the killer and do objectives fairly well while them avoiding running into others.
---
3)VC actually performs better than some perks. Because guess what VC is always active. While you can argue skill level of the players, you have to consider that all players are equally skilled in this scenario. I have different groups of friends that I play SWF with. If I instruct the lower skilled players they do perform better and don't make as terrible decisions as usual. When playing with other people at my skill level games are pretty quick and easy. It's not hard to stay spread out.
---
4) DH is typically used to extend pallet loops an extra revolution in most cases. BT is not countered by every killer you can't give random examples of stealth power and the insidious standing still, because at that point you're face camping. If you want to whine about that NOED is countered by doing totems. It rewards bad survivors for not doing the side objective.
---
Freddy is not a DbD character though.
---
This video is unbelievably cursed
---
I think the time ban would work really nicely.
---
I wouldn't go as far as saying I would rather play a legion, but I find that Billy is played too much. Especially in red ranks where it becomes 75 or more percent of games are billy. But it's not people's fault, he's the 2nd or 3rd best killer in the game (depending on who you ask) and he's super easy to learn and become good with
---
Absolutely freaking not.
---
They wont ban killers who use it accidentaly once in a while. They can see if someone used it increasingly often after the exploit became public knowledge and if they kept using it over and over and will judge the situation based on that.
---
Your probably right, my killer rank averages around 13-11 i atleast will admit i suck most of the time. Highest iv been was 7 but that was before pip changes.
---
*Is false*
---
I remember that was a meme here at one point.
---
I don‚Äôt believe there are any experienced survivors at all that would prefer going against a mixtape legion than a billy.
---
i'm glad you like it tbh! i'm just personally disappointed because it looks...idk, cheap. maybe an argument can be made for Kate being "trashy" (i've seen people say it, not that i agree), but i don't think that excuses it. skirt doesn't look like it fits well, shirt isn't even glittery/shiny and looks too bulky...idk. in contrast, i think Claudette's dress cosmetic is gorgeous and i wish they'd done something pretty like that for Kate.
---
We will see. I just think they've made it much easier to do this.
---
I feel you bro. The disrespect and bad manners. Funny how nobody seems to find anything wrong yet, perhaps survivor mains.

Lmao dude this is amazing, thank you for making this!
---
I think huntress is fun but takes time to learn. 
---
Clown is also very fun to play. 
---
Wraith is pretty fun with the right addons. 
---
Spirit is fun but she will make people hate you.
---
Thanks so much for this!
---
I would buy this shit in a heartbeat
---
I was scared. And I'm pretty bad at this game
---
Pebble time!
---
Oh ok that makes sense. I've def seen the killer back out a lot and I wondered why since we were all readied up.
---
Notorious survivor main checking in
---
If you have to open the gate by touching it as a killer you have just wasted all this work.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LusX_1PUm0
---
I literally don't know if people are leaving or actually disconnecting because the game crashes, or something went wrong. The last few games I've played I got DC'd for no reason. The game just crashes and I don't know what to do. 
---
So if I'm about to be banned Overwatch style for something completely out of my hands, I don't think I'll be playing DbD ever again to be quite honest. It's annoying enough to have no way to catch up when all of my lobbies are filled with deranked killers and I have no perks because I just started a few weeks ago.
---
Samination's videos made me think that Trapper belongs to the same tier as Billy and Wraith
---
Rather they so this than do gens lol I know it‚Äôs annoying but at least they‚Äôll all be dead in the end
---
Quite a lot of DBD youtubers use this reskin, I‚Äôm quite sure the devs are aware it exists and don‚Äôt intend on banning those who use it
---
[X] Doubt
---
&gt; We‚Äôve got an upcoming ‚Äùrework‚Äù (heavy nerf) that is gonna make legion incredibly weak.
---
The ability to easily injure any survivor + track the rest after a hit and very easily put the entire lobby into injured state on most maps... And then be a 115% walkspeed killer on top of that.
---
Any time you come across a survivor that is healthy, you take no time at all to put them into a guaranteed injured state with a guaranteed mending phase.
---
Idk, he seems like a **flat out** better pig/ doc/ wraith out the gate, with potential tactics involving when to pop frenzy.
---
This nerf really just seemed to stop the frenzy spammers in their tracks and punish them for dumb shit like missing the swing.
---
Is it "hooks" or sacrifices?
---
This happens on Xbox whenever you use an alt account with your main account signed in
---
Honestly, if a player really wants to do this then so be it, id rather have the odd fool trying to de-rank themselves than players DCing 24/7 because the penalty is rather poor.
---
Some survivors are stupid , yeah.
---
I let last guy wiggle free next to a gate or gen and they run away. I mean , I just fucking passed next to 2-3 hooks on the way here , are you stupid? xD
---
I win matches in 5 mins like this. Hook someone in the basement and stand by the corner with insidious on, the second someone turns the corner ‚ÄúRNNNNNNNNN‚Äù start revving my chainsaw as Leatherface and now I have two. Then a third person falls for it, after hooking them, BBQ let‚Äôs me find the last guy, who turns on the last generator and gets downed with NOED.
---
VALID STRATEGY ;)
---
I mean, there's actually incentive to DC since high rank matchmaking is in the shitter, and literally no one wants to wait an hour to find a match. 
---
As far as I've seen too, high rank killers and survivors just have a million BPs stored away anyway, so what do bloodpoints even matter when you could level two characters or more to full?
---
Sacrifices or moris I believe
---
Pretty much, he is a skilled killer I agree completely.
---
To be honest I can count the amounts I purposely equipped a flashlight to use on one hand still. I still grab for the toolbox whenever I can (yes I started out as Jake)
---
Cheers for letting me know üëç
---
Aight, imma head out
---
Woaw, nice job
---
In the last second I would have panicked and clicked on the wrong button xD
---
Pirate killer could be sick.
---
It‚Äôs not, I don‚Äôt get what else survivors are supposed to do.
---
Amanda would try to avoid watching SAW movies (especially the one she dies in), 
---
Freddy would only want to watch Nightmare on elm street, 
---
Leatherface would probably enjoy TCM, 
---
Meyers wouldnt care about Halloween.

No Mither, Mettle of Man, Self Care, and Solidarity
---

---

---
"Please pick up your fucking trash." üòÇüòÇ Good one!
---
The first step is admitting it.
---
I don't dc because of a specific killer but when it gets to the point where I'm facing my tenth Michael or 8th spirit in a row this goes for most killers I'm just not having fun I like to face a variety of different killers as facing the same one gets stale and boring
---
Oh my, tomb raider meg looks quite exciting lol
---
Beyta killer
---
It's funny
---
I liked how the music almost matched up with you going over the pallet back and forth  :)
---
Good job.
---
and I can make out a hook on the actual perk, like a hook hand, maybe something to do with the hooks on the map?
---
I love his streams&lt;3
---
Like i said to HexOhJeezOhNo i dont mind them doing it for just that reason. But its that they are doing it soley for the intention to anoy even if it costs them the game (and it did)
---
yea because kobe doesnt play football dum dum
---
Adrenaline, ds,borrowed time, mom
---
I think they need to reward good players more than punish the bad ones. Also context is important. I dont think disconnecting from a 3v1 should have any consequences
---
From what I've seen from Monto it seems like it's some kind of exploit that massively increases the time required to mend
---
I don‚Äôt think survivors understand something: you can troll a killer for twenty minutes and they can typically get just enough hits and hooks to pip up and/or earn a fair share of blood points. That doesn‚Äôt make it fine. The remuneration is not commiserate with the agony. One of the worst feelings I get as a Killer is to get stomped on, eke out just enough emblems to pip up, and realize whatever MMR exists in this game counted that as a win and will be pitting me against and even stronger group next time.
---
beautiful, just beautiful. round of applauds to you
---
Yes but are you T A L L
---
The killers base power should be strong enough to stand on its own, the point of addons are to either enhance a base power making it even stronger or change the way you play with a killer. Not everyone is a hacker with 999 iri buttons and even if they decided to throw legion a bone and make irri default in his kit it would still limit them to 1 boring stall based playstyle extremely dependent on certain perks. No matter how you look at it this, legion "update" is a killer DELETING level nerf.
---
Somebody already said the link now directs to a missing page. Guess they took it down already
---
If I was that, I would've smashed my keyboard and thrown my mouse against the wall. That was a good ass moon walk and you crushed all their hopes and dreams. Nice.
---
Ohh...... yeah you are right! Should i delete this and made version 2.0 with insidious?
---
Oh look a camper

---
So did I! I played jake as my main way back when. Then I got my progress reset so mained bill instead.
---
You see I always spun it from the beginning and I'll here people smacking it to the sides and I'll just tell them to spin it in circles as it is more reliable and doesn't harm the controller as badly they just say oh ok then continue to smash there analog stick
---
Leave traps under dropped pallets then break the pallets while they are caught
---
And he did it! Good for him.
---
I‚Äôd say give them more pups for dcing, if they‚Äôre paused off at a good killer and dc let them be pissed off at a rank 1 killer
---
I disagree, I hate DC's but banning players is NOT the answer. If they literally put a disconnect button on their game, then why should the player have to keep track of leaves, the game should be handling over disconnects and disable the button after x times or force the player back into the game, reward people who stay in stacked games, issue warnings/bans on repeat forced disconnects after button is disabled etc.
---
That's like banning players for excessive flash light usage.
---
I think it would work quite well if the third hit permanently put you in the broken state, and can only be healed through a separate perk, such as adrenaline
---
If the timer stops, then they'd know if the survivor is in their terror radius. It would act like Whispers in a way.
---
I rarely choose to dc unless i know i have no chance of surviving. a few games ago first hook i got taken to basement, teamates unhooked me in terror radius and the killer went right back on me and was taking me back to basement. Why stay in the game when i know my teamate will just farm me and I'll lose a pip anyway? I just dc'd and and played swf so i wouldn't get garbage teamates that save me in terror radius without borrowed or bodyblocking the killer.
---
They can‚Äôt see the timer.

---
Yeah actually, I‚Äôve had games like that. Sucks, but I play to end and try to get some points anyways. Besides, I don‚Äôt think survivors want a short game either, they might dick around or let themselves be chased for points
---
Is that ruin you have? Maybe they failed a gen check.
---
If it was locker jumping, perhaps they were doing that to get you to change target which seemed to have worked.
---
Very possible they were being toxic or whatever but maybe they were trying to distract you while another was trying to find the totem.
---
Alright, just your average everyday troll, then.
---
So what, just act like SWF doesn‚Äôt exist?
---
I think Ruin is bit of a waste compared to Corrupt Intervention. Having two minutes guaranteed of no progress on three gens is far more effective than a vulnerable totem that most likely won‚Äôt last a few seconds. It will boost your Gatekeeper score and more importantly give you time to setup traps early game.
---
I had this happen as killer once. I wish I had be recording. All 4 survivors were blows up like this and I couldn‚Äôt see shit.  When they were ON the gen they looked normal, but as soon as they let go. BAM, back to mega size.
---
The only part that makes him objectively worse is the terror radius mend system and whiff system, Both of which were needed changes because they add counterplay.
---
They should honestly fix ultra rares, like you said people can just stockpile them
---
This. No clue why you are being downvoted. Cosmetics in DbD work in three pieces: head, body, pants. A hoodie would cover both, head and body. 
---
The only way to make it happen is locking head and body to not be interchangeable.
---
I agree on the bans but the - pips is not seen as a punishment for some. And if i remember the game cant tell if you DC or the killer DC until we get dedicated servers? but something has to be done YES...
---
Nice.
---
Wait wait wait, your telling me I can open task manager, kill the dbd application and I get to keep my items/offerings/ and addons as killer/survivor?
---
Yeah but the game can still tell when you lose internet versus when you click the DC button, because when you click the button it has to actually run through a script disconnecting you. 
---
It's programmed in so even if other people don't know, the game can still distinguish. It would be a start punishing people who use that button.
---
While I do agree that DC'ing should be punished and encouranging it is not ok, I think that devs should have looked in to their game more and played more against Legion so that they can see what their problems are, why the hell didn't they notice that Legion could abuse the chase mechanic with Deep Wound, think that Frank's Mixtape was an ok add-on to put in to the game and allowed that infinite mending time exploit to come in to live servers? If feels like they had no idea what to do with this character. I feel like the reason they are going to nerf Legion that hard is because they didn't know how to fix their issues and now decided to completly gut this killer so that they're unplayable, but I hope they find a solution to finally fix them.
---
Every day!
---
i‚Äôd say im decently experienced, ive been playing for a year
---
rip its happened to me
---
wraith mains forever though
---
a skilled killer? or a skill-less killer
---
Pls let it rip in peace
---
i hacked the game so insidious is built in fow me üòçüòç
---
Thank you!) Yes, I will try to add new perks from time to time for other survivors/killers .
---
you can see of the video that its locker jumping cause the exploations does not come from a gen. look at the video at the end and its 8 times in a few seconds. And no it did not make me change target, i switched so that i could injure more and get them of the gens. Simply more time efficient.
---
Absolutely not better than Pig/Doc/Wraith. His new Frenzy 1st-hit does what Pig and Wraith do, but worse and slower without the passive OOC bonuses. Doctor is different and dependent on the player.
---
Well I think its not 100% its in her head
---
Sacrifices, as far as I know.
---
i love trapper in those animations hes so PURE
---
It's just better than DCing and contributing to the growing problem and they're the most difficult Killers to find and or interact with without them having to do something.
---
I couldn't think of a better title.  Thought this was funny.
---
Is there autoaim on console?
---
We need more perks like ranchor and devour hope. There has to be a more skill based way to achieve Moris than just burning a semi-rare offering.
---
I disagree with comparing leaving the game to excessive flashlight usage those are two different things. Leaving a game affects everybody the killer losses add-ons, offerings are lost and survivors left in the match are stuck with either a killer thats going to stomp them or a killer that will have mercy and de-pip in the process of doing so. De-pipping is not the worse since there is no true reward for ranks but still its affecting a players ranking. Maybe not ban straight away but something has to be done to the people that have made it seem okay to leave a game as no consecuentes will follow.
---
yes, which is why hillbilly is top tier on console. without it he would be useless on console.
---
You make assumptions that 100% of these disconnects are intentional. Some are, but I believe there is a lot of crashing going on as well. Or connection errors. Something that most people have no control over. To ask for punishment for something you can't control is ignorant.
---
Haha that's awesome man, hate when people play like that especially because you finished the 2nd last gen so you were clearly trying to get both of you out
---
my bb philip i wanna protect him
---
The entire movie is symbolic for the 5 stages of grief
---
i love farmer john üòî
---
Not to be that guy, but your both kinda missing the point of the topic. The first dude in the comment chain is agreeing with the op stating that dcing needs some sort of punishment. Then the dude below him responds stating that there needs to be some sort of "REASON" to stay because getting found first generally isn't "FUN". 
---
Now here is where I interject, if you sign up for a game then proceed to willingly dc from that match because its not going the way you hoped for that is incredibly selfish, childish, and cuntish. When you dc from a match you ruin the entire rest of that match for 4 other people. The man argues that there needs to be "FURTHER" incentive to stay if things aren't going your way but what of the 4 other people your actively their wasting time?
---
Case in point dcing should be reserved for when the game makes a mistake or you have a real life emergency that demands your immediate attention , not because your frustrated.
---
They've honestly been bad since Ash came out for me
---
Have played for over a year and have never encountered this too. I just smack em, cmon bro just press the hit button.
---
I agree self care is bad. The new meta is no mither s/
---
Late to the party but here is Wavy_Sinatra's (The guy who got hit) POV. https://clips.twitch.tv/HungrySmoothDaikonLeeroyJenkins
---
Shouldn‚Äôt they be? In a way that‚Äôs what makes them the big threat, not ridiculously OP and exploitive but enough to diminish the survivors and prove dominant.
---
the only thing that upsets me is the noed on myers
---
yeah theyre the only ones that can kill people
---
eh freddys real
---
a console nurse? especially a ps4 nurse?? brave soul.
---
Why was this different back then? I started playing 2018.
---
I had to cut out a lot of the video, but I left the beginning in to show that I was basically carrying the team at the end.
---
It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever had a close call like THAT CLOSE and it‚Äôs moments like that which make the game worth playing through the glitches and bad teammates.
---
In a sense a killer is meant to be Overpowered. Individually they all have a set of skills that will be overpowered when mastered however USUALLY there is counter play that you can master with time. Legion currently has no counter play but with the upcoming nerf truly no counter play will be highly required to deal with them. End game collapse however may change the view on Killers being overpowered as a whole.
---
Do you have a link to that?
---
I feel like every killer is fun as long as your doing decent.
---
Just came to my mind about that. The killer can counterplay and see what the survivors will play so he can counter before the game seems kinda badly made imo
---

Haiiiii lmao. It really wasn‚Äôt that bad. A lot of tbagging in the beginning but very rarely a ‚Äúget good‚Äù message. It seemed a lot of people respected me at least trying. But it‚Äôs always fun to see people who think EVERY ps4 nurse is a bad nurse. Then they DC when I down them.
---
That's fair bud.
---
I dunno what to say then. Billy is not op in my eyes, and he definitely has multiple ways to counter him and loop him, so idk what the issue is.
---
Which is why there should be a punishment implemented, the world isn't just about you friend. If you dc you are actively wasting 4 other peoples time. You ruin any potential "fun" that match could have had and waste peoples, offerings/addons/and items. All because you were "frustrated" 
---
Here's an idea the average matchmaking time is around 2 minutes, lets take the 4 other people's time your wasting in the match 2x4=8 , congratulations now you have a 8 minute penalty for wasting other people's time selfishly. Do it again and it will get doubled for every single dc, there's your incentive to not leave.
---
Gotta use whatcha got tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è only level 39 trapper
---
ive been trying but the fact that it processes the hit only when you finish swinging on top of them, not in the middle of the swing throws me off
---
Tbh I expect noed on Myers, Billy and LF more than anyone else lol
---
We all know who‚Äôs dying out of those four.
---
i dont think he‚Äôs op, just unfun and doesnt require skill to play well
---
Sydney is pretty much just Laurie. The game‚Äôs survivors are all stereotypes (the nerd, the athlete, the survivalist, the country girl, the cop, the outcast, etc) Stu (the omniscient narrator) or Brooke (the mean girl) would most likely be better since their stereotypes haven‚Äôt been used yet. Dewey and Gale couldn‚Äôt be done since Tapp and Jane would be too similar.
---
ive seen it mostly on pigs and wraiths
---
I should have re phrased that, i mean that if im being hooked and yhe killer is camping while survivors crowed round me
---
just had a 1v2 game against a leigon abusing the inf mending bug. we somehow got 2 gens and i just died infront of the hatch.
---
feelsbadman
---
Thank you! It‚Äôs funny seeing it from his perspective. I really screwed his moonwalk lol
---
id say that at most let us see the addons, thats it
---
How is it unfun? Unless he has insta saw, there are many opportunities to juke or get to a pallet.
---
This. Whenever I play survivor and I don't cleanse totems, when I get hit with NOED I can only be salty at myself, especially since I actually run Small Game.

---
Saw the movie and it confused the hell out of me. Am I the only one? Was the babadook ever even seen? How do we know what it looks like?
---
When's the last time you had a game like that? lmao The fact that they got nerfed out can stand on its own what type of negative impact thear unbalanced items have on the game.
---
Even better the survivors would all have to get 4x the offerings per game to do it.
---
Billy is the most balanced killer in the game. He‚Äôs neither inherently OP nor severely underpowered. 
---
It DOES however take skill to fight against him. Every killer has a weakness. Exploit it.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a little weird at first. And a lot of the time the ‚Äúauto aim‚Äù will cause me to miss a CLEAR hit. But after about 20-30 games you get the hang of what to swing at. If you ever want practice I‚Äôm always happy to help in KYF! 
---
Psn: Riza904
---
Freddy can also surprise people with double block addons (Z Block and Unicorn Block, I don't like Red Paint Brush because reduced move speed is always shit). But after you sleep them the first time and get a free hit, they probably won't fall for it again
---
I agree with you however a lot of people dont. And frankly in many situations i dont blame people for leaving.
---
There needs to be more incentive to not leave or more incentive to not dc due to consequences
---
Hooks didnt respawn back then.
---
i had a game before where this guy with 4k hours + streaming with 50\~ ish viewers blocked me in the basement with a trap on. I was stuck until the timer went down and everyone else escaped. asked him in his chat why he blocked me in the basement and told him its bannable keeping the game hostage. guy just laughed at me calling me a baby trash survivor then something in french about me which i didn't understand.
---
What‚Äôs that?
---
he gets a free instadown , i dont enjoy playing as him nor against him. i feel like i got a cheap win playing as hillbilly
---
Legion's Knife add-ons that increase the time it takes to mend, normally they just increase the base mend time by a few seconds so for example if it took 15 seconds normally it might take 20 now.
---
The glitch instead (if I got it right, might not know the exacts) makes it so every time you get hit by Frenzy and get the Mend timer it keeps increasing the time it takes to mend so for example if it was at base 15 seconds and the add-on adds 5 seconds the first time you Mend would take 20 seconds, then if Legion uses Frenzy on you again it's 25 seconds the second time, and keep adding more and more time every time you get a fresh Mend timer until it takes over a minute to mend yourself and you're either stuck committing to the mend, Legion finds you and downs you because your timer is paused at 0.1 seconds, or you purposely go into Dying to hopefully get back up from another Survivor or Unbreakable.
---
no one's using it for that anymore
---
all add you once i get home, thanks :-)
---
They are both mechanics brought into the game by the developers, therefore the developers are responsible for making sure the mechanics are not abused by their poor game design choices. Blaming the player for using the tools they created is just amateur hour.
---
she didint used dead hard, she used all kind of inmerse perks
---
It goes both ways
---
Yup. Sounds about right.
---
No hooks, no problem
---
You legit just said it happened to you last night when it was nerfed ages ago. You're just being disengenuous here ill be pretentious all day my dude.
---
Yeah! ^ ^ 
---
Thanks!
---
when i play killer, opening gates is so quick .
---
but when im surv its so slow and im like shaking

Wait what do you mean? Like open traps? Under a dropped pallet?

Only good reply

---
Thanks :D
---
Thank you! :3
---
imagine activating feral frenzy and missing the first shot. Getting the fatigue and the survivor escapes because of it. Freaking bullshit. I think the stun for missing attacks is way to much.
---
Right now you are better than me. With all the SWF as killer and DCs as solo survivor, I am having trouble getting past 14-15
---
That's just Nea helping her teammate Fredward though
---
Gotta love it when you get an ambush attack as they're speed vaulting so they just fall face first out of a window after teabagging you. Best thing about Amanda: You can teabag them back.
---
This is amazing! Great worküíô

---
Me too thnx
---
Omg Ha haa!
---
I despise going against the clown cause I just suck against him I time the amount of time I need to get to the pallet or window and then he throws a bottle and gets to me
---
I agree with every word just about. I main legion but lately(even before the patch notes in legion), I've been playing everyone to learn them. I feel that these changes were just rushed is all and some of them a bit unnecessary. Legion will still be playable and probably even fun now that he's not straight broken. The upcoming update isn't bad, but couldve been better
---
Lmfao that's so awesome
---
A bad perk is something like Wake Up. Self Care still most definitely has its uses and doesn't need to be buffed, and we definitely don't need it to be an always-use perk again. At the numbers you stated (28s would be a rate of 57%, not 75%) self care theoretically becomes more efficient than being healed by someone else, since that takes 16s from two people (not counting time spent finding them) for an effective 32s that, as the theory goes, could be spent on gens.
---
That said though, do you really think cutting off 4s is the difference between Self Care being good and it being bad? It's not a significant difference.
---

‚ÄúHahaha you‚Äôre so bad go eat shit and die shit head‚Äù

12 year old voice: ‚ÄúDOOOOD‚Äù
---
i went through a whole game today, was near endgame, and then tried to vault a window, and realized he had pinkie finger, he didnt hit me once before. 
---
then he had noed as well.
---
I just find him boring. So many matches lately are Billy or LF and the instadowns and slugging gets old fast. Wish the game would give me someone else to play against.
---
They‚Äôre healthy, no dead hard for them &gt;:)
---
Anyone else sometimes have wiggle on screen for the whole game? Like if I'm running from the killer and move my left stick to change direction, it counts it as wiggling and instead makes my character stop moving. Needless to say it's very frustrating and makes me an easy down.
---
Seems reasonable.  
---
Quick question. If the killers camping why arent you guys doing gens and forcing him into action?
---
Yeah never again. I always forget to use it for some reason. Whereas I remember to go to higher ground during chase to proc balanced landing.
---
Jesus lol
---
he is extremely boring. and most of them are rlly sweaty ive found. slugging at 5 gens for a 4k. :/

Guess it's to tease the killer
---
Well....2 obsession perks = twice the chance of you being the obsession.
---
What does she say at the beginning? I can‚Äôt understand it, lmao
---
That happened to me on PS4 once as Feng. I just sorta let the killer get a free kill, it was impossible to do anything. Let me laugh a little, then I went on to a new match and the issue disappeared.
---
I‚Äôve literally even had two people stack the offering that creates more distance between hooks and we all get camped and downed. The offering should only apply to survivors. Also killers shouldn‚Äôt be able to just DC &amp; make you lose offerings.
---
I don't think it's toxic, but you should see how angry killers get at me for popping gens or daring to loop them.
---
Let's be real, if you went and found killer they would down you anyway.
---
I don't play this game much but I hopped into a match with my friend. He was the Meg and I was the Ash. We were dying laughing and decided to let him get hits in so it wouldn't be a waste. Made my day gg.
---
That's some heavy sarcasm around the "no counterplay", except no one can actually come up with any actual evidence to the opposite.
---
inb4 just juke him
---
but it lit up after the last gen popped
---
Today i played nurse with mori. Its funny you know, the first second the survivors live and expect nothing and BOOM terrorradius 100 and youre instantly knocked down because HEX:Devour Ass
---
Next thing you know is that nurse is petting you
---
As far as i see it, this change will allow them to see what people think about legion when people play him as intended, Then nerf/buff his aspects when needed. I do think the speed change was stupid, but the terror radius system and whiff system were needed nerfs to add counterplay and not allow the toxic methods most people use.
---
Do people actually do that? You're going to look like an absolute quag if anybody finds out it's actually your content, and it's not exactly hard to figure out. If you're self promoting, just own it.
---
in the upcoming patch, 3-1 man games are going to be cancelled out and quit. i heard at least
---
Ok? It was nerfed not removed from the game, and there are others ways to further increase repair speed.
---
But yeah I‚Äôd rather not continue talking with you if it‚Äôs all the same.
---
tfw you think you have dead hard but you don't
---
People shit on immersive players but played right and you save pallets and time. Gen almost done? Killer will spend a good chunk of time finding that hidden player so they don't complete the gen.
---
Problem is immersive players play for themselves and not the team. Pull the guy off hook? Take heat. Sometimes the killer doesn't care and tunnels anyways but taking that heat will help other teammates live. If teammates tried playing stealthy less people would be hooked. Also not really fun.
---
But then the loopers cry that they died because of their stealthy teammate. Try not purposely taking heat for no team reason? If everybody is healthy, play stealthy is my motto.
---
In terms of gameplay no. Its the goal of survivors to counterplay to complete gens and avoid chases when possible, but to also prolong chases as long as they can and then win them if they can manage. In terms of blood points, absolutely in my opinion. As a survivor, you can spend a fair bit doing a gen for about 1250 blood points (assuming you didn't get chased away at all) but in that time, you could've gotten plenty of points across multiple categories as a killer
---
Weapon, body, head.
---
You reposted this a day too early my dud
---
It's definitely worth a discussion, whether you should further incentive staying or punish DCing.
---
I'm against punishing DCing because this was actually tried in the past, and the killers weaponized and purposefully would DC survivors from games when they felt slighted.
---
All of that is beside the point that the person I was replying to is out of their mind, and just making up random shit that wasn't said in this thread.

---
Ew. That is terrible sportsmanship.
---
In an indirect way immersed urban evading Claudettes and WGLF stacking Neas are sometimes more effective at killing you than the actual Killer.
---
Sounds like you need to work on map pressure and chases, you said all your downs and hooks happened after the gates were powered which means you lost chases and survivors healed.

The devs have said they will not ban for custom icon/portrait packs. However they also said that if EAC is picking up on it and flags you, they won‚Äôt help you out.

So basically not bannable by devs. But if it screws something up, you‚Äôre SOL. So it‚Äôs still a matter of using at your own risk.

That said, loads of streamers have been using these packs for months. Nothing bad has happened.

I think windows 7 is not the problem, and going on windows 10 will probably not make a difference. I'm on windows 10, and game still have infinite loading after 10 games or 3+ hours of playtime. It really sucks though, intentional player DC's cannot be fixed cause if people are toxic, they will DC no matter what. But at least the devs should fix the things that can be fixed, like the infinite loading bug.

1) pips don't matter, winning does and you don't want to have a short game either, play normally and try to stall gens and kill everyone before 5 gens are done, it's not difficult
---
2) VC doesn't protect from a good killer
---
3) You shouldn't run team perks unless you're playing solo and even then most of them are useless
---
4) is a non-factor 90% of the time and BT can be countered on everyone with insidious, unless the lullabies work as TR in those cases as well.

Is there anything more boring than going against a Billy with Ruin, BBQ and Spirit Fury? If there is I‚Äôve yet to experience it.
---
The other thread is locked. Felt the need to reply to explain.

Shouldn't have to punish myself or punish the remaining survivors because their teammate was a big baby.

i have no idea what it could be but i'm exciteddddd
---
Is it the new cosmetics?!
---
this happened to me as jake
---
as long as it works skks ive been able to just walk out then walk back onto the other side of them and it works
---
Agreed. There are far too many ways for survivors to buy time/have a second chance. And it's amusing how many downvotes I'm getting but no responses as to why. It's hilarious.
---
how, haunted grounds doesn‚Äôt do that
---
Why are there people on here defending people who dc? If youre gonna be a bitch and dc just because its a killer or add ons you dont like, play a different game. Stop ruining the game for everyone else. They seriously need to implement some kind of punishment for dc'ing.
---
I think my words are too bih for you
---
if you end chases pretty quickly with survivors, then you won't get enough points
---
Panic rock, ACTIVATE!
---
Killer DC's are not always intentional. Often when BPS is used Murphy's law has to kick in and my game hard-freezes on the loading screen (says not responding in task manager so I have to kill the process). 
---
I've had this happen pretty often, any match where I'm killer and I DC before it starts, it's because my game froze/crashed. I never intentionally DC as killer aside from maybe one or twice. (Once because I got CornWorld like the 6th time in a row and I was in a shit mood) I'd especially never do it when BPS are used. 
---
That's why I think many of the instances where BPS are used and the game doesn't even get to start, it's because the Killer's game froze, not because he was thinking "Hah I'm gonna be a dick and DC" 
---
Personally I can't wait for the update coming soon when matches will be completely cancelled and offerings refunded if it loads in as a 3v1. Hopefully it will also apply when the killer is DC'd or crashes on the loading screen (and the guy who crashed also gets their offering refunded. I lost quite a bit of Ebony Mori's, BPS, and Jigsaw pieces that way as Doc)
---
Ok dude
---
Fair points for sure.  We‚Äôll see how it looks it looks in game.  I‚Äôm okay with it not being shiny - the better to keep hidden!
---
doing well in chases isnt what gets you chaser, hitting survivors gets you chaser. playing hillbilly, leatherface, and micheal gets you less hits because you instadown, which makes chaser impossible. It takes 20 hits to get irredessant, therefore you have to lose chases so survivors can heal for extra chaser. It's incredibly dumb how winning chases loses chaser.
---
There is a possibility the addons could change the playstyle, possibly adding on the reducing deep wound with subsequent hits on a purple addon. 
---
Base power though will depend on how good you can mindgame without powers. If you are good at it, then you are basically going against a team of No-mithers. That could cause even more survivor complaints. We will see in the PTB.
---
MoM, BT, DS, Deliverance, unBreakable, Self care, balanced landing are basic meta perks. If your build doesn‚Äôt have some of these you‚Äôre either running a very specific build type or are bored of meta perks. 
---
That being said you should just bring MoM, DS, Deliverance, BT or unBreakable. Killers can counter, it‚Äôs not like they can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt be able to counter these perks.
---
I wouldn't say they're OP, but I'd say they are getting too much control. I know the game shouldn't be fun as a survivor, it should be tense and scary, but there should still be a level of enjoyment. It feels like with every patch they try and stifle that enjoyment more and more.
---
Aw wraith
---
That‚Äôs the spirit!
---
Exactly. Knockout and Franklins demise are very useful.
---
This is special. I applaud your choices. In fact if it was me I'd have let you go.
---
&gt; Some people also dislike playing against Spirit because there is no real getting away against here once you are injured.
---
They're probably using self care instead of iron will.

I don't think you understood me considering you just named seven perks...never mind.

A really fishy "bug", since it does help you to find it faster in terms of visual from really far away.

Smash invitation letter I think?

Thing is that you don't know what that survivor was seeing lol. Maybe they got hit 3 seconds through a windos lol.

its that hex totems always lasts one minute
---
Trapper main since the dark times of dbd my go to add one are tar bottle and satchel, my build is noed, blood Warden, brutal strength and ruin. Best tips I can give are trapping a loop in a predictable spot is effective in terms of if they are being chased but out of chase it gets disarmed so make sure to mix up trapping predictably and then throw some spicy spots (comes with practice) and secondly if you have an important window that funnels people in don't be afraid to have a trap protecting a trap, most will disable one and fall for the second.
---
that a baby meg
---
No I understand. You said you can‚Äôt know what the killer is gonna do. 
---
That‚Äôs the game, that‚Äôs why you perk generally strong perks that help in more than one situations. 
---
That‚Äôs why I told him if he was getting tunneled a lot he should bring DS. Now that might mean the killer won‚Äôt tunnel you, so there. Now you‚Äôre not getting tunneled. 
---
Told him. If his teammates are getting camped a lot that he should bring BT. Boom, teammates can‚Äôt get camped now. 
---
You don‚Äôt get to just completely counter the killers. You have to bring perks and risk not being able to use them. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll see at the higher ranks run MoM, DS, Deliverance, BT, Self care, balanced landing. Cause they‚Äôre all generally strong perks against any killers and play styles. 
---
You don‚Äôt get the best of both worlds. There are counters to killers and their tactics but they can counter you too
---
Thats when crack your knuckles and break out the ebony mori and the noed
---
Oof
---
Similar story here:
---
One game on Haddonfield, an Immersed Claudette^TM had the worst luck. Hooked twice very quickly, just kept running into her. At one point, I threw a hatchet at a Meg, missed... it then struck that Claudette hiding in the nearby bush, I had no idea she had been in there.
---
I decided to keep going after the meg and let that poor claudette have another chance.
---
