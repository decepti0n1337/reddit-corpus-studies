I feel this. I'm a survivor main but when I get bored I enjoy playing killer.  My rank BARELY hit 15 and its shitty as fuck. Earlier I missed my hatchet throws and every single time this group of SWF would proceed to tbag and flashlight click. Like thanks. Because I'm not already frustrated that I can't hit you. And then they would all trade off hits and I was so overwhelmed.  I hate being such a baby killer because it constantly means you're gonna get bullied. Very rarely do I have extremely smooth games with nice survivors. Normally I even let the last person go if I can manage to kill the other three. So its heart breaking when they talk shit afterwards because you literally carried them to hatch.

Thank you for saving all the Dwights

Bit of an exhaggeration, they are very very transparent and engaged with their playerbase, they are progressive but their product was built on very very old and simple foundations, their updates and content releases are very frequent too so of course bugs are going tk be common, but any game breaking bugs are deslt with within 24hrs usually.

I respect and understand your statement but being critical i have to outright disagree completely.

With windows 10 at any point you can use Function+G and bring up an overlay that has volume control for every active process, so if youre in discord and your dickhead friends or your playlist gets 10x louder than it was you can fix it in game in 2 seconds.

I love this, thank you :3

Wtf? I bought time for my dumbass teammate yet he taps hook for what reason? I already popped two gens AND looped the killer yet he was just standing there

David stared at Dwight with a slightly aggravated expression. The geeky pizza boy was rapidly turning his flashlight on and off, giggling like a little schoolgirl. 
---
"Wot you doin', mate?" David whispered fiercely. "You wanna get caught?"
---
"Sorry," Dwight said, his eyes wet from laughing. "I just like the noise it makes." 
---
"Bit odd, aren't ya?" David crouched beside a tree, scanning the dark environment. "Think the ol' 'un huntin' us didn't take no notice." He turned and gave Dwight a scowl. "But that don't give you no 'scuse to act the part of a fool."
---
"Sorry," Dwight said with a shrug. "But, uh, speaking of acting like a fool, why aren't you wearing a shirt?"
---
"Don't got none right now," David muttered. "Always takin' hints for you useless hogs, aren't I? Thing's too bloody ripped to pieces." 
---
"Oh," Dwight said in a small voice. "Yeah, right." He crouched down beside his hunky friend. "Thanks, by the way."
---
"For wot?"
---
"For being my friend."
---
There was an awkward silence, then David grunted. "Come on, mate. Let's get some work done."
---
Hey don‚Äôt kinkshame people
---
Watch your fucking language, cutie.
---
See above. Sometimes you have bad teammates. Sometimes you have unwinnable situations. Sometimes you‚Äôre just outplayed.
---
Real talk, if you can‚Äôt have games like that without getting this tilted, maybe this game isn‚Äôt for you.
---
Empathy is worth considering, you can keep track of the killer based on where people get injured.
---
And we're to know this how? You gave no context.

How bad do you have to be at killer for this to actually ever happen?
---
Patrick Bateman and Paul Allen
---
Yeah that's why I ignore the msg before the match. I once had my settings so that non friends couldn't msg me and the killer had the nerve to send friend request. I never t bag but once I escaped I t bagged the shit out of that farmer. I hope they were salty lol
---
Aww, this makes me happy &lt;3
---
If you can wiggle in real close and lunge, the autoaim angle is much more narrow than a normal M1 attack. You might be able to get a hit in.
---
Theoretically.
---
Is this what it's like to have schizophrenia?
---
Holyyy thats scary tbh
---
Lmao I‚Äôve had this game for two years and have never seen this level of stupidity. Idc ab winning I just want to have fun. Having this happen to me after waiting for forever isn‚Äôt fun. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a facecamper with Bubba based off your responses

I think theres a vr chat room that actually is dbd.

I got that challenge on swamp with hillbilly, no ruin no agitation no iron grasp no noed

it just sort of worked out perfectly with every time i downed someone it was close to the basement and no one dcd.

Had 1 guy left looking for hatch and as i checked close to basement for hatch, i found him. Truly blessed

Glad you got that challenge done mate !

Please give us a silent hill chapter with pyramid head as the killer and james sunderland as the survivor. I would die happy &lt;3

Play with friends you can rely on, then. When you play with randoms, expect that some of them aren‚Äôt going to be as good as you, and they aren‚Äôt always gonna know what play you‚Äôre going for. That‚Äôs part of playing online games.

How did u only just get notified that she had devour but got moried anyway? Did she bring a mori?
---
Oof. I see posts like this and get sad because I'm the kinda person that likes to help the killer. Challenges can be infuriating and even impossible sometimes so I don't mind giving them a hand. That being said I think it's pretty pathetic how some will literally ask for help yet won't be willing to help you. That just makes it not fair. But some matches can be okay. My favorite was this hillbilly who needed help (and so did one of my friends.) He helped us, we helped him. Then he ran to the side of the map and messaged us saying that we can all play legit now and honestly it was fun as hell. Not only did we finish what we needed, we actually played the game.

I always felt like I had a harder time tracking people as Demo.

Holy hell, this is beautiful and wholesome. Thank you! Would it be alright to make it into a small comic if I have the time to? I'll credit the story back to you!
---
Where else would I go? You‚Äôre a garbage killer. Please grow up you 14-year old.
---
So just for science, a scenario where a person is unhooked in the basement and the killer greets them on the stairs. 
---
What is that classified as?
---
Immersed Gen Jockey
---
Skitzonophria
---
Well yeah of course, killers aren't supposed to be strong only the survivors are.
---
Got you to waste time crying about it on reddit tho. As well as post game. Now I'm gonna go leave and have fun. Bye shitter!

these are actually decent changes.

I take it you are a killer main who cant win without having the game play itself then huh

Oh. Sorry.

No i just thought it was funny
---
Trying to read this gave me a brain aneurysm, thanks for that
---
I walk slow only when waiting for friends to catch up.
---
The idea of them working on literally anything but fixing the jenk ass servers that make the game unplayable really infuriates me
---
This is the biggest line of bullshit used to defend the piss ass dev team.  Profit &gt; Bug fixes.    Like nearly all businesses.  The team that makes them the most money will receive the most resources. As long as the idiots keep pony up $10 a skin every time one drops, they will add more and more people to the cosmetic team, and less priority to the rest.
---
Tbh I get tunneled often but when I'm not I become the immersed gen Jockey

If you've played for more than a year and are genuinely still struggling the way you stated in the comment I replied to, I think it's time to consider playing a different video game.

If they did this it would be cool if they did similar changes for keys. The problem with them is that you can have an intense, close game, and then survivors get an easy escape with a key or killers get an easy kill with a mori and it feels like you‚Äôve been cheated.
---
BRUH

Yes we are

Yikes. That was loud.

I was facing a Trapper on Preschool. One person DC'ed as soon as they got picked up. The Trapper saw me and my friend and just shook his head at us. He let us farm bloodpoints off of him, and we let him farm bloodpoints off of us. Eventually, we led him to the last guy that ran away from the killer. The killer Moried the last guy, let us finish the last 2 gens, we farmed each other some more at the gate. We waved goodbye to each other, let him hit us one more time, and walked through the exit gate.
---

---
I have 2 favorite "camping" methods.
---
The first is when a team comes to 3 main retrieve anyone on a hook, so I just leave the area a bit and wait for them to run in so I can get another down.
---
The second is when all gens are powered and they have had ample time to open exit gates, and someone is on the hook. So I hang out and wait for them to come make the rescue attempt. Like- I know exactly where they're going to be, and have no other possible objectives- where the fuck else would I go?
---
So they can then allocate resources to the bug fixing team. It takes time to fix bugs
---
Thanks ReelGeist, super neat input. I can tell by your -11 account karma and almost entirely antagonistic comment history that you‚Äôre not a troll account at all so I look forward to many thoughtful, meaningful conversations with you in this sub.
---
Do whatever you want :D 
---
If you get triggered by someone pressing the crouch button and their intention is to get you to chase them/get you riled up, more power to them: they're ensuring an easy win if you focus all your time on one survivor.
---
Personally i find it stupid to get worked up over stuff like that.
---
Clown really? He‚Äôs not so bad.
---
I can see your point though. No matter how high I go I‚Äôm always paired with green rank survivors and killers. All killers have to do is bring Ruin to buy them enough time to hard camp/tunnel survivors out of the game.
---
Thats it. Killer is so braindead for the majority of players. At least with matchmaking the way it is. Unless you play swf its garbage.

Are there any console survivors at rank 8-12? I'm trying to play casual Killer builds and I keep getting matched with rank 2-4 competitives. It seems like there is no chance of ever getting green or purple ranked survivors
---
Oh godüíÄ
---
I won‚Äôt leave the game the majority of the community are very nice and the game is extremely fun to play. It‚Äôs people like you sweating your ass off to annoy players who like to play casually. Honestly people like you drive others away from the game.

I love this.

People who play only one side would never understand

That's what is available closest to your rank at the time of matchmaking
---
I think I can be a big ol jerk but I'm glad you think so
---
The only times I don't attempt to help are when the killer is camping or have NoED and I didn't cleanse totems.
---
 Yeah, I understand BL to some degree  (before nerf) on maps like the game and all and people have always been bothered by DS, but I mean, at least in my experience, both BL and DS are just a few extra seconds added onto a chase. I've never lost a chase because of either of these perks which is why I'm confused that so many killers were raging over it. 
---
I guess if you're not very good at map presence, you run ruin then? I guess it makes sense but I've never needed it, I always felt it was a wasted slot but I see everyone raving about it. I don't know :/
---
‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong I can feel it.‚Äù

You‚Äôre like Hitler, but atleast Hitler cared about Germany or something
---
Take my upvote you handsome devil.
---
Finally someone who doesn‚Äôt get pissed because of a joke
---
It's sad that after 3 years they still don't know how to create balanced maps. Horrible maps for killers like Sanctum of Wrath or horrible maps for survivors like Hawkins. There's no hope.
---
Well good luck dude, hope they show up :)
---
Wait, that's illegal, Bloody Nancy
---
Shhhhhhhhh
---
Question about the Adept achievements due to conflicting info: Can you bring add-ons/items and offerings? And do you have to double pip?
---
I've been working on getting Adept achievements for both killers and survivors, and have been doing them naked (aside from the requisite perks). I googled if you can at least search chests, and found posts from 1-2 years ago saying you can bring anything you want as long as you use only the 3 perks needed.
---
But I could *swear* that I've escaped as a survivor while using the 3 perks plus an item, and didn't get the achievement (to be fair, that was months ago, and i don't remember if I escaped via the door or the hatch)
---
Bill has two meta perks which I for sure recommend you having. They‚Äôre pretty great perks.
---
Using the add on that arms a trap every 30 seconds kind of does that, but look how often the traps spawn out in the open or in an area where nobody will go. Only once have I caught a survivor in a trap I didn't set. Admittedly I don't play trapper much since i find his set up time annoying.
---
I'd recommend Bill then, as you pretty much have every "meta" teachable other than Bill's as far as I would be concerned.
---
Fighting Freddy be like
---
BL in its last state enable infinites on a lot of maps. Only reason  you wouldn't have suffered from it was either the survivors weren't that good and didn't even know about those infinites or how to run them or you, consciously or subconsciously, never took chases that enabled them to use those loops.
---
Do it give it to me baby
---
Thanks a lot! Great icon btw.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Imagine committing to a chase long enough to get chased for 5 gens. Like do people's brains forget that there is the rest of the game going on?
---
it was posted there you monkey
---
It does. Watch fungoose on YouTube /twitch, he's been using PWYF on Bubba for a while (he considers it mandatory), and using his power consumes a PWYF token.

Perk: Well It Was One of Yas
---
When a generator is completed by two or more survivors, one survivor will have the exposed status effect for 10/15/20 seconds.
---
Well they were close to the stairs when the unhook took place so

middle ground? So basically going back before notification

You are a naive individual.   Why would they do that?  Take a voluntary reduction in profit now so they can thrive later?   What kind of backwards ass thinking is that?  Next quarter is the most important...better make sure we meet the quota.
---
I still get splinters and own all the licensed killers.
---
Yesterday I shared my own idea for a scarecrow killer "The Husk". I like your idea too! My idea does involve crows (Murder) but also uses another power where other scarecrow husks are strewn about the map and can swap yourself between them, giving you to needed map pressure. Check it out!
---
Looter is literally me when I didn't knew taht keys and insta heals were actually good items
---
Yeah sometimes he can be a bit aggressive. Like in the latest video he was like you fucking slut and what a bitch. Like calm down that‚Äôs unnecessary as a streamer and unfun to watch tbh love otz tho
---
Yeah it's the same this as totems/hook failed skillcheck (including healing skillchecks) explosion thing. Hearing that sound/visual go off 10 times or more in a row is pretty annoying when you're trying to keep a level head throughout the match, as playing killer can get pretty stressful. 
---
Now you know more about the game mechanics, I hope it helps you in the future as you continue to play.

I get pissed at getting juked because it‚Äôs almost always preceded by my frames dropping to PowerPoint slides. I guess that‚Äôs just console life.
---
To get either.

All survivors know these days are iPhone, hot chip, and medkit
---
We don't say this when rank 20 survivors do something toxic, she was toxic and that is that.
---
Just ur actual nickname if you have one. I just put my first name since i dont have one. Theyll ask you for your username in an email youll get it you win
---
This just happened to me. Had 3 basement sacrifices. Then the last guy dc‚Äôd right before I hooked him.
---
I should of been more clear on what i meant by smart. I was not referring to this instance. I was referring to when you outplay the killer and you see hate threads about a perk being broken and what not.

You can use whatever items, addons, and offerings you want. Survivors have to escape through the door, and unfortunately killers have to double pip :/

Whats the point of using premonition if you aren't using sound.

How is "sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement in one trial" easy?

All you have to do is finish a gen, not do a gen from 0-100 and you can co-op it

Yessir, all of my memes are made in VRChat

Then being a part of the bitter minority must be especially rough for you to come to grips with. I'm sorry it took such a low effort shit post comment thread for you to realize it, must be rough...

As long as you give me hatch uwu

Because the subreddit is filled with killer mains who play victim.

What is that subreddit üíÄüíÄ

Agitation, Iron Grasp, Monstrous Shrine, Mad Grit, and Bubba or Billy

Made in VRChat, there's two worlds with DBD related stuff in them.

Do you also have problems exiting fast on console? One of the reasons I don't use Head On. The fast button seems register half of the time.

Level 18 killer here, just played against a match full of purple ranks and it sucked ass

You have to be hiding in a locker for a certain amount of time before you can jump out.

---
This one is actually reasonable given the information we know about the system since you are all are within 6 of the killer with the exception of the rank 5 who may have just ranked up from the match.
---
I was talking about how the game is fun, in part because like other semi-competitive games, you can take joy in seeing yourself improve. Skill checks are just a part of that. No need to be rude.
---
I have to disagree with point 6. It's an interesting and interactive gameplay element that heightens the skill cap even if just a little.
---
Yeah I love him too, but you hear him say "you dumb bitch" 24/7 which is a little extreme.
---
That‚Äôs lizzo üò®

No need for an apology mate, other than calling me an ass sweater, neither of us made any mention of my skill in either of our comments. But you don't seem to be replying to what I've written, but rather have chosen to put words in my mouth, insult me, and claim the high road at the same time. I know my words aren't going to sway an intellectual giant like yourself, and I can tell by your responses up to this point that you don't actually want to get better, and would rather just blame your being a sub-par killer  on"them pussies at BHVR", so I'll just concede and let you take your "W". Good luck in the mist!

definitely not an anime. the girl and the clothing of the guy is way too detailed to be one.

Im going to get downvoted for this, but why tf do people like pig so much?
---
Yes she is super adorable, and her voice is amazing.
---
but jesus fuck every red rank pig player i run into is just the biggest ass hole. Like its been so long since i have ran into a pig that hasnt tunneled at least one person to death. 
---
they are actual cunts, and the fact that people respect them like a cult is just weird.
---
Ok so it can be explained by the games matching mechanics but that doesn‚Äôt mean the mechanics are good. There is a big difference between a rank 6 and rank 12 and the difference gets even higher as both sides get closer to rank 1
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and only play killer for the tome challenges and sometimes daily rituals.  Honestly I don‚Äôt enjoy playing killer and I don‚Äôt care if they escape. But I get the exact same messages with survivors bragging how great they are at looping and saying ez baby killer. But when they die they rage and accuse you of camping, tunneling and make up a bunch of rules that don‚Äôt exist. 
---
Seriously tired of these survivors complaining when it doesn‚Äôt go their way. If you don‚Äôt want Noed, run small game and do all the totems. If I hook you and you‚Äôre next to an open gate It would be extremely dumb of me to leave.
---
Actual discussion in my DBD sub?! What the hell?!
---
And I wasn't around for old Freddy but I also agree this rework Freddy is boring as hell. If I want to farm some points and win a match with relative ease, I'm going Freddy. Sure, some teams surprise me and 2 or 3 escape but usually they're all on death hook by then.
---
Guy is definitely powerful, but fun?? Eh, not to play and so-so to go up against.
---
Remember Avengers: Infinity Mend?
---
tacking on fungoose, who is an educational dbd streamer. He talks through his decisions and why he does certain things, hes a good looper but he doesnt specifically try to get killers attention just to get into a chase.
---
We need more heroes like you.
---
That was some bugs bunny looney tunes shit man, gg
---
6 ranks is exactly how it was designed to be. Cry less
---
I'm not sure about that because I did it almost instantly a few times just never consistent enough.
---
I'll just have to try that.
---
Read the perk description.
---
Ormond is one of my favorite maps what‚Äôs wrong with it? Haddonfield and badham preschool are personally my least favorites.
---
Oh look both running urbam evasion too

No, I mean for getting out of lockers. I know how Head On works. I have trouble fast exiting lockers consistently.

Dwight. His innocence can disguise him as a noob or toxic play. Also that elf outfit is freaking awesome I‚Äôll wear that all year.
---
Agree...by the time you T3 twice, it gets tough.  Normally (not a killer main), I use the 4 best perks I have and honestly they handout Noed like candy.
---
Cleans the totums...only need to do 1 each + 1
---
Sounds like a survivor main lmao.
---
You also see moments where you can tell he's genuinely pissed off, but then he'll act like he was kidding and tries to act wholesome again.
---
Never thought I‚Äôd see Britney here. FUCKIN TAKE MY UPVOTE!!!!!!!!! Love this song.

Idk how balanced it'd be, but that sounds def interesting

This gives me an idea....I think I‚Äôll start playing Claud more but also put the dark clothes on her.....yes..time to strike fear into the killers..
---
DS and Barrowed...problem solved :)
---
ah ok, thanks!
---
No I play a clean game, but you guys all come on here and keep saying boop the snoot and then on PS4 solo survivor I do that and then proceed to get tunneled and camped. So I quit doing it, not trying to be a dick with my previous post, but come on let‚Äôs be real there may be a handful of pig mains on PS4 who are cool like this but the rest are toxic assholes.
---
This is perfect and needs to be implemented
---
As a Laurie main I can assure you I have no clue how to loop, just don‚Äôt look at me and I won‚Äôt be toxic üëç
---
This post isn't labelled as "All the perks in the game and what I think of them" though
---
Good luck on tracking down those who dare dislike a feature! It‚Äôs clear to me that you have lack the necessary requirements to understand that people have a different a opinion that you may not agree with. And you claim that I put words into other people‚Äôs mouth when you say that I dislike those at BHVR even though it is clearly the toxic side of the community who abuse flashlights to blame for my hatred of the flashlight. Anyway be careful there are people with opinions those guys are really scary

Will be added into the store but probably not for a very long time

other streamers don‚Äôt do at all however it‚Äôs still annoying to hear.  A lot of dbd content creators tend to poke fun at or demean the people in their games so i‚Äôve gotten used to it. Sucks that people in their games could be fans and are subjected to it. Overall the game just embraces toxicity.

yeah me too mate

Agree...its so inconstant
---
This is factually incorrect.
---
As a person who walks fast you are more likely to be angry and irritated because slow-moving morons like to walk in herds that block entire paths, or spread in a straight line while they dawdle.
---
At least if you had $10 you could perpetually make your money back and buy the next one.
---
Bruh I was the survivor. I feel bad for the killer and if no one says anything then nothing is changed
---
Yes thanks for one piece of anectdotal evidence
---
I play this game while listening to an audiobook. You need take spine-chill and turn up your speakers speakers to do this. The only downside is that your skill checks will suffer because your ears are elsewhere üîäüìñ
---
I think it's just him trying to let it go right away but it can come off as phony depending on the timing and tone.
---
I think more streamers should be like Otz. He answers a lot of questions, even ones without donations and bits and gets angry sometimes and have a good laugh other times.
---
However, I think it's some of his fans that have warped his self-image a bit, kind of like the Internet and Keanu Reeves. Hearing how great and wholesome you are all the damn time is likely to put pressure on a person. 
---
I think Otz should play more survivor or branch out to more games or do more experiments or really whatever he wants without letting people's perception of him get in his head too much. 
---
He seems like a very humble guy, but I think being able to say "Guys, I'm pissed off right now and don't feel like playing" or something to that extent, whenever he feels that way is better than always trying to push away his negative outbursts because clearly that isn't working.
---
But idk the guy, maybe he is just a bit hot-headed in real life and this behavior his just how he games.

It hurts more when you‚Äôre playing in red ranks.

Because of more entrances you wouldn't have to waste more valuable hooks as often because you wouldn't have to waste as much time getting to the basement, and it would also further Insidious, Bubba, and Insidious Bubba into obsolesce forcing bhvr to finally make the perk have some kind of substance and maybe do something to Bubba to make him a viable pick compared to Billy
---
Insidoc best Doc.
---
I'm guessing they bullied the fuck out of that killer.
---
Survivor had to get nerfed every patch because they used to be the actual power role. Actual infinite loops, 8 second self cares, instant blind flashlights, and a 20 second sprint burst cool down just to name a few. Funny thing is? Despite those nerfs they arguably still are. The only survivors who have a right to complain about anything survivor related are people who play solo 24/7. If you play SWF, you have nothing to complain about. 
---
Also. Nurse is still strong. Nobody is arguing that. She just feels about as fun to play as shitting in your underwear. The bitch is clunky and not worth it anymore. I feel like she should only have recharging blinks during a chase, because her map traversal fees like pulling teeth. Or is game feel not important for the killer side?
---
He seems like a good, humble guy and I'm glad he's found success. I just hope he doesn't like fall apart or become one of those hated streamers. Because there's a lot of people who don't like him or think his fans are annoying.
---

Yea it‚Äôs bound to happen, nobody is perfect and we all lash out a bit, doesn‚Äôt make it alright but yea.
---
They probably bullied the shit out of this Hag.
---
Seems pretty good, maybe less time seeing g survivors on the bloodlust one, but still good.
---
the Susie you draw is so adorable
---
Horrific Machinations is too similar to Infectious Fright, and Already Gone is too similar to Distortion imo
---
It's not hate they're trolls. They want to get on your nerves
---
There is a way to get out of it... if a survivor helps. Did this with a trapper who was helping me get my flashlight blinds last night
---
&gt;That said, i also dislike Otz 
---
I don't hate him and I don't dislike him. I've never even seen him play the game nor do I care to. I don't watch any of these trash ass streamers because they all drank or play on alternate accounts that are all low level just to shit on people who are clearly bad at the game. There's no fun in watching people get shit on and there's no fun in watching sweaty ass matches yet alone playing them. The new ranking reset system means I'm permanently stuck in red ranks now even if I don't want to be. 
---
I only know of him and the perks that he uses it because of these weak minded sheeple that make ridiculous memes of him. Similar to this thread in general.
---
Yea. I guess but in a way I see it as similar perks for slightly different things sorta like Enduring and Brutal Strength ish if you get what I‚Äôm try to say.
---
I'm sorry :( Hope you have better games in the future and come back again to play Killer
---
:(
---
Piqued
---
Imagine complaining about clown
---
Myers is slow at first then the same speed as other killers later this means he is happy until he sees to many toxic SWF
---
You shouldn‚Äôt even bother wasting your time with people like this. On console, they go out of their way when you have your messages on private. They literally send a friend request just to shit on you. It‚Äôs so pathetic. I had this French guy msg me while i had my PMs available, i then deleted his chat without replying and switched my pms to private (Friends only) then i played with him again and he sent me a friend request just to shit on me again. Is that considered harassment? Coz i wish at the time i reported him for it.
---
If the killer is playing fair and I can figure out what they're trying to do I'll usually pop myself near the basement when I have enough points.
---
Gotta remember as survivor if we see basement play our instinct is to go anywhere else but near the basement... its just instinct.
---
So long as David isn't dead.

But he looks dead from up here, on the High Ground.

---
I'm doing this, to become fit and a better player ao I dont have to become fit
---
This. My friends all think I'm great at Survivor when they see me circle a twig around a killer a dozen times before he decides I can't possibly be there and leaves. 
---
In reality it's just because chases usually end up in a wasted pallet, a failed juke and me hooked.
---
See I'll talk to my friends on Discord while playing solo survivor but when I play killer I mute chat as soon as the match starts. Not that I can hear shit anyway.
---
Source??? I want that ace video but standalone! :O

i own yui from buying her separately, so if i buy the Cursed Legacy DLC at full price, what would happen? would it just be a waste of money?

I'm a rank 3 and went against a rank 14 I was solo and I think there was a group of 2 the others ranks were 3, 6, 9 it was a easy match
---
Console dbd is horrendous
---
This is terrifying
---
I like the ideas but.....here is my take on it.
---
Blood Oath should give you 4/5/6 seconds of seeing the other survivors and reduce the time that the Obsession can see you down to 5 seconds.
---
Horrific Machinations is a nice perk and all, but no one would run it without being forced too tbh. It is a worse version of another perk that rewards a better alternative, aka Slugging. As you can run slugging perks alongside Infectious Fright if you wanted a quick slugging game. And it is also outclassed by almost every other perk that gives the killer a notification of where a survivor can be. So i feel a complete rework for this would be better than anything else. I do not have any ideas at the moment, so this is up to you.
---
Attention Seeker would be AMAZING BUT.....what would it do if you were not the Obsession? Like what if someone else was running a full build around making themselves it or if the killer was running a build based on making new obsessions. Then what? Also, survivors should still have scratchmarks, as if a survivor makes a mistake by running into you while you were chasing the obsession, then that survivor gets a second chance from a perk that is not theirs, so they get a free escape for no reason, yet they were way outposisioned. One final thing is that it must have a drawback, even if it is just a really small one at that. I think it should deactivate when a killer breaks a pallet, this might be hard to code, as I know very little about coding, but it would make it so that you could stay closer and keep the killer on you as your team does everything or have the choice of getting distance while the killer is now able to see if your team is making mistakes and can get off of you to chase someone weaker.
---
And the last one, Already Gone, does not need to be a perk, as Distortion is that. But this gives me an idea to buff Distortion. Have what Distortion does already and add your perk, Already Gone's effect to it. Then add 2 more tokens. And then I believe people would run this more often in stealth builds. A build you could put this perk in is Lithe, Dance With Me, Iron Will, and the new Distortion instead of Quick and Quiet, as this now gives you protection from giving the killer notifications and letting them see your aura for 5 different times during the match.

Alright your English has now degenerated to incomprehension. I get that you're upset that your meme didn't stick well and that you've been called out multiple for being a poor player. All the projection and toxicity you've shown in these replies tells me you're quite unsettled. Spend less time shit posting on reddit and maybe you'll hit red ranks by 2022
---
Which one gen rushes every game and somehow makes friends with the killer?

This is horrifying

He can run but he can‚Äôt hide.

Little bit too harsh. He is still viable though.

its just a joke..
---
So you admit to not only having no culture, but also being a disgusting pig!!! I thought such lows couldn‚Äôt be met!!!
---
Make Your Choice's visible countdown timer begins the moment a survivor is unhooked when you, the killer, is 32 meters away. A survivor's decisive strike countdown timer begins at the moment they're unhooked.
---
That means that if the killer is using Make Your Choice, they can tell if they are at risk of Decisive Strike just by looking at their Make Your Choice timer. If it's still active, picking up an unhook if you down them again risks a Decisive Strike. If the Make Your Choice counter has run out, however, so has their Decisive Strike counter, and you can pick them up without fear.
---
Especially on the killer who uses lockers the most. Ghostface
---
Basically, he had a 5 second window where he pulled you into his dream realm, and he could only hit/interact with people in the realm. Failing a skill check or having someone else wake you up, or adrenaline, was the only way to get out of it.
---
No iron maiden

Game moderators are able to see endgame chat and DCing specifically to prevent a reward for another player is one of the listed bannable offenses on the report page. It won't really help you get the challenge, but it will help others by reporting them so the people like this are banned and can't do this to others.

Yikes. Although dc penalties wont stop people sadly

Rank 20 survivors, they can't possibly have bullied the Hag then.

Oh yeah, had bond and watched her switch locker to locker and crouch behind debris. Not a single save, gen, or totem for the whole game.

Fr all 3 of the survivors will be around the hook and o stay there they call me camper. Even though I was a survivor main before a couple of days ago, survivors are so entitled and think that killers should abide to there rules (even I thought this too)

Whups thought that said noed, I now realize that was devour soap
---
I'm loving these comics.
---
It‚Äôs cool bro
---
"Territorial" doesn't mean "camp one spot on the map for the whole game". walk around, chase survivors, you don't have to set up every trap in the first 5 seconds - that's a good way to get genrushed.
---
That was a direct quote from the guy I was initially responding to, he said wrote it like a day ago in this same thread. I was using it ironically because it's exactly what he's been doing to me and everyone else his shit post.
---
I believe it was said that all outfits in the Rift will be added to the store a few months after it ends, for individual prices instead of the price of the Rift pass.
---
The Rift pass is 1000 auric cells, and the Jake outfit is completed at level 22. 
---
If it was in the store, the price for green rarity outfit is 675 usually Auric Cells for 3 items.
---
Make your own choice, I'd suggest getting the pass because you'd get other outfits besides just the Jake one (depending on your level)

I'm on console. I do 2-3 gens, am ontop of ruin, and am 50/50 on hook saves. I dont even mess with campers. My looping isbgetting better, I've got a half a gen to a gen in me in a chase (assuming my team is working on gens). 
---
Though I usually only run spine chill, urban evasion, lithe, and self care. Dunno if that affects it?

No, it‚Äôs not. Deranking, last I heard of, is not bannable

I love this
---
No I don‚Äôt think it is. He‚Äôs not technically holding the game hostage because survivors are free to continue playing as usual. They aren‚Äôt hacking or lagswitching.
---
The thing is, you can‚Äôt prove if someone is purposefully deranking. It‚Äôs a dick thing to do, since you‚Äôre essentially bullying lower level survivors or killers, but not bannable

It's because of survivors like that I spent about a week face camping with Bubba until I got all 4 faces. Salty, salty tears.
---
Say bye bye to your fingers :D
---
If you got genrushed AND all the totems were cleansed, you made too many mistakes or you have a bad build. 
---
Except for 2000 hour SWF groups, Survivors who want to genrush wont bother with totems. you can always get the hex when it spawns.
---
It‚Äôs okay you can learn all that stuff online now!

People who fall through the map still have collision, basement bug looked normal to everyone but the survivor.
---
Deranking seems pretty boring. There is a steep learning curve which means you can really outclass lower ranked players. They‚Äôll probably end up about where they belong at the end of the day. Until then, oh well. Getting stomped sometimes is part of the game and can teach you how to be better.
---
I‚Äôm doing situps for the rest of my life
---
Yeah. I always feel bad for the guy getting unhooked when it's not safe. I can imagine he's telling "noooo" at his monitor as it's happening.
---
Nice one dude
---
"oh no please don't nerf-" *slap*
---
Playing killer has never been more balanced in the entire history of dbd. If a killer gets a "nerf" it was either needed or it was a bug fix.
---
It's a 50/50 for me. I boop and get tunneled and left to bleed out on the floor. Or I boop and we make sexy bloodpoints together. I laugh tho when I boop the pig and I'm working on a gen with someone who doesn't know about booping and they are just so confused and to why pig just stands there, cuts me, let's me self heal, and repeat.
---
It seems u have only tracking perks and no slowdown/chase perks so that can be a reason u only average out 2ks, skill is also a factor but that comes with practice and time. Id really recommend slowdown perks like hex:ruin or corrupt intervention so that gens are pressured and slowed with out you having to do anything. Id also reccomend save the best for last or the spirit fury enduring combo for ending chases faster. Also for gf himself nurses calling is a amazing perk due to u being able to sneak up on anyone healing nearby. My usual gf build is ruin,nurses,stbfl,and whatever perk im feeling usually franklins or discordance.
---
You‚Äôre very talented! Keep it up! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
That one is legit only possible if the survivors help you in red ranks, unless the survivors are boosted.
---
Its possible. Long chases, first hook everyone and all gens done in less than 10 mins. But at this point you're searching for it. Got a depip from a fast 3k though. Also letting them heal a lot reduces your emblems.
---
Lmao, now tell me - i got the game yesterday, WHY would i do that hm? And not only that, it was my first time playing as the trapper, jesus christ. Are you high or some shit?
---
lol
---
i got it first try as billy, ik i got lucky but it really wasnt that hard to play without all the common perks

It's a hard habit to break, keeping a 99'd item. Unfortunately, carrying an item makes you slightly more visible around corners. I only keep items when playing Hoarder Dwight.
---
I know how important it is and I still listen to music.
---
I'm listening to music basically all my waking hours at home, this game isn't going to stop that
---
OP is toxic as hell and can't take feedback- instead blames other people for their mistakes. This really is what the community is like.

Who hurt you today? You need a hug? I was chasing this dude and didnt react to the traps, shit happends lmao
---
When did they add SCP-3002 to Dbd?
---
What rank? I know I would never be caught dead going near the basement with 3 other people already dead/ down there, I would go for the hatch, as would most people at red ranks.
---
Dude told you above and devs announced everything via a YouTube stream last Wednesday, no Xmas event this year BhVR is acting like Scrooge.

He's ahead of his time, clearly.

Again, you guys literally only hurt yourselfs not cleansing. Holding off for a few mins sure but having all for survivors running no mither without the pick up part won't last long
---
We need a set of cosmetics called "The Disturbed" and its just 1 disturbing cosmetic for every killer, like this, like leatherface could have a face that has eyes that cinstantly move, the pig could have a face streacked to a pig head shape, micheal could have his knige have an eye on the end, huntress could have the handle of her axe he an arm, stuff like thay
---
Anchorman reference lol? It depends, if I know all the perks the killer has by the end of the game then I wuld forget about it but otherwise I always 99 the gates anyway. The killer could still open the other gates though however
---
Yes, BUT it's a very well known glitch. and even still, it will only happen to you once because of how specific the requirements are.
---
Yes, which is another reason why OP has no excuse.
---
But you missing the point, how would i be aware of this glitch if i only played a few games since yesterday?ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
*stares in Fixated*
---
Depends on what perks you have unlocked, but I run BBQ, Ruin, Pop, and Whispers.
---
BBQ is like Tremors but IMO better. See people regardless of them being on a gen. Tremors is easy to trick by backing off the gen for the hook, but you can also just hide in a locker for BBQ.
---
Ruin for the obvious. Slow the game down, causes survivors to wander into the open more often.
---
Pop for delaying as well. With Ghostface you don‚Äôt tend to scare players off gens because they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre coming. Pop helps keep important gems down.
---
Whispers to let you know if you‚Äôre wasting your time. Super helpful in the early game to get going, then again at the end when a couple of survivors have died.
---
Nurses calling is good on him since you can sneak right up and get the down.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say Corrupt Intervention on him is good because survivors frequently wait it out while you patrol the open gens. There is no set up for you to do during that time.
---
Plenty of other typically meta perks work fine, but GF is not a top rank killer. I‚Äôve had games that go well and people escape, and I have had games where everyone escapes but I don‚Äôt depip. He‚Äôs a fun killer, but I can‚Äôt pinpoint why he isn‚Äôt strong.
---
You act like I don't get off better to a vanilla spirit.
---
I guess lol. Im just tired of seeing these "Im depressed and I walk slow this is fake" comments.
---
&gt;"are you high or some shit" 
---
Don't talk shit if you can't handle the backlash. You're the one who posted this here looking for attention. I said that this post was either fake or you made a huge mistake, and thanks for clearing that up.
---
NERD
---
I can't believe Trapper still has some bugs even though he's one of the first killers in this game.
---
I never watch any youtube videos, streamers or stuff like that of this game. Im literally supernew to this game, and i never knew about this glitch, until it happend for me.
---
I'm just trying to get to work without being late damn
---
Replace the roles, and haddonfield with "mori" for better effect. Higher rank survivors will just rush gens but other survivors tend to hide in fear

Maybe time to move on to a new game. It doesn‚Äôt sound like it sparks joy.

I drop off presents to teammates when I do that, lol.
---
Hur dur lets push dc penalties when our game is so unstable it literally forcefully boots players out of matches, causes players to get stuck infinitely (trap bug, basement bug), super awful dedicated servers, coding bugs that crash the game, etc. Smart move on Bhvr's end I can't wait for the backlash.

Auto logins? Care to elaborate
---
*laughs in save the best for last*
---
That's hard to even find the original poster though. I've seen this many times with a caption "when you been chasing everyone in their dreams but you forgot to chase your own" or something like that.
---
&gt; A single survivor, if skilled enough, should be able to overpower a killer and buy enough time for gens/ save teammates
---
And this is why Reddit should never balance any game.
---
Look, Leatherface campers are annoying as shit, but the idea that any one out of the four Survivors could be completely untouchable is just laughably unbalanced from any perspective except a salty survivor one, and is a great way to make people not want to play Killer at all, killing the game.
---
Also, you should stop being so condescending. "If there are formatting issues, I don't care" and "I want to know how many people are stupid bots who disagree with me" are, by themselves, going to get people to downvote and move on. Any point you *might* have had is lost simply because of your attitude.
---
I'm starting with DbD„Åæ„Å®„ÇÅ (DbD Collection) #1, and Chibi Wraith doesn't really show up until DbD Collection 8 or so.
---
I'll get there eventually, as long as people still like EIRRIs comics here
---
You have to comb through, but just search for dbd audio files and you will find some links on reddit.
---
Warning that there are thousands of unnamed files.
---
Honestly I would much rather deal with this if it means the ranks in my games looked like that.
---
Sitting at rank 9 on both side, Survivor gets constantly matched with grey/yellow ranks whereas Killer get constant red/purple.
---
Recording? No? Pls?
---
Calling someone psycho for calling out a shitty post, in which the OP both acts toxic and plays the victim at the same time in replies. 
---
Silence, boomer.
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll keep it in mind. Re-reading it, I *did* make him look a bit stupid. Then again, he could also just talk that way just to sound tough, like "I was raised on the street" type tough. But I'll definitely tweak his dialogue a little in future stories.
---
Either you win before noed is ever needed because you managed to stop the gens being done and kill survivors or you don't win and then it's just luck whether or not you still have noed at the end. Doing all the gens and  cleansing all the dull totems are really not mutually exclusive infact they both tend to occur simultaneously. I'm at red ranks as survivor and I have plenty of time to cleanse dull totems for points and do gens. The fact that this is an endgame build with nothing to stall gens or really help until the endgame just makes this even more likely tbh.
---
I know. It was a joke.

---
Lol Boomer, cute. I'm assuming you got that one from an older sibling child. Judging by your past posts, you're clearly just a salty survivor who thought they were gonna get one over on a killer....yet it's backfired and now you look stupid. Cheers
---
Ok if we can have this can we have the Demogorgon rip off heads for mori?
---
This and rank 20 leigons are the best
---
I booped the snoot and some pigs made it their life missions to tunnel and facecamp me.
---
THIS IS ALL A LIE MADE BY PIGS GANG
---
For remember me, I don't believe so. So you could kill them during the game and then down a 2nd survivor if noed is available, then open the exit gates and then hook them. Then you have two other survivors trapped in there with you.
---
200 IQ
---
Idk I just said something random. In all toy story movies the things are like not even a foot tall and move 7 miles by walking in 5 minutes
---
i don't understand this way of trying to get on people's nerves tho.
---
Its like they just use their backup line over and over again even if it doesn't relate to the situation, which is not annoying, its just funny and sad.
---
I try that and then run to the opposite side
---
Im so fucking tired of getting bone splinters
---
It's because you're looking at the worse case scenario. Lol. I ran a similar build to his. You play as normal. The obsession will unhook others or you're run into them naturally. You don't have to focus on them at all really. You hook everyone, obsession included as much as you can. 
---
Obviously, you should try to not sacrifice the Obsession so you can Mori them. Now, the gens pop. You should be in a position to down a survivor. If this is not the obsession, you open the gate yourself if you're close and pop Blood Warden. 
---
If you're far, or it is the obsession, slug and go pressure remaining survivor(s). And with gates spawning like 2 feet away half the time, it shouldn't be hard to find a survivor to chase and down. Down that guy, Remember Me saves the gates from being opened to soon.
---
Now from here, either slug and go open them yourself or wait for the gate to open. Obsession is still slugged or up but doesn't matter. You pop BW and go to town.
---
And in this pic, it's Freddy. One the strongest killers in the game and can end loops. He should be even more lethal at endgame.
---
Not true, I can confirm that playing against red rank survivors and using noed, it isn't there half the time. They cleanse it for easy blood points and if they have perks like inner strength. I'm a red rank survivor and I cleanse any dull totem I see unless I know that the killer doesn't have noed e.g I see ruin on the gens, then see yellow sparks on a kicked gen meaning he has pop and then get mangled status effect so he has sloppy and see the skull meaning he has thana.
---
I hate that this is a fact
---
Wait there is a window in that room ?
---
Op's build could definitely work but this build with rancor has too many opposing goals. If I understand this correctly then with OP's build you want to ideally kill the obsession before the endgame and this will naturally build up remember me stacks. Then you use noed to one shot a survivor and then either open the gates yourself or wait until they do and then hook the survivor.
---
However with the build I was replying to, rancor is used instead of noed. This means that if you kill the obsession as planned before the endgame then what is the point of rancor? And if you keep the obsession alive until the endgame and then mori them then who are you going to hook instead? And if you keep the obession alive until the endgame and then hook them then what is the point of rancor? This also means that the other survivors are not going to be one shot because he is running rancor instead of noed. And yes noed is a gamble but the whole premise of OP's build is a gamble and noed makes that gamble work well where as rancor just contradicts the whole plan.
---
And yeah you could hit your obsession during the game and then use the one shot during the endgame from rancor to easily down the obsession and then hook them but first you would have to find them and then one shot them - after the gens are powered and during this time survivors are either gonna body block the hell out of the obsession while one opens the gate and then they probably all leave. Or by the time you find and down the obsession they will just leave.
---
Interest?
---
Heads up survivors. If I hook your buddy in the basement below the killer shack, running laps around the walls on the outside is the best way to guarantee I never leave. Yes I can hear you out there, you are t fooling me and I if there are 2-3 of you out running laps and 1 in the basement then all 5 of us are in this one spot and I have no incentive to leave cause wherever I go there won‚Äôt be any survivors to find since you‚Äôre all endlessly lapping the shack trying to get me to come outside.
---
Woah dude it‚Äôs almost like you know my life story! Super cool :D
---
Child....please. you lost. Take your toxic ass somewhere else, or don't.... doesn't matter to me, I don't have a bedtime unlike some childrens
---
I really like these. Wraith was the first killer I ever played and he‚Äôs the one I play when I want to just relax.
---
I never thought a brawl stars template would make its way into dbd
---
Or a canadian. Not to mention the guy I'm replying to called me bud and I'm reflecting that.

I could say "learn to read, kid" to roast you on calling me kid for no reason but that would be breaking the "only kids use kid as an insult" rule

Even if you found it, you had to have known it's a stolen post. You can literally see the flair and the upvotes next to the text.

For Killer, the Creeper (but we know why we‚Äôll never get that). 
---
For Survivor, Frank West. He‚Äôs perfect for the world of DBD.
---
Killer or survivor tho?
---
You sure enjoy explaining things, sounds an awful lot like a Boomer if you ask me.
---
Actually just the add-ons had a slight nerf, was a hard nerf to where they are useless.  With the normal forever build of Ruin, PoP, Sloppy, Dying Light + chains and rope its still a worthless 20-30 min match.  Was only a 2-3% speed nerf across the board with the add-ons and perks.
---
Are you watching his stream or Youtube? I notice he talks a lot more shit on survivors who act like over-confident SWF, but I'm not seeing an extreme personality change or anything like that.
---
Dude shut up. Oh my god. You aren't right in this case. It's been pointed out multiple times that you're entirely in the wrong. Learn to not be so salty cause somebody *NEW* didn't know something you DID! People like you are what give a lot of survivors a bad name
---
it can be in that situation. it depends on a lot of things
---
No silly, that's Coldwin Farm
---
Yeah I agree and they shouldn't have to be playing against a high rank killer. Fair enough if it's a swf group playing with their lower rank friend but sometimes it is just random survivors and it happens as killer too. Rank 8 atm and constantly matched with rank 2s
---
If every fountain is corrupted, they all purify themselves and Plague loses the ability to get her power until someone purifies again.
---
I got it with basement trapper burning autohaven offerings. There are two maps that are good for that.
---
Azarovs is probably the best. Setup on the basement side and 3/4gen it.
---
There another map that can have basement shack in the middleish of the map which is also nice. Especially if you have a nice circle of gens around it.
---
Show account names

I know this might be dumb but how do I boop the snoot? Just need to know so I can do it lol.

Just how it is dude. Just gotta not suck or be a salty jerk. It's pretty easy if you try.

Hahaha you're the Killer equivalent of those street performing statues. I love it
---
I'm depressed (not exactly) but suicidal and I walk fast af ! I just can't walk slowly,I don't understand how other people do this.
---
Ah the memories lol.
---
I stuck around at the start and maybe with the release of the nurse but after that I never got to play as or against Michael which kinda sucked. Now it‚Äôs crazy to see how many killers and survivors got added in the game. I‚Äôve been keeping track watching Ohmwrecker but it isn‚Äôt the same experience as playing yourself.
---
Looks great! What mediums are used here?
---
So adorable
---
I promise if BVHR straight up made a scanner that would flagged and reviewed N-Bomb drops, and ban them after three warnings they'd start making more money than DLC. ASSHOLES LOVE THIS GAME they will buy new accounts and fuckin pay in all over again.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a glitch if you didn‚Äôt actually buy the dlc and unlocked with shards.
---
He'd be quite a bit more powerful if he didn't give away his traps and could also cut trapped locations directly while survivors had to go around....
---
There are aspects that should be there, like walking forward after placing a trap, but I think the balance of his traps are something that needs to be kept in mind.
---
Can't help it. My intentions are pure but my banter is spicy.
---
Susie is adorable.

It truly is the laziest, most zero effort form of trolling.

Dwelf

This looked like some alpha prototype at first.
---
I will
---
Ok, it seems like you're assuming a lot of things in these scenarios. For one, 4 survivors aren't guaranteed to be alive because you run endgame builds. If you're solid killer, you can 4k with any perk.
---
It seems like you're coming at this with a lack of confidence and faith in the killer's ability. You can literally use this build with 2 people at the end, hook non-obession after you open gates or the obsession does then activate BW.
---
There's a bunch a ways the build works. And a bunch it fails. You're also assuming NOED is superior here but that perk is easily countered before you're even at mid game. OP can make use of all the perks of the build if they play it right. Adding NOED relies on survivors not doing totems.
---
Merry Christmas. I'm sorry people can suck. :(
---
I‚Äôve just gotten back to playing the game now that I have a computer which can support it. Didn‚Äôt know the dedicated servers were added recently since it seems like such a huge flaw for killer mains
---
Meanwhile I've been vacuumed to traps on both sides very often. It's just more BVHR. Lol.

Good boy

My Ace Visconti is level 52. Still haven't found Plunderer's I. 50 fucking two.

All 3 of the new perks. Even though I haven't played dbd in a good month now I spent money to get the demogorgon DLC, a killer I still haven't really played yet. I can't buy the next DLC this fast.
---
I know there's something sweet deep down inside! I enjoy spicy stuff, but when you bring something as hot as you did to the table without knowing what people are about or how new they are to the flavor, then ya gotta be prepared for the clean up afterwards. Cause shit gets messy, queue times are long enough for survivors so throwing all that spice upfront just doesn't help anyone.
---
Since when is urban evasion a toxic perk? I use it occasionally but mainly just to help juke... nothing toxic.

I once saw a trapper in that state, even tho he wrecked us i felt so bad for him so i did the right thing and saved him : D however he killed me in the end :(

It's a dbd shit post and you're probably one of two people who will ever read my comment haha
---
Please make one for killers
---
Actually I run small game every game, negating all effects loser trapper boi
---
I never see it light up

I would simply reply with "Yes"

Britney Spears - Survivor
---
Britney Spears was a pop sensation that made everybody that listened to her, drop dead gorgeous. Originally starring as a child actor in The Mickey Mouse club at 11, she later soon began her career as an artist. Rising up on the charts known for her insanely high-pitched vocals, she made herself an icon around the globe. Recording multiple No. 1 hits in the early 2000's, with numerous sold out concerts, Britney really had it in for her. Though, many had despise her. Countless attempts to point out her flaws as an artist by News outlets never ended. "Britney, accused of Lip-syncing." She couldn't take it, she turned to something more despicable to cope. It was only a matter of time until she broke, and she did. She shaved her head, grabbed an umbrella, and started smashing a car window. Britney had lost it, she was due to rehab for substance abuse, but on her way to the treatment center... she never checked in, and it was the last we ever saw of Britney.
---
Her perks:
---
*All eyes on Me*: You love being the center of attention! After healing **3/4/5** health states of other survivors, the next time you unhook a Survivor, you are granted the **Endurance** status affect for **15** seconds
---
"All eyes on me in the center of the ring, 
---
Just like a circus", Britney Spears, Circus, 2008
---
*I'm not that innocent*: After successfully stunning the Killer with a pallet, grant **5**% extra movement speed for the next **7 seconds.** *I'm not that innocent has a cooldown of 60/80/120 seconds*
---
"Oops... I did it again" Britney Spears, 2004
---
*Poison Paradise*: You are addicted to the dangers of The Entity. When performing a rushed action outside of The Killer's terror radius, your aura is shown to The Killer ***until you are injured or put into the dying state.*** Your healing, repairing, unhooking, vaulting, searching and opening the exit gate speed is increased by ***35%.*** *Distortion will not hide your aura. Poison Paradise Has a cooldown of 120 seconds.*
---
"I'm addicted to you, don't you know that your toxic?" Britney Spears, 2008.
---
So you think I‚Äôm not a girl because I play spirit with a cute outfit?

Imagine being that person at all.
---
The same way it would be unfair for survivors to get to see which killer the current killer in the lobby is and avoid off of that. Some killers already have certain names they see and mori off first hook which is an unfair thing that doesn't really give that person any option. Less information about your opponents in the lobby is better overall.
---
Huntress attempts throw but drops it on her foot over and over again.
---
iS tHaT a CrOsShAiR?
---
you did a typo in the word 'sitting'...oh wait. oh no...
---
Implementing dc penalties btw rofl what a joke
---
I'm sorry but I have browsed this subreddit for so long and its very obvious its mostly toxic to survivors. I mean just look at the upvotes of this post even, majority of posts labeling survivors toxic have tons of upvotes and if you dare say anything bad about killers you're usually downvoted to hell.
---
Still a better love story than Twilight
---
Don't forget putting a cooldown on nurses blinks as well as more penalties for screwing them up. Before she was Playable without addons and made broken with them. Now she is Unplayable without them and only tolerable with them if you don't mind having the usual ground vision for 75% of the match.
---
How tf
---
NoEd Rewards Bad Play‚Ñ¢
---
GG EZ
---
that last one is really interesting
---
Highlighter? I just used a permanent marker!
---
In the heat of the moment most killers, even myself, don't notice those things, we see an easy down and/or borrowed time we need to hit.
---
Hope your ready for reverse skill checks when his rework is released.
---
What are those?
---
Skill checks that move in the opposite direction
---
So are you just ignoring absolutley useless NOED is and how it can be robbed from the killer at any point or you're going to die on this hill? 
---
If you're looking "realistically" endgame builds are a gamble that never works anyway. They're either win more or instant lose against competent teams. But when making a build, you look at the usefulness of the perks and they're usage.
---
Hex perks are some of the strongest in the game but your strongest build will rarely rely on more than 2 of those (1 is usually HG) because they can easily negated in most scenarios. 
---
So realistically, lots of things don't work. But when planning builds, people are going in with a level of optimism.
---
The game is horrible at detecting when you‚Äôre in chase as nurse, one of the reasons I hate going against her because I get screwed out of chase points
---
Well if you have extra addons in reserve, you‚Äôll start with the same addons equipped for next time.
---
For example, I have like 30 spark plugs for Hillbilly, so I just never take it off, and it takes one from the pool every game.
---
No I know that but I was curious if that‚Äôs an actual thing that‚Äôs gonna be implanted into the game? And like will it be skill checks that go back and forth or did they just change to the reversed direction?
---
Oh that's pretty cool, thanks for letting me know! Doctor is my favorite, so exciting!
---
Can I have the original photo?
---
I can think of 2 maps that are 100% killer sided (Hawkins and Shelter Woods), 2 Maps that are evenly balanced (Pale Rose, The Game), 3 maps that are either balanced or survivor sided depending on window spawns (Rancid Abattoir, Father Campbell's Chapel, Gas Heaven) and the rest are almost 100% balanced towards survivors (with some exceptions based off of the Killer i.e. Ghostface on lery's).
---
Yeah DS was nerfed, but as killer you don't know who is running it, so you have to always respect it unless there is no obsession.
---
It's not the perks (some of them are still a problem don't get me wrong) as much as the maps. 
---
Well, there's my point then.
---
It‚Äôs incredibly obvious when a Doctor is trying to do it, so I‚Äôm assuming this guy got some of the dumbest survivors ever.
---
Its sad people do this to "entertain themselves" I'll never understand it. Just reply with gg and leave. never give them attention
---
The doctor rework will have add ons that make give survivors a random chance of getting a reverse skill checks.
---
Lucky no it can't change direction mid way that would be outrageous.
---
I guess Myers was just to op for them.
---
(If you don't understand, that's sarcasm)
---
Lmao just show us the names. They surely would get bullied by everyone who sees this post.
---
On console (xbox1) pretty much everything is the same button so she just miss-clicked and had to run back up, it was pretty funny at the time tbh
---
God I miss DC penalties. Those two days, I only had 7 survivors rage quit on me total. It was beautiful
---
Oh I thought that was just a general thing that was being added to the game, I don‚Äôt get much doctors but when I do they‚Äôre annoying
---
What an absolutely lovely post
---
This may just be archives or dumb luck. However this is bannable if only one person is involved in farming.
---
I love reading it in *that* voice
---
r/okbuddydaylight
---
I was meaning the color but permanent marker sounds better!
---
His rework will make him even more cancerous to play against since one of his new powers is that his static field is replaced with a static blast that instantly ups a madness level.
---
Literally never but yes sometimes
---
After so long of not being able to understand what they are saying, I will finally be able to :D
---
Yup, a green perm marker
---
I did it on first try? I was lucky with the basement being in the shack and I trapped the shit out of it with pure black traps. Especially the stairs, uff
---
You know there are more than just DS for obsession perks, smh am I the only one who runs Mettle of man anymore?
---
No. I said this whole build is a gamble.  Rancor can fail just as badly as noed and unlike noed it has very little synergy with this build and only makes 1 person 1 shot. And then you're probably gonna want to hook them anyway.
---
Also I aint gonna die on any hill, wtf lmao. Try not to be so dramatic.
---
Yeah like you said it's a gamble and you are looking at the usefulness of perks which is my whole issue with rancor, there are far more useful perks for this build.
---
Yeah I think this whole build will fail as my op pointed out ( if you wanna read that then it's at the top of the page) but I think rancor just makes it even worse.

3/4/5 health states? you mean 5/4/3?
---
Youre having a reddit moment if youre gonna say surviors cant t bag but killers can nod their head furiously after getting a down. Its your game, play it how you want. But dont be surprised if your survivors say boosted killer at the end of the game after you proxy camp and tunnel them the entire game.
---
Its not a "strategy" to proxy camp a hook, its called playing like a bot
---
Insurance?
---
Evidently people don‚Äôt like Rick and Morty references. Feels bad.

Ah yes of course.

i edit it not like it matters cause it's just a joke post lol

What‚Äôs in the shrine of secrets this week?
---
Nobody:
---
BHVR: Alright guys we made it harder to hear gens, survivors, and other things for killers.
---
Also BHVR: Alright this new killer here breathes like a tired gorilla.
---
I can now only do chases. I need to fucking know where the killer is at every instant or I die
---
Thank you. Your are a good man.
---
Wtf happened?
---
Thank you. You are a good man.
---
How do you farm a teammate? Just getting into this game

Looks awesome !

Its okay just as long as its Jane.  (‡πë‚ô°‚åì‚ô°‡πë)

One side of me wants to delete keys from the game, the other side cant shake the absolute satisfaction of escaping mid chase against a toxic killer. Did it to a real toxic clown once. Chased em for 5 gens then escaped mid-chase (before endgame collapse was a thing) Dude was pissed to say the least
---
I like playing Claudette Altruistic like with Bottany Knowledge, Empathy, etc (including We'll Make It).
---
When i get the unhook they just RUN than get healed. I guess this would be ok but they get a NOTIFICATION that says the rescuer has we'll make it.
---
It feels like this sometimes
---
Survivor that just got unhooked within killer terror radius: Heal Me PLEASE
---
Survivor that just got unhooked outside of killer terror radius: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH *Runs Away*
---
This has happened once and hurt me internally.
---
I'm the looper
---
I'm very happy but I walk mega fast cause it gets me places faster
---
I thought salty end game chat was outlawed ages ago?

How do you trigger dark devotion?
---
I literally showed you a screen shot of the single trap there. The OP didn't try to stack traps. The trap bugged out on him.
---
(survivor main here)
---
you can bring ruin every game, but if you teach your player base that Ruin is in every game,  they will just get rid of it. I will run a map every single game, not to get rid of ruin, but to spite you for defaulting on what is basically a buffed thanataphobia for gens.
---
There are in fact builds that dont need ruin. Just dont be boosted, watch an otz video once in a while
---
It's alright you feel that way but remember these streamers and any toxic player that you run into play this game alot and whenever you play a game alot you get into the core mechanics and start finding and figuring out the flaws of the game you're playing. Like "Oh this thing in game happened so this thing will happen next and we lose" So when you play alot and can do things like that you get tilted faster and become more likely to be upset or aggressive. When you first start playing a game you most of the time (if you're into the idea of the game) are having so much fun win or lose that you aren't worrying about anything else. You see this alot with league streamers and it's hilarious how dumb the league subreddit is. "Why is this streamer so toxic ?" Because they play the game so damn much ofcourse it pisses them off.
---
I even use Borrowed Time and We'll make it so if they let me heal them they have even more protection.
---
I also deal with the AAAAAAHHHHHH when not in the radius thing, it's ridiculous.
---
Britney Spears sounds like the most toxic character ever just based on these perks. Step aside, toxic neas with flashlights
---
BHVR: Yeah, look at that - better nerf Legion.
---
Steve and Herobrine
---
who‚Äôs susie
---
I've gotten so used to it that I just make myself something to eat or drink while it happens
---
Even with borrowed time. Just do it on Endgame Collapse.
---
If you were on hook you could have unalived  yourself so you don‚Äôt get a penalty.
---
Btw I forgot to say I‚Äôm a survivor main
---
Tried "Riva Tuner Statistics Server"? It's pretty simple, download it, add the DBD exe, lock frames to 120.
---
Wait...... You use your power? 
---
How toxic.
---
Probably cause of all the short legged people telling me ‚Äúslow dowwwwn I can‚Äôt keep up!‚Äù Lol
---
if the killers face camping at least wait out the hook so your team can punish
---
Nope, console player lol
---
yeah against a competent survivor team at high ranks youre kind of fucked no matter what unless you're playing a top tier killer, esp if the survs are in voice chat
---
I think we aren't playing the same red/purple ranks lol.

---

---
the bait is for boosted killers
---
thats because killers have been whining for years now and every perk and item is slowly being nerfed with each patch
---
I dc when I know the survivors skill level is greater than mine. I kept on getting red ranks while I was green rank. Literally had no chance and they got mad cause I left.
---
Took me awhile to realize this about my Ghost Face address books. I thought I had a bug where I wasn't losing them after a match, and had a shocking revelation 5 matches later.
---
How come it won‚Äôt work on perks like dead hard and such. I‚Äôm having a hard time finding the solution to this. Any help would be appreciared
---
i did it with hag. was pretty easy tbh. purple rank survivors are overly altruistic and dont expect 5 traps in the basement
---
Kindred for me was definitely one of those ‚ÄúRank Reset‚Äù perks. I‚Äôd run Empathy and Kindred so I could constantly keep track of people.
---
A killer can not possibly be toxic if they're playing clown and getting looped for 5 gens. There's just no room for toxicity.
---
AKA the fastest way to motivate you to become a god at the game
---
What monitor you have that has 240Hz refresh rate? And why would you get that as 144Hz is enough.
---
OK then
---
my attitude is toxic? lmao no, its just frustrating going against killers with no skill that just camp, while having vrown rank team mates, who do nothing but die, leaving you to carry the team, EVRRY, SINGLE, GAME. Imagining having to deal with that every game, while you are in the top ranks of the game, and dealing with it for a full week. Theres a difference between being toxic and being over the bullshit you are fed without a choice thanks to their dumb idea to stop you seeing your teams ranks in the lobbies. Sure i lobby dodged, but it made the game fun because i knew my team wasnt going to be shit house and i didnt need to do everything.
---
Pipping as a survivor is stupid easy anyways. As long as you don't get tunneled and die first, you're going to black pip.
---
*Beakfast*
---
I have lost all hope in humanity
---
Wym "what?" Load up another game and chase another survivor for 1 second lol.
---
Have fun.
---
Flip side when an insidious wraith sits near hook and baits rescuers and then claims he‚Äôs not camping we can all have a laugh :D
---
I sure do love Christmas
---
You can use the blood web an infinite amount of times, but the level does not go past 50 so they probably are just adding the levels to him.
---
It comes tomorrow
---
I was only half serious :) In 2 out of 5 of my attempts to finish noed challenge, it was cleansed in front of the gate, in another one it was cleansed near a gen that was just finished. In another one 3 survs just left the map before I've hooked a person (first damn hook!) with a ward, and I got the challenge only after I've slugged EVERYBODY and opened the gate MYSELF. You may call it behavior bias. But survivors cleansing every totem isn't the main reason, why I never use NOED (and rarely use warden).
---
So humor is low key racism? Because this post insinuates the use of the N word and then backtracks with "oh it was just something that made you think it was the N word (which ppl find funny) but look how not racist I am"
---
lol, you people are truly pathetic
---
fyi, that is virtue signaling in its highest regard
---
Mostly because I'm awful on her lol not really sure who else I would rework.
---
Sorry the comforting lies booth line is so long my dude.
---
Damn y'all are playing him up as a god when hes pretty boosted. so yea i guess he needs a buff.
---
Here i have a synopsis of his usual game
---
"oh fook these fookin survivors got my ruin, so toxic, oh fook ive come back from proxy camping a hook and you have BT, fook, oh finally ive caught ya, darn fookin DS these darn toxic survivors" and then he titles his videos "toxic swf squad" those squads are boosted first off, I guarantee you hes lost his mind against a decent swf squad. 
---
Watch any of his early videos of DBD and his truetalenting all over the place. I wrote a post about this so im not repeating here.
---
Is this what build you still recomend with Myers?
---
it's not what I did though, I have no idea why that happened.
---
it was actually meant as a compliment...see, this is a good example of how retarded reddit is though...think I will go back in time and make this my junior high science fair project...will scare the hell out of the world just how far humanity has devolved in absolute stupidity.
---
Its perk, gives the unhooked person endurance for 15 seconds, must unhook in killers tr
---
How do I read Manga format? Right to left?
---
Why's she look so small tho
---
Obligatory just do bones
---

Why not play against them for practice? Sure all 4 will escape many times, but you'll start to get better.
---
Wha-?

When I first watched I was on mobile with low battery so my brightness was shit. Thanks for pointing it out :)

Remember the infinitely stacking Sloppy bug on Wraith?
---
Actually as long as it's justifiable, you could/can camp anyone. Let's say you don't wanna end a game with one sacrifice, then camp for another, seems fair to me.
---
uh
---

---
Is it possible to get to tier 70 before the rift closes? I'm on 37 and I still got a couple of survivor challenges left.
---
Cypress memento mori can stay the stame, nobodies gonna use it unless they trying to bodyblock and get flashlight saves or if they're on a pallet, otherwise they'll just do the ordinary hook for more BP.
---
Consider Freddy &amp; Leatherbutt's licenses dead and bought as a one-time offer, with a possibility of renewal whenever BHVR decides to do so, which by the look of things, seems never.
---
So Main the Killers you know will have cosmetics now, and in the future -- non-license Killers.
---
Same, went ahead and rented a server to play a modpack with my friends .
---
I don't play scummy like that.
---
yeah my demo has none of those i couldnt have done it lol
---
Damn. That strat also works with hag and (kinda) Freddy
---
I play for fun. Waiting for 15 minutes to get into a lobby then have this happen to you isn‚Äôt fun. He also slugged us both and camped us until I bled out. No one PIP‚Äôd
---
Only good perk on bill IMO is borrowed time. Nancy has perks that help you be immersed. 
---
Choose how do you want to play : help others or yourself
---
Yea but you did it though
---
Seems good
---
It wouldn't be a challenge if it's easy and the archives never close, You literally have infinite time to do it
---
Actually same, except a couple weeks ago. Hopefully your friends stick with it longer than mine did, lol.
---
That's not Dwights' voice, weird
---
all of adam's perks are really fun, though they only work 1/10 times lol
---
I would get people like this all the time, its why I stopped playing killer it seems like no matter what a killer does they are hated.     Unless they throw the game
---
Its a bug
---
You are everything that is wrong with this game, you need to learn how to relax.
---
It
---
Is
---
Just
---
A
---
Game.
---
I mainly get these messages, the odd salty guy whines. I did once become mates with someone very early into learning the game after camping them when they flashlight clicked all game, and then proceeded to message me afterward. Players might be toxic in the chat, but they can actually be sound people.
---
Lol I've seen Otz use it before, looked interesting
---
That‚Äôs not a speed hacker, it‚Äôs a bug in the current build for DBD. Use the search bar before you accuse people next time
---
Eat a dick
---
No thanks üßÇ
---
This thread is against sub rules and your matchmaking is normal.
---
I had to submit myself to farming. Took me a while to get everyone on board. I knew trying the challenge would be wayyy too dependant. Cba with DCes and corner basements.
---
Not the same way. That would tell you what character you are going against, not who plays it or the addons being used.
---
Seeing red ranks means a skill difference. Like going against an Olympic athlete as a newbie. I always feel bad for the yellow rank killer who's clearly new. Especially if my team mates are being toxic. 
---
Yes, they should fix matchmaking. But I don't see that happening any time soon.

2 days ago I needed to finish the challenge to stun killer 4 times in 1 game. There was 2 of us (survivors) left and I only hit killer 3 times. So I blocked the passage to my teammate when killer was on him. Killer hit teammate and that allowed me to pallet stun him. Then I escaped through the hatch when teammate got hooked. Still feel bad about it but I would do it again. =(
---
I can‚Äôt blame you, having 2 dces, the May making and being a bubba, but how did you only get 3k BP? Especially how someone got 13k.
---
I don't think you got the joke good sir. I must do this.
---
r/woooosh
---
Don't try it.
---
&gt;FYI for those stating im "crying". Its flair'd as Shitpost/Meme not Discussion my dudes. Gen tapping by definition is an exploit but i dont care about it as killer or survivor
---
Labeling your salty rant as shitpost doesn't prevent people from discussing about it.
---
Nah not that hard. Trapper with iron grasp and agitation. Just hook firts person to basement and trap both of the doors and the window and then wait nearby with insidius for someone to go and try to save them and reset the trap that they took off to go unhook the person.
---
Rank doesn't even matter in this game because most player of us play like boosted apes. Ranks at this point are just meant to keep newbies and older players seperated.
---
All the mentioned ones have some kind of requirement before they're active, instant chainsaw is easier and not particularly fair but neither of the top add ons for majority of the killers are. Here's NOED requirement: lose the game.
---
What the fuck is a baby dwight
---
It indeed doesn't.
---
The issue with picking up traps tho is *walk into absolute nothing without any gens to patrol or survivors to chase to pick up your trap while somebody gets trapped in the area you actually want to be and frees themselves while you 40m away* or *forget about your traps lying on the moon*. Now imagine how well the monster sized traps go with that.
---
But occupying 2/3 of the map is far from camping.
---
It seems you are yet to have been blessed, RetardFucker182.
---
Enlighten me ihaveaids4
---
Yeah I think she could make good use of it
---
u could make baby dwight memes :0
---
How to make mori scarier 101
---
I don't know how "scummy" it is when the challenge essentially encourages you to play like that. If there's an increase in insidious Bubbas that's more on BHVR.
---
Animation getting better and more enjoying, but a script for some jokes and dialogs. Ugh.. Meh.. Left a like just because I love his work, but so far didn't laugh once since 7 episode
---
yup its even better w her faster phasing movement addons so u can get the exposed 1 faster
---
Devs don't play the game. They get feedback from players but as you can imagine survivors far outweighs killers in numbers.
---
Also bad survivors far outweighs good survivors in numbers. (It's like what, only 10% of playerbase makes to green or something?)
---
The problem is at high ranks. I can go perk less against green killers and still escape even if my teammates don't do gens. (Actually happened last night cuz I had bill daily on PS4..he's lv1)
---
But at high rank? Everyone does gen. Injured? Fuck it just do gen. Someone on hook? Don't worry, just do gen because it's gonna take a while for hooked guy to go to 2nd phase anyway.
---
But instead of listening to people who actually get the game at red ranks, Devs listen to majority that are just not skilled/knowledgeable in game (i.e. purples and above. Yeah I would count rank 4 too cuz that's not a real red rank either). Result? Insta killer queue at red ranks, but long ass wait for survivors. Will they fix it?? Not likely. This is same Dev who said hag was fine, nurse was fine, spirit is fine, nerds pig.

I did it 2 times in a row so im lucky i guess

I can certainly say I have my regrets. Anyways, just do a quick search for baby dwight on the subreddit.
---
Aight d√§nks.
---
I am intrigued.
---
I want charms hanging from RBTs.
---
Going against legion is fucking annoying without being shagged by NOED at the end of the game.
---
No excuses for SWF that don‚Äôt clear totems though.
---
it doesnt matter if you are brown to green ranks, its basically the same, but red ranks are much MUCH different to brown and green, and getting 3 brown ranks in your team as a red rank is absolutely garbage, if you don't see that you are clearly not a red rank player. They go down in 6 seconds of chase, they sit and hide and never do gens, THEY DON'T PLAY THE GAME, how is there no difference between that and a team that gets gens done in 4 minutes? I prefer being chased an outplaying killers to gen rushing but even looping can only get you so far. The game has objectives for a reason.
---
Playing with Adam is like playing as the BFG. He‚Äôs gigantic.

You mean longer queus.

Pallet stun her won't take away corrupted purge. And if you cleanse every fountain the fountain reset AND she instanly got corrupted purge.
---
**Cough.** Kaisen Chuui. **Cough.**
---
I know the feeling, as someone who plays Survivor and Killer.
---
I don‚Äôt normally use NOED. Only when I get shit perk luck at the beginning and don‚Äôt really have anything else that I‚Äôd get use of to fill the slot. This is sadly one of those times.
---
Ah... this makes me miss the old Freddy he was a fun change to play as ;c
---
Someone just passed out on their keyboard.
---
Next time put /s
---
fake docs have a habit of standing in unreachable places, makes it hard to pretend.
---
Not only as far as possilbe from the plague, you also need to be as far as possible from the gen. Do it right and you got a free gen.
---
Noed rewards the killer for not doing their job
---
Ohm is truly the best DBD streamer out there. He‚Äôs so wholesome. I love him.
---
Break. The bones.
---
The tracking wasn't OP, but it *was* unintuitive.
---
The fact that your aura was revealed wasn't communicated very well at all.
---
It should have been more clear from the survivor side.
---
I play devour hope as my only lit totem on spirit, if it doesn't work whatever I still can win with 2/3 perks, most of the times tho it works cuz people see spirit so rush gens, they also see no ruin so even more rush gens and don't care about totems, and then the get at least 1 shotted once
---
Don't get me wrong, but here it's either you have god team and escape with 3 people left or you get garbage team and they drag you down with them
---
So knowing a word is toxic?
---
Maybe have a formula that compares everyone's ranks and creates a gen speed average?
---
I had similar glitch with trapping ruin, in a game the other day. A survivor got caught and I picked up the body the trap had moved significantly to the left. When I tried retrapping ruin, I couldn't pick up the trap at first cause it was poking halfway into a rock. It took me maybe 6 or 7 tries to pick it up again.
---
Honestly there are times where I‚Äôm like ‚Äúhow the fuck did that happen....‚Äù then I remember I‚Äôm a really low level newb anyways xD

---
One of the main reasons I bought the Saw chapter
---
I don't see why not? Yeah it's not impossible anymore to at least 2K with the usage of BL going down, but the map isn't even close to being fixed. Haddon number one worst map followed by Ormond.
---
I‚Äôve been burned by a trapped trapper before. Guy got stuck in his own trap, so I disarmed it to release him, straight away he hits me and chased me to get the down then face camped me on hook.... worst bit was we only had 1 gen done. Not like it was in the end game collapse.
---
Why didnt even get a Blind, let alone a save. 
---
It looked like the timing was right but it didn't even start to blind him. Either Lightborn or bug.
---
Gotta be closer, the flashlight has to look like it's being blocked by their face. It seemed to go through him. It shouldve worked tho
---
Imagine finding a totem on Lery's
---
Never used this tactic or had it used against me but it sounds fun
---
Leader doesn‚Äòt help with gens anymore sadly, use prove thyself instead. 
---
Other nice perks are for example iron will (Jake) and botany knowledge (Claudette) as these are very straight forward.
---
Otz? What's that?
---
More killers are glitching than working properly atm.
---
&gt;what has probably happened
---
Precisely. Thanks for the footage, I'll use this in the future. 
---
This is nothing but desync between one of the clients (you or the survivor) and the server. 
---
Another feature added with Dedicated Servers.
---
&gt;Of course the Survivor is going to crawl away from the hooks, so they can increase their wiggle times long enough for them to break free. They're doing what they should do.
---
Like the killer is doing what he should do. Let them bleed out, so what?
---
&gt;And of course the Killer knows this and so they just won't pick them up/eat the DS because they don't want to "lose". A bit petty, but they're the ones in control.
---
Petty? How they are in control if you force them to do something they won't? You just contradict yourself
---
Anyone would prefer a hook than killing somebody by bleeding out. You just get less point and emblem points, they are the ones in control if you get those points or not in that situation
---
I have all the killer perks, trust me, it gets so much worse when you just want a specific perk.
---
Dude fuck cosmetics for Freddy just P3 that beast and ride the wave of pussy juice that will follow
---
Everyone has their own somewhat unique style, but yours really stuck out to me. The defined outlines and lil' scribbles n' all, it's lovely.
---
&gt;Sorry if this has been suggested before.
---
Yes it has, multiple times. Specially when Demogorgon happened and the "humanoid" barrier was broken.
---
I turned around before she teleported because I bumped into her even tho she wasn‚Äôt there yet
---
What else has Freddy worn other than the red and green jumper? I remember him wearing some kind of coat in one of the films but other than that I‚Äôm not sure.
---
Its a cheap perk that gives you free kills but whatever, i wouldnt care what randoms think
---
Sarcasm?
---
You say that like Legion wouldn't be bullied by every other killer. They're teenagers, surrounded by giant beefy, monsters, and angry ghost women. Also that one beefy woman.
---
I guess you only watched bad movies if you think just to suicide squad..
---
There's movies and stories where there is no resolution but end up with a deeper understanding of their environment or just to send a message of despair in case of horror/thriller movies
---
You don't need an happy ending or a change of the environment to make a good story. That's a very narrow and ignorant take. You can totally make a story where you're in a desperate situation, you won't change it but you might change yourself or give the message there's no escape.
---
In this case, about DbD world, you can make a lot of things. You can make a story where is more like Lovecraft, that is **exactly** how I described. There's no happy ending, you won't change your environment and is an eternal cycle of despair realizing how small humanity is and how weak they are. Mentally and physically, with deep philosophical questions and almost no answers most of the time
---
This will work especially for how much DbD have been inspired by Lovecraft work. So please, next time, don't waste time saying such dumb stuff if you have no idea what a good story is
---
So you tunneled a guy to death? Im not really surprised they were upset. 
---
Anyway just ignore randoms, zero point engaging with them
---
Here is the other side of "fix matchmaking" coin. People that can't play. 
---
10 / 10 community.
---
You must be a girl...
---
Nurse - Her power allows her to ignore all game mechanics. Survivors are playing an entirely new game going against her as pallets are practically useless, and windows only help when you‚Äôre far away or out of sight. Once a nurse hits a certain skill point, there‚Äôs pretty much nothing a survivor can do in a chase.
---
Spirit - She‚Äôs like a less extreme version of the nurse. Her power allows her to avoid being susceptible to loops, and once a survivor is injured, using her power basically gives her a guaranteed down as she moves at 175% speed and knows your exact location from the grunts of pain while they can‚Äôt see you.
---
Hillbilly - His power is simultaneously an instant down and gives him crazy map control with no cooldown. He is still loopable but his power gives him really good options to zone out survivors into bad spots out of loops. He can basically be anywhere on the map he wants to be instantly with the double movement speed his chainsaw sprint gives which no other killer can do. 
---
Huntress - Ranged hits are just really strong and scales really well with player skill level. Where huntress falls short are huge maps due to her bad movement speed and maps with tons of tall loops that she can‚Äôt throw hatchets over. Put huntress on an indoor map vs an Autohaven map (which has tons of short loops) and its night &amp; day how strong she is.
---
Sorry but I find these even more timewasting. Having a pleasant conversation with another player is no more interesting than a rageing opponent.
---
Yeah... pre-rework nurse this was already a thing but people didn't bother that much because you always had your blinks even after a failed attempt because the map design cucked you.
---
Now not only you get cucked for no reason whatsoever but your power is on cooldown. 
---
BHVR should've just nerfed her add-ons and grab feedback on how strong base Nurse would be but instead, they gutted her past the desirable point.
---
Don't get me wrong, this is not me saying "nurse is the worse killer in the game", she still is quite strong but her gameplay experience is overall clunkier and frustrating.
---
The newest map is definitely the biggest offender, you literally can‚Äôt play her because you get stuck on everything + when you want to blink in the middle of the map there‚Äôs like a 90% chance you land in the basement afterwards.
---
Not to mention low sensitivity on console &amp; frame drops while blinking...
---
Can't support Witchhunt, no mattre what is the occasion. Maybe they are just kids, maybe they had a bad day and they wanted to steam out and this was the only way they could achieve it.
---
You should probably go get that checked.
---
Either Huntress need some glasses or u somehow became a Claudette right there
---
Id recommend you to start with Claudette or Nea Karlsson. Former has self heal, for healing without a med-kit, empathy- to see injured players no matter where they are ( so you can follow what is going around )- and the latter has urban evasion- to move around a lot faster while crouching and balanced landing, a speed boost that willl prove useful.
---
Once you unlock their teachables, you can play with anyone you want.
---
how do i play with my steam friends from the xbox store?
---
Look this bothers me.
---
Killers are not balanced around 4king before all 5 generators are completed, they are not intended to; that it's possible to 4k when not being balanced around it is like saying it's possible to 1v6 in Overwatch despite not being balanced around it.
---
You take Wraith and you slap NOED on him because he's an M1 killer that gives a survivor 28 seconds (!!!) of straight-line distance if he hits a healthy survivor with a regular M1 (and doors only take 20 seconds to open!) and throw him into the endgame after all 5 generators popped and he's not going to get a kill at all.
---
It truly is ridiculous that someone who wants to play Wraith or Pig instead of Hillbilly gets shit on for using a perk slot on NOED, when Hillbilly moves so much faster and instant-downs so much easier than Wraith.
---
You want to end survivors being rewarded for not doing their job? Don't run DS (it adds about the same distance to a chase as NOED removes it, 20 meters added for DS and 16 meters removed for NOED) because it lets you repair 75% of a generator, rewards you for being caught, and lasts long enough that you don't have to be tunneled in order to proc it.
---
Borrowed Time is more fair because the killer has to actually be fucking camping (unless you immediately unhook before he can leave), DS punishes a killer who tries to defend their generators from survivors with DS active.
---
I think the sentiment is that everyone waited for a match for a while and they want to get it loading which can take a while, and it tells the lobby that you're not afk. I played against a killer last night that didn't play. 
---
But I personally don't care, it's only a minute.
---
I feel so sorry for you, I used to be in a similar situation, too. However, I believe that Claudette didn't mean it. Sometimes I tried to go and take a hit for my teammates but ended up bodyblock my buddy. I felt really bad and had to send a message to explain to that guy.  Therefore, I think your situation was just the bad luck, so don't feel so bad about it.
---
This is so not funny..
---
Meg mains rise up!
---
Not 4king on an M1 killer without an instant-down and using NOED (119% movement speed) because you're not one of the killers who can actually perform against even semi-decent red ranks (ie; not Nurse, Freddy, Spirit, or Hillbilly) without getting absolutely crushed by generator speeds is not bad play.
---
Even hitting someone as Wraith costs you 3 generators; it takes 28 seconds to catch back up after the first hit, plus however long it took to find them, plus the pallet they used while you were uncloaking that you either break or run around. Plus the pallet they reached after you either mindgamed or broke the pallet.
---
If they're injured now then they reached a safe pallet, if they're not you hope you can mindgame it. Either way you break a safe pallet and they reach yet another pallet, all through the jungle gym+building they can easily run through with the post-hit speed boost.
---
DS rewards bad play more than NOED, you can 0 to 100% a generator w/ the right toolbox after getting unhooked, then run straight into the killer, get downed, picked up, and DS them all because you lost a chase and got hooked.
---
Not even Adrenaline is supposed to be a reward; you're playing a game designed around the killer only get 2 kills before you finish all 5 gens, you are playing a game designed and intended for you to complete the generators beyond anything that can be done to stop you. You aren't being given a challenge, you aren't being given something difficult to complete, popping all 5 generators is literally the bare minimum that is expected of the survivor team.
---
And it's not supposed to be something they ever fail to do unless they deserve to depip.
---
*cracks knuckles, deep breath*
---
jUsT a LiTtLe BiT
---
Either that or "ya little sh!t"
---
To do this challenge I had to literally sell my soul to the game. I was doing this with Bubba since my only other killer with Agitation and a decent power to do this was Trapper, and he literally had no other good perk.
---
So I go in. 5 games where someone kills himself on a hook, D/Cs or whatever.
---
I get to Suffocation Pit. I usually don't like doing this, but the only way to win on this map if survivors are decent is to force a 3 gen on one side. So I do. On the basement side. God. Fucking. Damn it.
---
I luckily find someone quite close to the Basement (in Shack) so I proceed to get them. Ok. 1 guy in basement. Time to defend the 3 gens around me.
---
2 gens are plowed through on the other side of the map. I see scratch marks towards the middle. I down another guy, but he's too far from the basement, even with Agitation. I hook him as close as possible, but meanwhile someone has gotten the basement save. I desperately run for it, hoping that I can make it for the stairs in time, but to no use. They're already at another loop. Another gen is done. Only the 4 closest ones remain.
---
At this point, it's a relentless battle. Everytime someone gets too close to shack, I attempt to down them, otherwhise I get as many pallets gone as possible.
---
With sweat streaming down my face, I notice 2 guys pressuring a gen towards the middle. Everytime I get close, they run to the further side of the map, knowing they were both on last hook and I couldn't leave the area if I wanted the basement hook. So I swipe 300 ml (10,1442 ounces for Freedom Lovers) of sweat off my forehead and down them both, leaving them as slugs. Back to gen pressure.
---
Alas! On of the 2 remaining gens is popped. I hurry to the position. There I notice the Blendette that didn't show herself for the whole game. She attempts to Sprint Burst to a loop, but her bad positioning allows me to cut her off, both retorically and physically, and hook her 6 feet under.
---
Meanwhile I see the 2 slugs were picked up, and my ulcer **explodes** seeing the regressing gen is nearing completion. One of the 2 ex-slugs (both wastefully healed) attempts to near a hill to Balance his ass out of a Landing, but luckily he miscalculates the distance between me and him and falls under my Chainsaw. Blood for the Blood Gods, the first death hath arrived. 3 to go. The second ex-slug gets careless, and instead of running to the middle looks for loops near the basement. All gone. Second sacrifice.
---
As my blood vessels erupt blood, the last gen is completed. But both exit gates are on the Basement's side.
---
# THANK YOU ENTITY
---
Out of the last 2 survivors, I initially spot the Meg that completed the gen, but my attention quickly switches to the Blendette aiming for the gates. Buffoon! My Chainsaw is already through your eretical corpse. But I can't risk hooking her. It would take more than 25 seconds (0.416 American Minutes) to get her to the basement, and the Meghead's distance to the gates is currently unknown. I sweat another 2 gallons of water and look for her.
---
Alas! She committed an error. Going through the middle loops, she sprinted for 0.043 seconds, allowing me to triangulate her position and immediately start the chase. Another one falls before the Saw. Time to hook.
---
To prevent any Unbreakable shenanigans, I hurl my chonky body back to the last known Claudette position. Unbelievably, she was still around. Blood for the Blood Gods! Only one sacrifice remains.
---
Through the power of BBQ and Chili, I see the Meg. But she's too far! Even if I were to employ the full Mad Grit, Iron Grasp and Agitation combo (of which I only had Agitation) I wouldn't have been able to bring her to my Bubba Cave.
---
In a last, desperate effort, I grab her flimsy body and make my way to my objective. The Hatch had already been secured (*read: slammed shut*), so I was on a timer. I manage to get her to the basement stairs, and there I apply all of what many painful years of Physics and DbD had thaught me: going down the stairs of the basement, if you were to face the survivor's corpse towards the down slope, once they dropped down your mighty shoulders, the increased fall would make them stagger longer, allowing an easier hunt (from "*Laws and Principles of DS countering* ***(OUTDATED)***"). And so it happens. She couldn't reach the window in time. Victory was mine.  
---
But at what cost?
---
With what remains of my energies, drained from the lack of liquids within my body, I reach the end screen.  
---
Devoid of any joy or sentiment, I see that the challenge is complete. I'd leave the game, but there's one last thing to do.
---
Before I can understand of what the survivors want to report me for, I profusely aplogise for having them sit through that hell of a game, and whish them for a better future. After reading that and understanding my sorrow, they calmed down and actually showed some simpathy.
---
I head back to the menu. Before ending it all, there was one last thing to do. Trapping 6 people in a single game.
---
I do it first try against farming survivors.

Dunno, but there's literally no differemce between 144 and 240
---
Susie looking super cute, wouldn't mind if I get tied up if she talks to me :)
---
The bans stack up to six hours, and possibly up to 24 hours.
---
When I got the hatch and I‚Äôm waving incessantly at the last person on the 2nd hook refusing to die with 2 gens left...I literally die.  You gave the killer forever to find me.  Out of what, spite that you didn‚Äôt survive this one.  If tables ever turn I just kill myself to give the last teammate a fighting chance.
---
End game chat? Not sure what you‚Äôre asking
---
The chat where PC players always say GG
---
I think he's trying to say if a survivor pulls his internet cable he doesn't get punished. 
---
It doesn't matter because right now they stopped giving out DC penalties. Also when the DC penalties were live [I tested them](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ec05r0/disconnection_penalty_lengths_tested/?st=k4jrghnn&amp;sh=d3ed1417) and pulling the plug did count.
---
Except there is, just not as massive as 60 to 144. Not what I made this thread for though so thanks :)
---
 I love the Susie drawing nice work !
---
Fuck this challenge.
---
Actually Jeff and legion have met before, Frank was a regular where Jeff worked and asked jeff to paint "the legion" on one of the walls in ormond, so next time you see the legion written on the wall in mount ormond, that's actually Jeff's work!
---
Its always a fucking meg, i‚Äôve stopped trying to get the killers attention so my final teammate can do gens if its a meg due to how many times i‚Äôve ran the killer around every loopable pallet and still not had a gen completed. You go down and they‚Äôre always crouched down in a corner of the map or hiding in a locker.
---
Noticeable difference only when it fluxuates between 144 and 240, literally none otherwise. 150 is the hard limit for human eye.
---
I would've gotten it on my first try but, ya know, crutchbreakable.
---
It's PC. I think it depends on region you live. I don't know.

Yep, I did. I'll try again in evening. But queueing was very fast year or two ago. What did they change?

Phhhh, second try with insidious Bubba. Ez
---
&gt;Is this just unlucky matchmaking or is this a constant thing ? Because I would rather have fair games rather than going up against triple flashlight SWF at rank 10 on my second killer game lol
---
This is not an option most of the time. Your options often will be, play unfair matches or not play at all. Which one do you prefer?
---
Regarding matchmaking, here:
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
 
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

---
Nothing, is the same as aways with some new rules that aggravated certain scenarios. Queue times vary from time of the day, rank and region.
---
It was never gone, but instead of happening 90% of the time it happens 10% of the time (bullshit numbers but you get the idea)
---
This game is toxic because lots of people make it toxic. So you can either accept that and play it and try to remain calm and have some fun and just forget about this stuff and not let it affect you or find a less toxic game which would be very easy. For the moment I'm gonna try and have some fun with this game but soon I will move on because this toxicity is getting to me and I play games to have fun, not make me feel worse about life.

That's like when the joker cut off his face and wore it as a mask

Level cap is 50, but after 50 you start seeing four perks per bloodweb. If you're not trying to Prestige, or are prestige III, going up and beyond the level cap is how your get perks and items faster.

I think dedicated servers still have some bugs to iron out.

... You can try to unhook yourself hoping for either the 4% to continue playing or just putting yourself in stage 2...

I like botany, autodidact, empathy and then borrowed time.
---
You play more for healing, not for objective but I find the rng in whether or not I'll get stacks is fun -- it makes the game more unpredictable rather than just relying on meta perks like every other give mind player.   
---
It's so satisfying to complete 50% of a heal just out of no where and then watch the survivor you were healing pause for a second to figure out what just happened.
---
I hope the insightful was how survivors need a big nerf. We don't get enough of them.
---
Apparently for Suzie.

Looks like poor Dwight has gotten himself into another sticky situation!
---
Why not just wait the 60 seconds and waste 60 seconds of the killers time.. And then if my team mates try and get me I DC before they get there so they don't die in the basement. If they don't try and get me then I will wait 60 seconds and then struggle in phase 2 to buy them time.

---
Controllers on mobile are complicated
---
Looper for sure! For me its super boring to play immersed, i like being in chase when i play surv etc.
---
i'm gonna be honest, I hate these "single gen, no escape" rooms. if there hadn't been a window there, what would you do against a hillbilly/myers/Leatherface ?
---
you have no chance but to get insta downed.
---
I think even ghostface could get you, provided he was good on switching between cornerstalking and blocking your exit.
---
Not possible
---
Pretty much the only add on that truely matters. Really wish he got a add on change.
---
dbd reddit: yay christmas
---
devs: wrong-o
---
Exactly so what is he getting at still
---
Look who's shitting on the sofa
---
One time I sent a message (Xbox) to the survivor about where the hatch was since it was a fun match. He never went in and died from the endgame collapse. He messaged after, "Oh, you were the killer." :(
---
*crickets*
---
I agree... They definitely made a mistake once I heard that awful yet hilarious pun
---
‚ÄúSlowly dying inside‚Äù
---
The energy surrounding this image is unstable. We must contain the 2 specimens in this image for further testing.
---
They don't but it would let you use dark devotion to get into position and let insidious take over.
---
Bloody Eddie gluskin or whatever that would just be unnerving
---
Because it has endgame and postgame chat. What are you trying to get at?
---
Right, because holding your bloody hands up while your mouse hangs open out of shock while tears stream down your face definitely doesn't convey "instant regret and misery".
---
But it's your opinion lmao...
---
Would definitely be quite a cool chapter love outlast
---
Loved How you made a reference inside a reference. &lt;3
---
Depends on rank and region and what role. It‚Äôs very obvious
---
if you want to play to your fullest potential and as effectively as possible, yes
---
Oh thank you! Sorry I'm really new to reddit still. I'll use that in the future.
---
Oh no what will he do to poor Dweet
---
Don‚Äôt really have much chance if they‚Äôve got iron grasp/agitation on some maps.
---
You‚Äôre so cool!
---
This is one of the most entertaining fame accounts I've read!
---
&gt; *If you missed some rewards in The Rift, most of them will eventually be available in our in-game store after a minimum period of 6 months. (More details to be revealed at a later date.)*
---
Indeed.
---
10/10 Game
---
Oh no haha, been there
---
Ok... you‚Äôre*
---
Im sorry you made me do it
---
Such funny and original, you should be a comedian!
---
Dwight all the way. Steve is annoying af (at least imo) xD
---
No problem^^
---
Oh
---
My main put-off is the eyes, they look dead, but not in the sense they should be. They look bored more than anything.
---
Idk, I just don't feel that emotion seeing this pic. The rest is pretty nice thougu
---
You‚Äôre god damn Dwight
---
You¬¥re probably rank 20 right? Thats the reason why your queues are so long. You have to get out there and queues will be better :)
---
Can you crouch past hag traps at all or do you just have to eat the spook? Hag is one of my least favourite killers to go against because the spooking is just too much.
---
Bill for sure, borrowed time and unbreakable are both perks that kick ass as high level survivors. High lvl killers have no problem slugging, because it more beneficial to slug someone, hit their teammate for extra hit points, and then hook them. Or check the area for a survivor with a flashlight. IME most killers below lvl 6 will slug you at least 1x a game. Borrowed time can be used pretty much every game so its a good perk. If used right, by the rescuer, and rescuee, it can change the outcome of the game.
---
Uh, Clown was also described as being very physically powerful. Like, yes he's gotten old and grown fat but the dude is still supposed to be a strength powerhouse.
---
Oh my gaaaawd. Stop XD
---
Take their chicken nuggets! They won‚Äôt expect it!
---
they probably tried to at first but since the killers have super strength and durability it didnt go well for them
---
I quit trying this one because of this. It‚Äôs hard enough that everyone seems aware as soon as you‚Äôre trying and they‚Äôll direct the chase as far from the basement as they can. But of the ~12 times I‚Äôve tried people seem to DC even when I just get the first person in the basement.
---
The clown really reminds me of an obese Hector lol
---
It‚Äôs funny, the perk was intended as a perk for ‚Äúlate game‚Äù but it‚Äôs just used by players who fail to their job as killer lmao
---
I saw that game, Myers chased him most of the game and couldn't catch him lol.
---
Yeah it's really bs tbh. Tru3 has what about 3000 + hrs in the game. A rank 14 could have maybe 10 hrs and as different killers. 
---
This is why I made my post about letting survivors see other survivors ranks and hell maybe they should let killers see survivors ranks too.
---
Even though much lower ranking, 2/4 killed is nice.
---
I actually read so many manga that I didn't even notice that I was reading right to left
---
The 2 ppl in basement was hard enough. First person dc, second kills herself as I got the third person down there but luckily counted it for me.
---
Dad Trapper is back!
---
Do you translate these yourself?
---
Yeah I had one of these last week, played reworked Freddy for the first time and was uber rusty so I was pretty trash, game was still fairly even but the survivors were super wholesome in post game and we had a nice chat.
---
I tried to play in my Mac but just gave up and bought a Windows laptop because it was easier. Haha.
---
And then they get a single skillcheck and you gotta do it again.
---
You should save them for Halloween like I do
---
Halloween is the best time to get spooky &lt;3
---
Congrats, Now that's my dream
---
No, way too many higher ranked Survivors will either just insta-dodge or start flaming if any Survivor with a 2-digit rank appears in the lobby. Not to mention that rank is no guarantee of skill, as plenty of Rank 1 Survivors are complete monkeys, so just because that one Rank 12 is a potato doesn't mean you should be able to pre-judge and dodge everyone else.
---
Apparently I bought it so my Pig can unlock nothing but Freddy splinters and my Freddy can unlock nothing but Pig Splinters
---
Afraid not. I own every chapter on steam. Only thing I've bought with Shards are cosmetics and I've never bought Auric Cells
---
Good thing you can dc in the loading screen when you see a mori without losing pips, the offerings and the items.
---
I agree with people who say pig
---
This man has big brain
---
Thanks for posting these. The OP‚Äôs Twitter is filled with porn lol
---
I had my steam profile spammed by an angry person that tried to shame me for commenting in one of steam threads that it's frustrating when survivors hide in lockers if you actually MANAGE to activate double ultra rare add-ons. Some people actually convinced that Myers is OP.
---
Context is king.
---
If you Dstrike me, then Dead Hard to get to a safe pallet and stun me and start squatting down, that reads like you laughing at me cos I got gimmicked.
---
If you get caught out and you're not gonna reach safety, and you stop running and teabag, that reads like taking the L with good humor and I'll probably let you go for facing death like a champ.
---
exactly üòÇ
---
As an Ash main, I kinda try to be like Ash but without BMing the killer (I call it ‚Äòtaking liberties for the sake of not being a dickhead‚Äô). So, I‚Äôll try really ballsy plays that have no chance working out (but I‚Äôll do them anyway), but I‚Äôll also be more of a team player and focus on getting everyone else out before me (which more of an ‚Äòend of Season 3 thing‚Äô).
---
Well I notice ever since they made dedicated servers it takes me forever now to find a game and I'm on Xbox
---
Ash mains are the biggest Chad's in dbd.
---
As a Killer Main...
---
Fuck facecampers to hell and back. That shit is not only super aids for the Survivor, but it makes the game unbearably boring for all involved, doesn't get anyone many points, and it's a shit strat that basically guarantees that you'll lose unless the Survivors are idiotic. Outside of incredibly niche endgame situations, facecamping has no place in any respectable Killers play.
---
Your strategy could easily be countered with one simple button.
---
*Crouch*
---
*The BIGGEST*
---
Mad cuz bad lol
---
Toolboxes and Exhuastion Perks are fine. Gen Speed in general is a bit of an issue, but not Toolboxes specifically. The only Exhaustion Perks that are even somewhat controversial are Dead Hard and Adrenaline, and so Exhaustion as a whole is fine.
---
Map Design however is by far the biggest issue. The issues you raised for the Killer perspective are very true; multiple maps still have overly powerful god-loops, and disgusting jungle gym setups, but the problem is a double-edged sword for both sides.
---
Map RNG is a shambles. Multiple maps can end up being both heavily Killer or Survivor sides simply based off of ban RNG.
---
You can end up with a map that has a god window, connected to a godly Jungle Gym and then the shack, in the middle of the map, and the setup is just too strong for the Killer to handle, but get the same map with a configuration so bad, that an entire quadrant can become a death zone for Survivors because 1 pallet got eaten.
---
Map variance needs to be toned down across the board, as configurations on either side of the extreme can be truly unwinnable for whichever side had the trash RNG.
---
I always see it light up, but then I go "Ah whatever, he's not going to me, it was just a small random flick"
---
I would be more happy with something like:
---
If a healthy survivor is hit by the hatchet, he's becoming injured with deep wound effect, and if he's injured, he's put to dying state
---
I believe 'The King' a popular Dbd YouTuber asked Cote in an interview with release of stranger things about acknowledgment of the gen speed, and Cote literally just shipped the question off, saying " I don't really know about that, maybe ask one of our technical guys" this guy is literally the lead designer. 
---
It kinda shows they have no idea how high level play is, when you look at trailers or showing off a new killer power, you always see the Survivors move like potatoes, and are always walking and sneaking around as if players do that. It's more like they're balancing the game for how they want people to play, as apposed to how they actually play.
---
Nah, it's Beneke running around yelling "I FUCKED YOUR WIFE DICKBAG"
---
I main Yui because I'm a slut.
---
lol I'm only here for retarded killers who thrive on NOED and Moris complaining about survivors having crutches hahaha
---
Playing against SWF can be great when you get that super altruistic squad that spends more time bodyblocking, unhooking, and going for bold plays that doing gens. Since they, by nature, give you more time to work and actually play the game and have a challenging, but engaging time.
---
Playing against SWF can be extremely aids when you get that super optimized squad that has 3 people working on Gens the second you chase anyone anywhere, and runs all the second chance perks that stop you from actually getting anywhere so you just have to roll over and lose in the 5 minutes it takes for them to finish the gens and leave.
---
Hey, I own all licensed killers except for Demo, Freddy and Ghostface, yet ONLY get Freddy splinters. Like, why.
---
This is from last year -_-
---
This a perfectly normal image of a survivor and killer being merry and joyful during Christmas
---
For the love of god stop with this shit already...
---
Because veteran Killers are good enough to track blood without needing Bloodhound to see the blood, and newer Killers probably won't be rushing to grab the Wraith's teachables so most of them don't have it.
---
Plus there's just better perks for general tracking. Nurse's outclasses Bloodhound in most situations for finding an injured Survivor.
---
It‚Äôs not toxic, it‚Äôs a badge of a lesser skilled player.
---
Yes, my favorite part in the dbd manga
---
Wholesome ghostface
---
Unsure if this falls under the rules but crossplay between windows pc and steam? Is this a thing and how would one go about setting up a party?
---
It's not as Killer-sided as some say, but The Game is still absolutely Killer-sided. Not only do the stats suggest this, as the Game has one of the top 3 Kill% but also because it is an incredibly small map, which inherently benefits the Killer as it allows them to have  a lot more map pressure, which generally outweighs the higher no. of safe pallets.
---
Best looking survivor period
---
Your just lucky with your potatoe wifi
---
This is false. You are affected by your own prove thyself if someone else is on a gen with you
---
I love it when the game gives you shit perks at the beginning. I didn‚Äôt get bbq and Corrupt for Ghostface until level 48. And at level 3 they gave me insidious for him. Like...... game! Why?
---
Also only killer to have survivors sabotage his power. 
---
Imagine Billy having to find all parts for his chainsaw to build it before he can use it, then the survivors can just steal the parts before you get to them. Or let aurvivors pull hatchets out of locker and throw them.
---
As long as Moris and NOED exists, killers have nooooooothing to complain about. Get good lol, real simple.

I mean... It IS a basic hatchets, but if you hit a healthy survivor, he's not onlu becoming injured, but he also gets Deep Wound status effect
---
Just to waste his time on mending, instead of progressing generators
---
A lot of killers didn‚Äôt wanna become slashers. They still did.
---
I mean... It IS just a basic hatchets, but if you hit a healthy survivor, he's not only becoming injured, but he also gets Deep Wound status effect
---
Oh! I was thinking of the perk wake up
---
As someone who has been grinding out points since month one, NO. Nobody is allowed to complain about bloodwebs anymore.
---
Old Freddy's power allowed him to tag Survivors in front of him with his ability. Survivors started the trial awake, and COULD NOT see Freddy at all, only hearing his lullaby when he was near. Once he tagged them, they could see him and they would enter the Dream World after 7s at base. 
---
Once Survivors entered the Dream World, a few things changed
---
- Freddy could hit and block the Survivor, as he could not interact with them in any way if they were awake, outside of locker grabs.
---
- The Survivor received a 50% penalty to all Action Speed at base while asleep
---
- The Survivor's aura was revealed to Freddy when they were asleep and outside of the Terror Radius.
---
Survivor's could escape the Dream World in the same ways as today, except minus the alarm clock, and with ally Wake Up actions not getting longer with repeated use.
---
Freddy could tag Survivors without slowing down much, and had no limit on how much or how often he tagged Survivors, he could tag any awake Survivor in range, and his power had a decent reach that could be enhanced with add-ons. Unfortunately, every time he tagged someone, he had to wait for the 7 second transition period every time, in which case most Survivors would bolt for the nearest window or pallet, so he wouldn't get the free hit most stealth killers get, and his power had no value in the chase, so he relied on making the game take fucking ages so he could slowly chase and hook people, which rarely worked out given most Survivors would wake up quickly via Self-Care or a gen skill Check to remove the speed debuff, and trying to keep everyone asleep was rarely efficient enough to get you much extra chase time.
---
Amazing art op! Hope you draw more dbd its so cute :D
---
Why she look like shrek
---
Ghost face is the best in my opinion, stealth and one shot power also canny forget the ability to teabag
---
No i think i am right, thrill says gain 10 MORE bloodpoints for actions in the hunter category, you get more bloodpoints for the actions meaning the max goes above 8k
---
Distressing says gain 100% MORE bloodpoints for actions in the deviousness category
---
So i think it did x2 to my deviousness and that was an in game bonus, not an after game bonus like bp streamers and the bp streamers multiplied by thrill and distressing
---
I just want head on üò≠
---
I just got back into the game personally, so I'm around rank 15 killer. So far on PS4 the survivors I've faced have not been able to escape. The last game I just played a Bill finally managed to leave because I hit the door open so the match would finally be over. So I'd say he's worth it, he's a more fun version of Myers in my opinion.
---
You said please stop spreading false Info like he did it on purpose. Most likely he just got cells and shards mixed up and anyone with a brain would know what he meant
---
Inception intensifies
---
Shmichael myers over silly mechanic bouncy boyo anyday. Myers definitely exhibits BDE
---
What rank are you? Because te n minutes is legit the upper limit on my games.
---
&gt; *I guess if you're not very good at map presence, you run ruin then?*
---
It's not *just* about map presence, or even just map pressure.
---
Killers that require "setup" (Trapper, Hag, Myers, Pig, and Plague) can buy the time required by running either Ruin or Corrupt Intervention.
---
Killers that lack a mobility power may even benefit more from Corrupt Intervention than Ruin, as the former effectively reduces the game area, allowing them to play to their strengths - the benefit is greater the more "lethal" your killer. Bubba, for example, can easily have a survivor hooked during Corrupt Intervention, and this forces the remaining survivors to make a hard choice between getting the unhook or hoping they can rush a gen outside of Bubba's patrol area.
---
Consider that competent survivors are knocking out a pair of gens every 44 seconds or less - you can't chase them all.
---
Writing like that seems that Freddy was forever Freddy on steroids and without chase potential, thanks!

I had kindred too but i still got to stage 2 while they loitered around. But it gets worse. One guy got hit far from me yet still brought the killer to my area. Then another cant even sneak to the basement. She unhooked me right in front of the killer just so i could get hit again immediately after and die.
---
NoED is taking a handicap for most of the game to (3/4 perks) to backload your power to close out the endgame if the survivors get that far.
---
There isn't such a thing as "justifying" camping. Its not right or wrong it's just a choice.
---
 I don't care if you proxy camp at the end of the game. But if you are going to stay 4 meters in front of the hook at the end of the game or just camp with every single hook then you're just a boosted killer 
---
That's why old BT was so good. It forced killers to think ahead over the entire game and not just recycle survivors on hook. Survivors used to be able to easily punish killers who proxy camp and then have a stroke in the end game chat and say "it's a strategy I'm good"
---
As well as u/zadeyboy's answer, consider the time of year. I know that I've personally been spending 1/4 to 1/3 of my games this month dicking around to some extent as Santa Clown.
---
Pretty much, although the fact that Freddy had to find each Survivor and sleep them individually to get the slowdown going meant that his slowdown wasn't even that great. Forever Freddy today is honestly more consistent thanks to the Red Paint Brush putting everyone to sleep at the start (on old Freddy it reduced his Terror Radius heavily in the Dream World and his movespeed, creating a jumpscare Myers-esque build)
---
oh boy
---
Dwight is in a pickle!
---
Ah okay so no plans have been said for any upscales or anything for 60fps or nothing just the back compatibility (as far as we know) ?
---
Okay I just didn't celebrate this year due to family lol but I will 2020!! :]
---
Imagine having negative comment karma
---
You better tag me! Merry Christmas and new years eve!
---
Imagine they make the shrine every perk in the game
---
Does anyone have any advice for a new player (killer)  I‚Äôve been building up my confidence to play since the last time I tried.
---
If its a m1 killer like clown, trapper or Doctor I Will get rid of all these totems ASAP
---
Well the thing here is, even though I'm over-analysing stuff, that 3 of Legion members are not even killers by nature and the only one who likes Susie is Julie. Frank and Joey have pretty much jackshit to do with her, Julie is more or less just following Frank around and although it is said that Susie is her friend, we don't know for sure if she truly cares for her. Joey sure as hell wouldn't give a damn about Susie, he's just Frank's lapdog. Only Frank is quick to act violently and strategically, Joey wouldn't act unless told so by Frank (who again gives like 0 shits about Susie), and Julie might try to defend Susie but her fighting skills are unknown. Frank used to do basketball and I believe it was said that Joey was pretty strong, so these two are the ones with a good chance in any fight, even though Frank is a total twig (as seen in his Halloween cosmetic).
---
So there's like 1 member who'd actually fight in this scenario and that member is a teenage gal whose only experience is instinctively stabbing an off-guard cleaner. Not to mention I can see "bullying the Legion" being considered a team sport in the Entity's realm and everybody just sprinting into action whenever there's a chance to bully the edgy kids. And if it wasn't, you'd still have to also consider the methods of killing these use. Julie has a knife and her secret power is just being fast...with the knife. That's all she has and all she can do. She is small in stature but presumably very agile and can easily evade attacks. Kenneth has a knife and some weirdass concoctions that fuck you up and he can throw these. He is tall and allegedly physically strong (seemingly by nature since he could run fast as hell when he was a kid so I guess it's a natural talent) but presumably slow and bad at evading. He has more experience with killing than her, although his victims were always off-guard too. I'd say it's a pretty 50/50 chance, with the concoctions spinning the odds in Kenneth's favour.
---
Afaik they only mentioned the backwards compatibility. But with the new hardware it's possible for that to happen.
---
Hey guys I‚Äôm new. What do the shards do, I‚Äôve never heard of them before.
---
Wait I just have to use Ruin and I become a red rank killer?
---
The approximately 468th pickle he‚Äôs been in with Susie!
---
Funny when I play survivor I get much higher rank killers and get crushed.
---
I didn‚Äòt stop the time, I just felt like 10-20 minutes is a good amount of time for a game
---
That's not ultra rare
---
That‚Äôs a great idea actually
---
That's a pretty good change. Playing around one hatchet is actually pretty fun
---
''Oops silly me''
---
Your missing my point entirely. The build this guy is running is as if he wants to play at high ranks. Ruin is a part of that yes but it‚Äôs the whole build he‚Äôs running that is my point. Like really? Ruin at 17? Your playing against potatoes there‚Äôs no need for it.
---
A wild toxic survivor has appeared!
---
You must be a supervillian or something
---
But remember is against a clown, who yes killed victims but, not by choking them, or anything really strongly, like smashing them barehand, and even if i get your point, the legion cares sbout eachother, in those kinda groups, even if you were the most useless, you still part of the group
---
Also fun fact, devs confirmed that killere can't find eachother in the realm, if im not wrong, the entity modify the mist so they cannot find eachother, or you would have a blood oath, for example, while this time is clown vs legion, try to think of myiers vs oni, or spirit vs hillybilly
---
This is entirely intentional by the Devs. If you‚Äôre between rank 16-20 then you can get matched with any ranks.
---
Yeah  I completely agree. Had to deal with 5 keys  out of 6 games as a killer earlier believe it or not and all of them were keys that could open the hatch. Could barely even tell the survivors had them. 
---
I think nerfing both moris and keys would do the game a lot of good.
---
How will matter of faith work against borrow time?
---
The ppl on xbox are so idiotic. "You tunneled me!!" Even after protecting the recently person that unhookeed you with BT. Buddy you ran towards me. Also if they were good swf they would know how to counter a camp at end game. 1v1 trades with ds.
---
as killer you always get higher ranked survivors.
---
As survivor you always get put with lower ranked survivors.
---
I really hate their matchmaking
---
I notice that yeah, it's all good. My matchmaking point got some attention anyway. But not like it might change anything.
---
Because for every lobby out there that rushes gens and flies out the exit gate in under 3 minutes, there seems to be two lobbies where the killer just takes Ruin, Pop and tunnels their way to victory before the survivors can finish any more than 2 gens.
---
You‚Äôve seen the stats. The devs consider their game ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù as killers are on average getting at least two kills. The problem is the gulf between good and mediocre/weak survivors is quite large. How can they justify making the gens longer when most survivors are being sacrificed?
---
Its not like a fps where the game is balanced as most sides are equal. Dbd is asymetrical. Survivors are weak and get smashed until they learn to loop and most importantly - be aggressive on gens, and plow through Ruin.
---
Until they learn the latter, to attack gens like a rabid dog then they lose. The problem then becomes when they do learn this it renders a lot of the low/mid tier killers useless.
---
The rank 17 spirit who has already mentioned that they played the game before, mind you.
---
but even if you do takes the time to cleanse the totem whenever you find them, there is a chance that there is a last well hidden totem who will become noed lol
---
*you have to kill 4 obsessions but no one runs DS for once‚Äù 
---
Hmm idk I guess the only obsession perk is DS nvm
---
Le snak
---
The counter-play can be applied before it's too late since all of them notify you the perk or power is active. NOED is passive until the killer succeeds in using it, only then we know its there. 
---
Looking at it from a logical perspective, with a killer at 119% speed and 1 shot M1 with much fewer pallets available and less objectives from the killer, it just doesn't make sense to risk looking and doing the totem then, or go for the save when it's clear the killer can easily domino.
---
Doing totems during the game is a waste of time but there's no excuse for it in SWF with comms and information. You can't persuade 4 randoms that it is crucial to do totems each game because there is a chance that the killer has the perk. More often than not, at least one player will need to be left to die.
---
You know being a low rank survivor doesn't mean you've just started playing the game right?
---
Still shit, before hand shit, been gone a long time. What was i thinking using these perks anyway man damn /s
---
Holy fuck calm down.
---
Rank is skill not experience.  Dont confuse the two.
---
It's still pretty bullshit but at least it requires semi decent aim to use
---
You know that a rank 17 killer with experience and perks&gt;Rank 17-20 baby survivor teams?
---
Experience+Perks&gt;Uncoordinated baby survivor team any day by a landslide.
---
Fuck off man you want him to only have 1 perk? Should under rank 10 only be players who have less than 20 games total?
---
Not sure why you got downvoted, I had a Yui do this to me; she was on death hook right outside the killer shack and I had been doing a 3-gen with PGTW; she was going to be the first death, and despite no obsessions I had been going for fresh targets each time (gotta keep them salt-free so no disconnects).
---
As I'm picking her up, before I even finish the animations, she quits.
---
For fuck's sake.
---
I remember I had a game as plague where one person insta-dc'd after getting puked on in the first ten seconds, and another person left after making the genius decision to hide directly in front of me while being stinky and getting caught. Felt bad so I followed the two remaining survivors around and let them do all the gens.
---
Should be full time additions. They have yet to ever add cosmetics for a limited time.
---
How are they babies? They are red rank.
---
You're really butthurt about this. If the killer really doesn't belong at that rank, maybe they should I don't know, rank up
---
Especially on the Yamaoka, Swamp, or indoor maps? Yeah, definitely. That sucks, but part of the game, beyond learning how to loop and hold M1 next to generators, is learning where totems spawn. Bring maps, Detective's Hunch, Small Game, etc. and it's easy to find bones if NOED's that much of a concern, y'know?
---
"Territorial" doesn't mean "walk to a corner of the map with no gens just to gain the privilege of using your ability." Walking around to an area with no Survivors to chase is worse than setting up every trap in the first 5 seconds - and is a great way to get genrushed.
---
I love this so much!!! I‚Äôd love to see more
---
Holy shit, lets think for a moment. He obviously didnt anticipate a red rank team, otherwise he wouldn't be complaining. He anticipated baby survivors and had this build in mind.
---
One hides like a bitch while the other stares you down.
---
I only say ez when I lose as a joke.
---
You're right, they should rank up. Not stay at rank 17 being a tryhard and then complaining when they get a taste of their own medicine.
---
Oh i'm not complaining against it, it makes the game more intense sometimes even though it feels bad when you're the first one getting smacked with NoeD
---
Bullshit.  Skill matters, not perks,

Doesn't make much sense but ok
---
I appreciate the effort you put into this comment
---
Sure they always gave us those useless firecrackers, but they used to put some presents in the bloodweb also, among some other small things. As to the ugly Nea cosmetics, I can only nod in agreement and add that Claudette has (in my opinion) even worse skins.
---
Spine Chill, You can sometimes avoid being seen at all. Also when you loop him when he's in stalk mode you just need to count that your skill will help you. Also When you drop pallet on Ghosty he will lose his stalk mode
---
Your just salty and have no concept of ranking.
---
he is a sadsnail99 after all
---
Rank 17 killers typically play against rank 15s-20s. The survivors are usually playing against killers that are so bad they whiff when you run sideways. Now, suddenly, they meet a killer who knows where they are, isn't a bot, and now they can't hit skillchecks that even red rank survivors can't hit 100% of the time. Learning experience? Yes. But again, complaining is the issue here.
---
I understand your sentiment, but that's not the point here. The point is that the matchmaking is dogshit.
---
Yes I play survivor also, I dont play that way I try to get chased run try to dodge. If a killer is camping then you punish him by going to do a gen? Or group up and go save your teammate. There are ways of punishing the mistake. Its still okay if he does it because there is a counter to it.
---
I mean, I'm just saying that's the vibe I got from the answer. I'm a trapper main and never had any problems.
---
You're certainly entitled to your incorrect opinion.
---
Steve
---
I'm baffled that every thread I come across with your input in condescending form such as posting links to questions that were previously asked, or complaining like this one. If it bothers you that much it is your problem.
---
I could make so many dbd memes with this format.
---
So, I see your viewpoint ever so slightly, but when the survivors have had plenty of time to play and have done well against good killers, the fuck do perks matter for an inexperienced killer?  Hell, his ruin probably didn‚Äôt fucking matter at all in many matches because the supposed baby survivors have a brain cell and can look for a totem or mindlessly do a gen with ruin skill checks.
---
If he hides the red stain, just run for the next jungle gym, in the opposite side
---
All rise motherf....
---
Dbd has quite a hardcore base. A lot of people have a lot of time on the game.
---
Once you get camped/tunneled a thousand times over it becomes really annoying.
---
Predict aways stay away from corners and play unpredictable I never have to much of a problem with stealth killers because I like aways rub Spine Chill
---
Yeah this is what happened. Thanks for the video and the explanation.
---
Isn‚Äôt he the same speed when he activates his power to hide his red stain?
---
I think the problem is just that the hitboxes linger too long.
---
Yeah, this guy is simultaneously complaining about matchmaking and abusing it at the same time. How is that not hypocrisy?
---
Any survivor that has the balls to bitch about an endgame open exit gate camp is straight entitled clown shoes.  You'll never have a leg to stand on complaining as a survivor in that scenario.  Ignore them.  These dudes are far and few between and just utter memes.  99% of survivors get it and wouldn't dream of complaining in that specific camp scenario.  It sucks but they understand it and why you have to do it.
---
I must have played cold wind farm 15 fucking games yesterday. Did not work out for me lol
---
Everyone is saying that they're easy. What rank are you? I'm rank 5 killer and every match I get 4 survivors tha1
---
I just got the game at the beginning of December and I was hoping to start into a Christmas event
---
It sounds like survivors can do whatever to win killers have to go by rules? Or are there things survivors arent supposed to do?
---
Dweet
---
Read in samnimations Da-wihite
---
Spine chill
---
So I understand that their red ranks, but this is pretty fucking good for match making right now
---
I saved all my on my Lauri
---
How can i be smurfing when this is legit the rank the game gave me when i was gone for god knows how long. Even before i was gone i never went against a rank 4. That shit is beyond what i can do.
---
And even with the perks i got now, im still not rolling on anyone. Does this mean im dogshit, maybe :D but as metallord said, my point went towards the matchmaking. And as a rank 17, even if i had beforehand expirience. This should not be a thing. 
---
Maybe it is something the devs should think about when balancing matchmaking. Thats people  that have been gone along time still hold their rank or some shit. But for now this was utter trash dude.
---
I open ur eyes
---
We have a new killer hinted at in the revalaition logs.
---
Okay, its like crazy though I am all the way back to level 13 because trying to play "fair" whatever that means, but I get no "fair" there has to be some balance . Like can't just be killers can't do this survivors can do whatever. Otherwise yeah people get angry when both sides dont have rules.
---
I just played a 30+ min game on springwood yesterday at rank 1. Killed 2 people with 5 gens left infinite T3 mikey and the last 2 proceeded to just hide. Didnt do gens, and I had no whispers or anyway to find them on that huge map.
---
Finally got 1 and saw the other with bbq but games can certainly go past 10mins if the survivors want it to.
---
I downvoted your commentüòé
---
Flying dweet
---
OOH DEAR GOD
---
Do you remember what it was for ?
---
No it goes to 5
---
BC people wanna win and playing as survivor requires ur team to do something and people in dbd can't admit mistakes a lot of players lack that.
---
I suggest just saying gg in the post game and the leaving, or you can just have it closed, and never see the chats. Third option is to laugh at their salt because they try to excuse mistakes as your fault
---
I've never done this anyway this challenge I'm not even gonna attempt it's asking too much :/
---
This has already been acknowledged by devs that the matchmaking system is not functioning properly and is matching based off incorrect rank.  
---
That dude Desecutor or whatever his name is posted an official Dev response on here yesterday about it.
---
Uhhh no you dont, there is a limit of like 5 ranks or something that you can be matched with normally matchmaking is just fucked rn
---
Holy cow I‚Äôm bad lol
---
Do vids BC u like them not BC others should
---
Above rank 15 yes, but below they just expanded it for everyone as so few players are rank 15-20
---
True, for now i still need to change some perks. This was just the build i came back in after being gone a long while. 
---
Also i did wait a long time for the queue, so that might be it too.
---
Camping in frowned upon in everygame. Often used by less experienced players for easy kills. In DBD its used in like 90% of games until red ranks.
---
Survivors have a lot of rules many of which are stupid, however if you put a lot of time into survivor then you will see first hand how much camping/tunneling ruins the game for everyone else.
---
As for survivors, I guess abusing broken loops like Abbatoir if its open. Guess you cant play them since its in the game but the devs should be fixing broken loops like these. If a survivor abuses a god loop then can expect to be camped/tunneled. Its what Marth88 used to do. These loops ruin the fun for killer as there is no counterplay unless you brought bamboozle
---
Also survivors shouldnt tbag.
---
Do keep in mind though that this killer has prior experience. See, where some survivors on the team may have some semblance of skill and experience, you have to consider there are 4 survivors on one team and one weak link breaks the chain, 2 is just overkill. Matchmaking at his rank USUALLY includes rank 20-15s just as it can include maybe one rank 13 or 12.
---
This is adorable
---
Bro your the killer you control the game you can do whatever you want theres a counter to camping, survivors can run ds or borrowed and they can body block theres no unfair advantage let them fear you you shouldn‚Äôt fear them
---
Is anyone gonna tell him? Lmaooo
---
Just the one killer, actually.
---
"That serious"? Not disconnecting and wasting 4 other people 20 minutes (thanks queue time) is taking the game too seriously for you?
---
Putting the survivor aspect aside, it‚Äôs so more satisfying when you are crushing them, chasing different survivors every time, you feel like a war machine, even if they manage to escape. It‚Äôs better to play this way than chasing the 4K every match, trust me. Feel the power!!!
---
Ultra-rares btw
---
Im 100% with you. It feels as if a good amount (not all of them ofc) have a hard time catching people or knowing when to quit chase. I played against a doc couple of days ago who decided to chase me for 3 gens untill he finally left me. A few games later I get another one who tunneled me and eventually moried me, but it took him almost the entire game. A pattern I've noticed is that they seem to misjudge the distance they can lunge and hit. D: I feel really bad for them aswell, I can only imagine the frustration after chasing for that long.
---
The last one is always baffling to me. Why do survivors think the killer should walk to the 99% exit gate? What does the killer get out of that? A lot of people that play this game are absolutely braindead.
---
So *that‚Äôs* why I can‚Äôt feel anything!
---
You thinking he's abusing matchmaking is an assumption. Based on the given facts there's no reason to think he's doing this deliberately with malicious intent. He's likely trying to rank up quicker.
---
There‚Äôs obviously so much you could say as advice, but I think some really important tips are: Pay attention to your surroundings (gens, crows flying off, sounds of injured survivors, pallets and loops), don‚Äôt be afraid to take a pallet stun (survivors can get greedy and this gets you a hit), and don‚Äôt be afraid to lose! It‚Äôs just a game after all. There‚Äôs no issue with trying new perks out or new strategies, everyone starts somewhere.
---
Why are you using the sarcastic meme against something that‚Äôs true??? It‚Äôs true the Entity is a literally eldrich god and you find it ludicrous that it could grant super strength also it‚Äôs stated multiple times in lore that the survivors are killed instantly if they fight back
---
The game would never put you with people 13 ranks away from your rank normally no matter what, matchmaking is fucked and that's it
---
The face looks odd, but otherwise everything else is fine.
---
Might scare those people disconnecting all the time a bit longer if it's stay pinned... So that's good.
---
So the people who are supposed to be the best are going against the newest and most likely the worst, and that‚Äôs okay? Perks wouldn‚Äôt matter if there is a massive skill gap, a small one would allow perks to help greatly, but it‚Äôs rank 4s who already face that shit and can counter it easily
---
Did they change Thrilling Tremors recently to allow killers to kick gens while the perk is protecting them?
---
It was a locker thing (?), i don't understand what actually triggered it ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2d91TliOys&amp;t=299s))
---
Object of obsession good luck pal ‚ô•
---
It's so fucking stupid but it's been around forever so most people are ok with it. (See: Ebonies / Keys)
---
How am i actually abusing it, if this is where i get put when ive been gone for so long. What the actual fuck.
---
Tree by daylight?
---
I agree, Guess I have to get better at finding them. They just run there is no chase so it gets boring. Some games are chase, but every time I get to level 10 I go vs level 5s 7s and they just do some of gen then hid in a bush.
---
I mean most of the time I'm just tabbed out playing Terraria or Dawn of War (orks 4 lyfe) or something because the queue times are so long. I just tab back in when the 'wooosh' sound from the game starting plays
---
Christmas lol.

Anyone who excuses what was in that video has got to be a fucking clown.
---
When I play against Freddy I switch my graphic settinga to Low because Dream World eats me 30 fps!
---
Holly shit i had forgotten how clunky it was
---
No, but it's definitely karmic justice, considering OP is simultaneously complaining about the matchmaking he's taking advantage of.
---
Did you just start playing really recently or something?  I face at least one rage quitting killer per session.
---
Its not even that they just make it up on the spot they are just trash salty guys who only try hard and t bag. I say fuck em I'll mori
---
However, in that situation, there is room for massive stupidity on the clown‚Äôs part.
---
You can crouch, yes, but in some situations you'll want to *run* and trigger as many as possible.
---
Hook saves are one such example - survivor A triggers the traps and runs the Hag a merry chase while survivor B gets the unhook. If the Hag is carrying a survivor it's *usually* a good time to pop traps like crazy since they can't punish you for it. If you're a confident survivor then you should be popping traps whenever you see another being chased.
---
Taking out the traps will cripple her mobility, and you can all take turns doing so. That's the easy part. The hard part for many survivors is successfully getting an unhook against her - most notably when the team are randoms and are either triggering traps the wrong way, or are convinced that they need to crouch to the edge of the map to heal.
---
And yet it does because so few people are in brown ranks. I cant argue with it, id rather have imbalanced matchmaking than 30 minute queue times. 
---
New players may as well get with the program, the games been out 3 years now.
---
I find it as an irritating plot excuse nonetheless; know it‚Äôs cannonly stated. Maybe it‚Äôs my disdain for the lore of killers like the legion. They didn‚Äôt do nearly enough to be here and don‚Äôt seem to fit the bill.
---
Fun fact, when healing with brown med-kit, if you miss one skill check, and then get 2 great ones you'll heal fully.
---
I'm purple rank and I'm either matched with a green killer (and sometimes yellow), or a red killer. ALWAYS. I'm not going to say I was never matched with a purple killer because I might have forgotten, but I seriously can't remember how long it has been since I was matched with a killer around my rank...
---
So, I'm pretty something is really wrong with the matchmaking system right now
---
Every killer *ideally* plays differently, so which one are you using?
---
Lol, based on the given facts, OP is a former higher rank player with perks and experience and using a top tier killer at rank 17, and complaining that matchmaking was unfair. You decide for yourself what that means, Atticus.
---
We kill they survive, whats so difficult as they show no mercy so I'll end their "fun" toxic scum who t bag and are trash
---
wow, he used noed escapes death? what a scum /s
---
Crossplay is definitly a thing-theres an option in the settinga to enable/disable it- but im unsure if crossplay parties are possible
---
It was my first game as the trapper, and im sure i didnt place them like that on purpose, i know i put atleast 3 traps on different generators.
---
Yes, but he will wait for you to loop him, and lose him...when you are running to the next jungle gym, you have the opportunity to track him again...
---
1. Do the tutorial for both survivor and killer. 50,000 free bp. 
---
2. You're going to suck a lot until you start sucking less. Do not take it personally, even when you're being bullied by survivors tbagging and running rings around you. The best way to handle this is to treat games like practice. Make a list of goals (Improve gen protection, improve chases, improve power usage, etc) and when you start losing, focus on one of these things. In fact, it would be better if you went into a game with an objective goal like this, and focus on that period, as it's slower to improve as you play the game because there's so many plates you have to spin. If you stop worrying about Winning and think of it like training, it takes the pressure off. 
---
3. Don't camp. Unless all the gens are done, you're just shooting yourself in the foot by camping.
---
Wait where did you find the english version?
---
Yeah screw it, edited to add a slight increase to map size to compensate!
---
PC and steam are the same thing. PC uses steam.
---
Why is this upvoted so much? Yes, it's a problem, but it has nothing to do in this thread.
---
This do not happen that often at all like you are stating. The first DC penality is so small it doesn't even matter, you'll literally jump back into queue right away.
---
Yeah, let me have it tbh, idc. Im not gonna spend my time waiting for them to win tho lol
---
Huh. I only ever heard of this glitch with with shards. I have every dlc bought directly from steam and never had this glitch, ever.
---
Did you buy all the dlc directly from steam?
---
Every gen that gets complete extends egc. Every hook lowers it.
---
Maybe he did want to demolish survivors. But the rest is conjecture. He did not show any signs of being toxic, so therefore he could've just as easily been trying to rank up as quickly as possible to get back to where he belongs. OP is right to be pissed at the matchmaking for denying him the chance to do so by pairing him up with red rank survivors, and the fact that seasonal deranks bring old time killers to noob level ranks is silly in its own right. At most one should derank to midranks, not noob ranks.
---
Well what I am saying is it seems they call anything camping. Me being where most of them are should not be considered camping. My job as the killer is to find the survivors right? If they all around the same person where am I supposed to go? I go where they are. Maybe the definition of camp needs to be explained to me or them.
---
you should definitely try this subreddit[r/dadbydaylight](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight)
---
Am friends with /u/shahid0317 , can confirm he's just shit
---
Maybe we‚Äôll finally get that optimization patch BHVR mentioned last year
---
Yea but mostly i meant how they‚Äôre both cut down the middle
---
Actually, when you read his backstory, he was a high level athlete who took up murder and a disguise. He is realistically, by back story alone, what probably should be one of the strongest and fastest killers.
---
Yeah I started that. And if there is a way to close the chat then heck yeah. I camp from league and I just /muteall so if there is a way let me know.
---
you should definitely try [this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight)
---
Use perks to help your track...Whispers, BBQ, discordance, surveillance, nurses, etc....it‚Äôs crucial to know where to go after a hook...in mid-chases, try to get what gens are being worked and go for them after the hook...
---
Killer has a mori.  So I assume you're in full support of killers DC'ing over keys?  Surely you're not a hypocrite right?  You're down with it?
---
So because i was gone for a while i should just not use the perks i had before hand, not want to play against the ranks i should be playing while my skill level has clearly dropped. 
---
And somehow u have gotten it in your mind that i'm abusing this system deliberatly. AND! that i am demolishing new player? 
---
Man u must be a phsychic cuz that was spot on /s. 
---
U have no idea that even at rank 17 with brown / yellow / white ranks im still losing some and winning some. But u didnt think of that. U just think i'm this high tier killer going mad on their booty's. :D i wish baby.
---
Cheers, Merry Christmas :)
---
And you get achievements for completing these and escaping the match.
---
Finger Licking good XD
---
haha yeah sounds familiar ;)
---
DC is one of the worst dick moves in this game. Not just against the killer, since strenght is in numbers when you're playing survivor, is a shitty thing to do to your teammates too. I've never DC, even in my worst matches, I even prefer running up to the killer and tease him until I get hooked, and that's only when I'm the last one and can't find the hatch or when I'm playing with a friend and we're both done with the match (usually when the rest of the team are already dead, or worst enough, ragequit DC). It's a shitty crybaby move and there should be more penalties for it.
---
:)
---
As of recent, *crush survivors with Oni club* "BAM BAM!"
---
New killer : Ebenezer Scrooge
---
Just figuring out how to loop, what are the best perks for a beginner looper as a survivor.
---
I tried to mori you once as I popped one on just for you and you escaped. I was sad.
---
yeah that defo wasnt my best game. thank you alot for the feedback. what kind of software is best for editing coz im going to get a new pc soon. grabbing always confuses me because sometimes it grabs when u just wanted a wack but when you want a grab it only lets you wack. for a first game as wraith id say it went alright. i normally can do loops better guess it was just one of them days. again thank you, merry chistmas :) ps i only just realised its 2morrow
---
A different queue for nobody to be in, awesome!
---
Nice, but sprintburst and coldwind...
---
Oh yeah... with the 1 minute penalties, of course...
---
Yeah I f*cking hate keys. Had 5/6 games with them in today. Problem is I can never see them in the pregame lobby
---
Just a personal opinion that actual powers and strengths should carry. The legion doesn‚Äôt boast much uniqueness but then again, my opinion. If you look at it all the killers got their power from the entity, just some more than others.

Now you just need 100 offerings for Leri's or the game.

Well what was it? Because tbh, there seems to be a problem with the core mechanics of the game. 
---
I‚Äôm gonna play more before writing anything down but the game has a problem with the way that both sides go about their objectives. 
---
There‚Äôs something wrong when a game this fun has queue time issues and dodgers left and right. I haven‚Äôt been able to pin point it.
---
Lol come on man be real say what happened.  You were trash camping them with your Insidious.  The scores tell us all the details you're leaving out lol.  Looks like you played like filth hence the post game bm.
---
In that case you'd need to sit down and look at *your* loadout at *your* rank, and how *you* handle the likes of Coldwind Farm and Red Forest. If your approach doesn't tally up with other players then you'll have answered your own question.
---
Yea but so what, people d/c anyway for any reason
---
You aren't gonna die or lose money or something serious dude
---
It's JUST a challenge, I don't get why people are so stressed out about these
---
Finish it in 2025 if it stresses you out so much, wtf ?
---
when youre a bad killer and cant find someone before they unhook you might as well just walk back.  Only having 3 people makes the game easier, anyways
---
We need to talk about [this](https://www.reddit.com/user/KahPark/comments/ef3ia8/we_need_to_talk_about_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)...

I feel like the Jeff one would have happened pre killers after he did the mural
---
First time I've played in about 6 months so back to rank 20 haha
---
I want to play nurse but I‚Äôve been told to start with trapper.
---
I just realized now it goes right to left, not the other way. I read the first one the other way around and was slightly confused.
---
It's truly bizarre. Like, yes, let me go walk to an exit gate which, best case scenario, has 3 survivors sitting there teabagging and waiting for me. Worst case, it's 99% and there's nobody to be seen, which means I've just given up my hook for nothing.
---
I agree with that, but that‚Äôs a flaw of the ranking system. Honestly they should have done away with resetting ranks, especially as often as they do. Then again rank 18 killer queue is like 30 mins right now for some reason, they should probably just do away with ranks altogether. Just pair people by average BP Per match or something
---
I wish. I literally made my name ‚ÄúMori_If_Ur_Horni‚Äù and i barely ever get mori‚Äôs anymore. Makes me so sad my friends HATED playing with me because our killers would always just be straight savages lol.
---
Or Hawkin's.
---
It was said ages ago that it'll be changed. We don't have info on how, but it will certainly happen when Anna gets item reworks to have the same number as other killers.
---
one guy called me once sweaty tryhard for using micheals tier 3...with no addons...God I love this community
---
you quite clearly facecamped
---
yeah I noticed I dont have the good perks yet, there is a sale now so guess I will buy the killers
---
Okay then. Btw, trapping gens isn't as effective as it might sound. Better trap popular juke points and popular routes around the map.
---
Christmas Eve and all they wanna do is wake up and smell the taint. *inhales deeply*

That's what I thought, eventhough I still say I am not camping
---
What killer has the smoking splinters?
---
Im all ears helps locate survivors, thrilling tremors helps slow down progress and locate survivors if you look at auras the others are more tracking perks which won't help.
---
Microsoft Store and Steam are different though, and require crossplay to be enabled.
---
Yeah i played too many hours of Friday The 13th where you put traps on cars and stuff. I was thinking the same with the gens, and i now know its not a good thing lol. Anyway thanks for the tip!
---
tier 40 :(
---
Safe to say that was probably their first and last game
---
Dude just main Freddy most fun you‚Äôll have and after how shit he used to be no nerfs for a long while
---
to give you a view of the other side, i have been trying to to this challenge for ages. every time someone dcs. i want to die
---
Yeah this is what I mean. I see crossplay enabled but no means to invite from either platform, I'm assuming now this is yet to be a thing
---
Too many features for them to implement, it‚Äôd take em a whole new roadmap for it lul
---
LOL see u in the fog then
---
Lol, let the gen rush commence!
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be bad tbf if queues weren‚Äôt so long.
---
Hahaha you got me there dude!
---
Only camped the one who was teabagging me the whole game for no reason
---
nope, you get achievements ofr completing the gen at the unique monument (usually center of map) and escaping, which is significantly easier, because when the killer enters the center, they don't block the only exit out of the map (exception is the stairs on thompson house, but they can't prevent you from finishing the gen  when standing there.
---
It's strange how this doesn't seem possible
---
What a rollercoaster of a story.
---
Even if you got the unhook the billy is standing right there and would have downed someone and with that said, I doubt the the Claudette had BT. She was also already injured so I doubt she wanted to go down. So Instead of doing gens the 2 of you are farming your teammate and get punished for it. You even had dead hard but you didn‚Äôt use it to bait out a hit. What most survivors don‚Äôt get is when a killer camps, DO GENS. If they aren‚Äôt playing the game they will get entity displeased for not doing anything.
---
I witnessed the poor man go through two wrong boxes and then immediately get downed after the second box with like 2 seconds left
---
My bad, disregard my comment.
---
oh well then idk, weird. Thought it was 15
---
Insightful advice as always Doc.
---
Closed off buildings still offer a challenge since your vision is limited.
---
If he ran PWYF, wouldn't that help him out a bit more?
---
This may be the best thing ever. Please more innocent Susie and Dwight
---
Better 1 hit down against a basic M1 killer then 2 hit down against a m2 killer with literally 0 defence and one of the strongest snowball potentials
---
I just double checked and yes, broken IS described as ‚ÄúCannot be healed‚Äù, period.
---
In that case they should specify that it merely disabled the Healthy state, like they specified the functionality of Mettle Of Man.
---
However, I disagree with the argument that adrenaline shouldn‚Äôt work on broken survivors. Adrenaline works like... well real life Adrenaline. It kinda pushes you through everything when you get it, both in game and real life.
---
It already ignores exhaustion due to this reasoning, don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt ignore the broken effect.
---
Well yes
---
Well since steam is an independent platform, we can still play DBD. However you can't find any steamer in China, this game get banned just as Mortal Combat and GTA V
---
Please don't ever stop, you're doing a great service
---
They probably were tbh every player is these days at least the experienced
---
He is still a baby inside
---
The greater good
---
Do you play on PS4? I played against someone with a similar name but didn't bring a mori because I figured it was bait haha.
---
Michael Myers
---
Stalk gang
---
Yeah there is.Id  say it‚Äôs pretty healthy  but  go for computer if you can.
---
If you're referring to not camping and tunneling as being fair than you should stick to that.  That playstyle only ranks you up so far.  It deranks you once you get out of potato ranks you're in now.  Hook them then leave to pressure gens.  That's the only way you'll consistently have success once you rank up high enough.
---
No that's the smoking one
---
It‚Äôs a swan
---
Yah, just the cornetto
---
He's one of the best killers in general imo
---
There's only a "counter" to it for the remaining survivors.  The person on the hook has no counter they are just there to die.
---
I only hit ready if i see all 4 survivors ready up when i'm playing killer
---
Reason being i have a moment to swap to huntress with iri and mori in case they try to pull off a last moment swap to 4 fully decked clauds with flashlights
---
Doesn‚Äôt overwhelming presence affect charges?
---
I thought that was Freddy's?
---

Nah more like 0-76
---
Honestly in general survivors that take the piss cant say shit if the killer plays dirty and gets 4ks always. You get what you deserve you know. Obviously I am not assuming OP is toxic but in general, toxicity can be defeated easily with any good killer playing dirty. Go after the weak link and the team crumbles.
---
As annoying as it is, game was almost over, could have just waited for them to leave, or ask someone to help you out.
---
Is this why I see Michael 3/5 matches. I myself play Michael but it seems lately there has been more Michaels.
---
I think the counter would be to use the loops that are on like every map, there are not many viable killers most can easily be outplayed from what I see. When I play vs 7-5 the ones that actually do a chase they loop the hell out me so there is no chance of a camp or tunnel.
---
Doctor rework? The pig needs it more she is the worst killer in the game rn.
---
Yeah I will , I also realized since I am playing all the killers now that most of them arent that good lol, so it is hard to keep pressure on some maps
---
That's the Buddhas chest, you can't have it.
---
Yeah I feel you, I few month ago I would wait literal hours for a killer lobby
---
Here are some I can think of. Definitely not an all inclusive list.
---
Windows of Opportunity (Kate teachable) - lets you see pallets and window vaults in your area. If gou're not familiar with the tile layouts, it's great for helping you plan out an escape route, even if you don't use a pallet or window. Once you learn how the jungle gyms can be set up, the perk really only helps show you if someone has already used a pallet.
---
Fixated (Nancy teachable) - helps you learn where your scratch marks show up, and increases your walking speed when healthy.
---
Lithe (Feng teachable) - gives you a speed boost when vaulting a window. It has an exhaustion cooldown, so can only be used once a chase. It's great for getting extra distance on the killer.
---
Quick and Quiet (Meg teachable) - lets you vault a window or get in to a locker quickly without making noise. Combined well with Lithe or Dance With Me. 
---
Dance With Me (Kate teachable) - prevents scratch marks after a window vault (i think for 3 seconds).
---
Dead Hard (David King teachable) - maybe a bit more of an advanced perk, DH allows you to extend a loop or avoid a killer's hit by ducking out of the way and giving a very short boost of speed. It's best used to give you extra distance to a pallet or window. The perk requires you to activate it with a button or key press, which requires a bit more skill/timing.
---
Run stake out, spine chill, bond and then whatever you want (i'd suggest sprint burst or some killer-aura perk) and you're fine :D
---
It's just the killer version of adrenaline. Do bones if you don't want to deal with it that badly or just leave when the gates open instead of being an ass. 
---
Well done on the post, very entertaining
---
Yeah but the weapon is pretty cool
---
Your proposed scenario was about a survivor being camped meaning there is no chase it ended already they're on a hook. 
---
And no this game isn't designed around being 1 hooked this is evidenced by the emblem penalties for camping as well as BP gain in general.  Losing a single chase doesn't mean much.  Claiming their counterplay is welp just don't get hooked is just silly man.
---
Ah, well that specifically affects item charges instead of speed so yes, i was saying more along the lines of mangled etc.
---
It's cool but also kinda looks like her face has gone through a content-aware scale.
---
Its not bad though! Keep it up!
---
I would think that honor goes to clown.
---
Franklings is a good perk against 4 items in general. Nothing personal, it just works.
---
Especially against keys btw.
---
‚ÄúRule #5 : The killer is not allowed to dc in matches‚Äù -The Survivor‚Äôs rulebook for killers‚Äù
---
Its not that they can‚Äôt find anyone, they don‚Äôt even look.
---
Matchmaking keeps putting me with green ranks so I guess that explains a lot. Funny I only get put with red rank survivors when I play killer :(
---
if u think they are dumb wait till u get to rank 3
---
Dark devotion don't hide your red stain, and fake docs doesn't have them.
---
Insidious does.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs not uncommon to toss out thematic consistency for balance. 
---
Similarly to how it makes sense that, if you have Balanced Landing, your stagger duration wouldn‚Äôt be contingent on exhaustion. Yet bc old Balanced Landing enabled borderline infinites, thematic consistency needed to be thrown out the window in favor of balance. 
---
Adrenaline is the best survivor perk in the game. And it‚Äôs even more powerful than its sister perk, NOED. Noed has counterplay and can be disabled before it has a chance to trigger. There is no way to stop Adrenaline aside from killing survivors. And when you don‚Äôt have NOED, Adrenaline can single handedly cost you the game. There needs to be more counterplay to Adrenaline. Just like there needed to be more counterplay to Noed. I‚Äôd be all for making the broken status disable the healing (or just make it so slugged survivors only get the speed boost when they‚Äôre picked up instead of both).
---
I‚Äôm not saying this as a salty killer main. At this point I play more survivor than killer. But I‚Äôve always kinda felt like Adrenaline is kind of BS. It‚Äôs the same as Noed. They both feel like absolute bullshit to play against if you don‚Äôt have their sister perk.
---
Its called Empathy and that's all it is, we know it isn't anything more than that because she can Self Care.
---
But... The one who is insutling someone is you...?
---
Definitely some killers are much better than others in terms of map pressure but at its core map pressure is a playstyle and just a frame of mind.  It can be done with all the killers it just takes a lot more effort to accomplish it with the likes of say a Clown or something.
---
Yes then I talked about what they call camping after that. I dont just sit by the hook. I try to move around but if I see them going for the hook I go towards it. If they unhook the guy twice or unhook each other. Am I supposed to just let them? Camping to me would be to sit and stair at the hook.
---
I NEED somthing like ruin or barbecue and chilli
---
Don't continue the loop, Run as far as you can because he's expecting to catch you off somewhere, Be unpredictable and don't fall for his games, because once you've ran away from the walls that stop you from seeing him you have a better view of him and can either reveal him or hide
---
There was no ‚Äúwhole game.‚Äù Unless you did literally nothing until that point, your total points can‚Äôt be from much more than 1 chase, 1 down, camp until they die and 2 DCs. You literally got 1200 from the DCs alone. You brought insidious knowing what you were gonna do that match and you did what insidious leatherfaces do, deal with the fact that people aren‚Äôt gonna want to play vs that no matter what rank they are.
---
Lots of players even more toxicicity
---
Yeah I am trying to prestige the killers I have, Freddy is ez , I play Ghost,Myers,And Cannibal at moment. I suck as Nurse even though I read she is best.
---
I like ghostyboi, but i love mikey. Fight me
---
I think getting out of a locker infront of killer
---
You guys are only losing ten frames?!
---
But for like one day. Christmas Day only.
---
Is it idk but MM isnt the glass one
---
He also doesn't need M&amp;A anymore so you can use another perk. It's a 50/50
---
yeah, but it doesn't mean myers can just stand in the doorframe, stalking you until he has tier 3 because you have nowehere to go.
---
The only gens that offer that are the haddonfield room gen (unless there is a window) and the gen in the Laboratory.
---
Why do i get ivory moris less often than ebony moris? I cant be the only one.
---
It is since BhVR is forcing its player base to play like evil toxic assholes to get a achievement accomplished. Hopefully with Tome ll they won‚Äôt be like this, but this is BhVR Interactive we are talking about.
---
Just to add to this. Don't run Lithe and Dead Hard together as they are both exhaustion perks.
---
It's very populated but once you get into higher ranks, the toxicity is off the charts. Lots of BM but if that doesn't bother you, then definitely go for it.
---
Nah m8 pc :( i wish they had crossplay. Always bring the mori!!! It makes the game extra fun when i can clearly see extra effort beingput into get me. Almost like a protect the mvp kinda game it‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Yeah I had 4 blendetts and I was legion. When I did see someone and hit them they vanished and when I used frenzy I was surrounded
---
K and wish that was the case for me. It‚Äôs all ended in a horrific tragedy.
---
You can see the vacuum animation without an item aswell. Its very distinctive
---
My gf sucks so she wont get that high lmao
---
Okay yea I just looked it up. Glass is Pig, Black is Mikey.

---
yes you just described what I do, and they call it camping. I get the guy unhooking they get the unhook I down someone and hook them. basically what it sounds like is unfair and only one side has rules and its the side that has less options. I doubt anyone will admit this.  I thought this was a killer game but it for sure is a survivor game. I guess that make more sense. There are 4 survivors. But from what Im seeing survive is more fun because you can do what you want with no complaints because there are 4 of you. Killer has to try to keep for people happy. Game design it seems
---
Right back at yah along with the no Winter Event!! See you all in the next Decade!
---
Oh I have Piggy already, thx
---
Ppl downvote the best advice and u people wanted quality
---
Once I prestige ill probably be freddy main, I just found out you have to play the others to get their perks
---
thx :)
---
The weak link in the chain. Does that count ?
---
If you only patrol the hook and aren't actually leaving the area to patrol gens than yes that is Proxycamping.  And again you disregarded everything I said about camping and tunneling.  That wins you games now but once you hit purple and approach red it will get you destroyed on a consistent basis.  If you're playing to deny unhooks you aren't pressuring the gens which leaves 2-3 survivors to repair at will.  
---
Winning strategy across all the ranks.  Hook them.  Forget about them immediately leave to pressure the gens and start your next chase and down.  Rinse and repeat.  Always focus on the next hook not your previous one.  The latter only beats bad groups.  The former is how you beat the good ones.
---
Aliens? Haha. No.
---
It says fun or powerful
---
Anyone else experience the tattling Nancy lately? I play killer rarely but when I do for the tome, Nancy's are always trying to rat out their fellow survivor who hopped into a locker or hid behind something
---
It is because there are way more green rarity addons/offerings than there are ultra rare ones. Especially if you have all the killers unlocked, the only ultra rares you are going to get are that killer's addons or an ebony.
---
Chad stride Michael.
---
I would love to see Sam and Dean from supernatural added as survivors. No idea what their perks would be though
---
I appreciated the reas thank you very much.
---
This is more accurate but not as spicy
---
Again... The chase clearly didn't last too long if he only has 1k points for the chase AND anything he done beforehand. That ISNT Karma.
---
I've teabagged on an attempted sprint more times than I care to admit.
---
Didn‚Äôt know they changed him but I‚Äôd prefer it the old way cause spine chill just cancels out Spooky Myers
---
lol why do you give a shit?
---
Is that...spirit Fury with no enduring?
---
I don‚Äôt understand what you are trying to prove, I was the one playing the game and he teabagged at every pallet so I got karmaü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
While that may be true for some people, I can honestly say that 90% if the games I‚Äôve had the past week the killer does not leave the hook. They have no intention if leaving the hook. Even had one player who went back and forth and then got pissed off when nobody comes to farm for him and started hitting on hook.
---
I still see high ranking survivors who have no idea they leave scratch marks and will run around a rock and hide behind it while some cute ill demidogge follows the bread crumbs to that sweet survivor croissant.
---
Some fries motherf....
---
Yeah... I don‚Äôt really have a good 4th perk on him. It literally did nothing because of how I play demo so I just used whispers instead
---
Eat your vegetables first, son!
---
There are many more occurences. Anyone with any experience with the game knows how often the game fucks up. Seems you‚Äôre the only one who doesn‚Äôt see it.
---
The videos were highlighting one of these situations. Everybody has their own they can recall though.
---
Not sure why you‚Äôre trying to downplay the buggyness of this game when everyone else knows how had it is. Nobody likes shills my dude.
---
You're not getting it.  First 3 survivors will never go for the unhook unless you're playing potatoes (which you are playing at the ranks you told us you're currently at).  Any competent survivor team will only send 1 on average for an unhook with the other 2 staying on gens.  This is why you'll get destroyed against good groups because if you proxycamp you're giving them free gens uninterupted.
---
If all the survivors go for the unhook then naturally you do too.  You go where the survivors are (This is supposed to be the gens assuming they possess a Central Nervous System) hence why I specified about good groups which are the only groups you need to gameplan to beat (bad survivors take care of themselves, you don't need to do anything special to kill them).  
---
I have applied intense gen pressure with every killer it doesn't require a Spirit or Freddy to do it.  I hook, leave pop goes the Weasel the gen of my choice and start chasing my next down.  Once you get good enough this becomes a rhythm you lock into and you'll get to the point where they can't repair gens because you got 1 hooked at least 1 possibly 2 leaving gens to go for the save and you're chasing the 4th.  You'll literally feel 100% in control of the game when this happens and unhooks against you become appealing because they aren't doing anything to take control of the game from you and it just ends up being more emblems, and bloodpoints for you as you multi hook everyone.  
---
Do what you want but again you're focusing on devising strategies for dogshit survivors that don't need to be strategized against.  At your ranks I could 4K with a Claudette.
---
Killer is too much stress for me. I do better as survivor.
---
I've played killer many times but it's unsatisfying.
---
Awesome dude
---
It depends on playstyle and all perks you choose to run. I love Blood Warden, Remember Me and Fire Up built, and usually i add NOED to this, but lately i run Rancor and have a lot of fin with this build, focused on late game.
---
I actually enjoyed these.  Tougher goals like that were fun.  Not saying you're wrong for feeling like that or flexing on you.  But I genuinely had fun and was sad when I finished them all.
---
It's basically true.
---
Dark Devotion does hide your red stain. 
---
Undetectable:
---
 Applies to a Killer's Stealth Mechanics. When a Killer is ***Undetectable***, the following effects are applied:
---
* The Killer's [Terror Radius](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Terror_Radius) is removed.
---
* The Killer's [Red Stain](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Red_Stain) is hidden.
---
* The Killer will not have their Aura revealed.
---
* The Killer does not trigger the jump-scare sound effect that plays when starting to move after standing still for a moment.
---
* The Killer sees the smoky screen visual effect, indicating stealth.
---
Recently Dark Devotion was updated to apply the Undetectable status after it activates. This means that while the Terror Radius and all its effects transfer to the Obsession, the killer is Undetectable for a max of 30 seconds. So the OP was using this to probably smack the obsession, and sneak into position at a gen acting like a fake Doctor to trick survivors, all Insidious does at that point is potentially extend the duration of the gimmick beyond the 30 seconds DD gives them.
---
Oblivious is what you were probably thinking, because all that does is keep the killers TR from affecting you. While Oblivious you no longer hear the TR, and any debuffs applied by it (Docs Static field, Coulrophobia, Unnerving Presence, etc.) are ignored, but the killer still keeps their Red Stain.
---
Generally, I get more Moris because of my TTV name, but I do also get a fair amount of people who do this, as well. It‚Äôs always nice when they killer stops by to say hi and wants to watch their last match over. Honestly, for the friends I‚Äôve made, it‚Äôs worth the extra Moris (plus ya know... content... right?)
---
You posted this under rant indicating you were mad they say GG EZ.. now. Considering the hooked persons points. You clearly hooked them and facecamped denying them their fun.. and you bringing up Karma is redundant and stupid as you are denying the survivors fun for playing the game, the teabagging was unnecessary yes but you just made it worse for everyone involved.. basically......... 
---
"An Eye for an Eye and the world goes blind."
---
Honestly, tough shit. When survivors get bugged in a wall or tree and can‚Äôt move, just gotta wait it out. Sorry
---
u also play killer?
---
once u got the 2 perspectives its gonna be easier
---
for 1 thing, you will almost never lose the killer, its about buying time, not getting away, and second, try watching some of OhTofus videos, he take fan submitted videos and critics them, i find them very helpful
---
For me I play killer when I'm by myself. If I ger any friends online I'll play swf with them. It's not that I don't like playing solo survivor but I really enjoy playing killer.
---
true, didn't think of that
---
You should try the nemesis pwyf build that tru3 did recently. Seems super strong to be able to counter the speed reduction that being in tier 1 the whole game gives you
---
I think medium vault is when your running at the window at an angle so that might be it.
---
As soon as you get in a match, go find the killer and get in a chase.  It doesnt matter if you depip every game, you'll learn, and once you can loop you'll get even higher.  I was a purple survivor, I depipped to probably 13, and now Im red ranks.  
---
  
---
Another thing that helps is playing killer/watching killer tutorials on how to run each tile set.  This will let you know what to look for, extending your loop time.  
---
Your goal isn't to escape the killer, it's to waste their time for as long as possible.  If you happen to escape, great, but it's not a priority.
---
Meanwhile in rainbow map land.
---
This guy kills
---
We're is our Event pretty good job so far!
---
Who is with the plague?
---
Also, vommy sexy mommy, tho. (Sorry for ruining the wholesome mood, but had to do it)
---
Nice art style.
---
Even bigger shame when you want to complete the "kill your obsession" challenges and don't want to spend more than 8 matches doing it. I don't have nemesis, but I have 10 ebony moris because for some damn reason the entity doesn't want to give me an ivory.
---
Pink nori should be: kill survivors after hooking them twice. Thus eliminating that its OP, but also not making it useless, (you won't have to carry them to hook).
---
You know why we call ‚Äòem the Andes?
---
Ayyy doing it right on both sides
---
What you're experiencing is probably a combination of luck, the Rift being nearly closed so folks are scrambling to finish Tome Challenges, &amp; lots of noobs just floated in from the winter sale, plus the huge influx of noobs still from the stranger things chapter - some killers will take it easy on people who are obviously new or who seem like they have no idea wtf is happening. And, of course, it's nearly xmas so maybe someone's out there trying to spread the holiday bloodpoint farming cheer haha I dunno :P
---
Haha! At the end of the day, use whatever perks you want, it's skill &amp; tactics that allows either side to win or lose.
---
I dont do this. And thats what I thought camping was also.Yet some say I am camping without doing this. Just because I go back to the spot because they are there. If they arent there I do not just sit there looking at the hooked dude/gal
---
That‚Äôs a generalization. I rarely DC, even if they game is looking bleak. Just want to play and have fun!
---
Understandable, I do play more survivor as well, and I too have made the mistake of complaining about NOED. But when I do play killer, for archives for example, I always see why NOED is a thing. Adrenaline, DS and other perks are the difference between getting a kill or not. 
---
I see your point, at the end of the day it‚Äôs up to the developers though.
---
Nice.
---
Thanks
---
And merry christmas.
---
Didn‚Äôt even notice that.  Guess people don‚Äôt like me saying ‚ÄúInteresting...‚Äù
---
It would've been for me
---
This guy gets it
---
A reminder of how ugly Kate's hair used to be...
---
Time to buy yourself some pants.
---
Shame no one can even respond to you yet you still get downvoted for speaking facts. Though I disagree with your adrenaline statement.
---
Is that old ds?
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only who noticed plagues side boob.
---
I play both, but prefer killer. It's stressful, but it feels good when you manage to outwit a team of 4.
---
Or outplay
---
Plus, hitting people with a weapon is always fun
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to live together?
---
Saaaaaaaaaaaaame, I always love seeing a streamer that's live. I enjoy watching the match from their side it's great.
---
Yeah that's the disconnect here.  My strategy is what you HAVE to do against good survivors but it also will DEMOLISH the terrible survivors you're playing now.  It literally works across all ranks the only difference is at your potato ranks you don't need a strategy period.  You could beat them with trash camps and tunnels.  But if you already use it to beat the trash players you're facing now you'll know how to execute it against the good ones you'll eventually face.  
---
You need to get better with your tracking if immersion is that much of an issue for you at the end you specified.  Consider running tracking perks to help you out.  There's also entire killers dedicated to this like Oni and Doctor.
---
It's the main focal point. Thanks for the Christmas Present, BHVR
---
Then the killer cheats on Baby Dwight with Jakecob
---
i bought the game with the intention to play killer.   
---
eventually i tried out survivor. and i got either a. face camped on the first hook  or b. my teammates wouldnt save me on the first hook.  
---
didnt touch survivor for over a year after that.  recently started playing as survivor again and it def helped me play killer better.   
---
i still prefer killer   but i'll play an occasional survivor game now.
---
Some people are emotionally invested in this game such that some actions or elements of the game create notable upset where, sensibly, there should be none. 
---
There are some perks in this game that are oft considered "toxic" or broken or whatever that people don't like playing against, and some of those folks are happy to bitch at players who use those perks. It's silly and useless, bit definitely happens! I got heaps of salt while trying to do No One Escapes The Endgame, which requires the use of NOED (a perk I neither like nor find all that useful or good), for the use of NOED. Some folks are just... grumpy.
---
Yeah ^^
---
Or maybe one hit only from fully charged hatchet and it requires more time to charge?
---
lol I am sure there are killers that do it. I am by no means defending it even though as a survivor I could care less. To me if you get tunneled or camped its your teams fault. Your team should not allow it. Think people getting mad at the wrong person. It's like getting mad at james harden for driving past the dude guarding him and not getting mad at the team that dont move over to help on D lmao
---
it's mister Santa Clown &lt;3
---
thank so so much &lt;3

oh then in that case it seems more justified
---
Definitely would be better getting hooked and stunned all days for the rest of their "life"
---
That plague side boob though
---
ahah yus ^^ she actually has it ingame aswell :)
---
I don‚Äôt really use NOED unless the perks in the web have been particularly unkind to me and I have nothing else to use.
---
I‚Äôm trying to get Ruin, so I can have a chance for the gens to get slowed down so I can actually do something. But I don‚Äôt have that yet. Therefore, I gotta prepare for gens getting done before I have the chance to do anything, and that means I have to prepare for possibly getting at least a few hooks during the endgame to make up for the gens getting done quicker.
---
Had a similar thing happen to me as Freddy, teleporting to a gen and got stuck on it. 2 survivors approached and tapped the gen so I could kick it and then be free. They assumed I wanted to farm (and which wasn‚Äôt the intention) but hey, they helped me we had a fun game and they all survived.
---
you might not realize it but you agreed with most of what I said. I said that a survivor should have the potential to win the game and save their teammates.
---
Youre contradicting yourself when you say "killers cant kill good survivors" Ruin, NOED, and other strong killer perks havent been nerfed, you somehow only list meta survivor perks that have been consistently nerfed over the last year. Good killers have never had a problem killing survivors, ur just boosted
---
Yea Otz and true arent even on the same plane. Saying true is even average is a stretch.  He hasnt changed his playstyle since day 1 and bitches about every single good part about survivor. His ridiculous cut off and saying "fook" every time something goes his way is a far cry from an average killer.
---
My point is im calling out boosted killers who play like bots, true happens to be one of them
---
It's possible you're hearing some of the ambient killer-noises? Even without Whispers, you can still hear little bits of those same Entity Whispers if you listen while playing killer. It could also be something related to your killer's sound - but less likely if this happens with every killer!
---
I'm so grateful because I got it in one game with Clown w/ T1 Iron Grip and Agitation #Blessed
---
Nice
---
I only just recently started playing as a killer.  I am rank 18 and have 4k'd every game so far (not bragging but think it's due to knowing roughly how to play survivor at this point)
---
It helps if you don't have the DLC,if Aftercare and Mad Grit shows up I don't have to buy legion/jeff lol
---
A soul for a soul.....
---
I will take a look at their channel and thank you I never thought of it as wasting time to be fair.
---
"Then the World is blind"... That single line has ruined any chance of getting any support on here, toxicity is wrong but that kind of raw hatred is not exactly the right way to go about playing a game for 'Fun' of which was your intention as you and I quote, "Wanted to have fun".
---
mainly survivor bc playing killer stresses me out, thats really my only reason. i still play killer for bp sometimes and i bought almost all of em anyway
---
My favorite build for Meyers with scratched mirror is. Bamboozle, sloppy butcher, devour hope, discordance. Or can swap discordance for bbq
---
I run specific builds that often don't have room for an extraneous perk. If I'm with a bunch of solos, causing chaos is more important than flashlight resistance.
---
Adrenaline is been used in every rank
---
Noed won't be used in high ranks
---
Maybe because one has a counter and the other hasn't and allow you to finish the last gens without bother to heal? Mmmmhhh
---
I got mine done with the help of 2 P3 Jake's and a rank 20 Jake and Kate as Trapper. I think the last two survivors saw I was doing the challenge after I killed both rank 20s in the basement and kinda gave up, which was the best moment of my night.
---
The dream world is better than sanctum of Wrath, me and my friend just didn‚Äôt wake up so we could actually see shit.
---
I'm confused, what did I just watch lol?
---
Playing against Freddy with low resolution and quality because your pc is garbage is HELL. I wish there was an option to remove the DW effects...
---
No I meant Wraiths
---
It says fun *or* powerful. Very simple. Addons that are either fun to use, or powerful. If you don't think peoples heads exploding with RBTs is you're dead inside.
---
Oh I didnt know that lol. Man I deranked like 3 levels playing all these dudes lmao
---
I swear I have like 50 toolboxes, when I try to use them all, I get like 5 more on my bloodweb &gt;:(
---
Exactly my point
---
You can bond with survivors as Ghostface.
---
lol If I use mori I get flamed also. Literally as a killer I cant do anything. Guess only way to have fun is play survivor
---
That's funny. You think Tampered Timer actually does something. If 30 seconds is enough to get a kill at any rank higher than rank 21 you are playing against the biggest potatoes in the universe and I would like to have a screenshot of them so I know who to look for when I'm making potato salad.
---
I enjoy playing both sides and personally have more fun as a killer but I play much, much more survivor (maybe 95-98% of my games) because of vision issues. It's not fun/kinda stressful knowing that a bright cosmetic survivor can literally stand right in front of me and I won't register it for a few seconds.
---
I'm still gonna mori every baby Dwight i see
---
You didn't want to give them a chance,
---
*HUH*?
---
Yeah its 50/50. It's shit for both sides without a doubt.
---
Dwight White
---
Diguise motherf....
---
Sounds good. Yeah Ill work on those things for sure. I have to find a way to do the same thing with the killers I like. Ghost,Myers,Cannibal of Course Freddy, but I only play him for pretty much a ez dub.
---
Trapper OP. Nerf confirmed.
---
I literally said ‚Äòall players‚Äô lol
---
No worries man.  I assumed that so wanted to jump in and help you out lol.  Spare yourself pain.  Play whoever you're comfortable with/enjoy playing and just spend the points into wherever you need them.
---
You obviously dont watch truetalent hes way more toxic.
---
But when you blow up as a streamer i imagine you have lots of people stream sniping trying to get in Otz's matches being toxic and trying their best as they know its on stream.
---
Plus like most gamers im sure otz is really competitive.
---
I watched one of his videos on looping, he showed how to loop Crane incorrectly to the point of where you can literally see the survivor running away from the loop, and then back to it so he can catch up.
---
Alternative is not be bad and 3-4k before they do all the gens
---
Something similar happened when I used ruin snd devour hope they spawned In an unreachable area.
---
yea no that would make them useless
---
Do you think DS needs to be fixed in the since of moris counter it heavily, or in the since of "I wanna tunnel but i cant"
---
My agitation and iron grasp will get you to the basement eventually lol. Still you'll likely DC once I reach the basement.
---
No they didn‚Äôt Jeffs dad died when he was an adult when he was taken by the entity he was returning home to sort his dads belongings
---
My 137 Iri heads are cackling
---
Yeah I guessed as much that moris would depip you since the emblem only counts hooking actions. That's still pretty funny to see though
---
oh god oh fuck

Where is stbfl? You can't truly play Demo without it.
---
I think the main reason is putting controller players against mouse/keyboard players.  That‚Äôs probably a disadvantage. I don‚Äôt think you can do mouse keyboard on Xbox dbd yet. Maybe someone will correct me on that. 
---
I know when playing Destiny 2 I can tell when someone has or is playing controller and they usually get wrecked in quick fashion.
---
Play mainly Survivor. I'm more interested in learning how to use and lightly abuse the movement system for cool tricks. I think that Killer is generally dull and boring and less than a quarter of the Killers take skill or much thought.
---
Unpopular opinion: Huntress would be way more fun if I felt like I was actually hitting hatchets instead of just managing to clip someones lag compensated hitbox.
---
I just explained why it wouldn't. You dont have to carry to the last hook
---
I'm just going to be straight up, you guys aren't really good at describing things to new players lol I don't know what endurance is
---
The best advice I can give you is to understand the different tiles:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eczds9/hey\_im\_trying\_to\_create\_little\_diagrams\_for\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eczds9/hey_im_trying_to_create_little_diagrams_for_a/) 
---
That is an above diagram that might help.
---
Then it's just a case of being in a good position. When you are on a gen have an escape route. Find a particular pallet that you could run to and then think where you can go from there.
---
What I started doing was walking around the map on the way to a gen and just looking at all the different areas and seeing where I could go from the gen. 
---
Also don't be afraid to drop the pallet early. Only be greedy if you aren't injured.
---
I would recommned watching: Tru3talent, Fungoose and Ussylis. They are all really good at looping and you can learn a lot from watching them.
---
I have started using sprint burst to give me a head start to get to the nearest loop and it helps massively.
---
Not sure if black incest is that good because anytime i go against plague my teamates like to cleanse at half sickness.
---
I like it!
---
More of it carrying survivors and the abuse of that perk is insane. It lets really bad survivors get a unfair second chance all because of a perk. I understand it being good to use against tunneling, but you have a full minute of immunity is just broken. I've gotten survivors hook and then when they get unhook i gi for other players and some how the unhook will still get down after I went down the other survivor. Heck had a game yesterday where two people were hook and because of BT and DS I had to either wait or just eat the ds. The survivor had a full minute of immunity and I couldn't do anything even though the survivor wasn't even good. Just bugs me that the perk is still broken but if I say anything I get people like you assuming I'm just tunneling. Sorry about the rant just hate bad survivors getting free out of jail cards because of a perk.
---
Looks like Ghostface is up to more than just selfies with the survivors...
---
And the Legion used to make fun of the spirit, but ever since the Oni showed up no one‚Äôs gone near her
---
Even better lol
---
ahaha yus it is ^^
---
That‚Äôs the idea.
---
On the contrary my fellow Redditor , in my country it refreshes tomorrow 1 am
---
The switch controls take a bit of getting used to, just got the game yesterday
---
Sexy Vommy Mommy
---
I'm pretty sure one of the community managers confirmed that they overdid it. They wanted to max his turn to 90 degrees instead of 180 and instead it dropped to like 20. In pretty sure they're fixing it with one of the upcoming patches.
---
"Saying true is even average is a stretch."
---
Both Tru3 and Monto have the skill of an average killer main. Rarely do I see killers as good as Otz, both in my matches and on twitch. Most killer mains can not handle the pressure in red ranks without Ruin and other gen perks (including Tru3 and Otz) because when you're chasing one person, gens can get done fast if they play correctly. You can't just switch who you're chasing either after X seconds in a chase because then you could get fucked even worse if you chase the wrong survivor.
---
Like I have said in my posts before, it is the fault of the devs for not balancing around red ranks and instead balancing around the "I play for fun" type ranks. If they balanced around red ranks, players could actually get good at the game and not have to run the same sweaty build most game. 
---
There are no strong killer perks that were nerfed this year because all the meta killer perks right now are strong. 
---
The meta killer perks in my matches and why they are used:
---
BBQ - Bloodpoints and so that when you hook someone, you can possibly start a chase almost immediately after.
---
Ruin - To slow down gen speeds. It is needed in red ranks because barely anyone (aside from Otz) can get 2 or more kills without Ruin because even with the most unsafe pallets ever, you can loop the killer all game if you're a good survivor. Some survivors will also run around all game looking for Ruin just to fap on it, which is the survivors  fault if that happens.
---
Nurse's Calling - Most survivors will heal as soon as they can if they know how to loop. You can easily go to where whoever got unhooked last and try to down either survivor if they are healing.
---
Thanatophobia - It's great to run with Nurse's Calling as survivors will think "The repair speeds are slower, we should so we get the game done faster (the mindset which makes people not want to cleanse dulls basically)" even if the repair speeds aren't that slowed down with Thana.
---
NOED - Most survivors refuse to cleanse dulls because "it just wastes time." This is a shitty mindset because it teaches survivors to just rush gens and get out. This is not how the game works and if you think this way, it's your fault if you die to noed.
---
PGTW - It's used to help keep up gen pressure, and 25% regression is a lot in this game especially if the gen was almost done.
---
Meta survivor perks in my matches and why they are used:
---
BT - A "just in case." I never see any use for it because I rarely get against campers. Hell, it's like moris and keys. There is no reason to complain about any of these. It's used so little in most matches (aside from egc if the killer is complete trash) that there's no reason to call it OP. If it was so OP, everyone would be camping.
---
DS - Also a "just in case." For this one, if it's the killer is tunneling. Rarely do I get to use this perk because I rarely get against tunnelers when it's not EGC. If they think I have DS, they just slug me anyways.
---
Lithe - It's a strong perk in chase and can help you draw on a chase longer than you could without it. It's basically a stronger version of SB.
---
Sprint burst - It's already the best if you don't include Lithe, you just can't decide when you want to sprint burst, you have to use it as soon as you start to run.
---
Adrenaline - A "just in case." For this one, it's just in case they make it to the end and need to open the gate or are in a chase with the killer and can hopefully escape because of Adrenaline. 
---
Iron Will - A "Just in case." For this one, it's just in case the killer is a Spirit or in case the killer is using headphones or other stupid reasons. Rarely do I see it used because they want to use it.
---
Most of the survivor meta perks I get against are "just in case" perks because people think that they'll need those perks even if those perks never get used because they're so afraid of getting against a camper or tunneler. It's the reason camping is good but not OP, survivors can counter by doing gens, they just refuse to because of all the just in case perks that they have. It's why camping can be such a good strategy if the survivors don't play their cards correctly.
---
Wow almost like you didnt read that at all.
---
It feels like it doesn't do anything. Because we dont get told if it works. I never said ban people who get reported because they got reported. I said tell players who reported people correctly that their report led to punishment. Again, just like League. In your reports should also hold less weight if your reports consistently dont lead to anything that's actually punishable.
---
First game of the day: I hooked everyone in the basement and they all died, except for one DC. I was about to complain in post game chat, but it gave me the completion.
---
In addition to all the great suggestions here, don't forget about the great value in simply practicing! Guides and tips are quite helpful, but those tactics must be put into action and finessed into working for YOU! So keep on playin!
---
You actually made her look pretty cute.
---
Sad? More like beautiful
---
Dang refreshes at 7 pm for me
---
A keyboard, adding text chat for any pc game is extremely easy. Whereas on console its not up to game developers as they have to use the consoles on screen keyboard, its up to PS4 or XBOX or whatever you are on.
---
Yes
---
Wait,what is a bone splinter?I have played this game for 1000 hours,have 3 killers P3d and some others sitting at various levels of prestige and I've never gotten it before?
---
Also accept the fact that sometimes you're just gonna get totally murderated no matter how skilled or confident you are and that's OK too &lt;3

---
Honestly the best add on imo. It's almost like a new killer and so intensely balanced (super strong wall hacks and super weak speed) like a giant brick on each side. It's fun as shit though.
---
In my early days I did it once and was like "this is awful!" Then my second time I was like "ohhhh, I get it and love it."
---
I'd fucking riot (by posting 2 upset comments on Reddit)

Would be nice

I'll never learn that map and I've accepted it.
---
PS5 is suppose to be doing this as well from what I‚Äôve heard.
---
Except using Adrenaline as a survivor requires you being condifent on getting 5 gens, while using NOED... well, you're confident that survivors will get 5 gens often enough that you'll get value out of it. Quite different perspectives, huh.
---
The devs have said they don't want to buff Doctor; they just want to change him. 
---
They released some subject-to-change details recently though and it seems ok.
---
It's too early for any conclusions though; we'll have to wait for the mid chapter PTB.
---
I swear if Jeff doesn‚Äôt get a Santa Claud outfit next year, I‚Äôm gonna lose it
---
He seems really upset about being puked on for someone who sucks cut off fingers
---
But we're not allowed to use noed :(
---
Agreed. They should be common, or uncommon at best. Or even make ivory moris very rare.
---
I just want her to kill me smh my head üò©
---
Not from my current usage. I still have to wait for the tendrils to let go.
---
He was hoping to keep his fingers clean of vomit. Poor guy
---
I mean I don't think that they actually called themselves the legion or wore the masks in public and I doubt Jeff ever actually saw them or if he did he probably might not remember considering it was over 20 years prior to his taking.  It's also possible that he doesn't even actually know just due to the fact that you don't really see them without their masks. 
---
 It could also be that The Killers are just too far gone to know or care.  I mean their lives are literally just all about killing now and pleasing the entity. God knows what happens if you displease it!
---
Lol yeah.
---
Hello newer survivor friend! 
---
I am also fond of quietly, sneakily doing gens. I'm no professional, but I have been playing this game since day one so here are my fav. sneaky gen-doing perks!
---
first, here's a build I put together that i have been having fun with:
---
Poised, Sprint Burst, Urban Evasion, Spine Chill
---
Poised/Sprint Burst combo is the real workhorse here, with Urban Evasion and Spine Chill coming in to support.
---
The idea is to do a gen, then used Sprint Burst/Poised to sprint to the next one as fast as possible with as few sprint marks as possible. Urban Evasion could be swapped out for many other perks, but I like it in this build to get me around quickly and sneakily, and to let me move kinda fast without running and messing with sprint burst. Plus it's great if there's a Hag around! Bonus!
---
Spine Chill is in here for the sneak factor and because it's an overall favorite - I love using the information it gives to gauge how safe I am and how long to stay on my generator. 
---
Aside from that particular build and the perks in it, I would recommend:
---
Technician - it ain't much, but a chance not to blow up the gen on a failed skill check is nice, and what I like best is the noise reduction. Again, it ain't much, but that reduction in generator repair noise can save your ass and your gen if a killer is patrolling casually/lightly and happens to leave your gen alone because they don't hear it being worked on.
---
Aura reading perks can be great for gens - Empathy, Bond, Aftercare, etc. as they can give you that extra info you really need to know whether to stay on your gen, get out of the way of the killer, go unhook someone, etc. 
---
Knowing locations of your teammates is great, but knowing the killer's location while focusing on gens is super helpful, too, so perks like Alert and Dark Sense can be neat. 
---
Hope that's helpful! Keep on practicing :)
---
I find that Nancy players always try to immerse themselves like Claudettes but it never works out because Nancy‚Äôs white sweater practically glows in the darkness of the game maps
---
The counter is to not let survivors finish all gens. Pretty simple actually.
---
oh I love Distortion! Such a fun perk
---
Won't stop till the party does stop
---
it should be one-hit after a certain distance like scott jund said. that way it rewards really good huntress players and not just people getting into m1 range to use the hatchet
---
He deserves some more love!
---
Agreed this was honestly my least favorite one, it kinda just seemed extremely rushed and no sense of script put in for the jokes like the first few.
---
Thanks and merry christmas.
---
Look at ghostface if he is stalking you, if its others he is stalking don't he'll rush you.
---
It kind of sucks they‚Äôve designed challenges that encourage players to play in a shitty way. Like you said the only realistic way to get this is either by being a scummy basement camper or by working with a survivor. There‚Äôs already enough killer main vs survivor main dislike I‚Äôm not sure why they want to foster that further.
---
did the end game timer actually end the game? had a game where it didnt, the killer had to DC
---
The  Huntress  didn't want to hit her boss aka the Entity aka the Nea.
---
Clown got laid that night. The entity allowed the legion  to catch up on the new music and billy finally got to express himself to some who can somewhat relate to him.
---
I don‚Äôt get it either. I played probably about 60-40 in favour of survivor. I‚Äôd get bored only playing one side. Would feel like I‚Äôm only using half the game.
---
Oh yeah christmas was comming too. ƒ∞ am thinking f
---
Just for the shrine of secrets
---
Not actually 4 sacrifices, but when I get a fast 2 hooks 2 downs scenario for a fast 4k there will usually be a DC or two which will lead to a de-pip.
---
No idea. Ended up DCing myself
---
So you're going to DC,right?
---
Yeah I down two survs last night and they both DC immediately within the first minute of the game. What the hell am I supposed to do?
---
All counted together I have 45 map offerings suited for Scratched Mirror Myers. (Hawkins, Lerys and Game)
---
He needs a Jesus outfit.
---
i treat it like lery's where i just pull a random route out of my ass to cut survivors off and it works
---
Why didn‚Äôt they leave? Did they not know it could be closed because I find that hard to believe
---
Shirtless and in Jesus robes.
---
Wholesome murderous teenüëå
---
I play both,but I prefer killer because I think it's more fun and also I don't get facecamped.
---
As a pig main, her charge works very well in a chase. But bc of The roar, it‚Äôs better to stand up and sometimes get a grab off a gen
---
Tatteling nancy? It has a nice ring to it like camping bubba or locker dwight.
---
Maybe the fog broke her mind and she thinks she's at home snitching on her brother mike?
---
You guys are getting frames?
---
delet this but in WAAAH
---
What am I watching?
---
that's fuckin cute
---
i dont care about the downvotes lmao
---
lol I was playing pig on haddonfield today and a survivor dc‚Äôd as soon as I started walking down the basement steps. They message me ‚Äúhaha you can‚Äôt do your challenge now‚Äù but I wasn‚Äôt even doing the challenege lmao
---
I figured, it's just that I don't think people got you were being sarcastic.
---
i think a better change would be to half the timer if someone was hooked. this would keep people who where camping with insidious bubba or somthing in check
---
&gt;Why are you booing me? I made an inaccurate observation.
---
She's using a MoCap suit
---
Yea but you would have to go through a whole animation to kill them, so the "time saved" point doesnt really make sense.
---
how much of a fucking idiot do you have to be to let this happen (not you the brainless claudettes)
---
Its ok to be wrong :)
---
Welcome to the most toxic community that Devs fuel every chance they get.
---
Just make the other ones the same except the last survivor and 1 survivor that's been hooked twice.
---
When they said "weaken freddys power" I though counter remember me using wake up

---
I just got the Switch version in a Secret Santa a few days ago. I‚Äôve been playing it usually at night when I‚Äôm in bed/lazy and don‚Äôt feel like getting out of bed.
---
Handheld Mode is pretty terrible right now. It will struggle to reach 30FPS, and stutter an uncomfortable amount when in a chase/running/searching for totems. Skillchecks in Handheld Mode seem a lot harder than normal, could be related to the performance issues though too.
---
Docked Mode isn‚Äôt too bad. It‚Äôs a lot more stable than Handheld but still looks about the same graphics-wise. 
---
Overall if you can look past the Graphical Downgrades and Laggy/Stuttering matches, it‚Äôs not too bad. It‚Äôs biggest flaw is the dinky little Switch Controllers having the **worst** joysticks in existence. Playing Killer is a chore because the slightest juke from a Survivor will let them escape, especially with how prone Controllers are to getting joystick-drift and sticking. You can pretty much only play M1 Killers unless you have a Pro-Controller.

The moment when 9,999 extra map raffle slots just isn't enough(Yes that's the modifier for green map offerings while browns are 2 and yellows are 5).

---
how DARE YOU even THINK ABOUT picking a KILLER that you ENJOY PLAYING because I don't like them, DISGUSTING killer main, uninstall
---
Screw negative karma, take your upvote.
---
Yep. Patience is also huge, because they're so used to running and kind of juking as soon as they see which way you're headed, so as soon as they break LOS with you, just stand and stalk. Wait a few seconds. If they just chill there, come from whichever way they're not looking. If they keep running, cut them off. It's just so fun when they stand there thinking they're safe and then you come around the corner they don't expect with zero terror radius, no chase music, no stain, and stab them. Fun.
---
Lol right.. because DCing on Legion and him being universally hated is something I just made up.
---
True, he does have that cool stride switch in chases. Both are chads.

---
Rank 20 is a slow and annoying climb. Once you start hitting Rank ~10 your games will likely pick up.
---
Just focus on getting points in each match so you can Pip and raise your Rank. Go for UnHooks and sacrifice yourself if need be.
---
Call me an inbred pea-brained moron, but I feel like you can successfully counter Plague both ways.  If no one cleanses then Plague is reduced to an M1 killer who is too tall to mindgame survivors, and if everyone cleanses she's just a speed limited Bubba with slightly longer reach and who can run out of chainsaw mid-chase and has to run into a corner of the map away from all the objectives to get a power again.  You only fuck over your team against plague if you're the odd one out, either everyone cleanses or no one does, anything in between is suicide.  So, if everyone is cleansing but you, in this idiot's opinion, you're the problem.  If no one is cleansing but you, you are also the problem.  Just don't be the odd-one out.
---
Jokes on you, I don't even wear pants. The only thing that is getting shit is my pro gaming chair.
---
What the fuck are you on about
---
Spinechill + Resilience will stack and speed up your Vault Speed. Not sure if this is a bug again or if it was intended this time, but it basically will raise your Vault Speed 16% if the Killer is directly looking at you.
---
yeah just outplay the INSTANT ESCAPE ez lol git gud lol
---
I'm in the same boat :/ Thinking of power levelling Nancy to get better together so more people will come to my gen instead of spreading out.

I got lucky and had a trapper doing challenges. While two of the survivors were running into bear traps, me and the other one just ran around doing all the gens together
---
You gotta run nurses on t1 myers
---
I did not know that
---
Unless it's Coldwind then..damn
---
-and then they all DC at the same time only to realize you brought a Yellow Mori
---
Is it fair game if the killer is tunneling the shit out of you?
---
so fucking what, they want to play them they're allowed to, they spent money or 9k shards they grinded out on that chapter let them use them and don't dictate other's fun you bucket of mop water
---
fair point
---
poor mikey :(
---
Don‚Äôt camp lol
---
A guy editing two separate games together and disguising it as lag.
---
Endgame - yes. Any other time, no.
---
How does Nemesis help PWYF? Sorry I'm still kind of new to the game
---
outside of a chase and not in stealth is his ultimate stride, pushing his shoulders forward n shit
---
what
---
Sounds good but if they are going to change the mori they need to change keys. Both give an unfair advantage to either side. Keys allowing free escapes and the mori allowing free sacrifices.
---
Mabey ask in the pcmasterrace subreddit
---
Camping is as much a strategy as looping and I had no other choice, They were legit waiting at the top of the basement
---
u want a tip stop listening to complaints
---
if there is literally no survivor around the ur wasting time and it is boring as fuck
---
Nemesis gives you a new obsession every time you‚Äôre stunned or blinded. So it‚Äôs a free stack of PWYF whenever you get stunned.
---
got it, just wanted to know if I was really camping or tunneling.
---
Someone translate this from 500 iq to 1 iq. Thanks.
---
when you suck the whole tiddy and it melts into your mouth, then probably melts your mouth.
---
so by genrushing did they bring only BNPs?
---
it is neither
---
They said you were good
---
Thanks.
---
I feel so bad but so good at the same time
---
No, it sounds more like they are just bad at the game.
---
No, 3 of them had tool boxs tho
---
that's just gotta feel bad, man
---
I've gotten like 4x as many tombstones as scratched mirrors, so the rarity of the mirror has to be decently high. using one just to get coldwind would suck.
---
Black splinter, glass is for pig
---
Then chase them??
---
Ruins the experience for the camper player and looping takes skill , standing next to someone does not
---
Piggy
---
Look, it shitty as fuck but I have been playing online games for 10 years. In every game there is a slice of people that are just shit human beings and you cant change them.
---
You're the exact reason why console needs dedicated servers and a time out method.
---
only time a DC is fair is if 
---
1. You need to go for something more important
---
2. You are feeling ur getting pissed off and leaving is just the only option to not get more pissed off 
---
3. u are getting bodyblocked in a corner and can't move so u have no choice to DC
---
at least that is my personal list
---
God, same.
---
Tunneling would be if you specifically went after the one that just got unhooked and that one only. You basically don‚Äôt even give them a chance to play correctly. That wasn‚Äôt tunneling though. That was just bad gameplay by the survivors
---
They called themselves the legion since he painted the huge legion mural on the wall you can see it on Ormond
---
it‚Äôs really all about luck. the first game i tried i had a dc, but got it on my second try. i know it doesn‚Äôt tackle the dc problem, but the farm map with the killer shack slap bang in the middle is GREAT for it. i hate to admit it but i got a bit campy for this challenge and wraith (or any stealth killer where you can hide a terror radius) is good for it because survivors won‚Äôt think twice about going in
---
ps4 to xbox to switch is fine but leave PC alone
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Watch streamers and guides, practice looking behind you and running and keep playing. It normal to take many hours to nail it down and know the loop spots but my biggest tip as a killer main is to not panic, look behind you and keep calm. Scared players are the most easy to loop vs as killer.
---
Camping isn‚Äôt a strategy, it‚Äôs a shitty move that ensures people can‚Äôt enjoy the game how it‚Äôs supposed to be
---
If I left it would of been a free save, And I wanted to leave but they kinda keep me in by waiting at the top of the stairs and no looping does not take skill and neither does camping
---
I never noticed. Hmm good point.  Still maybe it's just that they're so far gone and he might not exactly remember their masks.

It's Noel lyrics with words switched to be dead by daylight themed. The formatting may have been switched to be confusing. 
---
Here are the original lyrics 
---
The first Noel the angels did say
---
Was to certain poor shepards in fields as they lay:
---
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
---
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
---
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
---
Born is the King of Israel!
---
They looked up and saw a star
---
Shining in the east beyond them far
---
And to the earth it gave great light
---
And so it continued both day and night
---
And by the light of that same star
---
Three Wise men came from country far
---
To seek for a King was their intent
---
And to follow the star wherever it went
---
This star drew nigh to the northwest
---
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
---
And there it did both stop and stay
---
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay
---
Yeah I played my first match in like a week or so and I was a Rank 8 playing with rank 15-20 survivors and the killer was rank 15 themselves....felt kinda bad afterwards cause it was a no kills no blood points match for the killer.
---
hardly gen rushing when their objective is to u know DO GENS only time I consider survivors gen rush is when they all bring BNPs.
---
otherwise it is a lack of gen pressure
---
Well I wanted to enjoy the game but they genrushed me to high heaven
---
Exactly this. I cleanse if my team are cleansing, if they aren‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt.
---
I am trying it with the cannibal since it can put a lot of them into dying state at once easily, the problem is disconnectors for now, i can also let them farm and then sacrifice them all in the basement but i can‚Äôt imagine the curses i‚Äôll get because of the bad ending of a farm
---
Oh is that right?
---
I have a feeling you‚Äôre the type to lose their mind over someone pressing crouch over and over in front of you. lol. I was initially joking about legion and the hate he gets. Then you start to flip out. It‚Äôs beautiful. Thank you for the holiday cheer.
---
Then that's not genrushing
---
I realized after I made my comment that that was the cloud I've never seen him without his make up.
---
 Given his back story he probably does yes but hes probably not that ashamed of it
---
Nope they were a huntress who never threw a hatchet and only had one perk! I mean I also had a rank 20 survivor who had no perks sooo....I mean the killer was a smurf I believe merely dur to have no gamerscore (xbox player here) well either that or they were completely new.
---
Isn‚Äòt that the normal walking animation while feral frenzy? And you speed was normal too lol
---
Plague titties are something I didn‚Äôt know I needed until now üò©
---
surprisingly I got this challenge done on my 2nd try, I had a much harder time with doing the 4 gens w/ Dark Sense which took almost 20 matches because you need the perfect balance of the killer and other 3 survivors being the right amount of bad and good at the same time to have an oppurtunity to do it.
---
Or if the game breaks and you can't do anything else like the basement glitch that happened when Oni released
---
I bought the body by itself and combined it with the white mask, it works pretty well
---
Too OP pls nerf
---
If you don't see bbq auras after hook 85% they are near the hooked survivor, if they bitch over camping they could fucking do the objective
---
Which seems strange because he says that reddit is full of sheep and everyone here hates him.
---
No it doesnt your just running in circles
---
I like to counter infinites with it, but not best perk
---
I didn't took into account BBQ aura, since I only used it at the end to find the one survivor in the other corner of the map.
---
I couldnt even play because I would dying of laughter
---
Plague thiccc, too bad she‚Äôs so weak in the meta.
---
My very first game as killer I was placed with purple ranks, got promptly bullied :(
---
That‚Äôs what I was implying, read that again but with a sarcastic tone
---
If I may add:
---
4. You are bugged and you can do nothing to escape
---
5. The game was hacked and you can not physically do any actions (happened only once)
---
Yea that too
---
HEAD ON:Apply directly to the forehead
---
Survivor that isn't in a swf should have brought kindred so randos know if someone is going for the save
---
Killer if you dont see an aura with bbq explore the area if the hooked survivor gets downed again, they should blame the person doing the save for not bringing borrowed time
---
the only issue is me being new, I don't have all the characters and nor do I have chracters that I do own leveled up yet.  I will keep this noted though!
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
Ivory are the best mori‚Äôs
---
A smiling killer?
---
Yes that is, it's actually faster but it's not as noticable.
---
Literally what I said but gotta downvote i guess
---
I mean the cartoon nub head thing I'm looking at
---
Basically point is either if u cant do anything or ur gonna become a mega cunt then dc otherwise deal with it
---
Agreed
---
santa is op as fuck
---
Leslie tiller was FUCKING MURDERED!
---
They all pretty much have an add-on like these..
---
Uh oh.
---
As a survivor main, I really hope you and I don't match up. 
---
That's just savage.
---
Do you mean remember me?
---
Jay! More free bloodpoints...
---
I'd rather someone die on hook or get punished for Dcing instead of keeping toxic people around.
---
I miss Kate's old scream tbh
---
Spinechill gang where you at
---
Well you should know the perks they were using were some the best perks in the game, They had Borrowed time, DS, Sprint burst, deadhard you name it now explain to me how I counter that shit
---
Ah yes, we live in a society
---
No hes not. Dont be such a sensitive baby. Not surprised by the way you posted this lookin for reassurance of your actions. Just play the game, and camping is really stupid. Wow you killed one person congratz.
---
Oh, well too bad, I curse that image into your dreams
---
Oh shit yeah I'm dumb
---
Wish every game ended like this
---
Dunno wasn't like this before I think Tome 4 came out. I think a update or patch after that broke something.
---
Rank and location can play a factor.
---
üòÇüòÇ Don't stress too much about it, bro. Toxics gonna toxic
---
it is 4% btw
---
You mean better than
---
Ok yea I get it
---
Same
---
Give me a break, This is my first and only time camping and trust I've wanted to do it before and I didnt but this time it reached a boiling point
---
Currently rank 17, I was somewhere in the purple ranks before, but rank reset slowly put me back since I didnt play killer nearly enough to keep at that level. And now it's gotten to the point where I'm waiting 20mins just to have a 5minute game. Are you saying I'm going to have to suffer through until I get higher rank again?
---
I need BT because after I prestiged 3 characters, it won‚Äôt show up at all
---
wtf... why the downvotes.
---
Claudette x Hillbilly is now official.
---
Thank you for sharing this with us. It looks absolutely wonderful.
---
yea basically
---
You cant clicky clicky with killers
---
 Don‚Äôt worry, only 2 more weeks and you get to do it all again! /s
---
Chrisler= chrismast with Hitler
---
Honestly it‚Äôd be so nice! But that killer he was so nice man, it was so wholesome
---
Dis ^^^2
---
What rank are you? 
---
On pc killer queues can be 30min+ long in Brown ranks / during the afternoon. It's a bit better in the afternoon.
---
Green/yellow ranks can also be 10 min queues in the afternoon, but it becomes faster in the evening too.
---
All of this is because too many people are playing killer in these ranks. You will find matches faster and faster as you rank up.
---
it's scary how evil too many people are. i'm the opposite: if i know or even figure that someone is working on a challenge or trophy, i'll sacrifice myself in any way needed to help them. not to gloat, but i have 100% of trophies and challenges to date done, but many of them weren't fun, there was a lot of luck, both good and bad
---
Ghostface is the friendliest killer I‚Äôve faced overall
---
**its not November anymore**
---
An m1 killer with no map pressure can't be fixed with simple tweaks. Also, even if a skill check gave your location away and he was invisible, you could hear his lullaby and know he was coming easily. And honestly who cares about getting your location revealed if you have 7 seconds once he comes to run away and loop him, making it so other survivors just do gens on their side and if they're asleep wake up.
---
Just rework her addons tbh. Most are entirely useless and usually promote tunneling the guy with a trap on his head. As it stands, the only addons worth running on her are Combat Straps, Video Tape, Last Will, Tampered Timer, Bag of Gears and Crate of Gears. Honorary mention to Amanda's Letter, which is very good in theory, but ultimately not that good outside of very specific maps (Game, Lery's, Hawkins).
---
I got a question, can you hook them somewhere else the first and second time and then just kill them in the basement hook? Does that work?
---
gg ez
---
Add me: yxng_svxge_rip_ 
---
im rank 8 btw
---
So your at the bottom of purple rank and require teammate that focus gens or distracting killer to be at minimum your rank or higher? What makes you think people higher then your rank would want to play with you when you yourself won't play with anyone under you?
---
Welp, I dont play the game nearly enough even if I did solely Killer. Guess I'll just keep suffering, thanks for the input though.
---
I like Brown medkits and brown toolkits

FACTS
---
I was just in a game where I went afk and the survivor sent me a msg that I'm trash and I should delete the game.... looks like someone is getting coal for christmas üòû so sad
---
We didn't get it the first 1836379 times you commented it.
---
I am pretty sure they did break something, because it isn't normal for me to lose 4 pips in a row today as survivor :(
---
That explains it lol.
---
Unless the first picture was taken after the second, did someone fail a skillcheck?
---
Which means they'll never do it.
---
That literally made no senseüò≠ i dont play with people at green ranks/ grey because they typically dont know what they‚Äôre doiny. They walk around the map, sometimes do gens, go for pointless saves, and do absolutely nothing that benefits the team. Again, these are just the teammates i get. Maybe its just my luck. Higher ranks are typically more dedicated and experienced, which in return makes games much easier
---
Oof that‚Äôs trash don‚Äôt understand why some ppl get so toxic :/
---
I like how everyone in the comments is acting like he facecamped the whole game, this dude is just saying he had a bad game (which happens to EVERYONE and don't tell me you never have a game that goes by in 5 minutes) and that since the doors were already powered he camped which is something that everyone does but apparently people can't read or are so dumb that they think that securing atleast one kill since you have nothing else to do is toxic
---
The new Halloween movie basically was a retconned all movies after the first one.

"How to counter NOED: play better"

Well then you already got the experience of using it.

I am and i post like every other minute and i get no response. Thats why I turned to redditü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Lmao this sounds so much like r4r posts
---
OP went from purple to brown and now has lost the will to rank back up.
---
Oof I don‚Äôt get why some ppl are so toxic like 
---
Que??? :/
---
i think it would need to be changed so that only 3 generators get regressed and that they get an instant 8/9/10 percent regression to go along with it
---
Literally my wife. "Stop walking so fast and leaving me."
---
Like biology and anatomy are my fault that I'm over 6 foot and like to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible. Haha
---
I wonder what Doc's situation would be...
---
Also I love your art style, my boy Jeff looks so good and happy.
---
It's not our fault that their anatomy is inferior.
---
Whatever that‚Äôs supposed to mean.. anyways I‚Äôm just looking for a good team to run w. Is that rlly all that bad?
---
yes, last hook must be in the basement
---
The lone voice of sanity in this thread.
---
Thank you for clearing that up cuz I have people thinking I camped the whole game while really I only camped during the endgame and anything in the endgame is fair game
---
In theory it should. I'm positive you can do the challenge as long as all of the survivors die on the basement hooks.
---
This challenge is such bullshit... it's the only one I'm missing.
---
Lmao dumbass
---
Tbh it's not really the keys, flashlights or TTVs that would make me bring a mori. Most keys i see nowadays are actually the broken ones that people bring along to use up for their challenge anyways.
---
 It's actually the toolboxes. Any more than 2 in the lobby and i'll usually bring one. The way i see it, if the survivors want to speed up the game to that extend, then there's nothing wrong if the killer brings something to do the same on his end.
---
The article neither has sources nor states information regarding the study.
---
It's not true, don't worry. Keep walking fast with the rest of us.
---
I wasnt talking to specifically you.
---
Is this confirmed or a theory?
---
Yeah but one could argue that if someones cleansing theres no point in cleansing to get full health if shes just going to get insta down's. Not cleansing is still the better option. I cant even think of a scenario where cleansing would help you unless the killer is rank 20 and doesnt understand the power.
---
I wanna see a video that would be cool
---
NOED has more in common with Decisive Strike in my opinion. Adrenaline helps you maintain your momentum, NOED / DS are (suuposedly) meant to stop the game from being over too soon (how well they do that is up for debate).
---
You monster, lol
---
It's such a great work of art! I loved it. Great job!
---
Admittedly I could have done this a little better, I need to get better software for my drums and a setup that makes making this stuff a little easier.
---
It's funny how quickly the green mori happens to vanish so quickly.
---
Get unhooked in front of the killer when they don't have borrowed time?
---
Me toooo, man
---
When you bring a mori, you either get DCs or a shit ton of DMs about how you‚Äôre a piece of shit 90% of the time
---
Honestly it‚Äôs not even worth it. I dodge twitch streamers these days because they do tend to be assholes showing off for their stream. Not all, but a lot. Especially on Xbox. Honestly getting kind of tired of playing this game.
---
You can be healed from a downed state to an injured state.
---
the description of "can't be healed" is wrong, cuz you can be healed, just not to a healthy state (AKA can't get FULLY healed), and adrenaline heals you from a downed state to an injured one, so everything is alright
---
LOL! Gold!
---
The Pringle
---
I can somewhat agree with this. If one person cleanses, then the rest of the team might as well. If not, they are going to be injured against plague with red vomit at all times.
---
That being said, you still should probably avoid cleansing unless the situation above happens. She‚Äôs not speed limiter bubba but more like a significantly stronger Huntress when she has red vomit. She‚Äôs still 115 when she holds red vomit unlike normal vomit (was in beta, not sure if they ever changed that? Haven‚Äôt noticed if they did.) You can‚Äôt loop her and it‚Äôs really really hard to actually miss with it. If a decent plague has her power and sees you, you are probably going to go down in the next 40 seconds or so.
---
Don't really care either way. I play both sides and I choose not to camp as killer because I want BP, but i'm not going to tell someone else how they should play. If i'm a survivor yeah it sucks when it happens, but to me it's just not a big deal. I'll buy the team as much time as they can to do gens while i'm getting camped, then move onto my next match when i'm dead.
---
since when was swearing bannable in a R rated game
---
It does. It's how I did the challenge. It was far easier to do it that way than to run dedicated basement build, because survivors will just stay away from the basement if they realize you are running a basement build.
---
Normally you‚Äôd have to work to find your Obsession because without Nemesis you‚Äôd have no way to ‚Äúmake‚Äù a new one. 
---
Initiate chase, get stunned, then chase lose your chase repeat until you‚Äôve stacked PWYF to 3. Gen grabs get ridiculous with that kind of speed.
---
Have you tried slugging the survivors?
---
AKA, downing them then waiting for the timer to finish
---
I was really frightened, ok?? I was scared for Dwight!! ;-;
---
DEAR GOD HAVE MERCY ON THEIR POOR SOULS
---
Ohhh ok thanks
---
BBQ is kinda a cheap perk
---
The original still confuses me.
---
Devs always say that on stream, that's why they made the archives, because that's how the guy can probe those lost memories
---
I gave up on this one as people would keep dc'in if I took them there on the first or third hook.
---
It's always a mix with me. I either get super fun Ghostfaces or super try hard asshole ones who teabag and camp for no reason. when they're good, they're good tho
---
In the latest dev stream they confirmed the iridescent queen in the doctor rework. It functions like this:
---
After being shocked by the doctor, the survivor starts carrying a static charge. When coming in to contact or close to another survivor, the charge is transferred and they are shocked.
---
I‚Äôm not sure who is shocked and how much madness is added, but I do know that the doctor gets a notification of where the two survivors are.
---
You don't even need to play insidious bubba or basement trapper to get the challenge. Honestly those builds are just going to make it harder for you, because survivors will just avoid the basement or d/c out of spite.
---
All you really need is a map with a good center basement spawn and just throw the dead on hook survivor on the basement hook.
---
I do watch tru... but notice how this is a post talking about Otz? Tru is a whole other can of worms
---
Not trying to wait a full minute while every other survivor gens rush. Plus unbreakable will fuck you over if trying that.
---
If you are inside her terror radius when she phases, you won't hear her phasing noise when she reappears. I am not sure how this works with TR altering perks though, so I'm not sure if it's possible for her to lose her TR and still reappear silently.
---
I‚Äôm unsure whether or not your wraith add on is actually beneficial, as it sounds as if it slows down both uncloaking and cloaking speeds.
---
Leaving them there and finding a different survivor can allow for at least 3 survivors to be pressured, the downed survivor, the chased survivor and the survivor trying to pick them up
---
I'm confused.
---
Wrong place to put that bud.
---
I got dark sense done my first try.  I used the Lery offering (dark sense, open handed, bond, prove thyself) and a tool box
---
If you're worried about only rank just do gens as much as possible. Then get 2 unhooks and a couple of heals (or some combination of that) and don't suck at chase. Pipping is easy.
---
Now if you want consistently competent teammates, yeah, find a group. Lol
---
Try not to bud
---
Its just hard sometimes
---
It's funny. Ebonys are easier to find, but they are stronger and the community as a whole hates them more.
---

---
Is scratched mirror Mikey still the same movement speed as survivors?
---
I was in learys against one and one seemingly caught up to me in a straight line. I assumed it was latency or something and I was rubberbanding on his screen, but I wanted to make sure.
---
Not fair game.
---
Its supposed to speed both those up
---
It‚Äôs not BhVR banning you, those pussys don‚Äôt have the power or balls to ban people! Now PlayStation network may ban you for a week or longer depending on what you said and how many times have you been flagged for it...
---
Except Adrenaline is a good perk and NOED is a terrible perk.
---
If you have rancor you can trick the survivors into thinking you're dtf (down to farm), figure out who the obsession is , then betray them by mori'ing them at the last second. It's how I got mine.
---
True. I prefer playing survivor over killer because I often feel bad.
---
‚ÄúHave a new year‚Äù
---
I got this challenge on the first try, but only because I‚Äôm Killer rank 15 right now.
---
I don‚Äôt think rank 15 survivors even know a DC button exists.
---
dont know about the blurryness but welcome to the pc mustard rice
---
Basically this. I had a Demo the other day going for the challenge, but he literally just camped the basement and never left. I was actually planning on helping a killer get the challenge done if we happened to lose, but I‚Äôm not rewarding someone just hardcamping the basement. So I just did gens in the other side of the map.
---
Isnt that just sprint burst?
---
Yeah noed is a terrible perk, you would be a fool to use it
---
Lol yeah, I'm also used to reading it this way so I forgot the right to left thing might be a problem or be confusing. Guess I'll put reading directions somewhere next time.
---
Unless if you have blood warden but even then, it's quite bad i must agree
---
This is so cute! Happy Christmas!
---
So far yep yep
---
In my brain...
---
Yea youre right, its not that survivors want to run all of these just in case perks, but they are tired of not being able to escape the killer on their first or second chase. 
---
These perks (BT DS DH) used to punish killers who proxy camp, but almost every decent survivor perk has been relentlessly nerfed. 
---
The harder that pallats, windows, perks, items, etc are nerfed, the harder im going to abuse every chase extending mechanic I can.
---
Killers need to stop crying and git gud because only bad killer (tru3) complain about "OP survivors"
---
It was a joke dude. Every competent killer knows its bad, relax a little.
---
Oof that would be a dirty combo
---
There will probably be one Claudette and one Trapper perk, so I'm saying Agitation, Self Care, Thrilling Tremor, Deliverance
---
Ignore people like that. Everything is OP when you're bad.
---
BBQ doesn‚Äôt need a change
---
Well yeah but then again he has the weird concoctions that mess up your senses. So it's like kinda who'd win?: a dumb impressionable teenage girl armed with a knife and speed  VS  a dumb old weirdo armed with a knife and some drug bottles. 50/50 chance if you ask me, could be compared to a Disruptor class (relies mostly on speed and agility, doesn't deal much damage, all in all not very skilled at attacking) versus a Counterattacker class (relies on defense and strategy, is slow and cannot evade well) which is pretty much a 50/50 fight in all cases.
---
And fair, but I personally can't picture them actually caring about one another. They're just a group of dysfunctional kids being led around by the most capable of them, it's not founded on any real friendship or care. Reminds me more of your classic beehive structure - you have a queen who orders the others around, the queen doesn't care for any of them but she'll be damned if she doesn't use all of them, even if just for shits and giggles, because she has little to actually show. The queen is just a loser who has enough authority to manage to successfully lead around a bunch of kids, instructing them to do things, to beat up people, to vandalise properties, the queen says who stays and who's out. And the beehive is actually not thick as thieves, they only answer to the queen because ultimately that's the one who leads them, ultimately that's the one they respect or fear and that's the one they obey. And it doesn't matter how many times the beehive calls themselves a bunch of friends because in the end when an expendable one is out, they'll thrown that person into the deep. The queen doesn't care for someone expendable and the beehive really wouldn't disobey in most cases. They were like 2 cases I think and both of them featured the same 2 people so technically only 1 case of helping out an expendable.

And well that's just sad. The canon may dictate me stuff but ultimately it cannot stop me from organising a defenstration. Canon is but a duke in the 18th century France and oh boy are there many revolutions coming

It is, and it's naughtyer with save the best for last, but end game build are hard to play

Nicely done.

You‚Äôre kinda fucked in that situation

You'd have have the population die immediately on second hook

Bond to find others working on gens (don‚Äôt start ones by yourself, at least in the early game)

Prove Thyself to make sure your group finishes first, so you can run to the next one

And ofc Dark Sense

Trading card? Do you mean offering?

What are the main differences in dbd between console and pc?

You never seen a Skill Check before?
---
This was of playing rely on you hiding every time she gets her power because you can't loop her when she has her power.
---
Man this is a fantastic idea! I think about this all the time! You know what would be better than mindlessly mashing a button so you dont die? Hitting super fun and intuitive skillchecks while simultaneously mashing away! God that sounds like a blast
---
Typical.
---
No steam has trading cards for games u play that can be traded ofc
---
I don't think DBD has any trading cards
---
I had loads of fun doin this challenge tbh
---
I think he meant steam trading cards, which this game doesn't have
---
I play both... more survivor though. I find the role of Survivor alluring and generally more fun versus the stress fest of the Killer.
---
Still, frank could have just stab the janitor and thats it, but istead he forged the group by making every member stab it, and they followed him, they were 3 vs one, they could have just said hell no and leave him alone for entity's wrath, maybe istead of the legion he could be someone who could separate survivors, but instead, now we have the legion
---
I just reroll them usually. I think I've used under 20 Moris's in the year and a half I've played, mostly because when playing as a survivor I just think they're unfun poorly designed part of the game and extremely unbalanced.
---
But Adrenaline is gone after the 3 seconds of boost. NOED stays until everyone leaves or breakable the totem. But I guess you could argue that NOED won‚Äôt even happen if all totems are broken, meanwhile adrenaline has to be taken from the survivors corpse
---
Dropping the pallet like this isn‚Äòt stupid. He gets stunned, and steps in his own trap a second later. It‚Äòs great
---
It‚Äôs their one good use plus to get the full benefit you need to do 5 gens. Keys have been the same for quite some time so I‚Äôm not sure where this big hate for them came out of nowhere
---
Footage of me carrying my team

With a bit of skill because you have to down people.

I had a game with scratched mirror myers, and I played as Laurie with her perks + this is not happening. Since he was permanently tier 1, i could not see him but he could see me at the start, and I could only know here he was when the perk activated. As the game went on, all survivors died except me, so i knew when he eas trying to watch me because sole survivor prevented him from detecting my aura but i still couldn't see where he exactely was. It ended with him finding me, and I luckily found the hatch.

O Christmas Wraith, O Christmas Wraith.

They need to get approval from the copyright owners first
---
In my case you have to be lucky to have skill
---
I dont use mori's anyways, they are for noobs. Carrying to a a hook is more risk than just killing someone anyways though.
---
Great idea would give more bloodpoints then struggling, give more risk for greats and reward more skill.
---
It'll serve you best to play the killer you enjoy most - that way you're more likely to stick with it whenever things don't go your way. Each killer is unique - some you'll enjoy playing, some you probably won't. I say choose what you enjoy, at least then you get some satisfaction either way.
---
Otzdarva is a [Trapper main](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDO__Z-tZD4bfG9m4AkK_uA/search?query=Trapper), also has videos on how to kit out killers when you only have the generic perks - even has a completely perkless video, which could be useful.
---
Ardetha has an older Nurse guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfnmZvK4l88), from before she was tweaked. The general logic is unchanged though - aim to land the first Blink, don't rely on the second, and don't swing unless you're very sure you're going to hit.
---
I'll agree but I can't stop using! Send help!
---
Oof where did the bad legion touch you? Show us on the doll.
---
Why so serious
---
Yes I've been banned twice
---
What would happen if you use that? Lol
---
The Wes Craven estate got the rights back to the franchise not to long ago. Odds are bhvr is reworking out the kinks with them. I looked into it and their looking for movie/tv pitches so maybe they want bhvr to do things more representative of what ever they come up with rather than platinum‚Äôs Freddy.
---
Gen rush applies to an organized group with 4 of the best toolboxes in the game. You can't really use the expression here because then you'll get question marks everywhere from survivors and they will either troll you or tell you that they're playing the game as they should.
---
Otherwise I completely understand what you mean, if you don't play their game, survivors will insult the hell out of you. If you do play their game, you will dpip and get no bloodpoints for your time invested.
---
I'm a survivor main whose most likely transitioning to a killer main because I enjoy the gameplay more, but I can say while I'm still a survivor main that the killer gameplay aspect can be VERY frustrating, especially since most survivors are entitled and they tbag, flash spam and point you till you get fucking frustrated.
---
Gotta play this game with a cool head.
---
The state of the game is unfortunate
---
If it spooks, it hooks
---
Only works on PC. Sony/Microsoft are very hesitant to give out banning privileges to devs on console.
---
I've also been banned twice.
---
Yeah people like this suck. Stream snipers are honestly so pathetic and desperate for attention
---
The killer will normally tunnel you to oblivion this is just an extra boost
---
Added Wraith 3, Myers, Pantsless Myers, Pig 1, Pig 2, Frank, Frank Dropout, Frank Day of The Dead.
---
Waste of a pallet. He would be mid animation anyway so shy not just run?
---
Imagine being able to know who is on the opposite team before the match (name, hours, character, etc) and what items they were bringing in.
---
This comment was made by Survivor Gang.
---
And yes it is pairable with DS
---
You ok hun
---
Imagine thinking new killers are made only for the purpose of survivors having fun playing against them
---
Understandable have a nice christmas
---
/u/Getoff-my_8allz talks rubbish
---
You also need to report people in game if you want to make a report through BHVR's online support or they don't have any info logged to do anything.
---
Just play a normal game where you hook people on death hook to the basement. They won't try to sabo you this way. And it'll be a relatively normal match
---
No you just need all of them to be horrible.
---
duet with @rose._cosplays on tiktok. they make cool joey stuff, check em out!
---
This is so wholesome
---
Won't you want a killer that isn't boring or cancer to fight against tho?
---
Imagine thinking I think that.
---
Imagine also thinking that dev's wouldn't want to make killers that are cacner to play against.
---
I didn't appreciate this.
---
I can‚Äôt believe you boiled down Plague‚Äôs Corrupt Purge to a better Bubba Saw lol wtf this is like the hardest ability to miss in the game
---
look ahead in the video literally not even 2 seconds, there are two traps there. You can see the aura of both as he walks up to the gen and you can see both just before he steps in it.
---
Checkmate athiests
---
Pm me babe x
---
Yeah but I saw a trapper spending the whole game trying to catch crows with his traps. So I Just wondered if that picture came from the same trapper
---
Uh never
---
Not so horrible that they die before you can do 4 gens tho lol
---
Seems like you want a killer removed because you dont like him. Legion is one of the most fun killers to play as and I enjoy playing against them, grow up lmao
---
But not too horrible or else they'll all die or lie on the ground before you've done the gens
---
In retaliation to being insulted, 4head.
---
they were body blocking each other so none of them could leave.
---
Lol not a legion main, I play Ghostface. And I guess I'm not mentally sound because I prefer facing Legion than Spirit for example
---
I thought u knew about 90% of every killer is gonna have u heal 80% over every game but apparently not. I also thought u knew saying fuck people who main legion would be a dumb idea of a post rant or not purely to piss people off.
---
but idrc legion is easy win
---
Spirit isn't soul crushingly boring/irritating to play against.
---
I've been seeing those in my killer games. Don't worry. I murder them without fail.
---
I agree. It also removes the opportunity to get stuggle points which are a small consolation prize.
---
My meme &gt;:(
---
Imagine him being upset about needing to heal against killers
---
yes
---
Is that a good perk for him? Haven't touched him yet as im getting teachables for the killers before him and curious whats a viable build on him
---
I read it as ‚Äúhave a year‚Äù
---
Or maybe it's one big festive shrine that lasts longer
---
Lmao like a week ago I was playing as survivor on haddonfield and I didn't know about this challenge and for some reason the killer was putting everyone in the basement obviously trying to do the challenge but I didn't know that. So time goes by and I'm the last survivor and everyone has died in the basement and the killer catches me. I managed to wiggle out but he catches me again and tries to put me in the basement for the second time. I realised that this dude was just trying to put me on basement for some reason and since the hatch had been closed and the exit gates were right next to eachother there was no way for me to escape so every time he caught me I would run to a part I knew I could wiggle out of if he tries to put me in the basement so I went there and wiggled out about 5 times before he finally put me on a different hook. Now I feel like a dick
---
Nah fam, adrenaline is like a reward for playing well, since you have to do all the gens. 
---
Noed is a reward for playing bad since you have pretty much lost if all the gens are done
---
Noed allows killers to get 2 or 3ks that they do not at all deserve
---
I think that this is exactly what killers should be designed for. A game includes 5 players and should be enjoyable for all of them. I'm not saying that any killers needs removed, certainly not Legion, but I do think that a game should be designed with fun in mind. If something isn't fun for the players, it should be removed or reworked.
---
Not wanting to kill and not being powerful enough to do it are two completely different things though
---
Maybe Claudette would be making some medicine for doc‚Äôs serious dry-eye?
---
Okay Sprit.
---
Hmm I don‚Äôt like this idea a lot could be taken into account such as doctor and his skill checks so if this were to become the new struggle these skill checks must be void of all effects in game but personally I‚Äôd rather struggle just be automatic
---
Neither is Legion, he's one of the weakest killers in game right now and you find him irritating to play. It's not hard to loop an M1 killer who can't down you with an M2.
---
Lmao, but still 8 ranks ahead, that's bs
---
I don't think you can gift items to other people, can you?
---
Sleep paralysis demons
---
adrenaline requires gens, noed requires getting looped to all hell and getting double the daily dose of fiber and splinters in the face. both suck to go against, but with noed, totems/leaving/deadhard/borrwed time are great counters, with adrenaline, having noed or instant downs or things that hinder survs movement are great counters. Its a 3d kinda card game we're all playin
---
Russian words are verbal abuse even if this words not swearing, i can tell it as Russian (half joke half no)
---
Oh they deserve them. A strategy is a strategy
---
Why would you ever run Nurses on T1 myers when you already have wallhacks at a longer range?
---
Nurses is more for T2 4M terror radius builds with Rabbit+M&amp;A.
---
Incoming ‚Äúyou won because you were playing spirit‚Äù
---
You've never heard Noel?
---
I'd say Doct has more variance depending on his addons.  You can go sniper-shock, big terror radius zone denial, Stealth-doctor (Calm addons+M&amp;A), or just standard.
---
Well the Devs could just be specific and say that The Doctor only affects repairing, sabotaging, healing, and self-healing Skill Checks.
---
I‚Äôd say no to swamp, there are lots of high ground places where survivors can see almost the whole map. Wheat fields for sure though
---
I find them ok, granted they're 2D, at least it makes me look like I have friends
---
You could probably face a full red rank SWF rank and win as Spirit as long as you have Ruin and like 2 hrs played as her
---
Imagine the only one you didn't get was the rank 13
---
So I could report any Russian player who messages me and get them banned?
---
which is fair to compare them, and they were compared often until DS got it's rework. Even with said rework, DS still has a lot more in common with NOED than Adrenaline.
---
NOED never comes into play if you as a killer are outperforming the survivors and kill them fast enough.
---
Adrenaline never comes into play if you as a survivor die too soon or never even collectively complete your main objective of completing generators.
---
I love how the wraith just stay quiet while nurse is putting things on him
---
Hence why I have my settings on private I have no time to deal with salty survivors nor would I put myself at risk for a ban for cussing back at someone
---
This is the 2nd trap you saw, and its not stacked on top of the 1st, and he does not step on it.
---
https://i.imgur.com/xz3aZyg.jpg
---
The two traps you see when he looks down to free himself is the bug, there was only one trap that he did step in, but you get stuck in the animation showing a second trap that doesn't really exist while the real trap never gets reset, and you never get free from it.
---
Lol that guy on the right hiding
---
I love your art style!! Also : Thicc üëå
---
Make Your Choice Agitation Deliverance and Head On
---
Why is the bite of '87 surfacing as a meme
---
As a survivor main, if a killer was chasing me then got repeatedly stuck in a trap, I would assume they‚Äôre trying to farm, or at least be friendly. So if you were stuck, I‚Äôd definitely help
---
Hahaha, ofc "nyet"
---
Or maybe is the fault of anti-aliasing idk?
---
I think Billy and Huntress was first idk what order Nurse was after and then it was Hag and Doc and then idk
---
I agree with this rant. The problem isn't with the killer but with the people who play him and find enjoyment in soft camping the first person they hooked until they've downed everyone who tried to rescue him with their dash.
---
I really like the idea the killers and survs being friends when not in a trial
---
Thats my headcanon and nothing whill change it
---
It‚Äôs so flaccid
---
Stbfl is the best perk for him. I also recommend stocking up on rat liver add-ons. They are his best ones
---
The plus signs alone would be just fine.
---
i managed to kobe off the hook and escape last night with a huntress doing that challenge... i got hella salt after that match for it... but it also felt amazing to yeet myself off and out lol
---
Pretty sure I was the Myers there ...   
---
what was your level and do you remeber Myers's name ?
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm upset about, you are very very intelligent. 
---
I‚Äôm upset because I have to heal, when did you graduate from Harvard btw?
---
And you had NoEd.
---
Legion is literally on one of the lowest tiers. Are you rank 20 or something?
---
I do think too! Now I will go at it and keep count. Who knows maybe just 1 left. I will tell u how many were left when done to encourage youüòú
---
Just a couple. Long wait times. Always at least 2 disconnects a game.
---
&gt;Not enough people make this joke
---
Too many people make this joke, actually
---
dude, i loved the Jeff and legion pic awesome job!!
---
I was under the impression that the shrine is mostly automated. And even then since the changeover is concurrent with dailies they could no doubt set the next one in advance with the chosen perks
---
The leaks suggest that there will be another in January, but we've received no official details about it yet from BHVR.
---
Ah I didn't even think about that, I guess the only way is to both enter a game and let the other person escape with it.
---
I'm guessing it's gonna be the same until the new year but I wish it would be changed the survivor perks are so bad.
---
Vommy mommy looking fine as usual
---
Repeat it with me now: "Play stupid games..."
---
Yes it does
---
Yeah they have to be able to set it in advance seeing as when it does change it's done on the new [ingame] day
---
Does Wraith count?
---
I figured his simple Nope wasn't the entire answer but it comes close enough, small update btw since i've made this post I have been full on called the N word twice without context because people just aren't afraid of the system noticing it I guess.
---
You cleanse noed within 2 minutes of the game starting? Share your pro strats please
---
I know right?! Was looking for this comment
---
Stake out or spine chill
---
When I was doing the two endgame sacrifices with NOED challenge there was a Nea (P3 wearing Neon clothes, obviously) who pointed at me and clicked her flashlight while I stood by the person I had hooked. When I went after her and downed her she DCed, and in post game chat she said I didn't "deserve" my Rift.
---
I mean I'm not the moron who goes half a mile away from the exit gates to poke the proverbial sleeping bear. Like she wasn't trying for a rescue either she just wanted to point at me and teabag me.
---
Nea mains is as Nea mains do.

Had an Insidious Camping Trapper place all his traps around the basement and then camp. My Rank 15 teammates (actual Rank 15s in a Rank 8 match; thanks matchmaking!) all fed him and gave him 3 sacrifices.
---
When he closed the hatch I just DCed. Not going to give you that shit if you go AFK all match and my dumb-fuck teammates can't do gens through Ruin. Either derank to Rank 15 or play the fucking game thanks.
---
My last guy DCed when I was carrying him
---
Luckily when you're rank 16 and put traps all over the killer shack it doesn't take to long
---
https://youtu.be/IOxpBwyhz-w
---
I really enjoy this series, "Entity Education". As a killer he gives a good idea of the killer and your gameplan when playing as them. As a survivor you can still watch these and learn what each killer can do and wants to do in regards to their power and their gameplan.
---
Yes, but they might have deleted the tape as well and made the count transfer. I‚Äôd love that

---
You have to submit a ticket
---
I consider myself Killer leaning and I think NOED is a far bigger problem than Adrenaline for many of the reasons Survivor mains bring up (notably that the perk rewards you for doing poorly while Adrenaline forces you to survive with 3 perk slots.) But with that being said both NOED and Adrenaline haven't been changed in about 2 years and it's absolutely ridiculous that the devs haven't looked at the perks that are meta at literally all ranks.
---
He‚Äôs more of a damned soul imo
---
Totally agree, also want killers to take it easy on survivors who bring flashlights. Like most of us arent toxic, we just wanna get out challenges
---

are you saying you play inverted? I can never wrap my head around people who do, like I know for a lot of people it was because older games a lot of the time were inverted with no way to change it, but still it just boggles my mind. 
---
I actually know a South Paw freak, I stare at him holding his controller claw style and scream violently.
---
I did that but personally my fingers are faster than my thumbs and it would be a nice option to switch to if you wanted to
---
Everytime I play against Michael I lag like this it's so annoying
---
Don't worry. I've been preparing my whole life for this.
---
That still doesn't explain why Nurse has to be future.
---
Going from memory. Go to steam/steamapps/common/deadbydaylight and I don‚Äôt recall fully so just do your best to find the Content/UI/Icons folder

You should find one called I think ‚ÄúCharPortraits‚Äù or something like that. Paste them there

Sorry for a non-definitive answer. My PC is off now

My girlfriend encountered someone who was streaming as facecamping insidious Leatherface. Fortunately she had Kindred so everyone else stayed alive, but he even said in post-game that he does it all the time because chasing survivors is ‚Äútoo much work,‚Äù like ?????? I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôd be very fun to watch. He was a dick to her too. I love a lot of streamers, but best of luck to him growing by doing that lol.
---
Deeeefinitely, thankfully, bugged.
---
Thank you for this. I can't tell you how many games the killer just camped the basement and tunneled any attempts at rescue. I know it's not the Killer's fault, but this challenge honestly ruins the game for everyone involved.
---
Thanks. The problem is I don't even know the name of the pack. Going to have to do some digging around.
---
For me the most hard challenge so far is to hook 2 people in the endgame collapse.
---
Yep! It'd be tougher to complete the Rift without the Tome challenges, but someone could do it if they wanted to.
---
This was probably the hardest challenge for me. Not because of the general skill it might take but because whenever a survivor would see I'm heading towards the basement they would DC. I got it done as Michael but an Ace almost ruined it by wiggling out and balance landing away. I had closed hatch since I didn't want to run the risk of him breaking out and going to it. I did it though and got a very rude message for it.
---
I remember seeing it on r/perkbydaylight
---
No, you just respond to valid counterpoints with the same sentence you've said this whole time. When can come up with a more fleshed out reason than "BBQ doesn't need a change" I'll be sure to think about maybe answering you're dumb ass.

I had a friend who used 38 flashlights to get the ‚Äúblind the killer 4 times‚Äù one. Didn‚Äôt it get changed to 2 blinds later? I have a really faulty memory
---
The game is just more fun when you don't camp. I think it's definitely possible for both the survivors and killer to have fun in a match if you're not doing some kind of camping shenanigans.
---
Finished awhile ago. Lot less grindy with the archives
---
short answer console runs at 30fps PC runs at 60+
---
Not all hatches lead to escape...
---
because you cant stalk all the time. E.g. when youre in a chase and they are healing nearby, you can easily go away from the chase and hit the healing guys. 
---
Three perks for t1 myers makes it the easiest you can do (even on pretty hard maps):
---
Ruin (for slowdown that you need early), Sloppy butcher (Longer heals, means you can do hit and runs), Nurses (as describe above), 4th perk is whatever. Thana, BBQ, Corrupt, Bamboozle, dont matter.
---
I don't think so. I recently finished this challenge &amp; it was 4. I think originally it was a higher number. Not sure.
---
Indeed
---
Yesterday I played a friendly game with a Killer, I was Claudette. I was walking around Yamaoka and saw out of the corner of my eye a survivor in a red shirt following me? Turned to look and it was Pig, but she was just walked with me a bit. She was lonely and we just looked in each other blood splattered faces, before she let me leave unchased. Thru empathy I did see Pig bond with others, by downing them, then doing helicopter spins until they threw up (escaped). Friendliest killer I've met.

I enjoy the battle pass. It's a good deal for the amount of stuff you get and even if you don't buy it, you get free cosmetics just by playing the game. Seems like a win-win to me.
---
Alright. In that case, I would like the Tome, but not the rift, because the Tome gives me lore and stuff, and like I said, instead of blue energy things for the rift, give me Auric Cells or Bloodshards.
---
I asked a killer this once and he said it was so he didn‚Äôt have to stalk, he could just walk up normally and stab a bitch
---
It kinda makes sense, but I wouldn‚Äôt do it personally
---
I don‚Äôt need to write 4 paragraphs explaining why I disagree. Especially after your outburst belittling me simply because I disagree. Grow up
---
How come I'm a rank 10 killer only getting matched with rank 3's
---
Here‚Äôs the thing is the prerequisite is to unhook someone. Might as well bring kindred for the extra info. That‚Äôs the thing about aura perks. Why bring empathy when there‚Äôs bond ect.
---
Sorry, my version is on the Microsoft Pc store
---
Tier 56 right now, and all my challenges are done. I've got some grinding to do if I'm gonna make tier 70. I hope for the next rift they start giving rift fragments for daily rituals as well.
---
That's fair. I've just never been a fan, but that's mostly bias cause I'm poor and I'm salty I can't get all cool paid for stuff
---
&gt; and then hide when the killer shows up.
---
no wonder you find it boring, survivor experience is enjoyable when you actually run killers
---
I did the same thing man, we learn from our mistakes, that‚Äôs the important part :)))
---
I cleanse because the vomiting is d i s c o s t a n
---
Why
---
this could be a good idea but i‚Äôve tried something similar through binding keys and my fingers hurt even after 5 seconds of doing it :(

Paired  with decisive unbreakable is really strong because it‚Äôs a guaranteed get up either way.
---
Wat?
---
Maybe he was having a stroke there
---
Ok
---
I‚Äôll give it a go
---
That's not too hard. Just run [Power Glove Freddy](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eaucpi/when_youre_chasing_the_obsession_and_the_last/?st=k4kh3ovn&amp;sh=e3b2dbee). Any killer will work, just combo NOED with other endgame perks like Blood Warden, Remember Me, Bitter Murmur, etc.

---
This was not my game. My friend was playing and streaming it to me via discord and this happened.
---
I would love to see stake out OoO MYC and Nurses
---
That's mostly why: 1. I was feeling guilty and 2. Thought their teammates were a little dumb.
---
Survivor: We're Gonna Make It. I love being able to unhook someone and have them healed up super quick even if the killer decides to make a beeline back to the hook. I don't know if the numbers add up or how much of a benefit it is but it feels good to be able to superfast heal. 
---
Killer: Surveillance. It's a crutch, and I don't think many killers use it. For me, it's an information perk that has a very quick ramp and absolutely ruins any survivor that can't hide convincingly and/or loop me for a long time. It's not very helpful against cheeky survivors who will go back to a generator as soon as you're 10 yards away, but I still love it.
---
I'm at level 59 of 70. On track to make it, I think!
---
mate are you thinking of ruin?
---
I just think that if you're someone who can't afford it, you're getting free stuff that wouldn't exist if there wasn't a battle pass. So yeah, you don't get some paid stuff, but you wouldn't get it anyways because it wouldn't be a thing without a battle pass.
---
Thanks, mate!
---
I think it just depends on your perk build and map rng whether or not you should cleanse and when you should.
---
DCing because your mad isn't justifiable. It would not be considered justifiable in any other game that losing one player ruins the whole thing.
---
Games can't be all that long, just stick it out and quit playing after that game ends.
---
no they have to be in the effing studio but for the daily ritual now that's automated also you dip*** don't downvote because it shows you're a coward
---
Roadmap shows another tome coming out with the mid chapter patch
---
I was the person playing and may I just say that this guy was zooming even before he was injured which makes his excuse completely not valid and he was running dead hard so he didn't have sprint burst or bl or something like that. Although it wouldn't make sense for him to hack on a profile that's 4 years old it still happens it may be a bug but either way, it needs to get fixed.
---
That happened to me a few days where I was able to speed
---
I wish more people had your attitude haha, what you call extra effort others call tunneling.
---
I have it on switch, queue times for survivors is within 30 sec, within a few min for killer. Performance is comparable to other consoles.
---
At least he got what he deserved.
---
I wouldn't call it impressive if you had to ask everyone to let you get it.
---
Dead before sunRISE MOTHERF...
---
You can preserve stacks of STBFL on Demo by using Shred on the obsession instead of basic attacking, since the stacks + cooldown reduction only work on basic attacks. It‚Äôs pretty damn good on him for that. Other killers with alternate attack methods can also do this, but demo gets a lot of good use from it.
---
i'm literally crying this is **too funny**
---
I run small game. After using it for a while u began to learn the distances between totems and the general area they are,  if not exact location on maps. With that i also run quick and quiet. To help me travel sneakily and fast when i need too. I visualize the entire map from birds eye view from the first totem i find then mark off so many square feet in my head to find the next 4. Then next 3 and so on. Only 5 totems spawn. If more generators are being done vs hooks , say for instance- 3 gens and 2 hooks (the same person) i try to go on ahead and get the rest do to no ed. That's just me 
---
Edit: im hated here because i dont run the right perks acording to this sub.. but im rank 4 so.. no items since 2018
---
Windows of Opportunity for sure
---
I make an effort to obviously ignore people with the streaming names. I'm not sure what the point is in putting your twitch name in your gaming username. If you pay too much attention then they might use the stream to preach toxicity.
---
that's rad!
---
??? Wtf dude? 
---
I didn't downvote anything of yours btw
---
Sorry friend,i has spine chill üòâ
---
yeah i get you now, it just confused me at first because that's the exact comment people make about ruin too
---
unless that was the point üëÄ
---
Sorry that this entire sub is basically toxic survivor mains, you camped basement in the end to confirm a kill against gen rushers, (which is smart) because you confirm atleast 1 kill or more if they go for the save instead of them all escaping. This sub hears ‚Äúcamp‚Äù and they lose their mind. Good luck in the future üòΩ
---
I love Distortion and Franklin's! I usually use them too :)
---
Well they apparently think it‚Äôs an issue since it was in a survey question not long ago about cross platform. One of the answers was control differences. 
---
I know for survivor it‚Äôs not a big of a deal but certain killers are way easier to control and get hits with keyboard/mouse than with controller.  Let change of getting juked out of your shoes lol.
---
What does that translate to in your picture? Also great work!
---
as a Kate main, #JusticeForThePonytail please bhvr.
---
You can get a heal to activate it or have someone heal or unhook you. So in theory, you never have to be hooked and can get info mapwide.
---
The Legion were taken in the 90s; Frank‚Äôs varsity jacket has 1993, and one of Susie‚Äôs has like 1996 on one of her hoodies
---
28 STAB WOUNDS
---
Nice tha much appreciated for this info
---
do keep in mind, that nobody should be obligated to give you the challenge as well.
---
Basement builds are already some of the more unfun builds to go against, so I can understand these challenges attracting as much salt as they are. But a survivor running to the opposite end of the map isn't doing anything wrong either and I've seen plenty of killers salty about it because the survivor dared to wiggle out of their arms trying to carry  across the entire length of the Temple of Purgation or something.
---
I got it from playing those Fighting Jet games on the PS2 when I was a kid and it was the only games I had at the time.
---
if I am pissed off to the point I am going to be toxic about it I am gonna DC to not ruin someone's day
---
Huh. Never thought about it like that.
---
I like it but honestly I think it is a nice thing but not needed
---
I feel like Leader's numbers are pretty impressive for how much it effects. It's hard to justify in a build but since it works with people unhooking you, it will always see a lot of use.
---
Next underrated perk is Botany Knowledge simply because how many people run Self-Care. At least run it to help yourself faster.

Just came here to say 4%
---
Iron Maiden is definitely worth the spot, but also if you have it, I would replace monitor with nurse‚Äôs so that you can capitalize on the sloppy
---
OP didn't call it impressive either
---
I do so love some of the artwork that BHVR gets for this game, and your piece is no different.
---
In the spirit of the season, I went around as Santa Clown today using up BPS, but purposefully not killing folks. Hooking, yes, but letting them escape.
---
I always do 40 push-ups before a game anyways and I‚Äôm usually burnt out after 10 games or so
---
Not having any luck. People purposely dc than shit talk you in endgame chat just so you can‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs fkn bs.
---
Altruism is one of the four points of the game, objective is only one (I can also agree that survival links with objective). The point I'm trying to make is, telling survivors to just abandon a teammate isn't in-line with how the devs want the game to be played. If they only cared about doing generators and surviving, that's all you would need to do to rank up.
---
i did it first try against a freaking baby Nurse
---
now the pallet stun challenge is a real pain in the ass, i was so close one game but killers starts to always respect pallets EVERY TIME ;-;
---
Be glad freddy isnt on switch yet... trust me.
---
Bitching bubonic babe
---
How is this sad? Looks like fun
---
You have empathy. Props to you for considering the other guy.

RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD REGAN RONALD the first thing we have ever heard of is that you have no inter check FUUUUUUUUU I'M you want me to grab your coffee and drink your coffee and drink coffee ‚òï your time off and then relax your hand and then put your hair down on the hook and then walk away from the sun and look for a while üò° if you want to meet up some day a week before the weekend off the weekend m8 if you want to a few minutes then just let me know so I will post it to you tomorrow night if you want to a video or something like that as well as I have a big dick
---
Yeah, well risks can be good when I hit then during a pallet stun, but it gets annoying to get pallet stunned three times in a row
---
Stake out, if you‚Äôre not good a skill checks but you can sneak well, it‚Äôs a nice way to get some extra speed on generators
---
Yes but if u respect those pallets then they might‚Äôve not even come down. Aggressive over defensive.
---
Thanks, I guess.
---
That's big if. If a person cleansed only once and in a far corner of the map. It's sadly not always the case.
---
i don't even understand why people dc against it, every time you do that's at least one killer who's gonna have to still spend ages doing this challenge and you may end up playing against them again anyway
---
plus it's just a dick move. i'm not saying anyone has to let the killer get their 4 basement kills, but there's a difference between playing against them and fucking everybody over because you don't want to lose.
---
"nerfed". Yeah, no son. Take a trip down to any good killer that streams and ask what they think of DS. If anything many big names, including Otz think it's better than ever and i agree.
---
Gimmie my 1k boldness
---
Match making us so shit , earlier I found a baby sweet who got beamed down by a p3 huntress and killed himself , he was rank 20 and feels bad man
---
Monitor and abuse is useless on huntress
---
But that makes sense tho, imagine every spot on your bloodweb being a preset colour. and for example for billy, the only pink you can find is a ebony mori. while you can find alot of different yellow addons.
---
New kindred is probably better than bond or empathy.
---
It's like people forget good and competent killers can run this to screw you over even harder and punish you for playing well. It's not a case of playing bad, abyone can use it, they choose not to.
---
Reparar
---
Maybe change your display resolution to 1080 or 1440

4k involves 12 hooks. It takes 80 seconds to do one of five gens (let‚Äôs imagine no ruin/pop because crutch perks are boring). Seeing you can only effectively chase 1 survivor, an optimal survivor group could complete the gens in around two minutes. But let‚Äôs say four minutes considering other factors. So a killer with no ruin/pop must get 12 hooks in 240 secs (4min). On average, each hook must take 20 seconds. That is, Chase begin &gt; First Hit &gt; Second Hit &gt; Hook &gt; Second chase begins. All of that cannot exceed 20 seconds if survivors play relatively optimally. So you‚Äôre saying if this cannot be accomplished, the killer is objectively bad?
---
Glad to see I'm not alone using those perk pictures.
---
I have a hard time not DC-ing (the urge is real) since the puking sounds make me physically ill. It's not even a horrifying killer. Just a disgusting one that makes me queasy.
---
*mouth clicking noises intensify*
---
Fun fact the score event when you hit someone post phase as Spirit is called "Grudge"
---
This is canon now, and nobody can convince me otherwise.
---
If you read the paragraph when you first enter it, it says that the Bloodweb is a place in your mind connected with the Entity. So, yes, to an extent. Not in the way that we see it, but yes. Think of the one we see as a way for our mortal minds to comprehend what Survivors (and Killers) see when traversing the Bloodweb.
---
I don't like using either one personally. I like more consistent perks where I can use them in every game I'm in even those that I die within 5 minutes xD
---
I mean, that perk can be taken away from you even if you play well and fair, Adrenaline cannot, what is the comparison here even?
---
"Especially after your outburst belittling me"
---
Dude, there is no after. Every argument you've had has literally been "nah it dont need to be changed so why change it, not op not shit why change".
---
If you had had even one valid counter-argument you'd have footing to stand on, but even when I was being perfectly polite and asking your opinion you didn't give one; at least, you didn't give any reasoning for one. There's another guy in the thread who pointed out that it's an incentive to leave the hook. That's a counter point. You've said literally nothing and you deserve nothing. If you don't understand why you need to back up your statements then I really just don't value your input at all. I hope you don't live in denial like that in the rest of your life.
---
They be like that!
---
Sometimes the killer puts too much pressure that you cant' do bones
---
I've just been in this place before
---
So the perks are not canon
---
I would say WGLF is, since you get the blood points that barbecue would for killer.
---
What is up with those perks though lol that build.
---
Once we got the Demogoblin, everything feels like a viable option!
---
Inbred pea-brained moron
---
Yeahh I‚Äôm still doing the heals challenge üò¨üò¨
---
I really love using autodidact but most of the time you can‚Äôt even get enough tokens to make it worth while. It‚Äôs so satisfying getting 5 tokens and being able to pretty much insta-heal your team mates.
---
That‚Äôs the only reason baby mega exist dear Redditor , to drop pallets when the killer hits them 13 meters away
---
The last survivor in actual lobbies is floating too.  You can tell by opening your bloodweb in the lobby.
---
Well, I just got pallet stun twelve times, so...
---
I didn't think that could be thought of as a brag sorry, I ment just try to ask people to help in the lobby and they likely will. No need to suffer through it alone.
---
Hitting through pallets is a real thing, not a bug. A trophy/achievement for doing the action a bunch was added in shattered bloodline
---
Twelve less pallets for endgame
---
Not to mention her licking her lips
---
There's no way to be sure unless it's confirmed. I'd imagine that they are the Entity's way of toying with the Survivors, giving them false hope and the Killers a better chance of sacrificing them.
---
&lt;3
---
bruh
