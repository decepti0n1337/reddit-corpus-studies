If your noed kicks in it means you have failed at the game.
---

---
If adrenaline kicks in it means you are doing good.
---
That's the main difference.
---
---
---
I almost missed the Claudette, just like the real thing!
---
Sorry, I forgot how many Wraiths there are at rank 1...
---
Try running around the map to the other gate. Touching the escape zone from the other side on the other gate might work
---
I would recommend getting him since it is fun to play him and it is easy to learn how to use him properly. I main Michael and I use BBQ &amp; Chili, Nurses Calling, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Bitter murmur(can swap for any other perk you find useful).
---
And plus Scratched Mirror on Lery's absolutely fun
---
Only once have I had this happen to me at a pallet. I'll never forget it because that Spirit was so incredibly patient. At red ranks too, so I hated myself for letting it happen. Lol.
---
&gt;Why is it a thing again? Just got out a game where my team worked their butt off to make sure we get all the generators and the killer was trash but lucky for him he had no one escapes death
---
Because it adds something else for survivors to do other than generators. You can still focus on your primary objective and neglect totems but thats on you. 
---
If the killer really was that bad, you probably had more than enough time to cleanse totems before popping the last gen or at the very least, memorize their locations to check if they light up.
---
Everything you say is based around the meta and I can see that nothing I say is going to get my point through your skull lmao, we're done here.
---
I was on your side until you came at her with all the crap about not being capable of a debafe
---
I love the meg being lifted by freddy
---
The server for each game is hosted by the killer. This will be true until the dedicated servers come out in a few months.
---
Yeah as a survivor main it feels like such a cheap and trashy perk that ruins games.
---
However trying (really really hard) to see it from the Killer's POV (as I do play a bit of killer and sometimes use it), it doesn't always feel that OP. Especially when I don't have ruin, the game goes by so quick and then the doors are often far apart so if I haven't killed 2 by then, there's a low chance of getting many more.
---
However I agree, I'd rather it just wasn't in the game. It's not even fun for the killer like a lot of other high level perks. It doesn't require any coordinating with abilities (like BBQ and Billy etc.) it's just there and feels like shit to play against.
---
I don’t know if you know, but balanced landing is a teachable perk, maybe that’s why you can’t find it yet.... I’m pretty sure
---
what does EGC stand for?
---
yesterday i played huntress for the first time, and didn’t kill any of them. after the match they all took the time to send me messages of how bad i was. really turns me away from learning new killers.
---
Sounds really creative! Phenomenal idea!
---
I thought so. There were some good spooks and they weren't afraid to get gory sometimes. I'll admit there are cringey moments but I went in expecting at least some of that since it's a show where high schoolers are the main characters. All in all, it's not a bad show but there is some cheese. I also like the fact they created their own "Randy" character without making a clone of him from the original movies.
---
I love how the meta rn is to run adrenaline and stay on gens the entire match (ignore healing and even in some instances a hook rescue) yet, killers aren’t supposed to run NOED/Ruin. What a joke lmao
---
The fuck?
---
You your paid attention to how Ruin is working I'm telling you, It's actually just considering it a failed Skill Check. You know how it sparks and you don't get any points? That's because it's just acting like It was failed. If it worked like in the perk description, It would just go back 5% and then let you immediately continue.
---
I don’t really understand why the Legacy part is relevant for them lol. You played back before the changes rolled in, woopdee doo.
---
It's pretty much an automatic upvote for me
---
Not gonna prestige? Tbh I don’t see the point of prestiging either
---
And then the Doctor's using the add-ons that prolong the Doctor's clones' aura time, so Calm Spirit really doesn't matter to him.
---
If you literally don't hit the Skill Check at all, it would go down 7% or whatever.
---
If you hit a good it goes down 5% at max.
---
Myers still freaks me out. Im doing a gen, look aroubd and there he is... just staring at me... creepy as biz.
---
Yes
---
Survivor: YOU'RE TRASH!
---
Me: Oh yeah then how'd I kill you?
---
S: HOOK CAMPER
---
Me: Ok kid
---
Hag has a tiny ass TR, as can Doc with a stealth build. Spine Chill also increases vault speed. Spine Chill is a very good perk, honestly one of the best in the game. 
---
Also, for Spirit, it's not her phasing, it's meant to tell if she is phasing around the pallet or not, which you won't always hear if she's quick or using prayer beads. 
---
I don't know how much you play this game but if your offered replacement to Spine Chill is just "Use ur eyes lmao xd" then you're in for a bad time.
---
Yeah, better leave those scratches so I can follow you.
---
Shit still works in red ranks, for a good reason I might add.
---
It’s the huntress actually!
---
That's how it is you can keep working when you do the good check with ruin with a failed one it blows up and you are forced off of it before being able to start again
---
I keep finding people who are killer mains but they'd rather take turns in Kill Your Friends than go "blah blah dumb perks blah blah buff [character]"
---
I also had an intense moment.
---
So I was at the exit gate at my teammate got downed. I led the killer away from my teammate until they got up. The killer kept chasing me till the EGC bar was around a quarter to a half of the way gone. The killer stopped chasing me and went to the gate (keep in mind I was injured during this.) I ran to the gate and the killer was in there, I ran right by her and she missed her swing. I barely got in at the same time as in their video.
---
wait legion got metal?!*grabs credit card*
---
3-5 minutes for me, and I'm currently rank 3 as killer.
---
ooohh, i see it now, I missed that
---
Anyone what the reward was for particpating in the PTB this past Friday?  They said it would be given out in June but I haven't heard anything about it.
---
It honestly depends if I have toolbox with me or not because when I use toolboxes I don't really get as much skill checks so I just work through it even I cant really hit great skill checks but if I don't have a toolbox I'll usually look for it for awhile then get back on the gen cause my teammates probably already found it or something
---
I'd just like to congratulate you on creating potentially the worst post I've ever seen on this sub in the middle of all the posts talking about how we should probably stop shitting on players for choosing certain perks right now
---
Cleanse totems.
---
Did you save a clip of it? I love intense moments like that.
---
Had this last night! Killer was a champ though! I came back through and he downed me and carried me to the trap door! I was able to m2 out!
---
Right, because literally every single perk needs to be compared to how it is used solely and exclusively at rank 1. Fucking delete Wraith, Pig, Freddy, Leatherface, fuck it, delete them all except Nurse Billy and Huntress, delete all perks except the meta. No reason in using them, amiright?
---
you dum
---
If you are good with her blinks, shes hard to outplay. Sucks playing at rank one as a survivor as you only seem to get nurse and billy mains. Occasionally a spirit will show up but any other killer is a miracle to see in the red ranks.
---
Endgame Collapse. That’s when the floor starts crumbling and you’re on a timer.
---
The Entity promised me lasagna, Jon
---
I don't know how much **you** play this game but you literally can't hear the Spirit phase when you're in a chase and the Hag doesn't have a "tiny ass TR". She has an appropriately scaled TR to match her movement speed, thus making no difference to you being aware of when she is coming.
---
Fair enough, I figured some wouldn't enjoy the lore like I do, hence why I also included design.
---
At least they are not Claudettes?
---
Do you care more about the perks you get or the new killer and survivor you get because that will narrow done your choices
---
I read unzip instead of zip and the sentence changed completely.
---
Experienced killer tip: read your post game stats and move on. Don't bother reading or commenting.
---
No after getting a Good Skill Check with Ruin, the generators progression pauses for two seconds. You know why? Because when you fail a Skill Check, it pauses the generators progression for two seconds. And if the generator explodes, you aren't forced off the generator, if you still hold the repair button, you can immediately continue repairing.
---
Oh god
---
Thanks man
---
Survivors dont work their butts off for anything. Noed is trash.
---
Endgame Collapse.
---
under one of the picnic tables in between Myers house and one of the others is a Golden toolbox, there is also a Golden envelope on the ground near it.
---
We did cleanse totems but they weren't top priority. We trying to escape no one was really thinking about that stupid thing until it finally happened
---
I mean I’d like a little bit of both but I also have no clue what perks are good and what to do when going about trying to get perks I don’t have
---
For example I don’t know if I should get any perks from shrine of secrets
---
I have a sick sense of humor I thought it was hilarious
---
Unfortunately, I don't record my games.
---
Then its your fault.
---
Play on console if you want no chat or just leave quick
---
You might be talking about the theme I came in with. The winter/Christmas theme. So many damn memories, very nostalgic theme. It would be so great to be able to choose your menu music
---
As a killer main I really don’t get why people camp. It’s really not that fun. I just played a match as a survivor and I got hooked and the guy went around a little wall in front of the hook and stayed  there the entire time. Guy got called out by another survivor and said “I wasn’t camping I was on the other side of the map” I could SEE his head and hear him swinging his weapon at shit, the Claudette trying to save me saw him and try to lure him off but nope, 2 gens popped while he was camping me too, but he just stayed there, waiting for me to get sacrificed??? I understand people being salty(not toxic but salty) when killers camp but I’ve never understood camping itself. Why not go patrol gens or chase someone else down? Have fun with the game, why bother to camp just to get 1 kill when you could possibly get more by actually playing? How is staying in one spot fun??
---
Oof
---
No its not, fucking trash ass killers always gotta depend on cheap shit.
---
Looks like a swf. Not only would I have purposely tunneled I would have brought a ebony mori.
---
Wraith approves of all the bell ringing in that theme
---
You're admitting it's not in the meta, so you're admitting there are better perks, otherwise it would be in the meta. And that's not what I'm saying at all. I'm sick of this DbD community trend of people putting words in your mouth.
---
Yeah, Im aware. I asked a simple question and was made feel stupid for asking said question. And then I was attacked for retaliating. I'm not just going to be nice after that.
---
Whatever makes you sleep better at night I guess
---
Do totems next time. You clearly didn't "work your butt off" if you ignored a well known metagame mechanic, no?
---
Lol I love your flair
---
Why did noed proc?
---
Inside temple, -1 floor, all the way behind
---
You can go around it if the gen hasn't been repaired
---
I'm pretty sure that's the joke.
---
thats the first thing out of everyones mouth is the Legacy stuff.. I played a lot at launch, and wraith could prestige easy back then.. especially with the couple of days you could bell spam hooked people for near infinite blood points (even after the entity spawned to take them away).. when the point cap was broken
---
Gotta hide from seductive Davids and flashlight-wielding Neas, right?
---
I switch it up a lot try fun different builds. Im just saying you cant get into a game in red ranks without bbq, ruin and the other 2 being from a pool of like 6 perks
---
Honestly? Pretty much all the killers are great, except maybe Clown and Plague. But Michael is pretty much the most fun in the game, and allows so many different playstyles that you'll almost definitely find something you like.
---
Mildly broken just means that he's strong in a way he shouldn't be, e.g. survivors not being able to expose him after they spot him so he gets the stalk anyways.
---
If they killer was truly trash not cleaning totems is 100% on you.
---
They tried this, and they found that it just led to survivors killing themselves on first hook as soon as they were put up.
---
I don't understand the hate for using noed on certain killers sometimes it 100% necessary if your killer is low leveled I use noed on myers because it's either noed or deer stalker
---
No hex perks only work while the totem is active
---
Any killer is strong at rank 20
---
I mean did you tunnel?
---
Sorry, you're rank 15 ? Because just at these ranks people complain about Ruin, LMAO.
---
Ok yeah I just wanted to make sure I didn’t need to buy a dlc to get that perk from that dlc in the shrine of secrets. Thanks.
---
Have you maybe considered the fact that maybe you're just bad?
---
This is amazing
---
I got my nea up to level 50 and probably have gone through about 25 bloodwebs after that and still haven't got dead hard
---
I dont even know what to say except this is hilarious lmao
---
Assuming you havent bought any the hillbilly
---
Leatherface gives me anxiety for some reason.
---
&gt; easy. If they weren't they would have left and therefore not be around for the killer to even hit.
---
That makes no sense I said prove the majority of kills earned with NOED are overly altruistic survivors. You utterly failed to do that here. 
---
&gt; That is evidence of noed not being a good perk so I agree with that. You're better off taking a perk that's useful all match and bringing a mori for a kill rather than dedicating an entire perk slot to it.
---
With a mori (which gets consumed) you at least have to hook the survivor once and catch them again. With NOED (which you can bring every game) you’re almost guaranteed a free kill after even if you got no hooks the rest of the game. 
---
&gt; What are the players who are not playing survivor called again? Ticklers?
---
Defending generators is an emblem category for Killers therefore it’s one of their objectives. 5 gems popping is the Killer failing their objective
---
Thanks man!
---
*laughs in Hag*
---
Clearly not good enough
---
What’s your go to build?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DN43sCyEanA
---
Keep at it, ignore people who are b holes about things. There are plenty of nice vets who’ll be more than happy to offer advice, so stay positive and just keep learning.
---
True, and are there any you would recommend buying? Maybe a top 3
---
Ingenuous
---
Ghost Face almost as good as Spirit ? In your dreams maybe.
---
Cannibal over Hag ? Hag is an actual killer, while Cannibal is a meme by itself.
---
Missed opportunity to have The Doctor in place of Electro, Thicc Boi Clown over Green Goblin, and Swole Boi Mike over Rhino
---
Who were you facing?
---
I would say Billy is good, he is viable in all ranks, has great map pressure which will help you keep pressure on gens, and if you practice his chainsaw he can destroy a team. His only weakness is being looped, but thas most killers, plus it will help you to learn mind games.
---
Thanks
---
GF is super fun too, and his perks aren't as bad as people make them out to be. It seems like people forget how to play when you're going around as GF, so you'll get a lot of really stupid downs.
---
This is true.
---
You definatly need to buy LeatherFace as his teachable BBQ N Chill is the best. I personally enjoy the Pig and Micheal.         Also get the hags teachable called. ""Hex Ruin" you need it on all killers past rank 15
---
Yeah
---
This is a big reason why I actually prefer console. Nobody can add or message me to flame. It feels so much better. 
---
That being said, I'm verging on 800 hours in this stupid game and I'm still trash. Honestly, it sucks the soul out of you but damn if you won't keep coming back...
---
If it makes you feel any better, I have hundreds of hours in and I still suck at killer lol. Killer is not fun for me, it's a stress fest and I get teabagged constantly lol. This is why I play survivor
---
When life gives you Megs, make scrambled Megs!
---
Legend says that the message he sent the Killer post-game was saltier than a trip to the Cracker Factory.
---
Nice  :)
---
With Mother Daughter Ring + Prayer Beads or with Mother Daughter Ring + Bloody Hair Brooch, Spirit might be better than an add-onless. But other than that, no.
---
I dont get why killers use noed on killers with one shot abilities. Use a different killer with noed if you want to get the full ability use off it other they waste a perk slot.
---
While I do thinks it's silly that people were downvoting you, I think the guy was just being pragmatic, not passive aggressive
---
Have you considered the fact that maybe you're just bad? You don't do the thing that counters the perk and then get angry when the perk activates because you didn't do the thing that counters the perk. You just sound entitled to me. Sure, NOED is a bullshit perk, that's why I don't use it, but if you don't even try to counter it, that's on you.
---
Good job, but also gosh dang that's dark.
---
K ty for the clarification, wasn’t sure. Yah it probably did but that is how life can be.
---
Source your art people it ain't that hard [https://lacteaway.tumblr.com/post/174866523530/happy-anniversary-dbd-they-did-a-pretty-good](https://lacteaway.tumblr.com/post/174866523530/happy-anniversary-dbd-they-did-a-pretty-good)
---
They need to quit making new chars and fix the game
---
Yeah, I’m usually a salt mine when I face 4 man SWF because **in my anecdotal experience that does not define all players or all players’ experience don’t downvote me for the love of god I’m trying to be impartial** they’re very toxic. And lately I’ve been finding one to two red rank survivors per game even though I’m only a rank 12 killer.
---
You look board.
---
Because I don't know how to loop or run away from a killer so my best bet is to double or nothing on the locker and hope I'm not seen
---
I can't tell you how annoying this is.
---
Especially when they run off and running to the killer and get down.
---
That camping video had good logic, the circle jerking is strong with you people
---
r/thisismylifenow
---
oh yeah i always forget she exists, i barely ever see her idk why cuz i consider her lower high tier
---
I only upvote :) so do y worry there, but yeah I hear ya. I LOVE SWF, but my friends and I aren’t toxic cause we’re just laughing so much lol but I can see it, friends are out having a great time and having fun and teabagging seems kinda playful in that environment. They’re just showing off to their friends, so of course it’s toxic to the killer, but for the survivors it’s just playful. I hate how toxic so many people are, but coming from a survivor main, survivors are way more toxic than killers lol
---
how is a single use perk that requires you to live all the way to the end of the match and is countered by noed busted?
---
Same thing happened to me in the exact same spot.
---
Why did you comment
---
Practice makes perfect. Don't let it get you down, just have fun with it. You'll be decimating us survivor lobbies getting 4k's in no time 😊
---
I figured out if the killer has an anti healing build sometimes it is literally just faster to let the survivor recover themselves and then just finished them off when they can't recover anymore
---
even if you didnt do the objective, you get a free speed boost and heslth state. you can get be the first one downed by the killer whos having a rough game, and get picked right back up
---
Heard of an a hole, but never a b hole
---
Oh no I'm talking about when I'm literally on someone's ass and they jump in a locker like I don't see lmao
---
pc master race
---
highest i hit was rank 2 back in 2016.. just focusing on part farming to get everything to lvl 40
---
Im a pretty good wraith ... but some games I still get dumpstered.. can't win every game lol
---
even if I 4K .. if i dont get over 20k points, and the survivors get points too, it still feels like a loss for everyone
---
Everyone interprets it differently. It came across passive aggressive and the context was I had downvotes almost immediately after he had responded and it was very quickly that he responded
---
Just say gg and bounce.
---
Yeah I understand that completely. I hit rank 1 once and honestly, it sucked. The survivors were shittier then rank 6 (besides the occasional teabagging fire cracking hook sabotaging flashlight clicking SWF) rank really doesn’t matter that much though
---
When in starter rank I give survivors and killers a break but in higher rank in a little less so.
---
Sorry, man. It sucks. Why not stretch for a bit or alt-tab out to check your e-mail? Something to pass the time
---
Explain how all my survivors had horrid ping but my internet was running perfectly fine
---
I never said it's not meta. You're saying that it doesn't matter if a perk counters wraith since wraith isn't rank 1. Reading is hard
---
I don't complain outside of the game really but I could make a bingo board of all time quotes me/friends would say while going off. "Bullshit!" "Oh ok yeah" etc
---
As they should but they still remain busted
---
 I think even overall  the sheer amount of player to player based complaining sets DbD leagues ahead of anything I’ve ever seen. There is probably nothing that people have not complained about, and even report others over.
---
It is the only time in my life that I’ve seen people complain that someone playing on the other team, who’s entire goal is to kill them, killed them. The role is literally called “Killer” yet people seem baffled and enraged when they die. I’ve legit had people ask me why I targeted them. That would be like if someone in CoD was bitching bc I sniped them instead of the guy next to them lol
---
Rip
---
The pig, she has built in stealth and slows the game with her reverse bear traps. If you don't have her then Wraith is a good killer.
---
I find it hard to believe you’re rank 7 killer and asking questions like this
---
doctors with restraint addons:
---
i’m about to end this whole man’s career
---
who the fuck is that guy
---
And him yelling at you makes you more unsteady with the flashlight.
---
There are situations when you don’t get to do safe unhooks but the point is to not take them off the hook when you KNOW the killer is right there.
---
You have ascended my friend. Few obtain this privilege
---
[removed]
---
You think Ruin is toxic?
---
its not that unusual. the maps are randomized and theres always a chance of getting the same map over and over. for the past couple days ive got nothing but macmillan.
---
I was just thinking from the perspective of making her more fun to use I don’t think it should be as big as the survivors FOV. Ghostface has his stealth but it’s main purpose isn’t to sneak up on survivors like it is for the Pig. In her current state it’s nearly impossible to sneak up on good survivors or even mind-game around pallets unless the survivor messes up really bad making, in most cases, her only useful ability being her traps which can also be negated on someone’s first box. If she did have a tight 3rd person view while crouching in her current state I could see her actually being somewhat of a threat to go against.
---
if you're nothing without bugged wake up you don't deserve it
---
Did you listen yet?🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
I remember when I stopped playing for a while and got back to rank 18 and had around 400 hours.
---
I got matched against a killer that barely knew anything about the game. In the post game chat I offered my help, so we went to discord and I gave him some tips and knowledge about the mechanics and taught him a lot of stuff.
---
He sent me a picture of his first 4k after 15 hours of gameplay and, even thought it was still rank 18, he was proud as fuck.
---
Now he's there with the big bois mindgaming the shit out of every survivor and running from killers like wind.
---
Good times.

Just cleanse 5 totems forehead - a typical answer of a autistic dickhead
---
If you looking to have fun I’d go with Freddy, pig or Myers. 
---
If you want points go for Leatherface.
---
If you want good perks go with pig or Leatherface  
---
I’m ignoring the other killers since you can unlock those for free
---
Hey if you end up getting a party together or something im pretty new to the game and would play with ya!
---
Gamertag is Shakira1976
---
Why are you mad about people using the perks? I’m not actually *mad* it’s just a little annoying and childish because there’s too much of this shit.
---
No way boi her limbs are being held together by magical ghost energy so I dont think they'd fly off the hinges
---
;( i worded it wrong i guess, i meant to say how to slow down the game. but my wording was dumb and weird.
---
u fucking kidding me? killers are at their prime rn

Man, you're really not getting this. I'll try to be as obvious as possible here: I never said there was anything wrong with survivor perks, just stating that in rank 1 they're always running full meta perks. I never said I have a hard time playing Nurse at rank 1 against survivors with full meta perks.
---
The **only** thing relevant to my post you've included here is that you agreed with it:
---
&gt;I agree you can't pick her and immediately 4k
---
Literally everything else you've said is based off on your own stupid assumptions or misunderstandings. Obviously you meant to reply to me, so I guess it's like I said: you have the reading comprehension skills of a 5 year-old with down syndrome.
---
🤣
---
I play a ton of killer and the tools the game gives you to buy time to rush gens is plenty. And yeah I do think at least in higher ranks the killer just does not have enough tools to keep up with high rank survivors there is a gap when you hit a high level and it's been there a while. So I welcome any and all buffs to killers because of this blatant and obvious gap that only the highest ranked will clearly see
---
It’s rare though, at least for me. I usually get them once I already started another game which makes it hard to respond. I wanna go in on them too lol
---
Haha same
---
alright, i'll wait for ruin in the shrine and play billy until i find it i guess, i know that i have to hook them more than once, but i had to focus on a gen on a part of the map, and then go back to the area where i knew they were healing so i had to go back and forth until the final gen got done.
---
what a pussy this ace was, well done, also the plag was able to grab you no?
---
Probably didn't properly leave, and just pulled the plug instead. Full BP, escape points, and deny the killer the points and stacks they should've gotten.
---
Who is this "wraith"? Don't you mean "Ding Dong guy"?
---
I have none of those perks yet I hit them anyway, If I loose the survivor so what. I have 3 of them down on the ground I say good trade.
---
That literally happened I don't play plauge but I had a daily to chase for 180 secs
---
Huge difference between 7 and 3. Quit being a cunt.
---
So... You literally explained why that could happened and I'm telling you it's happening all the time.... It's not just killers internet it's something wrong with connecting regions or server issues

Isn't joking about sort of the opposite of being mad about something? I'm laughing at people, not getting mad at them. That comment was a bit of a reach.
---
No shit, not what I said though.
---
I decided to play Stare only Michael and 2 people DC'd. Guess they were scared
---
How do you control blink distance? Much less chained blinks
---
What im saying is you can’t excuse the fact he isn’t viable because he is strong against 20’s.
---
I had one to chase survivors for a total of 180 seconds yesterday, I’m not sure if it was bugged or I’m a moron but it would only go up about ten seconds per game regardless of how long I chased survivors. I followed a nea for five generators and it went up ten seconds.
---
Love when ny fellow survivors DC. It makes the game a lot more fun
---
Apparently it's now suppose to be non-directional now. Umbra was chatting with a mod and they talked about it. Just never got to the patch notes.
---
I love that claud's in the bush.

I never said that. Just that he's stronger than most killers in 12+

I'm a bubba main and every 20 matches or so I bust out a basement insidious build with a speed limiter/exhaust on my chainsaw. I try not to be to toxic with it and make it fun lol.
---
No need to take any insults from them. Just laugh it off. They have over a thousand hours and need to derank and Bully Noob Killers to feel good at the game. They also need meta perks and survive with friends on comms.
---
People don't want to hear it, but I am going to say it anyway. 
---
There are more killers than survivors; This is not something that the matchmaking can fix. You want shorter killer queue times? Find out why a lot of survivors switched to playing killer (or stopped playing at all) and fix that. I will give you a few hints:
---
1- Major nerfs to survivors in every patch. Playing solo at the moment is a nightmare and frustrating. I understand that some perks needed some tweaking. But some changes were really unnecessary such as the fast vaulting nerfs. 
---
2- Game breaking bugs such as the broken audio (where you cant hear the heart beat, chase music, nurse blinks, billy chainsaw ... etc) which has not even been acknowledged by the devs.
---
3- Broken hitboxes.
---
After a few patches, you guys would sit in lobby simulators for hours with nobody joining if the devs keep going in the same direction (nerfing survivors to the ground gradually with every patch).
---
I mean, the first Scream movie technically established that if we really wanna reach.
---
Yes, as Operation said, the EGC will start upon the killer finding the hatch. 
---
One thing to note - if you are survivor and it is taking a while for the EGC to start, there is a chance the killer has found the hatch and is waiting. This is especially common when the hatch spawns on a hill but some killers will camp an open hatch and wait to spot a hatch-hunting survivor nearby before closing it and chasing. 
---
I recommend looking for the hatch cautiously against stealth killers and if you see a killer near it, find a far gate, wait for his patience to run out, and hope you have enough time to open it. Sometimes, opening it just a bit before the red light comes on (about to the “E”) and then hiding can allow you enough time for the killer to check, think you’re not there, and rush to the other gate while you finish opening it. It’s still risky but often the best chance you have if they don’t have Whispers.
---
Just have every noise in the game be a waluigi soundboard
---
Yeah man, I was going to stand and shield him in case she came but he just bailed
---
Had this happen to me TWICE as Leatherface. Thank god for playing as a character that can destroy pallets with a chainsaw.
---
Leatherface: D I T T O
---
Killer's so surprised that a grab actually went off that they have to take a second to think about it.
---
Killers have absolutely zero obligation to make the game "fun" for survivors. Everyone is in charge of their own fun, not the opposing side.
---
Not really, just the way I like to play
---
What
---
Since this is marked as Salt/Rant i assume you're serious so: Why do you get triggered by a silly animation so much that you want to ruin the game for another player?
---
Can someone please tell me why the better the player rank, the more toxic the post lobby chat is? Thx
---
your build is a fucking menace and it will probably not even work against a decent squad, but yeah you're right, you shouldn't have gotten depipped for a 4k
---
Trap be nimble, trap be quick
---
also, like, you could have went behind cover instead of literally standing still in front of him and giving him free stalk? why would you ever do that, especially if you don’t completely understand where he has to be on your screen? He also may have had add ons to reduce detection range, which would have made what you did useless, since he was relatively far.

How do you have colored perks?!?!•_•
---
Clenched butt cheeks
---
As opposed to sitting in a party, in a game together, and complaining about the game from a survivors perspective.
---
This is why I gave up playing killer completely and only play survivor now
---
HEAD ON APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD
---
Because people actually care at lower ranks
---
Your Welcome, ;)
---
I mean yeah you can use it doesn’t mean I gotta play nice when you use it
---
What a fucking legend! And the fact you did it on a billy is even better, screw them!
---
Oh jesus, I hate toxic killers like that. Such bad sportsmanship.
---
Head on! Apply directly to the billy
---
So I’ve posting this twice before but I really thing it can help new killers so I’m going to copy and paste one of my old comments below:
---
The thing that helped me was during the lunar event I didn’t kill anyone. I just hooked the twice and the third time I’d take them to a hook and drop them in front so they could be healed.
---
Not killing does two things.
---
First off it helps stop you from developing salty feelings. If you achieve your goal of hooking everyone twice you feel good. If you do not reach your goal then that’s ok cause you were going to let everyone live anyway, and the game was harder on you anyways cause you couldn’t remove any gen repairing pairs of hands.
---
Any hatemail you end up getting loses it’s impact. If they say you sucked well that’s cause you were purposely not killing them, if they accuse you of tunnelling or camping well that’s funny cause you were actually hoping they would get unhooked.
---
The second thing it does is give you crazy good practice at the game. As I said playing this way makes the game harder so it causes your skill to increase quicker.
---
When you go back to killing you will have a different outlook on survivors. Not killing them can cause a weird fondness for them that I found lasts. It will also make your gameplay stronger allowing for more wins which is very satisfying.
---
Anyway I hope this helps :) Do it for a week or two it made a huge difference for me when I did it.
---
Edit: For all they same reasons above this is also a great way to get good with a killer you might want to play but currently suck at. I learned to play Freddy really well during the lunar event and now he is my strongest killer.
---
Ignore survivors. If it's negative it's bs usually unless they don't start out with ggez, baby killer, and get gud. Then it should be some constructive criticism.
---
&lt;3
---
Reason?
---
Since they didn’t bother to put effort into the rework he is shit. I’m a legion main that wishes they would have made usable add-ons for him.
---
I had the opposite happen. I get unhooked with we’ll make it and then they just run off
---
There's being passionate about a game, and there's being a kn*b head...
---
Mad Grit has the benefit of also stalling the wiggle meter, if you get dumb enough survivors you can get someone to the basement from the other side of the map.
---
Ah, yes. The Freddy.
---
I’ll take the bait. He’s like every other killer, you just haven’t figured out how to play against him yet.
---
Really? Are all killers the same speed? I can never outrun or weave to avoid ghostface. I just don't understand how to avoid him.
---
Is hag still useless?
---
Taking both into account
---
Clown. I cannot  chase a clown for the life of me.
---
Bloodhound and Sloppy Butcher to become a tracking god. (Warning: doesn’t work against No Mither)
---
O I know, I get messages every time I play killer... camping, tunneling, scummy tactics... the list is endless. It usually results from me not being able to leave the hook because everyone hook dives at low ranks. Just message them gg and move on.
---
This is me against red ranks lol when I'm green it's fun XD
---
Have these caused any problems with AntiCheat for anyone?
---
Dis meeee
---
I probably have a few hundred hours as survivor over the last few years but my boyfriend literally convinced me to try killer like 2 weeks ago omfg
---
I'm not terrible, got a few 4 pieces. Mostly I'm afraid of survive w friends. ; w ;
---
try to play killer, and you se how fast they can get out.
---
So I can just drag the files in the game folders and I’ll be good?
---
The picture or scenario? Lol
---
According to a lot of killer mains it's easy to get to red ranks as Survivior
---
Technically this match is what BHVR sees as a balanced outcome. 2 kills, 2 escapes
---
It affects both gates no regardless of whether they’re already open or not. All it needs is one gate to be open before the survivor is hooked for it to be active
---
Well no wonder they got mad... everyone knows that when capturing an objective in any combat based game you are supposed to ask them politely to please leave the objective. I know it may seem confusing since  you spawn with a weapon and all of the controls, tips and game mechanics are geared towards killing other players, but obviously that isn’t what you are supposed to do. Battles are supposed to be won with kind words and proper manners.
---
Billy is superior in every way. He can’t get multihits, but he has way more map pressure, whereas leatherface has close to none. I feel like hillbilly has a bit more control over his chainsaw, and a hillbilly with BBQ or other aura reading perks is way stronger than a LF with the same.
---
Facts. My friends and I be playing till like 5 am
---
It’s what we deserve.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I literally made this and posted it like 2 weeks ago.... check my account. Feels bad man 😞
---
I’m really not enjoying EGC. I know it forces moves from survivors, but it really doesn’t give enough time to open anything should you have to deviate from opening a door (like getting found by the killer).  Great job on the escape though, your build and skill got you out in the nick of time!
---
It really should be 1 pip for a bare minimum 4k like this. Same with a survivor actually surviving.
---
Lol I’m flipping through reddit and I see the meme that I made get on the front page.... feels so bad
---
Thank you, I see this on the front page and notice that hey.... I made that
---
Feels bad when someone else gets on the front page from my meme
---
I’ve been seeing a lot of hag on ps4 in addition to those you mentioned
---
Cant cleanse totems eh?
---
Dude should have a nap next time he gets to the camp fire
---
Meaning she becomes REALLY strong
---
What is EGC
---
Don’t worry in like another 20 you be part of the community and be shitting on baby killers and complaining how nurse is bs and Freddy needs a re work
---
I'd get the hint fast tbh
---
All the gens getting done =/= failure.
---
oh poor baby. better go flex
---
Just unlucky depending who you ask. Indoor maps are considered more killer sided. Depending on the killer you might have lower odds of escape.
---
Is the original pic Shaq?
---
I love the pig/jigsaw's killer music!! I've been playing her a ton lately and I noticed you can hear some sick bass riffs when crouched! B )
---
in the time it takes you to down someone after hitting them initially, then picking them up, carrying them to a hook, and hooking them, the cooldown is over. The cooldown is pretty good, compared to some other killers cooldowns, even without addons.
---
yes it is not necessary to install all you must choose between the 3 file of power
---
I remember I saw this yesterday!
---
I'm just as sick of my survivors' net connection disconnecting them as they are 😂
---
Which is fine, there's people that legit enjoy playing him.
---
new to game why is this bad?
---
Cool. Don't care. I wasn't the first to be "uncivil"
---
They’re in the rotation still, sorry if I made that unclear. You don’t need the offering.
---
I only play as frank haha still saving for susie and joey
---
Is that a thing? Yeah it would definitely make me very happy 😃
---
The game is designed so that some things will be overpowered and underpowered. That’s what asymmetrical means.
---
There's something called a wall. Your in game vision cannot look past walls. Spinechill works past walls.
---
again, asymmetrical. I don’t deny the game is poorly designed in a lot of ways, and I’ve even made posts about how the developers aren’t good at designing the game and are way out of touch. Plus, like, some of the things you’re talking about are choices the individual players make, not necessarily facets of the games design or things they intended (flashlight spamming, tbagging, camping, etc- though these are vastly different things, as a tbag is nowhere near as powerful as camping can be, so I’m not even sure what the argument to be made there is?) there’s a lot of problems with the game itself, but there’s a lot of problems with the community. It is a 4v1 asymmetrical PVP and the killers all have vastly different powers and there are several dozens of perks to choose from, so perfectly balancing it will be impossible. This is true for many competitive games that offer various customizations (like skills and abilities). This is how they intended to design the game. What do you really expect?
---
This was my reasoning with decisive strike (I was 100% okay with it as a killer) but it got nerfed
---
My dream flashlight is that one but with long life battery
---
Thanks 😁
---
I think he would be creepier if he wasn’t morbidly obese
---
BBQ and IM take up half of the killer’s perks just for that
---
It isnt about perfect balance, it's just about the balance being better than what it is now
---
It is as swf.
---
Upvoted for sweetest meth boy.
---
Fucking NOED
---
the effect only last 15 seconds shouldn't even be a problem for you with most killers
---

---
No you
---
It’s always the last one you open too
---
Why you took ring? You prefer bloody build or you playing too good for reading survivors? And which perks you're using on your spirit?  And do any of you guys know pro killer who mains spirit, i'd like to see his videos?
---
I meant if I am under it's effect then I will heal others slowly. If that isn't the case then I am mistaken which is fine cause I smoke kush while I play so my mind may be playing tricks on me lmao
---
Well played!
---
Also, the same can be said for Michael! Based on various addons and a trophy for him, they wanted you to play stealthy with him and find cover to stalk, but he doesn’t need to do that. If that’s your complaint, then why aren’t you complaining about Michael too?
---
They’re working to do that. Why do you think MoM and DS got nerfed so hard, and various killer perks got buffed? The game has been unbalanced literally since release, and I’d argue that right now, it’s more balanced than its ever been.
---
Sometimes not countering BBQ is the better play because it gives the killer a next target away from the hooked guy and creates an opportunity for other survivors to make a save.
---
As a survivor who usually plays with a slightly aggressive friend, I always try to stay long in the end screen if the killer was either "toxic" or did exceptionally bad. 9/10 times it's just someone who's barely played and they usually get bombarded with insults before they can even defend themselves. I think every survivor is guilty, myself included, of at least occasionally letting a win or loss get to them a little too much. 
---
Hope you get better and become a surv stomping killer friend!
---
Thank you!
---
You’re welcome!

Would also like to know, on PS4, myself.

That looks like it was a bloodweb from a seasonal event in the past? If you level that current web, the next one shouldn't have those lines any more.
---
Still a huge difference between 7 and 3.
---
And you can't edit titles. Should say "to make it looks like he's farming"
---
If you don't take the time to figure out how she works, yeah.
---
Damn!! Nice escape!!
---
&gt;These aren't my post as my post pertains to the bloodweb itself rather than keeping the offering, if the offering can be found in the bloodweb in like, a year. Not whether or not I can still use them
---
The event isn't over yet, of course you are finding the in your bloodwebs.
---
I mean it’s valid in a lot of cases, If the survivors work on generators effectively he will essentially lose the game but there should be some kind of rank bonus for having the killer face camp you. “High priority target” and additional points having a generator completed while the killer is within “X” meters. It’s going to happen, wether it’s a random or a friend. Sometimes it’s the “right” choice and other times the killer just sticks to what works.

Some DbD YouTubers will run in a super tight zigzag when they're getting from point A to point B outside of a chase. Does that help with spreading out scratch marks? Is there a practical purpose behind it?
---
When your manager says they don’t play favorites, yet they keep asking you to do overtime at 4:55pm while the hot chick gets to go home early:
---
But you get punished for doing it as killer. Yet when he says he doesn't care about rank or BP, he doesn't give a shit that the one person's game is ruined even though the other 3 may do gens. We said this in post-game and he just said "yeah well I don't care"
---
As you said tunneling is focusing only on 1 survivor, if i kill the person that just got unhooked thats not tunneling. Im not chasing that player because if want specifically him dead, im chasing him because its the weakest target. Unless the person unhooking is injured i always chase down the other once since you can get him back on the hook pretty fast if you are around when that happens.
---
I'm ranked 2 right now and I've noticed at red ranks, there are far more 4man SWF than the other ranks. I think having the communication is a HUGE crutch/advantage and probably the reason why they rank up so high. It helps with the lack of skill they may have. So honestly, they're probably all green ranks if they played on their own.
---
why on dwight ????
---
Animal Crossing map when
---
Isabelle as survivor when
---
Nook as debt collecting killer when
---
He loots so much he's got flashlights coming out of his ass.
---
There's something up with the sound in this video that makes the spirit's sound wayyy creepier.
---
Hello darkness my old friend....
---
A lot of the "stress" for me is due to the complete and utter shit totem system, if I did not have to worry about ruin/lullaby going down so easy the game would be a lot more fun playing killers other then the chosen ones (billy, nurse, spirit) 
---
but like you I switch to survivor when I want to relax..
---
I‘ve played against those often enough in my 3 years of DbD-Experience. In those cases I play Nurse/Spirit but NoeD is still a no go for me.
---
I played a few games as trapper to figure shit out, then my first game as Pig I got a 4k, my second I tried to be a nice killer and let the 4th escape (probably what Jogsaw would've wanted).
---
Representing: my life
---
Do you know the name of the movie?
---
You can say that it's toxic and it'll be a popular opinion, I'm not gonna argue how people should feel about the matter. But if can get the kill and it's not cheating, the killer is just playing the game, that's what I think
---
I feel like Ghostface is never going to work with how this community is. They added the reveal mechanic. He was initially easier to break out of it. Like survivors could do it by spin ing their camera. So they made a sweet spot for it. Wasn't good enough because survivors want to be able to moonwalk loop him while revealing him. They made it bigger. Survivors can also reveal him from behind cover.
---
Still apparently not good enough. I dont see this going well. I love GF and I love playing against him because I took the time to learn the sweet spot. Apparently other people don't want to do that. If he didn't have the revealing sweet spot, then he wouldn't have a power. And against survivors that aren't potatoes he basically doesn't.
---
With this attitude they will never experiment with new killer mechanics because apparently survivors don't want to learn new things.
---
10 outta 10
---
This doesn’t even make sense to me. 
---
You’re trash bc you won’t against a NON SWF? This post gave me a headache lol.
---
When I play survivor its always solo and its still relaxing compared to killer..
---
I mean sometimes a survivor will be a jackass and point you out to killers but thats nothing.
---
Oof my bad 😬 it's supposed to be 2 survivors but I think it still makes sense

It was OP as hell on non-obsessions. There was no way of knowing it was there until it was too late, and 0 counterplay perks are always frustrating. Honestly tho I like it a lot more where it is now.
---
It always worked like that
---
How did that Quentin even survive?
---
But frank, julie and susie dont have big enough eye holes to see
---
Ruin I can see, all the others are pretty much worthless as if you're good, games will often end before gens are done. Nasty Nurse build would consist of Ruin, Whispers, BBQ, and Infectious Fright. So good if you can down quick.

Pretty sure its a scene from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs on netflix. Could be wrong
---
Had some idiot message me about how trash I am even though I hooked him got two kills and a disconnect.
---
Lmao yea I suppose you’re right I fucked up I killed the dude to take the objective when what i should’ve done was send him a postcard politely asking him to leave the objective and let me take it over
---
No clue, maybe he used Dead Hard on the first killer swing? Glad he did though, saving him wasn’t in vain.
---
Or me just trying to do my bing bong, zip zap, or trip clap rituals, I let them all go and get called garbage.
---
Doesn't really matter just make sure you buy a licensed killer you can grind and get the rest with shards
---
Cheating.
---
Probably won’t believe the story if it wasn’t recorded, goddamn nice
---
yeah this pallet stop your massacre , last time i see this bug it is in 2016
---
Look at me. You’re the pallet now.
---
He means when you put Joey's mask on Frank, Susie, or Julie, they should have the makeup around their eyes as well, like he himself does.
---
I have p3 survivors and get literally amazing add ons and items on my Jane, whom I’ve went through hundreds of bloodwebs without prestiging her.   
---
I think they debunked that and there’s a very small percentile you get something of higher rarity.  Each bloodweb I get at least 2 insta heals and countless BPS.
---
In other hands, nurse is very broken and op
---
Ok that gave  me a chuckle
---
You do, if you’re in a certain radius of someone that has We’ll Make It active, it pops up on the left side of your screen. This includes when it becomes active after unhooking. People who run usually either don’t see it, don’t know what it means, or don’t care.
---
Oh right that makes more sense haha
---
I just googled it and apparently she is a DLC character. I play PS4 and bought from the Playstation store and it came with Feng so i guess she's included with at least the PS4 version.
---
I guess I’ve never been unhooked by someone who runs it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
How are they supposed to know that this is their first time playing in 2 years lol
---
Atleast you didn't join in 1.9.4.....
---
It didn't hit nothin' important
---
The first time I played killer, I played Wraith.  It gave me the impression that he was way stronger than he actually is because I went up against people who I think had the same mindset as that, they literally had no idea what was happening lmao.

I'm getting 4+ iridescent things every bloodweb at p3 and begin to see iridescent at like level 10 of p3

Well, and immersed survivors usually just don’t do anything.  Including gens, literally the objective.

Gotta get that 6% extra speed.
---
remember when rituals were actually 10x harder/longer to do. Hell, remember when pig's ritual was to kill 1 person with a bear trap and even that was too annoying.

Ruin isn’t toxic but nurse and billy really don’t need it seeing as how much map pressure they have. A good nurse with infectious fright will have everyone downed before two gens are done

No

He’s a narcissistic, whiny, obnoxious man with very little skill in the game but he won’t admit that. To him, it’s always “killers are underpowered! survivors OP!!”, even now that the two sides have never been so balanced. His response to the reaction he got on his “Killer Tier List” video a while back spoke VOLUMES to his character. He placed Hag very low and placed Micheal very high, and while explaining his reasoning, it became VERY clear that he didn’t know how to play the Hag. People commented in droves, saying that they disagreed with him because Hag is quite good in the hands of a talented player. He got really hostile to a lot of people and refused to acknowledge a single point, claiming that his 4 stack was able to beat the Hag every time they played against her. It was utterly embarrassing to witniss a grown ass man act so childish.
---
My tierlist goes a little something like this:
---
Nurse
---
Spirit
---
Billy/Hag/Huntress
---
Myers/Ghostface/Plague
---
Clown/Leatherface/Doctor/Pig/Legion
---
Wraith/Freddy
---
I usually like to judge my killers with no addons, so people like doc would be different if I did account for addons.
---
Like people have said, billy will probably be your best start. He has a learning curve, but is very straight forward. Getting to know his mechanics will reward you tremendously.
---
No, she's just a voodoo monster.
---
As a bubba main I got to say yes he's easy to loop and shit like that but he's not that bad once you understand how to oneshot. When you catch up to a survivor and you know there is no window or pallet nearby rev that bad boi up and drop him. Use knockout and deerstalker and just drop them all.
---
Ghostface? Broken? That's rank 20 at least.
---
I haven't met a single farming killer on Ps4. Not that it matter really but I have only met thirsty try hards and I have played about 6 hours a day every day during the event.
---
Why is it when playing The Pig , if you set a trap on survivors they can just simply walk / crawl out of the exit gates and even jump through the hatch.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I have had multiple games where this has occurred and it has left me pondering why , is this a bug , does the trap have to be active in red for it to trigger? 
---
It feels like i am wasting my time playing the Pig if my primary ability does not work as identified through the tooltip.
---
I just ragequit the other day because i placed a trap on a survivor , hooked them. ran to get others , the exit gate opened and the survivor that had a trap on it that was hooked , got unhooked and ran straight out the gates.
---
? no, if both survivors hold the crouch button and crouch away from the trap it wont activate
---
absolutely unreal that you only got to Lvl 35 (assuming you started from 1). Bloodweb prices need a FAT rehaul.
---
Not to mention some adults who do choose their own internet but can't afford the high speed ones. Good internet is expensive.
---
Probably should have ran a better perk than Tinkerer to help you protect the gens...
---
Stfu your probably a toxic cunt yourself.
---
Heyo. Does the order of add-on to your item matter anymore? I remember that before it was proven that ex. flashlight then battery-low amp filament would give you more time to use flashlight than low amp- battery. Thanks
---
Yes! That too,  and rushing to unhook before the killer even gets two feet away getting you tunneled. We are playing with 3 of us right now, so we only have to deal with 1 random and they have all been garbage. Either not helping with saves, not helping with gens or Non stop leading the killer and unhooking infront of the killed. It gets annoying,  and I'm rank 7 you'd think I would be getting better team mates lol
---
At least [REDACTED] is in the [REDACTED] now.
---
Exactly what I was thinking. LOL.
---
Start chasing, stop crawling.
---
BEAUTIFUL
---
oh right how stupid of me to forget that using a perk makes it op lol my bad
---
Been like this for a while. Devs don't know how to make the matchmaking efficient. Also depends on when you're playing.
---
&gt;20,000 bloodpoints
---
Oink
---
None of my  friends play dbd, but somehow i exactly know this feeling.
---
I'm not actually. I do gens, get people off the hook. I'm just saying, people are gonna play how they want. There's no need to whine on reddit about it.
---
I didn't mean to direct that at you. I'm just saying that as a Nurse main, ya gotta get the fuck over the "entity displeased" signs you'll get when learning her. Bc padding ur performance with Noed is only gonna make it harder when BHVR eventually decides they're gonna address the perk and make it less useful for you, which is gonna slaughter you. That's why I never used Noed. 
---
On another note if ur a good Nurse and you use NOED: dude how small is your penis? That's a legit question too bc only truly toxic nurses play her well and run Noed.
---
We are talking about before EGC.
---
Not just a repost, but a repost of what was a weaker version of the original idea. We inception now boys
---
Same! Then you wanna message the toxic survivors who surprisingly use the setting that they can’t get messaged by strangers 🤔
---
Then itll be an insidious leatherface
---
I wish. Jumping between 1 and 2. The amount of Hillbillys and Prayer Beads Spirits I’ve faced today... Let’s not talk about it. The most frustrating thing ever. I also play solo. I’ve never won against a Prayer Bead Spirit who has good hearing.
---
Ltm, what is this, fortnite?
---
Were already getting a battlepass, please stop.
---
I think he thought I ran to the other exit and wanted to intercept and hook me. That’s the only possible explanation.
---
Yet we've seen nerfs to two dumb survivor perks(They are dumb because they were broken and skewered the game balance) - Noed's the same. It skewers the game balance the moment it comes into play. 
---
Experienced killers really shouldn't need something to skewer the balance. It's in the same boat as huntresses with i-heads, spirits with prayer beads, nurses with triple blink, or jus moris as a whole. It just takes away a ton of the skill element that makes the game interesting for both sides, and completely flips it in favour of one of them.
---
This is still an ongoing matchmaking “thing”. It’s not a bug but until we get dedicated servers, because the Killer hosts the match and they queue alone, the survivors have no point of reference to join back to. BE mapped out being able to remain in groups during sometime in the road map, but for now, just gotta keep redoing everything if you get dodged.
---
Tell me if you heard this one before “killers like you ruin the game”
---
Yes because her movement speed is really slow compared to other Killers. The hatchets help end the chases early
---
Real talk though, I use Iron maiden on my huntress purely because it opens lockers faster, and combined with the reload speed add-on, you can reload midchase and still down them with a snipe
---
The exposed survivor leaving a locker is just an added bonus if it happens
---
coz truth sometimes stings
---
If you bring an ebony you probably won’t pip, unless you hook most survivors twice
---
I just think it’s more of a twitchy side effect for keeping your fingers alert to make spins, turn corners tight enough to stay optimal  or whatever you’re doing. It’s not going to assist in any juking because you’re still running in a straight line, but nothin mechanically close enough to be concerning.
---
Um,  maybe don't tunnel them directly off the hook to insta kill them. This isn't a "good" match you were obviously camping and playing toxic. Lmfao.
---
Sounds like you’re someone who needs swf to be good
---
I'm pretty sure that was his plan too. I just don't get why, since he has a clear indicator of the timer. Was no way you were getting to that door in time
---
Jesus, every time I scroll through I find a video like this and I get motion sick. Fix your recordings, christ.
---
Not yet. It’s on my bucket list. It is especially funny because I try my hardest to avoid doing things that are looked down upon and I try to punish shitty teammates. For example: for a survivor unhooks their teammate right in front of me, I will let the wounded one go and hunt the unhooker to the ends of the earth.
---
when will dedicated servers come out?
---
Yes it is. Unless the survivor is out in the open with no structures/pallets to use, it is often the best choice to make. Huntress is slow and does not have a way to move quicker so she's incredibly 'loop-able' without hatchets.
---
Oh, two cakes and streamers,  you WAY shorted yourself by your own play style. Ending with 17k feels bad when killers usually end up with 31k, all because you wanted to tunnel and kill as fast as you could.
---
24m is within the terror radius of most Killers (32m). A killer that is standing within that 24m radius is less than 5 seconds away since most move at 115%, or 4.6 meters per second, which is more than enough time for them to run up as you’re being unhooked and make a lunge, which itself as a move has a speed of 6.9m/s.
---
I can never manage to crawl my way down to red ranks because I play solo. It's just a death sentence to being camped or left on the hook to die when all generators are done, even though I ran the kilelr around for the last three generators, and I can barely scrape together a safety pip because you can only get so many accolade points by being chased
---
This is so sarcastic I love it
---
It says "the Legion" sorry... I tried to blend it in the table while trying to make it readable at the same time
---
1 bloodpoint awarded
---
Nurse, Huntress, Plague, Legion, Hillbilly, mindgaming, and reaction time are all skills in this game. I’m not sure exactly what you’re looking for, it’s not like this is MK11 or something intricate like Starcraft. I guess if you’re using your toes, more power to you, Plague Main, but playing at a semi/decent competitive level does requires more knowledge of tiles and time management than anything else.
---
I've done it plenty at green/purple ranks too. If you phase frequently during the chase, or when starting one, they'll expect it. Then, after the third time, just phase and they'll be waiting on the other side, to throw off their expectations, and you'll get them jumping back into your arms again
---
no need to be sorry because this fan art is amazing
---
If you spam 3+ traps at every hook and chase survivors with 6+ traps in pocket, yes. 
---
Hag is medium key one of the top 5 best killers imo.
---
They actually had that for a bit, where killer proximity slows entity progression, but they removed it.
---
i'M mInDgAmInG
---
If you could tell when she started phasing, it would be mindgame, because at least you'd know she couldn't tell if you vaulted the pallet. As-is, it's entirely on the survivor to guess
---
If they're rank 7, chances are they've been rank 3 before. Rank is still a poor indication of skill because even a potato survivor plays enough, they'll get to rank 3. That's why even at red ranks, you find potato survivors that don't know how to properly loop and are easy to down. Just today I ran into a rank 2 adam and rank 3 dwight that could've fooled me for a rank 15.
---
I know that sound in background anywhere. That's a PS4 about to lift off
---
Because people, for as long as history has been recorded, are terrible.
---
Everyone can tell by the points what you did,  so stop making excuses and trying to act like a badass because you camped. Lol.
---
Ok, thank you.

I get you, it's just a hard mindset to shake.

His add on class photo makes him an incredibly good killer. Basically the key is making sure the survivors are spending their entire time trying to waking up. Class photo lets you see everyone when you put someone to sleep. So put someone to sleep, maybe give them a hit if you can and then head to the others and put them to sleep.
---
Games can tend to go on for long, but in the end as long as you maintain the pressure and keep them sleeping you'll get a 3 to 4k almost every game.
---
That makes sense, thanks.
---
He was probably using an overlay. A lot of monitors have them built in and there's a few programs for them. Some people just stick a cheerio in the middle of their screen and call it a day.
---
Not bannable since it doesn't tamper with game files, it's *technically* cheating. But it's cheating in the same way that SWF voice comms are cheating.
---
I meant people give me the most crap when I use self-care lol. I think it’s more than worth the 36 seconds it takes.
---
Now that’s more like it!
---
I'm not saying it doesn't have its purpose, but again, if the killer is running BBQ and iron maiden, then they've likely gimped themselves in some other area you can capitalize on, whether it be chases or gen rushing.
---
You didn't see the game. Looking for actual advice here. I try to avoid camping as Bubba since that's the stigma around him, its probably more the early mori that threw out the pip. You're obviously not stupid, so if you have any advice on how to stop a gen rush, I'd take it.
---
I dont think you can say its an abuse you can just hold your exhaustion at the lowest to sctivate the perk when you want
---
Is this a screenshot of the game? Because it's Seems pretty legit
---
Like 5 meters off the hook, then mori
---
Bruh 😂
---
They just were who I found after they went off hook, I wanted the other guy, but he wasn't there when I got back to the hook. I just followed scratch marks and found the Laurie off the hook. In hind sight, probably shouldn't have moried.
---
why does laurie look horny?
---
I agree 100%, but it's just really frustrating to get hit by.
---
Waiting in killer lobby for ~10min just to get SWF party with ranked 1 friend who makes your learning process frustrating and even impossible :c feels bad man
---
And btw this is the only game I know where chat is not needed to be humiliated
---
Has nothing to do with my comment, but ok
---
You can pause the game to see the offerings I’m pretty sure
---
Overlay. Not bannable. Morally questionable, but play how you want.
---
would have been smart to just hook them a 2 time just saying.
---
I just had this happen as Freddy. The survivors t bagged for a few minutes then starting jumping across. I finally timed a grab right and escaped.
---
*Made with mematic*
---
Thank you :D
---
Trapper my Waifu 4 laifu
---
Well how else I’m going to make a meme without a computer :(
---
People that try to win tend to rank up. People that tend to win tend to get mad when the game goes badly for them or people play in a way that violates their made up rules. It's not a rule, but this means that people at higher ranks are more likely to be angry at things they don't like, especially if it means losing your precious rank. Some people are always nice though. I strive to be.
---
Thanks man. I probably was a little toxic with the early mori, and honestly I shouldn't be using the ebony moris when I'm grinding blood points. I am working on getting ruin, and I'm going to try the snowball thing.
---
Awesome art, I really wish I was a much better animator. Some of you people on the subreddit are so talented. Shame it's the legion though.
---
That's not how it works. The 60 seconds start AFTER they're unhooked.
---
If a Survivor can't even avoid going down when the door is wide open, why do they deserveto escape?
---
If Pig's traps stop working at endgame, so should DS.
---
So I have to camp, then? How is that any better than tunnelling?
---
Ghostface being so strong means a lot of killer mains are having fun with a new, strong killer. It should die down over time. No new survivor, so survivor players have nothing 'new' enticing them to play a ton. Also, due to the event cake giving so many bloodpoints, since killer gets more, killer is a more efficient bloodpoint farm than normal. However if you take into account matchmaking, I think you'll actually earn more as survivor since you play more matches.
---
In addition to what the others said, a red circle will appear around your player icon. It's a timer and will go down, you stop being exposed when it finishes.
---
Why would I try to pick someone up, after I've already hooked them, if I have an Ebony Mori? Idiot.
---
Also, I have the same problems with those as this. A lack of counter-play.
---
Top tier post
---
Legion’s lore and appearance/overall aesthetic is pretty amazing though.
---
As a Plague player, I can tell you right now... cleanse. You really don't power her up. It's better to give her the powerful vomit and you to take two hits, rather than stay hurt and possibly one shot at any time, as well as spreading the disease and one shot to the rest of your team (who might cleanse anyways). Additionally, many plagues will run abilities to take advantage of not cleansing, like Thanataphobia or stridor.
---
I never understood what tryhard meant
---
Thanks for this
---
This is why I wait until rank reset to start playing new killers, I don't want my feelings hurt by survivors tapping gens I smack and running me around jungle gyms while I cry in baby nurse ;\^;
---
Update: Played a match. This dude is super fun. He’s awful tier wise but he’s so fun. Definitely gonna play more
---
The pigs ability still can be affected by the door if the timer has started already but it would be too op if it still was without the timer starting it had to be changed or only pigs would be being played most of the time. Secondly DS is only a one time use ability like mettle of man so again your being just mad that a survivor is smarter to save it for end game than not too. If a surv uses DS on me in endgame I applaude them because they out played me
---
Some killers have no terror radius, you won’t actually have a 180ish degree camera and it’s helpful in chase when you don’t want to look behind you and want to know if the killer has left you alone.
---
Does autodidact work with self-healing?
---
Learn the dream transition, know when you are invisible and visible and use that to mindgame survivors. I recomend sheep block, it reduces the last frame you are visible before becomeing real from 0.7 seconds to 0.2. 
---
For perks i recomend anti-heal such as sloppy butcher and clourophobia. These are for when you intend to let a survivor break out of dream to get a second mindgame on them; the slower healing will alloe you to get the transition off before they heal fully. In addition make your choice is good to utilise freddys first hit potential and surveillance is better on freddy than most killers due to his ability to abandon a survivor yet still track them.
---
Once you learn the above along with standard mindgames, keeping people in dream and ping ponging between multiple survivors you will realise freddy is an increadibly underated killer. I also recomend running a range addon, freddys default power range is awfull.
---
You can save your matches on PS4 and rewatch them afterwards (by clicking the Share button and saving it). However, to have in-game quality, you either need to share and upload it on Facebook, Youtube or Twitter via PlayStation Factory I believe. I don’t have any of those.
---
That happens to be regardless.
---
I ended the game way too fast, I agree, just didn't know how to combat the gen rush
---
Seeing that flying nea on noob3's stream was pretty funny. I wonder how they managed to do that.
---
Tf is this, you can't do it on pc?
---
I don’t know what killer you think you’re talking about, but all killers vault over windows. 
---
Just look around and you’ll find Ghostface.
---
I don’t know. I don’t own a PC, only a MacBook. But I don’t think it’s possible to transfer saved matches directly to my MacBook without using the affiliated social media platforms. PSN is really weird about it.
---
Basically the reasoning is that you (or your team) were just trying to have a casual game, and someone's sitting on the end of their chair, sweating over the match, and playing like it's a championship
---
 
---
I dont agree with it, but that's what it means
---
Nurse is the easiest one why is it third?
---
I just started play The Legion and this makes me happy
---
Ruin bbq spirit fury enduring
---
All killers can vault...
---
Nurse calling, sloppy butcher, bbq n chili, whispers.
---
Depends. If its activated then yes, if it isn't then they can leave through the gates.
---
Hopefully. I might just get a PS4 Pro myself since the current model has been in use for over 3 years now. And I’ve been wanting a Pro. :) Hopefully it’ll be more silent.
---
I always run sprint burst with my dead hard 😎
---
Reward: 5000 BP
---
I hope you get stoned for that fucking uwu
---
I'm new to the game, is this some form of BM?
---
The moment you see ghostface or you know where he is you can easiliy avoid getting stalked. Even if you cant break him out of his power, his power is pretty much useless then. Except for highwall loops maybe since he got no red stain.
---
Well he is not that bad but not more then a midtierkiller
---
removed salty after game chat.
---
I even got Chase a survivor 180second total
---
With The Nurse
---
I always just put a sqaure piece of black tape on the middle
---
not that impressive honestly lol
---
Pop goes the Weasel works great with him.
---
On the left you can see 5 killers on a cross, 4 of them appear in dbd, but the 5th one, the top one, doesn't. Who is it and what film are they from?
---
He has so many addons
---
I... I um actually basement Bubbad a full gateau lobby.... once..... still hurts the soul
---
If it's a bug it's been that way since endgame was a thing. I do believe you are meant to be able to leave with them on now.
---
Except if you're paying attention you'll notice the sound of a Roomba approaching you. Plus Spine Chill, OoO, Premonition destroy his stealth. Just pay attention and you'll do fine
---
Pinhead from Hellraiser
---
As a killer main I'd say it was a good day at work :D
---
remember he is getting changed so do not get to used to him
---
Yeah that's why i was so confused. I thought there was a bug i didnt see at first but nah
---
Oh my goddddd!
---
I know and it kinda makes me sad. I hope he gets better but I worry he won’t be as fun.
---
Sorry, I got it wrong, and I agree with u
---
If used. Does it work like iron will or like prove thyself? and what about upgrading?
---
Just use your eyes and have at least a double digit iq. Youll find him.
---
I'm sad because they brought 2 cakes. 
---
As a killer, whenever we have 2+ I usually let them farm as much as possible, even if it would've been easy to end the game earlier. Cake spawn % is really low. I also get very salty when I bring a cake and the survivors outskill me and don't let me farm.
---
It's not cheating or bannable, but you're a bitch if you use one
---
I don't know why, but I don't really like farming.
---
Nah
---
Just had a match like that. So great
---
Not at all.
---
You cant just run from any of the killers, they have varying movement speeds but they are all slightly faster than survivors. And ghostface like every other killer becomes alot easier to deal with once you understand how you counter him. Similar to the pig, the shape, and the wraith you have to be aware if your surroundings or you will take a hit/be downed. Just remember that just because you dont hear the heartbeat doesnt mean your safe, always be looking around. You should be doing this regardless since knowing where the killer is can mean the difference between winding up in a chase without a reliable loop nearby, or going down in 15 seconds out in the open. Looking at ghostface will break his stealth and if hes very close to full stalk it may be better to let him get a hit in in you so his progress on you returns to zero. 
---
My guess is if they do nerf him they will probably just make his stalk progress decay over time since theoretically he can just stalk all 4 players to 99% then find, stalk, and slug/hook everyone instantly
---
Agree with everything here, except self care. It encourages bad habits and wastes time.
---
This is screen saver worthy. (Im not gunna take that without perms buddy).
---
Oh man. I only play as Killers because I'm too anxious exactly of this.
---
&gt; doctor
---
&gt; stealth
---
wut
---
How to counter the plague? As far as i can tell the best way is just staying out of chases. I understand ger ability is to counter loops but for me nurse and huntress are far more manageable then the unending vomit downing me in 30 seconds
---
You can literally drop every pallet early and still have enough to run a killer for 5 gens. But OMG you're always in the killers TR so gotta play immersed
---
I hear ya, I don't have the heart for survivor most of the time and I can't survive chases for shit so I only play it if killer queues are awful. But fair warning: I've seen survivors do that exact same thing to killers. People in this game can be super toxic.
---
And then they report you for camping
---
Calm spirit is good until the doc realizes the points show when they shocked you 😭
---
i taped a little piece of paper to my screen tbh
---
Well you have to hit people to use it and hitting people is pretty toxic if you ask me. 
---
Nah for real though it can be annoying to deal with, but of course its not toxic to use a perk the way it was intended to be used lol.
---
I actually don't mind this from the other team. We're not playing together, so a valid tactic is to tilt your opposition into playing bad. I come from Dota 2 where it is a normal thing (community is toxic there too). 
---
I immediately close chat after each game, regardless of how well I did, so that also works.
---
Whenever NOED pops I know I fucked up. Not the killer. There are times where I have seen a dull totem and thought I’ll cleanse it later before having to run then forgetting where it was. Never shitting on the killer for using it. My friend and I once got fucked over by NOED and only one of us escaped. After that every match we played we manhunted totems just in case. It’s a free 600 points that’s a win win situation as long as you don’t get caught cleansing one.
---
You can leave with them on IF it was put on the survivor after the last gen. If a gen was popped after the trap was placed and the traps timer is activated then they should still have to take it off before leaving or get hatch.
---
Scott and Jen are together??? That's amazing they're like a supremely wholesome couple
---
"A player has disconnected while loading."
---
Survivors that sit on sprint burst. The amount of times I've went to struggle first hook because they've walked or crouched over slowly to save their precious sprint burst or they've sandbagged at a loop because again they are slowly walking around it.
---
Healthy survivors who hide out of the way when they could try and take a hit or something.
---
Survivors who play fully immersed.
---
Survivors that throw unnecessary pallets.
---
Feelsbadman. No worries dude! Just had someone be mad at me for securing a kill on Haddonfield. 
---
Although, ended up coming into my chat after and apologizing which was pretty cool. Don’t see a lot of that these days. Internet apologies less than two minutes after saying quite a few silly and mean things.
---
I guess some people give us hope and others are frustrating. Have a good night and hope you have fun.

---
During the chase, you have to take distance on her, like you do with huntress. It is quite manageable because she slows down when she's charging her vomit. In general with unloopable killers  look for tall loops where she can't puke on you really easily.
---
killer when suddenly notifications start pooping up all over the map: "What the fuck is going on in here on this day?"
---
Why’s there 5
---
Still a shitty and boring way to play
---
N o  f u n  a l l o w e d

i don't know but i have 12 of those. so i brag to people i play with so they knew i literally have no life

Spectator glitch
---
Lags has nothing to do with BHVR
---
:O that’s amazing
---
meg, jake, dwight, bill? can you count
---
It’s just saying we’re squaring up and sticking together
---
this would be cool. for the last survivor the killer cant touch you for a certain amount of time while in the white circle
---
Lol
---
They could have saved the money from licensed DLCs to start work on dedicated servers sooner so we could have had them in the game already..
---
Nobody has been banned for it, they even stated they wouldn't actively ban people for that
---
flair should be shitpost
---
50% holy shit lol
---
Nah, it would actuslly be an interesting mechanic that fits thematically and can provide uses for flashlights for people who can't save well.
---
Run to a loop and throw down the pallet when she is phasing towards you so she will be forced to cover a longer distance to get to the other side of the pallet. However this tactic doesn't always work because strong spirit don't have any counter during a chase. It's kinda like range addons nurse: no counter..
---
yeah thats my thinking, couple games though where they walked out.
---
Detrimental, even. If I'm breaking the pallet with brutal strength and they are there butt slapping, I'll catch them before the next loop. 
---
Conversely, a player t-bagging and flashlight clicking at you near an infinite  is not working on a gen, so ignore him and get one of his friends who have toolboxes, you can get them later. And revenge is best served cold.
---
Ha, that's totally me as killer.  
---
Everytime I kill all of them, I am just waiting for that one "Camper!" or "Tunneler!" after they played horribly, to just tell them how bad they performed.
---
Sadly, due to game improvements, her hatchets are no longer the size of logs.
---
"Major change" you mean going into the code and literally adding a few numbers? I think you think they're more retarded than I do lmao.
---
I want to do that now. Please explain how to do that with flashlights
---
fuckkk, that shits so hard to hit on console. when was this implemented
---
Idk. It was mostly a joke, but the devs are making things more reliable tho.
---
You must be proud...
---
it just seems like so much harder to hit them pepehands

---
Lol. I prefer HybridPanda.
---
Lol monte and noob3 also iamcow I'll check hybridpanda
---
I donno. I just think if they keep trying to balance the game for red ranks, it's just going to fuck things for lower ranks and that will discourage people from picking up the game. I'll never be red ranks. I dont have the time to get good enough. I sit in green ranks, maybe purple if I have extra time to play that month so i find a lot of the changes to be annoying. I adapt to something and next update i have to adapt again. It's just rinse and repeat.
---
Maybe it’s just my internet tonight?
---
So what happens when the timer at the top runs out?  Sorry that question makes me look like a noob
---
Yeah, you should ideally be getting 1-2 hooks per generator basically since there are 12 hook stages per match and the game's direction is more towards 2 K 2 E. Your worry about gens being done too quickly is understandable, but without any gen slowing perks on a weaker killer, it's extremely hard to be able to apply pressure. Ruin is a staple and strong perk, but it's also a gamble and a lot of times ends up not doing much, either from being found early or when you finally get survivors that just power through the skill checks.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel can actually be better at slowing down gens than Ruin. If you just wanna level to unlock Ruin, you're not gonna have fun with Lisa. Hag is my main, but she takes a lot of map knowledge and tile memory to play well. But she has an immense amount of snowball potential and she's the 2nd strongest in cutting off loops.
---
What would be the point then? Why wouldn’t you just help them normally?
---
I love it!😍❤
---
no wtf
---
They are working on that stuff as well though so this shit post is indeed pretty shit
---
Like I said in another comment I see this more as a change to help less skilled players. Can't hit ruin? Flash the friend who can. Just adds an extra use to an item that feels slightly lacking.
---
Wow you looped?  So bm man.  Don't you know you're supposed to run in a straight line without looking behind you?  So inconsiderate.
---
Unironic opinion, as shitposty as it may sound:
---
Claudette needs a skin nerf, she’s far too black, especially with bloody cosmetics
---
&gt; I just think if they keep trying to balance the game for red ranks, it's just going to fuck things for lower ranks and that will discourage people from picking up the game. 
---
I agree with that and that's a big issue.  
---
But the alternative (or what we are having right now) is them balancing the game arround lower ranks, which just fucks killers.
---
But like I said, in recent updates they seemed to have started to nerf survivors.   
---
There has to be a middle ground, and it's been survivor sided for tooooo long.  
---
I don't want them to make killers OP and survivors suck now.  
---
But I don't want to feel like I'll lose (As killer) if I pick Wraith or Freddy on red ranks, unless my opponents DC or play like they are on the phone while playing.  
---
I don't want to feel like it's going to be an easy win whenever I don't face Spirit/Nurse on higher ranks.  
---
It's just sad.  
---
I want this game to be scary.  
---
I want survivors to feel pressured. But they have been the 'relaxing' power role.  
---
If the game starts a survivor is running towards you because he damn well knows that he'll kite you arround on this certain map for ages while his SWFs will do the progress ... something is wrong with the balance.
---
And everytime I see this and then I go to the forum and people advocate for more killer nerfs ... I think they never touched killer on higher ranks before.
---
That moment when you start hearing chainsaw everywhere
---
(Editing fucks my text up, so I just put a response here)  
---
Atleast with low ranked survivors they can improve and overcome their struggle against low ranked killers.  
---
On higher ranks with most killers it often feels like you did the best you could, and still lost.
---
As if a 10/10 Freddy would allways lose against 10/10 survivors there.
---
Inb4 doing gens is toxic
---
Your right nurse and spirit is easy.
---
Hopefully none of them gets Left 4 Dead
---
Game needs to be balanced before you make that conclusion. Which it never will.
---
&gt; It just gives us survivors a harder time to survive haha
---
Lmao thats funny.
---
Ghostface isn't OP, and killers not being able to make faults would be so ridiculously bad and make survivors just straight uncatchable on several maps
---
This is The Observer. He’s always been there in every match, always watching. Now he’s making his presence known.
---
They really need to just get rid of that shit and balance it some other way. Survivors either snipe me out of it constantly or can’t do shit when I’m 5 feet away from them, it’s not fair for either side rn.
---
I noticed that too when I was standing on a hill on the wraiths tile set. I can clearly see multiple people running around over by a gen but the game makes me get closer to the point where now they notice me and hide from my stalk...
---
You better have bagged him back
---
Yeah that’s exactly what’s going on for me too.
---
I refuse to play with people over bullying new people
---
I farmed with a Nurse once, it was probably the most boring 20 minutes I've had on the game. And that's saying a lot considering I'm a Claudette main (though I guess that's just because I wanted self care for everyone else).
---
Watching noob, monto, and puppers play together is a treat
---
Lol that shit would be so silly.  Could you imagine looping the Asylum windows against a killer that couldn't vault?  Hello literal infinte.  Sometimes with these suggestions you wonder if the person writing it has ever played the game.
---
Wait, huntress is transgender?
---
what are prayer beads?
---
i see... thanks!
---
Sadly no, you'll have to buy all the dlcs and start all over again
---
I see your on PS4. If you press the share button you can save your clip and edit in the gallery app, you can then upload it to a USB and to a computer for a better quality video, may already know this, and if you did you can ignore this message.
---
I learned her and was good with her. but her hit box just seems so different rn
---
It really kills the joy ngl, even if you try to explain yourself they just go on insulting you
---
If this game never got licensed DLC, it wouldn't have lasted 1 year. Check Steam Charts; the playerbase shot up after the release of the Halloween DLC.
---
Adding Ghostface likely atrracted many people to the game. Checking Steam Charts, the average concurrent players in March (Plague release) was 16.4k, whereas in June (Ghostface) was 21.5k. That said, there was a double bloodpoint event.
---
Yup
---
No point, there are plenty of tutorial videos on Youtube
---
Actually, you can pip with a Mori. Depends on how the rest of the match goes.
---
That said, I can't stand moris. There's no counter to them.
---
EGC is to prevent survivors from over extending the game, timer used to be 3 minutes by that was still too long, the 2 minute timer gives more than enough time for the survivor to escape if they don’t get cocky.
---
Honestly Hag is one of the easiest to begin with since you're not really chasing but planting your traps strategically. All you have to do the is teleport and M1, ofc you have to have some knowledge of the game tho
---
Survivor being carried: Yeah I know
---
As a killer main myself, looping is not toxic at all.
---
Damn, Dwight is dummy thicc.
---
Afaik, you can't save DS anymore. If you let the skillcheck pass, it counts as a fail and you lose the perk.
---
So the reason I'm getting DS'ed at endgame is because I refused to tunnel early on. In other words, DS may well encourage the very thing it's designed to discourage.
---
it wasn't JUST this clip i was just being comedic lol
---
Can i get Banned for using Colored Perks,Items and Portraits?
---
Omg that's funny.
---
I was trying to level up nurse for her perks and basically got like 4 kills throughout the entire time. That wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the amount of teabagging and toxicity that went with it. I'm never touching nurse again.
---
Don't know why you are getting downvoted here, failing to protect gens is failing an objective as killer.
---
It may of been a friend teaching there friend to play the game and said he's coaching like helping. 
---
I for sure wouldn't hire a coach haha.
---
Or it isn't even there and you wasted time you could have used working gens.
---
Sometimes it doesn't work though. If that happens, sprint to the other gate
---
A) You don't have to work for it like Devour, B) It rewards you for failing to protect your generators.

I didn't think people 'coached' for a game like Dead by Daylight. It isn't like some FPS or anything.
---
Oh okay well that’s good to know if it happens again. Is this a bug from the recent update or has it always been around and just kinda rare?

I can't stop laughing at the trapper haha. This is amazing.
---
Their audio is bugged but in general both the males have the same voice and both the females do too.
---
Sounds like some high rank bitching
---
That’s actually impressive! You’re talented :)
---
I wish we had had harder rituals that gave better rewards
---
I don't camp toxic people because that would just validate them and show them that I'm actually mad. I treat them the same as everyone else.
---
My guess would be it changed when Ghost Face released. So I assume Myers now has a shorter Stalk range to match Ghost Face.
---
It's an image the Devs made to showcase the Left 4 Dead crossover content.

I love what you did to one of my favourite memes. Top quality.

---
DbD Comp: https://discord.gg/WaZec27 . You can also find most other team captains here
---
Funnily enough her cosmetics recently got a nerf.
---
when im getting unhooked,i know that killer will be over my ass to mori me. so i hide in the locker to force the killer to pick me up and use my ds. work every time
---
in this situation, gentapping is better, as it works at 70% speed, so...  
---
two people, so you work at 70%\*(100%-10%) = 63% speed and they work at either 90 or 100 depending on if you're currently on a gen, so it's 95+63 = 158%
---
but there are gens that can't be repaired by multiple people, that would be where this change **Shines**
---
Trapper &gt; Omega Blink Nurse 😝😝😝.

If the gate is open then yeah, you should be good

It’s just the toxic survivor Mains being delusional, ignore them...

---
Its almost like your only options are staying at the pallet or vaulting it
---
I can relate to this. I have a fool me once, but don’t fool me twice policy. If a guy acts toxic and I catch him once i nod him on hook and hit him, but don’t camp him. If he does it again, I make it my mission to give him a taste of his own medicine.

the after-lobby offering screen shows regular icons, as you can't edit those
---
Thank god
---
Fookin flying Nea's.
---
Yeah we ran past the usual exit line and it wouldn’t let us leave. I’m fairly new to the game though so that’s good to know about the Blood Warden Perk
---
She has only 110% movement speed so that's quite difficult for new killers especially when survs know what they're doing.
---
Posted it in another reply.
---
I thought about it, and just wasmt worth it. He's just a salty survivor. I will not I him next time and post it :)
---
Which is why you walk through if you anticipate them being good
---
even though it isn’t a reportable offense
---
You’ve got more control than me, I make it personal to hook and tbag survivors like that
---
Honestly whats the point in piping other than making the game boring as shit, for survivors, you just end up facing billies and nurses all the time for killers you only get swf with meta perks...
---
Not a Freddy player but surely Sloppy is bad because it gives them a longer time in a chase to get a self-care skill check to wake up?
---
Imagine being mad about getting downvoted. Seems like you're the toxic one, bud.
---
this is not r/Steam
---
And If you want dlc, you have to buy them
---
Nope billy is the most balanced killer in this game and if he’s nerfed this game will lose a lot of players quick
---
Yup this happened as I was my boy Billy, absolutely terrible seeing the gens slowly get fixed as the other 3 performed some sort of t bagging ritual
---
Not at all actually. I have plenty to lose plus I can only lose 100 per post. So that is 200 total between that and this so keep them coming.
---
To be honest I really just feel like walking on a beach, catching fish and bugs in my cute little town. Brings back memories and the music just soothes the soul.
---
Because hitting a survivor who already vaulted through a window and started walking from a 90 degree angle is fair and balanced.
---
The only problem with billy is the insta-saw, the power itself isn’t the problem.
---
oh wow... 
---
one more question, can the spirit see blood on the floor while phasing?
---
This is you before EGC right? Because this doesn't happen anymore.
---
Just break the pallet CJ!
---
Sometime i make it look like Im farming, but murder them all when their guard is down
---
Don’t vault in front of billy or fake it it’s not hard to do. Do not come here asking if we can nerf the most balanced killer in this game.
---
literally me like 30 minutes ago
---
Er you can’t cheat on current consoles (yet).
---
Salty bois gonna salt.
---
oMg kiLlErS arE sUpPoSeD tO lEt mE OuT oR giVe mE haTch
---
What about perks?
---
If ghostface doesnt tbag my downed body, I get pissed. That shit is hilarious
---
I feel bad seeing an obviously new killer get completely fucked. Or someone doing adept nurse who doesn't play nurse. Keep at it.
---
Lol when you exposed him he turned like wtf?
---
Those are the rules, you must follow them!
---
Pretty much. I play both sides and they both be just as toxic as one another.
---
Absolutely, don’t take what I say as killer bias, they’re both toxic as hell
---
“Be polite”
---
*bang*
---
“Be efficient”
---
“Have a plan to kill everyone you meet”
---
Who argue about perk builds from random players have lost more then just the control over their live
---
I doubt it, just based on how much of the game relies on the interactions between a single killer and survivor. When the two killer glitch was live and the killers actually tried, it was tremendously unfun for the survivors. Vaults, pallets and loops just didn't matter, because the two killers just approach from either side and would always hit.
---
Killers shouldn't allowed to vault lmao
---
Ironworks of Misery would live up to its name.
---
This is why I don’t do solos anymore.
---
People somehow find it fun to sit on gens and hide all game unless its stacking me infront of the killer.
---
I'm console , sorry .
---
No guaranteed difference in skill between 20 and 1. Only playtime. Pipping is easy as fuck.
---
Quit being a *dumb* cunt
---
What game is it cuz I'm interested
---
Im pretty sure its feng but she looks kinda mad
---
Lulaby is good on any platform in my opinion .
---
Trash talking is the funnest part of gaming. You either get better or give up and play something else.
---
Old School Runescape, heres a link tho their site: [https://oldschool.runescape.com/](https://oldschool.runescape.com/) 
---
Games quite fun, movement is a little annoying but i should get used to it soon. Quest are great, there are almost no "go kill X amount of thing" quests, they all have actually plots.
---
Frequent poster, fairly obsessive about Pig. Was the one who posted the "experiment" he did to find the percentages of key chances from boxes that didn't actually include any proof, and had really suspicious numbers. McLean talked about how it was bullshit on stream.
---
So if you're 50 meters away from a killer with 2 pallets, or 30 meters away with 3 pallets and a window, which one makes you more safe?
---
Recently, I started playing with some douchy name, so I don't feel as bad when I make 'a play'
---
It seems you really care about your precious karma
---
Have you tried... doing totems?
---
So you just have to put your fav dlc on your no1 wishlist and help your team( I'm in Corgi lol) to win your race or ebter top 3 and if you're lucky you'll get it .
---
Calm dude
---
So true.
---
Recently I played my first game with Ghostface and got stomped by toxic survivors with terrible attitude in game and chat. Next group of survivors were forced to play against my main killer with red mori and I still have no desire to play Ghostface again.
---
HakunaMatata
---
I play a really weird game of nurse, where I just try to enjoy myself so I goof around and stuff, but if I see a hoe being toxic they’re gonna get abused, if anyone knows bricky,s tick tick game it’s that but they never win &lt;3
---
Could she walk alreasy or did you spaqn next to each other
---
English much? I clearly do not.
---
Killers are always allowed to move sooner than Survivors
---
She walked over to me and you can probably guess what happened next
---
I also want to know the secrets
---
(Facepum) This is common sense. When you eat to many pallets... you become the pallet
---
Oh no
---
Is this a swf meme that i'm too ballsy to understand ?
---
I'm sorry for you too.
---
I think it got nerf or smt because it is not the same since GF arrived .
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Except it doesn't. It literally makes no difference if you were to heal yourself with self care or for someone else to heal you. If I'm self caring, that means my team mates can be on gens, get chased etc... If someone heals you, that's one less person doing all those things.
---
This is hilarious
---
Man i hate the people who claim spirits hard, i know all you guys do is bump into me then lunge
---
Yeha fucktard English isn't my first language
---
noed has a higher chance of doing something that isnt getting destroyed in 30 seconds
---
Lmfao oh look another salty survivor XD I apply plenty of map pressure and no they are not wasted perk slots helps slow the game down even more combined with my map pressure. Learn to play against it noob.

It gives way too many false positives to be worth using a slot for, plus it has a substantial cooldown. If it only alerted you when you were looking at hex totems it might be worth a slot. Emphasis on might.

But also, people who say hex perks are overpowered are fucking dinguses.

Also on a slightly unrelated note, Ghostfaces bloody mask left side looks untextured making it extremely irritating looking at it and most Dwight heads clip when worn with the bloody shirt  (I  agree with the post Vigo Dwight is sexiest dwight)

Stomping in a Claudettes head as clown so much they just went afk then I mori'ed her

Condolences
---
Hooked someone in the basement, sat on the stairs and went to make a sandwich. 
---
He humped the Torment Creek main building so I can't feel bad about it :D
---
Yea as a killer main I never try to tunnel but the rescuer rarely protects the person who escaped the hook, so I'll go for who I see first
---
lol no?
---
Most people here are probably those P3 Urban Evasion Claudettes who hate getting chased (because they can't hold a chase), so while you are 100% correct you will be told to fuck off.
---
That was my first thought as well, but I think it's more in order of how specific the requirement is rather than the difficulty.
---
I thought it's about Ace not playing Ace
---
I would rather them make it so you wiggle a bit faster. Cause if you play killer a lot you know where hooks spawn. Also you get notified when the survivor has Boil Over so you would know if the auras are hidden.
---
Yeah and keeping track of 4 survivors and hooking them 3 times each is a lot harder than holding down a button and occasionally doing a skill check
---
But it ended in a tie
---
I completely disagree, the worst feeling I've felt while playing killer is just mild frustration at not being able to find survivors. Even if I completely whiff and get a 0k, it's not really particularly frustrating or unenjoyable for me unless the survivors do something like teabag me at the exit gates. I'm in the position of power as the killer, I can fuck around all I want and it doesn't really matter. As a survivor, playing against a legion, a killer with noed, or someone who is intent on mori-ing everyone is incredibly frustrating because I feel like I'm basically powerless to prevent it. When I'm in a chase running from a killer, I'm obliged to the other survs in the game to run the killer for as long as I can, whereas when I'm chasing a survivor, I don't feel obliged to anyone, so even if I do get run around for a long time, or even if I lose the surv, it doesn't really matter.
---
Shit, Asylum? Half the matches on any map would be like "hey killer, watch me hold you hostage at this T L wall."
---
Survivor main here can't agree more that survivor is easier hen killer ,  just got to purple rank first time as killer
---
"Map RNG" - If people are complaing about that feature, after 3 years, I think they don't know what game they've been playing all along.
---
i had a dally for saves on ash, and my nickname was ace long before dbd
---
you often play against trappers who don't have pinks addons ?
---
I got Ruin at level 2 once.  It happens sometimes.  Then you'll spend 30 levels getting shit like Hangman's Trick.
---
lullaby is good but her other perks are pretty bad
---
Yup hence not swinging through it
---
That right there is why you're the best, boss
---
Try to main nurse (pc) and YOU will be the bully
---
True but killing some fuckers always makes me feel better. Unless I meet some SWF group that's making me question my life choices. Still better than what I've been getting as a survivor lately. Got some facecampers and absolutely shitty teammates who were deliberately leading the killer TO ME and only me for the whole match. Another Claudette in another match kept bloody farming me off the hook EVEN THOUGH THE KILLER WAS RIGHT THERE. I've never depiped so fast in my life. All because Claudettes kept doing this shit
---
You need Optometrist, stat!
---
&gt; where everyone body blocks hooks and Gen rush 
---
These two things are mutually exclusive. You either genrushing or bodyblocking.
---
W-what is that Meg doing?
---
Ok , ok , you took this point xd
---
In these times and in this game, everything will be seen as toxic by everybody, doesn't matter if you are a killer or a survivor
---
The only way it works, anyway.
---
It started off with gen rushing, finally got the Adam who was t bagging me the hardest after all the gens were done, then once I went to hook em they all body blocked the hook.
---
I finally hit rank 7 on console, and I was like “this is nutty, I figured the matches would be insane” most matches you have the two survivors being 4heads the other two making me work for the hooks. Not that way anymore getting matched with rank 2’s and so forth. I just have to get better as a killer, I understand that it’s a me sucking thing. 15 good matches where no one escapes v 1 toxic SWF isn’t gonna change my mindset that the game is balanced..relatively speaking.
---
Sure but if they drop it and you're just about starting the release of your swing animation, you can smack them as they're tossing the pallet down
---
Most of the pallets I reach have that exchange happen- good players often just take the hit without even attempting to drop the pallet simply because they don't wanna waste it and get hit anyway, may as well keep the pallet
---
I am currently rank 3 survivor rank 1 killer. I have no secrets I just play with a friend and coordinate via discord, for the rest I do everything: do gens, saving teammates, and rarely get tunneled but that's not a huge problem because now you get lightbringer points if your teammates do gens when you are chased by the killer.
---
Sure it's more handy
---
Self Care is offensively slow and a soft throw at high ranks.
---
i had already used the re roll on trapper daily
---
Hiding as a Claudette is pretty easy. Lately I've been mostly playing Feng and you can still hide pretty well with the black hair but I'm used to hiding and not running when a killer is near and well let's just say the cosmetics I have on now are...not very good at that.
---
I have Feng dressed in what I call a Sallyface cosplay which includes the purple-blue hair with facemask and, uh, I have sort of forgotten that I have it on and tried to hide in plain sight...in the grass...you can guess how that went for me.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Yeah, playing as killer is stressful, but extremely satisfying
---
When is Freddy’s rework coming out?
---
NOED I see as a mark of weakness. Like training wheels on a bike or taking steroids in sports.
---
When you rely on any kind of toxic crutch perk survivor or killer, which NOED 100% is, then when the perk gets nerfed you basically become neutered and inept.
---
Look at pre nerf Decisive, pre nerf MoM, pre nerf Enduring..etc.. All overpowered perks which when nerfed made tons of people inept until they learned to play without it.
---
The same logic applies to someone who is a killer who face camps. You aren’t going to learn to play the game well if you stand there and face camp each person until death.
---
Just like good nurses will tell you...Remember it’s not about kills, winning or losing at first, it’s about first learning your character (or perks) well, trying new things then when you feel confident go for it!
---
————
---
(Example: Imagine you somehow had a glitch where the game gave you 999 Ebony moris your first killer match. Well you probably would win most of your matches but you’d be ass at the game. Now when you run out of those moris and are now rank 5 and aren’t used to hooking each player 3 times you’re gonna be destroyed every match.)
---
Killer main with P3: Pig, Ghost, Trapper, Plague, Huntress, Freddy, Leather Face. Killer rank 3. 
---
Survivor rank 8.
---
Devotion 11.
---
Matchmaking too. It's pretty fucked when I'm trying to learn how to play killer, am rank 19, and get a bunch of rank 10 survivors. You know, unless you're in the really high ranks, the game just churns completely random ranks at you, it's really annoying
---
I'm sorry man. I know these matches well. :-(  
---
It helps when you're playing Leatherface. Not only for his BBQ perk which gives you increased bloodpoints, but when the match goes sideways but you manage to hook that one toxic player, you can usually facecamp them to death with your chainsaw. Soothes the mind.
---
Oh please, you can loop a Michael for his entire duration of EW3
---
Ash no, do not read from the Necronomicon to summon dead memes!! They aren't worth the apocalypse!
---
You don't need to be full health all the time. Any time spent looking for teammates or self caring can be used to do a gen. Be comfortable being injured, and you'll get thru games so much faster.
---
This. THIS is what DBD should be about! Clever use of non-meta perks. Clever plays instead of loopyloop around the pallets. Awesome and fun for both killer and survivor. Great play! :-)
---
Haha I just finished watching your mad grit video today. Its funny how it just wasn't working til they all messed up at the end
---
I'm gonna be honest, I kinda wish they just removed the speed boost from adrenaline. That's the only thing that makes it annoying. It already buys so much time with the free health state against most killers (assuming no NOED). Giving them a speed boost just makes exit gates go by that much quicker, whether they decide to use it for another chase or to run to the gate.
---
Fuck, remove the speed boost and remove/reduce the exhausted effect to compensate and I'd be fine.
---
What's [REDACTED]?
---
Why dont you just make your own memes and stop stealing other peoples work.
---
You alright dude?
---
For some reason the killers that disconnect against me are always these kind
---
Michael and Legion get looped even on normal maps, please don't send them there. 
---
Especially Michael, you can loop him for the entire duration of his EW3 on Blood Lodge and his stealth is worthless there, because that is literally the most open map in the game.
---
no
---
Read the rules dude :D
---
Exactly, slugging is a game mechanic and people saying that you're not supposed to do it don't understand how to play.
---
Yes, but that applies whether you have self care or not. I'm not talking about *when* you should heal, I'm talking about *how*. So what's your point?
---
It’s too easy when you learn how to control blinks
---
If you're hanging around other survivors when the gates are powered and not doing something altrustic, then what ARE you doing exactly?
---
mori's are a more reliable way to accrue kills than noed AND don't eat a perk slot.
---
and winning chases and not being hooked is one of the survivors objectives, so getting hit noed or not is a survivor failing their objective.
---
I don’t use Twitter, Facebook or YouTube. If you tell me how to transfer my recordings directly to my MacBook, I won’t be a classic console person.
---
I didn’t know this actually. Thank you, next time I’ll do that. Appreciate the advice.
---
but but but! this one time a **TOXIC** killer main looked at me after hooking me so they're literal scum.
---
Lol, I feel this. I switch off between survivor and killer so I’m constantly flip-flopping about which side has to deal with more bullshit. I think this is a sign that I have room for improvement on both. :)
---
I have gone for the direct from the psn store. I also belive you don't get the bonus skins if you buy in game with cells to get each character separate. I love the Saw Chapter and Pig is great. Other great ones for beginners are Halloween, Shattered Bloodlines (Spirit), and the Leather face. Myers is just fun to play as, Spirit is top tier on console, and leather face is fun but also gives you access to the best perk in the game BBQ and Chilli. 
---
Terminology list is actually in the description of the post. I'd link but am on mobile right now. The ones you mentioned though are; 
---
SWF-Survive with Friends, it refers to a group of survivors playing together as a group. Often using a voice chat system to communicate with each other.
---
Tunneling - if when the killer ruthlessly pursues a single survivor. A somewhat loose term but most players see it as when the killer goes after one survivor over any other. If they have the chance for multiple survivors they will pick the same one until they are dead. For example a killer that comes across 3 survivors two are injured and one at full health that was hooked already once not too long ago. The healthy survivor sprint bursts away while one injured survivor dead hards into a tree and the other trys to hide behind a barrel. If the killer go for the healthy survivor that could be seen as tunneling. Dying light is a perk that sort of promotes this play
---
Console peasant, definitely want to try and main her on this platform though!
---
&gt; "eat shit"
---
And fall off your horse
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/C49wygOeZ5I) may answer your first two questions, and there is a list of terminology [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary)
---
Yes, jesus. This is why immersed team mates are so frustrating and so many people hate them. If there are two people on the team on death hook, and two who haven’t been hooked even once, it seems pretty obvious that the fresh meat should make themselves the target. They never do though, they just stay hidden and let their team mates die, and then they die because immersion can only prolong your life for so long.
---
i hope you have a lovely day stranger
---
I use it for destruction, not for defense
---
youd be surprised how many survivors will cleanse it even without ruin.... or after ruin has already been cleansed. points.
---
No. You can still use them.
---
Til the game is over when 5 gens are done.
---
If it was a popular streamer it would be because they are targeted. Your friend however did something sketchy or gave his password away. It wasn’t hacked he logged in on a site that wasn’t affiliated to steam etc , he messed up. The owner of the account is responsible for any action on their account whether it is permitted or not. The amount of people who probably get banned and say “my account was hacked” is probably ridiculous and they won’t unban you because I don’t believe you so why would they? 
---
Next time have two factor Authentication with a much harder password and don’t log into any sites that seem sketch.
---
How did you mod your perks to look like that?
---
A small price to pay for thicknes
---
Your mistake, you lost the account forever

---
Someone buy this kid an education.
---
I know I know, but you are sweating by delaying the game to get 4K. It is boring.
---
I just got the game a couple weeks ago and I agree.  Gens popping before you even find the first survivor is stressful enough but then you have the teabagging, hook diving, body blocking, and flashlight clicking constantly.  I've been steamrolled by Survivors to the point I just afk while they open the gates to go get a cup of coffee and let the game finish only to come back and find they have all been waiting at the gate with it 99% opened for 10 or even 20 minutes just to teabag and flashlight me when I came back to investigate wtf was taking so long.    
---
It really sucks that its hard to strike a balance between killers/survivors, but not I at least understand why a lot of killers run NOED and Ruin and play as oppressively as possible.  You can only take so much abuse before you snap.
---
Depending on the map, shes incredibly loop-able with hatchets too lol
---
Do the Gateau cakes expire today?
---
And DONE. I met a trio of kids playing as killer and we got the trophy on the first try. The timing of everyone jumping in the hatch is fairly forgiving.
---
also that the pruple lense and odd bulb suck.
---
not really i main nurse and i get these 4 k's but it took me at least 20h to learn her 
---
i agree with little mindgame options but you dont really need it
---
nurse dosent need mindgames, she needs muscle memory thats why its so hard to play her
---
and she is op only in good hands
---
It's a weird bug. Yesterday game was still in spawning phase and Feng was opening the box while the camera was tilting around me.
---
Do you keep perks on prestige?
---
No you don't keep the ones you had before you prestiged
---
You won't have to find teachables again though if that's what you meant. You have the ability to find all the same perks but prestiging means you lose everything, add ons, perks, offerings.
---
*facepalm*
---
You know it’s actually good to have a little street smart right?
---
Honestly, I’ll never get campers. 
---
I much rather hunt an entire game and get no kills then hook 1 and be happy. 
---
I’ve had 30K bp no kill games and double piped and I had a 4K a few days ago with a depip (devour hope got 5 stacks then I mori the rest).
---
Well, isn't that my point?
---
I'm Nurse main (former) and know how powerful she is.
---
Trapper
---
If you plug a USB stick or an external hard drive into the PS4, you can copy all your clips onto it. They'll be in mp4 format. That's how I get mine to a PC.

---
There's a badge category for evading the killer, so by that logic you failed your objective if the killer stays on one of your teammates the whole game and you just finish 5 gens and leave, right?
---
Genuinely asking, not trying to be rude in any way.
---
Spirit (Shattered Bloodline) and Leatherface
---
I know this so well
---
sounds like someone has never bought and paid for their own internet before. Some places have zero options when it comes to cheap and fast internet. Sometimes you have to choose between the two. Some places fast isnt even an option.
---
Ghostface is really good and fun
---
That's interesting, it always seemed to me the cinematic opening was the same time-wise for killers and survivors. Do the killers spawn in earlier?
---
Ok at the moment sound is hella bugged regarding terror radius so Spine Chill has been taking the place of my Dead Hard. Bond is a great perk. Sprint Burst is debatable and Urban Evasion is probably the most rank 20 perk in the game
---
You can install these easily these by looking at that -&gt;[that](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/4zhfvv/custom_perksurvivor_icons/)

[the one i use](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bh1s04/fearys_galaxy_happy_clowns_combination_pack/)
---
Iirc evading the killer is winning chases, winning chases would also be an objective, since you take longer to die which would stall for your team to safely work gens.
---
Looks like this post struck a little too close to home for a surprising number of players.
---
Pretty sure if he’s got her character P3 level 50, he knows about teachables. xD
---
Screw pallets they are Soooo annoying oh my god right Anna? My entitled survivor voice .
---
Alright, noted to not do that
---
15 games later....
---
This sums up the entitled killer mentality right there. You stomp game after game and then you finally get a challenge and its WHAAAA SURVIVORS OP!!!
---
Meanwhile solos are dealing with constant DC's, moris, ruin nurses, flowchart hillbillys, tunneling spirits, hardcamping LF' and hags etc. 
---
But when a survivor complains its because theyre just salty and need to get gud. e
---
God forbid expecting the killer to play the game in good faith.

I guess you’ve never played impossible skill check doctor on The Game. 🙃 he is bad pretty much everywhere else tho
---
You shattered his fragile ego. So sad. Sounds like he'll be stuck in brown ranks for awhile.
---
But if you spent the whole game evading/being chased, you'd never make progress in the Benevolent and Lightbringer emblems, even if you escape. 
---
I don't think the emblems can be really reliable indicators of whether you win or lose is my main point. So even though NOED activating inherently means no Gatekeeper emblem, that doesn't necessarily mean failure.
---
Thank god. I remember three games back to back without catching a single survivor, simply because they kept running in circles around obstacles. Then according to patch notes, survivors got buffed and killers got nerfed even harder. So I quit
---
Yeah, that's how I've seen it too. That and KYF.
---
The clown
---
Is this sarcasm?
---
Whenever this happens I just send a “:(“
---
The huntress hitboxes are so bad right now that it isn't even fun to play against her anymore... It's always now the same irritation of ''wtf that didnt hit me -.-''
---
Spirit, both her power and her perks. You can give Clown a try, he has 2 great perks as well
---
I wish this would ebbe a thing on console
---
Depends which killer types you like but i recommend legion or spirit and you dont need to pay for a decent killer like nurse is free but ye
---
Camping with gens up is always pretty lame.  I don't care if you had 2 people in there.  I don't camp in that scenario because I'd rather play the game instead of rank 20'ing it up till they die.  More points more fun, better pip.
---
I know they changed it ages ago, but I believe they changed it back as part of the nerf.
---
Lol hold up, so Ghost Face in the Russian language version is what just Гост Фас?
---
Sauce?
---
Apart from she looks like big lez (from the big lez show, I'm not being homophobic I swear)
---
I went back and looked they didn't change the feature of not hitting it
---
If you've never heard of him, Monto on youtube has an entire video series of basement builds utilizing Iron Grasp and Agitation, and most of the time Mad Grit.
---
Like Anton from No Country For Old Men.
---
RIP Claud
---
Thats a risk you gotta take. NOED's existance means the totems are a clear secondary objective. Do you ignore them and risk NOED to do gens asap or do you play it safe, sacrafice some time, and cleanse totems.
---
If Totems are being  treated as an objective than devs need to add a totem counter. Objectives for both sides are tracked, totems are not.
---
Well, im about 5 hours in, and the quest that i actually took this screenshot from was literally a murder mystery. Never fought a enemy, never had to grin for a item, it was just a fun series of puzzel's in a haunted mansion with literally ghost face going around and murdering people, with some fun humor mixed in. And this quest took me 1 hour to complete, with the use of a guide halfway through cause im bad at puzzel's.
---
Damn, not even an attempt to save the Claudette.
---
WhAt ThE fUcK bRo
---
But it doesn't get auto-countered. Survivors have to work and take risks to counter it, and heavens forbid the NUMBERS role have any stress.
---
yes I will do it tomorrow :)
---
The knife and mask are 3D and the background (the window, outside snowy area, blood, etc.) were all either painted or photo bashed to make the overall image. I'll post or link to just the render as proof it is 3D
---
"Just annoying thats why i run it"
---
Sorry if you don't want exposition, but I just want to add that this was designed to prevent survs taking the game hostage by staying at the gate by forcing a time limit, and also builds tension and forces quick decisions (stay calm rushing in EGC is the downfall of many players)
---
Rip Toolbox 
---
Oh yea immersedette too
---
Glad you enjoy it :)
---
Ah right, forgot about that. That... still doesn't exactly refute my point.
---
Wierd way to spell "for survivors failing to cleanse the totems"
---
Thanks I appreciate that :)

That's if they drop it which most of the time they wont.
---
So just replace the whole "Icons" folder with ur perks?
---
lol I have no idea how to animate so I know as a fact you can animate better than me and yeah legion ain't too popular with people but I like em :)
---
If you're confident in your mindgaming, Spirit is second only to Nurse, but with a much easier learning curve.
---
Jesus Christ, when rank 20s put questions. 
---
So you played just 2 games against her and you already claim that she is OP.
---
Learn how to loop her and she won't be a problem for you anymore. Many killers are just jokes when you learn how to loop.
---
Too real
---
I agree! I like the edgy teen look for the group I think it's really cool
---
Yeah but if there are eight players on the map we crush them if both killers focused on one player.  That's why I think if we ever did make a team killer mode we need more survivors to balance it out.  The killers would have to work together and plan accordingly. If they just focus on one player at a time. The remaining survivors would speed rush the generators and win so fast.
---
I think it should come at the end of this month I am not wrong.
---
Has nothing to do with my comment, where I was pointing out that survivors don't have hex type perks to worry about.
---
And I doubt you've played killer with that logic, as many killers CANT pressure them. Spirit, Billy, and Nurse are about it. Everyone else has to walk there normally, and if they want to down someone they have to chase, and during chase you can't do that.
---
This was beautiful
---
Oh hey thanks man
---
My favorite is when they tell me to get cancer and die.
---
I kinda agree lol I’m black myself but her tone is a little ridiculous.
---
Maybe if they just adjusted the colours of the game it’d make her easier to see
---
It's a secondary objective, not a main one, though I do agree.
---
Doubt it'd stop people complaining about it though. They'll just move on to their next excuse. Heavens forbid survivors have some stress occasionally.
---
"See you fuckers in the next game!"- Ash, before leaving his to die
---
Yeah you’re right, If someone’s skin is so dark that people play her just for a stealth advantage then something needs to change.
---
Also I love the 5 Claud mains downvoting me
---
Wait Claudette had Self Care yet it was called useless after it was called meta
---
I mean, useless built, should have made it clearer
---
Dude, I love your galaxy perks. These are great too. 😍
---
..Good for you?
---
I personally like a nice alfredo
---
**Meanwhile, almost every survivor runs perks like Self-care, Spine chill, D Strike, MoM, borrowed time, adrenaline, bond, dead hard, and many other perks every single game**
---
Now, I don’t have anything against these perks except MoM, but I don’t have you should be saying that killers use very specific perks every game when survivors do the same
---
&gt; It slows down the game if survivors choose to shut down that avenue of danger, or doesn’t and potentially greatly punishes them for powering through gens.
---
A perk that greatly punishes survivors for completing their objective and rewards the Killer for failing one of theirs. If you can’t see how that’s poor design idk what to tell you.
---
&gt; It is literally the only reason dull totems are considered more than point piñatas/a complete waste of time.
---
If the only reason to cleanse full totems is to deal with a perk the killer may or may not have than that’s poor design.
---
&gt; It greatly improves the intensity of end-game, and allows powerful end-game builds which can do wonders for Killers generally perceived as ‘weaker’, such as Freddy and Pig.
---
You’re right that it increases endgame intensity but the problem is that the killers have to do absolutely nothing to earn the massive buff they receive.
---
&gt; It means the Killer is playing with 3 perks throughout the game, giving survivors the edge during the early/mid game.
---
Also allows the Killer to waste more time and make more mistakes in the early game knowing they have the safety net of NOED 
---
&gt; It has actual counter play.
---
The only counter play is cleansing dull totems. Considering a majority of survivors solo queue and there’s no totem counter it’s going to be extremely difficult for a single survivor to ensure NOED doesn’t pop
---
Iron Will is your best bet. Maybe Spine Chill, but just in combo with Iron Will, or it won't help you too much.
---
The spirit
---
Honestly pretty scummy of you cause gens were still not completed
---
Congrats my dude!!
---
I don’t have a problem with bugs being fixed, just impatient people complaining things aren’t fixed fast enough. Yes it is annoying, but it happens. Not sure why you feel the need to be so rude, I was merely stating my opinion, same as you.
---
They are looking at where you are.
---
NOED
---
When you aren't caught up with the cool kids
---
thanks uwu
---
I roleplay the survivor I am playing, yes.
---
There is a bug that makes hits not connect if the survivor is using sprint burst or something... Maybe that's it?
---
you i like you
---
Against a SWF team with flashlights and Object of Obsession, yeah, she is useless. 
---
But other than that, she's really good if you know how to play her. 
---
Probably 4th best killer in the game.
---
I don’t have a problem with NOED. I just find it a bit pathetic when people have it on killers that Can one-shot without it
---
It does have to be directly behind them, same for unhooks, if you are roo far or at an angle then you will swing instead.
---
Ahhh this is the type of meme ive been longing for
---
And what was your point exactly? That it isn’t survivor and “gen protector”?
---
1. We don't know, but likely soon.
---
2. No it doesnt.
---
Well get Kate, tap, leatherface..  
---
I mean I'd personally save my shards to get spirit,plague,clown,legion...
---
Or by the freddy dlc and get Quinton and freedy for $4. 
---
 Or by the saw chapter and get pig and tap for $4
---
Leather face if you don’t have bbq &amp; chili unlocked
---
object of obsession
---
thank you very much :)
---
i want my mains cosmetics already!!!!!
---
And do you need to be out of the haunting to grab or can you grab them when invisible?
---
The best map pressure in the game ? Without Dried Cicada on a big map she doesn't have almost any.
---
r/lostredditors
---
Plague
---
I posted the wrong one hold on
---
Literally yes. Nerk_Tarkus said "failing to protect gens is failing an objective as killer."
---
My counter-point was that, no, failing to kill is failing the objective as killer.
---
I almost feel the opposite, but not in the same sense. I enjoy killer so much more than Survivors because no matter what I play the entire time.
---
If I play survivor and I get hooked early, or camped or tunneled hard, I get so frustrated. I could only kill one person in a match and still feel like I had a good game.
---
If I lose as Killer I just messed up, if I lose as Survivor I could have just been unlucky.
---
*starts game as killer, immediately sees 17 noise notifications*

---
I wish dance with me lasted longer
---
After 2 weeks playing as a survivor I got into playing as killer for the first time yesterday and for all the complaints, playing at lower ranks (currently rank 19 killer) is fun! I've only played as Trapper and Pig but I am having a ton of fun, especially with the Pig's ability to jumpscare survivors.
---
This was genuinely funny
---
I need that
---
It doesn't matter if you can't teleport at these traps, and on a big map, you can do that without your best add-ons. If you keep trapping gens and totems, you will get f*cked by Urban Evasion. 
---
You should trap mainly loops and choke points, if you are too predictable with your traps, good survivors will counter you easily.
---
No worries, screen recordings don't bother me, especially when they're action-film quality like that one, hah. It's just for future reference. I don't think uploaded videos can be edited as far as I know, but in case you get any more edge-of-your seat moments in the future, you know what to do!
---
[You just gotta go to Capture Gallery - scroll to the game you want to copy from - press the options button - scroll over to 'copy to usb storage device' -  select your video - scroll to copy - boop the 'okay' button.](https://youtu.be/aHjHAqEvuO8?t=33)
---
It'll create a folder that says PS4 with a folder in it called Share, and a separate folder inside those for screenshots and video clips. 
---
You can use a USB stuck to back up your saves too, I do this because I'm paranoid about losing some of my bigger saves just in case the console breaks and the PSN online storage cloud lets me down.
---
Why
---
I've been playing this game since the beginning, bucko. And what exactly am I supposed to do as, say, The Shape when I found a survivor shortly after the game starts and they loop me around a pallet three times, which as the shape I can't do anything against, throws it down and then runs to the next loop. Suddenly one or two gens pop. 
---
Sure, I could leave him when I see that he can loop but then what? I leave a healthy survivor to do more gens while roaming around randomly, hoping to find another survivor before the gen pops and hoping that that one is worse at looping?
---
Ok but what does healing/unhooking being an emblem category have to do with this discussion in the first place?
---
This is actually amazing. I laughed
---
okay so just to confirm, the spirit can only use her hearing to find survivors when she is phasing, unless she has certain add-ons, right?
---
Amanda is honestly very average in terms of killer strength and you’re only under so much pressure because you’re new and don’t know what you’re doing. Once you learn how to prioritize distractions and extending chases longer than however fast your allies were getting downed, you’ll find out she’s only strong due to rng/tunneling and her RBT are really weak. 
---
Just keep playing.
---
You don’t need to be rude, they’re literally a new player and just frustrated.
---
You're the best Panda love your attitude towards the game we need more people like you in this community
---
It should tho. The new killer should come in September, so in this month the reworked Freddy should be released, at least in PTB.
---
Oh yeah man playing killer at low ranks is hella fun. I've been a red rank killer for over a year and recently left red ranks because it just wasn't fun anymore. Purple/green ranks are a lot less stressful. And u/Dabidoi, you're right. The killer shouldn't have to rely on survivors making mistakes. But this game has come a long way from what it used to be, and killers are more powerful compared to then. 
---
Regardless, the general hierarchy in this game goes:
---
1.) SWF
---
2.) Killer
---
3.) Solo Queue Survivors
---
I need to watch that clip
---
abs?
---
Killer at ranks above 10 feels more like it would in a horror movie because survivors aren't great, example being they never look behind them to read what a killer is going to do. I have de-ranked to around that level before to learn a difficult killer like huntress and you do feel like a god, but once you rank up it gets harder. Red ranks can be a stressful nightmare if you don't play a top tier killer as well, getting their with Freddy was an event in itself lol.
---
It punishes survivors for doing the main objective and ignoring a secondary objective. The uncertainty on whether they have NOED or not does not make it a poor design. And I never have issues finding totems as a solo queue survivor, it’s pretty easy.
---
In that case, Spine Chill and Premonition are very good against Pig and also, learn what looping is.
---
But you shouldn't claim that a killer is OP after just 2 matches.
---
That's assuming they would even ask that, and not type: GG EZ
---
Lol bucko...anyways how have you been playing this long but still can't end a chase efficiently as killer?  I've been playing for years too man.  I've seen this game go from sadistic for killers to quite balanced.  There really isn't much more we could ask for balance wise as killer at this point.  Are you a casual player?  It sounds like despite your length of time played you're still quite unpolished as killer.  There are a number of streamers worth watching to improve your game.  It sounds like you still need help for this to be your mindset.  Go watch some Zubat or something and practice your decision making in chase.
---
True, but it’s not like you are hurting anyone doing it. 
---
Could just be some fun among friends.
---
Obviously you should keep them in range when possible. But even just slowing down survivors by forcing them to crouch is a form of map control. Urban Evasion is uncommon compared to other perks right now. And yeah, being predictable is bad, so don't. For instance on a hook trapping right under the hook when you know someone has a flashlight is a bad idea. Instead you can place traps at choke points leading to the hook, and they will almost certainly trip them because their confidence with the flashlight means their initial approach will likely not be crouching. Then you can get a free hit and start the next chase, while preventing unhook, without camping, so during this you can be checking gens. Like I said, effectively the only killer that can be doing multiple things at once.
---
If you don't understand how powerful hag is, I might suggest trying her out more and trying new tactics. If you're just here to argue, then why are you asking questions? Make a discussion thread instead. But you will find hag is present and powerful even at high rank play.
---
It makes me mad when people complain about “t-bagging”. Imagine getting mad when someone crouches up and down in a game. If anything they are hurting themselves by wasting time at the pallet
---
Thanks mate
---
If you read the top of this thread, it was stated that NOED activating is indicative of failure by the killer.
---
I said argued that while protecting generators from being completed is in the killer's best interest, it's NOT their overall job.
---
They said there's literally an emblem category for protecting generators, implying that means it IS their job.
---
I pointed out that both sides have emblems that can be completely ignored while not inherently meaning a loss (you can never heal, work on a gen, or unhook and still escape), and as such, saying "Since there's an emblem for something, it reflects the player's main job".
---
Then the extremely reasonable conversation screeched to a halt when you pointed out that juking the killer does, in fact, progress the Lightbringer emblem.
---
Nice how you didn't actually answer my question in any way.
---
I don't know if you're joking or not but a combination of perks serving their niche purpose isn't OP.  I do wonder how many things in games have been nerfed because of sarcastic 'OP' lables though haha.
---
An issue that exemplifies this perfectly while only being a minor example is the killer shack. Like, I'm sorry, but it's supposed to be the Killer frigging home, right? Their base of operations? Why is it then that the thing is the safest place on any map aside from some of the not fixed infinites?
---
I think a lot of seasoned players already know this...however WANTING to protect/save your teammate is another story. I feel like a lot of people are tainted by poor sportsmanship and sabotaging teammates, that they don't really care if that injured survivor takes the heat and dies. 
---
But yes, in a magical world, be a distraction if you're able. Be a team player.
---
If your chases are only 20 seconds you aren’t utilizing pallets and structures enough. Using windows to keep creating distance or pallets that are safe/hard to get hit through is what you need to learn to recognize. Sayin you don’t loop leads to just running in a straight line which is not very helpful against anyone tbh. 
---
You don’t even need to camp pallets or anything just find decent areas to mindgame or invest in perks to help Evasion. You’ll get better and see how much more capability you have against average killers like Amanda.
---
I mean I main the weakest killers in game and have played them throughout the red ranks.  No doubt the games are more stressful at red ranks but if you play great you can win with any killer up there.  Been playing Wraith since you had to uncloak to kick a gen or check a locker lol.  Needless to say the game feels infinitely easier now than it ever has over the years.  EGC just made it mindlessly easy to secure the 4K
---
  You don't even have to slug anymore.
---
Sad leejun noise
---
Because they are going out of their way just to make fun of you for no reason. I like to play in a respectful way always. And I expect to be respected :)   It’s not fun when I started playing the game and I was getting matched against survivors who had thousand of hours, and I got punished for actually not dodging them
---
Also unrelated but it ticks me off. Why do I have to turn my Camera back up after putting a Trap down.
---
That’s really unfortunate having players like that.
---
Wh fornicus is kinda just a more boring pin head so not him haha
---
Yeah good for me, no need to be a Jack ass.
---
I will at least agree that NOED not being a teachable makes it far more common place.
---
Frank, Julie, and Susie should wear black eye make up to look equally as cool as Joe when wearing his bandana.
---
The plague is countered by staying calm. By this I mean the plague will likely down you. But if you try to stall her out as long as you can, you buy as much gen time as possible. The plague's main weakness is her lack of mobility, meaning gen rush is a powerful tactic against her. Also, breaking line of sight is the best thing to do during chases. Try to run tight loops next to walls. Some people suggest that against plague, you shouldn't cleanse to not give her the powerful vomit. I disagree. It's better to be healthy, and able to sneak, than to infect the entire team. Also, if a gen is infected, do a different one if  you can easily switch. No reason to get infected when not needed. Same during a chase, try to go to loops that she hasn't puked on, if she pukes on it, use that time to switch loops again, if possible.
---
In short, plague will eventually catch you. Buy time for gens, heal up to get ready for next chase.
---
Yeah the one time I used Small Game it was against a Hag and I couldn't stand the fucking perk going "DING DING DING DING DING" every 15 seconds.
---
Spine Chill is good vs most killers, yes. Premonition is okay but the cooldown of the ability hinders it from being more effective plus Premoniton can give false information if you’re actually being walked up on or if you’re just in the path of the killer chasing someone else. While the OP is still learning, being a bit more constructive instead of saying “learn to loop” and berating them for being frustrated would be helpful. I mean, this is the no stupid questions thread after all.
---
all we had to do was hook the damn survivor CJ - Big Entity
---
So you think crouching up and down in a video game is making fun of you. I’d love to see you in a MW2 or a BO2 game chat
---
I can't find a claudette in that picture :/
---
If that claudette was immersed she deserved that death for wearing a bright white jacket
---
Get a load of this guy lmao
---
Because it's based on a novice level of play man.  Survivors are far from overpowered at this point.  They lost all their cheese mechanics and broken perks.  You definitely need to work on your mindgames because you should not be getting ran that hard.  Not every pallet is safe you try to make the point of them being fortresses.  The makings of any good killer is knowing when to abandon a chase too.  It sounds like you overcommit.  You need to pressure the gens relentlessly too.  If you overcommit to chases of course you're gonna get rushed by the survivors you haven't bothered to disrupt.  This entire post just reaks of inexperience.  Sincerely I recommend watching the leading streamers play.  You might learn something.
---
Why say lot word
---
Credit to artist?
---
To be fair, if one of them was the guy with OoO, it was necessary because you can still use that perk on the hook, and it would be hard for a killer to find anyone else while they have a constant radar of him.
---
I think that in THIS game, it’s a way to make fun of others, yes. Just because league of legends or csgo have other means to make fun of others, doesn’t justify tbagging in this game. Those are all different ways to be rude and disrespectful to others.
---
Stomps 14 games. Loses once. SURIVORS OP PLZ NERF WHAAAA
---
yup, survivors are so entitled.
---
I don’t know the artist cause it appeared in my Pinterest
---
exactly. facecamping is there to piss survivors off. if u dont let it, he only gets one kill and nobody is upset. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Only when the gates open
---
I just figured he could be a substitute pin head lol
---
its just an unfun way to play, but thats just my opinion
---
Seems like you got detected by the anticheat, maybe unlucky enough that they have that program on their blacklist, if that is the case, behaviour have nothing to do and easy anti-cheat doesn't remove any ban. I'm sorry.
---
Thanks. I think it might be because I mostly play solo queue.
---
Like I said, I've gotten to rank 1 before but that was before the rankings changes.
---
I guess it's just too hard solo queue at the moment. Even with high-rank teammates it feels really imbalanced and a lot of games wind up snowballing against us.
---
Are you really arguing that tea bagging isnt a way of making fun of someone in video games?
---
Pretty sure they are probs gonna end up getting pinhead at some point anyways and if you are gonna go with either of them people would prefer the real deal so people probably wouldn't be happy with him as a substitute
---
The people who dodged were 4man swf, ironic.
---
What ranks are you? Do you want a strong killer or a fun killer?   
---
Spirit is a solid pick as when you learn to use her she is one of the strongest killers. Her perks are decent. Rancor being a tracking perk, not as good as BBQ but you can kill the obsession. Haunted Ground is good on builds with other totems as it gives you a chance to expose everyone for daring to cleanse your stuff. Spirit Fury is probably the most useful and goes well with enduring and killers who you are most likely to attack with a basic attack, m1 killers. 
---
I personally really like the Plague and Ghostface. They aren't the strongest and probably at high ranks they will be weaker and more stressful to play. However if your not someone who religiously plays to get to rank 1 and you don't mind an L here and there as long as the games are fun I recommend them. Plague you can throw up all over people, her perks are ok but nothing to scream about. GF is just fun to lean about corners and be a creep in the bushes stalking people, again perks are ok but nothing to get too crazy for. 
---
Downside to GF is that you won't get a survivor whereas as you get Jane or Adam with the other two. Again their perks are ok in certain builds but nothing too meta from either. The most used is probably deliverance on Adam which allows you to get off first hook yourself if you have saved someone already that game. Great perk if your in a pinch but I have seen many people use it when someone is their to save simply to use the perk, this is a terrible move as the downside to this perk is your broken for a certain amount of time and you can't be healed. Not only have you robbed a teammate of unhook points but you have made it so your 1 shot for a while when you could of been full health. 
---
I recommend googling the survivors or killers your interested in and reading their perks/powers, also check out the skins because let's face it thats all survivors are. Only you know how you play so you will know what perks suit you best, I know people who religiously use spirit fury on a killer but I hardly ever do. Apologies for the speech but I didn't have much to go off so I thought I would give my own personal experience as most people will just say Spirit because she is the strongest.
---
I completely addressed your comment. You want to counter adrenaline? Dont let the survivors power the gates. Maybe you should run a perk that helped you do that instead of depending on NOED to bail you out.
---
I’m not inflicted, I play on PS4. 
---
I’m just saying (in my perspective) people can do what they want in KYF, but you HAVE to play normally when playing ... (how should I out this) ... ranked. 
---
Ofcourse it’s hard for behaviour to see when hacks are used only for kyf or for ranked so ... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Artist is u/JadeRapbit (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
Nah she’s actually pretty strong if you know how to use her. She’s probably the most balanced killer in the game honestly.
---
&gt; If you read the top of this thread, it was stated that NOED activating is indicative of failure by the killer.
---
It is. Whether protecting generators is the Killers main objective or not it still is in fact one of their objectives and failing said objective rewards them
---
&gt; I pointed out that both sides have emblems that can be completely ignored while not inherently meaning a loss (you can never heal, work on a gen, or unhook and still escape), and as such, saying "Since there's an emblem for something, it reflects the player's main job".
---
Nobody ever said since there’s an emblem for something, it reflects the player’s main job. What they’re saying is that emblem categories do reflect objectives for that player in the game. Ranking up is pretty much the only form of progression in this game so I think it’s fair to say that fulfillment of emblems count as your objectives. Also if a survivor never does any of those things they’re not going to pip and they certainly aren’t rewarded for it.
---
I was just joking. :) But to be fair, none of the meta perks would’ve saved me there. Looping the killer would’ve killed me as it would’ve taken too long and the timer would’ve run out. Breaking LOS is the only way to increase your chances of escaping during EGC when you’re the only one alive. Or not getting caught in the first place. But I had to hurry.
---
It’s really not, it’s just the way people look at it. People have it engraved into their head that t-bagging is toxic and bad. When in reality it’s literally someone crouching up and down which shows no significants.
---
The situations for getting stuck in a pallet varies and there is no guarantee the bug won’t randomly come up again if certain conditions are met, creating a solution for this is good just in case.
---
Or you have an overly altruistic swf group ...
---
dude mark spoiler, this is clearly a leaked dbd mobile screenshot.
---
Lmao. Perfect
---
Also true
---
Yea I am low rank playing GF because I didn't touch killer since last rank re-set and the amount of missed skillchecks is insane. At first I thought people were trolling me to be annoying but nope they just can't hit those bars. If you want to be really mean you should try running huntress lullaby and if it gets to 5 stack its like a firework show.
---
Yeah, us console players need to put up with a lot of “toxic” 12 year olds who think they’re way better than they are
---
But if you’re one of those players that just likes “meta” than get Spirit.
---
No that's one of the screenshots that came with Bill it's official artwork
---
Be aggressive and swing through them to get them down faster then like every other experienced killer?
---
Thank you so much. I appreciate all the advice and help!
---
Lol object or not though if OP camped they could just as easily provide that radar to their teamates by simply saying yeah fuckers camping me lol.  You don't need object to relay positioning info when they're right there  camping dat ass.
---
I started playing three days ago, and when i hook someone, i usually wait near until the entity appears. I dont camp i just stay near and sometimes gives them time to unhook so all can have fun. Still, i get called a camper and that my mum is gay.
---
Me too. 5 seconds at least.

When you realized the killer had judith's tombstone, and you're being lift up and realizing he also had dying light on me and even more realizing the fact that it's still 4 generators left and you just fucked your team by dying early. 
---
*happened to me yesterday
---
I like what you did with the proportions. Reminds me a lot of the artstyle of the cartoon Kids Next Door.
---
You are the one who needs to grow up. It is everyone's responsibility to make a game fun. Imagine being so self-centered that you think everything revolves around you, and that creating an enjoyable experience while playing a game is some kind of coddling.
---
I don't know what kind of employment you have that you feel like dog-eat-dog, all-for-one is an adult attitude, but clearly you've never been a part of any sort of team. Being able to cooperate with others  and work towards a mutual goal is the most important quality any employer looks at when they hire. If you can't see that, enjoy being poor and unsuccessful your entire "adult" life.
---
The killer role is intended to be played as a particularly bloodthirsty DM. You are there to create an exciting experience for the other players, not to be a 4k machine or a punching bag. (Yes, by the devs. That's why the pipping system is designed as it is.) If you aren't good enough to perform that role, then work on it. Killer is easier than it has ever been, and that gives good players a lot of freedom to sculpt the game experience as they see fit.
---
Facecamping isnt toxic or bad, it's just the way people look at it. People have it engraved in their head that it is though, when really it's just literally sitting in front of a survivor and confirming their kill.
---
You still didn't answer my question, nice.
---
It's a strategy at low-mid rank considering how many people don't understand to just focus gens and instead all bombard the hook and give the killer free kills.
---
Oh you can do game bugs in KYF without punishment (said by a dev while people exploited 2 killers match) but you can't use any program that mod the game in any way and if you do, it will be detected by the anticheat
---
Get Leatherface, you know, because of Barbeque And Chili.
---
Tbh , I never took Spirit as an option but after I read your comment I took a second look on her and it seemed cool . Thank you .
---
(No need be sorry about your speech ;) )
---
I think it’s supposed to be a risk/reward thing - you can run the killer there, but if you get got you’re going in the basement which is the most dangerous place on the map.
---
Title checks out
---
my killer games have been pretty quick as of late on PS4. some times i get up when i searhc for a map but in 3 seconds i have a game and rush back to the controller. what rank are you?
---
Yea it really sucks. I just want to play non toxic games but then I have a full team of Survivors t bagging me at the exit gates after gen rushing.
---
yea rite
---
&gt; And please, you're acting like taunting shouldn't be responded to
---
Like i said, i don't really care ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Getting so worked up over something like that seems just silly and quite childish tbh.
---
And rewards the killer for outright failing an objective. If totems are going to be treated as an objective than they need to be tracked as the objectives for both sides are. I never said finding totems was difficult, I said it was difficult to ensure all 5 totems are cleansed as a solo survivor and your experience isn’t indicative of everyone playing the game
---
As if you're getting downvoted for this lmao. You have to be a pretty bad Spirit to not hear an injured survivor and get a free down during phase.
---
Tell him yourself
---
I'm pretty sure that survivors main goal when facing new killers is to make them quit the game :P when I was new I got dozens of messages calling me trash (on ps4, so they really need to go out of their way to send them) and 1 guy sent me a message giving me really solid advice. I almost quit this game before I gave it a chance and I'm glad I didn't because it's probably my favorite game, or at least the only one that I play regularly:)
---
or don't be the killer that doesn't have even 1 functioning brain cell like this one.
---
I didn’t claim she’s OP. I asked why she’s not considered as such. 
---
By the way. Isn’t looping hated by the community?
---
HAHAHA
---
That's a flat out lie.
---
1: My comment was pointing out that killers can't straight up destroy survivor perks for the match.
---
2: I don't run NOED when I do play because with my luck the survivors break the totems.
---
3: do you even understand how the game works? You can have a short chase and have multiple gens pop. If the survivors focus on gens and are halfway competent in not dying they win, easy as that. The killer is generally speaking completely reactive. If both sides play perfectly the survivors win.
---
But of course you're going to try and dismiss the facts because you like the ease of playing survivor.
---
do you know when is next sale?
---
not missing the vomit and at least breaking him before he escapes would be smarter
---
Then your probably a good killer and I am not saying it isn't possible to do, I have taken freddy up to rank 1, just that it is a lot more stressful. To me OP was stating how its not like the horror game it tries to depict, survivors all scared and hiding with a killer appearing all menacing. At high ranks that is not a thing, survivors don't care and they do try to loop killers about. I have had moments where I thought how ridiculous this chase would be in a horror movie with a survivor just running about a block waiting for the opportune moment to drop that pallet. 
---
The fear that most horror games can elicit is not their once you have a few hours under your belt on this game. Like I said I have seen streamers who play this game religiously even say how red ranks are a nightmare and most killers will struggle for a win. Tru3Ta1ent was recently stating only Spirit and Nurse are the most viable at that rank because in red rank you rely on survivors messing up for you to capitalise rather than the killer dictating the game. I am not saying it is harder than when double pallets and the vacuum pallet existed but it still doesn't feel like your really as dominating as Michael Myers is in the Halloween films.
---
Found the baby dwight
---
Swapped themes with another sub. Not the best April fools joke but could have been a lot worse, like how BPT's "Joke" was to exclude certain races from posting unless they sent picture verification with their username.
---
I suppose we have fundamentally different views of "winning" a match. As far as I'm concerned, escaping as a survivor or 4killing as a killer is success, regardless of pipping up. 
---
Under the Ranking = success model, I feel like perks such as Bloodwarden, Fire Up, and NOED shouldn't even be in the game at all considering they only activate when you've lost all chance at Gatekeeper. Although I don't think I've ever heard anyone say those other two perks reward killers for failing their job.
---
Dead hard and adrenaline caught the exhaustion nerfs. 
---
Borrowed time has been nerfed before. 
---
D strike was literally reworked and the rework was so bad it needed buffed a patch later to not be dogshit (and btw the only times you get hit with BT or D strike is when you deserve it). 
---
Lithe and BL caught exhaustion nerfs. 
---
Lmao imagine thinking Bond is one of the god tier Survivior perks.
---
I'm totally not ragging on anyone's opinion here, but the solution to a flaw with the core gameplay design (predator vs prey) shouldn't be "play only these killers" or if it is, they shouldn't have any of the other killers then. Just a tip for the future when in a conversation about game issues.
---
AKA "Bubba enjoying the view from his perch"
---
That would be half the killers gone to be fair
---
If they didn't down anyone until the last gen was done they didn't deserve a hook to begin with.
---
Does Quick and Quiet eliminate the visual/audio cue for the killer where they can see where you just jumped through/entered? Or is it only eliminating the actual noise of doing so?
---
That's how I went from 0 to 4 kills in quick succession once.
---
Bet you wish you had on spirit fury
---
You can't really see it from the screenshot but I assure you there's a pallet at the jungle gym as well.
---
And it may pain you to read this but this ungodly setup was wasted by a big brain Meg main dropping both pallets 20 feet ahead of me while I used Feral Frenzy.
---
That's bc killers tunnel and D strike punishes them for doing so. You only *EVER* get hit with D strike when you deserved to get hit with it. You wanna see less D strike, start pressing BHVR to implement gameplay punishments for killers Tunnelling. 
---
And Adrenaline bc it's comparable to Noed, except Surviviors actually have to earn it.
---
nobody said it was god tier, we were talking about *good* perks. not amazing perks. 
---
borrowed time is still extremely good. 
---
all exhaustion perks are still good. there was no exhaustion “nerf,” it was a change so you couldnt activate it twice in one chase without walking.
---
d-strike is still decent, it counters tunneling extremely well
---
Hey at least I got Brutal :p
---
Nah man, i play both sides. Im just sick to fucking death of playing against entitled toxic killers that think when they win its because they're hot shit and skilled and when they lose its because survivors are OP. Its a convientent and pathetic option select.
---
Solo survivor is dumpster fire atm, and it pisses me off that I cant get killer games (even to just clear dailies) because all these sweaty losers are clogging the queue. 
---
Killers have had a year straight of buffs and survivor nerfs and its still nothing but complaints about SWF, Adrenaline, DS, Maps, Flashlights, Pallets etc. 
---
Survivors are like "man its really frustrating losing the killer all game only to get hit exactly once by NOED and then getting sac'd" or "Man, it sure is frustating getting hard tunneled or camped and de-pipping because the killer never gave me an opportunity to do something else." 
---
But killers are allowed to complain and its all justified, survivors are just salty and entitled.
---
You all sound like a bunch of entitled survivor mains with your whining about balance. Remember you’re playing against real people on the other end that are putting just as much time getting better not CPUs. The game is suppose to be challenging for all involved not quick and easy. If you’re relying on meta perks or top tier killers then you’re not challenging yourself in the game. If you can’t win a top tier match then maybe you don’t belong in top tier ie ranking up is broken. Every match is going to be different. The way the game is built everyone has a chance to have a good match or a bad match. 4ks are not guaranteed, surviving is not guaranteed. Stop acting like they are.
---
If she has Black Incense then you’re pretty much giving her permanent BBQ while also being exposed the whole game which results into an easy 4K. Sometimes it’s better to just cleanse and wait til her corrupt runs out.
---
wtf is the original pic
---
That's not what he's saying.
---
Ignoring them completely is more fun imho. Let them have fun doing gens by themselves while their teammates get chased around.
---
Yesterday I was playing spirit with prayer beads and a red mori. I killed 3 survivors with the mori, and carried the last one to the hatch. I let him crawl really close to the hatch and then closed it in his face. 
---
Then I moried him right on top of the hatch.
---
If only you had enduring and spirit fury with that brutal 😂
---
Well, many things are hated by community.
---
Looping isn't a exploit or something, so you can do it.
---
baby nurse :3
---
because you looped them the whole game? because the killer didnt do so well they dont deserve a hook. ok then
---
Lol what? No it wouldn't.
---
When outside of her TR, Spirit makes a vacuum-like sound when she starts phasing. It gives Survivors a chance to stop what they're doing and not get gen grabbed or caught out in a terrible place. Prayer Beads mutes this noise and makes gen grabs so much easier because you can literally never tell whether she might be near
---
damn i would have been upset to be left behind like that but judging by the bloodpoints you did most of the legwork this round
---
When few word do trick
---
Stop complaining, git gud. Nice advice.
---
Ditto, the Pig has been insanely fun as someone just getting into the killer side of the game.
---
When she uses her power she makes a wooosh sound and thats whats get muted.
---
This thread is literally called no stupid questions.  You should edit your post and apologize.
---
Since no one has answered you yet, it's a perk that allows the survivors to stun the killer if they are getting out of a locker. The catch is that the killer has to be close enough to the locker doors to be stunned or else it won't work.
---
B I T C H     T H I C C
---
Now all we need is a grown up version of the kids to be added in as survivors and it would be perfect lmao
---
🦀BEHAVIOR INTERACTIVE IS POWERLESS AGAINST GHOSTFACE🦀
---
Yeah it was just funny timing
---
Punch
---
Remove the Killer crutches, nerf the skill less killer perks, buff useless survivor perks and items, remove ranking cause most killers smurf anyway, and then the playerbase will come back.
---
We don’t hear any wind noise. It sounds kind of like the hatch for reference. So your answer is there is a large difference
---
I'll take that as a good thing, that cartoon rocked lmao
---
I mean I'm an experienced survivor, but I fucking hate prayer beads. Spirit emits no phasing sound and can get easy gen grabs. The *only* counter to prayer beads as a survivor is to (a) gen tap or (b) be **very** observant. Grass will still move when she walks through while phasing, and on hard ground maps like The Game or Lery's, you will still hear very faint footsteps when she's extremely close. 
---
When she's planewalking regularly, you can hear a *woosh* noise as she gets closer.
---
Saying that Hag is 4th best killer in my opinion means that I don't understand how powerful she is ? Wow ...
---
It depends on the survivor and on the killer. If you just chase them around it in a straight line, not often. If they’re a looping god, not often. If you manipulate your red stain and read the survivor you can get a hit against most people, since it at least is possible to mind game there.
---
Definitely unintentional but sure is similar!
---
Yes because all survivors are dicks who want to ruin the killer's fun. That's a pretty broad generalization.
---
I agree immersing is dull and the chase is more fun as a survivor but that is OPs point that it isn't this asymetrical horrror were a killer is the fearsome beast striding a map slaughtering. Often it is just chasing people around loop after loop and the way survivors act you can tell their is no fear. This is a shame because for me personally games against Lery's scratched mirror Myers, or a great pig who ambushes like a ninja are the scariest and most fun. Its a horror game after all I want some horror. 
---
I watched Tru3 last week and he was discussing the rumours of the Nurse or Spirit base power being nerfed and he literally said he might stop playing killer if that happened because other killers are weak. He barely plays certain killers, like clown, because it is so hard to get a win in red rank as those killers and often the games are dictated by the survivors. He has frequently said games he has lost that he did everything right but the survivors are the optimal on gens they just smash them and get out. 
---
Yes winning with weaker killers at red rank is possible but more often than not its because a survivor messed up not because the killer made a great play. These weak killers only help reduce the horror factor of this game because your just not scared of them, unless like OP said they play with their best add-ons. I am excited for hide or die when that finally drops because if it can still have the running about element of DBD but the killer feels terrifying it will be very interesting.
---
owo
---
Looks like another shitty anime that people love for some reason
---
My point exactly. You have to almost literally bend over backwards to get a hit there because the games intended way of getting a survivor doesn't give you the tools necessary to do it.
---
Emergency medkits don't grow on trees
---
You forgot Spine Chill as one of the counters.
---
Ah very true my bad.
---
You said she was useless, not 4th best. 4th best implies very good.
---
Catching me a mouse
---
Well at least you tried. I get my ass handed to me all the time as survivor... its rough out there when you solo...
---
did u see the second line? hes complaining about waiting times which is what i was addressing.
---
Yes Borrowed time and D strike are still good. As they should be. Perks that exist like BT and D strike are allowed to be as powerful as possible. This is bc they punish killers for being toxic. If you camp a hook, you deserve to get hit with BT. If you Tunnel off the hook you deserve to get stabbed with D strike. If ur being toxic then you deserve the hardest punishment that BHVR is willing to Dole out to you, and I'm glad they keep buffing D strike directly or indirectly (enduring rework for example). 
---
The exhaustion change ur describing is a power down, which is a nerf. Lmao what happened to exhaustion is a nerf bc it made it less powerful. Adrenaline is a 1 time use perk that Surviviors have to earn, Dead hard works at best once and then good killers play around it. Lithe is fine, so is balanced landing. 
---
And if we're gonna talk about good perks, it's not like killers have 2 good perks and then the rest are just dogshit. 
---
Nurses calling, Overcharge, Monitor and Abuse, Make your choice, Devour hope, Corrupt intervention, Surveillance. These are just some examples of good killer perks. It's not like Surviviors got all the good perks and killers were shoved in lockers and left to rot.
---
Sounds like somebody is mad because they lost an item. Suck it up. If you really want to make killer lose a perk slot just bring a brown item. Killers don’t know the color of the item
---
That does seem odd. I know it doesn't sound like a great solution but did you try reinstalling the game? I had performance issues with it on XBox One and after a reinstall it actually performed better. Sorry to not be of much help.
---
His lack of a terror radius reminds me of the Pig but for some reason I have a lot more fun playing against the Pig than GF. Maybe because of that stalking ability.
---
I started playing last week. My first ever game as killer I got tea bagged and bmed by 3/4 survivors. That's when I realised how beautiful this community is
---
Mr
---
Lemme break down what you said. 
---
If you looped a killer all game, through tier 3 Bloodlust and everything, for 5 generators, and they at best only hit you once, do you think they deserved a hook? 
---
Bc if you do, ur very biased.
---
You really don’t have to bend over backwards, you just have to play better than your opponent. Which is exactly how it should be in any multiplayer game. 
---
The game’s intended ways of killers catching survivors: faster movement speed, red glow manipulation, blood lust. All of those things help you at the killer shack.
---
If the timer is active u cant
---
I actually did, I watch my answer to the OP.
---
Also, watch my tier list, where I place Hag in A tier ...
---
if they get the down, they obviously worked for it so they deserved it. adrenaline kinda just kinda prevents that from happening. you get picked up and loop more
---
Make your choice has been out for about 4 DLCs now and you're the only person I have ever seen whine about it. There's MUCH more important issues with the game right now than the fact that the nurse can teleport which makes a perk more viable for her (e.g. Not being able to escape because the exit gate is glitched)
---
When are the dedicated servers coming out?
---
"when you activate a trap and shit yourself". 
---
Many pairs of underwear were sacrificed to the Entity my first few days as a Survivior
---
You're probably better off not even messaging them. In all honesty it probably gave them even more incentive to DC, knowing it would tick you off.
---
I’m disappointed that there is only a few pieces of rule 34 of her.
---
If the killer gets looped for 5 gens and still can't catch a Survivior through the entity blocker, tier 3 Bloodlust, and naturally being faster than the Survivior, then they didn't deserve the hook. 
---
Killers have every Natural chase advantage. If a Survivior loops you for 5 gens then you just suck and don't deserve the down.
---
r/imagesyoucanhear
---
As opposed to a killer using an ebony mori which is totally not a pussy-move and very respectable... You're a bigger pussy than anyone bruh.
---
&gt;Its not a good or effective perk.
---
Id argue thats its a *very* effective perk. 
---
Unless youre very good at chases, Keys will probably get lost.
---
Lightborn only increases your resistance and recovery, you can still be blinded. Franklin's removes the item from their hands. They cant blind you *at all*. If you use Lightborn youre using a perk slot to counter one specific item. Sure, it doesn't remove the Insta-Heal add-on, but they cant use Insta-Heal if they dont have their medkit anymore. 
---
I do agree with the Toolbox bit. The only time Franklin's would be useful then is if they have BNP.
---
It gets rid of both
---
Anyone wanna tell him that we figured out the MYC and Nurse synergy like 50 years ago?
---
Yeah, paying 12k for an item and 2 addons to have them lost because you get hit once is obnioxious. Franklins doesnt help the killer win, its just to spite survivors. Theres absolutely better perks to run. 
---
And I do bring brown items to bait bad killers into bringing franklins, and sometimes I take good items too. I bring an item every game, because youre supposed to, the game is designed that way.
---
It doesn't make any sense really ... you slug all four and wonder wtf they were thinking lol.
---
If you really want to go crazy with yoinking survivors, you could try a full hex build. Ruin, Haunted Ground, Devour Hope, and Thrill of the Hunt with prayer beads and the mother daughter ring. Every time thrill lets you know someone has touched a totem, you zoom over and snatch em lol
---
You dont get it
---
I don't think killers have ever wondered why people play SWF.
---
Uh what? if you get face camped then not only can the survivors play, but now they can play with impunity because they know exactly where the killer is and what he's doing.
---
He wouldn't be able to get him to Broken in time, he was on 0 infection and had the action speed boost from spine chill.
---
You can also fix the bug
---
I main Jane and this is exactly why I main her 😂
---
Because I wanna die after being hooked once, cutting my life in half. Yep. Fair and balanced.
---
The Game is full of safe pallet, you can loop him forever
---
ballsy move, using 2 perks in red ranks. Like Jesus man, balls the size of fucking truck tires
---
From what it looks like, they got beaned with vote manipulation/brigading. Whether or not it was malicious/intentional, reddit takes its upvotes/downvotes seriously when someone makes another subreddit and then creates posts to it's users to go to another (this subreddit) and influence voting. Even if it's something as innocuous as "see pig &gt; upvote"
---
Shut up brain damaged fat girl you come in here talking shit and hten get surprised when I call you names? Fuck outta here.
---
last i remember DH never got a nerf, maybe only QoL changes but def worth getting it
---
I'm not sure. I saw if on here though. You can prob search post top of all time or possibly the last year and easily find it.
---
None of the perks is toxic, only people's behaviour can be toxic
---
Yeah they're both r etardedly with this perk but with hag you can just destroy the traps unless youre a fucking noob which I'm sure you are hahahahahaha
---
I could buy a full indie game for the price of a head cosmetic, oof
---
imagine getting this riled up over a fucking reddit post kek
---
If you see this as as a survivor slow vault the pallet. Killer can grab you and will be free.
---
So i know they are looking in my direction, but have no clue from what angle? That's what I thought which is why I took the perk off a long time ago. Thanks
---
Or the 300th tier list of the same joke "My tier list of 'if characters are the Wraith'"
---
Wow you got me...im destroyed. I better uninstall.
---
No he's not. He's complaining that during loading, his fans go crazy with the strain. 'During the loading screen'. He's not complaining about loading times.
---
Wow you so bigbrained, it's not a synergy it's a design flaw, did you really think the devs we're making these anti-camp perks so that overpowered killers could become better at camping? You found the synergy but you were too dumb to see it was a design mistake, go back to the kitchen and make me a sandwich.
---
Nurse is the problem, not Make Your Choice. MYC is equally crazy on anyone. The fast that she can VVVVOOOOOP across the map just means she can make 300% use out of fucking ANYTHING.
---
How'd you get it formatted so nicely? To look like a real killer background? Is there a website or something that automatically does it?
---
Honestly the red ranks aren't too bad, you will find the most toxic players in the purple ranks because there they can bully the killers that are way below their level
---
Usually I think I think it’s friends helping out their friends who just bought the game but I generally hope people don’t actually buy coaches for this game lol
---
This is why SWF is strong. Solo que is a literal nightmare, no matter the rank.
---
Don't feed the trolls, you're on Xbox just turn off messaging trust me it's actually a fun game once you do that
---
But that's pretty damn time consuming, isn't it? And time is something killer do not have.
---
Shut up fat girl go make me sandwich and stop snacking on the peanutbutter.
---
Ghostface is missing but i would assume he joins myers as a sneaky boy
---
Yeah you're really moron but you can still enjoy rank 10-15 with the other noobs on this subreddit.
---
If we're talking like totem placement as "map rng" I think that could definitely improve.
---
*Proceeds to get sniped by billy*
---
Hahahahahhahahahahajaa "it's my team" XD
---
btw id never eat anything that your hands came close to
---
What's the top right one? Never seen that. The middle right one is Endurance for BT or MoM, but I've never seen the slashed one.
---
I didn't notice them stick out while phasing
---
It is applied when you hit someone with Frenzy, though keep in mind it only still slows down healing and not mending. Overall it's still worth running on Legion, really any perk that benefits from hitting survivors a lot does.
---
Freddy mains rise up
---
Well did he fucking 4k you? You gave no details
---
Do you even have a reason to hate on anime?
---
Burn damaged photo
---
That’s called ‘Prayer Beads’ and it’s a purple add-on.
---
Ye, he face camped me and my friends
---
youre the one who asked me to make you a sandwich, make up your mind!
---
I too like the masks from Etsy hee hee
---
It wasn’t a perk. It’s the End Game Collapse (EGC), when the gates are open or the hatch is closed by the killer, a timer/progress bar at the top of the screen starts to lower. When it hits 0, all survivors left in the trial are immediately sacrificed. It’s pretty much a “get the fuck out of there” for survivors so they don’t hang around
---
This is the second time Iv seen this line used in a meme. First was on the destiny sub now here. Can somebody tell me the origin of this text? I’m rather interested.
---
I see tons of gentappers and people who scout out Ruin all game before they even think about doing a gen. I push through the Ruin and can hit the skillchecks. So yeah, it's my team.

I groan whenever Jane appears in my lobby - she is gonna get us caught. :(
---
When I was 13 for some reason I always held in my shit. When I had to go, I would nervously go to the bathroom, stand in the mirror holding in my crap, and after trying to relax the urge to release would go away. Of course, this wouldn't last forever. Eventually, after a couple of days, I would painfully take a big shit. I would also clog the toilet (I don't come from a poop knife family.) It was a stressful loop that only caused me to do it over and over again.
---
Fast forward to the summer and when I was at camp. I was always around other kids, playing sports, running around, eating lots of fibrous foods in the cafeteria, hanging out in my cabin, but I never got the chance to sneak away and go to the bathroom. To make matters worse, the bathrooms at the camp had no stalls so it wouldn't be completely strange for people to sit next to each other while going to the bathroom. I was fucked.
---
One night after 15 days of holding in a crap I couldn't take it anymore. In the dead of night, I left my cabin, limped down the path to the bathroom, made sure no one was awake, and under the glow of halogen lights, I birthed the biggest, bloodiest shit. It took me 40 minutes to get out. I remember holding the pipes of the toilet next to me and staring up at the moths fluttering around the lights, praying I wouldn't die. The water splashing brought me back to reality. It was wider than a Campbell's soup can and more than foot long. Too thick to rope, it instead it jutted straight out of the water and toilet like a spire. I couldn't get away from it quick enough.
---
The next morning I woke up to a lot of commotion around camp, everyone was trying to figure out who was the phantom shitter. People crowded around the bathroom and tried to get a sight at the shit. It was even bigger in the daylight. You could see the marbled striations of the smaller shits fused together into the super shit.
---
Everyone suspected each other. The whole summer seemed to revolve around the mystery. Best friends blamed each other. I also blamed a few people to keep my cover. I was so scared that the camp would figure out that it was me.
---
One night camp counselors told the younger kids that the shit was from a murderer on the loose. You can imagine the effect it had.
---
Needless to say, they never found me, and they never will.
---
If I find it I'll comment your username
---
Just take some time, your brain is so dumb it'll probably forget about this very soon with the occasional traumatic flashback which you will also forget.
---
To prevent it however is very simple, stfu and let the grownups talk because in some conversations people prefer to not hear the 50 hour rank 15s opinions.
---
Well the lore isn't that deep for like 90% of the cast. I do enjoy that Legion/Jeff are one of the only pairs (quintets?) of killer/survivor that are actually related aside from licensed characters. Legion are still just a group of teenagers and though I'm not sure about Susie and Joe; Frank and Julie have the making of becoming serial killers, it's like the entity pulled them in when they were just starting out.

This is some A1 bait honestly

I love it so much fun 😂

Exactly my reason to uninstall

same but with dwight

Yeah didn't say I was gonna eat it though.
---
Survivors that say this are the same survivors who run all meta perks and coordinate tactics with friends over discord.
---
The most loving community x The most toxic community ❤️ The love feels real
---
Survivors that cry about being "camped" and "tunneled" even though they teebag and immediately unhook their teammates so you think their farming bur their just horrible and then they call you trash even though their doing the most predictable shit and depending on their perks
---
It is bad yes, but if you pray 3 ave maria's and promise Jesus that you won't do it again then he'll forgive you and you and your friends will be okay. :)
---
That’s nearly impossible unless.... no one did gens?
---
Lol truetalent viewer found, I wonder what your killermain saltmachine would say about nurses with MYC.
---
I read Enema Pain LOL.

Damn they gotta stop buffing shadowborn

There’s only one thing you can do and its called Franklins Demise.

franklins is the safest bet

Congrats.

Your reddit username literally has Ochido in it.  You don’t get to shit talk other content creators 😂

Same with spirit
---
They literally spawned in with the spirit. She happened to just pop up and be there which reminded me of using prayer beads. That seems pretty relatable. There was absolutely no need to respond to my comment so rudely at first.
---
true true, well im gonna get outta your hair and go back to playing dead by daylight on my mobile phone, buh bye
---
Severely underrated in my opinion.
---
It's silences your haunting when you activate it
---
Slug and Franklin's. I don't think a survivor in dying state can use a key.
---
Just make it so that you wiggle out 5%/10%/15% faster. It would make it more useful but not completely over powered. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
I hate this stupid fucking phrase all you toxic shitbags use. "LoL I WOulD'vE LIkEd tO sEe yUo iN a Mw2 lOBbY" Fuck you, MW2 was toxic as shit and was a complete shit show. That doesn't excuse every other form of toxicity. Grow up.
---
3 months is the average between DLC so expect the next ones around then. Though we are are expecting a Freddy rework here soon 
---
Actually pig and Tapp are getting new skins. I would expect if they sell well then we will see others get them.
---
I had this on xbox and they destroyed me.
---
**is Deep Wound**  The Survivor is on a bleed-out timer until healed or mended. example:  [Borrowed Time](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Borrowed_Time) or  [Feral Frenzy](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Feral_Frenzy)
---
Shes ugly af tho
---
Only on PC it is some add on/mod
---
It's just obvious only a killermain could not see a problem with MYC on Nurse. I bet even Truegayness would know it is a broken combination.
---
Of course I'm going to help the other survivors. They're food for the killer. I'm just not going out of my way to do it and if it comes to leaving or saving someone then I'm out.
---
Thx
---
They have a right to play whatever they want.
---
And I have a right to think they’re insecure garbage cans.
---
I actually think they can tbh
---
lol
---
I always bring deliverance or kindred now to solo games for this reason. At least kindred will force them to admit they know what they've done.
---
Wait wait wait. I thought when she is planewalking she makes no noise only when she activates it....
---
They were all great loopers, I was lucky to be playing Hag against them! The last one was the worst; I hadn’t hooked them the whole round because it was usually a waste of time to follow them. I placed a trap inside the house that they had been running me through earlier, which happened to be by the gate. Got a lucky hit in, chased her back there, and when she set off the trap she was cornered and an easy down.
---
The only nerf was the exhaustion change to all exhaustion perks
---
Sadly the locker bug doesn’t include in this pic :( Still remember when you can see survivor slowly slide of the locker tho xD
---
Your playing wrong then
---
and only now i find out she's russian...and hums the russian lullaby.  
---
i feel ashamed i didnt know this previously and now i must add her to my rotation of killers.   gotta do my russian girl proud
---
We made an attempt to save eachother
---
The Graphics check out.
---
If it works it works
---
Ps4 6 hours a day every day of the event and not a single farmer. Not that it really matters cause it can get boring yet that has been my experience.
---
Not true
---
Please tell me that the spirit didn't take it as a free hit rather than a funny glitch
---
Only when ~~the gates are open~~ you want a pitty kill instead of bloodpoints. 
---
ftfy
---
T-posing is the best tho lmao
---
Runescape and DBD are in the same universe.
---
They cant use the key in dying state or any item
---
*Mr X pulls survivor out of safe zone*
---
None, I don't farm.
---
From rank 16-7 every killer i played against was "farming" and didn't hook anyone trying to derank on purpose until the Devs changed it. They should remove ranks at this point.
---
Yeah, but OoO is one of the strongest perks in the game if you're an SWF. I can't agree with not moriing or camping that guy out of the game.
---
He's right about the running the killer around like a clown. They should be afraid of getting chased but now it's all a joke.
---
I didn't say All, I mentioned the 1 guy that helped me and encouraged me to keep playing. Although he could have been a killer main who was just playing as survivor XD but yea I used a generalization based upon my experiences in this game.

Good night pal. See you in hot when I wake up.

BITCH, HUH HUH!
---
Ha, I was Hag as well.  Didn't go well for me.
---
But be careful, this breaks the EULA agreement thingy and you could get banned, although the chance is incredibly small
---
Well he just called a guy with mental issues and fucktard. He should be banned from this subreddit.
---
Their response wasn’t rude. You decided to interpret it that way, and spawning next to the killer doesn’t have anything to do with an add on for a killer.
---
I just don't anymore.  Too many killers have been pulling the troll "Fake Farm" tactic, where they pretend they want to farm, and then end up with 1 hooked/2 slugged while taunting.   This erodes the trust and eliminates any farming.
---
How does Devourer of hope work? Sorry for all these questions 😁

This is why I use Vigo’s Shroud.

How does spinechill work? Like how can it be used advantageously?

Amazing idea 10/10
---
We did a gen and he still camped
---
Hag, because teleportation and big scares
---
Happened to me as Clown. The 2 survivors teabagged me and called me fat as they did all 5 gens :(
---
This makes me self conscious of how many killer games I possibly played where I stared directly at a Claudette and ignored her because I didn't notice her.
---
Overly altruistic SWF encourages camping behavior.  If I know it is a SWF lobby, I always camp the first dude.  Very rarely do they just do gens to punish the camper.   Easy 4k.
---
8 out of 10 of my games are on the damn swamp these days
---
Fucking Object of Obsession.
---
It lights up when the killer is looking at you. Against some killers like T2 Myers with a low terror radius, Spirit, Ghostface, Amanda And Wraith, this is excellent for knowing they’re looking at you before they plan to go in so you have a moment or two for getting away. Against other killers it lets you know whenever you should stop doing an action because if you’re healing someone or unhooking it lets you know how soon you have to get out the area.
---
thank you!!
---
From the wiki:
---
The Hag seems to be heavily based on the Wendigo, an Algonquian myth that says those who commit cannibalism will become possessed by spirits, deformed and eventually turn insane. This is suggested by The Hag's appearance, Memento Mori, backstory, and a few Hag-related items in the game which talk about cannibalism.
---
If your noed kicks in, all the gens have been complete. Big surprise, but there’s actually more to the game after gens are complete.
---
You seem like a little goblin baby
---
Is that the club penguin Dojo music
---
You’re the same person that uses NOED on fuckin Spirit? Take a seat and hold the L
---
No it works between 50 (or so it changes per level of perk/if obsession) and your terror radius.
---
Level 1 Myers has no radius so OoO sees him permanently, I believe.
---
OoO works OUTSIDE the Killer's terror radius. So the smaller the Killer's terror radius, the closer they can see you. Makes going against Myers and Ghost Face laughable.
---
I just try to get players to hate playing survivor
---
The second I’m insta downed by a hatchet I’m ya yeeting straight the fuck out 😂
---
My personal opinion, add on to it as you please but don’t flame me
---
^best strat. I never 4k so that I'll never double pip. Slows your ranking down, just a little bit
---
From what i saw in the vid. U r in tier i. Ur terror radius is only like 4 meters so they could see u through the walls. Also u couldn’t catch up bc tier one is super slow
---
If ur not in tier one then its forsure broken but i doubt it
---
Wendigo only ever occur near northern territory, she's from swamplands, almost definitely Louisiana. Just because she's based on a wendigo doesn't mean she is one.

He's allowed to facecamp you just as you're allowed (and really, are encouraged) to loop him. It's all part of the game and I don't know why anyone feels the need to justify why they looped, camped, tunneled or gen-rushed.
---
There are basically no game actions that people won't complain about. Ignore the whining.
---
Good point my guy, maybe We'll try that
---
Ah, I've never seen the end of EGC so I didn't recognize it until I saw it I guess haha. Thanks for responding so fast
---
In what universe does it make sense to wander of to an *OPEN* Exit Gate when there's three survivors waiting to yoink the P3 Flashlight Claudette of the hook?
---
I should probably rephrase it and give a bit more context. After the game, one of the survivors messaged me the usual, how it's easy to play legion, especially when you tunnel and camp (keep in mind none of that happened) and then proceeded to tell me how him and his friends (they were in a swf group) were reporting me for unsportsmanlike, I tell him cheers, and block him. From what I guess, he also got his friends to report me on profile as well, because he was the only person to be toxic like that in a good long while, and that was my first killer game in a while.
---
Well done!
---
That’s not the point. She’s too similar to a wendigo for them to add one. It doesn’t matter if she is one; she’s too related.
---
Laughs in bloodlust
---
As in ur a massive bitch for face camping, but you’re allowed to. Survivors feel so much more entitled than killers, claiming reports will happen,  just because they can’t gen rush the killer for once
---
Sounds like a boldfaced lie but alright
---
LOL!
---
Killer main can confirm
---
The one where you get more BP chasing and smacking survivors out of the gate then you would standing in front of the hook for 200 sac points. 
---
But hey, if a 3 escape makes you feel better about yourself then a 4 escape, you do you. I try to maximize my BP even in games that are already lost, but thats just me.
---
lol truth.

Damn! Spot on!

The medkit functions normally, but it has an additional function with the insta heal add-on. If while using the medkit you press space, the medkit will be consumed and the insta heal applied. Ideally, to get most see out of the medkit, you use it to heal normally first, and then you use the insta heal when it only has 10% charge left.
---
Hahaha! Roblox had a dbd mode?! That's cute
---
I’m not saying you can’t do it but it’s just kinda bullshit and unfun for survivors, and most nurses are sweaty fellows who need to get rank 1 on the first day so their mom will buy them the new Fortnite battle pass
---
He'd always be watching you
---
The biggest problem is that it's a ton of fun to play with, so Spirits probably run it more often than not. The gen grab never gets old. I only avoid using Beads because I get at *least* a DC per 2-3 matches while using it, and that makes the game a lot less fun for both me and the remaining survivors. 
---
Only thing more obnoxious that I can come up with is if Nurse had a silent blink addon.
---
For insta heals, using it is pressing secondary action (space on PC, LB on XBOX, L1 on PS4) while using your item. Using it instantly heals and destroys the Medkit on use. 
---
The Purple Instaheal heals one health state. IE use it to instantly heal another survivor from Dying to Injured, or Injured to healthy. It can be used on yourself, and the purple one is best suited for using it on yourself.
---
The Pink instaheal immediately heals from Dying to HEALTHY. You CAN use it on yourself, but you waste an entire health state. Use it on a teammate who just went down to make them full health and reset whatever the killer has done. 
---
Warning: They lower the amount of charges of your Medkit. I advise placing them first, then adding a charge add-on so you can squeeze a full heal. IE Yellow Medkit, then use The Pink Instaheal and the Yellow Gauze in that order. This allows you to heal to full once, THEN still have some left over to make use of the instant heal.
---
I would personally put Freddy in the same tier as Legion. Waking up is about as engaging as mending with all of the tunnel that can come with it.
---
Tinkerer is really good with tuft + tombstone. Not very common though.
---
No worries. Ggs
---
Wow 55 upvotes? Most I've had before was 23! Yall are cracked
---
&gt; Survivors feel so much more entitled than killers 
---
Where does that come from? I can only speak from my experience but I personally know that I'm entitled to way less as a survivor than as a killer. I know that I can get yoinked with prayer beads in the first 30 seconds, get facecamped and die on first hook. I am never guaranteed to even have a chance at playing the game. Whereas as a killer, though I can have a terrible time, I at least know I'll get to play it out.
---
Maybe you think survivors act way more entitled because they more often face situations where they are basically denied any kind of gameplay? In that case, I think their sense of entitlement is at least somewhat justified, though they should really just shut up and accept that loading in as a survivor comes with no promise that you will get to, you know, even play the game.
---
Just doing it for fun dude. Upvotes aren't everything
---
Then why you accused me that I didn't say that Hag is 4th best killer, even if you didn't know that ?
---
Thanks much
---
I don't quit but ebony moris are dumb and I could understand not wanting to play against that
---
There have been multiple posts about this happen in the past and mostly the killer either just goes to find someone else or give them like a 10 sec headstart.
---
Yeah I really feel that the biggest change ranking up brings is worse Q times.
---
Just mentioned the wait times because all that time my delta fan goes bananas and my fkn room surpasses 30+ celsius.... and yes the waiting times are horrendous certain times a day.

The biggest problem is that it takes away counterplay from a killer that already has limited counterplay.
---
I'm on PS4, and it's happened to every single game ever since my first game as GhostFace.
---
True but in my experience, chases with Freddy have always been incredibly fun and eventful. Seeing that little manlet barrel down on you only to get pallet stunned will never get old

---
Thx bby
---
It refers to the hatch as a lock.  You can exit out the hatch when you find it before it opens.  Or you could use it on the hatch EGC after the killer closes it.
---
I agree people say he’s really bad but I personally say he’s top 5.
---
If you dont like it then just ignore it dude. I enjoy seeing these so I wanted to have a go at making my own
---
It lets you open the hatch early or after the killer has  closed it

Do you think survivors should be allowed to do gens? I think the killer should get a free win 100% of the time.
---
What determines if you can teleport to a hag trap? I notice sometime I get the trigger but cant teleport to it. I'm assuming its distance from the trap for now but would like some confirmation or correction.

Why is the wraith in that tier? From all you can read in his lore he is pretty much the most normal one of them all. and Hillbilly overprotective? Guy went apeshit on everything on sight, hard to see him anywhere else but BPW.
---
Oink?
---
Prayer Beads Spirit. Or Scratched Mirror Myers.
---
No yeah, you looped the killer for 5 gens, can't catch you NOED pops and it was your fault. Oh yeah, getting punished for doing well feels so fucking great doesn't it?
---
Its lesson on people in general should follow.
---
Wasn't experiencing this 13 days ago, but yeah
---
The sound has been rigged. It was worse with my new shitty headphones I bought because I couldn't hear a THING.
---
that is correct if youre to far away from a triggered trap you cant teleport to it, the hag does have add ons that increases the teleportation range, she also has an add on that makes it so she cant teleport to traps but in return she gets 115% movement speed and her traps have collision.
---
Oink!
---
Funnily enough 3 of them laughed about it. 1 dc'd and berated me for slugging and said he was reporting me for griefing.
---
Exactly. Adrenaline rewards you for doing your objective and staying alive.
---
NOED rewards you for doing shit.
---
Ahh, crap. I thought it was outside of 50m, not inside. And i hadn't noticed that you have to be outside of the terror radius to see the killer. It all makes so much more sense now. Thank you =)
---
But sir, I only wanted to see some oppai, is that too much to ask?
---
They’ve fixed it now
---
Thank you
---
Once we have dedicated servers, the most toxic babies will not need a reason to leave. They will be banned.
---
I doubt they are even aware that it's coming.
---
Facts. If you ever do play plague, take thanatophobia. It punishes them for not cleansing and in some cases forces them to cleanse
---
I actually wouldn't mind this. I think it's a neat idea.
---
That’s makes it only useful with exhaustion perks tho. I’d keep the status effect reduction but put this in as well
---
A.D.R.E.N.A.L.I.N.E. 
---
It's in the fucking name.
---
I didn't argue over your points that Hag is strong, I argue over your points that she has the best map pressure in the game.
---
Probably the most wholesome thread I’ve been a witness to in the DBD subreddit.
---
*I’m all ears intensifies*
---
Me as well kind person.
---
Why should they?
---
Would you stop doing gens and take a stroll trough the field?
---
That's pretty cool!
---
👊
---
It is entirely possible that a well-timed Dead Hard let the Survivor tank the chainsaw hit.  It is fun when that happens.
---
"With a snap of my fingers, all the hex perks will just be normal perks"
---
That's not a proper comparison.   This game invites some solid toxic behavior, but the gameplay itself is really solid and even the newest of players has a lot of decent moments in a game. Even if all 4 survive, you still got a few hits, spooks, and cool moments out of your game.
---
Dota 2 on the other hand has you play a game where teamwork is essential, yet also makes sure you're best and worst player don't speak the same language as you.  Then you make one or two bad plays and you're playing at a major disadvantage. Eventually you realize that you're not going to win and you're going to have to wait another 35 minutes JUST TO FINISH THE MATCH.
---
Or worse, you play so damn well that you're this unstoppable kill streak god....and still the game makes you wait 40 minutes to properly end it. It's just that kind of game man.
---
What is this pip thing everyone keeps talking about
---
Someone please edit the “to be continued over this”
---
Now I'm feeling old..
---
That was one of my points... so you did. I'm sorry but I don't want to argue here so I'm not continuing this conversation.
---
Mending is not a healing action and is pretty much unaffected by everything in the game
---
Gf: you look around and realize you gave your hiding spot
---
I had game like this when I tried Nurse for the first and last time on console. Never again.

You may already know this, but if you can't find someone to give you one in-game then just make sure you're on around Halloween. They might bring them back again like they did last year.
---
I don't really know the real origin, but it's from some metal gear solid... Something. I heard it when the voice actor for snake recited the line. It's exactly the same, only difference being "guards" in plave ok killer
---
Theres not a single problem with dead hard or DS or BT, same with NOED. They all can be played around. Dead hard only works if there is a pallet or window nearby (and IMO balanced landing is superior), BT and DS are anti tunneling perks, which will be useless against any killer that doesnt tunnel. And NOED can be cleansed before it activates or after, and if you cant deactivate it, accept that someone got rekt by it and leave, dont get greedy against a NOED.
---
But syringes (and ebony moris) are on a new level of bullshit, theres no counterplay to them, but thats just my opinion. Id enjoy the game more if they didnt exist, but oh well.
---
You get a bloody version of a piece of clothing on the character. I recommend using all blood point boosting items before you prestige though so you can level up again so you don’t have to stay at level 1 again with just the characters perks. I recommend prestiging after that because it gives a better chance at better items

I realized that after a few games. And I was just beginning to feel special, lol.
---
Yup, I don't buy or use a Mori outside of a daily because that shit is cheap. It would be the equivalent of a BNP working like it used to or having something that gives it 75% completion. You're cutting the work to sacrifice down to about 33%. It ruins the game for anyone playing, especially with friends, and fucks over your own score. I don't understand why people bother with them.
---
Thanks! I lose survivors easy enough already, so I'm guessing hold off on Spirit until I get better at tracking?
---
thank you!
---
I'm a killer main lmao. I enjoy playing the game and would rather let it go longer and get more BPs than be a dick and kill someone in the first 2 minutes of the game. I'm saying if I come up on a hook save and see the savior, I go for them. If I find the injured person first, sucks for them but I don't miss a chance to get a hit in. Also, tunneling like this usually goes hand in hand with camping around the hook. It's toxic af behavior. You guys must be low rank console players lol.
---
bunny feng!!  and thank you!
---
Ok so I’ll use all them and my blood point items before prestiging
---
Your comment put a smile on my face. Thank you. :)
---
Yeaaa id start with Billy then cus Spirit is all about tracking when ur in that phase mode
---
The survivors won't know what hit em
---
Thank you! I appreciate it :)
---
Lol when u thrill of the hunt for the extra blood points.

I made that second post specifically to prove to a friend that low effort garbage memes are the only thing people care about on this website.
---
Not necessarily. Sure if you play solo and your teammates are dummies then you'll most likely lose against an experienced billy. 
---
But with a solid team that know how to loop properly and can bang out gens in a reasonable pace you can definitely make the killer have to work harder for it.
---
Yeah, I was just running every Bloodpoint gaining perk I had with GhostFace, gotta level him up so I can get that Prestige 2
---
Noted. I'll hold off on her for a bit then.
---
Let them eat cake
---
I would recommend getting Spirit for her perk Spirit Fury if you don’t have that perk cus Enduring + Spirit Fury is busteddd
---
Amanda has her own theme, you know

Genuinely get spooked by Myers every time I play against him. Ghost face on the other hand I can tell he’s in the match when I see a team mate get exposed on the bottom left of the screen lol
---
you've already been surpassed XD

r/woosh
---
Either bbq, ruin, enduring, spirit furry or bbq, ruin, M&amp;A and wispers/nurses calling.
---
this meme is evolving at alarming rates
---
No it really isn't. It's for people who don't have skill enough to win on their own. Lol
---
Yeah, you're  right. Hello Zepp is probably more iconic and well known though
---
Not really an argument but ok.
---
Why aren't you livid at teammates saving you in front of killer without bt? Why aren't you running DS if you dislike it so much?
---
Last time i checked im pretty sure if a survivor was in the dying state and had a key they could still use it on the hatch.
---
Correct me if im wrong though
---
#God which one of you idiots are feeding Michael tier-
---
Thanks for the tips! Appreciate it.
---
no you can hear both across the map
---
Infectious Fright is wonderful for Tier 3 snowballing.
---
Then get spammed with messages that you're camping or tunneling
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Ruin, monitor and abuse, bamboosle, infectious fright/BBC. 
---
Addons is anything that increse stalking rate and dead rabbit. Toombstone is good to but gives you low BP. Pink  Infinate Tier 3 is alsow good.
---
paste this icons folder on the original icons folder (don't delete anything, just paste on top)
---
Wow. This was worthless!
---
When I see people play Spooky bing bong boi, they don’t really go the stealth way. They just think you’re 100% invisible so they can do whatever they want
---
I dont even know why ppl are downvoting the post, toxic survivors deserves toxicity.
---
Yup, I have another character with exactly that build. I usually switch around depending on my mood. :)
---
Only the 278th time I’ve seen this joke
---
the most fuck you perk in the entire game, Frankie D. Only the most heinous players dare use such a piece of shit perk, but, it does work
---
jesus at that point even if you're a tunneller why not just make the hit then continue the chase? i don't play this way but if i did i'd wanna buy as much time as possible, just in case of borrowed time.
---
My point is that you should learn to play injured, and use the perk slot for something better. Like I said in my original post, self care encourages bad habits. When players have it they tend to prioritise healing over doing gens and will take themselves off of objectives every time they're hurt.
---
Holy shit you're right lmao
---
gl and hf!
---
When chasing after survivors, particularly attempting to LOS break you, blink to the spot where the they went behind a wall. Either they'll turn back to attempt to juke in which hit them or they'll keep going and use your second blink to land on them. Doing so cuts off their routes qnd allows you to correct yourself more.
---
Best insta down in the game
---
It’s okay, all the Billys will get me for the next 100 matches.
---
I got fucked over by a nurse who wasn’t doing too god at their match so they camped an open gate, I could find the other one and had 1 hit left, and was final survivor because I was a fraction too late to get past her (another survivor got past her and body blocked me)
---
My experience has either been I'm getting spammed for camping/tunneling or I'm a ggez bb that should probably play a different game.
---
So I'll take the spam/hate mail over the ggez teabagging.
---
Shit, how did I laugh on this? hahahahahaha
---
Shit looks so strange on PC.. I like it
---
Makes sense. I like it. Sometimes though I hold off my second blink expecting the juke so I can hit them, but then I lose my chance to get a longer second blink in case they didn’t and they’ll make it back to the other side.
---
The specific incident I was referring to was in the basement. The killer never even went to any other quadrant of the map the entire game, but he would leave just far enough to stop terror radius and head right back immediately. He would see me and the hook saviour literally body blocking for me and would go around to me and down me again. If you think that is alright, you are a fucking idiot.
---
Oh, and meanwhile gens were popping left and right, so he could have pursued that. Again, I'm a killer main but I don't play like an asshole and bully one survivor even if it means ignoring others and losing the game.
---
out of all of these, Wraith is the only one I cannot stand playing against
---
Thanks that makes much more sense lol
---
Generally, if survivors are dodging the lobby itself, its because the ping looks bad.
---
As funny as running like Shaggy looks, it rather sucks to play in that way.
---
YOU GOTTA PUMP THOSE NUMBERS UP, THOSE ARE ROOKIE NUMBERS👍🏻💪🏽
---
Horizontal ass clap
---
Is he not in line with nurse and billy because his power isn’t used for traveling ?
---
That doesn't always work, sometimes they just get into position so quick you can't do anything but get stunned
---
grow up
---
I hate it when that happens.
---
Wait... I DON’T PLAY SURVIVOR!
---
Legacy skins are the old prestige skins.
---
He probably bought it off eBay. I recently did a "Dead by Daylight": search, and some legacy skins popped up. They were charging like $150 for them, which is hilarious because I read that legacy skins on consoles is bannable.

Constant sound notifications must be annoying, I'd think

No one was sweating and you weren't playing this game so you can't say it's boring...
---
Same

They were PC exclusive though.
---
She throws a tantrum like that because she had the mentality of a six year old, that's when her mother died and she stopped learning.
---
The fuck are you talking about?  Toolboxes are more relevant at higher ranks because every second counts.  High rank games are on a knife's edge generally, where if either side is even remotely inefficient with their time its game over for them.
---
If she got a tan and removed some glass she would...still me dismembered just somewhat a better looking person
---
what does it say without any of the crossed out stuff?
---
I feel ya, buddy. I feel ya.
---
Ara ara
---
Yea I don't bring items 9/10 times because the killer just dodges me assuming it's a "toxic" flashlight, insta-heal, or BNP. When in reality I just wanna do my sabo daily or heal myself without self care a couple times.
---
Is there any chance that there is a version of these where a color corresponds to the perks rarity?
---
*Ara ara intensives*
---
Good, good, feel the anger growing deep within and use that against your enemy’s.
---
They don't have a good track record with doing that successfully. This is the simple, lazy fix they've been looking for.
---
does coulrophobia works with Doctor snaping out? Sometimes the snaping is REALLY long
---
I've gotten the exit gate tea bagging but never any messages about but I do play on Xbox so that might be why. I get plenty of messages bitching about camping as I can see them rush up as I walk away
---
Are you a dying Morrowind orc?
---
UMmmm, can I have some cake bud.
---
God job galaxy brain. You missed the joke thats in the middle of the screen
---
Would you still have posted this if you got a 4k?
---
You can hear Myers tier up though
---
I played in the ‘glory’ days when it was a 20 second CD which recovered whilst running.
---
Unsafe pallets? Never heard of em.

---
Thats why I 6 second swap items, most killers are happy to dodge items in the lobby but most of them wont dodge once its already loading.
---
If u pick it up and u get sucked in. You'll end up like the rest of us, afk training while waiting for lobby's/sitting on the hook.
---
If you mean all 4 kills, (I’m not familiar with the term you’re using), then I guess it wouldn’t be as bad, because it means the skills are balanced, but if it was too easy then, I still would have posted it.
---
Well, a lot people run with it as if it's true so it's pretty hard to pass it off as a joke
---
thank you :D
---
Hey, at least the killer was polite. That, or he was tunneling.
---
Camping is for pussies
---
As you can see 4K is 4K
---
Spirit literally has no mind game half the time though.
---
Im fine playing against a Nurse or a Billy. Billy can still be looped, and Nurse is possibly to mindgame. But a spirit is just annoying. If the spirit has a good headset, your fucked. If you run to a window, she hears you catches up with her super speed and your getting hit while vaulting. If you run to a pallet, or camp it, she can move around most loops in less than a second thanks to her movespeed. The only time spirit is bearable to go against is if you have iron will, but even then footsteps and grass moving is loud as hell and your getting found.
---
The only reason spirit doesn’t look as bad as nurse/billy to most people is because she has way worse slugging/snowball potential which is absolutely necessary against a half competent team. 110% speed, and the power takes ages to charge while you often use it to end the chase.
---
You ever set up a tent to sit somewhere for 3 seconds?
---
If you think you might need the full second blink you can do one of to things: 1 dont charge the blink at all, if they keept on running you take the short fatigue and can start over with 2 new blinks. 2 you can start charging the blink instantly after the first jump and if the survivor is standing ontop of you/close you can aim at the ground and relese the blink. This causes you to not move while blinking and then you can hit them. Hope it helps
---
Love it!
---
Also: when you tunnel a survivor. If you know what I mean.
---
Get your ass outta Ghost Face, Meg.
---
What is your opinion on greedy?
---
It's really not. Pips are the sublevels you need to get to the next rank.   You get 2,1,0, or -1 pip.  Depending on what rank you are, that decides how many pips you need before getting to the next rank. 
---
Your actions in a game give you points for the emblem system.  Get enough in the categories maybe you'll 2 pip, 1 pip, safety pip, or depip.  
---
Reason it's called a pip is because it looks like a pip.

I'm a rank 15 killer and I've been paired with a rank 2 and two rank 6es before. That sucked.
---
Famous last words
---
Hes an m1 killer that doesnt become an m1 killer for 7 seconds after starting his power😂hes not good. Fun maybe but good no
---
I said it is AN objective. There are multiple objectives for both survivor and killer. Sorry if I couldn't really convey what I said in my original comment.
---
Who is the ugliest, opposite of sexy survivor
---
I had a match this morning with all rank 4's, including the killer. LOL! I'm a level 13. Surprisingly I was the only one that survived! Nice little confidence booster.
---
I never get it. Had a game awhile back I got notified someone got pulled off the hook so I hurried back couldn't find one but found the person that was on the hook because of the blood trail so I hooked them again. They saved them again, then I found them right after.
---
Everyone just runs the basic M1 killer try hard build: BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury
---
You have all 4 survivors using only the 3 doctor perks and it has to be a score of merciless killer
---
Very bad.
---
Lmao
---
Ghostface is the absent father
---
Daaaaaaamn!!!! Look at you!!!!!
---

This one was t-bagging in distance and then bumped in a tree

proud hag main and i can't tell you how happy this makes me
---
The colors on the perks and offerings are from two custom icon packs I use.
---
Didnt you get the memo?
---
Ideas on this sub have to be presented in the form of a meme. This community doesnt have the attention span or required literacy to actually read a well thought out post.
---
There we go, thank you.
---
I believe so, yeah.  Billy will often use his saw to patrol gens quickly.  Bubba has little use for his saw before finding survivors.
---
That’s what I been doing over the last few months.
---
Specific incident? You've only been camped once? That's pretty neat. Guessing you're pretty new. Welcome.
---
I don't like getting tunneled either. So I grabbed DS. Most games it does nothing, but I like that it's there and when it works it's beautiful. I don't really care that you're a killer main... It's fucking dumb to count on killers playing by your rules. I don't count on killers making the game fun for me. When I get camped, I just hang out and then go into the next game nbd. Getting salty is usually the desired reaction and it's no one's fault but your own if you get tilted.
---
Oh? Well they are really cool! I don’t think I can do that on Console lol
---
I need this
---
Tried Playing her for the firs time when i was Rank 6,now I'm rank 13 :^)
---
score of merciless killer?
---
It's a perk skin. You can modify the files and change the perk icons. But just how they appear. Nothing else
---
Franshish
---
Judging by this it looks like he would miss it regardless
---
He had to let go of the button that he needs to press to do the skill check, which will auto fail the skill check, but if he doesn’t let go it fails anyway
---
I wanted to grind Ghostface and I guess he's gonna help me grind everyone else now too. XD
---
Xbox here as well.  I guess I should have said messages vs mail ... i refuse to go to the exit gate.
---
I actually had a survivor wait at the exit get after the four person swf claudette group destroyed me until the timer ran out.  The rest of the group escaped with no issue but this dude just hung around the exit and made me wait till the timer was out.  They couldn't just take the win and go they had to make sure they got every last bit of it.
---
Meh.
---
it makes all the survivors instantly DC.
---
Yeah, that's the point. Take the stun and get the pallet down faster so you can destroy it and end chases sooner.
---
Ok I didn't know it was so effective
---
"Hey I found a medical kit!"
---
You need 9 hooks I believe.
---
It's ok Frankie's is what ill be running now
---
Look at this entitled survivor trying to use an item
---
You must love rank 15
---
I like the drawing, but that nurse font...
---
Which killer has the cutest pallet stun sound effect?
---
Yeah two pips, when viewing the emblems (categories of points) of chaser, gatekeeper, malicious, and deviousness, the bar underneath has 3 lines through it, those are pips, the black one gives you no rank up, you have to fill all three pips which is basically a total win on your part.
---
Console has inbuilt screen shot and recording capabilities, the fact you didn’t utilise either makes me think your lying.
---
“Good Luck”
---
[ouch](https://imgur.com/gallery/YYvP4kM)
---
Cute I'll be camping and getting pips as long as the autistic survivors keep trying to save hehe XD
---
If you need to tear down people in the internet who just want to enjoy themselves and use the tools provided by the game so that you can feel any sort of personal validation, you're pathetic.
---
What did I just unleash goddamn it
---
A tip judging from the comments I saw where you mentioned how you handled the situation
---
If he face camps, gen rush. Sometimes you just can’t save someone unless you distract or tense up the killer by doing generators.
---
Fog Whisperers are basically DBD streamers who get picked by BHVR to be in a little program that gives them access to a handful of things like free DLC codes (for giveaways) and info on what's in development.  So essentially they're folks that get to work closer with BHVR and kind of have to put up a better appearance.
---
His power is only useful for facecamping. Anything he can do, Billy does better. Billy could probably facecamp better, it's just easier as bubba.
---
**trapper**
---
*RUN INTO THAT PALLET MUHAHA NOW YA TRAPPED BOI.*
---
whoopsy, Demon Face\*
---
amazing work there budddy :) would you mind updating them since ghost face is out?
---
The Pig bar none.
---
thanks....
---
Yeah exactly so this crying camping bullshit is for rank 15 trash. Learn to play as a team and you can easily fuck the killer
---
Ah ok good advice
---
I agree, but have some theories:
---
1) Lots of players aren't toxic they are new/don't know better/bad at the game.
---
a)Because there are toxic players, when someone does something like unhook a survivor right in front of the killer,   
---
we always assume they're toxic when they might just still be learning (depends on rank obv)
---
2) Most of the people who do play intentionally toxic are literally children.
---
Nicely done.
---
This makes me think I shoukd give Billy another look.
---
Scratched Mirror Daddy Meyers.
---
thank you! and sorry if it’s bad :000
---
I'll remember that but for some reason it's always from a goddamn chest
---
Oh he was I was rank 14 and he was rank 13
---
Yeah, he's a good boi. I use his chainsaw for movement more than killing, just a tip.
---
You can usually tell it’s hag when you start a gen and see the hex: ruin. Still get scared shitless when rescuing others tho.
---
I guess my version was disliked haha
---
There's a reason that exhaustion doesn't recover when running.
---
Let's not go back there.
---
You don't think I know that? Opening up the hatch anytime you want with your key? You seriously don't see how that's not even close to being fair? Really? A FREE escape ??
---
You know one could admire your dedication to trolling, but in the end its just that.
---
I agree with this. Billys don't have to rely on m1, so running them gives more variation to the chase and requires you to be aware of your surroundings rather than run in a straight line to the next loop. 
---
But soloing against a curve master billy is hell, you can only hold out so long...

---
Genius! I wish I was that good as killer. I suck donkey balls! LOL!
---
What if you are the one who gets exposed first?
---
I used to get it on xbox, same thing, so I play as toxic as possible and I do what I wish. I stopped caring about survivors and all their silly rules, I only have one, I'll pay as I want. The thing is we're supposed to play on the most toxic and annoying way possible to slow the game down and counter survivor tactics.
---
I've tried explaining this multiple times bud. You won't be able to.
---
you know what's worse, I also loop the killer and don't let them down me too.
---
Yeah that threw me off too when it changed. It used to be just a quad hook
---
As a survivor main, trust me, it is fucking nerve-shattering
---
I think my issue was four fold:
---
1.  I tried to get all my downs with the chainsaw. 
---
2.  My first two games were Haddonfield followed by the Japanese estate.
---
3.  I had been using the Hag exclusively.   I love her, I do but when it comes to pressuring gens and even chases she's nothing like Billy.
---
4.  I faced some quality swf groups.
---
Those four things put me off to Billy and his chainsaw but I need to rethink how I see him.
---
Please for the love of God tell me you're trolling.
---
Butt dancing, that made me laugh
---
They do, its called "mindgaming." You move faster then survivors, you have a weapon. If survivor is so fucking easy why dont just play them then? 
---
Whenever i hear the "entitled survivor" cliche i think of whiney posts like this. 
---
Just because youre the power role doesnt mean you get a free 4k every game. I swear to god you guys want the map to be a flat open plane and survivors to just drop dead on sight.
---
Did you just call Amanda Peppa the Pig?
---
If you’re one pip away from 13 it’ll show you as that on the final scoreboard.
---
It's the equivalent to the killer Moris. That's not fair either.
---
I felt like making a thing while I was baked  
---
I still like this thing while I am sober, did I do good?
---
Wait really?! Can ya point me to a thread or something I really want to see now .
---
I've seen lots of posts about survivor hit boxes but I've experienced some pallet stuns that make me wonder about killer hit boxes.
---
I just say, "Ah shit, we getting Mori'd boys," then laugh and die. But that's because I'm not a coward. 
---
Anyone who ducks a lobby due to four stacks, items being brought by the survivors, getting downed first, finding out a certain killer is present, or finding out that a killer brought a specific perk or add-on is a coward. Stop wasting everybody's time. It's not Iridescent Heads or NOED or voice chat or toolbox and flashlight comps that are toxic and ruining the game. It's people who disconnect before or especially during matches. Play the game. Lose. Get your bloodpoints. Move on. It's not that hard.
---
Happened to a Meg in my first match as Ghostface. I was crouching literally behind her, stalking, while she was doing a gen. Didn't notice until she was marked.
---
i am satisfied
---
If that scream doesn't condition to not get pallet stunned, idk what will.
---
Wait, what does the bear trap guy have around the map that gives him away?
---
but she already is like top 3....
---
Yeah, The Hag is my 2nd highest level character at the moment. She's fun, but I hate Haddonfield and the Estate the most, only because I'm a Billy main lmao
---
🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
I'd imagine just going around it is faster but alright
---
Do you have an intagram or deaviant art page where I can see it?
---
depends on how you use the power. like https://plays.tv/video/5cf05fa966edc3465e/last-good-outplay-with-freddy-until-rework-deadbydaylight?from=user
---
You know as someone who plays legion a fair bit I can easily say.....
---
This tier list is very accurate.
---
I'd pay money for a killer thunderdome mode
---
This is a meme now
---
when a survivor has a key, or some other rare item, and they realize the killer has franklyn's, they either stop doing any objectives whatsoever, or they do them recklessly, often fucking up and getting killed easily. As a perk... its mediocre at best. But it is a huge dick move to run it, and is very frustrating when you are trying to escape/use something specific
---
That is 100% the skin I saw on him. I play on Xbox One though. They seemed to be on PS4.
---
she’s stupid strong and you don’t need half a brain to be good at her(she’s my fav killer and she’s perfectly balanced no nerf please)
---
Funny pics of his man titties
---
nah it’s just that she’s so broken there’s really nothing you can do against a really experienced nurse lol
---
I was wondering why it seemed like so many people were shitting on Spirit lately. 
---
Probably just butthurt they vaulted into her arms for the fiftieth time this week.
---
Alright
---
I see no toxicity in this pic. If you consider the choice of items, addons and/or perks as toxic, I've got nothing else to say..
---
Bloodpoint is everything fam

The game.

Is that the truth ? I need more so I will search lockers and boxes
---
I agree fully, I was just making the next iteration of the meme. People just keep reposting it with more shit crossed out

yes exactly

Mike has such variety that your build is almost always going to play off the add-ons you are using.
---
Out side of the standard meta M1 perks, try some of the builds below.  The only real consistent perk is Monitor and Abuse, and the rest are replaceable based on your preference.
---
* 1. Jump Scare Myers -  Add-ons: Scratched Mirror, (either lunge add-on or faster stalk walk).  Perks: M&amp;A (monitor and abuse), PWYF (play with your food), Haunted Grounds,  NOED.  Map Offering: Game or Lery's.  You have wallhacks for 32m while stalking and the walls make it very difficult for survivors to see you.  Be patient and cut survivors off.   Smacking them from around a corner and watching their model spin due to the scare is the best.
---
* 2. Murder Mike - Add-ons: ( Judith's Tombstone or Tombstone Piece), Increased Stalking speed.  Perks: M&amp;A, PWYF, Enduring/Spirit Fury.  The add-ons let you mori a survivor in Tier 3.  Stalk until you are one tap away from T3, then tap and murder one.  Usually you can only kill 2 people this way as it takes a lot more stalking to level up, but you can kill 3 of them if you are super efficient.  Pair with a green/pink mori and hook a few first for more WTF murder fun, as they won't expect the insta death.  Enduring/Spirit fury are insane in a chase against a Murder Mike in Tier 3.  Slam the pallet down, it breaks and they are dead just a few seconds later.
---
* 3. Danger Zone:  Add-ons: Pink Hair/Dead Rabbit.   Perks: Distressing, Agitation, Infectious Fright, Iron Maiden.    Get to Tier 3 as fast as you can, because you will have infinite T3, with an absurd terror radius.  Whenever you down someone, you'll get notification of anyone else inside your radius.   And since one of the main defenses against mike is hiding in lockers, they will scream on exiting those as well.  Wins if you can get to T3 by 3 gens, because it flips the script on how mike is usually played.
---
I was a little skeptical but this was the best video I watched in a while. F-ing amazing.
---
But not while in a chase.
---
What is this from
---
It's a pretty frequent topic. Most people are probably just tired of talking about it.
---
Beyond rank 10. You are lucky if you get a single game with a killer not running ruin. And the totem spawns keep changing. I just keep working on it and aim for greats
---
Is there a download to them?
---
Idk about you but sometimes i think legion is a survivor
---
THIS!
---
first time i played huntress, i got stunned and when i heard the lil tantrum, i got really confused and scared

I am confused on what part I got this arousal from.

No. Snapping out of it is no longer considered a healing action

Tell me about it. I was happy being moried then they had to get on the selfie
---
As a killer main I'm actually for survivors having kindred as a free perk, provided it only shows the killer and not each other.
---
Just played a match as a survivor and got camped by Leatherface all the way from first hook to death. He had his chainsaw revved the whole time and I didnt want to use my Deliverance and just waste time for the randoms. The saddest part was the whole time I'm on the hook all they did was sit in the bushes like 30-40 meters out watching. No gens popped, no attempts to lead him off.
---
One actually got crows lol.
---
I only see Ness
---
Oh it's a great iteration. The best IMO. Really cuts the through crap
---
happens to me everytime i play GF
---
Maybe ... but isn't the killer losing the game punishment enough?
---
If the rest of the survivors go do gens then gens get done and the killer risks that.  Don't most face camping killers just not know what they're doing?  So it's really just a person that doesn't know how to be an effective killer wasting their own time.  
---
I get that as a survivor it's not fun, beleive me I'm not that good and I've spent a disproportionate amount of time on a hook.  Still, I go through the cycles and mash A (xbox) for as long as it takes.  My personal satisfaction is knowing the killer just wants me to give up when he starts hitting me.  I love it when I see two or three gens pop while I'm on a hook and he won't leave.  I even pretend to try and get off the hook.
---
Do you think leatherface is B-Tier?
---
I love it. Hope to see more of it
---
Freddy, Doctor, Plague, Legion, and Ghostface's powers can be seen on the UI of the other survivors (ie, if they're sick, deep wounded, exposed, insane, asleep)
---
Only one I disagree with is doctor I know I’m playing against him when I hear Kate destroy my ears from across the map
---
I like to run end game build of adrenaline, balanced landing, Hope and Wake up. Wake up has saved me so much since the end game collapsed and helping unlock door faster

I Dodge mori's if I go against them in a row sorry but going against an ebony mori 3 times in a row is not fun

Freddy is decent
---
can this evolve into a fully redacted board please?
---
Disappointed all you tier makers leave out ghostface
---
Im not asking for reward, if they dc just dont take off my progress. Its ridiculous
---
It'd be tough to balance. Plus they'd have to change the way maps work to accommodate that many players.
---
All we can tell from the image is that the survivors brought some meta perks, and the killer decided to camp a basement out of pettiness. Scores aren't big enough for me to believe many gens were done either, sad.
---
Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Decisive Strike, and Borrowed Time.
---
Spirit boys we out here
---
What was your first reaction to seeing Jane with that big booty?
---
Killers: "but we're being bullied"
---
Quick and quiet/head on is always fun for me.
---
Grasp child firmly
---
You have a valid point, but wasn't dcing the literal strat back when legion was broken?
---
It's 100% fair, and keys are rare. Killers get mori's, survivors get the hatch. And the hatch only spawns for the last survivor, or if the entire team earns it. The game heavily favors the killer, quit being entitled.
---
Aaah nostalgia amiright?
---
Ever since Ghostface was released people haven't been playing much as survivor. I started the game when it was free on the ps4 over a year ago and as a survivor we'd have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to twenty. Now it's almost instant. People just seem to want to play killer more. So unfortunately since there's too many people maining killers you're going to have longer wait times.
---

---
Ever set up a tent to sit somewhere for a 2 minutes? You're willingly staying in one spot for a longer than usual time which is something both survivors and killers can do and the community has decided that  the word "camping" can be used to describe that.
---
Killers also have perks, it was meant as a statement for all players
---
Yeah that’s why I’m thinking one map. Or cut and paste two together?  I’m sounding to simple about it, but a man can dream.  I just want more action.
---
I love Myers' mori, mainly when you use it with tombstone. So cool to give them hope all game and then just kill them one by one.
---
Can’t believe mobile DBD has an exclusive survivor in it
---
If you could alter one game mechanic, what would it be and how would you change it?
---
Have I asked for a 4k? No. But thanks for putting words in my mouth. I don't want ever game to be a 4k, I want this role to properly fucking designed.
---
How about hit rank 1
---
I’d be down for this!
---
Ok buddy
---
*laughs in spine chill*
---
A full course meal.
---
Got moried by a pig today and it is pretty basic.
---
have you heard of identity v? basically dbd but on mobile and they've already added 8v2! personally don't play it much cause my phone sucks 
---
and also cause the only way the hunters (killers) can win against a high tier survivor team is by double camping and teaming, but that's pretty much the entire game. only way to win in higher tiers as hunter is to go against everything you don't like to do in dbd and camp and tunnel to your heart's delight... don't try it please it's a hell hole
---
He should have his own tier “When you’re working on a gen and randomly become exposed”
---
With the new cosmetics it will play for her but with a mix of her theme to separate it
---
Because killers arent EVER toxic right?
---
Oh cool
---
Legion should be at the very bottom
---
idunno if wraith counts without his no bells addon, same goes for trapper without his traps already spawned at start addon
---
Hey, how did you get a screenshot of my PC running this game?
---
I play low ranks and everyone is fairly nice
---
Erm, camping is by definition, a strategy. You can go into a game, plan to camp, and then carry out your plan. Maybe you don’t like it (and I don’t either) but you can’t just say it isn’t a strategy (sometimes a successful one too) at all.
---
/r/whoosh
---
“Cannot sleep. Never sleep again. No sleep. Sleep bad. “
---
Shouldn't these be reversed? Spirit at top and pig at bottom?
---
So, new survivor player, here. How much should I focus on gens aside from unhooking. I can't really believe the answer is to ignore them and go ham on gen repairs. Do you only go for saves when the gen is done?
---
Omg
---
No actually you need to be well within his terror radius to hear the bell. Wraith terror radius = 32 meters bell can be heard for 24 meters. The disadvantages are that although you may not hear the bell if you are within 40 meters of wraith then you can hear a sound of him cloaking. Nor the bell
---
The purpose of camping the hook once the gates are open is to draw more survivors in for the save, slug, and snowball that pressure into more kills. Chasing survivors to the exit gates is just ensuring that they escape.  Putting some bait on a hook and waiting to pounce on the saviors is how you turn a surefire depip into 4K pip-up.

I am not the one who made this, i just thought it was cool and appropriate for our community too
---
That’s why I said usually
---
If only Ashe had the boomstick in game. He should have been a killer, and they could have released killer themed survivor cosmetics
---
"this perk is already paying off!"
---
I hit rank 1 every season. It's not much of an accomplishment anymore.
---
Fair enough.  I fell for a camping bing bong boy three times in a row.  I knew what was coming I just couldn't stop myself.
---
Still it was my fault for not learning after the first hook.  I kept coming back so what else was he going to do?
---
10 generators
---
It really depends on your playstyle as a survivor but on the gen rusher of my team so Jane Romero was a must. Her perk Poised is EVERYTHING!! It has saved me so many timed its unreal.
---
Imagine some big brain meg throwing down all pallets
---
Very happy cake day!!!
---
Before we do this we need a mode where you can do a kill your friends against bots. The only requirement is that the killer is a person then the survivors are bots. But you could also do a black ops 4 style mixed players and bots

Don't worry. Even I wish Pig had a better one.

As a Claudette main I'm OK with that, I didnt need those anyway I'm just hiding near the exit gate waiting for someone to do gens.
---
Unless you're a smart survivor and know how to deal with Doctor, is ability doesn't work against good survivors
---
When hooked on console sometimes you’re controls will become inverted for no reason and you’ll have to go into options and manually turn it on and off again to fix it. Is this a bug? Is it being looked into?
---
So, this happened in todays Pug stream. Pug play this build to be toxic. And one of his own sub Sniped him and said to all of them use insta to counter the way Pug plays, 3 insta actually fucked him and 1 was lost due to frenklyn. Both sides made a lot of force to be toxic
---
Naked Myers 😍

DS? Isnt that lories perk
---
Just imagine other players being immersed as hell &amp; you being on the shit end of the stick being chased by two killers 😂 no looping for you. 🙂
---
Decisive is for tunneling, deliverance is kinda anti camping. But you cant really stop camping.
---
Bruh have you seen Quentin? That dude the thiccest
---
gross
---
Huh
---
....well ironically....I bought both laurie and Adam during the percent of days didnt know they help against camping and tunneling GOOD TO KNOW NOW
---
Yes, it is Laurie’s perk.
---
Face need to be in the center of your screen, your own body can block you from revealing him. Never try to break him out of stealth out in the open. Lean stalk is much faster than normal stalk. Breaking line of sight when possible is always a good idea. Your stalk progress resets if he hits you.
---
And thats still not true, nevertheless.
---
Usually = Under normal conditions, generally.
---
And under normal conditions, generally, [as you can see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ameb0e/1000_games_stats_kill_rate_killer_popularity_and/), hag is not played that much.  
---
Keep in mind that this is a player's experience, since I couldnt find the official one.
---
I can’t hear that last injured dud
---
Np feller
---
You talk a lot of shit for someone who thinks they don't talk a lot of shit.
---
Ok your right we do get Mori so I can understand that argument. That's pretty valid. But the game does not heavily favor the killer in any way if survivors work as a team.
---
Nice job, man!
---
Ah, so you admit you're talking a load of shit. At least we agree on something.
---
Your name makes this post all the more better 😂
---
I found a medkit with a styptic once
---
Why are they even allowed to see items before the game starts? We don’t get to see who the killer is.
---
Bc apparently it wouldn't be fair to killers
---
Shouldn't Hag be at the bottom?
---
Since nobody plays her?
---
Didn't they actually try this once? Thought it turned out to be a disaster.
---
Whispers bbq nurse and ruin/shadowborn
---
They won't be avoiding you if you weren't using a secret offering, so the truth is that y'all suck and need to git gud &lt;3

"Very Nice indeed"
---
For Xbox 1 it’s a different button that inverts our controls. But after being hooked and having controls inverted that button doesn’t work anymore to reverse back the controls which is why I’m confused.
---
Medical kit sounds weird to me
---
Yeah no thanks. The game used to be like this and it wasn't very fun.
---
Killer has Franklin's and someone beats you to both gates, killer facecamps you at EGC while the other 3 leave.
---
What I tend to do is hold me right stick to the right and spin with my left. Makes it faster when spinning.

I lost brain cells reading this. What are you saying? What about this post is Not Safe For Work?

I wouldn't say it is a load of shit. It is more like a minuscule amount after getting piled on by people that hate other people having fun. But sure, let's say we're on the same page.
---
&gt; The game 
---
FTFY
---
I feel as if you are heavily against Survivors and instead, would love to see them get mad / salty becuase they are evil and really toxic, would this assumption be correct?
---
If you’re being tunneled, The idea is that you stall for as long as possible instead of trying to escape, This way it buys time for your fellow survivors because against a good killer the best you can do is stall and take him far away from anyone else.
---
If you’re working on a gen and it’s someone’s first time getting hooked, pretty much act like it didn’t happen besides seeing where killer is for a second. But some survivors love being altruists, so in the end it’s your call.
---
They tried to free me but it didn't let me grab them I didn't lunge or anything
---
I've just started this game today, how do you kill people as the killer?
---
I do believe that Iron Maiden saves you like 10-15 seconds
---
How funny, I don't care what you have to say, either.
---
Borrowed time.
---
20 minutes is fucking horrible. That's about 2 games per HOUR.

Huntress
---
Pick one
---
It's just his connection, plus u can't cheat on PS4 or Xbox.
---
If he's brown ranks he's likely learning the game and doesn't know much better, when I first played the game I camped all the time, not because I wanted to be toxic, but because I really didn't know how to optimize my gameplay. If he's higher ranks, maybe he's not not into looping, as higher ranks will know there's not alot m1 killers can do vs unmindgameable pallets, (in which the game has plenty of) so to save themselves the trouble of going through the Amazon's equivalent of pallets, theyd much rather secure 1 kill to eliviate the annoyance of cocky Survivors thinking theyre hot shit for running around in a circle and pressing a button. Not saying camping is the best thing to do as killer but just think about the number of killers who have played by the Survivors rulebook and still been bm'ed,  genrushed, and teabagged. 
---
FYI I'm not a killer or Survivor main, I've played both sides for a decent amount of time.
---
Legion ends up at the bottem of every tier list no matter what it is comparing
---
"Only have ques with people around your rank" - you playing the same Deathgarden as me? It's a real shit storm of ranks. There is no ranking system by the looks.
---
Yesterday I only played bubba all day and made him prestige
---
I did my first DBD game the other day. Failed 2 skill checks in a row while we 2 manned it. I also was the first to die, because I ended up focusing too much on saving hooked survivors and was really bad at the chase/juking hatchets. I figured I'd wait until everyone got out or died to apologize for missing both of them, and people were surprisingly real nice about it.

You'll get downvoted by survivors but this is 100% true. There's a reason ultimate tryhards always run prestige claudette. Her blood even works like fucking camo and breaks up her sillouette/adds varying texture because it's in big swatches of brownish dull red with little lines as opposed to marks and drops
---
Good question donkey
---
Sounds about right
---
DAMNIT. It’s been like 8 years, dick! Gg
---
I was thinking about it but I just wanted more things in decent tier tbh
---
Beautiful, but It could be Ruin, Unnerving Presence, Distressing and overcharge.Same addons and offering.
---
Swap Legion and Doctor
---
Finally, it has been created
---
Cool cool, I’m glad cause I have bunch of cakes too. Not 87 but still a lot lol
---
First, just know that 360’s are not reliable, no matter how good you are with them. They should be a last ditch effort to not get smacked. 
---
Timing it right is everything, you need to predict their swing and begin to rotate when they’re winding up the attack. 
---
Depending on where your camera is facing you need to decide which way you need to move to avoid the hit. For instance, if the killer is behind me and my camera is behind me I would usually rotate my body to the left and rotate my camera to the right.
---
You just get cosmetics, what's it. I personally don't use them, where are a lot of better cosmetics in a game than bloody ones. 
---
Better spend those 4-5 million bloodpoints or that ever it takes to reach prestige level 3 and get better items. Or level up killers, as they are actually unique unlike survivors.
---
I think he means, BEAUTIFUL.
---
I give this repost of me writing text on an image someone else made 10/10

There's a few but the best one is Scratch Mirror.

It does have a range though, it's just really far.
---
Why are we all arguing with each other?
---
Wraith breaks their spine with a metal axe and trapper lashes them with a Machete. Nurse chokes em for 5 seconds.....boring af too.
---
I mean, it is a strategy.
---
It's just a really bad strategy that only works against overly altruistic morons.
---
As a killer, I consider a pip a win.
---
I like how editing my shitpost is just a thing now.
---
I have been playing just clown for the past month. So it was hard not to lol.
---
Oh, these are the ones that appear on the actionbars down below
---
That's the point. It's just slashing. Which is done in the game. Nurses attack isn't choking which is what makes it so cool and unique
---
Your a legion main arnt your...
---
I feel the timer should only happen when the doors are open. When it comes to last survivor, the timer should only start when there's one door open.
---
Unless you’re the killer, then ruin is found immediately
---
There are 2, Scratched Mirror and Vanity Mirror.  Scratched Mirror sticks you at level 1 and lets you see survivors out to 32 meters while also providing a 200% bloodpoint bonus.  Vanity Mirror sticks you at level 2 with a lowered move speed (either 107 or 108%) and lets you see survivors out to 16 meters while giving you a 150% bloodpoint bonus.  scratched mirror is for jumpscare Myers, Vanity Mirror is for Splinter Cell Myers.
---
More importantly, what happened to your arrow keys?
---
***All rise for the Dead By Daylight national anthem.***
---
Ok makes sense
---
Its a deepfake.
---
If the hatch wasnt so killer sided I would agree.
---
I give all of the first 4 killers passes because they were experimenting with their limitations back then. I just don't understand why Nurse mori is just so well liked I guess.
---
What survivors/perks should I focus on for an altruistic, unhooking build?
---
Solo queuing at its finest. I feel like my neighbors must wonder that the hell I’m always shouting about, since I go out back to smoke and vent to my boyfriend when this shit happens.
---
You are lol that wouldn't even be fair lol think about it. Have you ever seen it or done it? I believe in even one of hybrid pandas videos he was downed on a closed hatch with a key amf couldn't open it
---
k bye 🤡

I've got like 14 of them, but I dont like using them bc you dont get nearly as many points.

They only ever changed chainsaw hits making you drop items, other powers have always worked with it
---
Well since you've been gone a long while, yes they did nerf franklins demise so that a basic m1 hit will make you drop your item. As with back in the day a hatchet, chainsaw and bear trap could cause you to lose your item.

According to OP it apparently is. And I guess having a skillcheck makes it harder?

 **Is there a way to see a clearer overview to know which teachables have been researched without flipping back and forth between characters?** 
---
The bloodweb is so random and sometimes the teachables come up on other characters and sometimes they don't as it stands I have to either: 
---
1.) Memorize the teachables I researched from previous bloodweb unlockings which can become unweildy when you have 3 teachables per person unlocked at random across almost a dozen characters. 
---
2.) look thru multiple characters to see which teachables have traveled across to other characters which is do-able but is a bit of a guessing game and a minor nuisance
---
Curious to know if theres an overview "tech tree" kind of diagram I can see or an easier method to know which ones are researched and which ones are left. 
---
I want to be clear this isn't game breaking just something that would make the time between rounds more enjoyable. Any ideas?

T H I C C was just a warm up for S T I C C

Hilarious

When an injured survivor is bodyblocking the killer to save another injured survivor, and the killer doesn’t even swing at the one doing the blocking, they’re a dick. Straight up.
---
Your cloak makes no noise.
---
God help us all
---
That's what she said
---
I like these lists. Are there more of them?
---
Oh I am ready my friend. I knew what shithole I was jumping into ;)
---
Is camping a legitimate strategy? :D
---
I always assume it's a Hag when I don't hear a terror radius, but also don't hear the tier up sounds for Myers or Wraith's bell. Most of the time I end up being right.
---
No I'm not against survivors at all however I do have an opinion that I believe is true and that is at low ranks the killer has the upper hand yes but at high ranks the survivors have the upper hand with coordinated teamwork and common sense of the game regardless of the killers skill. So when I see a survivor crying about a certain build or killer I play I laugh because I know if they just played survivor correctly as a team you would easily dominate the killer. Sure some killers are playing for fun but others are trying to rank up like me and I love to win.
---
If they do it for stacks all you have to do is let the killer hit you right away so they dont get safe unhook and no stack
---
Tunneling is not good strategy, 2~3 survivors will escape no matter how hard you tunnel.
---
That toxic reveal at the end for the taunt
---
Yep. I dread the start up for games because I always have the thought of that white mask just showing up and grabbing my ass at the front of my mind. But then I hear a chainsaw and I’m happy because billy and bubba are fun to play against for me. I think it’s because they’re easier to counter I guess than doctor.
---
Lithe, Dance with Me, Spine Chill, Adrenaline
---
I get that, I could definitely see a slight increase in the timer or them reverting the change on how long it takes to open the door.
---
What about for dinner? 😈
---
or the new players the toxic people drop to to play with
---
Billy isn't easier to counter than Doctor.
---
Idk if its relevant but some survivors wear the brightest outfits to try to bait the killer into chases.
---
&gt; It's a strategy at low-mid rank
---
as if you need "strategy" in these ranks to completely roll over survivors teams…
---
You can view the unique perks each character has in their profile, and it will have a marked box if that teachable is learned.
---
That looks amazing! What did you use to make the model?
---
Funny how any time there's a complaint from a killer or survivor perspective, some one just haaaaaaas to come along and cry from the other side
---
Well actually, I disagree. Because with billy I feel like he’s more fun to play against because you have to rely on mindgames. And if you run spine chill, you can pull off some pretty neat jukes. Once I was on a gen, then he came up on my ass but I got spine chill so I snuck to a window and hid in the corner of one of those small structures on cold wind. It was pretty fun. Doctors just hard for me to play against
---
Got that once never managed to reproduce it
---
Well at least my boy legion got decent so that’s pretty cool
---
Ahh you let them all go as well too huh :)
---
yea, trust me i pull out nurse when i have to, i dont find her fun but sometimes you have no choice but to go nurse/spirit. im talking about trying out a new killer though where all you have is some basic perks and cant put together a real build. its not good, but it will save you from downranking from those squads until you can get a good setup
---
The only reason BBQ is so awesome is the blood points. It’s still a good perk for the hook aura, but I’d drop it on well over half my killers if it didn’t have the points.
---
Literally any of the obnoxious ugly bright clothes that everyone seems to like for survivors usually mean they're toxic af but also awful. There's the survival pack thing for nea that I see everywhere with the nasty pink bobcut and shit. They'll teabag and click the flashlight but get easily mindgamed every time you find them.
---
Idk but i wear the new adam bead because his glasses ingame look like cheeze
---
I'm new to the game, what's pip?
---
Yeah some people seem to think it's life or death I'd their character is first or not. Good on you for being a good sport
---
103
---
Nice, I see what you did there.
---
I like to use his chainsaw for movement and downing ppl, I usually get really close, so down them gets easier.
---
Outstanding move
---
Face camping is not a good strategy. Staying nearby to prevent a rescue can be very viable in certain situations. Especially if youve downed a survivor nearby since then you can effectively keep 2 players out of the game
---
While the tantrums do check out, she wouldn’t have completely stopped learning and maturing. That’s just not how the human brain works. She’d learn and mature in a more... brutal, less empathetic, lacking some more domestic behavior type of ways but overall she still would be FAR from having the mentality of a six year old.
---
Oh shit I didn't even do that intentionally lol.
---
The claws around the survivor means they are the obsession; when the claws are moving, the obsession is being chased.
---
That means their the killers obsession and if the claws are movimg around it means their being chased
---
You just called the survivors autistic, and I don't see the point in not enjoying a game but still playing it, also camping is still a pretty big oof move, it sucks the fun out of the game for survivors if for almoat the entire match your mashing whatever button it is you have for struggle
---
Well thanks for the motivation,  after dinner I'm give ol Billy another try.
---
It means they’re the obsession.  Some perks, either killer or survivor, revolve around the obsession and their status.  Killer perks usually grant bonuses when you hit or obsession or let them go depending on the perk.
---
yes they do lol
---
Can someone explain what this is?
---
Because it is such a fun map when you have balanced landing and light weight
---
Someone posted the picture of the whiteboard and it said dont flame players that run no one escapes death it discourages new players or sum like that and people started marking out different parts to make it say other things so that's how it started
---
Exactly it doesn’t really matter if your character is first or last it’s just a personal opinion nice to know there’s still people that don’t just assume “your opinion is wrong cause it doesn’t match up with mine”
---
Myers in Tier 1 cannot be detected by perks. Things like Spine Chill, Object of Obsession, Kindred, etc just straight up don’t work against him until he hits Tier 2. Though with Monitor and Abuse your Terror Radius will only be 8 meters when not in a chase, so its definitely strong against him after he tiers up.
---
hell yeah dude
---
Thank you so much \^\^
---
Until this day, I still do.
---
I love bubba/insidious &gt;:) not going to lie, the reactions of some people are hilarous when you catch them off guard, like some times they will just look at me and move left and right  or run in a circle, it all ends with another hooked survivor then the game begins.
---
And?
---
Usually neas with pink hair are very toxic, but actually sucks, can't stand for 30 seconds loop lol
---
So if a killer brought a SPLINTER would you dodge?
---
Who’s your favorite member of the Legion?
---
Not always. Ruin is pretty necessary on a lot of killers so it's fairly commonplace no matter what

Thanks for the warning.

“Killers have never been better”
---
I see people say this all the time. Just because the game has never been better for Killers doesn’t mean the games isn’t still survivor sided as a whole.
---
As they should...
---
I wish it’d take you in and out of the dream world like it originally did

I like it for extra points. I don't really care if I can see auras or not

DCing will never be a strategy. DCing is a method of avoiding the match, for what ever reason (Mori/killer/map/lag/etc)
---
There's no such thing as a DCing strategy, because a strategy is a plan or method for playing. DCing is literally not playing.
---
Meme
---
Fake, real gamers wouldve already ran away with adrenaline so this is fake.
---
Yeah, make a crutch perk even more crutchy in a killer-sides situation.
---
Right? I only played like 2 days of the event and got 50+ cakes on my leatherface. No reason other killers shouldn’t have 500.
---
What if they used the first 15 maps, and each 8v2 “Map” would be the 5 maps in their respective “realm” put together?
---
Y'all are so extra with your perk skins
---
Ok thanks man i want that BBQ T3 👌
---
I’m just about lost my mind over this comment
---
As far as addictive games go, this ones not that bad. They don't actively try to addict you like other games, also no lootboxes of any kind.
---
Oh he's weak, but much stronger than he is given credit for.
---
the number of body blocking groups has plummeted since MoM nerf for me so i gave up on mad grit builds.
---
I always shit myself with Hag
---
Fair enough, but I still think hes the worst. Atleast at high ranks
---
survivors are doing just fine as it is while the killer sees their items before the game starts.
---
Lmao, fuck em up, fam
---
If you mean which ones you've bought initially (for example, whether or not you've unlocked self-care from claudette) those are in a specific order.. They aren't random, it's just a matter of whether or not you actually clicked them.
---
What are the best killer perks in the game?
---
It’s less time consuming to mind game shack than it is to just run around it over and over. If it wasn’t even a little bit time consuming to catch survivors then they’d never be able to escape. As it is now, the time it takes to catch them is dependent on both their skill and your skill.
---
Spirit is 2nd best killer in game but she does have a learning curve, but I'd go with her. She's my main.
---
You first
---
Exactly
---
yes but in the game he is named Mangled
---
No, play the fucking game and quit being a poor sport baby.
---
While mods may exist for stuff like that (and idk if any do, even a screenfix for ultrawide bans you) there are many streamers who were gifted custom skins for their killers and survivors by the devs themselves. Ohmwrecker, Cartoonz, Squirrel, H2ODelirious and that crew were very helpful in getting the game noticed immediately after launch and got all sorts of perks as thanks from the team.
---
If they are all next to it. Yes it is a strategy.
---
cool
---
Is... is that it?
---
And the pitch is different
---
I’ve literally never had this map in a normal rotation it’s only come from offerings don’t know if it’s just my rng but it feels like it is removed somewhat right now so maybe rework?
---
I love when survivors intentionally run into my sight to try and distract me from the wounded survivor I was already chasing.
---
I literally just go around the survivor trying to lure me away and continue chasing the original victim.
---
I'm not stupid. Your buddy was just unhooked, which means hook #2 is gunna be sweet.

I would love to have a Japanese survivor

Yeah... Unlike Bubba who's actually mentally ill and has actual mentality of a six year old, Huntress simply lived by herself in isolation. I really doubt she would survive to adulthood with brain of a child.

Jane and Adam

so true. there are better aura reading/tracking perks than bbq.
---
Always give hatch and allow some gens to be done if you want to avoid double pip
---
I thought the number of campers will decline if i get to high ranks but surprisingly it got worse which mean they still think its a vaild strategy, if only survivors didnt rush the hook and gen rushed instead.
---
For real, I swear to god as a survivor I run around the map 3 times over to try to find totems and as a killer the survivors find it in 20 seconds flat
---
you havent seen my nurse... i have to play 2 games sometimes for those hits XD
---
Totally agree! He has quite a low wow factor (unlike the priestess that gets sick on people) so not very sexy but he is so much fun to play as. It's like playing with rats in a cage. 😄
---
That is really rare though man.  Keys are very uncommon to find in chest midgame.  For me if it happens I just laugh it off because it's kinda funny.  Like you little shits alright gg lol.

---
Good job PilawtCate, you missed the point of the comment that you literally replied to
---
I've been fine with it I've had no problems with the map at all with aura reading and literally safe pallets usually mostly spawn on one side of the map that I've noticed keep in mind the maps obsicals are randomly generated most times
---
Add me faffy0621
---
Yeah I think if he was a voodoo priest or something that wasn’t a clown he’d be much more popular but fear of clowns (forgot how to spell it tbh) really fucks him over since it makes people hesitant to wanna play him
---
Not sure if Feng Min is a DLC character on your platform, but she has some perks you might make use of:
---
Alert will show you if the killer kicks a gen or breaks a pallet. It gives you a good idea where they are, so you know if you can continue working on your gen, or if it is safe to go for that save.
---
Technician reduces the sounds from working on a gen, and also helps prevent the noise from failed skill checks. Helpful if you're trying to hit those hex skill checks when Ruin is active.
---
Lithe is a decent getaway perk, which gives you a burst of speed when vaulting through a window (or over a pallet).
---
I like Kate's Windows of Opportunity perk for planning a getaway, especially if you are unfamiliar with the maps.  It shows you where windows and vaults are so you can make decisions better on where you should run. It can be combined with her perk Dance with Me, which hides yours scratch marks after a vault, but also works well with Feng's perk Lithe. 
---
Even though some of these are chase related perks, if you are confident with your gen skills, you need to be able to make a safe exit when the killer comes by. Planning that escape is key, but perks like Lithe or Dance with me give you a bit of room to improvise as well if you need to.
---
Bubba's power is very underwhelming. Against good survivors at it really will do is allow you is camp them. If you use it expecting survivors to drop pallets but they don't all you did was give them more distance to loop. They can cut corners sharp and your chainsaw will hardly do anything.
---
That red thing is supposed to be a pallet, and the survivors are teabgaging him behind it
---
Butthole: Clinched

only if when in the heartbeat radius

Some sort of flashlight macro glitch I think

Ok, before you say this is a repost, I swear to God I did not see that other one that says "just play the game"! I saw a shitpost that edited this image too, and I got an idea; "just play the game ffs and stop bitching" so I made a it a (bad) meme. 2 minutes later, and I'm just looking at the subreddit and I see this exact same one, but 2 hours before mine and now here I am writing this comment. Have an amazing day. :)
---
Only good for the points.  The aura reading is a nice bonus, but honestly unless you’re nurse or billy the aura reading is limited in effectiveness.  Bitter murmur for example would outclass bbq without the points.
---
Yeah if definitely feels like that.  Should I try another killer?  I was thinking hag seems p cool.  Thanks for the reply friendo
---
Doctor doesn't make you lose the item just once your in tier 3 you just lose the ability to use them
---
i do tbh its one of the reasons i stop playing as hag trapper billy and myers they all are too easy
---
Hard choice between Hag, Spirit, and Plague, but I had to go with my barf babe.
---
Just flick your analog stick in a circle and hope the killers frame rate drops to -10fps.  If they’re playing nurse or doctor it’s extra effective.  Also extra effective on maps with ass performance such as haddonfield and Ormond.  Good luck with your newfound skills.
---
I love playing as Daddy Trapper - he’s so easy especially with an iridescent brick thing and some black tar.
---
First of all, who the fuck you think you talking too like that? Why are you mad? 
---
Second, I’m not playing against a broken ass add on. Spirit is already boring to play against and add in something that completely takes away the only thing you can try and counter her with? Nah I’m good. Enjoy your crutch tho.
---
or spine chill
---
Haha we got this down
---
Spirit and Michael are my favorites. Both of their powers are good too. Michael can snowball really quick with instadowns and Spirit can end chases quivk and stop loops too.
---
It goes against the characters nature. If it was a ghostface or huntress that’d make more sense but since the spirit is bitter you’ve almost beaten her rather than bitter that one of you’ve escaped (or has allowed the ability to escape) it fits better with her childish and feisty nature
---
I like that change.
---
Every second counts (for the killer). Baby survivors from ranks 20-13 are pressured, the rest are not. If youre a survivor who is struggling at ranks 12-, youre just bad. The survival rate at rank 1 is 90% +, yet they still complain. Its a 4v1 with too many crutches and second chances with little time for the killer to kill and no second chances unless you run noed.
---
Gen speed is disgusting and gets easily abused at a high rank. You cannot make mistakes as killer if youre not playing nurse, billy with add ons, and spirit. Have a bad early or map as a m1 killer? Enjoy your 1k-2k lol.
---
Bubba sucks. Get him to 40 for his perks and then play someone else. Though some basic advice is to try to be one step ahead of survivors in a chase. Try to predict where they’ll go and cut them off or funnel them to a dead zone (area with no pallets/loops). If you just follow survivors and do exactly what they do like your playing follow the leader your chases will last forever.
---
That's not a change that's literally how it functions
---
I felt unnerved when Hag popped up
---
I will admit I "tunnel" (chase after the injured person because it just makes more sense) a lot, but if the healthy person stands in front of me I'm not going to ignore them just to be an asshole.
---
Give Killers a reason to hit you instead of the injured Survivor. Most of us aren't jerks; we just play logically.
---
Beautiful
---
I love it!
---
Hey can I have like the full version of the second pic?
---
Pleease
---
Wraith can be heard from across map
---
Oh really? Man I haven’t played him in so long. My bad. Didn’t realize he did that with tier 3
---
Lmao killers definitely do not take any type of skill
---
Definitely - I'd say even if his ability was to drag people by their leg or something. A gas tonic isn't that interesting - funny how it makes for such good gameplay though.
---
Agreed.
---
How? Most of the time the Killer finds a Hook even if he cannot see it's aura.
---
Hmm, it seems our stands have brought us together, I can’t say I’m impressed.
---
It very much isn't survivor-sided anymore man.  Killer is the power role at this point believe it or not unless you're up against a skilled coordinated swf group.  Survivors lost every cheesy uncounterable mechanic they had man.  I honestly believe people that still think this are simply not very strong killers.  I play a ton of both sides and killer feels very enjoyable to me in its present state.  I genuinely don't know what else we could really ask for without sounding super entitled.  Probably getting rid of double pallet spawns which were supposed to have been removed ages ago but aside from that I got nothing.
---
It’s just trying to compensate your load time for the survivors since Killer is hosting the game and obviously has the best ping in most cases
---
Sacrifice them undies to me bro.
---
Honestly I feel so fucking goofy playing as ghostface sometimes.
---
Yeah what’s the splinter cell Myers build? Love me some Sam fisher and mikey boy
---
Yeah, I thought I could count on the totems spawning in corners but nah, they've been in some weird ass spots before. I try to go for them but they need to follow a more rigid logic for spawning.
---
Hag is pretty solid. She doesn't really chase like a nornal killer does and instead relies on traps to cover distance. She can stop loops. Don't try to chase without traps however, she will get looped very easily due to her movement speed. Her height can also screw her on small obstances that she can't even see survivors over but they can see her such as cars in Autohaven maps.
---
I feel the tonic would have made so much more sense for the doctor rather than the clown I would have loved some goofy ass jack in the box traps or something clown related at all
---
Which perk skin is it? it's very pretty.
---
Very good survivors are just gonna loop you when playing as Leatherface and there is very little you can do about it.

Absolutely. Monitor and Abuse is one of the best perks for Myers. While in T1 you have 0 TR outside of a chase.

Obviously they think they should be tier 1 and are just mad killers won’t just sit there and let them launch up don’t worry about it you were respectful and did well gg
---
Feelsbubbaman
---
Im convinced survivors mains have the same iq as room temperature
---
I don’t know what I was expecting
---
What is it that you think Vigil does?
---
Stando
---
Exactly and that's probably the worst map so far. Almost every new tile is just trash, no mindgames at all, basic loops are high enough to hide from hatchets but low enough to see even Freddy or Hag so there are no mindgames possible. The size of this map is also atrocious, absolutely imposible to control unless survivors group up or fck up and 3gen themselves for some reason. This map is hard even for Nurse or Spirit... Worse than Blood Lodge and Thompson's House combined.
---
Yeah figured bubba wasn’t the best.  Glad a got his teachables out of the way first.
---
I'd like to be pedantic and put Freddy Legion &amp; Doctor into a slightly less sneaky tier than Huntress, because seeing a teammate slept/wounded/mad lets you know who you're facing more quickly than being in the Huntress' terror radius. 
---
Otherwise I'm a big fan of this tier list.
---
For me whenever a teammate unhooks me, my controls become inverted and I end up being hooked again because I’m unable to effectively get away from the killer haha. 
---
I pretty sure it’s a bug but I don’t know if it’s being looked into. This is the first I’ve head of it affecting someone else! At first I thought it was some kind of killer perk (I recently just started playing the game after a years absence) ٩( ᐛ )و
---
what’s your favorite realm?
---
You're *sick*
---
Yes but there's a safe pallet literally every 5 meters. Basic b\*tch loop into jungle gym into the new jungle gym into another basic b\*tch loop, all with no mindgames unless survivors are not too smart. Also the map is just too big to control. Huntress on this map is worse than Freddy and Doctor combined.
---
ok that’s actually true though
---
Eh it depends on the killer. Nurse, Hillbilly, and high mobility Spirit and Wraith can really benefit from it. Killers like Hag, Legion, Freddy, Trapper, Ghostface, and Myers don't really benefit from it. Either their power gives auras, finds survivors, they need to set traps, or their stealth worls with Whispers better than BBQ.
---
Yeah, devs are reworking maps and loops cause the game is totally balanced. And you bring up watching hundreds of tru3 videos well guess what? I watch tru3 too and he is by far the most vocal streamer about the game’s imbalance towards survivors. You haven’t really explained why the game is balanced other than “survivors have been nerfed, deal with it”
---
The #1 thing causing the horrible imbalance is the shitty map design. A lot of your success as killer against (skilled) survivors is what map you get and then the RNG tiles that you get. And usually it’s a shit show for killer.
---
A Crutch would be a perk that enables you to win when you really shouldn't have.
---
In this situation, they've beaten you three times over.
---
* They killed your entire team before you could get the gens done.
---
* They found the hatch before you.
---
* They got to you before you opened a gate.
---
Wouldn't call it crutch in  this situation.
---
Dunno I’m on Xbox
---
Heh, me and you both brother.

buying gf actually meant buying Ghostface all along

I'm speaking as a survivor. It's frustrating, sure. But I can take the loss without throwing a fit. I've never seen such a problem with quitting in my nearly 30 years of gaming. It's frustrating for killers and survivors. It makes the whole game a worse experience and the only reason why that would be is because there is a dire problem with poor sportsmanship within this community.

I'm sorry if you felt offended by my tone. I'm not even slightly angry, just sick and tired of people acting shitty and not just normalizing DCing, but actively encouraging what is simply an immature, selfish action.

I'm so confused why this has suddenly become a meme but I'll embrace it.
---
My favourite is where the survivor is between you and the pallet but it still stuns you through them
---
It is ridiculously easy to counter:
---
1. Distortion
---
2. Hide in a locker
---
3. Be in the terror radius
---
4. Hide behind a gen
---
5. Change directions after 5 seconds.
---
Oh.... I'm not the brightest
---
Weirdly enough, Gideon.
---
np, i edited both and they worked out fine
---
1 more game, 1 more cake, 1 more bloodweb.
---
3/10, blacked out all the spaces.
---
 Yea it seems you are right. I think i’ve confused a hatch escape i had done while downed and the hatch was already open.
---
 Thanks for correcting me, have a nice day
---
IIRC, it’s Vanity Mirror, Mirror Shard, Play With Your Food, Bamboozle, Monitor &amp; Abuse, and Make Your Choice.  You can acquire targets through walls and track their movements using the Vanity Mirror and Mirror Shard, sneak up on people with M&amp;A, quickly maneuver through tight spaces and lay traps with Bamboozle, cause panic and confusion with PWYF, and assassinate high value targets with Make Your Choice.  That said I am not a Myers main so I may have gotten a perk wrong.
---
What do you think about the Friday the 13th game?
---
I enjoy playing it from time to time
---
Just got this game yesterday and still learning all the ropes but I would love to play with non randoms.   Getting a replacement mic though so I can't talk right now unfortunately.
---
I'll be on later tonight and add you if you're interested.
---
goshtface takes an entire place just for him,he could be a spirit-like rank
---
What's your favorite Mori and why?
---
For a personal example, no. I had been hooked once, no gens were done, and the other survivor was in the killer’s face. So I wouldn’t even have been dead from being hooked again.
---
That must have made you feel a bit startled lol
---
Your side is so OP man. You don’t know how bad we have it over here 😤
---
Did they? Didn't they give way less?
---
Oh i thought he just needed to be in a centralline from top to bottom.

Sometimes you just gotta combat Iron Maiden Head On

Thank you to u/TwentyNineDays for all the advice on how to transfer my media to my MacBook! Reuploaded it for better quality. :)

I prefer to not be found first in that situation but sometimes I just have take one one for the team. Didn't realize how decent I was at looping til recently though, thanks to watching Puppers,  TrueTalent, Monto and Swag Dracula. Hearing killers miss and then making it to the vault/window is so satisfying.
---
Wouldn't that be amazing? Exploding Jack in the boxes set on timers that injure you when set off. Quite small but can be heard by a small ticking.
---
She's literally one of the top 3 killers
---
I bet you run self care
---
Hug the wall of the loop as tight as possible and do NOT respect pallets. Always swing through them. Being afraid of a piece of wood is what will separate you from being a bad, or decent player and make you a good one:
---
You didn't feel a sudden burning desire to play Hag and turn her character around in the lobby?
---
That’s actually great
---
Along with once it’s timer is fully up the Jack itself pops up and laughs or something along those lines before exploding
---
*WATCH YO PROFANITY*
---
Why do survivors DC during their dying animation while being hooked for the last time? The game will end for them in 3 seconds anyway, but instead they don't get bloodpoints, depip twice, and it gives me a BP bonus and an emblem bonus helping me pip even further.
---
Should killers DC against instaheals?
---
I just got an image of the campfire start screen, and then rendered some clouds on Photoshop. Not an easy job unfortunately.
---
I'm down for a few rounds 
---
My psn is BackwardStab
---
I can’t find it on Tumblr can you provide a link?
---
What side are you talking about? I mostly play survivor. 
---
This survivor main vs killer main mentality is garbage. 
---
DCing from matches is shitty behavior, I don't care which side it is. 
---
And when one 'side' has a complaint about something, it really doesn't mean that the 'other side' should feel obligated to toss out other unrelated complaints as a means of insulting and downplaying the initial complaint.
---
[source](https://youtu.be/ZKfjSLvYDMg)
---
Got so many cakes but I'm scared to use them because survivors would DC even if you brought a 500% bonus bloodpoint offering.
---
Dodging is usually a killer issue...

Devs will always look to improve the games balance.  That doesn't mean it's terrible because it isn't.  I don't agree with everything True says.  He also has to deal with stream snipers which is an unfair cheat essentially against him.  He has become jaded as of late similar to Tydetyme and is just burnt out playing a game he is forced to play constantly to maintain his viewers support.
---
I main the weakest killers in game with brown and yellow addons, no noed crutch and consistently win my games.  I lose some but win a hell of a lot more.  I main Freddy, Trapper, Wraith and Legion (post rework of course fuck the no skill cheese fest he used to be).  
---
I've been playing for years and this game is a joke for killer compared to how it was.  They lost the pallet vacuum, brand new parts, flashlight addons, buffed killer pickup animation, removed the ability to recover exhaustion midchase, they reworked window spawns, removed pallets, buffed Ruin, buffed Noed (yuck), reworked decisive from cancer to a perfectly balanced perk that only gets triggered against babykillers who camp and tunnel OR the occasional unfortunate end game open exit gate hook, they nerfed MoM out of the game, they gave us EGC!  No more hatch standoffs.  Just find it close it and collect your zero effort gimme 4K by downing the last survivor at the handle they don't have enough time to open.  
---
You seriously need to practice your killer play man because it just isn't remotely as rough as you're depicting.
---
Me and my party are also getting this
---
Aww you're welcome! Love this clip, it's like the ending to a horror movie where the blonde one doesn't die first

Unless it’s Ochido, but I guess he’s pretty much a man child.
---
Yep
---
Glad to see it’s not only me
---

---
That’s super weird.... hopefully this one stays up though. If it’s not just an issue with my Xbox, it needs to be noticed/addressed.
---
Holly crap that is amazing!
---
Shadow buff to shadpwborn?
---
I never said it was balanced haha. Yeah no entiti vlocker and no bloodlust. You could infinite shack. Hell you could even infinite a Z wall,because of that. And permanent fast vault.
---
I'm gonna hide here because I think the only perk that needed the exhaustion nerf was SB..
---
Yea it’s in the killer shack
---
Every time I'm on a map that has buildings with multiple floors, I always happen to look over and see someone hauling ass out of a window or off of a ledge, followed by the killer doing the same. Neither character models follow "fall" physics though, so it always looks beyond hysterical... *especially* Myers. Lmao.
---
If you can loop proficiently, go with 2. If not, go with 3
---
Too awesome!!
---
i dont know if this is on my end, but i feel like this video was supposed to be viewable but for some reason isn't
---
**imgflip.com**
---
I forgot about that one for some reason and yes, it's probably one of the stronger options due to consistency. Also the lithe/dance with me/quick and quiet combo can lose killers completely if used right.
---
The best advice I can offer is to not charge up the chainsaw until you're right behind the person you're trying to chainsaw until you start to get a better feel for how the saw works when going through windows and pallets, that is the best way to get ez chainsaws. Good luck
---
Myers should have his own tier called choke me daddy
---
You still haven’t said how the game is balanced. You haven’t defended the shit map design, loops with no mind games where you just have to follow the survivor til they drop a pallet on your head, Haddonfield, Ormond, Preschool, etc, Ironworks window, Grim Pantry building, Disturbed Ward building, etc, Ruin being damn near required at Rank 1, list goes on. All you say is “survivors have already been nerfed so stop complaining”. Survivors can get nerfed all they want. It doesn’t matter until they fix the shitty maps (which they are). And not sure why you get to use tru3 as an example but when I say tru3 is the most vocal streamer about horrible game balance suddenly he’s just burnt out from playing the game.
---
Watching a t-posing Myers down someone as they both fall to the ground is certainly an experience.
---
Isn't that assuming you can hit greats with any kind of frequency?
---
Indeed!
---
Uhhhh, let's not do that because it would be a cool option but it would further increase the amount of mindgames she has and my heart can only take so much.
---
Most likely the storm then. Power is on and off everywhere
---
No. No one should DC. I play survivor and killer about 50/50 and I feel like DCing is a huge display of poor sportsmanship. Period. 
---
We'd all have a better experience if people learned what goof sportsmanship is. DCing, BM from bother winners and losers, toxic chat/messages. A lot of people within this community frankly need to grow up. They're making the game worse. Period.
---
When the game first launched, yes. But like a year and a half ago or so, they updated them to give an insane amount of bloodpoints, then nerfed it back down after a few months
---
Hmm that’s odd. Is Ohio really the closest data center to me? That explains the ping some games haha
---
YOU CAN LITERALLY HEAR THE END OF THE TIMER
---
You're right. So, I have no idea lol
---
I used a thin tree to hide from a huntress earlier today. She walked around twice almost close enough to touch. I messaged the guy and asked why he didnt hear me and he said he was listening to music.
---
I'm flabbergasted at how people think sound isnt as important as it is
---
You can climb on something next to the pallet any way so when you drop the pallet it acts as a bridge to the next object. A huntress showed my friends and I this trick a week or so ago and we all spent way too long running over it until we died to the ECG :D
---
This is such shit. God forbid a Nurse play to win.
---
Yeah I just bought the Osseous Carcass one for Billy and that's it for me

---
I love them both. The mind game potential with Spirit can't even be rivaled by any other killer's in my opinion. Fun and powerful in the right hands
---
This is one of the reasons I am a killer main. I hate dealing with killer's bullshit. I have found that there are actually a lot more toxic killers than survivors. At least in my experience.
---
hands actually i need a couple of those xd

Where the fuck is my Billy

It also speeds up your actions while also making you last longer in bed and growing an extra 2 inchs onto your already massive cock.
---
Quick and Quiet, Dance with Me, Poised(Obviously), and something of your choice.

Shorten it down in the future, way too much context
---
A docs power is heard across the map too.
---
Has this one been edited yet? Seems like a good idea
---
It might be worth it to buy an English dictionary first, might help with your grammar
---
Dude I shit you not last night 3 games in a row
---
I buy every DLC but I have gotten the most use out of Spirit and Michael.
---
i don't know how to talk in english is my second language sorry for my grammar
---
I got camped my fist day as a survivor 😢
---
As a spirit main as killer (and blendette as survivor obv), I can agree with this
---
I'm a big brain survivor main who doesn't understand the difference between a lobby dodge and a disconnect. 🤪🤡
---
i love michael and make jumpscares xd
---
 thanks
---
That too, I don't really take advantage of it too much as I want to get away, but it has saved my life sometimes
---
Yeah. I want to get the pallet based perks so that he is actually good at chases with the jumpscare build.
---
try to avoid sprinting around if you are doing that.  sprinting leaves scratch marks while "rushed" actions (aka things done while sprinting like vaulting windows and slamming pallets) will make noise.
---
try using spine chill or premonition to give you a heads-up of when the killer is near you.  bond and empathy are also excellent information perks
---
furthermore, since Ghost Face is the most played killer currently, don't be afraid to avoid doing a generator immediately when you spawn in and just scout around a bit
---
My favorite is Putin
---
Really? I’ve never seen that in the patch notes or any updates?
---
Idk why you are getting downvoted I'm wondering too
---
Very good ! Thanks for Sharing !
---
Damn, that's an interesting coincidence.
---
I dunno if this is more suited for tech support but lately in like 1/5th of my games everyone is disconnecting and at first I thought it was rage quitters but now I'm not sure. It's not usually back to back games and other online games work fine. One time was really early (first chase) and so I got suspicious. It has one person stopping and disconnecting and then the others play for maybe 20 seconds more and then it pops up with all 3 disconnecting at once. Is this my internet or am I just getting coincidental quitters? I don't want to get reported when I'm not doing anything wrong. It doesn't say I have no connection when it ends, it takes me to the end game screen with the quitter bonus and all that. Any idea if it is my internet messing it up somehow? I'm on Xbox if that matters
---
I use Poised, Lithe, Dance with Me, and Quick &amp; Quiet.
---
Ummm dude, I didn't even play DBD last night lol.  Are you a lying attention whore or are you responding to the wrong comment?
---
Ah, I see, I see
---
Yes, but the dedicated servers aren't being used right now.
---
Junk-o makes some pretty swell pins, I have a few of theirs. Very nice.

Unless for every five seconds of work you get a skill check, and you can't hit any great skill checks whatsoever, you're still making progress on the gen.

Definitely my second favourite hatchet wielding Russian

The final one is just toxic Game
---
No she had little girls for a bit

You're still one hook further along.
---
ohhhh thats cool af
---
Hag and Spirit are the only ones that still scare me. And occasionally Myers and GF. 
---
Hag is all around a good time. It's especially funny when she misses a hit and her claws whack a wall or a garbage can. This is hilarious to me for some reason. I had a blast playing her for the first time too. I spent the whole match laughing cause I had no clue how to use her and of course I put like 5 traps in the same place so when they got tripped I teleported and saw myself standing there already. Completely confused. Got 0 kills and 1 DC cause I think my traps annoyed them.
---
Spirit can get some great scares in with her prayer beads and that thing that makes her passive phase really crazy looking. She flew at me on a gen once and there was like 5 of her and I didn't hear her coming til she was slashing me. I honestly respect a properly used add on. No need to DC since they earned it with bp and used it correctly.
---
Could be nice and not OP.
---
In the store under characters, you should be able to click on a killer or survivor and then hover over their teachables and it will say "unlocked.  will appear in bloodwebs" or something.  Or if you are just at character select screens when you click Play as Survivor or Play as Killer
---
English is clearly not his first language kind of like how douche is your second
---
fuck
---
Try leaning more to stalk. I have no issue with detection as GF because I NEVER walk and stalk, that's for Myers, and if you start to hear the music while leaning, no big deal, just hide, they retain their stalk progress. He's meant for ambushing, that's his power. Not chase. Now if you can enter nightshroud while at a loop you can mind game well, since he basically has built in beast of prey perk. That's the furthest extent you can use his ability in chase. Before complaining, try learning how you should play him first.
---
So what are you waiting for?
---
This must be for PC 
---
I barely come across good nurses on ps4
---
Its a huge problem they are trying to fix. They are switching to dedicated servers soon(ish) so it might not be as bad. Its mostly the matching player levels thats slowing it down i think because they have been shit recently too. Give them time, the game is blowing up way more then they thought it would and the system cant really handle it i dont think
---
Yea, last night it took about 30 min for me to get a game as the plague 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I play on PS4 as well, I just made a tier list for the broader audience
---
very much soo if you get the whole package ds is worth it alone amd daddy myers is a Easy way to get blood points since at teir 3 hes one shot every one
---
aye bloody shape bros
---
or do both and get 4 irridescent emblems from being a good and fair killer
---
I only really started playing last weekend and I had to buy Myers as Halloween is by far my favorite horror franchise.  Even with all of the downs and reimaginings.  So I'll say he's a must and Laurie is fun to play as well.  I wish she had a hat option in the store but I'm going through a hat phase where I want all of the survivors to be wearing one.  
---
Myers is so fun to play as!  
---
Scream would be my second favorite franchise and if Ghostface ever goes on sale, I'll have to snatch him up too.
---
Lol nice metal gear crawling there.
---
Though if that killer had headphones he would be able to hear you...
---
dude legion is just another M1 low tier killer in red ranks.
---
My problem is that I don't get to use lean because they break me out of my ability way too easily. Even if I hide after I realize that they are seeing me I still get spotted.
---
ofc lets butch one of the 2 viable killers at red ranks
---
And that’s why Spirit is the queen of mind games
---
Imagine lerys as killer without being able to vault
---
Spirit is by far my favorite killer to play as, super fun. Hag has great perks and is also very strong. Both are a hell yes
---
Yeah but to be fair you shouldn't be standing in shroud and should lean around corners more instead of stalking in plain sight
---
\&gt; If you run to a pallet, or camp it, she can move around most loops in less than a second thanks to her movespeed  
---
that is literally a mind game
---
She's an emotional lady
---
Just like enduring+spirit fury? Why is having a strong combo a problem? I also don't think many people would sacrifice a perk slot for a second chance of using exhaustion. And let's not forget about exhaustion add ons.
---
Lol okay I'm responding again before deleting my dumbass response because I totally misread what you said.  I thought you said you shit on me 3 games in a row like we played against each other or something lol.  I'm an idiot carry on.  That is terrible luck though man lol.  3 keys back to back in chests.  Watch for the last second item switch to a key in the final second of the lobby.  Toxic survivors pull that and they're hard to notice if you aren't paying attention.
---
I put off buying Hag for like a year and I've actually enjoyed playing her a lot, and now Ruin is like the icing on the cake. She's worth it.
---
I'm trying to push for rank 1(for achievement) and oh my god how people tryhard so bad here.When I reach 1,never again I'm going above 7.
---
I’m always so proud of the Bubbas who don’t camp. Like, you might not get any kills but you’re redeeming yourself, to me.
---
I think he's fun to play as and has decent snowball potential considering when fully tiered up you have 60 seconds (or more if you use certain addons) of one-hit-downs. Decent build variety (Huge terror radius with Infectious Fright so you can go from survivor to survivor instadowning them) and his addons allow different playstyles (Tombstone for insta-mori, mirrors for jumpscares and good wallhacks, etc.)
---
If you get him try to get Monitor and Abuse from the shrine if it shows up anytime soon or get Doctor and get him to level 35. Monitor and Abuse reduces your terror radius by 8 meters not in a chase, (and gives you 8 extra meters above default terror radius in a chase) and also improves your FOV.
---
M&amp;A means Myers has zero terror radius when not in a chase (Survivors can walk right up to you and not hear a heartbeat even if physically touching you) in Tier 1 which is tons of fun on Lery's with scratched mirror because you can hide around corners or yank people off generators. In tier 2 your terror radius is only 8 meters with M&amp;A which is still extremely small.
---
thanks
---
This would be better than the old DS for good survivors. This would be as good as a non-totem Devour Hope
---
Why the hell is 70% of games someone who will camp hooked survivors? 
---
There is literally no fun in playing with people like this
---
Are you literally trying to justify the awful killer abusing a glitch with survivor perks and SWF.
---
I main Nea and use the neon cosmetics and neon hair. I don’t care if I get caught, and I’m used to dying because I’m a potato. I’m not toxic. I don’t click the flashlight, I don’t teabag and I don’t make
---
as much sound as possible so you’ll watch me leave. I don’t even use instaheal med kits or DS. However, if you come across a huntress with the boar head or nurse with pumpkin head, prepare to be face camped and remember to break those totems because they always have noed.
---
Thanks a lot. I usually try to avoid rushed actions until I need them. I've really only been playing Jake, so switching survivors and trying new perks may help as well. 
---
 One more quick question, if I spawn with other survivors, is it better to stick together or split up?
---
btw spirit is good making jumpscares?
---
I almost never hard camp but as Nurse I’ll usually wait somewhere nearby, then blink to get a free hit or down
---
You don't approach generators properly, or crouch enough then, make sure the line of sight to the gen you're pursuing is always obstructed. A good way to gauge this is to make sure you see it's aura entirely when approaching. Also try going around the edges of the map if premature detection is an issue. Survivors are looking towards the middle just about always. And when stalking also try to stalk while leaning out of the furthest of two walls or obstacles between you and the survivor. Don't get too close, I found GF very effective at medium range.
---
I totally misread this as "off" and then I noticed the comma and it all became better.
---
Hmmm sounds interesting. Will try to play even more ambush oriented then.
---
Epic gamer moment #38
---
There are addons for this. Drivers License and Victims Detailed Routine make it to where they need to be closer to you to expose.
---
Then I recommend you to find a way to use keyboard and mouse on console, I'm totally sure there are ways to do that
---
The reason i called it "literal strat" was because of the rampant dc's. It was somthing a lot of people seemed In agreement to do, so it could technically be considered a "strat".
---
OhTofu has a really good Billy guide on youtube that I recommend watching. Watching and emulating streamers/youtubers who are good at Billy is a good thing to do. A great start is remapping the chainsaw turn to Q and E.
---
Pantless Myers pls
---
Normally if you can hear a saw start up early in the match it's normally Billy running around do see survivors.
---
Leather has no reason to do that.
---
That's why I like playing as the spirit.
---
I really like this design. It's cool that you mix-matched some of her cosmetics too! I'd love it if you'd do more. Cheers &lt;3
---
I JUST REALIZED HIS THUMB HAS AN ENTIRE HAND ON IT. The Entity truly tortures its Killers...
---
Thats my pet perk. Never leave the fog without it.
---
Watching till the end was totally worth the wait, holy shit.
---
You are saying that like a 2k is a loss.  2k is a draw, and what balance dictates means was an even match.  1k is a faint survivor win, all escape is full survivor win, 3k is killer heavy win (generally only meaning a hatch escape was the ending) and 4k is killer hard dominating.
---
Yeah, I'd have included that if it didn't just stop right there :/
---
Man i had a genuine laghter seeing this, gz in this masterpiece!
---
Gotta try that build.
---
That would just make his kind weaker though and I seriously doubt survivors would have a problem with that?
---
I like to use it as as a "you think you were gonna take that key/ map/ toolbox/ medkit with you but you were a little bitch and thought it would be funny to teabag, now its on the ground" perk
---
I cracked up laughing the first time I ever saw him do that lean. I can't take ghostface seriously as a killer.
---
It’s both hilarious and sad that this has become a meme
---
Fair enough, it was certainly a common occurrence to the point of feeling like I had more games with at least 1 DC than none
---
Playing to win is not the same as abusing an overpowered character to feel like you are good at the game.
---
Imagine not knowing you can throw pallets down early.
---
Such a rewarding moment as a survivor.
---
Spine Chill tells you that they're looking at you - it lights up when they are and turns off when they aren't. Premonition tells you that you're looking at them - it makes a ping sound when your camera goes their direction, but it has a cool down.
---
face of joy 7u7
---
I agree with this. I bought the game yesterday and only teabag to be friendly and not to be toxic.
---
Yeah I get that but at red ranks where I'm usually at it doesn't always work and most killers are pretty smart... Also keeping at least Adrenaline and Borrowed Time on is more important to me and not worth sacrificing perk space for
---
Getting fundamentally better at looping and being able to consistently buy your team time to do objectives is better than the possibility that you might lose the killer imo (and that's only if your deceptions work)
---
*Spawns on Haddonfield. Michael Myers music plays.
---
‘Oh ok, it’s just the map.’
---
*The Music plays again 10 seconds later.*
---
‘Goddamn it.’
---
I agree. People complain but NOED also works when you shut hatch. 
---
Maybe Cypress Mori should just become baseline? I dunno how well it'd mesh with lore (Entity wants *sacrifice*) but it'd make Mori dailies less of a pain and it'd be a nice reward for doing well.
---
I run NOED because if all the survivors I face use top-tier perks, why shouldn't I?
---
You say you don’t mean to be crabby but you say that I’m throwing a fit? Based on your tone I thought you were trying to be slick... clearly you had a problem with what I said and trying to play victim. I’m not saying I should DC against every little thing like all of y’all assumed. The only thing I ever DC’d against was spirit with that add-on because she’s so braindead to play and a death sentence to play against. I could careless about who DCs in my game, as long as it’s not a ragequit because of salty ness from getting downed in 5 seconds in a chase. 
---
There’s some things in this game not worth playing against(I.e 4 insta-heals, broken add-ons, etc.) and until the devs fix this issue than I won’t feel bad refusing to play against them. It’s also funny that you had to point out that you’re a survivor for whatever reason... and I can tell you think I’m one because you had to insert that irrelevant information. Anyway, I still haven’t been banned for DCing because don’t do it as much. But continue downvoting me like you know my play style.
---
Yup. If you decide to camp without knowing if they're overly altruistic, it's a huge gamble. Sometimes it pays off, most of the time it does not.
---
If your complaining about rank matchmaking. you’re bad.
---
I just recently got the purge &amp; when I play against her she can down me with the throw up is that a add on or is that when she ingest the purge
---
Who do you want to use more, killer or survivor
---
Both can be in there own way :)
---
Yeah I’m fine with with a group of 2 or even 2 separate groups of 2 but 4? Yeah no fuck that every game I played with a 4 SWF has been super stressful and toxic as fuck I’ll dodge that every time. People can downvote me or call me shit all they want but at the end of the day I want to enjoy my time with the game instead of getting t-bagged and being called trash cause 4 people had the advantage of communicating what I was doing.
---
I believe so yes
---
perfection
---
You’re*, and, notice how they all escaped except for the lower rank one?
---
yes
---
Someone claimed Executive privilege
---
Right? And with the dark traps, it can be pretty OP, especially under windows and in grass.
---
In all fairness I've ran into a instaheal in just about every game for the past 3 weeks.  Started bringing Franklins whenever I see a medium because of how often I see the instaheals

Spirit fury alone is a amazing perk on alot of other killers (when paired with enduring) ruins good for killers who need to "setup" at the start of match
---
Doc should also fall under the second tier imo. Even if *you* don't find Doc early, you can see madness tier 1 on your teammates to know that its Doctor.
---
There’s to many variables that make every mindgame heavily sided with the spirit.
---
Is she faking her power?
---
Is her power up/How much time does she have on her phase?
---
Can she hear you/See moving grass?
---
Is she running power duration addons? Activation speed? Movement speed? Charge speed? (these are all basically impossible to detect, except maybe charge speed)
---
When you drop a pallet against a phasing spirit, you need to hope she’s literally running through it at that moment or your fucked. You need to hope she’s not faking it, hope she has little time left on her power, hope she doesn’t have much phasing move speed, hope she doesn’t have a pair of ears, hope for no grass around the pallet...
---
It’s too much to hope for. Chances are your getting hit.
---
Killers can do whatever they want to. But if they play grimey then I’m not gonna stick around.
---
This was just made with stuff I had around my craft room, so it’s not completely accurate! If I make a proper cosplay of her then I’ll definitely get a different wig. The necklace isn’t accurate at all either oof. Thanks for your input tho!!
---
Don't forget, all sprint perks had seperate cooldowns. Exhaustion not being a thing sure was fun.
---
Why is she so smol
---
like the hag mentioned before
---
Big brain leather boye pulling off next level strats to fool survivors into thinking he’s billy!
---
Ok this isn't a question, I just wanna say this thread is fucking hilarious😂
---
A survivor’s main goal during a chase should be to waste as much time as possible using as few resources as possible. Especially as you face better and better killers, you’ll find that they’ll lose you less and less. Your best chance of escaping is convincing them that you’ll take so much time to catch, they go after someone else. If they keep after you, giving teammates time to do gens is the goal. 
---
I don’t know how familiar you are with the concept of “looping” at pallets, but that involves running in a “loop” around a pallet for as long as possible before putting it down, using the terrain and other “renewable” resources, like windows and LOS blockers to extend the chase. Someone who does this well is TrU3Talent on YouTube and Twitch. I highly recommend looking him up, as he uploads very frequently and does a great job of explaining what he’s doing in game.
---
As for killer, the POV is honestly one of the things that takes the longest to get used too. It’ll come with time, you’ll lose fewer survivors in a chase as you get better, especially as you get better at predicting movements and following tracks/blood splatter. My only advice would be to stay away from enabling perks like NOED (no one escapes death) that allow for easy downs. It’s hard, but the best way to learn is to slug it out. Sound is very important in this game. If you have a headset, listen for footsteps, breathing, and grunts of pain. If you’ve really lost someone, start to patrol gens again. Walk by and see if you can hear them being worked on. They have to go to them eventually!
---
Damn big brain pro Wraith player right there

Also wouldn't work due to Leather sounding like he's Beat boxing/remixing with the chainsaw
---
Can we see the untextured version? It still looks too cartoony even though the knife now seems more 3d

Oh, I like this. I like this a lot
---
I'd stalk you till I got tier 3.
---
I think Ruin is the worst perk to identify a killer from because literally everyone runs it. Like, even in low ranks where most killers have only their own perks, everyone who can still runs Ruin.
---
really cool! where'd you get it? Or did you make it?
---
Everyone is nice until green ranks
---
What about ghost face :)?
---
Omg... Pumpkin Nurse, totally true. :O
---
Also seems like anyone who uses Frosty Eyes is likely to camp or tunnel.
---
That's fucking _toxic_ dude
---
thanks but it looks like hes for pros and im a total noob
---
This map makes me want to scream
---
Awe you gonna make me Dead Hard :P
---
Lmao as a killer main who isn't afraid of flashlights I approve
---
Late post but I kept thinking about this and I realized what is probably happening.
---
If the killer has Sloppy Butcher (Probably the most likely reason people are getting mangled), everyone he hits with M1 (And certain abilities like chainsaws, huntress hatchets, etc.) get mangled and hemorrhage. Obviously if he's running SB EVERYONE he hits will be mangled, so no wonder why you being mangled seems to slow healing on other people, they're probably mangled too.
---
you say that like its a bad thing
---
Yeppp! Scare the shit outta people lolol shes horrible to go against cause again shes a very strong killer and east to learn. I suck as killer so i need all the help i can get :)
---
Yes, but the killer will probably find you some time in the next three minutes and the gen will never be completed.
---
Wraith passive bloodhound was turned into an addon IIRC.
---
It's kinda easy to get a 4k against most of those
---
Where Ghosty Boi???
---
Well it just isn't in their game ToS saying you can't because they never thought it would either get big or they just want everyone to have freedom with their account which I can respect plus people only sell the codes which are generally cheapish well mostly or their legacy which in my opinion is just a flashy cosmetic that people like to show off which why it's so expensive but yeah here's the reasoning on why they allow it
---
You need to shift your killer mentality in order to be maximally effective. The shift is from specifically trying to hook and kill survivors to focusing on pressuring survivors and keeping them off the generators. You feel like you're losing if you arent progressing your OWN win condition, but you need to think of it in terms of you are NOT losing if the survivors are not progressing THEIR win condition. The longer the game goes the better your chances are. 
---
A simple example of this would be a situation where a killer comes across two survivors at the start of the game who are both repairing the same generator. The newer killer will chase the survivors off the gen and then focus on one, downing and hooking them after a chase. During this time the other survivor has gone back to that gen and likely is finished with it, and the other two survivors are god-knows-where probably plying away at other gens. As a consequence of this the killer has now almost traded two generators for hooking a single survivor. 
---
The correct approach to this situation is simply to chase the survivors off the gen, ideally injuring one or both, then let them run away and bash the generator. Now they are losing progress on that gen and you have pressured those two players into relocating, wasting time healing, etc. After the generator is bashed you can immediately patrol to other generators and do the same. Other survivors may think you are still chasing the injured survivor and let their guard down. 
---
A big part of this is that new killers are afraid that if they let someone go they will not be able to find them again. In order to succeed you need to move past that fear and grow more confident in your hunt. Areas of the map that dont have generators are not actually relevant to you.
---
Is truth
---
Next time try  Jane cosplay and show me how you cleanse a totem.
---
People seem to forget, old Exhaustion recovered while running. 
---
Vigil HASN'T changed since then. Tier 3 Exhaustion perks have a 40 second cooldown. Meaning a tier 3 Vigil allows for a 32 second Exhaustion cooldown. 
---
This is still the case. The only difference is that the old Exhaustion recovered while running. 
---
If Vigil were changed to OP's idea, we'd have an 80 second Exhaustion cooldown while running. While this still isn't balanced, don't *EVER* compare that to original Exhaustion. It wouldn't even be close.
---
A 32 second chase for Sprint Burst to come back up. That's the tier 3 Sprint Burst/Vigil combo from back in the day.
---
OP's idea would be an 80 second chase for Sprint Burst to come back up. Same tier 3 Sprint Burst/Vigil. But a 48 second difference from the original.
---
Every time I talk about this you end up providing more information lmao
---
E=mc2
---
freddy in the back tho
---
Go gens like the rest of your team is or you're just as useless as the dude chilling on the hook
---
Change hag for 'When already too late'.
---
A little bit THICC'er then Kate but still class A cosplay.
---
An beautiful camera work, are you a photographer/editer or do you know one?
---
Some dude posted a thing where people shouldn’t discourage and stomp on noobs for using NOED because it might be all they have and that toxicity is unnecessary. People have made it a meme format now.
---
The 6 perks, plus Myers unlocked, is worth it. 
---
After that, you have a 0% chance to get his splinter in your bloodwebs (very good, because it counts as an ultra rare spawn, which blocks real add ons), and Laurie.
---
Amazing cosplay, I love it!
---
every game like that the killer always brings a mori:( for me anyway
---
It looks like that Nikon has had enough of your shit.
---
Wow so you really aren’t reading my posts at all and being an oblivious Survivor whining, and I’m a survivor main myself. 🙄
---
How did he do that?
---
I was waiting for big brain plays... I got what I wanted
---
Anyone that would like to play, feel free to add me. I got the game yesterday though so I'm still learning.
---
PSN - KenshinSaitou
---
My mom just gave it to me, its actually a pen. Idk where she got though :/
---
Jake's Iron Will and Calm Spirit help him stay hidden and stealthy, so he's a good survivor to play.
---
If you spawn with others, co-op working on a gen will help speed up repairs a lot.  However if you or one of your mates flubs a skillcheck, you should get away and find a hiding spot.  Splitting up can be good because the killer has a less of a chance of finding and hitting someone, but your generator progress will be slower.
---
There's a killer perk that highlights generators being worked on by two or more survivors but if you are new, killers probably won't be using it.
---
As long as its pretty nerf lmao
---
Or right in front of a hook.
---
Why waste money and time, wanna crush some noobies? You can buy it for 10 euros on sale now.
---
The killer could have just hooked through you after the first hit though so oops
---
Myers is a lot of fun, and his map is also my favourite. Definitely recommend it, OP
---
Oh I didn’t know I’m an ash main but  I don’t use his perks
---
i suck too xd
---
Thank you so much!!
---
This one was taken and edited by a friend of mine who is a fellow cosplayer! I’ll pass on the compliment :D

She really got the mood down perfectly, especially because this was shot in daylight in the middle of a park in my city!

Thank you so much! :D

It was well worth stumbling around drenched in food dyed corn syrup!

The emblem system is beyond stupid at this point.
---
Ever notice that you get garbage chaser points if you play as a killer with a power that's meant to circumvent chasing? IE Trapper, Ghostface, etc. 
---
Just got out of a game on the I shaped Autohaven map (forget the name, it's really strong killer map though) and decided I'd split the map on the side with Ruin and the basement as Ghost Face.
---
Game went fine, first 3 gens went relatively quick but they knew I was 3 genning them so they stopped at 2 gens. I was stalking, getting regular hits occasionally and only really committing on someone exposed, downing them and quickly hooking them. One guy got "pseudo" camped because the survivors kept trying to run to him and I knew which side of the map all of them were on but I didn't lose any points because of "proximity to a hook". Still only got silver chaser, silver devout (with 3 kills?) , gold malicious and silver gatekeeper.
---
  
---
I only BARELY black pipped. Rank means nothing, sure. But it's still super frustrating to be told "you lose" when you clearly didn't lose...I've black pipped even after getting 11 hooks (for those keeping track, every survivor got hooked 3 times except the one who escaped who was on death hook). It's asinine. Killer emblems are in a terrible spot.
---
Can't believe I'm saying this but I miss the Victory Cube at this point. The fact that people have to GUESS what they got before the game tells them should tell the devs their system is awful. It should be obvious if you are winning or losing. Right now, it's not even consistent.
---
Every killer is noob friendly because you can walk around and just m1 and still do well in rank 20-18, therefore all killers are very accessible.
---
Every trapper I go against lately never use traps.
---
I don’t get the quotations on the video tittle. MOM is trash.
