For killer abilities I will break down each one so you understand but don‚Äôt get confused. The trapper is simple he places bear traps and if you walk into them you get injured. He has add-ons that can change their effect making you bleed more, get downed by them or get injured by disarming them. Counter play is to be observant when you are walking around especially the basement shack which is a wooden structure built in most maps that has a chance to house the basement. The wraiths ability is a bell he starts off cloaked and when he rings his bell becomes visible. While cloaked he cannot attack but he is able to check lockers, kick gens or pallets, vault and close the hatch. When coming out of cloaked form he gains a 1.5 sec speed boost making him have a huge lunge for the duration. While cloaked he gains a small speed boost but if you stun him while invisible or blind him with a flashlight he gets revealed and stunned for a long period of time. Add-ons can make the bell silent and make him faster than normal. The hillbilly has chainsaw sprint which makes home go really fast with limited mobility and if he connects with a survivor than they get downed instantly. If he connects with a wall than he is stunned for a brief period. Add-ons make him faster and turn faster. The nurse haven‚Äôt messed around with her changes but she has a teleport that is able to make her travel through walls ceilings and floors to a set location. Base kit she has 2 that recharge overtime. She is the slowest killer in the game slower than a survivor sprinting. After teleporting she has a brief window to attack, and after this she becomes fatigued for about a second being slower, looking away and unable to attack. She is still able to pull you off of a generator after blinking. Add-ons make it so she gains a blink but she can‚Äôt go through solid objects (she can still blink through pallets and windows) and the other makes her faster like a normal killer but she loses a blink. The Hag has 10 traps she can place around the map and if you trigger one while she is less than 40 meters away (about) she choose to teleport to it. However they do not trigger while you are crouched and they can be destroyed by a flashlight. Add-ons make her able to teleport to a trap from anywhere even when not activated, the traps instead slow you down or they have a secondary effect. The doctor has 2 modes treatment and punishment. Treatment mode makes your terror radius and basic attacks to a madness induced making the survivors hallucinate. These effects vary to a red stain, an illusionary doctor, face pallets and skull checks in random places on the screen. There are 3 levels the third you can ‚Äúsnap out‚Äù of each varying in effects. Add-ons change what you see while mad. Lastly the shock from treatment mode prevent survivors from using pallets or vaults for 2 seconds. Punishment mode is a basic killer with basic attacks. Myers has 3 tiers of ‚Äúevil within‚Äù the first has no terror radius and slower speed the second is an average killer and the third is instant down basic attacks with tier 2 stats. Tier 3 lasts 60 seconds base and than goes back down to 2 the killer can never go back to one once they hit 2. Tier change is signified by the telltale theme song of Micheal. Add-ons make it so his tier 3 can last longer, and that tier 3 can instantly kill like a mori. Huntress is a ranged killer with hatchets that she can throw and she replenishes at lockers. Her add-ons can make her hatchets give different effects exhaustion, blindness etc; others make you instadowned, or highlighted. Lastly she has one that gives her more hatchets. The cannibal has a chainsaw as well that instadowns after a rev-up time but is in an area around him and he doesn‚Äôt go as fast as the hillbilly. After he hitting a wall he goes into a tantrum which extends the instadown time but makes him stay still. Add-ons make him slightly faster while using the chainsaw. The nightmare puts you to sleep over time. This makes you unable to hear his heartbeat but only the sound of the jump rope girls. While in the dream world you are can be affected by snares which lower your mobility. He also has an ability to teleport to generators. To escape the dream either fail a skill check, go to a highlighted alarm clock or have another survivor wake you up. His add-ons can change his power to dream pallets which are just like doctors fake pallets. The clown has a bottle that he throws which creates an area of gas anyone inside will slow down and cough while having reduced vision. Add-ons make you able to be instadowned if he hits you point blank with a bottle, expand the area of the gas and add extra slowdown. The spirit can traverse the ethereal plane to travel around the map. Unlike the Wraith this is a limited use and can be used for only a few seconds before going on cool down. While in this mode she cannot see survivors but she can see their scratch marks. After she exits she gets a speed boost to catch survivors. When she does this she leaves a husk and an audio cue of breaking glass is heard. Add-ons can make blood visible during her power, increase speed and duration or removes the audio cue so you never know when it‚Äôs used. The legion has feral frenzy; a mad dash that makes his basic attacks apply deep wounds and increases his movement speed. He cannot down survivors in this state and as a brief fatigue window in between uses. Deep wounds is a timer that if you do not mend in time you get downed but only ticks down when out of the killers terror radius. During this frenzy legion can vault pallets and windows at the same speed as survivors. Add-ons can make his terror radius stretch the whole map during feral frenzy, allow him to see gen progress through walls during frenzy and to apply effects if you are hit twice in one activation. The plague also has a ranged attack. When using ‚Äúvile purge‚Äù she sickens survivors and they soon become broken making them injured until they cleanse. However if you cleanse she gains corrupt purge which has the same distance as vile purge but it does damage to you instead. When vs a plague don‚Äôt cleanse. Her power can be used in generators to stop infect survivors who touch it. Her add-ons can make you be revealed when you vomit from sickness, gain corrupt purge on gen completion along with effectiveness and duration increases. (Almost there). Next is ghostface his power is similar to Myers but is tracked on individual survivors. ‚ÄúNight shroud‚Äù his power makes his terror radius 0 and allows him to stalk and lean around corners. After stalking for a time the survivor becomes exposed meaning the next attack will kill you no matter what. By looking at ghost face you reveal him and he can no longer stalk you tell his power comes back. Second tid-bit he can crouch like a survivor. Add-ons can make his power be better for tracking and make his reveal hitbox smaller. The demogorgon has 2 powers. Shred and portals; Shred is a pounce that can hit from about 6ish meters and portals are what they say on the tin. A base of 6 portals can be placed around the map and if he stands on one he can TP to another. After TPing the portal is revealed and survivors can destroy it. After TPing you momentarily have a 0 terror radius. Add-ons can make him see injured survivors while TPing, and effect survivors that are removing portals. Lastly The Pig which has 3 main abilities. Crouch is used to sneak around the map and if you attack from this state than you do an ambush attack which is a huge dash attack that makes an audio cue when started. Her main power is jigsaws baptism or better known as the reverse bear trap. These can be placed on downed survivors. After a gen is completed the timer starts and the survivor has to find the correct jigsaw box (base 4) to remove it. If this is not done the survivor dies on the spot. The timer is paused when downed, in a chase and cannot activate when searching a jigsaw box. I do not own this killer so I don‚Äôt know the add-ons.

Once again hope this helps, and I‚Äôm sorry about the length of it.

spoken like a true reddit nerd. Randomly makes an assumption on someone based on literally nothing when no one was talking to you in the first place. Yikes sweaty
---
Ah okay. So when Michael stares at you he is slowly building up his stalk. When he stalks you to a certain point he will become into Evil Within 3 and he has the ability to instant down you. So definitely don't let him stalk you.

Got it for free on PS+ and have bought all DLC except for ST. Have only bought one cosmetic so far and hopefully haven't opened up a can of worms...
---
Pffft childs play.. use object of obsession üòà
---
*cries in Adam Main*
---
Well what does he do? I haven't seen the movie
---
1 is a great killer, the other is a lazy mess with copied addons.
---
Still decently fun tho
---
I‚Äôve been playing on Xbox for a few months but I just got it on pc and holy shit the chat. Some people need to remember this is supposed to be fun.
---
I play on now on PS4. I prefer it. I know I'm mental. I did start on PC. Completely different red ranks. In my time it was all Nurse or Billy. I used Doc and Pig to rank 1 on PS4. The 360s+choppy frame rate and auto aim can drive me crazy as a killer but no BM messages after games and no Omega blink nurses. I used huntress and was good with her but again the frame drops just kill me.
---
Are you mad that it hit? Because it def should, she didn‚Äôt drop the pallet fast enough
---
Yeah, it happens, but sometimes you‚Äôre aware and its your uncles dick.
---
Yea but that‚Äôs no excuse for how garbage the rewards are. I still have to pay $10 for it in the first place when I could get a full outfit for that price for a character I actually play. Maybe if the cosmetics were exclusive and maybe if I earned a little more cells than I payed in, but for now I‚Äôm going to vote with my wallet and not buy at all.
---
No no i luhv this. This deserves some coins.
---
Yea I have this weird thing where every time I get a Spirit, I magically get transported back to the lobby
---
You'd thing being a rank 1 killer you would know how to be a good survivor and k ow what not to do but doesn't look like it.
---
I‚Äôm $50 in. If you change your steam region to Argentina then you cant get Auric cells &amp; other steam games dirt cheap. 
---
So far i got pig dlc, demo dlc, every hallowed blight cosmetic that i wanted, full demo outfit, and i bought the battle pass.  
---
And I still have about $30 USD unspent in my Steam Account.
---
If you're in a house doing a gen and your spine chill goes off...that means the killer is coming to check on that gen. It doesn't matter if you dont know which direction so long as you know (or at least should already know by now) which ways the killer can come from. ....there's literally only a few entrances so it's best to just leave soon as spine chill goes off.....bcuz what if the PREM goes off and you know the killer is coming...well its exhausted so you're screwed now bcuz you dont know which way he's gonna go....you're left guessing now...so how is that better than Spine where its always gonna tell you which way he's facing ?
---
Glad I could help
---
so.. European
---
LF wins at basement camping though.
---
Killer, it was a plague game with a swf group. They really knew their loops and ran them super tight so I couldn't really spew on them. I only managed to get 2 hooks that game. Last hook being at end game which ended with borrowed time into the exit gate. My mouse started drifting up for some reason and that was it. I ended up beating the shit out if into my desk and into the trash.
---
You‚Äôre on reddit yourself, ya nerd
---
Taunt, honestly pretty worthless
---
Your need to be in a chase and i assume escape without being hit 3 times, just to have to break LOS for multiple seconds to end a chase, and even when it activates either the killer can still see you because theres not many places you could of gone, or tracked you by blood if injured. Or he wasn't going after you in the first place so the 3 stacks you just got are wasted
---
Seize: Also worthless. Most killers wont get stunned by pallets so this a worse lithe, thats activate condition requires you to get a flashlight stun or DS the killer, which is already super conditional.
---
Even if you get the pallet stun, your speed boost is worthless becuase it makes you leave the pallet you are looping at and he just follows you or you stay there and your speed boost did nothing
---
I need you is..... weird. You want a on demand styptic agent for free, but requires you to be the last two people alive, and makes them broken. There really isn't a drawback because if your in a final 2 situation with gens remaining your both probably just waiting for the other to die so the other gets the hatch, and allows for trolling.
---
On the other hand, it allows for a ghetto borrowed time, but why wouldn't you just run borrowed time?
---
Overall really shit perks, nobody would ever use these
---
I‚Äôm a Jane main and I can confirm her hitbox is bigger than most survivors.
---
Instead of trying to explain it here's the clip where you first see him in the movie. https://youtu.be/2RJGRG7fg8Q

[deleted]
---
You know UK isn‚Äôt in Europe right?
---
We don't know!
---
He wasn‚Äôt toxic you were just bad so he wanted to actually rank up since you all woulda one hooked
---
I know you are correct but I have to let them go. I had it happen to me twice when a killer seen me jump off hook and escorted me to the hatch. So I'm going to pay that back by double. I let 2 go so far. I'm the same with hatch. I've had a handful of killers let me get it. So I give hatch as a reward for not DCing or well played. I get shit about it on Reddit but I like to pay kindness back. This game is the only game where I show mercy.
---
I must be playing in an alternate universe
---
I hit rank 1 a while ago and have been there consistently. The comments here especially tell everyone that red ranks are sweaty and toxic, but that‚Äôs literally not the case. The toxicity is nowhere near as bad as people say it is (atleast from my experience) and you don‚Äôt face spirit or nurse every single game, many in red ranks have been using different killers like trapper or clown rather than the meta.  Also, you don‚Äôt need meta perks to be there, with enough gamesense and awareness you can make pretty much any build viable.
---
he deleted the comment lmao
---
it said something along the lines of "if I get cancer i'm telling the police it's from you. thank you"
---
he then edited it saying something like "wow people can't take edgy jokes"
---
Means " don't worry " haha
---
Maybe even after
---
True
---
Sometimes it is
---
If it‚Äôs latency then holy shit everyone must have crap internet because this is every game.
---
What!? LOL
---
Freddy I use BBQ, PGTW, Ruin and Blood warden always ending 4K... 
---
Wraith I‚Äôve not really levelled up but if I did 
---
BBQ, Ruin, Nurses calling, 4th perk of choice
---
Depip means you‚Äôve lost one ‚Äúpip‚Äù off your overall rank as survivor/killer When you finish a trial refer to the progress tab to see how you‚Äôve done
---
if i wasnt eating insta noodles to survive I'd get some just for you.
---
Nah fam
---
When you mindgame a high wall, do killer give you information?
---
When gf turn on his power and his red stain disappear, does he give you information? When Myers is in t1 and grabs your ass, does he give you information?
---
Yep.. I guess for spirit is different even if she's totally blind when using her power. But ok dude, I guess survivors are entitled to have information 100% of the time..
---
i REALLY love that nancy look too
---
what does the nurse blinking mean?
---
it would be nice if in custom games you could oh idk actually customize something like this
---
What a fuckin' idiot
---
I did, both were pretty close together. He didn‚Äôt open either of them and the 3 minutes weren‚Äôt up yet, they were about half way.
---
You should try the DBD Forums. It's not the greatest but there's a place for specifically what you're asking for. You could also try joining different DBD servers and looking there  
---
I strongly recommend asking for people within 2-3 ranks of you for matchmaking purposes.
---
Best for last
---
You sure he didn‚Äôt loot a key from a chest?
---
I've been revving my chainsaw a lot. I'll give this a shot, and thanks for the other help. I'll check those links out.
---
Yea that's why I like to play both sides equally so I know why players are doing what they are doing and to avoid getting tunneled. Your mate should have some insight and be understanding but each to their own right
---
I am too, but with the Biker cosmetic ü§§
---
It won't happen. If they become viable, people DC against them and BHVR nerf them. Its something that happened several times already
---
But that‚Äôs fun if you use a paint brush
---
You aren‚Äôt gonna get any better by crying in a corner. Get off your ass, and get in there champ. I believe in you.
---
THANK YOU! Almost everyone hates legion and dcs to lower their points and score.  I'm just tryna see how much I can climb in ranks before reset. I think it's mainly because Legion can be annoying with the right build, but I only have discordinace, and unrelenting.
---
I knew that it's going to be this but still clicked... I regret it
---
Constant killer dailies, waiting 17 minutes for a match, playing that match where nobody stops in a trap and gets 5 gens done in 3 minutes, gaining absolutely nothing.
---
This game makes me want to genuinely kill myself.
---
Honestly that's annoying no matter the side. It fucks everyone over when anyone does it
---
If there's a killer there's a noed
---
Killer Vs. would be easier to balance, but harder to coordinate, since you can't deny people "Kill with Friends" for long, and then they'll start collaborating instead of competing.
---
Co-Op Killers would be harder to balance, but much easier to implement.
---
I'm all for either, or both, personally. If it's both, it's okay to make Vs. only with pubs, and if you're worried about queues, just use a preference setting and make all queues in the same pool. A bit sloppy, but people didn't mind Overwatch telling you what game mode you were playing after you found the match.
---
Every killer can be annoying with the right build lol.
---
Friend you just gotta get in the game. You‚Äôre going to get rolled sometimes when you‚Äôre playing killer it happens to all of us. But you‚Äôre not going to learn their tricks if you go put yourself in time out like a toddler.
---
Incorrect
---
yes thats what i said, great reading comp skills moron.
---
It is your fault that you pussy out just because you think people are better than you. Could you imagine how shitty life would be if everyone had this mentality?
---
https://redd.it/ddj6nv

Get the perk Franklin's demise, each slap will make a surv drop their item so it would help limit that issue. As a  rank 12 killer trying to depip (and failing), the best thing to do is use that or switch killer if you see a group packing items. I'd recommend Leatherface cause he carries Franklin's demise and BBQ which are both great killer perks.

[The answer](https://redd.it/ddj6nv)
---
Me too, wanna know what happens after I'm gone.  Did they make it out okay?  
---
Earlier I got tunneled &amp; a surv was 360ing in front of me while I was on the hook.  They eventually unhooked me, but it was as the Killer was arriving.  They intentionally body blocked me so I got hit,  hooked out if the game.  I wanted to see it they did the same to the other survivors.  See if others got tunneled too etc...
---
why is this board sucking this no names dick?
---
What does not willing to learn has to do with him acknowledging  her lack of clues? True spends a lot of time on every stream teaching ppl how to play against Spirit, explaining certain  plays and popular situations. He literally thinks ppl complaining about Spirits are a 'group of sheeps' as he said it himself. I'm sure he also thinks Spirit needs some small changes but he's 100% on the side of 'learn how to play' rather than 'scream for nerfs'. 
---
Honestly for me all it takes is removing beads and making Strider  not work when phasing.  Good Spirits don't use it anyway since it's a waste of  a perk slot but at least bad/decent  Spirit players would have a harder time  playing her.
---
Think ? I cannot hit them, I cannot hit them
---
He honestly looks like a douche
---
Last topic: hex‚Äôs 
---
Hex perks are perks that gain their power from totems that are lit up otherwise known as hex totems. Some need them to be destroyed others stop working when they are destroyed and you can‚Äôt tell which it is.
---
There are 6 hex perks and I‚Äôll go through them 1 by 1.
---
First is devour hope which becomes very scary once 3 survivors are hooked. After 2 survivors are saved from the hook when the killer is far away you gain a token. 2 tokens awards the killer a 3%, 4% and 5% speed boost for ten seconds depending on level. At 3 tokens all basic attacks become instant downs. At 5 tokens the survivors can be moried without the use of a mori offering. To disable the perk find the corresponding totem and destroy it.
---
Next is the infamous hex ruin. What this does is make it so when you hit a good skill check you lose 5% progress and a great skill check you won‚Äôt gain progress. This can be disabled by cleansing the corresponding totem.
---
Then we have Hex: The Third Seal. This perk makes it when the killer hits you with a basic attack you become aura blind meaning perks like bond and empathy will not work till the totem is cleansed. Blindness also effects if you can see downed survivors and hooked survivors. (See more about this in the tutorial section of the game gives pretty good info.)
---
Now we have Hex: Huntress Lullaby. This perk messes with you making the audio cue for skill checks come late and throw of your timing for every token. The killer gets a token by hooking survivors. At 5 tokens the audio cue is gone so you should pay more attention to your screen. Missing these skill checks will hurt up to 6% more making you lose 16% progress.
---
These last 3 are more interesting than the rest and starting with Hex: Thrill of the Hunt. This gives the killer a notification when you are cleansing hex totems and slows all totem cleansing.
---
Next Hex: Haunted Grounds. This perk activates when one of the 2 hex totems are cleansed making all survivors exposed for 60 seconds. This is a spirit teachable so when vs her keep in mind if she has 2 hex‚Äôs. 
---
Lastly Hex: No one Escapes Death. When all generators are complete or when the the hatch is closed everyone is affected by exposed status effect without knowing. This is can be removed early game by getting rid of all 5 dull totems around the map. (If you take out 4 dull totems and a hex than it still works, also hex totems cannot turn into a hex totem housing No one Escapes Death.)
---
It‚Äôs a joke I am aware of that post
---
You kept playing while doing the glitch, a ban wouldn't be unwarranted. That being said tell me how you do it lol.
---
Calm down, boomer, it‚Äôs just a meme.
---
Thanks
---
The point is the pallets are unsafe, but there are a ton of them. Therefore, you have to actually use your brain instead of just running in a giant circle.
---
A known bug with dedicated servers
---
Read further down.
---
No worries I got it
---
How am I supposed to learn things if I am blinded during the whole game ?
---
It'd be a three-way match. Survivors still have gens to work on and can still escape; they're just under much more pressure than usual to counteract their greater numbers, and there are no keys or moris allowed (Perk killing is still possible).
---
Not against high ranks, I blame the toxic mathmaking
---
Haven‚Äôt noticed this, on Xbox as well.
---
Got as PSplus and Gamepass decided to play it on Xbox since you get 10% off most of the DLC. I have definitely fell in love with the game bought most of the killers and now buying cells so I can get cosmetics for my killers and survivors
---
The nurse blinking is her power. When she blinks she teleports forward a certain distance depending on charge and than can hit you or blink/tp again. This can go through walls.
---
Why do people like this perk so much?
---
Best meme I've seen here so far
---
I like every part of this apart from the Mori, I think changing it so the killer can only mori on death hook would extend the game further then just getting hooked once then just getting killed in your next chase.
---
Second, at least one generator must be done for the killer to kill one survivor, meaning even if a survivor is on death hook as long as 5 gens are left to be complete, the killer will have to hook them risking a save or wiggle off
---
Not saying your idea is bad, the idea of a survivor fighting back and escaping a mori is fantastic
---
But the whole skill check part seems off to me at least.
---
And that's why you're not getting any better. Making excuses makes nobody better.
---
Teleports would get pretty janky. Just a powerful "push" on stunned enemy Killers that sends them a significant distance in one direction is fine. Ideally, it'd even crash them through terrain (which heals immediately afterwards; it's really just a sprite) so Killer bodyblocking isn't an issue.
---
Just imagine Nurse or Spirit shrieking at Billy so hard he gets blown away, or Trapper backhanding Freddy into a house.
---
PI
---
Ds, dead hard, balance landing and iron will btw im red rank
---
Im having a good time with legion no ruin at red ranks though. The games are hard. But thats how its supposed to be. Not one sided like spirit or nurse. Billy is the strongest but acceptable just because you can see what his doing
---
Btw what is your platform? Maybe I can give you more tips?
---
It's easy for you to say that
---
OK BOOMER
---
With that few survivors and 2 hatches, it's best to ban keys and moris.
---
Removed for name shaming
---
Ugh that sucks man, hopefully that guy got facecamped in the basement :x
---
People just dont know how to play pig properly
---
Killer can be really challenging and stressful but how I keep my game mentality good is by focusing only on getting the stacks for BBQ, each token (for each survivors first hooked) is a 25% BP bonus to all game actions. Get your stacks and take a deep breath, as long as you make at least 30k BP it's been a good game.
---
When people say unsafe are they just meaning dogshit pallets? Because I've yet to be out-mind gamed when I play killer on that map at rank 1.
---
Not sure the balance philosophy behind adding a map full of crappy pallets yet just making more of them. Chases still end really fast since the pallets are pretty much useless.
---
Do you live in the Upside Down ?
---
But that doesn't mean people can't play him to have fun
---
As a killer main i dont mind survivors escaping and using non meta killers. If they said they balanced the game with 2 kills and 2 escapes then at least make 2ks brutal most of the time while a 3k is pipup. My only issie is that you mostly lose at 2k and barely win with 3-4k
---
There's no daily in this entire game that requires you to mori everyone in the game after you tunnel the hooks. You're a typical spirit player. There's nothing else to expect from you. Tunnel hooks instead of pressuring gens. What a lame ass bitch you are.
---
Self care, borrowed time, lithe, were gonna live forever/adrenaline
---
youre so hip, consuming and regurgitating daily internet memes without any creativity of your own. i'm not a boomer, but i'm still wise enough to see how much of a loser you are
---
The point of the unsafe pallets is so that you drop them and keep running instead of "Alright now i just need to run around this haybale for a minute or until he decided to break it."
---
300 iq play
---
"use your brain" lol hitting survivors at almost every pallet on that map is literally braindead easy, there's not a lot they can do unless they maybe have lithe and run away to another weak crappy pallet, where they'll go down there anyway.
---
I don't have Leatherface or BBQ
---
Adrenaline is balanced and fun to play against.
---
True true, my b
---
Killers complained about looping, which rightfully so can be a pain in the ass back in the day but IMO they went overkill on that new map. If a killer wants to down you on that map it's going to happen fast.
---
I live in the gap between rank 4 (2 pips) and rank 5 (5 pips).  
---
It hurts.  
---
Killers always trying. (Fair)  
---
Survivors either trying, but often meme-ing.
---
A what now?
---
You should blame yourself, your gonna get smashed, yes but next time you will do slightly better eventually making it so you will be on their level.
---
Your the kid who takes his ball home because everyone else didnt do what you wanted at the playground.

Yeah, playing killer made me a better survivor, I just dont level my killers cause it feels like wasting points I could be pumping into survivor which is what I prefer to play. I've always had more fun being chased than being the one chasing, even in tag when I was a kid.
---
At least give us the option to have multiple killers in a private lobby
---
EXACTLY!
---
I‚Äôm a wraith main myself and I can help. With erratic movements while cloaked they can waste their flashlight. If your in a chase with wraith for longer than 1:30 than go pressure the map with your cloak. Use bloodhound or whispers to help yourself out. What‚Äôs your build?
---
No, I'm the kid who stay on his own because I know where my place is
---
But siren head is ***really fucking tall***
---
I meant that it was incredibly obvious, and didn't need to be said, but obviously you haven't figured it out yet.
---
This might be why you have no friends :/
---
Thats why they use spirit. They want the easiest way to win, if you dont let them have it well... *Angry spirit noises*
---
He didn‚Äôt escape he died to the collapse and someone else from the game might have DCed making you get the bonus.
---
Four self cares
---
But WGLF has a PSYCHOLOGICAL effect so it doesn't need to really do anything and in fact is also a crutch perk.
---
/s
---
"i want someome to keep something the way it is not because i like it, but because other people do not like it"
---
so basically youre a toxic dickhead?
---
This is not just wholesome, is also true. Go and play, imagine is a movie, would u watch a slasher movie if the killer is just standin there doing nothing? If the four escape is ok, thats how the movie should end, next time is gonna be different.
---
I'll be honest hes kinda turning me over to that side as well
---
So I'm gonna guess you get hit while in the middle of dead hard and then get unhooked.
---
Except that isn't what happens lol. You drop them and basically go down instantly if you leave them which makes survivor feel redundant
---
When your friend who loves horror stuff tries to talk about it with you, but the only thing remotely horror you like is Stranger Things
---
I love throwing my toxic cocktails at survivors.
---
Camping and tunneling consistently yeilds these kind of results
---
imagine some of these new killer players playing on the old pallet town.......
---
This is fantastic.
---
I mean, I play Huntress, Myers, and Ghostface primarily at red ranks. I don't really enjoy spirit or nurse so I don't play them.
---
Correct
---
I prefer to follow the words of [the Sniper:](https://youtu.be/9NZDwZbyDus) ‚ÄúBe polite. Be efficient. Have a plan to kill everyone you meet.‚Äù
---
Ok Boomer.
---
Start learning to look away quickly when they flashlight you. Before you pick up a survivor look around and make sure there isn‚Äôt a flashlight hero following you. When you pick someone up if there is a wall or object you can turn your face towards to prevent the flashlight save do that. There isn‚Äôt much you can do after they drop a pallet but you can use your ears to listen to which way they went. 
---
You won‚Äôt get any better at dealing with this stuff if you don‚Äôt practice it. You can actually beat people who are a lower rank than you. 
---
Also Mr Bing Bong is a cool killer but he is literally one of the worst to try and play. I would consider playing a killer that is a little better in their base kit til you get the hang of some of these basic killer skills and good perks to help you.
---
Ok boomer
---
Bloodhound, Predator and Iron Grasp
---
Don't you dare even speak about my billy. I swear to god if they nerf him I'm straight up done with this game.
---
He‚Äôd roll his head at you like a bowling ball and knock you flat on your ass.
---
Ok then maybe your best bet is to switch off Wraith. It's good to have a main but if you're stuck at lower ranks, killers like Wraith are low tier and can tend to get bullied especially until you can get Franklin's.
---
Then you didnt drop them properly. If your just holding W and pressing space when you get there then your dumb.
---
You can loop pre-drop all you want but the moment its down you run away, hopefully with the stun, or at least the few seconds it takes him to go around the object. You can almost always get to the next pallet unless your in the corner one, in that case you just went to a terrible pallet and played yourself.
---
[removed]
---
She's no longer the best option if you just want to win, but if you like her playstyle, she's still usable, just with weird addons and more waiting to do anything after using your skill.
---
Yea I get that. At the start for me tho it was more for bloodpoints but now I prefer killer over survivor only coz I like being stealthy as either micheal or ghost face
---
This is exactly what I mean. A whole lot of what if's, followed by a statement that it "guarantees" anything. Which it doesn't. It doesn't work that way at all against a competent team of survivors. Likewise you say "easily patrol the gates", which they could've spawned far apart.  Not to mention you left out the consideration of the Hatch - which is a constant in every game.  
---
Once those gates go up, so does every survivor using a speed burst ability - namely Adrenaline to get to the doors.  So if you're lucky you can get 1 more survivor that game, and if you're even more lucky then the rest stick around to try and save their friend so you can get the rest. That's a lot more what if's.  
---
When if the survivor team is competent, they would go for the 2 gates, start opening them. You find 1 surv at 1 gate, chase him, the other gate opens. You catch the one person you found - or they escape by looping you so well to the other gate.  
---
Anyways by the end of the day i'm a rank 1 killer that doesn't use NOED because it's a useless perk that only works at the end of the game. I usually sac all survivors before the 3rd gen is even done, and max bp on all catagories.  The build I use is BBQ, Pop, Thana, and Ruin. Which I would use Dying light over Ruin if the perk wasn't so weak (it's Thana, but takes too long to get stacks compared to just injuring survs once, while also making 1 survivor into a super survivor - uhh no thanks).  
---
This way as killer you sac everyone, and not just some, and at the same time you're not relying on the end game and a bunch of chances.
---
Who is sleep?
---
We all started out there though! Believe me it doesn‚Äôt necessarily get better at lower ranks lol. It‚Äôs a crap shoot. You win some and lose some. Sometimes they will bully you with their flashlight triple toolbox shenanigans. There‚Äôs not much you can do.
---
What exactly was your problem with Pig?
---
I mean, yeah she'll suck if you play her against 4 Survivors who can hit Great Skillchecks and know how to loop, but so will most of the Killer roster.
---
If you're just talking like, in general at Red Ranks or lower, then she can wreck face if you play her well.
---
just because i dont fuck my friends like you doesnt mean I dont have any.
---
He had a med kit, that was all. I made sure to check because I was confused
---
Btw, for example. Hex: Devour Hope, and Make Your Choice are two perks that is exactly NOED, but better (DH could be argued against because it is a totem, and they could cleanse it before you can even get your 3 stacks).
---
As someone who has been playing this game for the past 2 years, I think it helps to think as the killer as a community servant role. You are just there to make a game for 4 survivors and that is it. 
---
If you are someone who is competitive, then this mindset can help as it helps you to understand that you cant win against a 4 man SWF with purple flashlights.
---
You‚Äôre probably right, my game might‚Äôve just glitched
---
I mean, sure it is, because I went through the exact same thing. Except I never gave up, and that's why I'm better now.
---
[Discovered soundscape files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yG0QNV8mAA) have a very distinct inspiration.
---
It's a pretty reliable way to end chases faster.
---
im not surprised.
---
If you‚Äôre referring to checking on the after match scoreboard, I could be mistaken but I think the scoreboard shows what item they started the match with, not items they pick up during the match. Could be wrong though, I‚Äôm not sure
---
Had one earlier, was it cold wind farms? Just sat at the top of the hill sometimes checked up on the survivors?
---
Sounds too classy for a game about shanking people after running in circles and being smacked with wooden pallets.
---
I play wraith and I find success with 2 main builds
---
Bamboozle, sloppy butcher, nurses, and devour hope (NOED)
---
This can be used with all seeing spirit
---
PGTW, Ruin, Haunted grounds (TOTH), and BBQ/whispers
---
This should be used with windstorm
---
Mix-n-Match and see what you like everyone has a different playstyle.
---
You sound clueless ngl. It takes less than a few seconds to run around most of the pallets which is WHY they're called unsafe. If this map was decent with pallets I would not be 4king easily on it majority of my matches lol
---
Also every pallet on that map is pretty much terrible
---
Ah ok that‚Äôs probably what happened then! Thank you!
---
With Freddy right now I am running Ruin, Haunted Grounds, BBQ and Nurse‚Äôs I think.
---
Consider that playing Killer was so horrible that fewer than 1 in 5 people wanted to.
---
I've said it before, I will say it again.   
---
Make survivor charms be necklaces.
---
Same, I hate even being higher than 12. Too many sweety killers And survivors. It just makes the whole game awful and feel terrible.
---
This. Most Pigs I meet just tunnel people with RBTs.
---
Imo it should be ranged and not universal, like if you're too far from the last gen you don't get affected by it, currently it's really strong
---
Iron grasp can be dropped for another perk. What do you have. 
---
P.S what‚Äôs ur platform?
---
That's gay. Those are the pigs that need to UnInStAlL
---
Flashlights aren‚Äôt gonna disappear when (if) you ever manage to get to high ranks.
---
Whining won‚Äôt make you better, and facing R20s only won‚Äôt either. Practice. Watch streamers. Look for perks that could work out for you. Or just don‚Äôt play killer if you mentally can‚Äôt handle it.
---
They're mostly just for harassing Killers.
---
Well I wanted to Wraith to rank 40 because I want to give his Bloodhunt perk to the Huntress
---
Every pallet on that map is basically unsafe in the hallways, the ones inside the rooms for the most part are safe.
---
The only real "bad" pallets in that map are the one upstairs in that one room for some reason, and the corner hallway by the basement
---
Use a different killer to play with and then just feed him the BP.
---
Had a guy who ran rancor then at end game tunneled only me and then let everyone else go it was lame
---
I don't find him boring personally. Landing bottles and getting direct hits can be just as fun as huntress, even more so when you bring pinky or interrupt a crucial action imo
---
That‚Äôs a rare sighting
---
...they do know it's Rancor though. They see the killer's aura every time a generator gets completed. Rancor is fine you just need better reading comprehension
---
Like a clam.. I guess
---
If the game ended when the top timer reached 0 than what i said was the case if it happened before than either he found a key or it glitched as u said.
---
Well normally, if you hit a survivor and they run in a straight line, it'll take you \~20 seconds to catch up
---
With this perk at 8 stacks, it only takes you \~12 seconds, that's a massive difference
---
Not to mention how easy it is to hit multiple survivors if they start trying to bodyblock you when hooking a survivor, or you catch multiple survivors together on a gen and they want to just barely finish it
---
It has quite a few uses because of the massive reduction to the time you spend staring at your weapon or wiping blood off of it
---
Thanks. The Wraith is not my main, I main the Huntress but I wanted to give Bloodhunt to the Huntress
---
No thanks. I see how you feel that's a fair trade, but no.
---
It's just the ultimate power move, it mind games the killer with chad energy
---
If you want to go full meme build, run overcharge and huntresses lullaby, as lullaby increases the regression of failed skill-checks by 6 percent. Add dream slowdown add-ons and they'll be failing plenty of skill-checks to wake up, only to regress the gen 10% each time. Can slow gens a lot.
---
Are you okay , he said himself  moris aren‚Äôt okay 
---
. Honestly people like you are just spreading false message
---
They should give him an add-on to make gassed survivors work on gens extremely slowly.  Or just make it base kit. It wouldn't be op in the slightest and would take him in the right direction.
---
So giving up is the only solution
---
The tomb hissing noises are really creepy. I feel like I'm going to like this new killer
---
I was not raised to have a winner mentality
---
Nothing personal, kid.
---
This only happens on a certain skin, and is not consistent even then. That would be an amazing addition though.
---
You haven‚Äôt thought much about this idea, have you?
---
Doesn't matter if you can see the killer' aura what good does that do? Put on Object of Obsession what I'm saying is that the perk is broken asf and gives the killer a free  kill and if its a bad killer  a kill they didn't deserve.
---
Hey man we all started somewhere. But you aren‚Äôt going to improve if you just sit in a corner and wait for the game to end. Ofcourse we all get shit on sometimes but if you just give up you aren‚Äôt going to improve. When all of us first started the game we sucked donkey dick but when you play more matches and learn the game that‚Äôs how you improve if you give up and sit in the corner how do you expect to improve? I wish you the best of luck out there and actually try and not give up because if you give up, you aren‚Äôt going to get better and your wasting your time. Good luck buddy.
---
Also I don‚Äôt know if you care about this or you know but, Wraith is one of the worst killers in the game. If you aren‚Äôt having any luck with wraith and you keep losing, I‚Äôd recommend looking up guides or something and find another killer your interested in and try them out. If you keep failing at Wraith just try someone else, eventually you‚Äôll find one you like and you can use them.
---
Youd be surprised how often even high ranks will make mistakes. Or high ranks will be paired with a lower rank. Try dropping a chase against a bully high level and finding a different survivor, if you can find a weak link you can snowball the match through pressuring the rest of the team to save the weaker survivor. Playing against higher ranks is a great way to learn, you're not going to win against every team. If you only play against low rank survivors you'll never get any better.
---
Honestly, I don't even need Bloodhunt now that I think about it. It didn't helped me that much
---
But we not having this conversation about NOED?
---
Kate was way too far away for it to hit
---
All killers have the same range of lunge and slash and jav or whatever. Clowns weapon is small, but he's really big, so his lungs animation makes him lunge very far.
---
Have you tried playing survivor if you dont care about getting better?
---
Ruin, BBQ, Thrilling Tremors, and PGTW is my go to Fredward build
---
They're probably just awkwardly trying to add any sort of depth to chasing. In 99% of maps against 2% of Killers at red ranks, but 99% below there, you just loop and your problems go away.
---
Forget expanding general Killer mobility with something like destructable walls, stepping up onto waist-high obstacles, or anything else than being extremely obvious and just having to follow and hope to provoke a mistake.
---
1) Perk-wise, Lightborne or Franklins Demise will help you. Pick whichever you want, the former comes with a top tier killer, the latter comes with a killer that you should level anyway because he has BBQ and Chilli. If survivors have flashlights equipped in the lobby, just switch to that perk. Franklins is probably better since it also works on other items, but if you don¬¥t have Leatherface (you really really should buy him tho), Lightborne is good enough. And you should level Billy for Enduring anyway too.
---
2) They probably either blind you when you are picking up a survivor or breaking a pallet. The pallet break stun matters fuck all, just listen to where they are running off (use headphones) and you have scratch marks too, it¬¥s really not a good tactic anyway. And if you have Lightborne they get fucked the first time they try it. When picking up survivors try to face a wall so they cannot come at you from that direction and blind you while you are stuck in the animation. When carrying others and they try to blind you, just flick your mouse/controller to the other direction if they get in front of you and walk sideways, it¬¥s not that hard to dodge.
---
If you face a group where the survivors are trying aggressively bully you with flashlights, consider not picking up the dying survivor right away. Stand on him and fake it for a second or two. You will often hear them running at you getting ready to blind you at which point you can just quickly turn around and get a free hit in.
---
3) If you really want to have easier games, consider ditching Wraith. He is one of the weaker killers and you will probably have easier games if you use Nurse or Hillbilly from the base game pool. They also have much better teachable perks, Wraith has straight up trash. Bloodhound isn¬¥t even worth it at all, use Sloppy Butcher instead. Even Huntress is free and can be pretty nice, although her teachable perks are meh and she is quite a different playstyle than other killers.
---
Iii don't know, is it easy to carry survs without Iron Grasp ?
---
I am on PC
---
Clearly not! But elaborate please üòÅ if there is an obvious flaw, I have not seen it :)
---
I just made a rework if you are interested
---
Decisive Strike was so strong that it was nerfed twice. Even after the nerfs it is still used more than any other perk in the game. Even survivors who choose not to run DH or Adreniline still generally run DS. So when y'all telling me it is not the strongest perk in the game, I have to assume that you're either low rank or trolling. So which is it?
---
The Ghostface is expressing his concerns that the difficulty for level four tome challenges is too severe, artificially inflated to force people to pay additional money to unlock tiers. The Demogorgon wants to know if Ghostface intends to eat this dead body.
---
thats a lot of time.
---
When i first saw otz start to showcase it i gave it a chance and now i can't put it down.
---
Nurse is easy in the sense that you don't need to learn how to run most tiles in the game. All you need to do well vs good survivors is learn how to blink because the Nurse's power ignores the game's normal chase mechanics.
---
Yes, they're both correct advice. The only way you'll get any better is by playing without quitting whenever it gets a little difficult. Play both sides and over time you'll learn how to counter most plays on either side
---
Nobody asked for the trees.
---
In my surv games, I always see Wraith getting 4ks though
---
... That's the definition of what having a great day is. If you're having a great day you tend to be feeling great, too. If you're saying you're not happy, then how are you possibly having a great day?
---
And also there's a difference between not being positive and lashing out. Happy people don't lash out at others over literally nothing, like you just did.
---
Again, I hope you feel better soon. Either that or get therapy for the apparent issues you would need to have to act the way you are whilst supposedly having a great day.
---
ok zoomer
---
You ran out of arguments. Ok boomer
---
Self pity is a part of me
---
Alert xD
---
False accusations get annoying after awhile
---
People really out here glamorizing there shitty spending habits.
---
Spine chill is objectively better.
---
She is very hard to control for me though
---
Depends on what rank you are, what survivors you are playing against etc. Any killer can just pubstomp survivors at lower ranks easily, Doctor is a fucking nightmare for low ranked survivors yet high ranks just bully him to no end.
---
Because too many people were bad and relied on her add-ons
---
Sounds like a nerf.
---
ur long division test is tomorrow timmy better go to sleep now or you‚Äôll miss the bus. good luck out there
---
I'm going to say yes, but that's because I'm a filthy Killer main who doesn't run NOED.
---
I mean, most of my surv games are 4Ks, plus the rank does not count because the matchmaking is a blender
---
Steve would like to have that bat back
---
Where are you getting your stats that DS is the most used perk in the game?
---
You big mad, huh boomer?
---
Depends on the rate she builds it at. At lower ranks, it is.
---
There's also no reason why the number of cleansing pools has to remain the same, if they're too common despite being single use until reset.
---
Now I know you don‚Äôt like being positive but again, I wish you the best of luck and I hope you improve.
---
Bitch no school tomorrow, Memorial Day jackass. You think bringing up my age makes you win an argument? Fine then. Go take your pills grandpa, your back is cracking. Don‚Äôt forget your adult diaper. Yeah fuck you.
---
r/entitledsurvivors
---
should i get a therapist or larp on reddit and ask for relationship advice
---
Spine Chill.
---
That's what I say everytime..  "just play any other game and DC, then tell me what happens" they always find n excuse to do so, which 100% of the time, is just an egoistic one
---
I played other games than this, idk about them, and if I DC I know I'll get punished. Even 30min penalty before queueing again for one DC, even if wasn't my fault. These people are a joke, if they posted something like that in any other community, they will get laughed at, but here? They get people who defend them
---
I got shit for defending Billy nerf ideas and spirit, it never changed. People wanna easy games all the time while killers has to freaking sweat to have a decent one. One of the reason I play survivor more. I can listen podcast while playing, if I do that while I play killer, without listening every single sound, thinking of strategies, mindgames and so on, in the fly, I get destroyed. 
---
I'm used to fighting games, where people have to **play** that character to understand it's weaknesses an strengths. Here I just see people that don't even bother to play both sides to have a better understanding of it, just scream for nerf and the nerfs will come
---
Lmao. You are a sad, sad person
---
Jeffs long jacket puts the charms on it instead of the pants .
---
Yes and also that Nancy outfit very much
---
A quick Google also shows [this outfit](https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/10/30/1969ebfd-8272-43a0-9adb-4a9e6b074c42-screen-shot-2017-10-30-at-34940-pm.png?w=970&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70) and [this outfit](https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/e53/720x864,85/1927919/image.webp) that would be both inclusions.
---
Assuming they were darker, cause tbh Steve needs some dark cosmetics.
---
First of all... That was DEFINITELY not one of my first few matches. This was just a tirade about how easy the clown can camp without  punishment during the trial. For me to successfully avoid being hooked, I need either an obstacle or a mobility perk. Both can be negated by the killer, so I have to mindgame. Fine. Not my biggest strength sometimes. But for him to easily make sure that I cannot be unhooked when being camped is just boring. And even if someone manages to unhook me whilst I am being camped (whatever killer it might be), I just get complaints about DS or Dead Hard or even balanced landing to be unfair. This post was probably more about the toxicity than about the rank. I'm rank 8 and I don't  need to desperately climb to rank 1...
---
PS4
---
lol imagine complaining about noed on bubba when his saw is actual aids to use without play with your food
---
The fact that 90% of of my games at least 3 people bring it and only once in a blue moon do I face a team of survivors where no one uses it.
---
I think spine chill is better because it has no cool down and the boost when the killer is looking at you
---
That's the spirit! Keep that way bro :D
---
Pay to win game making you buy cosmetics smh
---
You just want to be mad at something. It‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre just looking for some attention, which I will not be providing from this point on. Go watch Otz and see whether you like him or not, and stop being a total dickhead on reddit just for the sake of being a dick. You‚Äôre ruining the good times bucko.
---
because it saves you so much time, since hitting is a thing you will be doing all the time as killer, may as well cut that time in half with 8 tokens AND allows you to feast on survivors bomb rushing hooks
---
Remember everyone, dull totems are a secondary objective, but currently, NOED is the ONLY incentive to cleanse them. Without NOED., dull totems might as well not even exist
---
this is the break down i like. the fucking layers to this game man. unreal.
---
I play Plague at red ranks and I take a damned if you do damned if you dont approach with monitor and abuse especially if I have that red add on that let‚Äôs you sees the auras lol. If they cleanse I massacre them with corrupt if they don‚Äôt cleanse I one shot.
---
Me and my best friend at a Halloween party
---
Yes please. Im at work now tho, ill add ya tonight
---
Just playing your character, you level up with mostly emblems, and you only get perks for leveling, everything else comes form the bloodmarket, a replacement for bloodwebs.
---
I wasn't going in to every possible use for DS, I was just providing my take on why it isn't the best survivor perk like you asked.
---
Yes, DS does allow you to do things you might not otherwise do. Yes, DS may prevent some killers from tunneling (although the slugging cost/benefit compared to hooking is actually quite interesting, but that's another topic for another day), but some just take the DS and get it out of the way. 
---
DS is a strong perk, and it has benefits, but it isn't invulnerability, and it's not unanimously the best survivor perk. People are going to have their own opinions on what works the best for them, and that's okay. It may be best for your playstyle, but it doesn't mean it's the best perk out there.
---
Could you dm me the image (I love it lmao) if it‚Äôs fine with you
---
Thank you :)
---
People gotta pretend they‚Äôre above laughing at themselves
---
Sounds good see ya. I‚Äôm thinking just perk breakdown for both sides if you have the time.
---
Yes and the one person in antarctica will host server and everyone will have 10000 ping
---
What could they even give Bill? I want every character to have at least one set of cosmetics but Bill is only ever seen in his army get up isn't he?
---
Not at all. I laugh at myself all the time. However, I wouldn't be laughing at myself so much for spending $85 on digital dress-up. But that's just me... ü§∑üèº
---
this meme was made by a real life experience where 3 survivors were sacrificed including me(the fourth one got the hatch)
---
Finally someone else
---
Ya it only shows the item they came in with.
---
Ruining the good times? What a loser. The internet is a big place and I have a big appetite. I waste my time eating your troll feed but i'm not wasting my time watching some guy stream video games. Whats fun for me is knowing you think that this upsets me.
---
I'd dig it. I also want the beat up Steve from this season as a cosmetic.
---
That‚Äôs Feng lol, but yes he swings before she puts it down but she should be too far for it to even matter anyway
---
I'm fairly certain that's just a rage quit
---
Im always in front of my computer so always have time
---
can his voice be taken out back and shot
---
I saw the totem before I read this comment, and you know what. That's exactly how Hex: Ruin works in game too.
---
at least be funny about it.
---
Thank you for your service
---
I now see how this change is problematic üòÅ thanks to everyone who took the 2 minutes to comment, I now have a better understanding of the game for it
---
Imagine the killer options there would be to if they put one out, could have several options like there is the the legion
---
Hmm love it when we can calculate everything.
---
Nice try but no, borrowed time is for reason but you clearly camped the hook. Not my fault you lack ability to string together hooks without camping
---
That's because he was a douche at this point in the show.
---
I did it
---
Dead harded into a slope and fucking died
---
*Ghostface is visibly confused*
---
*Freddy Is visibly confused*
---
*Hag is visibly confused*
---
*Demogorgon is visibly confused*
---
These killers are viable but no one even bothers to try them out because META.
---
Leave my billy alone!
---
well lucky for you it seems you get a lot of potatos
---
kewl
---
Ok Boomer
---
That is just you man.
---
I am old enough to remember when people had clever insults.
---
You're right, people are free to their opinions even if they're wrong.
---
Actually that's a pretty valid point, yet I don't see it expressed that often.
---
There are perks granting pretty serious bonuses just because you equip them. Adrenaline is probably the worst offender on the Survivor side. 
---
For Killers I could name Corrupt Intervention: 3 genererators are just blocked, fuck you. As much as I don't like Ruin, it is kind of fair - you can use your skill at hitting skillchecks or find and break the totem. Or Rancor - fuck you twice, a Killer sees your aura and is able to one-shot and kill just because you were chosen at random.
---
Joel as survivor and the killer would be a clicker.
---
Exactly!!
---
Wait... This is a real bug? How do you do this!?
---
Shouldn't need stats at all, it's pretty obvious how much DS is used.
---
Old Man Otz
---
Isn‚Äôt surveillance kind of useless if you‚Äôre teleporting to gens? Don‚Äôt you already get the killer instinct notification when they‚Äôre nearby the portal?
---
All knowing eye... Can you tell me this? Shirtless Myers when?
---
"someone was mean to me so I'm going to be mean to everyone else!" is very childish logic, see how far it'll get you in the real world
---
playing a character is mean lol nice
---
Surge really ain't bad on M1 Killers. Insta-18% regression on top of regular regression you don't gotta go outta your way to activate is pretty solid.
---
*Allknowingeye.exe has stopped responding*
---
Would be awesome if it didn‚Äôt have that owo shit all over it. Otherwise pretty sweet.
---
What is the surprise. I‚Äôm blind even with thicc glasses
---
To be fair STBFL is pretty sexy.
---
That doesn‚Äôt surprise anyone.
---
Yeah the game is already unbalanced, so why not
---
NNN
---
Who?
---
go watch monto or puppers videos that are on these maps, they loop it pretty well (puppers literally have a video where he loops the killer for 5 gens on it, it's nancy cosplay if I'm not mistaken)
---
this map is run different than other maps, you **need** to stun the killer on pallets and there are plenty of areas where you don't use pallets and are still massive time wasters (if you play it well there is a infinity with balanced landing even), you will lose every mind game around pallets and that's why you shouldn't do it, if you missed the stun start running away immediatly and use the speed boost on getting hit to create even more distance
---
Honestly as a low rank killer lightborn is such a strong perk to have, takes so much time to blind you, it‚Äôs help me a lot as a crutch perk as a baby ass killer lol
---
Well you could play your main character and use the bloodpoints on the other character
---
Dont cleanse she can still be looped.
---
They might‚Äôve had DS active and didn‚Äôt hit the check. Or they might‚Äôve been cocky and for some reason stepped like 3m from the gate because they ‚Äúknew‚Äù could run and escape
---
On the lean for real
---
You think it makes survivor unfun.
---
Meanwhile Ghostface/Myers can no longer stalk people, Trapper gets stuck looking at the ground when attempting to place a trap and then canceling, and killers in general have to be extra wary of pallets and there ridiculous hitboxes.
---
Probably the latter because he was pretty annoying the whole game
---
I think in a l4d beta or something he had a different outfit and if I'm not mistaken in payday he appeared in a tank top without his hat on so maybe those ig
---
Upvote because corgis
---
She's like one of the easiest killers to loop. She's strong at low ranks but usually a joke at high ranks.
---
Meanwhile  iv been in red ranks nearly all season and cant de rank fast enough. 5-10 mins to get into a game n its often a green rank.
---
Theres such a shortage of killers in red that youre put against people 5-8 ranks higher (3 vs rank 11) just to get you in.
---
Even as killer its either players vastly less skilled or greatly  more skilled youre paired with.  Shoulda focused on rank rewards to encourage  actual  competitiveness instead of servers
---
That's not the point though, I shouldn't HAVE to play a single killer to level up another killer.
---
Grabs are almost nonexistent.
---
No. They recieve the undetectable status when -cloaked-
---
Fredward is godly
---
You're right. It kicking alone does not add regression.
---
Whenever additional regression is added upfront, the generator appears to smoke and have orange sparks come out of it (which is why surge and pop goes the weasel causes the effect) so if kicking did add something, it's safe to assume that effect would trigger as well
---
I doubt Sony would allow Joel to be included on the Nintendo and Xbox versions though. But it would be epic.
---
Maybe a super detailed Bloater clown skin to go with the release
---
Thx
---
There's also a bug as survivor where you get stuck in 1 spot if someone tries healing you. Not even end game collapse fixes it. You're forced to leave the match.
---
Survivor is just a draining experience rn. I'm sure there's issues killers have but I haven't noticed as much from that perspective as I have when playing survivor.
---
In fact, I'm noticing myself hitting bullshit hits even when I'm playing killers
---
you learn to loop and don't cleanse, also gen rush, don't need to bother about healing, yeah, she is bad designed like 90% of this game 
---
about how it's fair: if you are at high ranks she is just wraith with one-shot, in low ranks she stomps because people waste so much time urban evasioning around the map searching for fountains to cleanse instead of doing gens and scaping
---
How dare you say OG Daddy Trapper is worse!
---
Yeah I can definitely see how that impacts killers a lot more than survivors
---
That raven haired Kate must of had an infinite cd DS for it to still be up after you hooked 2 other survivors.
---
Dont cleanse and loop that giant. You can see her over a lot of them.
---
Still have a bunch. If I get survivor dailies for survivors I don't normally use, I'll burn one just for shits n gigs.
---
Maybe its the huge belly.
---
You're either willfully ignoring the point or are genuinely unable to understand and both are a pitiful look on you
---
ok
---
Ok well let me address the criticism then. This game CANT have an unranked mode, plain and simple. With such a small player base, matches already take ages to find, splitting the player base between 2 playlists will destroy queue times even further, rendering the game nearly unplayable, as lobbies take upwards of an hour to fill and casual players just drop out entirely. It‚Äôs just not something a small game like this can handle
---
There's that 12 year old tantrum, look if you are seriously that mad over the internet I'll do you a favor and leave you alone to pout in the corner. Hopefully one day you'll grow up, cool down, maybe get a big boy job, then we can go back to talking if you need some closure. Until then, bye
---
Or just take the loss and let the others feel good about what just happened
---
When will we get crossplay from console to pc?
---
I have that freddy glove
---
I play clown because I find his power satisfying
---
The game is very confusing at first but once you play it and get used to it, it‚Äôs not that confusing. I don‚Äôt have any tips because everyone already said what I was going to recommend, so good luck out there man, hope you enjoy the game!
---
I've seen her exactly once in red ranks since the rework and have played around 100 games since then. She used to be in at least 1/5 games before the rework. I can tell you I've tried playing her without addons and she's completely miserable. The cooldown ruined her and her base move speed is pathetic. Unless you were already really good with her nobody is enjoying playing her currently. Many top streamers claim she is still the best killer but your average player has shelved her for easier and more fun killers.
---
Killer is not hard at all. Playing an fps game and then playing killer in this is hilarious. You don't even need to aim because hitboxes are a joke. Majority of killers are braindead to play and only actually take skill against the sweatiest of SWF. 
---
Nothing in this game is hard to play really.
---
We need more people like u to tell us what deleted comments said
---
I dont wanna burn it, too precious its like a time capsule
---
Like Stalin

Thank you random citizen

* Checks behind me *
---
Monto, puppers, N00b3 are some content creators but there‚Äôs so many more
---
"Head on"... MmmmMmm yes...
---
Unrelenting?
---
No its not, leave them slugged and chase the person making the saves. Not only do you slow game progressions anyways since 1 slug =1 less person working on gens/saves , you also waste one of their perk slots. Sure they could also be rocking unbreakable but thats now 2 wasted perk slots which is an over all win for you because they still need to slug for a bit.
---
Good job bro
---
Bubba is a significantly worse version of billy. Billy‚Äôs speed and maneuverability is what makes him good. Bubba is only good if survivors are dumb and try to save when bubba is near
---
Skill check lag is a real issue
---
Very common now. One of my favorite things to do as killer is run a secret offering like a splinter. They dc because they think it was a mori but really it was a perkless add on less killer.
---
This gives off Tokyo Ghoul vibes
---
You recover from missing attacks with main attacks not lunges or specials, by 20% for tier I
---
Monto is a solid choice since he explains every perk that he runs before starting a game, Otzdarva is one of the best killer mains on Youtube, he has a vast selection of Tips and Tricks for newcomers \[He is more active in his secondary channel NotOtzdarva\] and ZubatLeL is the best killer main i know, he doesn't explain too much though \[he livestreams and posts some games in his channel\]
---
Curious, my mikes are usually pretty tame, mostly i find hags with it funny enough
---
I just ran BP offerings, no moris or map offerings :/
---
Yes bubba is a worse killer than billy.
---
alright, you have my attention. why do you think alert is better than both spine chill and premonition?
---
I'm aware of that but the problem of not being able to play certain killers because I did well with another killer is a problem wouldn't you agree?
---
and your friend got was he deserved, very satisfying
---
It's a mix of crashes and dickhead survivors.
---
Excuse you? How do you even know if I was camping? You act like you were in the match or something. I hooked steve and the meg was trying to sneak but I saw her. I tried to feral frenzy her but missed. While i was turning, I was the claud sneaking behind a very small tree that you see in the clip, now that the meg is gone I decided to chase the claud instead since there's no windows or structures to the left. If the claud would of lead me away from the hook, steve would of been unhooked by the meg which is fine since I need hits and hooks to max out my categories. Claud instead decided to give me a free hook in reward of unhooking steve with borrowed (if she had it idk). As you saw, that didn't go to plan. That was my whole thought process during this. So nice try but no, camping was not the intent and it did not happen.
---
M1 is Mouse 1, Left Mouse Click, its your Basic attack.
---
M1 has been adopted by the community towards killers that mainly use their basic attacks. A.K.A basivally 90% of the killers xD
---
You guys need to dream big with the killer. 
---
David. David would DEFINITELY be the scariest choice for the last of us chapter. 
---
Just picture minding your own business and then you see David doing that creepy hoppy stealth run at you with a giant machete.
---
I don‚Äôt mean worse, I mean harder to play against vs every billy I‚Äôve played against
---
Probably to turn invisible during chases and have walhax
---
Both
---
I really want Jason in the game. Instead of add-ons, he has an arsenal of recreational weapons, lol.
---
XD I‚Äôll post another without the OwO‚Äôs if I can find the original lol
---
Everything resets it's really not that bad. What I usually do is save up blood points until I get tired and then prestige. The clothing is cool
---
clearly latency just look how u lagged back
---
Plot twist: you used irdescent head.
---
Yeah, but still... Kinda meh.
---
Oh I see it now. Originally I only saw the O above her head and the O on the top left ima use one ty
---
I dont mind his powers but he shouldnt have gen slowdowns.
---
Hillbilly, leatherface, huntress....all have repair speed add ons, all have to hit the survivors to apply that effect.
---
Old freddy at least had to get close to the survivors and put them asleep.
---
New freddy can be afk on the other side of the map and survivors will still get a repair speed debuff after 60 seconds. It feels unfair. He does nothing to earn it.
---
You get freddy with swing chains, and the add in that has everyone start asleep. Throw in Ruin too. Gens go really slow from the start and if you miss a skill check what little progress you made gets reset. Add on dying light, thanatophobia and sloppy too.
---
Yeah Freddy can be as dull as Legion almost. Like I said im fine with his snares, pallets and teleport but Forever Freddy is just boring as hell to play against.
---
Prestige makes so you start from zero like one perk at a time and stuff, also you lose your items and perks, you get the bloody cloth and in the next blood webs you get better items and add on
---
Suddenly I respect scoops ahoy Steve
---
Lol np
---
Don‚Äôt worry, soon as Spirit gets an Original Recipe fisting from the Ol‚Äô Nerf Hammer, Freddy won‚Äôt be long behind her. There‚Äôs a very vocal minority that constantly whines about whichever killer is the most ‚Äúbroken‚Äù until they get nerfed, and then it‚Äôs on to the next killer. Same thing happens with a vocal Killer minority complaining about survivor tools constantly
---
I never see a reason to send toxic messages but at the same time maybe you should buy a new controller before playing dbd since your controler does not seem to work
---
Lol
---
Legion + sloppy + thanat + dying light + ruin + add ons that cause more slowdowns.
---
Hes far better than Bubba and you can even kill the survivors by boring them to death
---
Let me know what killer or survivor I should do next
---
It‚Äôs only every other week I have to use it so I‚Äôm fine most of the time
---
To be fair, tipping is something that no one outside of America does, like ever.
---
Before Freddy, map offerings came in common, uncommon, and rare. The common and uncommon ones didn't really increase that chances to go to that map by very much and they were just bloating the bloodwebs, so they got rid of them.
---
It is. It really shouldn't affect you if you have had a meathook through your sternum for 30 seconds after it procs.

It's basically a free escape for survivors. It's survivor noed in that it provides an incredible power bump at the end of the game, so it can be incredibly frustrating.

Eh she‚Äôs not amazing, she‚Äôs up there with Spirit still though.

Ohhh! I was wondering why I never got them. Thank you! Should have kept them so I could buy them for cheaper instead of spending more BP on other items during Tier 1 &amp; 2 BP Web

I really don't understand how someones genuine opinion on cosmetics can garner damn near 20 dislikes.

What is the message? It‚Äôs unclear what the ‚Äúmessage‚Äù would even do besides spell you out as a jerk

I know the go to for her are the straps and videotape, but I was wondering what were the value of the box addons, as in how much do they decrease the timer or difficulty in numbers ect.
---
Well bro you posted this 7 minutes ago how fast am I supposed to reply XD, try leveling up another survivor tho, he‚Äôll have his special perks and the other caracter you prestige
---
I just tell people they are aids and move on.
---
Smart people buy at the end.
---
I like Thrilling Tremors on Freddy, hook a survivor, teleport over to an unblocked gen, hit it with pop and hit another survivor. Rinse, repeat, win
---
he is a good killer, good survivors can beat him.
---
When I said they suck i mean power wise they can't compete at high ranks as they are too slow and have no map pressing abilities and thus stand no chance against high rank survivors.
---
its almost like its ironic. weird.
---
proxy camping?
---
Good question. I'm thinking a two-fold power something along the lines of a loud shattering screech that could reveal survivors within his terror radius, but also maybe an aggrivated state where he runs around (I guess kind of like bubba). Or maybe he could get 1% movement speed every time somebody looks him in the face (like trying to reveal GF).
---
Safe the Best for Last.
---
Well considering you lose everything when you prestige you should try to save up 1 million BP so you can instantly get to level 35+ when you prestige. Just use all your items while you‚Äôre banking your BP.
---
You have no intelect.
---
Thanks for showing 106 face now we're all gonna die.

I commented it before looking at the other comments dumbass

Can't stand trapper it's just a shitty way to go u know.

 4 survivors hooked in the basement

Survivor 1: what u all in for?
---
Survivor 2: I got bloodlusted
---
Survivor 3: I got mind gamed 
---
Survivor 4: i just got out played what about u 
---
survivor 1: I walked in some grass
---
Specifically, it does 3 things
---
* Grants you one item of the character bloodied outfit.
---
* Resets your level to 1, removing any unused items, add-ons, offerings, and all earned perks.
---
* Grants a slight increase in item rarity in prestige bloodwebs. 
---
The rarity increase is apparently very slight, I'm not sure of the exact numbers, but it's not much. 
---
One other thing is teachable perks. If you have purchased the teachables for a character then they are unlocked permanently, regardless of whether you prestige. However, if you don't actually but them, you'll need to wait for the appropriate level (30,35,40) to unlock them for purchase again.
---
Plague's power is entirely dependent on Survivors.
---
Not cleansing? She becomes a tall ass M1 Killer with Exposed, she is still loopable and anyone else should be powering through gens.
---
Someone cleansed? well no point in staying sick, try to cleanse at the furthest fountains from the generators being worked on so she has to go out of her way to get it and to bring it back which is precious time. try your best to dodge the super vomit.
---
i think ranks don't really equal skills.  
---
it more like ranks equals time played  
---
instead of matchmaking BHVR should work on how to rank players then fix matchmaking
---
I definitely respect your opinion but I find it highly subjective to say that scp-096 is not popular. In fact, I would argue that he's one of the more recognizable SCPs.
---
By the nature of colorblindness, and the very drab pallet of tones used to make this game, it would make survivors and scratch marks much easier to see for killer players who are colorblind and not alike. The difference wouldn't be negligible at all, especially considering how important hiding and stealth are in this game. That being said, I don't think colorblind people should be excluded like they're right now, that's just not cool.
---
What are these 3 killers that are only viable at high rank?
---
If you don‚Äôt have Enduring take off Spirit Fury. Spirit Fury is borderline useless without Enduring to combo with it. 
---
If you don‚Äôt have Enduring take off NoED for something else. Monitor and Abuse if you have it but if you don‚Äôt have a lot of teachables Sloppy Butcher could work.
---
It‚Äôs pretty terrible. I have messages blocked and stopped reading them because they were almost all shitty and mean. Every now and again I get a nice message but it is mostly a dumpster fire. People are the fucking worst.
---
Not Otzdarva and Monto are great when trying to learn the game, Monto does builds and he explains what every item and perk does. Not Otzdarva is a killer main and I‚Äôd recommend watching him if you‚Äôre going to play killer. He commentates everything he does and how he does it, he gives really good advice on how to play certain killers and builds. He is very good if you want to play killer I highly recommend you watch him so you can learn. Good luck out there.
---
If you decide you want to main killer and you got the hang of it, you should watch ZubatLEL he is in my opinion the best killer main in the game. And you can kinda watch how he plays, although he doesn‚Äôt explain a lot he is just fun to watch.

I didn't think that one through...

thats not because of the plague then. git gud.
---
Why bully though? It's just mean.
---
Yeah. The killers are shifting into the Trappers model for stepping out of his trap
---
God forbid a Killer can't be run around in circles, right?
---
I was trying to surviveeee &gt;:( 
---
He was red ranks . It‚Äôs not my fault he was bad and I could bully him
---
r/wholesomememes
---
just tried that and it didn't work :(
---
Unless they're already working on it, in which case the killer knows what to prioritize
---
Literally
---
It really do be like that. I've had three gens pop in 3 and half minutes with Ruin on.  They literally escaped in like, 7 and half minutes without even bothering with ruin.
---
They look just fine on my Adam. They're just on the coat
---
Interesting. I find Purples to be just as sweaty as reds tbhs I will admit there is more variety of killers but it's super sweat in purples cause they wanna get to reds

Brutal, Fire Up, Pop, Corrupt with break add on and the gen aura add on.

Id say spirit,nurse and billy u can argue for more but these are unarguably the best in the game atm.

This.

I can tell people aren't really reds when they say shit like "ITS JUST SPIRIT, BILLY AND NURSE" like.. nah it's got variety here too bro

Fire up is an interesting choice. I can't wait to run Corrupt on him once I get tier 3.
---
The whole show just screams middle school edge. I tried to get through the pilot but it was just too cringey. I feel like all the creator's effort went into designing characters that people could make into smut on deviant art rather than the actual writing.
---
Tbh most killers aren't hard to play at all. I got rank 1 as killer within a week of owning the game.
---
Welp. Get ready to get slugged when there's two people left. Cause that happens literally every game.
---
The thing I hate about Freddy is that he‚Äôs a jack of all trades with no real drawbacks. He has insane map pressure, he can shut down loops, and he has slowdowns from his addons. He specialises in everything. He‚Äôs fun to play as for sure, but to play against he‚Äôs a real slog. The dreamworld is more annoying than scary. I just think the real problem comes from using slowdown perks with him along with his addons (infinite Freddy). It‚Äôs awful.
---
I don‚Äôt think he needs to be nerfed in any way, despite my frustrations. He just synergies too well with slowdown perks and that‚Äôs not something you can really nerf. Freddy on his own is fine, just a top tier killer. Freddy with PGTW/ dying light/ ruin/ sloppy etc is literally a nightmare.
---
I‚Äôm just coming back from a long break but apparently I‚Äôm going to have to take another one. Perhaps permanently. I love the game but it‚Äôs been bugged to shit since launch and it has only gone from bug to bug as time goes on.

I'd rather fix the ranking system and gen rushing.

yes I'll take my down-votes to go, no you can keep the receipt, thanks!

Im perfectly fine with getting two kills as killer (from my knowledge this is a average game) but ofc a killer wants to 4k thats their objective i could say ‚Äúsurvivors just want to 4man escape every game and thats the lowest they‚Äôll accept‚Äù and it would be true bc escaping is their objective.

Mathematically BBQ is better since BBQ basically tells you where everyone is and can proc up to 12 times, where as bitter murmur can proc 5 times and probably isnt going to give you as much info.
---
EDIT:And BP is a big thing to.
---
BBQ is a bloodpoint perk that happens to have a strong tracking ability
---
Bitter murmur doesnt grant bloodpoints and has less uses than BBQ overall.
---
I don‚Äôt think it needs a nerf , a slight change because a sluggin on both sides is unfun plus the survivor side becomes a a-hole when he get unhook with ds like try me
---
Oh... Your comment looks like you already did

Of course everyone wants to fulfil their objective. When talking about balancing a game tho you should not be biased to the side you clearly play more of

I have my settings adjusted so no one can contact me unless I'm their friend. I play survivor AND killer and do my upmost to have a fun and clean game, but I'll still get toxic messages from sore losers or other shitty teammates.

Why do I regularly 4k with him at rank 1 then? Just because a killer isn't as strong/ easy to 4k with as spirit doesn't mean they're trash.

It synergies well with Michaels addon that gives faster stalk on the obsession (Judith‚Äôs journal I think?) as well as Dying Light. In general it‚Äôs a semi decent perk on Myers. I haven‚Äôt seen other uses for it. It‚Äôs not the reduced terror radius in chases that makes it worth taking, it‚Äôs the new obsession. Still not amazing tho
---
Why *do* we look at them, not like we're cleaning the blood most of the time
---
Not his addons. Just the gen slowdown addon. Gen slowdown is fine, but if you stack them up its not. They just have to make so that there is a hard cap to genslowdown or something to limit it to an endurable degree. Atm i just dc when other people do, or get his attention so i run around not having to work with the undoable gens

I play both sides, but more so survivor at least atm. (My survivor rank is 3 and killer rank is 8 atm ik ranks dont matter but im js as evidence lol)
---
He almost never uses that perk up though? He uses STBFL in almost every trapper build and he is a trapper main so.
---
Same here. I try to play as clean as possible, but some immature idiot (who doesn't police their own emotions) will always send a stupid message. If I get angry and want to send a message because someone did something dumb, I try to remember it is a game and will not impact my real life. Just trying not to stress over small stuff anymore lol.

5 gen and a dc. This just a cleanup phase

You can criticize, and I‚Äôm allowed to give an opinion. You‚Äôre still not going to get a princess path, you‚Äôre a grown ass gamer and grind it like the others.

Our history is smoke. Blurred by dreams. Guided by Ghosts. A voice, a void, lurks inside you, it's purpose not yet shown. But what am I?
---
My father was a farmer. My mother a carpenter Given light by the Golden Lords, to build for them... a better world. But my family's journey was long. Time began to change their light. Creativity. Pride. A will to live.
---
So the Golden wrath came. And after, I was born. A mimic, a spy. Conceived to burrow into nests and swallow the pitch-eggs of their war machine. The Tenno. But when I saw your tender faces, I took mercy. Or so we were told. But in truth, we were both imprisoned in Lua's belly. My light remade by the creators. I became a memory, a ghost. Reprogrammed to destroy my family, my people, my history.

Windstorm is easy mode, just bodyblock the shit out of survivors for first hits and block windows/pallets to deny em for 2nd hits or if they're in the open
---
tell that to the red stain clipping through walls on low graphics
---
Finally some delicious memes
---
I agree Windstorm is a must. I also sometimes use the bone clapper but I don't know if it's necessary since I can usually get a free first hit with some clever body blocking. I'm thinking of switching ruin out with corrupt intervention once I can get it at tier 3. If I had Nurses I'd definitely run a slowdown build with Sloppy, Thanat, and Dying Light.
---
ah, well i mean if you know there are survivors there i dont see why you wouldnt.
---
Hitbox are the same for everyone. Its just that female survs except jane dont fully fit their hitbox
---
[It belongs in a museum](https://youtu.be/lFmhRLiYho0)

The main skill I've learned from playing Wraith is body blocking for free first hits. It's so damn easy.

This could have been a Play With Your Food meme took.

Contrary to popular belief red ranks is overall a good experience. Youd find your old tricks countered and more chance of a real team. Entitled still exist but it's generally better with less dc
---
Finally a non-legion cosplay!
---
Everyone has to be on the same sheet of music. Either everyone cleanse or no one cleanse. Simple as that.
---
He barely ever uses that?
---
Of course, typical response
---
Thanks all for your advice I will definitely check out these guys.
---
that is a great idea, make the killers learn to communicate.  Dude you might have just made legion better or worse depending on the 4man.
---
Less DC? Lmfao bullshit. 4 games in a row I had people DC on me today as survivor at rank 1. Red rank players care less about losing a pip from DC because they know they can earn it back.
---
Can confirm. Was in a haddonfield game last week where I still had two boxes left to check before my timer popped. I did get chased in the middle of one search however.
---
This was with jigsaws sketch and tampered timer. 
---
Edit: addons
---
Found otz‚Äôs reddit account
---
It gets so sweaty.
---
what servers are you by? it takes me ~45 to que as killer :(
---
This is the best video on this sub
---
It wouldn't be op i mean a well coordinated legion team wouldn't be any different from a well coordinated SWF team.
---
Not sure about console but on PC red ranks generally make you wanna stop playing survivor. Be prepared for the sweatiest killers in existence.
---
what. how. what the fuck. how is a base m1 killer with no movement power the best? what? hello?
---
I keep hearing this ‚Äúmore game modes‚Äù thing and I like the ideas but in reality everybody already complains about queue times and this would only serve to make them worse.
---
Who's that?
---
Put it this way - Whenever I get red ranks as survivor I stop playing survivor for a while and just go back to killer.
---
I think both of those ideas would make Clown at least Lower Middle Tier, which is better than his current standing.

YES. i agree he's the perfect killing machine. hag is cheap too, but she's not as fun. she teleports around, but wraith ziiips around, especially with the snake addon that makes him even faster. lol dont worry your pop will be back soon, he just left to get cigarettes
---
her vacuum is only heard by you when you are outside of the Terror Radius, meaning if you're in a chase with her, that is no longer an indication of her phasing, not to mention prayer beads being a thing that removes that entirely.
---
Unless you're assuming the cross map blind hatchets are anything but pure luck, they are just once in a blue moon cheeky hits and never the norm for the typical Huntress. Huntress is the simplest form of 50/50 mindgames when it comes to the standard loop; survivor throws pallet while Huntress winds up she gets a hit, survivor keeps running while she winds up they get another run around the loop, survivor keeps running past pallet while Huntress does too she catches up and gets a guaranteed hit, Huntress keeps running while survivor throws the pallet she gets stunned. That's literally 50/50 mindgame on trying to figure out who is going to do what in the loop and the outcome being entirely on who outsmarts who.
---
In a chase with Spirit you don't hear her phase, all you see is her standing still, which can be her phasing or her standing there watching you run into her or leave the safety of the loop. When she does phase; she has your pain grunts, normal breathing if she's running Stridor which tons of Spirits are doing which also counters Iron Will, see/hear grass movement, feel you run into her, hear footsteps, and on top of that of course scratch marks.
---
Like you are objectively being incorrect by saying you can hear her vacuum 24/7 and that her only way of tracking you in phase is scratch marks.
---
90% of the time I play against a killer using a skin that isn't prestige, is the clown.

What if they did it like Overwatch where the queue is shared and you get put into a random game mode?
---
Calling it now
---
After spirit nerf we'll get another killer to complain about, weird enough, someone viable in high ranks. In the list there's freddy, GF and billy.
---
It happened few months ago, asking for Billy to have 110%ms, do somebody remember that? I do..
---
In all honestly, the easiest killer for me to get to red ranks with is Leatherface. Run bamboozle on him and his power has very little counterplay.
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* **If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)**
---
 
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
&gt;* **New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.**
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

---
If you cannot do that, the killer is clearly op. It's illegal to have viable killers! Come on, you should know that
---
Probably swf
---
Well I replied with a lot more than that. Like are you saying her phase noise is supposedly a tell for her power. Since I really don't know where you're getting at with that since you objectively can't use that as an indication while in a chase with her.
---
I'm red rank surv on ps4 and pc (two different friend groups, BHVR loves my wallet) and the killers used is drastically different. On ps4 its almost exclusively spirit, to the point where once I counted 11 spirits in a row, 7 with ebony mori (yaay..). If its not spirit it's been a freddy or Ghostface. Billy seems to have fell out of fashion.
---
PC it's a much larger array of killers being used, but I want to say the ones I see least are Doctor and Hag. Lots of Michaels though, but they all have the new skin so that explains that. Nurse used to be extremely common, but since Sally got the nerf bat she's a lot mess common.
---
28 and I started at 10
---
I got a ‚Äúgg boomer‚Äù one game and I‚Äôm so confused lol
---
Marley ffs.
---
Also imagine bragging the game was easy when a wraith 3k's before the 3rd gen and youre using the hatch to "win" lul.
---
P3 Quentins. They are a horrifying unassuming bunch. I dont know why it's them in particular, but it is indeed a thing.
---
I have never played fortnite and never will, I'm sorry you are such a toxic person though.
---
Been a while since I played Overwatch but that would make sense if there was a playerbase that size for DBD. The only way I could see it working is as a limited time event. Do the 2 killer mode for a few weeks and then drop it and bring it (or something else new) back later on. That way queue times would be disrupted but once the hype for the mode dies down the player base won‚Äôt be split between people who want vanilla DBD and people who wanna play the new mode.
---
Like the survivors mains who posts about spirit at least 50 times a day?
---
Kinda like it happened for Freddy at launch? Or just legion. After all, all you need to do is DC to make BHVR nerf whatever people want
---
Even though I'm a Jason fanboy, Trapper is cooler imo
---
Both, both is good
---
Which map is this?
---
I bought my favourite nurse cosmetic even though I cannot play nurse and probably never will because I'm on console. Everyday I am haunted by my poor life choices.
---
Im sorry not necessarily windstorm but any ms addon from yellow will do. Other addons are for fun and change of style. Reapearance addon will make you super powered. 
---
Dying helps the survivor more than it helps you. Thana is just for legion and plague. Youre not meant to injure everyone as wraith. You can but your power wont help you whereas legion and plague does.
---
Sloppy is just so you have more time to see them with nurse.
---
funny!!
---
Does that count as a r/imsorryeveryone ?
---
That's honestly probably me next reset with Trapper. The rift did its job by forcing you to play Trapper and its kind of made me addicted lol. Trapper has such a laid back game play style that I love. You just lay down traps in one area really hard then herd survivors in that direction during chases and watch them run into your traps. Save the best for last is such an underrated perk too. Absolutely fun just hunting for stacks.
---
This would be a really cool perk lol
---
Love how people stopped talking about nurse even if she still the strongest killer
---
Whos next? Billy 110%ms like many people asked few months ago? Because is too easy to play
---
Or Freddy? Because his add ons are good. Mmmh maybe GF because isn't fair you cannot see the red stain by pressing one button. It's unfair you have even a slight disadvantage in a 1v1 situation against a killer (in an asymmetrical game)
---
All killers are OP at low ranks lol. Anyway, my one change suggestion would be to make broken survivors also have the oblivious status effect. This will make her more valuable against the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt cleanse ‚Äú meta and  also give her some stealth.
---
Yeah they're gonna buff up weaker killers for sure. It just takes a while. One step at a time. Theyre not as big as league of legends where they just buff nerf on a weekly basis.
---
*Everyone disliked that*
---
I can see your confusion. Poor pig.
---
Because BHVR knew if they did go nuts (like for Freddy on launch or legion) they'll get blasted. One of the most iconic and strongest killers reduced like legion would've just made people quit or burn BHVR HQ
---
With the others tho...
---
JUST A LITTLE BIT
---
Nah I disagree. Spine chill is great against any stealth killer but tier 1 myers. It doesnt activate half the time. You can be doing a gen with spine chill not lit up once and then out of nowhere Myers will pull you off the gen. Spine chill, you had 1 job.
---
Chest guardian Bubba cracks me up.
---
*What the flying fuck?*
---
So.. somebody still remember that. Looks like people forgot about that in the past 4months
---
Even ranks?
---
Impossible...
---
DCing is annoying but I get why some people do it, why keep playing if your getting so worked up that it‚Äôs unenjoyable? 
---
I‚Äôve had survivors who want to teabag/flashlight at every pallet, I‚Äôve had survivors group up with flashlights and all start blinding me at the same time, survivors who have the exit gates open but run around in the middle of the map making a ton of noise to bring me over so they can get chased out the gate. Killers who have Dying Light who just want to slug you the entire game so you don‚Äôt get the benefits of a perk THEY chose to play, (seriously spent an entire game on the ground) 
---
People on here want to act like they‚Äôve never been so frustrated that they‚Äôve DC‚Äôd or just give up mid game because they keep getting bullied. (tunneled, griefed, mori spammed, etc) 
---
Do what‚Äôs best for you. Like we all know, DBD is just a game but it can still be mentally frustrating and can take a toll on you. If you‚Äôre on the other end of the DC just move on and queue up for your next game. 
---
Also it‚Äôs 1,000% annoying &amp; uncalled for when people DC because they got caught first, or their hex totems were destroyed in the first 3 minutes of a game. I‚Äôm not condoning those kinds of DC‚Äôs.
---
Yeah, strong killers with great counterplay are a problem
---
Only prayer beads are a real issue on her, maybe stridor to an extent. The game is better with a variety of strong killers who do different things. I‚Äôd go as far as to say that spirit offers some of the most counterplay than any killer
---
Ok boomer.
---
Im a rank 3 surv rank 4 killer. Thana instead of ruin legion. Empathy, hunch, windows opp, inner strength as surv. I rarely get camped, mostly tunneled but i just do what i can. If i die i die.Feel free to avoid the possibility its your plays, im just a guy pooping on the toilet
---
Nothing wrong with his hitbox, it just seems a bit wonky because he's so small
---
Well Hag needs a s n a c c, and Demogorgon does it purely to scare his prey and make them mess up.
---
Cute
---
I spent literally 5min to find out everything you said is bs and she's not a pedophile while people just did go nuts for.. wait for it.. **DRAWINGS**
---
Yeah I was thinking if somebody looks at him directly it gives him maybe like a five-second extra sprint duration so it would kind of force people to not look directly at a him in a chase.
---
But yeh, when a survivor looks directly at him (from the front or sides) he'll be frozen 3 seconds only able to turn his camera, during this 3 seconds he'll screech and reveal all survivors in his terror radius causing them to scream like infectious fright. For the next 60 seconds, he'll go into a fit of rage and have increased movement speed. During this rage, he'll be able to vault faster and break pallets faster, but breaking a pallet drops 10 seconds from his rage and vaulting drops 15 seconds (he'll get 1 second off his action speed). If he is hit by a pallet, he'll be stunned for 2 seconds (with an animation of him throwing a fit and breaking the pallet) and lose 20 seconds of rage. If he catches a survivor he will instant down them and refill his rage by 20 seconds. (I think it would be cool to remove his ability to see scratch marks and blood and replace this with the "killer instinct" proc.) At the end of the 60 seconds of rage he'll immediately stop, (after he's finished an animation like vaulting a window) sit on the ground, and cry for 5 (maybe more) seconds sending his power on cool down for 2 minutes (at base).
---
As a killer main, I love it when this happens.  Gotta remember, this is just a video game, and the whole point is to enjoy it.  This isn't frustrating, this is a learning experience.  I drop into a map and stumble across a survivor that's so good that they can completely avoid me for *that* long, then I need to be paying close attention to every little move that person makes.  I'm sitting here behind my screen with my hockey mask up takin' notes is what I'm doing.  *Chasing* good survivors is how you learn to *catch* good survivors.  They're gonna get a thanks and a GG from me in the end no matter how it turns out.
---
"But if I spend all that time chasing one person, I won't win!"
---
So what?  I can guarantee you that the ghost of Ed McMahon is **not** gonna show up on yer doorstep and surprise you with a million dollar check just because you can consistently "hit red ranks" in Dead by Daylight.  You win some, you lose some, man‚Äîjust enjoy it.
---
I've never heard of them. I even figured i just dont know the numbers that well, so i googled it and saw some base zombie looking thing. Thats a no.
---
The thing where u can't blink or it kills you is 10000x more recognizable then that
---
Spine Chill allows me to both be lazy and understand what the killer is doing.
---
Thanatophobia feels like its ran more to get people to cleanse than actually slow gen speed
---
Oh ok. Because I thought only a killer who camps themselves would be so oblivious to ask a question about the survivors incapabillity even though THEY ARE LITERALLY ON A HOOK BEING STARED AT. It might be my fault to be hooked in the first place, but don't come at me with "git gud" when it comes to camping.
---
Is that a fucking capybara
---
I did, It was meant to be sarcastic. I forgot about the /s though.
---
Look at true talent then. Oh wait.. it doesn't fit your agenda right?
---
Ok buddy
---
I mean, you gotta respect the 4%...
---
No problem, I hope it can run dbd because the game is really fun!
---
If youre on the hook being stared at. Those are rare occasions
---
STBFL, Surge, Surv, and uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Infectious fright on Michael and hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?mmmmmmmmmmm. Whispers on pig ... maybe.
---
While I do believe that the Hit and Run killer should come back in some way, shape or form, Freddy had a bunch of hang-ups that prevented him from being viable with that playstyle (mostly the dream transition).
---
I'd love to see The Poacher or whoever who could shoot people with tracking darts come back with a similar approach, but maybe not Freddy.
---
Had a game the other night. One got away, barely, last one was on ground, hooked him, dead.
---
Me:gg 
---
Guy who escaped:gg, sorry couldn't save
---
Guy who died: "rRRREeeEEeeeEeeee" (along the lines of that) "tunneled me whole game"
---
He died on 2nd hook, I chased him probably 3 times in a 15ish minute match
---
you sluts. me 2
---
Find out who named it and look them up.
---
Wait for people saying "it's on console doesn't count" or " she just shit " in the com.. wait they are already here
---
I wonder if you link truetalent videos on PC will be invalidated in the same way
---
Same thing if you link **any** person counterplay a spirit.. the entitlement
---
Doesnt apply to vault speed and no. Why take spine chill when I can take DS.
---
no, he meant sole survivor. so the killer can't see you. ooo would be useless
---
r/photoshopbattles says it was :v
---
We do have a ban system implemented.
---
First time I played Michael Myers I got a 4k because someone was at the gate and close enough to crawl out was trying to hide behind a wall in the gate area and I one tapped them and won
---
I'd go as far as to say that you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Rank 20 vs rank 20
---
Should be a Stranger Things scenario where we get both Joel and Ellie, with The Clicker as the chapter's killer.
---
It's just a shame The Last of Us is owned by Sony, who *definitely* wouldn't want to put their exclusive characters on other consoles, unlike Valve

This. I dont know what happened post dedicated servers, but my killer queues are minimum 10 minutes. I started played TOME while waiting for a game. Oddly, tonight my survivor queues were taking more than 5 minutes. Not sure how long I can keep going with plenty of other games to play.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel. Nasty combo with BBQ because of his gen teleport.
---
Southeast Asia?
---
I don't disagree with anything other than SC not helping in a chase. it's actually still super useful.
---
it just doesn't help actual mindgames.
---
of which, spirit has none.
---
I mostly play killer but when I do play survivor, I run Scooper Steve with spine chill and erroneous perks because of how ridiculously strong it can be when faced against your typical bloodlust R2s.
---
as for killer, I just try to play like everyone is always running it lol
---
it really is super strong and I absolutely love it on both sides.
---
but yes, in spirit's case it doesn't do jack diddly for countering anything other than gen grabs.
---
Holy shit this is a fucking throwback, thank you for reminding me of this
---
This looks like a soldier version of lesion that went crazy
---
Shit you‚Äôre right. Should of put her actual name Sam Dean
---
Ah you‚Äôre the reason I have to keep letting survivors repair all the gens and escape
---
Letting them do gens and camping 3 gens close together all match is hardly a ‚Äútactic‚Äù is it. 
---
Perks like blood warden actually require some effort, with noed, all you have to do is wait and hope they havnt cleansed all dull totems
---
Sam Dean from Daybreak
---
&gt;give disconnectors a 30 minute ban

Then:

"*guys, why can't I find a game? its been 30 minutes searching?!!?! bhvr fix pls*"

be excited for longer queues and insta DC's just hope the sweaty killer gives u mercy (also bigger influx of spirit)

Finally made Rank 4 as a survivor last week, just to get clapped back to Rank 5 by back to back Legions of all things.
---
I used to be a rank 1 killer and I distinctly remember it was so ass.  So I got busy for a while and stopped playing.  Next time I get on I‚Äôve been de ranked to 20.  Haven‚Äôt gotten past 15 yet since I‚Äôm short on time, but I kinda wish I was at least rank 10 so it was a challenge.  It‚Äôs no fun when all of the survivors have practically no idea what they‚Äôre doing half the time.
---
It already takes a while to find a game for some. This would be problematic, as the player base doesnt seem big enough for that.
---
This. Nurse is still really good but we‚Äôve just forgotten about her I guess
---
When you dream of being in DBD but your franchise is in lawsuit hell.
---
That's funny, I said the same thing.
---
Freddy is a Killer that can be seen, stealthed by, and looped. Snares force early pallet throws and dream pallets can trick the unwary and asleep yes, but he is still an M1 Killer and he is still loopable.
---
If the Survivors play smart as a team, they can beat Freddy just like they can beat Max Jr.
---
This is literally my first time hearing about him lol
---
It‚Äôs better to wait longer for decent matches than have dcs every game.
---
You knocked her into next week
---
Yeah I remember that. I do think it's because this sub is kind of killer sided though. Amongst more survivor sided circles her "un-outplayableness" has always been talked about. I feel like even though this sub has a lot of killer players, even the killers started playing a little bit of survivor and realized that the people bitching about spirit had some fair points. Honestly when she came out I was in killer mode 100% and saw nothing wrong with her. Then I went back into my survivor phase and realized what all the fuss was all about.
---
&gt;Uhhh. Id gladly wait longer to find a game than get paired with a player that likes to disconnect..
---
*i'D gLadLy WaIt LoNgEr*
---
Yeah, this is you. The majority of the community would rather just play the game instead of sitting in queue for even longer than already is. Not to mention streamers that would be streaming lobby simulator. 
---
Do you not see the daily 10+ threads we get of people complaining they can't find a game?
---
trapper is a territorial killer; he isn't played like your typical Wm1.
---
he really isn't half bad if you don't mind losing a gen or two while you're setting up your early game. definitely not legion/pig tier by any means.
---
he's strong, but he just has a someehat specific playstyle that you sorta have to follow or you'll have a bad time.
---
plus knowledge of good trap placements and time management are a definite bonus.
---
if you have doubts, I'd recommend watching Otzdarva, a really good trapper player, to provide further insight into how trapper plays.
---
Doesn‚Äôt ring a bell
---
that second tweet was from like 2-3 months I believe?  SO hopefully something coming soon
---
Lol killer needs a buff but when you can beat a rank 1 object 4 man with brand new parts with a no-ruin trapper... it's by no mrwna called out freenwin.
---
I agree, NOED hurts the early game for killers, but against an altruistic team it‚Äôs the best perk late game. 
---
I‚Äôm only a rank 2-3 killer, don‚Äôt use NOED all too much but have played quite a few NOED Nurse games before because it‚Äôs broken especially with her.
---
Nurse can easily patrol gates even if they are far away (maybe less so with omega blink nerf). Nurse also shouldn‚Äôt be able to be looped. 
---
The hatch is irrelevant unless they have a key, and I like to let last surv escape anyway so it doesn‚Äôt matter if they get the hatch or not.
---
When the final generator pops, you *are* guaranteed to get at least one (if they have time to finish a gen, you‚Äôre probably chasing someone or patrolling) unless you‚Äôre inexperienced with nurse, and by the time they‚Äôre hooked, you know someone will be on an exit gate (but not have time to finish it) so you go straight to them. Again, as an experienced nurse you should be able to find whoever started it. You find them and hook them, as the other guy is getting unhooked. You blink back over, and are almost guaranteed to find one of the two, so you hook them too. By this time a gate is gonna be open. The smart thing to do is all leave and let whoever is hooked die, but altruistic survs tend to screw that over here and get in a cycle of getting hooked like before. 
---
The only perks that can stop this situation really are DS and BT.
---
I‚Äôve talked myself around, NOED is only good the majority of the time to get maximum one kill and a couple hooks unless the survs are really bad. But if you manage to get a kill earlier in the game, that‚Äôs usually at least a pip, so people will keep playing this way
---
You can hide the chat, I believe.
---
EA raised them so well
---
&gt;It‚Äôs better to wait longer for decent matches than have dcs every game.
---
A lot of people disagree with that, specially streamers.
---
Don't try to sound logic on here.
---
I‚Äôm aware, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the servers, not people actually intentionally DCing
---
did they reveal what spirit looked like before the entity?
---
Well I found a Vizio 40 inch 4k HDR 60hz smart tv for $240 at walmart.....its a smart TV yet it's pretty cheap. . ...u think I should get it ? 60 hz is good enough isn't it ?
---
Mrs. ‚Äúugh so op‚Äù pre patch 3.3.1?
---
This. I know slugging is boring, so I hate doing it. But the devs have made it the objectively correct play 95% of the time.
---
Blame the devs for making hatch (and d-strike) the way it is. I feel absolutely no shame for slugging as long as it takes when the game is designed this way. The devs have made it almost obligatory.
---
Remembering the first three words of a sentence is tough. I get it.
---
It was good on Old Paintbrush Freddy and Old Scratched Mirror Myers, but they don't exist anymore. :/
---
Nothing says ‚Äúfucking busted‚Äù like 5 perks
---
Swing and a miss.
---
Legion without ruin mains where we at?
---
3$ I just bought the demogorgon cause I'ma huge fan
---
True i feel,like there should be a downside i just cant think of any maybe slower action speeds
---
That‚Äôs like saying Bubba is specifically designed to camp the basement. That his strategy is to hook someone is the basement and wait.
---
Just because you can doesn‚Äôt mean you should
---
That‚Äôs awesome dude. Sucks that rank reset exists tho.
---
How to play Michael at high ranks: take mirror, burn an offering for an indoor map.  Scratched mirror on L√©ry's is best.
---
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any downside that could make having a 5th perk balanced, it‚Äôs just not something that should be considered honestly
---
The shoe should just have ‚Äúdedicated servers‚Äù written on it.
---
Because rank 1 still has a very wide skill range.
---
No need to crucify me guys. It was just a suggestion.
---
Ruin.bamboozle.bbq. noed
---
Yes
---
What's Demos animation after Hitting someone? I Missed it the last time I went against one, but his window vault scares me.
---
Whenever I get stuck looping the killer I have a strategy to run in a straight line as far as possible until he gets too close then I look for a pallet and try and get a stun and then repeat the straight line run. Use the environment and walls don‚Äôt run into a boxed off area of the map try and get distance from the killer
---
We are closer to getting this to be possible . Although it would need balancing.  Like  maybe in the mode every killer has an inherit mad grit effect just for hitting survivors.  Add more gens/hooks.  More resources for killers like trapper. 
---
Then some identity V things like the hook getting blocked for say 30 seconds so no one can save, no need to camp . Faster struggling and disabling of certain perks .  Buyable items to help the suvivor/killer.
---
6% at tier 3, only while the killer is looking at you.
---
it's because u cut the corner wide af when going into the building
---
I recommend going into a custom game with a friend and practicing. Try to get good with pallet stuns, 360s and skill checks. This is what I personally did when I first started playing and it actually helped me improve.
---
Not-so-fun fact: Resilience and Spine Chill decrease Dead Hard's dash distance.
---
alert
---
wow thanks
---
For the first time in my play time in 100 hours. A survivor gave himself away to be hooked by me. Helped me with my wraith daily. Thanks mate.
---
I'll try it out! Escaping the killer is honestly where I need the most help lol.
---
i have the same problem with fredward
---
its just due to how they dont have big weapons yet have the same reach as someone like huntress with a giant fucking axe
---
Gotta play Hag to Smack dat ass.
---
I really don't care about Pennywise, we have a clown already. I'd rather another original character tbh.
---
This is getting down-voted for no reason.   
---
Spirit is \*heavily\* complained about constantly, half the posts are people bitching about getting her nerfed, to the point where the sub became a circlejerk of "spirit op plz nerf"
---
Aftercare + Autodidact is a combo I like to use. When your linked with all 3 survivors with Aftercare and have 5 stacks of Autodidact you‚Äôre a straight up healbot lol.
---
Since you are rank 5-6 you should know how to use windows, pallets and your perks to create distance. Just keep practicing that, and you can also use your movement and camera to trick the killer to think you will be going one way, then choose the other way when they loose LOS(line of sight). LOS is your strongest weapon, be aware that you are 3rd person and killer is 1st person and killers tend to mistakes when they can‚Äôt see where you are. 
---
Eventually you are not supposed to put run killers  forever. You will go down sooner or later, the idea is to finish all gens and get out before you all died, so try to split up and do generators as much as possible. 
---
Also as a player who mostly play killers, I find most survivors before rank 5 not capable and I can win decisively most of the time. Just focus on doing as much as possible each game and try to rank up, once you reach red rank, your chance of escape will be much higher.
---
No thanks.
---
Better graphics, better frames just off the top of my head.
---
This has been happening to me too, literally halfway or towards the end of every match it either lags horribly or kicks me out entirely.
---
&gt;That is my opinion and sure you can disagree but it doesn‚Äôt mean you represent the majority. Also I don‚Äôt think streamers words has higher weights than any of us. if the game is more healthy, it is likely to have more players/streamers anyway.
---
I don't represent the majority, I am merely saying what we see **every day** in this sub, people nonstop complaining about queue times. We queues get a little worse because of events, this sub is literally spammed with threads. I would say its safe to assume the majority of players would rather just play the game. 
---
Streamers might not be more important than us but they advertise the game and often times, for free. Think about the moments sodapoppin chooses to stream DBD with 20k+ viewers. Picture 20k people seeing nothing but him sitting in lobby. He will either change games or viewers will gradually leave the stream because there is nothing to see. Viewers are always potential players.
---
In that sense, we should take streamers in consideration when talking about lobby times because for DBD specifically, they are one of the pillars of this community.
---
MOUSE SENSITIVITY.

D-did it teleport you to a different part of the map!?

---
One thing is to know the map you're playing on. Look at your surroundings, where is the next pallet, where could be a good hiding spot (lockers are usually not a good one)
---
Then you maybe want a perk that gives yiu a speed boost. Sprint Burst, a perk from Meg Thomas lets you run faster for 3 seconds, giving you a headstart when the killer found you. But the perk has a cooldown of 60/50/40 seconds, depending on which level you got it on.
---
I'm just going to assume you know how perks and the bloodweb work.
---
The perk that has been the most useful to me to avoid the killer is Urban Evasion, a Nea Karlsson perk that lets you crouch faster.
---
TLDR to escape its the easiest to not engage the killer, maybe you want to get the perk Premonition for the start, it alarms you when you're looking at the killer at a fairly long distance, that way you can hide safer
---
Who said I get upset at flashlights? Just making sure if you try to flashlight me ill make sure you only get one chance
---
What was the buff he received?
---
I'm not rank 5-6, I'm just rank 17 getting carried into high rank matches lol. But yeah, I try to make sharp turns and stuff but idk it's like the killers always have me in sight no matter what I do. I have gotten away with pretty cheeky things like hiding behind walls and creeping around but never been able to escape once I'm seen.
---
I'll keep practicing though! Thank you for the tips. I feel like once I get around 100 hours under my belt I might actually be capable.
---
Urban immersion it's a guaranteed depip for you and your whole team üòÇ
---
It can be hard but I kind of like the slow build up and it gives you something to do besides being a gen monkey
---
Because of how many rank resets there are and how few ranks there are, they dont mean much at all.
---
Take League for example, 24 different ranks (before Master, Grandmaster and Challenger) and then its MMR system to make the match making even more fair, then eoth seasons lasting all tear the player finds a place they fit in their rankings.
---
DbD doesn't have the player count to do that though
---
About ¬£70-¬£80, Buy every Character and then customise the shit outta them all!

Such a baby

Second down woulda happened anyways myers was cutting off on the other side of the rock
---
You realise your shitbox can record video right?
---
no
---
Reached Rank 2 last night while altering between Trapper, Adiris, Amanda, Ghost Face and Freddy. I dont need no cheat shit to win.
---
&gt;Cross console? Hell yes, but making KB/M and controller play together is just brutal on controller players no matter the game. There's a reason why Nurse was never as viable on console as PC.
---
Well, Nurse isn't as strong anymore so that shouldn't be a problem anymore. Can't say the same for Huntress.
---
yeah I'm scared for that day but ill enjoy purple for the time being
---
How is the game on Xbox ? I play on cousins ps4 and my thumbs always slipping off the sticks cuz the dumbass round bump in the middle of the joysticks.
---
Ight dude calm down
---
any updates about this?
---
Every post I look at there you are with my boys name in your mouth. Don't speak his name and the noobs will forget about him.
---
but there are five people...
---
No. You get 10% for all survivors hooked, 20% for each survivor killed (80% possible) and 10% for hook actions (9+).
---
LULW
---
If BHVR is going to make us wait 15 minutes for a killer lobby, can they at least make it worth our wait???
---
Nice work! I have done this a few times yet I‚Äôm stuck at green haha nice work!
---
Dead meme.
---
That's the exact mindset. You are essentially the game show host, you want to be challenging but not game breakingly horrible to the survs.
---
The only people who want this in terms of PC/Console is those who have never played it on PC or those on PC who want to destroy console players.
---
&gt;I kind of wish there were some indicators on the Killer HUD that told you if you had a Mori or not
---
what? Pausing the game mid match shows you the burned offerings and standing over someone moriable will pop the mori icon almost in the middle of your screen.
---
someone lacks the ability to detect sarcasm
---
Baby killer/survivor getting bullied and bitching on Reddit OMEGALUL
---
It says in the description preforming 9 hook actions give iridescent.
---
Like if they combined 3 coldwinds together
---
Your idea is great but my take on a diff game mode here: Calamity
---
Lore:
---
The Alchemist wasn't only experimenting on the killers. To his surprise he caught a crow. "The spies of the entity, huh?" He thought to himself. He injected the serum into a crow. After many caws of agony, the crow began to glow. Slowly, all its feathers became white. He set it free. To his surprise it seemed to like him. He plucked a feather off of its body. Suddenly, the crow became nothing. The feather remained. The other crows began cawing loudly. He snatched as many as he could and injected the and set them free. After the trial, everything seemed off. The entity seemed like it was losing control. Soon another trial arose, this time however two familiar places seemed to be smashed together. Suddenly, the alchemist saw handfuls of white crows everywhere. (P 1 of 2).
---
Which is once again, another potential or obvious advantage that PC players have over console players.
---
Depends on what perks you have. Lullaby can work, survelience works well but you have to be able to juggle survivors, pop goes the weasel is good, you can always run an end game build and not worry about the gens as much. Remember me, noed, bloodwarden.
---
Don't forget ruin
---
I find discordance can help in place of ruin. It stops multiples from working on generators, otherwise it's easy patrol until it procs
---
You‚Äôre right I forgot this kind of thing tends to happen on Reddit cause people are embarrassed to admin they aren‚Äôt in the top percentile of the games ranks
---
9 hooks actions provides you with 10% towards the emblem.
---
The other 90% is from 4 kills (80%) (sacrifices and moris) and hooking each survivor 1 time (10%).
---
2 Huntress with iridescent heads and an open gate with no cover
---
I was testing it out to see what 8 hooks give so I 2 hooked everyone. And let them all escape. It‚Äôs just weird to me that I would be better off tunneling people down for the rank instead of trying not to tunnel...just pointing out the system is a bit weird
---
Oh shes still just as strong as she was before in the hands of anyone good. Her addons were hit but she still has some good ones.
---
I agree it is awful more for survivors than killers, but since I don't care about pips on survivors, I make memes about killers.
---
&gt;Well, Nurse isn't as strong anymore 
---
let me stop ya right there pal
---
Id like an adrenaline rework, but that aint happening. So, no. No you may not.
---
I'm ClownBabyOnCrack on PS4
---
Pop, thrilling tremor, corrupt intervention, STBFL. Corrupt is the place you normally put ruin but corrupt is more consistent and can zoom survivors into a smaller area.
---
Imagine making a suggestion at 3am reuploading it after it didn't get any traction and expecting something different with low effort built right in to the core of the post. Yikes
---
You get 3000 when you use the event offering, if you don‚Äôt you only get 1000
---
Why are you comparing one of the best survivor perk in the game to a low tier killer perk?
---
They can't even handle dedicated servers. Cross play would destroy my console.
---
He seems to be checkin' out Claudette.
---
Alrighty then, thank you *boops snoot*
---
Borrowed time works different against freddy in both scenarios. 
---
If the unhooker is asleep, it doesn't work
---
If the unhooker is awake, but the hooked person gets hit, triggering deep wounds, they fall asleep per freddys mechanics to drag someone into the dream world when hit. When asleep there is no terror radius, so your mend timer is never paused even in a chase. You cannot heal, because if you stop you get hit. You cannot run cause you run you bleed out.
---
and everybody clapped
---
Noice, I'm at rank 4 Legion. Had rank 1, at one point. "Meta" killers are 50/50, I think.
---
A submarine sounds pretty interesting but how would the escape gates work? Lol
---
Naw he comes after Sans from Undertale
---
No they literally don't own his likeness  which is why he doesn't look like him at all. They just have the character. Also they can do bug fixes because they don't change the actual character at all
---
In other words you're a potato who can't solo to rank 1 or even purple ranks? Can't loop a baby killer for a few minutes? Yikes
---
Ditto.
---
Just go pick it back up?
---
If your bitching about your thing getting destroyed because you 99 items and take them to the next game then get punished lmao, stop 99 items.
---
Yep, you got me. It must be so cool to be you....lol
---
Ask for some people to play with and the assholes really come put of the woodwork... yikes.
---
What tv is this?...I'm buying one tomorrow and need all the tips o can get.
---
Yes they don't own his likeness, which is why they went to the ACTOR to GET his likeness. 
---
Friday the 13th licence has nothing to do with making quinton look like quinton.
---
Remember, there's no sure way to escape the killer, and especially at the beginning you die more than you escape, thats normal. So don't feel down, those are just tips to better your chances
---
and how often is he wrong?
---
I mean from my experience you usually get the hit anyway so it's pretty much a win/win, You get a hit and a pallet, The pallet stun negates the hit animation so you only lose a bit more time if you had to experience them both. I do think it's stupid as hell how they can hit through pallets but it's clearly the same phenomenon as the late window hits
---
But the distance that that perk would make is I insane.
---
*Death is not an escape*
---
What tf was that? Ghotsface?
---
No- definitely meant finding the hatch was too easy, hence leading to such an avoidable downfall.
---
They changed it in the new update, Myers is effected by Spine Chill now when he's in tier 1
---
That's what I thought, that's why I was confused i only got 1k.
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to be honest...my swf really does have a Nancy w inner strength and small game
---
ironically ghostface has shit cosmetics, its literally just a red and a white outfit
---
[Really]/https://u.cubeupload.com/f0rlorn/dhas.png), unfortunately.
---
Shit I need this image
---
or hear me out what if you took time out of the match to cleanse totems so NOED doesnt proc. (I dont use Noed myself but it's never a problem when I play survivor)
---
Punishing Dc's should be a thing regardless of what killer you play againts. And I do agree Spirit needs to be touched on how she works but her being how she it doesnt excuse dc'ing
---
Take the cosplay to the neckst level.
---
I'm a surv main and tbh playing against her is fun, although you don't see her much anymore, when you do its the killer saying it's their first time playing since the rework and I assume they don't play again after that unless they like playing her, the waiting time on blinks is a drag for her I guess and imo they should've buffed her speed to be like everyone elses at least but I'm not a killer main so idk how bad/good she is exactly
---
you‚Äôre playing without an entire perk for like 90% of the match
---
Yeah this is pretty common i have messaged a few people on psn they were all having the sane issue, and i reported this to behaviour.
---
What the fuck is "hip" boomer?
---
I agree with this. But then the people who like to camp with stealth killers will bitch and moan, and then insidious will need a rework
---
LMAO hell no. Overall, it‚Äôs an agreed upon opinion that you shouldn‚Äôt DC at all, whether it‚Äôs because of tunneling, games taking too long to load (especially shitty if everyone else waits), etc. But if it‚Äôs agreed upon, then killers shouldn‚Äôt matter. And nobody‚Äôs nerfing spirit until the low-tier killers, such as Legion (whom I play and have a solid strat for), get buffed. Spirit does indeed have telltale signs, and Ive played spirit before, and she‚Äôs not hard if you know what the phase sound is and can mindgame her, not vice versa. Hell, most survivors run away before I can mindgame them. Punishing DC is the most accurate way to weed out the salty. Adjusting so they won‚Äôt DC is giving them what they want. I, as both a killer and survivor main, know for a fact that it won‚Äôt do shit, because then they‚Äôll find another thing to complain about. E.g. Getting hit on a vault where the survivor was right next to it, or Billy‚Äôs speed.
---
Also a good alternative. As long as there's some significant pressure to cleanse.
---
but did the adept steve escape tho?
---
The purple med kit addon
---
No u
---
non meta perks to run?
---
mind you that I primarily play killer, but do enjoy a match of survivor here and there.
---
Spine Chill, first and foremost. it's insanely useful in many situations and is arguably my favorite survivor perk. you don't have to dip out of a gen every time it lights up if you're mindful of your surroundings and it can be useful for knowing when you've truly lost a chase.
---
next, I would take something like Pharmacy for a guaranteed teammate fastheal or self heal (I have 30-something medkits on Quentin and 10 or so on Steve. never gonna use em all, just love stealing them.)
---
Prove Thyself can be useful for coop actions and iirc helps with the BP grind without being detrimental to a build like Distressing can be for killers that shouldn't have bigger heartbeats.
---
and while most people don't care for it, a few of Kate's perks (namely the no scratches after a vault, I think?) can be incredibly useful, especially if the killer misses a window lunge or has a power recovery to deal with, or Boil Over to potentially slip out of a killer's grasp on the way to a hook.
---
Nah, no Jason. B r i n g J a s o n
---
that Obama's name? Albert Einstein.
---
Made a post about this detailing his perks and power a while ago. I personally think my ideas for the scp killers were great.
---
adrenaline works once, NOED works as long as the totem is up which can get you multiple easy downs. I usually get bones anyway tbh but I see why others don‚Äôt dig it too much. It would be different if NOED wasn‚Äôt a hex and instead gave you two exposed hits on people and that‚Äôs it.
---
I have no earthly idea why so many killers will pursue one dude for 3 gens
---
Dark water (but not opaque so you can see totems) would slowly flood areas until they drown. Exit gates would be ladders slowly coming down so no tbagging at the exit
---
Its a private match lol
---
Friday the 13th? And no you don't seem to understand that they can't change the way his face looks in game without contacting the licensor. That's a major change and would most certainly require permission
---
He told us we couldn't even dare to try to convince him that it isn't one of the best
---
Not that I'm defending NOED, but it can be disabled by cleansing. Nothing can prevent Adrenaline except 3king before gens are done.
---
No mate it is not a bug in this scenario:
---
A) They were running agitation for the purpose of doing this
---
B) They hooked everyone else
---
C) Every time they realized they couldn't catch me they would drop the person and chase me
---
D) Then when the person's bleed out bar got too low they would pick them up again and chase me so they didn't die, forcing me to do 4 gens by myself as hatch was not an option
---
E) The entire time my "team mate" didn't struggle at all during the whole thing, neither did they quit which most people would do. Also me and my other team mates were able to struggle and be hooked
---
F) They just so happened to be on each other's friends list
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If it was just one or two of the above then I would have ignored it but with all of the combined it would be foolish to think it's just a bug.
---
It's dedicated servers now B) at least for PC
---
Why spaz and write all this out when even you seem to understand that idiot seems like they were dicking around a whole lot more than trying to learn anything. The "dent head" (&lt;--- also wtf? boomer insult much?? not surprised since you write like a butthurt neckbeard) is who again? Calm down please
---
The original video? I mean i want a longer version :D
---
Gay is ok. European is not ok.
---
Accurate
---
1. Fuck yo keys. 2. Its a time waster. 3. Plunders was buffed to see items on the ground. 4. Buff white ward to be able to keep the last item that was in your hand when you die instead of having to die with it.
---
I always go altruistic. Hate when I fail though
---
To beat the killer you gotta play the killer.
---
Her cooldown is fine. Adding to it would just make addons more necessary.
---
Her shards light up when she phases. They just need to be more visible.
---
I took a break i usually am rank 1-3. But just pointing out the description says iridescent for 9 OR more hooks. But getting 8 hooks results in a bronze. Either I‚Äôm reading it wrong or if I had hooked 1 more person that should have gone straight to iridescent.
---
Swing chain and brush Freddy is suffering too
---
WGLF+We‚Äôll make it in every build, other two are just whatever I‚Äôm feeling. Common perks I run in these two slots are bond, self care, balanced landing, adrenaline, borrowed time, and prove thyself
---
Yeah it moves just faintly so. Sorry, i wish i could make it better
---
Lmao im dumb, for some reason i was thinking F13 was freddy. 
---
Im pretty sure they can do whatever the fuck they want to the character that doesn't damage the brand or gains them further money from their design.
---
Purchased Jake already so my free ones will be Spirit and Hag.
---
If that game mode is added then we definitely need Jason in game for a Freddy vs Jason showdown.
---
If wraith did this on my screen I would call a priest immediately
---
True, but it's impossible to cleanse all 5 totems as a solo que. If I had another 3 lads to play with I wouldn't be complaining.
---
You'd be wrong, I have played a lot of this game and part of that is losing, I don't just come and here and complain every time I lose otherwise I would have far more posts!
---
Like I said above:
---
Breaking the rules is what you get banned for and breaking the rules is what cheating is. It's really that simple.
---
My combo would be Flip flop, tenacity, unbreakable, and Boil Over. Walk and recover, recover turns into wiggle. Wiggle for boil over, unbreakable if they don‚Äôt pick up.
---
Friendly demogorgons are a blessing to this game and deserve all the love.
---
thought about something like that too. Ladders coming down from the exits up above. 
---
Whole place already flooded with water and getting worse when the EGC starts.
---
Still think the ghost ship would be easier than the submarine. But boths came into my mind.
---
That was Miss Piggy
---
Yeah, how about next time you go against an actual good spirit and not a baby one? This spirit was horrible and only phased like 2 or 3 times
---
Not as bad as prayer bead spirit
---
Lmao nice name
---
I found it on twitter and tried finding the original. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs just a random edit someone made :/
---
Discussion does not equal complaining, stop acting like a child this game is rated m.
---
No I remember a post about it all, I might look for it but they aren't allowed to give them new appearances or alter their current appearance without permission. Hence why everyone was so suprised when we started to get licensed character skins. It's not as simple as BHVR being able to do what they want
---
Awwww

What about a 25% chance you lose a perk for the trial
---
&gt;i thought the claudette running straight to rescue her friends while I, ghostface, am camping them in the basement

Yeah he hasn‚Äôt gone through any horrible sequels!

Blendette: "If I hide in the corn, he might not see me"  
---
Ghostface with this cosmetic: "Let's hope she doesn't see me in the corn"
---
Nice incomplete thought
---
Let it disable items for the rest of the match then
---
I like clown because there's nothing special about him lorewise, he's just a psycho.
---
Dc for 30 minutes? First they need to find a way to weed out the accidentally dc (shitty internet) and intentional dc
---
I turned off message notifications because it‚Äôs been really bad but to be honest today I stopped playing and did something else because I was just getting the worst people in every singe game. 
---
Tenacity is the answer I suppose.
---
Man, you dont know a thing about me, so keep on with your speculation... you're the one who looks stupid here, not me.
---
Either way, I dont give two shots what you think. Peace.
---
Don't throw the pallet. First off throwing the pallet makes it more likely to hit sometimes, second if you are going to get hit anyways don't waste the pallet. Obviously you are going to throw some pallets and get hit threw them because of lag or you misjudged the distance but still.
---
This was supposed to be funny?
---
shut up orphan
---
Yea because people will just place the pallet early and force you to break it or you get looped, which renders two of your perks useless.
---

---
Can confirm. His weapon's hitbox range is the entire fucking map, let's be honest BHVR.
---
Yeah. I just want my item and not have someone steal it or just can‚Äôt find it
---
Boy oh boy, you're an intelligent one.
---
Licenced character skins are with further negotiation since its literally gaining money off their brand with no recompense for them
---
Not to mention any skin that people would reasonably want for a licenced character would be from their respective storys. And they def dont want potential stuff to harm their brand so it makes sense to clear future stuff with them, but already made stuff should be clear to edit as long as its not damaging i would think
---
**closes and opens allknowingeye.exe again**

DbD is very limited in terms of core mechanics. You run in a circle, drop the pallet when you have to, and run to the next one. That's 90% of high-level gameplay along with holding M1. I miss games where you can fight back, too, although you do stun Killers you drop a pallet right onto.
---
At your level, Killers are fairly easy to confuse or even juke, but don't get into bad habits. Like I said, "looping" is the meta, and people frown upon even attempting stealth because it often leaves you as neither distracting the Killer nor working on gens or totems. When you're running, remember that windows take much longer for the Killer to vault than you.
---
Bond is an excellent perk for playing with randoms. Dwight is the ideal starter character, because he's passively helpful to everyone nearby, gets extra BP from coop actions through Prove Thyself, and can see nearby teammates to know what they're doing. Claudette is a bit more advanced, but Botany Knowledge is underrated, Empathy should be very helpful at lower ranks to know when someone's being chased, and Self-Care is a trap. Time is very important in DbD and it's better to bring or find a medkit if you plan to heal yourself (there's always a chest in the basement and medkits are very common from chests; Botany Knowledge may help you keep one after by not depleting it fully, too).
---
If you're more focused on chasing than healing, David has Dead Hard, the meta exhaustion perk, as well as We're Gonna Live Forever, which is useless in-game, but gives you more BP after for protecting or unhooking allies.
---
I mean but this isn't a fps corner peaking shooter. You really think it would matter that much? Maybe in the corn fields console would suck but overall I don't frames kills crossplay for me.
---
8 is to much make it 6
---
Welp, I am. Atleast im not the one suggesting to add keyboard players over to console so all the console players can eat shit.
---
Did the Steve with adept escape?
---
I play on both. Only killers really have any advantage from PC compared to console. I think some of you are really stressing over this. I also think like one guy stated, the ranking system would clear up a lot of the disadvantages people think it would bring.
---
Could. But it was all to skill during that. Now its just automatic for a whole fucking minute and everyone including their mom is running that perk
---
Is that actually a thing?... Again?
---
Just like true and his thanatophobia/sloppy butcher. Difference is I can see why sloppy and stbfl are very good.
---
I‚Äôm the 500th like, screw off haters
---
I actually never pause the game. Didn't know this.
---
And yeah, I know it does, but I've definitely forgotten I had a mori in a match before and just muscle-memoried picking up a survivor and did so too fast to notice the Mori indicator.
---
Every survivor with titties has that though.
---
I am sure Jeff's moobs do too
---
This isn't a who sees who first corner peaking fps... Frames are not crucial unless we're talking dropped fps. If console is constant frames; even obviously way lower, I don't see the big issue lol.
---
Yeah DCs should be punished. I'm not arguing with that. Go ahead and ban them. Then just watch as the player base dwindles because the only three options are face spirit every two games, DC and get banned, or just quit the game altogether. I'm saying devs should take steps to fix real problems such as buffing killers and making spirit give more feedback to survivors first, not that they shouldn't punish DCs. Sure, punish them, as soon as you fix the root cause. 
---
Yeah DCs will never completely stop. But the fact that there has been an influx since using spirit has become widespread, and that even old nurse didn't get as much DCs, should tell you it is a problem with spirit. It's not that she's too strong, it's that she has no counterplay, and going against her is feels like it depends on luck and feels unfair.
---
Holy shit. What drugs did she take? Oinkers went flying
---
Swing Chains for add-on, I assume?
---
Blue screen of death has occurred
---
Dude, that maxed out Save the Best for Last (40%) is no fucking joke
---
"Hook AND sacrifice" its literally right there so idk what you are so confused about
---
If Otz has taught me anything, it's that Whispers is the #1 pick for babies. It lets you start applying pressure/gathering stalk sooner, never be too far from a Survivor, and find the last one.
---
um, i don't think you realize the old DS was more broken than this. it could be used at anytime, anywhere and it wasted too much of the killer's time because of the fact 90% of them had to dribble just to avoid it and most of the time it would result in the survivor still stunning or them getting out of the killers grasp. also, before the rework the non-obsessions could waste so much more of the killer's time just because they made the killer walk more from their destination, only to get stunned. i'm pretty sure it was ran just as much as the old one. personally, i'd say this one is in a much more healthier state than the old version, but it can still be weaponized end-game really.
---
but that's all
---
I mean I would still play against pc players but there are obvious issues. Not to mention you would have to get steam, microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo to work together.
---
Am I the only one wondering why Nancies legs are as long as my pasts noodles?
---
Aw shit **restarts allknowing pc**
---
For me (I'm on switch) it takes an absurd 10 minutes just for killer, but when its survivor its 3 minutes both at minimum.. I've had to wait 30 minutes for a killer game
---
&gt;This isn't a competitive shooter
---
No shit. My point still stands and pc players can do ALOT better moves compared to console.
---
&gt;Obviously they have the advantage strictly in aim, hardware performance and frames but none of these really impact your success
---
**lists the issues of why it would impact success and says it wont impact my success** Genious.
---
&gt; You'd be fine and you wouldn't wait ten minutes per game. It's kinda common sense man... No offense
---
I prefer waiting over whatever nonsense you are suggesting. I rather wait longer and have a fun game rather than eat shit during every game.
---
I once got a 4k (no disconnects, but it was a very quick match) and only got Ruthless
---
There are so much smurfs in survivor matchmaking that it just sucks altogether.
---
Yeah I believe it stacks, I think Otz used thana and sloppy on his strongest legion build but not 100% on that.
---
Sure dude. Punish DCs without fixing spirit and other killers, then have fun with the 7 players who'll still be playing this game but will probably quit after seeing spirit/playing only spirit for the nth time.
---
no mend is considered its own type of action. its why nurses calling dosnt work on it either.
---
to increase mend time you need to use the blade addons that legion gets
---
Those 3 survivors
---
140‚Ç¨ in so far. I highly regret my life choices
---
Yooo Id like to know the contact too ‚ù§
---
Anime shit that she drew years ago, regrets and has apologized for, and wasn't even explicit or pedophilic in the first place.
---
Wait, how bad are most people getting compromised? Because I've had people running into me my last couple of games, so either Spirit's passive phasing is really underrated, or lag is at an all-time high.
---
No capitals, gotta do it like this [r/blessedimage](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
I grabbed someone my last game. Twice in the same grab. Then they teleported onto my shoulder with no icon for it.
---
So they ARE around...
---
I literally cannot fathom how people play without it. As soon as it‚Äôs in my bloodweb for a new/prestiged character, I grab it.
---
I have flubbed pallet drops, brought them down with the Killer behind me, and still gotten the hit.
---
That text is old, i think cause you only get iridescent from the times you hooked + killing all survivors so i feel its wrong. Now i see what you mean. Confusing.
---
Witchcraft, burn the witch!
---
The writing also doesn't do him any favors. Holy shit is it bad writing.
---
Also some killers like demogorgon and pig can completly ignore the downside of the perk since hitting someone with your ability doesn't increase or decrease its stacks, which means that you just need to hit your obsession with your ability instead of your normal attack.
---
Oftentimes the more you play, the higher your rank gets, and the higher your rank gets, the more chance you have of getting spirit. Trust me, I've been shutting up and taking the possible depip for a while now but it gets boring fast when you keep vsing her, and *that's* when people will quit.
---
I have no issues with them imposing DC bans if they actually work on balance changes after it, because the DC bans are not a solution.
---
I thought he was American
---
Listen. 1. Spine-chill. 2. Iron-will. 3. Scratch mark jukes. 4 Yes she lights up when shes phasewalking. 5.DON'T RUN WHEN YOU DONT NEED TO
---
It's not about balance who gets nerfed; it looks like it's just going to be the strongest Killer because everyone's tired of seeing them at top ranks.
---
This. Whoever fought a Nurse that DC‚Äôd after 2-3 Gens today, I swear that wasn‚Äôt a ragequit lmao.
---
I keep getting forcefully disconnected every 5 games or so. No reason, Internet is fine, no lag, just poof.
---
i think that would be awesome, not even a whole skin, but like a hoodie... as they're wearing some anyways.
---
See you would think that and I agree. Sadly it's not the case as licensors are really protective of their product and BHVR can't too much without their permission. Hence why this change hasn't been implemented
---
Vivzie's been working on Hazbin a decade, and Angel was one of the very first characters imagined for it, so I highly doubt we won't be seeing plenty of development with him.
---
No. I cut the clip so it wouldn't include the boring parts.
---
I mean, you could play as Killer for a while.
---
But yeah, long-term, it's really on the devs. They should just bite the bullet and do something BIG. A general Killer buff that serves weaker Killers most, and then counterbalance it with whatever Survivor buff best covers any issues with that.
---
Like, suppose they added points that move Killers to the opposite side of the map. Extremely useful for slower Killers; unnecessary for the top 4, who have their own mobility.
---
...a rage quit because you rely on it like a crutch and won't play if you can't have it there to rely on
---
It bring a tear to my eye
---
I wasn't playing during that time period, so you could be right and people will weather through this. I dunno, it's just something I thought of based on my own experience.
---
Could have been some event gens, 1000 each x3 makes that 35,000
---
It's not about spirit. First you came for freddy, then you came for nurse, now you come for spirit. Who's next? You will always be crying about nerfing someone. Quit playing nobody will miss you.
---
What was the players/killers name
---
Claudette's The World is, indeed, the power to rule over the world.
---
I keep bouncing back and forth between rank 6 and rank 5 and all I'm going against is Freddy, Michael, trapper, Wraith,and sometimes spirit. I very rarely get any other killer which is annoying going against the same 5 killers over and over again.
---
But it's still a stabbing noise when be bonks people, so it's like.
---
Myers: *stab*"bonk"
---
If we punish dcs before nerfing spirit, maybe people will actually learn to play against her.
---
You cant learn to play against a killer if you quit every time you see them.

Not quite, nice try but you got it wrong. Take a look at the video again and see if you can better interpret the situation.
---
It happens bru ull get them just gotta play and get better that's with all games so yea I bet ull get all four and start msging u either nicely or hatefuly I had got a four piece and after I sent all survivors gg and they sent gg back
---
That‚Äôs happened to me before, it sucks :(
---
But oddly enough, the last few matches I‚Äôve played lobbies loaded super fast.
---
I came back here cuz I know how u can counter it. She‚Äôs hair goes V shaped when she‚Äôs using her power. Spirit is definitely not op there‚Äôs just too many survivors who don‚Äôt know hoe to play against him.
---
bruhhhh
---
New add-on 
---
Fat line
---
If one perk is op then it only stands to reason that the killer should be nerfed and not the perk
---
Personally I'll just tunnel that one survivor if its gonna go down that way. If I'm only going to get one, it will be the toxic one.
---
Lol I just waited an hour to play as a survivor and one of my teamates DC'd too. Such is life.
---
Anyways, how's your sex life?
---
Not enough players, new game mode splits the playerbase, goodbye 10 minute waits to get in a lobby, hello 1 hour waits.
---
Is this show going to become the new ‚ÄòMy Little Pony‚Äô or something
---
FNAF just doesnt fit. Even if it did, the community would not be happy about it. so they wont add em
---
I‚Äôve seen killers holding me walk right past a hook (on accident, not for hatch mercy) bc I was running Boil Over and the hook didn‚Äôt light up, which let me get away. Super underrated.
---
They're the best, a good enough huntress will be just as viable, even if it's a little harder.
---
Any killer is perfectly viable for 80% of high rank matches if you're good enough with them. They're the only 4 that are viable for 100%
---
I genuinely don't even know how that comment got attached to this thread. That was just supposed to be to the post, lol
---
Havent seen anything else but deer stalker and t2 predator :/ i just now got whispers
---
I think it'd be interesting to add them.  
---
A lot of people just hate anything cause kids like it. You ain't gonna get a positive reaction here, my dude. 
---
 I'm with you though.
---
love it
---
As soon as you get to rank one, youre going to try to fibd ways to get out of rank 1 without getting banned
---
If they are constantly fast vaulting just leave them. You now know for a fact only 3 survivors at most are doing gens.
---
I make these omega bitches dc in 1 minute, maybe 2 if im eating a sandwich during lmfao
---
good job man
---
I remember when I was playing as survivor, new to the game, I was like ‚ÄúHA this killer is so nooby he is just staring at me.‚Äù and then I got chased, lol.
---
No counterplay, must have been a bad spirit which makes this unimpressive. /s
---
Its a word in a meme calm down
---
That was me, I saved you
---
Sure dude, clearly you're just here to rage and assume everything about me from one post. I never admitted to ruining anything because I don't DC, but go ahead and pretend to know everything about me because I suggested devs do balance changes. FYI, just because I haven't played the game from its release doesn't mean my input/attempt at finding a solution is trash. 
---
Heads up, I won't be replying to you anymore as clearly you're just angry and not here to actually discuss anything.
---
What if the killer got to see who had the perk and what it was?
---
As far as I know it doesn't do those things. You don't bleed under the door the blood you see is a blood trail left while injured. Sounds like he was using no mither. Iron will also reduces the moans of pain.
---
You could be right and I just haven't found the right counterplay, it's not like I'm a dbd God. Still. Balance changes are needed regardless.
---
I wish for all your matches to be swift and your survivors non-toxic
---
Balance changes are always needed in this game tbh.
---
Even nurse, who they just tried to fix, is still ridiculous.
---
This is the basement when the game is finished
---
Kids are smooth
---
I'm here to rage? Have you read your own post? Lmao go back to fortnite little girl.
---
Non-existent
---
For you, I can see it being a lot of time. You seem to be running low on it.
---
I'll be sad if that changes, I think it's hella cool. But I understand that it's something worth changing.
---
If they do, they should change it back to when it was bugged and she literally phased through the wall, that'd still be sweet.
---
I‚Äôve seen plenty of people asking for a new mode in posts recently, so just putting it out there. In custom only would be fine if needed.
---
Especially for weaker killers imo, as a lot of them are not viable in upper ranks.
---
Thanks man, I appreciate it. 
---
Totally understand what is meant with that people don't like the childish look, but especially the Animatronics from the first and the fourth game were creepy. They just really need to make them fit. 
---
I too think tho they'll probably not put them into the game. Even tho sone community members had really cool ideas.
---
That's why I've figured the skins, especially as there are four original Animatronics and the Legion has four member.
---
The sentiment of ‚Äúshe‚Äôs still good‚Äù is oddly absent at the high levels of play. She‚Äôs fallen from grace there and it created a power vacuum that Spirit filled.
---
Hmmmm have to wait a little longer for a good lobby, or get continuously fucked by shitty teammates?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not exactly a hard choice.
---
I actually think it sounds really interesting! What a fun idea.
---
*Eats survivor* IT'S FUCKING RAW
---
its the same with tapp's coat
---
TF you talkin' bout, I'm straight and I'll admit the guy is a straight snack.
---
At purple ranks, it‚Äôs hard to tell what you‚Äôre gonna get‚Äîeither a team of Navy SEALS-trained survivors or a an actual serial killer using DBD to practice their skills, or toddlers who haven‚Äôt learned the controller isn‚Äôt in fact food.
---
My outfit is based off his raining blood cosmetic but with a white mask and no red symbol
---
Lol god thank you. People are arguing with me and the proof is in the picture. If it‚Äôs old that‚Äôs fine haha I just think it needs to be updated if it isn‚Äôt correct.
---
Only the one finished makes tge notification bubble
---
Lockers also decrease ouch sounds naturally as well
---
please tell me how to ‚Äúknow‚Äù how to play against a killer I‚Äôm effectively deadblind in a chase with?
---
Because it‚Äôs fun to trash items
---
At least against a prayer beads spirit the game goes by fast. With slow down Freddy, everything just takes forever. Both are not fun to play against though
---
I love Jeff but good grief he wheezes so loudly.
---
https://youtu.be/kIJ5gkuvOA4

Something to watch while you wait for a lobby.

muh pips

Wait hatch spawns are not randomized ? Is there an article or link to tell me where hatchs are commonly found ?
---
No server for you!
---
*5 seconds have passed....*
---
Wake up is pretty nice
---
Your build doesnt really scream team player to me üòÇ
---
Dying Light, it really bad, it usually only affects 2 people, plus thr buff to obsession plus its useless until 4/5 stacks
---
What counterplay is there against a killer with no audio or visual cues where you‚Äôre effectively deaf blind in a chase as survivor?  You‚Äôre extremely out of touch.
---
It usually takes me more time as a killer. are you on EU? It's a bit slow atm

---
Yup me neither
---
yeah its terrifying if you arent prepared
---
There is little challenge when going against iri heads... 9 out of 10 Huntresses using them wait until they are right up your ass to wind up a hatchet. Playing against normal hatchets is way more challenging because a good Huntress will simply destroy you during loops.
---
what
---
It wasnt me
---
Nurses calling isn‚Äôt bad at all. It‚Äôs literally one of the most meta perks. It‚Äôs up there with PGTW, Ruin, and BBQ
---
I‚Äôm a simple man. I see Hazbin Hotel, I upvote
---
U know that when spirit uses her power her hair makes a V shape?
---
nope, she really hasnt, people just play her a bit differently and she's played a bit less as she isnt as smooth as she was before
---
Why does that matter?
---
Literally the easiest thing to get iridescent in. I just mean your build is all perks to help yourself
---
Increased instinct range add-ons and longer frenzy duration are the ones I find most useful, it scatters players and slows gen progress.
---
Well, most of "PRO" survs run meta perks, so spine chill is rare on high rank, but low ranks need some kind of support, so i think its pretty ok
---
Dont worry, jason will climb out of that hell with the devils pitchfork in hand
---
Clearly you aren‚Äôt red rank. She‚Äôs not very common up here anymore
---
I feel like this is exactly the sort of thing David would say, too
---
I‚Äôm already aware. Archive challenges have my slots a damn mess.
---
Myers doesn't even need M&amp;A, isn't his TR like 0 now because of undetectable or whatever its called?
---
The killer main I am just cried. This hurts
---
The problem is in the belt not the head
---
that was never the argument tho, the argument was that her viability barely changed. which is true, ahe's just a bit different and has weaknesses now.
---
I refuse.
---
Empathy&gt;SC
---
You uh, you may want to re-phrase the title there...
---
no killers are too weak to reach any rank, some are weaker than others but nonetheless they are all capable of reaching rank 1
---
Don't do that, don't give me hope
---
Honestly Everytime a survivor wants to use there DS in me, as long as it's not the endgame I just eat their DS. It's only threatening in the endgame as it could lose you a kill, so other than that I just take the DS.
---
Ok :c
---
Me: \*gets 3 killer matches in a row as survivour\*
---
it‚Äôs survivor noed, except it rewards success, not failure.  It doesn‚Äôt need a nerf at all.
---
Lmao, you're cute. Keep going, kiddo. 
---
I could use a good laugh.
---
Also, if you're gonna use the whole "boomer" thing, at least look up how old boomer's are. 
---
You don't need any more help looking foolish, sport.
---
It was actually me
---
I was the feng
---
God I do NOT miss those ranks
---
Well shit now I feel foolish
---
If you ever watch the Friday the 13th game they have out, he basically can teleport around the map to specific areas, and also has a Nurse like blink with a ling cooldown but he can see auras while traveling.
---
Both are good, but I prefer Premonition because it tells me which way the killer is coming from.
---
^^
---
Most of the time. It's not about being right, it's about being sure.
---
Oh no you don‚Äôt‚ÄîI ain‚Äôt falling for y‚Äôalls shenanigans a second time!
---
I‚Äôd only apply the point number one and make his shimmer not visible across the map. Make it similar to Freddy. If you‚Äôre 24m away, you don‚Äôt see the invisible wraith walking around
---
Some people are just too dumb to argue with, I bet you're the most fun at parties. Have a good week buddy üëç.
---
Ok
---
Nah, he just has Venka Prime with Primed Reach installed.
---
Monitor+Infectious is god tier on plague when everyone is broken. They don't run quick enough to always get away, and with everyone one shot, you can get an easy 3 people down in a short period of time.
---
Really desperate to get the last word? Yikes. Good luck finding a team that'll carry you bro.
---
Mystery Incorporated was early 2000s
---
No game is in dying need of cross play. PC players are used to killers spinning around doing 180s 4 times in a row on a corner to make you unable to tell which way they will go
---
Console can‚Äôt do that. Console killers are on a giant disadvantage, not being able to do the BASIC MIND GAME
---
Same goes on the other side. Console survivors aren‚Äôt used to that movement, as it‚Äôs impossible on a controller
---
I got my first escape today as Nancy against a trapper. Our Feng gave up when i was about to unhook her, Claudette got hooked 3 times, and Dave was in a chase when i opened the gates, but i had to go since trapper was making a beeline for me judging by the heartbeat. Hopefully he got out.
---
You bought the [Charity Case](https://store.steampowered.com/app/627510/Dead_by_Daylight__Charity_Case/).
---
I just ignore those players and go after the others. Turns out they aren‚Äôt very useful to the team if they can‚Äôt get you to chase them. Also practice flashlight dodging, it‚Äôs pretty easy once you get the hang of it.
---
How has it taken so long for this perk to get noticed? Like it‚Äôs been in for like a year or two now or whatever but only semi-recently people have started to use it?
---
Screenshot?
---
It‚Äôs no longer underrated
---
Just imagine you are playing trapper and this dude is behind your back all the time disarming your traps
---
nope, usa
---
She‚Äôs always had weaknesses. She‚Äôs different in the aspect that there‚Äôs now a LOT more room to make mistakes and go unpunished. Which is unfair. You fuck up against the killer, their base kit should not be stopping them from downing you. That is the same issue every M1 killer has. That holds her back. 
---
There is too much forgiveness against Nurse right now
---
All you need to do is say GG. I don't understand why people enjoy being toxic
---
Is Hazbin Hotel worth watching? I've heard extremely positive things, like good animation and characters. But also extremely negative things, usually from an overblown insult about how Tumblr it is. Thoughts?
---
She isn't very good at high levels of play without recharge. You can be looped and outrun, even if you're really good. 
---
At all others, she's fine. And she's also much harder to learn, but that's fine. I'd have preferred a different nerf if possible. But base kit should not have been touched.
---
Says the person still replying, so desperate to shit talk people online in some sad attempt to make themselves feel better?
---
Go ahead. Say something else witty, chief.
---
I'll wait... I can do this all night.
---
...unless you know how to play against a good huntress
---
I was memeing around with Poised + Dark Sense and it actually works great now.
---
When you‚Äôre in a chase and someone pops a gen, right you see the killer‚Äôs aura and they don‚Äôt see your scratch marks.
---
This gives you a massive advantage in the chase and lets you escape from the killer easily
---
Lmao, tier 1 Myers - slow af, u can see him, he makes noices, can react on him
---
GF - visible, makes sound
---
Spirit - invisible, fast af, dont even know when she come on ur Ass, if she takes Prayer - no sound, literally no info
---
I played a killer match yesterday with 4 urbans. I literally fell asleep during the match
---
For me, until about 6 pm, survivor queues are instant and killer queues suck, but later about like 10-11 pm, survivor queues suck and killer queues are instant.
---
This is a lot funny.
---
That's the problem : one gen remained.
---
What is painful about bottany? You can literally get 5 fast heals off a purple medkit with charges add-ons. Actually a good perk.
---
And it‚Äôs funny when a good Huntress decides to use iri heads
---
Ayee I‚Äôm glad you like it!
---
What is painful about botany? You can literally get 5 fast heals off a purple medkit with charges add-ons if you have botany equipped. Not a bad perk at all.
---
More than two DCs should be instant safety for everyone involved. Fuck it, make it insta pip for the killer. Just don‚Äôt make us all suffer because some fuckface can‚Äôt be arsed to wait for me to get them off hook.
---
Me so I can play a new killer without getting destroyed
---
Both sides can do that tho
---
but if you waste your blinks to the point that when a survivor does fuck up you cant take advantage of that, you fucked up. Her kit does all but punish her, what you want, is to be rewarded for absolutely nothing. Thats not how the game should work.
---
It happens more due to dedicated servers kicking us killers randomly, it‚Äôs extremely annoying and BHVR doesn‚Äôt give a shit not trying to be rude but just don‚Äôt think that all of us killers are being super salty recently some of us just get kicked.
---
no way, play full exposed excluding noed. bbq, myc, haunted ground, devout soap.
---
The dream.
---
You live in a fucking fantasy land lmfao
---
Huh I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a pretty stretch to call the creator a pedo then.
---
pretty sure it clips through walls on all settings which is the whole reasoning behind moonwalking as killer to hide it
---
I'm saying he went out there to help his team yet they couldn't return favor lmaooo so sad
---
But why would you care? You picked the other killers to practice. You WILL get destroyed a bit but you also WILL turn it around after a few games.
---
Your point?
---
All the more reason why the ranking system is so stupid and really needs to be overhauled.
---
Funnily enough they attach on the outside of the store skins!
---
Build without ruin would be bbq, corrupt intervention, pop and brutal strength.
---
Every kill would enable it to gain an advantage in survivors that can't move the same as PC players can
---
A fellow adam of culture
---
Tale as old as time
---
Helping yourself survive helps the team. Being able to unhook yourself and pick yourself up off the ground is hugely beneficial as it means 1 more person is able to work on gens when they would otherwise have to come unhook you.
---
low FPS messes with inputs and your timing bc you have no feedback what is happening when you are pressing buttons stop spreading bullshit by saying "it is fine" it rly isn't
---
Just as easily as survivors who care could disable it.
---
Swap noed for enduring.
---
Has mascot outfit been leaked or confirmed somewhere? I follow the leaksbydaylight subreddit, however I haven't seen it be mentioned at all.
---
Yeah cause going against an iri head huntress whose hatchets has hitbixes the size of a small car is so "challenging" right?
---
Tbf its that map on GF on dedicated servers
---
Im just gonna pretend hes in, wheres my fuckin part 4 and 8 cosmetics BHVR, god.
---
read my further response to OP
---
so then what is the point? to randomly get a console player that is 100% gonna be a detriment
---
Max time took me to find a lobby was 15 min as Survivor and 30 min as Killer and mostly ending up someone disconnecting. Imagine the anxiety behind this, swell. Also it sometimes queues me to only Thailand lobby (high ping) or SWF groups.
---
Sicko Mode by Travis Scott
---
Rank reset was a month ago.
---
Dude, you are literally one of those potatoes, you complaining about Plague tells me everything.
---
Thank you.
---
I'm pretty chill, I try to GG everyone even if they escape
---
I just hope that one day people that have only 10 hours in dbd would stop ranting on reddit. Imagine complaining about Plague, like it's so sad.
---
Its funny how try-hard so many killers are to camp the hook, especially at the end of the game. 
---
Are you such a shit killer that if you leave the hook, and the last survivor get the one off hook that you won't be able to find them again? C'mon...
---
I like hunt ;)
---
Comink thru!
---
And my favorite.
---
Don't be afraid of defeat, it will teach you a lot about your killers weakness. As an example i learned demogorgon perkless and i got defeated time and time again and i fell from red ranks to purple but one time something clicked, and i started to understand his teleports, his shred how to use them effectively to gen pressure.
---
So my advice to you would be: be zealously dedicated to improving spread the word of perkless improvement, it's how i get my kicks out of late game chat anyway, it's weirdly fun to speak like a raving lunatic and telling people that perks make them weak and dependent.
---
Well, it's a whole ser... You know what nah you're right.
---
No I think you seem to think dbd is some reports ready game Lol. You don't seem to get this ... It's okay though,like I said I play on both and understand fps. You're just lost ..
---
I feel like that was me
---
Poised
---
Ok, hipster.
---
Dope, the alchemist is a savage!  Hope he become a killer in the future.
---
I would be so pissed. God I hate adrenaline. Very well played though.
---
&gt;I don't see many advantages that computer players would have besides hatchet throws or clown vials.
---
If you really think this, you either never touched DBD on console or are just lying to yourself.
---
36
---
I feel like dbd needs more gamemodes.
---
Imagine a gamemode with 2 Killers and 8 survivors on a larger map with 14 gens from which 10 need to be repaired. Basically double the amount of everything. Hooks, Chests, Exit Gates, maybe even 2 hatches for 2 survivors etc.
---
This type of gamemode shoudn't be ranked by any means, but it would definitely add more variety to the game.
---
This was not when flashlights were op... you have a player level meaning this was after the flashlight nerfs
---
If I see a Scoops Steve and they're the last one alive, it's hatch ahoy.
---
The dependant part is so true. I think everyone has a "drug" perk they can't play without, like Whispers or Shadowborn.
---
This dude is a fucking joke holy shit...
---
its nice to downplay others and make spirit sound strong af. I can do the same, look
---
Spirit - blind, can only see scratch marks and hard to listen sounds due to phasing sound
---
GF - faster than spirit, better at mind games and his step sounds are covered by the chase music so there's literally no info!
---
it's not hard play that game, kid
---
I mean besides the occasionally extra frame that allows a late tucked shoulder or something to be seen around a corner I am a little misunderstood I'd assume then. What would be your biggest issue it would bring?
---
I played against someone last week who kept vaulting the same pallet over and over just to spam me with notifications. For a moment I thought about going over to chase them, but quickly realised that they were doing nothing to help their team while messing with the pallet. Dealing with 3 survivors is much easier than 4.
---
I ended up downing them at some point later in the match, and they dc'ed before I could pick them up.
---
How about we kill both of them? Pretty please? The only reason i'd ever use noed is to counter adrenaline and I'd rather not use noed. I feel like they're just two nonsense perks that only exist to counter each other, and it'd be so much better for the game if both died.
---
Played against a huntress with that add on today and my internet kicked right after she got me down with her single blow hatchet. Hate looking like a DC in that situation lol
---
Once the train is going, there‚Äôs no stopping because I‚Äôm going to power through that pallet until it‚Äôs dropped.
---
I got my first flashlight blinds on a skilled bubba and managed to loop and waste his time for several minutes. My looping skill has been increasing over timeüòÑ
---
I hurt myself because I actually like the perk even if it‚Äôs effects are minuscule
---
Survivors are used to having the advantage and bullying weak killers. When something legitimately strong pops up they have no clue what to do and crumble because suddenly games aren't handed to them on a silver platter. Let the shit tier players rage and quit. 
---
Even if they stay they'll just switch their focus from complaining about spirit to the next strongest killer, and then the next. 
---
It'd be better for community health if survivors feel what it's like to be on the weaker side and learn how to play better if they want to win.
---
Charms are a fucking joke.
---
Didn't he say he did experiments on The Doctor at some point if I'm not mistaken
---
About the same for me. I'm a daytime survivor and nighttime killer lol
---
I still don't get it.
---
What was the point of his experiment with the serum and what was the end goal?
---
Rank reset is the 13th
---
I figured the ranking system would handle most of the true high-end killers and PC players. And as if you are not trying to be cute and condescending yourself. I just thought this would help out with the long queue times and the lack of players it seems to have within each community that I can see from my end.
---
drag Race making it to Dead by Daylight? Why am I not surprised?
---
Iron maiden is gd as well a it cuts reload time dramatically.
---
There are so many perks in the game that are unbelievably bad 
---
We need a full game perk rework to bring them all in line. 
---
Cause you‚Äôve got meta perks that everyone uses : Adrenaline, balances landing etc
---
Fun perks that are used often : Head on
---
Decent perks that are alright for their purpose but aren‚Äôt all that great : Self care, leader
---
Then there‚Äôs just trash tier perks that nobody uses : overwhelming presence, vigil, sole survivor, metal of man, 
---
Meta perks like Adrenaline are crazy overpowered while perks like deja vu are almost completely useless. There needs to a complete rework for all perks
---
I still don't like slugging or hooks tbh. My idea wasn't so much multiple lives as it was replacing hooks with a post mortem minigame that the survivor has to complete to come back. Now, the minigame would take a fair bit of time to complete on their own, but other survivors can stop what their doing to pitch in and interact with objects around the map to speed up that survivor's return from that realm. This would take time away from gens and provide the killer more breathing room.
---
And, best part, I don't have to sit and wait on hook with my thumb up my ass desperately hoping someone saves me and I don't die on first hook.
---
The problem with being forced to rely on allies, instead of just incentivizing reliance, is that it creates frustrating gameplay which can lead to toxicity. Guarantee there would be a lot less salty people in DBD if you weren't forced to 100% rely on your teammates and be forced into positions where you are not even being allowed to play the game. Those sorts of mechanics are just unhealthy.
---
Agreed, Pennywise would dumb because we already have a clown, and we already have and eldritch horror in game.
---
1. Nerf Spirit
---
2. Remove Haddonfield and nerf every single one of the unbeatable buildings like Rancid, Asulym or Ironworks.
---
Congratulations, you reduced dc-rate by 60%!!
---
... this game is so bad haha.
---
I just wouldnt message people personally
---
Hell yes they are
---
Rank one and p3 everything... Thomas has never seen such bullshit
---
Theres nothing I want more than a match with two killers not gonna lie. I've seen videos of it and it looks like so much fun, a unique match
---
Haha I know, that‚Äôs why I asked. And tbh that Jason really looks like theirs
---
Congratulations! I got mine a couple of days ago with Legion...
---
yes it is a dumb rant
---
New Perk: Fuck you
---
Fuck killers, Fuck the entity, you are the on in control now  
---
When the killer hits you a rift instantly opens and teleports the killer to a random area on the map and allows you to easily escape cause fuck them thats why
---
Deku ?
---
Not consistentlym
---
If a Survivor doesn't let go of the repair button when the generator explodes, the gen glitches out. It will continue to spark and count a regressing, even though the Survivor is actively repairing it.
---
As such, the gen's aura will be white, not yellow.
---
Hopefully! I‚Äôd totally play on pc (currently on ps4) but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm starting from scratch.
---
Eh bad perk since half a second isnt worth a perk.
---
you can still spawn in with multiple killers?
---
Yea well most games would be fun if you just doubled everything but there's a reason they're limited to the amount they are in the first place..
---
Oh yeah that's in the memories.
---
Body blocking people on gens for easy first hits. 
---
Some of his best add ons are the Windstorm ones,  Coxcombed Clapper, and Bone Clapper. His Shadow Dance add ons are also underrated because you can pretend to uncloak and bait a pallet drop and quickly destroy the pallet. Also makes you vault faster. I also always forgot to use the brown The Ghost Soot add on. It makes mind gaming at jungle gyms easier since they can't see your red stain for 6 seconds after you uncloak. The most fun combo is still the Coxcombed Clapper and All Seeing Blood. 
---
I'm always trying new perk builds, but Ruin and BBQ are usually my go tos. I'm a big fan of Make Your Choice on Wraith. If I had Nurse's, and Sloppy, I'd run that combo too. Play with your food is also dirty on Wraith because you just cloak to "lose" your obsession and get stacks. Rinse and repeat. If I'm having really bad games against toxic SWFs, I throw on Bloodwarden and NoEd.
---
so sacrifice the player base just to get more players sounds smart
---
On the one hand, this clearly sucks. On the other, it's a single pip. Just hop into the next game, job done.
---
He‚Äôs like Herbert west but purely evil lol.
---
I get the reference but how does it pertain?
---
 I can relate. I'm not the highest in rank but I'm pretty obsessed with the Pig and only play as her. It's hard to find a lobby these days, usually takes about 20 minutes to find four players for survivors. But I have a blast every time and usually get 3/4 survivors. My last three games were all perfect, no sore losers disconnecting, and my very last game I had an offering that gave me the chance to kill one I had hooked once before and got off. It was great, and I was over the moon. But only being able to play two or three games in an hour because of the dead lobbies sucks.
---
I don't have anything to prove to you, it's been posted over the sub a bunch of times before but here's a quick example I just researched from someone more knowledgeable than me: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d027qo/some_info_regarding_licensed_characters_and_why/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing it play,  Freddy or foxy should be killers also the mori should  be the bite of 87
---
This subreddit is an echo chamber and so you end up with a lot of stereotypes that just aren't true. Because they aren't able to do well with trapper, they can't comprehend that trapper can actually do well. It's a little too hard for them to think outside of the box with trap placement.
---
What sorcery is this
---
Peep me getting into one game with a rank 10 killer as a rank 12 survivor. Besides that getting stuck with red ranks all night
---
Vigo's journal hinted that the serum was key to an escape from the entity's realm and back into the mortal world, it's not clear as to how, and the journal itself was obscure and archaic about it. The serum is raw entity-matter, so it makes sense that could give some power over the entity's realm perhaps.

Break line of sight with Survivors that you know are purposely following you, then turn around and slap 'em as they come around the corner. Don't forget that you're faster than they are. Set them up for failure. If they don't learn, play around them, since that's one less Survivor doing gens.
---
Also worth learning how to psyche out flashlight players who love to save by pretending to start the pick up animation. Just hover over the survivor a moment and don't move. Anyone looking to save will inevitably run right into melee range.  Gets 'em every time.

Legion would be the focus of it where you to 4 players could play legion.

---
That post is satire. You are mocking satire.
---
Yes, awfully cute
---
From what I've gathered, this isn't how it works.
---
Currently, under peer-to-peer functionality, hit registration is decided on the Killer's end, *because* the Killer is host. That means, if the Killer gets a hit on their end, it doesn't matter what the Survivor saw, they get hit.
---
With dedicated servers, the server is the host  so hit registration is decided independently of players.
---
In other words:
---
P2P - hits are subject to the Survivor's ping with the Killer. As you say; if their ping is 80ms, then the Killer sees where they were 80ms ago.
---
Dedicated servers - hits are subject to BOTH the Killer's and Survivor's ping. So if both have a ping of 80ms, the Killer sees what the server "saw" 80ms ago, which itself is delayed by 80ms compared to what the Survivor saw. So the effective ping becomes 160ms.
---
How long are you playing ?
---
Do you find hook struggling easier when bound to y? I've been looking for a way to fix this, but my thumb just struggles so much on struggle phase to the point where I'll die way early cuz my thumb literally just nah imma stop pushing it. I tried binding it to right trigger, but I don't think it works unless someone else knows better.
---
That was really a generic stuff and they have already altered Freddy so clearly they are still allowed to work on the license.
---
My latest wraith build is shadowborn, bbq, pop, and sloppy butcher
---
Which is exactly why I mentioned it shouldn't be a ranked game mode. It most likely wouldn't be balanced enough for fair gameplay, but again, it would add variety to the game.
---
Considering the fact that a lot of people have played this game for several thousand hours and through many devotions, it would really give something new to play.
---
Was a typo i fixed it.
---
I'm thinking we might get something shining related. After all they've got the sequel film coming out in December. But that's just a guess.

A better and more simple way is to walk up to the killer and tbag once.

Or you could use the come here emote and they most likely will go to you.

It's always the trapper

Let's do a trade the killers get Nea and the survivors  get Susie.

The difference being you usually don't see noed at high ranks whereas almost every red rank survivor runs adrenaline

I find BT and DS to be worse than adrenaline in terms of turning a match around. if I‚Äôm playing killer I want at least one or two kills by the time the gates are powered anyway.
---
Bill: I‚ÄôVE BEEN LOOPING THE KILLER FOR 5 MINUTES WHY IS THERE NO GENS DONE!!!!‚Äù                                         Meg:*hiding in bush*
---
We need more memes about this dweeb crying when people are rude to him online.
---
No, since trapper was heavily inspired by Jason to begin with. I've seen all the movies anyway, and honestly the whole franchise is overrated as fuck. The whole reason why F13 was even created in the first place was so they can copy Halloween, by picking another Holliday and hoping itll do just as well. Having Jason in the game will be dumb af imo.
---
Only reason it works for him is because he pairs it with infectious fright for a snowball. By itself STBFL is rather mediocre, forces you to ignore a player if you want maximum benefit and takes the spot of much better less situational perks.
---
Only place it has a real purpose is with the hag to teleport faster.
---
I don't really need ruin as a Billy main because I can apply so much pressure early on
---
one time the match started and I knew it was a trapper already bc I saw his traps, I started working on a gen and knew he had placed one at the nearby pallet. when I heard the heartbeat and saw him I started the action to disarm and when he swung I let go to force him into his own trap. one of the funniest killer DCs I‚Äôve ever had tbh
---
I'm 100% sure. I used it yesterday and it didn't  decrease or increase when I used those powers. It is probably the best perk for demogorgon
---
ü•¥
---
Her whole leg situation looks a little wierd to me
---
Jasons main shtick isnt traps its being a slapstick meat shield who can take just about anything and keep moving, and he gets very mad with people.
---
Nobody should depip when someone DCs. 
---
A 3v1 game is bad for both survivors and killer.
---
Pretty much yeah. I really don't feel like playing these days due to dedicated servers with their shitty hitboxes and only getting russian killers
---
Can we just get another original killer? I like playing as pre-existing fictional murderers as much as the next guy, but they're just over-saturating the game with licensed content.
---
just eat the ds jesus christ it isnt that bad lmao
---
It's a good idea, and it would fit. The community is too childish to accept it though, they wanna look mature by hating something that kids like (they probably also bash on fortnite)
---
Not like he was flashlight clicking and teabagging
---
This is a solid build, I like it, I would love to see his power revolve around chases,and him getting "angrier" with survivors as he does in the flicks
---
Alternatively, just tbag slowly. One slow crouch and release is very different to proper tbagging.
---
Same for me, every couple matches when i'm clearly winning this shit !

AN ERROR HAS OCCURRED AND THE GAME HAS BEEN UNABLE TO UPDATE YOUR RANK

When you wanna be in the hookers but your membership ran out

Just be glad you never had to experience pallet vacuums
---
Please be a troll
---
I bought the Outer Worlds, Death Stranding and the DBD battle pass. I'm attempting to very carefully split my free time between all three. XD
---
I'd like more creative game modes. Destiny 2 had my favorite concept. Something that was both PvE and PvP, with two teams competing against each other and being able to sabotage each other at select points. DbD version would be two teams of survivors competing, each with their own killer, and the survivors could sabotage each other if they so wished. 
---
Complicated concept, but I think there'd be a way to make it work.
---
Killers exclusively
---
Sooo Nebraska?
---
I'm a fan of giving the player more perk slots, but giving each perk a point cost, with the cap being the player's level. That way you can keep underwhelming perks and just make them a lot cheaper to equip. Bring 3 or 4 great perks or 10 underwhelming ones, etc.
---
Thank god that fucking idiot disconnected, otherwise this wouldn't have been possible.
---
Fuck off, not playing against that. It‚Äôs not a fun game, it‚Äôs not a challenge. It‚Äôs bullshit, lmao
---
The killer didnt even see or hear them bm. 
---
he could have just been BMing his team tbh, or just memeing?
---
Tbh you still havo one hand free, unlike with gen skill checks
---
And the doctor be there prescribing his "treatment" to the hurt killer
---
Jason is not about the traps tbf, he's more of a unstoppable fucker that never dies. He could run through pallets or have various weapons since in the movies he uses about anything to kill you. Plus he looks pretty cool and his theme song is fucking awesome
---
pretty much agree but the brand itself will bring people swarming in to the game (just like stranger things)
---
Something like..  
---
Two teams of survivors spawn on different maps with their own killers, whichever team finishes their gens first gets out and if not, a gate connecting both maps opens and now the remaining team has to survive 2 killers?  
---
However, if one killer kills his team first, then he can break the gate and enter the second map.
---
I think its less to do with effort and more to do with the fact that the game's foundation is a spaghetti coded dumpster fire of a mess and every single idea in this thread is put to better use in another game completely. Because it definitely ain't happening in this one, which is struggling to maintain what it currently has.
---
Always save. Need these sweet fglf stacks
---
If that's the case, then the 7 more Survivors get to repair gens in peace. It would work the same way it does with 1 Killer and 4 Survivors. One is chased, the 3 others are (hopefully) working on gens. 
---
If a skilled Killer is able to put enough pressure on all 5-7 gens to prevent the exit gates from getting powered, I feel like 2 Killers would be able to put enough pressure on 10-14.
---
Of course this is all just speculation and in reality I don't know how the games would turn out. Still, some kind of game mode would be pretty exiting for a game that's had only one game mode for 3 years.
---
Neeeh
---
The real question here is why are you playing two Nancies istead of Steve and Nancy?!?
---
1 Killer camps the other is chasing Survivors. That's how it will end. xD
---
It‚Äôs probably a 10 year old kid, there are a lot of them on PS4.
---
I'll set, you on fire. With gas and a lighter, you'll scream when I say I'll kill you that way.
---
I like all the hazbin Hotel memes ngl
---
You are right but imagine 2 Billys on Coldwind and they chase 1 Survivor and then the next and so on. (I know worst case xD) I already hate it if one Killer focus me but 2 is too much. xD I also thought about a 2 Killer mode but it's hard to make it work. How would Ruin work? Do you need to destroy both totems or just 1 and then are 4 survs not effected anymore? But I absolutely agree that we need more than "Play Killer,play Survivor and Kill your friends.":D
---
That was absolutely disgusting to watch and I loved every bit of it.&amp;
---
I guarantee that you're a toxic Survivor main
---
Crack a cold one and listen to some Infant Annihilator, that‚Äôs my dream lol.
---
I get that that's a real thing but its so strange that a person doesnt own the rights to their own face
---
La la ja la ja ja la
---
1, 2, Freddy's coming for you
---
3, 4 better lock your door
---
5, 6 better grab your crucifix
---
7, 8 I don't remember the rest
---
We already have two chainsaw guys that are almost identical
---
You can not play for multiple rank resets and come back after. Rank reset having been a month ago means nothing here.
---
I find games as killer in about 30 seconds. When playing Survivor however, it sometimes takes up to 5 minutes
---
turns out you lost karma
---
He stayed in for a good ten to fifteen seconds, no blood visible. Idk, maybe it just blended in so damn well into the wooden floor that I didnt see it.
---
 No
---
I feel really bad whenever I play killer and unintentionally dc due to either my parents checking on me if I was doing my homework, I accidentally turn it off like a dumbass, which ends up fucking the surv when all gens were done.I probably look like a huge cunt to those surv I dc on.
---
Nah its collective
---
I had a huntress bring an ebony Mori bc me and some friends where wearing exclusives, she got  2 kills, we got her again next game but she brought IRI heads instead, only got 1 kill.
---
She was salty
---
Did you read my post? He didnt have those perks lol, also, I'm pretty familiar with this game, I know at least vaguely what every perk is by name alone
---
whoooosh
---
Yeah, you"d need some kind of special map for it. IDV can do it because their maps are fucking massive compared to DbD's maps, and that allows them to stick 10 generators around there
---
Well I don't know what to tell you. Quick and quiet doesn't effect blood in any way. Being in a locker reduces moans of pain a ton on its own.
---
Oh God yeah. That video is hilarious. I made this bc I played against iri + belt, but they were against iri and *nothing*. That was so funny
---
Yea, but one of them is beloved by the community, and the other one is just used to unlock Enduring.
---
Oof you got negative karma
---
You don't bleed on the floor while in a locker.
---
Children of the Corn confirmed as next killer
---
CHILDREN OF THE CORN IS STEPHEN KING OMG
---
Plus imagine entity nea with n0ob3s voice
---
I didnt know that about lockers, that might explain it. The main reason I asked is because I was pretty sure it didnt have those effects, as like I said I'm pretty familiar with the game, but I dont actually use Q&amp;Q often due to not having the teachable yet so I didnt know for sure. That is on my list of the next teachables I want to grab
---
Anyone down to make a spin-off 'Mr. Hotbox' version?
---
Yeah capybaras are the ultimate symbol of peace
---
It's worth grabbing, a fast vault with no noise can cause confusion in a chase and it's useful just getting around the map quickly to do gens.
---
Survivor mains are the most entitled assholes in all of gaming, I swear.
---
I'm hella bad at nurse, and rank 10 is unforgiving.
---
I‚Äôm sorry little one
---
haha peak comedy
---
People are just trying to find literally anything to complain about. Survivors have a sheep mentality. If one person says Spirit is OP, than everyone says Spirit is OP.
---
I switched out small game for rainbow map nowadays. Way way waaaay reliable than small game
---
They do! But not when it directly corresponds to character they portrayed, it's very strange in a way
---
Sounds like a you thing rather than spirit lad.
---
I'm sure they had to get the Freddy rework approved.
---
She‚Äôs never been remembered on console...
---
i gOt TunNlEleD
---
When have you ever "had" to rank up. Low Ranks is unfair depending on your skill, but at the same time, it's so much more fun playing with survivors who just play casually
---
That Jake's outfit is honestly the best one yet for him
---
So imma be honest, I kinda got carried to red ranks by tryharding as Freddy, then since nurse is my BP farming killer, I somehow floated to rank 2 whilst farming and then I was like ‚ÄúLETS TRY HUNTRESS!!!‚Äù
---
I deranked almost outta red ranks because I‚Äôm so shit garbage at huntress.
---
Not the belt on its own tho, just the combination of the two.
---
Well running through pallets sounds like a completely fckn broken killer. How are the survivors meant to escape him?
---
Fill your hand you son of a bitch!
---
Wow this is actually a good meme
---
Dead rabbit makes it just 8 meters without M&amp;A.
---
A perk that teleports the survivor (or)/ the killer away when you get (a) hit
---
Lmao Moris need a rework!? Would you care to elaborate? Also noed is easy af to counter, CLEANSE THE TOTEMS
---
I love how this is getting downvoted, lol
---
What build do you recommend?
---
I've tried Clown a few times and I just suck SO BAD with him I can't do it. But if I can get 'ok' with him, I wouldn't mind buying the mascot outfit. Looks like it'd be fun.
---
No this is the new pig nerf :(
---
Always salty p3 claudette's calling me a camper even though I was no where near the hook
---
Forgot I was rancor and then after he let the other three go....wait till the end for crawling Steve over my dead body.
---
Marth is such a crybaby. I'm not questioning his skill at all but him and everybody in his twitch chat are stereotypical entitled killer mains. Got into an argument where a mod insulted me because I said current ds is ok as is.
---
Feng best girl
---
This is amazing :) I main Jake and love this skin, and this art is super well done :)
---
Am I missing something?
---
There's no doubt that they are.
---
I think u need a 150% gen repair buff
---
They're July discouraging it though, that's what I mean
---
People who suggest this always mention more gens aswell, which is flawed logic right there. Twice amount of killers = more of a killer sided game mode. Twice the survivors = Equal again! Meaning if both sides double their numbers, neutralizes each other. Adding more gens is not a part of the equation. It is ONLY going to be killer sided.
---
Option 1: 2 killers, 8 survivors, 5 gens
---
Option 2: 1 killer, 10 gens, 8 survivors
---
2009 Jason running scares the shit outta me
---
at least I'm smart enough to counter Spirit instead of screaming around "nO cOuNtEr!"
---
I guess you really don't reach even a double digit IQ
---
I think it's spirit players I dislike more than spirit the killer. Some combo of double purple addons, ebony moris, noed, abandoning chases to phase straight back to unhooked players, DCing if gates opened is what I usually get.
---
Can we get a s1 collection
---
You reckon lose the breathing or turn it down some.
---
Honestly part 6 is my favourite design
---
So I can just stay in a survivor match for ~9 minutes, let the killer hook/kill me and I'll get max xp? If so I'll just do that for an hour every day
---
I personally think this is a bad idea. The ones that are super toxic and try to bait you are usually good at looping and chasing. I try to leave them for later and not waste time I could use to hunt the ones that aren‚Äôt good at looping. I‚Äôll catch the toxic one in a mistake later on and they‚Äôll pay. 
---
Or maybe they get out, but the rest of their team does because the toxic one didn‚Äôt put enough time on objectives.
---
Thank you! I'm in the process of another Jake drawing and I can't wait to share it soon :D
---
Awesome draw!!
---
You don't really need a mic, so much as a team that understands which signal means "safe to unhook" and which signal means "I'm being camped".
---
Dropping pallets like insane and leading her to teammates isn't counter, u know. I can counter nurse by looking at her and see: 1)is she charge her blink or not 2) How long she charge blink 3)In what direction she looking for blink. This HELP me counter her, its Balanced.
---
Against Rin i can see what she: Stand still. And? I cant tell from which direction she coming, when she end phasing, nothing. No info, just coinflip
---
Nah, no scratched mirror, his heartbeat was there, but I guess she thought he was coming from a different direction? Not entirely sure, she wasn‚Äôt very bright, haha.
---
Oh shit, i remember that. The movie was not that good but Jason is fucking scary in it
---
Cleansing need buff /s

I'll wait the Michael Myers one, he,'s my favourite

Absolutely sure. I use it all the time on Piggy and Demo, their secondary attack does not add or remove stacks.
---
Yes. Deffinetly
---
Thats true. The concept will never work as it is planned at first. Practical adjustments will be made, and thats fine. Im just saying doubling two factors for killers and one for survivors isnt theoretically valid. In that case we might as well make it 6 hooks for each survivor, 2 killer shacks, and 4 hits to down etc
---
Whenever i use iri heads, the survivors that dc miss out on a free win...since im (not to brag) an expert shot with the hatchets, i usually down all of them quickly...the match usually ends with me giving them a win, and when they are being toxic about it, they get hooked

Came back to the game with Stranger Things, and holy fuck it has been such a grind. Thank god for those 2 Bloodhunts they gave us, but I still cannot play anything else than BBQ because the BP gains feel pitiful without it.
---
I still need to level around 5 more Killers for their teachables, and then start levelling them all again from 40 further to actually get those perks on them....
---
Haunted Grounds be like:

Part of why everyone runs Teleport on IDV I guess... didn't realize they were so much larger but you're right. It's kinda ridiculous tbh. Red Church is the only one to come close in size.

Just ... no.

If you have option 2, 7 survivors will always be on gen. Worst case 5 survivors will be on gen, 1 will get chased, 1 for totems and another following the killer to flashlight save the chased one. 
---
2 killers 8 survivors 5 gens just means the match will take 80seconds as 2 people get chased and 6 survivors are free to do gens.
---
I've only been playing this game for a week but the struggle is real!
---
Having said that, DbD is a game where losing is part of the fun to me!
---
They are cancer and they'll also be the downfall..they already are. I play both sides. Some matches I'd sacrifice everyone, some matches I'd only sacrifice one. Can't expect to have perfect runs all the time. &amp; for the devs to ruin the game to make those types of people feel better? Pfft. Sooner or later it won't matter what dlc they come out with; people just aren't going to come back. I'm waiting for someone to bring out something similar to scratch the itch.
---
Laughs in Ash Williams
---
Adrenaline is some strategical perk, if you don't use it the right way and with team is just a 3s boost to probable nowhere.
---
I love it, please make more of it!  
---
Nea is the best xD
---
Dude can't you be less specific? As if I have no life to watch the past 3 months VOD. What a 4head you are, seriously.
---
Not at all. You don¬¥t need Infectious for it to work. Sure, it helps and the synergy is great, but STBFL alone is worth it on some killers. It doesn¬¥t force you to ignore anyone on killers like Piggy or Demo since they can just use their secondary attack to not lose stacks. And even chasing a single person it allows you to get back on his tail so much faster so he doesn¬¥t get such a huge head start once you get the first hit in. It also works incredibly well when survivors try to swarm you and try to bully your cooldowns when unhooking someone or finishing a gen, you just demolish them. 
---
It¬¥s not top tier on all killers, you would be dumb to use it on a Nurse for example, but on some of them it is top tier and not situational at all.
---
Its passed its 50th anniversary so over 50 years
---
More like tea-party. You're pitting the silent generation versus a boomer.
---
Yes, SHE DIED!
---
Ha ha get outplayed
---
What's there to elaborate on? The game was an almost unplayable mess at launch. And while its made great improvements over the years, it's still has tons of bugs and glitches, a lot of which have been around for years. And this is due to their game's foundation.
---
Not only will the same type of bugs be around forever, but content like the ideas being made here will never happen. Not in this game at least.
---
Prob iron will or any stealth kinda perk . I would also trade selfcare for something else. Beeing able to heal yourself by ur own isnt that important any more. Use other perks to heal like inner strenght (nancy perk) or use a medikit. Most simple way ---&gt; let a teammate heal you. Change selfcare for another more usefull perk like borrowtime for an example. sometimes its more important to save a teammate then save yourself
---
Yes...
---
Played as Huntress, tried getting some hatchets from a locker and some Claudette stunned my ass and scared the ever loving shit out of me.
---
I love Head on üòÇüòÇ
---
nice "no u" argument. You keep surprising me
---
Problem is, lots of people actually believe that there is a problem with hitboxes, as seen in your comments, so if you would stop spreading misinformation that would be nice :)
---
Jason X???????
---
Yeah I'd love to see environment moris put into this but as long as you have to work for it or all the gens are done :P
---
If you don't like it don't play spirit
---
Cause all the sweaty noobs play spirit
---
Would make iron grasp and agitation just that little bit more fun to run.
---
Had this bug 2 times in 10 games, thanks bhvr
---
I thought it said the 11th or the 13th ish
---
Red Hatchets ain't fun to go against bud. Especially with infintry belt
---
Get the W
---
It‚Äôd be like mortal kombat stages and environmental fatalities are, to me, the best part about mortal kombat.
---
Finally, the nerf survivors want for killers
---
I wouldnt think so
---
In my professional Opinion! ZE HEAVY IZ DED!
---
I dunno, I think he shouldn't be able to channel pallets either
---
I'm not saying I want to stomp a Claudette into an enormous wood chipper.... But....
---
The thing is, there's at least SOME counterplay to Nurse (though a good Nurse will still be a nightmare). Spirit is almost as strong as Nurse, but is MUCH less interactive to play against.
---
As Survivor, vs Nurse, you see her charging her power, both of you have full knowledge of what's happening, and both of you can react. There's OFTEN something you can do, and if not, then you'd most likely get hit by a good Huntress in the same situation.
---
Vs Spirit, she uses her power (or fakes it) and you have like, 5 options to choose from (continue running away, walk, stand still, backtrack over scratch marks, vault) but you have NO idea which of those is the "correct" thing since you've got no information to work with. If you get hit, well, you just guessed wrong. If you didn't get hit, you're not rewarded cos you didn't OUTSKILL her, you just made a random guess that happened to work out.
---
The fact that she's also strong (and fun to play) is just the shitty cherry on top of a shitty cake since she you go up against her every other game.
---
Lol I know that it is. I was saying ‚Äú see People agree‚Äù. And technically they agree with me that Wraith is Weak as f**k and these devs are complete potatoes in terms of balancing and knowing their own game.
---
Flashlight blinds aren‚Äôt toxic, annoying as hell.. but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs toxic
---
What would you do differently if it was your project?
---
I don‚Äôt mind getting hit when I‚Äôm all the way through but right at the window, it makes sense. I do mind getting hit when I‚Äôm 3 steps away from the window and Stretch Armstrong still manages to whack me.
---
I do what I must because I can.  If spirit wasn't so braindead I wouldn't play her.
---
I agree with 1 and 2 I'd also add his bell is no longer directional (Clapper one) so survivors dont know which one ur one
---
I do not have perks, I just got spirit with shards and then proceeded to act like I had something.
---
I just afk and people think its a trap and leave.
---
Because that's not Jason..
---
Basically every killer is OP if trash Survivors can‚Äôt handle losing to it.
---
It might be, but spirit is so hated that my scumminess is undermined.
---
This is cute!
---
In addition to what the others have said, Jason makes use of whatever weapon - or even things that aren't normally weapons - is handy.
---
I often jump in my seat when I unexpectedly get a pallet thrown in my face
---
&gt; doesn‚Äôt understand this game very well
---
&gt; literally hates this game
---
You pretty much described half of this community.
---
Rancor and NOED? damn... that DR must‚Äôve been bullied by some SWF

If getting blinded at pallets makes them annoyed then they should really learn that blinding at pallets is something a survivor wastes time on WE HAVE EARS GUYS JUST LISTEN. Flashlight saves can be annoying but certainly not toxic

This felt like an action movie, the last second save, almost getting hit, everyone is so close.

We're so far beyond saturation point of this meme now that soon it'll become funny again

i'm on pc &amp; as a survivor it's almost instant most of the time, as a killer it takes 20+ minutes
---
&gt;claudette
---
unfortunately I can not find any items sold with serum, for example claudette head body and leg clothes for now, none of them can not be taken with serum, may be a different store ?
---
You can earn serums until the rift closes in about 59 days, then you have 2 weeks to use the serums before they expire.
---
No reason to flash at pallets, if you stun just run and save the flashlight up for saves.
---
Beyonce sweetie Im so sorry that a ugly ass bitch like this would even say that

That made me laugh harder than it should have.

"I don't give a fuck about stop responding to me"

Like can a human being be more stupid than you? Jeez, YOU started responding to me, 4head. Gtfo with your 0 IQ you illogical hypocrite.
---
Its mostly 1 gen if you get to activate it
---
Still, its a mediocre build with no thought behind it. It's by no means the perfect Myers build on him
---
Replace Adrenaline and get spine chill/alert/leadership/bound btw. It strong but in higher levels when it actives more and not as a baby.
---
I mean when i blind them i vault a window and disappear with dance with me and lithe thats why i blind at pallets
---
I do the same with my gf aswell :D üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë©
---
Why are you so upset? Just thought I would say shes a girl? Really no need for the lecture or the novel.
---
Trying to distract the killer (without being a dick) usually buys some time if other survivors are at the other door
---
Counter point, the clothes look cool and I'd feel bad if I missed out.
---
On Jake, Dwight, Claudette, Clown, Huntress, Trapper, Wraith, Plague, Spirit, Hillbilly and Hag
---
I mean you still get the same number of common and uncommon ... they just arent placebo map offerings.
---
What is that ?
---
 unfortunately I can not find any items sold with serum on these characters, there must be a problem in the store, pls look at my store looks like

Spirit = bad
---
This is getting old very fast
---
That's only if they miss the skill check. I'd suggest giving surveillance a go if you have it. Gen turns yellow as soon as a survivor touches it. If you can spare another perk slot and have surge available, give that a go too. Those to perks work really well together, especially on smaller maps üëç
---
For me it's Make Your Choice. 
---
I mean I use BBQ as well but I only have it as my drug for more bp
---
As a Freddy main i feel like i gotta say it, old Freddy was not that bad. Yeah he was no Spirit but you could get a couple 4k
---
S E L F C A R E
---
At the very top of the list of items, they‚Äôll have a yellow-y orange background to them with pumpkins on it
---
I‚Äôve found the face buttons to be the easiest to use; Y just happens to be the one I set it to and never changed. I know **several** other DBD players have requested the struggle function be reworked cuz of exactly what you described, but it seems BHVR doesn‚Äôt see this as a priority.
---
Well that's the point, getting new players. They get more money from new players and we get more content that's the whole point
---
Na, all you've made me want now is Dungaree Cat Man, the most brutal murderer to be graced by the entity.
---
*taps forehead* They cant do gen if they are hooked.
---
Saved up iridescent shards and bought spirit
---
thank u, I didn't choose a color from there before, it's really ridiculous.
---
I guess
---
And ?
---
No problem
---
you killed all probably, not only 2, so it was not balanced.
---
Yeah especially when playing Pig lol.
---
Thanks! I genuinely thought I was dead when I looked back and saw her chasing ME instead of the other two; that last second panic on her part during phasing is what saved me
---
Spirit bad survivors who DC good.. wow.. how original
---
Try to use this logic in any other PVP game. Try to do it in like, for Honor or rainbow six siege then come back and tell me how did it go
---
I don‚Äôt get it?
---
If they get blinded that means theyre bad its not toxic
---
Shit now we talking
---
I want to know this too. I‚Äôve been playing for a couple weeks (new) and I‚Äôm rank 8 now, almost 7. 
---
Am I good? Am I average? I have nothing to judge it against.
---
Where do you buy cosmetics with the serum?
---
Look at the UI
---
The hatch opened but there are 2 survivors
---
This made me sad
---
Ahahahah... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Hahahahahahahahahaha. The entitlement is incredible hahahahahahahahahaha
---
In the store on the specific hallowed blight/catalyst cosmetics you can press (PS4) square to buy with serum instead of cells
---
Yeah the store sucks to spend the serum ... for some reason they didnt think of making a separated tab for event currency cosmetics.
---
Congratulations too
---
It's an older meme, sir. But it checks out.
---
i know what your talking about, it was with the blinking guy
---
Well it should figure out the differential of my surv level and take ot into account. I may not be a great killer by anyeans but if I give ot a shot it can give me some rank 12-14 because I obviously have a firm grasp of the game being a rank 4 survivor
---
DC's suck on both sides. But survivors get punished by DC's more. They are either losing a teammate or if the killer DC's - depipping.
---
There really needs to be a system in place to stop victims of DCing from losing a pip.. That is the only thing that bothers me, really. Because sometimes DC happens accidentally.
---
Stand still for DC? thats toxic
---
This comment chain is an "How to lose karma tutorial".Downvote this so i can prove my point
---
Just, Yes please.
---
Glad you like the idea
---
Oh ok, so I guess their power would have something to do with splitting up their body. Maybe in the game you could leave your body parts around the map, and if a survivor steps on one, that body part latches onto them and starts to slowely hurt them until they go into the dying state. Just an idea though.
---
:c
---
i find legion really fun, probably because i like to run fast and stab, but my god. the rework they did was like taking your cat for dental work and somehow it comes out spayed and declawed with toys that need claws to even play with.
---
Ok, i bring some arguments why Spirit should be if not nerfed, but reworked, you still saying what i just should be "unpredictable" and "mind game". I bring arguments why i can mind game nurse, and why i can just coinflip Spirit. So, you still believe what i just need to "play different" and continue to fraud me, or bring some arguments instead?
---
Ding ding dong
---
Exaaaaaaactly! I was thinking the same thing!
---
You mean best killer?
---
Looks like we need some...corrupt intervention
---
Jason serves no one, he only kills for Mother
---
What about resilience? I use it quite a bit with iron will, but i dont know, if its a high impact on the games i play.
---
I just thought, that 9% extra speed, especcially for gens and vaulting should be considerable.
---
It was an exclusive item.
---
Yeah, that's one of the cosmetics that only certain YouTubers and streamers have access to
---
Is it me or the old clown that says *your fingers hand em over*
---
Leaving a name / identifying information is usually considered "witch hunting" and isn't allow and any sub, not just this one.
---
Wrong comment??
---
didnt know dio was a playable character
---
If you think just avoiding witch hunting is "corruption".. don't get even close to the official forum

This game could have build on map editor with extended rules you can modify to create a lot of different game modes including the one you posted.
---
Then you can use the custom game sercher similar to starcraft, download the specific map with and enjoy it. For sure some maps and mods gonna get popular providing deva with the info of what the community like and enjoy.

Big profit for DBD and an whole new lvl of poaying it.

So his ability would be to Overdose on the serum and go rampage?

they should do like in splatoon 2: give them a warning, two warnings then ban them for 5 minutes.

You don't have to apologize for anything my friend. It's normal to feel overwhelmed after though matches, irrelevant if you have been playing for 1 hour or a 1,000.
---
I can only give you 2 advices:
---
- 1: It's OK to DC.
---
I had a hard match yesterday on rank 6 where I only managed to kill 2 players. I was a bit upset but manageable. I loaded a new game and I found out that ALL players had Object of Obsession. So yeah, I just left the lobby. I think it's better to dodge some games sometimes, if that means less stress for you. 
---
- 2: Vent all you need!
---
It is important to keep a good mental health. If something bothers you, tell someone about it. They may not be able to help you, but I can assure you that you will feel much better after.

---
No I think his power would be shifting, kinda like the spirit but he wouldn't stand there, he'd disappear while his terror radius completely disappears.
---
Agree and I think should make noises generated by gens a bit louder or something niche like that
---
I love to play Ghostface, so I usually move around silently and crouching around the map. There has been plenty of times where a survivor and me just randomly meet up around a corner of a building or a loop and we end up scaring each other.
---
I absolutely love it xD
---
cool
---
I believe everyone is bitching about The Spirit right now, not The Plague lol
---
Its actually quiet funny when there is that one Meg/Kate/Nea following you around, running, vaulting, clickety-clicking just to taunt you for infinite looping and being a jerk.
---
Like yeah, im gonna go for the people actually doing their job first, thanks for being useless
---
Wasn't this how it was on the PTB when it was first changed and then bumped up to 85%? I agree, even with hillbilly you might not even get to the gen on time and is only really useful if you spot a survivor as it procs and you can sneak up to them.
---
Don't worry he'll be coming in once his game dies. Before anyone mentions the Trapper I'm gonna stop you right there because there is a big ass difference in them, one uses thinking to catch his prey and Jason is a unstoppable tank that prefers straight up wrecking everything in his path.
---
Vizio 32in
---
&gt; because you are slowed down, you want to release it as soon as possible, but releasing it a tiny bit too early ruins the entire thing 
---
I couldn't tell you how many times I have done this.... really, really, really frustrating.
---
Tip:  
---
Run better "killer avoiding" perks, until you get experienced with chases. Mine was Feng Min's combo. You'll get gens done and totems cleansed (quickest way to PIP and BP), most of the time knowing where killer is, and whether he's coming your way.
---
Alert: Gives you an accurate idea what is he doing (chasing, just breaking pallets, direction he's going, which killer is it). This perk later will be replaced with your own experience. You'll know more or less when killer is chasing, and his whereabouts.  
---
Spine Chill: If killer doesn't break pallets, and you don't hear heartbeat (stealth killer ie), you can start hiding, getting to safer spot, before he gets to you.  
---
Lithe/Balanced (Lithe is better for startup): the "f\*\*k this s\*\*t im out" perk. It'll give you some distance from the killer to plan where to go, pallet, loop, window, shack, etc, if you're not near one. If you are near a loop, pallet, window, then you can loop there, Lithe will give you an extension of that chase (at that point, rank \~10, usually killer leaves you once they see you Lithing away, as it'll waste so much killers time to catch up)  
---
4th perk is up to You. Self-Care, Inner Strength, Deliverance, DS are good to fill the blank. I ran Iron Will for some time
---
Once you get higher ranks, you'll start replacing them to fit your own playstyle. This combo above just gives you great awareness of your team and killer, and lets you prepare for it. With this you can expect easy rank 4-5 if used correctly.
---
If you're not SWF at all, i think Spine Chill is mandatory, unless you're very confident in looping or have great situational awareness.
---
A lot of perks were gutted from PTB to release for no good reason. Surge was also 12 percent extra regression and they bumped it down to 8, even though the perk rarely hits more than 1 gen (sometimes not even that) and has a cooldown...
---
Game allows it so, you should blame the devs, you can't really change players
---
Me
---
hm
---
talked with this vigo, I have
---
collecting this nectar from flowers, he was
---
Hm. perhaps a good substitute for ketamine, We have thought the vials are
---
So snorted it, we have
---
Good shit, it was
---
But, Kinda weird, we now look
---
LOOK LIKE A BISON‚ÄôS PENIS, THIS FLASHLIGHT DOES
---
I think the Desperation would have some interesting characters of Stephen King to bring in, if at all. As they're all just people being affected by an ancient evil. It could easily be replaced in lore by the entity.
---
Everyone likes the original killers of course. That said, the game has all the classic killers except Jason already, so it feels out of place not to have him.
---
Once a cocky group of survivors used that one strategy of "blocking the person cleansing a totem with your own body". You fools, your insta heals only make my STBFL stronger.
---
Note to survivors: Just leave
---
Yes, killers can show their redstain for a moment to lead survivors in one direction then moonwalk around
---
No, Ghostface doesn't give information apart from still being visible. 
---
Myers in T1 has like 105% speed. 
---
I answered your random questions... But did you honestly think any of those were arguments? Don't compare apples to oranges, exaggerate a statement, and then walk away like you proved any point other than you have no ability to reason lol.
---
On realese she was a lot weaker. The power took 20 seconds to recharge instead of 15, her lunge was half what it is now, survivors could alway ear you while invisible when you were close, your husk looked different from you, the sound you made while invisible were directional and became stronger the closer you were, meaning that anyone with good headphones could basically see you, your passive phasing happened a lot less frequently, she didn't have the addon that breaks her (no sound when phasing).
---
She is definitivly OP now, but she was really weak at release.
---
know what Hazbin hotel is, I do not
---
but know how to make ketamine out of blighted Pustulas, I do
---
want some, you do?
---
Yeah, except he told many times that in modern meta of effortless healing sloppy isn't really a good perk. It's a good perk for starters / at low ranks.
---
Nope weve had them on pc for about a month now, thats why it feels like killers have some wacky lunge ranges.
---
Whats interesting is that all the killer has to do is hit you once on their side and not server side, so lagging huntresses are actually impossible to outplay cause the hatchet can effectively hit you around corners
---
As long as Friday the 13th game exists, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd put him in DBD. There‚Äôs no need for him to be in 2 titles, especially if he has his own game already which is a very fun altern. To DBD
---
Well yes, it is a bug borne from a bug. But that's the point, having multiple killers or double of everything would likely be buggy as fuck and we all know how DBD is held together with string and rubberbands every patch.
---
Wutface, rank 1 takes forever, often 5 mins
---
Didn't the devs say that Jason had a great chance of coming out in the future?
---
There is already a perk that does that.
---
2560 x 1080 support. Colorblind settings. Two things we‚Äôll never receive. üòì
---
Yep, is like 10% of invisible bar you have to charge. Missed a lot of hits releasing "too early" on a full bar.
---
Jane, move your now not most T H I C C and hot Ass in game from 1'st place
---
Because he is a very popular youtuber that was promoting the game.
---
too old for this shit
---
Well when he just saw them use balanced landing 6 seconds before...
---
Unless i'm so sleep deprived I'm missing the obvious, i'm on xbox so I don't think I can do that lol
---
r/wooosh
---
The hallowed blight ended a year ago, but I thin you mean the withered blight which end in the 13th
---
I don't mean this as a sleight, but if you arent enjoying playing games and only get joy from attacking other people, you may need to seek professional help. Talking to a therapist may help you not feel the need to intentionally upset others and may help reignite your passion for gaming. You may have underlying problems you arent aware of. Good luck man.
---
"Trucks" and/or "Maximum Overdrive"
---
I would love a map with a lake in the middle, but that map may be extremely survivor sided just because of the lake.
---
Ooh
---
I had it yesterday while playinh my bad bad bad nurse against a claud... I was a little confused :|
---
&gt; attacking xd
---
if you get offended from somebody calling you bad then it's your fault lol.
---
i'm well aware of my problems and i don't give a fuck. i play to get better and being a cunt is the way i tend to spend mu free time to feel somewhat alive. maybe because i'm also a league player where people aren't snowflakes, idk.
---
Literally all spirit needs is a more obvious glow when she is phasing bc standing still shouldn't be a mind game it just shouldn't
---
Impossible.
---
can..
---
fixed it
---
TP around the map so a stronger freddy? Or like as copy paste nurse?
---
I stand by my idea of having an unranked mode with whatever that brings, and having ranked rewards based on highest rank achieved that season.
---
You know what? mission passed. respect+
---
but only if you didn't actually camp and were just proving them wrong, cause god survivors will tell you that you camped if you are on the same plane of existence as them (just like killers will justify camping with stupid excuses).
---
Your dad only left because he found out that your mom was gay
---
they.. what? they're allowed to readjust the powers how they want
---
r/buildapcforme is your best bet. 
---
You can also give them the minimum/recommended requirements for DBD that you can easily find online, but honestly any PC for 900 dollars will run this game pretty damn well.
---
(Also build it yourself. It is really not hard at all, a very fun, rewarding experience, and there is very little to actually fuck up if you follow some good youtube guides)
---
I think the better solution would be to remove god loops? It's unnecessary to have them, and basicaly forces the killer to either nut up for a 3 minute chase, or bail. Leaving them to run to it again if they get caught out.
---
Also haddonfield fences that can sometimes spawn like 500m long
---
lol wait its still not over?!?
---
you still didn't catch up?
---
i said i coexist with society. not enjoy life around others.
---
..wait, do you guys actually empathize with ppl you don't actually give a fuck about?
---
Oh my god I am a Honda Civic
---
That is not your work.
---
If this was your essay oh, these links would be supplied at the back of the paper as your resources. If your essay was presented in a format like Wikipedia, these Lakes would have been sighted at the bottom of the page as resources. Both of these links show a different understanding of lag np2 P connections and or dedicated server and how a player or client connection effects. Your post has a drastically different understanding of any of the subject presented in the links. So you did not show your work, you presented links to two other people who are able to describe the content much better than you had attempted. Sorry.
---
My friend had this bug too
---
Went for the save yesterday. They escaped but I got caught. Felt good though.
---
Isn't Putrid serum in the Rift as a reward tho?
---
The only thing is that all but the recharge rate of her power were changed that were given to her on her release from the ptb. She has had no major changes to her or her power since release yet still the opinion on her has changed quite heavily on her anyways.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt think so
---
No
---
Standard explosion regression + additional 8%, as it says in the description.
---
All in range, as it says in the description.
---
M1
---
This but unironically
---
Sorry mate, I think he wanted a fucking capybara, not a dancing one
---
Play whoever you want with whatever perks and strategies you want. There aren‚Äôt really many real rules telling you not to play certain ways except for stalling the game at most.
---
13th I believe
---
Cool, thanks. I was just unsure.
---
Sounds like a pretty strong perk imo. Not the best, but pretty good overall
---
Who tf is jason
---
Don't forget about Killer's that do that when you don't escape after playing well
---
One day....
---
You know the killer, I‚Äôm just saying he needs a major rework in order to be in the game.
---
the amount of times i get a gen to about 70ish% then hide. killer comes looks around like 2 trees, breaks gen and leave and im now able to complete the generator with no worries.
---
I've seen people recommend it on stealth killers that have better ways of downing people near generators.
---
I could see it being great on ghost face.
---
So basically 2 different games, but able to see other game's survivors and killers?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking. I can‚Äôt wait to try it out
---
I think hes already going to be too OP
---
That‚Äôs not the purpose fo dead hard, using it to avoid Ana track is a last resort. It should be used to lunge towards pallets or windows if the killer will hit you before you can make it.
---
I felt like balance team proposed two options "well, we can nerf her base kit, so even with long range add-ons she have a down time for survivors to use; OR we could change all her add-ons that make her strong", and HQ be like "why not both?".
---
Have you been killed by a Jason? Nobody has.
---
Your have to race against the other team or you die and you can point your killer in the direction of enemy survivors
---
By the holy lord of memes, i say that you the one who should do this
---
He's speaking the language of the Gods
---
1. it says 8% but thats an additional 8% with the original 10%,
---
2. how many are in range
---
3. M1 attacks
---
Not trying to dismiss your point, but maybe he was trying to make you chase him so the other could do gens. That is, unless he sent toxic messages after the match
---
It requires skill, that or i cant use the flashlight, and a flashlight save is perfect for those tunnelers who has hooked one person twice...i see it as a non-toxic play....
---
It happens to me too.. It's just so much pain...
---
If it's not possible to sell for extra cash, they won't make it.
---
To be fair I would be suprised if they actually don't have a concept for him in the drawer and are just waiting for him to crawl out of his lawsuit. After all I think we would have him ages ago if we could.
---
0.4 seconds later*
---
"having fun"
---
I think he is gonna own.  Seeing survivor auras, teleporting, phase walk, stalking, throwing knives,  insta mori on grab unless survivors run pocket knives.
---
Yeah...thats the definition of toxic plays lmao
---
Oh he‚Äôs already in the game, but he is so awful it must have been erased from your mind.
---
Oh, alright, I confused Tome I with the levels of the Tome I itself. Thank you all for clarification!
---
Oh, I'm well aware of the stuff that's affecting my stress level. My mouse has been doing the weird dragging thing for no reason for a minute now. it would happen off and on and I've been wanting to get a better one anyway. I think this was more of a "this is a good excuse to break something type of thing." Breaking something has always been a good outlet for me. I've tried working out for stress and it really didn't do much of anything for me. Breaking something has always been a cathartic feeling after something's broken or torn to pieces.
---
Trapper 2.0
---
disarming them? you don‚Äôt need a tool box
---
But he is in mortal kombat
---
I hate when it happends
---
Decided to put together a simple image to illustrate how much of a nightmare DBD is if you have any sort of visual impairment.
---
Hopefully this makes it far easier for people to understand why filters are needed.
---
Note that if you're using Windows 10 then you can enable filters through Ease of Access - these filters were used to generate E, F, and G.
---
**I deleted my original version because two of the filters were the wrong way around - this is the corrected version.**
---
Nope only baby‚Äôs find it toxic. I got called toxic pretty much just cause I would not let a Myers get to tier on me lll
---
I don't really think being in a multiple titles is a problem, he's already in Mortal Kombat as well so only question is that if it's possible to get him into direct competition to his own game. If we put the lawsuit aside ofc.
---
Wrong sub I think. Or you're just trolling
---
/u/Peanits could you please confirm the first point in here if you have the time? Does Surge explosion count as 10 percent regression and then it adds extra 8 for a total of 18, or does Surge only regress by 8 percent (and then continues with normal regression)?
---
Seen some confusion about it, as the 10 percent explosion regression is usually tied to missing a skill check and not sure if it¬¥s the same explosion with Surge.
---
Anything with a 1060 6GB or higher and a quad-core should do the trick
---
It‚Äôs good on Freddy because his dream snares allow for very quick downs if you use them effectively.

And that's how game used to be, to be fair. Add-on-less wraith, trapper, doctor, clown, a lot of people have it really hard even with add-on-less Billy. And all of a sudden "people rely on add-ons  too much when they play Nurse"! Like, really? Is it strange?
---
I need mr hockey man
---
I know that i hit rank 6 after 90 hours (as survivor) (playing both sides) Now i have 170 hours played
---
Wait for an invite email
---
Only if I‚Äôm feeling particularly nasty that day. Usually just add ons for speeding up gen teleport though. I actually use class photo a lot too and it‚Äôs really effective at faking people out.
---
Plague is in a fairly good spot ngl. Maybe more consistency with the vomit but that might be a ps4 issue
---
From what I understand, the explosion counts as being kicked. So if a survivor doesn‚Äôt tap it, it continues regressing. If a survivor is working on it, it explodes, and the survivor keeps working on it, it stops regressing. Otherwise, it keeps regressing.
---
Regardless, it does 18% total regression, or about 15 seconds. Sounds like a strong perk to me
---
A nea tried to do that to me last match. She finally moved when someone got downed thanks to NOED.
---
&gt;..wait, do you guys actually empathize with ppl you don't actually give a fuck about?
---
Yes? It's what nearly everyone does. Disregarding empathy for strangers isnt the normal thing to do. I really meant what I said before. You may want to talk to a professional. Disassociation can be dangerous for the person experiencing it. If not for those around you, do it for yourself.
---
When the killer destroys a pallet. He can't see anything but the pallet. There is no need.
---
Mindgames, not respecting pallets.... hitting you
---
Otz turns the corner and sees a survivor ‚Äúhai‚Äù
---
Not everyone plays immediately after reset
---
good arguments I guess? "you clearly don't understand what I'm saying, so I won't explain what it means and assume I'm right you're wrong!"
---
The discussion is strictly about when in chase, what indications does she have and how to counter said indications. You said vacuum noise is on 24/7 which is objectively false, there's no argument there. You additionally said all she has to go by while in phase is scratch marks which is also objectively false.
---
Stop posting this damn cartoon here. We all know it's great, but stop, it not even funny anymore.
---
They could make him destroy pallets but make him slow since he only walks on the movies, and just give him a bunch of weapons since the man is not picky
---
I dont think you are fine, my guy. And I don't think you think you are. Lacking empathy doesnt make someone interesting. Its not something one should be proud of. You can be better.  You've got this.
---
Yup happens from pallets and also if a survivor suddenly leaps out of a locker
---
Ya know I used to be all about the pallets and couldn‚Äôt be fucked to use snares but snares are actually far more effective at high ranks. When every survivor is optimally running loops, forcing them to take the slow down or widen their loop is great.
---
Pretty please?
---
I dunno man it's pretty funny.
---
Yeah 12, my bad.
---
i guess i should just stop responding then for you to shut up.
---
you can't return empathy. i never had it, either.
---
For sure. I haven't seen too many/any comments going quite that far, but if someone does respond to 'I like Clown' with a huge-ass list of why he's crap and shouldn't be played, without even being asked...well that IS too far. Let people play how they want.
---
There is definitely a fine line though. Pointing out how a killer needs a buff is important, in my opinion. Like, when I play Legion, I don't want someone ranting to me about how Legion is trash, I should play a different killer, etc. But if they say 'he needs a buff', I'll agree, and I agree that it should be mentioned. Negatives about kilers should be expressed so that something actually happens. If nobody had complained publicly about Freddy, he may never have been reworked; devs would have just said 'people play him, and nobody seems to be complaining about him, so I guess he's good.' Same with Legion. I want people to respect my choice to play a sub-par killer, but if the conversations about how he's bad all suddenly ended, he might never be buffed. I would LIKE him to be buffed, so I can have fun AND get more kills. But I don't want him reworked or to have his powers change fundamentally. 
---
If anything, I think Legion has a perfect flavour buff that could be given to them. Have the other 3 Legion members sitting all across the map, giving a low-level 'false' terror radius when you get close, and giving the killer a unique notification. Essentially Joey yelling to Frank that they've found a survivor. Legion's whole shtick is that there's four of them lurking in the shadows, the survivors should be constantly assaulted at all times by terror and omnipresent danger. As it stands, unless I'm running that rare add-on that projects the terror radius across the map when I'm in Frenzy, you can easily see Legion coming from a distance and he's just not giving a feeling of overwhelming terror.
---
I'm not sure how one would fix the Clown as I don't try to play him often enough.
---
Yep.
---
But what do you do when there's no pallet and it's just a haddonfield fence, or a set of cars that you can't throw hatchets over, or basically any indoor map with loads of windows and line of sight blockers? The loops that suck are the ones where you don't need a pallet to waste incredible amounts of time in the most braindead fashion, where you basically hope you're playing a killer with mobility or you just abandon the chase
---
Having Protanopia in DbD must be absolutly horrible.
---
Thanks for the Compilation, its really educational. Hopefully they will enable any sort of Filters soon, so many Games already do.
---
Oh wow. Lmao. Today I'm going to walmart to buy a 40 inch Vizio 4k at walmart. Wonder if its good
---
Kinda unfortunate, but that's still pretty funny.
---
There are a few certain things that I think should always be welcomed in this place.  
---
Namely Hazbin and Team Fortress 2.   
---
They can have crossover memes whenever they want, they deserve it
---
I will never not upvote posts like this. More games need colorblind options enabled
---
I'm soo trying for it some game when I want to cut some slack xD
---
He‚Äôd have to have multiple abilities, I feel like f13th the game actually nailed his powers. I think that he should be able to at least morph to cover ground if he has to move slower than the average killer
---
no, she vomits in a chase.
---
Alright man. I get it. Have a good day. And go see a doctor. From someone that struggles with mental illness myself, you might surprised by how much it helps.
---
Then have I good news for you friend, 6 months after a fodt closes the outfits in the paid track will be made available in the Store
---
I agree.  There was a comic made a whole back where he did drop her and Meg Sprint Bursted the hell away.  I was hoping for that.
---
Whenever I get Quentin in a random locker, yes
---
i don't care
---
I love being altruistic, but just yesterday we dove in as 3-man to save that one hooked claud from a NOED Ghostface.
---
Instead of 1 Sacrifice he made 3 including me. Running away is selfish, but often kills the savior instead, or just gets both killed.
---
I¬¥ll still be altruistic tho.
---
When is his cousin getting added?
---
My problem with Snares is one I have with traps and the like, being I never get any down before I find somebody, and I'm trying to pressure through constant chases, so I have no time to set more up.
---
Thanks Obama

Yeah man like others have said just keep trying. I was incredibly intimidated playing killer at first, I also have only been playing for two months. And while I'll admit the losses are a lot more frustrating than Survivor I think the wins are ten times more satisfying and fun. I'd also suggest trying hillbilly, he's who I did at first. He's good for starting out because you can use his chainsaw Sprint to move around the map quick, don't expect to get kills with it at first. He's also one of the killers with the fastest base speed so decent enough as an M1 killer. Another bit of advice try and save up about 500000 BPS from playing Survivor to dump it into one killer so you can start off with some good perks. Trying killer at first with only one or two low perks is never going to be fun. Good luck and keep at it, killer is so ridiculously satisfying.
---
Create a ring map with a lake in the middle, have it be shallow and have it hinder survivors and maybe killers going through it
---
Funny that I love both maps. But I'm a fun of jumpscare killers.
---
Not if the killers can swim and the survivors couldn't though.
---
Thanks man! I feel so proud
---
That happens pretty often on PS4 unfortunately. People are bitter so they don‚Äôt want others to gain points too, it‚Äôs not fair for survivors.. You really can‚Äôt do much about it though
---
thats like, your opinion man
---
I know, but it's fine because I haven't been enjoying red ranks
---
Everytime I get bmed by a Demogorgon, I cant help but laugh, its even kinda cute if you ask me.
---
Im not sure what it is though, maybe its because demogorgans head looks like a scrotum and he looks like he is full of pure innocence? Im not sure.
---
Not a disrespectful one, but apperantly my trapper outfit (it is mix of different sets) was so ugly, it distracted one of the guy and he couldn't be able to play the game. As a result of which I got 4k and I should throw my money out the window (mind that not all the sets are locked behind auric cells) next time. At least that's what he said in the post game chat. And devs say these cosmetics are not p2w. Well I got 4k due to chaos and distraction caused by my outfit lol
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth even trying to get into red ranks, it‚Äôs just not fun
---
Just a weak tier 3 myers?
---
I mean, F13 is still out. It runs. Jason isn't that free to move around until it's gone.
---
Plus, what would his power be? Not dying? More beartraps?
---
I have done the bloodpoints thing already, but with the trapper, my trapper is level 15 because of my savings from survivor round, but I never considered billy, I always assumed I‚Äôd miss, but I think you might be right about hillbilly, he does instadown with his chainsaw after all, I‚Äôll invest my bloodpoints in him and try him next time, thanks for the tips and encouragement
---
Spirit?
---
I did a 360 and I pull down a pallet in the killer's face, next I blind with the flashlight to him. He did rage quit.
---
Easy
---
Exactly I love spine chill my dude
---
Wraith can be a monster of a killer, and if you know how to play him can really bully survivors. I'm a rank 2 wraith main and my favourite build is:
---
STBFL, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher and Nurse's Calling
---
For add-ons, I go with the purple All-Seeing which lets you see survivor's auras when you're cloaked within 12 metres, and the purple Swift Hunt which tremendously decreases reappearance time. With Nurse's and All-Seeing, you practically know where survivors are all the time. Sloppy makes healing take even longer so you get better use out of Nurse's, and with Swift Hunt you can jump out of cloaked form really fast and get that hit in while they're not expecting it. I find these perks have really good synergy with each other and are complemented really well by the add-ons. Give it a go, you might enjoy it.
---
Same goes for Pop.
---
No, i was just a little late with the screenshot.
---
The Ui showed the hatch way before and even he was confused about it
---
Had a Ace teabag me the start of the game as Pig caught him did one quick teabag moved on he gets unhooked and instead of hiding her starts trying t get my attention and teabags I take him out in seconds again and give him to teabags this time and then he DCs
---
Trapper cries while seeing this post  ;-;
---
Weak? Oh boi less vault and lunge. Weak
---
Wow, that seems like a good build, I definitely have to take some time to get used to wraith though, my first time ever I tried wraith but something either went wrong or I just didn‚Äôt know how to play him, could definitely need the swift hunt though, that was a struggle that one time
---
That is true
---
*idiotic.
---
So much for calling someone else a moron.
---
............ Ok boomer.
---
Lots of truth here.  Those melee-ranged hits seem to be much harder to hit than a short range toss, though. Say maybe 5-10 meters?  The way people lag these days it's better to give them some space.
---
That lunge makes t3 myers strong Plague still gets looped easy.
---
Probably something similar to the Rage mode from F13th the game
---
I‚Äôm not arguing with you,  but how would Jason be OP? We don‚Äôt even know what his abilities would be. 
---
Like for example, being impossible to kill doesn‚Äôt help him in DBD.
---
Lol put me on with the skin! Sounds pay to win for sure lmaoo
---
Watch out, they'll go for your Tra La La next
---
I never said Spirit was okay. I do believe she needs a rework, but to say she is impossible to counter would be a mistake. As a matter of fact i think it is too hard to know when it is safe while/after getting chased by her.
---
I vault any windows or read them like a book and trick them into returning to window or going around directly to me. Never really failed and even if it doesn‚Äôt work, it doesn‚Äôt fail, because they leave that area.
---
Talking from a console trapper/hag perspective
---
Hmm...this might help me even...not a baby survivor, just still not use to playing survivor...was killer main for a long time
---
Yeah I think the view of Wraith as a face camper is where a lot of the general annoyance for him comes from. He's an extremely viable killer right up into the higher tiers, but most people don't really play him optimally. Stealth killers are all quite similar; GF's stalk is actually pretty trash, but using the 0 terror radius to sneak up and get a Sloppy Butcher hit on them is a much better way to play him. Michael is a bit different what with having the instadown and increased speed at T3, but the STBFL/Ruin/SB/NC build would still work great.
---
Could you link a source? It would explain why huntress hits me behind corners lmao
---
So you want to use the word idiot in adjective form? Weird... almost like theres another word for that.
---
Waaaaait... was I in this match? I can remember a game somewhat recently where the ending went exactly like this lmao
---
:)
---
Neck yourself with the holier-than-thou shit, neckbeard.
---
"bUt AlL kIlLeRs ArE vIaBlE sOmE aRe JuSt HaRdEr To PlAy!"
---
&lt;3
---
I‚Äôll just vault or mind game them with my bloodstain and terror radius. Never failed unless you count scaring them away from that loop.
---
Talking from a console trapper/hag perspective here. Now if I wanted to make it easier I can just trap the loop and FORCE them to abandon it. I don‚Äôt need a perk when I got traps.
---
Holy crap,  from the survivor side it‚Äôs like she had two katanas doing a whirlwind attack
---
Yeah but unlike DBD is has a fuck ton of variety for *everyone*. Not just killer
---
I agree, it notifies then the gen pops straight after.  Feels like it notifies at 95%!  Not enough time to get there even with Billy missy of the time.
---
u feel proud because for your rank in a video game?
---
jesus
---
I main survivor because I have enough patience for about 3 minutes of lobby queueing nowadays
---
Realistically thinking we probably won't get Jason, but a man can dream
---
They gave you hope and then devoured it.
---
bUt wE AlReAdY hAvE A tRaPpEr
---
Been looking forever to find someone with a higher iq than 30...i have recently been getting called out on being trash for getting a 4k with plague...played against survivor rank 4-9...where the toxic players breed and multiply like rabbits
---
Imagine if everyone just complained about the weakest Killer, just to see how far they could get them nerfed.
---
Legion walking around with a squeaky toy giving comforting backrubs to Survivors.
---
Insta heal graffiti nea cant hurt you, she isnt real
---
I completely quit, unless they're VERY close.
---
It is, a filter is borderline necessary, and because there's no option for it for those on console you're forced to play on PC if you want to be able to see.
---
God you're a douche. Guess that's what you got for teabagging at the exit when the killer isn't even around.
---
It's enough to scan everything while focusing on generators.
---
Nah, if she got corrupt purge active then she is so annoying to play against....its basically a vomit then attack or vomit twice to down them...
---
&gt; oddly absent
---
Because she takes more skill and commitment now than before. She's still fine annoying and clunky but fine, just need a bit of patience. 
---
I'm still a no add on Nurse main, i'll keep on rocking 4ks :)
---
Yeah happened a few times...its one thing when u jumpscare them, its another when they jumpscare u
---
&gt; her hair makes a V shape
---
That's all you got? This isn't counterplay and anyone can just change her hair lol.
---
Ehh, to be honest I think he has too much that he can do to properly place him in DBD with just one-two powers.
---
 Not to mention one of the if not the best thing about the movies is him finding multiple ways to kill. You just can't have that in DBD.
---
 I just hope he gets out of legal hell, and they make a sequel to the F13 game, because bugs aside that shit is be 100% better than anything DBD can do with him
---
Outlast 2...little jumpscare that make u die inside
---
Cool story bro.
---
Yes, yes!  Every time I play him I want this.  A noise just to let you know when you can let loose.  It's very frustrating because when you charge survs pull away.  Need to do it exactly when it's charged.
---
Maybe experience will solve the problem, but I won't get experience, I get so frustrated and give in!  Only play him when I'm in the mood or have a daily.  Other than that he's fun though.
---
Was that a huntress main?
---
Nah, hillbilly one
---
In saminations dbd animations The huntress speaks like this lol
---
I believe only people who whine about plague are idiots cleansing all the time and who have to deal with corruption basically all the time.
---
*And here we see the next survivor buff in the form of a passive ability, known to the dev team simply as "Go Fuck Yourself"*
---
Unfortunately, that is not how English works. "Idiot" is a noun. So in this case using the NOUN, "idiot" would make more sense if I said "you are an idiot".
---
Epic gamer moment
---
One time when I had 7/8 totems cleansed I just rescued a purple rank Meg from hook. I kept nodding NO when she was doing a totem, the killer after match told me they saw this and focused said Meg because he had the same challenge the night before and felt my pain (I had to deal with these kinds of teammates 5 matches in a row). Meg wasn‚Äôt happy with me despite rescuing her AGAIN after. Killer got 3k I escaped.
---
Maybe The Entity appears in the form of his mother. It worked for Freddy in Freddy vs. Jason.
---
Spirit isnt weak...no killer is weak if you know how to play with them...
---
As a Survivor Main (because you can't play killer with friends, which would be funny as hell. I play killer as well!!! ) on PS4 - everytime my team is potato or I just f'd up - I just go to the killer and stand in front of him/her. If he/she let's me escape I most of the time teabag at the Gate two times as I want to say "Thank you" and message the Killer the same thing - Thanks. I mean, not every Killer let one Survivor escape. It's their choice and I'm always happy, if they leave me alone or let me escape...~ so thanks to every  Killer, who sometimes let survivors escape! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Variety in what exactly? Survivor variety? There were like 3 survivors that could stand up to a competent Jason. (The only stats that really mattared were repair, stamina and luck) 
---
Jasons themselves? Oh, right, you have 8 Jasons with misc changes (yes, they did change the way you play, but not nearly to the same level as DBD did), and a hacked Jason X that had no hitbox (that was a particularly fun one), not to mention the hell Jason that is just better than other ones. 
---
Perks? Oh, right, 80% of useless perks, 20% of broken ones. At least DBD actually tried balancing.
---
The sad part is that if you feed the filtered images back into the simulator, it's still extremely difficult to pick out gens if you have problems with red or green.
---
I should probably have added an extra row showing what the filtered version "actually looks like", as opposed to how it looks to the typical viewer.
---
Personally I‚Äôve adjusted to the basekit change and made it back into red rank with the new Nurse. 
---
I think the only real criticism I have right now is that Survivors are now given far too much leniency against Nurse. It‚Äôs way too easy to make a mistake and go unpunished against Nurse. That‚Äôs why a balance change I had in mind would revert the basekit nerf but expand on her fatigue stun.
---
Make pain sounds omnidirectional, darken the screen more, Prevent Nurse from moving, and increase the base stun duration. This way Survivors are given a much more tangible window to escape the Nurse but there‚Äôs less forgiveness for error against her.
---
why I don‚Äòt play ghostface
---
I wish i got baby doctors...only doctors i get are tunneling campers...but i hope for your sake he uses reddit bud
---
I'm a Jason fanboy and I'd love to see him in the game once the annoying lawsuit is resolved. But they really need to release more kills/moris in this game. Jason with only a single kill is sacrilege.
---
Meanwhile we still don‚Äôt have a werewolf, vampire, Frankenstein‚Äôs monster, dr jeckyl/mr. Hyde, swamp thing, zombie, alien, or robot. PLENTY of non-licensed characters that could be awesome.
---
Then there are licensed characters like pinhead, pumpkin head, jeepers creepers scarecrow, gremlins, chucky, Pennywise, xenomorph, predator, the Thing... just off the top of my head but the list goes on.
---
All this to say that there‚Äôs a ton more creative content other than Jason, who really wouldn‚Äôt be different from what we already have in the game.
---
True, but then it's far from a perfect build.
---
I like that. More maps should have environmental things specific to that map. Kinda like how the Hawkins Laboratory has custom gates, other maps should have things like bogs, shifting walls and such. I know that it sounds unbalanced so maybe add a casual mode to test these things out first?
---
Well, Copyright only lasts so long. Eventually, the rights to Jason will expire and they won't be able to stop the devs!

If you have protanopia you just can‚Äôt play killer
---
There wasn‚Äôt even anyone there to see the teabag. I was doing it because I started recording. Also I don‚Äôt see it as teabagging I see it as twerking.
---
1. Not fool proof &amp; a waste of a perk slot against every other killer if you got any situational awareness.
---
1. I can still hear your breathing and footsteps + Stridor is a thing (also a perk shouldn't be required to be used to even have a chance vs a killer).
---
1. Again, i can hear your footsteps and breathing, also i can bump into you and it's not really hard to predict which way you're going + i can pretty much cover every possible direction you're heading if you walk around since phasing is so fast.
---
1. Negated by cosmetics and doesn't really matter all that much if you know when she's phasing (unless you're camping a pallet) because of above mentioned points.
---
1. Nothing to say about this other than walking everywhere is a huge waste of time.
---
Why can‚Äòt you see red auras with a color weakness green?
---
No surge had a smaller rafious but bigger regression. They nerfed reggression to buff distance
---
No the 2 killers are enemys the teams would be 4 survivors and a killer both killers jobs would be to slow down the enemy teams survivors the first team to get the most survivors out wins
---
If u don‚Äôt use it u die. Still go watch a vid how to counter him and stop making a clown of ur self to the players who actually know how to play.
---
If their ping is 500+ they usually dc cause of connection issues...
---
Hex: devour hope
---
I just think that while yes there's alot of other good concepts for a new killer, Jason is still very iconic to the horror genre and it's kinda sad that we probably will never get him in the game.
---
Now...where do i sign to get a werewolf in the game?
---
I‚Äôm interested to hear how Spirit can counter Spine chill. 
---
You also have Quick and Quiet. You can run the Window ninja build to juke her out at a window without her even knowing. 
---
Lightweight can fuck with her. Fixated. Urban. Basically anything that makes you go faster than it seems can throw her off the scent. 
---
Every time I hear this ‚ÄúSpirit has no counterplay‚Äù. Bullshit I just hear ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt run her around a pallet or Window like she‚Äôs Wraith.‚Äù. It‚Äôs the same shit with people who bitched about Nurse.
---
Whenever that happens to me i tunnel him and let the other 3 escape...
---
Honestly you have to be pretty stupid to not be able to accurately guess when she‚Äôs phasing.
---
it wasn't Bircky
---
Unless u got iri head and u a skilled huntress
---
Overcharge is pretty trash. It's a very easy skillcheck to make, despite their dramatic claims.
---
I agree with most points and think that bumping is a problem but spine chill is a solid counter for every stealth killer in the game and you can hide faster because you see it before you hear the terror radius.
---
If you want a toxic jake saboteur. Use the perk saboteur, adrenaline, decisive strike and the perk on dwight for see other survivor in a range 48 meter. With a toolbox green with 180 charge and some add on for up speed sabotage (one add on green and yellow). You need to 99 every hook and when you see a survivor injured. Stop ur generator and find him before he get down. Now you wait for he get down and when the killer grab him destroye every hook one shot because you 99 all of them. But if there is the basement try to use the pallet on killer shak or body block him with ur friend. Its very toxic. And you can 99 abhook in 10 sec only. Its very toxic. And because of that the killer will focus on you and if he try to tunneling you because he hate you so much, You have decisive strike and if you need to escape quick when ur teamate do gen because the killer can't hook someone, you have adrenaline and you run to the door.
---
In Claudette perspective you might be far or somehere else and still managed to hit her. It would be fun if she posted a video of the same saying pig buff is op.
---
The problem isn't with the killer for me, it's the lack of good perks on them. Any killer can perform fine at rank 1 with enough skill. Except maybe clown, he's pretty bad.
---
Is this just another invisible boogeyman people are pretending others are complaining about to make rants about like they've done so many times? Plague is fine, though I wouldn't mind some sort of sidegrade(i.e. not a nerf or buff) to make her power a bit more interactive, since as of now it's all or nothing every game.
---
No but Paulie really makes it feel like we won't play him :(
---
That's not what I meant! :D I know about Kill your friends, but I mean like two killers, eight survivors or stuff like that. So my friend and I play killer and eight random survivors. It's not easy to make, but I'm excited about to see what DbD still brings in the game.
---
You know what just die in every match when you want unhook someone
---
I mean yeah, only situation where you'd need to make the 50/50 guess is pretty much if you camp a vault/pallet which isn't smart anyway.
---
And for the most part it doesn't even matter if you know she's phasing. She can still hear your breathing and footsteps and she's fast enough to cover pretty much all directions you can head out to and just bump into you.
---
I disagree...i play plague and huntress for killer, and i am currently rank 10...been finding red survivors only who seem to struggle at looping me

Give me Jason with his power being 'rage' and he gets a speed buff, can break pallets by just waking through them. No one's messes with Momma's Boy.
---
Idk if this breaks the rules for this thread but what do y‚Äôall think the GIF the devs just tweeted means?
---
Yeah the vomiting is weird for sure. I haven't played on anything but a PS4 so I can't relate it to anything else.
---
If it truly is 8%, then it‚Äôs a horrible perk. What a shame

True, if they were to introduce him to the game I feel like he'd be just be a trapless trapper with an invisibility cloak just like ding dong.
---
i got like 7 4k games as hillbilly at purple ranks before I decided to drop rank for achievement because I wasn't getting enough emblems.
---
No-one, but they are gradually getting nerfed. All BHVR need to do is increase exhaustion recovery time and increase the penalty for teaming up on gens.
---
Besides which, always playing the Spirit just in case you go up against the best Survivors is not a solution. That's boring and you have no idea if you're going against the best Survivors.
---
&gt; spine chill is a solid counter for every stealth killer in the game and you can hide faster
---
You don't need Spine Chill if you got any situational awareness. Seriously. Killers' breathing/footsteps are loud.
---
Why would you want to hide anyway? If you're a good looper you'll waste more of the killer's time than if you hide.
---
the offering, the hooks/gens, and the items wont show up on the bloodweb no more but can still be used if you already have some in your inventory. the serum stays until the end of the rift
---
I would love to see Legion up their. I think they are a decent killer. I find myself just migrating to the Nurse or Hag for a change of pace. But if legion got a buff, I'd totally rock it
---
Maybe it‚Äôs the next rift? Spirit and Adam?
---
My first thought was spirits dad is going to be a new killer but it could also mean a spirit rework? Too soon to tell lol
---
doesn't michael basically already do this lore-wise, since he's basically so evil that the entity can't control him, hence why the tombstone addons just let him outright stab the survivors to death if he becomes evil enough via stalking? not like it really matters though, i guess 2 killers could have that aspect to them. also, this isnt related, but isn't implied that michael only went to the entity's realm because laurie was taken there? im pretty sure that also implies he could leave, too
---
That's not a bad idea, but execution of that system would be a hard thing to do. There's a lot of perks that either synergize way too well, don't combine well or counteract each other. They would have to block certain perks from being used while using others. And god forbid they have to rework a perk, they already take a while to change perks with the system they have. having a system like that would probably take even longer to process a perk. A solid idea, but how they would execute something like that would be difficult for sure.
---
So are u saying there can only be strong survivor perks and items but no strong killers? Cuz thats totally fair.
---
And spirit wasn‚Äôt even that big of a deal before survivors knew that they can just go cry about strong killers in the internet and get them nerfed what isn‚Äôt even needed.
---
Plus two weeks after
---
Well I can't see it either lol.
---
ITS A TRAP

The problem with tbaggin is when its used to taunt the killer, if theres no one to taunt then theres no issue. This is like getting upset when people rub Styrofoam together because the noise, and then getting mad at someone doing so in a room where you cant hear it.
---
ah yea i forgot about the 2 weeks after thing thanks for adding that
---
I mean, he‚Äôs a beast. But does he have any ‚Äúspecial‚Äù that would make him distinctly different in the context of DBD? Spirit phases, trapper has traps, piggy has hats and crouch, etc.  What is in the Jason universe that would give him something special? Like, as a character he kills people and he‚Äôs good at it and he won‚Äôt die. But that doesn‚Äôt really apply much to DBD
---
Imagine the chases if he was in the game üòÇ. I‚Äôd never have to worry about being caught.
---
My bet is on Spirit rework, with it being a large subject of discussion in the community rn.
---
ÂõûÁîü = reincarnation.
---
Wish I could upvote this twice. I‚Äôve been saying forever that dbd needs useable colorblind modes. I will experiment with these filters when I‚Äôm home though thank you!!
---
&gt; During those 3.5 seconds, that survivor is for the most part untouchable and has full power over the chase
---
True but it hardly matters, a good Nurse can follow up in any tile the survivor gets into after the CD. That's why i said you need patience with her :P

she is the focus of the next Archive tome

trapper is just the generic version of our god jason
---
They just put it in the official announcement channel on the Discord server.
---
People complain because she has the ability to counter everything survivors usually do to blow out M1 killers. Trying to gen slam her without cleansing can easily lead to 4 slugs. Especially if you bring two apple add ons and Dying Light/Thanat/Pop/Corrupt
---
Sometimes, when you play Survivor, you can also hear the audio cue of the Whispers (Killer) perk during certain occasions.
---
The weirdest part however is that the Killers that I'm facing while this occurs don't even use Whispers lol.
---
Source? Because that‚Äôs unlikely.

I once spent a good 3 minutes looking for a totem on haddonfield at the start of the match.  Small Game kept triggering and I couldn't fucking find it.  Kept checking both levels of two houses nearby and in between.  Later found out I was vs the trapper and there was a trap on the ground between the houses in some grass that was triggering my Small Game.
---
Nooo... Victor Miller will always have the rights because he believed he was underpaid as a writer, so he will always hold the rights. If gun media ever settles the lawsuit then dbd can get the rights, and put Jason in dbd... until Victor Miller files another lawsuit against dbd and then the dev's wont make any money off Jason. So they will never put jason in
---
posted the day before the next tome opens it seems very likely
---
How are they a fucking idiot?
---
I'd love this
---
Anybody who DC's while everyone is alive is a fucking idiot.
---
She can counter spine chill by not looking at you while phasing, or by looking away from you to start phasing. Besides proposing a particular perk to counter a particular killer is kind of a weird argument as survivors don't get to see who the killer is pre-match. It's like telling a trapper to bring "fastening tools" as a counter to "slippery meat".
---
I'd rather have a BHVR original killer anyways.
---
Hello! This clip is me and my swf group, I was playing Steve and the owner of the clip was Feng Min. Sadly there is no mic audio, but hearing a man scream the way he did was just pure gold lol

&gt; So are u saying there can only be strong survivor perks and items but no strong killers?

I'm a Nurse main. Ofc not. I just think there should be viable counterplay on the highest level of play.

It's crap. No good killer is going to fall for any of those jukes. [Your turn: Scott Jund's response to the video which explains it pretty well why that stuff doesn't work vs good killers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lfi9mH05hE)
---
Feel free to re-use. Hopefully the more people actually see the problem first-hand, the sooner the resolution.
---
Haha ofc ofc. Just get spirit killed and make the game even easier for survivors than it is.
---
Still new to killer got my demogorgin to lvl 28 but hes getting repetitive is it ok to switch to a new killer? Or should i at least force my way to 35 to get his teachables?
---
You must be the guy who dc'd. If you are, I guarantee all the teammates you fucked over because you left were thinking you're a fucking idiot.
---
Hell I wasn't even in the game I think he's a fucking idiot.
---
Billy's chainsaw is also broken for hitboxes. Chinese killer would hit me and clearly its not touching me. This game is frustrating.
---
Rank 17 on PC last night was about 10-15 minutes for me
---
Think i worded it wrong. But there is no new tome coming is what i was meant to say. You think it will feature the spirit now while we haven't even finished Claudette and trapper yet.
---
Tome has 4 levels then next tome will release featuring new people.
---
Tomorrow we will be getting level 2 of Tome 1.
---
Thanataphobia is one of the better perks she can use. Dying Light takes 6 stacks to exceed Thanataphobia, so you're better off with Corrupted Intervention, Pop, Ruin to slow the game down versus DL.
---
Play with friends regardless of platform, and all the benefits that come from having a bigger pool of players like better matchmaking and shorter queue times.
---
Green rank killer and half the time I get in a lobby in under a minute.
---
You can not play him and simply level him up. However if your shred on point you get 800 BPs.
---
Im meaning michael/pig. You can spin your camera and get ghostface. Pig doesnt breathe loudly but michael does, however they both have no terror radius after the update.
---
He clip ends right where it gets to the funny part
---
üòÇ
---
I‚Äôve watched maybe 3-4 of the movies but it‚Äôs been years. 
---
I think comparing to spirit is a reach. In the movies, he is still a human and doesn‚Äôt have any supernatural ‚Äúteleporting‚Äù powers. So that wouldn‚Äôt apply in game. Michael is super strong in Halloween too.  But in DBD, that isn‚Äôt honored even though you‚Äôd think he can smash pallets with ease as a character.  With Michael, they captured the stalking nature of his character and turned that into an ability. And his sneakiness/jump scares in the movie (no terror radius). That makes sense. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying Jason couldn‚Äôt be a great killer. It‚Äôs just in the movies, he just goes around killing people and does have his own ‚Äúthing‚Äù that applies.  Although, game devs are infinitely more creative than me so they could probably find something.  I guess what I‚Äôm disagreeing with is that because he‚Äôs a badass that kills people and doesn‚Äôt die, that doesn‚Äôt make him OP in DBD because there are other killers like that already.
---
Hey there! I have about 2200 hours in this game and I'm gonna tell you that his teachables aren't even that great to justify leveling him up. You could go to level 30 and get surge since that's his best perk in my opinion. 
---
IF you should level someone up to 35 it would be Leatherface for Barbecue and Chili or Hag for Hex: Ruin but not the Demogorgon.
---
Hope that I could help you :)
---
Yup
---
You haven't read anything i've said now have you? :)
---
Prestige makes your pp big
---
BuT kIlLeRs DoN't HaVe ThIs ImPaIrMeNt So It IsN't CaNnOn
---
I think it‚Äôs hex ruin that makes the game pretty unplayable for me. The red in the quick time event is very difficult to see. Hopefully this will help!
---
I'm just saying. If three are going to leave, the toxic one will die.
---
The power of your obsession stepping in a trap on death hook while at full stacks feels even better
---
Yeah not just me and you, also my premades from time to time.
---
But I can definetly confirm that this doesnt have anything to do with Whispers being used by the current or not.
---
&gt; Pig doesnt breathe loudly
---
I never have trouble hearing her ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Tritanopia looking fresh doe
---
That is actually  my build pop, corrupt, ruin, and thanatophobia
---
Otz has almost sold me on using padded jaws just for more stacks
---
My favourite is part 5
---
Huntress lullaby full stacks to get rid of skill check warning might make it harder
---
A normal ruin great skill check with the above effects is far smaller
---
This is just fantastic, your others ones look so good too!! I hope you'll do all of the killers in the future? &lt;3
---
you need to talk about what instances you might use these in, otherwise i‚Äôve thought they should add jumping but then i thought ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a real need, would make things more complicated than they already are for some
---
Same. Like even at red ranks my teammates would cleanse even if they have like 1% sickness, their only goal is to find a pool asap.
---
Ok I will do that now.
---
Jesus Christ you're right, it was late game though so his ruin was spent at least..
---
It wont ever be
---
How so?
---
Put me in the shrinewatch screenshot
---
You are both satan
---
What if he‚Äôs the survivor though? Entity did catch rin because of her desire for revenge, maybe now is the time where entity gives her what she wants for her compliance.
---
If I‚Äôm on death hook and trying to de rank, I‚Äôll quit when the killer gets me to my last hook. 
---
You‚Äôre a fucking idiot with a shitty imagination because you can‚Äôt think of a reason to quit out.
---
I wanted it without the white boxes over ghostmane

Remake Jason suck tho
---
Man, I really hope they do something about this for y'all. I get really fired up about video game accessibility, and color blind filters are some of the more simple accommodations you can make.
---
Devs, just let us know you're working on it at least.
---
Just generally, you know.. New, non-stale ways to play.
---
Need to pip? Be a dick!

Rank is for nerds? Rescue your friend!

ü§£üëç
---
Wasn‚Äôt me. And idk if you have a lighter meaning for a fucking idiot or something but seems like you‚Äôre way too worked up for one random dc
---
That's precisely why I don't play her. I could have old omega blink, a mori and  noed on her and still only manage to kill 1 person. at that point it's just not fun to play. The only time I play her is for a daily and that's it.
---
Is IDV on any consoles?
---
For real though, I get that Game Pass is kinda of a continuous payment deal and over time it costs more, but like, I can't spend $100 (in my money) for a new game or shit like that, so paying $20 a month for quite a few games, including DBD is a pretty fresh deal, IMO.
---
This is goddam amazing
---
This is why I run Spine Chill on every build
---
I‚Äôm in rank 8 and killer queues can be as fast as survivor queues some days. There‚Äôs been a few times where it‚Äôs been faster than the survivor queues as well. Of course every now and then it takes a bit but definitely not as long as before.
---
Not worked up. I wasn't even planning on elaborating until you replied. You asked how they're a fucking idiot. I told you
---
And it's a fact you can beat a 4man SWF with the best toolboxes and perks as a no perk Wraith, they just have to be fucking terrible lmao.
---
I'll tell you what I tell everyone: if you're confident you can juke a Spirit, DM ScottJund, ask to play a KYF versus his Spirit and do your best to prove 1k+ people wrong. But you won't, because you're all talk.
---
I doubt a solo survivor release unless it was a horror icon like Sidney Prescott/Dr. Loomis/Nancy Thompson/etc.
---
Me 2 tbh
---
Truth: you have no right to CV omplain about iridescent if they only have one axe
---
The average person's eyes are tuned for green, so when you buff green it makes things a whole lot easier. 
---
That's part of the concern about giving people unfettered access to filters - instead of just making life easier for colour blind people, you could inadvertently make even the faintest scratch marks impossible for the average person to miss.
---
KUHNT
---
I‚Äôve been leveling up new killers lately to try and it‚Äôs annoying because I get destroyed by a bunch of toxic survivors. ‚ÄúGG EZ‚Äù congrats you beat my level 15 Ghostface
---
As a Friday the 13th fan who has seen every movie a ton of times, it's pretty upsetting that it seems so few people know what Jason is actually like. People think he's exactly like the game portrays him, which he is not. They technically could get Jason without the lawsuits, but I believe it has to be the remake Jason
---
I don't see a nerf here. If anything, she got buffed from where i'm sitting - i have never been a Nurse main, i never got good with her before. I couldn't stand to play her because she was so damn boring, but her new addons changed that for me; the scream addon and the healing auras are amazing since they eliminate the need for one, maybe two perks. I'm a Myers/Pig/GF player; sneaking around and tracking by sound and environmental cues, so the scream especially is amazing; i can now blink slightly off, hear the scream, swing and hit a survivor behind or to the side of me that i otherwise would have missed.
---
So yeah, it's a nerf for Nurse mains, which sucks. Everyone else? She got easier to play.
---
Spirit Rework or they gonna give her her own chase music?
---
Wasn't there some buzz about that a while ago? Idm
---
If a killer tunneled or campped they would probably end up losing due to 3 other people doing gens and playing well while the other killer could get at least 2 kills and win the game and i did mean for it to be a race against the other team
---
what do you think his power would have been if jason was in the game?
---
Nice for people who do it on purpose. But not for those with bad internet.
---
Huntress would be going around sniping with Iri Head, Legion would be teaming up even though it's a free-for-all, Myers would be using wall hacks, Spirit would be hated in every post-game chat, Wraith would be pissed because everyone's better than him and Demogorgon would kill one person then fuck off to eat them in the Upside-Down.
---
I used to like billy but then i thought i should move up the teir list and play trapper (joking)
---
That means we‚Äôd have to remove either Adrenaline,Balanced Landing,borrowed time and decisive strike from our builds.
---
Normal camping killer. This happens at least every 3rd game. Just continue
---
Licensing problems? Something goin on with Nightmare now like what F13 went through?
---
The game has also become very pay to have fun. Hey discontinued thorns, have only payed dlc, no way to earn auric cells outside of payment, and really just stopped being original. I live having the demogorgon and Steve, but Jesus the game is starting to become unoriginal
---
Jesus if this happens she‚Äôs gonna be completely gutted what‚Äôs the point of concealing grunts of pain when she‚Äôs seen when invisible
---
If you use it with object of obsession and ur teamate died. You can see 24h the killer so you can hide ez before he see you. So if u open an exit gate you can see his movement and predict his next movement but still useless because it cannot counter bbq correctly.
---
Because nobody wants to be destroyed playing as Killer, who should be the power role but clearly isn‚Äôt. If you try to play a low tier killer at red ranks you‚Äôll just get gen rushed almost every game by optimal teams. Even solo teams will completely shit on you. You can‚Äôt really ‚Äúturn‚Äù around games as Leatherface or Doctor in high ranks if the survivors make 0 mistakes.
---
Until they fix it, you have no choice but to accept it. It‚Äôs in the game and people are allowed to use it.
---
I don‚Äôt count disconnecting as an option since that‚Äôs more misc. than anything. Do it if it please you or whatever.
---
I mean like....yeah.
---
Boomer!? Where!?
---
Lol, I was like... I can see the hook just fine and I'm colorblind! Then saw the others and was like oh shit... there are generators!
---
Imagine little kid deformed Jason in the game
---
Totally fair. That killer is in the right. That map is broken and everyone knows it lol
---
most red ranks shouldn't be in red ranks. everyone makes mistakes
---
The one I was against was going for adept huntress, so she used the iri and the belt
---
Bloodpoints are shared across all killers, so if you're not feeling Demo anymore then there's no problem switching to another killer for farming. Personally I rotate between 3-4 killers, just to keep things fresh and fun, and then I use the Bloodpoints to pick up perks from the ones I don't play.
---
In terms of perks, Surge is probably their best - and they get that at L30. I wouldn't worry about the other two.
---
My professional opinion?
---
\*turns into phoonix wrong and slams deck\*
---
Ze Heavy was KILLED!
---
Just to point out, Jason does gain teleportation in part 8. Hes phases around a lot in that movie. Also in part 8 he causes the main girl to hallucinate baby him drowning throughout the movie so maybe this could be an ability of sorts?
---
Jason Goes to Hell hes able to possess peeps, though granted, this would be broken in DBD.
---
Also, there could always be Jason X that can be tapped into. Nanomachines and what not.
---
So the entity has reason to dislike it or outright possibly fear it?
---
For the 9999th time it's just "The Doctor" not "Doctor Who" !
---
Those are just all nerfs not a rework in anyway.  Since they tweeted it it‚Äôll be an overhaul of her power and something new will be made most likely.  Or the no-collision and a few others things will be implemented as well as a few additions to her power.  They don‚Äôt want to Gut her.... but being her down to around Billy and Huntress tier
---
Which Jason traits do the trapper have? They both have a mask and a big knife?
---
Jason is an unstoppable fucker that will walk his way through the entire map giving 0 fucks.
---
I'm in red ranks and it's always instant
---
Personally, i love getting haddonfield as a killer. It's small and easy to patrol.
---
That being said salty players will always find something to be salty about. Just ignore it and move on.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt Jason trap people and use different weapons? The tunnels allow him to ‚Äòteleport‚Äô and bear traps imbolise his targets. What do you think Jason would do instead of this?
---
The whole "gens need to take longer" will do 2 things:
---
A) Make it harder for solo survivors that dont play with SWF squads.
---
B) Make 3 gen strat even stronger.
---
What it WON'T ensure is making killers stop using it, increased gen time + ruin? Yes please.
---
If the gen timer does get increased WITHOUT reducing ruin (and probably reducing also the other perks that slow down gens) effectiveness all you will do is make the game easier for the killers who will STILL use ruin because there is few things more valuable for a killer than increased time on the match.
---
Per the news post, the Withering Blight event ends November 13th. 
---
The Putrid Serum can be earned in the current Rift until it ends in about 2 months time, and then you have 2 weeks to spend the Putrid Serum before it's gone for good.
---
BITES ZA DUSTO!
---
I think the doctor and legion changes are scheduled to arrive first. 
---
Also this seems a little...mysterious for just a balance patch. I'd guess it's a teaser for the next chapter.
---
Can you show me the tweet please, I cant find anything official about a spirit rework?
---
When you sabo 5 hooks while the killer is carrying someone
---
Last two is good, ever other is just kill her
---
To give a bit of balance to generator speeds, otherwise 3 survivors finishing a gen in 26 seconds would be pretty crazy.
---
We definitely need a decapitation Mori
---
Jason is more of a quick swipe type of guy. This Jason ties people in a sleeping bag and roasts them alive. The tunnels are a neat explanation for teleporting, but Jason does not have the patience or intelligence for this. And Jason only used bear traps once in the originals. And switching weapons is not a Jason exclusive thing.
---
Can a broken key open the end game vault?
---
That's so weird and unnecessary. It sounds like they have a lot of resentment and bitterness inside from not being able to win on an easy map
---
Just gotta feel sorry for them &amp; move on to the next on
---
Question
---
When I unlock spirit‚Äôs hex that exposes whoever cleansed it for trapper, should I run it without any other hex perks, go straight to it and trap it to signal to any survivors nearby ‚Äúhe‚Äôs defending this totem, we should get rid of it when he‚Äôs across map‚Äù, and expect an easy exposed survivor?
---
RAW!
---
Very cool idea! It‚Äôs a shame many killers don‚Äôt use their power in their mori.
---
Of course not, it‚Äôs not what I meant. But saying sweaty or try hard builds in killers are the fault of survivors or viceversa is not accurate, some people just like causing grief
---
Thanks for giving our game the recognition we strongly believe it deserves.
---
\- Sincerely, a filthy Demo main
---
self-promotion isn‚Äôt allowed.
---
Survivors can cleanse totems, thus making the perk worthless. Perks and tools can be used to destroy noed before 3 gens are even done. Also, I said moris NEED to require 2 hooks to help balance them you fucking retard.
---
Idk how to think about this. On one hand you say she is guilty but she did not run and waved you over. It could be she was letting you hook her. Was the hatch right under her?
---
Hmmm yes. Lockr.
---
D looks sick as fuck
---
I was going to do a doc daily, and all 4 swf joins in with flashlights. All four are either p3 meg or claudettes. I debate dodging, but then just equip franklin's. I find them all circle jerking together, and when I hit one and start nodding over their flashlight, they all just stop and stare at me then all dc.
---
China wouldn‚Äôt like that and we all know most companies are puppets to China
---
https://youtu.be/nqmhg_XXjwM
---
This is lovely. What a way to nail the characters of Nurse and Nea and give them such a good spotlight
---
After getting all the gens done, Myers takes his leave..
---
It's..beautiful :')

Just assumed causeThey tweeted out a gif of spirits Katanas from the release video, as well as the famous Pretty good job dev subtweeted it
---
Only if you have it paired with dying light
---
Naw this was a few months ago. Like maybe 2
---
What's funny is that I believe the DBD devs would give more justice to making Jason a **serious** threat to players, as opposed to the goofy mechanics and play style in his own game. 
---
But I'm no fortune teller and that's just a hunch. So if he ever got added, anything could happen.
---
Thats why ‚Äúrework‚Äù is in quotes.
---
Because thats probably what will happen since a vocal portion of survivors just complain about her constantly.
---
A broken key cannot open the hatch. All it can be used for it putting the key addons on it, like the aura reading ones.
---
I did not hook her! I did not! Oh hi Dwight.
---
Hey I was gonna comment this... take an upvote.
---
I cri and they axe why :,( ...But fr if its anything like this im legitimately never playing killer again and just gonna be a survivor main.
---
Cat.
---
Please don't fucking gut her, please don't fucking gut her, please don't fucking gut her, please don't fucking gut her...
---
Game balance purposes - otherwise survivors would be knocking them out in 20 seconds or less.
---
What... is it exactly? It looks quite odd.
---
I saw the hatch where she was before I hook the 3rd person and I had a very good feeling she had decisive strike, I was right when I saw her perks
---
[Do not underestimate the spoon!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VDvgL58h_Y)
---
Maybe with the nerf they should have let her vary her charge distance. It would have brought her more in line with mindgame killers
---
F13 is still going through it. But no thankfully it's nowhere close to it. Every 35 years the original creators can ask for their creations back and it's happening with Nightmare and Texas Chainsaw. It's going pretty smooth tho
---
Brutal strength and unnerving presence sounds just like that. Plus, he has a high walking speed. 
---
I would love to hear the chchchhahaha but it seems like all Jason would bring is asmr
---
Yes I agree. Im sick of this too. If they want to tease chapter 14 do it right
---
I like that idea
---
I agree 100%. Hell, I‚Äôd say Halloween is my favourite movie of all time, and I can‚Äôt wait for the Boogeyman to get the brilliant treatment you‚Äôve been giving the other characters.
---
That sounds cool, give his weapons different uses like the saw is slower but can 1 hit down the survivor, the machete is the basic m1 killer, using fists could break the survivor and chains have a long range but they take more time to recover.
---
If you couldn‚Äôt stop one survivor from unhooking two stage 2 survivors in the basement that‚Äôs entirely on you
---
Sauce?
---
Holy shit I thought at first this wasnt realistic because I could see the standard image just fine while I am a strong deutan. But I didn't even realize there were gens in the picture until you mentioned it! This game definitely needs this. When carrying survivors I basically have the boil over perk effect constantly. I rarely get any basement hooks as I think the basement is on the  other spawn since I can't see the hooks through the floor
---
You don't need to know who has it?? Make yourself play like everyone has Spine Chill and it makes no difference. People w/o Spine Chill just don't have it, and people who do are effectively countered. But I like how you bring up you can't know someone is running it. Like you can't know the Killer with be Spirit? Like you can't know what Spirit is doing?
---
I literally replied to everything you said. If by that you meant "you aren't agreeing with me", then yes, you're right. I don't agree with you, and I told you why.
---
Lullaby is hardest to master even on normal skill checks
---
Nothing you‚Äôre saying changes the fact that she offers counterplay with most of her kit. The BS things about her are the prayer beads, how loud injured survivors are and collision in spirit form
---
She‚Äôs jukable. Those 1k+ people were busy complaining about nurse until she got a nerf, and won‚Äôt stop with just nurse and spirit. She‚Äôs powerful but that makes the game fun
---
And no I‚Äôm not going to challenge somebody clearly far better at the game than me. That doesn‚Äôt prove anything about the killer‚Äôs powerlevel. I can point to the way her kit is designed, facts instead of opinion. You‚Äôve yet to say anything that isn‚Äôt just your opinion
---
I mean no disrespect to you, and you‚Äôre welcome to feel the way you do, so I‚Äôm not going to argue the topic further. The fact that there is *some* symmetrical aspect to her power, even if it‚Äôs tilted in her favour, mean that there‚Äôs counterplay. Skill level between both players is what determines how much counterplay there is
---
Not really, Nurse and Billy have been dominating high ranks for years without changes. And Nurse still does now after the changes too, she is still a brokenly strong character. Billy actually got buffed, with chainsaw reg on pallets. This idea that BHVR "destroys" killers left and right is laughable reddit killer drama. Maybe, just maybe, 3+ blinks and ranged blinks were actually grossly overpowered and it is ridiculous that they were in the game for years to begin with, and maybe Spirit is actually a problematic design that was overbuffed when she came out of PTB. I mean, stuff like in-Phase collision is just a blatant flaw nobody in their right mind would argue has a place in the game.
---
Preaching to the choir. Do you know how impossible it is for me to see scratch marks or blood trails? Its literally the biggest reason why i dont really play a whole lot of killer.
---
Each with their own moris too. Dont forget that part
---
I would rather have edgy teenagers (legion) than animatronics possessed by dead kids, one of the reasons being those kids are forced to do the entities bidding.
---
**i don‚Äôt want dead kids doing an unstoppable unknown creature‚Äôs dirty work in metal suits of fur. That‚Äôs what the legion, who are teenagers who commit crimes and don‚Äôt die in DbD, are for.**
---
As a protan killer I can confirm that playing the game is a living hell. Scratch marks, gens, and other auras a practically invisible. However if you have an NVIDIA GPU an you get the beta driver software, there is NVIDIA freestyle which allows you to add a colorblind filter over the game, and you can set it's intensity as well. I've been using it ever since.
---
Console is pretty good actually, and is much easier than most pc players think
---
They are faster depending on rank lower ranks survivor queues are quicker but mid to high ranks killer is instant survivor you wait for a bit
---
It's more that SWF doesn't have to recheck the same ground.
---
And lack of coordination is the killer against all Killers. I've been playing no addons Wraith to get rid of my Pustula petals and the amount of games where I've 4ked as a "bottom tier" Killer because Survivors didn't find my Ruin and then 3-genned themselves is astounding.
---
Oh fuck that would be too good to be true
---
Clown is Good for when you hook the last survivor, and then you can throw bottles at them
---
Asking the important question
---
Great. Another please nerf killer. You know she was the same when legion was out. Not a peep. Run fucking iron will or spine chill. I do. I'm don't fear Spirt. What one of the 4 meta perks can't you drop? IW works or spin chill works on every killer. I get the beads part. However I don't get the argument that she can't be counted. I play against her all the time. I dropped BL for IW and never looked back.  She is fine. The counter play is not being adjusted. 
---
*OMG .1 perk for 1 killer. Yeah and people run adrenaline to stop a NoED that probably not being use. 
---
*OMG. Don't tell me how to play. I'm telling you a easy solution. 
---
*OMG. She is impossible to loop. I do it all the time. 
---
*OMG she is so OP. Is the mindset of a person who wants a reason to DC. 
---
*OMG. Only toxic killers use her. Yup. Like squads running OoO. 
---
I'm just saying that understand to a point but she is not the original Legion. She is fine. We need strong killers. In the right hands she is deadly. Good. In the right hands 80% of killers are hard as hell to win against survivors who know what they are doing. I don't get it. Why are we not allowed to have a few good challenges.
---
A mori is an offering a killer can use which allows them to kill the survivor after they‚Äôve been hooked once. There‚Äôs 3 variations, where the killer can either kill all 4, kill only 1 at any time, or only kill 1 if they‚Äôre the last survivor alive.
---
The spirit nerf isn‚Äôt even needed. Spirit is ok rn but too many people just don‚Äôt know how to play against him correctly
---
How about if it's the survivors fault? If they preferred gens instead of saving?
---
Almost like at the start of each match they give you 4 maps to vote on? I honestly feel like they should hide the number of votes too just so it keeps the mystery of the map in it. It‚Äôs a pretty good idea voting on maps
---
The challenge says By Any Means, so just get a 4K.
---
That and just finding tiny red totems is a pain.
---
Best perk tbh
---
People are saying the new killer will be the Nun, I think this "teaser" has to do with upcoming Spirit balance tweaks.
---
ahhh thank you so much! i don‚Äôt play killer (as of yet) so i had no idea
---
You can kill all 4 by any means, not just with moris
---
Hazbin hotel, don‚Äôt let this guys opinion get to you. It‚Äôs riddled with sex jokes and adult humor, and many people see that as a bad thing, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me. The creator has been accused of some untrue stuff such as being racist sexist and homophobic. Th e show itself is very impressive musically and artistically, being a independently funded project. The animation is beautiful and you should support it if you feel like it
---
I would so collect all these comics if you made them!
---
Also overwhelming presence doesn't make the skill check hard. Unnerving Presence on Doc where a Decisive Strike skill check is a sliver is probably the smallest skill check ive ever seen. If you running unnerving presence you prpbably dont have to worry about Decisive strike
---
Against proper red swf nothing can win except spirit and nurse, the others can capitalize on errors but can't impose their power tbh
---
Cheers, you drunken wretch. 
---
\-Sincerely, a filthy Spy main
---
Unfortunately I couldn't find a good picture of scratch marks with red gens and either a yellow gen or a hook.
---
I'll look into making a comparison image for the scratch marks - it's just that it the effect seemed more dramatic in the image I chose.
---
Yeah Spirit is cool but i wanna play GhostFace from time to time (I dont say GF is low tier, i just absolutely suck with him)
---
Did they even decide to add that nurse rework?
---
An instant kill a killer can perform on a survivor. When the conditions for a mori are met (an offering that requires at least one hook, Hex: Devour Hope reaching 5 tokens, Rancor‚Äôs obsession being alive once the last generator is completed, Micheal Myers‚Äô Tombstone addons while he is in Evil Within T3) the killer can Approach the survivor and press M1 with a prompt stating ‚ÄúKill‚Äù
---
Actually the fact that it‚Äôs slower than before matters a LOT. Red rank games can easily be decided in mere seconds. If you as a killer do not acquire pressure via early hooks, you Better hope you ran NOED and they didn‚Äôt cleanse totems bc ur gonna have a hard time if they know gen priority
---
I didnt say she doesnt have a problem. I said the counters for her brcause someone said there were absolutely none.
---
I meant that as more of a joke, but it probably isn't a terrible option for a colorblind person even for general quality of life, even outside of the game.
---
Jason can move freely through the lake.  A coding nightmare for BHVR but i think it would be so worth
---
What the actual fuck am I looking at right now?
---
Correct, the only killer who can make you hear the Entity's voice is Doctor, when you're in tier 3 madness
---
that makes a lot more sense, thank you. i was seeing a lot of stuff about ghostface‚Äôs and wondering what it meant and how it worked
---
Dont you guys have civ 5?
---
I just say gg to every killer because when I have a bad match as killer and someone messages me gg I think I did pretty good
---
Why don‚Äôt you just relearn colors
---
If you ask me, demogorgon makes sense. It‚Äôs otherworldly and comes from a world consuming the other world the stranger things cast lives in, and might not be the only one of its kind (I don‚Äôt watch stranger things so my apologies if anything is wrong, reminder that in FNAF, the kids got their happy ending already. They got released and such. At most your best option would be Trapper‚Äôs new golden pet robo-rabbit himself). I don‚Äôt know shut about steve and Nancy btw to add context. It‚Äôs also shown the entity can take you before you breathe your last (Bill, his arrival in The Fog is canon to DbD, but not L4D). I don‚Äôt see the dead kids, who have passed peacefully after all this time, being sent to such a hellscape. They suffered enough.

---
There are maps that clearly favor one side or the other, so in a 4 VS. 1 voting system, Survivors will always pick the maps in their favor and win that vote.
---
That's why limited offerings for maps are a thing.
---
But, perhaps a stack of maps randomly accumulated in a column A, B, C sort of thing could work, where players pick a stack and whichever one gets the most votes then randomizes a map from that stack.
---
All the new players attempt the escape, when I first started I would attempt the escape and got mad when I would die on my second hook
---
If you as a killer are unable to defend a basement double unhook from a single survivor (where you have a massive advantage and you know someone is waiting for the save) you totally misplayed and blew your lead. 
---
&gt;preferred gens instead of saving
---
You mean doing the main objective? How does that relate to misplaying and failing to prevent an unhook
---
I‚Äôm guessing everyone in this room is a demon of sorts?
---
Impossibly Rare
---
Yes, the setting is hell
---
Hey there brother
---
Oh goodness
---
Had a farming spirit with rancor let us complete all the gens so she could mori me and i bunny tek her when the doors got powered
---
This guy was a survivor
---
I had someone message me after chat saying they committed suicide because of the streamers. He was a rank 11 and was the first to die. I play on PS4 so he had to direct message me.
---
I like using STBFL, when you get those tasty 8 stacks and you see killer cleaning weapon with super speed
---
Not in red and purple ranks
---
25 I think
---
Yeah, the only problems see is withSWF. they will always pick maps that favor survivor. So indoor maps will
---
Never be played. But I think something needs to be implemented. maybe even eliminate some maps from
---
Rotation, most maps are pretty much the same thing.
---
A straight up nerf would suck, a rework is needed
---
Does D even need a filter? The hooks and gens stand out pretty clearly, unless you're trying just to get it close to normal color.
---
Yup! Like Mario Kart 8 online; Everyone chooses what map they want then it randomly selects a map. I always think it‚Äôs a waste of an offering.
---
Why is one killer hiding from the other? Why are there even two killers in this match?!
---
I like Ghostface (Was always a fan of the Scream franchise) I mess around with Hag/Nurse/Legion here and there. I'll probably start playing Legion more, I like the Hag and Nurse as Change of pace.
---
I've had the game about 2 months. Logged maybe 100 hours now?
---
Sudden pallet stuns is the reason why this game has horror tag
---
I guess taking concept from his own game? (Even if there's a lawsuit and etc.)
---
Anywho, I was thinking his rage slowly builds up and it's basically gonna be used like an endgame phase. Or couple of phase where he slowly gains rage.
---
Thinking like this, if he gets hurt like stunned or stabbed or the more progress Survivors make, the more you're in a chase you gain rage the way he would progress rage. It has to pass maybe 5-10 seconds maybe to start gaining one?
---
Multiple examples would be similar to Myers: First Rage will grant you 5-10% action speed. Then if on second Rage you will be swapped with 5-10% speed. He can be a Killer with 4.6% max speed as he is slow in the game otherwise. And last rage will be tantrum? He can break doors so why not something related to bash through pallets? In addition you can add multiple spices on each rage he gains but it's a little bit difficult for me to come up with random ideas for him at least for Dead by Daylight aspect-wise.
---
Overall if we ever see Jason in Dead by Daylight he has to start well structured. If his concept will go with Rage power that is. And I guess the special gen will be around his shack? Where her mother's head is and the sweater. Can also add a chest next inside.
---
Generally speaking, you should ignore a player (or two) anyway for maximizing 4k potential assuming all things equal.  You're in a much better place by getting 2, maybe 3, survivors to dead on hook than having 4 survivors 1 hooked.
---
Every killer has their own unique animation. Some....less interesting that others. Ghostface‚Äôs I‚Äôd rate top five best to watch cause he takes a little selfie with the survivor while they cough up blood.
---
Disconnecting because you were the first person to go down isn't the games fault. It's salty players that can't stand losing
---
Try the tru3ta1ent build it's a lot of fun! It's sloppy, nurses, thanat, and ruin/corrupt depending on the rank you play at. If you don't understand any of what I just said then lemme know and I can clarify
---
You dont have to play the Hag to level her up for Ruin. 
---
That said, just run Corrupt Intervention instead
---
I started about a week before the last reset
---
i‚Äôm actually watching a compilation of them all right now! legion‚Äôs seems pretty theatrical as well, but i do really like ghostface‚Äôs. thanks so much for explaining to me :0
---
&gt; the fact that it‚Äôs slower than before matters a LOT
---
It's still Nurse. After the few second cooldown i'll have a survivor downed in 2-4 blinks. Few seconds won't make a difference. At least not in my games.
---
I never mentioned you.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what they want. You‚Äôre gonna get an entity displeased
---
Then how come it says ‚Äútome 2‚Äù next to the second level of challenges? Or tome 3 next to the third level and tome 4 next to the 4th level? The rift is the battlepass that ends in like 60 days, the tomes are the challenge pages with the next one coming out in 2 days
---
I know, but there are killer that do the same
---
Not me in the video. I died lol but I saw this player floating around beforehand ahahhaa
---
It is a waste of an offering. it only takes 1 survivor offering out of 4 to possibly mess up your only offering.
---
Thats 10% of survivors wrest of them want spirit nerfed.
---
I have no clue
---
Steve- Don;t mind me, gotta get to my kids....
---
Is DBD available in China? I would think the whole game would be blacklisted due to all the death imagery
---
I've been experimenting with a few different builds but I put Urban on almost everything because I prefer stealth. I have a few clips of me ducking the killer with it too
---
oh goodness
---
Really ?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt do that if I were you, different types of games compared to DbD.
---
Also as a trapper main I can confirm some stuff needs to be adjusted first. 10 minute ban sounds good per dc, or it can ramp up to a full hour if they consistently disconnect within an hour each of every ban. As for spirit I never found her unfair but I can try to help. Make her glow a little when phasing or make her do ghostly moans as she walks in the spirit realm, with either a new or old addon for her specifically that can negate the moans, not entirely, but rather enough to make it so you need to be considerably closer to her to hear it than usual. If she already has that, make leaves float around her in the spirit realm that signify her location, and like with moans, add a new addon or redo an old one to make it less noticeable.
---
As a killer main.
---
Respect for every survivor who takes the hatch and leaves their buddies. 
---
1 for 3?
---
I thank you.
---
Wow, that's quality content
---
Start giving people 30 minute bans when they do this shit
---
So it's weabooism, then.
---
*unloads a mountain of stickies*
---
I was out of the loop for a while, and some YT videos got me confused. How does the current version of Dying Light work?
---
I think it was supposed to end yesterday.
---
Because a significant portion of the community is excited for a spirit rework. I‚Äôm a killer main and I‚Äôm excited for it, because she needs some changes. Key word is ‚Äúrework‚Äù, it‚Äôs a change not a nerf. A nerf is just downsides to make her weak, a rework will just change her to still be strong while being fun to play against
---
Nurse is my favorite. Just the intimacy of how close you get to the survivors face and the gentle face touch before the hell scream makes it so satisfying to watch.
---
You're missing the point. I'm saying if they were all going to escape ANYWAY and I was going to get entity displeased ANYWAY, then the toxic one WILL die.
---
Case in point, Michael using a pipe to mori people.
---
And the smiley boy is the big bad boss of the hotel or a miscellaneous main character, with the most normal of the white characters behind them being the main character of main characters (the girl in the middle of the group behind smiley boy)?
---
Pretty sure the game is banned in China
---
You sure you haven‚Äôt seen the show?
---
I haven‚Äôt been playing for that long so I haven‚Äôt maxed any of my killers. When I do play though it‚Äôs all about BP so I tend to stack perks that get bonus BP like BBQ , Distressing, Thrill of the Hunt, etc. What I don‚Äôt like is waiting 20 minutes to find a match just to have survivors DC when downed for the first time. My killer goal is usually to hook everyone twice, max out chase BP and then let them go. I prefer to play survivor as it‚Äôs more appealing to me but survivors make really shit BP compared to killer.
---
Haddonfield and easy map dont go together for killers
---
You‚Äôre missing the point. If you don‚Äôt get baited, they‚Äôre less likely to let the other 3 out
---
And 3 more swfs appearing from thin air with flashlights when you pick one up
---
Fall for me, instead.
---
You feel proud for belittling people on forms?
---
The entity said "aight you got this imma head out" and vanished
---
Omg guy. You don't get it.
---
rip spirit mains
---
And maybe survivors could get new emotes
---
If you can see her when she is phasing what's the point of phasing? I hope the rework is nothing like this.
---
Right so with any change/rework that a dev does you aren‚Äôt always going to get a happy result, there are so many other options though they can take, Change the spawns of totems, make them longer to break as I agree this would just entice killers to use Ruin more.
---
There are so many ways they could try and balance the game for both sides, like make survivors when in the injured repair at a slower rate compared to a healthy state, Makes sense ?
---
It has great synergy with Surveillance as well, triggering the effect on all generators in range
---
I really like these :)
---
thx
---
While it‚Äôs obvious there would be foot high water everywhere, the hatch would be tall enough as it is to be visible.
---
Also, we have hatches on a damn muddy swamp, I think a submarine hatch would be more realistic than that.
---
I never had problems with my vizio. As far as I know they are a good company.
---
Yeah it sucks, but im saying that if youre not the one being given the security protocol, play around it and try to punish the killer for doing so instead of being sad about it. And if youre the one getting camped, take it like a champ and stay for the full duration. A good team can even get you out of it and all 4 escapes. Me im willing to trade places with anyone being camped to make good use of hook timers
---
That‚Äôs a good idea
---
Maybe a rework of the map since this is from the spirit trailer.
---
It's a 1 vs 4 its stands to reason the killer would have an easier time then survivors.
---
Ok I was just saying though
---
Why are you immediately expecting a nerf which will make her low tier? Only because they will give her counter play? And btw spirit isnt the only viable killer. Just dont be lazy and take your time to master other killers.
---
Finally got my husband to do this with me! He started off only liking watching the game and now we have 2 PS4s and play together!
---
Yeah I'm only partially colorblind and it blew my mind when I was watching a streamer who was able to track an injured guy by his blood trail.
---
I can never, ever see blood on the dirt. It only helps me on indoor maps.
---
I started about 2 weeks before the last reset. I just checked I currently have 152 hours 6 minutes
---
I'm talking general perks. I don't have any killer to teachables just yet.
---
Absolutely Beautiful üò≠
---
Thanks for confronting me with my color blindness again... :(
---
I will play, unless im trying to do something,. Ill have two die and two live. WHo they are makes no difference, I'll just farm points by placing all of them on hooks twice. Unless you start the flashlight, come here, teabag, taunting me. then I'll tunnel you. Erks the Hell out of me!
---
Pretend to be shit at the game... little do they know you have Insidious, Iri heads &amp; Belt
---
There‚Äôs a difference between strong and unfun. People aren‚Äôt asking for a rework because she‚Äôs too strong, they‚Äôre asking because it‚Äôs not fun. It‚Äôs not fun to have the only deciding factor of whether you win or not be how fast your teammates do gens. The way spirit works is that in a chase she wins, unless she‚Äôs garbage at the game. Very few people enjoy stealth gameplay in this game because it‚Äôs pretty boring so that makes the only consistent counter to spirit kill the game. And iron will is not a counter, spirits often run stridor because it nullifies iron will. And spine chill? Sure, you‚Äôre not gonna get gen grabbed by a prayer beads spirit, and that‚Äôs about it. Explain to me how spine chill is useful even slightly in a chase
---
I also only own the starting killers and huntress.
---
I‚Äôd be voting for Swamp or Auto wreckers every damn time as a survivor lol
---
Yeah... I just hope devs won't screw up next Killer or at least if Jason will be in. Not to mention he IS a highly requested Killer along Friday the 13th fans demanding some justice for him. But eh?
---
I haven't been losing money when this happens here lately, but I used to. So maybe it's 50/50 now
---
Nah. I‚Äôm just assuming based off thing I‚Äôve seen before, like jimmy two shoes where the evil bastard who is essentially mini satan is also a business boss of a huge corporation and likes torturing everyone, while jimmy is so optimistic it pisses him off but they still have to struggle to deal with eachother‚Äôs shit (mini-satan planting his larger-than-him son in the ground with only his head above to ‚Äúground him‚Äù, jimmy trying to find ways to have fun all the time or stay nice, etc. I don‚Äôt see the middle gal I mentioned as a jimmy though)
---
This map is so dumb for the killer play,it has a lot of infinites,every killer knows that will have a bad time playing on haddonfield
---
And hello to you willing fellow!
---
It really sucks when survivors do this. I have escaped plenty of times after 2 hooks, even games where I was hooked during Collapse, and if teammates just give up on hooks they basically throw the game for everyone very often, since even going down from 4 to 3 survivors matters a lot more than people think. 
---
Even as a killer, I often just let the last 2 survivors go or give hatch when it was a good game and I got plenty of hooks, but you just throw the game away and get me in a difficult position where I cannot get a nice 2K and let the rest go...
---
I understand what you're saying about entire palette changes not being the best solution (most of the games I've played with accessibility options will simply change key HUD elements rather than the entire image), it's just that the filters are easier to understand for people who aren't colour blind. Perhaps I should have added a third row showing how the filter "actually looks" to someone with colour blindness rather than just the second row showing how the filter looks to the average eye.
---
The problem with changing auras is that the average eye is tuned for green, and having that as an option would give the average killer a significant advantage when it comes to following scratch marks. Blue would help *most* people, and is roughly comparable to red in terms of the average person's sensitivity, but that could cause problems for tritanopes like yourself.
---
I suppose it's up to the devs to decide how much of an impact more visible scratch marks would have on the game. If they feel the difference is moot, we'd arguably be closer to custom auras.
---
This is the first I'm hearing about doc rework, what's that about?
---
I do that. Doesn't make much of a difference if people aren't doing gens. I never even attempt escape and try to keep them busy for all the time I have, but I have had rounds where a teammate would go down next to the hook in an attempt to unhook and just rot on the floor, not even moving away from the hook. And in such cases there IS no punishment for the killer. You can't expect the Survivors to do the punishment reliably. Which is why I hope for a punishment by the devs.
---
I like to not wind up the first or second loop and just follow or swing depending on how close the survivor is. Once I get a feel on how a survivor plays, I can then judge how to play the loops then.
---
Your playing a 110 killer, this means if your playing against good survivors you don't have a power at the loop because its its telegraphed and slows you down.
---
If you try the standard pull a hatchet when they drop the pallet loop they simply dont drop the pallet and keep running, your best bet is to hold W and get the m1. Only try to hatchet in open areas.
---
I get kicked all the time, No intentions of DCing. I even have my PS4 plugged directly into the modem with a cable to help latency. I wouldn't want to get banned for something out of my control. Even if im getting romper stomped I'll play a game til the end. I had three people all DC after the first hook the other day, and then the Freddy found me and got the Mori... Shit happens!
---
Spine Chill
---
I've been chased out of the exit gates by the killer in endgame before. Maybe it happened here?
---
This is fucking awesome
---
Every time you hook someone who is not the obsession, you gain a permanent token. For each token you have, all survivors get a 3% penalty to their action speeds.
---
The only thing they should do is make it more obvious when shes phase walking or give some sort of clue as to where she's going. Shes strong yes, but shes not overpowered.
---
Yes, it's easily the best survivor perk
---
Yeah probably haha, the idea of voting would be cool but has to be managed better. kinda hard in a asymmetrical game.
---
At first if disagree with you but after playing for a few months I agree specially with the state Friday is in; whenever I play it‚Äôs a broken mess now, whenever I play,  the cutscene for the beginning of the  never loads. My counselor is always chosen at random even though I‚Äôm selecting a specific character. It‚Äôll even say I picked the character I wanted but when I load in I‚Äôm someone completely different. 
---
Honestly I can deal with most of the game breaking bugs just fine but if I‚Äôm not to choose my character (the one thing we should have full control over) then I don‚Äôt even want to play. I haven‚Äôt played Friday the 13th in almost a month. It makes me sad I don‚Äôt play anymore but it‚Äôs simple; the developers care about this game. Jason‚Äôs developers don‚Äôt.
---
It's from the halloween event last year: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/The_Hallowed_Blight
---
Sounds about right
---
1) You don¬¥t even know what exactly the announcement is, just guessing
---
2) It might be a rework, which is a lot more interesting than just a straight out nerf
---
3) It is just a teaser dude, it¬¥s not like they spent hours of dev time to create some insane trailers or whatever, it is just a gif...
---
Peace was never an option. 
---
*Goes invisible and sneaks behind your medic*
---
Heh- nothing personal, kid.
---
Survivors should never get a choice.
---
Killer should argueably never either, but i'd like a veto/voteban system from each side
---
Killer bans one map, survivors get 4 votes and the highest voted map wins, random if its 2-2. Each side votes at the same time, revealed simultaneously and allows for the same map to be banned.
---
So did it work or not?
---
Sounds like a normal spirit gamer lol
---
It's not worthy of a tease. They should've just sent patch notes
---
Imagine beeing a kid during the golden age of american comis and waiting to see each weekly/ monthly issue of these, and then seeing them beeing adapted as a video game years later.
---
I like it, it makes her 10x more scary its exciting hearing her near me and looking around franticly until I spot her
---
Who are you even talking to? I said none of those things.
---
I believe it's the 13th at 11am EST.
---
But if you're in game then check the event section in the news, it'll be listed.
---
Lol!
---
How is that better
---
Iirc it's why we see death cows in the maps instead of dead people. Atleast on release.
---
Skill level from the Spirit's side determines whether or not there is miniscule counterplay versus no counterplay. Your skill as a Survivor does NOT matter. Equiping IW is not a skill (not to mention it's countered by Stridor). You get injured and you don't have IW, you are dead. You get injured and you have IW but they have Stridor, you are dead. Doesn't matter how "unpredictable" you try to be.
---
Where have you said anything factual? You literally just said "she's jukable" and went talking about the 1k viewers. You offered nothing factual.
---
Your only counterplay is purely guessing. She's not phasing? You get to close, you get hit. You don't, she waits for you to do something before phasing, you get hit. Was that factual enough? You get zero info on what to do while she gets ample. And even if you feel like you made the right decision, there's always the chance of her bumping into you slightly.
---
spirit nerf
---
Or to wait for them to actually pull the pallet
---
Nope ... just left for death after doing them one for letting them off when the collapse came. 
---
To explain more thoroughly 
---
When the exit gates powered, a survivor was on the hook and me and the another survivor attempted the unhook by me being the diversion and him going the save. Instead of healing and going for my rebound hook, they took it upon themselves to just open the gates and leave. One actually bagged so I knew it was SWF
---
I feel bad for the first teams I played against. Lol I thought this, too. All i saw was "Attempt Escape" and I was like "Oh hell yeah i'm getting off this hook," and what made it worse is that I got super lucky on my second ever escape attempt and got off the hook not knowing about the 4% chance. Got so mad wondering why I did it once but couldnt do it again.
---
I linda kinda like the idea of survivors pick three, then killer picks from those three. The question is whether or not the killer player can change their killer after seeing the three maps picked or not. 
---
I would love to never have to play on haddonfield as Leatherface ever again.
---
You're an idiot lol just like nurse's add on rework I'm sure XD
---
Why only killers though? Its worse when a survivor dcs cause then you have to wait for the game to end. At least when a killer dcs you can quickly move on to the next game.
---
Ok, then wait for patch notes. Who cares, it¬¥s just a gif. Some people enjoy the little things.
---
He stopped chasing me after he fell, but i died cause i was over-altruistic at the end of the game tho
---
Oh i didn't refer to the video, I am just saying generally about  last minute saves and I didn't even say anything about the objectives, I am just trying to have a discussion y'all. I get it you all have morons here throwing insult at you every time you make a point.
---
I just think it's like fuck you to some players playing as killer but again I know it's their fault for "throwing the game away" but again sometimes I forget dead by daylight is supposed to be a casual game due to the major consequences simple mistakes can can have.
---
when they are idiots sure
---
You get close to the surv ? I cannot never get close to them when they loop me :/
---
So you played the game at low ranks?
---
I wish I had those perks
---
Why would you enjoy a 2 second clip from a video they posted a year ago?..
---
Nice! i think they will do something about it in the future its just that they're so slow in development and have other priorities atm i think
---
Okay let‚Äôs see. 
---
You double blink and hit a survivor. Now you must wait 3.5 seconds to double blink again. 
---
You double blink and down a survivor. You must wait 3.5 seconds to double blink again. That‚Äôs 7 seconds spent waiting for your double blink to come back. 
---
7 seconds can be a decent amount of time in this game. And if you fuck up a double blink suddenly that 7 seconds turns to 10.5 seconds, which is almost enough time to outdo a fully stacked Thanatophobia  on a generator. 
---
If it takes you 4 double blinks to catch a survivor, that‚Äôs 14 seconds of recharge time ur waiting on, which is almost enough to get a full heal off on a survivor, undoing ur hit. 
---
Again the issue I have is in full form here. It‚Äôs too *easy* to beat Nurse. It‚Äôs supposed to be hard. It‚Äôs supposed to be a game of mind games and jukes, not blindly holding W while her recharge time, 97% MS, and only 20 meter blink range prevent her from catching you
---
Haven't played much of the game... at all really, but do any of the killers teleport?  'Cause Jason can do that at least.
---
Your opinion is still trash
---
You should run like one other, specifically ruin. Because they‚Äôll be looking for ruin, if they find any totem, they‚Äôll break it, 2 in 3 chance it‚Äôll be haunted grounds.
---
I‚Äôm doing gens, you?
---
[Your Obsession gets a buff to healing and unhooking. Every time you hook someone who *isn't* your Obsession, the non-Obsessions get an stacking penalty to repair, healing, and sabotage](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dying_Light). 
---
In an average game you can build 9 stacks, but if you can switch your Obsession (via Decisive Strike, for example) then you can theoretically build 11 stacks.
---
Now his being an idiot? Op is just stating is joy ain‚Äôt nobody being idiotic.
---
A good survivor knows if your gonna do that or not, they wait until the last second of you entering the pallet stun zone or if you pull out the hatchet and keep running
---
You took 3 minutes to down 2 people? And you wonder why you are losing.
---
when someone feel so proud about a game rank so he shared with the rest of the world must be having serious issues
---
daddy wasnt care?
---
I am rank 11, but he I don't remember
---
Right, I wasn't clear, I meant to say they threw a weird tantrum because they didn't get an easy map
---
For me, it takes 5 to 7 minutes
---
I would run color blind settings just for the change in scenery lol.
---
except nurse passively regens her blinks relatively quickly
---
Hey man, whatever works for you!
---
I kept my build until Rank 2. Where kinda i can't rely on anyone else healing me as it wastes time. So now i run:  
---
Balanced, Spine Chill, Inner Strength, and iron will i believe. I don't really like DS or Adrenaline. Yesterday i had 3 games in a row with double pip, vs freddy, pig and Bubba.
---
I know there are way better combos of perks. Just wanted to throw mine out there.
---
Total nerf to uselessness lol
---
If you want to waste a perk slot by all means do you boo boo, at the higher (lower?) ranks this is not a perk that's used.  Most people run a movement perk, WGLF, DS, and BT or even get Prove Thyself or We'll Make It in the mix.  Spine chill is a useless utility compared to any of those IMO, and seems to apply to everyone below Rank 4.
---
Well, that would make him see better, yeah?
---
His own game is a joke at this point and the licensing rights will be settled eventually. It's still possible, slim yes, but possible.
---
Freddy. The hag. The nurse. Demogorgon. The spirit kinda teleports too
---
the issue with her isn't JUST about whether she's phasing or not, the survivor has zero indication to even guess where she is once she is.  you can't counter a killer with no auditory or visual cues - and the spirit herself has both on her end against the survivors, which is why it's unfair.  I have a few thousand hours in this game and Spirit is ridiculously broken.
---
Survivors are mean and queue times are long. When the devs take steps to change these things I‚Äôll play killer again.
---
Oink
---
I love it
---
D *is* the filter, or at least how it looks to average eyes.
---
Without the filter, the person sees the image immediately above it - gens are virtually invisible.
---
Because as surprising as it is, everyone likes different things and isn¬¥t as grumpy as you are.
---
Strategy
---
That‚Äôs a literal rework, they reworked her addons. It‚Äôs not like they made them all weaker, they changed them to do different things. If you‚Äôre seriously too stupid to understand the difference between a rework and a nerf you shouldn‚Äôt try talking about balance
---
No, it makes it so that Steam and Windows store players can play together
---
Make the killer teleport across the lake when they walk into it
---
Thats what me and my wife do to lol! Its always WAY more fun to play with the spouse!
---
I usually play Micheal and i will be in tier one and go around the corner and a survior will jist run right into me and give me a bit of a scare
---
Go watch TrU3Ta1ent so u might learn to play last crying baby I‚Äôm gonna talk to.
---
Dude what's wrong with you he would just like a more causal  game mode so he can play who he wants.
---
So yeah. Anyone dc‚Äôing after that is just bad at the game
---
Being able to make scratch marks green wouldn't do much in my opinion. By default they already stand out very well against dark background and can be seen cross map. That's how they are made to be, something that screams at the Killer "SOMEONE IS HERE!". The point of auras and scratch marks is to make them stand out as much as possible. So being able to change their color to something that stands out would only support their function.
---
Besides. When was the last time scratch marks or an aura being too visible caused a problem? It has always been them being not visible enough.
---
"Just play survivor"
---
I'd rather they just ramp up BP rewards of the archives and then just remove daily's altogether. Enough to where completing the tome would yield the roughly the same amount of BPs as two weeks of dailys (or however long they wait between releasing tomes.) 
---
Some of the dailys come natural, like 5 shred attacks or plague hitting sick survivors. But others, like ghostfaces, are hot garbage that cause you to lose the game. Whereas the tomes are actually fun and challenging to get.
---
They just mentioned he's next, and that they aren't trying to "nerf or buff" him but make him more enjoyable to play as/against.
---
As a colorblind man myself, I send a tweet to BHVR every day begging for a colorblind mode. Corn kills me and I can hardly ever find scratch marks.
---
Agree. Cute kitty.
---
Then how do you correctly play against spirit? Iron will is countered by stridor and spine chill doesn‚Äôt help in a chase, just gonna get that out of the way before you claim those are counters.
---
I think they mean you can only get the Halloween skins meaning you can't use serum to buy other cosmetics lol
---
She was vommy mommy way before bricky did his case file.
---
No. I‚Äôm holding out hope though that they‚Äôll do crossplay for PS4 and Xbox together. I think that would be fine, and probably healthy for the game tbh.
---
Her own chase music was just some dude on here who was making unique chase music for killers.
---
This is correct.
---
Wut
---
Or just give general daily like hook survivors, use power x times, disturb crows...
---
Killers have moris, noed, devour hope and tons and tons of extremely strong addons.  The game is supposed to be balanced around the four survivors working together being of equal power as the killer.  With Spirit, old Nurse, etc., that's far from the case.  They're broken, not just "strong".  Just "strong" would be Billy, Huntress, Freddy, etc.
---
Now the killer is getting nerfed that i use to relieve my pain ):
---
I almost fell into that while chasing a Kate.
---
He's just having fun, leave him be
---
No, it‚Äôs just between steam and windows store right now. But why not play with console players? Survivors are equally good on console and pc, which means killers have to be as well. It really doesn‚Äôt make much difference
---
Because some people see every action through the lense of Survivor mains vs Killer Mains.
---
others see everything through the lens of "BHVR are stupid jerks who ruin their own game". 
---
The venn diagrahm between these is pretty significant.
---
I have over 3,500 hours in DBD.  you're obviously just an entitled killer main who needs free kills.
---
Could you do scratch marks? This is cool and I wanna see if it‚Äôs just me being a shitty tracker or if my color deficiency actually is affecting it.
---
bhvr bout to drop genji on us aint they
---
Me: *gets stunned on every pallet because I have brutal strength and I ain‚Äôt letting no one loop me unless they find a window, even then I have said windows trapped 40% of the time anyway* I‚Äôll fuckin eat it again.
---
I mean she is already sliced up , getting gutted won't mean anything.  She severely needs changes. The most boring killer in the game . To play as I'm sure she is fun. To play against not at all. She has zero counter.  Zippo , zilch, nada . I'm sure its more of a QoL change and balancing ar the same time . You have no idea when she uses power, or hell even vaults, prayer beads are miserable(not even scary just miserable as then you just work on gens waiting to get pulled off).  You can say there are counters but they rely heavily on perks and even a good spirit won't be affected by them.  You can't really walk away from her to get away as she can unphase and find you . They didn't really think her through correctly when making her
---
Yeah.. but that wasn‚Äôt the case there.. so no :)
---
Way too early for that. Current rift still has 57 left.
---
BHVR rarely teases things more than 2 weeks out (unless it blows up and they have to pull it).
---
I'm talking about how they said it was an add in nerf and then nerfed her base kit.
---
I mean yea legion got a rework but legion is still probably the worst killer in the game so they still need one. Other killers should definetly get one first but that doesnt excuse that they still need one.
---
I mean hell this next rework will actually be docs second lol
---
"Explaining the huntress rank 1 mindgame" thats it.It will help you a lot
---
TBH, if Demo had echolocation that would be fucking awesome.
---
It took me a very long time to realise that we weren‚Äôt meant to be looking at her ass.
---
I have hope that someday we will and I believe that a lot
---
I appreciate that üñ§
---
Pig! I know who the boss is! It‚Äôs-*claudette uses king crimson*
---
Was pissed bloodhunt wasnt tied to withering blight. Thought it was going to last 2 weeks not a weekend.
---
Don't think so, just doing an impression of an uneducated person
---
Of course she's injured and running around like crazy. XD
---
Looks great
---
Thanks!
---
I got two questions.
---
1. Next time the dlcs be on sale, stranger things dlc will have a discount?
---
2. If i want to buy a killer only (no survivor or map) is worth get it with auric cells? Or should i get it with iri shards instead?
---
&gt; *I Still don‚Äôt understand why you need perks to change your Fov*
---
Game balance, same way killers are first-person and survivors are third-person.
---
If I could set my own FOV then I'd be running 120¬∞, purely because I was drilled into using it when playing as Xenomorphs in Rebellion's 1999 AvP. Survivors wouldn't have a chance.
---
Really like how rin looks
---
....What?
---
this survivor is too RAW! it needs to be cooked to perfection!
---
I really love this game but the wait times for killers are really putting a damper on things.
---
I wish there was a skirmish room you could hang on to get your chops up while you wait.
---
A lot of killers just leave. I'd probably camp also. Its shitty to go to that map
---
This would be a very odd way to announce balance tweaks imo. Doctor and legion are scheduled to have reworks first, and this teaser seems to be more to build up hype than actually tell us what's going on. I'm sure BHVR would just come out and tell us if they had balance changes planned.
---
Shes a good killer until you get to pallet loops. She shuts down windows and open areas but she is just so weak otherwise. 
---
Everything im saying is assuming good survivors, and even at red ranks you dont get those all the time. If your purple or above honestly your probably fine and can just disregard everything im saying, just play who you have fun with, but dont be mad when MM fucks you over and gives you a good team that can bully you
---
I get it, if you want to pretend that he was just harmlessly doing this and not doing it in case the killer was behind him that's fine. And it's obviously a sign that he does it anytime he's leaving the exit gate when the Killer is near but whatever. It's douches like him that make the game toxic, that think they have to rub it in the Killer's face even after they beat them. But let's just pretend he was twerking as he says LOL.
---
Do you play on pc?
---
*David hoists himself onto a hook, then folds his arms, staring at the two killers*
---
"Well? I'm waiting."
---
Wait otz uses STBFL?
---
Did he do this before I started using it (start of October) or after? I just thought it would be fun to use (and it is... especially when my first catch is the obsession!)
---
Tale yoga classes with Demogorgon yall, Take a deep breath now, In *Inhales* and out *ROOOOAAAAARRRRR*
---
Im a both main who has won against tier 10-1 spirits. U are not that good for ur hours. And main killer is trapper so i need to think properly to get kills and I‚Äôm tier 8 killer and a tier 7 survivor.
---
Well the devs use feminine pronouns for her, probably because many of the devs speak French and French has no gender-neutral pronouns. So Yes but probably not female in the human sense because of the whole, y'know, etheric spider god existing outside of reality and time thing
---
Ok thanks
---
What are people complaining about?
---
\*walks happily in the comic book store, drops 15ct and run home with a big smile on my face\* :)
---
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
---
He would forfeit unless you have a weapon if ya get what I‚Äôm referencing?
---
If I can find a good screenshot that best illustrates the issue then I'll definitely look into making a comparison image for next week.
---
Well not really the boss at all, the white rosy cheek girl is the boss
---
Wha- what the FUCK
---
D looks like a straight upgrade to me, the red outlines are much easier to see against a blue-ish cornfield than traditional yellow one.
---
That's what they want is to figure out ;)
---
But seriously, my guess is that there just happens to be a hint in here that can give us information on the next chapter.
---
Billy don't step in the hole!
---
Lol just teabag, The killer stops right in front of yo hand doesn‚Äôt attack
---
**wait this isn‚Äôt outlast nevermind**
---
:3?
---
The whole point of my argument is that you have faith in a team to do a rework when the last rework they did was a full on nerf that they claimed was a rework.
---
ah nothing better than doing ur start of match chainsaw and running right into a survivor
---
Queue Times lol
---
Started 2 1/2 Hours ago I totally played 3 Rounds, and they haven't lasted to long...
---
Do I leave scratch marks when I walk or is it only when im running?
---
Do I make more noise when I walk than when I Crouch?
---
As a coloublind player thank you!!!! I hope they listen to us
---
Same thing happened here. GF thought she wouldnt like DbD. Now she's about to pass me in hours played. So proud :')
---
Odd. So who is the menacing man?
---
Lmao, listen dude get rid of SC, that's the first thing you want to do to get out of that "baby-surv" mentality; most newbs get told to use it but the only thing that does is create this over-protective immersed gamestyle that is not beneficial to most in-game situations for survs. I've seen people in ""high ranks"" still misuse that perk, wasting time in a corner self-caring while mangled, with one surv hooked and one slugged, against a oneshot killer, not realizing that they're throwing the game and they end up dying 80% of the time.
---
Windows is good but just for a beginner, with time you understand where vaults and pallets are by looking around u and it  becomes a wasted perk slot.
---
Balanced is strong overall, more situational than DH but more rewarding (cause of that 75% reduced stagger duration from falls which can come handy), u can keep that, i personally like DH more.
---
Adrenaline is strong but situational.
---
DS is a wildcard, it can be countered easily by slugging but if the killer happens to pick u up (or from a locker for example) and eat the DS, it can be a good opportunity to break the chase and waste his time (or even escape in a eventual end-game situation after being unhooked). I think to make the best use out of it you should be at least decent at looping (if not then don't bother using it cause you're probably gonna downed after 10 seconds), and also pair it with Unbreakable, which is a situational perk by itself but can compensate the lack of efficiency of DS when slugged.
---
ps: rush gens.
---
I can‚Äôt possibly explain without spoiling it
---
Holy shit you're still going...
---
i am really getting sick of this fucking cartoon, i found it cute at the beginning but now it's just getting  ridiculous
---
It's not my fault if I cannot play Nurse or better killers
---
You first mistake was ever subscribing to any sub on reddit to begin with.
---
This has nothing to do with zerolenny
---
# do you want a fucking slap?
---
Pls don‚Äôt actually be insulted I just like zerolenny. I like his memes too.
---
Bosun Biller Overboard.
---
&gt;It's not worthy of a tease.
---
That's exactly why this isn't teasing out any spirit reworks. It's more likely something else entirely (the next chapter).
---
yeah but not the hair and the cosmetic doesn‚Äôt look douchey enough
---
Well, I guess the good news is that you can acquire tritanopia - it's not one of the ones that you have to be born with.
---
Amen
---
Maybe he changed his mind, happens don't take it personally.
---
Spine chill is definetly going to be more popular currently, not only it reduces the stress when facing one of the hardest killers (silent spirit) it is also a really nice counter against any stealth killer because it makes it easier to tell when they are coming for your gen.
---
I still can't see Claudette
---
Papa? Big man of hell himself? Enemy hotel manager? Annoying as hell customer?
---
Look, I looked up the best ending to many video games before beating them because I like spoilers. I like knowing what it is I‚Äôm working towards.
---
Racing games are much easier with a controller as well
---
Why, i have it and perform just fine and am prety sure this is bs
---
&gt;base speed same as crouch
---
WHAT
---
I actually get this bug a lot. It‚Äôs truly annoying.
---
my boyfriend sees red as gray. No other problems. He can even see most hues of orange fine. If the scratches and blood could just be slid to orange instead of red... he could enjoy this game
---
STOP REPAIRING THE GENERATORS YOU DONKEYS
---
&gt; no, she blows chunks in a chase.
---
I'm waiting for a new original killer
---
YAY let‚Äôs fucking absolutely obliterate Spirit off the face of the fucking planet
---
Most people understand the placebo effect in the context of pharmaceuticals as being the fake drug. What tends to be forgotten is that real drugs also benefit from the placebo effect. They tend to have an increased effect because people believe that they will work. Double blind studies are often used to compare the effect of a real drug to a placebo drug. Taking the measured effect of the drug, minus the effect of the placebo drug, gives you the effectiveness of just the active ingredients.
---
I disturbed his playground time
---
Ahhhhhh...
---
Still, could have done some kind of collab with him or maybe they'll do their own. A rework/nerf is FAR more likely though. I just want killers to have their own music.
---
Well,he explains why you should make the survivor do the path you want so you can try to hit him.Anyways,I just started playing huntress and Im learning a lot when I see Zubatlel and Scott Jund,amazing huntress players
---
True, but I use an alt account for Dead by Daylight.
---
what movie is that from?
---
The fuck are you on? Streamers play on Low because you can see the killer's Red Stain more clearly than on High.
---
So you‚Äôre talking out your ass. Tru3 is decent at the game, but he‚Äôs pretty biased and doesn‚Äôt reflect much on himself. He likes spirit because she overperforms and he‚Äôs got it twisted up so that that‚Äôs fair somehow. Tru3 is a nice enough guy who usually has decent balance ideas, but I feel like he‚Äôs gone downhill recently. All of a sudden he thinks he‚Äôs better than he is with a lot of killers and has a bad habit of claiming the survivors did something OP or unfair. Normally Tru3 is a person to listen to, but recently he‚Äôs lost a bit of credibility in my eyes. If you want to give me your own tested method instead of quoting content creators and talking out your ass I‚Äôd be happy to listen.
---
Idk about his lore or anything, but to me he looks like a ripped chav
---
Oh, so they might make some of his madness add-ons permanent? I'm worried what they might take away though.
---
Then how much time does it take to repair a generator with 2 people working on it ? And 3 ?
---
only good one is prayer beads rework, maybe you could hear her phasing but always, as in, you always hear the whooshing even if she‚Äôs on the other side of the map, kind of like freddie‚Äôs add on. not hearing grunts of pain would make her a f tier killer, especially with no collision, you. could literally stand still or walk and she‚Äôd have no idea where you are
---
As him the treatment/punishment toggle system is just bad design. Should be reworked completely to not have modes but instead have his shock charge up and slow him down. Have the passive madness effect when he's holding a full charge. Nerf his range add-ons but give him charge speed add-ons. To make him more fun to play against maybe move some random effects to add-ons and make the baseline effects consistent?
---
[Event Horizon](https://youtu.be/7l-1RYrJNoM)
---
Yeah true, same here. But it does always remind me how ridiculously fast stalking goes when you do it from cover. And I got lucky with one of the maps with trees everywhere so there were tons of places to lean from.
---
I prefer filthy blade + sws. Throw on dark devotion so I can give survivors PTSD of old legion. Throw on thanata and sloppy and survivors are slow enough without ruin.
---

A-fuckin-men. But I still keep plugging at it.
---
Claudette looks like Anthy from Revolutionary Girl Utena and I am HERE for that.
---
Good for you
---
I just bought Spirit and don't get to enjoy her fml
---
Cuz they're cunts. Pretty simple.
---
What is noed?
---
I hate toxicity as well, but dont you think youre letting your experiences influence what youre viewing? You have no clue if he thinks its twerking or not, its not crazy to think someone may do it for a different reason than tbagging. You have no clue if this player has ever done this at any other point than now, this is the only clip they have, so you saying its a sign that they do it all the time makes no sense youre just making that up to further justify a dislike of what theyre doing. Regardless, this action right here, in isolation has no negative consequences on anyone, so it is not a bad action.
---
You would make money if you sold full-size posters of these on Redbubble or something. You are leaving money on the table right now, man. I would buy them immediately. These are so fantastic.
---
Ty,tomorrow i draw another one Rin art,i think you‚Äôll like itüñ§
---
thank you for the reccomendation
---
I think its hilarious when killers go full tilt and face camp while smacking you. Then they hit you with something spicy in post game chat.
---
Giving you a follow on here so I can keep up on your work üòÅ
---
Yeah OP is getting dislike bomber like Christ people ignore the post if it hurts you that much
---
Entity, I'm trying to sneak around, but I'm D U M M Y T H I C C. And the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the survivors!
---
entity, what is a book?
---
I hate rank 20s
---
Again, Nurse has been #1 for years. She sticks out not because she is an exception to a rule of "crippled" killers (pretty much all killers outperform survivors statistically at all ranks), but because her ability is game-breakingly strong. She finally got her overpowered add-ons addressed, but she is still a broken design on paper and still #1. 1 change after more than 2 years is hardly a "trend".
---
Also, this post chain started with Billy, not "#1 killers". Billy who also has not been changed in years, apart from a buff.
---
Spirit will get addressed because she has flaws, not because they are headlessly nerfing top tier killers. And she will still be top tier.
---
I think new Freddy is great but I wouldn't put him top 3. Imo Billy and Huntress still edge him out. Billy has insane snowball potential and mobility which makes up for his weakness in some loops - which still isn't a huge issue for good Billys. 
---
I'd say: Nurse &gt; Spirit &gt; Billy &gt; Huntress &gt; Freddy &gt; Hag in regards to the really good killers.
---
Are you implying an announced gif pulled from the spirit teaser a year ago is a tease for a new killer?...
---
The nurse is just as good as she was, her addons got changed but she‚Äôs still ridiculously strong. Her charges come back before her 10 minute stagger is over. Please educate yourself and play the game more
---
Can‚Äôt wait for spirit!!!
---
He goes back to tier 2.
---
I had a game, two people at full, ran past me (Hook was outside the exit door) and not a single one stopped to get me off. just kept going. No NOED, no level 3 michael or ghostface mark. Just dipped out. I was wicked heated!
---
Okay lol play her against me. Let's do a kyf. I'll run, you play nurse.
---
Jason seeing all the killers being tortured by the entity* (jk)
---
You‚Äôre missing the point.l, this isn‚Äôt a nut hanging contest. You‚Äôre I‚Äôll informed.
---
Corn blindness is real
---
I'm hoping it turns up on the shrine at some point soon. It's not a huge priority like BBQ or DS but it looks like a useful  time saver on paper.
---
Thanks. Hopefully now I can survive against him longer haha
---
can i have that thanks
---
If you hit a survivor with a throwing knife they have to heal before they get downed
---
You know the game is in a bad state when something like this makes everyone say "That's impossible"
---
what‚Äôs a square cooldown?
---
Plague is awful in higher ranks sadly.
---
SHOOT. i thought GF crouch was same as base speed i was wrong i take that back lol i was trying to compare it to that
---
If you have a claim back it up with evidence. You said she's still just as good. So come do a kyf and let's see how long it takes for you to down me.
---
If you down people that quickly you don't need Dying light because your will already have a lot of pressure
---
Plague is pretty OP depending on circumstances.  
---
She can steamroll everyone pretty fast if survivors cleanse when there's like 5 gens remaining.
---
why tf do you play the game if it‚Äôs so miserable?
---
Okay I‚Äôm not going to argue with stupidity, have a nice day kiddo.
---
Strange to promote tweaks, they didn't do this for Legion or Nightmare.  Just said they were reworking
---
Lol XD that's what I thought
---
From what I remember from Evolve (the slightly similar game to this) they had problem with just putting a filter on the game and that it didnt completely fix the issues. So it might be awhile before they can do anything about it bc if development  if a filter. But Evolve was a totally different looking game so idk. Also, not a game developer just going off what I know.
---
Yeah I play on console with my siblings. The gameplay is comical at high ranks compared to PC.
---
Jesus you‚Äôre an idiot all over today
---
Sadly I don't think the game is big enough for a new gamemodes.
---
As a Jason release special, allow a 2v8 match when Freddy and Jason are played together as killer. ü§©
---
And that's a good thing.
---
So relatable. I bought to own in about 2 weeks
---
Same that's why i remember it was almost impossible. Old d strike was insane
---
This whole time I thought it was ‚ÄúPenn‚Äù not ‚ÄúPrenn‚Äù.
---
It could just be fluff and we're all over-reading it.
---
right but like not seeing content come out because you dont like an imaginary story is a bit much
---
No, you‚Äôre just not used to controller. It‚Äôs the same
---
It was there one week ago bruh
---
At higher ranks you need all the pressure you can get. There are plenty of survivors who can effectively play against snares. I also use it for emblem points because if ruin gets cleansed immediately those 5 stacks slow down gens enough to maybe get iridescent gatekeeper.
---
Rin's father as survivor.
---
I won't happen but I want it too.
---
Had a goal to hit Rank 1 survivor without SWF. I did it, and it didn't feel good. Somethings not right about that. 
---
The game is great outside of red ranks. Sure, its not competitive, but its a great break from the norm. I come back to it a couple of times a year to hit rank 1 with friends so I wanted to do something different this time, and it sucked instead of feeling rewarding.
---
No, the nurse is fine. Only nurses that were mediocre before are bitching about it.
---
\*Laughs in Don't Starve\*
---
It makes zero sense for you to be playing DbD, and hate a guy that tried to murder his daughter when you have killers like Michael who killed his sister and countless other people, Trapper who killed hundreds of miners, Freddy who killed God knows how many kids and he's a pedo etc the list goes on.
---
Unless you hate all of those characters?
---
Make the grunts of main 50% quieter so it‚Äôs harder but strider negates it instead of making her completely unbeatable. I agree with no collision. Add a pause between her ending phase and the cooldown starts. Basically just watch dbd casefiles lol.
---
she did nothing wrong tbh
---
Bing bong, hell no
---
It could also just be a clue for the next chapter.
---
I would buy them if they went on https://displate.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAqqTuBRBAEiwA7B66hUIacWn7k5qVZ0moeexJ5Tjxiq9so6m93uR3_wty9RNgOoLkw42jthoCHhwQAvD_BwE or a framed art print!
---
I don't camp, the point is to prove them wrong.
---
I like how the little girl gives no fucks.
---
So if you loop you die? Well guess what, if you don‚Äôt loop you die so where‚Äôs the counter there? You can‚Äôt reliably juke her phase ever, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if you juke her unless you‚Äôre at a pallet. Frankly, you sound like an idiot
---
All got out!

There's always a chance, but it'll be a few yeara.
---
Spine chill is useless if you have good awareness, it just makes you complacent. And against spirit you need things to help in chase, so spine chill is worthless against her.
---
Yeah. He had basically already won the game but that need to be a jerk cost him his 4K.
---
Railgun doctor is fun to play against even if it means he'll zap people's auras from BBQ and Chili outside of his terror radius.
---
The only toxic build I can think of for Doc is the 3-gen build.
---
Maybe Rin's dad is the next killer, the Entity was there for him originally after all.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Meh, I don‚Äôt have a strong opinion either way on that one. Without the cooldown she was damn near impossible to shake, at least now you can punish her for blinking to the wrong spot
---
Yeah try to play without it until you get to around rank 5-10. Ruin is borderline mandatory in the high ranks for most killers but it‚Äôs kind of overkill when you‚Äôre playing against lower skilled survivors.
---
Yea but now you can also run in a straight line and it takes forever to catch up. Running in a straight line shouldn't be counterplay
---
I think Clown is worse
---
4 killers no abilities
---
1 bill with a shotgun
---
Because he's a queer
---
In the end it was I who was the fool.
---
I just want to see 4 survivors default dancing at exit gates instead of teabagging me
---
Hoover or Dyson?
---
I read it, it boiled down to ‚Äúguess lucky‚Äù. None of those are consistent, they‚Äôre literally telling you guesses you can make that may help. If your best tips are guesses you can make them there‚Äôs clearly something wrong with the killer
---
Since you've won against "tier 10-1 spirits", put your money where your mouth is and play a KYF with ScottJund to show him how jukable she is.
---
I can't even watch survivors struggle :(
---
Chucky or bust
---
BBC and Chilli
---
I didn't *fall* for anything. Your post wasn't a bait for anyone but the survivors who think Wraith actually is broken.
---
So you're going to feel good about being a rank 1 survivor who babyderanks and shits on the rank 15 killers down there?  They're defenseless up there they're only babies man.  They'll be looped into dust.
---
Well fuck.
---
It isn‚Äôt. No good nurse will be outrun in a straight line
---
Eat the all pallets
---
The fact that the teaser is from the spirit teaser is unimportant. The important part is that there's clues in the video, otherwise BHVR wouldn't have posted it. There's no reason the devs would give cryptic hints and drive up hype for something like a mild balance change. They usually just straight-up announce that stuff.

dude I love these too much, I'm happy your still doing them
---
Absolutely none of what I said, said guess.
---
No, you don't make scratch marks unless you're running.
---
YES, you make more noise walking that you do crouching; I can tell you for a fact from playing both sides.
---
This is one of the common misconceptions that result in bad survivor play...most experienced killers hunt by SOUND, using sight as a secondary.  Breathing, footsteps, and other actions will lead a good killer to you every time.
---
Only terribads stare down at the red marks on the ground.  Keeping your eyes up on the horizon actually watching and listening will lead you to a higher skill cap that staring down at your feet constantly.
---
After enough play time. You actually get to the point where you can tell the difference between footsteps on wood and footsteps on metal (such as stairs in Hawkins lab or the scaffolding around that big central building in Mcmillan.
---
Pay attention next time you're in a match...stepping on grass is like "tuff tuff tuff"...but running on those stairs be like "TINK TINKY TINK".
---
And then get worse if you climb too high.
---
my dad
---
Instead of hooking survivors, when he downs you, he grabs a random piece of environment ( building, pallet, box, locker door, etc. ) &amp; injures you with it in some way shape or form or just impales you on it. So every "hook" is a type of survivable Mori (except the 3rd) based on what type of map you're on and where he downs you. üíØ
---
They're a fucking queer for dcing
---
A lot of survivors at high ranks can't work through ruin so they hide around the map looking for totems, so ruin can be a bit overkill against lesser skilled players. I'd suggest experimenting with other perks and seeing what you like :) ruin will always be available on hag if you ever need it while climbing ranks and facing better survivors.
---
Only freddy can go without ruin at high ranks. You can also use corrupt, 2 minutes guarantee slow down game. Ruin is high risk high reward, corrupt is no risk moderate reward guaranteed.
---
Hallowed Blight ends on the 12th of November.
---
About the Rift, I‚Äôm not exactly sure. I guess just so survivors actually play the proper objectives and it gives players a bit more motivation to complete the Tome challenges.

I have trouble seeing red. So when I play killer, I lose survivor tracks more often than Id like, or dont see hooks. Tried to play with Nvidia's colour filters to try and make the red more intense, but then the rest of the game looks like shit. ;/
---
Gates are powered, not open. Small but important distinction.
---
Please use the pinned Megathread.
---
It's not about being outrun. It's about the amount of time that you sink into chasing a survivor running in a straight line. It takes like 2 or 3 blink sequences to catch up depending on where the chase starts.
---
Nea is just usually the character that most trolls or toxic players pick. She's got bright neon cosmetics so she sticks out. Usually takes a flishlight or insta healing medkits.
---
You're a dcing queer

No, they were all things you can do that might potentially help but you don‚Äôt know if they actually will. They‚Äôre all guesses
---
Love this!!!!!
---
I rarely can play cuz of my school but usually when i play i get 1-2 tiers higher
---
It has to be killer perks&gt;survivor perks because killer is the power role and which killer you play drastically changes the gameplay compared to the survivor.
---
And you‚Äôre an unlikeable cunt with no redeeming qualities to warrant your existence
---
Photoshopped
---
Let's take a moment and realize how perfectly timed that camera flash was.
---
For the killer it feels like you finally got that new fish trapped in cellblock D and you busting them cheeks
---
Only if you stand between 3 gens and just shock people off gens the whole game. It‚Äôs not even that strong of a combo if you don‚Äôt use it to defend gens/totems.
---
Blue or yellow surv tracks, and the same for highlithing hooks, gens, and surv when BBQ procs for example.
---
Part 5 was the imposter right?
---
I doubt that they will do it for a year or so
---
A square cooldown bar. Like Spirit, Legion, Plague, Ghostface, Freddy, Demogorgon and Nurse have.
---
I'm in a different mindset. I don't think killers should require add ons they should be supplemental.
---
It's almost like first-person is scarier than third.

They said Nea couldn‚Äôt get any uglier. They were wrong lol

I can only be Killer when I have 20 minutes to wait in queue and am ready for the only emotion that exists in my world to be hatred.

So I‚Äôm confused, I definitely understand the problem but what are the possible solutions? Just trying to learn here. Not negative. Want a good experience for everyone
---
No it's an explanation of how spirits chase mechanics work and how you can bend them into your favor.
---
Running a nurse is the exact same thing. It's you guessing where she will blink and trying to react to it.

---
Hard disagree. I think clowns slept on. Like hes at least at wraith level and I'd argue hes definetly better than doc. His gas helps so much and people dont wanna go through it. Legion has basically no power. Their strength is tracking and slowing the game down. They aren't really good at chase. And I think the only debatable one being worse than him(imo) is leatherface.

Yep you sure "showed" him.

I think charms should be put on gens as survivor rather than the player itself
---
The thing about reddit is that being correct doesn't matter. It's about how many idiots choose to support you. You are an idiot who doesn't care about facts or arguments so you chose his side. Which is fine and I totally support your right to do so.
---
Until Otz showed me the perk, I wasnt aware of how good it was and was a Legion main who was always complaining about the recovery on the swings xD
---
Mad grit iron grasp agitation BBQ is my personal favorite build it won't work all the time but when it does it really does
---
Legion again?
---
I get their weak but damn another rework on them
---
nerf the range addons? youre kidding right? and keep the base range? you know how trash that would make him right?
---
You should have had scratch marks on the ground aswell, I heard that its almost impossible to see
---
Jeff with the Helvete Scythe skin. Literally more terrifying than 90% of the Killers out there. Enough said.
---
Probably I'm completely wrong but listen!  
---
No new map in the next chapter, right? SO what if we're getting another variation of Family residence? And the new killer is gonna be Rin's Father? The Entity wanted to take him in the first place but then decided to take Rin. Maybe it still wants her father?
---
At this point, WHO FUCKING CARES.
---
Don't feed these assholes any game hype based on this pathetic mind game shit.
---
Their game is in a horrid state, ("cannot connect to host", anyone?!  LITERALLY unplayable).
---
I shit you not...as i was just typing this, I loaded into a lobby as Claudette,  got past the offerings screen only to DC after waiting for the load bar for this entire paragraph, and the end screen showed me running as a DWIGHT.
---
M-SCROTE is  a fucking tool, his team are all lazy, incompetent douchebags, and they only reason they keep putting out "teasers" is because you I morons keep giving them money for their BROKEN SHIT.
---
Me?  Only bought 2 DLC...Michael and Stranger Things, and it hasn't "ruined" or "gimped" my game.  (Coincidentally, the only two that seem two have been released mostly "unbroken" and didn't break the game when added...SEE?!  It's all about the money...they COULDN'T fuck up Michael because John Carpenter would sue them right up their stupid asses, and Stranger Things was, at the time, too popular for them to risk fucking up without also a follow on lawsuit).
---
Thier OWN content, however.
---
LOL!
---
FYI...DLC content perks DO still show up in the Shrine if you haven't paid for the xpac. 
---
So, stop slobbing their knobs and treat them like the irrelevant failures at life that they actually are.
---
Red rank killers on average and rank 15 killers aren't even the same species.  It's going to be cruel.  They have no idea how to counterplay looping up there.  None at all.  You're just going to end up curb stomping noobs learning the game and make them want to quit instead of manning up and playing players at your ability level.
---
  Sad man.  Quite sad.

"Low tier killers" mean killers you barely play, are brand new, or killers you are bad at.
---
Shitty, devs don‚Äôt agree
---
Yea it slows the game down to allow more time for practice

You've been acting like a petulent child on every thread whining about a teaser clip of all things.  You haven't given me a single thing to support man.  You're conducting yourself as a clown.

Are you guys serious? Why the heck would they tease a nerf? It's obviously something else ffs.
---
You mean Mathieu Cote, the Game Director?
---
Wonder why he would tweet about something releated to the game he's directing? Must be a conspiracy...
---
Seriously, that tease is for the new Killer. If Spirit's getting a big change, it'll happen in January.
---
Still not useless...would be a neat feature
---
Fugo should be Ruin, because he did precisely one thing and then peaced out like 30 seconds into the game.
---
No, it‚Äôs you SEEING where she‚Äôll blink and reacting to it.
---
lol that‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôve never seen this happen before and I‚Äôve been playing dbd over a year.
---
"Spirit mini rework"  
---
lmfao imagine bhvr would rework spirit because the community keeps crying about her being viable
---
how does getting vials work for hollow blight this year?
---
It‚Äôs directly from Spirits release trailer.  Unless it her father, then it‚Äôs a rework
---
Honestly yeah, you're right. Kinda sad tbh.
---
I searched for a whole hour at yellow ranks to dailies and eventually quit to play something else.
---
I don't get it
---
Not condoning it, but Haddonfield with Balanced Landing is just about the least fun thing to go against.
---
I have to disagree with you. I think the only time you should Camp someone is If they're really being a dick. Sometimes you just have to lose and that's okay.
---
Some people dont watch Reddit all day lol. I was watching his video on new perkbuilds and made it and posted this. Congrats for knowing similar memes exist and two people of millions had similar ideas?
---
Fretting
---
Everyone is complaining about Ironworks of Misery window and it's in the game since the release.
---
They all look great. If I had to change anything, I would have given huntress a taller face/head shape. Other than that I like it.
---
Not a killer main and I don‚Äôt jump, but I do get surprised when I bump into a survivor unexpectedly while playing a stealth killer.
---
Yea,I'm so used to the whispers audio cue I had to swap it out from my huntress cuz I don't notice it anymore lmao
---
I mean, i dunno, she just stood there, she let you down her
---
Daddy dearest is defs gonna be the new killer and I am living for that
---
They‚Äôre tied to The Rift, which is the battle pass for the game. All the vials are part of the free rewards.
---
Fretting?
---
He is garbage at high ranks unfortunately.
---
This is phenomenal
---
Which killers are you using it on? I‚Äôd say killer is more beneficial to Bloodwarden than perks.
---
Anyone with an instadown is a solid choice, Myers, Billy, Leatherface, or Huntress as she can get rapid hits in quick succession.
---
As for perks, maybe STBFL? Say you get multiple survivors running into the exit area you can hit them all with little cooldown.
---
do you take commissions?
---
Better get mercy as a survivor.   
---
Genji: Angela I need healing 
---
Mercy:  *explodes*

Just dodge the hatchets lul

I‚Äôve checked other sources and I‚Äôm pretty positive now that it‚Äôs 18%. Pretty good perk then
---
thanks!
---
(yes, i just copied my previous comment)
---
Thank you for your extremely helpful feedback, I hadn't tried that
---
You mean you seeing the direction she's blinking into? Lol
---
thank u!
---
Ty for you comm.I think next time i make huntress better(I am just from russia,and i think i understand your advice rightüñ§)
---
You made the spirit look adorable as fuck
---
Bullshit.
---
We have had 2 licensed killers be added in a row wee need an original
---
What is that melody?!
---
tunneling is a legit strategy, if the gens are being smashed you need to force some kind of pressure
---
You mean explaining how people's opinions about spirit are incorrect and giving examples and sources as to why they're wrong?
---
For me i find matches almost instantly as killer and it takes like 5-10 minutes to get one as survivor
---
The one I linked is still on the front page of this sub tho. Like it took me less than a minute to see it. Also it's been on the front page for over half a day so idk how you missed it, considering you have enough time to make memes for this sub
---
&gt;custom chase music
---
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
---
but on low graphics it straight up shows through a wall, if you look straight into a wall, a person on the other side with low graphics sees your whole red stain
---
Dunno man, Clown and Legion are both unfun to go against, like, really unfun, Legion being a really big annoyance for the survivor side, clown too at times
---
I've met way more successful Bubbas than Clowns and Legions, yes even when not camping
---
There are 5 survivors and 4 killers available for free. That‚Äôs enough for them to use them in a few tomes
---
Wait two of these look the same...
---
You're making a big assumption that it's a nerf. It's especially weird since it's unprecedented for them to "tease a nerf", so I'm curious why you're so sure that's what they're doing lol.
---
I see, thank you :)

Maybe they were just describing themselves?
---
"Hello Hag, i¬¥m trash"

Because I thought there was absolutely 0 chance they'd actually pull the "HER DAD IS THE NEW KILLER LOL" but tbh I think they actually are doing that now. I'll probably delete the post after I'm done arguing with triggered spirit haters lol
---
She had decisive strike
---
‚ÄúYeah I disconnect when people play as a team like they‚Äôre supposed to.‚Äù
---
No,sorry.But mb i future,because my skills now is not good enough to commissions
---
Is all because i love Rinüñ§
---
Exactly, that's why I somehow agree with these tactics in EXTREME situations, and I forgot to say that by tunneling I did not mean that strong ass tunnel in which you ONLY but ONLY go after one person, as some killers do. By tunneling, I mean if you happen to see that one person who is dead on hook pretty soon after she / he got unhooked, and you go for it and sacrifice that person (ofc, in the case of gen-rushing) it should be somehow accepted and understandable
---
Ty
---
Especially on low tier killers.
---
What 4 perks help in a chase?
---
You can only use 1 exhaust perk (well only 1 is usefull at a time untill the cooldown drops) and probably adrenaline. Then what?
---
As I said, spine chill helps against stealthy killers, you get warnings before you can actually see them so you can start running faster (which kinda helps in a chase, because the faster you start running to bigger the gap is they have to close).
---
That username with that perk would be Killer lol
---
That wouldn't work because of his size
---
I'd love that too. I really think they should embrace the silliness, this is a community of memes and juxtaposition humour, but they seem married to their hopeless gloomy edginess.   
---
*"It's in its sadistic nature. There is no swift kill as it delights in the obscene spectacle of our agonizing suffering."* 
---
...That's just the flavour quote for Sloppy Butcher. Chill out a little lol, spend less time looking through a Thesaurus and more time animating dances!
---
Yea dude and people wonder why they always play against spirit
---
Legion's not even that bad lmao. He's just boring, the perfect spot for a rework months away from now
---
Doctor and Leatherface should be top priority for buffs/reworks after Spirit.
---
thats not much better lol. i dont play much anymore but i still have to derank 3 times a season to keep my sanity so uhhh
---
Ty for your opinion,its soo important for me.But ill try to make my sketches better in futureüñ§
---
I‚Äôm on PC rank 1 both sides  and I play killer with Mouse and KB and survivor with controller. survivor on controller is very similar to survivor on M&amp;KB. The change would be incredibly healthy for the game but you‚Äôre letting elitism cloud your judgment.
---
Tyüñ§
---
That‚Äôs still happening? I took a 6 month break because I got booted from 5 in a row multiple days in a row, it was the only game I had issues with.
---
I had a game last night against a scratched mirror myres on lery's. I shit my pants at least 3 times
---
5 minutes! The gens are done by then if the killer isn't showing himself.
---
This Claudette was special for you manüñ§üòÇ
---
And how charged her blink is. Even if it‚Äôs not much it‚Äôs way WAY more than spirit gives you
---
As a Hundreds main, I'm terribly sorry for that match
---
My opinion is yes.
---
I think it‚Äôs great, whenever you‚Äôre ready for commissions shoot me a msg.
---
I've got jumpscared too many times by trying to reload as huntress and finding a random dwight
---
Its not like I have a ton of memes on this sub. Look at my account dude. This is the first one Ive ever made for r/deadbydaylight and I made it on a mobile app while talking to my friends on discord. Like I said, I dont spend all day perusing reddit. I just thought itd be a funny meme and posted it to see what others think. Didnt know every meme had to be an original masterpiece approved by the reddit "meme police" and heavily vetted before posting.
---
I'm sorry, but this stuff needs to go to a different sub.

https://youtu.be/19fyTS63bQ4
---
I totally agree, that's why I don't really use both of these methods, but if I really have a bad match and there is that goddamn t-bagging, pointing and flashlight blinding at every pallet scumbag and he gets downed at the end of the match, I will almost certainly camp the hook
---
I used to camp hard when the 5 gens were powered to secure one more kill, but as of recently, I just accept the fact that I should either play a better killer, or the fact that I really played bad.
---
Anyways, I made this post not because I do these things often, but because I really understand what some killers go through and I understand how it feels to only see camping and tunneling as a way to secure kills (again, used in extreme situations)
---
Camping makes sense if you're running a build that is used for camping on a chainsaw killer (Leatherface specifically) or if the gates are powered. If you're camping just because someone flashlight clicked or tbagged, you're just mad and it isn't a strat.
---
I generally never get that chance nor do I want to, because I generally only do it while they're in a chase/holding a survivor. Ive gotten about 4 killers that way. Only like 10 who were actually chasing me.
---
I am happyüñ§
---
It's alright. I play her too. It's unfortunately not rare to come across these obnoxious people desperate for a single sacrifice
---
As if knowing a nurse how much they charge matters when they can tilt down to shorten overcharged blinks.
---
Good nurses don't overblink anyway.
---
Its literally the same chase mechanics.
---
All spine chill does is make people play like pussies. It makes people start sneaking away from a gen every 30 seconds because spine chill lit up, meanwhile you‚Äôre sitting there on the gen just fine. It‚Äôs not even helpful against stealth killers because it‚Äôs pointless, if a killer can see you then you can see them. Anyone that legitimately thinks spine chill is good just needs to work on their awareness.
---
Glad we reached an agreement
---
Lol is this a joke?
---
It's a 'Nea is the killer' joke. If only one of you fucking morons would have read the code, it clearly says Audio_event/Sweden/, thus referring to nea whose nationality is swedish. Piece it together you clueless boomers
---
no  
---
this means he can travel any map anywhere ignoring the walls (4 seconds would be far better) and chuckle is no way good because there is a reason people can win chases
---
GG. Got adept Legion today, finally feel like I don't have to just use their base perks! Feels good.
---
Dsp is that you
---
It‚Äôs completely different chase mechanics, and that proves how stupid you really are. If you can‚Äôt tell the difference between being chased by a nurse and being chased by a spirit then you have some real problems that will prevent you from properly understanding a discussion of balance. I‚Äôm not gonna argue with someone this stupid
---
why are you this way? if people enjoy the teasers or hints then let them. if you don‚Äôt then ignore it and wait for the announcement. At what point does your brain click to ‚Äúi‚Äôm going to reddit to make a post about this.‚Äù
---
I think thats for a map not a killer
---
* General Spam - Extremely low effort and/or zero effort posts.
---
What are the gonna do, tbag on you? That's why they added ghost face so u can teabag back
---
Np
---
Spirit bad, please nerf
---
I find trying to loop anyone difficult so instead I try to mind game her/be unpredictable/hide. Since I hardly ever loop the same thing over and over so I'm not too threatened by the pallet mindgame, I just start walking away in some weird direction and if she just standing there I've gained some distance, if she's phasing I'm no longer there. As for why I enjoy this-it gives me a thrill, knowing I beat one of the stronger killers and its what I do anyway so her being blind actually makes me win chases more. It should be noted I haven't faced a rank 1 spirit yet, maybe things are different there, but at my rank 5-6 I have better survivability against her than ghostface or hillbilly for example.
---
scottjund completely destroyed tru3's video on spirit so you need to rethink your shit buddy
---
is there any reason why bhvr *hasn't* already added colorblindness settings? it seems like there's no downsides to it.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Too deep of a connection to scp-096 too.
---
She seems the same to me
---
I doubt they would post a teaser for new cosmetics
---
Oh my god. Stop teasing us and do some comic book already man! I want to pay for this.
---
Get the devs on the line!
---
I was referring to the god pallet.
---
The whole thing about the balloons that tie to people's wrists seems a little op. Not sure tho.
---
LOL you're BOTH wrong.
---
And Traoper is alot closer to Jason that you think.
---
Beartraps have appeared FOUR times that I can recall off my head...the reboot actually uses it for the first kill and in Jason's death.
---
Trapper also has a new skin from My Bloody Valentine, and all of his coveralls, although not reminiscent of Jason, DO evoke images of Victor Crowley (who was also played by Kane Hodder).
---
Wait... legion changes are coming? God bless!
---
It's a ln old Russian lullaby.  Just look up Huntress' lullaby on YouTube.
---
So in my multiple changes above you wouldn't need to enter treatment mode to shock. You could just do it. And you would add add-ons for speed on those shocks. You wouldn't need sniper doc range if you could reliably shock all the time. Read the whole post.
---
I think its the father
---
i used to be the other way around. played killer because i was too scared to play survivor
---
then i started to play survivor and i was like "oh wait this is fine lmao"
---
Rin is my waifuüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It's not that Spirit "changes up the gameplay," it's that she has no counterplay. (Despite what Tru3 would have you to believe, throwing down pallets while she is phasing isn't counterplay.)
---
No vault animation, no reliable way to know she's phasing in TR, passive phasing sometimes hiding which way she is looping a pallet, bumping into survivors while phasing.
---
It's impossibly frustrating to have no reactionary way to deal with her. It's all "Do this, and hope."
---
"Throw down a pallet while running and hope she didn't phase around."
---
"Slow vault a pallet and hope she was actually phasing"
---
"Slow walk away from the pallet and hope she either wasn't phasing, or is bad at spirit"
---
really impressive work !
---
Yeah, no, like I said its on my list. There was just a lot of stuff I wanted more, and I level killers and survivors equally, so my BP is all spread around
---
So here is what OP is trying to say:
---
Someone found a clue in the code of who the next killer is, codename "Sweden."
---
Nea is from Sweden according to her origin story: Therefore Nea is the killer and we were right all along.
---
It's too bad it's actually a reference to the actor who plays IT in the reboot:  Bill Skarsgard. He's from Sweden.
---
(Just my opinion!)
---
i forgot the galactic law that characters can only be in ONE game and that licensing issues can NEVER be resolved you're so smart how did you get so smart TELL ME NOW
---
its big brain time...
---
I just saw it as the entity didn't need to bargain at all and just let him loose for fun. My idea with Jason was that he flat out refused the entity's offer and only killed for Pamela, and the entity didn't do anything to intervene and just watched.
---
How can her power be used against her to fool her?
---
I think I‚Äôve played against the Plague only a handful of times before getting back into the game last month.
---
Word
---
Take my upvote
---
That could be cool
---
Wraith didn't want to uncloak lmao
---
Yep! Was chasing another survivor and suddenly one goes running in front of me, super close too. Made me jump lol
---
Not teleport just be discreet/incognito and there will be sound effects when he goes into and out of his balloon, they go through windows either and they will be slow moving
---
I'm totally with you on that one, actually. Toxic dipshits deserve a bad game.
---
How come the flashlight uses up battery everytime you use it? Shouldn't it only go down when you're actually blinding the killer, or revealing a mud trap? It never has enough battery to be useful without surgical precision, and that kind of experience must come with a lot of depleted flashlights. I would actually prefer having flashlights always drop when hit, instead of burning through batteries as quick as they do now.
---
0.45 seconds later\*
---
Started at 10 and I‚Äôm now at 28 7/10
---
Full disclosure: the F13 series was pretty boring for me. I remember like half of 2, the ending of 3, the general plot of 4-6, and that 7 is the most fun.
---
But yeah, he did use beartraps. And Kane Hodder has done a LOT of work. Big respect to him. You know he actually told the actor to hit him in Jason Takes Manhattan?
---
Sorry. I was making an Overwatch reference. :)
---
The Rift ends in 59 days I believe. After that you have 2 weeks before your serum expires. 
---
Serum is connected to the Rift, not the Hallowed Blight event.
---
Implying that there arent weaker and stronger killers is just stupid
---
Yes you can 4k with anything at red ranks
---
But saying that pig or plague has the same winrate and skillcap as Billy or nurse is just neglectful
---
they probably had a key if that‚Äôs what you mean
---
Was this a clever edit or did that actually happen? Because with DBD you never fucking know man
---
Oh, you mean the boogeyman behind me ?
---
I‚Äôm usually in 12-14 ranks as killer. Purple rank survivors are rare encounters for me.
---
I got a serious jumpscare when I came up on a survivor and they blew up the gen they were so scared. I think they were confused because I stopped moving because I was crying with laughter
---
nah, he had a medpack. And there is no way he could have used a key during a mori animation, had he even had one
---
First off i wasn‚Äôt entirely serious. And its unfair to to be like ‚Äúsurvivors are constantly nerfed‚Äù when killers get nerfed alot too. Look at pig who gets nerfed each patch. Look at huntress who gets worse the more maps they add into the pool I could go on. Also unlike survivors killers are unique thus when u nerf one the amount of actually good killers go down. I was over exaggerating but it does suck to see a good killer get nerfed when there isnt alot of good killers to begin with.
---
So, when the Hallowed Blight ends, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy skins with the serum then?
---
Maybe even one of the priests from The Exorcist.
---
gg ez
---
Of all survivors, you got my main, gg wp.
---
He started doing case files again?
---
Doesnt the father go into crazy mode like in the leaks?
---
Wait what, she had a mori but camped you on your second hook?
---
She was either very confused or felt that you need a timeout to think about your actions i guess.
---
You right click on the background thing and it let's you change it
---
That‚Äôs actually not a thing. I‚Äôve tested it
---
Pound for pound if I was to list them all the nerfs to survivor over the past year far outnumber anything they've done to killer to be fair.
---
oh sorry i didn‚Äôt read that right. probably a bug then, very odd
---
Over reading things? On the internet? Nooooooo
---
The hard shift of better survivors for me was rank 13/14 so thats when i would start but it all depends on how fast you feel the gens are getting done if you‚Äôre rank 11 and they have four gens but are down to like 2 survivors you don‚Äôt need ruin yet but have it on standby cause you will
---
Wait was this on ps4
---
Yeah. She brought a mori and then my guess is that she saw the number of gens going down and decided to camp so she'd at least get one kill.
---
Yikes.
---
yeah, very odd. That's why I asked the question, I was really O_o at that point
---
As main huntress I can laugh at this. Much fun especially against hardcore loopers
---
Xbox, but if I'm not mistaken cross-play is available. Why?
---
If it was on PS4, sorry, I was having some bad luck all night on both sides and wanted to cheer myself up. Nothing does it better than scratched mirror Myers on lery‚Äôs!
---
Me too ‚ù§
---
Yeah and maybe shes that dumb, but you can close the hatch. She can DS you all she wants
---
AAAAAH PEOPLE ARE SPELLING THINGS IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY TO HOW IT SHOULD BE, WE NEED TO REMOVE THEM IMMEDIATELY
---
You should've apologized for hurting them physically and emotionally
---
Just do bones lol
---
By the way I‚Äôm usually a purple/red rank survivor this is mainly for those survivors (like my friends) that get it used against them every game
---
That was me and I was high as shit, I forgot I brought a mori and I didn't feel like hooking someone. My bad man
---
TBH if you're in the basement it's bye bye for you
---
The demogorgon have undetectable when he finish to travel a portal. And his portal can also detect you if u are to close. So be carefull because there is some add on that give more time for undetectable stats. It can take maximum 15sec or 20 after travel a portal.
---
It wasn't you because the person was playing killer for most of the day
---
Just a bad choice in shrine and you want to make a new account? This doesn't make sense. You get the 2000 shards in a few days back. When you start new, you have to farm them back too and it's the same. But when you start new you also lose all the Bloodpoints you spend on your characters.
---
There is no reason to starts the game new again
---
Be careful, whipper snapper. That much salt will give you heart disease.
---
No you will be able to.  Serum has nothing to do with Hallowed Blight, you earn serum through the Rift. You have 59 days til the Rift ends and you can no longer earn serum once it ends. Once the Rift ends you have 2 weeks to use any leftover serum that you still have. Once this 2 week period is over you will no longer be able to use serum.
---
Wdym you didn't feel like hooking someone
---
Yeah if only there was some way to stop noed before it even pops... That would be a great nerf /s
---
or you could just play survivor normally and get rift points the same
---
but good meme locker dwight ez rift afk grind
---
It actually happened. 
---
All my friends loaded in without me. So, I was just standing there doing nothing. The killer eventually got me down and hooked. As I got hooked, 5 seconds later my game loaded up.
---
Sounds a little op, would make trapper completely useless
---
Okay but alot of what they nerfed for survivor was actually broken. Ex being old MOM old DS insta heals etc. and well i do think spirit needs tweaking alot of what the do to killer is very uneccisarry ex being how ppl mostly wanted nurses addons fixed but they also added a cool down or how pig just exists and she gets nerfed. Which is why im scared (for lack of a better term) of what they are gonna do to spirit and if its anything like op stated shes gonna be ass.
---
tell your friend to post so i can call him a crybaby too
---
Literally me yesterday, went through 5 other people before the game started got tunneled by a spirit
---
Then you should probably tell them to stay away from the killer when they see that little skull, and to break totems if they‚Äôre that bad where 1-2 die from it every game.
---
then you see that it was haunted grounds.
---
**aight imma head out**
---
Their main ability emphasizes their swing attack I think. Legion is m1 because all they do is swing and go into frenzies. Pig is m1 because she hides, waiting for the right right moment to strike! coiled like a cobra! Then she zooms forward with a Lion‚Äôs or tiger‚Äôs growl just to take a swing. Sure pig has reverse bear traps but... cmon! How often does that actually prove useful? Not enough to deny she‚Äôs an m1 killer! Ghost face is m1 because he hides and stalks to activate exposed effect on one survivor (aka ‚Äúyou go down in one hit‚Äù effect). It does wear off overtime however, and has a circle around whoever is exposed by ghostface on the bottom left of the screen. Myers is ghostface but he doesn‚Äôt hide, he just stalks, and gains exposed effect on anyone he hits until it wears off.
---
I could be wrong though about what an m1 killer is.
---
Oh fuck, you‚Äôre right! But it still takes 20 minutes to find games lol.
---
His range is enough to break loops if he can do it fluidly. His core problem is that he can't. He has to switch modes twice to cast it. And I didn't say remove range add-ons, just reign them in from sniper doc range. Balance requires adjustments. I think that's what they're going to do and when he moves up killer ranks maybe you'll remember this post. Until then this is all speculation. Look at reviews of doc from pros "If there was charge speed add-ons they would be his best"
---
How toxicity is born!
---
When did I ever imply that? Was just explaining what the post meant.
---
 whenever I'm high I just like throwing hatches.
---
Just tired of this sub's stupid people, that's it. Try to state an opinion and get downvoted to hell, while they can't understand even the most basic of jokes, albeit bad, but it's still pretty clear. Seems like noone here actually use their damn heads.
---
There's only 5 on each map.
---
No such thing as mystery boxes or loot boxes in dead by daylight for cosmetics. 
---
The licensed content is always (so far anyway) purchasable with auric cells only which are purchased from the store.
---
Oh
---
It was multiple bad choices, and I could get more shards if I restarted bc each lower levels need less experience
---
The only way to get it is to buy it sadly. That's the downside to licensed outfits
---
Hex: connection lost
---
I usually only plaued killed but not gonna lie didnt even know they were a thing till way later.
---
So you pay 10EU for the ST DLC and then you need to pay AGAIN for an outfit, I mean the price is absurd.
---
The lowest kill rate at rank 1 even while excluding games with disconnects was 55%. Most recently Peanits said killers start at around 60% kill rate averaged across all ranks (with disconnects). Plague had a 70-something % kill rate on Coal Tower, was one stat, I think. And again, according to those stats, she is at least 55-60% overall now. That doesn't mean I think all killers are actually "overpowered", I do think a fair few of them could totally do with a buff or two, but for general gameplay, they also are not anywhere near "crippled". They kill 2 or more survivors more often than survivors 2 or more escape against them. I think Freddy is actually the most deadly killer in the game right now, statistically, and he was obviously buffed to be there. And good killer players win the vast majority of their matches with any character, regularly pretty decisively.
---
I don't really want to go into a conceptual argument about whether Nurse's ability is broken. If you know a really good Nurse player, and see that they win 99% of their matches, tournaments included, you might be inclined to change your mind.
---
Fair enough about the "#1 spot" logic. But I really don't think Billy will ever be there. I do think Nurse is still #1, and Spirit will still be above Billy too. I don't think (and don't want) it to be a "rework" of Spirit either. No more collision would go a long way to make her a more engaging design already, not least because it makes grabs less easy to pull off. Some of her add-ons can be toned down. And maybe she should not be able to hear quite as well as she does, while phasing; her ability is supposed to be about predicting, guessing, mindgaming, yet both collision and audio-tracking contradict that design, where there's no guesswork involved whatsoever if you can literally feel or hear exactly where the survivor is. I would go as far as saying that without collision and precise audio-tracking, she could even have baseline Beads. The vaulting animation from the PTB would be cool to have. In turn, her passive phasing should be more of an actual chase tool - the killer player should be able to see when these passive phases happen, to be able to make use of them deliberately.
---
jason will never be in dbd just stop it get some help :)
---
yeah i think removing counterplay from your game could be considered as changing up gameplay if we're talking about the spirit
---
You're not alone I did too.
---
This is why you always check the icon instead.
---
Btw, if you're currently wearing the newest Steve outfit we might've played together just now. Against a Huntress on Shelter Woods lol.
---
Yeah but stabbing is much more fun
---
you could always just not get the outfi. I didn't even buy the chapter, the perks don't interest me
---
Dont worry BBQ was there 3 weeks ago and just came back.
---
Jokes are fun and funny, I'll take it.
---
That's why it says he is stuck in "lawsuit hell".
---
I love you. That really made me feel better. Probably the same people who only rant about killers tunneling them, or about toxic survivors. We all just wanna enjoy this game, why make people feel bad about ideas they set into their mind?
---
If someone's missing 8 blinks in a row they're bad at Nurse so that scenario is irrelevant. 
---
The 7 seconds you're talking about? Doesn't matter if you're good with her. If you use 4 blinks to down a survivor, the 2nd 3.5 sec cooldown is negated by you carrying a survivor to a hook anyway. 
---
If someone has close games because of a few seconds on Nurse i suggest they play her some more.
---
I will say this, the cooldown feels clunky and is annoying but nothing more really, just an annoyance.
---
Naw everyone knows him from the movies but i feel like people haven‚Äôt watched any of his movies...
---
This is what I'm talking about!
---
Yes, but they also give less shards and the exp/shard on each level is very close together. You can read this in the wiki
---
and I dont care
---
is there any clue what this changes will be?
---
Her traps are a RNG based power, and something based on random chance will be very hard to balance. Maybe make it so every one spawns with helmets, but pig can't  see the boxes aura, because she can just camp and patrol those super easy. Even with this change, she can, it's just harder, and a bit of memory
---
i wanna say it's fake but it's right in line with bhvr completely raping a killer instead of just making a few adjustments to make them have fairer counterplay
---
Because of balance. Flashlights are "higher skill" items, and they give a large reward when used properly so they should have a large downside when misused. Giving a flashlight a guaranteed killer blind (even one) would make them really strong
---
Horrible play by you. Get good.
---
I started playing without it on any killer, got to r1 without it, and still play without it. You can do just fine without game slowing perks at any rank. Yes, it's harder, but for me it's more fun.
---
I picture it like they will be slow moving and make rubbery sounds, I should‚Äôve added that to the description
---
its fake, it was made by an user, probably a survivor
---
Kinda hope it's this just so we can mori the hell out of him.
---
I can save folks inside basements with borrowed time? And it still... works?
---
Short rant: It gets tiresome waiting for a long queue as Killer and obviously Survivor is the fastest way to en route to grinding. But hey, don't judge folks too hard if they want to do silly things if they're bored.
---
Jokes aside, I genuinely don't think *any* killer as of right now should receive the Legion treatment. I admit that Spirit is a tad overtuned right now and should be slightly tweaked to give survivors more breathing room (Prayer Beads for instance), but having powerful killers is a good thing. It fits the killer fantasy of being the power role, and it's healthy for the game, so that people won't be forced to only run perks like Ruin. Nerf her, but let her be playable.
---
\*cries on clown\*
---
You're thinking of it as math. It's more like game volume, well, because it is. Iron Will turns the cries down 100%, Stridor turns that back up 50%, leaving the volume at 50%. Yes, Iron Will is technically 0% volume, and 50% of 0 is still 0. It's not referring to the volume of survivors running Iron Will though, but the standard volume of those without, making that 50% actually 50% volume. 
---
As a side note, No Mither gives you that extra 50% reduction to counter Stridor.
---
Ptobably fake. Survivors love shitting on killers
---
Yeah "spelling"... Right... You must be a Man of great culture
---
Also I bought unbreakable thinking it was the only good perk Bill had, but borrowed time is really good and why would I grind bill for one perk when I could grind for 2?
---
They posted a gif today that looked like a sword rack with a missing sword and they responded with ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs missing‚Äù
---
Imagine thinking dbd rank system is competitive
---
Yeah, if it is true, there would be no point in playing her. Instead of making her fair, this change just makes unfun coin flip a problem for a killer and not for a survivor. But the difference is that survivors cannot choose what killer is in the match, while killers can. So, bb spirit, I'm not playing you anymore. Gonna find another killer to farm 32k bps in every match.
---
papa Yamaoka new killer and youger Rin new survivor
---
I'm a fan of Stranger Things so I was happy to get the DLC for 4EU, like the perks but just sell outfits for real money that's just not it. Thanks anyway for your reply.
---
How you gonna do neas face like that üòîshe's already struggling as it is in the face department
---
Yes, but Stridor vs Iron Will has nothing to do with that, it's an issue with **game mechanics**. Iron Will makes you go completely silent while injured, and 50% of 0 is still 0, so I see no reason why Stridor should make Iron Will obsolete.
---
Hopefully you called them a turbo virgin after the game
---
Would anybody really want to play as her father though? I mean yeah she's a killer but as far as her backstory I'm sure most people are compassionate about it and wouldn't really want to play as him.
---
If you haven't, here's the explanation:
---
Basically, there was a Jane that was unhooking another survivor. Then she was disconnected and it was definitely not a rage quit nor intentional.
---
Or by an average dbd developer who loves acid.
---
Something in the background music or ambiance is similar. It's been like that forever.
---
I hear it in my first couple marches every time as well as after I play against her or with her. 
---
It's super annoying, but also I kinda like it.
---
This happened to me after using balance landing and everyone thought I was hacking
---
No it should work just damaging it normally, guessing its a glitch
---
Fun from spirit? It's same as with legion. Instead of making killer fun and fair for survivors, they make it unfun and unfair for killers.
---
I've played solo for almost a year now, and I've rarely seen a survivor who is explicitly toxic to another survivor. I've probably run in to under 5 in over 600 hours playing the game. I'm currently playing at purple and red ranks.
---
Generally troll teammates or toxic teammates will reach no higher than about green rank because they don't care for pips so I'd say you're less likely to run into them now, but you still can even at rank 1 of course
---
Get duked on
---
It seems survivors of toxic whenever they're winning I've yet to run into a team that got the best of me that just left without clicking flashlights or waiting at the gate till the end game is literally ready to expire. At least two of the four survivors will be toxic that is at least my experience as a killer Main
---
is it the one you need Brutal Strength for?
---
Can we start having posts of gameplay clips, questions, discussion etc.. and stop with the shitty memes?
---
What if Spirit is the killer explored in the next rift? Like with the tome pages and cinematic
---
I... suppose that makes sense, but I still stand by what I said. Maybe it's because I'm a math person, maybe it's because it just makes sense that way, but I do genuinely believe Iron Will shouldn't be affected by Stridor. Hell, it's as simple as re-wording it as "Your grunts of pain are **completely silent**", keeping the flavor of Stridor while making the mechanics more intuitive.
---
The cosmetic is licensed from Netflix, so it makes sense that it would cost money.
---
Not if they have sprint burst B) I was last alive and ran scratched mirror for 10 minutes, I could see both entrances on the gens I tried to do and he dosen't get bloodlust in tire 1.
---
It‚Äôs decent but not as good as ds, dead hard, balanced, iron will, adrenaline (depending on if you play in a squad), unbreakable, etc
---
yup, once foun the hach and was thinking about to close it, and then imidetly a claudet jumps in front of me making me jump m1 him
---
Didn't say there was a problem with juking the killer I'm just saying most survivors look like they're going spastic trying to juke me and it literally is just debilitating too watch. And I've yet too play a match where survivors try to bunch up once they see that I'm legion. The always scatter and start doing gens solo, at least the good teams do, I do get a few moronic teams that pair up in two's either being ignorant or just really stupid not knowing legion comes with discordance.
---
Wasn't it always missing?
---
Thank God. Only good thing she added to the game was haunted grounds.
---
Okay this was fun
---
Just had a Spirit with NOED who Ragequit after the Gens were done even tho NOED would have activated...
---
I've made some folks near pee themselves running my zero terror radius, zero phantom stealth teleporting hag though.   
---
As well as with the far less effective perma tier one jump scare myers.
---
This just makes spirit a bad wraith so it probably just fake
---
I love it when you are going through a pallet, not even knowing a survivor is there and a survivor slams you with a pallet.
---
This outfit should be free for those who own PAYDAY: The Heist or PAYDAY 2. This model or outfit has been available ever since.
---
And I'm surprised this hasn't been added in yet. At least hoping one day...
---
Imagine being this sensitive, jfc. Get a fucking grip.
---
I‚Äôve had that too it‚Äôs the funniest thing to have happen
---
I think the Brutal Strength one is a combination of 5 pallets and gens.
---
Touche
---
I can‚Äôt recall, but there are two in the trailer at least
---
Good lord how? Not being mean or anything that‚Äôs just really impressive to me.
---
Freudian slip, op wants some dick
---
I think each killer has their place. Its just some killers are more heavily punished when they are lower level. Some need perks more than others.
---
It‚Äôs as it says, damage the same generator by kicking it twice at different points in the same trial. If you DC you lose any progress for the current challenge you‚Äôre trying.
---
Dead Ringer's the ^FUCK OUT
---
When does the next level of the tome/rift/whateverthefuckit'scalled come out?
---
Nope, it was just a banner with the text ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù on it
---
They felt bad for you or they were playing a game of chicken.
---
I bought at least 8 tiers
---
I hope he wont be a killer tbh
---
It's the spirits weapon
---
I have ALWAYS wanted to accomplish this!
---
Spirits dad is on his way to nerf his daughter
---
Lol yea I should‚Äôve
---
Wat does Bming mean
---
This looks very good! I like your style a lot!
---
It means you have to damage the gen, wait for someone to start working on it again, and then damage it again.
---
I don't know if you'd get the progress if you backed out, but please don't just go in for your own benefit and ruin the game for the others that loaded in by dc'ing.
---
People are selling dbd related merchandise all over the place, even advertising on their official forums and discord....  I'm pretty certain they're ok with it - especially something like this where you've completely made it your own. Get them posters out! Hehe
---
On Wednesday
---
THESE ARE SO AMAZING do you have an Instagram or something ? Your art is absolutely wicked and I love it üíï
---
ive been watching this the whole day and i cannot stop can anyone please tell me there is a longer version somewhere ive been looking for it for so long
---
Clown is in the same group as Legion: boring, but not worthless in chase.
---
Just massively increase the consumption rate while blinding or burning. That way people will be able to use flashlights for communication and searching for traps, instead of saving every charge for the perfect killer blind opportunity.
---
When I reach red ranks I am constantly getting left to die on first hook. My teammates dont even bother while I'm flailing my arms. They continue to do gems. Its not every game but more often than not sadly. I run Deliverance but you cant use it if you're the first one hooked.
---
Unfortantly Valve probably wont budge, Bill being in the No Mercy heist was just a little in joke.
---
I doubt Valve will ever approve additional outfits for bill due to his original being so iconic.
---
Its a fun perk, useful on m1 killers. SO much faster on recovery. Surprises people, and can't be cleansed off the field.
---
They already confirmed on Q&amp;A stream that she's on the rework list for being statistically overperforming, you absolute toothpaste balloon.
---
Sweden doesn't mean anything. It is just a code name so we don't know what it really is. They had one with other places before now.
---
Bad Manners, its when survivors tbag just to tilt the killer, or killers nod when they down a survivor. in this case this feng was just making me wait the whole EGC just because she wanted to be mean, then im guessing she went for the hatch not realizing that i closed it, and then died to EGC :) felt really good :)
---
Could you share them ? I wanna be sure
---
Yep a sword is missing! I checked a recent video of someone playing on Yamaoka Estate and both swords were there, and now the bottom sword is gone
---
I disagree with you both, plague is reduced to an M1 killer if survivors don't cleanse but having everyone be a one-hit down all the time is still a big edge and can lead to a lot of success if you know what you're doing. 
---
She has a steep learning curve but she's not some trash killer like people sometimes think.
---
Facts
---
They're not terrible maps as far as balance for survivor/killer. It's just that those maps are awful for certain killers, and any semblance of balance as far as map design goes.
---
Use rancor
---
She has the third sword , but there are two others
---
The 5 stages of grief.
---
Stage 1 - Denial.
---
I don't think you understand what I meant so I'll just reiterate. The discussion I'm bringing up is on whether you would like to see the Demogorgon have an SCP-096 skin. That's it. He functions exactly the same except now he looks like SCP-096.
---
I mean, you still can, the game has a lot of sound queues/effects.
---
Major props to anyone who does still play Killer with colorblindness like that, it looks like it would be a nightmare.
---
About damn time
---
it cant be true, basically reduces spirit to under old freddy's tier. Just shit. 2,5 seconds its almost the time required to break a pallet, which means that the every time spirit uses her power its like break a pallet. Not to mentions the others. I do think some of her nerfs are in that list though. Probably the colision one and the prayer beads.
---
sel√ßie
---
The plot thiccccens
---
Huntress better get a mini gun that's shoots hatches.
---
There's your issue. Console. It's not the same on console as it is on PC. You can trap it all you want. That just gives me more time to leave the loop, and now you've lost me, the chase, bloodlust, and a whole lot of time. You're not some god that breaks the physics of the game, you're just grasping at straws. The god loops are busted, and no amount of, (I CAN DO IT, MY DAD OWNS DBD) will change this.
---
Yeah i have inst but i dont upload my sketches.If you want you can follow.My inst: w8stoftime
---
So we have the right to complains because no one play without belt  ? 
---
Thats good nerf tho , if someone brings an ultra rare addon or offering , they cant bring anything more to the trial with it
---
Either DS or adrenaline. An exhaustion perk is pretty much a must have. Self care is nice when you're playing with randoms. I would just try experimenting with different perks.
---
Really awesome ! 
---
No plot spoilers on the cover tho! üò§üò§
---
Thanks for the honesty, what‚Äôs the price for one tier?
---
I hope that leads to a re-negotiation with Texas chainsaw massacre as well.  The Sawyer house and its surrounding property would be gorgeous at sunrise.
---
Thank youüñ§I appreciate that

Oh for sure. I'm all about the non-directional lullaby, and the lullaby defeats the purpose of even having the oblivious debuff from Freddy, for sure. But this doesn't change how dumb some of the god loops are still.

I've done this because I was sick of running a plunderers build and then dying

Laurie looks amazing here, well done ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You can literally say the same thing about losing to the survivor that got caught after the gens were fixed.
---
1 tier is 100 auric cells. and no problem :)
---
I‚Äôm killer main and have had no issues before noticing this
---
I think developers must make Laurie more cute in gameüñ§
---
Because we are anonymous have no way of physical hurting each other can talk to everyone in the world at once and then add a splash of human nature

*insert Billy standing still, running in air, he looks down, then proceeds to look back up, gives a small wave to you, then screams as he falls*
---
next killer name = sweden
---
nea is swedish
---
the killer is actually nea, we were right
---
Yea that makes it a little better tbh. It seems like an ok idea, but if the survivors get tied they are fricked lmao
---
I wish there was a full video. This looks like a random little clip :(
---
BT is a good perk, but I personally don't play with it often. But you can wait and buy borrowed time out of the shrine too so you never have to level him.
---
Yes you are right, but it has nothing to do with the argument that you waist your already levelled characters for NOTHING. Because then you reset to Level 1, you get fast to level 20. But you get much less shards for it. Read the Wiki, there is just not a single benefit for a reset. Maybe you feel better, but objectively it's worse
---
Yep, it‚Äôs rare but it still happens
---
From one killer to another, you‚Äôll get the next ones. It‚Äôs not a big deal. Killers have so many game changing perks and add-ons, I think survivors using a rare key every once in a while isnt a big thing.
---
Lmao this is great
---
Pretty fair
---
I personally prefer premonition. I would rather know the general location of the killer than just know he‚Äôs looking in my direction
---
it is on her default one only. i just did it in kyf
---
Dumbass Claudette cleansing instantly on autohaven is what is OP.
---
false, Jason uses a bush machete not a bolo machete and the metal mask looks nothing like a hockey mask
---
if you get an item from a chest and then die you keep it...
---
I don't get why they don't do this, or just put in an option to change the aura colors. Witcher 3 added a colorblind option for the Witcher senses pretty quickly because it was just a toggle to recolor the clues.
---
A Dwight jumped through a pallet and just disappeared. I turn around and he is looking at me.
---
They all look super adorable ;-;
---
Imagine writing a fucking novel because some dude hit control on his keyboard a few times.
---
Can't wait for Piggy
---
Yeah, I don't know why people are suddenly on this "plague op" train. In [this data](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/) that Behaviour released, she's the only killer in the bottom 3 killers on every platform. She is literally the worst killer right now according to the official statistics. I don't want to accuse people of being "entitled survivors" but come on. You can't mind game with her because she's too tall and you can't use half of her power because no one ever cleanses. If people think that's op then they really are entitled.
---
Bloodlust is fine, because it's designed to beat this specific thing. But if you're going to have an amazing loop like that on one map, and a "counter" mechanic that barely works for this 1 specific instance. Either you add a god loop to ALL of the maps, or you just cut it down a bit. ^OR add a second entrance nearby that ALLOWS a mindgame. Not just one continuous loop that's hard for a killer to break without bloodlust. 
---
I'm not mad about loops and the balance/counters therein. I'm annoyed at how long it takes to break these loops even WITH the correct counters in place.
---
Thank youüñ§
---
I've thought about this too, it may be a problem with how the menus work or something but I do agree on how this should be a feature. There are times when I'm in a SWF group, and we kinda have to sit there in que and accidentally open the archives out if habit and stop the que. It does get annoying, it kinda forces you to just sit there while waiting for a game. I hope this does become a feature soon, it would be a good quality of life change.
---
I've had this bug before, I didn't have any exhaustion perks except for adrenaline but we only done 2 gens. I got hit while vaulting a pallet and I just start going really fast
---
It stands to reason you don‚Äôt understand how this game actually works
---
The new hair does her some justice! But she has quite a lot of personality I‚Äôd say
---
im just in love with it and ghostface is such a mood
---
It‚Äôs definitely fake, posted not even two hours ago
---
I feel personally attacked
---
You might get it off instantly or have to search every box, and its even harder depending on the map or box spawn locations, so with some addons, if you get downed, helmeted, a gen pops, you get hooked, unhooked, start timer, you cant make it to every box, especially if the pig is near any of them at any point in time, and you will die if you don't get it off on the first 3 tries
---
Making cr1tikal proud
---
1) It's relatively easy to land unwinded Hutchets so lats take Hillbilli and Bubba treatment here.  
---
2) There must be some clue **before** getting hit by instadown.  
---
3) Let's be honest, they would take Infantry Belt anyway.
---
TIL I may have deuteranopia because I was only able to see the notification close to her hand with filter E
---
Can't see anything in BC and it's really hard in the other images
---
How do I enable a filter on windows?
---
YOU ARE AMAZING!  You captured the retro perfectly! I get like I'm looking at an old comic book cover everytime.
---
I'm really hoping we get a villain from The Grudge. Kayako Saeki would be AWESOME. Imagine a seeing her crawl around the map, making that creaking noise.
---
I have to rely on sound so a good pair of head phones is the best thing for me as my vision when it comes to tracking blood trails on red mixed in the the colours green/yellow are really hard to see for me virtually non existent I hope they add something so I can change the colour of the trails
---
Survivors problem with spirit isn't how strong she is, it's the fact that any "jukes" you can attempt against a spirit are 100% a guessing game which isn't fun. You aren't given any actual information to try and counteract what's she's doing. 
---
I personally consider billy to be a slightly stronger killer than spirit (depending on the addons) but he's also the most fun killer to go against imo.
---
Boomers beware, the selfies are coming for you
---
You‚Äôre right, let‚Äôs make every single killer restricted to M1 no power
---
You're not the only one. Mines the same. Even my friends have that problem sometimes. I'd say its because of the engine and extra stuff on the menu cause of the event
---
Fun fact: NOED use to not be a hex perk. They probably forgot.
---
I'm tier 42 rn I've got one last Halloween skin to get
---
I personally never go against Plague at all, I genuinely can't remember the last time I did. However shes my main killer, and maybe I'm just not annoying or toxic, but people are generally very sweet in the post game lobby. I dont think Plague is OP at all, I think shes a strong killer if used correctly but I think shes very balanced.
---
Urban evading nea ew
---
Overrated show
---
Does Reshade work in DbD? Or does that trigger the anti cheat system?
---
I've seen this complaint for years and they still haven't done anything.
---
I run head on not to use in chase, but to just smash the killer out of nowhere to scare them
---
Infantry belt takes up add-on slot. Now they can take faster windup time
---
FR, killer is sort of relaxing against normal survivors, but I still scream my head off when I drop from somewhere and just stare right into Myers.
---
See it does to an extent... But the problem is you shouldn't have to take up a perk slot just to allow you to overcome a disability that would be easily fixable if the game developers would just put in a colorblind mode like most other games. That perk slot could go to so many other better perks.
---
When does it start to get better? I'm at rank 13 killer and my lobbies are still 10-15 minutes. Most of the games are over in less than 4.
---
&gt; It's not that Spirit "changes up the gameplay," it's that she has no counterplay. (Despite what Tru3 would have you to believe, throwing down pallets while she is phasing isn't counterplay.)
---
Yeah. He only has multiple videos of himself beating Spirit. But that doesn‚Äôt count because that Spirit was bad for not getting a 4K in 3 minutes.
---
Nah,I haven't played in like 2 days and I don't even have steve lmao
---
Someone‚Äôs mad. Take whatever you need to calm down, rephrase your thoughts, and try again, bud.
---
If that's the case, he wouldn't have played in a very long time
---
Not a fan, it's two nerfs and the buff wouldn't really help since the nerds are in place. Huntress takes time to charge the hatchet, then has aura shown to everyone inside of your terror radius and has reduced movement speed while she has one ready. Maybe instead of buffind the amount you can carry to "removes movement speed penalty while charging a hatchet" could work though the aura reading is pretty strong by itself.
---
When you use object of obsession. Make sure to do not look in the direction of the killer look the wall i dont know and you can do a 360 with ur camera for see where the killer so you can hide far away from the killer. With sole survivor. It will make un undetectable by the killer for each allie die. Iys give you 24 metter for every survivor. So its work very well with object of obsession. If ur the last one because you were running away from the killer before he chase you. You can check where is the killer 24h without be detected. It give you a major advantage versus the killer. With decisive strike. You can prevent tunneling killer and it will make you the obsession. Laurie strode is everytime the obsession. Because every perk she have give a chance to be the obsession and it give you 1500 point if you escape and 1000 point if you died when the obsession and it give you a little advantage when you are the obsession with if you play every perk of laurie strode. Its good for solo survivor play laurie strode
---
There was a glitch right when demo came out that the end game collapse time didnt update graphically on survivor clients. I had this happen to me once, got this info directly from bhvr support.
---
- Hitting a survivor is toxic.
---
- Hooking a survivor is toxic.
---
- Not walking to a corner of the map after hooking a survivor is toxic.
---
- Damaging a generator is toxic.
---
- Breaking a pallet is toxic.
---
- Avoiding a flashlight beam is toxic.
---
- Looking at a survivor is toxic.
---
- Protecting your Hex totem is toxic.
---
- Not opening up the doors for survivors is toxic.
---
- Closing the hatch is toxic.
---
- Loading into the game as killer is toxic.

Survivors are babies and cry about everything. They will even cry about this post, because they are babies.
---
You're forgetting David and the Huntress, also both free.
---
Adam?
---
Then why show a clip from Spirit‚Äôs trailer? I‚Äôd love Jack to be added but I don‚Äôt see the correlation.
---
"Time for my ultimate move!"
---
*disconnect*
---
So.....What perks did she have?
---
I like how they all look so cutesy, but huntress looks like she‚Äôs done with everyone‚Äôs shit. She about to bring iri head and an ebony lol
---
Imagine doing a gen near a window and she crawls out of that window.
---
Because why would they show what killer it is on the first teaser lol ‚Äúsomething is missing‚Äù literally correlates to the father in the shining getting the axe off the wall and the shot of it not being there anymore
---
As someone who owns and tried to collect the old DC horror comics and so on, Good Job! Looks pretty close to the real thing. Keep up the Nice Work!!   (I'd read it if you ever publish)

Lol that was me on Halloween day getting ready to go out dressed as devil face
---
They‚Äôre included in that. Dwight, Meg, Claudette, Jake and David. Trapper, Billy, Wraith and Huntress. There‚Äôs also Bill but I didn‚Äôt include him.
---
She just cosplay Mayers xD
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm trying to refine each time to try get closer and closer to a genuine piece :)
---
Easiest solution I found was to half the Resolution. GPU cuts down to about 50-55, which still seems unusually high.
---
Gotta love the famous DBD optimization
---
OK BOOMER.
---
Nah I‚Äôm kidding, you make a valid point, I actually casually looked back into their twitter and I couldn‚Äôt find a case of them teasing something like this, however I still think it‚Äôs unlikely they would tease a new killer with an old killers trailer.
---
Seems more likely to me that this is directly related to a spirit change, but I suppose we shall see.
---
Yeah, maybe instead of requiring a full charge it could require a headshot?
---
Keys are rare and used very sparingly, the points they get for that escape will be minimal to so I wouldn't sweat it pal
---
Fair point, but I don't think this 0.35 seconds (from 3 to 2.65) would do so much different.
---
Wow, how long did you have to play each day to get to that rank? I work and go to school so it looks like if I commit 2 hours a day I should be able to finish the event a couple of days before the end.
---
I always look for keys in lobby now. I used to forget to look. If I see them I switch to FD. That is one think killer mains need to do. You get to see what they are bringing. See 4 toolboxes? Put on perks to slow down gens. I've been using GF on 3 or 4 tool box games. They really want to use them. So I stalk them and hit them with FD. I find being killer is more fun when I change out perks. If I lose its because what I brought. If I win. It's because I read and reacted.  Basically what I'm saying is before a match starts look at who and what they are bringing.
---
Hey it's been a while since I played, I think the last time I have played this game was in the lunar revel event with the wolf mask for the huntress. I am getting back into it and being a killer main wanted some advice. I love the spooky stealthy jumpscare killers such as ghostface, the pig, and the hag, but am unsure of who I want to main. Ghostface is super fun so far and I'm leaning towards him, but I struggle with him. Is there any advice I can get on how to play him or what perks I should go for?
---
I mean, I'd rather see Hazbin Hotel memes than another Otz Dickride meme.
---
And I'm not saying that as an Otz hater. Since I discovered him he's been in my top 3 DBD streamers. I just fear that the Subreddit is putting him up on a pedestal and won't be able to handle finding out he shits like the rest of us.
---
Hey look it's me
---
Legacy Steve pls.
---
i would prefer it only insta downing at a distance, so then only actually good huntresses can use it properly instead of just face fucking you with an insta down
---
Still trying to get wraith adept fuck me its hard
---
oh yea that way. Well thats why the timer wont go off as soon as the game starts. you have to make your choice; do the gen or get the trap off before the timer starts
---
Sometimes. For freddy I see it more as he needed to relearn how the place works and it took time till he became efficient enough to kill
---
Iron will doesn't completely silence you,it reduces your grunts from injuries by %100,and Stridor increases it by %50.Since killer perk comes first,it equals down to %50,basically T1 Iron Will.
---
In game, on Yamaoakas Estate, there were two katanas above the Oni mask. Now there is only one in game. Like I said, I‚Äôd love Jack, but they wouldn‚Äôt delete a piece of a map for no reason.
---
Those exist already.
---
It‚Äôs not like the game has a monthly subscription like a lot of other online games that are updated constantly. $10 isn‚Äôt much ti ask for especially when it‚Äôs an optional cosmetic
---
It‚Äôs from a trailer not the actual map tho I am not aware if they actually have deleted an EXTRA sword because one wasn‚Äôt already there

I can post multiple videos where I survive against Spirit, too. Does that mean I countered her? No. It means she kept fucking up in chases because she's bad at phasing, or I kept guessing right (because the Spirit was predictable. So she was bad.)
---
They have, check the twitter replies right now, people posted screenshots of it currently and it in the past.

Had a group of survivors knock my two hooks when I brought the petal. Not a good time . These  guys either bring out the best or worst in people.

Bro. Have you ever been ambushed by a pallet?? That shits scary af and loud too

So if she can dwayne johnson a body with a lift in DbD, then chucky can have super throw

That's okay to not laugh at a joke... but telling someone you think something isn't funny when their only intention is to make people happy, and phrase it like an insult, that's kind of mean to me.
---
Hmmm I really can‚Äôt see them expanding on a killers more beyond times and stuff cuz that‚Äôs special treatment for the spirit of so I will acknowledge this but still stick to my guns
---
This would be really cool as a print
---
As long as you aren't being toxic about it, I don't see a problem. For example, don't face camp and don't tunnel someone just because they t-bagged or looped you. As long as as you use it as a strategy rather than toxicity, there shouldn't be any issue.
---
Would be mine too but I'm gay :/

---
Spirit's motive is that she wishes a chance to get revenge on her father for butchering her mother and herself. The Entity likely promised to give this chance in exchange she kills and sacrifices others. The entity will probably never actually give her what she wants so that way she stays enraged and continues killing for it.
---
Tritanopia during endgame collapse...
---
Wow thats stupid
---
Oh my God, the entitlement has started.
---
Imagine complaining about having to play differently instead of doing the same thing over and over again. Lmao
---
The entity makes all the killers have insane strength to be able to carry survivors.
---
Calm down there Satan
---
Seriously, the amount of times I've rounded a corner on the way to a gen and a Meg crushes my dumbass skull with a pallet. I usually end up losing the game because I'm very susceptible to jumpscares and I have to take a minute to calm down after it happens.

;(

I never intentionally give up on struggle phase. I'm just in my 30s and have arthritis. Tough for me to mash buttons repeatedly for the entire duration. I changed struggle to the mouse wheel and still sometimes miss it.

---
I've literally never used Ruin. It's such a crutch perk and I'd rather have something like Devour Hope or Blood Warden
---
He got the hook points lol you literally only screwed yourself
---
I doubt they‚Äôd ever do it. A lot of people wanna play on both so they buy the dlc and cosmetics on both
---
Fair enough. Just wanting to provide the current evidence and a possible argument.
---
*Most* red rank teams are actually just casual players and they lose to all killers at varied rates. It‚Äôs actually quite infrequent to find even a relatively well coordinated swf at red ranks in my experience.
---
This is huge fax
---
Is there an agreed-upon way to communicate you're giving someone the hatch? Everyone keeps running from me ;_;
---
This is fucking rad!
---
I actually wonder what would be a good power for Jason phasing like the spirit is the only thing I can think of and that powers already taken.
---
At least bubba was nice enough to help
---
I would love to have my Dwight's hoodie and sweatpants bloody.
---
There we go...give Chucky insane throwing strength. This is what I said last month in a thread before and everyone just erupted on how that cant work lol
---
RIP my man Bill. The best survivor
---
Put the green bottle in add on and keep the bag. They will step in your trap for sure. They are the color of the ground. Put them on you hex and let them step in you trap. They will never see you trap on a pallet when you are in chase
---
Aw :(
---
And his mori would be funny too, he can turn you around and punch you unconscious and do his voodoo magic
---
The waifus
---
Can I frame ur list and hang it above my dining room table
---
Oh, God! Oh, fuck!
---
Regardless. It does too much for 1 perk. I understand it was made during the early times of the game but it is just too powerful. I'd just change the health state off of the hook. It's the only thing that breaks it imo.
---
The "something's missing" is obviously meant to be an exciting teaser though
---
That one I didn't miss, thankfully!
---
Pussy
---
Wow Huntress looks really bored down there
---
Good nurse players are still going to be really good with her. The rework doesn't make her bad in any way, she just takes a bit more skill to be as effective with.
---
Haha,but Rin is mine,sorry
---
That's a stupid idea
---
How
---
You can give him throwing strength but not accuracy plus he's way too small and would be overpowered on maps with a lot of grass because he is shorter than the grass, that's why he wouldn't work
---
I understand it tho, plague is boring to play against and is like clown, chases are horrid against her, but the lack of map pressure makes 2 gens pop every hook.
---
Its just Mayers cosplay
---
I usually down them and try to carry them to the hatch. If they keep wigglin, they die
---
Eh jan is like forever away üòÇ
---
No such thing as a bad killer. She's still good, but in her own ways. All they really did was balance her ability.
---
That seems to be the typical wait time for that range of ranks, at least I always wait 10-15 minutes for lobbies even in the evenings
---
That‚Äôs the point, people think tome 2 means level 2, as in tomorrow
---
Generally you knock them down and pick them up and hunt for the hatch. If they wiggle, kill them.
---
In all honesty that had to be on your end or something Else. Dedicated servers are rather new and didn‚Äôt exist at that point. If you played killer then you would be the one hosting every match
---
why
---
You're a piece of shit
---
Do we have any idea when the next chapter of the tome will be unlocked?
---
Or better yet, Insidious hiding above it and dropping down on top of you.
---
I still haven‚Äôt found a lobby so I‚Äôm at about the 30 minute mark now. If it takes this long to find a lobby at low ranks I don‚Äôt see how the devs expect new players to stick around.
---
Because there is no real reward after the third prestige
---
Accuracy can be given no problem. I was thinking maybe a red stain that is bigger for him or make him have to lunge at you like the pig you 3 times for a down.
---
&gt;No such thing as a bad killer
---
Can't compare Nurse to Freddy and the pig.
---
Where does she sit in the current meta? Is she still at the top with hillbilly or did she just drop harder than a bag of shit?
---
Am I missing something here?
---
ok? so why should claud only get one? and why for one of the worst perks in the game?
---
I did post the bread by daylight thing before, all I did here was remove the background and change the text white, I can still post it though if you want

Imagine being so bad at survivor the everyday objects you see kill you

---
Here is mine, for comparison:
---
[GTX 1060 - 6GB 1600x900 - High Settings - Usage](https://i.imgur.com/qsO4wEF.jpg)
---
My usage can be found in the second line, "CORE". 60% would be my usage while 70% in the same line would be total power (watts). 
---
My resolution is lower so it is to be expected a reduced GPU demand to deliver the same 60 FPS. I would say it is pretty much on par with yours.
---
Ghost faces best addons by far are the ones that reduce the cooldown of his power, even the common one. Tracking perks like whispers and discordance help a lot so you can sneak up on people as much as possible.
---
Try not chase a single person for too long, otherwise you‚Äôre not taking advantage of your power too much. If I‚Äôm caught, I usually try to get a few pallets out of people until my power comes back
---
I legit made a reddit account for the first time ever because of how freaking ignorant you are. You are so vastly ignorant that it pushed me into making an account just to tell you how freaking ignorant you are. Now to be constructive.   
---
Legit all the shit you are talking about only works on trash spirit players, and don't give me that "I play red rank spirits" bs either. I play red rank spirits as well and you can get trash spirits at red ranks just like you can get trash survivors at red ranks. The color of your rank really does not reflect skill. It reflects time played. That's about it.   
---
Spirit is one of the most ignorant and oppressive killers to play against. All you really need to be a good spirit is some game sense, a headset and know when to take your hands off your keyboard.   
---
I find playing against competent spirits to be a shit show. Pretty much once you're injured you're done unless they have music cranked up, are deaf and partially blind.   
---
Even playing as spirit is no fun. Most of the time it's just a fucking slaughter.   
---
I really wish you would put your boner for the dead Asian girl away and look at her objectively and not just go by the accounts you have had with trash spirit players and come to a reasonable conclusion.   
---
P.S. Taking your hands off your keyboard is not a sick mind game.

I believe he means that your endgame results should start cycling through as you're being sacrificed
---
What is your point exactly?
---
I watched a streamer do this last night. They had the wrong items on, switched them off, put the offering up, and the game started before they could get their items on.
---
RIP.
---
Her father is coming to play too
---
I did all the challenges ontop of the bonus it gave for playing on the day and past it was supposed to originally drop. If you run extra bp perks they also boost the xp you get once you complete the challenges
---
Eh... nah. Tbh I would hate a shy guy skin.
---
what a scumbag you are. dcing when youre gonna get hooked.
---
(You forgot Smol Billy)
---
I shouldn't have to explain
---
Just hit great skillchecks and ruin is nothing
---
Just to be clear, I DCed because I got tunneled. I just wanted to show this small bit after I DCed because I thought it looked cool.
---
So they nerf Nurse, now Spirit? What's the point of playing killer tbh lmao
---
I think the buff small game needs is a bloodpoint bonus in the boldness category.
---
People seem to be confused by the wording of the serum description. Just search by new and see how many people think it‚Äôs going away tomorrow with level 2 of the archives
---
 Well next Killer comes with a Map Rework so maybe its  Yamaoka Estate?
---
Thats how i feel more and more with dbd period sometimes. Gotta love the famous DBD *insert thing programming wise here*
---
*gotta go fast*
---
As a Jake main, this is too adorable. I love it!!
---
I trapped the window to make you abandon it, dude. That was my plan if I realize you‚Äôre just gonna play loops around me. Also I run brutal strength for a reason so I‚Äôm removing a pallet from the equation, again forcing you to run away, just as planned. I‚Äôll eat all the pallets so there‚Äôs none left and only the windows I trapped early into the match.
---
You're unable to do a competitive match for a duration of time. I believe it's 10 mins/30 mins/ 2 hours/ 24 hours/ 1 week. In this case you could still play kill your friends, but not actual matches.
---
God I wish it showed the selfie in the end game screen
---
I use every killer, so I'm not really sure where everyone is on the tier list.
---
Ouch my feels
---
So, nurse is less good than spirit but other than that better than every other killer. Also it seems as though you haven't played in a while, Freddy was reworked and is now the best m1 killer in the game. (Not sarcastic he really is)
---
I assume that the missed blinks won't be as easy to correct if you have a cooldown on them.
---
That can always be improved though.
---
The thing I'm concerned about is the telegraphing of her blinks. I heard that other survivors can see where you are going to teleport before actually getting there? Is this true?If so,I imagine Nurse is not as good as she was before,even with a high skill cap.I don't think any amount of mechanical skill is going to compensate for  the telegraphing of her attacks,am I right?
---
I got that in a hate msg once.
---
I actually made a post about something like that and everyone called me an idiot because they like to DC
---
Either his ruin or how he found someone that fast
---
Good. Have big hatch gf now.
---
Meanwhile they are the ones who lost
---
I haven't played since summer and I actually laughed when I read that thing about Freddy.
---
I did play when Spirit was in the game but still found Nurse to be better due to her ability to end chases.
---
Is Spirit better now though?
---
Why? U want a 100% chance so the killer can‚Äôt touch em?
---
Dead hard, decisive strike, spine chill, and I forgot the forth one
---
I need to ve rank twenty just to play killer
---
i dont think that survivors can see your destination but im not sure
---
Bill is one of my favorite video game characters of all time. He is the embodiment of badass
---
To those bitching in the comments that it doesn‚Äôt matter Marth is currently doing hardcore dbd killer challenge where it‚Äôs a fresh account and he has to go from rank 20 to rank 1, if anyone escapes on a killer he has to stop playing them until he‚Äôs out of lives/killers and every thing is fresh with no perks
---
So while a normal dc game like this is annoying it‚Äôs especially annoying because it means he deranks and is another pip away from possibly loosing the challenge.
---
Shits real fishy when spine chill wont even work lol
---
This is nasty, holy shit. BHVR SPY are you listening?! This is what greatness sounds like. Too bad its legion, here's to hoping the rework is bomb.
---
Her blinks were given a more sever punishment and she no longer has easy access to extra blink add-ons.
---
Overall she the very top anymore but is still a candidate for top 5 along with Billy, Spirit, Freddy, and mayyyybe Hag.
---
How much speed do you get for the bloodlust 1,2,3
---
Obviously he plays other games like apex legends and overwatch where you can also get cosmetics from loot/mystery boxes. Being openminded doesnt hurt ya know?
---
I mean... Those two perks are interesting, but their side effects seem a little bit too broken and not practical at all.
---
i love how people honestly argue that IRI heads take skill. i had a huntress last night bring an ebony mori and exhaust addons bc me and some friends where using exclusives, they got 2 kills and talked shit in after game chat.
---
Got them again next game, They brought IRI heads and only got one kill... ggez
---
I like that. Personally I always like to run devour hope over ruin, but for some reason it gets destroyed even faster.
---
Exactly
---
Those too
---
Eh, I play this game to shit my pants lol.
---
Scratched mirror Myers, Stalky boi GF, even Trapper are hilarious to play against.
---
Then again, I'm not very good and I generally play with a SWF to have fun, not beat up killers
---
What principle? That you need some effort for the achievements?
---
No. Mainly because I like playing Claudette and adding legacy to newer characters doesn't seem right to me
---
Iri heads are fair, without infantry belt tbh
---
I‚Äôd be ok if they just made it so iri heads lock your hatchet count to 1
---
You are missing the point.
---
It's not counterplay to guess right vs a spirit. It's a dice roll in the Spirits favor. If she keeps losing the dice roll, it's because she's bad and predictable.
---
I have no clue why you don't want more counterplay for survivors. *She doesn't even have a fault animation.*
---
https://youtu.be/UAQnuW8iNm4 Here you go!
---
Waiting for The entity to say fuck it and let the Legion spread terror as a group.
---
There are no visual cues for auditory alerts for deaf people in this game too. Lack of accessibility affects too many of us.
---
When getting a 4K is the only way to stay at rank 1 or a 3k to pip once in purple ranks no matter how hard of a game it was for you it‚Äôs an understandable desire for killers I think the ranking system for the killer side but idk exactly how to change it
---
My point is he said Freddy got nerfed when he actually got buffed. That‚Äôs all. I said nothing about spirit bud, you good? 
---
Also you have absolutely no fucking idea what they are reworking on spirit so people need to chill the fuck out. They are probably just making it noticeable that she‚Äôs phasing and reworking prayer beads.
---
Any reason?
---
I'd love to have her, but she's too similar to Spirit. I'd replace Spirit with The Grudge any day of the week though
---
i know..... im talking about the 100s of comments from people wanting him in the game with different skins
---
Good point, I kinda wanted to make it so you still had to pay a price for being selfish/spiteful towards the killer, hence some of the downsides. I‚Äôll adjust it when I get the chance. The blind is like a basic flashlight, as I don‚Äôt know what the differences are for flashlights and stuff like that, also, the blind is not affected by the perk level.
---
Do you have the teachables for the basic killers?
---
I'm usually ok with my mouse unless it's really cold that day. Struggle state is a big reason why I predominantly play killer
---
These are super pretty! Especially that Claudette. &lt;3
---
Huntress is looking depressed, like she just ran out of hatchets or something.
---
I have to ask, r u trolling? Yesterday u said pretty much the exact same comments about wraith
---
Hillbilly and Nurse are still top tier, and Freddy is high-mid tier. Spirit will most likely be pushed down to Hillbilly's level
---
I agree! Tbh I was mostly curious if it helps at all, since I don't know too much about colorblindness.
---
Lol a teaser for Spirit nerds, perhaps. Imagine if that's actually the case.
---
I'm more annoyed at the people comparing Jason to Trapper tho
---
Yasss
---
This is the best post I've ever seen on this subreddit.
---
üôÑ I wish they wouldnt.. I love her.
---
Glad to hear. I'm excited to see how everything will look like in the end, and congratulations on doing all this survivor prototype, it's actually really good. Do you have any ideas on how The survivor would look like?
---
"I think weve done a pretty good job so far"
---
Exactly. I hate when people are blindly optimistic. ALWAYS expect to be disappointed, and you'll be much happier.
---
no..
---
Micheal doesn't think like we do. He doesn't make a decision to kill people, its instinct. Normal people however choose to kill.
---
My head canon is that the entity gives bill an infinite cigarette because he‚Äôs a veteran
---
Why is not cleansing against plague a meme? I'm a rank 3 survivor and I legit don't get it. Every game I've played where no one cleanses we get demolished like we were all 1hit and coughing loudly at all times or something. And every time everyone cleanses the game goes well and escape is a possibility.
---
So this is rocket league now. You queue and get put in a game to replace a DC ^/s
---
November 13th according to the ingame News tab.
---
I just don‚Äôt think it would fit
---
bruh... that‚Äôs deep.
---
I suggest trying bbq, monitor and abuse, hex ruin, and nurses calling.
---
I edited my response comment to mention more stuff. Check it out real quick.
---
Tru3talent fans will tell you not to stalk. They're idiots; if you can spend 2-4 seconds to cut your chase time *in half*, of course you should do that. However, the advice does have merit insofar as that you're better off not *focusing on stalking*. Think of stealth as his primary ability, and just use stalking opportunistically when you get the chance; 99 it when you're at a distance, and even if you get broken out of stealth, just keep that in your back pocket for the next time you have an easy hit on them‚Äîturning that easy hit into an easy down.
---
That said, the SB + NC + Thana build Tru has popularized definitely works well, whether you're stalking or not. His best addons are recovery speed, followed by stalking speed; most of his other addons aren't really worth running. In particular, his red video tape addon doesn't really make you stronger, in my experience; it's more like a challenge addon, if you want to challenge yourself by focusing on stalking while leaning only.
---
Try BBQ, PGTW, surveillance and make your choice
---
Use bbq and surveillance for intel
---
Pop is for killing generators and
---
Make your choice for pressure
---
As a Doc main, here's a good rule of thumb: if it's been more than two minutes and there's a Meg on your team, all the pallets are fake now.
---
Is it normal to be using 80-90% of my GPU when on Ultra Settings? There is no bottlenecking or FPS Drops, and the temperatures are fine. I just don‚Äôt want this game to be hurting my Graphics Card. In most casual games I usually play on Low/Medium to keep my GPU under 60%
---
I don‚Äôt know how they would appear, but the names should give you 4 separate people in your head. I‚Äôll try to decide what they look like later.
---
The issue is if you‚Äôre rank 1 nurse, you‚Äôre not really rank 15 clown. You‚Äôll unfairly match with people well outside your skill as you move around killers. To be fair though, you‚Äôll probably get out of that trench very quickly.
---
üîçSomething's Missing...
---
Good work. I love dbd so much and enjoy killer but playing on any of the field levels kills me since I'm red/green colorblind. Slid I didn't have a really good headset to hear people I'd really struggle on those maps.
---
Can I get consent to boop the pigs snoot
---
Survivor(s) spawned on Ruin.  Happens all the time
---
I'm tempted to try this for a few matches haha
---
I understand dcing cause it‚Äôs a killer you dislike but because you got tunneled now that‚Äôs just sad
---
It‚Äôs a gamble of how safe you feel. If you think you can dodge the puke, then cleanse so you aren‚Äôt one shot. If you are confident with looping her, (how most people feel) then don‚Äôt cleanse until the end of the game to ensure you can pull off an endgame save.
---
Okay thank you. It‚Äôs mostly on the dirt maps like coldwind that it‚Äôs impossible to tell.
---
I know what his saying lol he thinks it should be around 50% ish, it was a joke üòÉ
---
Her not realizing the hatch was closed or waiting you to leave the door is not bm'ing.
---
Just playing around with it now, I was able to balance out 60-70% GPU usage with 50% Resolution on Ultra. Still looks nice and doesn‚Äôt make my laptop periodically loud. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not too pleased with the Graphical Demands of DBD. I can run Devik May Cry 5 on High and still only using 80-85%, and that thing has special effects up the ass.
---
Not a very good joke
---
The problem isn't mediocre/bad killers. The problem is the games design from the start. Games like identity V do a tremendously good job making sure there are tons and tons of opportunities  for killers to outsmarts survivors and vice versa. This game just has killers who are weak. Why is doctor weak? His power does nothing to help in a chase really, and he has no way to apply map pressure. All killers should have two things. 
---
A) Help them in chases
---
B)Apply map pressure.
---
Most killers do none of these things. Freddy was reworked to have these two things. He can put traps down to help him catch survivors and he can teleport to gens to keep pressure high. Demogorgan has a power to help him chase down people. And portals to get around the map. Funny thing about identity V is even if a killer doesn't have the strongest way to apply map pressure, they have a secondary power they can choose from to fulfill that purpose. So technically all killers in their game can apply map pressure and there have powers to help them chase people down.
---
Then they have do ask Does it feel fun? Is there plenty of chances to outplay? 
---
And also survivors just need way more ways to interact with killer. Or outsmart him.
---
Bro chill you got quick and quiet
---
And the bloodpoints right üòúüòÑ
---
Freddy and myers are amazing
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound too bad tbh. While the survivor‚Äôs main goal in this instance is to spite the killer for a lack of better terms due to the survivor‚Äôs story, it would actually be more beneficial to the survivor than the killer if their scratch marks stayed that long, as the killer would begin one very long chase just to have it slap them in the face when the chase actually kicks in due to no scratchmarks mid chase. I‚Äôll adjust it when I get the chance.
---
TrU3Ta1ent just debunked Scott‚Äôs vid u should go see it if he explains something properly.
---
With how rarely I see huntress running this add on it doesn‚Äôt really need changes imo.
---
More like 16%, 20%, and 24%.
---
Legion is a good pick if you're playing because you like chasing people. Myers has great perks, Spirit is currently the most powerful killer in the whole game, and Freddy recent got buffed up the ass
---
It‚Äôs part of it, but you‚Äôd also have a larger pool of similarly ranked players so you wouldn‚Äôt get as wide of a spread between ranks in matches.
---
Who gives a crap if PC players will be slightly higher rank than console players? I‚Äôd guess they‚Äôre probably better players on average anyways.
---
Well the wast majority dont. Kinda lame to play against someone with no real counterplay
---
Oh that works? I've never thought of doing that.
---
Yarp -- love startling people with the stealth killers.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say viable, but more of a usable perk. Luck only affects the chance of unhooking yourself, It does not affect loot chance. If they made luck do that, it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad perk to run while plundering
---
They're assholes, were waiting at the gates to teabag and gloat, and got carried away.
---
0/10, no Cyka Blyat!
---
I wouldnt call you a d but, kinda? I used to despise closed in maps, still warming up to Hawkins I'm honest! But survivor side, it takes longer than other maps but you learn to adapt to them. Not just that but if I load into Lerrys and somebody DC's more or less straight away, it just helps me dislike that map and others like it a lot easier purely because it puts the team at an immediate disadvantage.
---
Killer side, you're rekt. Anticipate with wall hax perks/add-ons but other than that, gg.
---
You had your chance James ;)

---
I just got to rank 10 and I want to know if any of the strategies change at all in these higher levels?
---
An insta-win button for noob Killers who don't know how to play, but want to pretend they "won" no matter how badly the Survivors outplayed them. It's the ultimate blatantly unfair OP crutch perk, worse than pre-rework Nurse and Prayer Beads Spirit combined. I actually have more respect for lag switchers than Killers who run NOED, because at least the lag switchers have to be honest with themselves about what they're doing.
---
This comment will get downvoted into oblivion by butthurt shitty killers who can't score a kill without NOED and like to whine and cry "jUsT dO bOnEs" every time they're criticized, but that doesn't make it any less true. I actually tested out just how OP NOED is last night by playing Nurse‚Äîthe slowest killer‚Äîusing NO blinking, NO addons, NO perks‚Äîexcept NOED. Then I went AFK for the *entire match*, until NOED triggered. It took me about 15 seconds to get a 4K, and I was barely even trying.
---
If BHVR wants to nerf something, NOED should be at the top of the list.
---
Lewd but approved
---
I disagree, she has plenty of counters! I feel like when the Meta doesnt work against someone that's when I see the most complaints.
---
It'd encourage me to DC, shorter queue times!

She doesn‚Äòt look like the actor, but atill looks good, not gonna mention quentin here

You've already put in the work, a simple email could make this some good income for you. If not, then no harm no foul.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
To answer some common questions:
---
&gt; "Are you / when are you going to do X killer?"
---
Yes, I'm planning to do all of them, including Demogorgan and whoever else gets revealed. I don't have them planned out in terms of when I'm doing which killer - just kinda of letting it happen.
---
&gt; "Are you going to do the survivors?"
---
No. I did Dwight because he's my boy (and I wanted to do a pizzagram), but generally speaking the survivors aren't as visually interesting and they don't have the sort of strong iconography that makes doing the killers engaging from a design perspective. Oh, and also I'm shit at doing faces (as you can see with my Dwight). And no technology exists capable of making colors bright enough to accurately depict like 98% of Min's outfits. 
---
&gt; "Can I use this design for a tattoo?"
---
My stance on tattoo design is to contact me via DM and we can hash out the details but, generally, yeah, I'm cool with that.
---
&gt; What equipment/apps do you use?
---
Most of the work is done in Procreate on an ipad / apple pencil combo with some occasional photoshop involved. 
---
&gt; What else do you work on?
---
Quite a bit - I'm also working on hashing out a [Fallout series](https://i.imgur.com/OjxZuoT.jpg) similar to this one, working on two seperate sets of tarot cards (one based on my [own designs](https://i.imgur.com/kwbBgl2.jpg) and one based on [hiphop / rap artists](https://i.imgur.com/Fky8eva.jpg)), regularly doing pieces based on Ari Aster's films [Hereditary](https://i.imgur.com/bm1gcmO.jpg) and [Midsommar](https://i.imgur.com/Vf5PIhP.jpg), and I'm also a [nightscape photographer](https://www.instagram.com/davecarender/)... so I stay busy. 
---
&gt; Are you making stickers / prints?
---
Yes. The plan is to do both once the series is finished - stay tuned, or check my IG for the latest about it. 
---
More of my work can be found on my IG at: [@gopencyprep](https://www.instagram.com/gopencyprep/) give it a follow.

He was talking about the the original Freddy. A week or so after he was first released low skilled survivor mains whined that he was not "fun to play against", kept DCing against him, and the devs did to him what they did to Legion and that's nerfed him into the ground without thought or reason. For two years Freddy was the worse killer in the game because of that shit. They beated around the bush about buffing him before saying that they made a "mistake" in listening to said survivor mains and nerfing him in the first place and promised us they were going to completely rework him. Fast forward to five months ago and they reworked him to a great killer now. But that shit took two years.
---
Phantompain23 was precisely correct in what went down. Freddy who was nowhere as strong as the Spirit was STILL got complaints from low skilled survivor mains. Those same survivor mains then BROKE THE RULES OF THE GAME constantly by DCing and the devs, rather than punish the rule breakers, destroyed the killer to appease the rule breakers. No decent game company worth it's salt would ever do something as stupid as these devs did and punish the killer rather than ban the rule breakers. You can't get more incompetent than that.
---
They listened to said moronic low skilled survivor mains because they themselves are moronic low skilled survivor mains, and Freddy stayed in his fucked over state for two years until they took their thumbs out of their asses and fixed their original mistake.
---
They just did the same damn thing to the Legion that they did to Freddy to years ago - nerfed a killer into the ground because of low skilled survivor mains whining. And now the same people want to try their luck a third time with a third killer the Spirit. After the Spirit they'll move on to complaining about a fourth killer. They'll never stop because their aim to make sure that no killer will be able to outplay them consistently through skill. They want 13 Wraiths in the game.
---
Spirit mains have every right to not want what was done to Freddy/Legion done to her, and there is no reason to trust that the devs are in any way capable or competent enough to go about things in a timely or logical manner. If the Spirit is Freddied/Legioned she won't sniff red rank viability again until 2021, just like Legion won't sniff red rank viability until late 2020/early 2021 since their past history is that they take two years to fix their own killer screwups.
---
Someone who decides not to drink again while driving doesn't deserve a pat on the back or a "benefit of the doubt" since they already fucked up before and thus has prior behavior to go on. The person that deserves the pat on the back if the person that never did it to begin with. Behavior has gutted a killer TWICE after a DC spree. Twice, not once. And they JUST lied about "only" "reworking" the Nurse's addons before hitting her with three separate nerfs to her base ability. Or did amnesia suddenly become contagious?
---
You would have to be a complete moron to believe that BHVR would not go ham on the Spirit's base AND her addons. No, no killer main should trust BHVR when comes to "balance changing" their favorite killer. They are the epitome of incompetence, overreaching, and illogical balance choices.
---
Hex perks are always hit or miss. Sometimes they never find it, while other times it's gone in 30 seconds
---
True to the source material
---
No shit. He is obviously new and he notices they have cosmetics in this game. He wants to find out ways to get them. In all of the games he has played there were lootboxes to get cosmetics. So he assumes they would have it here too. Hence him asking the question
---
How do you know that they‚Äôre the Myers?
---
People start to play more optimally. You‚Äôll see less survivors running out in the open like headless chickens and more cocky survivors who are confident in looping. 
---
You‚Äôll see the killer cast wane a bit outside of one-tricks or ‚Äúdoing a daily‚Äù perk meta is pretty solidified for killers it‚Äôll be rare to see a deviation from Bbq/Ruin/PGTW. Survivors just run the same 3-4 second chance perks cause why not?

If you go under windows settings and under display or personalization a tab named color has the colorblind filters and I use the one for red green colorblindness cause I can't see auras and scratchmarks for shit on certain maps

The perk was OP but god they shouldn‚Äôt have nerfed it into the ground.
---
I am red green colorblind,  I think this is awesome. Can you please make a version showing off the scratch marks so I can show friends how bad it is for me?

If they pull another Legion I‚Äôm gonna be pissed

Gimme that png BlessRNG
---
Ah yes, sneaky and fast, that sounds about right. I knew he wanted to be my friend.
---
She wouldn't play the same at all though. The only similarity is her appearance. The reason for that is evil spirits are described as having ghostly-white skin, in Japanese culture. In the case of all the most famous Japanese horror films, the source of the villain's power is rooted in the Shinto belief that those who die unclean deaths (are murdered and/or not put to rest) return as demons that torment the living. In the case of the Grudge villains, they were murdered by their husband/father, just like Spirit. In The Ring, Samara is actually an evil little girl with telepathic powers, but she got murdered by her mother; which again, is why she has the same aesthetic.

I see you re-uploaded the video and cut out the part where you rage quit as you got hooked because people were criticizing you

I have the outline for the story and characters for everything

It‚Äôs the execution I‚Äôm afraid of, hell Im working on a cover for it now but it‚Äôs hard to come up with one.

This works for this style, but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm going for, so coming up with a cover (personally) is really difficult.

But this work is a damn inspiration I‚Äôll say that

At least you helped the trapper get out. Hope he had some mercy and didn‚Äôt hook you lol.

What's the harm in that? I just wanted to show this, but people were focusing on the part where I DCed

I like empathy. It shows vital information about people at a further distance than bond, it also shows when people need healing and when I need to save people (E.G pallet, flashlight)
---
I always consider that a way of saying thank you, bit like ye olde englands curtsy! Notice say Claudette in a skirt doing it, looks genuine!
---
Not trying to be a dick. Literally asking. How they not cannon? If the entity can pull whoever it wants from wherever it wants couldn't that mean he could have gotten them to?
---
I love these, really nice artsyle and cohesion between them
---
Wait. Does that mean the Ghostface model is carrying the camera the entire game. I don't know why, but I love that.
---
When me and my friends play in bp tourneys  we always play low tier killers as they reward the 32k easier, but the kills were harder. Whenever people were mad it was the funniest shit.
---
I know :(((
---
I love Spirit. I don't want her to get ruined like Nurse (who was already unusable on console).
---
They‚Äôve been getting better, take Steve for example
---
https://youtu.be/KLJBeD6PthU
---
I still think upping it even a little bit more would make it a more used perk. Especially when deliverance is 100% chance after one unhook.
---
That's exactly what this is.
---
Found out that she hasn't been changed but will definitely be changed soon probably next chapter
---
*ight imma head on
---
Well how about a Head hatchet add-on that DISCONNECT the survivor from the game when they are hit by it.
---
"Window of opportunity" ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
So Iridescent Head?
---
agreed
---
she can move through walls and levels of buildings at ease, with a short often unnoticeable cooldown.  she‚Äôs S+ tier and still the best killer in the game.
---
A good amount of the community will say that it is kinda dumb that the killer and do nothing and get a free insta down is dumb and it is while the other part will say just to cleanse totems and yes while that would prevent it there are problems with that 
---
1.totems are not the main objectives of survivors generators are
---
2.you don‚Äôt even know if the killer will have noed (frosty eye killer tend to have it a lot though)
---
The game isn't that bad for billies and hawkins is insane for him. By bad maps do u mean lery's?
---
Well, how about a another mushroom add-on that completely screws with the colors and graphic textures of dead by daylight.
---
Am i big dumb or is the oni mask missing as well as the sword?
---
Edit: never mind, just the sword is missing in game
---
Ah right. Forgot about that, I can't remember the last time I thought of it as a a non-hex perk though
---
I haven't confirmed this, can't go into a custom game right now. I don't know *how long* it's been missing, either.
---

afterpiece tonic + hatchets
---
I have to admit when I saw this at first I thought it was a weird kids show that people liked even though it was made for kids but then I saw angel Dust and realised that‚Äôs not what it is at all
---
Probably because it‚Äôs a ridiculous move.
---
Why?
---
Angel dust is probably the best character (in my opinion)
---
Dont underestimate no-stalking ghostface
---
This reminds me of the old desync issues. This has happened to me many times back then.
---
More like Psychedelic colors and hallucinations cause by mushrooms. It's like taking acid and ketamine in the same night.
---
Fucking Millenials killing the Gen Industry smh
---
Who downvotes this comment
---
I was hoping for Kayako or Samara... Smh... I don't just want a male version of Spirit...
---
It is a good ‚Äúshow‚Äù or should I say good pilot episode
---
Cant we just change noed to make it so its not a crutch perk? like at least give us a totem counter
---
This never fails to make me bust out laughing.
---
Not sure why.
---
Maybe I'm related to the doctor...?
---
The game is mediocre, but how is the Hawkins insane? There are corners everywhere, lots of single entrance loops and a lot of elevated areas. How are you supposed to use your chainsaw effectively?
---
That‚Äôs what small game should be 
---
Only at tier 3 though
---
There is nothing scarier than hearing the chase music but you dont see a survivor
---
The shards on her body already glow when she is phasing. I guess you could make that a bit brighter.
---
She's one of my favorite Killers. I'm also on console, so shes not nearly as strong as she is on PC. Shes good though, don't get me wrong. I just don't want another Nurse. Nurse was always weak on console, but now she's unusable. The fatigue shit is the worst part about her, just like Legion.
---
Yeah, I also prefer playing killer in low ranks. I hook everyone for BBQ stacks then chase them around while missing swings and running into pallet stuns. Almost every match, survivors all finish with minimum 20k BP.
---
no, small game should show auras of totems. 
---
What im saying is, survivors need to have a counter on there UI to show how many totems are left. Solo survivors are at a massive disadvantage when it comes to NOED since you never really know when all 5 are done unless you do them urself or waste your time looking for broken ones.
---
Curious as to why they‚Äôd use a shot from spirits Trailer to tease a new chapter though....
---
Ahh that's rough, nvm, it's just that the Steve was named "Bonann16" iirc so it fitted a bit too well lol.
---
It honestly has got great potential I just hope it doesn‚Äôt flop since the characters and world seem really cool but I can see this getting a toxic community which may ruin it (like ruin ruins my games)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-08iFX8ScI4
---
Every pallets unsafe, so you either hit them or break the pallet quickly.
---
No, change 1 existing legacy on another: nurse -&gt; wraith etc
---
I honestly think the Devs intended for Survivors to be cleansing as much as possible, since using all of the Fountains will clear them all and give her a Purge to use.
---
The issue is just that each Cleanse gives her a full 60 Seconds Of machine gun, and as she‚Äôs chasing you, she‚Äôll most likely be drinking more fountains nearby. Your 2 literal options are to either deal with being sick the whole game, or try to avoid a super soaker filled with pain. 
---
I just wish it was more ‚Äúfun‚Äù to go against. Corrupt Purge should be a Meter with a set amount that only drains when you vomit, so there‚Äôs at least a Counter to Looping her around stuff as she tries to hit you. You‚Äôre basically fucked for 60 seconds if she gets it, and there‚Äôs no real penalty to her missing or just wildly spraying it everywhere.
---
Nah the aura removal was needed cause that made trapper a m1 killer with no power 
---
And I‚Äôm gonna stick to my statement on how only small game tier 3 should have a totem counter 
---
(btw I noticed frosty eye killers run noed more then the average low rank killers)
---
Yeah it‚Äôs missing in the game. It‚Äôs very probable the next killer will be Mr.Yamaoka. I‚Äôm very excited about this.
---
My guess is that the trailer will be released this week, possibly tomorrow. I bet he‚Äôs gonna wear that demon mask
---
Ummm...no. Even top tier Billy's can get looped by good survivors who know how his power is used. So can Mike. In fact ghostface is the much better killer. And what ST perk is OP??? Bro what
---
Wraith viable??? Whaaat
---
Yeah cuz freddy doesn't need it if je has pop.
---
*Yawn.*
---
Gibs me The Grudge.
---
Christine killer when
---
They do actually. They have the rights to the character in the movie, not the actor playing them. That‚Äôs why most licensed chars do not look like the actor/actress. It‚Äôs close.. but no cigar. 
---
Personally his goblin looks are why I like Quentin, same with Nea.
---
I think so 100%. His sword is missing. I'm pretty bummed out though, because I really wanted The Grudge or Samara.
---
Memes must not go here ;)
---
And yes, I know what you really mean. It's just a show, if you don't like it that much, disconnect from the internet and go read a book or something I dunno.
---
There's more speculation at r/leaksbydaylight
---
On basic skin only. Most of skins cover her shards (skoolgirl, kimono, and other) or make it rly hard to see (Halloween skin, and other). It also should me more brighter yeah, and on every skin
---
Dbd Community: Nerf Spirit
---
Devs: Spirit 2.0
---
Also, I‚Äôm very excited about it possibly being Rin‚Äôs father. I don‚Äôt know why
---
Also thank you for showing me this subreddit üòÅ
---
DBD you can't keep turning a blind eye to the demands for colour blind mode, or mechanics that are hell for people with carpal-tunnel syndrome... Your game is big enough that you need to start addressing this stuff instead of churning out Rift cosmetics.
---
He's not a bad person. He had a mental breakdown after a chain of unfortunate events, and The Entity opportunistically drove him insane, to the point that he murdered his family.
---
You got a point there. Maybe they could add a new map with theme specific pallets/lockers/gens like they should‚Äôve done a long time ago
---
I don't think Trapper needs anything nerfing him. And it's already pretty easy to figure out where the totem is
---
From the OP post:
---
&gt; You cannot see trap in grass and you don't know what you have detect.
---
I mean, I doubt OP cares because making Trapper useless is literally what they want lol
---
It's definitely Rin's father. His sword is missing in the trailer. It sucks, because I was hoping for Kayako or Samara...
---
*The Entity liked that*
---
Glad I can help! I was thinking of doing a couple panels or pages myself as well ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Who cares, free blood points for you guys and this dude gets to play being invisible
---
Nope. Rick grimes? Yes.
---
Its mostly for newer players to know about them, while giving a boost to walking speed. You can use the scratch marks to determine how far back they still are appearing and you can use them to try to trick the killer.
---
Players that are more experienced generally know how long their scratch marks are around and already know how to use them. Its kind of similar to Windows of Opportunity (useful to new players, not as much to more experienced ones) but it gives you a little buff to walk speed
---
Can't wait till Ghostyboi!  Great Job!
---
He may be underrated but he's no where near the level of spirit on over all power. He gets no speed boosts and constantly slows down to reload.
---
Yes there‚Äôs a guy here who will stand in front of a exit gate and just have fun watching players be confused.
---
You say fucking trolls as in what they‚Äôre doing is bad...
---
Inside the game folders there are .png files for perks/items/addons that can be edited.
---
Thanks my guy
---
No. Maybe rick would be a better replacement for clem. Clem just doesnt give that dbd vibe ya know?
---
Skemoo, if you're listening, can we get an Evan Snaccmillan model too please?
---
Np!
---
you lose all your points and look like a fool when doing that...
---
but i do like the idea you are going for
---
I said "basically confirmed". Nothing's official yet, but you can easily connect the dots.
---
This has nothing to do with the show. Why don't you employ one of your two brain cells and integrate that fact.
---
There should be a subreddit for garbage no-content memes.
---
This sub should be about the game.
---
Case closed.
---
I strongly disagree with that.
---
Frankly that video is a mess. It‚Äôs scattered and blustery and half of it is him debating semantics. He spends more time discussing Scott‚Äôs word choice than the points he‚Äôs actually making. It really feels like he has no real argument and just can‚Äôt concede. That being said, I could be wrong. It‚Äôs almost impossible for me to understand what he‚Äôs going on about in that 50 minute video. Overall I feel like Scott had a much stronger argument
---
What‚Äôs that affect do?
---
Most maps it's fine and a good killer would probably prefer you have it over Sprint burst or dead hard. If those loops were fixed, it would be fine.
---
She was garbage on console, and now she's even worse. You can't turn fast enough after phasing and the stupid "fatigue" punishes you.
---
The Fredster for sure. He‚Äôs both fun and pretty straight forward to play. He‚Äôs got Clowns slowdown and Demo/Hags teleportation on command. Plus, he can slow the game to a halt which is obnoxious to go against but useful in high ranks.
---
I think almost everyone, including the DbD team understands that these filters are needed. I think people are forgetting though that the difficulty with fixing it is making sure non-colorblind players won't have an advantage.
---
 I'm sure most sweaty players would jump at the opportunity for something like brightly colored scratch marks in a color that contrasts most of the maps. I think it's most likely never going to be implemented for this reason since they will see it as a "Why bring down everyone for the benefit of the few" situation.
---
You mean the basic survivor build
---
Thank you!
---
That's kind of you, I'm flattered but at the moment I'm rarely playing to begin with, and then either as Killer or with my 4man swf squad, so I don't find the time to play with someone else to begin with~
---
Its a Meta perk, most red ranks rely on it to not get genrushed to hell but most overstate its importance in maintaining higher ranks
---
I‚Äôd imagine newer players are dying to the shitty struggle mechanics as much as anything.
---
But he was kinda right cuz the examples scott used were kinda bad.
---
Bans that are shorter than a couple hours won't do anything. If someone dced, they probably don't want to play dbd at all for a while. They won't even realise they've been temp-banned.
---
If you dont have bbq - leatherface. If you have already have bbq: ghostface or freddy are top tier killers. Myers and Pig next.
---
I'm talking about the fact that she basically fills Nurse's role on console, since Nurse is asinine.
---
It‚Äôs fine in like 70% of maps. However, there‚Äôs some where you can run the killer around for a very long time because hills lead into jungle gyms or other loops. In the hands of very experienced players, it‚Äôs broken.
---
The only map where it straight up sucks is Sheltered Woods. But that‚Äôs one map
---
Just feel like it‚Äôs a waste of their time and sorta mine when I‚Äôm out to play the game??
---
Do you play on console?
---
She‚Äôs so fucking cute
---
Nooooooooo
---
Please...no Spirit tome...anything but that. For both sides sake.
---
Just thought it was funny. I‚Äôve never seen it before and I‚Äôve played my fair share of games.
---
As a proper main I run Nurse's, Pop, Corrupt and Thrilling Tremors. It's pretty nasty, especially Nurse's.
---
Every last bit is just a worse streetwise, isn't it?
---
*killer uses a jigsaw piece sees that its a doctor with unnerving presence and huntress lullaby*
---
I honestly don't know why people are clamouring for Pennywise anyway - we already have a clown. We really don't need another Leatherface/Billy situation. Plus there are WAY cooler candidates to pick from (Pinhead).. but, honestly, give me more *original* killers. 
---
Or Chucky...Chucky would be hilarious
---
Yessss
---
Remember, you won't be able to use any perks. It might make things a little difficult, so don't get upset if you lose.
---
Just something to stack really lol
---
The only killer that makes you prefer a mori
---
Oof shot fired but yeah
---
Yeah let‚Äôs hope, didn‚Äôt quite blow up like I‚Äôd imagined, I‚Äôll probably repost it with a pic
---
I like when this happens. Except for when this dude and his wife chewed me out for tunneling which I never did
---
Not at all. I used to play nurse a bit and did great. I have a friend (console) who is rank one, uses controller, and is great, 4k‚Äôs all the time. She‚Äôs not bad, you just need to learn to use her
---
Here's [Stalky Ghost Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-S27H27Xy8)
---
Here's [Non-Stalky Ghost Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He-PltRCDTU).
---
Both approaches work, the question is which approach works best *for you*. Stalky Ghost Face is a bit more finesse, you need to be real careful not to get knocked out of your power, and it's very easy to end up in a bad situation. Non Stalky Ghost Face is far easier to get to grips with, is no worse off than any other killer, and you still have the option of Stalking if the situation presents itself.
---
Watch both videos, get a good handle on which style you feel you could best exploit.
---
Nah, maybe vigo, or the people that drop the journals and stuff. They were in the grasp of the entity from the beginning, so maybe
---
My Try hard build BT, DH, DS and Adrenaline
---
Troll build Head On, Diversion, DS, DS
---
I don‚Äôt have A quiet build :(
---
It‚Äôs just for fun for them and an easy win for you.
---
I have a similar clip like this but with clown
---
I didnt say anything about fun. I just think clown is more lethal than bubba and legion. Considering clown is basically just an m1 killer but with the ability to block pathings a bit making him superior to legion and bubba only really being super effective at defense
---
Second one I literally just worse streetwise
---
They will nerf her into Oblivion in this case.
---
Who's father? Lol Totally lost
---
Basically scratched mirror Myers but on steroids
---
I stan this meme
---
Interesting.
---
Thing is every time i play against or with french or spain people they never get salty. Most of the time they just leave. Russians however get mad more often than not, not just in this game, have seen the same thing in  games like rust, world of tanks, even rocket league.
---
However i didn't try to make this about race, i just found it funny how he acted like i lost when i got a perfect game and he happened to start off in russian.
---
Good old fashion  BHVR. Address the problem by ignoring it, waiting for something else to break that is worse than it.
---
Haven't encountered this, but I think it's kind of adorable :)
---
I thought the killer code name had something to do with Sweden and madness or something.
---
Isn‚Äôt it just gonna be lore for her? In the next tome?
---
I do believe it‚Äôs rins father, but it‚Äôs not 100%. Almost but not quite.
---
Well then I got tunnel way harder than you have recently. When I die on my last hook, nobody else (teammates) in the game was touched.
---
It's *generally* not a terribly complex task, at least in the Unreal Engine, especially if it's limited to *just* the auras - I can't say for sure because I don't have first-hand experience of their code base.
---
Changing the entire game palette would be overkill, but if it were just auras then it would *in theory* be easier to implement and test. Personally I'd avoid green because green is what the average eye is tuned for, but that still leaves red, blue, green, and yellow, which between them should cover *most* problems. Cyan might even work too.
---
Yeah, exactly. Why would we not want more lore?
---
Not really man. It‚Äôs a good theory but it contradicts the lore
---
It's a killer whos power doesn't help them much with stuff like loops or map pressure. Wraith is one of them along with Leatherface, Clown, Legion, Doctor, Pig, and sometimes Trapper and Plague if the survivors you're facing are really good.
---
It‚Äôs not a terrible build but self care, especially in the first, takes sooooo long. You‚Äôre better off bringing a med kit and using another perk instead. Just an opinion though!
---
They‚Äôre finally removing Spirit‚Äôs OP M1 ability thank god
---
I had a slew of terrible games with Nurse. No other Killer felt so hopeless to play as. The main contributor to her being trash is the fatigue. It's just so irritating.
---
ah,ok then
---
Yea she'd basically be a fatass version of legion lol
---
If I'm not mistaken, the order it's supposed to go in for these next balance changes is. 
---
1. Spirit balance
---
2. Doctor Add-On changes
---
3. Chainsaw Add-On changes*
---
4. Legion balance
---
*Changes apply to both Billy &amp; Bubba
---
Another note: The add-on changes may or may not include balance changes to the killer similar to what happened with Nurse.
---
I don't have a source anymore on this but
---
Oh yeah definitley, I play both but lean killer, this was just a top of the head idea, no real workshopping, I appreciate the feedback.
---
The new killer will be Rin's father, Mad Samurai. :)
---
Give it two more days for rank reset. Killer lobbies take forever in lower ranks right now.
---
they're both down they're dead already lol but the effort was appreciated
---
When the killer is being rational and smart enough to go after the weakest link, "he's a camper!"
---
"he's a tunneler!"
---
:megathink:
---
Ah yes, out of all the memorable characters in Jojo, let‚Äôs add the only Nazi with more than two lines as a ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù.
---
100% he‚Äôs all i play absolutely love him
---
Then youre just bad.
---
They said "something's missing" Im pretty sure it means they gonna talk about the spirit in the next part of the archives
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrMLMV6E4CM
---
Beautiful. If those were sketches then your full projects must be extraordinary.
---
Wow ily already
---
I know, plus I never used the Pig before, more for just playing with it than winning.
---
On point number 4. When the spirit came out me and many others always thought the entity was lying to her, especially since it fits with the archetype she represents. I never considered the entity actually gave her vengeance.
---
&gt; I have no clue why you don't want more counterplay for survivors. She doesn't even have a fault animation.
---
The game *should* favor the killer. They should just be just slightly overpowered. There are, after all, 4 survivors. You aren‚Äôt 1 v 1ing the Spirit. It‚Äôs a team effort to escape the killer.
---
I guess I‚Äôm crazy for putting forward the notion that the killer should be a challenge.
---
Just listing of the Original Contents
---
Free Survivors - 6
---
Dwight, Meg, Jake, Claudette, Nea and David
---
Free Killers - 5
---
Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse and Huntress
---
They could probably make 4 more rifts based on free characters since Claud and Evan got theirs already
---
All killers are named after countries in the files and it‚Äôs never relevant.
---
naa, codenams never are connected with the killer  NEVER.
---
I dont run nurse on freddy but CI  the Rest is the same
---
noup.
---
It's just a stupid thing to do, especially at the end of a match, when the game is already over for you. It makes no sense, why not DC earlier? Why DC then?
---
Meg....
---
She was just a bit camera shy
---
I'm still goad it's a change that they're planning!
---
I also like to take theories as fact
---
God that skins looks so good and horrifying
---
Gonna be a great lore development.
---
wait why bubba is behind her?
---
Hey, how do you turn the killer on ps4? I cant figure it out
---
t o t e m auras. it still wont be meta so who cares
---
Awe,what‚Äôs you‚Äôre build
---
Because Clown is one if the worst killers in the game while Spirit is the best
---
I‚Äôve always wanted to have a cowboy survivor, ore a 1920s researchers like from  Lovecrafts stories.
---
Because we only hate the most popular strong thing.
---
Now that we are done with nurse and spirit is nearly done we are already laying the foundation to hate on plague. After that we might freddy or ghostface, unless a few popular youtubers show us how strong demo can be when played well, then we drop everything and start hating demo.
---
Clown hate is not scheduled for the next 3 months, but we'll cycle to him eventually.
---
I would say Claudette but I don't have P 3 Claudette
---
if he hadn't dced he wouldn't of been able to get this concept thing. and it's not hurting you, its not hurting the killer, its not hurting the other survivors because he's already on third hook. so why even bother saying anything to begin with?
---
You could improve a bit with the Huntress.
---
I guess for the pig it was to make it look pretty by not hiding the eyebrow and half the eye behind the hair.
---
From up close it looks like you messed Laurie‚Äôs nose,but from far it‚Äôs fine.
---
Well I criticized alright now to show some love.
---
Really liked how you did Claudette,turned out great the glasses and eye mix-up.
---
Spirit looks great,definitely would die in the first date.
---
Loved how bored Huntress looked.
---
Great work overall.
---
Just speculation for now. Most likely just a tome story, having her father as the killer would be too good to be true but who knows.
---
No prob!
---
Teachables stay unlocked whether you prestige or not
---
You guys are wildin.
---
Tome 2 is in 2 days, it's probably just a tease that the second tome's lore will be about Rin and her family sword.
---
You‚Äôre clearly a PC player then. I got to rank 1 fine with Nurse and used her to grind BP with 0 add ons on ps4 at rank 3/4. With max sensitivity its fine, the lower fps makes it hard to see while blinking but its not too bad if you run shadowborne but the controller is not as much of a hinderance as people make out, the main problem is the fps.
---
She was still by far the best console killer, just a lot harder to use. Ive been playing switch version recently and even then shes pretty good on switch. I haven‚Äôt played with the rework yet but I imagine she‚Äôll still be good on console in the right hands.
---
Yes, and they can come up with a way for him to kill her off again? My point being that there will still only be 1 of them
---
This community has the combined IQ of -7
---
Devs literally showed us the name of Adam when he first came out and the community had no clue it was even him
---
Claudette is so adorable!
---
Yeah
---
Thank you a lot much!
---
I don‚Äôt really know? Why would it be Sweden though if he‚Äôs Asian. Could be Pennywise because of the actor, like the actor for Freddy with Freddy being England
---
Nope, I am not
---
I feel like it would be very hard to do in a tasteful way.
---
Plus the legal nonsense to go through...
---
You‚Äôve been so much help thanks, one last questions is there a killer that can help grind out ranks faster, I‚Äôd like to just do it naturally over time but still it would be nice to get some easy levels for those really good perks
---
Havent been on pc reddit in awhile but if I remember correctly you can edit your flair in the flair menu to be whatever you want like mine.
---
Sounds like the textures didn't load correctly for the lockers, doesn't happen that often but yeah, you mainly just saw the default texture used for unreal engine.
---
I've had the reverse for the past 4 games. I've been chilling at my gens and then someone runs at me to bring the T3 myres to my doorstep.
---
I rly wanna go to sleep and I might just end this argument but lets say u win and lets stop. Im rly tired of arguing about a killer what i dont even care about.
---
Replace Spine Chill with Empathy and UE for Resilience or Iron Will and it's perfect for MY tastes. 
---
As the build itself stands itself, it's very nice for games I want to avoid conflict in. However, when a game isn't going your way then you'll really feel it.
---
It is
---
:(
---
Very true i dont see it being practical at all would just be a cool concept
---
ACTIVATE STEALTH MODE
---
2nd bad, others good
---
Maybe he‚Äôs a grower.
---
Every game I've been in tonight I've had a claudette either block me from running or bring a killer directly to me
---
yeha i use bond when i solo and i use unbreakable when i am with friends
---
Wrong. Level 2 of Tome 1 is out in 2 days. It‚Äôs still about Claudette and Evan.
---
Yeah,it's just too risky.Imagine adding someone who died and the family of the person suing BHVR
---
I wish Ted Cruz was in the game
---
Not worth a trailer. Rift isnt even that popular with the community outside of the diehard fanboys
---
Just came back to the game after a long break, what are the go to survivor perks with all these new dlcs? The ones I used were decisive strike, self heal, balanced landing and urban evasion(this last I would switch with adrenaline sometimes)
---
What is the current 'meta' for survivors? I played this game a while back and it was pretty fun but I stopped playing and now might try it again. When I played people used sprint burst, self heal etc. Or is it just pick the perks that interest you?
---
Im assuming you mean ranks as in bloodweb levels, given the rest of your sentence, so correct me if im wrong.
---
Doctor and Legion give you masses of bloodpoints, but they arent good killers. Additionally, Leatherface has a teachable perk called BBQ and Chili that can give you an upward of 100% more bloodpoints at the end of the match. Its one of the most used killer perks at every rank Im pretty sure and you can use it on whoever you like once you get it.
---
I've had for the past 4, 
---
ran into hag and had meg unhook infront after I went into struggle (mori)
---
Myres T3 got me good after bill ran him into me
---
Legion and iron maiden got me, my fault that one 
---
The Doctor. Just the doctor.
---
Sorry, I'm including scratch marks when I say auras. Basically anything that "glows".
---
&gt; *Also you sound like your talking about changing the game pallet overall instead of making some colorblind toggels in the settings.*
---
No, what I said was "Changing the entire game palette would be overkill", because it *would* be overkill - most people don't have any problems with the drab palette used in the game, they have problems with the glowing stuff.
---
Sorry i still don't understand the reference? haha
---
All right, that's a fair point and I also don't think people calling you "boomer" makes any sense at all.Even now, I still don't really get why everyone is suddenly using this insult even if it makes no sense when used.But it is still kinda your fault when you made the first comment here since it's obvious people will downvote it.
---
 So anyhow, I just wish for you not jump to conclusive statement so quick, and if you intend to do that, atleast give a valid reason for it and not just a sentence since that way people would understand you.
---
No not really, not that I can think of anyways. In fact from searches on their forums, steam forums, and here on reddit, they've been asked to pretty consistently since 2016.
---
Trapper who is just a Jason clone: *"am I a joke to you"*
---
Absolutely hate the doctor
---
Wait is like 5min or less atm. You could possibly have a strict or closed NAT try to open it or restart router OR ur in brown ranks those queus always take 583years it sucks lol
---
What like a Terrorist and a 9/11 victim? Lol no, people would rightfully get pissed.
---
Typically the meta at the moment is borrowed time, DS, Adrenaline, and sprintburst/ dead hard/ Balanced landing. 
---
Borrowed time for easy hook saves
---
Adrenaline for getting everyone healed once the last gen gets finished
---
Decisive strike because its basically a get out of jail free card
---
And (Insert Exhaustion Perk here) because they're all good in their own ways.
---
I would love to get some of these as posters.
---
I should say i don't condone this but this is why so many survivors rage quit tbh.
---
I doubt Daddy Yamaoka would have the same power as Rin. Given the backstory he'd likely have a more brutal, rage based power.
---
The only new survivor perk that is even somewhat meta is Inner Strength from Nancy.
---
Fun perks would be Head On from Jane and maybe Deliverance from Adam.
---
‚ÄúPerk is broken and it sucks‚Äù ‚Äújust don‚Äôt use the perk 4head!‚Äù Seriously? That‚Äôs a lot like saying ‚Äúsounds are broken again, just don‚Äôt use sounds!‚Äù If shits broken it‚Äôs not unfair to want it fixed
---
You're fine. That build is still very good and the only real thing I would switch out is self care for either inner strength for faster (albeit more situational) healing or borrowed time for riskier hook saves.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, killers are just as toxic.
---
Its sound effect files for the next DLC but OP ain't to bright and thinks its nea related
---
Don't set any goal, have fun and before you know it, ranking up will be as effortless as it gets. Don't grind for ranks because they don't mean anything, just try to lose your fear of the killer and have an active play style rather than stealth.
---
Excellent, thank you very much!
---
So there's something hidden in the gif. I paused the gif to pull up to old spirit teaser and when I went back to the gif 3 japanese symbols appeared in a gray box like a subtitle scrolling downwards, like the Japanese lettering on the wall. Like a dummy I clicked on the gif again and it went away. Not sure how I got it to come up......
---
Interesting post. Thank you!
---
Oh I already use legion a lot and I have leather face too so that should be easy to do thanks again!
---
Okay that sounds good. Thank you :)
---
Happy to help!
---
You‚Äôre obsessed with hazbin hotel
---
He getting ready for a suprise backstab.
---
Definitely just play for fun. The moment you start caring about your rank the game just becomes frustrating. These days it just feels like a task for me to play the game because instead of enjoying it I'm constantly trying to outdo myself. But in a game like this there's only so much you can do by yourself
---
To be fair it's the only theory with an ounce of thought behind it
---
Just because The Entity took Rin because of her rage doesn‚Äôt mean Mr. Yamaoka was left behind.
---
Like how a lot of people want Jack the Ripper? Me too pal. Me too
---
Not even a little if a killer moris everyone on one hook he still depips but a survivor could be losing but still escape and pip as long as they had some altruism or evader. Like a mori you still have to chase, down, hook then they have to be saved then you have to find and possibly chase and down again to do it that wastes time which could result in losing. A key on the other hand, you find hatch push one button and leave. Then you have cases like killer finds hatch closes it starts patrolling gates and survivor finds a key opens hatch and leaves, but if one survivor goes unhooked by the killer he cant get moried but no you‚Äôre right its the same thing.
---
Why not have his girlfriend Tiffany in her human form as a killer and Chucky can be incorporated into her power or something? Could help get rid of the whole too small to carry survivors issue.
---
Rins lore is only good because it's super fucked up and graphic.
---
Any other lore would be "rin had a bad day at school" unless they make up even more dark shit but the devs weirdly arent into making dark themed killers
---
Yeah, level up Leatherface first and get his perk if you don't already, it'll help you out a lot
---
has to be in custom game mode if i‚Äôm not mistaken. hold x and move the curser around
---
Your bias is showing

Yo lemme get that Godzilla killer *and* survivor.
---
Oh, ok. Thank you!
---
*1Insert toxic nea moan here*
---
I dunno man, they seem pretty damn common. I get a key in every bloodweb and when I‚Äôm killer theres a key in every other match. Not to mention the fact that plunderers is almost guaranteed to give you a key in one of the three boxes that spawn by default.
---
I'm pretty sure he's talking about a serial killer and one of their victims and I'm sure you understood that also. Obviously you're example would be a bad one.
---
I actually enjoy this play style, setting goals for myself, improving and ranking up. I find games to be kind of pointless when there‚Äôs not a little bit of a competitive edge. 
---
It‚Äôs definitely not for everyone but it‚Äôs the most fun for me.
---
You can get 2 pieces right now, unless you‚Äôre trying for full costumes
---
Okay but can you dispute anything I just said?
---
My Freddy build is Franklin's, nurses, remember me, and BBQ.
---
Rank 1-2 as well. Freddy doesn't need ruin or pop IMO
---
Looks like a shadow to me.

I seriously don't wanna think about what Ted Bundy's Mori would be....

I thought adept plague was easy, i got it the first day i had her

I remember I was really high the first time I watched that movie, it was one helluva ride.
