Okay man lol
---
---
---
The worst thing is that the devs rarely listen to the players even when they've pointed out these issues so many times.
---

---
No communication, no acknowledgement, downplaying the issue like they are unimportant, acting like it's the players' issue instead of owning up their mistakes.
---
These are not how you build loyal players.
---
This! And his add-ons are mostly useless as well, since most of them have to do with survivors interacting with a portal.
---
It's on mobile already?
---
I‚Äôve sadly only seen one other Steve
---
Hope you have a good night sir. Really nice talking to you. Good luck in DBD!
---
Hit the rescuer.
---
I like the shred status effect idea. That could be great.
---
It‚Äôs like getting healed with we‚Äôll make it after a hook. does it really need a nerf?
---
Which half* are you?
---
Yea I the add one seemed just ok, honestly I thought they were kinda just ok. They should maybe have one that gives a notification when a survivor starts working on a portal instead of the purple one just making it take longer.
---
Seriously is this a joke? The perk only shaves off **one second** of time per level, for a maximum of **2 seconds less** to heal with level 3 Inner Strength as opposed to level 1?
---
It's not that it doesn't help but... **two seconds?** I think Inner Strength should work on a token system, so you can store more heals with the perk at a higher level. Something like a maximum of 1/2/3 tokens based on perk level would be good I think.

---
No I‚Äôm using the beta in Finland even though I‚Äôm not there
---
I'm not 100% but I don't think it counts as dying state until you're on the ground, at least from what it looks like. The status bar shows dying state though...so...bug?
---
&gt;/sarcasm
---
The joke is that the perk is piss poor at higher levels. 1 second of saved time is a joke. Should just be 8 seconds at all ranks and work on a charge-based system.
---
lmao i keep getting cucks using the Pied Piper offering like as if Badham doesn't show up enough on it's own.

(that's actually one of the best artwork i've seen of huntress, good job)
---
people will just out of the blue just message you hate mail. I'm on PS4 and and get stuff like that all the time from killers and survivors, but even in game behavior can be toxic.
---
And that is good?
---
Fuck, that was god level plays, but I feel kinda bad for the huntress
---
I don‚Äôt get offended. It‚Äôs just slightly irritating. Especially if they do it at the gate/hatch and waste my time instead of just leaving.
---
I paid 10 bucks for the hand puppet. Best choice.
---
Like I said in my literal first comment, pictures get passed around and reposted like crazy. 
---
Not everyone wants to reverse image search a meme whenever they want to post something. tough shit but thats the truth. 
---
And I won't ever bother unless someone tries to pawn it off as their own.
---
4k win? sorry beginner here
---
This. Also never EVER struggle on the killer‚Äôs shoulder if hatch is open.
---
4 kills my friend

If you‚Äôre afraid to play a video because you‚Äôre worried about getting bullied online by a bunch of knobs, you need to get thicker skin.
---
It's the full console version running on mobile hardware from 2015. For what it is, it's quite impressive and there will most likely be a day 1 patch. Wish some people would stop trying to shit on the Switch port for no reason
---
As someone less familiar with the game I thought this was toxic until I realized one of the perks was No Mither
---
I don't think poping a gen is necessary. Just make it so i don't get punished because mrs blendette is a whore

Honestly it‚Äôs totally up to the killer if they want to farm. To many times have I had survivors throw the game because they wanted to farm. If can‚Äôt get a killer to farm within the first 5 minutes of the game, you practically lost the game for your friends.  We have no reason to be upset with anyone but ourselves for even trying.
---
Damn I really need to get the ruin teachable. I just despise playing hag. Probably just gonna boost her from spirit bloodpoints.
---
Redraw it to Dwight chasing legion in order to proc "antitunnel" perk
---
With the mobile app you can message someone much quicker
---
**Cause I know these points will be brought up**
---
* yes i can close the hatch if i know where it is if i dont it can take just as long to find it as i would have to wait for the survivor to find it
---
* yes i have a chance to kill the survivor going for the hatch but any smart survivor wont go for this vrs killers they know can one shot them so they basically are unkillable even if u find them
---
* yes I can just chase them out the map yes I can IF i know where they are if i dont its a race to find them and chase them or find hatch and close it then chase them out of the exit gate all a waste of time if  I cant one shot them
---
* the most common response will be just afk if you dont like it its only two minutes you have to wait, but any mechanic the promotes not winning is bad dont defend just because its only 2 minutes
---
BEGONE THOT!

No and yes. It costs 2700 because it was released in the Last 3 chapters. (Plague, Ghostface/Ash, stranger things). Rest is right

"Imma dc because i'm a little bitch and if I can't win no one can" - killers who do that
---
Any feedbacks appreciated yt? :)
---
It takes 16 seconds to be healed without a Medkit and 32 seconds to Self Care.
---
Where the fuck does this happen? In low rank, the killer just camps the hook and the other survivors mindlessly run into the killer until theyre all dead.. so.......??
---
probably not tomorrow. probably at the mid chapter patch, things like this take much more then a day to fix
---
Yeah. Why give a shit about a random ranking
---
Dude, I want to party with Vigo
---
I‚Äôm so sad this show was canceled it was so good. That being said the season 3 finale was kinda of weird so I‚Äôm not sure if it would‚Äôve stayed good
---
Why shouldnt it? You even brought up that you can chase them and possibly get a kill out of it. And what if they are injured and the gates are super close which would leave you to probably get a guaranteed kill if they went for the gate. Or if you have NOED and push his teammates out. What if one gate is open and everyone is out and the last knows where hatch is. What if you hook the last guy and have bloodwarden activate. There are plenty of reasons for it. The endgame heavily favors the killer especially if there is one survivor left.
---
Of course my lord , let me just get him out of the loker and you shall get your sacrifice
---
Just posting here saying i'm not trying to throw shade or to be, "Survivors are TAXXIC!?!?!", just wondering if this was on my shitty part or if they were throwing some shade :P.
---
Not leaving as a group had a reason, not being able to alter color of scratch marks isn't the same.

No problem. Enjoy! You continue gaining shards after your level "resets" and you gain a devotion rank, yes. If you mean do you get an extra bonus for reaching that 100, no.

Exactly. You dont need to play her

LOL!
---
She dead harded. It's kinda hard to tell cuz she did it right as she started running but that's got to be what it was
---
Is it just me or do you get locked into certain maps? I swear I usually only play at most 3-4 maps at a time. I frequently get the same map back to back or alternating.
---
Yeah that was my bad, read the other comment and got my info mixed lol.
---
Well sorry you have to see people expressing they like something. We'll try to keep it toned down for your browsing pleasure. Let me know if I can get you anything else.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ no lies told!
---
The devs don‚Äôt usually act, it‚Äôs probably more office job like in environment, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not uncommon for them to openly react to something on their phones / computers, especially for people like not_Queen where part of there job is monitoring the community.
---
The insta-down only works with basic attacks, so no it wont work with the Shred ability or any other killer ability.
---
The speed bonus I'm pretty sure only works with base movement. (I'm basing this on how bloodlust doesn't effect chainsaw speed or any other ability so it makes sense that the NOED bonus works the same)
---
sad killer noises

---
no real possibility unless your a 1 shot killer of getting a survivor going for hatch and in that case the survivor wont do go for the hatch, for bad killers the run NOED sure its a risk the survivor but the perk is bad and can be completely destroyed before it can even proc no good killer runs it
---
it most cases the hatch wont be open for the injured survivor because other survivors arent gonna leave to everyone is at gate the case ur described is super rare i have played hundreds of killer games and have seen it once maybe
---
the surv has bad teamates if they leave without them, killer is faster and can close hatch before they get there in most cases in chase the point is the lone survivor has a way to escape already its not hopeless like when the gates arent powered yet
---
yea what percent of killer run bloodwarden that are trying to win none, yea and hatch isnt gonna be open cause theres more then one person on the map still cause bloodwarden didnt let them sooooo yeaaa
---
the 3 main examples you list of where it does matter are very rare, yet survivors refusing to win to just to get hatch happens basically every game
---
**and the easiest response to all this fine hatch stay open but gives same amount of points as escaping normally devs can add more ways to get points from other objectives to even it out, i dont care the survivors get extra points i care they are refusing to win**
---
lol expressing admiration for a male, sexually. For sure just something they "like". Don't know how long you've been here, but I hope you realize you're wrong, soon
---
yeah there's a dead hard there. But it's weird because it looks like the dead hard activated after the hatchet went past her
---
This! Played plague on this map, and I don‚Äôt think I had a chance at all. I think I could make it work with Pig, maybe with Freddy, but outside of those 2 I‚Äôll pretty much expect to get 0k as a killer.
---
Legion chase music based on the mixtape they're using time.
---
The bullying almost made me just stand in the corner and cry until they leave ;_;

i think this is a little much for an addon, maybe it could be part of his official power to make him a little better

Oh hey another one of these! Paging /u/Peanits &amp; /u/not_queen_bhvr and hell why not /u/mcote_bhvr too for some visibility as per usual with these posts. Still asking for some accessibility features 3 years later guys - what's up?
---
No, I was the obsession. have no idea why he wanted to kill him.  I guess he could have been like the killer I had that tunneled me for every gen the other day. my friend and I were using the new survivor steve. I was just the reg but he had the scoops ahoy stuff. He wanted to kill me because I was the "real" steve so he tunneled me. I ended up getting out and he's like you win this time steve but he seemed like a cool chill killer and was being cool in chat but that legion who tunneled my friend was pretty toxic.

Perfect then. I‚Äôve never changed my sensitivity in game but I have a razor mouse that lets me change the dpi. The Microsoft mouse sensitivity settings should also do the same effect if you don‚Äôt have a gaming mouse.
---
Pro cockwise.
---
This is by far the best killer they've made aesthetically. Same goes for the new map. They really leveled up their spookiness with this new update. Even as an experienced player the roars and atmosphere creeps me out sometimes, I can't imagine what it's like for a new player.
---
But you'd think you'd teabag then jump in
---
Also a separate music slider please. Now i know that music is a big part of the game when playing survivor but please give me the option myself to have it in game or not
---
This may sound pretty stupid, but I think everyone in the match should get 2000 points in each category for every DC, and some kind of balance for the survivors on the other side. That way, it encourages the remaining players to stay in the match, and makes the game more fair for the survivors with one person down.
---
Omg stop of be of that form why in the hell you care about the opini√≥n of the people of the Internet only play the game have fun

No, it‚Äôs a statue of Ghandi

I am the Senate.
---
Well not sure if they are going to fix it by tomorrow lol, at least they are aware which is something....... Just had a game as survivor and the killer got bullied by ranks 8 and 6, he was rank 16.
---
Losing is learning. And i've been doin a whooooole lot of learning recently
---
The odds of you making it out still aren‚Äôt high with this strat, you‚Äôve gotta make it all the way to the gate, and you burned your dh before the race to the gate even began, unless the survivor was hooked right outside the gate, one of you still isn‚Äôt leaving
---
I just don't have anything like that. It's a simple wireless logitech gaming mouse with no special software :/

Aight I dont like doing this but, r/woooosh

Once you figure out how to lay your traps, Hag becomes a real powerhouse

Really? I love that map totems are hidden, no infinites, good atmosphere, good loops for my is the Best map in the game

I haven‚Äôt had any problems

Ya that‚Äôs still fine. Microsoft has built in options just not as ‚Äúaccurate‚Äù [Heres a link](https://youtu.be/LBFp4LphZ_I)

First game I played I escaped and should have got Adept Steve achievement but nope the Killer who camped decided to quit at the very end
---
For now...

Does anyone else feel the rate that any tier of flashlight appearing in the bloodweb is severely nerf'd? Brand New Parts and instant-heal galore. I found one yellow tier flashlight in 10 webs at P3.

He gets looped easily. Straightaways are his friend

Holy fuck what the hell is that

Might be server lag.

In killers defense, no one deserves to escape. You may have done enough to escape, but no one deserves to escape.
---
Ive been running BBQ (for the BP mainly, and to see if how many survivors are across the map), Ruin (ruin on Spirit is OP until you get into the high ranks against a P3 Claudette and her rainbow map), Discordance (Gen grab Spirit is a thing and it helps slow the game down when the survivors figure out you have it), and Thrill of the Hunt (gives you a bit more tracking and lets you hella protect Ruin), or Haunted Grounds. For Add One I would highly recommend using anything that boosts her movement speed. You don't really need to worry about track marks too much since you will be using your ability to go somewhere that you already know the survivor is at. Also you must play her with headphones. Those pesky Blendettes can't hide from her when they are injured
---
....can I farm here?
---
Yeah I'm getting that and playing as Steve. I wish they could update skin packs to have new skins
---
What does WP mean?
---
I‚Äôm seriously considering dropping this game entirely. I‚Äôve never seen matchmaking so bad.
---
You don‚Äôt really depip. It‚Äôs just an animation, when loading back into lobby you will be the same.
---
No, Nea! That‚Äôs just the Endgame Phase!
---
O_O; What have they done with this patch?
---
better than before
---
But then we‚Äôd miss out on the Doctors cackles. How about we meet in the middle with Seth Rogen.
---
Or Iridescent head + infantry belt Huntress, that's pretty much easy mode for killer.
---
Tony Hawk Pro Skater chapter when?
---
Ur Microsoft sensitivity is max and ur game is max and that's not sensitive enough? I'm a little shocked tbh.. I can 720 barely moving my mouse an inch.
---
Probably would‚Äôve been better without the ‚Äúchainsaw noises‚Äù thing
---
For the response to the original I am currently annoyed and am just letting people win
---
Dying light on a anti healing build is fucking crazy annoying. If you ran Dying light every game you prob have a shit play style. the old dying light was bad game design, the new one is better anyways
---
What do you do to indicate to the killer you want to farm?
---
I had a daily once to open a gate, playing üêñ we got all gens some and I was last survivor. I was at the gate opening it when üêñ found me. I stopped and waved her over. She let me open the gate and escape. I just wanted gate, she could have hooked me and I would have been fine with that. To top it off, she had a mori to kill last survivor. I have many thanks in post game.
---
We were messing around in KYF mode and Nea got stuck like this
---
Fair, but if you ask me Joe is better
---
I'm surprised the 'beaten up steve face' isn't his P3 head.
---
Missed opportunity lol
---
You ass at this game then if you needed to kill your obsession with dying light every game to win
---
Then they won‚Äôt learn how to be a good killer and counteract survivors cheeky plays
---
Because I wanted to break the hook
---
I‚Äôm enjoying it! I‚Äôve almost made it to the end. Definitely worth the read.
---
Both sides complain. Both sides are being whiny bitches about it. Killers complain about Gen rushing, tea bagging, whatever OP perk they decide, SWFs, shit I've seen them complain about looping. Survivors complain about camping, tunneling, NOED, OP killer, whatever other bullshit.
---
Dont feel attacked because someone comes here whining there's plenty of killers here whining about bullshit too.
---
That's how Nurse mains are born lol 
---
I feel you though, I generally only play the game from rank reset up to about rank 7. I don't like to play survivor or take the game that seriously anymore and it stops being fun for me and just turns stressful, plus I don't want to throw games or DC to try and derank.
---
Yeah same here.
---
I haven‚Äôt purchased any cosmetics in a while but this ones definitely tempting
---
Myers looks like hes about to call an objection
---
oooo very nice, the amanda one is great &lt;3 do you do request?
---
I only dc when survivors are super toxic- tebagging on loops clicking flashlights while their friends gen rush.
---
I don‚Äôt believe survivors should get rewarded for shitty play styles. But I still feel it‚Äôs a shitty thing to do, but sometimes you need to fight fire with fire.
---
fat fucking cringe kiddo
---
Thank you! And I take requests occasionally, yeah. :)
---
Seeing as it only shows what he said, I would think the other person was banned as well assuming they were reported if they indeed tell your friend to "Kys" as implied by the "kys?". However he did basically threaten them.

r/emojipolice

Played against a Legion last night that used his power to dead Sprint over to me after death hooking the 3rd player (saving wasnt possible, so i sat on the hatch) and he slammed the hatch closed right in front of me as we both button smashed to get it first. I simply stood there waiting for the inevitable. Instead he hits me, hits me with his ability twice, and then hits me again to down me. He then proceeded to carry me around the map, if I started to wiggle he'd slap the wall so I'm thinking "oh, hes bringing me to a gate". Nope, this idiot carries me around and drops me on the ground repeatedly for the entire end game collapse. In post game chat the other survivors said the 2 of us were "autistic" when I was legit just standing there waiting for death. I replied "I was just waiting to die, blame the killer for prolonging the game" and this guy legit says "I was trying to help, I thought someone had a key and I was trying to find it for you"... he claimed he felt bad after slamming the hatch closed in my face. Like fuck just kill me or let me get out, pick one, dont just do laps around the map until the entity kills me and then say "oH i FeLt BaD fOr WhAt I dId"
---
The only useless perk in the build is inner strength. All other perks and items have uses in game, including healing other players.
---
What does wp stand for?
---
Hahahaha... went right over my head!
---
Honestly I‚Äôm not too sure, you can try again and get full chat logs of the end game chat to prove innocence.
---
I feel like the first picture of Dwight comes from a video I've seen before...
---
I think I‚Äôd prefer Andrew Ryan as the killer, I can‚Äôt think of anything off the top of my head but a ‚Äúwould you kindly‚Äù attack would be pretty unique.
---
I bought the game just for the stranger things dlc :)
---
Uh oh! Someone doesn't socialize with women often.
---
Personally, it'd be Michael for me.
---
well, in context, 80 seconds is a full hook stage. So getting the biggest effect is going to be a little rare, but this perk is meant to be used with Leatherface's perk knock out  (internal synergy yay) so that survivors are forced to hunt for a terror radius in order to locate the freezer.   
---
Since when the effect is active the Freezer and Leatherface have the same terror radius, Survivors will be on their toes scared whether they are walking into saving their teammate or walking head first into Bubba.   
---
The main effect is the mind game with the Terror radius, and the bonus is potentially stacking thematic debuffs onto a survivor.
---
Feng and doctor skins are rumoured for 25th of September, so I presume some time after that if not same time.
---
Clarify the context in a response.
---
Please leave
---
She got literally nothing. You got hit twice and hooked
---
Its a bug
---
I second this
---
What's the point of sending a message like this? Telling someone to kys over a video game is the most stupid shit. It is known that if you harass someone you can get banned. If you are going to send messages like that you definitely deserve a ban.
---
Play the game. If you can't have fun and need to yell at someone afterwards maybe you shouldn't be playing the game.
---
For your pig I‚Äôd recommend getting spirit fury if you can just to go with enduring and ruin for your 4th that‚Äôs my recommendation
---
The ol' one-two
---
His face has to look younger.  It could be ‚Äúyoung Ash‚Äù collection.
---
I like the style
---
"if you suck at looping", you'll never be able to counter any killer not only plague then.
---
 "Just cleanse and hide in a locker " is an unforgivable waste of time, and in DBD waste of time = defeat. Besides, it won‚Äôt save the rest of the team anyway.
---
 Your advice can maybe help a little on low ranks, but never on red ranks.
---
I third this
---
*Next chapter is only one killer/survivor, remember that*
---
You‚Äôre like a constant downer huh?
---
I had to manually search for the game as it wasn‚Äôt appearing on the September sales sections
---
Better than before. Works well with SBFL. Look forward to using it.
---
The other person was the one who said "kill yourself" to my friend. You are right tho. My friend was mad salty at the time....
---
But thats literally Demogorgons power. If you dont use the tunnels he just has a far lunge
---
please im illiterate let me pay for sins silently
---
Welcome to hell son
---
say sike right now
---
1) It‚Äôs Wheeler, not Weaver. 
---
2) What?
---
Pretty much all you can do as a survivor is motion to them though ultimately killer will probably think its "giving up" and not farming. Least as killer I can ride their tail till they realize I have not swung.
---
Honestly they probably had a daily also...
---
hmmm just in time for the switch release
---
It crashed:(
---
No.
---
*Bi
---
They didn't mention it...
---
God damn not a great start

Yawn. Thought you were gonna say something astute.
---
At least I‚Äôm not overly cocky
---
How I look after digging through 5 cans of trash for Applebee‚Äôs coupons
---
No definitely not
---
No it‚Äôs the instant heal self care no mither inner strength and unbreakable
---
Found [this](https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight) for you. Scroll down to mouse sensitivity. You‚Äôll need to add a few lines of code to the input file but it‚Äôs easy enough. Hope this works for ya.
---
I played billy and got no fps drop but my friend said when he was playing demo he got 15 fps
---
Gotta say Michael. Generally better perks and more fun to play. STBFL is extremely fun and satisfying if you play around it. 
---
That being said, Plague is appearing more than usual right now, probably because of the new healing perks. I found her fun for about a week and she now just collects dust for me. Michael is always fun.
---
Would that be there instead of Ruin or instead of whispers? I've read that whispers + bbq are amazing for Pig so isn't it unwise to swap that for spirit fury, as pig can avoid loops with her ability. Sorry for being argumentative I'm just trying to understand why I'd use it. Thanks for the suggestion &lt;3

Egads! My game is ruined!

But what if... I were to chainsaw the survivors up close?

Dont worry, there's crybabies like him everywhere

I was hoping he would be put on my side of the pallet
---
Oh really ?
---
Thanks for the info, I'll pay attention to that next time it happens.
---
Hey that‚Äôs better than being a Debbie downer, you should lighten up bud!
---
Some pretty strange things. heh
---
Ruin is better than overcharge by a mile. Ruin is needed just to slow the game down a little. But a popular stream who mains pig for 4K + hours uses Whispers, Brutal strength, Enduring and Monitor n Abuse. Whispers to find people, Brutal and enduring to help on loops, and monitor to confuse the fuck out of survivors. He doesn‚Äôt use ruin as you can use the Head traps as a ‚Äúbuilt in ruin‚Äù. But for my personal preference I‚Äôd put ruin in just to help me a bit.
---
Idk it's been thrown out there. Imo I really like whispers and for me the only killer I wouldn't run whispers on is myers.
---
Oh okay I understand then. I‚Äôm pretty lost I‚Äôm new to the game lol
---
it must be, it's been insanely bad for me too since the DLC and update came out. Do you play on PC or console? I'm on ps4
---
Just picked him up and he is the most fun killer I have played in a while.
---
They had to remove it when they switched to the new lobby system
---
I would recommend Monitor and Abuse on Myers, reducing his already tiny terror radius makes him a force to be reckoned with
---
I had at worse today. I‚Äôm Rank 14 and I fought 3 Rank 3 Survivors.
---
What did you do to him?
---
Will do. Brutal strength and enduring looks like a really fun combo. Will probably want brutal nonetheless so I guess I'll level up my trapper.
---
Yup! It happen to me a lot today because of match making. Teammates tried to help but these killers wanted to be ran for 3 or 4 gens. De pipped a bit today because of not getting enough objectives done. Better luck tomorrow I guess.
---
Okay thank you. This looks like something, I'll try it later.
---
Funny...but pretty dumb to do that right next to the cupboards and stuff with no couch cushion for added security.  This generation lacks common sense.

On PC. I also saw it on the few survivor games as well
---
One time I was playing Ghostface against a 4 man swf. Two had Bond, two had Urban Evasion, two had Spine Chill, and two had Premonition.
---
The game lasted 45 minutes because we were fighting to see who could hide better.
---
Michael
---
Had it happen to me last night. Tried the exit gates twice and then looked for the hatch. The killer watched me escape twice, but still closed the hatch in front of me once I finky found it and then watched me die while shaking his head. It was a good time.
---
Disconnecters are a huge issue right now. Just make sure you don‚Äôt do it from now on, it makes you an asshole.
---
Bro I was thinking about going legion for Halloween this year cmon bro gimme gimme
---
I don‚Äôt have Hag or clown either but I have doctor. Doctor isn‚Äôt in a great position atm but either is clown. Out of all of them hag has most potential probably but as you have ruin already clown has good perks such as pop goes the weasel. I‚Äôm in similar situation as you and I‚Äôm probably going to buy clown next.
---
"How do I use headphones?"
---
As an Xbox player, I would much rather have the PC lobby where you can escape instead of being constantly harassed in my DMs.
---
Giving Ash his boomstick or chainsaw would make him too powerful. The killers would run in fear of a fully equipped Ash.
---
 Funie.
---
if you throw the chainsaw, it moves more quicklyer
---
I don‚Äôt get it.
---
omg that's amazing lmao
---
Hey bud! Just saw a match where NOED insta-down worked with the Shred attack. 
---
This is most likely a bug and will be patched soon hopefully. Until then its there. : -)
---
https://youtu.be/-3-bVRYRnSM
---
He likely depipped from it, just keep playing and leave killers like this in the shit ranks where they belong
---
Being able to hold the struggle button on hook instead of mashing it would be another good accessibility feature
---
I have tutorials in my post history
---
DC‚Äôs are frowned up on, it ruins it for the other survivors as they stand less of a chance
---
*waka flocka gif*
---
Ok?
---
they never said it was tho
---
Shirtless Myers, iCarly dbd memes, and most importantly EA bad
---
I fourth this
---
He thought you ragequit which is a dick move though in your case it was just a mistake from a new player.  Definitely doesn't justify the stupid trash he messaged you at that one point though.  That was over the line and immature.
---
I fear no sub
---
But that sub
---
It scares me
---
Michael. I hated playing killer until I got Michael. He‚Äôs soooo much fun
---
I think BHVR did an AMAZING job with Steve and Nancy's likeness. But there's just something off about Ash. Yeah, he does resemble him, but they could definitely tweak him more.
---
That killer is just bad you should‚Äôve died right there
---
I did clarify that but they only said if the other person in question had to be dealt with they would be dealt with.
---
Sometimes if I‚Äôm in chase or get preoccupied, I totally miss the notifications. A lot of times, I think it‚Äôs them vaulting or a blown gen (it‚Äôs usually protecting a gen perk). It happens. Play more games with her to see if it‚Äôs a bug.
---
It is entirely possible you got the notification while in chase and didn‚Äôt hear it
---
You seem like fun people to play with
---
Facts. I don't care for the bright outfits, but this one is definitely up my alley.
---
We weren‚Äôt like teasing or anything if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking. He kept tunneling this other girl so I stepped in as a distraction
---
Why?
---
You misspelled ‚Äúshirtless Myers‚Äù

---
Ranks are broken af, it happens. But the community is toxic af just a heads up but you get used to it. Just prepare for spams on your steam profile and people adding you as friend to whine and cry .
---
I completely aggree with the devs about having 0 tolerance about those matters. It was a 1 time event tho, i never did something like that in any game or situation before.
---
Thanks, I'm efficient.
---
Why would you think it be closer to 20 with just one more survivor? You realize one killer and one survivor  DLC is normally $7? So that's $3.50 per character. If it was $20 that would mean about $6.60 per character, which is nearly doubled of the standard $3.50
---
I don't like the fact that I can relate to this.
---
Clown for sure! Bamboozle and pop goes the weasle, and hes quite fun to play too ‚ò∫Ô∏è His mori is gross
---
I'm pretty sure that speed buff applies
---
I know some people play the game on low for strategic value but holy hell does it look ugly haha
---
sad part is this is true im a rank 8 survivor but a terrible rank 18 killer and i consistently get red ranks in my lobby for no reason other than it is swf and one member is lower ranked
---
Oh, thanks!
---
And that's why you gotta bring black ward.
---
On demo though the power boost with lunge's range and (soon) ability to break pallets as basekit, this combo will make *him* the god of loops now, instead of survivors. He is the one killer who actually feels dangerous.
---
If u don't have ruin, Hag.
---
If you have ruin, Clown is fun and has one good and one meta perk.
---
Doctor on the other side is unique to play and has monitor and abuse.
---
Basketball
---
It's been like that since the update sadly.
---
Nurse with no add ons is strong but beatable. Omega blink nurse is broken af and is getting nerfed. They‚Äôre reworking her add ins.
---
I fifth it
---
Also hawkins is way to big
---
Because she‚Äôs a high skill killer.
---
Groovy
---
yeah thats why I am confused, now that you say that you got a merciless as doc the previous game, it explains a ton
---
Remember when playing killer took SOME skill?
---
I don't.
---
From rank 20-10 4Ks are common. Rank 10-1 2Ks are uncommon
---
Honestly I dont see the instadown being a huge issue, it effectively turns Demo into a short-range Billy that cant turn once endgame starts, and there are FAR better perks to use. Though I CAN see Devour and MYC being a bit OP, especially with his portals
---
Except most survivors are braindead and don't do gens. At all
---
Then he eat you...
---
What's the strategic value?
---
Oh my god you crutch using, butt smelling, poopoo. Yeah I said it.
---
You're on the subreddit so I assume youre playing the game he helped make?
---
You did a great job! The only thing I would say is watch your line thickness on some outer areas!
---
Yeah I‚Äôll be sure to know what I‚Äôm doing next time.
---
because they are incompetent
---
Ok then why are insta heals still in the game then? /s /s /s
---
Got both. Vastly different playstiles. Both rly fun to play.
---
About the perks, both of them have great ones:
---
Save the best for last is great on almost any m1 killer.
---
Infectious Fright is great on instadown killers and Corrupt intervention is quite good on killers with weak early games.
---
Honestly you can't go wrong here.
---
They're changing Steve's voice? do you have a link to the patch notes?
---
It is actually, and if you're on a swf group and the leader of the team is a low rank, he's gonna bring the rest of the team to low rank killers, even if they are rank 1 survivors
---
Glad to hear it, good luck in your future matches dude

The other day one did just disappear

i understand and i never said it wasn‚Äôt supposed to go with it. i said it‚Äôs a waste of two slots

Is that the part in the spongebob movie where he pretends to lose a contact in that bar
---
Can't ghostface do that like, wothout effort?
---
Lol
---
Uh he could be monsterafied? Don't really know the term like they did with Evan and wraith and doctor you know those normal people. You said it like ghostface isn't just some guy with a knife
---
Enjoy! And patience, young one. You will need it.
---
I‚Äôm using that exact pack!
---
Spirit is worse at least nurse requires skill especially with no add ons
---
Welp sorry dude. I'm not the best at art. Cosplay is more my thing.
---
Maybe, but it‚Äôs still making it easier to be a dick. I‚Äôm not saying the commendation thing is a bad idea, only that being able to prevent ranking up is. I think reputation scores could be an interesting idea (though it would be heavily abused somehow, this community finds a way) but being able to freeze your rank is a terrible idea. The whole point of the ranking system is to funnel you into a bracket that‚Äôs closer to your level, thus making it more difficult to bully noobs.
---
So.... your journey has begun lol congrats, see ya in the fog üëç
---
Killers are not indifferent about scoops ahoy Steve. Either I get tunneled or the killer won't chase me at all.
---
Yeah it crashed
---
100% expected the disconnect screen after that lol.
---
Alrighty. That thanks for letting me know!
---
Mine didn‚Äôt work at all yesterday so a bug is likely.
---
He was doable at rank 11. Once I hit rank 9-10, it became a chore. Now at rank 8, he seems pretty weak.  I could have much better success with other killers. I‚Äôll need a few more days to get to red ranks, but I don‚Äôt see him being all too viable.  
---
Now it could have been attributed to rank reset happening pretty recently, but majority of my matches I‚Äôve had to buckle down and go full try hard to pretty much get a safety or pip.
---
please, we were just as dumb =D
---
Hey I have 110 hours in the past two weeks too. No life gang rise up
---
I've gotten it like 4 times today, once as killer and 3 times as survivor. It's a good killer map, and bad for survivors. Which is fine, but I'm a survivor main so I don't like it. You can have my account until the algorithm goes back to normal lmao
---
That was sick!
---
it gets rid of shadows mainly, so you can't lose people in dark areas, not to mention also lets your game run more smoothly if you don't have the strongest rig so you don't get screwed over by frame drops or lag on your end.
---
No mercy.
---
&gt;  like ghostface and legion aren't just people with a knife
---
People with a knife and supernatural stealth/aura abilities.
---
Personally wish they would stick to original killers, least then they seem more interesting. Yet when you get big names people will immediately flock to it and give money. I imagine sales are going to be good too if Pennywise joins in.
---
thats just every red rank game
---
At this point, I don't know why people even play on console anymore, it seems like a disaster.
---
Dammit, you beat me to it.
---
Think of it like 'friendly banter' since we cant use mics to say, "nice job."
---
that's low res not just low graphics. low graphics looks pretty okay imo
---
Is spirit considered more toxic than nurse or billy now?
---
Lol? Running is super natural. Jokes aside no the blimp you see with feral frenzy is something The entity is causing just as his stealth powers
---
You do understand The entity gives certain killers there power right?
---
What console ?
---
If you check my post i did a few days ago someone explained it all in the comments, but I‚Äôm on phone so I couldn‚Äôt link it.
---
I read in a comment that it could have been one of the reasons people could do the 2 killer exploit bug thing
---
That was the first thing i learned lol. Spectating has been super helpful though.
---
Same thing happened to me and my friends the other night lol rank 20 trapper only using agitation lol. Had to be someone who made a new psn or something the way he ended chases so quickly and pressured gens. He hooked me and as i was tapping the struggle button he stared me in the face until I died haha
---
Petition to have the entity crawl out of the screens of everyone that puts on a cookbook or a jigsaw piece and pull them into the void.
---
I kinda feel bad for him he looked like he had no idea what the fuck was going on lmao
---
Absolutely adorable. 
---
I really like these character portraits and cannot wait to see what else you'll bring in the future. :D
---
That‚Äôs when I go Nurse. Occasionally, I bring along an ebony mori as an extra ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù when I‚Äôm feeling spicy. I enjoy feeling spicy.
---
I wanna know too!

Yep, she is telling you to go work on another gen so she can finish this one in peace lol.

I will drop my 3 year love affair for the chance to be Tony hawk

---
Thank you!!
---
I‚Äôm so glad you like them :D I‚Äôll hopefully give you guys something just as cute. ( &gt; ‚ó° &lt; )
---
Its not a bug. Speed limiter billy builds have been around for ages where you fool them into thinking youre messing around with the non insta down chain saw and then when noed is active they get fucked. Only things that dont work with noed are huntress hatches and legion deep wounds.
---
Called second wind . You have to heal someone for an equivalent of an entire health state then it activates.  When you ate unhooked or unhook yourself, it puts you into the broken state. Then as long as you are outside the killers terror radius the perk count down begins, and once it is finished you are unbroken and healed . Nifty perk to do 2 things are once but it has some major downsides. The perk activation requirement, camping killers , the obvious signs that you have the perk on you( killer see you get unhooked and suddenly broken), small maps with alot of floors. Also it won't start its countdown if you are already broken.  So if you use deliverance you have to wait for that broken effect to be done for the countdown on this perk to begin.
---
Xbox
---
I knew it. That's pretty sad tbh on my part.
---
I‚Äôd try to get enduring and Pop Goes the Weasel
---
Yeah, I went into a match and did the achievement but when I came out it had changed itself.
---
Surge is kind of pointless. And they find Ruin within a minute
---
Gonna have to pray for the Shrine then, I HATE playing clown
---
I got a ‚ÄúGG, EZ win‚Äù when i‚Äôm over here as a lv 20 Spirit who wanted to try her out
---
You‚Äôve already fufilled my wishes by having all 4 Legion members in the portrait. I‚Äôm so happy with that already. ·ïï( ·êõ )·ïó
---
Logical fallacies...if only people understood them more.  Ad Hominem Fallacy "Ghostface isn't OP, you're just bad.  Look at this big list I made see, you're bad."
---
It's not that I agree, or disagree with the context of the argument "Is ghostface OP" it's just reading something that isn't logical is pointless to participate in.
---
Nah, prayer beads is worse than omegablink
---
I had to include them all!! They‚Äôre some of my favorite killers! I‚Äôm really glad you like it though! :‚ÄôD
---
Thank you, that really means a lot to me.
---
hello, 911? yes, i'd like to report a murder?
---
Head on Inner Strength Quick and Quiet and Dance with me.
---
They made I good game. I think you need some competence for that.
---
I find surge to be pretty decent actually, it's nice for keeping down gens when survivors are too spread out to stop the regression
---
Aw don't feel bad! It's not your fault he DC'd, and it was really nice of you to think to give him hatch in the first place. Also, sometimes you gotta get those sacrifices. This coming from a survivor main.
---
Happens to me so many times you literally can't move you're stuck in dying state
---
Yeeees! Gotta get that love for Legion! :'D
---
I love the map for it's beauty and sound design, but Jesus Christ the frames are bad on Xbox. As killer at least.
---
BE GONE SATAN
---
You can see killers red stain through walls (sometimes at least)
---
I think the animation doesn‚Äôt happen if you‚Äôre doing any kind of action when you get downed
---
I hear you. Yeah Freddy has more direct map pressure now but losing the stall, tracking, and inability for a SWF to track your movements accurately when awake will be missed. It kind of sucks how the DW honestly isn't that threatening to be in right now.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it can with add ons
---
Speaking from experience, it doesn't. And a power shouldn't be addon dependent to be viable.
---
Survivors can't see inactivate portals!? That's nuts.
---
i play almost any pvp game on the lowest it can go purely because of shadows and dark areas.
---
yeah i was gonna say, their game looks a little more like [mine](http://imgur.com/a/P7EcfKg), not like Puppers', who iirc plays on Low and his game still looks really nice.
---
No, it doesn't. Even the devs QA team has said they basically do nothing. Honestly not sure why nothing was ever done about it.
---
I was waiting for the DC
---
It depends on the game, at first it's the first I see, then if one of them pisses me off i go after them, if one of them is REALLY pissing me off i tunnel them to get rid of them.
---
r/dbdgonegay *
---
I played so much tony hawk pro skater and underground as a kid this would be amazing and you have so much content to pull skins from!!!
---
Also the fact that you lose YOUR ITEMS when the KILLER disconnects is ridiculous.
---
I know it‚Äôs not my fault but it does not stop the pain. I probably just killed two Stranger Things fans‚Äô enjoyment of the game :(
---
Claudette proly the survivor that never showers, so the killer can't smell her.
---
Looks like lag switching
---
wrong you depip
---
Welcome to the Space Jam.
---
It's happening on pc too. I had a 3 gen repair daily and then it switched to a hag daily. Then that daily switched to a trapper daily. I was like wtf is going on?
---
Hello BHVR? I‚Äôd like to report a player.
---
It always takes me a while to find a game as a survivor, but as a killer, it takes me like 10 seconds to get into a lobby easy.
---
If you can somehow get the kill for free then sure. If you are playing at high rank you are going to get annihilated by DS and BT. Even if you wait them out, it will still give the survivors enough time to rush down the gens.
---
It's the Upside Down. Anything can happen. 
---
You'll float too!
---
You forget that Elizabeth lost her powers and that the big daddy is just a puppet, easily guided to what the entity wants.
---
Legion got a lot worse with their rework actually. Just an annoying killer to play against and if they‚Äôre bad survivors then it‚Äôs gg
---
Probably because tunneling literally keeps survivors from playing the game? And it‚Äôs not really fun to keep getting killed over and over again in a game about survival. Just my guess as to why some people get mad at killers for tunneling. Funny that you tunnel to get rid of the decisive when that‚Äôs literally the point of running the perk
---
Thanks, I didnt saw it, I assumed it was posted, but I guess I should've searched better before posting
---
Its so good - because its so accurate!
---
Andrew Ryan? You mean his rival Frank fontang or however his last name is pronounced.
---
Just save up 2mill bloodpoints and get it that way then
---
I wish this happened to me. I played killer for the first time when the demogorgon came out and boy oh oh did I get messages saying how bad I was and how I was wasting offerings
---
Doesn't count until you miss the DS skillcheck
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
same, probably because of free weekend
---
It's called playing the game moron, that's how you get more points.
---
On the bright side killers got 3 perks that are completely useless.  BALANCE!
---
Holy crap this sub is delusional defending tunneling
---
I HATE IT THAT I CAN RELATE TO THIS
---
Hail to the king baby
---
Lmao if this was on Xbox it was me
---
I hate it because it's a fucking maze, finding the gens is like searching through a labyrinth, and almost every single pallet is useless.
---
poor solidarity got left behind
---
This is the truth
---
This is entirely normal, its the best part of the game. I cant even recommend getting friends to play with because that doesn't help.  In all honestly it is bad, but not that bad. its normal to wait 5-15 minutes for a survivor match and killers matches as well.  What platform are you on by chance?
---
I know everyone is gonna wanna be positive and tell you to stick with it (and you should) but I‚Äôll be the one to be real with you. Yes, that is absolutely a recurring theme in this community and it‚Äôs not likely to change anytime soon. I choose to just report assholes and not let it get to me. But if it‚Äôs too much for you or being told to kill yourself is a trigger for you then this may not be the game for you.
---
Lack? 
---
Y o u ‚Äò r e  j o k i n g ,  r i g h t ?
---
Well I have to agree with you there I can see what you mean.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I really want solidarity to get buffed, I feel in its current state it‚Äôs so niche of a scenario to apply,
---
I hate this Change. It honestly wont make him any stronger due to how long you are stunned after breaking. It will only make him annoying to play against, similar to old Legion.
---
What they really need to Change is, allowing you to put Portals like the hag, its really stupid that you just run out unless they get broken

I've had survivors block me from getting Myer's achievement by DCing 3 different times.  Literally ran out of addons for it.
---
How can you start the threat talking about how jumping into lockers in certain situations is a mindgame currently, and then say killers who join the mindgame and open the locker are bad killers. Smh
---
bold of you to assume tony would be a survivor
---
Thanks bro that‚Äôs why I asked if they capped it.
---
Imo if u just go around the pallet its a insta hit instead of eating the pallet, theres almost no mind game potential on ANY pallet, im all for making killer friendly map but this shits a little far fetched I will be not happy to play this map
---
that was so satisfying, did you give dwight the hatch?
---
I've been meaning to ask about this, tnx all who replied.
---
Nothing makes me tilt harder than seeing Killers camp and tunnel the new players on free weekend. Don't be that guy killers, don't be that guy!
---
And survivors don't be a teabagger either.
---
I‚Äôd disagree, similar nose and mouth, same color eyes, close head shape, the only major difference is hair and glasses.

I would shit bricks if I saw a hallucination Hillbilly coming towards me and disappearing in a puff of smoke. Amnesia vibes right there...

8K in each category is max
---
Pig tried to grab Jake off of the gen.  Jake's laggy as fuck, so Pig gets stuck in the grab animation while Jake lags.  
---
BTW, this is SUPER ANNOYING as killer because you literally just get stuck until the survivor stops lagging.  Also, you definitely do not end up getting the grab.
---
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE
---
Yes I know the image isnt mine, just thought it'd be funny. No need to be so specific whoever deleted their comment.
---
Yes
---
A lot of kids are insecure
---
My friends don't get why I love playing on Lery's as Hillbilly. Tight corridors = inability to dodge a big fucking chainsaw.
---
I love both Bioshock and dbd so seeing this made me very happy
---
Legions terror radius should just be numb by Linkin Park
---
This could be so damn discouraging for that poor plag (but also, rank 19 with non-licensed DLC?)  Hope they shake it off and get better.
---
Well it depends, when they come back after 5 yards is there a survivor removing you from the hook? Cus if so, its a smart play.
---
You sir deserve the mori
---
If you insta unhook with borrowed time, I'll do that.
---
It would be so simple to add too!
---
Well lucky for me and my friends I guess since we get at least one loop from most pallets. I've seen plenty of loops that you can loop for a bit if you really want to and I feel like that's how a map should be. 1 or two very strong loops and mostly unsafe ones. It's not like the point of a chase is for every gen to get popped whilst its happening, chases have to be short, or at least shorter as gen speed is very fast compared to how long the average chase is.
---
This is why I don‚Äôt play any killers except one or two, even though I have almost all the DLC. Learning a new killer is not worth the toxicity and now I don‚Äôt buy DLC anymore.
---
I like the way his portals work now. It forces you to be smarter with your portals instead of blowing your load all over during early game
---
The one that runs to the weaker tile. Fyi killer player =/= killer main
---
OK but why does Doc have R2D2's penis
---
Dude that's like the day I'm moving! I want to upgrade demogorgon :(((
---
I feel your pain. Dying Light has so much potential rn but we can't even test it cause it causes the game to crash
---
Mum says it's my turn on the generator
---
You get so irradiated by the toxicity you change genders
---
kind of confused about what the issue was?  the dwight was unintentionally letting your farm EW?
---
I know
---
I can‚Äôt get anymore daily‚Äôs
---
That‚Äôs what I thought lmao all the replies are like ‚ÄúI hate toxic survivors like this‚Äù and I was like..... hold up is this build actually good
---
Are you going to do one for all the killers?
---
I'd been playing about 2 weeks when I recorded that and the only reason I was such a jerk to them was they were following me around most of the game flicking flashlights at me and body blocking.
---
That is apparent.
---
Great play

Censor the name, even if he‚Äôs a toxic berd

I breathed heavily through my nose on this one thanks bro 10/10 meme.

The gg and the synergy with your little cat icon make for an awesome build to counter salt attacks like this.

It's 4os 
---
r/woooosh
---
The moment you popped up and showed in front of her I can just hear and feel the "ffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuu" in the killers head haha
---
2 idiots having the most pointless conversation I've ever seen.
---
No I'm pretty sure the Dwight didn't know about Michael's power and then the whole team didn't wanna pick him up. So I'm pretty sure it was a newbie.
---
/r/wooosh
---
Well if you look at the pic it's him that didn't DC so it's kind of inferred that he wasn't talking about getting points for leaving.
---
Billy needs better skins.
---
SPOILER!!!
---
I think that the only thing the entity had to do was kidnap the Demogorgon and it would do the objective
---
(kill survivors) by itself. As seen in the series it is not very intelligent, I mean it to s aware of its sorroundings but the only thing it thinks about is killing everything it can find
---
(Like a dear) so it wouldn't be nessesary to tame the creature.
---
Also pig is just a human using a knife and clown just a human who has mustard gas
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
I agree. Tunneling is the way to. It is great fun and wins more matches than one would think.
---
All in all a great tool and a smart way to play.
---
I see someone‚Äôs a little slow arriving to the party, huh
---
You said 7 wrong
---
Never seen the show, but the taming part would refer to hooking I feel, not so much the killing.

&gt;[Survivor Behavior Reasons and Proposed Changes]
---
&gt;Goal - Reduce Tbagging:
---
&gt;Add a 1 second cool down on crouch. This could either keep you crouched for 1 second on click, or limit input to 1 crouch per second. 
---
&gt;Goal - Reduce 'Clickbait':
---
&gt;Turning on a flashlight consumes a low base % of the battery life. (rapid clicking drains it faster) [Survivor Item Changes Reasons and Proposed Changes]
---
This has to be a shitpost.
---
Hey bud.  Shred is actually really good.  Here's some ways you can use it:
---
1)By far the best and most common way - as a mindgame.  Start charging it and survivors will often juke.  Most of the time they will let you close distance on them to avoid a potential Shred.  This can easily get you hits on loops when you normally would not be close enough to get one.  Kind of like Huntress holding a charged hatchet or Billy tap revving his chainsaw.
---
2) You need to be proactive when you're going to use Shred during loops - strafe when you go around a corner to a part of the loop you can lunge and start charging the Shred before you get around the corner.  
---
3) You can use Shred with a minimum amount of charging and it's almost as quick as a normal swing (about the same as a normal lunge).  This is super useful for stuff like Save the Best for Last since Shred doesn't cause you to lose stacks when you hit your obsession unlike your regular M1.  
---
4) You can zone people out with Shred - start charging one and you can prevent survivors from running through an open(ish) area that you're facing.  Again, this works very similar to Huntress hatchets/Billy's Chainsaw.  You can prevent survivors from getting to strong loops or you can corral them into dead zones by using this.
---
5) Other than options 1 &amp; 4 don't walk around with Shred charged - this is especially important during a loop.  If you can't hit a Shred then cancel it.
---
6) You can use Shred to cover a lot of distance if you lunge off of elevated areas onto lower areas with it.  You'd be surprised how much distance this covers and it is faster than just walking.
---
As for his portals - they are not at ALL useless.  However the portals aren't used similar to any other killer's power (with the partial exception of Hag using her Mint Rag addon).  First, you can't re-place a portal once you put it down unless survivors cleanse it.  Don't just spam portals all over the place - be somewhat picky about where you place them.
---
Survivors can't close portals that aren't open.  If the portal IS open, you can see whenever a survivor is near the portal by using your power (it shows up with the same graphic as Legion sees in Frenzy after he stabs someone).  If you see a survivor near your portal when you use your power and you teleport to the portal it will prevent the survivor from closing the portal even if they were almost done with it.  
---
Demo's portals also have some restrictions on where they can be placed.  They have space restrictions similar to Hag/Trapper traps (even though they are visually much bigger) but also some others:
---
1) can't place them within 8 meters of other portals
---
2) can't place within 4 meters of hooks and exit gate switches 
---
3) can't place within 2.5 meters of a pallet
---
One of the biggest ways to use portals is just to save time - put them in a few key spots around the map so you don't have to repeatedly walk all the way across the map.  On maps with multiple levels, put portals in good spots on each level.
---
Another way to use them is for information - you see survivors when they near your opened portals when you hold your power so putting them in a choke point and spending half a second to check them often can help tremendously.  
---
Demo has an insane basement game (especially if you use Territorial Imperative) and a VERY strong 3gen as well.  He can even defend 3gens that aren't super close together, especially if two of them are somewhat close and the 3rd isn't - just drop two portals at the far gen and don't open one of them.  Then survivors never be able to deny your teleport - if they cleanse the open portal, just teleport to the closed one and drop another portal there and leave it closed.  Plus you can use your ability to see when they are either working on the gen or trying to close your portal.
---
I'm not sure where Demo ranks among all of the killers yet but he's definitely not low tier.  IMO he's probably around Huntress - not quite as lethal but he actually has mobility and the ability to pressure the map AND he's not super map dependent either.
---
She‚Äôd have to tame it to get it to sacrifice, instead of outright killing the survivors
---
Now I wonder if I can get an extra PwtF stack out of borrowed time.
---
They are still on sale on ps4
---
JFC, looking like a N00b3 build in here.
---
Interesting. I had no idea I thought it was from some anime or something
---
Learn to read completely, might help you become more astute.
---
Yeah sometimes I do that too. Maybe its a petty thing, but if I give someone the hatch, I want them to know I let them have it ya know?
---
Like I said its probably petty, but still, I do it too
---
tehy likely will be on sale on halloween
---
Agreed Ash needs to be buffed a bit, his perks are lack luster now.
---
Make your choice?
---
I know that one because of [Fatal Fury 2](https://youtu.be/HbWPpkTN4tY?t=1552). 
---
^(Yes. That motherfucker gets a whole orchestra to play in the background while he fights you as the final boss.)
---
Now that's a Bill move right there.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. for perks use BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way. the lunge sucks. im at a disadvantage if i try to use it. and the tunnels are boring
---
Uh no
---
I had no clue I could want something so badly until just now
---
Yeah it's a classic meme build
---
Honestly I don't think a static bonus is good but maybe a percentile bonus would be better. Some one leaves and pop you get a 15% to 20% bonus towards your total and it stacks per DC. Maybe have it for every gen completed before the first DC lower the percentile so if someone DCs after four Gen it's a 11% to 16% bonus.
---
Solidarity would be great in a build with We'll make it and WGLF if it got buffed
---
Tf is SWF
---
swap surge into anything else, it doesnt work on jump. Others is really meta as everyone said
---
What if we used 100% of the brain?
---
Playing with friends on a team game is toxic.
---
Is what you‚Äôre saying.
---
Yeah I've seen some streamers run it, seems like it could be useful
---
he's just trying to give players a nicer experience
---
Perfect caption haha
---
Several of the killers aren't really evil if you read their backstories. But everyone (killer and survivors alike) are just prey being manipulated by the Entity.
---
Survive with friends
---
I'd argue this one, as a fellow killer main.   
---
While I agree other perks can do wonders with it, NOED can be used very effectively on certain builds (We all know the ones im talking about), plus it is the main counter to Adrenaline. I'd argue it's a pretty good perk, just not as top tier as many may think.
---
EU?
---
That‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs me, baby.
---
Eh, the thing about perks though is that everyone has access to them.
---
It's definitely weaker. People look at it's potential max penalty now and get all starry-eyed
---
Meanwhile in practical scenarios it sucks. While it feels good to get stacks for something you'd normally do anyway, the fact it's tied to the obsession and you lose all your progress if the obsession dies seem like a big stinker of a perk.
---
People rag on Thana for being trash due to its low impact. The exact same situation is here, you're not going to slow the game by a meaningful amount with the numbers it currently provides. It's basically a win-more perk. Any game you'd max it out you're already winning.
---
Learn to spot edits on reddit posts, It might make your condescending posts look less stupid.
---
I think it actually gets better on higher ranks. Tryhards at the beginning use pink addons, mori, camping since they dont know any better. At higher ranks they know enough about the game to actually just use skill and play the game
---
I was bullied in my first and only clown game. They could obviously see that I only had a single perk and no items afterwards. Yet they still called me trash.
---
Stunning removes bloodlust anyway, but I like it
---
I keep getting the new map, And I hate it. I wish y'all could just get it.
---
Yeah. She taught them how. Teachable.
---
Pig has 3 outfits tho
---
Isn't that the whole point of playing with friends ?
---
literally not at all
---
You can stay in brown ranks forever! You just have to never get good at the game or constantly change things for yourself. In 120 hours I‚Äôve never gotten higher than 11!
---
Okay, make killers balanced against SWF instead of solos
---
Instantly heals to 250% health, bugging the game, making you immortal.  
---
  
---
Nerf please!
---
How it seems, she went to the location before you dropped the pallet so it blinked her inside, the game started bugging and popped her on top.
---
A lot of Steves are newbies, I had a rank 20 perkless Steve in my game who died on his first hook by attempting escape and not struggling.
---
I think he's being tunneled cause a lot of killers think he's an easy kill.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I had figured happened. I get hit through pallets and windows quite often, so to have this happen was at least a big laugh.
---
October 2nd apparently
---
Rank unfortunately doesn't work that way for most of us. The more you play. The more likely you are to go up in rank even if you're a complete potato. 
---
Hence all the blendettes chilling at Rank 1 who wouldn't know how to win a chase against even Leatherface  if killed them....and it will.
---
Now if they would add his funeral outfit too that would be Groovilicious
---
Holy fuck stop sharing we fucking know it is broken. This gets posted 50 times a day god damn
---
Potential for A Hauting of Hill House crossover? Lol no matter what I did she defaulted back to this "pose"
---
Warms my heart seeing more Ash posts :')

Like everyone else, by coercion.

Hell yeah brother! Get it in!! üòÑ

Outfits you can purchase
---
Can we get a Shooting Stars video of this, please?!
---
"Couple of days" this has been getting posted for 2 weeks or something
---
thats the blank verison, what about the og version
---
What OP is saying is clearly an exagerated statement, but your response is equally wrong. SWF can be an unfair advantage because the game is balanced towards solo players who have limited communication. so yes, even if it is a team game when you go with a super coordinated SWF team you are indeed being toxic.
---
Ms. Pigsy wanted to do a gen with you guys. Oink
---
And then the sweet child tried to save them. Bless that baby Dwight
---
Or just get Mcote lol... you know the guy who was based off his face.
---
I just had three disconnect on me a minute into the match after I got downed. Not bad for my second day of playing the game. Also, what is pipping/depipping?
---
Ily. Let me have your babies.
---
It actually is a little more than a second shorter.
---
Yeah I don't know why you got downvotes, this is honestly painful to look at. Looks like it's running on a 15 year old Windows XP laptop
---
Wakizashi Saya increases Spirit‚Äôs reappearance duration and movement speed so when she comes out of her power, she‚Äôs both fast and invisible much longer.
---
Yakuyoke Amulet boosts her power. Movement speed, recovery speed, and duration are moderately increased.
---
*no mither*
---
*self care*

Somethings not right, I can feel it

Why do you tell me how I should play?

r/Madlads
---
Skill
---
Man I'm a trash dwight main myself and I try to gg when it's warranted. So much hate in this game I'm just glad I get to have fun every once in a while.
---
Still doesn‚Äôt sound like something the Entity would appreciate too much
---
You can fall from the edge of the map and hope to find the hatch once  respawned. 
---
Happened to my friend and he was able to escape just fine. He got lucky, hatch was right next to the place where he respawned.
---
Why thank you
---
When this happens you have to escape through the hatch ! It‚Äôs a longtime bug that they know about but haven‚Äôt fixed ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
did i mention he's also a streamer?
---
It's two surviors and a killer what did they expect
---
Yee Yee
---
This is the exact kind of person I was referring to.
---
Community, take notes. You all have a lil something to learn here.
---
There was a time where i didn't play for about 4 months and got demoted to rank 17 from rank 10. But i do think that i play a decent spirit and nurse but dont have the hours to pour in to reach rank 1. I came across what seems to be a swf with 2 flashlights and a key. I went in using nurse and they t-bagged right off the bat. Little did they know that i wasn't a baby nurse. Long story short, i got a 4k with 4 gens up. I can't imagine how a new player would have survived that and have the urge to continue playing with asshats like those.
---
That's usually have it goes. People are too blinded by something to see that Behavior doesn't give a single fuck about their playerbase, so they take great offense when you say something.
---
Fast AF boi
---
How DARE people try to have fun with their Friends?!
---
I would prefer blue tbh or green
---
Then say that?  The whole ‚ÄúSWF is toxic‚Äù thing is so tired. This community really overuses that term.
---
Playing with friends in comms doesn‚Äôt automatically make you a toxic player so please stop lmao. 
---
Going out of your way to teabag, flashlight click, ect is toxic. Having a fun game night with friends isnt.
---
Gandhi whenever he gets nukes
---
they're still downvoting me despite my edit, I have no idea why when it was a common mistake assuming it was the graphics settings
---
Give him a few more weak he'll be just as toxic as rest of the community
---
Never slug a Bill
---
I know buddy looks like it's back to dbdgonewild for me now

Yeah I know, dumb joke with dumb punchline

The person who played will in the inbetweeners might be good. Not sure how much older he looks now though, maybe hes grown out of the nerd look
---
But he was clearly in the terror radius...?
---
Can someone smarter than me ELI5?
---
Haven‚Äôt you heard from the infinite plus posts that it‚Äôs either broken or an swf is there
---
Yes it does, it is much worse than teabagging or flashlight clicking. those can be just ignored, but wasting a 10+ minutes wait to get a 5 minutes game where you get stomped because the other team used "legal" cheats is something that does affect your playing experience.
---
Nobody is telling you to stop playing with friends, but at least be civil and use the comm for chatting with your friends and some minor coordinations.
---
When all my teamates and I are downed and we try to overlap ourselves
---
All of them are unsafe as fuck
---
My friends don't want to play :( I heard it's broken but not this much c'mon
---
.....that isn‚Äôt what tunneling means
---
The correct answer is "gg ez noob get rekt"
---
...Metal Gear?
---
And my axe
---
1.	Don‚Äôt run any one hit down perks such as NOED or Devour Hope (unless you really want to mori). As soon as you learn how to lean properly you‚Äôll get everyone in the exposed status constantly. 
---
2.	Don‚Äôt bother camping it‚Äôs a pure waste of time due to how easy it is to one down. 
---
3.	Once you get really good at stalking most survivors will stop trying to heal. Not a bad killer to use thanathapobia (spl?) with but overall still not a good perk. 
---
I main Ghostface and this is my perk build:
---
1.	BBQ &amp; Chili
---
2.	Bloodhound
---
3.	Pop Goes The Weasel (although I‚Äôm considering replacing this with Surge)
---
4.	Lightborn (especially good at getting some stalk in when they think they can stun you)
---
What name does he stream under?
---
When I saw Feng getting moried by the nurse I like: "WTF, thi is a porn game?"
---
Poor guy was less 2ms off
---
I hate the dark crystal with a passion and those things are nasty
---
I swear Ghostface is the only killer that I‚Äôve experienced being that toxic.
---
A lot of them call me out saying I‚Äôm a duo or more and I‚Äôm like no. I‚Äôm solo. As I‚Äôm solo 99% of the time.
---
* Stab a guy, apply Deep Wounds. 30 seconds remaining.
---
* Oh wait you have Stab Wounds Study, the base timer is reduced by 5 seconds. 25 seconds remaining.
---
*  With Frank's Mixtape equipped, stab them again with your second Feral Frenzy attack, reducing the timer by 7.5 seconds. 17.5 seconds remaining.
---
* At some point in the chase, you get Frenzy back and stab the guy again. 10 seconds remaining.
---
* At some point in the chase, Tinkerer activates. Your terror radius immediately goes away, so the Deep Wounds Timer starts ticking down, and they can't stop to mend since you're chasing them. This lasts 12 seconds.
---
no it's just vanilla shitty unless you're trying to do a gimmicky build with resilience and this is not happening
---
Can‚Äôt say
---
It's Frank Fontaine meat bag!
---
No it is an absolutely horrible perk, if you want to get yourself up use unbreakable
---
Don't forget about balance landing abuse too ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Literally just did that a minute ago üòÇ
---
&gt; Shit if I can get an early ds out I sure as hell tunnel.
---
Nothing else to say to you other than gitgud.
---
I've literally deranked because a killer DCs it's not a visual glitch
---
For in-game purposes alone it can help you see more of the screen to see survivors if they wish to be very stealthy. On Nurse specifically it's great to move her hand away from her face and makes blinking *feel* better, in my experience a lot of top Nurses use it.
---
If you play other First Person games and use a big FOV going to DBD and playing without Shadowborn can cause Nausea. For example my GF had really bad Nausea when we played Dying Light together, the climbing she said made hee feel sick, so I asked if she raised her FOV and she said no, the moment she did she felt basically no nausea just the remnants of the nausea before it. So it can help you just *feel* better while playing.
---
But as you know, Shadowborn is an insanely addictive drug, once you use it, you can never go back. For all intensive purposes, it wastes a perk slot IMO, unless you're playing Nurse or Spirit then continue using it, every other killer needs all slots to be highly effective and functioning.
---
Okay how about you tell me a killer that is more difficult that nurse or spirit. 
---
Because even if what you said was all you had to do
---
That still requires more base effort than other killers 
---
And to utilize that to the fullest requires way more skill 
---
Nurse you need to have played the game lots to get really really good at her 
---
Because you need to be able to predict and judge your blinking or your gonna juke yourself.
---
All I‚Äôm saying is that at least half of all killers are easier than spirit and I consider her to be top difficulty compared to most killers.
---
I agree. It's probably because the stranger things chapter brought in a wave of new people to the game you are interested in the chapter, but they have no clue on how to play
---
Rip
---
Probs easiest way to get a xenomorph killer
---
I had 2 games yesterday where hatch literally spawned right next to me after picking up the last survivor. Each time I paused and looked at it, then kept walking because for some reason they want to spam ADADADADADAD
---
Everyone calling him toxic but what I'd like to know is what you did to provoke him so bad
---
&gt; flashlight clicked to try make you chase them instead
---
"Hey that guy sucks! Instead of doing gens I'm clicky clicking at you. You should chase me instead because I'm so much better"
---
Someone didn‚Äôt get any hooks.
---
What a fool that individual is! My favorite is when I get several voice messages post game all complaining about some aspect of the game that didn‚Äôt go in their favor. 
---
Good response with the gg.
---
How is changing a few values on scratches changing the entire game? 
---
The only reason it's not happening is because the devs have other priorities right now. They've already said it's something they want to look in to.
---
Don't get my hopes up.
---
I usually drop them and shake my head no. If they still don‚Äôt get the message they die.
---
Any tips on how I can escape its grasp?
---
Nah, that first pic is just Steve doing what he does best ;)
---
You mean it instantly makes survivors DC?
---
4, 6 and 16 will be SWF with the 16 hosting.
---
My take on it is gen rushing is accomplishing the only objective survivors have. Tunneling is a tactic that may help the killer in their objective but is detrimental to one survivor. 
---
I get that 3 vs 1 is much better than 4 vs 1, but it‚Äôs so frustrating as a survivor as the only way to combat tunneling is by being good at looping. If I get unhooked at a bad time and the unhooker doesn‚Äôt body block for me, my game is pretty much over and I‚Äôm walking away with a few thousand BP.
---
&gt; Okay how about you tell me a killer that is more difficult that nurse or spirit
---
*Literally* any other killer on the roster. Proficiency at running tiles and map pressure/ situational awareness takes way more time to learn than nurse's blink mechanic or the flowchart spirit has.
---
&gt;Nurse you need to have played the game lots to get really really good at her
---
She's literally the first killer I got to Rank 1 with like 2 weeks after I got the game. She's piss simple. The only thing that knocked me off my "im good as killer haha" high horse is when I got dailies for any other killer and realized I got my shit kicked in way harder than the killers I faced did.
---
Because it is called STRUGGLE PHASE and you have to STRUGGLE to SURVIVE? I don't see any reason to change it. It's not difficult to mash the space button and holding the space button would be boring.
---
Or add wheels to pallets and ride them.
---
The devs know about this issue and are already working on it, I‚Äôd expect a mini patch to come out here real soon
---
I think that the red and purple might be in a swf with the other rank 16 
---
As for the killer I get paired with green ranks all the time
---
Okay cool thanks!
---
I don‚Äôt like the map all the pallets suck and it‚Äôs to small for my style of play for killer and survivor
---
Why would it not be good? At base Demo is an M1 killer that benefits from Enduring + Fury like any other killer that has to deal with pallets, and then you want to Shred into pallets all the time anyway because the host latency advantage combined with the incredibly high speed of the Shred all but guarantees you hit survivors through pallet drops (if you ever face Engraving Billies on 80+ms, you will have an idea of how ridiculous this is). Combine that with Enduring and Fury and that's some easy one-two-combo kills, hitting the Shred on the survivor, getting stunned by the pallet, and then either ending up on the same side as the survivor, Enduring giving you the follow-up hit or grab instantly, or Fury destroying the pallet, likewise giving you the next hit immediately afterwards.
---
It will be even better once Shred destroys pallets at base, because then Shredding into pallets is even more of a no-brainer, with the worst-case scenario being you destroying the pallet (well, the actual worst case is not landing the Shred and the survivor not dropping the pallet, of course).
---
Hey, just a heads up, you can pretty easily take a screenshot on PS4 using the share button. 
---
Also yeah man, matchmaking is a mess right now. I'm not sure if it's something wrong in the code or just from a small playerbase (for me at least), but I'm seeing reds and yellows in the same match and that's silly.
---
I have this sometimes. For me it‚Äôs the need to win. Sometimes I need to just remind myself it‚Äôs just a game, you‚Äôll win some and you‚Äôll lose some. Coming across toxic survivors doesn‚Äôt help mind.
---
Usually when I start to feel tence in a match, I take a deep breath a couple of times and try to think calmly. Hope that helps
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d6qvg8/find_the_bug_in_this_picture/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Well the same may be said for the killer side to be gen rushed, is your some what forced to run around in a hopeless attempt and basically waste 5 mins, this could be due to killer skill, but it still can feel pretty bad
---
If that Steve was a beginner and already started DCing without waiting for the game to end, he's probably already just as battle-weary as the rest of us mid to low tier survivors üòÇ
---
Simply force yourself to use top tier perks in its slot and give yourself time to get accustomed to not using it.
---
I do not know the killers you play to suggest builds for to remove it from your loadout, I play most of the killers except Wraith, Freddy and Demogorgon, simply because they're not levelled up.
---
now that is very interesting.
---
I feel like Bioshock has had way too much worldbuilding to be added to a series like this
---
He‚Äôs on PS4, IIRC BHVR can‚Äôt do shit about consoles. Or so it was when I last played on PS4.
---
Why would they remove that? It‚Äôs integral to the perk!
---
Well big rule as a killer is not to chase a single person for more than a couple
---
Minutes
---
Maybe they just prefer the game to be ugly.
---
When the killer has knockout and you can‚Äôt see the downed survivor
---
Correction, he does not slow down while charging his throw, he slows down while actually throwing the bottle, and this is a guess but I think he also slows down while cancelling a throw.
---
Not a ‚Äúrule‚Äù more like a tip.
---
I know, right? But I guess sassy killermains^tm always win.
---
Yeah played killer for like the first time in ever and my first match was against all survivor's lower than rank 10 while I'm rank 20
---
If I know there are survivors nearby I‚Äôm going to try to bait the hook, that‚Äôs just the way it is kiddo
---
Cool style my guy, got anymore?
---
They didn‚Äôt say anything about 11 being the third survivor......back to the Upsidedown you go!!!
---
Sorry to hear that, I got this too but I am rank 14 killer
---
Yeah didn't do to bad though got 2 kills and almost 3
---
You have to realize that the sub is ran by rank 20s who have absolutely no game knowledge. They probably have no idea about seeingthe red stain through walls.
---
Bill would be proud
---
Upvoting for the second paragraph alone.
---
Dude is a joke
---
Cool, forgot how his last name was spelled, but yeah, his spliced up self would be the other option, not Andrew Ryan.
---
People can now get banned on console and there is a report option.
---
This is actually a really bad tip if you consider the 4k a win condition &amp; not the "double pip" that a lot of esports enthusiasts care about.
---
It's crucial to execute someone early in the match so that you have 1 less person doing gens. Once that first person dies it's a lot harder to do gens. Once two are dead, it's basically over.
---
I just walk around and smash the "pick up survivor" button lol
---
agreed
---
Not all heroes wear capes &lt;3
---
 /ban Spoiled_Soul # reason: slacking off
---
As a survivor, you have a third person camera, your mistakes don‚Äôt really matter, there are three different people to get the job done. There are also stressful moments of chase and relaxing/boring moments of being hooked/working on a gen
---
As the killer you have a claustrophobic first person view, you are alone, gens are constantly being done, each mistake costs you precious pressure and time. Not to mention the fact that you have to constantly think what perks the survivor in front of you might have.
---
Ah nice.
---
I‚Äôm kinda new to this game, but why have M&amp;A on huntress?
---
probably a SWF
---
My every match looks like that
---
.....that is the joke
---
Yo why are hooks in the game just let survivors walk out of an open gate immediately sksksksksk
---
But trying to kill and tunnel one survivor until death to try and execute one person is a bad idea. Especially in the red ranks. People run ds and bt for anti tunnel measures. You could easily chase one good survivor the entire game without realizing  it.
---
If it's like the frog in Nioh, then I'd play it, unless it's a giant monster frog that eats the survivor in the mori.

This truly sucks to hear and here was me going to pickup a PS4 to play DBD with you and the gang. Unsure if I‚Äôd even want to now.

This is the greatest and most accurate thing I've ever seen that I partake in every fucking time.
---
Noooooo I'm going to be on a cruise for almost that entire event :-(
---
It‚Äôs mostly just a way of spicing up gameplay rather than having any real value.  A 4 man no mother sabo build is honestly extremely fun and can be really strong.  You can just sabo and recover endlessly, but it‚Äôs super hard to pull off.
---
Their at least 18 bhvr don't like using people under 18.
---
Focus on smaller and easier achieved goals. Don't enter the game having a "plan" to 4k. Have a plan "To find and hook 1st survivor ASAP". Then change this plan to "To get 4 BBQ stacks ASAP", then to "Get some more hooks and maybe a kill or two... or four". And be prepared for a failure... it's ok to lose sometimes (in a perfectly balanced game with perfectly balanced matchmaking your winrate would be 50%)
---
I try the deep breathing or turning music down low enough to still hear the game

Haha lil bieeetch got served

And I don't use Iridescent Heads on Huntress because my aim sucks. I can still use it, but doing so comes at a risk for gaining that much power.

Same idea. A massive power boost in having an unstoppable chainsaw, at a cost of it being an unstoppable chainsaw.

Then he tries to help them anyway omg he‚Äôs so cute

---
Honestly nothing. I don‚Äôt teabag or emote (not even at exit gates). Before this clip i ran him for a single pallet maybe 8-10 seconds before i got a slam and he broke it. He stabbed me around the shed and the sprint burst from the attack is where this clip starts.
---
Just reading this gave me pure anxiety, thank you for making my fears solid though, it's helps to rationalize my thoughts
---
So, in the past week we had Akame ga Kill, DnD and Sydney Watson memes. What's next?
---
i came here to laugh not to feel
---
It's still pretty one sided from what I can tell. I doubt survivers will ever treat killers better than they do now.
---
Haven‚Äôt had any problems myself and neither has anyone else I know. Are you sure it‚Äôs not problems on your end?
---
Never didn't realize they changed second wind since ptb. They took terror radius but made it take longer to heal .
---
Why do you need any justification other than that you hate playing without it? Anything that makes you less comfortable is not good long-term. Maybe your results will be somewhat better, but you'll play less, because you don't feel as comfortable as with Shadowborn.
---
sounds like the other survivor provoked him
---
?
---
At first I read you say "I was the trapper", that would be a twist..
---
And the killer is supposed to be a power role what‚Äôs he problem?
---
Awesome play but did you survive?
---
did any of the other survivors provoke them?
---
I hear the up music turning sad
---
I'm significantly better at survivor too cause dealing with survivors 10 ranks above me who are teabagging and flashligjting the entire time as killer just doesn't make me want to play long enough to get good
---
The game just started and i was the first hook, it didn‚Äôt look like any other survivors did anything.
---
Respected video game developer? My ass.
---
Mcote is a fucking push over.
---
I use that when I go against a super terrible killer so I have the chance to go against them again üòÇ
---
Again, Seriously?
---
As well as Surveillance and Discordance to go for gen grabs as well as OP loop stopping.
---
How
---
This.
---
Giving someone a no after you down them is usually in response to some BM
---
Pure skill
---
It might feel bad (I know I hate it) but what else should the survivors do? Literally their only goal is to get gens, open gate, escape. The could do bones or scout for hatch, but neither is guaranteed to be valuable. 
---
As far as feeling bad I break it down by BP, a survivor getting tunneled would be lucky to break 10k, but even a gen rushed killer should be able to make it out with 20k+... although I‚Äôm only considering ranks 11-20, as that‚Äôs my personal experience. So even if you feel bad you‚Äôre at least most of the way through a blood web.
---
What if it'll help you take a hit after the rescue?
---
Every. Fucking. Time.
---
This breaks my heart every time, their begging is so cute :3
---
wow. You really didn't listen to a word I said. Bravo.
---
"Oh fuck theres another one"
---
So make it something that's an actual struggle instead of something easily avoided with a macro. Spamming spacebar is neither fun nor is it truly representative of "struggling."
---
*shrugs*
---
I eightht this
---
At the end of the game one of the screens have emblems for how you did in the game as survivor they are lightbringer, boldness, benevolent, and survival, or something like that. Depend on how you do in those categories you will either pip, you gain enough to get a little marker on the bottom of that screen or depip, meaning you loose one. You need 4 of them to rank up.
---
was it really? that's harsh lmao
---
Ease it out by using monitor and abuse
---
I personally don't give a damn about it. Like, oooh you can press the CTRL button, good for you buddy!
---
Doing gens is no prob like another comment I made, I'm more talking perk builds plus toll box plus sad.
---
Make Your Choice is incredible on Demo

---
This game is super stressful as killer. Yer not alone. You throw in constant swf groups and it makes you question your sanity.

Just make it so if they miss they are stunned for a second as they regain their balance, and (maybe) make enduring work with it. You can bait people into swinging like people do with dead hard.

After you get used to the game, you can kinda tell how far she is by paying attention to the timing of her humming compared to her terror radius. Messing with that throws survivors off.

Are you picking on me.

Yeah but he's also the type of person to DC because he got hit with decisive strike, so who knows
---
Nah some killers just do that shit after they got ran around for awhile.
---
That's why I've grown to hate a lot fo killers
---
I like when I kill all 4 and they rain me in salt and friend requests.
---
wait I just realized adept myers isn't doable):
---
15 seconds* if you don't get a hit or a good dropped you're wasting too much time.
---
Well the reason they do that Is out of the personal trauma that name brings. A master meg looper can win the game alone. So they feel a real need to get you out coz it‚Äôs not a risk worth taking for them
---
They Mori so they don't have to keep hearing him scream
---
Yes, but what if we nerfed the pig instead?
---
I actually use this, not as often as I should. I like to use it to thank the killer if he didn't camp/tunnel and had real skill (ps4). I know they dont know I did it, but it's my special "thanks" and im going to continue to do it.
---
Blur out the names then reupload.

That's almost enough to make a man D/C.

He‚Äôs already the best killer.. let‚Äôs not get too crazy now

I might be wrong, but when you throw a hatchet and NOED is activated, the survivors get a warning saying they're exposed.

Merciful killer üòç

It's kinda funny how the bullying survivor mains treat m1 killers like this, then complain they keep going up against nurse and spirit. Like y u think?

Playing with the things the game gives you is not toxic whatsoever. The behaviour ingame is what makes someone toxic

What do they look like to colorblind ppl now? I had a neon green shirt and my friend always said it as the color of a banana. That's how he found out he was colorblind.
---
Shop smart. Shop s-mart
---
#HELL YES
---
Forcing the killer to play something they don‚Äôt necessarily want is just a baaaad idea.. I wouldn‚Äôt complain as a survivor, but killers gotta enjoy the game too :/
---
That we actually have such uber-safe jungle gyms and that two or three tile sets can be connected to be safe independently and together is why gen "rushing" feels like such a hassle, isn't it?
---
Sure a generator takes about 60 seconds (toolbox + repair speed addon), but any survivor can just return to these tiles if you break off them, making your first down a huge waste of time, 'cause the generators are already started before your first chase, it's really easy for three to pop before you're 30 seconds into chasing one survivor.
---
I feel incomplete when this happens. Then I turn into a volcano.
---
&gt; turning music down low enough to still hear the game
---
You play the killer while listening to music? Wow. Your hearing is way better than mine. If you'll tell me you're Spirit main my mind will be completely blown
---
Honest thought though, maybe if you use deliverance or just hit the 4%, it doesn‚Äôt set off the trap.. or deliverance can give a borrowed time effect to discourage face-camping?
---
It‚Äôs a bad way of saying compensation.
---
Here‚Äôs 5000 blood points for your shitty item!
---
BHVR stated that no mither is actually a challenge perk, because they know it‚Äôs not a perk that surv use because it‚Äôs bad. Use it if you want to challenge your skills ingame
---
It‚Äôs one of his add-ons.
---
That's possible. It's never come to my attention before tho and I play huntress often
---
I only recently started playing dbd again as survivor. Forgot all controls (console) and it was still my very first day playing again (got to rank 17); already got camped, purposely unhooked while killer stands in front of the hook (twice the same game), got called a noob and to go bk to fortnite all by the same person.
---
I really don't understand those people.
---
Seems like a crime to be a "noob" at "noob ranks".
---
I still want to play and get better again but sadly already feel discouraged to do so.
---
Does the overall hate get better or worse at higher ranks?
---
Yes!
---
pcmasterrace ü§ù consoles
---
I‚Äôm not sure how this makes it usable. If you‚Äôre a somewhat decent killer, you should be able to down the person before ever needing Tinkerer to go off. 
---
When tinkerer goes off, they‚Äôve basically almost finished a generator, so that‚Äôs up to 5 times you can use this in a game. 5 downs is not enough pressure when gens are popping off. This is also under the assumption that you‚Äôre against survivors who group gens together and they go off semi regularly.
---
If you‚Äôre taking ages downing someone in a chase, efficient survivors in the mean time are working on 3 separate gens, which is 3 uses of tinkerer in one chase to get one down worst case scenario. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying this build may not be fun to try, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a fun play style but I wouldn‚Äôt say it makes Frank‚Äôs Mixtape useful. As soon as you get to higher ranks, it‚Äôs going to do basically nothing if the survivors are playing well.
---
Alright Mccote is drunk
---
I get that some swf groups are like that, but is trying to win and playing efficently considered toxic these days?
---
tbh I still think nurse is the best on console. She's not as good as she is on pc and much harder though
---
I mean yeah. Not saying it's a good idea, just that that might be what's hes saying/his reasoning. I csnt imagine trying to play this game for real with actual music playing lol.
---
My SWF is normally 1 red, 2 purples with either a green or yellow and we mostly get green to yelllow rank killers. Feels bad
---
 It's an ultra rare add on.
---
I wish they buffed him a little more.
---
&gt; because it makes it significantly easier to beat the killer
---
If that's the goal. If their goal is to have fun playing with friends, swf might be easier to beat than 4 randoms
---
Hah i could deal with that it wouldnt be easy but possible
---
You think that. But that is one free stun from a killer pickup that the killer flat out couldn't prevent.  Resulting in the survivor the killer was picking up going free.
---
This is the reason why I don't use dead hard. You used it perfectly and he hit you anyway. Shit perk!
---
And very nice, this guy is a little bitch. But next time he will wait just a second more. Maybe they should add that the timer will stop in dying state or when being chased or something like that.
---
I know the perk is still strong, but we need something for people like him
---
Ouch my feelings bro
---
Happened to me just today, I put the game down after that, need some time to de-salt
---
The gens fully running and they are still able to work on it?
---
I can't even watch streamers who play the game with music on :D It's just so distracting for me.
---
Oh no, don‚Äôt want that, guess I‚Äôll just run in a line in the open then, golly I‚Äôm so happy to survive the killer with such skill
---
Dedicated servers will make the disconnecting issues easier to handle but they got delayed till fall
---
Haha just saying bro üòÇ this whole game is sounds at a certain points. Cant rely on vision for a lot of points.
---
Speaking of ebony moris and nurses, I had a game where I was playing against a 4 man swf. They were all carrying flashlights. Needless to say I slapped on a ebony mori for the memes.
---
I downed the first survivor after hooking him once and all three rushed to get the save. Needless to say, the fucked right off after seeing me choke a bitch.  
---
After the game, I added on of them and they were all pretty mad. They asked if I would let them get the hatch at the end of the game, cause they weren‚Äôt being toxic. My response ‚Äúfour flashlights.
---
u/LittleTaryn
---
For me personal if they would fix the Blood points for survivors and add a REAL ranking system that works, they could add something like you have a SWF debuff and work slower on gens over have to do an additional gen. But this game is broken in too many things to do that
---
Okaaay buddy, time to put away the rage boner
---
Because it isnt fun for any party involved except assholes. Oh, there is a completley inexperienced killer who doesnt know wtf to do? Lets duke him so bad he doesnt want to play the game anymore, same goes for survivors. And if someone is experienced and see them struggling where is the fun in beating a baby in a fistfigth when they cant figth back because they dont know how to? Ofc if you are a dick then you probobly enjoy that, but thats just sad
---
New perks tend to change what people run, with inner strength being released, people are bringing small game to find totems easier, which in turn means less people are running NOED, Devour and sometimes even Ruin. If the perk continues to be popular, maybe people start bringing Iron Maiden to completely counter the perk. 
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say here is that if this perk was added to the game, yes it‚Äôd be powerful, but it would also result in people running perks to counter it like Infectious Fright. I can understand why you‚Äôre worried, but using an entire perk slot for ONE stun that potentially can save a teammate? At worst, just drop the survivor when you see the other one get close to you, you‚Äôd be locked in the animation to drop someone and they‚Äôd end up being really close to you, or maybe even wasting their perk if you‚Äôre quick enough.

Just keep tapping m1. It's the first half of the self unhook attempt animation.
---
NO GOD WHY!?
---
Myers is a true american hero
---
Casual m1 killers need some sort of power to counter such loops. Sure trapper has his traps but he doesn't have the mobility to access them and they arent consistent, wraith's cloak is only usefull on very specific loops, leatherdad is heavily dependent on his as addons and even then if a survivor plays decent'ish he won't even be able to use his saw, legion can literally do nothing to stop these loops his ability doesn't help with the chase whatsoever, and the same goes for plague unless they cleanse which survivors never do.
---
TL;DR: Killers who can't use their power to benefit them in chases is bad game design.
---
he looks pleased
---
Ashley Williams reference with the puppet
---
Hahaha yeah right. How much did you get paid?
---
Literally nothing toxic about flashlight blinding and teabagging. If you are dumb enough to take the bait then its your fault
---
&gt; In theory No Mither makes you stealthier since it makes it so you no longer leave blood everywhere and you also make less sound while injured. 
---
You make 50% as much sound while injured, except you spend twice as much time (or more) injured. I'm still not really seeing much of a benefit, since nearly every time I get hooked the moment I'm downed anyway.
---
Like, I guess I can see some corner cases where it might have an advantage or two, but a much better advantage is being healthy for the first half of the match.
---
"mah games perfect yer a dern gumd fuul."   Is how I imagine the thoughts went when downvoting.
---
I like to wish the survivors a nice night and try to calm down any arguments they might be having.
---
Makes the game feel just a bit less toxic.
---
I was gunna say you have no life but I don't either lmao
---
DS is not a safety net for fucking up tbh - It's an anti tunnel perk.
---
Any killer with half a brain won't pick you up though, So it doesn't work against those who aren't intentionally tunneling.
---
The strength of the perk is completely on the killers decision making.
---
&gt;nerf to the meta perks like Adrenaline
---
It is abit of bullshit perk but then so is Noed and Adrenaline won't save you from Noed.
---
I don't think we should be focusing on nerfing it, It's a good perk but it doesn't help that there is so many practically useless ones.
---
&gt;nerf to the meta perks like Self-Care
---
I feel like the perk is already shitty anyway. It literally exists so you can heal yourself when your teamwork is terrible.
---
It's by no means a good perk to a team who are working together.
---
It‚Äôs actually good. The game is in the state it probably should‚Äôve been at launch now.

Feng Mins

They're fucking toxic 90% of the time and I want to hook them as soon as I see one
---
* Screenshots highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).

I‚Äôll just keep chasing the one good looper because it‚Äôs a pride thing i feel like a punk if I leave them to check on gens. I know it‚Äôs not smart but that‚Äôs how I feel lol
---
When you and the boys bring your little brother
---
We must protect the Baby Dwight's. If I see a legitimate baby dwight I always give them a fun chase with a hopeful pallet stun &amp; try my best let them live after being hooked.
---
It's just too easy to get a terrible first impression because you don't know what's going on &amp; never play again.
---
Typically if I know I'm capable of getting a 4k in a match, and the last survivor wasn't toxic and/or put up a decent fight I'll let them escape, or try to let them escape. Some survivors don't understand the concept of me living them up and taking them to the hatch, or letting them struggle off my shoulder in front of the exit gate.
---
Go to the YouTube channel called 'Not otzdarva' watch his videos, he does guides for all kinds of game aspects. I'm only saying this because of whispers 1 in your build.
---
Well he's always judging people and putting on an act, you could get some neat perks out of that, but ability wise no clue either
---
I'm level 11 on billy. I dobt have anything better atm lol

I can‚Äôt have people harassing him, even if what he did was wrong.

r/wooshception
---
Good load out for inner strength: detective instinct (or whatever its called), quick and quiet, head on and inner strength
---
Yeah the match making if horrible  right now. Last time I played killer  the highest rank ( ?) Was 8 everyone else was lower then that. I'm  rank 18 as killer. So my choices are play as survivor  and wait at least 15 minutes to play or pla yuh as killer and  get tea bagged and constantly  blinded by asshole survivors.
---
Just saying. Level 1 whispers is one of the very few perks that is worthless on that level.
---
So let me get this straight, a nurse has problems finding people. If you find a person, especially with swf, they are most likely with a buddy. If you down then they will co ordinate with their buddies to get that blind. The only way to counter that is to either face a wall or bait them into a save.
---
But ALL Four members had a flashlight. So you really could only do those counters once as they will learn. so I had to put on a mori to at least have some chance of winning.
---
Just a heads up the meme is "Fuze elbow dropping the hostage".
---
I still haven't gotten the build I run on Jake and I've already hit 50 on Steve :,(
---
Not to harass, just to dont watch it.
---
The only thing I have other wise is the bird one.
---
Let's do it in a KYF, I can stream/record it.
---
Now they need to find out why there's a considerable frame rate drop when playing the demogorgon.
---
He‚Äôs like Hags big brother and Freddy‚Äôs nightmare.
---
The most useless perk build‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
Neas too with the pink hair
---
It's better. Whispers 1 makes sound and you won't hear the grass move if they're 1 or 2 meters away hiding. The bird one will notify you when survivors that are close scare the bird in your local area.
---
Ngl I would hate it if tony hawk became a survivor. It would not fit at all and just be cheesy.

---
Whispers lights up I thought? On huntress i use it to zone in on people. For billy i use it to sprint across the map and see if it procs
---
I've been playing survivor a bit and the majority of times people DC when they're facing unfun killers with annoying add ons.
---
Pickup animations are fast enough that you can prevent blinds fairly easy. And walls are abundant in most maps. Most of the time when they attempt one of those flashlight saves they will fail and you will have a next person to chase immediatly.
---
I understand that seeing the survivors with 4 flashlights can be concerning. But it really is not such a hassle.
---
What rank nurse are you if I may ask? I've seen almost nothing but domination from nurses at rank 8 - 1.

Idk man I played against a P3 rank 1 nurse one time and the game was over within a minute or two. I don‚Äôt even consider myself a bad survivor either I‚Äôm normally around rank 3
---
adding the ability to sandbag is promoting toxicity, adding a perk that encourages tunneling the obsession then only changing it 2 years later. they specifically added these things to the game and they promote toxicity.
---
well the Problem is he is the only Killer with this limitation, if you ever waste a Portal, its pretty much gone forever and if you want to be prepared for end game you need to save 2 for the doors.
---
Overall its a very unforgiving/unfun mechanic
---
The idea if teabagging is toxic it's there to annoy a killer and distract him. 
---
I do agree if a killer takes the bait from it then they need to rethink themselves playing as killer. But teabagging is definitely toxic.
---
Except I really do enjoy it, killer and survivor (it helps to learn how it feels and better understand loops) that's why I'm trying so hard to get over it, and if it continues, I'll probs just power through. I can't wait till October, for the spook event.
---
He better get a perk that lets him combo actions together for a point multiplier.
---
Yeah and make sure to keep the spot they looped you in the back of your mind. Some spots feel like it's impossible to catch people in, especially some with long plywood walls and back-to-back windows + a pallet or 2 for good measure.
---
You have to wait until the pick up animation in completely finished
---
its just a way to punishing/unfun mechanic, which would make him a worse Hag with an added lunch by your logic
---
It was they were walking through the pallet gap
---
And here I was being confused because I thought it was Markiplier.
---
I mean I wouldn't even play Spirit, but sometimes I just get really angry after 5th game against another teabagging flashlight clicking SWF that tells me to kill my family after the game I just say fuck it and go with my toxic Spirit build.
---
There's an important difference between hatch and unhook standoffs: hatch standoff had no time limit. You can't wait in front of the hook forever, your teammate will die. So I don't see it as a break of pace
---
And then you find them on the ground next to a window, so instead of picking them up, you vault that window several times.
---
I don't really see how it's trading a hook when you have the ability to just hit whoever was unhooked right after they get unhooked. Also not every survivor brings deadhard so it's not a 100% unhook.
---
yes, Trapper definitley is, and Clown is a low Tier, not the worst, but definitley low.
---
until Trapper gets some heavily needed qol changes he will definitley stay on the lowest rank with Leatherface
---
What killer? I did it to a ghostface the first day if the dlc
---
I remember the second time for me it was the huntress and that was yesterday
---
Alright miyagi, take those mental gymnastics outside.
---
tweet it at the devs right now.
---
GF has no mobility so you need gen slowing perks like PGTW and/or Ruin - thrilling tremors and PGTW combo works well on him. Don't be afraid to use his ability and play like a normal non-stealth killer, it's hard to get him out of his ability so try to utilize it during the chase. Don't crouch, in 90% of situations, you won't need it, only when you're being exposed from a place with no high walls you can go around.
---
I made a typo in my post. I was talking about throwing hatches not closing the hatch.
---
I run Deerstalker on nurse because I'm scared if losing slugs and looking like an idiot
---
Thank you for the information. This wasn't something I knew
---
Seriously tho
---
It feels like a win to me if it was a full SWF stack.
---
How much more we're talking?
---
Now she will ignore it, Also she thinked that U can get a weapon and defeat the killer
---
Yh throwing hatchets does tell them you have noed as if you'd downed someone with it
---
Well you can wait a pretty long time. These standoffs tend to last around 15+ seconds and usually just end up with them getting grabbed anyway. At least with this you wouldn't be waiting that long.
---
You have a thing called hit cooldown, you dont have enought time to do 3 hits, a max of 2 and the unhooked surv runs away and unhooker is downed
---
Yo someone said the killer was tunneling while playing today in a game. WTH is that even?
---
Yea, this was purples too, can‚Äôt do it too much, you gotta do it in unpredictable situations too, throws them off.

I feel like you're regurgitating some stuff you saw on survivor v killer balance

---
Don't try to pretend your just not applying yourself. 
---
I'd make a joke about you having a stroke while typing or whatever, but I think you're just stupid. Nothing *temporary* about it.
---
The only time when "tunneling" is actually what the name says is when other survivors try to bodyblock but the killer still refuses to hit them and goes for the unhooked person. I don't like it when that happens, but I don't really complain about it myself
---
I hate it when people on this sub complain about tunneling when the situation doesn't look like I described above. That's the only thing about tunneling that annoys me.
---
You'd partially be right, does that change anything?
---
I returned to play a short time ago, I'm rank 14 yet.  I didn't say the loop doesn't help, I know it's really good (how many times have I escaped from the killer with loops haha), but there is not only this way to escape, so it would be a hardcore first person mode.

Now that you mention it, you're completely right, i got sidetracked with the killer powers instead of focusing on loop layots and their combinations,maps and so on. What i had in mind was not changing the loops or maps themselves but buffing m1 killers so they can mindgame the current loops in some way and have map pressure.
---
The killer was mid animation so the game didn't recognise the pallet so he didn't get stunned
---
I play survivor more than killer and i still disagree with you're assessment... so spare me the "reddit killer" meme shit.
---
A video game is confirmed. Hopefully it carrys on from the Season 3 cliffhanger, that would be an amazing game.
---
I‚Äôm hoping the leaked Ash costume will be releasing to coincide with the Evil Dead game. It seems odd to give him a costume thats in the show for about 30 seconds, so I‚Äôm hoping its a video game tease.

Quick thing DS is not just a anti tunnel perk I've had games where I see a unhook go for the new person down them in a relatively fast chase hook them now the person with DS comes running basically immune goes for the unhook I grab them get DSd like tell me that's anti tunneling bc it is pretty much a free ticket to waste the killers time 
---
Sure you can count to 60 after u down them but in 60 seconds they can get picked up or forces me to waste my time waiting until it's safe
---
really doesn't matter since they're all unsafe. there has to be just 2 pallets on the map where you aren't guaranteed a down if the survivor doesn't stun you with the pallet.
---
&gt;What i had in mind was not changing the loops or maps themselves but buffing m1 killers so they can mindgame the current loops in some way and have map pressure.
---
They absolutely can do that right now- most common tiles are actually quite welcomed. It's a little shitty when on Thompsons there's like 2 safe pallets and 2 junk pallets tied in at either end of a string of 3 jungle gyms all in one cluster. But generally speaking it's there for survivors to exploit and killers to outplay/ force a bad player to waste the pallets on
---
The problem maps are shit where dispersing pressure is nigh pointless because of how quickly survivors can reach a building that will waste shitloads of time. Haddonfield with Balanced Landing, Asylum, horseshit buildings on Coldwind- there are long lists
---
Watch any number of killer streamers (Zubat is one I'd recommend) that makes M1 killers look easy. The tiles I showed in OP are mindgameable, sans maybe the long wall jungle gym which requires some strong arming
---
Looks like i'll be ded'ardin all over Balanced Landing's grace.

Ikr, Spirit makes me laugh when I see her, so fun to play against and hella loopable, every time I see her I know it's a guaranteed win. Makes me actually feel like I can outplay as survivor and makes me want to play more survivor games against Spirit.
---
Running No Mither also signals that you're not here to fuck up a Killer's day. You're not gonna be some untouchable god of loops, you're very mortal
---
Ngl, I usually have a blast when the bully can curve. It changes a lot of ways as to how you view the game and how loops change
---
I think a lot of killer mains drastically overestimate the swf communication. Of course there are some people who play super tryhard but between me and my friends and most other people I know, it‚Äôs just ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs a spirit. Anyway, so I was watching this movie.... blah blah‚Äù If anything, I play much better when I‚Äôm playing solo because I only have the game to focus on, and no other noises from people talking or stuff in the background in their houses etc. I definitely die more in swf than solo, because of the distractions and because I‚Äôm just trying to have fun with friends, we do a lot of silly stuff that I would never do in solo that wastes time from doing gens and playing normally
---
It‚Äôs not bullying in any way, the same as a killer winning chases quickly or stopping gen progression etc is not bullying. It‚Äôs not toxic to play well on either side.

They kill you, because it‚Äôs company policy to wear the hat..

A good killer is able to apply pressure on the map as much as possible
---
A good killer is able to understand when a chase is going on for too long

A good killer is able to know tricks that help them at chases *especially true for huntress*

I could go on for like 4-7 more lines you get the point

It would help if the matchmaking wasn't such complete garbage.
---
SWF red ranks get matched with rank 15-20 killers.

The worst is when you do that but you're actually next to a window and you accidently vault over it
---
I swear if they didn't all bleed out

Was it *just* being toxic though? From my prespective, he perfectly timed your Dead Hard, and him being the superior intellectual, he was aware you had the perk, so he waited PRECISELY 60 seconds to wait for your Dead Hard run out, which if you review the clip, *it did*, however, you still were able to dead hard out of it despite that your window of opportunity ran out, because the game is shit and buggy. Hence his justified ragequit.
---
Totally havent done that before. I was playing trapper and a person bled to death because I could t find the the whole match
---
Has Huntress always been able to down with the Exposed status with her hatchets? Aside from Iri Heads, I though status effects don't apply to powers.

Do people not use their  ears????  I've never lost the general area of a slugged survivor.
---
&gt;Starting at rank 20 killers slash you while you're on the hook and so on.
---
They doit because they dont understand the rules of the game IMO, that those slashes dont matter. Source: that's what I did and thought my first time.
---
Meanwhile nurse mains KEKW
---
Yo could you imagine, his power he takes over a survivor for some time and that's how he attacks everyone else, through his prey.
---
Well that sounds better then when I quit, I forget, did the micmillen estate map with the large factory building in the middle get changed?
---
Cause that's where I decided to quit, one survivor looped me endlessly there without needing pallets as doctor, my fav killer, don't want another experience like that again.
---
Which ever one I hit first/is closer to me before and after the hit. I usually don't prioritize anyone unless there is a Key.
---
What is this?
---
I came here for salt and got sugar

Bleh. How am I supposed to eat my fries with that?

Demogorgon is a decent Killer. Good map control if you keep your portals up, and the Shred is good for narrow hallways or lunging at pallets. He needs slowdown perks though. Good loopers can stall long enough to get good time on gens.

But the speed boost of Adrenaline would have given him the speed to get away. You couldn't use sprint burst since he was already Exhausted from Head On, so Adrenaline is the only option to get the speed boost.
---
It would have cost you exactly $0 to not say that
---
Nah, that's when you pick Nurse, and occasionally Spirit. Spirit can still be looped sometimes. Bringing a mori doesn't hurt too, especially if the survivors are swf of 3-4 people all with thousands of hours, and you'll know they are all gonna rush gens in 5 minutes.
---
I hate snotty Dumbasses like this Ghostface.
---
It's a lot harder lol, I can do it for lile 2 seconds max and then I spin back to normal.
---
I want to be real here. A lot of people can always hear survivors do different things. I've heard from people that they even can hear survivors run on maps that aren't the bog. I have some really nice pair of headphones and for the life of me I can't hear that. Either the chase music is wicked loud or a gen almost repaired is as loud as a car crash. Is this other people also or is there something I'm doing wrong or something?
---
I would melt, using that much.
---
Muh brain iz brokenz.
---
The only sad part is you thinking that. That's something to be proud of.
---
Op and his alt downvoting your comment
---
It should be auto-detect on portals, extending the sealing time significantly, or making portals indestructible. Of course, the last one would be very detrimental to Demo if he doesn't put them in good places.
---
Thats the best Meme i¬¥ve seen today, well done xD
---
Is this real life?
---
Waiting out DS isn‚Äôt toxic. 
---
Immediately returning to the hook and downing the injured survivor can be considered toxic, depending on your point of view. (The returning after injuring the Nancy part is what I would say is kinda fucked up.)
---
Teabagging for practically the entire DS tuner is what pushed it over the toxic edge.
---
I honestly disagree with that. The community in this game would die pretty quickly if people couldn't play it with their friends. No community means no more updates.
---
Now a blanket debuff to action speed or something to help could work, but removing SWF is absolutely a terrible idea for the health of the game and would lead to killing it quicker than anything else.
---
Now that they've broken the rule of never having non-humans, they could do a killer based on the Creature from the Black Lagoon or something based on Lovecraft...although they could have a normal Innsmouth resident as a killer with a horrible fish-face.
---
Yeah but it is pretty much impossible to max out both in one game without farming or u doing everything
---
Freddy can teleport at any point. Demo can't teleport unless he's standing on a portal and has to have another portal to go to. Freddy's teleport is a bit better.
---
Stupid got what he deserved
---
Damn bro ur good
---
I would go on a five paragraph rant about how toxic SWF (not all SWF) is a stain on the community but you're obviously not gonna change so there's no point.

The only few times I got Gosthface 2 times they were both memes with an ebony mori they didn't use at all. I'm also a good friend of one of them
---
Most nurses are fun to play against as a survivor -  as they haven't mastered the blink, therefore you can play running mind games. However, I have meant a couple of insanely good console nurses. It is rare, but once they have that skill, you just know the game is going nowhere.
---
Legend.
---
Yeah you're right it sucks. Everyone was so excited for it yet the stranger things dlc has caused more harm than good
---
In my short experience, it's because a lot of more experienced survivors who are toxic now play Steve.
---
Ha, that's me
---
The worst feeling I when the loud ass injured survivor hides around a corner during a chase and I run around the corner, see them in my peripheral then just keep running
---
Also fix the problem where she gets stuck after blinking so if you want to land one hit you gotta swing blindly
---
Who tf dcs for fog?
---
Less than a second off
---
bullshit right? to me those look like the most pointless offers
---
Really annoying to play with since you know the survs are gonna do nothing but hide, and the game is not worth playing vs people who just sneak around
---
Yea I hade one to escape with a new item and when I got back to the lobby it was unhooks with jake
---
David's perk called "we're gonna live forever" gives you a 25% BP bonus every time you safely unhook or take a hit for someone. Also, don't hesitate to use offerings!
---
Fucking yesss, all my mates thought it was weird when i said i struggle with chases and always lose people, "why dont you follow the red blobs/lines on the dark green floor and walls?" Wellll, i would if i could see them, sucks having to take bloodhound just to have a chance in a chase
---
Can live with that, it's a drug and some people don't know when to stop xD
---
The only way they were gonna get me to cough up real dough for a cosmetic was the scoops ahoy outfit.
---
R.I.P. P3 Cuntette; you will be missed.
---
If your a fan your just happy to see references
---
They removed the switch because of the multiple killers exploit
---
I was told, once that happens, you can only escape through the hatch. Otherwise you‚Äôll continue to keep fall of the map over and over.
---
Ikr, if I wanted kettle corn I woulda made that. Buttery+sugary is no bueno
---
I mean i have a duo partner who is a green rank not full 4 man swf and we just ask randoms if they have an murky offering but im not a toxic survivor. Im more against toxicity like tru3 but killers who has over 1.5k hours just face camps people which is beyond pathetic.
---
hmmm this can be viewed as a form of neglect or child abuse...
---
NEW KILLER:Tony hawk
---
The fact of the matter is you won't get as much BP for survivors as you can get killers. Since you are new to DBD I'd say just learn the basics there are many good informative videos out there.  
---
Since you want to know the best way to get blood points it is just playing safe do gens try not to get spotted and knowing how to play loops in a safe way and not to be greedy. Doing totems even if they aren't hex totems gives 1k BP safe hook rescues are also smart.   
---
But I am gonna just be general and tell you to learn how to play and worry about BP later.
---
For me it's been Temple of Purgation, and also Badham.
---
Where are all the blue fengs like you in my games?

All of mine just tbag
---
Friday 13th? Hide or Die? The Last Year?
---
Lol his hand was getting tired from all the teabagging, it was going slower
---
How long did it take you to farm those mom stacks.
---
Legion skin?
---
ig they wanted to revamp it or maybe upping the trapping speed made the original animation look janky and weird? dunno
---
Pretty new player never done a blood hunt before is there a universal sign people use to say they're farming?
---
And also would this be a good time to go for adept killer achievements?
---
Dude I'm telling you from 2 years of experience. If you haven't played on PC, then you have absolutely zero input in this discussion and anything you say is simply your own interpretation. From a previous comment I've made:
---
When I was on a lengthy work trip I decided to pick up DBD for my PS4.
---
The skill gap is absolutely tremendous. I climbed to Rank 1 killer very quickly on PS4, when my highest killer rank on PC was only rank 6~ or so at the time. I don't think survivors were very used to mindgames, most likely because it's a bit harder to loop while looking behind you. When I switched to survivor, the climb was harder due to more frequent camping and lower quality teammates, but definitely easier than PC. A lot of loops could be ran for quite a long time as killer movement was not as precise.
---
Also, PC gets Nurse players.
---
Oh no doubt I wasn‚Äôt trying to say all swfs are trying to destroy the killer I was just saying most people see swf and instantly assume that
---
Spirit + hex ruin + BBQ &amp; Chilli + Nurses Calling = A very bad time for thw two level 20 megs that are somehow in my game
---
prestiging is more if you wanna be a completionist if you aren't after that then don't do it
---
The in game tutorials teach you the basics, but a lot of the meta (strategies used by most players) is very different. Look around here to see how people play, and learn the language. Terms like tunneling, face-camping, swf, all of those can seem daunting, but you can pick it up pretty quickly. 
---
To explain those quickly by the way, Tunneling is when a killer focuses one survivor relentlessly. Face-camping is when a killer stays right on a survivor who has been hooked, and swf is Survive With Friends, the term for survivors grouping up. Solo will often be used to describe  playing survivor on your on, with randoms.
---
Dude next killer is totally Ted Mosbey
---
Went up against a plag with the same mo couple hours ago.
---
Typical killers
---
In the original video the kids laughing his ass off, he‚Äôs just having fun with his sister
---
For the note, it's not just a soldier, it's Fuze doing what he does best &gt;!killing hostage!&lt;
---
doctor he is fun and good perks
---
Yeah cause killers can never be toxic foh.
---
Haven‚Äôt played a game where I didn‚Äôt see it
---
everything about your comment concerns me
---
Maybe 2% speed increase?
---
So that‚Äôs how they do it
---
He‚Äôs wearing it in his banner art for the outfit too
---
Why because they work together?
---
You need to get David to either level 30, 35 or 40 and buy the teachable perk on the bloodweb. It'll come up as orange. After this you can unlock it on other survivors like a normal perk
---
I'd argue just give an FOV Slider and rework Shadowborn more but if you're talking the game as it is, then Wraith needs the spees of Green Windstorm by default then have his other speed ones increase him further, he needs love man.
---
Thank you, I started not too long ago and I do decently well, but I wanna earn more BP
---
I missed it on the shrine a few weeks ago, I'm so sad :'(
---
Make your choice, stbfl, territorial imperative and BBQ(or ruin(or pgtw)), hook a survivor in the basement and watch as they realise they can‚Äôt escape
---
The Devs have said they plan on making the DC‚Äôd Survivor remain in the game as a ‚Äúhusk‚Äù which can be hooked, no word on when that will be yet but it‚Äôll be after the Dedicated Servers.
---
wtf?
---
I mean there‚Äôs a difference between 4 fandoms working together without voice comms vs 4 people who do, and usually the system is abused with 1 low rank and 3 high ranks, i played the other day against rank 2/4s and one rank 14 and I‚Äôm rank 15 killer, what do I even do in this situation?
---
Lmaoo
---
Ehhhh that's 3/4 of a gens worth of time I've gotta say that's not a great play.
---
Oooh okay.. wow haha thanks!!
---
Really?They are actually trying to fix it? Huh. Well, good on them!
---
Nah but seriously if you want to get the most bp out of a game just play killer.
---
You have to heal the equivalent of one full health state, if someone else helps heal them then it doesn't proc. At least it didn't for me but then when I did the tiny amount that I didn't heal solo on another person, it procced
---
I dunno I think its a good tool for distraction. I guess you could say its toxic if you are just trolling but if you are doing i to get attention away from your friends/ other survivors then I think its fair game to do. I dont even do it tbh cause im terrible in a chase but my friends have saved me by doing it before.
---
Based. Haddonfield won't be such a pain for killers anymore.
---
Killer is hard :c
---
We actually had situation in my early days where enemy Fuze fuzed hostage room with all of us inside, all defenders dead and hostage only injured.
---
I still don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs been dark for hours, and I just got back from eating dinner with my friends. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure where you usually play football, but I usually don‚Äôt play on random dark sidewalks.
---
Idk why but I end up giving my items to Steve‚Äôs 90% of the time
---
So am i
---
Maybe you could see a survivors aura if they are being chased while injured? I would think they would need a warning though.
---
Literally me last night

Good job hookers

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d6tiga/mm_bug_sometimes_when_i_hook_a_survivor_my_game/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I'm getting decent at running, but I'm still not seeing opportunities to fake vault. Would I be right that the killer needs to be basically max lunge distance, turn sharply towards the window, then continue running in the original direction?  Then you are looking to use the killers cooldown on miss to make new space?
---
‚ÄúFor each vault action, pallet stun (etc)  in a chase gain a stack. Each stack gives you a 10% stackable bonus for boldness points up to 100%. Gain 0.5% increased vault speed and pallet throw speed for each stack up to 5%. Lose 1 stack for every 10 seconds not in the killer‚Äôs terror radius (or not in a chase)‚Äù  
---
Change WGLF to give altruism bonus only and an actual benefit, add one for survival and objective. Change BBQ to sacrifice points, add brutality, deviousness, and hunter equivalents. Then finally boost base BP gain by 50% and max to 12k.  
---
I hate that nothing like this will ever happen.
---
Forgot Leatherface existed ‚Äòcause no one plays him, clown‚Äôs decent, and amazing with add ons, and Trapper is mid tier.
---
I think those spec ops groups are a lot more memorable for killers honestly people get hung up on the losses for some reason
---
Dailies are good but killers just earn more
---
But kate has nice skins
---
Grow up dude.
---
Imagine Surge on infinite tier 3 myers, dead rabbit, distressing, Infectious Fright...
---
Or on Distressing Doctor.
---
True lol
---
I mean more than one killer being in game aka multiple killers ... sorry for the wording.
---
Pick him up before he fricks you up
---
Aww that sounds rly nice and helpful but I‚Äôm on pc! :c
---
I had a totem spawn right outside the wall of the killer shack last night. The hell man.
---
Aww okay tysm!
---
Demo-swatter
---
Then why df did you name your account after his game?
---
In both cases you'll want to do it when you have a big stash of Bloodpoints, so that you're not caught short if your new character pops up in your daily challenges.
---
BP aside, for killers it'll probably the end of the month - ranks will have settled and you'll have a "normal" experience as you try to master their power.
---
Same advice would nominally apply to survivors (at least if you're going for their Adept achievement/trophy) but in truth there's no real "need" to play a new survivor - you can just use your existing main to farm the Bloodpoints to get the perks from your new purchase.
---
In terms of cost, some players wait for sales - there's one on right now for the PC and US/NA PS4, but it's just about to end. The *expectation* is that the PS4 version will also be on sale during Hallowe'en (EU) or the "Sale of the Dead" event (NA).
---
I know this isn't serious but I deeply wish a gremlin would have eaten my eyes before I could see this comment
---
I'm still under 50 hours myself stuck at rank 15, going against obvious smurfs or other survivors somehow with rank 3 perks in all of their slots. I've been watching videos and reading the guides people have suggested for me, but I'm still tunneled nearly every game, having absolutely no idea where the good pallets are that people say I should run to in order to get rid of the killers, thus getting a TON of shit slung my way in the post-lobby for being a "noob" by other players with hundreds of hours played. Like, yeah, no shit?
---
Exactly.
---
Currently. It depends on the killer. But you should be fine with less than 250 ping
---
I wouldn't say hes weak. I think with green add ons and good portal placements he makes it in to B tier. 
---
If they want to buff anything it should be his portals though. His shred is already his strongest ability and does not need any more buffs.
---
Yes, the perspective of the knife is bit too flat. In fact, I think that other part of the drawing is flat in some places. Like with the left legs of both Dwight and Susie. But other than that, I liked how it came out.
---
Dont mind the nurse with add ons. Theres ways to juke her like everyone else. Keep doing you  cheers.
---
Make them rage!!!
---
You legit sicken me ngl.

The fuck would you heal at the hook when you're mangled? Go do a gen.

On one hand im glad this ended as a wholesome, on the other hand

BEHAVIOUR. THIS \*clap\* IS \*clap\* NOT \*clap\* HOW \*clap\* RANKED \*clap\* SHOULD \*clap\* WORK.
---
If you press play game and then decide, oh I actually don‚Äôt want to play the game, you‚Äôre fucking over 3 other players who committed  their time to a game. 
---
  If a survivor disconnects or does any toxic afk behavior it should be punished with a longer suspension, perhaps 30 minutes? Maybe an hour? If you disconnect from more than 1-5 games a day or something like that.
---
We dont do that here... this is REDDIT!

Fr if they stay at the pallet they die.

Clown is *decend* with add ons, making him maybe Mid Tier.

Trapper is only "ok" with his best addons

Lol. You‚Äôre telling me that you expect to see killers running Iron Maiden, Thrill of the Hunt, and Haunted Grounds? Just to counter 1-2 perks that a survivor may have? Lul.
---
I have yet to encounter him as a survivor but he's a lot of fun to play and just has an amazing presence.

Ash himself is only 30% why I main him.

Ashy Slashy takes the other 70%.

He is floating pennywise confirmed

There's loads but 90% of them are garbage.

Quality over quantity.
---
The moment he mentioned Self-Care as a meta perk I lost it lmao  
---
OP's post has to be one of the unintentionally funniest rants I've read on this sub.  
---
I'm all for more bloodpoints, but this guy doesn't know shit about balancing if fuckin' *Self-Care* is at the top of his tier list, and I find it impossible to take his entire post seriously.  
---
He also doesn't seem to understand that the reason the distraction gains so much BP compared to people doing gens is because the distraction is the person on the team who's letting the other do gens, and that person should very obviously be compensated generously for it.
---
Lemme finish my pudding you can wait 10 secs more
---
Nothing will stop Noed, it‚Äôs too strong of a perk for killers to give up unfortunately
---
This can take away all the humanity from you. After a couple of rank resets, it swallows you whole and shits you out as a piece of trash.
---
&gt; *it‚Äôs that she‚Äôs a lot harder to use so most Nurses are awful.*
---
I'd say that's only partially correct. Most consoles Nurses are awful because everyone has been told Nurse is gdlk, and thus they try to use her "as-is".
---
Nurse's main stumbling block on console is the hard cap on controller sensitivity - it's effectively impossible to 180 during a regular Blink, so you can't really do the whole "patrol Blink" thing to the same extent as you can when using mouse.
---
Once a console Nurse gets their hands on decent tracking perks, she's terrifying. The sensitivity issue is also wholly negated by just taking 3-Blink Nurse as standard.
---
*cries in feral frenzy*
---
Isn‚Äôt that toxic behavior then and isn‚Äôt that on BHVR‚Äôs to do list? I honestly think the struggle mechanic should just be removed somehow so you can‚Äôt accidentally kill yourself. Only a few situations I can think it‚Äôs currently useful. 
---
Face Camping killer, or to help team mar get hatch...
---
*Highway Star noises*
---
*high pitched screams emanate from basement*

At least he died do what he loved best: running into spooky underground places for his friends.

The devs actually said it‚Äôs not McCote but someone else who worked there back then

I fear no man.. but this... this scares me
---
You ever just go for a quick hundred meter dash and when you finish go AAAAGGGHHHH AGGHHH as you stare at your hands, the edges of your vision going black?
---
It's Bill's unique teachable perk "Unbreakable" you can use it to pick yourself up from the dying state once
---
bruh moment
---
But that thing*
---
If controller sensitivity had more options then you'd struggle to notice the difference.
---
You can see the truth of this for yourself by using a stock controller setup (that is, no DPI tweaks or custom curves on PC) on both versions.
---
Nope
---
https://youtu.be/APP9lqLssCI
---
It encourages slugging after you‚Äôve just (in most cases) tunneled someone. It‚Äôs not fine. We keep adding/changing these perks to make it so a killer can‚Äôt take advantage of things 100% out of a survivors control (how the killer plays) only to make it so it encourages the killer to play a different way which also ruins the fun for everyone

---
Just the equivalent of a full bar, you can do 1 third on 3 different survivors as long as it totals up. I healed a Meg for 95% of her health and someone helped on the very last bit, didn't proc but when I started healing Larie not long after, it procced after only a bit of the healing.
---
I like you

the world does not deserve baby dwight

thats some real cringe

He's in my notes, let me fix that.

I literally have had to get almost every perk on my killers for it to show, it's definitely a feelsbadman

Honestly, I just have chat hidden most of the time and only enable t if I enjoyed a game and want to give the killer a gg or if the killer was nice and I want to thank them. Other than that chat stays hidden.

Tunneling = going for one survivor over all else.  
---
Going after the unhooked isn't tunneling but it can be seen as a dick move.  HOWEVER.  Let nobody tell you not to do that.  Especially if you didn't get very far before they unhooked.  It's the smart play.  Even if you don't hook them again, downing them punishes the unhooker by screwing their benevolence points and gives you pressure while you chase the unhooker.
---
I‚Äôve given up being a killer main at this point it‚Äôs just that bad

they increased trappers setting speed a long time ago and if the old animation stayed it would be lightning speed trapper or something

No add-ons needed, guaranteed to play against red rank SWFs no matter the killer or rank.

I really want to see who said this unironically. No one, I'm pretty sure, but I'll bite anyway.

Killer bad decisive strike good?

Bruh I seriously cannot play The Underground Complex without feeling like I'm in a dark room with a strobe light.
---
I play on PC and PS4.   
---
Hunter and nurse are so much better on PC. My first climb to rank 1 in PC took a while because I had to learn to play against god nurses. On ps4 I laugh at nurses.
---
The excuse, outside of the f13 game, is that the license is in legal purgatory right now. No one can touch the character
---
But what about when there are two people simultaneously bombing the hook?
---
I'm okay with this.
---
This sub has been flooded with scoops ahoy posts and it's super annoying.

Isn't it grand
---
I completely forgot that its getting its own game. Sad :(

‚ÄúHey guys I met this dog today, he was wearing this weird cone of shame so he was kind of grumpy. 11/10 would still pet though‚Äù

Yeah

Hey thanks. I‚Äôve been playing the game a long time but only just now trying in earnest to do this.

I always thought a jungle gym was an L + L; do those not exist? I thought they did.

DONT TELL THEM!

Nurse‚Äôs real name was Sally Smithson.
---
The hemomancer
---
If you think there's not a swf in every lobby of yours as a killer, you're going to have a bad time. Especially as a killer main, i don't understand how other killers think swf dodging is effective. This game sucks too much as a solo survivor for there to be enough of them that you're going to get a lobby with all 4 solo.
---
Either you are a bad nurse or exclusively go against ones :)
---
I wonder what will happen to red moss
---
Survivors can also double back. Especially when you see the killer has committed to going one direction. .
---
So as confirmation, after the re-work if I hit a survivor and they are pulled into the dream world it‚Äôll count towards the trophy right?

There are a lot of babykillers around lately that do not know better. Either that or it's just dickheads
---
My advice is if they're trying to bait you to go around loops just disengage and go to a gen but I've learned a lot from getting looped for 4937 1/2 gens
---
Killers already get a quitter bonus and a all but guaranteed win for the match as the survivors are downs a person what more can you want?

IMO all that needs to be added is a punishment for the DC'r

Ive seen L + T walls, but Ive never noticed and

 L + L loop

I think I'm the only one who wants a Wolf-Man. Pretty generic in terms of Halloween, but I still think it's a pretty cool concept.

Damn. Looked like nurse. I'm retarded :D
---
They should update their tips and especially their tutorials for the new people coming in
---
I don t camp and tunnel, but i also don t show mercy to steve and Nancy. If somone sandbag steve and Nancy, i won t punish sandbager, i punish steve and Nancy, If they are the last alive, i will try my best to find hatch and deny their escape. Also there is a good chance i will bring mori If i see them, and i never bring mori, because i like bloodpoints,  but i hate stranger things more then i love bloodpoints. While i hate stranger things more then anything, i will say Nancy still has a slight better chance to survive then steve.
---
This is the beginning of some strange hentai.
---
I've had killers waiting out the ds and missing it by a second so many times
---
Yup, I've been lobby the matchmakers job for it and leave the lobby if everyone is is way higher or lower rant than me
---
Yeah, the killer gets 670 points, a less fun game, and basically a win. What more could you want? I would have addressed how to punish them but all my ideas have probably already been proposed soo. It‚Äôs just a way not to screw the remaining players
---
I never said anything about being an asshole or tunnelling because a survivor chooses Steve. That's what an asshole killer would do. 
---
In my short experience, (personal anecdote so only talking for myself) it's the behaviour I come across whilst playing vs steve's.
---
No mither shouldn't exsist
---
Nobody did this sub is just full of super tribalists who have never played the other half of the game so they act like jackasses to try and invalidate each other
---
gotta stack up on ruin and noed
---
In a game last night on Hawkins I was injured and the heartbeat was picking up so I tried to get in a locker but instead I threw down the pallet next to the locker like an asshole.
---
I bought spirit and leather face just because I didnt want to wait for shrine lmao.
---
I don't support anyone DC but I can't blame anyone if they don't want to try their best against for example 5 blink Nurse or P3 Spirit with prayer beads.
---
There will be punishments for DC when dedicated servers come.
---
damn, OP missed an opportunity there
---
I swear I did that I healed a Kate to full health and it didn't activate its frustrating me
---
I play 50/50 and my suggestion for every solo survivor is to not play solo :/ there‚Äôs too much variation in skill levels that having even one person you can depend on can greatly enhance the game for yourself.
---
Tbh freddy is kinda like this.
---
I will never not run Scoops Ahoy, bring it on.
---
some do and some dont, her hatchets can only insta down with addons and bot with perks
---
‚Äòrejokingright?
---
I mean yea personally some gay just go so poorly I can't be asked to keep trying so I usually kill myself on hook unless I see a team m8 running to me but sure it's toxic but what is BHVR gonna do track me "missing the struggle key"
---
The teabagging is definitely toxic as fuck but these two just started healing right next to the hook, I've been been in that situation before. I hook someone, get into a chase and then they hit lithe or balanced landing and rocket across the map so I go back to the hook and find the person who was rescued being healed.
---
The guy deserved it for the teabagging though.
---
You're very welcome. :)

But, I guess it's 2019,and everything is screened / assumed for racism. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôm thinking of buying bubba just for the perk but I really don‚Äôt wanna waste 5 dollars on a killer I won‚Äôt use
---
There's also an actual map designer who thought the pallets on the new map are a good idea. There's also the people who give these people their jobs. :/
---
Not really.. I rarely get facecamped. I do get camped, but that's not the same.
---
I'm not saying this happens often I rarely get DSd anymore but the games where I literally can not do anything about DS and I haven't even tunnel is where I say no this is more than a anti tunneling perk
---
Take away voice chat and ill stop lobby dodging
---
Are you sure she didn't have ANY progress on the heal already? Because when it didn't proc for me, the guy literally only helped on the tiniest miniscule at the end.
---
Well I have seen,,,stranger things.
---
Badum Tssssss
---
I would love a classical looking vampire
---
Nope you‚Äôre right, I just didn‚Äôt think it through all the way üëçüèº
---
If i see a key, i dodge, i don't care if it's SWF or not.
---
Depends on i'm looking at the screen before the match starts ofc. Or if i even see the key in the first place since some surv poses hide the hand, especially since latest update. Most of the time i just ready up ASAP and do something while alt tabbed waiting for the lobby to fill up.

‚ÄúI, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream. A dream to hear Steve‚Äôs moan.‚Äù
---
Oh ok I thought so. I couldnt think of why I wouldn‚Äôt want to eliminate 25% of the survivors production early game.
---
Sorry, wasn't a jab at you. It just seems like everyone in this community is constantly trying to justify going out of their way to be an asshole to other players. I don't get it.
---
I hate other Ghostface players
---
I have quite a lot of full solo lobbies as killer (i sometimes check their profiles)

---
This is why I love the stealthy killers (Amanda/Pig especially) with Ruin and Bamboozle. I actually find Bamboozle more useful than spirit fury because pallets can be destroyed while Windows cannot, and it's incredibly satisfying when you mindgame a survivor and vault right into their face.

No. I found the hatch in the end :)
---
They aren't going to like that much. 
---
To be clear, plenty of Killers don't have victim complexes, but this subreddit seems to be the weenie hut general the victims hang out at.
---
I... I don‚Äôt know what to say
---
In what was is that inconsistency in my logic? I‚Äôm laughing at you so I use laughter faces. I‚Äôm laughing at things that make me laugh and I reply with laughter faces. In what way is the logic behind that inconsistent. However, you said because I was using it when laughing at you (cause you‚Äôre ignorant fool) that meant everyone that made me laugh was an ignorant fool. Then you go back on that and say ‚Äúguess you just use it to use it, then. No real reason why‚Äù. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre inconsistent and honestly probably wasted my time talking to you, but you‚Äôre sad over dramatic SJW attitude on Reddit makes me laugh and cringe. Thanks for the fun
---
I‚Äôll have you know I‚Äôm part of that percentage
---
well its not in the video so....
---
keep the hurtful truth away
---
You did it, discord is no more
---
I joke in post game about it. "STEVE, I'M GETTING THAT HAIR."
---
I haven't gone after Steves specifically, but if they keep showing up in front of me, I'm gonna hit them.
---
The video is about running around the tree with demogorgen. Its working :D
---
Press X to doubt.
---
oooh so that's why the sounds are different than before! i think this time it's not just survivor sounds, it's also some other sounds unless it's my earphones or that steam link audio driver thingie i installed messing up sounds but that makes no sense
---
anyone care to explain what it does? havent Seen it in game yet
---
its definetly annoying to play against a slugger but its a good strategy that works, and it does cause a lot of pressure, plus if survivors were smart they would realize your slugging and seperate themselves so its harder to patrol them
---
Would be cool if he'd get the watch only if you had Borrowed Time in your perk loadout
---
I did that too, I feel your pain.
---
"sorry bro, my screams aren't directional. bad habit."
---
You lose them after every match, there are offerings however that do allow you to keep them post match.
---
well for 10 seconds before he Hit you :D would have been earlier if he didnt Double back.
---
New to the game? :D
---
Sam Raimi is my daddy what you talking about
---
That dead hard looked so good idk how he even hit you
---
Well, running a chest build can be fun to get some spicy itemd
---
Yes, but i dont think the game sees it that way, i feel like you get alot more pips and points for hooking them and then moving on to the next, and not snowballing i guess
---
I recorded the whole gameplay of her vaulting and failing Skillchecks around us and looking for us only for the killer to come and hook us all except for her, and this happened in 2 trials, same killer same survivor i also have the chat screenshots
---
Right! It's so tired and unfunny now. I like Stranger Things but this sub is awful to browse right now because it's just a Scoops Ahoy karma grab. At least this post is something newish.
---
I prefer faking to make them double back. It‚Äôs a lot safer and can make them lose a lot of distance on certain tiles. If they don‚Äôt double back you‚Äôre far enough away from them to still not get hit.
---
The problem is they view anything other than a 4k as a loss
---
No. Im playing this game a lot. I just play this survivor for the first time.
---
Thats a bit shit, so other than offerings there isnt a way to keep them? Surely you just run out of them then?
---
Fixated could also fit into that mix
---
well yeah because people complained about slugging so you probably do get less bloodpoints, i personally like to get everyone hooked once or twice, kill off two and then slug for the last two, it still gives a ton of bloodpoints and usually secures the 4k unless they got a key and find hatch
---
When equipped on a key, you can see the obsession. It also deacreases your chance to be obsession. If quite sure there is no max range and the weirdest is... You don't have to consume the key to use it, it's always on and don't consume the key
---
we need an r/shittydbddetails
---
All I have to do is look at those perks and I know what kind of M1lly you are. 
---
Meat plant is not great for him, but not the worst.
---
Yeah that makes sense bc I remember seeing head ons only working like 50% of the time. However they should tweak that a lil bc that just doesn‚Äôt look right/fair.
---
I love this
---
Got Demo to lvl 50 in one sitting and since then have been through like 8 webs, still don't have it.
---
It's on sale on steam right now
---
No there isn't, unless you use a black ward as an offering. Otherwise you'll have to obtain it from your bloodwebs again
---
Oh shit I forgot, thank you for reminding me lmao
---
Oh shut up
---
Now you're just gloating
---
Honestly I just check people's profiles these days quickly to know who's SWF. Not for dodging but it helps a lot knowing who's with who in SWF. If I see a poor baby Dwight solo queueing and somehow getting into the lobby with 3 man SWF in the purple ranks I usually just ignore the poor guy and go after the SWF. Not because of some personal hate against SWF, but they usually leave the solo guy on the hook or don't help him at all with anything. It's better to go after the SWF that will always go for saves and leave the gens. Then I usually give the solo guy if he's not toxic a hatch.
---
The fucking devs refuse to fix these glaring issues, smh.
---
The only problem is when you find like a pig who either just got the dlc or is trying to only get Ambush attacks and the walk by you because of the black smoke blocking their field of view so you can walk away.

I know it smells so bullshit but I SWEAR

I bet a lot of ppl DC against you too haha
---
For me they're always on opposite sides of the spectrum never in the middle, either facecamping tbagging or calling everyone over for a fun congo line tbagging dance party
---
I mean, that doesn't get rid of the item, if the key is still in the game and it's SWF or just people with half a brain they'll pick it up.
---
:D
---
This is actually so true.
---
Who hurt you?
---
At this point, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll understand, you just... won‚Äôt. No matter how I explain it to you. I‚Äôm shutting this conversation down. No need to continue, and to guarantee we dot. Waste eachother‚Äôs time anymore on your inconsistent logic, I‚Äôll block you.
---
Fr? I had read it was only towards the obsession
---
The game map is now forever now know to me as ‚ÄúEl Juego‚Äù
---
"dOnT wAnT mY TiMe wAsTeD" in what way? Like how could this WASTE your time?
---
&gt;Adrenaline is not a safety net but protection from tunneling. 
---
Bruh what? It instantly revives all downed survives and heals injured people, even when unhooked in time, and gives a MS boost for people in a chase. How is that not a safety net? The only anti-tunnel aspect I can think of is the MS, but chasing someone isn't inherently tunneling, so.
---
Literally a guy in this said saying that the survivor must have provoked the killer and that he wouldn't be tbagging otherwise
---
You're all laughing now but wait till you get mori'd with a skateboard!
---
Plot twist: its haunted grounds
---
Tell ya hwhat the only time I break a pallet on that map is when I'm not in a chase and I come across a dropped one other than that there is literally no need to break on I tell ya hwhat.

he spends all his time in the other tiers jerking himself so his arm gets swole
---
We share the same opinion on this
---
Careful, he‚Äôs a hero
---
Except you‚Äôre forgetting something important-
---
Iron Maiden is shit.
---
You shouldn't be trying to unhook in front of the killer then.
---

Ouch my feelings. You started drama on my comment section. Now you‚Äôre blocking me cause you‚Äôre feelings are hurtüòÇüòÇ
---
frank could get a basketball uniform tho
---
Haven‚Äôt tunnelled for a long time, but the old dying light gave a big excitement for me when I found the obsession
---
I just loved slowing the game down what can I say
---
But a fair game does. If I lose a fair decent game I don't care. If I am a rank 15 killer against a team of mostly rank 8s with 4 meta perks and I get thrashed because I am not an equal skill/have as good perks as them it's not fun.
---
Play ghostface

Ima play them all

Squid Doodle after hitting a survivor: MEEEHOYYYYY MINOYYYYYYY
---
Why would you combine Unbreakable and No Mither?
---
Too early. You still get the killer stun reward, but the killer won't actually get stunned unless oyu time it right.
---
We are the true Steve mains
---
To be fair. It would be broken if you got very rare add ons, say Myers add ons where he can kill healthy survivors and stay at teir 3, in the bloodweb and got to keep it after every match when used. Think that would ruin the game.
---
Yup you lose it and you‚Äôll need to regain it through the bloodweb.
---
Everyone is playing the new killer
---
Itd be kinda jarring to see a Spirit as a regular, healthy, jittering, finger-twitching, moaning and wailing, ethereal-haired and glass-tinkling human-ghost.
---
Honestly, not as much as you would think.
---
Level 4 Demogorgon, it was my first perk. Sorry about that.
---
and maybe julie could get a cheerleader outfit released with it as well!
---
We already got a clown
---
Agreed, so many people whining over toxic behaviour in this game cause they cant rank up. Everyone deals with the same stuff, you arent special and you lose cause you are bad.
---
Huntress make a better partner to Michael Myers.
---
Change my mind.
---
I even did it with randoms in rank 15 and one of them was an urban evasion claud
---
Do what you want it's unlikely you'll rank up doing that though
---
Playing solo survivor is a no go for me at this point. It's a terrible experience not having anyone to rely on when the killer is up your ass.
---
Yes im aware, there is no true counter to keys, best case scenario=one gets out because of it, but moris will eliminate survivors quicker
---
Yeah, but why takes so long even to cteate a lobby ?
---
hey, I like playing with my food. I know that using NOED makes you rely on it too much, but i'm not bad to the point where i can't even kill anyone if I don't run NOED. that's why noed is a noob perk, it almost gifts you a few kills if you fucked up your whole game. I'm a trapper player, i know what it is to fuck up a game, I run noed to see how survivors are gonna react or if i'm not gonna tryhard a game, i'll just trap the totem and see how well thye handle the situation. but if i'm face see two neas with flashlight, a p3 claudette and ash 4 player SWF you bet yo ass i'm bringing PWYF and a mori.
---
TL;DR noed is the contrary of a git gud perk, i only run it casually or to see how baby dwights survive it
---
Praise the entity.
---
Inner strength can be better than selfcare if you know totem spots, and its absolutely better than no mither
---
I don't know, never heard about it, but I'd give 1 day, then increasingly longer bans for people who DC regularly. Everyone's game crashes from time to time or the internet just stops working, etc, but DCing constantly is becoming a behaviour pattern in this community and it really makes game quality worse and worse.
---
This is the main reason i stopped playing DbD for months now.
---
I only really enjoy Killer, its extremly fun to play, but even when i play with matching Survivors, noone teabags or is an ass, and i get stuff done, i still "mildly panic" until its over.  
---
This is the only game that stresses me so much playing that i actually sweat, its honestly making me question my own sanity, and thats coming from someone who played LoL unmuted for years, so yeah.
---
Kept short, i feel you
---

Baby Dwight‚Äôs first to place them safely in the basement for their own protection.

Time to get those teachables for everyone.
---
Save your shards and play a lot, cool part is anything you've unlocked will stay if you use a ticket
---
Really?  that is surprising...I see ppl DC all the time when slugging, slugging is the most boring thing in the world.  Id rather be facecamped every match than slugged.  I am not joking at all
---
Too relatable.
---
No and yes
---
I think it increases the likelihood people burn the offerings. BPS are rarely played, but when folks get them they start playing them en made.
---
Yup they said it in the dev livestream a few weeks ago
---
Absolutely Disgusting.
---
hope u enjoy them!
---
With league of legends??? What are you smoking. Don't even say the words vladimir
---
She just took too much Adderall is all.
---
Thank
---
It is viable, it extends your range at least 5 fold. If you hit a pallet you got outplayed, besides, it‚Äôs not like you can‚Äôt just pounce again.
---
Leaked already... damn it man.
---
His character is called the hemomancer lol
---
Freddy can fake his teleport this gives him a great mind game potential.
---
 When I play killer I rarely sacrifice unless it‚Äôs a daily. Just to get BP and since the games aren‚Äôt fair for them I let them farm as well.
---
I feel you, I completely missed the Hallowed Blight last year.
---
Its trying to find ppl and space in matchmaking also time of day matters too
---
It was either all killers (beside bubba) or some killers with cosmetics. I‚Äôm happy with my choice
---
Quicker recovery speed.

Just the 5
---
Oh ok
---
I survived 8 games in a row with no mither, more than half of which I was never hooked.
---
Killer knocks someone down, picks up, and then bangs on the gen until they wiggle free.
---
But Myers can have very fun builds (scratched mirror) his addons completely change his playstyle
---
Ooo
---
I think that noed is fair enough but no one likes it. Even though I am a survivor main, I hate when they have noed but we can only blame ourselves. Also, when I get decisived as killer it‚Äôs my fault for not waiting to pick them up
---
How can you compare two perks that have literally nothing in common and make it seems like it's logical when it doesn't make sense at all?
---
I only play solo. Honestly if I played SWaf I‚Äôd get maybe 10% of the play I do now. I don‚Äôt mind bad games.
---
Decisive strike has been basically the #1 thing killers complained about for almost the length of the game, right up there with adrenaline. The truth is, some perks suck to play against. Ignore haters, play how you want. Reap salt
---
That‚Äôs awful to hear, I‚Äôm so sorry. I recently took a week long break because of similar problems. But the thing is I have...god I don‚Äôt even know how many hours played but it‚Äôs probably well over 200. I have absolutely horrible luck and not the best connection and that‚Äôs just a recipe for disaster. I went from being very good at looping and holding my own in a chase to....well shit. I constantly get stuck on things. My game bugs out constantly. I get hit through over 50% of pallets and windows. Slow vaults everywhere despite hitting the angle right and sprinting. Two months ago I would get the can‚Äôt escape bug every other game, and when it happens I also cannot heal, mend, see healing progress bars or wiggle on a killers shoulders as well in the games it happens in. PS4 is a toxic wasteland on killer AND survivor. Basically everything that can go wrong. I also tend to encounter a lot of lag switchers, like really blatantly obvious ones. 
---
I‚Äôve even tried switching to killer to balance things out and obviously further improve as a survivor because it does help. But I don‚Äôt enjoy killer and I‚Äôm not greatest at it either. I‚Äôm also far to merciful being a survivor main. But there are times where I feel like Killer is worse because I‚Äôm literally watching my weapon swing THROUGH survivors, the hits should definitely connect and they just don‚Äôt 50% of the time. But then the ones that do are bullshit and shouldn‚Äôt be connecting 50% of the time as well?! I used to love Huntress but holy Christ I REFUSE to play her even for a Daily anymore. Hatchets almost NEVER land despite going through survivors backs. I frequently see them just yet out of existence the moment I throw them as well. Like they either just disappear a half second after the throw and go no where or they go straight line up to the ceiling. 
---
I was actually a Freddy Main once I started having the issues with Huntress (pre rework). And I was actually very good with him, and I worked very hard to get good with him and LOVED playing him. I almost never had any issues, I frequently double pipped, when actually trying to up killer rank I took him from where I tend to hang around at 12 to 4 and then stopped because I didn‚Äôt want to go further and obviously it was becoming much harder to keep up the streak. I just felt proud for getting him there. I don‚Äôt like playing him now as I miss my old build and old play style. And I also feel like he‚Äôs just too powerful and easy to play now, the way I describe it is like having training wheels on. But now even with Freddy when I do play him sometimes I have the same issues I usually have. I already don‚Äôt enjoy Killer much (only really did with prerework Freddy), and all the issues I encounter playing Killer make it IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy it. 
---
BHVR needs to really reevaluate themselves and their priorities. After a little over 2 years playing I‚Äôve lost all faith in them; and I‚Äôm getting the same feeling I usually get before I give up entirely on a game that is obviously just never going to improve and therefore is doomed to die. And it makes me really sad because I basically completely quit FPS games for DBD. I don‚Äôt want to go back to them, but I like multiplayer games. I love DBD and it‚Äôs concept. 
---
When the game works that is. 
---
TLDR; same I have a lot of problems too and feel you, and I also and sick of it and basically want to quit at this point.
---
Maybe the Entity can hijack the Demigorgons hive mind signal and impersonate the mind flayer or maybe our Demigorgon is one that has developed free will and choose the Entity as its master similar to Dart and Dustin in season 2.

What's the thought process on running BBQ on a slugger build?
---
I had 2 crashes in a row trying out new Dying Light right as I was about to get 5th stack while hooking somebody. Did those killers have Dying Light on them too by any chance?
---
this should be doctor
---
Well, time is most definitely something i gave plenty of. Have not been playing the game for about 8 months until this week because it
---
Took about 15 mins to connect to a game only to facecamped lol. 
---
I thought maybe after all that time they vw fixed connection issues, but not too much of a progression there. 
---
I ll give it more time. I kinda like the game :)
---
steve's moan sounds like the old "why you crying" meme
---
I played him a fair amount before the re-work and two games after I posted I got it although it was from someone walking over a dream snare
---
It‚Äôs cool if you‚Äôd rather play solo but why would you loss so much time? I‚Äôm sure you could easily find a person or two on discord somewhere who could meet your schedule. I even just friend decent survivors after a game so that I can have a pool of people to play with if they‚Äôre on.

The timing of this post is kinda crazy. I was spacing out in class with Reddit open on my phone. I then thought, ‚Äùman it would be really nice if someone made a diagram for how to run tiles in DBD‚Äù maybe I should learn the tiles and then make one. I scrolled down once and was awestruck. There it was! Exactly what I was thinking about!
---
This diagram, combined with Ohtofu‚Äôs youtube video is the ultimate looping tutorial for new survivors. I still need to learn this and I have 170 hours in the game. Thank you for posting this!!
---
Noice
---
It increases acceleration. Combine it with a speed add on and you get to top speed super fast
---
Yea let me just learn how to be the best killer in the game instantly to win. ??????????
---
Wha?
---
Same for me too. Runs fine with me, especially killer side but survivor works too.
---
Why dodge on keys? Did they change them or something
---
Im not saying i straight slug, but im saying i dont have a problem with putting in a slug, or two.... 
---
Also come on, double bp is always a good bonus :)
---
Did anyone mention unsafe pallets yet? I feel this may be overlooked.
---
The background of this image looks like a screenshot of Fallout: New Vegas.
---
Hey, don't say that about Bubba's home cooking :(
---
What's Nea doing?.....
---
Well that makes sense
---
Use whatever you want, play however you want. People don't seem to understand that killers and survivors aren't obligated to play nice.
---
They sent a tweet out yesterday saying that it's an issue with matchmaking. They know the problem and are working on a fix!
---
Exactly this. If any more than two people run it it‚Äôll be one heal at most. Besides, even without I cleanse for that sweet 1000 BP
---
tbf that was extremely close
---
Literally unplayable.
---
If I notice any of them finding my totem, I'll have to get rid of them
---
Ngl for some odd reason the ready button will sometimes be disabled at times, even when I just join a lobby.
---
Rank 20-18 leather faces do
---
We have to dudes with chainsaws as well that have similar abilities
---
Hope you enjoy them all. They all are a ton of fun to play as. Myers and Freddy are two of my favorites. Fruit Ninja Myers is so much fun to play. (Myers with mad grit) The mind games with ghostface and pig are also a ton of fun. I only have one game on demogorgon so far but learn from my mistake you currently can't reset portals unless survivors destroy them. I would strongly suggest placing one or two by the exit gates for the late game so you don't you find your self in the endgame without one of your powers.
---
Gotcha. I was just generally curious, not criticizing. Ive only been playing for 3 weeks ans just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something.
---
Bruh moment
---
Thank you. Just painting it and finding a way to pin it to my back.
---
Billy and leatherface have very similar abilities
---
No, there's quite a few good community members, we are just hiding lol
---
I'm ok with people playing swf, it's them making it extremely obvious they're swf and are going to be toxic what annoys me. You can't tell me that the 4 man claudette team with items and "Hex:" names aren't together and will most likely give me a bad time.
---
I mean, I think there's such a vague similarity that you could probably have posted a potato with glasses on and it'd be of a similar resemblance.
---
And I disagree with the people's stance on Ace, Quentin and Jake.
---
I would actually really like that
---
I‚Äôve always found whispers so...lacking. Maybe I just don‚Äôt how to use it.
---
- Tremendously increases teleport cooldown
---
- Tremedously extends undetectable mode after getting out of a portal
---
the pallets aren't the issue, any semi-decent killer will at worst force the pallet drop quickly or at best get a hit on like 90% of those loops.
---
It's the Balanced Landing drops that seem exploitable though if the survivor knows how to run them. Inversely the whole upstairs is basically a dead zone and the gens are in really confined areas most of the time.
---
I'm actually starting to lean on the weird idea that the map is actually kind of balanced, it has strong structures for both survivors and killers and they each have advantages over the other side in certain areas of the map.
---
I didnt take that as critizism bud, seemed like a genuine question. But i do try to hook everyone once before i start the snowballing tho, thats my thought process atleast
---
Screw company policy. Nobody hides Steve "the hair" Harrington's gorgeous locks.
---
Because I can play anytime I want vs only playing when friend can play?
---
I mean I assume playing on a group + discord. Otherwise why bother?
---
I levelled doc up to p3 level 50 and above, I never saw that perk in a bloodweb even with the new bloodweb changes.
---
how? you already know if the obsession is being chased, and a perk like bond would be much more useful if you just need to find a teammate to heal. plus, if I‚Äôm right, it just says decreases ur chances, so there‚Äôs a chance you might be the obsession and the add on would be useless.
---
I bet that Freddy let out a good fuuuuuuuuuuck after that
---
And yas I have  the teachable.
---
This all day long. So many fucking sweaty tryhards on both ends just desperate to win so they feel good that they are better than someone else at fucking something.
---
Worse

I'm sure you can make an audio-only porno with Ash, Jane, Kate, and Jeff all injured standing next to each other.

Some killers this would be cool with, others not so much. I really don‚Äôt want to see hag and spirit as normal people with the way they move

Umm a lot. I don't think Dead by Daylight is for kids. Resident Evil, Outlast, The Evil Within, Basically any horror game. So, "WhAt AdUlT PlAyS vIdEo GaMeS tHeN?"

Well, with that many maps what survivor would try to loop them? If they just run and drop it the killer still loses distance. And with the amount of them a survivor can do that for a really long time. 
---
Then you add on that area where balanced landing basically makes and infinite.
---
So here I am, doing everything I can
---
Holding on to what I am
---
Pretending I'm a superman
---
I'm trying to keep, the ground on my feet
---
Seems the world is falling down around me
---
The night's are long, I'm singing this song
---
Trying to make the answer's more a maybe
---
And I'm so confused, about what to do
---
Sometimes I want to throw it all away
---
So here I am, growing older all the time,
---
Looking older all the time,
---
Feeling younger in my mind
---
Holding on to what I have
---
I'm trying to sleep,
---
I lost count of sheep,
---
My mind is racing faster every minute
---
What could I do more,
---
Yeah, I'm really not sure
---
I don't want to run in circles but I can't quit
---
And I'm so confused
---
I've got a lot to do
---
Controlling everything inside
---
Feeling weak I don't feel right
---
Telling me I have to change
---
Telling me to act my age
---
But if all that I can do
---
Is to sit and watch time go
---
Then I'll have to say goodbye
---
And I'll be sure to watch time fly, to watch it fly-hy-hy
---
So here I am,
---
Growing older all the time,
---
Here I am, doing everything I can
---
Holding on to what I am,
---
carry on with ur life

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d6vndf/nice_i_love_it_this_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
sometimes u just get those games where you wanna do gens cus ur already kinda frustrated and then u spawn 5 feet away from the killer.
---
finally, a good fucking julie skin
---
DS was complained about so much that they nerfed it heavily. Both sides complain about the other equally there's no bias. Both sides are whiny bitches about it.
---
When playing Myers I refuse to tier on a Quentin. I have standards.
---
If youre going to go down, go down facecamping the 1 guy u downed
---
That‚Äôs not an excuse to DC lol
---
These are the basics, looks like you woke up this reddit of newbies..anyways killers can fake the fakes, same thing can do survivors..really good killers can read you like a book when it comes to looping, but survivors can do the same thing. That is the problem, at high ranks it can be a guessing game which is fun and all until the generators start popping. The killers that have no mobility WILL struggle and lose against a decent team and this is happening more commonly now..survivors are getting better and better at the game or simply they stopped caring about chests and totems, running in the middle of the map and complete the "key" generator. What the key generato does is force the killer to waste time(20 seconds circa, which is a lot of time) checking generators to FIND survivors first and then trying to catch them. It's not even a debate,a good team of survivors will beat anything that's not Nurse/Billy/Spirit very very easily
---
I'm having a crappy morning, but this made me feel a little better. I can't stop giggling, lol
---
FFS I'll be out of town that whole weekend.  Damn it.
---
It's a challenge mode.
---
its effect states: You die quickly with nothing in return
---
and that's why I love it
---
#im confused
---
Nice
---
They should redo the mori for each character to be different and then when It comes to steve the nurse just kiss him
---
Why? I don't enjoy getting "outplayed" by an item.
---
He has a small head lol
---
I trap pallets
---
Thanks for ruining the gameplay BHVR /s
---
Why did adrenaline pop? Im confused.
---
I got bbq on my nurse at level 49 lmao, the new bloodweb changes are going to be pretty nice now that they're out
---
anything is an excuse to dc if you‚Äôre tilted enough
---
DS is so powerful killers will avoid people who *might* have it and Hopping into a locker after unhook is godmode for survivors.
---
And you want to make it so it cant be avoided, doesn't have any pre-reqs and can be run in combo with DS?
---
Dead hard requires timing, Risk/Reward (you are injured), Positioning (DHing to nothing is pointless) and Aim (DHing away from a pallet wont help)
---
BB requires none of those things. You arent injured, You can do it anywhere, dont have to time it and Hitting someone behind you isnt hard *when they are chasing you*
---
Imagine all 4 survivors running DS,Dead hard, BT and BB. 
---
You think spirit and nurse mains are bad now? It'll be the only killer you ever see.
---
Well... I would argue for wraith Bing bonging in your face on the hook and a leather daddy with the chainsaw in your face.
---
It‚Äôs like dropping a pallet on a killer too early, you‚Äôll get the stun points and sound but they aren‚Äôt done picking up the survivor so it‚Äôs not gonna do anything. Did waste his spirit fury I guess
---
i want Kayako from J≈´-On
---
I like this
---
Thanks for the tips! üëç
---
Did he DC after ds?
---
I literally didn‚Äôt get it till like 10 webs into my p3 billy.
---
i cant even get into a lobby with my friend right now jsut keeps saying could not accept invite
---
To me, every male survivor feels like they take up too much space on my screen so I just stick to playing the girls
---
Why not both?
---
Killer mains greatly overestimate both how sweaty most swf groups are, and the amount of swfs there are.
---
The amount of times I've seen killers cry about swf in post game chat because 2 randoms tanked a hit at the end of the game is insane.
---
This is really good! nice job!
---
A Ghostface chased my partner for 5 gens then face camped. Not sure if he thought my partner was a new player because he was playing Steve.
---
The bill and meg in our game went in for an epic save and as we were all leaving, the killer DC'd in the exit gate. We lost our blood points and items but it was worth it. We have the whole game on video üòÇ
---
We then got cocky green ranks who wanted to bully the killer and decided to farm me off the hook while the killer (some young kid with a YouTube channel. He had to be like 12.) Face camped me and tunneled me off hook. 
---
This community is awesome when it comes to the new players /s
---
You already know he sent a salty message afterwards
---
Really good at knowing someone is around you. Also busted in endgame, you don‚Äôt have to guess which door the survivor is you know exactly where they are. Won a lot of games of just chillin at one door cuz I knew the survivor was waspish waiting for me to go.
---
You mess with the crabbo, you get the stabbo
---
Lol, you're being silly.
---
You add people every now and then who you get along with. If no one's on, you play solo. The guy you replied to probably figured that went without saying.
---
It‚Äôs basically hard mode DBD. Only use it if you want a challenge. That said it‚Äôs not impossible to escape with it.
---
Dude give me Nostromo, Ripley, and Xenomorph and I'll give you money.
---
you aren't losing much distance unless you break the pallet which you shouldn't need to since the loop is unsafe, a survivor running pallet to pallet dropping them would waste time sure, but after that one chase, everyone else is kinda screwed later in the match.
---
The BL loop is strong I know but not an infinite, it isn't Haddonfield levels of broken as the killer isn't forced to vault to keep up with the survivor, once learned it won't be broken but still be strong enough to waste time. I assume you're referring to that 1 isolated room with the 1 vault at the top and the 2 stairs on the side, or that 1 giant room with the catwalk all across, either 1 doesn't force the killer to vault.
---
Fix what?
---
Y‚Äôall need to understand that he‚Äôs not foodsafe with a watch/jewellery on and I prefer my scoops ahoy boy in food safe mode. 
---
Bigger bug is that uneven farmer‚Äôs tan.
---
OH MY GOD, nice play absolutely amazing
---
doctor is annoying but he‚Äôs not that strong
---
Want to talk about a real bug? His scream when hooked.

I know the feeling man, I don't play Dbd 24/7 anymore, but still play it sometimes and of course suck as a result
---
Same one time I had a ghost face who was constantly tunneling people. Another time I was chilling with one on the exit gate
---
He's gonna be a david some day
---
How about no
---
Awww... Metallica Fight fire with fire... really good song
---
When will we get the No Mither Escape achievement? I'm waiting BHVR.
---
I've got bbq rank 2 in my demo but it refusrs to give me the last rank
---
Lmao :D
---
&gt;DS is not a safety net for fucking up tbh - It's an anti tunnel perk
---
It's both.
---
Ah. I've only heard nothing else matters, which is great
---
Survivors were complaining about spending 20 seconds to join half full lobbies and then needing to wait 2 minutes for it to fill.
---
So instead of killers sitting in an empty lobby for 4  minutes and a filling lobby for 2 minutes, killers have to search for a lobby for 6 minutes and then it fills in 20 seconds.
---
First mori that ever happened to me was from Leatherface
---
And this makes it less rewarding to max them. Shaving 2 seconds off the timer is a fucking meme and after playing with Nancy for awhile I can quite safely say that you absolutely don't need the extra 2 seconds.
---
But then why the fuck are you complaining about cosplays being posted to the dead by daylight community subreddit?
---
You love to see itü§ôüèª
---
To send a message.
---
*laughs in Huntress with deerstalker*
---
He's gonna need a Doctor. 
---
Oh wait he already saw mine today !
---
The problem is, we should have to ‚Äúaccept it or quit.‚Äù
---
They should either get better at THEIR JOBS, or fire the people who obviously CANNOT DO THEIR JOBS CORRECTLY. They have the money to hire more developers, who are more qualified as well.
---
**They wont.**
---
They literally think their game is the best it can be right now.
---
**It‚Äôs absolutely not.**
---
They blatantly IGNORE their community when it reports game breaking issues on a regular basis. They even now are starting to CENSOR people who post about the matchmaking issues right now. 
---
**Because they are tired of being called out.**
---
Their developers are arrogant, stubborn, RUDE, and delusional. The Lead Community Manager has her head so far up the Game Directors Arrogant and delusional asshole. When she does actually care about her job they ignore her. The developers barely even know how to play their own game, and are HORRIBLE at it. Some of them don‚Äôt even know how some of the perks in the game work?! There are Devs who argue with people here on reddit and on their own forums. They flat out lie and are rude a lot of the time when receiving any criticism or find themselves being called out for their bullshit. 
---
There is a reason why the community is so small. But it‚Äôs not nearly as tiny as everyone like to claim on this subreddit. Especially now with Stranger Things. But the reason why the game isn‚Äôt really taking off like it could is BECAUSE of the developers. They won‚Äôt listen to their community. They are lazy and clearly just money hungry at this rate. They care only about pumping out new DLC no matter what even if it doesn‚Äôt work, isn‚Äôt good, or breaks the entire game. Their bug reports seemingly aren‚Äôt even looked at anymore because literally every time I send one I‚Äôm given the exact same automated response message instantly. 
---
‚ÄúWe are aware of and have no solution for this issue. Sorry. Please be patient. Would you rate how satisfied you are with our help?‚Äù 
---
**-10/10**
---
They are running a game that many of us love into the ground. We paid for this game, and still continue to when we buy DLC and cosmetics. We are consumers, and they are basically holding a middle finger to us and digging their own graves by refusing to see reason and make changes. 
---
If they think people will just keep blindly eating their time and money they are in for a rude awakening. Especially now with Stranger Things. They could end up pissing off Netflix and cause issues there on top of all the ST fans flooding into the game which can and WILL cause backlash that could end DBD as we know it. 
---
And let‚Äôs face it. They canceled the summer event for this DLC. Because they know if it isn‚Äôt perfect they are fucked. Yet again, they took the lazy route or just simply couldn‚Äôt do it right even then. Still can‚Äôt get dedicated servers right after over a year. 
---
Something needs to give. They need to change. And they are refusing to. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think they ever will.
---
I wouldn't mind 2min, I am a patient guy, but 5min to create the lobby, it's just waste of time, I am gonna try to play as survivor "alone", I have been doing it but with friends, we have been doing fine getting into a lobby.
---
Ho... here it is... it's really heavy but tthat's the true Metallica feeling (no need to downvote my comment to hell) https://youtu.be/xjlgUx7_aN0
---
No mither and a kit/self care
---
Please Google hemomancer
---
Woooh self deprivation...
---
Lol I didn‚Äôt plan on putting him on my face, I promise this isn‚Äôt an r/thathappened lmao
---
I refuse, if there's a killer in this DLC it needs to be [this guy](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Hash-Slinging_Slasher)
---
dead hard essentially is second hit you can tank so david can be viable
---
Yeah, it doesn't matter if they play as a team or not, I will still stay in that lobby.
---
However for me a hard "NO!" is when there are survivors who have names like "X = DC". It doesn't matter if I play killer or survivor, if your name already indicates that you will DC when X happens, I'm not gonna play with you.
---
You really want challenge mode, Run Object too.
---
Freddy Myers.
---
As bad as it sounds (because there‚Äôs never a good way to say this) Charles Manson is my favorite ‚Äúserial killer‚Äù. The whole story is fascinating and I never thought to link these two. I already liked Legion but this makes me like them more.
---
Literally came up with him lol
---
Same. Then tier 2 bbq on second bloodweb then ruin 3rd bloodweb.
---
üòÇ why the fuck are you complaining about my comment? All I said was it's sad that someone would spend money to do something like this (which it is). I bet you're only pissed because you do this shit too.
---
Jesus this community gets so bitchy whenever someone tries to justify the use of noed
---
A lobby joined on me with the names "Trash Killer", "GG EZ", "Get Looped", etc. and I swapped from basement Bubba to Bubba with ruin and Franklin's. I didn't bring a mori and I severely regret it now. They were EXTREMELY toxic during the game and in chat after three escaped:(
---
I'm here for the memes dude. I don't wanna see some guy dressed as a pig.
---
First time I heard it I was like wtf. Who is this girl screaming.
---
Come on man ever went to a convention? People just wanna have some fun.
---
Cool
---
Okay
---
I was just asking because I never really thought of them as a problem. I think maybe I've had 1 group get out with them before and me and my buddies always looked at it as kind of weak not some overpowered thing so we dont use it. Maybe im missing something though.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Degenerate
---
No, I've heard they're disgusting and everyone smells like BO. I get wanting to have fun, but why would you want to spend money on something so ridiculous? Just play the game if you want to be a pig.
---
Reading it myself, it sounds really useless now
---
Nah, I like other more unique perks for my killer build. I may not kill everyone every time but its more fun this way
---
This has nothing to do with Demogorgen and everything to do with killer hitboxes vs survivor hitboxes.
---
Anything other than escape or 4k is a loss tbh. I'd prefer the killers to go for 4k or bust rather than desperately accept the 1k dweet.
---
fix matchmaking
---
Nurdette
---
Honestly, just give me a BP multiplier based on the number of survivors in my lobby who are in a group, and I'll happily take those 0k matches in stride.
---
I just hate the game being balanced around survivors not being able to to communicate verbally, yet survivors can break that rule, and I'm not compensated for having to deal with it.
---
Good news is it looks like there‚Äôs going to be a Hallowed Blight 2.0 towards the end of October for 2 weeks according to some leaks.
---
wait what, fixing generator is dull and you want to add more to a match?   You are a funny guy :D
---
Whats his name? WE MUST KNOW HIS NAME?

True.
---
They ran out of time to add this.
---
This happened to me yesterday with some super toxic jackass but since my brain is running on 5,000 ping with the rest of my body I forgot what button to press and the rest of them bodyblocked me by time I realized what had happened
---
It could but it still has a use when injured, not the case with everything else.
---
adept david
---
isn't it a teachable perk, and shouldn't that be there instead?
---
And what if all the survivors aren‚Äôt near at all and the killer just never leaves the area
---
The Boogie Man is a stealth Killer. Unlike other stealth Killer, he use his ability Jailbreak to travel between Lockers, allowing him to move without being detected while still assert his presence in the Trial.
---
His personal Perks, Welcome Home, Don't Stop Me Now and Wasted Time will hinder Survivors' ability to hide, escape, or even to finish their objectives.
---
Bruh
---
add new gamemodes
---
Fucking love this.
---
I don‚Äôt think many people say it on this subreddit, but if you go to the official DBD forums you will see TONS of super biased killer mains saying the craziest shit. There was a thread saying that killers cannot be toxic no matter what they do since they are the killers. You will see a bunch of crazy threads there tbh.
---
I like Nancy more. Xd but I usually play only girls anyway
---
I'm just sayin dude dying light is better now than before

Spoiler: They do not have knock out.

When is Jason and IT coming to dbd?

If not IT, would any Stephen King thing fit? (not the Thing tho pls)

The pallets are unsafe as hell on that map, 80% of them are

Restore cashe through steam?

BHVR hurt me the moment  when they added st chapter

bi\_irl
---
Waiting at the pallet for the stun. NaeNae to your teammates.
---
For bonus anti-SWF, go basement build.
---
I got it level 4 scrub
---
So they did this on purpose? damm feels really annoying.  But to be fair, most changes were good, but not this one.
---
I meant while using no mither. 
---
Self care gives a bonus to using a med kit, which can still be used on other players. Inner strength cannot. 
---
My main point was this post was intended on being a meme build with useless items and perks that can‚Äôt pair with no mither. The actual reality is that everything but inner strength can be useful with no mither to heal other players. 
---
I agree that I would rather take IS than SC, as I usually do totems. However, that is not the point of the post.
---
I've already tried that, but thanks for the suggestion.
---
\*incoherent screaming\* 
---
THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE.
---
I mean survivors don't get the luxury of dodging a mori.
---
Sometimes I like to pretend I can‚Äôt find them. 
---
‚ÄúAre you over here..? Nooooooo. What about over heeere? Aw shucks..‚Äù
---
How is the ability to escape without completing the objective weak?
---
Ok, keys are not usually that big of a deal to me, most teams get 1 gen completed before they're dead. But when it's been a more even match (gen-wise at least) and suddenly you just see 2 or 3 people yeet out with a key, it's bullshit.
---
Survivor, lobby dc is really only a problem when it comes to killers. I‚Äôve yet to hear a story of a survivor lobby dodging do to avoiding a killer.
---
Oh no I agree it‚Äôs super fun but not in the Meta
---
The Spirit kinda has this with her Schoolgirl uniform. Obviously not truly what you're talking about, but it is a nice nod to her backstory.
---
No they can frequently take too long or not be action packed enough to get adept
---
ty lmao i don't really pay attention to the subreddit and what they post. I just thought i'd make this xd
---
Leave then.
---
I do agree with that, I mean seeing a fresh clean Nurse without any facial damage or covering would be nice too.
---
Don't worry he's a killer main :D
---
Imagine the hag mori with that skin.
---
Hex waisted time is actually a fun meme perk idea. The pallet one not so much
---
Dont you have to basically do 4-5 gens for the hatch to show up with 4 people alive. Idk seems like at that point just finish the game. Maybe im looking at it differently from a survivor perspective. As far as killer like I said I've seen it happen to me once so they basically dont exist.
---
It would be like taking away David's shirtless cosmetic. How could they hide that? Lol
---
I'm not talking about moris now am i? Take that us vs them mentality out of here please :) 
---
For the record, i think moris are bullshit too (except Devour Hope). Nothing to do with keys though.
---
Well, yeah, he teabagged. But he teabagged to fill the time while he waited for DS to end. Still should have committed to chase of another surv instead because he was right there anyway, time wasted not worth it.
---
Yet, I should mention that DS is fucking ended while he was picking up. PGTW doesn't work when it runs out WHILE you kick the gen &gt;:(
---
Also I should mention that people call ghostface in that thread more toxic because he can squat quickly like survs, lol.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/bug-report-pc
---
If there is no way you see to correct it, submit a formal bug report.
---
Wow, was planning on trying that combo too
---
I dont enjoy being outplayed by a mori but you dont hear me complaining.
---
Yeah it is.  They need a bp sink in the game so they made killers a sort of black hole of bloodpoints.
---
Meanwhile.. Rank one survivors are turned into druggies as they burn bp in the search of syringes, as thats pretty much the only useful item/addon they can't acquire with plunderer's instinct and ace in the hole.
---
except Jane, but I am not complaining :D
---
OK thanks, Ill look into it!
---
FUCKING FINALLY.
---
Wtf he closes hatch then it reopens??? Someone fill me in I'm quite new.
---
The extra distance is not what makes omegablink OP but the fact that you charge and traverse shorter distances much faster, greatly reducing the time survivors have to react to your blink.       
---
     
---
A short range blink that might just be barely dodgeable thus becomes a guaranteed hit.
---
I already replied to one guy posting the same but here i go again: that's completely IRRELEVANT. I'm not talking about moris now am i? I'm talking about keys.
---
Also, yes moris are bullshit.
---
Probably no surprising if you play league, but it has a very long history as a term pre-league
---
Hahaha
---
&gt; 4 people alive
---
Less gens needed if some are dead. I mean the issue isn't 4 man key escapes. That rarely happens.
---
Usually it's 2 people getting out after 2 are dead.
---
Old d strike completely deserved that nerf tbf
---
F
---
Ty!
---
Wasn't it a joke for his nose to be broken in the series or am I just not remembering it right?
---
Well I imagine it is a bit similar to anti-loop Bamboozle. You can actually block pallets easily by shuffling in that position, which can easily be done during chase.
---
That meme perk does sound too stronk, though. I think it is more like a reliable Ruin, because you will not know if the Killer is running this Perk or not.
---
I.
---
Idk maybe I just need more game time to see it more. Did it get worse after the end game collapse change? Or that didnt really effect it
---
Then get good, do not rely on a issue devs have been unable to solve. play with your friends and have fun, but self regulate to not use an exploit, even if you are not god at the game.
---
Same lol
---
Dunno if you had noticed but a lot of the killers have movies themselves
---
As a new killer, I relate to this hardcore lol
---
Same. I've only ever used a key once and it was way more stressful than just playing normally. And then there's Franklin's demise that'll eat your key. Not worth it imo
---
I took in a key which can re-open the hatch once closed.
---
In what world is ghostface fun to play against?
---
Nah man, well not for DbD at least, I usually only draw stuff for my YouTube thumbnails and I've only got a couple videos on DbD so far. But this sub's response has been so generally positive, I might be tempted to make something just for you guys :)
---
I dunno, guess we'll see?
---
not to mention one of their tips suggests using a pallet for diversion.
---
4man Quentin SWF says hi
---
... but you have 200iq and equip your scratched mirror
---
I guess ill just go with the flow? *thanks*
---
Im not saying it didnt I just hate these posts that are trying to claim only one side complains so what happens if my side complains?
---
When in reality both sides complain you just either dont pay attention, skip over it, or agree with the complaints.
---
Is there something wrong with borrowed time?
---
Nice I'll watch it when I can.
---
"Somebody did a thing I don't like because it forces me to do something different, fire them and destroy their lively-hood" -some ignorant clown
---
Yes, since I said they should be faster to fix overall (meaning less time overall spent fixing them). But with more to fix on the map, survivors would require more movement around the map, making chases and stealth more common (and those are the fun parts of the game).
---
I play survivor way more than killer, and I just wish I could spend more time running about rather than sitting still holding down a button.
---
Time to uninstall.
---
Well, it does..

Dbd is basically cabin in the woods
---
Is this an SCP-2845 reference?
---
The art is really good but why do people keep lewding the serial killers
---
IKR! Guy missed by a whole second, what a cretin.
---
But in all seriousness, can YOU count exactly 60 seconds without looking at clock?
---
Also only killer have to do all this memory minigames. Count down BT, count down DS, remember 4 survs looks, perks and hook stages. While survs have HUD indicators for everything.
---
Theres 4 catagories to scorce points in, with a max of 8k, per category per game for a maximum of 32k. The trick do getting BP is to be efficient and always be doing something that gives you points:
---
1) Always be on a gen. If the killer isnt chasing or pressuring you, you should be on a gen. Doing a gen is your resting state. You cant escape the trail if the doors dont get powered. 
---
2) Co-op actions give a large BP bonus. If you see someone nearby working on a gen or healing a teammate, help out. 
---
3) Cleasning totems and pallet stunning the killer give a high amount of Boldness points for the required time commitment. 
---
4) Hook resuces are the easiest way to get Altruism, but you need to be smart about it. Dont unhook if the killer is nearby. Dont get off a gen to run across the map (unless necessary). Finish your gen, then go for the save. Or, if the hook is close by, you can just unhook once its safe. 
---
Try to spread out your actions every game. Dont waste time hiding, always try to be doing one of these actions:
---
Objective = Doing gens, opening chests, interacting with Jigsaw boxes
---
Altruism = Rescuing and healing teammates, taking 'Proctection' hits, and acting as a 'Distraction' while another survivor is in a chase close-by. 
---
Boldness = Running the killer, pallet stuns, flashlight blinds, cleansing totems, being in the basement
---
Survival = Escaping the trail, self healing, mending, wiggiling out of the killers grasp, interacting with Plagues pools or waking up against Freddy.
---
I mean, that'd be a simple fix. Literally just cut the arm from one onto he other.
---
Do what I do, go find the killer.  Best way to get into a chase
---
He doesn't have to borrow it, it's wrapped around his wrist.
---
Not healing and staying on the gen with the killer nearby was a bad move even with decisive strike as it was wasteful after a short chase.
---
He didn‚Äôt tunnel you for most of the game he just chose the weakest target when he had a choice now and then.
---
Depends on your type of colorblindness. For me (strong protan) they blend in with the surroundings on basically every map and I just can't see them. I can tell they're red but i just can't distinguish them from their surroundings
---
Xbox player here and I am experiencing a similar matchmaking experience
---
Killer players: game can you please match SWF based on average rank of their party
---
DbD: nope
---
I don't know, to be honest. I just think this head piece along with the jacket and pants would be a good cosmetic, as it would be the only beaten up Steve we would be able to get, since the other two potential cosmetics are either already in the game and would just be a re-skin with a little dried blood, or is already a highly requested cosmetic that would most likely not have the beat up Steve as a cosmetic. Not only that, but beaten up Steve even has some significance in season one, because he wears these clothes while he fights the demogorgon and saves John and Nancy.
---
Hey, ya did a pretty good job. You captured her quite well!

He just got really good addons

THE FLASH SINGING.. THE SASH RINGING..
---
Probably new, if they have BBQ maybe they still saw some were missing as they were in lockers, or just prefers to camp. Could really be any reason but ultimately, if it catches people killers will continue to do it. They most likely get more success in this method more than they come out empty. Can't tell you how many times I am on the hook only to see a survivor near by waiting for the killer to walk away so can't fault the killer, least in my opinion.
---
Good perks, but horrible power with bad map pressure and non existant help during chase.
---
I really really like Welcome Home. It's fun.
---
I gg after every game, but maybe not, like you said, when they camp. However, I think it‚Äôs kind of the etiquette of online multiplayer games to say gg even if you don‚Äôt completely mean it.
---
In the lobby, sometimes I see an oval with some picture in it under a player's level. What does that mean?
---
All Scoops Ahoy live in my matches. No exceptions.
---
Knowing BHVR we'd probably get Amanda Ripley rather than Ellen Ripley for some reason
---
Literally killers will make you want to scoop ahoy yourself. I'm convinced they're russian
---
I'll stand in the corner. The entity doesn't want them anyway
---
Noce, tell me what did you think when you did it
---
Why not the Thing tho
---
This is really good to see, gives me a lot more insight on how to run those loops as a killer
---
This is why I can never play this game seriously. This happens and then I get pissed.
---
You're weird
---
This makes me feel bad for loving to play steve...  Steve's please dont be like this...
---
~sed~ heppy
---
Good shout.
---
for the totem one, does the killer get the fake totems auras, and does the killer get a notification if they are broken?
---
Ok
---
I'm still experimenting around the idea, though. It is more like a very restricted Demogorgon. I want it to be more spooky, because it seems that we don't have many spooky Killer in the game.
---
Yep, it also depends on rank as im currently looking for a match for the last few min
---
Yeah why wouldn't they lewd Kate
---
I hardly see Steves, so I feel inclined to give them the hatch if they end up being the last survivor.
---
That's what I was thinking as well, canonically, the killers are kept in their own pocket realm that mimics their home world until called upon for a trial to prevent them from hurting eachother (killers can be killed, and have been before) but I like to think that while traversing the fog (plane of reality that connects trials), survivors and killers catch glimpses of eachother in the thick mist but cannot make contact.
---
My point is that the game ought to naturally flow into what makes it fun. If survivors were moving around more, they're more likely to be found by the killer, or more likely to have to duck and hide at the last second to avoid it. I get your point, but does anyone here actually enjoy doing generators? They're essential to the game, but is there a way to make it more engaging?
---
You know Franklins Demise exists for a reason and worked better the more items you see in a lobby. 
---
Even if it were for just keys, Franklins is hilarious on killers like Hag or Trapper or Plague. Swat it out their hands and trap it afterwards. Good luck getting your flashlight now sucker.
---
Seems like someone couldn't count to 60

[FUCKING ONE SECOND OFF LMAO](https://youtu.be/ZUCDMQqukik?t=3)

Dealt with so many fucking toxic camping Ghostfaces as of late so nice to see one get cucked for playing like an asshole.
---
Holy shit, bHVR has terrible dlc, like what is this inexcusable garbage? Literally unplayable. I gotta go back to playing Hogan's castle for the nintendo 64
---
That's not toxic. I don't think y'all understand how to use the word. It's not a synonym for being annoying.
---
Fun little thing there, the background pattern is actually a warped version of his Killer-ability icon "Of The Abyss" I just messed around with the colors to make it look *spooky*
---
[\[laughter\]](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/507/972/9a2.png)

I mean, exposing Survivors hopping out of lockers is pretty good. Exposed perks are fun stuff
---
Glad to be of service. Serial killers are a hard subject to discuss around "relatively normal/overwhelmingly positive" people. When I was a teenager I studied them profusely and tried understanding them. I'm currently searching to find a way to be able to completely turn off emotions at will (far better than having them always turned off or severely impeded like sociopaths/psychopaths). Tbh Manson does spill a lot of truth about the prison of our minds. The problem is, it can be interpreted wrongfully and used in a destructive way, such as his.
---
It‚Äôs like all the toxic Nea‚Äôs  became toxic Steve‚Äôs, I got flashed yesterday by 4 steves with flashlights and I shit you not it lasted for like 2 or 3 minutes because they would flash light me as soon as I would come out of it. I also got flashlighted at every pallet too, and I just wanted an easy going game with Micky
---
I love conga line ghostface. Makes the games so much fun.
---
Hmm I'm quite torn on this one. If the Killer knows the aura, he can fake the defense on the dummies, which can be too strong. But without knowing the aura, good Survivors can somehow deduce that these Totems are purposely defenseless, so either it is Haunted Ground or Wasted Time.
---
Happened to me with ash when I prestiged him lol
---
Current match making includes one if not all the following:
---
SWF group
---
Healing circles
---
Group body blocking
---
One guy who has the strongest flashlight add one
---
Claudette group wearing the red jacket outfit
---
Endless loops while the group actually does generators
---
Add new mechanics and more vertical elements to maps. Also either remake the map ‚Äúthe game‚Äù or delete it from existence lol
---
Well after I got pulled off the first hook the terror radius appeared 6 seconds later. Not enough time for me to have healed or walked away, and if i‚Äôd have ran they would have followed the scratches anyway.
---
Also they clearly tunnelled me down. After they hooked me they were chasing the Obsession but came back. Then I literally ran past Steve working on the gen downstairs and they ignored him and the gen popped a few seconds later. Then after I got unhooked the second time they abandoned the Survivor they were chasing, ran straight past the Feng and bolted after me, again ignoring the Feng when she tried to take the heat nearer the end.
---
Yes it is. the kind of coordination a SWF can achieve is something even devs have said are looking to balance, but you gotta admit its hard as fuck to balance them without totally screwing the solo players, so no answer has been given about it. a SWF trying to win and be efficient is using an exploit, think of it like the guy that in old games, before patches and all that, that kept spamming the same unavoidable move. even if he was shit at it and missed the command you can know he was being a poor player and that if he became good at it it would ruin others games.
---
That sucks :( I understand it's the point for the survivors to survive but we ain't gotta be dicks about it. I'm sorry that happened to you.
---
At least you found a match. I've been queuing as killer for the past 5 minutes twice and nothing.
---
This looks like one of the election posters like, Vote Trapper as the next President!
---
You should make a rundown of showing survivors to actually do gens while we use these looping techniques.Gj tho m8
---
Don‚Äôt like DS? Use Make Your Choice, and play hag.
---
High ranked assholes: *Don't want to revive baby Dwight who doesn't know how Myers works.*
---
Also high ranked assholes: *Teabag Myers, knowing full well how his power works.*
---
Yeah killer matches take longer because you have to wait for 4 survivors to be able and there can only be 1 killer so there‚Äôs not much you can do about it
---
the steves ive played with so far have been either chads or little shits
---
In a world of any decent player. Way better than Spirit and instasaw billies
---
So, I started playing yesterday, and the only one I've played is Steve. I got tunneled hella hard, but I'm of the mindset that being tunneled helps you evolve. I don't agree with it, but I became a better player with all the tunneling. And as for cosmetics.... I'm waiting on my credit card payments to catch up, and I'm getting that Scoop's Ahoy outfit lol.
---
Usually it dont take this long but luckily I just got put into a game.
---
Ah yes, what a big man I am to defend myself after being called a "fat neckbeard".
---
How presumptuous to try and put down somebody for how they speak, while they put you down for pursuing academic interests.
---
What kind of monster criticizes people for writing like they're holding their breaths to finish.
---
Yep
---
PSN: OneRing4Isildur, Survivor interested in SWF, usually yellow ranks but not a bad player. Looking for anyone down to play on PS4 in 5-8 hours
---
One of the hag's tips has a grammar error as well.
---
I still think that failing to Ready Up should make you start the game injured.
---
About sound notification, I think that the Killer knowing it is acceptable.
---
tWell, if he can see the aura, it‚Äôll be just like haunted ground and they won‚Äôt know what totem is what, so realistically I think that would work better. I love the idea tho tbh.
---
Especially when you have DS
---
I would let Steve heal me because probably second wind, otherwise I would go for the gen too. Not that bad decision. The only bad decision here was demogorgon's IMO
---
A big sister would fit better as  a killer

They weren‚Äôt high rank. Before the clip started all 4 we‚Äôre slugged. I took pity on them cause it‚Äôs not fair for me to play against them in the first place. I let them pick each other up but they were just dickheads so I said fuck them
---
My laptop has performance issues
---
just a joke about the watch my dude
---
Unless it explicitly says "does not stack", it stacks
---
Hmm that's fine I guess. It would be hard to patrol three Totems that are separated away as well.
---
Legion Meg is the shit!!!!!!!!!
---
Hey, fwiw, that's an insanely specific scenario, so no hard feelings on my end. Just being a nitpicky asshole &lt;3
---
Basically any killer outside of nurse and spirit gets looped easily. This includes Billy, yet he's still regarded as one of the three best killers because of the strengths in his kit, not his shared weaknesses.
---
The shred ability isn't meant to deal with already-happening loops, it's supposed to work under any situation not a straight up loop, because during any loop where you can't maintain constant line of sight with the killer, he still has 115% movement speed and the same mind game potential as any other killer.
---
In a chase, he's still overall better than any M1 killer outside of Myers due to his exception of having an insta-down
---
Oh, I‚Äôm slow
---
This is almost as bad as ¬´survivor found¬ª when i have absolutely no clue, who, what or where
---
Or Jane or Feng or Ace or literally anyone other than the serial killers really.
---
#
---
Unless it's clown.
---
I have to agree, staying there and going to that gen was a big mistake, the only thing that I saw the demogorgon really do wrong is not taking advantage of his lunge to get you faster. Which imo gave you plenty of room to get away. He probably shouldn't have come back to check but you staying where he unhooked was the biggest mistake.
---
Man tell me about it. I got some type of revenge in the end with my no one escapes, I managed to kill 2 of them because they where t bagging me standing by the gate but it wasn‚Äôt open yet. They were freaking out after that, that‚Äôs what I imagine at least.
---
Less than a second tbh
---
He‚Äôs the buggiest killer in the game who gets instant exposed and you can‚Äôt really detect a good ghostface
---
I'm not sure if you have troubles with reading comprehension, understanding of the game mechanics, lack of intelligence or all of the above.
---
Naw I'm gonna sing ma song
---
I've had this same issue. Haven't been able to get into a KYF lobby, or "Custom Game" (as it's now called) since the update dropped.
---
I got my ruin 1 on 110th bloodweb on my p3 trapper iirc üòÇ
---
jokes on you I‚Äôm on ps4
---
Was playing a few rounds yesterday, and on more than one account, I could hear the survivor groaning and just looked around like a blind ape. One of these was admittedly corn, but I feel like such a dumbass for struggling to see them when they are probably looking right at me
---
The fog is seen when leaving a trial, and it's where the survivors and killer traverse shortly before entering a trial. It goes like this: survivors are always in the woods by the campfire, killers are snatched from their realm and dropped in the forest when the time for a trial is nearing. Survivors find relics within the forest to burn in the campfire, giving them an advantage in the next trial, after leaving, the killer then burns their offering which they also scavenged from the land surrounding the fire and proceed to follow the survivors. Within the realm where survivors reside, there are many destroyed buildings and ruins hidden within the forest that are used as housing and can be used as blindspots from the entities sight (as seen with hallowed blight, where killers are subdued and tested on by vigo, most likely)
---
This is my very first post, hello!
---
I agree, as a survivor I had better experiences but as a killer they have been brutal.
---
Jokes on you I'm already using that build
---
I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Just get into a locker. Easy
---
Now do it twice more
---
im crouched, so.... no
---
I think she got hipnotized by her own censer,
---
Sometimes, survivors deserve the NOED. And I say this as a survivor main.

Rank 1 bots would expose the inifiniloops tho

"We buffed the bloodweb to make four perks show up at once, as opposed to 2"
---
Monstrous shrine and insidious: I'm about to end this man's whole career
---
Yeah maybe because it‚Äôs the Nevada desert idk
---
Why did you use that 2 add-ons at once?
---
Did this yesterday. Was matched against much higher ranked survivors (not sure if SWF), they ran me around the whole game and taunted with flashlight clicking, but was only able to down 1 guy after exit gates were opened. Face camped and all the other survivors tried to save him and I ended up with a 4K. Best feeling ever, they were so annoying.
---
It's not bugged, you're just really screwed for RNG
---
Ghostface except his floaty bits are just hanging there now and sometimes he trips over them
---
Jokes on you I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Gotta get all that jizz. 
---
Maybe we‚Äôll get orangey Doc, Hag, plague and Clown skins.
---
I‚Äôm not leaving my meg in the dust
---
The fact that he closed the hatch then mori'd you doesn't make me mad, but the fact that you didn't wiggle and he didn't give you hatch makes me \*anger\*
---
I think people are just waiting for a very similar copycat game to come out and this to become an oversaturated genre like mobas, battle royals, and all that.  And one of them will get the balance right.
---
Because honestly... there is a demand for it.
---
I can feel your pain and I‚Äôm on the other side. I just ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù downed the person I hooked until they died, anytime I saw scratches at the two nearby generators I started haunting. Then nobody body blocked or used borrowed time.
---
I later found out it was only a bunch of rank 17-20 when I was rank 12
---
It didn‚Äôt help that nobody did generators and they all just stayed nearby even for heals.
---
I would hate to experience that at rank 20 as that‚Äôs when new players can quit.
---
When you cloak as wraith but then the woosh starts and the survivors know they're in for a bad time
---
On another note, I played against someone called 'Only noobs play spirit'. I didn't realize what their name was until they were on their second hook(Which they died on because teammates were too busy humping gens. They all died, by the way). I was playing spirit for the hell of it, and goddamn if I wasn't laughing for the remainder of the match when I read that name out of nowhere
---
Ok let me rephrase that, survivors don't get to know any information about the killer they are up against at all before the match starts and then cherry pick matches based on that. It's incredibly weak minded and hypocritical to allude to an item being unfair("outplayed") when you're selectively choosing matches.
---
Wheres demi
---
Is it just me or are Ghostface mains the new Legion mains? You know? Total cunts.
---
There are more pallets on the new map because there are next to no loops, which is good because it forces survivors to have to find new ways to run the killer other than just running around an object for 2mins until they need to throw the pallet.
---
It seems be a problem when I play survivor. When I go killer, the survivors are closer in rank most of the time. But I've been paired with 16s and below and I'm at 12 currently.
---
On serious note, who's usually upset in the end game is survivors that couldn't save that 4th one due to camp at end game. Calling out killer for camping (with open games) and not accepting "the lose". Seeing killer getting genuinely upset about survivor escaping with a lucky hatch is much more rare.
---
Where does it say that killers have and can be killed, that's some lore i want to see
---
no actually. i made everything (jacket and head) by hand
---
R.I.P. Demogorgon 
---
Mid-Low Tier Killer
---
Another non-meta shaking killer
---
May you rest in peace
---
Claudette with iron will. Because she basically is prayer beads spirit at this point
---
Jeff and that beard
---
I‚Äôve never noticed it nor do I care.
---
Nope. Only basic attacks.
---
I agree. As a killer I don‚Äôt camp or tunnel because I hate when the killer does it to me and as a survivor I don‚Äôt T bag the killer because I know it‚Äôs not always easy. To bad not everyone sees it that way :/
---
Nope only basic attack
---
Thought so
---
I love Inner strength! It's like the last infinity stone to my gauntlet of Head-on build.
---
Kinda have to agree with Claudette, with the right cosmetics she is harder to see than the rest.
---
I‚Äôll be seeing you tonight.
---
Time to camp as leatherface
---
I'm not comparing what they do but what they mean on both sides.  
---
Decisive is crutch for survivors and bbq is crutch for killers.
---
I had friends in SWF who've taunted the killer and I've always told them to knock it off because it's hard enough without feeling like you're being treated like an idiot for losing a chase or w/e.
---
And now i cant play with the guess this game is dead
---
Imma run into Area 51 tonight to get that shirtless Myers skin
---
Very helpful.
---
Expose or abuse?
---
2 questions: what is the shape? What killer is that? And also what happens when you use those offerings? I have one for the pig and freddy but I‚Äôm scared to use them because it seems like it‚Äôd be extremely different if I‚Äôm playing the trapper or something.
---
Spoken like a killer main
---
the 3 main candidates are Ace Kate and Claudette
---
Claudette is hardest to see
---
Ace is hardest to hear
---
Kate is the best "middle ground". She is quiet and a small female. But not as hard to see as claudette, and not as quiet as Ace.
---
I want one too
---
I could be wrong, but its possible ace was hiding by that bush, tree, or rock, and immediately hit bill with a syringe when he went down.  I have not heard of any glitch healing someone when they are hit with a basic attack
---
Most likely from my characters manly moustache.
---
Early Haunted Ground means the Killer has to be quick and slug Survivors, though.
---
And knifes
---
My demogorgon literally got bbq on lv 1
---
I didn't ask about your rank. I questioned how good you are as a player which is a whole different thing. The fact that you replied with your rank tells it all :)
---
I‚Äôve been thinking this myself.  Definitely best overall killer and survivor IMO
---
The Shape is Myers... the splinters just allow you to play a character you don't own. You aren't supposed to get them if you own them.
---
Yeah he just floated off of it I think, or maybe he blinked I don‚Äôt remember. But he let me go after that haha
---
Seeing a Default Nurse on PS4: lol ez game incoming
---
Seeing a PS4 Nurse with a paid cosmetic: i‚Äôll just hook myself
---
Can‚Äôt lose bloodpoints spent on adding if you don‚Äôt use addons. üòâ
---
...Noed is one of the only safety perks I can say exists for killer and even then it can be disabled via breaking totems. 
---
How do you counter Adr? Hooking only puts it on pause for if or when someone gets hooked.
---
&gt;Survivors only teabag to taunt the killer.
---
To encourage them to chase even more. I get what you're trying to say but DBD is one of those few games where by taunting you get _REWARDED_ for doing so.
---
I mean, I know it relates to other. However his character is literally called the hemomancer. So it couldn‚Äôt be named that regardless.
---
I play with my friends if they are only, if not, I play solo and don't fear it
---
I mean, that's what the entity does when you equip the normal pants with the scoops shirt. Just cut and place, like it never even happened
---
&gt; Each time you hook a Survivor that is not the Obsession and the Obsession is alive. +1 token
---
If the Obsession is alive, all Survivors get a 2/2.5/3 % stack-able penalty to Repair, Healing, and Sabotage speed for each Token.
---
Very probably both
---
This, stop spending so much time breaking unsafe pallets.
---
I was peeing while I waited and needed that last 20 seconds to panic and throw on my items and offerings
---
Literally happened to me twice I got it at level 1 and level 2
---
I just want to be able to change the Ruin skill check colour.
---
No. Just no mither.
---
I‚Äôm rank 1 but okay
---
You're not going to instantly get anything, but playing against great players teaches you what great players do. It's fine to be frustrated at the matchmaking but it's also an opportunity to improve.
---
Hes just wearing elite gamer socks
---
Solid design, but you'd probably need to have 4.4 m/s because of his mobility with locker power.
---
Because unlike you I haven't grown dependant on them and can survive a chase in a deadzone long enough to make it to a safezone. :)
---
Calling it now, this is going to be a rad April DLC package.
---
I love Elizabeth so much, she‚Äôs my favorite game character ever. I even renamed my PSN account to her name. I would die if this ever happened.
---
Lol. What a douche.
---
It says dying light!
---
Well its true. You get better by overcoming difficult situations. The problem is that a lot of people dont take that challenge and will abandon the game instead.
---
How am I supposed to improve when I have no clue what they're doing? It doesn't help, at all.
---
He‚Äôs certainly the most skilled player I‚Äôve seen. There‚Äôs a ton of people who are really good at the game and he‚Äôs definitely up there.
---
Can you recommend a name? Imma watch him too
---
I wish these offerings disappeared once you bought the Killer. I think they stop appearing if you buy the DLC from the store but if you use Cells you still get it.
---
&gt; incredibly weak minded and hypocritical
---
I choose not to play vs something i don't enjoy. I'm playing the game to have fun. And i mean, i'm not disconnecting if someone slipped a key in or looted one.
---
&gt; survivors don't get to know any information
---
I play both sides, more survivor than killer, i know how it works. I'm not here to argue about *"well survivors can't do XYZ so killers shouldn't do XYZ"*, i don't care about that "us vs them" mentality. That's irrelevant. I'm merely using the resources given to me to create a fun gaming experience. It's not like the 4 other players in the trial care about my fun :P
---
 I don't think keys are fun or fair, i don't like facing them &amp; i don't bring keys in as survivor, if that's weak minded and hypocritical, then so be it.
---
Monitor and Discordance instead of Whispers and Sloppy, imo. More fun to give heart attacks.
---
I guess thats true. They should have added Fixated and that one Jane perk which heals you when healing others
---
‚ÄúRespected game developers‚Äù

Not only was it a toxic play, it wasn‚Äôt the right one. He downs the Nancy and now he has 3 people not doing gens. The person who comes to pick up the slugged player, the slugged player, and Nancy. Now if you patrol gens and find the 4th, that‚Äôs extreme map pressure. Instead he camped and tea bagged to be toxic.
---
Your being pretty toxic
---
You mean sprint burst to a pallet? :D
---
I think this is the most fair. SWF can be utterly broken in DBD to the point that if the group is good, there's literally nothing the killer can do to get even one kill without hardcore camping/tunelling which is just not fun. I've had a match as killer where the team finished gens within ~5 minutes, and kept covering for each other which resulted in me being unable to get more than one hook. That game was just not fun, and made me switch to survivor main (still play killer somewhat, but usually rank 12+ now)
---
In my opinion, no one teabags to get more points, they just want to annoy the killer. You can get max points easily without teabagging. If the killer absolutely refuses to chase you then maybe teabagging is the way to get points.
---
NOED almost never gets disabled in solo survivor, it is not easy to cleanse all totems without any totem counters. I'm absolutely fine with adrenaline getting nerfed if noed gets nerfed with it.
---
Yeah his looping is damn scary. im scared to be a killer and get a survivor with looping and game sense as him
---
Not 100% sure but i think Zubat might be better skill wise. But its hard to be sure. I also like noob3's skills.
---
Prayer beads makes downing unnecessary though. Gen grabs all day baby.
---
Sprint burst is for baby megs, hun.
---
r/whoosh
---
By not taking the L you're going to take too seriously, so you can pay attention. Watch how they move through the map, what generators they prioritize, how they react to your mindgames. 
---
I've learned the most from rounds where I'm lucky to get a hit or two in.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6BbvCC0VI0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6BbvCC0VI0)   
---
Here my good man. I think this suits this situation just fine.
---
The devs need to watch out for all the small details
---
Shouldn't have affected it, at least for the most part. You need to complete (surviving survivors + 1) gens to spawn the hatch. I guess after killer closes the hatch it helps though, since the killer will then patrol the doors, but that'd only be for one person
---
Why waste a perk slot when i can, ya know, not play vs the item in the first place?
---
In the next hotfix they are making it show how much healing progress you have on the perk icon so it should be easier to know when you will have it.
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because No0b3 used to be the face of toxic Nea, that now he‚Äôs switched to being a Steve main all the people who tried to copy him are becoming toxic Steve mains as well. Just a theory though.
---
Having played a few games as killer I had this happen to me. Now as a survivor I try to crawl towards the killer when I get downed because they freak the fuck out and walk around looking for me it's better than t-bagging.
---
One of my first games I had a spirit and i didn‚Äôt leave the corner of the map
---
A true man of culture
---
I know. That's why I asked you.
---
I did
---
Is there an advantage to playing Spirit with a controller?
---
So why the fuck are you spamming posts after making it
---
I main Jeff, sweetie.
---
But then outside of lockers he will just be an M1 Killer. 4.4 would be too slow for chasing. While he doesn't have to set up like Demogorgon his mobility is very limited.
---
I'm still thinking of giving him a small buff on the power, then reducing his speed a little bit.
---
Then I must be the 1% is one of my new favorite perks
---
Noed is meta? What are you rank 20? Ruin maybe, but not noed

Top 10 best anime betrayals
---
Blur out the names and reupload
---
Ended up pretty much steamrolling all night until I started playing against really good people! Pretty awesome thanks for the help.
---
You cant force people to play unfun games. 
---
You cant force killers to play against 4 man SWF.
---
If the game didnt snowball so easily, or if toxicity wasnt so built into the game design, then you'd see less DC'ing. 
---
As long as there is a huge discrepency between the top and bottom tier of killers, as long as crazy OP add ons and Moris exist, as long as survivor BP gain sucks, you're gonna have DC'ing. 
---
Theres nothing more infuriating then running the killer for awhile, getting downed and hooked, and NONE of your teammates are on gens. If they are gonna waste my time, *im not gonna mine*.
---
Considering the ‚Äúbest‚Äù is relatively subjective, it‚Äôs impossible to determine. All we can do is say who we personally enjoy the most.
---
Great job
---
Chill lol. I'm a Survivor main but GhostFace Main whenever I play Killer but not everyone is like that.
---
Your shirt is correct.
---
/s
---
Thanks, Ill add them to the list. Ive been only watching DBD games on twitch right now. Cant even play Fire Emblem
---
My issue with self-care is that it allows a total reset of the damage done to a person pretty much infinitely without teamwork or a medkit. Its part of why tunneling is a thing, you can't spread damage and force survivors together or force them off of a gen to heal one another. No risks need to be taken to help. 
---
I would LOVE to spread damage, but when I have a full team of self-care going against me what choice do I have besides focusing down who I can, at that point it becomes who can I kill quickest.
---
This is me. All my SFW groups are just us being stupid and one of us dying while the others laugh.
---
Looks for me like the animation is done. And if she would do it later, he would be gone.. so for me it looked perfect
---
They had clearly planned to be toxic just because the killer wasn‚Äôt demogorgon. Watch the end where there was another Nancy waiting to drop the pallet so the first Nancy could spin in circles
---
&gt; There are plenty of survivors that can outplay spirits they just aren't whining on reddit lol
---
There is no counterplay to Spirit besides being naturally immersed.
---
yeah Monstrous Shrine is pretty useless. I still see 4man sfw sabo squads when I play killer though. Very annoying to play against.
---
Same, combined with the fact Idk if they are a newbie. 
---
I had one walk into me as pig like 5 times in one game, I couldn't bring myself to hook him and eventually just took him to my ruin so they could escape lol.
---
Just go to camera settings and remove the label when u take a photo
---
Yeah, I didn't realize that initially, which is why I tried again but when I went for the hatch after trying again, the killer decided to close it in front of me and then just shook his head. I guess he was upset that he didn't kill anyone in the match.
---
Bro I want a prom night tux and dress for Frank and Julie
---
Why are his hands a different color than his arms
---
Thanks dude
---
I got added to a survive with friends group where they all took it very seriously and it wasn't as fun. Personally  I feel like voice chat is kinda circumventing a major challenge  when  playing survivor  ( working together  without words) but it's  what ever. It's  a game and I swear a lot of these people  get enjoyment out if making the game less enjoyable  for anyone else. It's  gross.
---
Yeah I dont gg for camping partially because it's a bad play and they'll never stop if you encourage
---
And because they have those perks they lack other ones like BBQ and Chili, nurse's calling, pop goes the weasel, etc.  Thanatophobia doesn't really do anything but change your color bar for progress to red and add less than 10 seconds to gen repair.
---
Yeah, I'm really starting to dig Demi G. We didn't have a killer that was literally a monster, complete with primal roaring and a goddamn pounce. Seeing it carry people is still weird, though.
---

Unless you reported him in game, posting here won‚Äôt do anything. Especially since their steam name isn‚Äôt unique like their steam ID would be
---
I shall no longer refer to ballsy moves, but now call them godsy moves in honor of this dude's massive set &amp; skill.
---
&gt; Wouldn't the killer just camp the slugged body?
---
No i explained it in my post. Killer can't pick up the bodies so if he camped it all game, the survivor would wait for exit gates to open and exit from there.
---
&gt; If you were the killer you'd just run deerstalker every game, wait until the survivor recovered and pop them down again. It wouldn't change much of anything regarding camping.
---
Survivor can simply take his time crawl as far away as possible, and then recover.
---
Such a shit joke
---
That‚Äôs a shame. It‚Äôs not anyone‚Äôs fault that the survivors couldn‚Äôt get out the map. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be a little understanding and let you have the hatch. 
---
I had a killer let me survivor, after killing the others because of the ‚Äúwiggle glitch‚Äù. I had a wiggle bar the whole match, while trying to run. He apparently noticed that.
---
I did report them. Just letting the sub know if you go against him
---
So your main argument is that we wont see sabo squads anymore? Not a big loss imo :P
---
Nah, for each person out and about saboing hooks that's one less person on gens.  If you don't apply the pressure to keep them off you're not playing well enough.  Not to mention sabo without a toolbox takes forever, and if you do get that 4 man hypothetical sabo squad, that's on you for not equipping franklin's demise.
---
You must be excited that Terry got in to Smash, yeah?
---
For some reason you have to own the whole dlc to not get splinters

I try to be a good sport but I have honestly  thought about  backing out of a match when I see a survivor   have a flashlight. I just know there is going to be some asshole attention  whoring and clicking the damn thing at me just so they can constantly  blind me. I don't  even use them when I play survivor  I hate them so much.
---
I was like: shit op medic build but then....i SAW IT...
---
Not really. I don't own a Nintendo console.
---
^(Plus I shower too often to be a Smash player.)
---
I don't think lighting works like that
---
It's not the only instance of visible seams, either. The Ace Chinese New Year head shows a neck seam when combined with certain Ace tops too.
---
I mean you're absolutely right. There are certain mechanics that literally only exist to create toxicity which the devs refuse to patch out of the game. I know it's kind of a meme to say this buy why does teabagging and flashlight clicking still exist? It would be so easy just to program an internal cool-down for these abilities but instead they still let these mechanics remain in the game despite all the people complaining about it.
---
Well, that balances out with they fact that there are 4 survivors  and one killer. The odds are already stacked against the killer as it is.
---
Oh hey another one of these! Paging /u/Peanits &amp; /u/not_queen_bhvr and hell why not /u/lmclean_bhvr too this time for some visibility as per usual with these posts. Still asking for some accessibility features 3 years later guys - what's up?
---
Yes this has happened to me a few times when it clearly should‚Äôve happened.
---
If he waited 1 more second...
---
It doesn't.
---
Tunneling actually is a strategy at times, this killer just played it very wrong. Don't get me wrong, I don't condone tunneling out of spite, just to gain advantage as a single kill makes a giant difference.
---
Basically this. I think DS as an anti-tunnel perk is fine, but the problem I have with the perk is that it becomes 60 seconds of "the Killer can't touch me." This leads to people doing some downright stupid plays where they get unhooked and start doing a gen right beside the hook, and then when the Killer comes they just keep doing the gen cause they'll either get grabbed and DS, get slugged and then get picked up, or get ignored.

The bloodpoint increase is why I love that perk. The hook thing is just an added bonus. Best shrine purchase I've done (and only)
---

What are red ranks doing in my yellow rank games :(
---
Hah, if you don't have BBQ and chili you should just bite the bullet and get leather daddy.  
---
I mean, I don't really enjoy playing clown anymore but I run pop goes the weasel on almost all my killers so I'd say it was worth it.
---
Oof.
---
"and don't fall for window techs or jukes while stepping out or running along the outside"
---
The shape is Michel myers, he is just called the shape in dbd. If you use a pig or freddy offering you will spawn as that killer, but with no perks and no add-ons. After the game you will still have the perks and add-ons.
---
Never thought I'd be happy to see a killer get dsed
---
correct
---
The game is ment to be fun for all parties. If a someone wants to play killer and doesn't find having to deal with keys fun, it is in thier right to dodge that match. It's  extremely  entitled  to act like the killer players have to please the survivor or they ArNt BeInG fair. The only way for a killer to get points is but hunting survivors, hooking survivors, or breaking generators. The are all alone in the match. Survivors  get points by breaking totems,  evading capture,  being close to the killer, helping other survivors, working on generators, opening gates. On top of that they can get around on of the main challenges  by going though voice chat. And still that isn't  enough. I've  played both sides  I know  how it goes. So if a killer wants to dodge a match because  they see and item or anything that would take away from thier enjoyment  from a game they get to. We get to do survive with friends they get to pick and choose  what matches they want to do. That is fair.
---
Alright sorry then. I just wanted to give my opinion on something. I didn‚Äôt know DS used to work that way because I only just started playing a few months ago
---
u/j1ggl
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main. My friends and I make killers leave probably 1/3 games. This post isnt for green rank shitters. At red ranks you can bully killers. If you think otherwise you are new or bad. Go main killer and play in red ranks if you think I‚Äôm wrong.
---
Ohh that makes sense. It‚Äôs basically like a free trial to see how to play them. Alright cool!
---

Nah, it‚Äôs a better version of the unknown egg, which is a really good add on, with a side ability
---
Fun fact of Shame Time: we had a killer who was Hella campy and all I could think of to do was teabag across from a window to try and get his attention so he would leave the hook and chase me. It worked? But I died.
---
The heartbeat one might be kind of bad but everything else looks pretty solid, im guessing it was to prevent insidious or w/e
---
Puppers is the most fun streamer.  He's not the best (he's still very very skilled at the game) but he's the most positive.
---
Zubat is the best killer and survivor
---
That's what I'm doing rn
---
This made my day
---
whats the story behind mori the scoops ahoy steve?
---
I'd disagree with the overestimation of the amount part simply because I utilize the minute prematch to check everyone's friends lists while waiting on everyone to ready up. There's a ton of 2/3-man SWFs in my region at least. I just exploit their overly altruistic friendship in-game instead of complaining or dodging however.
---
Yeah, the way DS used to work is it was always active from the start of the match. This meant if you saw claw marks on a portrait you just left that person alone until you were ready to surrender all pressure, they were close enough to a hook that you could dribble them (repeatedly drop and pick them up), or you could force them to hop off your shoulder into a dead end or down the basement stairs.
---
pulled BBQ off the shrine a couple weeks ago so now I have even less reason to buy bubba :P
---
I'd buy clown but I'm not very interested in him either (and he's ugly, sorry). I'm considering buying plague to try her out + corrupt intervention so I can put it on my legion
---
Well GL
---
You usually have enough distance by the time you're around. Not as strong at the end of the wall without the little nook.
---
Long wall is annoying because it's a *long wall*. Sometimes a tree or small debris/ hook spawns with it as well making one of the edges even a little larger of a perimeter.
---
Okay demogorgan.
---
Well he clearly doesn't know what he's doing if he's camping.  
---
Borrowed time lets you go right through the chainsaw tantrum, and you gain a lot of distance from him when you get hit while he's still sawing.
---
I've been running Spine Chill so much lately that I feel naked without it lol
---
That‚Äôs kinda dumb. Glad it‚Äôs only active after being hooked
---
Ill let him have it if you say skilled streamer because im sure there are tons of people who dont stream and play really well
---
I wouldn't even be mad if I got looped by survivors with names like Stun! or Killer, Killed lol
---
Heh heh heh ye boi

I‚Äôm consistently rank 1/2, I‚Äôm just saying from experience and what I know to be true for myself and my friends. Also on console so it‚Äôs generally a more casual experience, I can‚Äôt speak for PC.

The only plothole I can remember is that at the start of Saw IV, they say "Amanda couldn't have gotten her up there on her own"
---
At first this line makes sense as we know from saw III that Amanda was one of Jugsaw's proteges. However, the plot hole becomes apparent when it is revealed that Saw IV plays alongside the events of Saw III. And thus, this scene actually takes place before it is known that Amanda is a protege.
---
Seeing the Demogorgon stomping around makes me wish even more for an Alien/Ripley DLC.
---
I mean the unhooker is the one i'm worried about more than the unhooked lol. How do you unhook in the first place with a LF face camping revving his chainsaw...
---
Now imagine pretty much everyone using it.

If FPS games can do it. I'm sure DbD can.

well, to each their own!

Because every 3 months we get a chapter. And well now i have to wait 6 months for New chapter, because new chapter sucks and i won t buy it. And no i am not saying that demo or survivors are bad, they are ok, just not worth spending 12‚Ç¨. Stranger things is so overrated show, i would rather get hit by car, then watch that piece of shit show. On some 80s music on YouTube you can see comments like who is here because of Stranger things. I like to read people toughts on song, not fucking Stranger shit comments, go on Stranger shit videos and go comment there. So what did i get after ghostface, answer is nothing special. So for 6 months no new content for me. We could get a lot better chapter Then ST, like original killer, or some normal licensed chapter like hellraiser, IT ETC... But no we get this shitty license. Who the fuck would ever say "hey guys we need Stranger things chapter". So If i can t play new chapter, at least i can enjoy it and mori steve and Nancy.
---
I play with 2 other friends and every single match is like this I'm 4 and they are both around 8. The 4th survivor is always between 15-20 and the killer tends to match the rank of the 4 almost exactly. We don't play like dicks but it's still quite unfair for the killer.
---

---
Eyy a fellow tapp player with that cosmetic
---
Looping is not toxic, imo. It's literally what they want us to do. Face camping is probably the worst behavior you can have as a killer because you're basically stopping play to taunt a survivor.
---
This with Pwyf would make it possible to move at 140% speed, I‚Äôd much rather not
---
I have to agree, these guys were really good and we were playing against a rank 16 pig with 1 level 1 perk, she didn‚Äôt stand a chance, I left first chance I got
---
First of all, horrible idea
---
Second of all how do you injure a killer
---
Technically they own the character of ‚ÄúThe Ghost Face‚Äù (the mask is the license) so they could potentially give us a Reporter Jed Olsen cosmetic without the mask and wearing a suit with a camera around his neck.
---
Self-Care takes waaay too long to use to be worth it. It wastes too much time.  
---
If you're getting outplayed by Self-Care of all things, I highly recommend using Sloppy Butcher and/or improving drastically at the game.
---
&gt;adding the ability to sandbag
---
That's a blanket term for screwing someone else over. That isn't a developer enforced behavior, that's from other people. How can you even think this way, lmao.
---
Dude, I can't even be mad. I main killer, and if this happened to me in game, I'd be pissed, but my god, that was the literal definition of a 300 IQ play.
---
Head on + DS + Inner + QnQ is nasty af. I stuck to Fixated + Sprint burst, way less toxic and still Fun
---
Can confirm, got hit by the back of his hand earlier and got downed
---
We don‚Äôt do that here

Oh I get it.  "Salt for his fries".  See, this is almost as bad as when people were using twitch emotes outside of twitch and expecting people to know what they were.  Like I said.  Silly.

Survivor tip:  If the killer face camps you after you ran them around the map, you‚Äôve already won.
---
It‚Äôs not that deep I just said fries üçü
---
Not all SWFs are toxic shits... some just wanna have a fun game
---
why idiotic post like this allowed?
---
The Shadow realm doesn't exist in the Japanese version. The shadow realm was created in the dub to stop characters from dying.
---
In the Japanese version, for example, in the battle where Yami Yugi and Kaiba were dueling the rare hunters, they were dueling on top of a building where should a team lose, the glass they were standing on would break and the losing team would fall to their death.
---
In the dub version, the losing team would fall into a portal that leads to the shadow realm.
---
I'll drop a video which discussions the shadow realm topic [here](https://youtu.be/ytWcybZg_5s)
---
&gt;Stranger things is so overrated show, i would rather get hit by car, then watch that piece of shit show.
---
So you've never even seen it and you're shit talking it, lol.
---
&gt;On some 80s music on YouTube you can see comments like who is here because of Stranger things. I like to read people toughts on song, not fucking Stranger shit comments, go on Stranger shit videos and go comment there.
---
Who the fuck reads youtube comments, lmao. 
---
There are subreddits for music and 80s music specifically if you *really* want to talk about it but I have a feeling you just want something to complain about.
---
&gt;So what did i get after ghostface, answer is nothing special. So for 6 months no new content for me.
---
That was your choice, The world doesn't revolve around you so stop acting like an entitled little kid. 
---
There was new content, You just choose not to get it because "Strange things too mainstream for me."
---
You don‚Äôt necessarily have to play Clown. Just dump points into him and unlock his teachable. In some cases, Pop is better than Ruin
---
Except there's most likely a reason these things get spammed in the upper ranks.  And you know exactly why, don't you?
---
Noob
---
Nope. The shadow realm was used in the dub to censor death.
---
I mean everyone likes an easy game every now and then, if i feel like an easy game as killer ill throw on Noed and if survivor adrenaline. Both perks are strong and makes the game a cakewalk.
---
There's ways around it as killer, such as not committing to chases in tough areas early, throwing out wild cards or playing it safe depending on how you think the skill of the survivor is.
---
A lot of it is about figuring out how good a survivor is and getting a sense for where the survivors are moving on the map/ letting far off corner gens get finished.
---
I actually spend time being productive and putting pressure on survivors instead of counting down ds timers but I guess each person has his own playstyle

Bamboozle is meme'd as the perk you run if you don't wanna mindgame/ have fun
---
I like the Dwight just casually walking out of the way at the start.
---
It's not deep, it's dumb. 
---
You just helped me get what he was trying to say.
---
This is the type of post that only adds to the toxicity in the community. 
---
It‚Äôs not about the killer caring about the survivors fun, it‚Äôs about PLAYERS caring about other PLAYERS fun. And yeah it applies both way. Point is, you should care because it will make for a more positive and enjoyable game for everyone.
---
Think about it like this: you get 100% bloodpoints normally. With bloodhunt, you now get 200% (double). If you use a bloody party streamer, it becomes 300% (triple). 2 ppl use it, it stacks and it's 400%, etc.
---
On top of that, if you use the david king perk no man left behind for bonus bloodpoints (survivor), or bbq and chili (killer).
---
Ayyyyyyy, it‚Äôs me
---
Even the new bloodweb system isn't helping us find bbq.
---
That could have been me, cause I got a REALLY annoying stupid Toxic group of Survivors as Trapper today, the whole game a Toxic David who T bagged every 5 Nanoseconds at the Pallet did end up running to the Exit gate where all the others Body Blocked me and T bagged me afterwards. It was the ONE time I didn't put NOED on
---
I use that same build and have some very well with it.
---
GOTTEM!
---
I think it was related to server lag
---
Now this is gaming
---
Poor baby killer :/
---
They are better than all of ash's perks so...
---
Yeah definitely agree this whole game is all about mind games.  Surviving got easier once i understood killers, also being a survivor main helped quite a few times as the killer in terms of guessing their next play.  
---
Thanks for that, definitely agree with everything you said.
---
Why did his dumbass take so long to hit yall lmao
---
&gt; anyone can play spirit with no experience and always win against rank 1 4k hour 4man swf teams while also preparing tea inside of 2 minutes
---
I'm saying you're far from the realm of "scary good spirit" because immersion plays simply do not work against spirit who play to counter good chase survivors.
---
Phase at loop and the survivor walks away? Find the end of the scratch marks, deny use of pallet, unphase and see their dumbass in a deadzone with no escape
---
The thing is survivors legitimately can't tell if they're going against total morons or people playing spirit optimally 99% of the time, so you can make correct plays as survivor but get punished because the survivor found you by accident. And once a survivor is injured you have to go out of your way to fail to follow up; it's a guaranteed free down basically every time.
---
We get it, matchmaking is bad blah blah blah
---
Spirit? Lmao all you need is headphones
---
It is your opinion that it is justified to dodge and cherry pick matches but it is a fact that doing so while complaining about another ingame mechanic is hypocrisy.  That is what I am saying, plain and simple.
---
Forget to switch accounts bud?
---
As a colorblind person I am begging for the ability to change scratch mark colors. For my colorblindness, scratch marks that appear on trees, dirt, grass, wooden structures ect are invisible unless I'm basically at the spot the marks start freshly spawning.
---
However, colors bleed across lines for a lot of people and so making it "change scratch marks to a different color." probably won't solve the whole problem. Blue scratch marks would probably disappear more readily on the industrial maps for me and so being able to choose the scratch mark colors for each map would need to be implemented.
---
I‚Äôm so bad with the flashlight. :( I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever managed to blind the killer with one. Sometimes I bring them then either forget I have it entirely or try to use it and fail miserably. üòÇ
---
Aayyee
---
Pretty much
---
For some reason the ready button would be disabled when the timer reached 15 seconds. Don't know why that's a thing.
---
Let's  agree to disagree.
---
Whats the best killer in the game for you?
---
I get that this is a shitpost but honestly killers like Spirit and Clown should be in the higher tiers. Mechanically a lot of these killers may or may not require some skill, but actually effectively playing as and winning with them? It's a completely different story. Clown, Spirit, Wraith, Trapper etc all need serious work to actually be effective with, and against good survivors you're gonna need a miracle to do anything.
---
That epic moment when the killer tunnels you because you head on stunned them once
---
Legion requires a moderate level of skill IMO
---
I don't think you ever played Legion against red and purple ranks
---
I need to try it more too.
---
That... That hurt so bad, poor ash have 3 useless perks, even quentin have a good one
---
This is disgusting. Why is spirit so balanced...
---
I have a good sport scoops Steve the hatch the other day. Scoop Steve best Steve.
---
Not saying gg is not really discouraging, but I understand what you mean.
---
It only requires skill if you‚Äôre trying to do it from a distance. If you‚Äôre close to the survivor at all you‚Äôre going to hit them. And on top of that, when you do hit them they can‚Äôt use pallets, or do any other action for a few seconds so it really screws you over.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wearing now! I just had to appreciate the P3 full outfit for a day before putting on the scoops + bloody face
---
Spirit Fury + Enduring
---
I can't agree or disagree with you because you never touched on the actual point.
---
ngl cold stare just seems like a worse brutal strength
---
honestly, deserved, what a little shitbag
---
You a survivor main?
---
Sadly, it still won‚Äôt stop DCs...
---
3 words. Steam achievement manager.
---
Damm it
---
Yeah, it's big brain time
---
As a killer main it's the drops not the pallets. Pallets are so unsafe. Unless a survivor has balanced landing the map is pretty easy to deal with.
---
This is what happens with keys at high rank games.
---
The killer finishes one person, 1 gen remains and the killer has a good 3 gen setup.  
---
Then suddenly the game is over as the three remaining survivors escape through a hatch.
---
Yeah RIP. Mom was the best perk too...
---
Nea and Scoops Ahoy boi
---
Yea, but Freddy can lay the dream snares and dream pallets. Demogorgon just has the portal. Seems like theres more involved with placing snares to try and trigger where the survivors will walk.
---
Eyyy thats the weed number in the bottom right, nice drawing btw

You see how specific scenarios you had to describe? 2 of them will only be usefull in 1 scenario, that what make them bad, perks need to be versatile, DBD is a amazing game where a match may have 10.000 flaws, so you need perks to counter that flaws, why would I waste perk slot that will reduce 10.000 problems to 9.999? BHVR need to make stronger perks for survivors/killer, what If babysitter gave a "bond" where for a certain time, any hit received would transfer to the perk user? What if camaradie actually paused the struggle for as long as someone is near the hook? What if second wind gave you a sprint after being unhooked? What if Cruel Limits blocked pallets? What if Surge proc with lullaby or Overcharge? BHVR are too afraid to make stuff
---
Not. bug reports, tech support posts are against the rules.
---
Sorry about all the eraser marks, his head was a pain to draw
---
That nancy wasted a pallet smh
---
I always go try hard bro. Nobody on this game likes having fun. The past week I've played against either extremely toxic infinite loopers, full stacks of immersive spine chill p3 Claudettes, and when I try to switch off of killer briefly, a bunch of cancerous little cunts who lead the killer to you and fast vault to give up your position. Survivors just seem to go out of their way to fuck with me even if I'm on their team. I'm like, this close to just taking one day off where I just go out of my way, all day, to ruin everyone's game. If you can't tell, my enthusiasm for this game has hit an all time low as of right now.
---
Idc if I make people salty on either side. I play however I wanna play bc it‚Äôs just a game
---
Idk man dodging lobbies because of a key seems really questionable when you can counter it very easily. 
---
Or even better if you see a key, out Franklins on. Swat the key and DC afterwards. You don‚Äôt get to play against the key, the survivor loses the key. Easy.
---
Better question why are they bronze?
---
Equating lobby dodging to swf or claiming it's justified is your opinion and not what was being discussed. I wasn't pointing out the hypocrisy of dodging an item and then using it but complaining about said item as unfair and engaging in unfair behavior yourself. Who enjoys spending extra time in lobbies when you already sat in queue? Who is that fun for?
---
Looping and gen rushing arent toxic, they are just survivors playing optimally. Camping isnt playing optimally. Tunneling could be, but it ruins the game for someone. There are no rules thougg so people should play how they want and just take all the salt that comes with it and move on.
---
Swear every Demo I've met has been playing the Killer like a discount Wraith. It's sad because when I actually play against a Demo who isn't camping the match is genuinely tense and exciting. But instead I just get another game where "Oh Demo left through their portal! Annnnnnd they're 3 feet away."

Yeah, I dont need bp most of the time so when we farm nowadays its kinda boring and I just want it over with. Along time ago I loved to farm though. I will still farm if people want but prefer not to
---
the old animation made setting traps a lot slower. although i did like the old animation.
---
Sorry, why are you complaining? You looped like a pro, and you lived. I'm confused.
---
DS is annoying, and the only reason he caught your DS was because you were the only one visible when he eventually came back after your first hook. The tunnel after DS was likely because of the DS.
---
im convinced this community cant read
---
Thank u for the explanation!
---
You‚Äôre so cool
---
Maybe a gold will get you some visibility
---
Start of pallet stunned for however how long you didn‚Äôt click ready for.
---
Behaviour be like *programming a functional video game noises.*
---
Can the next survivor offering be, Burnt GPU: Increases chance of encountering Freddy during your next trial.
---
Funniest is when survivors try to farm and whine when you as a killer don‚Äôt farm but kill em all
---
&gt;They adapt to this by becoming part of the problem. 
---
Ngl I picked up Ghostface just for the ability to teabag back. It's amazing how such a little mechanic can help me destress lol. If a survivor teabags me at a pallet I just do it back and ignore them, or if I can catch them, hook them and teabag them a bit. 
---
Even made a friend out of a chronic teabagger at every pallet. They ended up escaping but since we were having a teabag battle in game, they were laughing about it in post game lobby. Played a bit of SFW together for a bit before I realized he really was an ass and was bullying killers in game and post game lobby. I don't play with him anymore.
---
We need a Pablo survivor
---
Maybe more people  would be willing to play killer if the survivors  weren't  so shitty? Idk? It sucks that the wait times are so long for survivors . It's  frustrating  but I understand  why. You need to call out the toxic survivors who ruin the game for anyone who wants to play killer. No one wants to play a game that isn't fun  and honestly  it's  pretty selfish that you expect people  to do so simply  because  you don't  want to wait so long. If anything  let this be a lesson, make the game enjoyable for everyone  or you wont  get to play at all do to a lack a killers. Or is that not fair enough  for you? Jesus the lack of empathy  is outstanding.
---
And of course they DC. Nothing ever changes does it?
---
It was downvoted because it is trash. The thing he mentioned is exactly why DS was changed. You get an extra life no matter what. Running a free second chance perk without any downside? Omegalul

I thought that was the new meta build? No mither, self care, second wind, and inner strength. No plague will stand a chance
---
No mercy
---
You are right, but based on the descriptions of the shadow realm being a place of suffering and torment, it just is Hell.
---
This is the guy that complains about survivors t-bagging
---
Probably won't happen because then they would have to add a lot of extra animations for no extra profit.
---
Ayoooo
---
The game put me, a rank 19 killer (only due to reset tbf), against an all-green SWF. I got two and almost got the third, but still. I only got lucky as I chose to bring along Iron Grasp.
---
It is sad for me that Babysitter and second wind would be viable alternatives to Borrowed time and DS,if they were buffed.
---
The change i would like to Babysitter is to give a sprint burst to the unhooked person,as it would give a meaning to disappearing scratch marks. As it is now,it is matter only when the killer doesn't have directly vision to the hook and it is not far enough,so it will think to come for you.In every other occasion,we will make it or borrowed time is way better 
---
As for second Wind,I really like it (the perk i liked the most when i heard the perks first time),but healing 1 state is very unreliable condition. DS is way more reliable to save from going down.The healing other  req would need to leave,but maybe it is needed a req after the unhook to have not cries from killers as a new DS.Maybe more time to activate? Need to be outside or inside the Terror radius.
---
I hope you have fun at the wedding

Lag switching Leatherface or shit connection leather face. If shit connection, it‚Äôs also partly OP‚Äôs connection. Emphasis on partly.

I got bubba for BBQ and Chili.. entire time I complained saying he was boring or not fun to play as.. fast forward and I pretty much exclusively use him to farm BP cause bubba is actually fun and once you learn not to chainsaw walls it's actually pretty easy to play him
---
Aww thanks!
---
Let's tag /u/mcote_bhvr in gilding celebration too then. People are willing to give money to another company just so you guys will see the accessibility issues in your game!
---
well he is one of only two killers who can teabag. So that makes the toxic really obvious.
---
The game is survivor favored in red ranks.
---
I think it might be exactly that. Toxic is definitely being thrown a lot in the gaming world.  Thanks for that
---
The color design in this game is just kinda bad sometimes lol, they really need to tweak the coloring of some realms so that they don't drown out basic info that is supposed to be visible and accessible in general, it's just even more obfuscated for people with color vision problems.

It is a shame that one second of self care makes Second Perk unable to activate.It feels a bit bullshit from me.
---
Fuck the snow on that make makes me lag like shit
---
The reason why the wait times are so long for survivor is because less people  want to play killer due to it not being as fun. You don't  care you just expect  people to grin and bare it because  you want to get in a match. How selfish. Why don't  you ay killer if you want dont  want to wait.  I understand  why I have to wait and if someone  dodges it and I have to wait longer it sucks but I understand. Just because  you don't  want to get the point doesn't  mean mo point is being made. It is the survivors  fault that the wait time is to long. If you want more people  to play killer then start calling out the asshole survivors . Unless  you are one of those people  who ruin the game for everyone  and don't  care because  you only are concerned about how it makes you feel. Your not going to change my mind. And really  until survivors  stop acting like dicks the wait times will  get worse.

I've been playing DBD since October of last year. I've come to notice just how broken the game is with all the bugs. Major updates and DLCs like this one come with a whole new set of bugs and issues. It's a given at this point. New cosmetics? Sure and here's some new bugs to go along with it.
---
How is looping toxic?  It's literally the only way to escape/"fight" the killer.  
---
And Gen rushing isn't really a thing.  Gen rushing is just the survivors doing the objective that lets them escape.  
---
The problem here is you, you need to be able to read the loops, mindgame and know which pallets to break and which ones to ignore in the chase.  You won't experience gen rushing if you hook survivors, slug, or keep them injured.
---
Freddy has the advantage of being [Canon](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oHZkNFFQSbM)
---
*puts myself on the hook* 
---
I‚Äôll just be here
---
What is DS? Having trouble with the lingo.
---
New game mode. More of a horror game than a pure chase game, just some random ideas:
---
Survivors are in 1st person
---
Can look around on gens that are more interactive, doesn't take as long to repair
---
Killers made slower but a survivor running past a pallet in a chase automatically throws it down out of fear, to remove pallet looping.
---
After a survivor is hooked they can be mori'd as long as another survivor has been hooked after them to give an incentive to not tunnel, killers will have to be made weaker due to having an ebony mori every game if they don't tunnel. 
---
Sacrifice bar stops if the killer is close to the hook unless they're in a chase to prevent camping but also doesn't punish killers who get chased around a hook survivor. 
---
Remove terror radius and any aura reading for both sides, every killer will be able to jump scare. 
---
Add more sound ques like stepping on branches like in the opening.
---
Darken the maps up, add more hiding spots similar to lockers.
---
I just want more horror.
---
Corner traps.  Might as well call that the Self Care Gamer trap.  I bet it's snapped the ankles of many a P3 Claudette.
---
Well gee, maybe you should be angry at the survivor  who taught the killer that if they see that item they aren't  going to have a good time. Or you can just be butthurt that it mildly inconveniences you. Recently  I have been forced to play killer ( due to the wait times as survivor) I know that if one of the survivors  has a flashlight  I'm  not going to have as much fun. That fucker is going to chase me around clicking  the damn thing, blinding me and twerking the entire time. I have thought  about dodging  the the match when I see it but I deal with it because  i want to be nice. ( i don't  understand  why because  as you show. A lot of survivors  don't  take the killers into consideration. ) But when I play survivor  ( which is most of the time) I refuse to bring a flashlight because  I  don't  like going against  it so why would I inflict it against  others. You are upset about a killer dodging a match because  of an item simply because  it makes you have to wait longer. You want someone  else to have a bad time just so you can have enjoyment, but you can't  possibly  understand  why they might not want to play a game with that item. Or you just don't  care. Killer mains don't  exist just for the entertainment  of survivor mains. The game game can't  even function  without  killers and yet you just think about how it makes you feel. This type is behavior  pisses me off so much.

actually BeHavior is right for removing it, wearing a watch in any fast service food is a health violation

So then it's working as intended.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing Billy well groomed and in a vest tbh.

Also, clown is from 30's, iirc.
---
New players prepare for 20 minute games and then a DC at the end by the killer which is painful I know but don't get your hopes up
---
well fuck
---
Not all killers camp the hook that hard.
---
Whats the first perk on the third guy down??
---
Hacked your Blood Points I see. Nice I'm a cheater too
---
I think the main issue is that people who arent colorblind could easily exploit that to make it easier to see auras and scratch marks themselves
---
I just can't even imagine a case where tbagging in a video game is relatable to using a racial slur but I guess we just perceive it differently
---
Decisive Strike. a Laurie Strode perk that allows you to escape the killers grasp if you get down and picked up within a certain time of being unhooked
---
"Quick"
---
The hotfix will be changing the add on and making the shredding pallets a default behavior.
---
I thought this the other day glad I‚Äôm not the only one
---
I never really like the tips, most of them are either literally how the game is played or stuff you figure out within your first 10 or so games, none of them are really all that useful
---
Not if they wait out the 60 seconds. Hence why a cut off may be beneficial.
---
Lmao, so you have a killer who gets the first hit for free, can keep survivors either injured or healing all game, have NOED, and STILL the survivors manage to do all 5 totems and all 5 gens against you ü§£
---
The issue is with you kid. Get good.
---
Auras and scratch marks are meant to be visible to killers, so it doesn't offer any more information than it already does if the color was made brighter. There's no advantage to be had, it's not brightening the game as a whole, just changing the color of the deep red auras and scratch auras to something more visible.
---
Devs said 60fps on console?? Where?? I can‚Äôt wait ü§§
---
if there is not enough survivors there is just not enough survivors
---
Imagine crawling under pallets! Sadly very few games change their design structure to suit different types of character model heights.

Chucky would be too scary to play against imagine how sneaky a crouching by default character is, but with good speed basically Pig/Legion.

---
I'm colorblind and it's the main reason I don't play killer. I can't see blood stains, scratch marks or aruas at all. There was no colorblind mode on the original red dead redemption and I would have to pause the game and memorize my parhs because I couldn't see the red line on the HUD.
---
That‚Äôs just a dick move though.

---
I didn‚Äôt say it was effective. The poor guy lobby dodges keys. Like, there‚Äôs no reasoning with someone as unnerved as they.
---
I fail to see how them running Decisive means you didn't tunnel them.  Decsive only works if you attempt to pick up the same character you just downed within a minute.  If you routinely eat d strikes you definitely tunnel.  They should be the rarest of occasions to trigger DS if you play to switch targets.
---
HA HA, THATS FUCKING KARMA FOR YOU!
---
You know I watch streamers too but all the Do is just run around a pallet and then slam it down. No real jungle gym runs.
---
If you dc, you just shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to play another game until the old one is over
---
Bwahahaha. That's why I love playing Hag. Jump scares for days.
---
Can you please explain this?
---
I've been spreading your gospel to the masses https://imgur.com/gallery/1H6GV26

That scenario is far rarer where you happen to only spot the just unhooked player alone.  More often than not killers see that person and a full health person and simply choose to tunnel the unhooked anyways.  Though in the rare and yes it should be rare scenario you just pointed out the way I play that is down them and slug for map pressure.  It forces at least one of them if not more off the gens and I continue on with my game to chase and down someone else to keep them scrambling to perform altruism.  Every second spent performing altruism is time not spent on the gens.
---
I thought they cant genrush because they're getting hit by his "Pathing and rotation" mantra. And once he realizes a strong loop or good looper he switches targets. Guess i'll compare him with Zubat since people are voting for him
---
Yep. They also said that these posts can only be posted on ‚Äúrage Wednesday‚Äù now. Despite the ones being deleted being flaired either salt/rant or screenshot....*on WEDNESDAY*.

That wasn‚Äôt very wazaa of that Ghostface.

Urban isn't that great but yeah I would've thought Balanced would've put her there. But no, thank Streetwise for her placement.

Love the Charlie Brown reference
---
God you gave me flashbacks to when I played fortnite where the average skilled player acts just like that. 
---
And dbd is way more enjoyable without voice com for me. I had to quit playing swf because it was taking the fun out of the game. Just really repetitive to me going in with the same teammates every time and it got old listening to someone laughing maniacally and making sure we heard about it because they pallet stunned or juked the killer like one or two times before going down fairly quick. And because I didn‚Äôt do the same thing with my plays they never had to hear about them which resulted in them thinking I was doing nothing. Like just because I didn‚Äôt want to act like them and find any opportunity to prove myself and yell about what I did then I must suck. Because pure logic indicates that if you‚Äôre good at the game then you need your own head shoved wayyyy up your own ass and tell everyone in the chat every little play or else you must not be doing shit. I play pure solo now and love it like I loved the game from the start. Feels good getting rid of toxic people. I just saw it as a growing experience. I honestly didn‚Äôt realize how much I didn‚Äôt enjoy playing dbd with them until I stopped and fell back in love with the game.
---
So I see lots of guides on looping, are there guides for killers to bust loops, or is it just ‚Äúget looped and wait till they make a mistake‚Äù?
---
As killer, I just bail when I see a skilled looper, but now I want to get better at chases.
---
I‚Äôm personally tired of these posts. At this point, every person knows about the rank mismatch, especially the devs.
---
You made a post on this forum about playing 150 days ago and are claiming to be a new player ü§î
---
You're new which is why you think you're losing games by NOT camping and tunneling.  The truth is if you stick to the game and rank up good survivors will destroy that playstyle by gen rushing you mercilessly and you'll struggle to pip even when games do go your way as you rank up.  You need to learn the mechanics of the game still.  Chiefly how to counter loops, how to identify loops that have no counterplay so you know what areas to avoid and how to apply intense map pressure to slow the gens down.  This comes with practice and time.
---
Which, the Myers thing? When he's Tier 1, his left hand is open and dangling at his side. At 2, his left hand is clenched in a fist. At 3, he has the clenched fist and holds the knife differently. I also believe some of his perks make slight differences in his posture, but I'm not positive about that.
---
Maybe you lose the terror radius after exiting a locker for 10-15 seconds.
---
Shirtless Myers appears:
---
Wow, I should stick my penis in that.
---
You've never played leather face before you dumb kid
---
why do I genuinely get a half chub when reading these
---
Hahahah
---
Take my money TAKE IT
---
It is rare I agree.
---
That would be Dead Hard but hard to know since i changed the icons of some perks to my liking.
---
It can be both to be honest ;)
---
A lot of survivors have bad habits that hurt the team more than help. The way I see it is I could be stuck with a couple bad eggs all night or I could keep rolling for new teammates every game and some of them be very fun to play with. I would rather take my chances.
---
This is indeed subjective. The best is determined by its competition. The context and competition is streamers, so any streamer you think is better than him will get your vote for the best.
---
I honestly just want them to do something to make Ruin less of a need on low mobility killers.
---
My guess is lag switch + killer's shit connection. Definitely not connection issues on my part.
---
People seem to be shocked that the Plague somehow missed you, but I'm shocked that you actually faced a Plague.
---
Trapper, Hag, Billy and Spirit should be higher
---
Ghostface, Pig, and Doctor should be lower
---
I beg to differ. You lose more time sitting in swf lobbies waiting for a match. Solo is much quicker for me.
---
I love farming it's free double pips and a shitload of bloodpoints because usually 5 bloody party streamers are used
---
If you consider the fact that 4 players are taken out of the daily pool of players per single killer you can see why the wait is long. Because four times more people are needed on one side plus people love to be killer.
---
I can see that for scratch marks, maybe, if the bloom was more, but for auras, that seems to be a non-issue. Any aura shown to you is literally asking to be seen.
---
If he has the tombstone addon, his tier 3 pose will have his hand open. Probably because he‚Äôs gonna grab you.

If they stop running right up into my face for some reason, I‚Äôll stop trying to hunt them down tbh

I don‚Äôt know if I got you in one game as well, but I was a Dwight against a Michael that let me escape while my teammates did almost the exact same thing here. I know that‚Äôs vague as heck and not much to go by, but I just wanted to thank you for being like this anyways and thank you to whomever that Michael was! ‚ù§Ô∏è

---
listen ik it's low quality but i didn't want the caption to almost be hidden
---
I guess it‚Äôs because of the new lobby system. That‚Äôs what I immediately think of at least. It‚Äôs funny. Remember that toxic person who replied to someone saying they were gonna buy DBD because of Stranger things saying the game didn‚Äôt need more new dumb trash ass players ruining it for the experienced ones or something like that? And then BHVR said that the different ranks would ‚Äúobviously prevent this.‚Äù
---
Granted at that point matchmaking was already having this issue, just not as bad as it is now. The update just made it worse. Meaning they did nothing to try and fix it, and ignored everyone reporting problems in the PTB. (Which they do every time anyways. They literally don‚Äôt even use the PTB properly.)
---
I was on first hook but In stage 2.  For my SWF teammate just yell ‚ÄúI AM THE DULL TOTEM KING‚Äù. Like.   Bruh.  Help maybe?
---
They can also brighten up Claudette's clothing while they are at it too.
---
In pc or ps4? Ps4 matchmaking is ok
---
I say Baby Billy because if I remember correctly He was a rank 19-20, and I sit around 7-8-9
---
Yea I know clown is good against loops but holy heck can he get genrushed as he has nothing else but chase potential which is why I put him in the front of low tier(previously a clown main) and for trapper and wraith I definitely say trappers better but they're kinda equal when you put spicy add-ons on wraith
---
Her lover is Phillip Ojomo, aka Wraithy boi
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have prestiged imo. I know it‚Äôs tempting for a reroll and you get a bloody cosmetic but all the perks you racked up that would have been out of the way are all back in the pot.
---
I like what they did with this map though, it encourages survivors to keep running rather than looping a single pallet location which I think is what they intended the game to be like in the first place
---
Was the game on the new Hawkins lab by any chance? That‚Äôs the only other Michael game I  played yesterday. I was trying to play immersive like in the movies by watching from far away and I didn‚Äôt hit anyone until the end of the game
---
If you want the watch pay 1 more euro for them.
---
I miss it
---
Like not doing about Claudette's dark clothing.
---
They're downvoting you because of the way you're addressing it.
---
The skill gap is there because it's significantly easier to be precise on PC (almost hilariously easier). If everyone has an easy time being precise, then you have to put in more work to be better.
---
The blanket statement "console players bad," while funny, is disingenuous at best. They simply don't have to develop the technical skills that PC players are almost required to have. Furthermore, they oftentimes can't, due to the limitations of a controller.
---
This is true in all games that require precision.
---
Keys are fair and balanced
---
Ok but what does that mean? More BP how?
---
I agree with everything here except for Demogorgon. Mid-high tier at the very least. Once the new pallet break buff comes he‚Äôs easily high tier.
---
Ps4  it takes like 3 to 7 minutes to matchmake is it supposed to take that long
---
LMAO. His moans are so feminine sounding.
---
Myers is High Tier, Billy is S Tier, Trapper is please buff tier, other than those its pretty accurate.
---
I pray that legion buff/rework will go as smoothly,as freddy's did
---
Oh, no. It was the farm (I don‚Äôt know the name). The one with an annoying amount of corn stalk obscuring vision. Lol!
---
Oh, well. Thank you anyways! :)
---
The point is pressure. This was a problem already before the update and it went ignored. Now it‚Äôs 100x worse and....still going ignored. They are sending instant automated messages to people reporting the issue. And instantly flipping all tickets for all matching making, loss of progress, and bug reports to ‚Äúresolved.‚Äù They never ask for further info, and it basically shows that they don‚Äôt even look at reports/tickets anymore. 
---
The more pressure applied to them about the issue, the more demand for them to resolve it. They won‚Äôt listen to reports/tickets. How else are we supposed to let them know?
---
Killer mains when rank reset drops
---
That‚Äôs so wholesome
---
A year ago take almost 20 minutes, now it's ok, not good, but acceptable
---
other survivor: *downed beneath a pallet, waiting for me to finish healing them up*
---
me, running over and planning on helping my pal: :)
---
me: *walks up to survivor, presses the healing button and for some fucking reason i just smash a perfectly good pallet right on her fucking head* 
---
downed survivor: &gt;:(
---
me: :(
---
Honestly same , i Lost my job , and my wife because of this bug, It broke the Game and my life
---
Better to apply more pressure by chasing the Nancy until he downs her; leaving the slugged one alone forces another survivor to get off gens to help (which would leave only one doing anything productive).
---
I don't think that any of the tips are supposed to say whether there is a perk that can do that or not. Like the tip that you can heal yourself with someone else or a medkit. It would be confusing to say "Oh, and there is a perk that can do that too"
---
Moris are fair and balanced
---
See? Works both ways.
---
What video was this called?
---
I just had a pretty amusing image of huntress opening a locker to get some hatchets,and bunch of medkits,maps,flashlights,and toolboxes come tumbling out around a shocked dwight.
---
Facts right here
---
rank has nothing to do with it, with how busted matchmaking currently is, honestly, almost every lobby for survive I see red, green, yellow, all kinds of ranks.  It makes no sense, but if they did fix matchmaking, it would help a lot.
---
I think it's really just the ridiculously impossible to balance nature of being an asymmetrical game and expanding in ways never intended, like ranged killers, for example.  you just kind of have to take the chaoticness of the game as a positive.
---
See I would say high mid tier but need I mention, his shred is easily denied in most maps and any decent survivor can dodge it making him a M1 killer in most situations, portals are very easily broken meaning more time you need to spend setting them back up and need I mention he can't remove them and for the pallet breaking buff it's slower then normally breaking a pallet meaning it'll only be good against people that drop pallets instantly . He's definitely good in alot of things but he also has alot of negatives and management he needs to do.
---
This is literally the exact same build I have on nancy down to the perk levels and order
---
I don't get it
---
every killer can be genrushed, it‚Äôs all about how well you can play/how much pressure you can put on. I mean, think about it. how easy is a nurse to beat if they can‚Äôt land their blinks?
---
Wait a minute how in the hell did you find proof of my existence?
---
As a killer, he could be a dick.
---
So am I, I use to main legion and they just massacred him with the nerf I just want legion to be a good killer(obviously I get why they nerfed him but they gutted him to trash tier)
---
I hope someone prestiges your spirit /s

Polite discussion from a self admitted newby? *DOWNVOTES!* Why, people?
---
At high ranks Billy‚Äôs chainsaw is only useful for map pressure and pallet breaks.
---
Why are you assuming they are ignoring it? It takes time to fix issues like this. On their Twitter, they have found the source of the issue and are working on fixing it.
---
He is called the shape in the movies too I think
---
well assuming they get a cut of the game's profits they must all live in mansions when theyre not being tortured in trials. the campfire is just in their shared frontyard that their butlers drive them to
---
Please buff?? Like bbq and chili isn‚Äôt enough gtfo
---
Yes but that map pressure is the best map pressure of all the killers.
---
Because that‚Äôs how these devs work. With literally every bug or issue on their game. It‚Äôs been this way for years.
---
They could fix that or they could fix the framerate. Seriously its like im playing doctor during the hallowed blight event
---
no i just dont think its a good idea
---
a killer could abuse it by just walking back and forth into a pallet to prevent it from being dropped, so now you'd need to add a minimum time between pallet-blocking-tokens, however now killers could just abuse this token system and save up 2 to instantly block a pallet, and then you'd have to make it so it can only be active in a chase but breaking chase is incredibly easy, making the perk useless, you could add a timer on how long you can keep the tokens, but if a survivor doesnt give you tokens it'll never matter if they wait out the 5 seconds or whatever, so basically the perk would be either incredibly op or useless, i dont know
---
True but clown has exceptionally bad presence in maps as he is just good at chases and nothing else, he can go to the other ends of the map fast, no slow down just the bottles, I just think he's kinda bad in most scenarios besides chases and catching up
---
**laughs in spine chill**
---
Good point. Fully on your side now
---
The Shape is actually his OG nickname from the first movie. That‚Äôs what Laurie would refer to him as before she knew who he is.
---
Break the game lol
---
terror radius goes through floors
---
so on maps like Gideon with multiple floors throughout the whole map doctor is an absolute pain in the ass to deal with
---
They don't know my Username or what device I'm using
---
Ngl,susie lookin' thick as a brick

Or the hit boxes break again and it insta-downs them with a headshot.
---
Thanks!
---
Sir we're talking about their abilities and how useful they are not perks, that's a completely different subject bubba has to be one of the worst killers in the game
---
rank 14 against rank 7 ? man you got very good matchmaking 
---
most of the time i get 10+ ranks difference
---
they're rare af and can only be used conditionally if you happen upon it, so yeah they actually are
---
I don't think the crawling chick had enough time to escape so he was laughing

The offerings you burn to get more BP? They multiply the amount you earned in the match. Escape cake for instance gives you double what you earned; you earn 10k BP in the match, it gives you +10k BP.

The blood hunt is exactly like that, it just doubles all points earned, every match, no need to burn an offering. .

Umm, it has many unsafe pallets

Love this!

get rekt ghostface.

Say hello to Bubba‚Äôs Basement sometime, or someone whose just good with him in general. He has a high skill cap easy killers get glossed over because they don‚Äôt get tried enough beyond beginners and then they move on. You may say he‚Äôs a one trick pony but his tantrum can be used to great effect making an entire team go down.
---
I never said Moris are balanced either. I play killer and survivor. I think they‚Äôre both pretty shitty but they won‚Äôt be removed.

Man that pallet perk is busted, basically just a solution to all those rank 20s who say they should remove looping from dbd

same. I have scoops ahoy and get moried CONSTANTLY.

Yea he can but how often do you get survivors so grouped up without camping to down multiple of them? Barely ever, he is definitely only good with camping that's all he's good at, his chainsaw slows him down too much in a Chase making it useless,tantrum slows you down alot meaning you could waste even more time if you use it in a Chase etc etc as a previous leatherface main he is just a camping killer that's it
---
this is why bill is such a badass
---
Yeah I was still tunneling the unhooked sure while I chased another guy around for a while, happened to meet the unhooked one, slapped both of them and tried to hook both as well. 
---
The argument that the killer had to tunnel if DS was activated is seriously just bull. It helps against tunneling, yes, but that's not all it does.
---
Or you know, you can literally farm them with the right perks. You can even get like 4 in a single trial

Bloodpoints baby

The Entity clearly took this moment while he was getting dressed for work, before he put his watch on. That's the only logical explanation.
---
From the recent [FAQ](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87884/q-a-stranger-things-and-3-2-0/p1):
---
"Q: Where did the pre-lobby chat and switch roles button go? Are they coming back?
---
With the 3.2.0 update, the lobby flow has changed, allowing us to automatically regroup survivors after a match and seamlessly go from playing solo to playing with friends. As a side effect, the switch roles button that would previously appear when playing alone and the pre-lobby chat that would appear in SWF no longer exist. These components would need to be updated to work with the new lobby system (e.g. Prevent someone from switching roles when playing with another person).
---
The pre-lobby chat should be returning soon. We recognize that it is an important detail when playing with friends without voice chat. The switch roles button may return down the line, but we can't guarantee that it will be returning just yet."

This is such a great mental image XD
---
Same with insta heals, they should go away
---
His shred is situationally good and bad depending on certain tiles. But shred is at it‚Äôs best for closing distances between loops. It seems minor but shutting down survivors who try to reach loops that are even slightly far away is a guaranteed hit which can save you tons of time. Very similar to Huntress in that regard. 
---
However, the portals are where things get tricky. Much like Hag, I feel it‚Äôll take a while for people to find good positioning and tactics for portals. But for now, using The Abyss‚Äôs killer instinct to know where survivors are and to see if they‚Äôre messing with your portals is super useful and under utilized by most demo players. Also since his recovery is almost non existent, his map pressure is great and the undetectable effect after TP‚Äôing is poweful for getting first hit advantage.
---
There should be different random objectives for the generators. For example this generator, you need to find a missing part that is within 32 metres of the gen. This one is badly damaged and will regress slowly when not being worked on when under 50% repair.
---
I would also remove keys and green and red moris
---
Thank you kind sir for en lighting that man.
---
You do realise they're getting a demo for a killer they already own, right?
---
I understand when I originally posted this I was fresh off of salt from it happening to me. It wouldn‚Äôt make me as annoyed if I could just get into a new game within 5 minutes, but nope gotta ain‚Äôt there for like ten waiting for a new match.
---
Yeah. That's why lag switching can be done. Good thing is i was recording since the 1st two downs seemed real fishy (two people going down almost instantly &amp; at the same time).

You're both right!

What movie/show is this? Such a pretty art style.
---
I mean, killer can dodge my swf if they want. We fuck around and all run no mither or give ourself challenges. If we can tell it's a new killer we'll sacrafice ourselves or give free hits. We try to stay in red rank to get killers we don't unintentionally bully, but match making is broken (getting rank 20 killer with 3 rank 2 survivors like???). All of us have too many hours to care about living, we are just trying to have fun. :)
---
I agree with this! I mean, it sucks for balancing at red ranks, I think, because I hear complaints about that all the time. But the vast majority of players I feel are in green-brown ranks. Making the game more balanced at higher tiers of play would be massively imbalancing the game at the other end in the killer's favor.
---
Unless they balanced the game separately per tier, making gens harder for red rank games only. But then everyone would derank on purpose, because they shouldn't be punished for being good. It's like blue shells in mario kart. It wouldn't be good for anybody. I just have no idea what could be different
---
Or you could run Dead Hard without No Mither and go down in three hits?
---
That‚Äôs interesting. I feel like I should have known this by now considering I‚Äôve been playing for months. Learn something new everyday haha.
---
I am a man of good honors, I let go the scoops ahoy steves and Adams wearing very rare clothes
---
Bout to get that Joe cosmetic now thx

yeah its less convenient. they got rid of it cuz of the more involved survivor side with the friends list and the way swf works now. but they could still include the option

thats ur list, mine is what u see

Some red rank console nurses are actually fucking scary. Especially since so few people play nurse, its hard to get practice against her

Oh no I was about to show my rank 20 friend the ropes

We‚Äôve all teabagged at least once as ghost face lol, that guy was kinda obnoxious tho because of how long he did it.

I mean at least he sacrificed one of you and tried to sacrifice you. It's not like he slugged you all then didn't do anything.
---
Sucks that this bug still exists, everyone made it out except Nea, or maybe she really is a killer after all?
---
His dream snares are actually better than fake pallets against good survivors.
---
Very much so. But everyone got mad when I said Killers shouldn't share ranks 1=1, like a Rank 1 Nurse player won't get slaughtered as Cannibal up there.
---
Is noob3 actually toxic? I recently started watching him and he plays pretty normally. Nothing like the teabagging Neas I always see

Spine Chill is a drug honestly

Perk draft mode where you all queue up with random perks for a specified BP boost could be cool.

Healing at the hook is definitely a risk/reward scenario; as killer though, if I *personally* am in this situation, I‚Äôll down the injured and slug them, then chase the rescuer‚ÄîMUCH better pressure on survivors.

It's hard to get pressure rolling on a good team though.

and you can also get zero or a broken one ten games in a row even with the right perks but ok let's defer to rng
---
Nope.
---
Just gotta hate on new players, I guess.
---
Can someone explain why fixated would benefit you as a survivor?
---
That means nothing unless we know what number he started at, starts at 10 then it's a quick totem but starts at 500 not so quick.
---
Guys the downvotes aren't necessary, I can see how you'd think that's a concern
---
Me and my friend play duo queue, but we aren't too try-hard. Most of our communication is us complaining about our teammates being clowns because they're sitting in a corner the entire game, or just being overall useless.
---
I'm rank 11 now thanks to this. I'm a rank 16 all day long but I keep getting paired up with 1-4 survs and we go against a 12-18 killer
---
It depends on the map. The Game and Lery‚Äôs should be a guaranteed 3k with SM Meyers
---
Ok.
---
BEST MEME EVER
---
Its awful right now. I was trying to figure out why I killed all 4 survivors 5 minutes into the game last night:
---
[](https://imgur.com/eFp432e)
---
They could just play more survivor :P, except that sucks and doesn't pay nearly as much BP for the difficulty.
---
i just got ghostface to 2nd prestige and got bbq at level 5 lol luck was on my side this time
---
This is scary
---
Exactly. Some straight bs.
---
That‚Äôs false. Wraith is of African descent and the Doctor is African American.
---
I guess Hag and Wraith are African but like you can't even tell right?
---
Xbox people are really toxic af from dbd
---
I want fucking Bamboozled on my Demogorgon but the game won't fucking give it to me
---
Survivor: I am gonna loop ya!
---
Spirit Mains: ***WAAAAAAANNNGH***
---
If hes weaker than billy spirit nurse hes not op. 
---
Theres hag, huntress, meyers in the next teir.  Do u really think hes better than them vs red swf?
---
myers my friend
---
Wow! That IS relatable!
---
No I loveeeee Halloween. Michael is a very interesting killer. Even the most recent movie was really good! Some other movies of course not so much. I‚Äôm excited for October to come around because that means Halloween will probably be playing on every other channel!
---
Tantrum stops you even moving it‚Äôs definitely more for hooks but you don‚Äôt have to camp. Just bait and then as your chainsaw runs out walk into the hooks pole and they won‚Äôt expect it and boom if they‚Äôre not coordinating you just got two people down and possibly the hooked person if they were saved.
---
For chases you can use the chainsaw but not as much as M1 just like any other attack you can‚Äôt constantly use Shred to good effect.
---
Anyway he‚Äôs shit for most but for me personally he‚Äôs mid tier. Billy is low tier for me but that‚Äôs because high skilled survivors destroy him.
---
She can still go in with the key . You have to close the hatch
---
You didnt know that existed?
---
This is big brain trapper gameplay
---
Wraith and doctor are black tho
---
If I see an ahoy steve, the hatch is his
---
You don‚Äôt make killers DC 33% of the time unless you‚Äôre playing brittle bone baby killers like yourself who cry when they get stunned twice or lose a single hook to a well timed body block. My group has been all red rank since we got the game this spring and we still get stomped some times. You are a massive crybaby and exaggerate like a child which massively undermines your arguments.
---
Don't forget z-wall traps. Gotta stop the infinite
---
No I want healthy movement and sounds an anime teehee when she murders the shit out of me!
---
Thanks for this! I played survivor and had a couple of games just stop like the killer dc'd and was wondering if this was the reason (probably was).
---

Just got the spirit and was given BBQ on my level one blood web
---
ignore these people and search on YouTube for some beginner guides. This game is very hard for beginners. Maybe you should look at the pinned post in this subreddit
---
what? that if i hold left click my killer will spam attack?
---
Pretty good JAHB so far.
---
yesss. I think i watched the original one more than 15 times last October because I was so hyped for the 2018 release. I saw that one twice, once around release date and once on Halloween. I hope these next 2 releases are good.
---
I think i'll do that, thank you!

Candyman would be a perfect fit.
---
So you have a problem with how each survivor only appears differently but plays the same, and you solution is to modify their animations? Isn't that just more of the same? How does this address the problem you outlined? 
---
While I do like your idea of additional customization options, I don't think this does anything to make survivors "unique", as they would still play the same, just look different. No change from what they are now. And let's be real, if they're going to go through the effort of creating a whole new set of animations, they're going to sell them to every survivor: People would Riot otherwise. And then we'd be back at square 1. That's how I see it, at least.
---
Trap a locker that a decisive strike gamer is hiding in. It's fucking hilarious
---
Billy is S tier.....bwaahahahahahahaha
---
A nice ghost face?
---
Shook.
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight fun isn't an option it's blood or GTFO.
---
Dude those perks sounds pretty good
---
Yeah. I feel that way too. I would've been like "oh okay that's cool" if they had only decided to do ONE more film after this last one, because we were left on that massive cliffhanger. But 2? Yikes. I would hope that H: Kills is going to be decent, but the one after might not be the case, just because they'll have to drag it out for yet another film. 
---
It's all probably just a money grab at this point. Don't get me wrong, I love the franchise and the characters, but I feel like it should stop. Same thing happened with Friday the 13th. I stopped watching those after the 6th film. 
---
Myers "died" (with huge emphasis on the die part) in 1, 2, 4, The Curse of MM, Resurrection, Both RZ remakes, and the 2018 film. So basically like most of the franchise. Myers doesn't really ***die*****. x-x**
---
It's what you get for taunting the killer.
---
Toxic Karma
---
No killer is toxic, but shes probably the most "unfair"
---
*Happy Mikey Noises*
---
Imagine not running BL
---
NOED stands alone in no skilled bullshit.  You including Pop and Ruin is just absolutely silly.  I see the shitpost flair so I'm going to assume you're just messing around and aren't actually a babysurvivor that believes that stuff.
---
They need to remove the struggle mechanic
---
Then adrenaline pops
---
Lucky for you that you at least got 1. We tried for 2 hours before giving up. I just wanted to test Demogorgon on the new map. :(
---
It's oversaturated. They are not being upvoted, they are being reported every time and clogging up the subreddit.
---
i'm part of the both categories
---
Alabama 100
---
This is like people asking for a pizza to be delivered to their house and then shooting the delivery guy. This community wants more players, and then does stuff to  and push them away
---
Nah... I treat newbies with respect when I'm killer to help them improve. And treat baby killer nice well when I'm surviving. But you have to put in time and get better. Watch Monto and improve.
---
The David perk you‚Äôre thinking of is actually ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever,‚Äù but you‚Äôre explanation is solid besides that.
---
4 players still have to repair 5 generators.
---
Moris can skip an entire hook phase for every survivor. They're all down 1 life.
---
Keys are also consumed on use or lost on death, Yes there is some rare addons but moris have multiple tiers, including non-rare ones.
---
I don‚Äôt use whispers or spirit fury either and I only use ruin when I wanna slow gens down just a little bit
---
Uhg I hate that. Because literally in the last movie, you‚Äôd think that was it. Spoiler alert: he burns to ‚Äúdeath‚Äù in a trapped basement. How do you get out of that? You don‚Äôt! Definitely a money grab at this point but they‚Äôre just gonna dig themselves a ditch if they keep doing it. Or not considering people will still continue to watch it despite how bad they get.
---
What's wrong with the new Badham maps?
---
lol he should have not been greedy
---
Time to dc each time survivors use BP offerings
---
That's a common definition of tunneler. Specifically, if the person you're chasing has been evading you for several minutes and you still can't catch them (especially if some other survivor presents themselves as a target).
---
Another would be if you make it back to the hook while they're healing under it, and chase the guy that was just on the hook instead of the guy that rescued. (Some people would say if you chase a guy to hook and he unhooks in front of you, hitting the unhooked guy is tunneling, but I call that deserved punishment for being a dummy.)
---
Sometimes you're just on the same wavelength as a particular survivor, and keep running into them all game, or they run straight to you after they get rescued from hook. Some survivors will get really angry about the coincidence and say you're tunneling.
---
That‚Äôs cruel to your team. You‚Äôre worse than a toxic build at that point.
---
How is this an unpopular opinion
---
I don‚Äôt really want to make an entire post so I hope someone will comment:
---
I want to buy the new chapter pretty badly but is the Demogordon going to be nerfed to shit like every other killer is or is he lookin safe?
---
[deleted]
---
I‚Äôd let her mori my ghost face
---
Yeah I get that. It‚Äôs definitely repetitive, but I think when you mess with builds and perks it‚Äôs fun. SWF have fun bullying the killer, the killer has fun mori‚Äông claudettes. We all have fun here.
---
to be fair he could have easily hooked them and made it back to hatch easy as it takes forever for you to fully die
---
No not at all he‚Äôs not even close
---
Not really taunting considering he was guaranteed the kill and i got glitched before doing "said taunting" so no karma needed here
---
Yeah. I don't expect all games to have farmers and that's fine...
---
..its the noticeable increase in Mori's and  red add-ons we see during these times I don't like.
---
You're right. Good point lol
---
But you get double points for kills during EGC (which closing the hatch activates), so he probably wanted that too.
---
Devs have acknowledged how bad the matchmaking has been
---
I love the concept of Don't Stop Me Now, but it needs to have at least a 2-3 second cooldown to avoid exploiting it.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me 8 times on ps4 I‚Äôve reported it every time but fuck me you know
---
The awful ranking system made me go against a ‚ÄúRank 17 spirit‚Äù with BBQ 3, Ruin 3, NOED3 and Nurses 3. Then they mysteriously DCed at the end of the game.
---
Same. I'll probably watch these next two, but it really depends on the one they're working on now. After they trapped Michael in the basement, I thought "oh well that's it, there is literally zero way to get out." but then it shows that he just disappeared. I left thinking "???????" so I mean, we'll have to wait and see. I wish everything wasn't a money grab.
---
\*Rage against the ~~Machine~~ Entity intensifies\*
---
I wish survs could mori claudettes.
---
Hide chat or ignore messages and just focus on learning. Not only is being a new player tough but right now matchmaking is broken worse than usual and they are working on a hot fix.

---
Hey, know what would stop SWF dodging... balancing the fucking game around it.. instead of forcing killers to play the game within the bounds of how it was originally designed while survivors get to play the game outside of those rules.
---
I also suggest playing killer a bit because it teaches you a lot about how NOT to be a good survivor. The point of view is different and it will teach you about the killer‚Äôs abilities, their attack distance etc.
---
bro same my tag is EaterOfTacos123
---
There's nothing wrong with any killer using ruin or pop.  Pop in particular is earned each and every time it's applied and requires good play and strong gen pressure to make proper use of.
---
agree
---
A lot of killers are actually being forcibly disconnected to a bug with Dying Light apparently. Also there a people being disconnected on the new map as well.
---
I would love to see some more original killers. We have a lot of fun licensed killer, let‚Äôs see some new people that no one has heard of. I‚Äôve seen a lot of good ideas on here and the dbdkiller sun reddit of some original killer ideas.
---
As far as I know he's going to come with the Oblivious status in a later update so I'm both scared shitless as a survivor but overjoyed as a Ghostface main
---
It was a suggestion...
---
Honestly, I was just as happy to get level 3 Insidious off my Wraith bloodweb as I was for level 1 Ruin. Feels good to finally know you've checked off a useless one.
---
Stop with this goddamn meme
---
I love Fixated so much. Seriously, I might just like it more than Inner Strength just for the amount of times I've escaped chases with it.
---
They're way too coordinated, might as well just give up now.
---
I once was up against a team that all readied at exactly the same time, and then proceeded to absolutely destroy me.
---
It‚Äôs not outdated, the tips reflect the base game with no offerings, addons, or perks.
---
Hey we exist don't erase us
---
*switches to Spirit*
---
He couldn‚Äôt escape. His game was bugged lol. Nice assumption though buddy.
---
I love it too. But what if... **we could love it even more!?**
---
Next time drop off the ledge and try and go for the hatch escape.
---
!remindme
---
You mean...

***ICE COLD***
---
Spirit high tier? Lmfao
---
Scoring is based on a 5 category system. You can get a maximum of 5 points per category. The categories were Chase, Pressure, Lethality, Stealth and Detection. 
---
Chase means how effective they are in a chase, Pressure means how effective they are at moving across the map, Lethality means how quickly they can down a survivor, Stealth means how effective they are at staying undetected, Detections means how effective they are at finding survivors. 
---
Some categories such as Chase and Pressure are more important than categories like Stealth. Chase and Pressure were given a x2 multiplier, so if Ghostface for example got a 3 in chase, the multiplier would make it a 6. Detection would get a x0.5 multiplier because it is not *as* important. Doctor could get a 4 in detection, but the multiplier would turn it into a 2. This was done so that someone like Legion couldn‚Äôt outclass someone like Spirit simply because he can find people better than she can. 
---
My friend and I gave each killer a score and we found the average between us, creating the final score you see in the chart. This was all based on opinion so if you disagree then just understand this isn‚Äôt based on any actual scientific facts.
---
You write it like that as if it's obvious lmao wtf
---
Best perk on demogorgon is discordinence

Nice on getting p3 already. I‚Äôm currently prestige 1 level 36 on Nancy
---
Ok this ones quite good.
---
Replace Whispers with Corrupt and Add discordinence
---
Lmao are you really pretending that people escape via hatch opening that often?
---
Sometimes I can't see survivor auras with BBQ so I'd love to change the color of gen auras to something like blue or purple
---
I like devour hope but when a 4 man group shows up its as good as cleansed
---
xD sorry
---
For real though, Inner Strength and Fixated reaƒ∫ly have the possibility to be meta, but they just need a little push to become really great.
---
Ok now that‚Äôs my nightmare. It‚Äôs bad enough when they block hooks.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, figured the suggestion flair would be noticeable
---
Had to do this against some Claudettes. let's just say I got some salt.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted this to happen
---
You obviously don't remember the scratch marks from a year ago, my friend
---
all the better my man
---
Congrats
---
I'd consider myself still a new player, I generally only play once or twice a week for a couple of games.
---
Inner Strength isn‚Äôt meta tier yet, but even then I feel second wind needs the push more. Inner Strength is legitimately the tier right below meta, whilst fixated is somewhere in low-mid.
---
Yeah! I'm going to post my steam profile here later when I have time
---
They're too busy ignoring their brand new rank 20 killers getting curbstomped by red ranks to ignore anything else.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Billy is good but not S rank good. A really good team or player can loop him for ages.
---
I'll try and do that
---
Whoosh
---
I don't know what else to tell ya. Either he was just rude or a survivor provoked him. Simple as that.
---
I see, I'll surely try someday
---
He needs to have a short speed slowdown while placing his snares
---
You're right. It's just a game. I'm sorry. My opinion of your killer of choice doesn't give me the right to judge you without knowing who you are. Sometimes this game brings out the jerk in me.
---
But will it actually be easier to see than the brightly glowing vibrant red my monitor puts out? I don't think it will be - but luckily there's a really simple answer to that concern: limit the color choices to complementary colors for the 3 color blindnesses only.
---
Protanomaly - reduced sensitivity to red light. Complementary color green not neon so we're good there.
---
Deuteranomaly - reduced sensitivity to green light. Complementary color magenta. A little bright but no brighter than the vibrant reds non-color blind users see.
---
Tritanomaly - reduced sensitivity to blue light and is extremely rare. Complementary color orange.
---
Those 3 colors would add a ton of accessibility alone without providing any real benefit.
---
+1
---
See now it's people like you who are the reason I always ask if a killer was provoked
---
Cuz in the show, Steve says ‚Äúfinger licking good‚Äù, and the clowns mori is him licking the survivor‚Äôs finger
---
I wish more people played sabo squads. It means less survivors working on generators.
---
new objectives other than gens but honestly i really would rather they spent time cleaning up their code because boy howdy is the game a glitchfest. that hinders the game more for me then any mechanic.
---
Mine is NaamahXx
---
That Jane is doing gods work
---
I'm playing devil's advocate here. Just jumping onto the "this one clip means he was being toxic no questions asked" is just dumb. I like to know all the facts first before coming to a conclusion. Crazy I know.
---
One step forward and two steps backward
---
A good bing bong
---
Susie looking like a snaccc
---
Don‚Äôt worry about their comments; this game is notorious for being toxic and salty. Learn about your own pace and don‚Äôt feel bad.
---
If they do this to Pig I'm gonna ebony mori myself
---
Nurse is probably the most unique killer in the game mechanic wise (the only one actually slower than survivors) yet you put her below huntress.
---
why do people even being colourblind? /s
---
Oh no, you‚Äôre have a perfectly reasonable point, and in that case I‚Äôd agree. However, if you look at the guy‚Äôs first comment, he immediately stated as if a matter of fact, that the Nea absolutely had to of done something to deserve this.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed moba and br being the most toxic games. I like them because I‚Äôm competitive  and it really scratches that itch, but I think a lot of people are just really tied up in the game. Like you said they act like the game represents their worth. 
---
And that‚Äôs chill. My last swf was like that. It was just with one friend and we were shootin the shit just like that. For a couple hours. I‚Äôve left the game and came back myself. I don‚Äôt play nearly as much now but the first year I played was just nonstop.
---
The smile suppresses the rage of being constantly bullied
---
Im just wondering why is every clip in this subreddit from console players? And this clip is just a survivor getting demolished then using a ds. Nothing special about this.
---
he has a skeleton key it can open closed hatches and has a perk called adrenaline where when that orange bar comes he gains one health state and a bit of speed (I think)
---
You're not adding in the Perks. True Each Offering adds 100%  more BP to your earnings, but so do the Perks WGLF/BBQ&amp;C.
---
So with 1 BPS, and 1 of those Perks, you get 200% more BP added to the points you earned:
---
20k + 20K (Perk) + 20k (BPS) = 60k (200%)
---
That's an example of what we can earn right now without the Bloodhunt event. With the event added in you get:
---
20k + 20k (Perk) + 20k (Event) + 20k (1 BPS) = 80k (300%)
---
That's just from 1 person using BPS and a WGLF/BBQ. However, People often save the BPS/Gateau's for this event, so the possibility of more than 1 person using them is higher, and what we get is:
---
20k + 20k (Perk) + 20k (Event) + 40k (2 BPS) = 100k (400%)
---
20k + 20k (Perk) + 20k (Event) + 60k (3 BPS) = 120k (500%)
---
20k + 20k (Perk) + 20k (Event) + 80k (4 BPS) = 140k  (600%)
---
20k + 20k (Perk) + 20k (Event) + 100k (5 BPS) = 160k (700%)
---
That's a Significant difference in BP. Even still, if only 1 person is using the BPS during the event, they are still getting 100% more BP for everyone than the event alone, which is a far more efficient usage of them and play time if you are out to earn BP. So yes, it does matter if you use them today vs. saving them for the event.
---
I am sure he would say "That Bitch..."
---
It's illegal for a movie theater to not have captions available in some form actually. Hell- it's illegal for live theatre to not have it. and companies are getting sued!
---
Best ranks to be in are between like 8-10ish and 14ish. The most fun i have anyway
---
Well thing about the portals they make slight noises and show their aura when a survivor  is cleansing them meaning they can all see then destroy it fast, you can use your of the abyss to see survivors near them giving you a headstart on them, for the shred it has a charge time which is starting it then 1 or 2 seconds you get the maximum lunge distance,
---
Instaheals are different imo, they don't completely change a mechanic of the game.
---
I always just give my flashlights and maps to other survivors unless it's like a rainbow map because I never use them
---
&gt; I dont understand the problem here
---
because the game isn't balanced around any of that shit, champ. The game is balanced around 4 random people being matched up with no ability to communicate or coordinate during the game. 
---
The killer is forced to play within those rules, while Survivors get all the advantages of playing outside of those rules.
---
No
---
Really? Only time I can‚Äôt hit it the ready button or unready is at the :15 second marker to keep people locked in and also so they aren‚Äôt changing cosmetics or items at the last second.
---
Funny you say that, steam didn‚Äôt even notify me this time around but luckily I picked it all up when I purchased the stranger things chapter.
---
Bruh what? Maybe you have your monitor too high?
---
Nah
---
Oh are you saying it's illegal for every movie theater in the world to not have CC?
---
It's pretty obvious when someone is new. They try to hide when it's obvious you've seen them, they don't home in on loops, they throw down pallets without looking behind themselves and instantly keep on running and you hear booms go off if you use ruin
---
Whenever I run into them, I tend to fuck around a lot more in the game because it just turns into a snowball really fast otherwise
---
Why are you breaking pallets at Hawkins Lab?
---
Devs did that so people couldn‚Äôt drop out, change survivors or cosmetics or drop that master toolbox or key at the last second...
---
Yeah you could build a cheaper PC and run those games just fine. You don't have to break the bank like most people think. And the great thing about it is unlike buying a console you'll also get a desktop PC for other stuff than just playing games. Best of luck.
---
I hate they they report me for having bad wifi
---
You need some game knowledge and familiarity with game sounds/ general map layout
---
I played a bunch of survivor and easier killers before her- got molly whopped playing her so i stopped and played her again after i was more used to the game
---
&gt;buy a product that's unsuitable for them
---
dude it's not like a paraplegic buying a skateboard lmao, it's a videogame, a form of entertainment, and it can't be enjoyed properly by those who lost the genetic lottery. the fact that basic usability and comfort features are being ignored this far after release is kind of ridiculous, it's not like people are asking for a complete lighting overhaul or that we add noise direction indicators for the deaf or something that can be abuse, just that we can change aura colors which they can already do given the various aura color changing perks like surveillance and the light blue of the Summer BBQ hooks.
---
not at all, being so slow, having to aim and the survivors having counterplays (dont forget the bad map designs) makes the huntres soo hard, nurse is so op that she becames so easy, huntress is balanced and trust me, mastering a huntress is way harder than mastering nurse
---
Epic
---
Looks like she just fucking did some super hero looking ass landing from the sky.
---
That's a cool benefit to running make your choice. If they save and activate it you have an in-game timer that counts exactly 60 for you from the moment they are unhooked.
---
Pretty much my only complaint about this art to be honest.  I'm digging the energy they managed to put in the poses though.  I just got Legion and a bunch of the other killers due to the Steam sale and I've been having a blast with the stab gang (though goddamn BBQ just won't show its face).
---
Thank you
---
If you put barbecue and chili on or the David King equivalent on of we're gonna live forever, double those numbers, that's why blood hunts are so well received but also with a lacking of higher bp multipliers after playing for extended periods of time without these events the bp/game would become mundane due to its simple repetitively predictable score nature.
---
So, no, those numbers are wrong. It would be, with the perks on:
---
(Starting with a base of 40k from bbq&amp;c/wglf)
---
(This is why these perks are sought after so much, and because of bbq&amp;c's aura ability, no survivor ability)
---
1 BPS - 80k (potentially if merciless or survived)
---
2 BPS - 120k
---
3 BPS - 160k
---
4 BPS - 200k
---
And that's if we're considering only at 20k base and not a perfect 32k, so as the math would follow
---
64k (with bbq&amp;c/wglf)
---
1 BPS - 128k
---
2 BPS - 192k
---
3 BPS - 256k
---
4 BPS - 320k
---
5 BPS (killer BPS) - 384k. In one game. The rarest of all possible scores. So it's a pretty big deal.
---
‚ÄúBeing so slow‚Äù
---
I just played a game as spirit where I curbstomped a bunch of rank 18‚Äôs, I felt bad for the last guy so I tried to give him hatch and I spent about 5 minutes trying to make him follow me, and another 5 trying to down and carry him to the hatch but he kept wiggling even though it‚Äôs clear I wasn‚Äôt trying to hook him
---
The majority of games I've played, the killer usually gets taunted by someone at somepoint. I'm just going off personal experience
---
I literally see no downside to this
---
LOL
---
So basically don‚Äôt play super sweaty? I‚Äôll play new killers and not just be a total try hard, and hopefully I‚Äôll be matched against survivors who do the same.
---
You do realize videogames are...different, right? I don't want to play fuckin Overwatch, I want to play Dead by Daylight. It's not like there aren't band-aid fixes like ReShade or NVidia Game Filter, it's the fact that you even HAVE to go outside of the game and apply a filter or a third party program just to enable settings like these that's the issue. It's not like taking a day or two to code in an Aura/Scratch Color Picker is going to suddenly delay a Bubba rework by 6 weeks.
---
I support the idea but I ‚Äòm a little septic about if it can be implemented... until this day we still don‚Äôt have a screen resolution option in this game and that is the basic option in a game
---
You hit the first guy, hit and chase the 2nd, keep herding them so they're in an area of the map you find you like while split off gens get finished
---
Gens being done early is not the worst thing in the world, as long as they're not in the center of the map
---
You gotta keep in mind how the survivors are reacting to your terror radius (bad ones hide/ run away and basically "turn off" doing gens if you walk around a bit) and making sure your first chase is a productive one (forcing a pallet near center of map down/ getting a good pallet out of the way early)
---
You gotta give everyone a little bit of attention. Scary survivors will take a hit, notice you aggro'ing on someone else, and hop to doing the gen 10m away injured and not worrying about a heal as their exhaustion remains/ comes back. That shit is nightmare fuel.
---
And they probably hate that you play Killer with bad wifi which makes their games horrendous.
---
Don't play killer if you have a shit wifi, the host of a game has an obligation not to use dial up
---
If you look at the right side of the screen above, next to the 3D model of Michael Myers, it says "The Shape".
---
She's pretty damn good.
---
So healing and bodyblocking are tactics exclusive to SWF groups only? Bringing flashlights is something only a SWF group can do? 
---
The game was balanced at the start without SWF in mind. But you‚Äôre just being ignorant if you dont think BHVR balances with SWF in mind now.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to defend SWF. What I disagree with is the assumption that these are tactics ONLY swf groups can do. If survivors are coordinated in the slightest, they must be a SWF! its obnoxious
---
Did you use a Mori?
---
No mori sir!
---
ay b0ss can I get a... hamburger pls
---
Holy shit I‚Äôm not colorblind but this should really happen. I know some cods have it for the mini map which is nice.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d71ewm/so_my_game_glitched_and_now_im_level_31057/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
IRC that software has to be supported by the game, or at least allowed.  DBD doesn't seem to allow it.  AltF3 should enable it/use it though if you can get it to work but I've never had luck in DBD in particular.
---
Read the title again.
---
If you got all iridescent with only his perks equipped you should have got the trophy
---
First time I've seen someone suggest Candyman
---
Well i did not an now i am sad :( .
---
Definitely! While I don't think Demo is necessarily "hard" to escape from, I totally enjoy playing against it. Very tense matches indeed.
---
I see a lot of people like the Welcome Home Perk, and I want to, but there are several things I need answers to before I can. What purpose does it serve for other killers? Is a survivor able to enter the locker? And if so, is it closed, maybe with a notification, or is it left open? The power you set says the killer can jump to any highlighted locker, but if it‚Äôs highlighted by Welcome Home, is it immediately closed, does the Boogie Man get out, or does he just stand there awkwardly? In other things, I fell the perk might need to be increased to 48 locker aura and maybe 12 survivor aura, and maybe the pallet perk should instead be for breaking pallets already dropped. This idea does have promise, though.
---
You can confuse the killer by knowing where to run around to make him lose you
---
I've been using them since I started playing basically and realized I couldn't actually see the auras properly, but it's a full-screen filter that makes all the other elements look discolored so it's not really a proper fix, but it'll have to do for now.
---
Just got bugged sadly. You will have to try again is the only solution.
---
Is it still worth bying?
---
You can also remove portals so if you've got time to do that first you can lower the chances of being caught unhooking.
---
I hate killers with bad connection. It's literally the opposite of fun.
---
Widely considered by top players to be the second best killer in the game.
---
Spirit is second only to Nurse because of how many loops she makes unsafe. Every time she stops moving, you toss a coin. Unless you're injured and don't have iron will, then it's less a coin toss and more of a "hope they fuck up"
---
I dunno how it works at rank 15-20, but high levels spirits are scary.
---
My internet cut out earlier mid match and someone (probably the killer) messaged me calling me a DC‚Äôing piece of shit lol
---
Keys are definitely broken.
---
This man's here playing 4D Chess with them next level plays.
---
I think part of the problem could be a lot of traffic in the servers after the stranger things chapter.
---
Bringing back smol billy
---
I think so too, hopefully they fix it soon.
---
just dont play the game if you're color blind
---
I literally got on and had bad wifi
---
If you're truly utilitarian you must really hate the cosmetic store and mobile ports, huh?
---
Why wifi is supposed to be good, idk what happened to it
---
These comments are meh, dude yes bad Wi-Fi as killer is bad mkay, but also no, people shouldn't be asses and report you for it.
---
my last brain cell
---
How is my math wrong?
---
All you did was add extra BP for WGLF. My numbers weren't implying that they were the most amount of BP you could possibly get. I was simply using a random amount as an example to show that BPS are additive, not multiplicative.
---
I googled the software and it's a part of GeForce Experience.
---
Filters work in DBD
---
https://i.imgur.com/1BezImw.jpg
---
Exactly
---
Yeah but they dont need to report me for lag switching
---
where‚Äôs the porn tho
---
Oh damn
---
"Hey guys, we just got a massive IP release and free weekend scheduled. This sure to bring in new players! What should we do?"
---
"Reset everyone's rank."
---
"Won't that make the game really frustrating for killers and boring for survivors?"
---
"I THINK WE'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR "
---
They do though.
---
Oh thank god it actually works, for whatever reasons filters don't like to work in mine.  
---
MAYBE because I always try it in game instead of in lobby.
---
Did you just say frick in my Christian Minecraft server?
---
As a colorblind person, thank you for doing gods work!
---
This is a bug and they've already made a statement that they're aware of it and fixing it.
---
The way the Meg is looking at Jane probably sums up how the streamers reacted as well.
---
nah it‚Äôs just been bad matchmaking on the devs part, more like green rank killers when I‚Äôm at red ranks :/
---
It's perfect
---
Hag and Freddy should be higher
---
I can already see the Sweaty TTV's abusing the shit out of this even tho it's not meant for them.
---
Don't expect people to fix your problems when they have better things to do with their time. Also if you've already found away to fix the colour issue why continue posting these shitty memes?
---
mUh mAtChMAkInG
---
Wrong in terms of the prevalence of bbq&amp;c/wglf during bloodhunts, which are typically higher than a base of 20, which isn't wrong in numbers just simplified to a build that is atypical of bloodhunts. You're all good baby!
---
I feel bad because when I softball I have high rank players and when I go hard it is rank 20s who buy cosmetics for some reason. Pizza Dwights are the most common. I immediately feel like they are vets and they fuck up loops and I realize as Ghostface that I just curbstomped a group of new players.
---
Demogorgon came out and bbq was my first perk. I feel blessed by the entity. It wishes for me to succeed
---
Switch?
---
You are a good man. Thank you.
---
my swf was ranks 1, 4, 9, and 16 and we got a rank 20 killer... okay devs
---
I thought maybe there were extra games or in-game options perhaps
---
does it really matter?
---
Pingspeedtest.com or the equivalent. You can run an internet search for ping/speed tests and use any of them. Your internet provider also has one
---
Why does he have LIVE in his name? Like tf no one cares
---
If you don't own the whole DLC, it gives them to you.
---
There are some survivors who know how to juke billy's chainsaw really well, not a lot, but some.
---
Why Do disabled people even go to restaurants without wheelchair ramps. 
---
Just eat at McDonalds
---
If you watch enough anime you'll know the most horrifying creature is a small helpless female.
---
Yeah then it just takes time. Steep learning curve then easier. Until red ranks.
---
if you're aware of connection issues on your end you shouldn't play killer. the game becomes even more of an unplayable mess then it already is lol.
---
Yup that's it exactly. That night I leveled her up and got some of her teachables, then signed out for the night. The next day, she had been reset to level 1. Though, my iri shards and devotion levels were not reset.
---
It does suck, and I'm more bothered that I was called a liar than anything. I took the time to [provide all the details they wanted](https://i.imgur.com/J98RHNx.png) and still, I get nothing and now my account is under review.
---
They need to fix their game before they accuse their **PAID** customers of being liars.
---
I would love to know who is reporting them, because I highly doubt that every single post on the topic is receiving reports at all let alone enough to garner this reaction. And maybe if THE ISSUE WAS FIXED and the developers stopped ignoring the community and attempting to suppress evidence and criticism there wouldn‚Äôt be so many posts about it. 
---
And they are being upvoted. People are discussing the issue in the comments. Several of the people posting about it are new to the community. 
---
So now you‚Äôre practically saying:
---
- You can only rage/rant or salt/rant flair on Wednesday‚Äôs. (Even though you were also removing/censoring the ones posted on Wednesday.)
---
- If a post doesn‚Äôt get a single upvote or enough for that matter it‚Äôs ‚Äúwasting space‚Äù and can/will be removed. 
---
If you want to start going after ‚Äúover saturated content‚Äù you better start removing 70% of the posts. This would include but isn‚Äôt limited to:
---
- Multiple variations using the same meme templates.
---
 And 
---
- Videos displaying the Exit Gate Escape bug. Or any post talking about it for that matter. 
---
Just to hold up as two examples. You‚Äôre straight up censoring criticism because you‚Äôre tired of seeing it and afraid of the backlash it could and already is causing. You‚Äôre literally just making it worse.
---
What servers?
---
Her telekinetic powers would have to be a factor I feel like and this girl actually got tossed around by trunchbull
---
*megaload*
---
So THIS is what that unused perk ‚Äúunder perform‚Äù is for!
---
Not one that goes "teehee" when killing you. That's just stupid
---
Hag is just annoying. Shes good but shes not as good as freddy
---
And I was thinking about having her as a second survivor too, should have done that instead tbh :/ her and Lavender
---
Should i stop trying to hit them with the chainsaw then ? cus i feel like im just waisting my time trying to him them
---
Uhhhhh the highest one here is 4286, should I just uninstall the game
---
Oh that be cool if trunch could just yeet survivors
---
I actually like watching clips of myself as killer from the survivor's POV. As long as the people seem cool and don't accuse of stream sniping post-game or something, I usually check them out.
---
I'm sorry for the stupid question, but what does SWF means?
---
Ok tried my other wifi and it says its excellent
---
The Stealth status effect *should* only conter aura Reading
---
Console players have no fix to the issue.
---
Hey, rank 6 survivor here, ignore self care. Go for bond instead, or empathy but bond is better, self care is a waste of thirty seconds and if the killer is running sloppy it waste even more time. In those thirty seconds you could complete nearly half a generator. Your perk set up is pretty good, sb is a solid perk and since you don‚Äôt have bond or selfcare resilience is a good perk.
---
I reccomend that you use adrenaline instead of light weight and replace sprint burst with another exhaustion perk like lithe or balanced landing once you can
---
It's a pink add-on to break pallets with shred
---
Ultra rare add-on boss...when the next update hits it will be part of the standard ability but until then...
---
I mean I am a Meg main....
---
And with comments like this you wonder why
---
i feel this on a personal level....
---
4286 can't be millisecond/ping..
---
No effort critique. Make a better meme or hush.
---
Holy shit man , what did you do so karma do you like that
---
It's big arm time
---
Not top like S tier. A tier sure but not tied for best killer in the game. But still pretty damn good
---
Idk what those do, but I'll check em out when I see them!
---
Idk it said that for something
---
This would help with gen rushing, but there is a reason they haven't increased gen time/slowed repair speed before now. Holding m1 is just boring gameplay, and 80 seconds is already pushing it, especially with ruin and stuff like the new dying light coming out. There is a limit to how long you can make someone do that before they get bored. Even if it's only while all 4 are alive, the first death often happens towards the mid to late game. I think this would actually solve some of the major problems with the game, I just don't think it would be palatable for the player.  
---
Gens go fast during the first chase since 3 people can do gens essentially for free. Afterwards you have one hooked, one rescuing/healing, one chased, and one working gens. The gen progress at that stage is fine in my opinion. I think the problem lies in how much is riding on the duration of first chase quickly. If a Billy gets a chainsaw down right at the beginning of the game it's usually already over, but if he's looped for 80 seconds on a jungle gym he's in a lot of trouble. I think slowing the game down early could be the answer, and that is essentially the purpose Hex: Ruin serves right now, although inconsistently.  
---
What we need is a change that doesn't make the game drastically more difficult against the meta killers. It's already extremely difficult to survive against them in solo queue.
---
On behalf of all Testicle mains we are not degenerates and will save baby Dwight's from the cruel world of dbd
---
Survive with friends so essentially it's just a group of survivors queuing up together
---
Maybe it was that one time I teabagged at the exit gate...
---
I tried adrenamine and wasn't very happy with it in all honesty, but it's only level one, so I'll give it another shot after I level it up! Haven't seen Lithe or Balanced Landing yet though.
---
I dunno what rank you are but 1-5 killers that I see 4K most are Billy, Nurse. I wouldn‚Äôt put Spirit on the same level as them
---
For me, killer lobbies are impossible to start, but the surv lobbies I find in &gt;10 min. Are you trying to play killer or surv and on what platform(Xbox here).
---
Shares his Ttv Name - is pissed becuse he gets stream sniped.
---
Np, happy hunting
---
I so would have picked you up
---
Headphones? Lol minus that which is more player-skilled based, what advantage does she have l? Technically anyone can put in time with any killer and play like a top tier.
---
Decisive, without the timer running out when you are downed, is not a risk free perk. The risk of bringing decisive is it‚Äôs an entirely situational perk and can be completely useless if the killer plays a certain way. But to have the killer still fuck you over and then you‚Äôre still not able to use it whilst you just sit on the ground doing nothing while the killer just waits is not fun and that‚Äôs the whole point of a game. You‚Äôre not owed anything that‚Äôs correct, but it‚Äôs already a perk that is situational so you‚Äôre not guaranteed anything, why do we make it so the killer has complete control over if it gets used or not?
---
Speaking of which, I think it'd be perfect if they manage to release it alongside the Quentin face rework

NOOOOOO PUT WRAITH ON TOP

hook THEN hatch.
---
Again,  you're having a survivor vs killer argument with yourself.  You can find that all over this subreddit so I don't know why you're trying so hard to turn this into that. I was pointing out the hypocrisy in OPs original statement and you've only responded with heavy killer bias and exponentially so with each response.
---
they make the survivors DC
---
im just stating the facts
---
Looks about right, I‚Äôm rank 8 and I encounter rank 20 wraiths and doctors for no reason. Bhvr really fucked this up good.
---
Since Ruin is basically all that is run once you hit single digits, I always make it be the totem I‚Äôll use for Inner Strength. Sometimes I‚Äôll bring a medkit as my plan B if I can‚Äôt find a totem or if someone found the hex totem. If I see another Nancy in the lobby, I make sure to at least just use one totem just in case she needs to make a clutch locker player. Other than that, I assume everyone else is running self care or using their medkits.
---
Yeah try to m1 the ppl who are good at juking your chainsaw
---
They wouldn't be able to access the restaurant without the ramps so that doesn't make sense, the ease of buying a game allows idiots to purchase something unsuitable for them.

"minorities don't matter compared to the majority"

Says the dude who ultimately  wants someone to play a game they won't  have fun playing because  you might have the inconvenience  of waiting  longer. I said a while ago let's  agree to disagree but you don't  want to, it's  because  you either chose to not  understand  or you just don't  care.  There is literally no point in trying to get you to empathize.
---
Hey that‚Äôs my birthday
---
whazzzzaaaaaaaaaaap
---
She has the advantage of turning almost every loop into an absolute coin toss. Even incredibly safe loops where you can see the killer every which way?  Yeah, no, Spirit denies you those. Sans the instant down and cooldown, she's like a more controllable billy that turns invisible whenever she uses her power.
---
Wolf Children (Movie)
---
The Quentin rework is out already. It came with the Stranger Things update
---
Right bc SWF and insta win addons/offerings are on the same lvl. Yes SWF is strong, but if you lose with an ebony mori even against swf, then its not the games fault you are losing.
---
Yea I figured, probably hit close to home
---
Damn, that fucking sucks. I am somewhat red/green colorblind and didn't notice the scratch marks for the first couple weeks I played killer, but at least I can see them now. They just didn't stick out to me.
---
I can get around on this, I don't know much about color blindness. What exactly do people have a hard time seeing or differentiating?
---
Oh my god, developers are worse than the players in most games.  He just wants others to have fun.
---
I just wanna say thanks for all the upvotes, this is like my 3rd meme ever so it means a lot
---
im honestly shocked this community has yet to think of other comebacks then just "hahaha yum salt mgmmmmmm taste goob mmmmm"
---
i have the dashboard full of those screenshots, we know and it sucks but we dont need a post every 2 minutes about it
---
Not to be a dick but you killed atleast two and only one red rank in your lobby ...
---
Freddy looks fine, he doesn‚Äôt really need changing.  Some more skins would be nice, but getting Robert Englund would be too expensive for very little gain.
---
It‚Äôs so fucked right now. Been getting bullied by way lower ranked survivors all day. Only one group that‚Äôs been toxic at least but it‚Äôs not fun getting shut out every single game. Hope they fix it soon.
---
Not playing SWF at red ranks is suicide, its practically playing the lottery
---
Borrowed Time should work on the person using it tbh
---
Give or take depends if the ability they have ideas for would work for that kind of killer I can see a skin for plague more then a new killer
---
The Shape \[Requiem\]
---
Do other game studios have to keep this in mind too? This is the first time I seen this requested
---
Look at all those toolboxes and brand new parts though
---
Not true. He still looks like Gollum.
---
Dedicated servers aren‚Äôt on the regular game yet
---
Which killer is it tho
---
And you still managed with 2 , I def would‚Äôve gotten none bc my ruin gets destroyed in the first second soooo . You can‚Äôt complain some of us out here tryna get more than 0 k
---
This has been like every single match for me lately. The rank disparity in games right now is absolutely rediculous. Everybody mentions it in post game chat too
---
I'm so fucking tired of matchmaking right now, i'm getting rank 20 team mates when I'm rank 5, solo. I can't carry babies who kill themselves on their first hook or outright dc. I'm so frustrated.
---
So many pallets, but pretty much none of them are safe loops.
---
Only if he can shoot bees at you
---
the Wraith
---
KEKW indeed, until the dreaded lerys or bamboo/corn.
---
I can't speak for all types of colorblindness, but I personally have Moderate to Strong Protanomaly
---
&gt;Protanopes are more likely to confuse:-
---
1. Black with many shades of red
---
2. Dark brown with dark green, dark orange and dark red
---
2. Some blues with some reds, purples and dark pinks
---
3. Mid-greens with some oranges
---
What this means is the dark red of Auras and Scratch Marks tend to blend in with the ground and their surroundings on nearly every realm except for the indoor ones, resulting in them being nearly invisible on most maps.
---
I'm glad I finally met someone in that 1% of nice ghostfaces
---
&gt; As a spirit main she needs a really hard nerf.
---
Yes, let's nerf a good killer. Because that's worked out so well in the past.
---
I hope you didn't bully the poor guy.
---
Ill just take it as a complement then
---
Can you bring items with you for the adept achievement or do you need to have literally nothing else equipped but the 3 perks? Kinda feel like dicking around and trying for some of these for once
---
I would mori Claudette and not feel bad enough it ngl.
---
Please explain how that is name shaming?
---
Oml imagine being completely grayscale colorblind and playing Yamaoka
---
Mori time.
---
Laugh at the nerds who send hate messages over a video game is always the first thing to do.
---
*cough* Ruin *cough*
---
I'm fine with his 2010 appearance as the default look, but it would be awesome if they manage to get a "Classic Freddy", especially since he doesn't have any cosmetics as of now. As for Robert Englund himself, it's hard to say for sure, but if they can get Bruce Campbell, Natalia Dyer and Joe Keery, it's still a possibility.
---
I'm sure they also thought you ran a mori. Had so many people dc while praying when I tried playing some killer for free
---
I love this concept, great work. Have you done others or is Bing Bing Boi the first?
---
No, there‚Äôs another one coming that will make him look just like his actor. The stranger things update just removed his wrinkles.
---
you gotta practice. you will get better at it
---
Half asleep, my eyes are messed up and on mobile. Bear with me. 
---
Dying Light. 
---
Jade Aldemir as the Survivor. (Or Kyle Crane I guess but I feel like Jade would be better.) Jade would be like a female David King. Being a professional fighter in her life it would make sense to give her a perk that increased effectiveness of pallet stuns. And a new exhaustion perk. If there was a way to implement a perk that used parkour on a very small scale that would be great and make sense. But I don‚Äôt know how they would do it properly. 
---
The Volatile zombie as the Killer. Volatiles would be very easy to manipulate and capture by the enemy. They would have above average maneuverability, and increased prowess in hunting/tracking. They are attracted to blood and loud noises, and thrive in dark environments. All in all it would be slightly similar to Demogorgon. They could also go something similar to Plague. Hiting a survivor infects them with the Harran zombie virus. Those infected begin to suffer from seizures that weaken them until they succumb to the virus (a variation of rabies), die and then turn. There are different stages of mutation as well. They could implement that as part of the power. To manage the seizures and delay symptoms the infected used a medicine called Antizin. It doesn‚Äôt cure you, but slows the process and helps the seizures. 
---
Also they could use the Final boss Villain from the ending of Dying Light: The Following as well instead of just a base Volatile as well.
---
oh yeah that would definitely be a problem haha, hopefully they fix that brotha
---
But not for long enough to justify using it over another perk, since most killers lack the map pressure to actually use it, except maybe Hag, Billy, Spirit, and Nurse. Freddy and Demo as well, but only as a rough possibility.
---
Because they're the killer and they choose when to pick you up, it's your job to bait them into it or if they're not falling for it your team should work gens and by the time the killer picks you up your decisive has earned your team 3/4 of 3 gens (if 3 survivors are alive) or 45% of the total gen repairs. You sitting around doing nothing has just won 45% of the game because the killer made the bad choice of camping you instead of triggering decisive, if your take away from that is 'I'm bored this perk sucks' then you're the reason your team lost.
---
Bing Bong Boi is the first but I do wanna do more! :D
---
The new COD Beta has it so should DBD. I can‚Äôt even play killer because I can‚Äôt see scratch marks. Help out the color blind please BHVR!!!!!
---
&gt;"Well WTF is the point."
---
The point is, you grab one you want and a second at at random. The result is the amount of overall bloodwebs reduced in half, even if you can't get all the perks you want straight away.
---
Yassss can we see the doctor or nurse next? What about both?
---
The Hag is african? O.o
---
Once you do get it youll be getting like 70 - 100k a match with legion
---
I thought that on release, but after playing it more and more on this map I'm not sure anymore.
---
Confused noises in ***Nurse Main***
---
Myers too OP. Plz nerf /s
---
Of course! I'm thinking maybe the Doctor next
---
Sorry it took so long. Life‚Äôs been getting in the way. I‚Äôve had little free time. Anyway, here we are. Next up, I will be celebrating Halloween (my favorite holiday) by releasing 3 different skins- 2 killer skins, and 1 outfit skin for one of the killers. I‚Äôm looking forward to it.
---
Niceeee
---
I'm mildly worried that if I try doing some of my adept survivors that theyll bug out too. I've heard other people having issues with the adept achievements lately
---
Nope, had a friend who just got his PS4 and we were in a party together and just when we were about getting into a lobby the game crashed and we both got a blue screen.
---
You have no idea
---
Yes we do. How do you expect them to fix it when we aren't even complaining about it?
---
Out of all the perks, why NOED?
---
The only counter is iron will
---
I'm blind please bhv help me to play the gzme
---
if you check their twitter, they said yesterday (or two days before) that they are aware of this issues and are trying to fix it
---
See me and all my friends are garbage so no killer should ever worry about dodging us because most of us can‚Äôt loop right and make fun of each other when they get downed.
---
That‚Äôs my exact point mate. The killer has full control over your perk. DS was changed as it was a free second chance perk yes? Now it‚Äôs a second chance perk IF the KILLER chooses to tunnel you or your TEAMMATE chooses to farm you (both of these are out of YOUR control), and now the KILLER still has full control over it which is ridiculous. There shouldn‚Äôt be a timer once you‚Äôve been downed, it should stay with you until you either get picked up or healed up. Keep DS the way it is but the timer needs to stop once you‚Äôve been downed. Mate I don‚Äôt even use DS coz I have better more efficient perks to use that do the same thing (wasting time) but for way longer and I don‚Äôt even have to be injured for it. I didn‚Äôt use the perk before hand coz I didn‚Äôt think it was fair to get simply for free. So saying all this stuff directed at me means nothing as I‚Äôm not the one using it ever. As a killer main I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that I have full control over their perk because their teammate farmed them and I couldn‚Äôt find the teammate, therefore I always let them use it up yet it only buys them 5 seconds. It‚Äôs not a great perk as it is especially in the early game, and to give killer full control over it is just poor design.
---
As a Jane main, this puts a smile on my face and then that squished Ghostface too. Imao

sometimes this is me because I just leave the room because wait times can be so long

What kind of Protein Susie slammin'?

Respond with ‚Äúyeah I know it was‚Äù
---
Oh didn't know that. Then you're right, there no point of posting this anymore
---
I'm not color blind but i really like this post because it can actually make the game alot harder if you cant see aura's. (Plus i want to change the color of aura's)

Oh lol I don‚Äôt know
---
Ye I was playing with a new friend and the killer stood on hatch, closed it and then farmed her over and over. (Pickup drop 3x -&gt; Down -&gt; Repeat) I don't think she was very sold on the game after that.
---
I hate
---
Not to be nitpicky, but I'm like 90% sure that Philip is Native American.
---
Then you can use the perks today. It makes no difference. You dont get an increase in blood points that's not how it works. The only thing you can do is save on time by not playing the game until the event.  But if you play it regularly you still come out ahwad
---
I thought he was from Italy.
---
Can the player choose which color to change the auras too?
---
Yes, exactly this! Especially for Lisa, Rin, and Philip.
---
lmao
---
Not at all my dude I googled "Ojomo name origin" and it came back  with " **Ojomo** is an african **name**, originating in Nigeria, and it means "change, freedom, risk" So that's why I went with black.
---
I like playing sneaky with the option of moving fast when I'm caught. That's why I like Meg Thomas
---
This needs to be pinned on the sub along with the new player guides.
---
If someone could make that happen, I'd be very pleased.
---
Her sweatshirts baggy up in the front but it does kinda look like that
---
Every day we stray further from God's light.
---
He's probably pretty relieved tbh, and I can't blame him.
---
They should take a bit from hunt and let you put a check mark accepting SWF or not when your playing killer, but reward the killer with extra blood points for accepting SWF (like 100% bonus blood points for allowing SWF).
---
actually, after doing some research, it seems I was completely in the wrong. He might actually indeed be African, my bad OP. Still, not sure he would look like THAT.
---
No, they would all be the same and tailored to the different forms of color blindness. No mix and matching shit. Most colorblind have a name for their disorder, and thus have a color to replace each version of clorblind.

Sorry guys, i just reposted the right meme

/u/not_queen_bhvr posted a while back saying that they're currently not bannable, but if EAC picks it up as "Modifying game files" and starts banning for it, BHVR can't do anything about it and will not be reversing bans for it.

Nicen't

learn to make a text post PLEASE
---
New Killer: The Raimi
---
PLEASE oh please, I'm a rank 8~ killer but half of the time I can't tell the scratch marks from the grass. They're both just so similar in shape and color and I'm sure it would boost me a rank or two. Also I'm not sure if this is a colorblind thing or an eveybody thing, but some skins just make survivors invisible to me unless they're moving, it's really tough. Of course, stuff like orange shirts are giant targets, but I've had survivors stand in front of a tree and just disappear.
---
Well. I've gotten (and i've played only about 6-7 hours since chapter came out) Nancy to 50, Steve to 40 and my Feng all the perks to 3.
---
Also did save up a million bloodpoints, 3 dailies (125k worth) and 5000 iridescend shards. Which means 1.52million bp saved up. Then i got another 300k from the new shrine just by playing + whatever I made playing.
---
Getting prestiges up isn't that bad tbh. Goes by really quick especially when you're using offerings and whatnot.
---
Probably gonna work my way towards P3 Steve and Nancy now aswell (full perks).
---
cause people hate it and that makes me laugh. Also I don't really have a favourite perk so I just chose noed
---
It takes practice. Try to be sneaky until you unlock perks that allow you to escape chases easier. Take your time and crouch walk unless you know where the killer is. Take advantage of your 3rd person perspective and look around ALL THE TIME. On a gen? Look around at all possible entrances to it while you work on it. Before going out into the open, LOOK AROUND. Maybe you can see the killer moving in the distance. Try playing as killer at least a few times because you'll see their perspective and know where to hide when you play survivor again. Perks that show you auras for other players are great, as are perks that show you where the killer is (spine chill, alert, dark sense). Unless you have Lightweight try to avoid running unless the killer has 100% spotted you. If you try to unhook your teammates (which you should do) make sure you know where the killer is first. If you unhook them and the killer is still close, you're not helping and you're going to piss off your teammate.
---
I hate the auras because I‚Äôm colorblind. I makes it harder for me to see red on dark backgrounds. It makes it harder to see the auras of generators and hooks, namely.
---
Man are you high the hag is definitely better then Freddy.
---
Persona 5 The Royal looks fuckin weird
---
I think you might be on a NVIDIA driver or Experience version in which the filters were broken (still work but you have to enable them at title/loading screen) because you couldn‚Äôt enable them whenever in DBD. Update GeForce Experience and NVIDIA drivers to latest version.
---
cause they stooopid
---
I think the Dr's skin color is closer to a grey decaying body.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Yee. I feel like I get tunneled more when I run scoops Steve over everyone else, including regular Steve.
---
really cool, got a Download Link?
---
I thought it wasn't out yet maybe you were playing a beta version but you can sign up for updates on the app for IOS and Android
---
Killers get more from each match generally speaking.
---
This community has mainly immature audience on here. There is NO reason to be against introducing proper colorblind options because not everyone has NVIDIA GPU to utilize Its filters which overlay the entire game.
---
As a Kate/Jake main, I both resent and feel this somewhat fits.
---
I think Huntress might benefit from skipping the closing animation. Faster reloads and the like. I also think leaving lockers open to be closed when used would limit survivor's options to counter BBQ by hiding in lockers. You're on the right track though that it really doesn't benefit anyone else and seems a bit underdeveloped.
---
Please do! These are great.
---
ik but which one should i get ?
---
i‚Äôve got the basic killers
---
Could be true. Where can I sign up for updates, or is it already going to be a auto update since I have the app.
---
Ok this was quite funny‚ÄîI definitely snorted much louder than usual.
---
So you honesty think that every single person who wants to enjoy this game with 1-3 of their friends is automatically toxic?
---
That‚Äôs simply not true. Sure, SOME of the teams will be toxic, just like some killers will be toxic, too. But not everyone plays that way. In fact, I was playing SWF the other night and we were getting lots of rank 18-20 killers. So instead of being toxic, we set the goal to get all totems cleansed and the last 3 gens all to 99%. We also gave the killers some downs (and at one point even had to show a baby nurse to a hook when she picked up a survivors). No teabagging. No flashlight spamming. And pleasant post-game chat. 
---
So maybe think twice before assuming every player is toxic, just because they wanna play a game with their friends.
---
Yup, hooking people will crash your game and kick you back to your desktop
---
As a colourblind i can perfectly see auras and scratch marks. That being said i am only colourblind to a certain degree and there are lots of different colourblindness variants
---
My adept Steve I had a pig that booped snoots with me most of the game. Lol. Best wishes to you getting yours soon. They really should fix this stupid bug
---
Those people are the bad players. You may have made some bad calls, but they shouldn't have treated you like that.
---
Hot areas of the map/most traveled
---
classic freddy plz
---
Protan, Deutan or Tritan? Just curious, because as Moderate/Strong Protan I have great difficulty seeing my auras, but I could see a Tritan having minimal difficulty with them.
---
Not yet. I‚Äôm waiting until I‚Äôve finished either all or most killer skins before I send links.
---
Tbh, you're not completely wrong.
---
Spirit doesn't really take any skill and after you get good with Nurse the game gets real easy since most survivors don't know what to do vs her.
---
I would have counted all that shit as a win. Shit is hella funny when I pull it off or when it‚Äôs pulled off on me.
---
They should make this the theme for Steve and Nancy. It‚Äôs pretty much a lighter version of the Demogorgon theme.
---
The Huntress is waaaay too low, and sadly the Pig is way too high.
---
You gotta play to learn him tho??
---
Yeah guys nobody use the new character that you paid money for /s
---
Scoops + NM = bad time
---
Right, and how exactly would one learn to play him.... without actually playing him.... 
---
Also: too*
---
So?
---
You'd be very surprised
---
&gt;All I'm saying is at least learn to play the Demogorgon 
---
That's what they're doing, how else would you learn to play with a killer besides playing with them?
---
If that‚Äôs the case, if your good with traps then padded jaws will help, since you can just pick them off of the trap. Distressing is a double edged blade, since you get bonus devious points, but your terror radius is bigger.
---
Old school pizza face
---
Because Freddy IS silly?
---
Basically if you're wearing any cosmetics that isn't the default clothing for that survivor killers will bring moris and strong addons because according to their logic that means you're try harding.
---
Yes and know. Personal opinion is he is too strong. Closest killer to his tier is Fredward and pennywise outclasses him in both kill count and power level. I doubt they could make PTDC as terrifying as he should be.
---
My internet is so slow the loading screen would be so long it would be infinite, and by the time it ended everyone had left. The support told me there was literally nothing they could do. That was last year and I haven't tried since... and tbh, I never would have gotten the game if I knew Killers had to host using their internet.   
---
Hopefully we'll finally be able to play Killer with the Dedicated Servers! ...this October? Hopefully?
---
Unfortunately it would never happen. But also understandably.
---
I am off that weekend heheeee boi
---
Its p amazing that spirit is so easy and broken even someone coming back from a long break can get kills with her easily
---
I‚Äôve noticed the people with TTV in their name generally have small viewer counts.
---
Watch a few videos on YouTube about the killer and good builds for them
---
Thank god they havent. Until they get rid of them once you buy that chatacter i dont want any new splinters
---
Me, running No Mither so I'm already a one-hit down: HINJAKU HINJAKU!
---
You are stupid and you should feel stupid.
---
He has attained a great length
---
As someone who finished getting all the perks on all the survivors just a month before the bloodweb change, this complaint is frustrating. 
---
Blood webs are so much better than they used to be. Just enjoy it!
---
siiiick, didn‚Äôt wanna try the new iteration of it anyway i guess...
---
What bothers me is that they go "but then the scratch marks and blood will be more visible to people who aren't color blind!"
---
No they fucking won't, how many posts are there pointing out that current scratch marks/blood stains are like neon flashing billboards *unless you're color blind*? There's no way to make them "more visible" to your average player.
---
Furthermore it's not just bloodstains and marks, new-Freddy fucks me up on both sides (playing as and against). I have run through blood puddles without seeing them until afterward if they're even a little bit obscured, the washed out effect of being asleep (or of playing Freddy himself) obscures all kinds of shit that is red.
---
And Ormond is still suffering.
---
I just read that it is likely due to Dying Light. Will stop using immediately. Sucks that the reworked perk is broken.
---
You mind if I attempt to draw spirit like that? I‚Äôll give you credit for the idea if I end up posting it :)
---
this is one of those post you see with the most upvotes on the entire subreddit, i love every bit of it 2
---
New Mori: H-Bomb
---
Notice the üëå lol
---
*cries in ghostface*
---
Yeah I should‚Äôve been more careful with choice of words
---
My attorney talks to your attorney via Skype while having tea...
---
The only mistake was not noticing the key.
---
Popping adren to get another chase and hook with the LATE bonus is common for me.
---
I like it.
---
Let me comment about the NOED tho. Uhhhh, I still use NOED to get hate message because I like the attention
---
That's bullshit, idk what map philosophy BHVR is going with but no map should have a safe route through the whole map without needing pallets, that's just one sign of favoritism from the devs.
---
Another is when they SOMEHOW thought it was a quality of life "fix" to have flashlights stun the killer in the pickup animation, AFTER Mr "we've done a pretty good job so far" said that flashlights are extremely powerful already and feeling how killers feel against decked out survivors.
---
I've played this game a long time and never got this bug
---
its not really their issue?
---
Or they turbo flashlight, gen rush, t bag and point at you lol
---
Ojomo is Nigerian
---
*Downvoted*. Not enough mori finger licking :(
---
No if you want teleport freddy do better
---
If you want to play defensive hag is better
---
The lunge is fucking shit againts a survivor who caan turn to the left or right
---
The scratchmarks are literally high visibility orange, the same color used for roadsigns and the such because of how visible it is
---
This is why I waste a perk slot for deliverance
---
holy shit wow
---
I use noed on pig because I'm bad at her. 
---
I use it on spirit to be mean
---
I got it 3 hours after i uploaded this thanks for the wishes l, i was just upset that this jiped me out of an achievement that i thought i was never gonna get (at least not this fast).
---
Doctor, Spirit, Legion, whomever you're good at playing
---
Isn't their excuse is that it'll be used by others who aren't just to see scratches better?
---
Oh, ok TIL.
---
Destroyed by words
---
It sucks that the devs won‚Äôt see the hard work you put into this. I think you did a spectacular job!
---
So I could ponder...  The sanity of your mother
---
thank you
---
This game made me realize how many people play with absolutely horrid ping. Wifi itself is already way too inconsistent for me.
---
thank you i‚Äôll try the padded jaws
---
i‚Äôll try billy
---
I can relate on pig. I am 100% trash as her. But when I use NOES on Myers, I do it because I'm an asshole lol
---
I've checked out a few streamers after finishing a match with them, and have found a couple other DBD streamers through them.
---
The ones I've found are all very nice. They have small viewer counts, but they really do cherish the people who do show up. One guy grouped with whoever wanted to play, including me a rank 19 survivor who played like actual trash. Incredibly kind and patient. Another guy I've found actually whipped out MS Paint to try to illustrate quick turns at corners as a killer, to help give a new player tips. 
---
I think sometimes the TTV isn't about just trying to increase viewer count, but to draw people in who want to watch themselves or get tips.
---
Yeah i thought so too. Wierd that you would have trouble with it though. Also most colourblind assists in games consist mostly of red being replaced by blue, which is what you should have issues with in theory. So maybe it would just make it worse for you
---
Scratches are already high-vis red/orange, a color used because it's easy to see already (for people with normal vision). You're supposed to be able to see them, all that's achieved by not giving the choice to change the color is handicapping those who cant differentiate red from green.
---
And a insta heal?  I would dc even if I'm survivor or killer
---
