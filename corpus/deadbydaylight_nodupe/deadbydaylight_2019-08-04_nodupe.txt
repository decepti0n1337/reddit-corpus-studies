Bro you are the type of killer who probably sits and face camps and then whines when the survivors get off the hook and escape. You obviously have 0 skill if you can‚Äôt get kills without no-Ed. Perks are to aid the game play, not rely on. Uwu baby killer
---
---
---
Squeak squeaking squeak squeaker
---
LOL. I asked you for a fact and you run away. All you have is ad hominems and anecdotes.
---
Interesting! I took it off because I realised I hadn't used it in over 10 games. And IIRC I still since I don't remember a time when it would have been useful. Must just be lucky.
---
Well I'll be subscribed for cool stuff like this then!
---
At least you are honest  lol. When I down the survivors  that keep getting away I hate it but that kind skill must be purged
---
Suffering from success  so to speak
---
I play bubba at red ranks and I've seen survivors call him OP and a "killer for noobs", but only once.
---
It honestly does
---
these are not.good idead
---
Nice strawman fallacy. That wasn't my argument: you need noed to get kills. Nice ad hominem fallacy, but it doesn't even follow. I actually main swf. Have an actual argument, or only fallacies?
---
So?
---
Would you like to further elaborate as to why these aren‚Äôt good ideas?
---
New content should cost money. And you can earn it all with shards if the price of a fast food value meal is too much for a new character.
---
Do u know what a crouch button is?
---
Perish
---
It reduces the power of healing skillchecks while healing significantly, but ends up making them extremely powerful after landing 5 of them.
---

---
Landing a single skillcheck with autodidact maxed out will instantly fill a chunk of the healing bar.
---
I see a problem with all of them
---
Exactly. Why. It. Isn‚Äôt. EARNED. That is what we‚Äôre talking about here, right? Or are you just having a totally different conversation with yourself?
---
I‚Äôm guessing that all of this is just flying over your head and you‚Äôre not actually comprehending any of it. 
---
Goodbye, and have fun with your non-deserved NOED.
---
I‚Äôd rather just have it have a secondary effect that‚Äôs minor so it‚Äôs not majorly useless. Like faster unhooking or something.
---
Congratulations you did 360s with an analog stick you are very skilled at the game
---
You‚Äôre pathetic and wasting my time so here‚Äôs my final, good bye and goodnight, go waste somebody else‚Äôs time with your ‚Äúfacts‚Äù.
---
My idea:
---
After being hit, generators have instant 10% regression and the generator regression is buffed to 0,5 charges per second. If survivor wants to interrupt the regression he needs to do gen for 5 seconds
---
#WHATDOESTHISEVENDO!!
---
No I am unaware of this so called ‚Äúcrouch button‚Äù lmao, 
---
Serious talk though, I should start using it more.
---
first one is literal invincibility when near a hook. ill hope you dont need an explanation as to why that's terrible
---
second one is a massive nerf to already low/mid tier trapper killers. they really dont need anything else going against them
---
third one is useless and not worth the perk slot
---
All characters specific to DBD you can grind and eventually get, but any liscenced characters you have to buy for 5 a pice, or 8 for a specific duo: ie Michael and Laurie, or Freddy and Quentin
---
Nice
---
While I agree I still hate it lol I just wanna run everywhere
---
You need to buy any characters outside the ones given at the start. You cannot earn them.
---
The trick is to move up the L stick and dont touch the R stick.
---
The autoaim will work correctly then. ;)
---
Even if folks do camp, small hit is just too strong. And for the Hag traps just crouch and they won‚Äôt activate. There‚Äôs easy things to do to avoid these situations.
---
"Good advantage"
---
Because they disregard high level play. It would greatly unbalance play at the highest level while arresting the development of important survivor skills.
---
Did you have to google the word fallacy because the over usage of that word in your last comment is overbearing. I think you got that wernikes though bro because that last comment made no sense. Talk to a local neurologist :))
---
So how many can I grind towards?
---
Love em or hate em they be spitting straight facts
---
Haha lmao. Still running away. Never even made a claim bud. I don't need to support a non-existent claim.You are so bent over desperately trying to make me some bad guy.
---

Every single game i play as survivor against hag, suddendly all my team forgets what the crouch button is... idk i hope at least the one who got hooked and saw hag trappin the hook would be smarter
---
Gen being completed by YOU, you forgot to mention
---
&gt;Scratched mirror is a perk that gives a good advantage to a killer but still counterable.
---
You pretty much can't use Scratched Mirror outside Lery's and maybe Meat Plant. This add-on is more of a meme than anything else.
---
Hex: perks fucking suck
---
You can see her tiddies
---
Hey, I didn‚Äôt say these Should be in the game, they were just my ideas, maybe Small Hit could have a 60-120 second cooldown or something. I‚Äôm just putting out my ideas and seeing if someone else can make them better.
---
Not Big Booty Micheal.
---
Pricing is $5 for one killer or survivor, or $8 for a "bundle" which includes ones killer AND a survivor.
---
Most content can be unlocked through the grind, with the exception of "licensed" killers/survivors such as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface. Because they had to pay for a license to use those people, you have to use real money to buy them. Everything else can be gotten through the grind.
---
The best killers in the game either come with the game (Nurse, Hillbilly) or are unlockable through grinding (Spirit)
---
i‚Äôm at 480 hrs:)))
---
One terrible survivor can throw the game though.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll remember that
---
No because I didn‚Äôt pick some sort of ‚Äúfallacy‚Äù subject to study throughout my life. I‚Äôm actually studying something useful. Hope you didn‚Äôt spend a four year degree studying that üò¨

[My main build](https://i.redd.it/xooebfvdh1c31.png), rank 1 with it every month. Not really unpopular maybe? But it's not the obvious BT, SC, DS, Adren, DeadHard
---
There is always a Claudette in a match, shes just invisible
---
i see him pretty much every match, probably because he's the easiest and most rewarding licensed killer and the newest one at that
---
Me as a legion main (rank 4) can say it wont help u stall the game and thats what u have to focus cause his lethality is not as good as others
---
For free you can play 11 of 16 killers and  13 of 17 survivors
---
If I may ask, what perks help with chasing?
---
I've never seen this. Sounds like bored trolls
---
I don't really know a good build but I recommend self care, lithe, poised/Sprint burst or empathy for support and generators but be careful. On this sub it's possible that unpopular can be perceived as the most toxic perks
---
Bloodhound and Sloppy Butcher
---
Deerstalker and Knock Out
---
Lithe/Quick and Quiet and Dance With Me

Dum virgin

Because you're being useless

Hmm in terms of legit scary I think michael or ghostface cause you know when they see you they want to one hit you. Michaels creepier to me cause hes huge though lol.
---
I‚Äôd say a good scare for the survivors and a good time as Myers for me :)
---
But yeah, it‚Äôs useless outside L√©r√øs and maybe meat plant.
---
It's called an INSTA-insta heal. 2 instas for that extra instantaneous healing
---
If you have video evidence you can report them.
---
How to I do that Bc I‚Äôm new
---
I have that challenge
---
Why do you think Spirit is a virgin?
---
That's good to know, thanks man!
---
That's a good amount not gonna complain about that.
---
Because one of the report options is "body blocking"? I thought that was for killers, thanks.
---
I would say yes if he didnt pick up the feng after dropping her on it, but considering how close bill was to dead I think he figured they'd both die

Wolverines last movie with Hugh Jackman playing main Character.
---
It's nothing to special but I think with some boost perks you can use it to easily get out of the area and to the next gen safer and faster
---
Im confident the level 9 dwight with default skins will use that toolbox responsibly
---
Plus, even if you're gen rushing you'll see where the totems are, just make a note and go check them.
---
Are you serious? You think those are big words? Wow you must be dumb. Would be entirely clueless if I actually used my full vocabulary. Lmao. Feels good to be smart.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ some great combos there thanks for all the different combos, your personal favourite sound hilarious, 100% gonna try that in private match
---
Here‚Äôs an instance since you want one so badly:
---
A survivor runs the killer around for all 5 gens, gets Adrenaline, just to get NOED popped on them when the killer finally gets a lucky swing. (Yes, I‚Äôve had games like that.) Killer didn‚Äôt deserve NOED. They played like trash and didn‚Äôt apply proper gen pressure. And now, they get rewarded for playing that way. 
---
 
---
I get where you‚Äôre coming from for people who don‚Äôt do anything. Do they deserve Adrenaline? No. I agree. They really don‚Äôt deserve to escape in general if they aren‚Äôt doing  anything. Do killers deserve NOED though when they played a trash game? No. They don‚Äôt deserve any kills if they get looped for that long and allow one person to occupy their entire time. 
---
I see you, now do you actually see where I‚Äôm coming from?
---
I believe you go through a ticket system somewhere on their website and select the option for submitting addition report information. It'll ask for the id of the person you're reporting, your id, some other info, and you can upload your extra video evidence there.
---
That's what I was thinking. If it was based on the killer then we'd know who the killer is right off the bat.
---
Why is Self Care still in the top 3, we are in 2019 !
---
Deliverance and Decisive is nasty. Unhook yourself, get chased, get downed, D strike, get chased again. 2 gen chase ez
---
Fair enough I've never actually tried it but I always thought it didnt sound great, I might try a no scratch mark build [poised, lightweight dance with me etc]
---
Movie pennywise is probably owned by Warner Bros. I‚Äôm sure they could get the character but it wouldn‚Äôt be able to look like the movie, and that probably turned them off
---
Right?!? Life shouldn't stupid, it should be fun! Let's go find something FUN to do!! lol
---
Just in case you want to know why I run those perks, I have a comment I did before, I'm just gonna copy and paste it here
---
Alert: You may think this is a weird choice, almost nobody runs Alert, but if you are an experienced survivor who knows every pallet in every map, you get the information about what pallets had been destroyed, this makes your chases a lot better because you know where not to go. And plus, you get to know (because of the speed of the animation) when the killer is kicking a generator, this may be really important if that gen is almost done because you can go and finish it, even if is not almost done if you are not doing a gen, if only that kicked gen have 10% of progression is better than go for a different gen. Also you can know, just to name some examples, if a spirit is phasing after breaking something, or if a trapper is puttin a trap, if a piggy is crouching, if freddy puts a dream pallet after he breaks a real one, really useful to know and to say to a friend if you are in SWF
---
Iron will: It makes your chases better, the killer have it harder to know where you are in loopings with walls. It makes you not being detected, and thanks to that avoid persecutions. It makes being injured not such a great danger, which allows you to continue repairing or doing what you think is the priority at that time
---
Bond: I honestly believe that this is the best survivor's perk even while in SWF, it has so many uses that if I named them I would get bored and forget to name several. I will only say that the real-time information that this perk provides you changes the pace of the game, because time is everything, and this perk saves you a lot of time
---
Balanced landing: Apart from using it because my ping is not the best in all games, knowing that there are maps where there are almost no places to use it, it seems incredible that this perk gives you the possibility of creating new loop areas in that you could not use if you do not run the perk, it is as if by using BL instead of having 10 loop zones, there were 12 or more, and zones that perhaps only you can use because people love to use Dead Hard. Also it's better than DeadHard agains 1-hit down situations (when you are fully healed)
---
I hope it works well for you!
---
I just gave the hatch at rank 12 to a Dwight I was memeing with after someone disconnected at the start of the game. I do watch people play on PC though so maybe no one taught PS4 players that
---
WIDDEN PALLETS
---
It seems to work when using only the W or S keys. If you run with W and A or W and D, etc. it breaks for me.
---
She is in another level, you should learn from her actually. The secrets bro the prophecy
---
Yes, why do you think everyone and even their mom plays Nurse, Spirit or Billy in red ranks ? Because majority of other killers are bad.
---
Honestly I prefer that over having to play each character to level.
---
For example, I as a new player I can play Bubba to use BBQ to farm blood points faster but level, for example, Hag for Ruin.
---
You're not a clown, you're the entire circus!
---
Holy shit that is awesome üòé
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
As a killer main i must say that franklins is my main perk.
---
Fuck flashlights
---
50k is just barely enough to complete a level 50 bloodweb.
---
Exactly, I think these toxic survivors forget that the killers are...how do I put this, HERE TO FUCKING KILL YOU. We don't give a shit about your made up rules.
---
"Underpowered survivor" XDDD.
---
Bro he can down all 4 people at once. Not even billy can do that. Plz nerf.
---
I think the official forums might have a place. 
---
No sure
---
HHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Yeah....not gonna happen. Go self promo somewhere else my guy.
---
Take Blood Hound off for Ruin or Thana.
---
I didn't know that the entitity could show mercy
---
When I was new, I'd "teabag" for pretty much anything. I'd always do it at the exit gates to sort of say bye to the killer, I wonder how many I'd accidentally pissed off lmao
---
No i died once while at the box removing it
---
seems the devs read the forums, so yeah, a popular post complaining about something would get attention. that and contacting support are how you get changes in games
---
You could also replace no mither for self care to 99% heal then "insta heal" when you need or unbreakable for the anti slug effect. Or ignore resilience all together and run prove thyself for the gen speed and blood points.
---
No you die its happened to me before
---
Same.
---
I think your onto something here
---
I could care less, I get 32k games all the time, but that doesn‚Äôt detract from this persons accomplishment.
---
What's wrong with backing a game
---
Upps I forgot point are the most important so I will just go around farming hooked survivors and be a shitty survivor the entire game just like you do  looking hooked survivors the entire game...and complain when someone tbag you
---
This meme format should be used more often
---
Hopefully you can get a new character now (:
---
"Oooohhh entityyyyyy, I have a surprise for you!"
---
Wow thanks this is extremely helpful, especially what you explained with alert I never really though about that. Thanks for the response and I'm getting alot of comments so it's taking a while to respond
---
I just think keys and moris are a way to cheat someone from playing the game. play with mori, and people just don't get to play the intended/expected match they were looking to. someone has a key? well, too bad for the killer who killed 2 people, the other two can just crouch around the map until they find the hatch, robbing the killer from a fulfilling game and any strats to get them a 4k.
---
i understand that removing content isn't favourable. but if it's for a healthier game state, i'm all for it, especially since they've already deleted a killer, it's not like they're going to have an issue with stuff like this.
---
Why bc I dont agree with camping?
---
You need to use a "mori" offering that allow you to kill dying survivors. You get them in bloodwebs. The yellow one (uncommon) allows you to kill the last survivor on the map. The green (rare) mori let's you kill a survivor as long as they've been hooked once. The red (ultra rare) more let's you kill all survivors, as long as the one you're going after has been hooked once
---
Must be hard to hear in that mask
---
Read back your last comment...but slowly.
---
You have obviously skipped most of the forum post.

Kate having a bikini cosmetic ? Hell yeah
---
I scrolled and scrolled and scrolled looking for this comment to upvote
---
making keys not open hatch would be kinda silly. they should just be removed. my idea is to replace them with a stop watch, and addons can be added to provide key benefits.
---
this would be better in the following ways :
---
1. thematically it makes more sense to have a magical item that can sense killer or survivor prescence be something like a stop watch that you can open and look into, rather than just holding a key.
---
2. if you give the basic stop watch a power, which i'd suggest while the watch is active, your scratch marks fade twice as fast, you would avoid situations where you open a chest and find a green key that does nothing.
---
Eh, I find it hard to believe BHVR is that incompetent but I wouldn't be surprised.
---
Devs have already said that hitboxes are working as intended. They're changing animations to match them better, but they're working as the devs want them to.
---
Smells like a repost.
---
Don‚Äôt have to be constructive if it‚Äôs just a boring idea in general
---
I love when im playing killer and a survivor is leading me to a loop but they bring me to another survivor instead. It's great.
---
For context: Killer gets looped all game in a 3v1 and then rage quits and freaks out live on stream.
---
&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Heres the rant afterwards  [https://www.twitch.tv/asheruswiftwind/clip/BlatantTrustworthyEggMVGame?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/asheruswiftwind/clip/BlatantTrustworthyEggMVGame?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time)
---
Yeah
---
There is nothing wrong with any killers perks or any survivor perks in the game. Old MOM was a problem but it isnt anymore. Maps are the problem. Dead hard is an exhaustion perk. Its not op. Self care is objectively an awful perk. Pharmacy is way better. D strike isnt op either. If you play smart its actually a waste of a perk slot for survivors. You only get dsed if you go straight back to the hook and chase the survivor that just got unhooked. Instead of going to the hook because you know you can get an easy down, maybe you should go pressure gens and get survivors off of them. Also adrenaline is a very strong perk but it requires survivors to complete all 5 gens. Running adrenaline is effectively playing with 3 perks the entire game until all gens are done.
---
I should be able too. Have plenty of shards. Only bought Myers and the plague. She was a waste though
---
This format doesn‚Äôt make any sense, that‚Äôs not even the line from the movie, you poorly photoshopped it there yourself.
---
Brutal Strgnth, Spirit Fury, Enduring, Bamboozle.
---
Damn dude who hurt you? There's no reason to act like an asshole, there's a such thing as having a civil argument
---
Lol I feel so bad because most of the time I don‚Äôt mean to.  Plus it‚Äôs satisfying as a killer too.
---
How did you even get that from my comment? I literally said the people who used T.TV in their name they backed the game under. Having your ttv name on a plaque in a game is so cringe worth
---
Honestly that‚Äôs the most unique power I‚Äôve seen given to the Thing idea.  Good job.  I‚Äôm
---
Not sure they would ever do anything like this but I can tell you put some thought into it.  The Thing is my favorite movie and anytime I have  theorized a power for it I always come up with ‚Äúnah SWF would ruin it‚Äù 
---
Yours is pretty good.
---
I‚Äôm shocked... another killer disconnecting because they are butthurt that survivors are doing their job (to survive).
---
While it does fucking suck when someone does something shitty like this, it doesn't fit their ban criteria. 
---
1. The game will end eventually due to EGC.
---
2. Does not help killer pinpoint and kill the guy stuck. The body-blocker would have to be hit first.
---
Unfortunately the asshole who did that will see no repercussion
---
Eye wouldn't believe it
---
You just described a learning curve.
---
You gotta learn somehow. Crouching in corners is a really, really bad habit, that's how you get trapped and insta downed by a chainsaw without even giving him a chase. If you don't want to get bodyblocked in, don't stand in bodyblockable places. I'm not saying these other survivors aren't douchebags, they totally are, but there's a really easy solution to this. 
---
And hell, if someone does this at a hex totem then you get free protection and can just phase through them and the killer once they get hit
---
What about prove thyself resilience?
---
Thanks for the suggestion
---
Thanks for the comment
---
It‚Äôs not.
---
I will give it to them I've had some killers actually see that, or like the survivors that point to lockers and shit, they went after the pointer not me. so I sprinkle credit where due but half the time they chase after me instead. Side note, lockers are implemented to be used, so I use lockers whenever the hell I feel like it strategically or to hide idgaf
---
I had this dude who all game kept hiding in lockers but didnt do anything. Midchase I pulled his locker, killer put him on a hook and all the survivers stood there pointing at him until he just ended it.
---
Yet he had franklin‚Äôs demise to prevent ‚Äúgen rushing‚Äù.
---
Prove thyself is pretty good with teammates, and if you're bad at chases, learn how to use bond and spine chill to avoid and hide from killers.
---
The only reason why I don‚Äôt complain about how OP Nurse is, is because of how difficult she is. Her learning curve is rough, ESPECIALLY on console. Anytime I see a P3 Nurse at red rank on PS4 I know it‚Äôs gg and and it‚Äôs probably just easier if I don‚Äôt resist the ass beating I‚Äôm about to receive. P3 Nurses at red rank on PS4 scare me.
---
Hahah nice :D
---
Oh god my eyeball, this picture makes me want to flail
---
Sabotaging hooks aint toxic, 99% all hooks on the map just so you can following the killer &amp; finish every hook he goes to and teabagging is
---
I mean he could use a voodoo doll to hook people and that voodoo doll should be his power
---
It depends on what IT does.
---
People don't play Leatherface, they like "the other guy with a chainsaw" because Billy is that much better at contesting the map.
---
So
---
Sloppy butcher, Ruin , Dying light , Pop goes the weasle or huntress lullaby
---
With plague
---
2 rare sabo toolboxes gee i wonder how multiple things can get done by multiple people
---
And when that happens it's where i'll be getting my jollies.
---
swf with higher level character with builds specificly for trolling, yah how dare they
---
Is this possible with rbt head pops?
---
We have Ghostface and a knock off teenage knife user, and we've got Leatherface and a knock off chainsaw user.
---
I don't see another Clown being something that prevents us from having Pennywise.
---
Why did you reply 3 times? It's bad, I dont make art because its bad. Your probably never gonna be an artist so you should accept criticism instead of expecting suck ups. Your age doesnt matter either.
---
Thanks! So I should use: Bond, Spine Chill, Prove Thyself
---
For the 4th perk, which do you recommend using?
---
Did you survive?
---
You all have never experienced this pain when playing as a killer or havent even played as killer. 
---
I can tell that by your comments.
---
Nice repost
---
imo, Streetwise (you should use a toolbox with this perk), Prove Thyself, Resilience and Stake Out
---
you can switch Streetwise for Bond to find teammates easier so you can get a benefit from Prove Thyself
---
When in terror radius, Phase is already muted. That means this addon actually has a very small impact at the beginning of the game, or if the Spirit player uses speed addons.
---
Also, you can still hear footsteps provided your sound system isn't god awful and you can also notice grass or corn moving even during phase.
---
I had like 6 key escapes in a row as killer a few days ago. Annoying yes but shit happens. If you really don't want to deal with the key throw on Franklin's. I actually use Franklin's all the time on Hag if I see 2 or more items (Any type, like one toolbox and one medkit, or two toolboxes/medkits, etc.) or one flashlight or key as "McLoopyPants" type survivors can't seem to function without their purple flashlight to blind you after teabagging at every pallet stun. 
---
Legit last night I had a game with two flashlights, brought Franklin's, and one of the survivors would IMMEDIATELY stop to pick their flashlight up mid-chase during the cooldown animation, every time. I also like putting hag traps down on the trap mid-chase because if survivors manage to lose you, or you down and hook them, they tend to go looking for their flashlight and set the trap off, netting you a free hit.
---
I agree keys are annoying but if you hate them *that much* just use Franklin's.
---
matchmaking can be vastly improved to reflect add ons and items. just because youre complacent dont assume there isnt a solution.
---
It's Jojo's bizarre adventure. 
---
They're basically the Jehovah's Witnesses of Anime. You're minding your own business and suddenly everything is a jojo reference and they all decide to start clapping and barking like stupid seals.
---
yes, she does
---
Probably adrenaline BC it's op
---
Very nice R&amp;M reference! How did you make it?
---
I know a pretty good build with No Mither, Technician/Left Behind, And the two perks that increase skill check radius and repair speed when injured
---
I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre unbalanced, simply that they‚Äôre the survivor equivalent of a mori in terms of how they work and what they do
---
Feeling kinda stupid here but I watched this twice. I see 5 gens to go, two pop, then op hits the third and then the fourth pops almost right away. How did that fourth gen get done so fast?
---
I'd imagine because she's being dragged on the ground.
---
This is an awesome idea!
---
Source filmmaker
---
It relates to the format that you made both incorrectly and poorly.
---
Also nice r/iamveryrandom insults
---
Bear traps. When the survivor is being chased, downed, or on hook, they‚Äôre off. If not, they‚Äôre on.
---
I could count the times that's happened to me on one hand and I had 5 in row survivor dc's 2 days ago.
---
I dont blame them for taking the free hit it's not their fault, but I highly respect a killer who sees that as an unfair advantage and goes after the other guy instead.
---
Oh no, people trying to have fun...JUST LIKE YOU.  
---
How. Dare. They.
---
It‚Äôs one Inconvenient game. Cry about it.
---
Noed and blood warden. How‚Äôd you only get one?
---
P3 nurses in general are scary
---
&gt; Yes,i know a lot of those things can already be improved with perks,but that doesn't automatically dismiss the idea of improving the stats at base for underwhelming killers.
---
The thing that lead to the idea in the first place was that certain perks are absolutely garbage on some killers due to them already having a base version baked in. Other perks being nice, but not necessary.
---
So why not do a little bit more with that?
---
- Doctor can get by without any Detection perks because Doctor already finds Survivors stupidly easy. He needs help in other areas, but you'll never see a good Doctor take something like Whispers.
---
- Nurse, Spirit, and Billy won't take Play With Your Food because they already have a better version in their power.
---
- Plague doesn't need Coulrophobia or anti-heal perks because they can't anyway.
---
So why not give certain killers other benefits? Specifically with the 10% Pallet breaking speed buff on Trapper, it does a ton of things for him; people are more likely to take Windows which play into Traps, he becomes much more dangerous at the spots he is in but still can't go sprinting across the map, and it allows him to **destroy** pallets/generators with Brutal Strength or helps him charge Spirit Fury faster.
---
Basically, it makes it where Trapper still has to work to find you, but he's much more suited to actually doing something about it when he does.
---
I'm not sure I would really mess with Blind/Stun duration though. That seems like it should be something that stays the same to offer the same options of Counterplay to the Survivors.
---
sorry what...? she is top 3 worst killers in the game. traps are luck based and she is soo loopable
---
Streamers and youtubers build their entire gimmick around being as toxic as possible in matches and all their fans wanna be just like them but if you point it out they get super defensive &amp; ironically toxic
---
‚ÄúAccidentally‚Äù
---
Then why did you title him as toxic? tf...
---
Any of the horror movie icons would be awesome in the game it just takes getting the ok to use then but it‚Äôd be cool to see how they make him into the game
---
Just shush
---
Harvey Weinstein is a sick fuck and I don‚Äôt want to support him with any of my cash. The devs share that sentiment.
---
That is a big facepalm right there lol
---
I will argue with your hate if I want
---
Yeah it was well hidden, even i couldn't see the aura of the totem. Still surprised that the survivors actually found that. #feelsbadman
---
You can't stop me
---
yea the shoes and hair are what hint towards
---
One of my favorite movies is The Thing, and it has heavily influenced alot of other horror/sci-fi pieces I genuinely like.
---
I agreed reading all the other ideas that were presented, that SWF would dampen it. I still wanted to keep that "who is it" edge without it being its entire gimmick. 
---
I think it'd be awesome to imagine an SWF against my concept.
---
Survivor: Larry, Curly, Moe, is any of you running towards my gen?
---
-nope, nope, not me
---
-ahhhh shit!
---
All of this as The Thing starts to transform only a few feet away during the realization
---
You spammed me and I should shush? You shouldnt be on reddit kid.
---
Play killer against some mixed rank swf and see how much good fair fun it is, i got plenty hooks and one kill so its not like i aint get shit
---
You actually make no sense lol. The way that you get gen grabs on a prayer beads spirit is by running monitor and abuse. It allows you to get closer to the gen and phase before they hear your terror radius. This addon actually has a huge effect on the game. You just have no idea how to use it. The footsteps are very faint and you actually won't be able to hear them if you are next to a gen that is almost completed. Noticing grass or corn moving is also very situational and doesn't always work. Also, you dont know whether or not the spirit has prayer beads until they have already used it against you.
---
That‚Äôs a sorry excuse lol. Adrenaline only gives a five second sprint burst. You have a permanent 4% boost.
---
Are you just not able to read anything other than the title and your own comment
---
ok mr 12 day account lemme educate you on two things, it‚Äôs called an upvote, and emojis are bad
---
Then why post it. You cant make me care. Its trash. Expect criticism kid.
---
RBT's are powered when applied (timer paused while downed or hooked). 
---
Jigsaw boxes no longer display aura to survivor (except when using perks that show box auras)
---
RBT'S cause a (possibly random?) Debuff like blindness,hemorrhage,hindered or whatever,by default.
---
Jigsaw box success chance is percentage based instead of total rng. Percentage starts low and builds with each box failed. 
---
Lower base ambush charge time.
---
Pigs biggest problem,in my opinion,is that her unique quirk (RBT's), are garbage. All they really provide are a little bit of game slow down while the survivor searchs a box or two. 
---
I can count on one hand the number of times i've had an rbt actually kill someone.
---
I'm not saying that every rbt should pop heads, but they need something to make them interesting and worth the time to bother using.
---
Oh yes of course the double insta 5Headüç∑
---
Sometimes you just get stomped, there is no point in raging about it because it wont change that fact.
---
Isn't only the ones who think they are female when they are males the ones with mental illness? Or is it something else? I forgot
---
It‚Äôs like the virtual like/voting system here. For some reason people take it extremely seriously to the point where they think if they have a higher karma they‚Äôre somehow superior to others. It‚Äôs kind of like people fishing for likes on Instagram however here there‚Äôs a visual tally of the cumulative amount that people have which can really feed into peoples egos. No need for the sad face dude there‚Äôs nothing wrong with sharing cool art that you see lol
---
Oh shit I feel the same way, it's been a long time since I revisited JC and dont remember Weinstein being a part of it :/ Thanks for the heads up
---
Traps are not RNG to find the key to take trap off. It‚Äôs predetermined which jigsaw puzzle the key to get trap off is in. Survivor just has to try the right one (source: dbd dev stream)
---
Same
---
thanks for the information, people have talked about karma before and i had no idea what they were talking about lol at least now it makes some sense
---
Well I have only been playing for about 2 months now, but I'd guess that my average is about 3 sacrifices per match.  Every once in a while I come across a swf team that coordinate flashlight attacks and manage to get 3 survivors to escape.  My rank is not very high yet since I mainly play survivor, so my average may not be reliable.
---
JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP NO ONE CARES
---
Gee, do you realize that Alex‚Äôs toolbox only slightly boosts repair speed? It‚Äôs pretty much just for sabo. So no, sorry these two were not genrushing, that‚Äôs absurd.
---
This is honestly exactly what I'd expect from a horror flick of the past anyway.
---
And ochido built his career being a toxic killer. Stop acting like ONLY survivors are capable of toxicity. It goes both fucking ways. The difference is with a survivor they have to either be a fucking god or have a really really really good team. The killer doesn‚Äôt necessarily need anyone. But yes how dare a survivor have any skill our outplay a killer.
---
This is me
---
GOD i had a match the other day where a Dwight did nothing but gens, to the exclusion of everything else, and then after the rest of us died, hopped into a locker within hearing range of the hatch and stayed there until he got crows (looking around the whole time so i know he wasn't afk). killer found and killed him but it wasn't as satisfying as i wanted it to be :(
---
If the first thing you do is crouch in a corner when your first spawn in your not helping the team whatsoever. Maybe your new which cool I get it but if your not new your just hurting the team.
---
Plenty of us have. Again. You aren‚Äôt fucking special. Get. Good.
---
Ig you didnt care why would you reply? Clearly I hurt your childish feelings.
---
If you stomp a shit-tier killer that would normally get 0 kills, and you do not take the small bit of time needed to skulk around and cleanse dulls to literally deny said scrub-tier killer their NOED, then you get what you've earned. Take the time, clear the totems (which will also demoralize the killer even further) and then proceed to mock them in the end game screen because that's usually the position that a survivor whining about "shit tier killers" getting a 4K takes.
---
It sucks, and if I get hit with NOED, I can totally own up to it; it was my fault for not taking that extra bit of time for insurance. I roll with the punch and go to the next game (and may even swap to a survivor with Small Game, just in case.)
---
Dont matter how good you are dipshit if a full teamswith coms brings every perk &amp; item they can to cheese the game, you asshats got such an inflated ego from abusing mechanics to destroy the killer you think you're gods fuckin gift
---
It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs playing nea, it was a joke
---
It's something :)
---
Oooooooooooooh. Isn‚Äôt Nea the Entity?
---
did you just say you don't like Spine Chill ;(
---
I'd say playing with a timer decrease could help since her traps are not near as deadly in the endgame now.
---
Shit like this is why i hate using hex perks.
---
Totems should have a minimum collision area around them that doesn't allow them to spawn within X meters of a chest/generator/hook.
---
Also when Noed had no counter and stayed active all the end game
---
Bro you do fucking realize 2 people can rush gens while one of the other 2 do hooks and troll baiting
---
Bro your Perks, you literally allowed them to rush you.
---
Yea but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúnone of them have the key. It only rolls for the key once you finish‚Äù it‚Äôs a game of guessing. Your guess isn‚Äôt rng
---
Yeah, yellow mori is obviously fine. It literally has no effect on the game balance, anyone you could yellow mori you could just hook instead.
---
The simplest and most reliably balanced fix to green/red mori is death hook only. Your idea's definitely interesting, but it has the potential to remove exactly as many hook states as red mori's currently do, which means it doesn't reduce peak bullshit, it just makes peak less bullshit less common.
---
*Hypocrite*.
---
Mindgame potential is huge. You really underestimate the lack of a red stain until you face Ghostface the first time. But to be fair, both Legion and Ghostface have their pros and cons.
---
Legion has a great power for landing first hits and tracking. Ghostface has a great power for short chases and actually downing people.
---
Legion uses DS on themselves to shut off their power. Ghostface's power is easier to counter than Trapper's. So yeah, to each their own.
---
I think they announced that they were going to address that in a future patch
---
Yall really cant fucking read, 99% all nearby hooks so you can dunk on the killer &amp; teabagg for good measure is what makes it toxic
---
I never leave a baby Dwight behind.
---
What? Every killer is terrible on hospital. There's so much vision loss and so many windows and so many different variations.
---
I run No mither, self care, botany knowledge, and unbreakable (can be switched with adrenaline) it‚Äôs a really good combo for my David
---
Oh cry about and go face camp someone. I have zero sympathy for you. You clearly don‚Äôt bother trying to see another perspective, clearly never played survivor long enough to understand. It‚Äôs one fucking game. If you‚Äôre getting this every game then look in the mirror and wonder if maybe it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre doing. Play a different killer or better yet a different game if you hate it so much. They are literally catering the game for weak unskilled people like you and it‚Äôs destroying the game. How dare anyone do better than you and not give you 32k Bp and the 4K. I‚Äôll tell you what everyone else tells other killers and all survivors when they get on here and complain about this.
---
Cry about it. Get good. Play something else.
---
Urban Evasion? So you're the teammate that just crawls around and never does anything, eh?
---
Use a macro, they're not against game rules or bannable.
---
Will save your keyboard and your joints, I use one because of disability and it works wonders
---
These guys aren't even mixed rank tho? 
---
3 of them are only two ranks higher than you are
---
We out here being bullied
---
THATS HOW YOURR SUPPOSED TO SABO. Hooks come back after a certain time. Just breaking them literally does nothing to fucking help you and defeats the purpose!
---
Ruin can be easily countered but with noed if you're found you usually die solely due to speed boost. I have no problem with the instadown but the speedboost is the real problem making escape unnecessarily difficult. Also if every killer runs ruin and survivors power through it. I don't understand how adrenaline isn't earned at that point.
---
Self care and no mither ??, why
---
it‚Äôs been bugged since the 3.1.0 update
---
You you?
---
That‚Äôs the point I believe you just are allowed to do a slight dash to avoid a hit or bait a hit. Use meg if you wanna sprint she has the sprint burst perk.

99% hooks is the smart way to play sabo, duh. That's still not toxic. Sure tbagging is though
---
Yeah that Nea must‚Äôve been slamming out those gens with that brown medkit. Perfect item to bring in for a genrush.
---
Director of jeepers Creepers is a convicted pedophile
---
Nobody who takes themselves seriously gets mad at a killer "camping" half way across the map. People get mad at proxy camping where the killer pretends they are patrolling but they are obviously just baiting an unhook because they won't find a survivor otherwise.
---
It‚Äôs so annoying like I used to use it for everything now it‚Äôs just ‚Äúpush A and go into exhaustion‚Äù
---
The only reason you got these gens done is because you didn‚Äôt do totems. This argument is overdone and incorrect.
---
Yupp
---
Yes. It is broken on PS4 as well. According to Pc friends of mine it‚Äôs the same there too. Sucks. I stopped running self care because I realized it‚Äôs too much of a selfish crutch that wastes time. (I usually play with people so there‚Äôs not much point if we can coordinate and heal each other) Balanced Landing is still really inconsistent and broken too so I stopped running it for DH since I don‚Äôt heal anymore. It‚Äôs great when it works but dear god it almost never does anymore. It‚Äôs about as bad as Head On.
---
This guy got his sexual predators mixed up.
---
The point is at your level of experience you can't aptly criticize the game or its balance. Saw killers (actually, just billy because bubba  is hot garbage) take a lot of practice to get hits with and even then can be destroyed by coordination and survivor mechanics. There is a reason the best two killers (spirit and nurse) attained that position without instadowns.
---
entitity
---
So you would rather them drop the hook immediately, when nobody is around, so the hook can just respawn after. Sounds smart.
---
Ehh it‚Äôs been bugged since before that. It just got much much worse after the update. Friends of mine and I have been having issues with it for months now.
---
I swear most exhaustion perks are getting on my nerves now. Like I used to use Balanced all the time, it never worked so I stopped, now it‚Äôs dead hard
---
Aces all ways get hatch if they the last one. Do do my main survivors like Kat Jane and David the sexy ass triplets
---
You quite literally just have to look at him
---
There's no hope for her XD
---
It is unrealistic to expect a solo survivor to get all 5 totems without throwing the game because he never does any gens while he looks for totems to prevent a noed that may or may not exist.
---
It's not really a... vastly diverse game man. If they're getting items and add-ons to boost the only things they can do, they're gonna use it. Blame the game, not the people.
---
I mean that‚Äôs just your opinion man. I too make sentences with fancy sounding words.
---
They're both pieces of shit so who cares lol

Your post is about being body blocked into a corner or small space where you cant move out of. Most people dont want to play with teammates like that. I get it I used to do the same thing then I just started running head first at the killer. Or hopping on a gen as soon as the match starts. Now I usually survive and also have alot more fun doing it too
---
What totem? Where?
---
You can contact BHVR and they‚Äôll give you everything you had before the bug happened and some extra bloodpoints as compensation
---
Agreed. The only thing Balanced Landing is good for us the passive now. It doesn‚Äôt proc 50% of the time. Now DH does it. Lithe can be too situational and Sprint Burst is literally useless after the Exhaustion changes 2 years ago. I really don‚Äôt want to crouch walk even with Urban the whole match just to be able to use it when I want to. And Head On literally was always broken and still is. 
---
Just know that the bug also can give you the sprint burst but still let you get hit and still exhaust as well. I‚Äôm constantly getting hit through the dash now.
---
Rush gens and don‚Äôt cleanse.
---
Actually me when I started
---
Still me,  make of me what you will
---
Ok explain a situation where you go against a nurse,Myers,Billy, huntress, spirit,and in some instances plague or doc. Where the best counter is gen rushing before they can get enough momentum to ultimately just win the game. As a swf it's not a problem but as 1 or even 2 survivors taking that time to find AND cleanse all totems will lose you the game before it even activates. Killer aren't always the only ones racing against time
---
(This might seem dumb but how do I get ‚ÄúMake America Groovy Again‚Äù after my name?)
---
But which box the key is assigned to is RNG. The key is *randomly* assigned to a box, and then the survivor has to find whichever box the key was *randomly* assigned to, therefore, the traps are reliant on RNG. What are you having trouble understanding about this?
---
Damn, that‚Äôs nice.
---
Thanks a ton!
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you want to use ruin? If you don‚Äôt have it then get it.
---
Np
---
Keeping your focus on only 1 survivor, getting kill on that survivor quick. Even tho it might be a strategy for some, can be done by mistake or luck, community(at least survivor mains) seem to hate it bc it makes the game *unfun* for the survivor. No one actually can judge you for this since it can be a strategy and has no way to report it.
---
No Jesus left behind! üëèüèª

How's Jake underpowered?

Is the video down I can‚Äôt watch it?
---
Instant BNP was a counterpart to instant mori
---
I do have it. I just don't like it.
---
But... Wouldn't that make the build 'better'?
---
I believe that pertains to bodyblocking the hook, preventing the killer from getting a hook, and not about cornering a survivor.
---
People like to cry about this but on the rare occasions I play killer, I'm chasing the first person I see, every time. If that happens to be someone I just hooked or hit, well, that's their bad luck, I guess. I'm not going after people specifically to remove them one by one, but I'm not going to bypass someone that ran in front of me just because they were the last person I hit either.
---
A lot of people like to assume maliciousness, when it's often not the case at all.
---
This is golden
---
I honestly have that experience more with Meg and Feng, and that's coming from a Meg main who only misses Ruin skillchecks trying to hit the great skilcheck
---
Survivors have enough op perks already, I don‚Äôt want to hear any complaints.
---
I‚Äôd rather just never give hatch away tbh.

**o h  n o**

I consider it more of like when you're unhooked, killer comes back sees both of you and goes after you even if your teammate is closer to the killer. Just how I label it though, I think it depends on the person
---
When I had this happen it ended in an hour and a half standoff where I just watched YouTube videos
---
Vigil with Lithe imo and Pharmacy with Botany Knowledge
---
No. The reason they completed the gens is because your gen pressure is trash. Doing totems just because the killer might have noed is dumb. It just adds time to a game without adding value. Do you like holding m1 with no fear that the killer will check on them and find you? Because killers dont check on them unless they are already active. Do you like searching around the map hoping to find them all? Pro's dont even search for ruin because it's a waste of time and takes forever, just for one fiery totem.
---
Most survivors would heal you before continuing on a gen
---
I love that perk, I've only ever experienced it as survivor as I don't own Freddy and I mean like, I hate getting stuck and probably dying, but the amount of "ohhh shiiit" and everyone running around like a chicken makes it hilarious, even though it'll probably be the end of me
---
Just even thinking about DbD is toxic
---
Yeah, it's always satisfying to watch them die after not doing anything
---
Poor Bubba is trying his best.
---
Depends. Usually play hag and I'd say average 3 with her. I get plenty of 4k's. Playing Myers I usually get 2-3. The occasional 4k.
---
Scary part is your joke is accurate as well. Who was asking for a pig nerf?
---
Work on gens please
---
I always run Bond on every build but often use Spine Chill and/or Prove Thyself as well and they‚Äôre great. As others said, if you really want to focus on gens, Streetwise (with a toolbox) is an OK option. Urban Evasion may be helpful if you want to be able to hide by nearly finished gens. Poised is another option as well and helps you confidently run to the next gen or even save you if you‚Äôre in a chase and someone else is genning. 
---
Still, I am hard-pressed to say you still want an Exhaustion perk. Balanced Landing is my personal favorite but also for gen reasons. Aside from the reduced stagger bonus and speed boost, I find it great for tackling risky gens. Most of the maps have central gens that you want to knock out ASAP and many times, they‚Äôre near a drop point perfect for BL. Even aside from the central ones, many hills or 2F areas have a gen, like the Church or the Ormond lodge. Combine that with Spine Chill and you can really commit to a gen as long as possible before running from an approaching killer.
---
What perks should i use with dead hard? Normally play with a 4 stack.
---
Oh look a baby survivor.
---
Yeah really.  "Gg it was fun staying on a hook for 4 minutes while you kept hitting me". No thanks, those people don't deserve more than no comment and an mlga block.
---
I honestly think an add-on that eliminates her Ambush roar would be a lot of spooky fun, but not too OP, as it would only really work at low-visibility loops and some jungle gyms. It would be fun scaring people off gens, not to mention, Pig would have to choose between a quiet ambush or attempting to get a risky grab.
---
Wraith‚Äôs SFX add-ons (and even Hags) really give me goosebumps even after a year of playing and I‚Äôd love to see more like it on other killers. But I think an add-on for Huntress that eliminates her windup sound would be spooky as well.
---
"This isn't a game. You're not supposed to have fun!"
---
Not entirely sure how my friends did it but some people said to contact them via email at mailto:deadbydaylight@bhvr.com
---
I always use Spine Chill ); one of my favorite survivor perks, Counters Pig, Ghostface, and Spirit. As well as counters perks like Dark Devotion and Tinkerer.
---
Not only that but the extra speed helps in EGC when you're opening an exit gate in clutch.
---
There was a bot spamming the subreddit with a scam link to this a while back, stay careful on your purchase
---
Oof. Why would you sit there so long?
---
For me it can be two things. One would be if you just have some grudge against a particular survivor, and your sole objective is to find them and keep chasing them no matter what until they die. The far more common form of tunneling though is when the killer‚Äôs strategy is to proxy camp hooked survivors, which basically means patrolling aka trying to bait an unhook as opposed to outright camping in front of them. They may check the nearest gen, but their objective is always to watch the hook no matter what. Once they see someone coming for the save, they make a beeline back to the hook and try to take out the unhooked guy again. This is why Borrowed Time and DS are essential perks and always need to be ran as many killers do this. Think like Billy zooming back to the hook, Spirit phasing back, Wraith lingering around while cloaked, etc. Its very common.
---
This is my definition but it seems to vary.
---
Entititties
---
I would totally buy basement stuff for blood points. It would be great with my basement trapper meme build.
---
He'll add a challenge system that rewards basement decorations.
---
I tested this today to great success, four games in a row with shroud, 3 DCs.
---
Doesn‚Äôt Nea already do this?
---
You ever been dragged by your feet? Your shirts gonna come up.
---
Don‚Äôt quote me on this but I don‚Äôt think the killer stagger is nearly as pronounced/long as survivors. I play Spirit the most so don‚Äôt notice it much but I am not totally confident tbh. 
---
However, with BL, I nearly always get a killer eager to swing at me during the drop so I typically get even more distance that way when they miss. Some killers will expect it after the first time but fairly often, if I‚Äôm spotted and a killer knows I have BL, I can perch up somewhere safely. They‚Äôll either not want to deal with me and leave or sit below me trying to bait me out... all while my not-even-active BL runs its cooldown and I get a sweet heal. It‚Äôs pretty satisfying since I‚Äôm terrible in the chase. (; 
---
I was very skeptical of BL for a long while and now I hate playing without it.
---
It's not because I'm scared man. It's because I don't want to get caught right at the beginning of the game. I don't do well in chases so I just consider myself a Gen jockey. It's not just some way survivors perceive each other unless they're literally running around the map they're not doing anything, and you know for a fact because you've seen it. Don't just assume your teammates are being useless. They may not be able to 360 and stupid bullshit like that.
---
Just tap sprint to cancel the heal and then start walking. If they keep at it then it sucks, but they‚Äôll eventually learn. As you get to lower ranks survivors understand the communication a lot better and will leave you alone after a cancelled heal
---
Stop comparing survivor perks to killer perks. Killer is the power role and their perks should be stronger on average. We just got decent totem spawns and you get people already want totem aura reading. Fuck that.
---
Go on a Gen!!!!
---
Git gud
---
RC bad
---
Yeah, thought about this after I posted it, hahah
---
There is no reason for you to hate so why do it?? You must be one of the killers in the video.
---
"Omg no don't do that! That's gen rushing!" Hehehehe
---
interesting that sounds like a ultra rare to me lol
---
Petty. I like it.
---
Now thats content
---
Why you gotta suck up to a trash artist egi
---
Okay, this was actually me when I was first starting out, I basically didn't care to read what any addon did and just thought 'pInK aNd puRple pOwErfUl' so I combined them together to be even more powerful.
---
That's because it takes less time to reactivate, like let's say a team of 2 go on a gen, but with Discordnance 3 you wouldn't be able to see that other team of 2 on a different gen if one gen is still lit up for 12 seconds, because it only gives you the notification for one gen at a time, But, if you had Discordance 1 activated then you have 8 seconds to wait until you can get a notification from it again. So overall, it gives a better cool down at level 1 than level 3. There aren't many situations like this, but you never know, especially if you are playing Nurse, Spirit, or Billy and you want them off of the gens fast, you want Discordance 1. Plus, with Discordance you don't really look at the aura, you mainly see the direction where the notification was triggered, so why not have a faster cooldown?
---
Also Rancor lets you mori the obsession endgame.  Can be quite useful.
---
Auras within 40m or so would be great. If it's global, then it also functions as a remaining count
---
First, make it so that when a survivor gets a trap off the pig can go to the jigsaw box and take it back. Only can take traps back once 
---
Second, survivors should have to play a little minigame shorter that the system takes now in order to get the rbt off.
---
Third, crouch speed should be increased
---
Fourth, The dash should 1 tap exposed survivors. 
---
And lastly new Mori Please. Hers is pretty boring
---
Trying to think about anything in this game "logically" is a fool's errand since this game is anything but logical. The devs just suck at her skin textures.
---
Would rather go against a good Nurse on PS4 than a Spirit or Hillbilly.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with that?! We were all there once, or have u forgotten?
---
I still think an ebony mori should be strong, the reason I suggested my method is to avoid deleting a survivor literally minutes into a match and forcing them to depip and leave with like no BP. At least having to hook everyone once allows for survivors to have a chance to play the game even if it still does lead to defeat against am efficient killer.
---
Maybe BNP? The version that gives you continuous small skillchecks(Not the broken insta gen completion from 2016 or the current version)
---
Fact: no-Ed is a crutch perk that takes no skill to use and kill survivors who worked and avoided the killer the entire game. 
---
Fact: the purpose of the game isn‚Äôt for the survivors to not escape but instead to use strategy to make it out from the killer
---
Fact: adrenaline isn‚Äôt a crutch perk it has to be earned. We have to complete all of the generators to use it and half the time the killer has no-Ed which makes it useless anyways
---
Fact: you have no debate knowledge. You just sit there and use words like ‚Äústrawman‚Äù ‚Äúad hominem‚Äù and ‚Äúfallacy‚Äù to make yourself seem smart but when in retrospect you just want some attention or are trying to fill some void. Half of your messages don‚Äôt make sense and you have to go back and change your comments to make them actually readable. You contradict yourself half of the time and to me seem like an internet troll. Uwu. Baby killer ez. Have a good day si
---
What do you expect? They're survivors not people
---
I've been yelled at for "camping" because I kicked the gen the Survivor was working on, walked past the hook, kicked the pallet the Survivor wasted trying to get away from me, and then walking back to the hook to double check. That's not "Camping", that's me having things to do in the area and you decided to unhook the survivor while I was still around.
---
Even then, on certain maps Camping is a tactic to be used. I'm sorry, but if we're on Azarov's Resting place and Survivors have the three gens on one side done, there's really no point for me to stray too far from the hook when I can see the other Gens and half the map is useless to everyone now.
---
Jokes are supposed to be funny. Stop back pedaling into the "bro it's just a joke xd" every time you're wrong
---
Killers don't get to complain about Decisive Strike if they tunnel a Survivor.
---
Survivors don't get to complain about NoED if they don't do the Totems.
---
Tried it, don't like it, way too luck based
---
For that scenario, 3 gens still have to be complete and the killer has to have no idea where either are, and if the survivors aren't together, the killer can close the hatch before the 2nd survivor makes it.
---
The horrible scenarios of a 3-4 man escape through hatch super rarely happen, usually is already in a survivor sided match, and can be countered by killing the key survivor or bringing a perk like Franklin's.
---
Key escapes aren't free wins and can easily be denied by thr killer in various ways
---
Just wait till you get a lobby that's obviously a 4-man sfw with insta-heals and flashlights, then you'll understand real fast
---
even without NOED, you will get harassed by survivors :)
---
I got my first 32k game once but I didn‚Äôt come to reddit trying to get karma with it.
---
It exceeded it you're welcome to come back ;)
---
You have to take 3 Protection Hits before it activates...meaning you are on the ground 3 times...hooked and dead
---
Depends. As of recent it hasn't been alot of people DCing at least for me and the devs are going to be cracking down on DCs when we get dedicated servers which is soon so don't worry about them.
---
AKA: hatch camper
---
Alright I mean it made me laugh but it was kinda lame that I got such low BP from it and didn‚Äôt get to super slap more people
---
Regarding the reward, quoting the e-mail I got a few hours before the test ended:
---
&gt;We wanted to let you know that rewards will be giving [sic] later this week to the participants who followed the rules.
---
So if this is anything to go by, the rewards should be given out today.
---
don‚Äôt play wraith?
---
LOL, I started playing another game and now I wanna get back to DBD but I just can't.
---
Pls help
---
Just use the perks you want. As long as they're not bugged to hell or do what they're not supposed to, just play the game you fucking paid for
---
Apply to Surviviors and let them see the killer rank too and I think this would be an amazing change
---
Nah.
---
The killer can't cheese their way into a rank they don't belong. Only survivors can create shitty SWF groups and cheat their way into the newbie section of the game.
---
Why should Surviviors not be allowed to see the rank of the killer? There isn't a downside to it. Solo Surviviors get boned by 3 man SWF groups that do the shit ur referring to since they'll get a killer higher rank than them which will ruin their fun once the killer sees who the weak link is.
---
Lately the game has been buggy. I was in the middle of fixing the gen when the game suddenly gave error and boot me back to PS4 main menu.
---
Another time we just started the game when all of a sudden we got black screen of death and the game showed that match has ended without anyone disconnecting.
---
um never complained all i said is its pretty dang dumb to downvote a comment that simply said they havent told us if its original or licensed yet...not like i said WELL TOO BAD CUZ ITS PROBABLY NOT AN ORIGINAL KILLER! geez
---
If you're solo, matchmaking will make you the same rank as the killer, within a 3-rank discrepancy. It's only the SWF groups that cheat their way into ranks where they don't belong.
---
So what's wrong with being able to see the killers rank then?
---
HONESTLY. I never stay to spectate unless someone specifically fucked me over and I wanna watch them die and I usually message them after like good. Wow I'm so petty.
---
Because it's obvious.
---
&gt;I'm trying to do my rituals
---
Bruh pls try botany with a medkit instead it saves so much time and you heal others faster
---
because theres a girl

---
hehe 69 meters 
---
but good maths
---
My favorite is when you're trying to kick back and play some killer (not spirit or nurse), and end up in a 5 minute game.
---
IT IS THE BEST COMBO IT MAKES YOU UNABLE TO DIE!!!
---
The whole thing BHVR has been focusing on is bridging the Gap between SWF and Soloq so that they can better balance killers. Letting Surviviors see the rank of the killer does little for SWF but a lot for soloq. 
---
I'm not saying let Surviviors see the killer before the trial even begins, I'm just saying if killers get to see Survivior ranks, then there's no reason Surviviors shouldn't get to see killer ranks.
---
Ok and if you have the hatch closed on you 9/10 you‚Äôre not getting out anyway
---
It was a close one!
---
Same, really wanna play killer but that fucking matchmaking discourages me
---
It isn't 1/3rd. You still have to win two chases, so it's 2/3rd. I'd argue a competent four man SWF with full meta builds is stronger than an ebony mori. My swf beats ebonies almost every time we play them.
---
Your such a fucking douche bag, i get that your bad at the game you will never get better if you keep doing that
---
I like to listen to some Daft Punk, really love getting an average of ten minutes to psyche myself up while survivors and SWFs especially just hop into matches
---
/s
---
Refering to Freddy. he was removed from the game, and then they added a new killer by the same name and model
---
Constantly me, I literally only focus on finding a pallet or a good loop and sometimes, other survivors can be in close proximity. I take no responsibility if the killer is to switch attention to the other survivor.
---
At least it's good for haunted grounds.
---
**FUCKING MOOD**
---
ITS SO TRUE I WANNA DIE oMFg
---
What a loser lmao
---
I love revving the living shit out of my chainsaw right infront of their face and their team can't do anything to stop me. They suffer the consequences.
---
Eh to each their own. It's a way of playing I guess, I just find it boring.
---
I prefer outsmarting my opponents with intense mindgames. But that's me.
---
Pretty sure this is a rage post from a survivor mad that it happened to them. At least that's what I hope it is.
---
Real fake website my ass. Never googled something so hard in my life. I done got *bamboozled*
---
Wanna play with me and my dude? E are survivors  need 2
---
More often than not, killer mains face camp survivors because they dared to loop. Killer mains consider looping as toxic. Who would have thought, merely trying to survive is toxic.
---
Only a minority of face camping I see is actually deserved (tea bagging, pointing, moonwalking at every pallet and so on).
---
I would just try to rat them out BC if they are this immersed, they're probably garbage at looping.
---
Be a dick back and use up all the pallets.
---
If you plan on playing them immediately after you prestige them then yes it's worth it. Gets you more perks so hopefully you aren't stuck with really bad builds.
---
What's worse is I literally cannot do survivor. I'm a dumb panicky animal when I play survivor, and I want to be a P3 doctor main but n OPE. 
---
My record matchmaking times are 32 minutes killer, and 15 minute survivor. I can't get better if I can't even find a game
---
Lead the killer to him.

Ok so, if I read this right, you hooked one person, the other three rushed in before you had a chance to leave, correct?  
---
And doing what anyone would've done to take advantage of 4 easy downs (taking note of the killer you played) you sawed all of them down and they dc'ed one after the other?
---
Nope. I just revved the living shit out of a survivor that decided to loop me for a while, let's say 2 minutes on the same loop. So i took it upon myself to place them on a hook and stand infront of their wiggling sack of shit body as I revved the living shit out of my chainsaw for maximum tilt on their end due to 0 possibility of escape.
---
I thought this was going to be a post about the way David's looking at Nea lol. Yes I'd get 1 million before you prestige and use up any point boosts or items.

On what

LOL dude, this is epic. That Nea did not approve! And you just had pick poor Dwight!

I prefer my standard method of chase and hit with stick but you‚Äôre probably a little more successful

Lol yeah an unlucky true survivor

I rarely play solo but if I do I have all 5 totems out in less than three minutes, without fail. Assuming no one else has done any which then it's even less time. The spawns are obvious on every map.

all good except lunge range is a no go nor is blinds or stuns as they need to be universal for clarity.
---
"Baby survivors" Dude they have iridescent add ons and items and full perk loadouts
---
Same but there are times I‚Äôll get the salty messages of trash and anger.
---
Well, they are going to find you relatively quickly anyway. But it gives another starting objective for the players, it doesn‚Äôt set the killer back nearly at all, and it gives a better reason to hit up the basement for survivors, giving killers a chance to nab them.
---
I just ignore them and mostly ignore the gens. I consider it a wash and start running around looking for ways to snag BP. Probably going to lose anyway (tbh even if the teammate was doing objectives, chances are still fairly low) so might as well grab some BP/practice looping.
---
Id actually put ghost face in a higher tier, as revealing him is difficult, even to high ranks
---
if you use that weird logic you can say that about several killers who have had their powers reworked.
---
I think your friend distracting the killer is doing something more important than you. Besides, at the current repair speed you don't need tool boxes or any repair speed increaser.
---
I hate when I'm running from a leatherface and the other 3 are charging right for me.
---
Except any survivor with a brain doesn't die like a helpless bitch. They recognise that the killer is wasting their time, and the other survivors leave. If that survivor is me I don't struggle and waste as much of your time as possible. Nice that you assume they're tilted though, when in reality they're probably laughing at you.
---
Lead the killer to him, find him and make noise so the killer knows where you are.
---
They die laughing at you, knowing their team will get out. Gg enjoy the depip baby killer.
---
Yo thats a Porta potty
---
Not sure. It shouldnt be internet if im host right? The game just sorta stops for a second, so i assume its my pc bugging out. Just not sure which part i need to fix
---
Wait, is there a rule that says not to disconnect?
---
Hillbilly? you are supposed to do that with Leatherface, Billy has to run free.
---
Same I try to save but sometimes it‚Äôs just not in the cards for them.

m^e^h

looks amazing

But do you know the chance that the anticheat system will ban me if I use these because I don't want all the money I spent on this game to go to waste.

I‚Äôm glad your team was useful while you bought them time.

I had a game earlier tonight where I managed to run the killer for a good stretch of time, and no one else on the team did a damn thing. When I finally got downed they were all crouching in different corners of the map.

For fuck‚Äôs sake...

Beautiful. I‚Äôm still planning mine out.

---
Yeah fair enough better for sneaking I agree
---
Because people feel the need to berate you on a win. If you downed somebody and left them there to patrol and wait for an altruist to show up, theyd call you that. If you hook and stay nearby theyll call you a camper. Ignore it. Camping nets you 1-2 kills on average but until you get better take those easy kills and move on.
---
I was thinking that too with the snares I mean I'm not gonna lie I like to get points easy but not that easy lol
---
Slug and face camping are two different things so I dont know why hes saying them together to you, but slugging is leaving people downed and not hanging them, face camping is where you camp the hook, although a literal face camp is when you stand at the hook as opposed to really close by. Also rank 20 is new so the person's an idiot dude you probably played fine you're just learning the game.
---
I can just feel my eye being itchy because of this lol
---
Yeah I get that lol I want to face her more because I love her design.

I am pretty sure it's more than 1.2 million from lvl 1 to 50

---
It's a Diatech exclusive. 
---
I assume he gave codes to his friends and some viewers but I don't think there any codes left for it, and it's not part of the charity case.
---
Unless the killer is Nurse or Spirit they're probably not getting a hook for multiple gens so I really don't sweat it actually. And I haven't seen a Nurse or Spirit running NOED for months.
---
Teammates helping by sitting in the gate doing fuck all and denying you the hatch.
---
On topic I always love these sorts of clips but also always feel a strange sense of disappointment in the Leatherface player. Like I don't play Leatherface and I certainly don't camp, but how bad do you have to be to fail at camping as Leatherface?
---
I always wanted him to be completely invisible from a distance and only within 16 meters you can see him while he is cloaked
---
I thought it was weird that you felt you had to prove yourself until I saw how eerily similar these posts were
---
Yesterday, I got tunnel because I used a flashlight and blinded while killer was breaking pallets
---
Yeah I think it's more, I have done the 1 mil and then buy one already owned perk, and still needs more.
---
I leave if any of my survs have less than 1000 hours so
---
Totem counter should be baseline.
---
You should have had a lot more to spend after the tally screen.

Post game no longer shows the effects of bloodpoint offerings don‚Äôt worry you still got the points

---
I‚Äôve been trying it out, and of the 4 games with it, I‚Äôve been 1 &amp; 2 hooked in every one. Further testing is required :(
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs basically how you can where the survivor is on the gen and in a chase, that could work!
---
You really play this game at rank 18 with your "rank 18" swf buddies don't you? 
---
What killer doesn't get hooks for multiple gens, when one survivor being chased, another one getting totems, third one urban evading around map doing nothing, 4th one opening chest and also searching for ruin? 
---
And as I said, if no one is getting hooked, means pallets are melting away fast, so later in a game it will be a problem.
---
I'm not alone it seems- hell I tried using a headset and even then it didn't help- if anything I became way more confused at to where someone might be.
---
There‚Äôs also no reason to do totems other than off chance that the killer has noed. If the killer is playing poorly, and I think he‚Äôs a player that relies on noed for kills, I will go and do totems but one person in solo cannot know how many totems have already been cleansed.
---
3.5 kills, roughly 25k BP before BBQ per match. 897 hours played.
---
Survivors complaining about NOED is ridiculous, they don't seem to have any problem with a Plague with play with your food stacks. yet they cry when they see NOED at the end of the game.
---
I'm sure Mario bitches about NOED all the time.
---
I absolutely do not think ebony mori's should be strong, because as long as there is shit that players (on either side) can use that give a giant middle finger to game balance people are going to DC when they see them. At the end of the day, this is a hobby, not a job. Nobody is being paid to sit through DBD matches, they're doing it for fun. It's not fun when you find out on the loading screen the other side said "fuck your fun I'm playing this match on ez mode good luck."
---
I would just head on out and insta-hook myself the moment I realized you would camp me
---
Nothing salty, just don‚Äôt wanna be camped, so I‚Äôll give you your bloodpoints (which you earned, considering I‚Äôm on the hook) and find another match to play, nothin bad bout that.
---
Best part? You have a reason to hunt down the rude players now! Nothing can hold you back but your own faults and the game‚Äôs lag!
---
Should be on the shitpost flair I think
---
That happens to me all the time even though im at rank 2. Makes me wonder how the heck they got here.
---
No this is lore this is how the killer does her hair. 
---
(I may have clicked the wrong one)
---
hey good job man. Im hoping you safetied at least.
---
regarding licensed killers the two best ones are myers and ghost face and ghost face is the easier  and one so you'll probably win more with him
---
You upset at loops or people who taunt during loops? The taunting fellows can bite me, that I agree with, but ya gotta know we have no other choice to avoid the killer as they have ways to reach survivors in a chase really fast (billy with his chainsaw, Nurse teleports, Clown tosses gas Molotov‚Äôs, Freddy fakes them out with dream snare and dream pallets, trapper traps future-chase locations, etc.)
---
Even without those, bloodlust exists, killers have a natural faster movement speed than survivors, yikes that‚Äôs problematic! There‚Äôs a lot of perks for many situations too, including this
---
Bamboozle
---
Being looped via windows? No problem!
---
Kate‚Äôs Window‚Äôs of Opportunity
---
Need a future loop spot and can‚Äôt find one? Behold, windows and pallets now have auras!
---
And I believe a couple others, including balanced landing.
---
That's what I was thinking
---
*plauge
---
Green medkits give you two full heals because it is 24 charges (12 each). I should know i run pharmacy.
---
MAybe the person getting chased 95% a gen
---
Ha! Thinking the dev's will actually do something to help the game. You're really funny, you know that?
---
Easy doesnt mean better though. Michael is pretty easy and exposes everyone
---
Improveize?
---
By that logic it‚Äôs also ok to taunt the heavens out of the killer since the pallet can be broken, and if it isn‚Äôt a pallet causing the problem just put on bamboozle or play the best mindgames you can.
---
You aren‚Äôt supposed to get a kill every match, just like you aren‚Äôt supposed to survive every match
---
Ya dig, man?
---
Omg
---
Lmfao
---
Hes gotta stay awake somehow
---
Every game
---
He doesn‚Äôt look like a druggie in that pic tho
---
The level you get to also depends on how cheap the webs are, like how many good eats you can get or the prices of things you are having to purchase.
---
Im sorry that happened to you OP.
---
or make the gen requirement dynamic
---
have rank items and addons have point values 
---
then adjust how gens need to be done
---
ok
---
there should be mechanic's to help change up gameplay. As the game has progressed, there are literally hundreds of variables people got to look out for, among both the killer and other survivors in wondering what they have and are using, a lot of it can be really effective and we are at a point where one mistake can literally cost you the game if you play perfectly into the killer or the survivors build. An Ebony Mori isn't the only thing capable of this, throw it on an omega blink Nurse with decent perks and the mori would be the least broken thing there. Go up against 1-2 insta heals and perks/toolboxes for rushing gens and see how fast gens can really get done before you even make it to the other side of the map. See how often a survivor can get back up and how much you have to hit them with perks like Deliverance, Unbreakable, DS, adrenaline, BT, etc. in play. See how fun it is to get pulled off a gen with literally ZERO warning and put on a hook against prayer beads spirit, hell if you don't like not playing after your first down similar to Mori's how about getting facecamped in the basement where your only options are to watch your team fall apart trying to save you and lose, sit there and watch your team leave while you lose, or just kill yourself and take the loss faster.
---
if you don't want anything strong, all I'm saying is LOTS of stuff needs to be removed from this game. Whether or not they are too strong or work well in the game balance is something else entirely. Mori's are ingrained in the game and have always been since launch, it is tied to several achievements and 3 offerings, it is 1 of the more exciting reveals for any killer, it is incorporated in several perks and 1 killer's add-ons. Neutering 1 of the primary methods of using them to uselessness should not be the way to go.

My thought on changing them is to keep them effective but not completely deny people from playing. A game can still last a decent amount of time before each person gets hooked, it can still be winnable (hell matches are still winnable against Ebony's if the team is excellent), and I agree it CAN be unfun to go against 1 and be the first to die to it 3 minutes into a match.
---
The worst way to change something is make it fucking useless because that just shows you can't do game balance or don't want to do it and want the game neutered to a worse state.
---
Ahh, I was wondering as well
---
Cool effect but why light it on fire
---
Not to mention the existence of Bamboozle for window looping and the fact you can destroy pallets, which means the survivors permanently lose a pallet they could use later
---
Hell, trapper can trap the used pallet instead of break it if he forces the survivor to flee the area so that he can punish more effectively
---
he can even trap it in right in front of the survivor to force them to leave, whether it‚Äôs been used or not ‚Äúoh shit he trapped it, I can‚Äôt use it now! I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!‚Äù
---
Works for me, tbh.
---
‚ÄúOh, but another survivor will just remove the trap‚Äù
---
Ok, whatever, I can set it up again or I can take it with me and force the pallet to be used if I think my trap will be deactivated, easy solution.
---
‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not trapper!‚Äù
---
Make them use the pallet. MAKE them use the pallet. I‚Äôve said it before I‚Äôll say it again. You get stunned? So what, just destroy the pallet so they don‚Äôt have that option next time they roll through that area.
---
One would hope that would be the case, but if the player doesn't hit any great skill checks, the Med-Kit will be depleted at 99% on the second heal.
---
I'm also an avid user of Pharmacy, and I know that for myself, but you can also view how lame this is in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjWLd5D5mqE) where this is tested while no great skill checks occur.
---
No you can‚Äôt
---
fire
---
You know what? you do you my friendly pyromaniac amigo
---
Did he have a pallet he could drop in the loop? If he did, just force him to use it and take the stun. He can‚Äôt keep looping you once that pallet is gone unless you... just aren‚Äôt good enough... this isn‚Äôt an insult but a legitimate statement...
---
Thanks for letting me know. At least now I know I'm just sucking terribly
---
Same same
---
E x a c t l y
---
ah shit you're right man, gotta change it back now
---
Thats all he played all game i saved someone earlier from the hook and he was camping it. Then he ended up catching someone else and putting them in the basement me and the two teammates pretty much let him die and finished 4 gens because we knew he was camping him thats why one person died
---
That's rewarding people for sticking around even after having bad teammates
---
I just hate how he sounds like a Tusken Raider. Mf is going RORORURFHFHUG

Heres a recording we took of his Vod before he took it down if you want to see somebody rage very hard.
---
Dcing as a whole is going to be looked at once dedicated servers are implemented fully. Currently the devs can‚Äôt tell if its a manual disconnect or some server/internet issues so they can‚Äôt roll out punishments without punishing innocents. However once the servers are going they will be able to tell which is which and punish those who leave a lot. Short term answer is not much but long term leavers on both sides will start getting punished, I presume something like temporary bans that get longer each time you dc
---
Wht
---
karma whore
---
This game has way more support from the devs compared to a lot of other games -cough Ubisoft-
---
You don't. You miss out on points for any additional stage of sacrifice remaining plus them dying on the hook.
---
Gasp
---
He's not telling the truth. You miss out on points for any additional stage of sacrifice remaining plus them dying on the hook, if you let the Entity take them.
---
I always feel bad after rank resets. You never know when you might be putting a newer player off the game by absolutely dominating them
---
You'd get just as much distance from the killer if you ran off, as opposed to stopping to flashlight them, so it is pretty obnoxious to do
---
Wait really you can‚Äôt? I thought you were able to
---
The hero we need but don‚Äôt deserve
---
I had a match like that today. Four rank 20's disconnected on me. All four of them did it as soon as the entity got them. Sore ass losers.
---
If a survivor disconnects, each dc should be worth as many blood points as a full sacrifice
---
Spine Chill gang rise up
---
just, oof

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/anq365/pig_rbt_stats_part_2/erbvmnf/?st=jywkujut&amp;sh=d2aeba3a
---
Supposedly it was recently re-tested 1 month ago with similar results. I don't know if it's murphy's law because the statistics supposedly DO point to "50% chance each box". I don't think McLean would lie about it though.
---
I need this voice actor

I thought so.

Disconnect by Daylight. If the killer is doing well, survivors that think you should let them win will dc on you
---
So, he's the reptile guy from Identity V?
---
I still don't get it
---
Exactly
---
WishMaster. He grants wishes. 
---
Do you wish to change places with another survivor when chased or downed? Do you wish you were fully healed? Do you wish you could have (insert item here) from the chest you are opening? Do you wish to hide your aura for 60 seconds?
---
After 3 wishes he can down any survivors that used a wish in one hit for the rest of the match. If a single survivor uses 3 wishes only they can be mori'd even without being hooked. If a single survivor uses 2 wishes then let their aura be shown at all times as a way to discourage multiple wishes per survivor. If they use one wish let it be granted and after a cool down the killer sees their aura for 5 seconds.
---
He is trapped in a gem. The Entity could be using this game as a way to get the Djinn to do what the Entity wants with a promise to grant the Djinn's only wish, freedom from it's own prison.
---
did you just correct the original poster
---
What's wrong with noed ppl just want something to be mad about I'm a survivor main btw
---
On ps4 it‚Äôs like that for survivor (3-5 mins). I don‚Äôt get why there‚Äôs apparently less killers on ps4
---
This was from my stream (not plugging i promise) so you can see what i went through if you want. Ps I'm a bad hillbilly. Had another game with 1 rank 20 and 3 rank 1s. 4 player SWF game
---
Get used to it.... Most games will end with survivors messaging you with insults or disconnecting
---
This
---
I've always felt it should let you too, but the thing is if it did people would wait there till you went into struggle anyway so I dont think it would work most of the time you'd just get rehooked
---
Absolutely. There's problems and sometimes their priorities are curious but they are constantly  working on new content and trying their best to make it balanced.
---
What about staking the killer his entire life and study his every move until you know him so well that you can predict his movement.
---
Lol were you against like 4 megs or something
---
A as a jole, B whenever a player does that he is seem as toxic, C for a clickbaity title
---
Big lies
---
I don‚Äôt get it what is this about?
---
I was a Bubba main for awhile and he‚Äôs still a favorite of mine, but whenever I ran franklins I never had good matches.
---
Very powerfull build, but against most hillbillies looping is still an option
---
Lol that's actually pretty smart thinking
---
2 megs a dwight and bill
---
Wiggle reduction is useless I agree. The opposite is just as useless. If you can't tell I want them to buff boil over.
---
My dh only works half the time.
---
Freddy
---
bruh literally can't get mad if a killer got noed if you didn't do bones.
---
Good, surv iij vors need more nerds their supposed to be weak.
---
Who repost this but almost made way way worst than the original? Booth them lmfao
---
Okay, I saw this before going into work and it was eh.
---
I'm off work, delusional and tired and this shit is fucking hilarious.
---
She is pretty underrated overall, but as you stated, you‚Äôre new to the game and new survivors don‚Äôt know how to play against her
---
Who not only reposted this but made it way way more stupid? This is garbo lmaoo
---
You want to nerf ruin AND increase gen repair speed? Rofl
---
*excited oink noises*
---
Lmao it's like when you run the killer for more than a gens worth of time and when you get hung no ones anywhere near a gen.
---
I literally almost never see Clown in red ranks and when I see, he gets heavily gen rushed. Also, I don't see Hag too often and Freddy is more rare now that the hype died.
---
Franklins isnt how bubba should deal with flashlights. He should tunnel and camp til death. 
---
Thats what i do.
---
maturity 100
---
I tend to put traps only near gens or when no one is watching during a chase. Also when I find a totem I tend to place a trap nearby. I tend to keep near my traps also so I can get to them when needed.
---
So an actually powerful addon vs an addon that's only usable on 2 maps (since case you forgot, Myers has no lunge, no Bloodlust and moves at like 102%.)
---
Except I'm a survivor main, LMAO
---
What a fuckwit.
---
If they‚Äôre camping then yes.
---
Yeah people been doing that to me as well doesn't make sense I'm rank 5
---
Alright. I tend to be better with hag than other free (console) killers.
---
Idk about his power or perks but the tall man from Phantasm could be a neat addition and i bet licensing wouldn‚Äôt be as difficult as others
---
They leading you to pallets but never using them? Make them use them. Let yourself get stunned and destroy the pallet
---
No more fruit loops for that spot.
---
Because hag is better than most killers.
---
Alright. I might try maining both spirit and hag once I get shards from leveling up.
---
I don't like your attitude.
---
Sorry I meant im on IOS, so I don‚Äôt know how to get it
---
Yeah, spirit is pretty good if you know how to properly use her power.
---
If I wasn‚Äôt broke I would give a gold for this honestly
---
‚ÄúHah, imma pallet loop this guy to-why can‚Äôt I move?‚Äù
---
We really shouldn‚Äôt be calling hitboxes and connection issues the same thing.
---
Watch it be a buff
---
It‚Äôs best not to get our hopes up. That‚Äôs for sure.
---
It takes tracking skills for spirit, and I have tend to use scratch marks and crying survivors to continue chases, so I should be good with her hopefully. Also how long do I have to play till I can get spirit with shards?
---
Tiny brain: Blame killers for using NOED
---
Big brain: Blame the devs for making the perk and not nerfing it despite everyone saying its too strong
---
He woulda hooked ya if he just hit them the moment he could...
---
Hit survivors the second they are in your way folks.
---
Actually laughed xD
---
Haha this a good one
---
I'd love the Tall Man! They'd need to incorporate the metal spheres (sentinels) for sure!
---
They're changing add-ons. Not power itself.
---
hes okay, have to get used to his snare placement, i have not tryed the dream pallets yet, his teleport to any gen though is pretty nice.. and theres a add on perk for him that makes all Gennys bleed when im teleporting  so the fear of not knowing where ima pop up is nice
---
Mainly when I first got nea to 50 I didn‚Äôt have any unlockables and I beer grabbed perks so I‚Äôm using it as a kind of reset button now that I have ds deliverance dh sb and adrenaline
---
Joey just got cucked by GhostFace
---
It also tried to stop downloading it but never does
---
So... you should just let them die on hook because the killer is camping? Lol what? That makes no sense. Oh and thanks for the downvote.
---
I smell bullshit.
---
Nurse is a hard killer to play for starters but it's very powerful lol
---
When the killer won‚Äôt stop chasing a specific survivor, no matter what. 
---
Example of bad tunneling
---
Fresh, easy pick that‚Äôs injures on the left path within melee distance? Nah, I wanna hook THAT guy over there that I‚Äôve chased for half the match instead!
---
Example of good tunneling
---
My perk benefits me from specifically going for this guy, if I go for anyone else ill disadvantage myself!
---
Playing with my friends in a SWF all the time, we always run We'll Make It and Botany on two different loadouts. Borrowed-Time on top of that as well which helps.
---
No it is not!
---
You‚Äôs a bitch
---
the archives is free,battlepass is something else.
---
oh no using an item is the game. Cry more bitch
---
Thanks
---
Do killers actually complain about D strike? It‚Äôs a a fair perk. (Rank 4 killer btw) (rank 1 survivor)
---
yeah basically,I remember some stuff like trap someone right after they vault as trapper.
---
Good
---
Yeah true, this idea would be useless aside rank 20s that'd be kinda fun to see a bunch of dummies falling for that lmao.
---
So is it like a fighting game but every fighter(killer) has the same hitbox for their attacks but because some killers have a big weapon and some have a small one it makes it look like it shouldn‚Äôt hit you when it actually did? Like the hitbox is the same size but a cow leg taking up most of it is gonna look like a more natural hit than some Freddy claw.
---
I did because it was cool and I still play it

I realize how I made it sound, but I actually dont chase survivors all that long. If I'm not gaining any ground, I back off and go back to put pressure on the gens. I spend maybe 20-30 seconds on average in chases with the hag. Like you said, i try to rely heavily on traps but red rank survivors and swf groups get hard to trick. But hey, maybe it's just me man.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between corner of a swamp map hidden, hidden in a corner of a less used jungle gym and put in the wide open with no cover while being visible from half the map. One of those should not exist.
---
&gt;Your keen dick is sharpened in the dark realm of my ass.
---
I fucking love it
---
Hag is dogwank unless "patrol one area" not even camping but with traps and having them in one area makes her really good at locking one place down and not much use for her to go around the entire map. So your probably just campingüòè
---
Meth ruin
---
Perk that increases your TR
---
Thank you for this... CAMPING OSNT EQUIVALENT TO TEA BAGGING i would say nodding when u down them or smacking them once or twice after hooking them is equivalent
---
wow so edgy
---
youll get over this phase after puberty
---
So its just the current add-ons and parks that makes her busted?
---
Distressing, Unnerving, Overcharge, and a 4th perk, I use BBQ.
---
Nodding/teabagging is equivalent to teabagging and flashlight spamming imo. Very good post, thanks.
---
I agree in the sense a toxic survivor often times hurts themself or the team because they're not usually being helpful just annoying. A toxic killer can pick on whoever they want for no reason at all and there's legitimately no counter play.
---
Sadly a lot of people come here to lie about it. Have had a couple conversations with people here where I asked them what‚Äôs going through their head and it just sounded more and more like a tunneling proxy camper. Glad I rarely deal with that anymore but when that rank reset hits and I haven‚Äôt played in a week or two woooo it‚Äôs campin time.
---
This is so true.
---
Distressing of course, Brutal Strength, Bamboozle, Devour Hope.
---
Does she have counterplay?
---
As long as you haven't already spent any of your shards you should have 9,110 of them at level 46 which is just over the amount needed to get an original character for free
---
Lol pretty spot on
---
I could give you their reddit or steam account. They got alot more codes.
---
Welcome to r/platinumuserclub my man! Happy to have you here
---
The thing is that cleansing totems takes up precious time for survivors to get gens. Plus you're cleansing for a guess that the killer has noed whereas a killer knows if someone has DS if there's an obsession. I think noed should be made so that you have to get 4-5 hooks before endgame so it can negate the earned vs not earned argument.
---
I mean face camping is too good a strategy tbh, I dunno how they‚Äôll ever make it less viable. You get a hook with- Wait why haven‚Äôt i seen any Michael Myers campers? It seems like it would be pretty effective. I dislike camping though, Easiest way to de-rank when you get a tunneling killer
---
A+++ content. Good work man
---
r/bhvrRoastedHimGood
---
You forgot the /s there bud.
---
Well , you can trick her miss her blink or when she blinks towards you , try to run into her because she can't stop a blink
---
I guess you could say that they see...eye to eye!
---
alright illiterate
---
Distress, ruin, BBQ, UP
---
You maybe hella laggy, when a game is just unplayable do to the lag, theres not much to do but just let the killer kill me. Hopefully the dedicated servers come soon
---
I mean that's just their opinion.
---
Sounds really interesting! I must watch a YouTube video highlighting the changes and I haven‚Äôt even seen ghostface or his abilities.
---
honestly didn't know that, i'll research it though. i support your view point
---
Is it sad that this is true lol
---
I have also tried to end it through task manager but when i start steam back up no matter how fast i am, it instantly starts downloading again
---
I'll take 20....no actually i'll buy your whole stock!
---
Some people use an icon pack designed by a nice person who created better looking icons than the default in game, you modify the in-game icons so you have a better looking experience. If that makes sense.
---
Yup pretty much. It's a necessary evil to make sure the killers all attack the same way.
---
I swear yesterday was the worst.  Was playing rank 1 and so many toxic swf groups with 3x to 4x instaheals, shitton of keys, tbags, dstrikes etc. You name it.
---
It means that it doesn't cost you anything to stream it. Spotify has a free tier and you can listen to it.
---
you mean we arent allowed to hit Leave Match if we want? why did they give us that option
---
Agreed, I hope it's on their agenda since they also fixed some characters hair
---
nah, you're giving them too much credit with that
---
–º—î–Ω
---
Find the part in any lore that confirms the sexuality of any characters.
---
I agree with you. It's unfair to escape with 5 or 4 gens left, it's a free escape. They should let the hatch open only when there are 3 or less gen left, otherwise the endgame timer should start as soon as the third survivor is sacrificed. The fourth can still open the gates.
---
The locker strategy is very cool, I had never thought of that!
---
I found that I was getting slugged so much that I switched DS out for Unbreakable. I find that I pick myself off the floor once every other match.
---
alright good to know thank you
---
10/10
---
Second perk is wayyyy too overtuned
---
wdym?
---
Survivor t-bag and people on this subreddit are like: FACECAMP THIS TOXIC RETARD CUNT AND GIVE HIM WHATEVER HE DESERVES!!
---
Killer camps and tunnel and people on this subreddit are like: well, was it a swf? Did he accidentally pressed ctrl at least one time during the match? Did he use his flashlight for more than 1 time during the match? Did he waited at the exit gate when they were already open for more than 1.3 seconds? Did he use an insta-heal or a perk slightly better than calm spirit? Did he gen rushed? Because if he did just one of these things this was completely deserved!
---
I understand it isn‚Äôt easy to fix all the shit of this game and I do believe they‚Äôre actively working on improving the game, but I can‚Äôt understand that they can‚Äôt even address the console issues we experience
---
Damn. Safe mode?
---
How do you know they're straight? Curious to know if you have that UnLocked Lore(tm)
---
what‚Äôs safe mode
---
Yeah but imagine if the killer was farming and then it'd look like there would be 5 survivors XD
---
Probably the answer to your sanity lol. You can boot the pc up in safe mode and basically be supreme ruler of the inside working of your pc. I would research before you do it so you don't mess it up and only follow the directions of how to close or uninstall a program while in safe mode.
---
People still get upset about shipping? What is this 2012? Are we going back to hating on anyone who likes supernatural? Are we heading back to when cringe culture was swagtastic lmao
---
It should call forth a literal horse to come charging out of thin air and keep hitting the killer.  You know you'd run that shit.
---
I love those moments when a ghostface looks at me from across the pallet and t-bags and I do it with him so we have a brief moment of fun stupidity. I think what really cemented our friendship was him shoving his knife into my back 30 seconds later
---
Why am I like that?
---
Okay i will try that, thank you so much
---
I‚Äôve had the same issue, it reappeared after about twelve hours.
---
Most welcome
---
Death is not an escape
---
Lmao see if that happened in a real game I woudnt care, when it happened to me it was a Michael and a pig who destroyed 2 people quick before we all disconnected lol
---
How do you achieve this in game
---
Im a killer main and I conpletely disagree, this is survivor only way to escape
---
I can't be responsible for all 5 as a solo. I also don't want to run a shit perk to counter a stupid mechanic. It's like saying you have lightborn so insta blind is okay.
---
*imagine complaining about current DS*
---
&gt; I may stall him for 20 sec but he downs me and hooks me again.
---
Thats more like a you problem cause you couldn't extend chase for more than one pallet. Not saying the farmer is not wrong but BT is more than enough if you know what you're doing as survivor
---
A smart killer would get the person with borrowed time that‚Äôs just unlucky that you get someone that typical wants to tunnel you maybe you‚Äôre a really good runner and he see‚Äôs you as a threat.
---
Because Noed is more frequent duh. Never seen a pwyf plague.
---
She did fantastic job with that Ghost Face costume, I'm sure it pefectly fits her!
---
The thing is it doesn't matter if people ship trapper and Kate because their fictional, it doesn't matter if someone wants to see dwight and David get down in dirty in the fog because there is zero lore on the sexualities of the characters for all we know they could be gay as can be but that's not something we see in game can you dig it. Either way shipping is harmless and not worth complaining about
---
As for noob3 kissing monto it's weird I'll give you that one but only because their real people.
---
but homer man not fan girl dumdum
---
You sound pretty homophobic. Why aren‚Äòt people allowed to fantasize and draw whatever they like? There‚Äòs no bit that indicates any of the character‚Äòs sexual orientation, it‚Äòs up for imagination.
---
Bold of you to assume they're straight by default. If fans want to run with their own headcanons and ship them off, let them. It's harmless. At the end of the day, we're all here out of love for the game.
---
Oh shit, the gen now takes what, 4 seconds longer?
---
No, it doesn‚Äòt take any slots. You can have all the perks but you can only take 4 to your match.
---
Fantasize what you want to Fantasize about idc. But when you get aggressive on social media over who is a better ship. That‚Äôs just weird, these people are trying to fight for their lives üòÇ. People out here thinking of them getting down on the lockers.
---
Your perk inventory has no limit, if I'm understanding this correctly.
---
*Laughs in no mither*
---
LOL word dude I get that
---
And then they call you camper
---
It shouldn‚Äôt de-pip you. I‚Äôm a rank 1 survivor and the killer dc‚Äôd so it temporarily brought me back to rank 2. But once I got back to the main menu it returned me back to rank 1.
---
If you mean the place where all your purchased perks go to be equipped, it has no limit. When you fill one page, newly purchased perks will just go onto the next. You should never skip getting a perk off the bloodweb for this reason.
---
If they do, they're just as stupid as the Survivors complaining about something entirely in their hands.
---
Freddy was a low tier killer and they fixed him, the same can happen with Bubba since he's pretty low tier.
---
That looks so cool!
---
These are two separate issues in two different ranks I‚Äôve found out. In tier 1-5, about a quarter of the survivors teabag and flashlight spam, whilst doing nothing and setting their team back for the meme. In rank 20-15 you get facecamping killers, and I rarely see them past 10 if ever. It‚Äôs not an effective way to up-pip. Don‚Äôt want to deal with as many toxic survivors, stay in lower ranks, don‚Äôt want to deal with face camping as a survivor, get to higher ranks. I‚Äôd say BHVR should do something, but realistically what can you do? There‚Äôs shitlords everywhere.
---
I suppose, but it took a very long time for that change to happen. Aside from that, how would they change him? Not much they can do with a chainsaw.
---
What did I just witness
---
It's perfect. I had a good laugh. +1
---
Like any good nurse needs add-ons to fuck shit up
---
Yeah im trying to work it out to
---
I'm not sure how to do it anymore (Since I believe the old way got patched), but it **Will** get you banned if people report you for it.
---
Ok thanks for the help!
---
Trapper vs Ghostface? CRIPPLE FIGHT
---
Ngl it took me a hot minute to find her, I only saw two survivors on the gen for the longest
---
The world may never know
---
If you get facecamped or tunneled you get to leave the game right away though and move on. If you're a killer going against a particularly frustrating group you have to sit and endure the entire time all the way to the end.
---
I tried to change the lighting in the picture but this game is so dark.
---
I agree! No idea what they would even change. Not much to do with his chainsaw that Billy doesn't cover already.
---
Rip Bubba

Powerful=/=broken. Prayer beads has no counterplay.

The pic in the thread is exactly the same as it is in Ghostface's power in game.

I guess you're trying to imply that, since Fun World advertises this costume, DBD could use it.
---
However, I believe this is just the mask and knife. The combination of the mask and black cloak is owned by Dimension.
---
Same. There‚Äôs actually a lot of possibilities for what they could rework her power to be.
---
Hell no. I‚Äôm trying to help people but not showing it. If you want to find it head into Twitter.
---
Much like adrenaline.
---
Or DS with an open gate.
---
Or OoO on a stealth killer.
---
Or an instaheal.
---
The problem is, that as a solo survivor it's very difficult and time-consuming to make sure all totems are done. You would literally have to find all 5 totems (either cleanse them or see the already destroyed totem) without knowing how many of your teammates are doing the exact same thing. And if you don't find only one totem, all the effort is wasted (even detrimental as the NOED totem is now going to be a well hidden one). Until they add a totem counter/some change that rewards cleansing some totems without finding all of them, totem cleansing is really only a viable option for SWF in most cases.
---
Thank you i will also try this lol
---
Killers can leave too lmao
---
if you truly want to help people, you would've showed it üòî
---
So was Freddy.
---
Sure you can. Let go and move on to the next game. The Entity wills it.
---
Have it where it will only jump to second totem if its destroyed within 2 minutes of the game
---
I saw it and I will never see it again.
---
The main difference you're forgetting is that camping and tunneling are signs of a Killer who is new and doesn't know any better, where as T-bagging and flashlight spamming is something you have to choose to engage in.
---
Camping is a way to secure a kill (Yay) that shoots yourself in the foot if the other Survivors realize to work the gens (Boo). There is literally no reason to t-bag the Killer; You're either wasting time when you could be running with a speed boost, or you're wasting time after the pallet dropped.
---
In the story he was blamed for it yes. However the license holder to jeepers creepers is a pedophile. You should research before commenting or feel free and continue being scum and promoting child rape.
---
Its the same pose as the power
---
Tbh I would've done the same, and I've never dced,it's an oath I made to myself but that would break it
---
I wish a fucking Evolve: Battlegrounds would come out to give the original game some more love and maybe get the servers back up? I legitimately believe that the game is Titanfall 2 level, it was amazing.
---
You can't grab people out of the hatch anymore.
---
That's valid
---
I submitted one yesterday too. They said they are currently investigating and that they'd also check my account to make sure nothing's causing it.
---
More like watching that annoying, lazy survivor who did nothing but loop the killer in your direction, and blow skill checks causing you to get killed and STILL manages to find the hatch and escape...
---
You said Jeepers Creepers as a character is a pedophile. Not the license holder.
---
Great nurse gameplay! I enjoyed watching it
---
Really? Since when?
---
if only that was true at red ranks killer, if you are too efficient in your chases and kill three people too quickly and last one gets hatch you will actually often depip if you dont purposely let chases go for longer, so im not sure its a healthy game mechanic when killers have to cripple themselves to make games last longer or depip.
---
They are very good together, as soon as you pick up a survivor take a look around for a quick sec, any generators that are red are where survivors are, give great location knowledge, also surveillance and disruption i believe, legions perk is also great, really shows you which areas to go to for survivors.
---
Bro you‚Äôre over reaching here  and frankly grasping at straws, OP used 2 examples one of them happened to be 2 male survivors being shipped but also mentioned Kate and trapper.
---
You‚Äôre not helping homophobia by over reaching
---
What killer was it? (Asking because I'm afraid if it was me)
---
Does it matter? It is still from his mind and anything associated with jeepers is still associated with him. All it takes is a google search to learn what is meant. Maybe there is a language barrier with me getting the info out? You should be knowledgable of anything you are discussing so research then come back.
---
Yeah I just checked to see if that‚Äôs what it was, but they really aren‚Äôt insanely similar, it‚Äôs just ghosty holding a knife in both of them, knife angles, position, and head tilt are different in them lmao
---
Heals 3 states so you can revive mori'd survivors.
---
Reddit makes me feel good about being a Meg main who can actually hit a skill check lol
---
Maybe it‚Äôs really hard to see out of her pig mask? Or Amanda really needs a pair of glasses..?
---
Do you have any ideas? I always draw a blank but always interested in hearing them.
---
I don‚Äôt get it JUSSSST leave the game LAWWLLL 4Head
---
im you but stronger
---
Screenshots are a thing.
---
I‚Äôm starting to see an uptick of nurse players on PS4! Makes me happy more people are bothering to learn killers despite ‚Äúmuh mouse n keyboard‚Äù making it easier. I hear framerate is an issue for her too though.
---
You dont understand what I am saying. When dedicated servers are released killer is going to be unplayable. The game is coded around the killer having 0 ping. When the killer doesnt, they teleport around and the game is unplayable. If you want to test this yourself get a friend to invite you to a kyf lobby and have thee survivor host the game while you play killer.
---
Just some concepts, I guess. With Freddy, they kept the theme true to his character. Now I‚Äôm not sure how true this is, but I‚Äôm fairly sure that the Nurse ‚Äúsucked‚Äù out her victim‚Äôs souls. Maybe they could rework her around that. Have her suck out part of the soul of the survivors to power her up and give her access to other abilities. This would injure the survivor just like the Plague. She would keep her blink, as well as have additional abilities but every use depleted her energy so she has to absorb again.
---
It‚Äôs too RNG dependent and 9/10 times it gets cleansed within the first minute of the game, hence making it a wasted a perk slot, At least with this rework it‚Äôs more than just a 30 second stall perk and actually adds something for the survivors to do other than sitting on gens or doing chases.
---
play dead hard and not we‚Äòre gonna live forever
---
That's why you never take the chance and kill everyone. Unless it's during rank reset
---
cant wait for the spirit and billy nerf too, lets just make deranking the killer meta since nothing will be viable at red ranks
---
Spine chill is better than premonition and that's a fact
---
Okay you know dam well that I'm not gonna waste one perk slot just for noed that the killer might not even have
---
Jesus. I was only stating what actually happened. Maybe you should take a break from Reddit. Your anger isn‚Äôt good for you.
---

You are saying it is fine when it isn't. It has everything to do with the franchise because it is associated with him. Go hang with Harvey Weinstein
---
They have announced a few months ago that their goal is 60 FPS on consoles and that they have a dedicated team of a few people working on optimization only. With each patch the performance gets a bit better. I play on PS4 Pro as well and it depends on the map, killer etc. but it's a lot smoother now than a few months ago.
---
Here's the forum post: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49456/optimization-status-update-road-to-60fps/
---
Counterplay to adrenaline is to kill them before they finish the gens. It's a reward for finishing the objective.
---
Counterplay to DS is simply to hit the unhooker, not the one being unhooked. Smart killers go for trading hooks rather than trying to secure that ONE kill.   
---
OoO isn't about counterplay I'd argue. It only works if the person using it is a decent looper. As a killer you also get free information about where the survivor is constantly.
---
But yeah, instaheal has no counterplay, unless you happen to have franklin's and even then... I totally agree on this one.
---
Oh wow. Why was I using an item that devs made to be used. I'm cancer
---
Wait is that odd bulb  p u r p l e
---
i remember the first time i learned you could sabotage hooks i hit every hook on the map without knowing they respawned
---
Spine Chill is incredible against a Spirit WITHOUT prayer beads too. You can actually tell if she's phasing or not in a chase if you have Spine Chill since if it's her husk looking at you it doesn't activate. I don't use it either to be honest but it is underrated.
---
ITS B U R P L E NOW
---
He can use whatever he likes.
---
Since End Game Collapse.
---
Killers got the ability to close the hatch when it opens up (though it can still be re-opened by a key) and the ability to open the doors when they are already powered. This is on top of the fact that any Survivor still in the map after a couple of minutes when EDC triggers automatically get sacrificed. Survivors can no longer get grabbed out of the Hatch, and the Hatch always spawns for the last Survivor.
---
Pig got massively nerfed to the point where her Traps no longer prevent people from leaving the Trial unless they were already on when EGC triggered. This means that any trap not used prior to the last gen was completed is completely wasted.
---
Happens to me all the time my dude üòÇ

Doctor I'd probably say has the highest skill ceiling, but he's just not as good as a Nurse.
---
You legitimately have to juggle Treatment and Punishment modes and even a split second too late to swap between one or the other means the Survivor gets away.
---
1mill got me to lvl 39 should 500k be enough to get me to 50?
---
Well they are at crap ranks...
---
That is a pretty fucking hefty counterplay requirement my dude. Especially for a point at the game when the killer is weakest.
---
See now heres a dilema. If you're doing the dreaded camping and getting two hits in before the saviour can run away, all good, but what if you're NOT camping? Guess thats just on me then isnt it? Also, multipke ds's.
---
No see, OoO on a solo survivor aint that bad, hell Id almost say its a benefit. Problem is 90% of the time its ran with SWF. And a OoO in a swf is akin to all survivors having every single aura reading perk in the game. Active all the time. ESPECIALLY against stealth killers.
---
Oh we're allowed to use perks to counter addons? Cuz I was avoiding it cuz OP mentioned how much they dont like spinechill.
---
But yeah for prayer beads just use spine chill.
---
Imagine how counterable a killer who appears as other survivors would be though. They'd have to show up using Bond in order to fool anyone (otherwise you'd know the very moment you saw them that they weren't a survivor).
---
I assume they'd have some other kind of detection-immunity like EW1 Myers does (Spine Chill not going off, etc), but Bond would totally ruin their disguise against survivors with a clue, since they could agree to all run Bond and require injured survivors to do the approaching, rather than vice versa, just in lobby chat.
---
Still they left almost immediately after I hooked one guy
---
You clearly just stole the if its glows it goes post  but changed the words around a bit so that people wouldn't blame you for reposting.
---
Probably but wraiths are more likely to camp than a Bubba
---
Thanks!
---
Huntress
---
She definetly is nowhere near as good on console as on pc. Still fun tho.
---
Yeah but 3 of these guys aren‚Äôt even level 10 yet and probably don‚Äôt know how to play well. Your killer type might‚Äôve scared them off lol
---
Huntress, Spirit, Clown.
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
What? She is still very strong without ads-one and if you are good enough then you can even do well without perks
---
Only complain about DS I have personally is that it doesn't wear off faster if person is rescued safely/healed/was enough time outside of terror radios. Only times DS works on me is when I run at a rescued person after hooking somebody on another side of the map or catching him on the gen. I.e. when I don't tunnel their ass.
---
As long as I earn bloodpoints I call it a win. I don't need to survive or get a 4k
---
60k bloodpoints is hard to say no to lol
---
Then take a shower and open a window.
---
This post has nothing to do with perks and he just started playing as David so wglf is a good perk to get a few extra BP for leveling.
---
Hah, wow that‚Äôs great.
---
It's really not hard to just immerse when NOED is in play, however. Only the dude who popped the last generator is probably going to get fucked.
---
Even then if you've left several strong pallets, especially the shack pallet, up during the match then they can get away.
---
Just wait to open a gate until the killer leaves, since they'll be patrolling between the two.
---
Accept that sometimes a perk is going to down you when you didn't make a mistake, just like a perk will save a survivor who fucked up and got caught.
---
Borrowed Time saves people when the rescuer leads the killer back to the hook, or sets off Hag traps.
---
Adrenaline saves people who went down, or would be caught when pulled off the hook without it due to the movement speed boost.
---
Decisive Strike saves people who can't stay up for sixty seconds, etc.
---
Killers bring it to give themselves an advantage, it may seem crutch, but games go by so fast if the survivors aren't pausing to do totems.
---
I had that moment in Lery's institute a few nights ago, with Amanda as well. I've managed to stay stealthy for a good part of the game and when I crouched around a corner, Amanda came from the other side. We both stood still for two seconds, equally shocked there was someone.
---
On the other hand, if you're hypothetically camping and still get a 4K, you weren't camping for the sake of camping.
---
You were camping because the survivors were rushing the hook.
---
Otherwise all five gens would pop before the first survivor died and those other three survivors would escape, every single time.
---
I think I was in green ranks when I got flamed for using Noed on him even though I didn't have ruin.
---
What does swf mean?
---
No? I was just helping someone else understand it.
---
Some people think he's powerful because he has an instadown. I imagine these are also people who run into the middle of nowhere during a chase.
---
I had a missed skill check and as my character was recoiling another one happened, missed 2 checks in no time.
---
Freddy use to before his rework, He was invisible when awake but i could still hear his lulaby full volume in front of my hook
---
Many perks in the game are based on RNG or at least very situational, this is from my opinion is the base game concept: Survs are not aware of Killer perks, and Killer are not aware of Survs perks. 
---
But it's true that we have an annoying perks that are overused because of game balance, like 90% of all games - BBQ&amp;Chili, Ruin,  Adrenalin, Borrowed Time, Balance Landing, Sloppy Butcher... 
---
I had read a lots of complains about "Buff Ruin because they break too fast" or "Nerf Ruin because it's not only regress a gen it's also stops the progress for few seconds". 
---
For killers - if your Ruin always break too fast - here is a tip, take Haunted Grounds + Ruins
---
For survs - if you can't find a totem for most of your games - take or map with track killer belonging or you can use perk the "Small Game"
---
Or if you catch them healing with Nurse's Calling in a corner.
---
Or if you finish a chase and hook someone else and get a BBQ&amp;C proc because they didn't enter a locker.
---
Or if they wasted every single pallet in the area around the hook in the first chase and go down easily.
---
Or if they get unhooked two seconds after you hooked them while you're kicking the nearest generator, and you haven't even left.
---
DS rewards a variety of bad survivor plays, whether they happened before or after the hook, with a second chance.
---
It doesn't "just counter tunneling", and frankly if you run back into the killer, unless it's no-TR GF/Pig, you kind of deserve it.

&gt; Alright I'll humor your stupid ass.
---
As if you're anywhere near as smart as I am.
---
You do make good points about the progression of the match and the time being wasted, but that was never part of the original complain about people getting camped when they used flashlights. To which my counter argument was that they have to get caught in the first place. Why would they act toxic and pretend they're good if they don't have the skills to back that up? &gt;And then proceed to complain about getting camped for acting toxic.
---
I never once complained about getting blinded, but I did point out that if they act like a toxic cunt, they'll get hooked rather quickly.
---
if you get cocky survivors they tend to stupidly loop back for their items
---
Survive with friends. Took me weeks to figure that out lol
---
If you were going to start struggling in those next 20 seconds anyways, I'd say worth. 20 seconds of a killer's time is way more valuable than 20 seconds of a survivor's, and the end result is the same.

Survive with Friends. Anybody on comms that can communicate who the killer is

Depends on the skill level of killer. Your average player probably suffers with Nurse.
---
Mix and match is the best thing about the cosmetics. I like using the Hallowed Blight Doctor with the Plague Doctor caduceus
---
Mori is a mori. They fixed it so you cant end a game in 2 min with an ebbo mori like back in the good ole days.
---
Honestly, I think they're an important piece of the game. Survivors should feel pressure or be scared of the killer now and then =)
---
it seems that we need to explain  a lot of other things anyway for you to understand.
---
It is actually insane how BW + NoED can guarantee all four dead if you play the end game right. Gets much easier if you‚Äôve played ‚Äúbad‚Äù all game. 
---
Some of the most fun I‚Äôve ever had.
---
I love the moment where noed turns on and the SWF just panics as a mercilessly reck their collective shit.
---
The battle
---
*But* have you tried IG + Agi + Mad Grit :)
---
Best feeling in the world lmfao. No cooperation means happy death lmao
---
Who tf uses bond tho? I mean low level dwight's I get it, but once you get a few teachables there are so many better options. (Dont light your torches and grab the pitchforks yet, it's just an opinion) and even if this idea did end up becoming a killer, swf or not, it would still be fun af to scare some rank 20s lmao
---
Slugging them all or getting them to the basement is quite hard way to be toxic :D
---
How smacking people around is toxic though?
---
Ive had matches with a rank 10, 2, 4, &amp; 8
---
Yea true.
---
Or you can just run mint rag + rusty shackles + MYC and call it a night lol.
---
That is a good point though, it means not running selfcare actually costs at least 13 more seconds, 45 vs. 32.
---
And that assumes you know where another survivor to heal you actually is, like the ideal situation.
---
If you don't know where another survivor is and get caught while searching, you're down an entire hook state.
---
In the worst of scenarios you're then down 60 seconds, plus 20 seconds for someone to reach you, on top of the time it takes to get healed.
---
I can‚Äôt get over how small ghost face is
---
Dont tempt them.....Devs: We heard our community and we "buffed" leatherface. He now gets DOUBLE BLOODPOINTS for facecamping.
---
Lol if it aint work for school yard bully's i doubt its gonna work for anonymous asshats
---
Bruh moment
---
No, shitpost
---
GhostFace gonna stab ur ass boi
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre trolling or not, but this is the answer: 
---
Gen Rush is a concept used by killer players to describe the situation where gens are done so fast that a killer (usually without map pressure) cannot do anything to fight back. It is usually considered a gen rush when the length of the game is around 5-6 minutes long, or less.
---
Iron grasp lol
---
Not as big as when they find out you have Ruin.
---
I had a team that seemed to believe that Ruin stopped Generator progress entirely. Two people were hooked to get rid of 1 totem.
---
HANK! GET DOWN FROM THERE DAMMIT
---
Happend to me last game
---
I'm pretty much exclusively a range+setting time kinda guyüòÇ But if I'm feeling extra cheeky, those add ons are fun
---
If iron grasp could give you a basement in at least half of times it would be used way more often :(
---
It's my friends avatar, cozychicken, we both play around on sfm a lot, he has a black jacket jacket as him and I have a black haired black jacket nea that he made for me (it's my profile picture) I wanted to add him in it as a little nod towards him and a thank you
---
Trapper's use it all the time paired with agitation
---
I‚Äôve actually never used MR + Shackles myself lol, i usually just use cicada + cracked turtle egg (i think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called? idk the green duration addon). works wonders.
---
Lol I posted a video of him face camping me lol
---
Yes. I believe he's slower in treatment mode than in punishment mode. Not by much though.
---
how was she there when she just hooked the other person ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
---
I feel like people get a bigger reaction when they find out that the killer has Devour Hope. For an example; suddenly a survivor gets instadowned by one hit and then you get the **exposed** effect with that loud ass sound effect, and then they just go like "***OHH SHIT***" and leave the gen to go look for the hex
---
Oh please don't act like you don't also use meta perks, you can't win as a killer specially agaisnt an SWF.
---
I would have panicked n rAn
---
If you teabag and flashlight spam you deserve the tunneling &amp; camping you may receive as a result, wanted to piss of the killer? mission accomplished you got the intended reaction now accept the outcome
---
Haha, now that's one toxic killer that doesn't get bullied by anyone at all. Good sample, good sample.
---
I'm 12 and I find this funny xD
---
I thought Laurie's was HARD when I first got it because I sucked and would accidentally look at the killer lol. David's too of course but you can kind of hide if you're low enough rank and have your team do most of the work if you're lucky enough to get good survivors.
---
Killer definitely nurse, although when it was just get 4 kills it was never incredibly hard cause I am only low level for killer but now with the 2 pip qualification it would be alot harder
---
 I'm deadüòÇ
---
That's exactly what I'm talking about, and swings that shouldn't connect but it does.
---
No, I'm pretty sure it's a hacker.
---
"Damn it Laurie, use Decisive Strike on the Killer!"
---
As an Xbox player I can respect this
---
ü§£ hmmm
---
Since when does Trapper get bullied? He's a solid mid teir
---
People will literally lead me back to the hook &amp; act surprised when they endup trading places with the survivor they saved
---
\*nasty hag coochie
---
Oh, wait, you meant smacking the on the hook. Now that's toxic, I can agree.
---
as killers, Huntress and Myers
---
as survivors, David and Laurie
---
Mint rag is kinda a meme, like it can be fun but accidentally teleporting to the wrong trap happens a lot. so I don't really fuck with it. shackles is amazing. and bodyblocker is fun to meme with if you have a lerys offering. cicada is definitely her best add on though. not even close. i have 70+ of every other green but only 2 cicadas left :(
---
Reminds me of  mans1ay3r
---
Resilience and Spine Chill combine to increase your window and pallet vaulting speeds by 15%.
---
Sprint Burst and Vigil allow you to play for mid-chase Sprint Bursts by burning SB when not in a chase, having Exhaustion somewhat-recovered when entering a chase and then using Shift micro-management in that chase to regain SB.
---
Pharmacy with Ace In The Hole can give you Styptics. With Botany Knowledge it's a viable-ish setup.
---
Autodidact + Solidarity is not viable, but that's about the most use you can get out of those perks. Spine Chill should be paired with Autodidact.
---
Botany Knowledge, Resilience and Spine Chill can be paired up with a Med-Kit and healing speed add-ons to attempt mid-chase self-healing. Streetwise can be a good addition here since the fastest healing speed add-on robs you of 25% of your Med-Kit charges.
---
Lithe + Quick &amp; Quiet + Dance With Me and Poised + Sprint Burst + Adrenaline have been mentioned.
---
Kindred + Open-Handed + Bond is not bad. Windows Of Opportunities/Object Of Obsession/Plunderer's Instinct could be added.

With ghost, his radius and stain come back instantly which is kind of a bad base kit idea. I think if it was to come back slowly, it would be a lot more balanced for both sides. But hey, anything to make bing bong boy better.

What is ruin
---
Not sure what you‚Äôre trying to say
---
No I do gens and save/heal the guy because i bring a medkit. Also crack totems when i find them.

I just know I'm not so great at leading killers, especially if we're low on resources.

Yea wtf

Its satire, the post is satire

Lol what OP perks.

So is my comment. Legion isn‚Äôt actually a survivor... I can see the shitpost flair

confused_pikachu_face.jpg
---
I'm baffled, really. I mean, if you're that kind of person that ties killers starting froma "solid killer" (as worst performance), then yes, I can agree with you.
---
Well , I don't have the most expensive headphones , but they are decent and I can hear survivor footsteps pretty well from that close, even breathing at times.
---
For months and months, you could use them with Sprint Burst, which would not proc while actively using the key. They always have the utility to put your key add-ons to use that you wouldn't equip on the keys that get you out through the hatch. So aura-reading abilities.
---
She crouchwalked along the wall on the right, you can see her go past the first time at 5 seconds in the vid.
---
Ruin shouldn‚Äôt stay up the whole match, it should be at least until first hook tho. If it lasted whole match that would be super bullshit, stop complaining it‚Äôs fine as is
---

---
This picture makes me so uncomfortable
---
I guess it means he didn't see the killer all game and did 98 percent of the gens.
---
Yeah, I'm just saying that other companies do fine adding new characters without making you pay. Even before Minecraft was owned by Microsoft, they kept adding tons of new features without pay, and SMPS4 gives you free. suits and side missions. I guess since BHVR is smaller they do need the money though.
---
They made it so that it has to be a protection hit for mettle right?
---
I just did this lol was last one not dead and left me to die on hook. I watched and laughed as the killer downed him off the door switch as door opened.
---
I see that. Just not sure what the post is supposed to prove to us. Hasn't everyone done this before? This is twice a day for me.
---
Sorry for my bad english btw, it's not my native language
---
Also I'm playing on PS4 on Europe Servers
---
They are indeed huge spherical boxes. When they changed them, they turned them into rectangular hitboxes more-so matching the actual hatchet model, and it messed with their collision on objects a lot, and to some extent their registry on survivors. They simply reverted that change, and the sphere size has felt even more ridiculous since.
---
What they could do instead is simply reduce the size of that hitbox sphere. That would allow players to throw hatchets through and over more objects, but in turn make some of the ridiculous hits impossible, where it's obvious the survivor was hit by an invisible bubble extending outward more than anything else.
---
Latency is another issue. Dedicated servers should help with unfair registry on the survivor side due to the nature of how the different networking architectures function, but whether things will actually be better is still up-in-the-air, due to other factors involved (https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ce5i6k/dedicated_servers_were_bad/etz336u/?st=jywwl8fd&amp;sh=5c0f162c).
---
It's just a game, shouldn't matter that much.
---
A lot of the times the killers like to go and look for pallets or go afk or run around at the speed of sound on a chainsaw after hooking the last guy
---
I can‚Äôt I have some weird glitch where I cant change region damn it
---
You mean on a hook? ü§£
---
Why?
---
The first idea will just get survivors killed quicker instead of punishing face camping even with a BT effect. Maybe if hook progress was slower while the killer is nearby would discourage.
---
For the second idea, believe it or not, a lot of killers don't camp, and giving them a 50% chance to immediately down a survivor is gonna piss everyone off and make it way too easy for killers to snowball.
---
In addition both these perks are rng based which is never fun.
---
same here
---
An obvious example of stream sniping can be found [here ](https://youtu.be/xQ6xP270qSo). Make sure to also check the post game chat at the end of the video as this proved my point even further
---
I think theyve done a pretty good job so far
---
There‚Äôs a difference between sniping and harassing. 
---
A few games is whatever, but hasn‚Äôt it been 13 days of almost every killer game sniped?
---
Stealth killers like hag, myers, wraith and ghostface works quite well on lerys in my experience
---
GTA 5 and Rainbow Six anyway.
---
I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because of rights to likeness to the actor. It‚Äôs why Laurie doesn‚Äôt look like Jamie Lee Curtis or Tapp looking like Donald Glover.
---
Usually by the time I get 3 stacks survivors either DC or kill themselves on the hook.
---
Cuz you wanna win and your a sneaky lil survivor lol
---
You're getting downvoted because they said 2 days ago that they're on track to release the next DLC around the same time this year that they did last year.

Stupid nigger.

It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs an actually human in a costume

That is why hexes are a gamble. They can't be all powerful all the time. This game it's in the middle of an open field, next game it's up your ass. It's a risk you have to accept when running hex perks.

OP is fat or a twink. Either way, sad.
---
If you watched the video he said he got sniped every single day multiple times by the same two people. I don't know you, but I don't play that much time against the same people and they certainly don't bring OP items at every match. If it's a one or two time thing I don't think it matters, but 11 days in a row you can easily prove that they sniped him, if you look at the end game chat they even mock him about what he said while the game was actually playing.
---
I guess getting facecamped and tunneled took its toll on poor Quentin
---
And decisive strike as well. I love being hit after being unhooked endgame. That's my favorite escape lol
---
When you have the rights for licensing you are allowed to use it and use how they look like
---
I think moris are fine but I do think that ebonies should take 2 hooks.
---
If this is weird for you you must be new, this is 50% of my matches
---
This isn't even a new Totem place, sadly they just improve them instead of remove them, well actually they should just remove the open field ones. All others are okay or good.
---
It is not toxic but the reasons why survivors hate moris is becuase:
---
Mori = soft camping &amp; tunneling = no chance to play the game = small amount of blood points = depip in most cases = not fun at all.
---
&gt;If you watched the video he said he got sniped every single day for 11 days, multiple times by the same two people. I don't know you, but I don't play that much time against the same people and they certainly don't bring OP items at every match. If it's a one or two time thing I don't think it matters, but 11 days in a row you can easily prove that they sniped him, if you look at the end game chat they even mock him about what he said while the game was actually playing.
---
I watched his stream for a few hours the past days. Like I said, we **KNOW** they are blatantly sniping his lobby with the assistance of MLGA but you can't **PROVE** sniping. Like Past joining his lobby, you can't prove the snipers are actually using his stream to gain gameplay advantage or something like that. 
---
This discussion brought me a memory from a few months back when I used to SWF with other 3 friends and we kept going against the same streamer possibly because of the lack of other killers available. It didn't take long for him to start accusing us of sniping during the 2nd match.
---
On DBD there are a lot of measurements the streamer can take to reduce the amount of advantage a possible sniper can get but to start banning people on an accusation impossible to prove, is really fishy.
---
Same happened to me too, BHVR fix
---
It's better when you listen to Duel of the Fates
---
You should work on your lines, and proportions, and colouring, and shading. I would call this a doodle, looks like it didn't take too much time to scribble this out.
---
Batfight, a gentleman's game..
---
it matters to the kids that you make it not fun for
---
I like to think that every killer is viable. I'm currently at rank 2 (ironic cos of the meme I know) and I main bubba. It's just a matter of practicing to get the most out of each killer.
---
So make the game less challenging to survivors to challenge them?
---
ripperoni cmdr
---
We decided that 5 blinks it's too powerful, so we removed them. But we added a third blink to her base power to compensate it.
---
If you pip up then it‚Äôs a win
---
Everytime there's a "discussion" with noed I know I'm gonna find you haha.
---
I like whispers 3, sloppy butcher, noed, 4th is random and probably depends on if the killer I'm playing has 1 good perk of their own. There may be better setups for no teachables but so far this has worked out on my low leveled killers or those that got unlucky in the bloodweb
---
Hmm... I just had a match with a camping Wraith...
---
If you look at this post you can clearly see not everyone says that.
---
God nurse wins. That's because how she's not counterable. She's everything that counters what survivor can use to defend themselves. Ignores pallets, windows, walls, everything.
---
&gt;Why do survivors think they should be able to counter killers solo?
---
Where did you get that. I specifically said I can't be responsible for it the team can. My problem is not knowing how much my team is doing against Noed and they not knowing how much I do against it. Going for totems is a zero sum game basically. Leave one out and it will be the most hidden one and you just fucked yourself over. It's simply not worth "dOiNg BoNeS" better to let it activate. The design for Noed is simply stupid in it's current state.
---
Unfortunately, reports from other players are completely subjective: they can just choose to do it
---
God I feel like trapper could wreck ghostface in a fight after seeing the size difference lol
---
But it is tho
---
Pictures of screens don't get a howdy from me
---
They don't have the license to use his likeness. Kyle Gallner didn't even know Quentin was in DBD for a while
---
This is good :)  yea that‚Äôs true but as a company and as actor when you agree with the terms with a movie then they own your face with the movie but this is not in all cases :( I would just like they to change his face a tiny bit more accurate
---
I gotta admit that we would all look like that with the shits he has probably seen on his time fighting to escape the Entity
---
Not sure why he is bitching. He didn‚Äôt use Ruin, he‚Äôs on a slow ass killer and still got an almost perfect game.
---
That doesn't really have anything to do with my post, but since you asked. It would be the same suggestions I have for instant heals, body blocking, adrenaline, ds, New Gear toolboxes, 99% a hook and removing it as the killer brings up a body, dead hard, and having a survivor crouch behind the killer at a pallet so they can't move or break it.
---
That it's a game and sometimes you're going to go against a play style or build you don't like. The dev team can only do so much to stop behaviors you don't like before they remove free will to play the game how you want.
---
 Yeah slugging sucks, but what? If two people are on the ground one should magically get back up? Take unbreakable then.
---
Noed is brutal, but maybe cleans those totems?
---
Facecamping is the worst. But take Kindred so everyone knows you're camped and pop pop pop as 3 gens go off in a row.
---
i heard surveillance with the pig is good, so I'll use that 
---
thank you!
---
Really? Wtf dude
---
I feel like it will never be done but I feel like if they just made a a big rework to the survivor objective system they could set themselves up for more balance possibilities. With the idea for a change to ruin it feels like the line between very strong perk that ever killer will use and  RNG uselessness will be very thin. If they were to make a new objective system they could rework perks and add new perks and make tons of changes for new gameplay and balance opportunities.
---
DH?
---
Thanks so you let me know that
---
Getting a 4K doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean your a good player I think that depends o. The individual aspect of what you think for instance I tend not to care if survivors escape I focus more on whether my hatched on huntress hits across the map and lands... just try and have fun is the most important
---
Yeah, he was cool about it though. I feel it'd be more of an issue with bigger name actors like Jamie Lee Curtis and Danny Glover, since the rights to their likeness would cost more.
---
And Myers! I legit at beginning of a game had a full 1-2 min staring standoff with him and it was freaking hilarious and awkward
---
The wraith or survivor?
---
&gt;!Spoiler: The only answer is both!&lt;
---
I always think the pig is a survivor and die every time she comes near me
---
Introducing the latest in game play mechanics.
---
 Holding your breath.
---
Honestly the most fun we've had in KYF is when someone suddenly gets really quiet (we demand everyone use open mics) and it's really intense. It adds another level to hiding and it is an absolute blast.
---
Right? I seriously don't get why we don't have 2v8 already. The game has shown time and time again that it can handle multiple Killers and more than 4 Survivors, why not quit beating around the bush and just get to it already? Even if it doesn't give BP or rank, I just want to play Killer with my friend lol.
---
Rank doesn't even matter in this game. Based on those perks the purple rank players weren't that good to begin with.
---
It's too bad Remember Me got a bit of a nerf. I ran that on all my M1 killers in hopes for an exciting endgame. But I do understand why they did it though. It'd be almost impossible to open the door as the last person when the killer closed the hatch and the EGC begins.
---
The only time I got zero points for basically escaping was when the killer instead of disconnecting from the game, ‚Äúclosed the application‚Äù (I believe?). But then it actually showed zero points for all of us. I can‚Äôt believe this is even a thing. We all lost the item we brought as well.
---
Doctor for timing, huntress for general knowledge of loops and what she can or can‚Äôt hit, Billy for some insane flicks.
---
Lowest probably Legion and Leatherface. There‚Äôs not really anything to them. Just chase and hit.
---
What? No. Mori's are good and an important part of the game.
---
If with win you mean getting a kill and a displeased entity, sure
---
And you then you discover he was using double pink add ons and you felt stupid x)
---
Well good for you
---
R.I.P
---
devour hope
---
He literally complains about stream sniping every time he plays badly :/ Every time survivors do good they are an SWF. Every time they have purple items it's a stream snipe.
---
Deathgarden just had a three hour test for 2v10 and yeah, it was fun as hell
---
You just complained about devour hope, slugging, and make your choice as being ‚Äúnot fun‚Äù. 
---
You‚Äôre trolling lmaoooo

Adept plague was hell for me personally. When higher ranks simply run around sick and avoid giving you power, it's a hassle

Crouching Pig, Hidden NoED.

I know, I played said test lol. DG is definitely a main game for me once that gets implemented. But fingers crossed 2v10 in DG is a testing ground for DBD 2v8?
---
I have a question I've been wondering. Who's Quentin? I have watched the Original Freddy movies and I never seen him. Is he in the remakes? I haven't seen them so that would probably explain why I'm confused.
---
It'd be cool if we could get a Chop-Top face. Like he's wearing Chop-Tops head and he had a metal plate. I love Chop-Top.
---
Does it work with self care or med kits?
---
It's those cheeks. Just give him chunky pinchable cheeks
---
so many dickhead killers on lately. sad when you get to use ds every single game. even sadder when only 1/4 of those can be blamed on bad teammates
---
Didn‚Äôt feel stupid because it‚Äôs not that serious but you should feel stupid for trolling :P have a better day miserable one :D
---
Die, lol. At that point look for the hatch prematurely and hope your teammate dies
---
Only class-D(wight) personnel to go into the locker
---
Bubba needs a big buff
---
Bond is great due to being able to not run straight into your team while being chased
---
Whenever Leatherface uses insidious with that face, he eats his own skin
---
That would explain it. Haven't gotten around to watching it yet.
---
Stared at him and was crouched. That is GhostFace
---
Probably not Jason, seeing the whole F13 fiasco that occurred that killed the game..
---
Yeah I was thinking of the killer who looked most like a survivor, but was wrong anyways
---
It does not work with healing yourself and to cannot use a medkit, it has to be with your hands only.
---
Didn‚Äôt the lore say that when you become absolutely hopeless, that‚Äôs when the Entity turns you into one of it‚Äôs killers/worshippers?
---
Ghostface stares and one shots. Not legion
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
I got into this game around Halloween last year because it was free to play. First game I had was against a Billy and I absolutely sucked balls and was last survivor but the billy let me find the hatch and we had a nice post game chat. That was a pleasant experience that made me want to play more. :)
---
Legion should have a crouch ability. Maybe not hide heartbeat. But crouch so can mind game from a distance.
---
Oh sure and they always will. You can't force people to turn those off and we shouldn't want to. But this offers an in-game alternative that presence survivors with a challenge, let's non SWF solo Survivor's be included in that information exchange and gives killers a new way to be scary.
---
Bond is one of the strongest perks in this game

Ever played games with in-game voice chat and external alternatives? No one uses the in-game stuff, especially on console and these voice chats don't have disadvantages but they're still avoided.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
They won't get nerfed
---
If they all 4 use the well at the same time you won't get the blood wells from any of them.
---
You can farm, tunnel and face camp every single match forever if you want and you'll never be banned for it, so it can't be that. 
---
What do you mean you don't have access to the chat?
---
Yes, they're an important part of the game. Maybe they should keep the Cypress one, or make moris kill on last hook. I hate going against a Mori, and i don't use it them when i play killer because winning with an Ebony feels cheap.
---
Nah, definitely someone sliced her hands off... musta been Yoshikage Kira!
---
Jokes aside, you might wanna adjust that so the opening where her sleeves would hide the hands is big enough for a hand to actually hide inside, since if it really is hiding her hands, her hands must have never grown beyond that of a toddler‚Äôs hand size.
---
Isn't the point of the killer to get the survivors to stop as fast as possible? That's literally any FPS, battle royale, MMO... Be on top at all costs
---
Never leave a man behind!

He complains about stuff on Reddit rather than trying to fix it.

Have you played Hunt: Showdown? It has in-game prox chat like this. Sure sometimes we're relaxing and playing in Discord with it turned off when we're just goofing around. But when we want a challenge we will turn on open mics and play with in game mics only. (Or sometimes use it to strike a bargain, but that isn't relevant here.)
---
Quentin looks like :‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî{

I'm sorry. But it is funny tho.

 But don‚Äôt cleanse 90%

This is why you should use NOED regardless :)

i changed to pc and there are less potatoes but hitting as killer is easier, there are less survivors who 360 and just N U R S E

YES YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT......BRAAAIIIINNNNNSSSS.........THE NEXT KILLER HAS BEEN STATED TO BE RELEASED SAME AS LAST YEAR.....BBBBRRRRRAAAAAIIIIINNNNNSSSSS..........AND IT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE AN ORIGINAL KILLER AND AN ORIGINAL SURVIVOR........BRRRRAAAAAIIIIIINNNNNNSSSSS...........
---
the reposter who didn't realize he was reposting who posted the posted you think you are cleverely replying to has sent you a dozen cookies for being so original and cool!
---
Try quitting the game and restart it or uninstall and reinstall it.Hope that helps
---
Well I mean... if he played like a rank 20 you should have been able to loop him till the gates were opened then run out.
---
OOF
---
You and everybody on this subreddit managed to make me do that a long time ago. At this point I just kinda accepted the fact that you are all just backseat developers and are not worth wasting my life on you. Facepalm all you want, but yer the oonly one facepalm worthy.
---
Thats...thats not how this works.
---
I disagree, apart from DBD and GTAV to an extent, all of those games are trash.
---
Sometimes it's a matter of who finds the hatch first, most of those useless survivors like to camp it at the end of the game lol. Its really annoying
---
Well, then they can get over themselves.
---
Generally curious, why?
---
Ma'am this is Wendy's.
---
I think there's 5 wells. Also if ALL wells are filled, they auto-refresh and Plague automatically gets corrupt purge, which can happen mid-chase.
---
the games based off of teamwork so they have every right to feel that way
---
This is awesome, man!
---
Unrelated note, real happy that you can feel sympathetic for this one like a few other killers in the game, but I got a question
---
Would there be legitimate matches where Rose let‚Äôs one survivor go if she can‚Äôt stand seeing her sister cry as a result of an easy victory?
---
Maybe, hell even very likely, but it's the best idea I've got so there it is. Happy to hear other thoughts.
---
The only time I interacted with him was when I was like 10 feet from escaping and he fucking whacks me once. Then he facecamped me, but I‚Äôm the bad player.
---
Read her description. If all 4 cleanse at once then no red pools.
---
If it's a friend that I've queued with then it's a different story. If it's a random, then that's just bad luck. Either that or it's something to do lwith the Killer.
---
I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who doesn‚Äôt mind Quentin. Dude is canonically a druggie, and this Quentin does look like he has drug problems and sleep related trauma.
---
Cool story. But there are 5 fountains.
---
Read her description. If all 4 cleanse at once then no red pools. Knob
---
It's not based off of teamwork. If you're good enough, you could probably do all five generators on your own and escape.
---
I did not know who the original editor was
---
Euh, no thank you.
---
i screamed at the pig
---
I agree, make the killer have to jog between them at the least for OP, but that‚Äôs fine for me
---
Unrelated note
---
I like trapper, if I‚Äôm not following a scratch mark trail or chasing someone and I discover a gate early to mid game, I‚Äôm trapping the lever
---
They never see me do it during early or mid game so they never realize they should watch where they step.
---
Faggots
---
So Michael Jackson Appears? Yah that‚Äôs scary enough to make me wanna exit!
---
At the end of the match instead of the bloodpoint categories, rank information and the player overview (who used what perks/items/offerings etc) I get a quick loading sequence that is followed by an error screen "Rank Update error" I can click accept of whatever it is and they send me to the screen that usually only shows up when You freshly start the game. So I don¬¥t have access to the chat, it doesn¬¥t let me chat, yet somehow I was banned for harassment which in my experience should punish my behaviour specifically and ONLY in the post-game chat? Did I missunderstand anything? I couldn¬¥t even click on anybody¬¥s steam profile to insult them in the comments if I wanted, which I clearly don¬¥t... I¬¥m usually a really chill guy, which is also why I¬¥m not flaming on reddit "Devs hate me Q.Q... worst game ever blablabla... Game is dying!" And immature things like that... It¬¥s just an issue I¬¥d like to have help with and somebody said I should contact the support which I did, now I¬¥m waiting.
---
They reworked decisive strike. Survivor mains were pissed off.  
---
&gt;!This is a joke btw, no flaming!&lt;
---
I paid for this hair cut leave me the fuck alone
---
-
---
Feng, probably
---
I can explain some of them if they confuse you, for example, Huntress wears a mask of you... you are her prey, just like rabbits were her prey before she went into the fog.
---
Well one master to another it would bring more glitches and it would be needless the problem with it is they've already said camping is fine and it would also have to be a big enough distance so survivors dont abuse it
---
And?
---
Yes lmfao
---
You're not going to like this, but...
---
I'm a Survivor main with 200hrs (very little compared to others) who started as killer so, take this with a grain of salt.
---
"it ruins the fun for the survivors" He is NOT on your team. Killers are there to kill you by any means. There is an unwritten, unspoken "moral code", but it was thought up by survivors and killers in no way are forced to play by it.
---
I think you spelled adrenaline wrong lol sorry couldn't help make that joke. But its all preference if you ask me, I used it when I started as a baby dwight because I was scared and wanted team mates. After I got over that, personally didnt see a reason to keep bringing it. I can usually hear other survivors extremely easily ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è like I said tho, it's all preference.
---
Probably Plague, only because I think corrupt purge is still bugged and doesn't count for emblem progress.
---
I think he‚Äôs making fun of how they used perks that are outright more annoying than NOED making them worse than he is by their logic
---
i thought you meant help me play cos im bad at the game
---
Because NOED is a toxic perk. What Killers use when they can't do anything.
---
Nightmare on elm street mate :)
---
Yeah im seeing now that the game is more about score than the 4k
---
It definitely should be
---
The actor did say he was ok for DBD to use his likeness. But, I don't know much about likeness of person and likeness of character. Maybe those are seperate things when it comes to ownership.
---
Are you a survivor main?
---
nice touch putting the dwight head on the last panel only
---
Xbox One, if a survivor disconnects close to where hatch happens to spawn, hatch will not spawn. It can be heard, but not seen or interactable.
---
You don't even have to do totems though. When I'm with the guy I SWF with (we're a two man) we'll sometimes do totems for blood points, this one match I did four of them by myself.
---
But at the end of the day hunting down totems usually isn't worth it, you can pop generators so much faster than you can find totems, and I'm okay with risking NOED in order for us (the other three survivors, myself and the two randoms) to pop three generators while the killer is chasing my friend.
---
If NOED is in play, I can try to find it after 99ing the gate, the killer isn't going to catch me before I can escape even NOED if I save whatever exhaustion perk I have, unless I mess up royally, while I'm searching for it.
---
And that assumes anyone goes down, because it really is that easy - wait until they check the gate or are otherwise occupied, then open it.
---
If it gets the killer a down with it, more power to them I guess, there are plenty of second chance perks that hit the killer despite all the conditions attached to them, but the true power of NOED is usually in an endgame collapse build (Blood Warden being a big one, Remember Me being another) and two or three perks to make it really shine is an investment.
---
There's always a reason to camp (permenantly 1 less person doing gens, 1 less person to chase, 1 less person on their team). 
---
IF you team is good, they'll just continue doing gens and THEN come to get you. 
---
What happens MOST of the time though is he camps, whole team stops what their doing to get you, and it starts a cycle of downing and hooking rescuers. &lt;--- this is what they want and why they camp.
---
But the Trapper is human too
---
Dead hands is op the other 2 seem fine tho.
---
How is it OP?
---
It‚Äôs because if you crouch in tall grass as Pig you can‚Äôt see shit so it‚Äôs more likely to not see someone and then be surprised by them
---
What am I looking at? Is there supposed to be something funny/ironic here?
---
Devs are idiots. Streamer advertise for free their games and they don't even care about stream sniping problems.
---
Thank god, I‚Äôm a big fan of strong killers, and wish everyone would be on billy and spirit level one day (not gonna happen I know) but Nurse is too strong
---
High skill floor doesn‚Äôt mean she isn‚Äôt overpowered
---
Thank you man that‚Äôs true on that like some people sade he was ok with it
---
Just sounds like something a controller would do. My friend‚Äôs PS4 controller did this too
---
So if a killer decides to tunnel 1 survivor their only defense is Ds. This negates ds completely with no counter.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the math. Why is tremendously 25% increase in repair speed when 25% of 80 is 20 seconds off? So it should be 60 seconds. If it reduces it to 64 seconds, it should be 20%
---
All 8 survivors all bring commodious toolboxes
---
All 8 survivors all bring commodious toolboxes and several bring prove thyself and leader. That would be a massacre.
---
Must be another bug or something
---
Yeah because sadly they're mid tier at best nice shitpost btw
---
Lmao moron
---
The chart is taken from the dbd wiki, so if anything's incorrect in it it's not my fault sorry :/
---
Actually being able to loop someone for 3 or 4 gens is a crutch.
---
Let's be honest, generator times being so short is absolutely a game mechanic, and survivors are absolutely supposed to do generators.
---
But at the same time, remember that while you're getting chased, there are three other survivors that already made progress to three separate generators before you got found, meaning each one has less than 80 seconds (sometimes a lot less, depending) before they pop.
---
Add in your balanced landing loops, your safe pallets, your resetting the Killer's bloodlust around Ormond/Badham/Haddonfield/Cowshed after they spent 30 seconds building it up, the pallets that can't be mind-gamed around, the loops that are gigantic (most double-window loops set in any of the buildings) and still have pallets sprinkled around.
---
Being able to run the killer is *strong*, so strong that generator times being so *comparatively* short that NOED is not the biggest problem.
---
Killers who don't have gap closers/chase enders are the problem, they use NOED because their kit is sorely lacking.
---
Typical players of this game man. Just another typical player...all you can do is laugh and walk away lol.
---
&gt; bannable 
---
Nothing is ever banned here. Ever.
---
As for the rest of your comment &amp; "input"- well... I play this game practically daily. Hours on end, matter of fact. People here joke about DC's &amp; what not.
---
Sacraficed on the 1st hook? Happens at least once a day for me, with the other "survivors" just lollygaging around. "GREAT" game!
---
I could go on, but it'd be lost on you.
---
They posted in the AMA that they have no plans to add 2v8 to DBD due to balance issues and not wanting to have to divert attention away balancing the main mode.
---
Is it? Game literally says you won or not ^_^ You can't change rules
---
I think it‚Äôs correct. I understand it now. It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a rate, charges per second. So it would take 64 seconds at that rate to be equivalent to 80 seconds.
---
Good catch. I didn't bother watching the video a second time and merely assumed she went under the bridge and back around.
---
Big thunk
---
Exactly! just realized that
---
To make it even better! The devs actually changed Sloppy Butcher, so it only slows your heals by 20%, so Botany Knowledge actually counters the perk by 13%!
---
No. I'm just saying that is kinda unfair that they call me toxic when they are a group of swf all with "toxic" perks, and doing BM.
---
So youre trying to tell me Balanced landing is a toxic perk..
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/clx8cl/rank_1_survivor_vs_rank_20_killer/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
My point is: They can't call me toxic for using a clutch perk when they are a swf, all with adrenaline and BT, rushing gens, and making the game not fun at all.
---
I once partook in the bullying of a baby dweeght. He tried to leave the locker while my back was turned. He was no match for Iron Maiden.
---
If the survivor wants to waste massive amounts of time self caring instead of doing gems so be it. It just disadvantages them. Prove thyself is fine because you have to find other survivors for it to even work. How are these crutches? They all have downsides but noed has none. Fuck up early game and misplay? No worries. Here‚Äôs a speed boost and instadown for you
---
Original is by u/smart-and-witty-name
---
I think it'd be pretty OP. That's a lot of information gained for something that should be setting your team back.
---
Freddy was never a camping killer pre-rework, having to put both rescuer and victim asleep and *still* having to deal with borrowed time meant that even with block addons he couldn't catch someone before they got back a looping point.
---
Some pre-rework Freddy's did indeed try, but it was often a pathetic and useless attempt if the rescuer kept cover to avoid getting slept from 15\~ meters away.
---
Just curious, do you have the source file for the portrait background, I've got a custom David portrait in my game and the lack of consistency by backgrounds would really bug me. Cheers :)
---
thank you
---
No, but 3 Adrenalines and 3 Decisives kinda is
---
When your teamate brings the killer to you on purpose:
---
"A small price to pay for salvation."
---
Entity‚Äôs Grasp would be pretty crazy paired with Surveillance.
---
Borrowed Time, this allows you to not farm people and say you unhook someone in front of a killer, they hit the injured survivor and if you're still hanging around, they'll hit you too.
---
Self-Care/med-kits: because you'll be taking lots of hits.
---
Decisive Strike, as soon as you're unhooked, go unhook someone else and take the hit straight after, then you get a free escape, a hit and a safe unhook.
---
Yes, Survivors should gen rush if a killer is camping, but that almost never happens. a camping killer usually brings all the survivors to one spot trying to save each other.
---
what the fuck
---
My opinion is that you‚Äôre only toxic if you teabag or camp hooks so it‚Äôs impossible to rescue people without getting hit, otherwise, it‚Äôs just the fact that you can‚Äôt counter certain skills and it‚Äôs your fault, not toxic, just something you can‚Äôt personally deal with.
---
If it was made correctly it shouldn't though. I mean sure it wouldn't be perfectly done but Amanda or John could have just followed a YouTube video at least to properly treat it. At the least it would smell better than that cheap plastic shit.
---
You'd be surprised how many times this happens.
---
No.
---
I would say a good counter to camping would be the non hooked survivors get some sort of increased action speed. You want to camp, now everyone is doing gens/healing/gates/etc an additional 10/20/30% faster. That would stop camping real quick. I think killers could get like an increased blood point reward for hitting other survivors from at least 40 meters away when someone is on the hook to encourage less camping. I don‚Äôt think they necessarily need to be able to potentially one down hit us.
---
LMAO
---
Entity's Grasp + Surveillance would be a killer combo.
---
&gt;Waaah waaah the killer stopped me from playing the game where literally his sole goal is to stop me from playing the game

Ok but obviously there is something wrong with him for him to be that big and deformed to look like a monster  I‚Äôm just saying if you watch scream movies ghostface is just a normal human with a costume
---
It's always the obsession that does it when I'm faking a chase with them to save my STBFL stacks, but keep them away from shit.
---
Change Dead Hands to 4/3/2, and Entity‚Äôs Grasp to 120/100/80
---
You are keeping me cumming... in all of these crab patties, I will tell you that much.
---
Hex: Heartbreaker
---
Yeah it happens if the killer instead of quitting the game, closes the application, turns off their console, or removes their Ethernet. It‚Äôs so dumb it still happens but they take advantage of that situation and it punishes survivors.
---
say you down 3 survivor 4th is hooked you hook the other one and the one you just hooked has deliverance then they use it and go for them cause they didnt wait for you to leave is that tunneling ?
---
In order to reveal Ghostface enough of him has to be visible in the middle of your screen.
---
So if you can see only his head then it is not quite enough. Try to move where you can see more of his body then you will reveal him
---
Hag‚Äôs new mori looks great
---
So in other words, the killer was just upset you escaped.
---
What i mean by is stealth is not being noticed by the killer, not being completely stealthy.
---
Example: Spine chill lights up, and you need to hide because if you don't how to escape or loop a killer you will be hooked quite quickly.
---
I had a few games with pink haired nea and two cotton candy fengs. I watched them while i did gens with bond and it l felt bad for the killer as they triple teamed him. I almost forgot he was the killer.
---
I mean, I like DBD *and* Siege, GTAV, and BO4. BO4 is only good for blackout, though
---
Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, We‚Äôre gonna live forever, and Urban Evasion
---
Doesn‚Äôt make the situation better ya know
---
For me it‚Äôs not as often as they completely ignore me and do gens... even when the killer is chasing the 2nd guy...
---
Honestly I don't think so.
---
See, Kindred itself doesn't actually do anything besides give information. 
---
It doesn't tell your teammates what to do or coordinate their actions, it doesn't prevent the Killer from Insidious camping or even from catching a would be rescuer, and it doesn't do **anything** for the person running it. 
---
Literally **all** it does is give the other Survivors the same information that the Survivor running it has. What the other Survivors do with that information is up to them. 
---
Which is honestly probably why so few run it. The perk doesn't actually guarantee it will help you.
---
This is my stand point aswell. I don't play killer anymore unless it's my daily, but when I did I just weighed my options and went with the better one. I too was called a camper, tunneler, ect.
---
To be very honest. Killers (nurse not included), are severely handicapped. Poor survivor decisions are what make killers look like the stronger of the two. Almost every killer now is using hex:ruin, just hoping for a game longer than 5 minutes so they get to actually do something. and even then, sometimes it's cleansed 20 seconds into the game.
---
re-uploading in general is scummy as fuck though?? don‚Äôt use the ‚Äòbut other people do it‚Äô excuse, you‚Äôre no better than them. and if you really thought the art work was ‚Äòfine‚Äô then you‚Äôd want for the artist to get the recognition they deserve.
---
Self care wastes time cause it's slow and sprint burst isn't controlled. Also you can use both because adrenaline ignores if you're exhausted or not.
---
Is this how you transfer souls?
---
"Please don't put me in your basement, oh killer!"
---
"Basement? Nah, this is the penthouse suite!"
---
Wait what!
---
Thats it, a heal and a sprint burst that ignores exhaustion. Dont know of in mobile it does this, but the heal is saved when you're on a hook, so you can be unhooked at full health
---
Exactly the reason you said. If you are looping it can give you enough space between a killer. Or the really long sprint burst just gets you immediately to a door, opening it for your team. And high rank players sometimes try to rush gens and not heal, so it‚Äôs a free heal that would‚Äôve had to waste time with. Self care takes 24 seconds that could‚Äôve been done doing a gen and getting out.
---
&gt;The thing is noed rewards misplaying
---
Because Decisive Strike - "Only activates if you get downed by the killer twice" doesn't reward misplaying?
---
Because Borrowed Time - "Only is useful if a survivor is bad and gets hooked" doesn't reward misplaying?
---
Don't you see how stupid that sounds?
---
If you play solo survivor, use something like Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Dead Hard/Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time or Self Care if you don't have med-kits. 
---
One of the things that is happening a lot now is when you have DS active and the killer is near you, go into a locker so the killer has to grab you and you can use your DS. 
---
The rest is pretty much the same. Looping the killer, try to use the windows instead of wasting pallets, etc.
---
The edit looks better then the one we have
---
Yes on that
---
There is already an anti-tunneling perk, Decisive Strike. And even if the survivor doesn't have it, the threat of it is enough to stop tunneling.
---
Tunneling should be extremely rare nowadays unless you are constantly performing unsafe unhooks. 
---
How would survivors be stopped from leaving? Would switches be blocked? Or would it be a Blood Warden effect?
---
If the latter, 20 seconds is not nearly as long as tier 3 Blood Warden and would basically be a worse Blood Warden. Once survivors see they can't leave they would just hide and wait out the 20 then go.
---
Just have the clown bite it off.
---
Love Aja! This shit killed me üòÇüòÇ
---
Hahaha basically. If you try to kill them, you are doing wrong.
---
Sometimes i end getting sacrificed n yet more points than those who escape,
---
I mean if you think about it he's supposed to look like he hasnt slept in ages. I think its fitting
---
yessir
---
Isnt teabaging just pressing a button repeatedly?
---
He does look sleepless, you're right, but I think they could have achieved that look without making him look like that
---
Don‚Äôt do this man like that
---
&gt; Only then will they give you a gg and no complaining lol.
---
"gg ez" or "are you boosted?" is more likely.
---
Sometimes you have to leave, sometimes the you will get stuck in some place and only option will be to leave, sometimes some player will take the game hostage. there are many reasons as to why you would like to disconect, but the guys that disconect because they were found too quickly, or got ran over by the billy when the killer was beggining to check gens, or simply were hooked, those are the ones who are breaking the rules.
---
I get your post, but at the same time, what if it‚Äôs an error that literally makes it so you can‚Äôt find a match at all? It has to notify you of it... so you‚Äôd just want to sit waiting for a match that will never come because of an error you weren‚Äôt warned about?
---
i think people wouldnt use it though, similar to ghostface's crouch or leaning behind a wall, because it would just be slower. my best killer power idea was that we could take control of a survivor. lots of possibilities therein
---
Idk, m o m needs 3 protection hits. I'd say three seems fair for this as well.
---
lol the clown collects penii to build his spaceship made of penii to return to his home planet
---
it makes me smile when I play killer and get a little "thanks for letting me escape" after two survivor DCed and I stop chasing the other(s) seriously.
---
Well I can't get anywhere because the first person never gave me a definition. Im stuck going off what I think they meant. By your definition,  you can't earn it, because it's tied to the EGC? Adrenaline is also tied to EGC. I don't see your point.
---
You‚Äôre not gonna reason with irrationally mad players.  Just say gg and move on. Let them stew in their own toxic soup.
---
Dude just go look up taxidermy tutorials. You can find videos of how to skin and treat animal skin/pelts and then simply move on to mask tutorials or other leatherworking tutorials.
---
It's really not that weird. No you likely won't find a butchering video that explicitly has them killing the pig but you can find tutorials on how to deskull a deer for mounting or treat pelts and leather for use in clothes, cold weather gear, and yes costumes. Taxidermy/leatherworking is a popular hobby in farming and hunting towns.
---
He really isn't that good. God forbid you go against a swf with OoO you aren't even going to play.
---
how would you organize the list?
---
100%
---
This is a cool screenshot, looks like something from a movie trailer!
---
do you know how to do that?
---
it‚Äôs very killer biased so if the killers not a rank 20 noob it doesn‚Äôt matter how good you are :/ something has to distract them and if you camp you get crows
---
Na man. You can‚Äôt compare apples to oranges like that. 2 is more than fair.
---
Sure but there are much more toxic survivors than there are killer from personal experience. From my experience a killer that would tunnel or camp would either be because of a toxic survivor finally getting the attention he was seeking or a killer wanting to secure a kill near the end. You do have your few asshole killers that'll go for the tunnel and camp right off the bat of the match with dying light but that's few and far as compared to toxic survivors so do you think it's really relevant which is worst when both are bad for the game but you see one much much more than the other.
---
444 has to do with your life purpose and path. I would consider that a dire warning to change. Numbers are not omens but rather messages, hints, secrets. My name equals 444 in gematria.
---
I dont know. Nea looks awful too.
---
Maybe not everyone is as handsome as you u/SoDamnGeneric
---
I had an idea for a old game hunter with like 3 bloodhounds and a musket. He would have heightened track senses. A ranged attack with a musket, and he could send a hound out to trap a survivor.

---
Yeah I know but it's not like the "Bravo six, going dark" meme is from Mario either lol.
---
Just wanted to throw some random memes I thought were funny in there :)
---
Pig mains are so funny. I was looping a Pig around for a couple minutes when I jumped over a recycled pallet and she M1ed but somehow I didn‚Äôt get it. Then she ran around and I had nothing else to do so I tried to 360 her, she just stood there looking at me while I looked at her acknowledging how much of a fail it was, shit was hilarious. Then she walked over to the pallet and hit it, so I walked and vaulted over to let her catch and pick me up mid vault. Wouldn‚Äôt let me clip it sadly but fuck me I was laughing so hard she legit just stood there, was very embarrassing
---
I don't even play this game anymore and posts like this still annoy the shit out of me. Imagine being so narrow minded that you can only see a world where the perk does what the text describes.
---
First of all, BT+DS is absurdly strong when used correctly by a good team. It's extremely rare to see it used well, but you can 1000% be forced to deal with both without tunneling. 
---
Hypothetical situation (vanilla M1 killer, power obviously affects a lot but the same principles apply across the board, and vs. a well above average SWF): 
---
1. Find Survivor #1
---
2. Survivor #1 has every option on the map available as they're the first survivor chased. Because it's SWF, he's able to actively avoid generators. Due to this, he doesn't have a super crazy chase, but let's say you down him as the first generator pops.
---
3. You hook him in a jungle gym, by a jungle gym, by a doorway, near a pallet. Anywhere really.
---
4. You turn to leave, check BBQ and see two people on separate generators but don't see the third.

5. As you're walking away, they unhook \~20m from you. You know those generators are going to get completed by the time you walk to them (as one is already done), and you have two people behind you. Should be obvious the unhooked player has the BT buff so you go for the unhooker (ignoring them isn't really an option, as they're both going to now go work generators and you're about to chase players not working on them).
---
6. You go towards the unhooker, he runs under the pallet/around the jungle gym/through the doorway described above with the unhooked player behind him. But wait, the unhooked player stops under the pallet? 
---
This is where hell begins, the player who got unhooked didn't get Borrowed Time in order to keep you from tunneling him, he got it so there was no risk of a trade. And if you're dumb enough to down this guy, and waste the 15s for BT to wear off, and then another additional 45s for DS to wear off (oh btw, if you camp the slug the game is over due to generators, and if you leave him they don't have to stop doing gens because he'll pop up with Unbreakable). So... you just are forced to pick him up? Try to get around a body blocking player who actually makes the loops longer/shorter, stops you at pallets? What about if it's at something like Cowshed where they can actually block you permanently? Do you just afk for 60s and let another round of generators go up? Do you just say "fuck this" and leave them at the start? 
---
No, DS and BT's effects are fine. They're above average on their own, great when used together, and absolutely game breaking when used effectively by good players. And if you think this situation requires cosmic luck for survivors to pull off, you're insane. 
---
&gt;Adrenaline: if the killer doesn‚Äôt apply nap pressure enough then the survivors deserve he adrenaline buff
---
This is actually hilarious. Let me get this straight, if all of you are on death hook, every pallet has been used, and all of you are injured: I didn't apply enough map pressure, so you should all insta heal to full and get a Sprint Burst. Right... 
---
There are no crutch perks. There are just perks. They can be weak, they can be strong, and they can be very poorly designed. NOED falls under that last category. It's poorly designed, and it's not healthy for the game. It's a strong perk as well though, just like DS/Adrenaline/Borrowed Time. 
---
TL:DR &gt;!Don't hate a player for using a perk. Hate BHVR because they made the perks in the first place, and refuse to change things people constantly complain about.!&lt;
---
I get that its annoying but its just simply better to chase the weakest survivor. Good killers are always gonna go after the weakest target and that is probaly never gonna change. If it annoys you that much then use ds.
---
I remember playing against a pig and twice in a row, I‚Äôm hiding in a spot and looking in the direction of where I hear her and then suddenly, my Feng starts glowing red and I‚Äôm all like ‚Äúdafu- AAAAHHH‚Äù
---
Sry, I meant dc from game instead of afk
---
Every platform has the ability to take high resolution screenshots, there‚Äôs not excuse for posts like these.
---
Something to add, the better your rank, the less killers actually fall for the locker tactic with DS. As an alternative, just run to any gen with decent progress and work on it. The killer will tunnel-vision so hard to stop you from working on the gen, grab you, and get DS'd.
---
Most killers who make gen grabs just assume you're braindead to have actually gotten grabbed, that they forget about DS.
---
I sent a message to the killer after the game and he said he'd never seen it before.
---
Could be. Cahlaflour is in the neutral section. But Oh Tofu talks loads of shit. I am pretty sure Cahlaflour knows the TR of the Killers, Tofu has more than often proofen he does not ( Just one of MANY examples) Also, chalaflour doesn‚Äòt harass people with her Fan Community and she doesn‚Äòt make Guides, wich Oh Tofu does. ( Ridiculous ones also, exspecially if you compare them to the Guides of Ardetha, Tyde or Otz...) But thx for the Tip, I will watch that Guy later...

It‚Äôs a bug that came out the same time Freddy got rereleased. Something to keep in mind is that every update breaks the game in some way or another.
---
honestly I'm the guy with prove thyself and we're gonna live forever
---
Tunneling i/s when you hit a survivor more than once in a match
---
I assume all bad killers have NOED so plan in advance
---
I wanted to move away from the idea of an exposed perk to an aura. But this perk is an actual "noob perk". It's just people don't bother to counter it and clean totems. I literally run a perk to clean totems when i play survivor, maybe buff small game to reward you after getting all 5 totems or telling you how many totems are left on the map to make it viable?
---
In a game with the odds stacked against you, the winning move is not to play.
---
Killer spends the next 5 minutes camping that 1 survivor, you get 4 gens done in the meantime. He doesn't pip, and learns that this kind of strategy doesn't work. Done.
---
Nope... just a question to the Community. Goal: Find out , if the Communitys and my Opinion is close to each other AND, find new interesting DBD Streamers... love this Game and watching good players play it
---
Play the doctor beyond level 5, and you'll have plenty.
---
But where‚Äôs the o in Halloween? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Now you guys really see eye to eye lol
---
Thanks; I figured it was a glitch but just wanted to make sure it wasn't some mechanic I messed up.
---
What if the Perk would activate, the Killer would still be immobilized for the stun duration, but the Survivor wouldn‚Äôt immediately escape and during the stun time, the time it takes to wiggle completely is slowed down? It‚Äôs probably a dumb idea, but I thought it could probably work.
---
If you really think Tyde Tyme is better at the game than Tofu, then you're list objectively loses all value. Tyde's a cool guy, but he is not amazing. Tofu fucks around all game every game because he knows how boring the game would be if he tried hardcore.
---
Pretty sure they said the **exact opposite** in the freddy rework stream. Minir changes to her base, with a focus on addons.
---
Tyde is a pro but Tofu is wannabe? Wtf are you smoking dude? Also, Monto is a cool dude but every time I play him he kind of plays like a potato.
---
It'd be useless, but for a visual thing having another survivor chase you down trying to kill you would be pretty cool
---
Jendenise is a very large streamer since the game was in beta, so that's a bit surprising if you have experience with this game at all. Ochido has otherwise been banned for a long ass time. Both would be in the toxic category anyway though.
---
Thanks, I love making music videos so I'll definitely be doing more like this. Not sure how many will be themed around games but I'll keep it in mind.
---
There's definitely other songs that fit with the dbd universe anyway
---
I refuse to play nurse without AGI.
---
I meantioned this above i could be posting bullshit but I saw someone say small game wont get a buff cause it will be too op if they added that. But SWF can literally count how many totems they done, so what is the difference.
---
I only need this and medic, its pretty fucked up that i have wounded healer and still dont have medic, its definetly bugged bc even for wounded healer i had to get way more then 50 heals while injured.
---
Because its boring for the survivors and any killer who wants a challenge? If you only exist for that juicy 4k do whatever you have to win but proxy camping is bad makes you not pip/depip much more often too. 
---
And if the survivors are coordinated/SFW they will just genrush you while you dick around.
---
You‚Äôre a flop, you fool.
---
@dbdgonewild
---
Bloodhound is pointless \^\_\^
---
The "wannabes" are not wannabe streamers. They aren't playing to show you how skilled or knowledgeable they are. They stream and play because they love the game and want to have fun and share the experience with like-minded audience. 
---
Lighten up a bit man.
---
This is why people should dodge moris by closing their games whenever they see a secret offering. The only thing that comes out of mori matches is frustration towards the game.
---
Both talk loads of bullcrap and because they are fog whispereres, dbds ‚Äû Community Manager‚Äú take their Voice as Voice of the community. And sorry, what they say is just not true. Or is a balanced Game less important for you than cosmetics. Or would you prefer an Event like hollowed blight over double BP. Na sorry, theres a difference between paulie and panda and the rest in this grp. And puppers cant beat ne , i am not on pc. But he is Toxic Waste
---
What did he say?
---
Youre not alone dude, my first 4 games went:
---
1) Lag switching killer 
---
2) Camped to death by doctor
---
3) Whole team DC'd from the match (found the hatch luckily)
---
4) Tunnelled to death 
---
Then later got hate messages from a swf for not saving them from basement while killer was guarding it 
---
But its just how things are, nothing we can do except move onto the next game
---
Always a pleasure to be of service.
---
Classic DBD response
---
Thats what Im wondering, how the hell did she get over there so quickly.
---
Bring back the victory cube, where a 4k means a double pip.
---
I only do this to toxic assholes who flashlight me multiple times or teabag across pallets or whatever. Then it's game on.
---
The way I see it, someone has to knock some respect into those little shits, and I don't see anyone else around with a machete, so I guess it's up to me to do it. It's even funnier when you get either obvious SWF groups or just really stupid randoms who think "I will stay in the killer's line of sight while my teammate is hooked to lure him away/I will run up and unhook 2 seconds after you're hooked before the killer has a chance to go elsewhere!" Because that's just ensuring I will never, under any circumstance, walk away from who I just hooked. If I hook someone and I know that someone's within spitting distance, I'm not running away (especially if they're just spinning out in the open). You can send me all the pissy, whiny PMs after the match all you want, but I'd have to be an idiot to walk when survivors are being dicks like that.
---
Even if you were in an SWF group, wouldn't you think "I should stay out of sight until the killer wanders off, THEN unhook"? Like yeah, if the killer's camping anyway, YOLO right? But if you get a killer who normally doesn't camp and you then give them a reason to do so, that's on you, not the killer. 
---
As an aside - my job as the killer is to kill, not be your buddy. If your teammates make dumb decisions, like unhooking you while still in my terror radius, then why the fuck would I ever go after them and not you? We've all had it happen to us, we've all had shitty teammates, but them's the breaks. Either toughen up or GTFO, my dude, because it isn't behavior that will likely ever change. Call it a loss, let yourself be rehooked, don't struggle, get your BP, and hope your next group knows how to safely unhook. 
---
As a second aside - survivors - especially SWF groups - ruin so many killers' fun so often that sometimes, when we then get a group that very obviously isn't SWF, we're just pissed off and feeling vindictive and will tunnel the fuck out of people just to get a decisive win. It isn't pretty, but I think it's also happened to all of us at one point or another. 
---
Now if you get the same killer multiple times that does that shit, sure, flip him all the birds you can find, because he's actively being a dick. I'm just trying to explain why a killer might do stuff like that.
---
Haha, i'm really happy consoles get bill but steam does too. ;)
---
Thanks Dad, I'm good.
---
More indicator thank Rank for sure. And with level i meant not ingame. I meant as a player he is higher than tofu. But yeah it doesnt, tofu tried several times, to send his people after guys that said something against him, i saw that and in my eyes he is the trashiest Dbd Player of all of them...
---
Awesome
---
Not Cool

Sure. Go watch tofu guides

This thread is gonna be fun
---
What does SWF mean?
---
Am I the only person who spent their 90% of a first game in a locker
---
Wait! I said I am in the game since 2 years, so i CLEARLY dont know streamers from the beta. And I never said I am filled with experience
---
Nah, I don't DC as a rule as it fucks up everyone else in the game. Sure wish I could dodge mori lobbies without anything on my conscience.
---
I don‚Äôt play xbox so I can‚Äôt have an opinion, but why aren‚Äôt Plague and Doctor higher? A good doc can stomp loops and I‚Äôm assuming he isn‚Äôt too hard to aim with a controller. 
---
Nurse at top tier on console!? Very surprised! 
---
Detailed write up, thanks! I wish console folks could try the keyboard/PC experience. So much nicer.
---
Finally i perfected totem placement üòÇ
---
Just a weak way to approach the game and I go out of my way not to do it since it demonstrates zero skill to hard tunnel a kill off hook and unless they're running decisive there's basically no counter on their end for it.  Just a lame way to play the role man.  I don't mind putting some work in for my kills.
---
Yeah, because stupid one liners make you look like Einstein, brah...
---
I didn't, but I already knew a bit about the game from streamers so that's my experience... though my friend did instantly drop god pallet when he saw it, so...
---
In an extremely unlikely case, its not tunneling since they are literally the only viable target for the killer to go after.
---
So you didn't actually make it then? According to ur title you did. Either way it's pretty cool and quite helpful.
---
Well she's been playing every day since beta also, and is one that most streamers talk about or play with all the time.
---
If you close your game after the offering screen, during the loading and before the match starts, you avoid that bullshit and everyone else is sent back to the menu (match is cancelled). No harm done and you avoid all the frustration.
---
I wish grass didn't cover 80% of your screen when crouching as the pig.
---
I'm sure it'd be funny if their voiceover wouldnt be way too quiet...
---
Is it done purposefully that the first few notes of that are damn near identical to the Dead by Daylight theme, just slowed down?
---
Sorry, no habla  Dutch
---
&gt;tbf, noed is a crutch perk and rewards killers for failing to apply gen pressure. 
---
Does it work for other things too? 
---
&gt;Instant heals reward survivors for getting hit.  
---
&gt;Adrenaline reward survivors for playing the game.  
---
&gt;Borrowed time reward survivors for getting hooked
---
All perks are crutches. Stop repeating this bs. Noed is fine.
---
Iron Will &gt; Self Care
---
Tbf that game died because it wasn't good, not because Jason made for a bad killer. Jason is still a totally natural fit for DbD
---
Since there is no punishment for DCing, you will have to deal with it. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are playing survivor or killer. Until dedicated servers roll around and BHVR will actually do something about it, we are stuck playing with rage babies.
---
To answer your question, yes DCing has always been around
---
This was me when I first started lmao
---
Must be one've them Mexican Jakes... :p
---
I found out there existed a little thing called icon packs, but then again I might get banned for messing with the files so I don't know yet.
---
Well Franklin's is definitely one of those perks that pretty much only exists to be annoying lol. It's not good, it's just really annoying and takes away your items sometimes. Imagine a survivor perk that disables your killer addons. But hag is definitely strong if the hag is good. No shame in dying to hag. I've never seen edgar promote DCing, but almost every streamer will DC against bullshit like facecamping or hardcore slugging or something
---
Nice site.  Thanks! Do you feel adrenaline is warranted even though some games you won‚Äôt even make it to every gen being popped?  I usually run it as well as hope and wake up but I feel they might be wasted slots.  Hope on top of adrenaline and wake up make for an endgame build.  I totally instant the BT and maybe the dead hard.  What about Balanced Landing?  I appreciate your input.  I‚Äôve spent close to 1000 hours on dbd and usually can‚Äôt find anyone that makes sense or back to their words through conversation.  Most are salty, or biased one way or the other.
---
Ok.
---
Well that‚Äôs thing, it‚Äôs not uncounterable, but it is a perk used by shit killers. The absolute majority of killers with NOED I‚Äôve faced have been ones that tunnel and engage in chases for far too long and then complain about getting ‚Äúgenrushed‚Äù when gens are being completed while they chase. If I play against killers that rotate and apply gen pressure most of the time they don‚Äôt have NOED because they‚Äôre confident in their game. 
---
NOED killers defend it to their last breath saying ‚ÄújUsT cLeAnSe‚Äù ignoring that totems spawn randomly and that solo q is a thing so you can‚Äôt communicate. They say NOED makes it so they‚Äôre only using 3 perks until endgame but that‚Äôs not the case. NOED benefits you everytime you use it. All 5 totems get cleansed, thats 70+ seconds of time wasted. They don‚Äôt get cleansed? You get to insta down. It offers way too much.
---
I would absolutely DC in that situation. Totally warranted as there is zero reason to play it out, nothing but a waste of time.
---
It was all a joke my friend, that's kinda the only reason I'm on reddit.
---
explain how no mithers a crutch. i‚Äôm joking, noed is fine.
---
I‚Äôve been getting farmed but other survivors a ton lately and it‚Äôs been insanely frustrating. The other day I had a game vs a Freddy and a Claudette unhooked me when the killer was about ten feet away. I obviously got downed and watched as the same player hid right next to the hook. They unhooked me again when the killer was right there and usually when this happens I get downed as the easy kill. Nope, the killer went out of their way to follow this toxic player, downed them and the quit pretty quick after that. It also was a great game where I barely made it out the exit gate and everyone said GG. Thanks random Freddy for restoring my faith in killers.
---
The chest in the basement is loud enough to blow out your eardrums. It‚Äôs gotten me smacked a number of times.
---
Ahhh okay. Makes sense now. Thanks!
---
We‚Äôve been done here. You‚Äôre too biased to have a meaningful discussion
---
Puppers isn‚Äôt toxic at all and what‚Äôs with all those people in the ‚Äòwannabe‚Äô section?
---
Wait, what?
---
Self care inside a locker?
---
Nope...wrong Continent, Dude...what about you...favorite DBD Streamers? Who do you like, who not?
---
I disagree to your disageeeing, GtAV is trash due to the greed of rockstar.
---
If you really that upset I'll delete my post, I dont mean any offense to the things I say.
---
Think of it like a ninja suit/camouflage you are not supposed to go into the open, walking between the enemies thinking you are invisible.
---
all the other killers props are not supposed to do anything except buy you some seconds of confusion at the beggining of the match, they can even be discarded and not much will change.
---
The purpose of such a killer would not to walk towards others survivors like "Hey, hello fellow survivors, let's do gens" it's purpose is to sneak on survivors, to not be seen until it's too late. the survivor costume, is supposed to create confusion, not to fool survivors into thinking you are one of them. and this:
---
&gt; And would not trust their teammates if they're a solo queue,
---
actually seems like something good for the killer. this is the kind of confussion a shape shifter is supposed to create.
---
&gt;like why is he faster when crouched? 
---
In my idea, it is supposed to be 100% or 110% speed while crouching, while normal running speed would be 110%.
---
and to be honest I don't know why ghostface or Amanda don't have at least 100% speed while crouching. crouching 100% speed is actually Nea's Urban evasion speed.
---
Why does he get to do all survivor actions?
---
Mostly to play around and to a lesser extent to make it somewhat more convincing. also if it could go into lockers it could make it more stealthy.
---
Sabotaging gens? killers can already kick them
---
To make it look like he is working on them, of course the kick action would be on the killer form. and sabotaging gens should be faster than normal regression, so it could work as a way to keep gens undone.
---
So I still think a shapeshifter would work, but not like people want it to, but more in a "ninja" kind of way.
---
Maybe Paulie and Hybrid could go in Neutral?
---
I will say I agree that Ussylis does try to be an "educational" player but from the few vids I have seen...,, not quite it lol.
---
Don't know Stray Wolf though.
---
Territorial imperative has a range you must be outside though
---
Settle down, Hank.
---
Because it saves your life so many times.
---
I always give final guy hatch so long as gates aren‚Äôt powered and I‚Äôd prefer to give it to someone who was looping me all game or I didn‚Äôt see at all. People who run no mother bough get special treatment just for the meme.
---
Still better than Legion.
---
and theres a hook right there as well
---
reminds one of the maps in a shooting game called point blank &lt;/3
---
I consider everyone Toxic (as a Surv, killer , you have to do other Things, i am 50/50 Player, btw), that animates People to SWF Gen Rushing! That is in my opinion the most Toxic Thing in this Game and fucks up the experience for all! And it is for sure not "how this Game is supposed to be played" They don't do Bones, then cry about Noed, they don't Heal, call People with Self Care noobs, they don't crouch, because of that, they bring Killers to their Victims, but they run away so the other can eat the soup they made...That is Toxic Behaviour for me, and Puppers is not only one oof the Most Toxic, the only two I know more Toxic than him are Ochido and noob3...
---
GTA is great fun if you like to pay lots of real money. Destiny is pay wall after pay wall. BO4 is fun but gets boring quick, not worth the money. But siege.. I love siege. It ain‚Äôt flawless but I have a load of fun.
---
I don‚Äôt know how this is work It looks like lag switch.
---
Campers that happen to get kills don't deserve their pip.  This is why the devs made the rank system the way it is.  Is it perfect?  Hell no!  But it does help keep camping, tunneling trash out of red ranks or it at least makes it take a lot  more games for them to reach it.
---
Haha Morf_uk is my favorite to watch live time &amp; time again. I was referencing him calling every Jake he comes across "Mexican" though that is clearly not Jake's ethnicity.
---
Farmer John actually uses a lot of Morf's terminology, I'm pretty sure he watches Morf quite frequently too.
---
I am not doing ANYTHING to ANYONE, I am just stating my opinion and for me, Puppers belongs to that section...
---
Because you're not supposed to kill everyone as fast as possible. The entity feeds on hope. Three people on hooks at the start without any gens done doesn't leave any room for hope. Ideally, you need to play in a way where you have one person hooked early, and are clearly in a chase with another. This still gives hope (Hey most of us are alive and fine!) while also prevents gens from being worked on. The hooked person can't work on gens, the chased person can't work on gens, and the person going for the unhook can't work on gens. Keep this type of rotation in play until 1 or 2 gens have popped. This sparks hope (We're doing alright!), then you can go for a kill. 3-4 gens left with 3 survivors is tough, the hope starts to dwindle, but it isn't impossible. Focus on chasing, if you're chasing one person now while another is hooked, no gen progress is being done unless they are sacrificing the hooked teammate to finish one more gen. At that point, they may go down to 2/3 gens left and only two people. This is the point where the only hope they may have is the hatch, and both your chasing and gatekeeping will be good enough to impact the pips.
---
Seriously, this mouth is so big, it could swallow a black hole
---
but what has he done to be in that section? i genuinely want to know.
---
Panics? Nah they start to get ballsy and go for totem instead of door.
---
It was a Legion. I think they were a new Legion, since they had trouble with timing the knife hits. It‚Äôs the only reason I ran them around for so long.
---
u give a fair point honestly, and i‚Äôm going to have to say it. noed is perk used by players who are bad and can‚Äôt control gen pressure and chase one survivor too long. and it‚Äôs used by players who are playing shit killers *coughs in v1 freddy* but to think noed is a perk that is overpowered and is a perk that‚Äôs uncounterable means ur a bad survivor. if i see that fat skull after beating a killer without being dead hook i‚Äôm going for that totem then the save. odds are the killers gonna be camping cause he relies on noed and camping for a kill, so it gives u every opportunity to get the totem. if a killer gets a 4k cause u can‚Äôt handle noed and then u complain about it, ur a shit survivor. yeh it‚Äôs fucking annoying as shit, but it‚Äôs balanced.
---
It‚Äôs part of the toxic circle of life in DBD. Look how many new killers come in asking how to ‚Äúplay fair‚Äù. Seriously, sort this sub by new and you‚Äôll see this type of stuff asked every day. They try to not play like that because they want to make the game fun for everyone. Then get accused of tunneling camping and teabagged anyways.
---
What do you expect when we have this shitty community? If you‚Äôre gonna be accused of being a shitty killer when you weren‚Äôt, you might as well play like an asshole since you‚Äôre gonna be blamed for it anyways.

The devs ruined the ranking system in 2.6.0. They made changes that 90% of the community didn‚Äôt like and ignored most of our feedback because they want us to play in a specific way.
---
Yup.

also, the trapper was just a normal guy before he got dragged into the entity's realm
---
You get a bonus to the sacrifice category if you hook each survivor at least once. If you‚Äôre using the Barbecue and chili perk, you get bonus bloodpoints for each different survivor you hook up to 100%. 
---
From an efficient killer standpoint, the unhooked survivor might have decisive strike, which takes away a lot of your momentum. The unhooker might also have borrowed time, which again takes away your momentum. The optimal thing after hooking someone is to immediately start patrolling gens, putting pressure on other survivors and slowing the game down.
---
Yeah, I initially had them there...but the Thing with them talking crap and then saying "We (as in we, the Community) doesn't want this, doesn't want that, we want that , we want this 8and exactly in the opposite, i want it) didn't let me Rest, so i put them into a categorie with Tofu. i am really sorry for that! I hope Paulie and Panda can find it in their Heart to forgive me...
---
hag needs more love
---
HAHAHAHHAHAHA
---
I would like to say deceisive strike is very under powered and should be buff so that if you hit it you get teleported to the other side of the exit gate to make up for you getting TuNnElLeD
---
Pretty sure it's a bug but it works
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to say it was bad to get beat by Hag.

You are waaaay overstating the tactical capabilities of an SWF group. Even in a 4 man SWF group, which isn't super common, most of the time 4-mans don't have the coordination to shut a clone killer down completely.

YES, some SWF groups could. But those groups already DO shut down killers. The vast majority of 4 man swf's are just dudes in a discord BS'ing around while they play, with the occasional "I am being chased, do gens". BET that a clone killer could still trick a 4-man swf group a few times a match.
---
And 2 or 3 man SWF groups? Forget about it, there is still so much room for clone shenanigans to work in that scenario.
---
I don't even really care about getting a clone killer, but it could work, and SWF wouldn't just shut it down. Not anymore than it already with the current killers.
---
That's why I only bothered to get the quick and quiet teachable off of meg
---
But it isn't a joke...
---
Lol yes
---
Real Poop Man
---
I certainly don't feel dread, annoyance if anything. I rarely see anyone use moris in a way that doesn't just feel shitty.
---
 "Oh boy, they unhooked, time to omegablink back to the hook and kill this person right away. As a nurse with ruin and NOED, if I don't kill them now I can't possibly win!"
---
Your reply was class act üëå
---
Where else would ghostface come from buddy and basically your saying they  didint get Freddy from the movies? And I said before something happened to trapper for him to look that way
---
I always do, why should I spend 10 minute waiting for an already lost game lol, and then the possibility of depip, yeah fucking right lol
---
Generally, 0-1K you lose. 2K is a tie. 3K is a win and 4K you dominated.
---
And that‚Äôs why people hate NOED so much. Because it can go from a 0K to a 4K just like that.
---
It‚Äôs all up to you though. For me, I go by points. If I get 25K points, all BBQ stacks and a 0K, im good with that. We all had a good game.
---
That was an excellent rebuttal. I'm never that articulate in the moment lol
---
It‚Äôs possible in kyf, it‚Äôs just hard to do
---
Their profile had a few LGBT flags and supportive words. Really disappointed with people like this in our community making the game worse for everyone else. It's 10-15 minutes of your day if a match goes poorly, sometimes even less if it's REALLY bad.
---
when you do a swf without looking at their ranks and end up being with a bunch of rank 20s against a smurf account killer.
---
Exactly! Right now, its almost impossible to double pip as either side without the match being exceedingly close (survivors need all gens done, multiple unhooks, multiple long chases, Killers need 9+ hooks, and numerous chases).  These extremely close matches should be the black pips, rather than double.
---
I wonder if the game could move to a more oppositional pip system.  It wouldn't necessarily have to be a total rework, but essentially rewarding one side for denying the other sides success.  I imagine getting bonus points in each category based on how low the opponents comparable category is (if survivors have low evader score, give killer higher chaser, if killer has low malicious, give survivors a bonus to altruism).  It doesn't have to hard limit the number of pips gained/lost each game, but it could push it towards a more sensible average.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it was a rubber mask but The Entity pulled an Epic Prank‚Ñ¢Ô∏è on her and made it a real head
---
Like I said, complaining about ANY Perks is completely obsolete... " Imagine a survivor perk that disables your killer addons " yeah, thats not Logic. the Add Ons are supporting Powers, that you have. Surv Add Ons boost ITEMS that you are wearing with you. Also, there are Boxes everywhere in the Level, etc. etc.
---
Ghostface came from scream movies just like Freddy and Texas chainsaw and Michael Myers came from their own movies so your point is wrong they didn‚Äôt make the character idea themselves and I also said something must be wrong with trapper to make him that way end of discussion
---
They are 2 of a multitude of Fog Whisperers. And even within their core group of 6-8 Whisperers that BHVR communicates the most directly with and flew out to Canada for testing, their opinions are worth no more nor less than any other Fog Whisperer in that group. Even within that small group I assure you there are dissenting opinions that help BHVR balance the game better as Panda's opinions are taken equally in consideration with Vince's differing opinions, or Morf's, etc...
---
Wait, is this all about Panda voicing his support of the planned cosmetic tree or whatever that system is called?
---
Survive With Friends, it's a pretty common term so I'm guessing you're new to the game or the community, maybe both.
---
If you see at the end of the match as a killer, your body gets disolved as well. so even the killer and survivors bodies are made by the entity, so probably the entity gives them a body that would be fitting to the killer's aptitudes. in case of guys like Evan a big strong body is more fitting to them, or maybe he was 7 ft tall in life. I mean i have coworkers that size.
---
they needed Susie.
---
Anytime this ever happens where I'm Amanda and I get spooked a survivor snuck up on me I usually let them run away with a ten second head start cuz jesus if my volume and huge screen can't catch them they're some kind of ninja,,,, or just that I'm very violently blind lmao
---
Sprint Burst and Urban meta?? Borrowed Time, Iron Will and Dead Hard/Balanced Landing are all way better and widely used by good players.
---
Also, Facecamping and slugging are normal Techniques to play. Imagine People complain about Palett Looping and Juking...wait...

I watch a lot of these peoples YouTube videos instead and if you want to get educational content you should probably watch videos so you know what umyou get
---
no they legally do not have the rights to the scream franchise, only the mask and the name ghostface, this is a completely different ghostface from the scream movies
---
I think they should make the option for KYF, afer all, that is pretty much just playing around.
---
technically that could be teleportation via the entities
---
I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs any shame in dying to Hag. 
---
Edgar wasn‚Äôt acting like he was just annoyed. He acted as if the only reason the Hag won was because of Franklin‚Äôs and that Hag shouldn‚Äôt have been upset that she had to go against three flashlights and three meta builds just because she had Franklin‚Äôs. He was definitely trying to make the player feel bad.
---
Aha, Lol, cool. I am sorry, i just thought "WHAT?!?" Will check out this Morf Guy, thx
---
Serbian Water-Fuck.
---
Or Survive With Friends, depends from the regions.
---
People keep bringing this shit up like it‚Äôs constant, I‚Äôve had WAY more matches where I was survivor and I just got (or someone else did) tunneled or face camped for no reason then I had matches where I witnessed teabagging or flashlight spam. It‚Äôs like this subs scape goat for shitty killer behavior. Mind you I‚Äôve been playing near constantly for 1 1/2 years.

Your taking this way to serious dude honestly I‚Äôm done not that real

What's odd is lately my survivor matchmaking times have been like 5-10 minutes and my killer matchmaking times have been like 1-2 minutes. Same rank and all lol
---
DS is a bad perk. Just gonna leave this here.
---
It could, but considering what the entity can do, it is not farfetched to believe those weird bodies both survivors and killers have are made by the entity.
---
And I Oop-
---
watch his Videos...he supports toxicity...cries about SWF, Adrenaline, Mettel when he plays Killers (once a Year) and then cries about Noed, Ruin and other Perks when he plays Surv. He runs around the Level, leads the killer to others and calls them Noobs when they die BECAUSE OF HIM. He Bodyblocks other Survs until the Killer comes, etc. etc...

Get the perk BBQ &amp; Chili from Leatherface, get it on a Killer you enjoy playing, and then play the game and try to get 4 stacks of BBQ every single match.
---
They're definitely all fun, absolutely. they're all great games. it's just some require so much post-purchase money it just isn't a viable option for me

That has nothing to do with my point, but I appreciate this attempt to bait me into a pointless argument. I respectfully decline.

Cool cool cool, except the most basic teachable on Dwight completely and utterly destroys this killer let alone a full SWF group.

You never know! I tried to dial back how uncaring Rose was in the previous version so she cares for her sister, though she'll never admit it. Rose is an example of nature vs nurture; she's internalized the hatred from her environment but has a good nature at her core.

I think survivors underestimate just how hard it is to see them sometimes. I just got out of a game where two survivors DCed  and I ended up chasing a red robe david with a medpac all game. The Claudette accused me of tunneling. I literally did not see her for 90% of the match.
---
I see this and immediately think Mario Cart 64.
---
I really wish that they'd just write down numbers instead of using these vague terms.
---
It‚Äôs actually not movie ghostface, they couldn‚Äôt get the rights to the film so they got the rights to the original mask. They‚Äôre already walking a thin line with this and adding something in reference to those movies might cross it.
---
I think some people here have reached the point of insanity in their belief that a new, fresh, exciting game mode would somehow hurt the game.
---
1 word and 1 acronym. Bond and SWF.
---
I didn't understand what you wanted to say to me. English isn't my native Language , you know. Keep it simple or try to explain, the sintax in that sentence of yours doen't make sense to me. Why is there standing a "instead"?and everything after it doesn't make any sense, In my initial Comment i said, i am searching for new Dbd Streamers, because the one you find in the "PRO" Section have to less output for me (except Tru3). What is that? " if you want to get educational content you should probably watch videos so you know what umyou get "???
---
Actually pretty helpful! Quality post.
---
The point is that survivors don‚Äôt get rewarded enough, mostly due to it being hard to get survival BP
---
I don't like playing Myers very much (Although he's still one of my favorites if that makes any sense) but I LOVE how he turns survivor's stupidity against them, like if people start teabagging and flashlight spamming as you completely suck them dry, especially if you're running Tombstone.
---
I heard as much, explains why he wears leather in the game and not cloth. It's a shame really.... There was so much fun potential.... Maybe the ability to take off the costume and be a random survivor.... So... Much... Potential....
---
The guy is a douche but LGBT can be edgy... Just saying...
---
Literally all you need to say is when you see a survivor ‚Äúhey guys is that one of you‚Äù. You don‚Äôt need to be some sort of tactical mastermind to ask that question quickly.
---
And my point is that Killers get rewarded better on average because the role is more difficult to perform well in.
---
Why not call him 'the ghost'
---
Well its more of a shitpost then anything else
---
First of all umyou was a typo sorry about that. What I meant was that maybe you should watch some YouTube videos a not just streamers.
---
I tunnel vision kill anyone who points out teammates. Those fuckers dont deserve to be rescued, the only type of survivor I will babysit at the hook to make sure no one rescues them.
---
At 3:20. How u know they were hiding in a locker. What tip you off to know there was someone in that area. Please tell me. Everytime I use a locker I get discovered quickly. I slow into the locker.

It felt great.

No, you're just a child (mentally, I'm not sure of your actual age) with the whole insecure tribalism thing going. "OH NO! SOMEONE MENTIONED A COMPETITOR TO MY FAVORITE GAME! MUST ATTACK".

I‚Äôm just pointing out why queue times can be bad and would get worse. I‚Äôm all for a new game mode in spite of this.

She left scratchmarks not too long ago and was trying to get the gen done. I knew she couldnt have made it out the vicinity in time without sprinting and because I couldnt hear her breath or find her, I figured shed be in a locker.

Slenderman with Invisibility such as Freddy Krueger (before his rework), and the ability to reveal himself whenever he wants? And slenderman obviously moves when we saw the movie or the trailer, idk.
---
[For reference](https://youtu.be/k1NY9RXNKZI?t=101)
---
Although the trend is dead I personally think it's a cool idea
---
&gt;facecamping and tunnelling is not toxic. it's annoying but it's a valid strategy. logically speaking tunnelling actually makes far more sense than going for separate survivors since it gets one survivor out of the match fast. and if the survivors are being overly altruistic and don't do gens while you camp then camping is the best strategy.
---
Again I'm not saying it's fun, but people do it for a reason, and that reason is that it works.
---
Behavior continues to wonder why Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike are some of the most run perks in the game when camping and tunnelling is so common.
---
DbD hasn't been my favorite game for a long time but even if it was I don't think something like Hide or Die could be considered competition
---
While both suck... you actually have a better chance at winning with a killer who face camps. Because while he sits there and stares like an idiot, your teammates can be on gens. While he's tunneling you, your teammates can be getting gens.
---
It is bad at high ranks but a low ranks oh god the tunneling campers
---
I actually really like the concept of Slenderman in this game but he is sorta otherworldly ya know and how would he attack. Would he make you insane then slap you with his tentacles or what.
---
This was really creative and I totally loved it
---
'Aight.
---
You have to admit the add-on's too strong, though?
---
You only get surprised the first time when you don't know she has this addon, then you can just play more careful and play around it.
---
Yeah its disappointing that such a good game is in hands with these lazy devs

Lettuce hag over here looking edible
---
I literally only hate him bc the majority of bubbas I face, indsidious camp my team or tunnel.
---
I read your post dude.  Just a whiny salt post about a perk that quite honestly isn't that big of a deal to play against at all.  Short of a Nurse maybe it just isn't that irritating to play against.
---
That's a fault with the game. I believe BHVR is still actively working on making their pipping systems better. Its not an easy task, because being efficient and just being given kills by boosted survivors is a very minute difference in the eyes of algorithms. Not that you shouldn't pip from killing boosted ones either, but if you get a hard earned victory over a rank 1 swf group vs a victory over rank 13 randoms it can be difficult to know if they were just bad or if you were good.
---
Ok that‚Äôs understandable but you can‚Äôt just say that spirit does not have counter play even tho she does.
---
I'm fucking done of people who say "uSe sPiiNe cHiiL". You are not supposed to use the same perk every fucking game just to counter a possible killer with a possible add-on. And don't start saying "but spine chill counters a lot of killers" but the fact is that I shouldn't have the need to use a perk just to counter a damn broken add-on.
---
Do you speak german , engels?
---
‚Äúsigh‚Äù
---
*unzips pants*
---
I think make your choice is one of the worst designed perks in the game... you should be incentivizing killers to move away from the hook and protect their gens with things like chili, not having them come back bc of an exposed effect. 
---
The killers you mentioned I 100% agree with, this perk was designed for m1 low mobility killers in mind and even then I think it's annoying af. Sometimes taking an m1 as a survivor is important and make your choice definitely hurts your diversity of options. 
---
I think the perk is essentially the anti-decisive when you think about it.  Having killers not go after the one injured was too complicated for bhvr to figure out without adding the perk.
---
It's one of those things that is definitely balanced on some killers, but others can easily abuse it.
---
That Pig outfit looks like 1999 Matt Hardy
---
Devour Hope doesn't do that anymore lol. They changed it so now you have all of the effects at level 1, 2, and 3. The only thing that is changed is the haste percentage.
---
Oh of course not. The game has always been fluctuating levels of bananas lol.
---
But I would take the current state over early days 100%. 
---
My point is, out of all the Fog Whisperers, there is no evidence that anything Panda or Paulie have stated had any more or less of an impact on changes within the game since they became Fog Whisperers.
---
There was a small group of the most notable Whisperers that were invited to BHVR studios earlier this year, I think. They included Panda, Cahla, Morf, and Vince. I guarantee that if you were to give each of those 4 surveys about their opinions on game mechanics and changes, you'd receive many different responses.
---
Yeah you read it? Because you completely talked about some other shit "don't heal" she's already back at the hook 4 secs later you stupid POS that's the whole fucking point of this post, and sure you don't have problems with it at rank fucking 15, nobody gives a fuck.
---
What were the responses he said? He deleted them
---
ehm...what exactly is disingenuous on asking for peoples Opinions? I have no tyde Love! I am just not bashing him, like all of you do!
---
I haven‚Äôt played in almost a year so I wouldn‚Äôt know my bad.

Hahaha I honestly love you. A real cool dude, telling it how it is.

Would love to see your opinion on FunGoose, he refers to himself as "the best educational DBD streamer". I'm not sure how I feel bout him myself.

---
Lol jesus christ you people are predictable in assuming people that don't agree with you are a low rank.  I've been a rank 1 survivor far more times than you most likely.  Make Your Choice isn't a perk to babyrage this hard about man.  You need to work on your unhook game if you're getting trashed by Make Your Choice this consistently that you had to take to reddit to rage about it.
---
He has add-ons that help his steering. What rank did you play him as?
---
Let him enjoy beating what he sees as a toxic swf. I dont have a problem with it so let people enjoy things.
---
noice
---
I‚Äôve heard about this too.
---
I take it you never played as him. Billy's turning is fine, even with both add-ons.
---
I watch Puppers when I am bored and he is pretty toxic honestly. Like a watered down version of Noob3.
---
Cake day is your reddit account creation anniversary; it is not your birthday.
---
That is complete BS. He doesn‚Äôt do any of those things, stop lying.
---
I know that streetwise and Prove thyself don't...
---
&gt;Lol it takes no skill. I‚Äôve played him and I literally watched this guy corner around a whole boulder.

You've played against him, not as him. Try and perform these corner turning and then come back to say it is easy.

Pig strats: when crouching, literally always be looking left and right for a 180 degree cone. You miss so much shit if you aren't shaking left and right.

False. Spine chill is an indescribably valuable perk and I never do not have it on.
---
This. If I‚Äôm the only person coming for you, I‚Äôm unhooking you regardless of where the killer is so we have a chance of surviving as a team. I‚Äôll take a hit for you but if the killer elects go after you, then sorry, that sucks, but you were going to die regardless.
---
They answered your question legit, don't heal at the hook just leave immediately and find a way to make sure they can't see you. Or, if you're competent at looping, just avoid getting hit until the timer runs out. And besides camping refers to staying at the hook so the hooked person can't escape, and tunnelling would be going after the person who was unhooked. If you're the person unhooking and get downed by make your choice then that's a perfectly valid outcome.
---
For survivor run wglf and Prove thyself

‚ÄúThe spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.‚Äù

An example from 4 months ago (Probably footage across multiple dates) of high billy controller sensitivity on mouse and KB. He's NOT using turning addons and he's able to pull absolutely physics-defying turns. 
---
Reminds me of a similar exploit in Helldivers, where the game used pressure sensitive shoulder buttons for stuff like full-automatic fire or driving. They added a Veteran Controller mode designed for people with worn out controllers because the shoulder buttons can sometimes not work as well as they used to. 
---
It basically worked by doubling the received input so a half-squeeze fires in full auto, etc. One issue was they forgot to cap the input for vehicles, so people with the mode turned on with a fully-functional controller could drive really, really fast.
---
My to I had to play against 2 rank 2s and a rank 1 playing with a gray rank. I'm a rank 10
---
I like the idea.
---
To be fair they definitely ARE pretty braindead at BHVR I can't argue there lmao, they're not very good at balancing anything at all. I can definitely see how it would be really strong in some cases, especially with Freddy's new ability to teleport across map immediately. I think it also depends on survivors of course, there'd be some people who could just run about and avoid that killer until the timer runs down but others not, so I guess that'd be where the argument pops up as to whether it's actually an issue?
---
Thank you I 100% agree.

Same, except watching others play on youtube instead of playing myself.

If I wanted to prove something Id made a post on r/science or similar. This is a short video of a game called Dead By Daylight. In the video you can see that me, the killer, brought a rare and an ultrarare add on and a green mori. The plan was kill the obsession asap to activate dying light. You can see in the clip the survivors behavior (dropping unnecessary pallets, teabagging, going for saves in front of me). With dying light, ruin, 3 survivors and 5 gens left, you can see all survivors disconnected. Facts. Not conclusions.

---
Nothing much has really changed about hexes. You break the totem you break the perk that it belongs to. By perks im assuming you mean the large amount of bugged perks that appear every update. The only bugged ones i know of are Calm Spirit killing you faster on hook, Iron will not working sometimes, and Dead Hard not giving you any distance when activated. The meta is basically unchanged because the devs seem too afraid to introduce stronger perks, so whatever you remember being great is probably still the best option.
---
But you're saying that like it affects himself as an individual, just because someone very loosely associated to you through identity struggles with something doesn't revoke your right to make jokes about it or use it as an insult. Because we are all indivisuals. We live our own lives, just as complex as anyone else's; so letting someone else's personal feelings get in the way of what you want to say or think isn't healthy or right. And i'll be damned if I ever let that stop me from doing my own thing.
---
I lost against killer xy and therefore his ability must be overpowered. There's No way this guy actually plays this killer often and knows how to use his ability.
---
No he's just broken and probably cheats aswell.
---
The way I see it it would be far too much information, given to every survivor for free. There would be no risk in deciding to continue working on your generator, because there would no longer be that guessing game of "Is something going for the save right now?"  
---
It would be like everyone having Bond, one of the strongest perks in the entire game, with infinite range, and the only drawback is someone has to be on hook for it to activate.  
---
You would immediately know who's being chased, who's working on a generator or totem, and who's going for the save.  
---
I realise that with a full team of SWF, this is what happens anyway, because most SWF teams have voice communication, but it would *not* be a good idea to try and balance the game around SWF and third party communication software. Many perks would become obsolete and need complete revamps, and it would most likely further affect the Solo experience in a negative way, doing the very opposite of bridging the gap between Solo and SWF.
---
I was about to comment that!
---
True, but it's still not teamwork-based. You don't have to save other Survivors, but it's something that most people try to do.
---
And what is right, I first time here, dis sub is for fanart too, no?

well considering the point system bases off of helping teamates..
---
I used to run the Black Box + Dying Light + Mori Combo all the time although I almost never got it to work and I started using a Shroud Of Separation instead as it's easier to get to the obsession before they can wake up and you lose 'em + often the obsession will flat out DC on the second down and proc Dying Light for me. 
---
I'm glad Black Box is more useful nowadays because the Old Black Box was literally only good for the type of strat you did and nothing else, and that was an Ultra Rare.

I'm not gonna purposely perform substandard to make the other team happy. If I do, it leaves *four fully functional players* alive, EXPONENTIALLY increasing my chances of failure. If I am given the A or B choice, I will take the optimal one. Rarely do I have the reason or room to meme with people.
---
It's based on other factors as well, like completing generators and looping the Killer, so it's not solely based on altruism.

honestly i dont mind the stereotype so long as it stays a joke, like Nea being a killer bc neas a toxic and sandbaggers. they obviously arent, but its a fun joke. its when people take it seriously and are like "I tunneled you because youre a claudette" thinking im playing her to be toxic and "abuse" her "blendette" ability when in reality shes just the only surv i have perks on bc id rather lvl my killers.
---
And then they had SEX
---
A, understood, I was think gore =
---
Im glad you dont have a problem with that. Thank you.
---
... I'm losing you on the soccer analogy. Is the person with an injury playing?
---
And simultaneously, are you going to tell me that the objective of a sport isn't to win? You can have some fun along the way, but most people want to perform at their best. Not underplay just to make the other side happy.
---
Especially if you want them to underplay *literally all the time*.
---
When is this Claudette skin dropping?
---
?
---
I'll watch it tonight and let you know
---
Salt
---
Thanks! 
---
I noticed you recommended Freddy, what‚Äôs the best way to use his power? Unless I‚Äôm reading it wrong, it‚Äôs basically a trap that takes the survivor out of the game for a time? Also I‚Äôve read you can use it to teleport to a generator? How do you do that?
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
And grieving on hook, Facecamping, and shaking your head is rubbing victory in the survivors face so? The logic of this is quite confusing
---
Why not both
---
Okay...watched 3 Vids...His Nurse Perk Build , Ghostface Perk Buil and his Shrine Watch...
---
1: Shrine Watch-Like it, its something else like from Panda, still like Pandas more. Goose is throwing around too much Numbers.
---
2: Ghostface Guide- he did something, what Tofu does ALL the Time, wich is the Reason, i placed him in the wannabe Section:
---
Ghostface is not, I repeat, NOT more Powerful than Michael Myers, that is a Joke! But thats opinion. 
---
What is not is, that GF is "Overbalanced" ( if anything, he is decent, and even if he is, i think 1 or 2 more Killers for the Endgame Players would be good!) 
---
Ghostface does not get slower, when he is in Nightshroud!
---
And if you hit a SUrv, he looses his stalk!
---
That is not a good sign for "the best educational DBD Player"
---
But what is, what I saw in the Nurse Vid. He does something, wich I only until here saw Otzdarva and Ardetha do:
---
He presents his Nurse Perk Build and takes Whispers OUT and inserts Mumur (in my opinion the better Perk, any Detection perk is better than Whispers, but that is another Story. the Key here is: Whispers is not good for Beginners)
---
Make his Guides so, that Pros and Newbies can work with it, is a high Art in my Opinion!
---
I am not sure about that Guy, I subscribed and we will see, in wich Category he comes ;-) 
---
Thx for Leading me!

---
* Content must be directly focused on Dead by Daylight; referring to the game in the title is not sufficient.
---
As I have explained to two other people, this is not a repost. I had no idea the original existed when I made this one.
---
It's strong yes, but too strong, I'm not sure, I'm fine the way it is personally.
---
Okay so fuck off already who made you post this?
---
The fastest it can be is with 2 Survivors healing another whilst they both have We‚Äôll Make It active.
---
Survivors depip the same as killers do, all leaving does is make the game easier for the killer, especially because killers get points for someone leaving mid game. Your logic is not very secure. If the killer is butthurt, the killer can leave, yeah you‚Äôll depip, but you don‚Äôt have to worry about screwing over your teammates, making the game easier for your opponent, or blatantly handing the killer free points.
---
To each their own.  Skill should matter in a multiplayer video game.  Hard tunneling a survivor to death immediately is the great equalizer.  Literally every player no matter if you have 5K hours or 5 hours in can do it.  I want to defeat my opponents and outplay them.  I don't do consolation prize kills.  I earn each one of them.  I realize for some it only matters about the kills though and they don't care about ability, rank. Or bloodpoints.  If that's you it's a pretty unengaging way to approach the game but well within the games rules so have at it.  I don't mind killers like you because I rock decisive every game to make your tunnel attempts as fun as a root canal.
---
What Platform?
---
Reeeeeeeeeeepoooooooost
---
Evil is evil, doesn't matter their sexually orientation, gender, colour, political views, etc.
---
Evil is evil dude, and standing up to it and not talking its shit is its weakness and our strength.
---
One problem: Ash accidentally chanted the wrong ancient simarian bs and teleported to the entity‚Äôs realm
---
I'm not talking about what's skillful and what isn't. What I'm talking about is more about the idea of what should constitute a win. And, in my own opinion, I think a 4k is a total outright victory, no matter the means (bar exploiting and hacking). Therefore, I also think a 4k should constitute a double pip depending on how many generators are done.
---
Love the idea but highly doubt they‚Äôll do anything like that anytime soon.
---
Or spirit? Also asking for a friend
---
You are complaining about a purple quality add on that you have to spend a a fair amount of bloodpoints to get. Honestly, that is the same as complaining about purple flashlights because they blind for way to long and let you get away from killers way to easy and let you save other survivors. Learn to counter play or quit crying.
---
Whenever you call out toxic survivors all the supposedly "good non toxic just trying to have fun with friends" survivors rush in to defend themselves, "Some people do this" - "NO WE DONT, GIT GUD BBY KILLER"
---
Save the best for last is a must
---
Insidious Campers that happen to verse bad survivors should be rewarded a double pip?  I'm sorry man but there is a reason the devs soundly disagree with you on this.  NOED, Ebony, 4 Blink Camper Nurse.  Rank1 here I come lol...
---
I was thinking maybe they could just increase the speed and duration of the saw, but reduce his sideways swinging speed. This will let him curve around tiles similar to Billy, but can still be juked
---
What rank are you at usually
---
For some unfathomable reason I am ALWAYS the 1 with dying light in my swf and I always eat the green mori
---
Some guy had deliverance and he got hooked first, he proceeded to try and suicide, but got himself off the hook. What a mad lad.
---
The Legion is my first DLC character i bought with Iridescent shards. But still thanks. Will note it
---
Green. I don‚Äôt like going any higher than 6 so I try to stay near my friends at 9-12
---
Now this is what I call jump scare.
---
Me right now
---
I understand that, but it doesn‚Äôt make a difference in the end. It just makes information travel faster. Inevitably a good killer will confront every survivor during the match in relatively quick succession, so they‚Äôll all find out who it is, everyone is looking for totems and instinct is to investigate the last place you saw someone get downed - not to mention the perks and items for finding the killers belongings. As a solo survivor, it‚Äôs a bit more difficult but not to an extreme as it is made out to be.
---
It lives!!
---
Idk how it could be made to work, but I like the concept of slenderman always being this watchful figure in the distance. Slenderman doesn't run after people, doesn't chase people down. Slenderman is in the background watching, and then on you mindfucking you.
---
Would probably be hard to balance but something like a combination of the doctors fake duplicate projections and the nurses teleports would be pretty on theme. Like Slenderman stalks from a distance and once the survivors madness is high enough they start seeing close duplicate Slenderman, and anytime one pops up the killer can teleport into the duplicate
---
How does it always trace back to necrophilia what the fuck?
---
Hahaha, this really did make me laugh out loud. Very relatable.
---
i don't need advise about the basis. I brought her to P3.
---
A spirit, obviously who knows the character, can't lose you if you don't have Iron will. 
---
The game become fair again if you equip the perk 'cause it's all aout her reading you. Since survivors don't know which killer they will face and can't build accordingly, it's not something that should be.
---
By far one of the worst decision one can make.
---
For years this is the advice given to killers to counter anything they find annoying. Don't like some aspect of the game? Run a perk to to counter it!
---
But suddenly now that it can be turned back on survivors it's unacceptable 'advice'. Guess people are finally seeing it's not as helpful when it's directed at them.
---
But if you we're doing a gen with them wouldn't you question why it was slower or not getting faster progress like if with a normal teammate?
---
For killers add-ons are single use and go away at the end of the match unless you‚Äôve burned the black ward offering.  Only way to get more is to buy them in the blood web, and the really dope add-ons can be hard to come by in the web unfortunately.
---
I mean flashlights aren‚Äôt even that good
---
You know, I'm a bit worried how much time you've been spending with Father Martin.
---
No offense to the man, but I sometimes worry he might just be a little bit... crazy.
---
Lockers can be occupied by Dwights only.
---
It is actually possible to get 6 gens required to activate gates if you activate the "5th Survivor" glitch in KYF. There is literally a sprite for a 6 in the game. Meaning that 6 gens is possible and 5 Survivors is supported.
---
This thread is literally saying in the nature of a toxic survivor and a toxic killer, toxic killers are worse. This isn‚Äôt a playground argument over ‚ÄúHe was mean first‚Äù it‚Äôs saying in the situation where you are both assholes, one of you is more of an asshole. Survivors can annoy, killers can destroy your entire game and still have time to play afterwards. In the same match.
---
Lol
---
He can play how he wants
---
Im gay
---
Or it could be the game originally didn't have SWF and was balanced accordingly, then they implemented SWF but didn't balance for it. Maybe killers are just waiting for a patch that will never happen.
---
&gt;When you run No Mither and killer have thana 
---
&gt;oh shit here we go again
---
Yes agreed
---
If you knew the basics, you'd know it's not about losing her, but gaining enough distance to make her waste her power and to loop her normally.
---
Basically anyone from Jendenise's/ScottJund's circle of streamer friends is ultimately bad for the long term health of the game. The tl'dr version of it is, the game has become a full time job for them, and you can tell they resent everyone for it. They have no interest in making the game better, only making it more beneficial for "content creation" and trading snide jabs within their Twitter circle jerk if anyone dares disagree with them. Which is hilarious because they'll all mock reddit for being a hive mind, and then turn around and seek backpats and affirmations from their own little communities because they can't possibly be wrong about anything.
---
Ps4
---
The pallet makes this so much funnier
---
Hey i got a solid idea, how about we leave spirit alone coz she‚Äôs fine as it is?
---
I would suggest an anti-heal build as Legion is great at injuring survivors and keeping them injured can allow you to both snowball a match and end-chases faster.
---
Sloppy is great for Legion as its easily applied and forces survivors to choose whether to heal or to stay injured which leaves them vulnerable. 
---
Discordance also works really well with Legion as it allows you to identify when 2 survivors are working together on a gen which synergises well with your power. Survivors may assume you use this perk as its his teachable and decide to not work together on gens. 
---
Pop Goes The Weasel or Ruin both work well on him. The ability to run to a gen with your power works well with Pop. Ruin is always good. You could use your power to get to the totem if you expect someone to be breaking it. Hitting them with Frenzy interrupts survivor actions. 
---
BBQ &amp; Chilli is great for bp and tracking. Legion gets alot of BP due to frenzy granting Deviousness and Brutality so maximising bp gain always works well.
---
If you do not have any other DLC killers then I would suggest;
---
Sloppy - Slows the game down and helps make Frenzy more effective and keeping survivors injured.
---
Whispers or Discordance - Both work well for tracking and helps you waste less time hunting for survivors on gens. 
---
Enduring - Makes pallet stuns less time consuming and since survivors tend to drop pallets on you when you are using Frenzy to try and break you out of it, you can use the pallet stun as a way to exit frenzy without dealing with the fatigue you get after ending the power. 
---
Brutal Strength  - Great with enduring for removing pallets from the game. Can help with chases since survivors are likely going to be throwing pallets down faster if they are injured from Frenzy.
---
Then I‚Äôm gonna just commit Laurie
---
it really do be like that sometimes
---
Well **to be fair some of this stuff does sound kinda cool but in my opinion I still think its useless and won't fit in the game, like this power is really complicated and unlike the other killers abilitys**
---
But like what if you could go in a locker, change into killer form, and then when someone opens it you pop out and grab them? **This concept is cool but doesn't fit the game**
---
I‚Äôve had this happen a few times üòÜ

My friend is on that hook. He told me to leave because the trapper camped all game

I read this in Samination trapper voice.

*dc*

Checked him. Isn't he one of the Fog Whisperers announced together with Panda? 
---
Seems to me like a Standard Streamer, but the Titles of his Vids don't really look promising."Toxic Sabo Player destroys Killer"! "Fog Whisperer abuses Mad grit Exploit"triggers me a Bit, if you watch this Reddit and another Discussion I had, you will see, it hurts a Bit...
---
But he seems cool, his Video about Snow is nice...
---
Thanks guys for the quick replies. My question is answered.
---
well deserved
---
The comment you made earlier and instantly deleted was better tbh, this one tries too hard
---
Maybe get off the internet till the babyrage subsides
---
If she didn‚Äôt have any audio then she‚Äôd be mid tier
---
Because you stomping them was likely cus they were terrible. They got their depip putting them closer to where they belong while you stay and hopefully go against people that should be in those ranks
---
I play both. Killer queue is a lot longer. If you don't spectate, survivors are almost constantly in matches earning bp
---
Or hide and seek, spooky edition
---
Rip to Adam‚Äôs crotch.
---
Eh, I won‚Äôt DC but usually these games are not very fun. At least they aren‚Äôt for me. Then again I‚Äôm sure getting genrushed by infinity loop survivors with flashlights and DS isn‚Äôt fun for most killers.
---
Could you offer some more just for some more options
---
the progress could be faked &amp; after they've finished sabo'ing the gen any fake progress they added would be removed by fake skill check fail that damages/downs the survivor
---
1. Pop goes the weasel and any perk with regression makes the gen regress x amouny immediately upon activation and then slowly regress back to 0% a killer kicking a gen without said perks will just start the slow process from whayever the gen is at now people tap gens during a chase to stop regression while running away from the killer however rapping a gen is not gonna stop pop the weasel from taking away its 15-20% thats why it can only be activated after the killer hooks someone. Also the killer gets a notification for any rished action window pallet throwing a pallet failing a gen etc
---
If you‚Äôre getting that worked up over a game, any game, then you aren‚Äôt really having fun anymore and it‚Äôs time for a break.
---
You aren‚Äôt going to play at your best if you‚Äôre that salty, either. Take a break when that happens and don‚Äôt let strangers get you all worked up just because they beat you and are going to talk trash after.
---
So I'm not the only one? Lmao
---
Probably a good idea. Need to learn how to stop things from getting to my head. I have very thick skin but once I'm pissed I stay annoyed for a while. Gonna play a few Doc rounds later because I find him stupidly fun to play (Mained him for over 600 hours, then suddenly moved on to other killers out of the blue)

---
This happened to me but without the camping, no one bothered to try to get me.  Just like IRL.
---
I feel you, I dont get visibly mad, but Im hooking inside sometimes. So taking a stroll, while listening to either aggressive Metal or Rap like Abstract, really helps to calm back down :D
---
I have 204 Green Med-Kits hoarded so far.
---
I suck too much with him tbh. Get a lot of rant after match bc im bad. Looking to improve. So one day people will DC just because i hit them
---
I don't really get upset playing games anymore after all the salt I've dealt with in 7 years of LoL and 2 years of DbD, but I can be upset about IRL stuff, and feel like I need to vent in a game. But usually I try to convince myself to do something else for a few minutes, listen to music, talk to someone or anything to take my mind off of that one thing. It's understandable to do what you do, but if I do it, I will feel bad about these people that haven't done anything wrong to me.
---
I mean increase the overall movement speed when sawing so that you can actually get people at loops before running out of gas. To compensate, reduce swinging speed so people can still dodge it
---
This is like a text YTP.
---
Yeah I know it takes a few minutes longer which then forces you to be alone, but even then I‚Äôd rather watch my phone for a few minutes if it means I can get loads more bloodpoints without having to do something like escaping.
---
Cleansing totems is under boldness, which like any other BP type, is capped at 8k bloodpoints

I think the issue with bubba isn‚Äôt the stats of his chainsaw, it IS the chainsaw, I feel like they need to change how it works, again, no idea what they would do.

Pretty much.

Unrelated question, you have any favorite cosmetics for each killer? I have 7620 shards currently and I'm unsure what to get for Doc (I either want one of his suits, or the weird steampunk Lord Chloroform one) and Clown (I wanted to get the Downtown Fair one with the tiny hat, but I'm split between that, and waiting for that Elephant Costume to that won the contest to be released)
---
Any cosmetics you especially like for your mains?
---
The first and the latest face off
---
Lmaoooo
---
*What I think is going on* is you're mad that you had a new player on your team and you want to be rewarded for witch hunting that person. You're actually a child.
---
Ohhh  thanks
---
Let them live cause your not trash? It‚Äôs prettt unfair for you as well since your losing your offering and addons (not in this case) as well as a pip. 
---
The survivors aren‚Äôt the only ones that are hindered.
---
I think you are not only wrong, you have it the exact opposite way around. Camping and tunneling are actually moves that advance the game. Teabagging and flashlight clicking are literally only done to annoy other players and worsen their experience. There are a million different cases where camping or tunneling is the correct play, but there is never a situation in which teabagging or flashlight clicking isn't done to taunt another player.
---
If you see a killer camping, just do the objectives ffs. This is a team game and the killer can unsually only camp one player. It is the killers job to sacrifice as many survivors as possible. Camping is, most of the time, just a bad time waste for the killer. If you lose to a camping killer, you are bad at the game, period. In the time it takes the killer to camp one survivor down, you can make a lot of progress on gens, cleanse totems or open the exits.
---
That it sucks for the person being camped is not the killers fault, but his own, because people only count a match as a win if they personally get out. If the killer camps down one survivor and the other three do all the gens in the meantime and escape, THEY have won, not the killer. It is only the survivors own attitude that makes it feel like a loss.
---
On the other hand the killer will allways know that teabagging and flashlight clicking are never the best play, or in fact productive at all. It is a physical expression of the verbal abuse that the survivor wishes to dish out, but is hindered from doing until the post game lobby.
---
I am rank 7 as killer and rank 12 as survivor. Want to hazard a guess which side has insulted me the most? want to know which side stands 5:0 in telling me to kill myself? Which side stands 3:0 in spamming me with frined requests and spamming my steampage? This is all in the last month, mind you.
---
And to finish it off, this is a stupid argument in the same vein as "just ignore them if they bully you" or "have you tried being happy". Camping IS playing the game, just playing it (in most situations) badly.
---
huh, i did not know that, i shall try doing that next time i play Freddy, thank you OP
---
I‚Äôm a very low rank Killer, I just never put in the time or effort but recently I decided to try. I bought Myers and boy does he turn smurfing survivors into tools of his destruction. No Meg you shouldn‚Äôt sit there teabagging me on the other side of that pallet while I hit tier 3.
---
This will also trick survivors, since they expect traps near windows/pallets and they don't always expect them on another part of the loop.
---
Boys we did it.
---
Dude you can.
---
I will never consider noed to be crutch for as long as adrenaline is meta, it's pretty much necessary if you're not playing a top tier killer
---
Maybe on PC
---
this is a bruh moment
---
Kinda new to the community and I always see people calling survivors that use good perks toxic. Are they just not supposed to use their good perks/teachables they worked to get?
---
I only have a level 50 Claudette, and now I'm working on Jake for iron will. I don't have any super meta teachables besides self care, but if I did I would totally use them. I feel like a lot of the base perks aren't super useful, and perks like Sprint burst/adrenaline rush seem really appealing. 
---
There's multiple killers with abilities like 0 terror radius, instant Downs, and projectiles, not to mention certain add-ons and moris, and a lot of times when you ask how to countet something you get a bs answer like git gud, but survivors are toxic for wanting to actually escape?
---
I'm new to the community, but I really don't see why people get called toxic for wanting to win. Please explain
---
No on console you can alsl
---
let's take legion, he wasn't reworked, he was balanced, they took his power, and kept it the way it was, but changed details about how it worked, like how deep wound doesn't go down while you're mending, or within terror radius, etc. legion was the same killer, he felt the same, you just had to use his slightly different. 
---
Let's take freddy, he was reworked. his power doesn't work the same, the way people become asleep is completely different, the debuffs they receive and the way it affects freddy's game play is completely different. his interaction to people who aren't asleep is completely diffrent, the sleep system itself is completely different. everything is different. if i play new freddy the same way i'd play old freddy, i'd lose all the time. however if people play the new freddy the same way they play other killers, they'll do fine. this is why most people are fine with what happend to freddy, and why freddy mains are unhappy now.
---
if bhvr released 2 new killers, one having new legion's kit, and one have new freddy's kit. peope would complain that one of them is legion, slightly different, but no one would say the other was old freddy.
---
as far as kit goes, freddy's kit only shares a theme of sleep. as far as practicality of use. old freddy's kit was removed, and replaced.
---
You can rotate the characters. You need to hold down either (A on Xbox, or X on ps4) and drag the circle left or right.
---
I'm *entertaining* myself if that's what you mean.
---
Hmmm lets take a stab. At it.
---
At the start of the trial there are a set number of slender men in the trial. Anytime a survivor looks in the direction of one of these slender men he moves towards the survivor. Within a certain distance you can then manually control him and the chase is on. If no slender man is being looked at you are running around as a wraith and can inhabit any of them. If a survivor stares at a slenderman he begins to lose sanity. Once all sanity is lost the survivor is put into the downed state. Survivors can recover sanity by using (item) on the map, but it becomes less effective each use. Thats a super simple spit ball.
---
Well shit I wish the game told me that, thanks for the tip
---
I can only wish i could have this kind of outlook next time i bump into a Prayer Beads Spirit or a Shitbilly running nothing but the most meta perks and the addons that allow him to drift like there's no tomorrow.
---
Yeah no... This ability would be too complicated and is nothing like the other killers also why I don't like this idea
---
Well I‚Äôll be damned apparently you can rotate it, but it doesn‚Äôt tell you how anywhere and that‚Äôs still a problem that needs to be fixed.
---
What happened to the last person in the match?
---
Nicr
---
Rip
---
Indeed
---
clutch builds are myths, every build has a 50% chance of success max, but the game is literally engineered so a good killer is supposed to be able gross 2 kills minimum per match meaning survs are damned to already have the base 50% chance of death. Camping isn‚Äôt effective on paper but a killer with the basic understanding of their ability will get the kill, most of the time 2 if they‚Äôve dedicated to camping. You most likely haven‚Äôt dealt with a camping billy or Bubba, two examples of a impossible save if they‚Äôre camping but I‚Äôve seen killers like clown and Hag make just as vicious a cut as well. Dealt with the situation and watched it way more than my fair share, it‚Äôs annoying and not as simple to deal with as people continue to make it out to be.
---
Sounds like what Oh Tofu wants to be...
---
I quoted Ardetha to him, a Joke btw, i said "If someone says Whispers is a good Perk, he propably isn't very good in this Game"...And NOW, these Days, I found the Vid again, where he says that...In the Nurse Guide...
---
but back to Tofu, he was really pissed, wrote Big hate Comments on You Tube, made Vids for 2 Weeks with every Killer having Whispers, wich he not did before that and what do you do, when someone is triggered? RIGHT, you trigger him more and then, after a Time, when it gets close to too far,  you tell him what you meant.
---
It never came to that, because my second try to trigger him, was on Twitter. Again, the same Ardetha quote... He reposted a Picture of my Comment and tried to send his twitter goons after me...
---
Got around 10 Mails, of wich 2 really got personal and pissed me off, by People I never talked to...
---
Handling with User Comment is a essential Part of being a Streamer.
---
And in that, Tofu is a complete failure
---
And that is Reason No 2, why he is a noob for me. The other one I said in my Comment about Fungoose a few Minutes ago...But like I also said, i don't hate him, he is more like an embarassing Cousin or so. But those two Twitter Goons better never see me in Real life...
---
You weren't talking about Tofu, but that just fitted in perfectly. Explains maybe a little Bit more, too...
---
But that about DamnnoHTML is not good...but he was in the Neutral Section, that means, out of 10 Vids he posts, i maybe watch 3...he is not good , not bad...he also does the same as Oh Tofu, he talks, but the Pic is a Pic from him, yes, but you see, he says complete other Things there. I don't like that, too...
---
The point of it being a hex is so you run the risk of losing it really early, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs already so good. Lessening the downside makes no logical sense when ruin is already used by the majority of killers
---
Hey at least now you won't make the same mistake again
---
He escaped because i was just smacking the wall
---
I don't know. It's ridiculous and needs to be changed (alongside iridescent head)
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true, Iridescent shards aren‚Äôt incredibly hard to come by
---
I still wish it would say you can rotate in the shop somewhere so this wouldn‚Äôt have happened
---
How do you know
---
You poor man.
---
The correct answer is: because I want to kill someone and I am a killer and I want the other survivors to do three gens while I do it.
---
So sick of this.  I am a survivor main and I am like, rank 15.  I get camped and tunneled.  But I am also not an infant whining about "MY FUN" so if it happens to me I just play another game.  When I play killer, I will 100% camp if I know it is the only kill I will get and if someone is being a douche bag then I take glee in getting them with NOED and then camping them.  But sometimes I still end up losing them because they break the totem and get the douche off the hook.
---
Why do people think it is such a big deal?  Grow up.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main, actually. I just rock my bloody gear on Jake.
---
Something something something new day, same shit.
---
Or you just bump into a SWF group more coordinated than SEAL team six who genrush you, spam flashlights and tbag you all game.
---
Autocorrect. Either way you're literally making fun of yourself, as you seem to be the one taking dbd too seriously. *Oh I can't bare to be matched up with someone who isnt good at the game, it's not fair!*
---
childish
---
Repost ?
---
You‚Äôre literally ignoring the cusp of my argument being that we don‚Äôt want to screw our teammates over.
---
The perk needs a buff
---
Hex: Ruin. A Hex that affects Survivors' skills at repairing generators. All survivors by *Ruin*, which causes the following:
---
Good skill checks result in 3/4/5% regression on the Generator.
---
Great skill checks grant 0% bonus progression on the Generator.
---
*The hex effects persist as long as the related Hex Totem is standing.*
---
This is, word-for-word, the wiki description for a killer perk. If you think bringing perks to counter addons is unfun, I invite you to play a game vs survivors who actually do generators without this perk in your loadout.
---
(Almost) guaranteed kill
---
If you‚Äôre camping and I kill myself, effectively the same as a DC except I get about a thousand bp and the game tells me I‚Äôm trash, you still get the points and more time to find my teammates.
---
I have a similar problem, i often reach the endgame and adrenaline procs just fine, but it's usually wasted because i'm either not in a chase to make use of the speedboost, not injured to make use of the heal, or both.
---
I think that is against the rules but not sure
---
Technician so that they would stop fucking blowing up the gen I'm working on
---
I had two games yesterday where a survivor just stood there looking at me as I stalked them.
---
I was running Tuft of hair on the second game. They gave me half the charge needed to get infinite tier 3 before any of the gens were done.
---
I won that game.
---
Honestly feel like this thread was talking about two different sides of people being blatant assholes from the start rather than the response to one being an asshole first. You got my upvote&lt;3
---
If you hook someone near active totem and you know that survivors know its there. Or if you have two people close. Also when you play trap based killer and you are set up in area and hooked someone in it.
---
Preach
---
if you play the new legion how you played the old legion you would lose all the time. If you play legion the way you play other killers you will do fine.
---
The correct subreddit is r/expanddong
---
True true, and if you‚Äôre lucky you can find some cutie online to cheer you up some more ;)
---
So no one can help me ? :((((
---
Well download the app "meme generator free" and most formats are all over it, you can add stickers and text to it as well.
---
I didn‚Äôt say camping was the games fault, I‚Äôm saying that the game is broken (there‚Äôs literally no refuting it, the community openly is aware of it by and large), and getting face camped after being downed by questionable means is icing on the cake. Can‚Äôt react to a killer face camping if you‚Äôre the first one they camp, and you‚Äôre not down to dc or kys because you don‚Äôt wanna be a asshole to your team and give them more time to find and hook the rest of them.
---
Spine chill is an useful perk itself
---
teabag*
---
That's a terrible solution. Why punish people play normally? A full minute per hook stage is plenty long.
---
I think the nurse is the hardest to learn.
---
I find the hag super easy to learn
---
Please tell me that's temporary
---
Technician isn't that bad of a perk
---
it happened once to me, 2 of them were so fuckin' toxic for basically no reason. but when i got them in my team, they were really nice teammates, Claudette managed to blind the killer and took a hit for me so i can escape + one of them used an insta heal on me, i was completely shocked (at first, i thought they were going to sandbag me tbh)
---
Because everyone DC's to keep their most overpowered items.
---
Oh god that‚Äôs a good one
---
Making the intelligent choice is a skill.
---
If you were once rank 8 then surely you know how to play the game quite well? Yes Killers camp/tunnel at brown ranks and Survivors are potatoes but you should still be able to do enough to pip at least every other game.
---
I‚Äôm sorry :( I use it as a relaxer, personally. Sometimes it‚Äôs bad, but I have a fun time most of the time.
---
I got farmed, tunneled and moried FIVE TIMES IN A ROW
---
I mean the devs say that for legal reasons but he obviously is as far as his looks/powers/playstyle.
---
Only one of them can one shot
---
Fuck yeah, y'all look dope as hell! Do you do many cosplay?
---
amazing
---
Judging by the sounds I believe he has already tried this several times with both clown and nurse
---
I still get bloodpoints when that happens.
---
Yeah that will tend to happen usually when they use good addons or their having an off day
---
I‚Äôm in the exact same situation and can not upvote this enough.
---
The nobody shit has never been funny lol
---
I feel you man. I wasn‚Äôt playing and I got to rank 20 on both sides.
---
Rank up as killer? Impossible. 20 minutes of waiting to crush noobs and not get a pip
---
Rank up as survivor? I‚Äôm getting chased for 5 gens, eventually go down and get camped and left behind by others
---
I would eventually get to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ranks, but I don‚Äôt have enough time for that
---
You (the killer) keep your addons when they DC in the loading screen though.
---
Your face is a bit emotionless otherwise its pretty good
---
On the bright side that outfit is dope
---
You both look amazing. Bravo!
---
If you go for other survs after you hook one this isn't a punishment.
---
Yeah they really need to change that :/ it's sad to see people leave, but I hope you come back sooner or later (probably sooner if they change it early). I wish you all the best !
---
Yes the mouse issues did fix however it seemed to take a dumb on my fps so I had to play on low with 0 resolution just to get a constant 60 fps.
---
That isn't permanent is it
---
Only if you erase intent. You are trying to base the effect of being an asshole entirely on whether or not you keep playing that specific game. Being in a game with shitty assholes for ten+ minutes can be far more aggravating than losing five minutes going from lobby/game/lobby. A long miserable game with miserable survivors versus losing in the first few minutes. I argue that being the killer can be far worse. Yes, it sucks when I wait three minutes for a game and get camped out. It's annoying and I obviously am not a fan. However the feeling of being essentially trapped in a game with up to four asshole that are all going to vomit insults at the end of the game? then you wonder why some killers have chips on their shoulders.
---
Watching someone get unhooked and then whacking them immediately back to the ground takes literally zero skill.  If you got to crutch out your kills do so but please don't use mental gymnastics to convince you it requires skill to tunnel off hook.
---
Should‚Äôve changed ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù to ‚Äúto the locker‚Äù
---
Technician isn't that bad
---
Yeah I love the ‚Äúprotector‚Äù outfit (I‚Äôm missing the hat because I don‚Äôt have the shards yet)
---
I just really wish that white symbol wasn‚Äôt there
---
I always let Fengs with cosmetics go
---
Yea I have no issue with mori's like I said I love the animations but so often people who use them use them in a crappy way. Its like when killers complain about SWF who brag about their win when they were SWF so the chances of winning become so much more likely. Someone uses an ebony either its going to be a dull immersed game for everyone or its going to be an easy killer game, and its so annoying when they message EZ like they have won from skill. 
---
I am in the camp of thought that ebony's should only be able to be used on last hook so in theory everyone needs to be hooked twice at least. Still gives the killer an advantage and we get the cool kills but the game is a tad more balanced for both sides.
---
It's a 25% repair _speed_ increase, not a 25% repair _time_ decrease. These are different things. Survivors repair at 1.00 c/s (charge per second), and generators require 80.00 charges to complete. If no greats are hit and no skill checks are failed, a generator will be completed in 80 seconds. However, if the repair speed is increased to 1.25 c/s, every 4 seconds is an extra charge, so 5. Dividing 80 c by 1.25 c/s is 64 s.
---
Thanks :)
---
It isn't mine but I'm sure it is permanent.
---
Its low key amazing on bubba because everyone thinks you're gonna have bbq
---
Im not too sure
---
Sorry but can someone tell me how myers just mori me without being downed or hooked once game just started this doesn't belong here but I'm having hard time trying to figure this out
---
Wow. I guess that was on me, assuming you'd be able to infer from context. I wanted you to realize that  it's somewhat hypocritical to whine about being forced to run perks to counter addons when killers have to run Ruin to have a chance to win at any rank of merit.
---
Swf makes a team of 4 people much better. It gives them coordination and a lot of perks that they would otherwise need to equip to have (alert, bond, empathy, Kindred etc). Situations like someone dying on first hook because nobody saved them or no one doing gens because everyone went for the save thinking no one else would because they are doing gens won't happen. If a member of a swf group finds a totem they can notify their entire team, which means that the totem will eventually go down, whereas in a team of randoms 1 guy finding a totem does not necessarily mean that it will get destroyed within 30 seconds. In general, swf gives you soo many benefits that you would otherwise not have, and highly increases your chances of winning
---
Another man of the trade I see
---
Slender? ~~I made a post about it so I immediately said this  shit.~~
---
I'd like either Slender or Hellraiser, although is it confirmed there's going to be a new chapter?
---
I'm sure they tried bringing jason in already right? Is he still caught up in some lawsuit?
---
How did you not cringe while typing ‚Äúhe started it‚Äù
---
You're right. But
---
1) i think they should also increase time to survs to do a gen, because at red ranks you're gonna have a bad time unless you are using spirit or nurse. You can't totally rely on ruin, because it's an hex perk, and you can get either a very good totem spawn or a very bad one. That would balance things up.
---
2) surv would anyway rush the save because this shitty emblem system cause you to compete with your mates to get points.
---
I climbed so fast after starting to take hits for people. Now im too high ranked for my skills and just hope the killer doesn't see me first üëÄ
---
Blatant fuckery is irritating, what I do at times like that is stand by a gate and immediately open it when the chance arrives
---
Thank you. I actually didn't even know how to do that.
---
Looks great but isn‚Äôt Joey black?
---
I'll be s a d
---
Even if it was something relatively simple like, say, instead of fixing generators, you did the L4D thing and gathered gas cans to fuel an escape car or something.
---
Right? Who would bother watching a rank 15 stream
---
Dead Hard is currently bugged. A fix is coming in a later patch per devs
---
On PS4 if a killer just leaves the game via the pause menu you still get your BP however if they close the game down completely then no one gets BP. Dunno if it does it on every system but I imagine it would. Just a shitty way for a killer to 'get one over' on survivors.
---
Currently, we have two ghost like killers (Nurse + Spirit) and no priest / exorcist characters. Ed / Lorraine Warren  as seen in The Conjuring (while not priests) are good examples of the kind of character I'm talking about, hence the image of Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren. This is just a rough idea of what some "priest" themed perks could look like.
---
Its currently bugged my dud
---
Ok
---
Lmfao I can‚Äôt with that pallet
---
Yeah its a super basic idea.
---
I think you did a pretty good job answering this question. üòò
---
Not really? Balanced Landing and Dead hard, yes, but the "Immersed" meta is fully Premonition, Spine chill, Sprint Burst, and Urban.
---
First time it's happened to me it's a sight to behold
---
Thank you, it looks awesome. I asked because I found it in popular and I didn‚Äôt know what it was. Thanks again
---
It's really dumb imo, but people just hate even being near the killer.
---
What 'bout the perks? Notes?
---
Thats the thing though you can die every game but as long as you play well and do 2-3 gens whilst getting 2 or more hook saves you will rank up quickly. You might not survive the round but that means little to actually rank up.
---
ash williams in his movies just completely demolishes evil stuff with a hand chainsaw
---
Its something  wrong with a survivor that  stares back at myers lol
---
Yep still caught up in that damn lawsuit
---
Between Wraith and Spirit some languages dont have more words for ghosts, but I dont know why they couldn't just call him the face then.
---
The scariest shit is that lullaby of hers is the same one my granny used to sing to me when I was a kid. 
---
I don't know how to feel about that.
---
Boil over is worth it if you are running a build to oppose being hooked. Tenacity, flip flop, unbreakable, and boil over works pretty well imo.
---
Otherwise, yeah, it's a trash perk.
---
u/numb4lyfe
---
This is true
---
I get out of rank 18 yes but sometimes I don't even have time for 1 game a day, so ranking up isn't as fast as I'd obviously like. But again as much as I can level up rank reset comes along and makes all that effort null
---
Thanks. Nice to know (not being sarcastic)
---
I‚Äôve never related to reddit post so much
---
For lulz
---
A first person survivor POV I feel it would be a lot scarier
---
Nobody gets banned for leaving atm, why is that even an arguement?
---
Maybe a hardcore mode:
---
- not possible to use perks, add-ons or offerings with exception of bloodpoint offerings
---
- no music at all
---
- no red stain for the killer
---
- survivors can get stuck for a few seconds on pallets / windows when timing the vaults wrong
---
- Killer's can not see the states of survivors (if injured or not)
---
(Feel free to change / add a few things !)
---
Oh sweet, I might give those movies a watch tbh
---
100% Truth.

Hey man whatever you got to do to get a kill.  If it takes proxying and hard tunneling for you to be able to do anything that's unfortunate but totally within the games rules so you do you.  I just enjoy outplaying my opponents in decisive victories.  It ain't a race I'm not looking to rush survivors off the map on my way to a 17K BP game and a likely safety.  A lot more fun to be so confident you beat them by relentlessly pressuring the map and playing to initiate chases and hooks on new survivors.  But I get how insanely easy tunneling for kills is and get why bad killers do it so you don't have to attempt to justify it to me.  I get it.
---

if you right click on the image and copy image address you'll get a direct link instead of the search itself
---
Just a question to everybody. I see posts like this a lot but the game is still popular. Even though you may get ticked off at the game, what keeps you coming back? What do you like about the game?
---
Nah, I have fun playing dbd (sometimes...)
---
Gimmie an hour or so, ill flesh it out.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cm1awk/level_bug_xbox_one/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
But as mentioned its not that that's making it so unplayable its the constant resetting and loss of that time and effort just to be put back down because I can't play 24/7. So you get back to where its fun again but then its back to having to go full tryhard to get a couple pips and still losing once again. Its not fun to every time I get a chance to play to have to try and rework up to where I once was
---
We get 4 Chapters in a year
---
Dying Light is in my opinion... one of the absolute worst perks in the game. As a design standpoint, the perk literally encourages tunneling and merciless camping to make the game miserable to everyone else. I'm a killer main and I would much rather this get removed than DS or NOED.
---
You can feel free to say that all you want as well. It's not really a game if there are only 2 survivors.
---
Freddy is incredibly fun, he‚Äôs one of my new favorites. His old power used to take survivors out of the game until they wake themselves up, but that came with some severe downsides to Freddy as well and made him the worst killer. Luckily, he got reworked! Freddy can now teleport to generators using the left bumper (unsure of PC equivalent). He can also place down traps or fake pallets that effect sleeping survivors, depending on what add ons he‚Äôs using.
---
If you‚Äôre planning to use Freddy, then good choice! I‚Äôll tell you some perks that work well for him. Because Freddy can get across the map so fast with his teleport, it‚Äôs good to have perks that let you know where survivors are, especially if it can tell you if they‚Äôre on a generator. Perks that slow down generator progress are really good too.
---
**Barbecue and Chili** is really good for keeping the pressure on. BBQ shows you where survivors are after hooking a survivor, so you can find and teleport to somebody immediately. Bonus bloodpoints are really good too. **Surveillance** is another really good perk for both generator defense and finding survivors. If you kick a generator to make it start losing progress, it turns white. If a survivor touches it, it turns yellow for a short time. If you‚Äôre paying attention to it, you‚Äôll know when survivors start messing with your generators and can teleport there, keeping your generators safe AND letting you start a chase. **Hex: Ruin** is a great perk for any character, allowing you to hinder generator progress and slow the game down, just a little bit. The perk can be shut off, but that means it is also very powerful. **Pop Goes the Weasel** is another generator stopping perk that works well on Freddy.  After you hook a survivor, kicking a generator significantly reduces the progress on it. It works really well with Surveillance. That‚Äôs my ideal build for Freddy.
---
Those perks all come from different characters though, so getting them all is going to take a lot of time. I‚Äôd recommend going after BBQ first because of the bonus bloodpoints, followed by Ruin because of how good the perk is. This build also isn‚Äôt a necessity for Freddy. It‚Äôs what I think is the best, but a lot of other combinations will work really well too.
---
Cabbages Hag looking like a real snacc
---
Jane's really sounds like she enjoys getting hit
---
If you did 3 gens and did several saves its hard to believe you didn't pip up.
---
Ohh that's genius
---
the survivor side has tons of babies because you kill them they will baby rage at you. "you were going to lose anyway why not let them live" ect ect..  its in the game people should be able to use this with out hearing adults crying like prepubescent children about a game. xD
---
I dont mean to be rude but fundamentally in most games that have ranked one game a day is not enough to climb ranked. Yes it is possible but as you said some days you can't even play one. My biggest advice to you is to not take the rank system seriously as there is no rewards anyways.
---
That too. Either way, you'll be in a shittier mood
---
ü§î But isn't noed toxic
---
Thank you, i will change that now.
---
Nice!  
---
I had it the other way around. They were pretty ok-ish when I killed them as killer though no gg or such but at least nothing toxic.
---
In the survivor match after they realised I was the killer from before they were pretty toxic in the after chat.
---
They couldnt stand that I carried them. Like I found the hex, I unhooked them 4 out of 6 times when it was safe and killer wasnt tunneling.
---
Also bodyblocked one guy otherwise he would have get caught at the exit. Managed to do 2.5 gens and and and.
---
After the match they were like downtalking everything. I am a killer main and only playing claudette and that this makes me cheap.....and so on.
---
Sad but what can you do ;)
---
I struggle with many self-destructive habits and this is just one of them. :)
---
Lucky you, low rank games are much more fun. Bullying a killer for 10 minutes is fun :P
---
This is me. After a bad day I played 1 game of DbD as a survivor. Camped and tunneled.
---
Broke my mouse that I bought 3 day before that
---
Now I'm using some random mouse I found in my house
---
Had a really rough day at work on Thursday, got on DbD to chill. Every survivor match I was camped, and every killer match I got matched with red ranks that just demolished me. Can be quite frustrating! Lol
---
Fuck yes
---
How do you get the artwork done for those...? They‚Äôre really good. üòÇ
---
I think the L4D style variation of things would be a fun addition.
---
Interesting idea. I really like the second perk.
---
This is a repost FYI lol
---
Husband suggested a new idea for a mode;
---
- 1v8/1v16
---
- Killer has Mori by default. 
---
- Being hooked is an install
---
Makes the Killer much more lethal but gives the survivors more players to try and escape with.
---
*"'Sup"*
---
And this is why I'm saving up 9000 shards again for Adam. Everything for the pebble
---
I have been wanting this for so long lol like a mode that swaps perspectives or something.
---
Except it is.
---
Lol it can be shocking. Their are 2 add-ons; Tombstone piece which will allow you to kill a survivor but will then drain the evil within so Myers will probably go back to tier 2, or Judiths tombstone that doesn't do that. Both take a crap ton of stalking to get to tier 3 with these add-ons which is how you can guess if a Myers is running it. Also with Judiths when they hit tier 3 Myers left hand will be open instead of closed. The scary build is Judiths combined with Fragrant Tuft of Hair as this gives unlimited tier 3 so Myers can just march around and kill everyone. 
---
Against these builds, especially the last one, its best to try and immerse so he can't stalk and then get gens done. If a Myers runs Tuft and Judiths the stalk takes so long it often comes down to their being 1 gen left.
---
1. Halloween (Michael is a decent killer and has only 1 good perk but his power is really fun imo + his survivor, Laurie, has 2 amazing perks)
---
2. Curtain Call (Clown has a mediocre power but he also has 2 amazing perks + his survivors, Kate, has 2 decent perks)
---
3. Shattered Bloodline (Spirit is the 2nd strong killer in the game and really fun to play, she has also 3 decent perks + her survivor, Adam, has one of the best survivor's perks)
---
4. Demise of the Faithful (Plague is a decent one as well, fun power and her perks got buffed recently so all 3 of her teachables are worth it + her survivor, Jane, well... she has decent perks as well but they are kinda situational)
---
5. Leatherface (the killer is awful, not worth it at all but all of his teachables are def worth to get)
---
6. SAW (Pig is, eh, she could use some buffs but she's really fun, 2 great perks + her survivor, Tapp, has 2 decent ones)
---
7. Spark of Madness (Doctor is also awful and has only 1 great perk but his survivor, Feng, has 3 great perks for new players)
---
Dying Rites should be changed. I don't know the exact radius of the Kindred Killer reveal aura effect but it also adds the ability to see all other survivors and no one really uses it. That's why I think that no one would use Dying Rites either. But the rest seems good !
---
Now try to get Adept Plague Trophy :)
---
Not my most shameful either
---
Thank ya, sorry if I came across harshly as well
---
I feel personally victimized by this post.
---
Had a killer do that but didn‚Äôt see me? I wonder to this day whether he was fucking with me or not
---
wait, they were talking shit about you or the killer you've faced?
---
This is T H I C C      R O M E R O
---
I get 4k after 4k as killer, for survivor is took me ages to even get my first escape
---
We already got Ash and Ghostfacethis year, so two more will follow !
---
üò≠üòÇ
---
Sad thing is, as survivor I can *EASILY* pip by doing one gen, pallet stunning the killer twice, and getting one hook rescue. 
---
I could die on one hook and suck ass at long chases, but the pip system would rank me up for doing the bare minimum to qualify as participating.
---
Escaping isn't even on my list of priorities when maintaining rank. Just do a gen, get 2 stuns on killer, and a single hook rescue. Boom, rank up.
---
Well hopefully it's hotter than David
---
*thicc
---
You click the self care icon. But I still haven't figured out how to use insta heals or that beam ability on the map. I have tried everything
---
But is that a graphic thing or is it actually a confirmation?
---
But the post game chat gets a higher chance of survivors being assholes !
---
Calling NOED a crutch perk isn't inaccurate, per se, but with the game being as old as it is, and players being experienced as they are, it's in the same camp as a Mori--without at least some threat of the unknown, killers wouldn't be scary, and toxic survivors would (somehow) be more toxic than they are now. I don't like playing NOED, and I very rarely do, because it's not that much fun--whether you're playing as killer or survivor, if the killer has a rotten game, it feels like you're just feeding into their/your vindictiveness. (I don't much like playing Ruin, either--even though I have to most of the time--because it's a passive perk, and the only feeling you get from it is the disappointment when they cleanse it.) But the endgame is still a part of the game, and without NOED (or you're up against 3-4 Adrenalines), sometimes it just feels like an unnecessary epilogue.
---
No s needed this is how you should play.
---
You should not being so condescending it really only makes you look like a dick. You also seem to not have a very good grasp of how pips work if you think you need to hook different people between the same person to get more points.
---
I never seen a spirit step in a bear trap that would be cool
---
if a relentless unkillable killer goes to hunt, but stumbles unto another relentless unkillable killer... Their fight will be glorious, Until the exit is powered. in which case it'll start getting boring to watch and better be time to dip out
---
I thought the Sanctification one would be about cleansing totems very fast. Cool idea
---
*Gets on dbd* Ah after a long day of work im so excited to play this game again *Proceeds to get bullied and teabagged with 4 decisives, adrenaline, and dead hard. Gets dm‚Äôd about how trash I am. Realizes they‚Äôre red ranks with 5k hours when you‚Äôre a green rank who played the game for 200 hours*
---
Are you just spamming this video in multiple sub reddits?
---
My bad. Jane Romero is so op she can block the killer's vision with her ass
---
Kindred is slightly bigger, at 8/12/16 metres. Letting you see the other survivors Auras would probably be best. My goal was to create a kind of reverse Kindred, like Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike.
---
this is very true
---
These all sound a little unhealthy for the game if I'm being honest
---
LOOOL
---
I still won so it doesn't matter what they say
---
That would be pretty cool
---
If you look closely,  at the start of the video, you can see the pig moving away from the hook.
---
Yea I've noticed that even though most dbd content creators are technically better than me (I'm in purple rank most times) that when streaming their games dont look different from mine at all. Unless you are a master tactician you're not always gonna get that 4 k as killer and not all the time are you gonna run the killer through endless loops and get that clutch adrenaline that makes them DC
---
That here might be handy :)

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/65736/dead-by-daylight-current-road-map-screenshot
---
+ Iron Will is an amazing perk?? tbh, i can't play without it and it's not only strong against Spirit or Nurse, but against any killer.
---
anyway, what i said doesn't really matter since you can't tell survivors what perks they should use, it's their choice so if they feel confident by running Self Care and waste a lot of time, then fine, do it but their chances of survival could be higher if they run something way more useful

The killer have a choice to leave the looping and find another objective. The killer can blood lust and slam that teabagging surv or just leave. But when a killer camp they take the choice from survs to do anything. They just stay there hooked till they die
---
Hi everyone! allow me to try and make things clear!
---
It isn't fair to label a killer trash for still playing the game to completion even though people dced. Yes, it's unfair to the survivors however expecting a killer to literally stand around and wait for the survivors to leave is just as unfair to expect. So people should feel happy when a killer decides to use their time to allow the survivors to escape, and shouldn't be upset if they just try and end the game quickly so they can go to the next lobby unpunished for dcing. 
---
So can we all understand what was being said and chill out? Let's save the hostility for the babies who ran away before the game really started.
---
doesn't we'll make it state that healing speed bonuses cannot exceed 100%?
---
i agree completely and also play surv/killer 50/50. i dont find claudettes hard to spot either except on yamoka and the yellow farms maps, and thats only because im colorblind, so theres no reason for me to complain on the killer side really.
---
They've said there is no summer event this year due to the amount of other projects on their plate a the moment.
---
They hate their team too, I guess.
---
Helping the killer ain't cool though, isn't it reportable to intentionally aid the killer, or am i remembering wrong?
---
This gave me a good chuckle thank you
---
Why not just close it wtf
---
L4D?
---
Left 4 Dead
---
I doubt it's gonna be slender, he's way too tall and he doesn#t actually walk like most the killers do (except the nurse she floats)
---
best bet it's hellraiser if anything because the sound files match up to it.
---
Oh I definitely agree that information is strong; that's the reason SWF are an issue: they can get all the information they need constantly.
---
The point of making Kindred base kit is to lessen that information gap that exists between Solo and SWF Survivors. Yes it's a strong effect to give, but it's not OP (IMO) and it already exists in the game for voice chat SWF. 
---
When SWF and Solo are relatively equal Killers can, and hopefully will, be adjusted accordingly.
---
Its a missed opportunity if its not Friday the 13th themed.
---
Maybe just some boards stretching between them as a makeshift bridge
---
I got satisfied reading that, thanks so much.
---
Jason is impossible because of the developers lawsuit with friday the 13th.
---
Well said :)
---
Ah ok, fair enough. Apologies.
---
Idk man. I think he was trying to trap me. But also try to close it in case I had a key
---
Well, let it be like like the Spirit, post-Phase walk, and in the slender movie it did move, but slow af, that's why I said the post Phase thing. And well he's as tall as the Plague tho.
---
Yeah some of the original killers could look out of place here. Ghostface and Legion would fit in fine though I think. I actually tried to design a Trapper skin for this map but it‚Äôs a little generic. It‚Äôs my most recent post of you‚Äôre interested
---
I commented this before and I'll comment it again.
---
Dying Light is in my opinion... one of the absolute worst perks in the game. As a design standpoint, the perk literally encourages tunneling and merciless camping to make the game miserable for everyone else. I'm a killer main and I would much rather this get removed than DS or NOED.
---
Most likely. I do like the concept though. Bet all of the immersed Claudettes would have fun sneaking around.
---
I got the idea from the concept art for the Devil Ghostface skin but I definitely kept that in mind too lmao
---
Well I guess DBD just isn't for you or, and I am not saying this in a horrible way, your not very good yet. I only say this because I don't struggle to rank up to purple ranks on a rank re-set and sometimes I can drop to 14-15. Like I said if you just play games with the intention to do as much as you can whether you survive or not you will rank up easily out of ranks 10-20. This is also not just sitting playing for hours on end. 
---
Frankly no matter that rank your going to get potatos, yes they are more common at 10-20 but I just find the stupidity evolves such as green ranks being the level most people do batshit saves just because they have BT but they haven't learnt that doesn't mean unhook under a killers nose every time. Only other suggestion is get some friends on to play some SWF and that way even if you don't rank up super quick you can still have fun. Rank re-set isn't a unique concept to DBD many games do it to try and keep things fair, like if I reached red rank then didn't play for 2 months I wouldn't want to just drop in at red ranks again as id be slaughtered and it would put me off. Also I think it is to create the illusion of progression and you achieving something in the game, like I said other games do it such as RB6 Siege and its just a way to keep people hooked.
---
I didn‚Äôt really wanna tamper with Legion‚Äôs mask designs. They kind of already have their characters in their masks. But Trapper already had a gas mask so I didn‚Äôt think it was too far fetched
---
Thought they settled that. The studio owns the rights to a immortal hockey face wearing killer, but Jason, pamela, crystal lake are owned by the original script writer. If the dont call him jason thry can license from the studio.
---
Could be. We also have a toolbox named Alexs toolbox so it probably links to him
---
Thanks for saying this. You are way bigger person than many of us :D
---
You're welcome !
---
That and gen grab spirit are disgustingly good
---
Certain perks benefit the other people on your team, whether it means that you can hold the killer in a chase for longer so they can get gens done, you help oppose toxic killers (and/or the ones who face camp), people know who is doing what so you don‚Äôt waste time, etc. I totally agree that perks mean nothing if they don‚Äôt know how to play right, but perks can definitely help the outcome of a match. So, I ask again, which perks do you think do that?
---
Yes, the results screen shows all that. Once you back out your rankings should reset as if that match never happened. It was hard to tell until I was Rank 1 as I could fully confirm that I should‚Äôve fallen to Rank 2. It reverted back to Rank 1 at the main menu.
---
A lot of people swear they de-pip but they actually don‚Äôt.
---
I‚Äôd just love the long sightlines you might have seeing the Killer searching the glossy rooftops. I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt look that great in game though, sadly
---
Nope it is still going on but it should end soon.
---
I love how all the DS counter talk is being downvoted. But that aside these are really cool concepts OP. Nice job.
---
I guess I‚Äôll go with Shattered Bloodline
---
Totally agree. Dying Light is much much worse than Noed.
---
This is why we dont play when weve already had a bad day
---
Pig Is a beyblade confirmed
---
There can't be a delay for something that was never announced.
---
Thank god that it most definitely is reportable
---
Working with the killer is, being a dumbass isn't.
---
Yea that‚Äôs great on paper but not how most games actually play out.
---
Sorry but hard tunneling farmed survivors off hook makes you look like a dick.  I understand far more about the pip and rank system and just the role in general if you think tunneling is required to be successful man.  It's a babystrat for people still working on learning the various mechanics of the game.  Some regrettably never progress past it.
---
They aren't purposely aiding they are unknowingly doing it while trying to be toxic
---
Flashlight camped, pallet camped, looped around he same window and pallet for 4 gens, teabagged, body blocking, immediate unhooks....
---
Yay
---
As a Stealth myers can I just say that you took my job? :c
---
Ghostface is literally a better stealth myers
---
Would rather prayer beads spirit than huntress with iri

It's not equivalent... 
---
but it does CAUSE it.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work anymore. I use billy all the time and I have my sensitivity maxed out. It makes no difference.
---
If survivors are charging in for a save on a camper that‚Äôs their own fault. People complain about camping yet it‚Äôs the easiest tactic to punish.
---
Thank u
---
Ok thank u
---
That's not gonna be ACTUALLY settled for a long time. At least one party is refusing to settle out of court, and in court, while a ruling was made, appeals have been made as well. It's gonna be a while.
---
PainReliever was a helpful source when making this psa.
---
...or they just can't due to the lawsuit
---
I'm pretty sure there's more than "2 options"
---
Haha well put. I enjoy playing Dwight with all his perks + BT or We‚Äôll make it. The nice guy build.
---
Any fisherman period.
---
That's like saying field goals make the winning football team a dick. It's not my responsibility to make sure the survivors have a good time. If they made smarter choices they wouldn't be in that situation.
---
Yee
---
Dead hands shouldn‚Äôt affect DS
---
Yikes
---
If I had to leave every time I encountered toxic survivors I would spend an hour just leaving matches and finding new ones (which takes twice as long as survivors I might add)
---
Everyone starts in the trial in a snow jacket, included with snow goggles, and a neckerchief. This is to conceal everyone's individuality. The Thing will spawn in the same outfit and mimic survivor movements down to crouching, running, emoting, etc. Its default running speed the same as survivors. The terror radius and red stain are camouflaged during this stage, and The Thing is unable to attack (consider this as Wraith's cloak) but can grab. This is all to create tension and paranoia. Once within X meter/s of a survivor, The Thing's ability begins to charge up as it blends in with its fellow comrades. If the jig is up and a survivor runs away initiating a chase, the ability charge-up speed is increased. Once fully charged, The Thing transforms into an abomination with greater speed, lunge attack, and strength for X seconds (consider combination of Legion and Myers) and its terror radius and red stain are now revealed. However, due to his default running speed being the same as survivors, he is incapable of catching up to survivors if everyone just runs away. Thus, keeping in line with Dr. Blair's underground network, closets have been burrowed out from behind revealing a tunnel of unknown depths. The nearest closet is always revealed to The Thing, and if he hops into one, he can choose to teleport to another closet of his choice (consider Freddy's gen teleportation) to ensure map coverage and pressure. If choosing to teleport, the map drops pitch black for a second as if someone is messing with the power/the sky darkens as if it were a bad omen, indicating The Thing has now teleported. Seeing as The Thing mimics DNA perfectly unless threatened, it still shows on Empathy, Bond, etc. Looking like and being able to act like a survivor, having no terror radius and red stain, will allow for sneaky grabs or close up attacks on survivors as seen in the case of Ghostface or Tier 1 Myers. SWF can make call outs and The Thing can be deciphered as approaching you, but if you run and initiate chase, it will only charge up its ability faster. In which case, its primary ability to cut down chases faster with better speed, strength, and lunge will prove still effective. You're right if its only gimmick was to look like survivors, it would be destroyed, but as a secondary stealth ability, it would be cool and allow for better attacks. Not only that, it could still maintain map pressure and win chases faster unlike Wraith and Legion although the ability being based off the two.
---
I'm sorry, but that's just what worked for me
---
I am the epitome of this philosophy
---
I am a Stealthy Myers which is already an extremely niche build
---
I run Mad Grit, Iron Grasp (will replace with Monitor and Abuse), Franklin's Demise, and Play With Your Food (sometimes swap it out for Bitter Murmur)
---
This sub is bipolar about prayer beads. I got upvoted for saying it's a broken add-on, and when I said it again in another post I got downvoted as hell. I don't understand how the mentality works here
---
Just happened to me lol, he was so proud of getting a 4K, even tho he only had like 12,000 points
---
Trash perk tho. Don't use it
---
Fuck yes.
---
When everyone dies everyone gets blood warden active /s
---
It's not equivalent...
---
BUT tbagging does cause it one way or another.
---
I agree with you full hardedly.  Insanely easy to beat campers and that's never what this thread was discussing though.  We were talking about whether or not they deserved a double pip if they post a tent and manage to get all 4.  I'm in full agreeance with the games devs that they do not deserve to rank up playing such a skilless playstyle.  It's the reason rank isn't based off kills.  How you get them should matter.  And according to the current rank system it does.
---
I‚Äôll also give it a go:
---
So imagine slenderman is a lot like myers, but when he stalks, he builds a meter on survivors who are looking at him (like have him on their screen, much bigger than ghosface‚Äôs reveal window). This meter slowly decreases when survivors aren‚Äôt looking at slender. When the meter is fully built, a survivor becomes T3 insane, and must snap out of it etc. 
---
Potential add-ons could increase the ‚Äústalking‚Äù speed, make it harder to snap out of it, maybe injure the survivor instead of or in addition to insanity. Maybe even prevent the insanity meter from decreasing. Lots of add-on potential.
---
Playing SWF with my buddy and our two teammates DC‚Äôd (rage induced) pretty early in the match.  And what does the killer do?  Let us finish gens, open the gates, and escape.  We did our best to allow them some farming points too.
---
Running a mori at red ranks is almost guaranteed to black pip if not even depip
---
It‚Äôs still dumb because you could have let another teammate unhook them without giving the killer a free hit or down. The only time it‚Äôs ok is when they are about to struggle or die like the comment above said.
---
Tbh Killers usually take way more time to get into a lobby, while survivors will get into a match very quickly. That means that someone who only plays killer will be able to play less games over someone who only plays survivor, and therefore he needs to be able to get more bloodpoints per match to make up the difference. 
---
I do agree with all your points tho, especially the 3rd one. As a new player, i'm completely screwed by the leveling system. Getting characters to Lv 40 for teachables is a pain(only managed to get Meg to 40 so far, and my next highest is Dwight at Lv 15), and most of the non-teachable perks are a waste of a slot. I don't mind grinding, but playing an amazing match as survivor only to get like half a level is killing me.
---
Dude, you have Adrenalin, DS, DH, BL, BT, those are fucking powerfull perks, Object as an 4 man SWF is just outright broken, there is no guess imma go with this, oyu have a meta build or you are a liability to your team. What powerfull perks do killers have? You have BBQ, ruin and the rest is pretty much up to you since the rest isn't nearly as strong as those two. Sure you can go for haunted to have a 60 second timewindow to maybe even win the game, but maybe it doesn't even get triggered or you just get unlucky and don't find anyone. You have nurses, but not every Killer can make good use of it, You have pgtw, but like ruin, you run it because you need to slow the game down, not because you like it's effect. You have pretty much 2 slots of variaty because the other perks AREN'T as good.
---
Everytime the plague vomits on me, i have the urge to always gag. Disgusting creature.
---
it's a purple add on its rarely seen or used anyway plus most survivors who hear hear her terror radius for a sec before the phase or she hooks someone near them they know to stay of the gens for a lil while if u said nurse then this would be a decent topic
---
Even if that‚Äôs the case he‚Äôs eventually going to plateau bc he‚Äôs not gonna run into those survivors every game. And once he‚Äôs high enough he‚Äôs gonna get punished by decent players either causing him to de-pip or safety pip and remain where he‚Äôs at. Do you know how hard it is to double pip in red ranks as killer? I should have a harder time getting my 2 pips bc the level 18 bubba plays against potato‚Äôs?
---
Just completing 1 generator with Prove Thyself fills my Coop more than halfway which is beautiful. I also like making the red inefficiency bar disappear
---
Yup that's another thing I fully agree with.  Moris take all difficulty out of the match hence the devs weigh their use heavily against your pip.
---
Thanks so much! :'D
---
Thank you! :'D Yes! Been cosplaying for 6 years now, got a bunch of them on my Instagram @PolkaDotDweeb if you wanna check them out!
---
Well whats the problem then? You genrush and then get fucked because you willingly took the risk.
---
Thanks a lot :3
---
I was talking about the player, not the character
---
Hard to express absolute terror but I'll work on it :L
---
Theories sometimes can be really interesting, but yours is really specific, I like it.
---
These are cool and all but again it wouldn't fit the game it's nothing like the other killers ablitys
---
He is though! I keep seeing people say that he is a low tier killer but I say that he is a better Myers! He gets the no killer radius and stain and can expose people within 5-10 seconds of seeing them, without breaking stealth. The ONLY thing that makes him remotely balanced is that he can snapped out of his stealth but by then it's usually too late.
---
Thanks! Dbd is my favorite game to brainstorm character ideas for!
---
If gates are powered and I want to secure a kill/additional kill. 
---
Dying Light obsession. 
---
If the survivor managed to set me off, teabagging at every pallet like they're the next fuckin' Ochido, using OoO just for cross-map teabags, etc. then I might just decide to camp the person to death, although that's a "They deserved it" scenario.
---
How is puppets toxic? No0b3 kinda, but no where near what he used to be
---
How dare you remind me of that commercial.
---
Are you 5 or why that many emojis?
---
I do know the rank system for reds.  It's definitely tougher up there but they're basically casualties of trying to punish babykillers out of ranking up.  Back when the system was just kills/hooks only it was too easy ranking up as a camper so they decided to rework it so that even if you get kills playing that way you don't rank up.  Helps keep trashcans out of red ranks which I do appreciate.
---
Noed isn't either. It becomes active when the gens are completed, not when a gate is open. You are contradicting your self. You say noed is guaranteed, and then proceed to describe how it isn't. I'm not one of those idiots that bases balances on yellow ranks. I base the game on red ranks, where there is no question about what's skill and what isn't. At red ranks, and frankly down the yellow ranks, all totems get broken almost every game. Few people even bring noed, because there are much better perks, which are actually guaranteed. If you kill 3 people you weren't "still going to get it." You are being blatantly dishonest. Unless you know alternate timelines, you have no proof of what would happen. You will always get adrenaline when the gens are done. There is literally no other outcome. You aren't guaranteed noed when the gens are done. It could be broken, and you might not get it. Just two of many examples where you would have no idea if the killer "would still get it." Therefore, you cannot know if the killer would get noed, proving your claim wrong. The statement "you cannot earn noed" is false. You can earn noed by doing the objective, killing survivors, then obtaining it. That is earning it.
---
It works for me. I get so invested I forget all my other problems.
---
Made one with intense music [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cm1yve/the_most_intense_skill_checks_of_my_life/)

After the first ruling they should have stuck a deal, unless he wants insane amount of money for it, I mean legal fees would be more than paying him.
---
Well Myers III is better then ghostface and could be used for a terror radius build, but that's neither here nor there.
---
I like DBD, and it's really useful for when I'm mad so I can stab some fuckers to take my anger out, so it's a good emotion-out game.
---
Yea hex perks are strong but they can be removed.
---
You counter it by pressing esc and clicking leave match button. Works every time!
---
How do you even know that for a fact?
---
You spelt thicc wrong
---
I just want cigs for everybody.
---
I added music to this one for a more immersive effect
---
I thought so...
---
Do you ever just slug Jane sometimes just to stare at her thiccness?
---
I lowkey think she should've had a perk where her thicc slows the Killer down when she's being carried.
---
I for the most part dodge lobbies with 4 man swf
---
hillbilly sawing ghostface while michael stalks hag, and legion getting caught in traps, while nurse is being vomited on, followed by bubba making barbecue and chili for hundreds, as she throws hatchets at wraith. yes i see this happening
---
Shit, I forgot that Nea is the entity
---
When the gates are opened, I will patrol a survivor on the hook.
---
Most survivors probably don't think of it as an appreciation I would say. Never thought about that it can mean that honestly.
---
I've found that mori's also increase the Dc rate 10 fold
---
"nobody loves you"
---
Wow, what a thing to tell to a depressed person.
---
yes abso friggin lutely
---
I'll keep this in mind, thank you
---
Lol I can‚Äôt find your flair?
---
Its a kind of love-hate relationship. I love killing survivors but the game can be very frustrating as well
---
Use Breakdown as Jane XD
---
While I do agree that people should take 15 seconds to do a search before posting I think reddit has one of the most garbage shitty search features ever. So bad that most of the time I have come to ignore it and rather go to google looking for reddit post if I'm trying to find an old post for some reason, so I understand why people usually don't even bother to attempt to use the reddit search.
---
Im sensing an r/quityourbullshit
---
I play plenty of survivor pal, mostly all solo.
---
My question is if prove thyself stacks
---
It's kinda easy to miss in game because of the hoodies, I didn't notice until you said so
---
I've found that 360 juking the nurse while she blinks is the best way to counter her
---
I don't blame you. It's never fun for the killer, and to add insult to injury, you had to wait 10+ minutes to even get that one lobby. It's such a shitty situation really.
---
The pallet signalizes that it‚Äôs a stalemate where she has her hatchet raised
---
Same with Rainbow Six Siege.
---
Iron isn't only good against spirit. When I'm playing killer the amount of times I find someone that I wouldn't have if they had iron will is very very high. I'm walking away from and area or just downed a survivor and I hear this insanely loud crying coming from behind a rock....
---
 the third perk is just kindred except for yourself
---
Again, best perk for spirit, lul
---
Chunky
---
This is what I mean.
---
Battle royal, killers only.
---
anal beads spirit is the best. take me out of the gen and the match too
---
Nope, it just gives everyone +10% no matter how many people are working on it

I'm just assuming

Yeah this by far would be my favorite. Getting a little tired of ‚Äúgeneric forest with blue filter‚Äù
---
The Hash Slinging Slasher!
---
Stranger things based on their tweet but who the fuck would be the killer?
---
A multiplayer predator game is already in development so I doubt they will do that.
---
I swear I've seen this already
---
Sounds like rank 20 talk to me son. And no, spirit needs no changes, just leave her alone.
---
Yo same dude I bought the game in August 2016 and hit 1000 hours a few months ago
---
The problem is totems are not worth the time to cleanse for the off chance they might have NOED, especially when they're too RNG to reliably find.
---
The devs are aware themselves that cleansing totems is not worth doing, they buffed the point gain to 1000 because nobody but bad players who interact with anything they can would do them.
---
Give dull totems an actual reason to cleanse and it would become an actual secondary objective.
---
I guess his life flashed before their eyes
---
I'll try this one more time.
---
Adrenaline is always earned. It cant not be earned due to the way the survivor needs to survive long enough to get it. Survival is an objective. Adrenaline is earned by surviving. Therefore, adrenaline is achieved by accomplishing an objective, and is therefore earned 100% of the time. Your first statement is now wrong. Period. Settled.
---
Moving on to your next. NOED by its nature is a "guaranteed" perk (dont get too married to the literal term guaranteed). What that means is, if you start a game and do absolutely nothing, you are guaranteed to get it as long as the survivors dont cleanse it. The game says "I promise you that if the survivors dont cleanse it, you get this. Guaranteed". If the survivors dont cleanse all, you get it. The reason you get it has 0 relationship to any positive act you did, but merely to something the survivors did not do. That's their fault, not your doing.
---
If you kill quickly and get to trigger noed before 5 gens are done, you haven't changed the game's promise to you (as long as survivors dont cleanse this it promises you the perk by x point in time). Killing quickly merely sped up the point in time that you get it. If you dont kill quickly, you would still get it. If you don't kill at all still get it. The game promises you this. The baseline is a guaranteed perk. The only variable that then builds from that baseline is whether or not survivors cleansed, which has no intrinsic connection to anything you did.
---
White people smh
---
dbd is a flawless masterpiece without any bugs
---
this post: heheboi
---
So hearing sounds is not apart of the base-kit?
---
No shame, just wondering because he suffers more than others from meta perks, he has very little he can do when being looped by a good player. That and no builds make him feel that strong, there is a pretty funny one you can use that revolves around play with your food but it's pretty unreliable. Nascar Bubba is pretty fun though so I'd give it a try.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why sloppy butchers good cus they have to heal twice and it‚Äôs longer
---
YES AND YES AND YES I love this idea
---
I literally got the game today lol, didnt realize that exposed was the insta down. I assume that exposure means that i can see people you know, cuz of the name
---
When I'm having a bad day i just play Leatherface, idk even doing bad in game i have fun with him
---
I actually lol'd, thank you for bringing this into my life
---
M1 is for attacking, swings have a long loading time after their use in order to balance killers to not make them broken. M2 is your ability button which depending on the killer can have either a charge time, limited uses, or other requirements. Sounds like you play Hunters who‚Äôs M2 is to throw a hatchet. You have to have hatchets in your inventory to be able to throw them and they do have a loading/cooldown animation.
---
Obviously you might not be new to the game and having an actual issue. If that‚Äôs the case I have no clue how to help.
---
Communication is kinda fun, when the survivors tell the killer what he could do better and vice versa. 
---
I just want the reports to do something. Can you get a ban for verbal abuse? I've seen some bans for using glitches, but never for anything else. 
---
When im reporting someone i want the devs or some machine to look at this guy's profile and do something about his behaviour.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Franks mask almost covers up the whole image. Nice cosplay btw
---
Thanks for the criticism!
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of it. A legitimate counter to a perk that‚Äôs never had a counter. It‚Äôs not necessarily about tunneling, it‚Äôs about not tunneling but still being fucked by DS.
---
You made your bf *cancel frenzy noises*
---
You mean like a bug? Haha you‚Äôre probably right.
---
That‚Äôs their fault but they ain‚Äôt tunneling unless their target isn‚Äôt on the hook
---
Ummmmm shush
---
Tell that to the body block lord: The wraith
---
That is one seriously valuable chest
---
I had an idea for a new killer that can go inside lockers and use them to teleport
---
That‚Äôs how it was with the MoM discussion too. Survivors outnumber killers, it‚Äôs to be expected.
---
What if She was clenching her fists?
---
I believe I heard HybridPanda complaining about this as well, I think it's a bug added in the new patch.
---
No u
---
I can see why u mad, that symbol is asking the killer to find you

I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who has been wanting this. Yes please!

---
Cool drawing, can you make one with both Julie and Susie in it too
---
Meg or Feng Min.
---
Meg has 3 useful perks that benefit in the most dangerous aspect of the game: Getting chased. 
---
Sprint Burst is very useful for getting to safety quickly. 
---
Quick and Quiet helps sneak away from the killer without them realizing you've gotten away. 
---
Adrenaline gives an instant heal and a longer Sprint Burst when all of the gens get finished
---
Feng Min has more versatile perks that cover more situations in game than just chases.
---
Lithe is a better version of Sprint Burst due to the fact that you can wait to fast vault through a window or over a pallet.
---
Technician randomly blocks a gen explosion when you mess up skillchecks. This perk isn't really good once you learn to land skillchecks but is good for beginners. 
---
Alert gives such amazing info for being such a relatively simple perk. It tells you when a killer breaks a pallet or damages a generator. This tells you what pallets are gone and tells you who the killer is at the beginning of the game if you can recognize what their auras look like.
---
But why that literally hurts you in the long run its the perk that basically screws over basic skill check which means the game could be stalled out for 40 to 60 seconds or when they find the totem
---
Yes
---
I was one of them until I realised I could actually push through when the odds where low.
---
Cheesy but yes I do agree and realised how stupid the action really is.
---
There's no need to screw your teammates over for simple things.
---
Chiilll I just want them to know what perks are good lol. That time of the month eh
---
dont forget that it also has to be a PROTECTION HIT which makes it even less likely.
---
1. I went up against 2 Prayer Bead Spirits in my 6 Survivor matches tonight...
---
2. It's got the strength of an ultra-rare, yet is only very rare.
---
3. Nurse at least requires skill to play, unlike Spirit.
---
So does this imply that if everyone cleanses, she can still hurt people with her Purge, but it doesn‚Äôt make anyone sick anymore?
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Why have the same 7 perks (both sides) that people build from. It‚Äôs predictable and boring. Can you imagine what kind of game this would be if every perk was good? You wouldn‚Äôt have any clue what to expect.
---
Commodious + Socket Swivel and Clean Rag = best toolbox in the game. Commodius is so much better than the Engineer's, it's crazy
---
Why so many legion posts and fanarts? Isn't rework freddy and ghostface the center of attention?
---
A mode that takes place inside a building and its pitch black, only light source is the generator lights. each generator is in a small room and when its completed some lights leaks out into the hallways thru doorways, windows and other nooks and crannys illuminating a little more of the map around that room. 
---
more so that map changing the way you play and not so much a new game mode. there would still be scratch marks and red stain. blood pools would be harder to see.
---
only thing is that I could see wraith being strong with a certain add on as well as other stealth killers.
---
also:
---
-2v8/kwf
---
-large scale battle royale infection
---
This man deserves a reward
---
This. is. ***AMAZING!*** (\^&gt;w&lt;)&gt; \~&lt;3  take this heart and upvote!
---
Ghostface watch out it‚Äôs the killer she‚Äôs behind you
---
When you have good games, they really make you sit back and say "THIS. This is why I love this game." Almost everyone, killer mains/survivor mains will say its a love hate relationship. Plus it's going to always changing. I love reading updates!
---
Vegans all cool until your food eats you.
---
Y‚Äôall are really running out of things to complain about huh?
---
Exactly. By not purging you‚Äôre saving yourself from a free hit long range hit by the killer
---
lol
---
16 üíØ keepin it real from the beginning
---
Rofl, that actually sounds quite ridiculous, but I can't imagine people running that combo outside of basement builds or unless they suspect a sabo game. 
---
Besides, the amount of struggling it actually stalled was so minimal that it couldn't possibly justify a slot in any serious perk loadout in the current meta.
---
well that just bad luck then and despite nurse being a higher skill cap shes stronger than sprit without any add ons regardless
---
Both are BS, but at least IH are ultra-rare and have significant downsides.
---
Still no
---
Finna pick up that gf skin
---
God, I love Jane.
---
Well then your shit out of luck
---
Yup. All the time. I don‚Äôt even bother with chat anymore. It‚Äôs either toxic or nothing (like this). I say GG, check out my score then leave.
---
I would if I was a survivor main
---
Playing a horror game to feel better ?
---
In red ranks, the majority of spirit killers always have this add on. It's really annoying. It's rare to find a match where a spirit doesn't have it.
---
You think running around trying to find Survivors who are refusing to do anything is fun?
---
Totally agree, everytime one of my teammates gers hooked in the basement, I know it's game over.
---
Doesn't matter if you're good or not, killer will get the kills without any sweat.
---
You gonna DC when I pick you up as gf with insta down meg gang?
---
To be fair most of the time I just leave because I dont wana see all the toxicity when I could just get into another game.
---
If survivors cleanse and give her corrupt purge it means her puke turns red for a minute and causes damage.  She can easily bring you from healthy to injured or injured to dying by merely contacting a single pixel of her vomit when she spits on you.  Even if you are healthy she has plenty of time to hit you twice with it.  Basically it's what makes her strong and it's why most solid survivors choose to deny her this ability at all by simply plowing through gens while sick.  Cleansing usually takes place at the endgame for these survivors.
---
Not if they get rid of meg to prevent gen rush
---
Umm you okay there bud?
---
Just gotta learn to avoid basement spawn areas. Basement is supposed to be a death sentence.
---
NO
---
The way you say "Y'all" means you're a killer main. You guys got end game collapse, why you so salty if the survivors ask for things?
---
Oh. There's your answer. Survivors are really starting to hate freddy
---
NO IM NOT
---
Shiittttt you're right
---
I'm with u. For the minority of players that are trolls some really good ones too. I find myself singing "why can't we be friends" a lot when playing either as killer or survivor.
---
They got collapse because of asshole survivors who would stay in the game forever.
---
The exact reason why I never played Meg until very recently üòÇ
---
Nice, I‚Äôm stuck in the yellow ranks cuz people hate dwights and face camp th while my teammates do nothing EVEN THOUGH ALL THE GENS ARE DONE.
---
Lol "not for the faint of heart". Yeah man. This games is fucking super hardcore. And so are you.
---
1. Flashlight are crap unless used by very skilled Survivors. Prayer Beads take no skill to use.
---
 These are your own words, and by the fact that you think they are crap indicates you are not a skilled survivor thus your opinion on prayer beads being overpowered is null and void. Take some time, learn the game and I'm sure down the road you will find that while prayer beads are strong, they need other things to go with them to make them amazing.
---
Plus its not just the names. One are magical changes, the others are items. You talk about a Game mechanic. But facing the fact that this Game is already massively biased towards survs, we should forget this Idea. I have for first to live with the fact, that they ner... ehm ‚Äû Rework‚Äú the two only Killers usable for Endgame...
---
Pig wants dbd dead
---
So much for being "ultra-rare". The devs said they were going to nerf insta-heals at one point, I wonder what's taking that so long.
---
And so we should get something for asshole killers who camp?
---
I‚Äôm not sure I follow you. You should be dancing and juking around the killers since they are all newbs. This is a survivor‚Äôs dream. You should be flying through the ranks TBPH if you‚Äôre as good as you claim to be.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat except I‚Äôm a killer main. I work, go to school and have a baby so my time is limited. I obliterate survivor‚Äôs at my ranks. I have no complaints.
---
I‚Äôm not though I play both. I‚Äôm tired of this assumption for real though. Just because somebody recognizes a useless complaint doesn‚Äôt mean they play exclusively killer. It means they have the ability to think.
---
That's a Thermian argument, it may fit the fluff but the fluff exists to support a good game system.  If the lore rules against having a good game, then the lore should change, rather than just letting the game be bad.
---
In any case, a better pip system is in line with the lore.  The pip/rank isn't the reward, its a system of matching equal survivors and killers.  The reward is bloodpoints, which you absolutely do get more of from drawn-out games where both sides feel hope.
---
It stands to reason that, if the entity feeds on hope, the most logical path would be for it to pit equally-matched killers and survivors against each other.  What you suggest would be the entity politely asking that the better killers restrain themselves, rather than forcibly providing them with a greater challenge if they get too strong.
---
I guess if that's the intention of the devs then yeah, I'm just thinking about it wrong.
---
Ur not on max level like me though
---
I think Franklin‚Äôs Demise should make Bills cigarette fall out
---
In Panda's video, the comments said something about resolution being a problem. Could that be the case? I have no idea, personally, but some of the commenters seemed sure that's what it was.
---
She has some dumbass addons that pretty much force you to cleanse anyways and then she becomes the broken overpowered killer the devs created. Like one is that she can see where survivors are when they vomit, that's just kind of a gg right there, pretty good job though.
---
How do you make it dynamic? How do you rank the items and addons? What does this point value entail? How do you register it? I can swap killers freely after all, so I could go in with the lowest point values possible and then swap to a full on ebony mori Hillbilly with instasaw after getting a lobby filled. How should gens be adjusted? If this is to change the matchmaking to make it better... then you fuck with the core game, and someone in low ranks then wouldn't know what to expect come reaching high ranks. What should be considered the core aspects then if rank determines how generators are done?
---
These are pretty major ideas that would need well thought out decisions in order to be effective.
---
Killer camps slam gens. Sucks if you‚Äôre the one on the hook but you can easily knock out a gen or more if they are camping.
---
Yes. The thinking man. Not actually bringing any counterpoints to the argument and instead just complaining about criticism. So thinking.
---
These add ons are fine. Stop crying.
---
The main reason i play killer is because yes theres an asshole 4man with insta heals 1 out of 20 matches but playing survivor theres way too many addons, killers or playstyles that are so incredibly boring and wreck the game. 1 gen will pop in a chase and for some reason thats the queue for a killer to tunnel straight off the hook and patrol the hook afterwards. Its completely bullshit how boring solo queues as survivor is
---
I‚Äôm both
---
I could hear that breathing lmao
---
Plague is honestly my least favorite killer to go against, simply because it all just grosses me out üòÇ
---
Urban crouch walking is much better then normal crouch walking. Allows you to save people way more quuckly. Hopefully...
---
I'm pretty sure all these "mean message" posts aren't even allowed here  anyway.
---
Bond. Quit pulling the killer to me.
---
Borrowed time. If you‚Äôre gonna farm me, at least have the courtesy to give me BT.
---
Lithe or BL because you fucking suck at Dead Hard
---
Yo not a bad idea
---
He‚Äôs saying the megs he faces only ‚Äúgenrush‚Äù more than any other person
---
And nurse and spirit and billy. I‚Äôm not gonna play wraith or clown just so they ‚Äúlike‚Äù (see can easily beat) the killer they face.
---
Personally i like stealthy complex killers that have the ability to jump scare survivors. I want my victims to be on edge. The lower the TR the better.
---
Man I wish they would just do it as an event. Maybe twice a year bring it out as a game mode not meant to be taken seriously and once the event is over it‚Äôs back to business as usual.
---
 Reference?
---
These are all OP, no thanks.
---
That was intentional. I can't make the other players run Kindred when I play solo survivor, but I could run this. It's meant to be an alternative to Kindred, in the same vein as Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time.
---
Yeah this was me exactly one year ago now, after a breakup that really fucked with me big time time. I don‚Äôt know what I would‚Äôve done without DBD this time last year. I‚Äôm really glad I didn‚Äôt grow tired of the game.
---
Hold on, keep going.... I hope things will work out for you. Both in-game and in your relationship &lt;3
---
LMFAO
---
Ah i see
---
You wanna talk about it? Btw this wasn‚Äôt one of those he said mean things and now I feel bad type of posts. I just genuinely have no idea what could‚Äôve triggered him.
---
His fourth perk: touching kids
---
Amen to that.
---
Something to note, the only survivor and killer BP offerings that earn meaningful BP are: 
---
Escape Cakes (survivor) +100% BP and costs 4000 BP  (max bonus of 32,000 BP = net gain of 28,000) 
---
Survivor Pudding (killer) +100% BP and costs 4000 BP (max bonus of 32,000 BP = net gain of 28,000) 
---
Blood Party Streamers (both sides) +100% BP and costs 5000 BP (max bonus of 32,000 BP = net gain of 27,000) 
---
Hollow Shell (killer) +25% BP and costs 4000 BP (max bonus of 8000 BP = net gain of 4000)
---
Sealed Envelope (survivor) +25% BP and costs 4000 BP (max bonus of 8000 BP = net gain of 4000)
---
Bound Envelope (survivor) +25% BP and costs 5000 BP (max bonus of 8000 BP = net gain of 3000)
---
All other BP offerings are a bait. They cost more BP than they earn unless you max out your BP earnings in game. This is the case for both Killer and Survivor. Only run the addons I've listed for maximum BP gain.
---
sure lets have a nice long chat, actually, let me just simplify it, if i see another one of these fucking posts i am going to play frogger IRL on a fucking highway i swear to god ill do it
---
Now it‚Äôs just
---
#DEAD
---
 I like moris. They add more tension.
---
It would be funny if killers could see an items rarity
---
One survivor was tbagging me today for the whole game so I decided to tunnel him and facecamp him. I loved the postgame chat where he was crying how bad and toxic I am because I tunneled and facecamped. God I felt so good after that game.
---
It's definitely not the mouse, works flawless everywhere else. 
---
Thanks for taking the time to reply though!
---
Well that seems a bit excessive honestly. Maybe it would be easier to just scroll past it?
---
Good way to bargain I must say.  Compete with the other survivors lol.
---
Do happen to remember which video it was? Unfortunately I didn't read the comments there.....
---
I do have an ultrawide screen with a weird aspect ratio, so you might be onto something!
---
The basis of your argument is based off of something I never said. I never at any point suggested anyone disconnect. I straight up said killing yourself on the hook. 
---
I'm not going to reply to the rest of your bullshit if you can't follow along.
---
Honestly I love it.  It's a must for me because I loathe killers that stoop to proxycamping and hard tunneling directly off hook and this perk was redesigned to completely punish the shit out of them for playing that way.  It's part of my "Tunnel me if you want but I fucking promise it won't be fun for you" build.
---
Ahh, that's something I overlooked. Somewhere one the main menu is a tutorial section that should actually have a legend for all types of status effects. If its till there give a it a look. There are some status effects people don't know about.
---
I think it‚Äôs funny when noobs like you come to Reddit and spew your non sense. How does it feel publicly making yourself look like an idiot?
---
I mean you can keep spouting your big mouth, if you‚Äôre cool with obviously looking like you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. You‚Äôre being downvoted to hell because it‚Äôs obvious you have no idea what you are talking about. Do yourself a favor and delete these post.
---
They still haven‚Äôt patched this?
---
Can't resist that Meg booty
---
False. You do not survive 100% of the time. You can die. Dying is not surviving. Adrenaline is not earned 100% of the time. Absolute claims require absolute evidence. Provide some.
---
"Noed is always guaranteed, except when it isn't." Noed is not always guaranteed. Survivors can or cannot break it. I literally just played a game where I broke it. Proof noed is not guaranteed. Absolute claims require absolute evidence. Provide some.
---
You do not have to kill quickly to obtain noed. Speed and ease are irrelevant to the absolute statement "noed is guaranteed." 
---
The killer cannot survive until the end! Amazing! Never knew that! That's the survivors objective. The killers objective is to kill. You can do that objective, then get noed. A situation where noed is earned for doing the objective. Provide absolute evidence for the absolute claim "noed is never earned."
---
Oh yeah, I mean it doesn't make much difference if I have click two or three times to start working on a gen as a survivor, but precise killer gameplay is a whole other story üò°
---
I agree, I just mean they probably won‚Äôt make any changes until they set everything else into motion
---
Thank you so much! :'D Glad you like it!!
---
You couldn‚Äôt refute the recurring theme of people not being okay with screwing their team over and giving the killer free points, and now you‚Äôre butthurt you‚Äôve been talked into a corner.
---
Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm still crawling. I‚Äôll get out eventually. It‚Äôs only been 4 hours.
---
How I feel when I cleanse dulls only to find out they indeed had NOED.
---
I would like to see a few creepy pastas in, even if it's just an homage to the source material
---
Survivor mains be like: wELl WHy wErE yOU TrYinG to REloAd wHeN yOU WEre gONna LeT mE go??? tOXIc tRasH KiLLer
---
you know.....Death might be an escape after all
---
I was playing legion yesterday and actually got jumpscared by an ash who appeared directly in front of me .2 seconds after I hit a gen and thought no one was around 
---
Getting jumpscared as the killer is what dbd is all about
---
It's......it's next month...
---
These perks seem so cool! I would probably buff dying rights to have a larger area of effect so it outclasses kindred, but besides that I would totally run some of these. I like the slight game slowdown and anti-toxic playstyles these promote.
---
Leave the hook then. It‚Äôs really that easy. You can‚Äôt camp or tunnel with Make Your Choice.
---
He does it better with monitor and abuse imo.
---
Decisive strike is really annoying. I can't tell you how many times I have purposely not tunneled someone hook and still managed to find them later just before their decisive strike runs out and I don't even realize it was the same person that was hooked before then I get stunned.
---
Yes it is the "Salty Trapper" video!
---
https://youtu.be/QRI8ZhGknoM
---
I have no idea if that will fix it for you, I'm not on PC. I hope it works for you! The problem is incredibly irritating I can imagine.
---
This is me and every ghostface I've ever played with. 
---
"I wonder who the killer is..." 
---
EXPOSED STAB
---
Unbreakable is one of the perks for the build so is adrenaline and deliverance
---
I Love it and allowed me to clutch so many basement hook escapes.
---
Combine it with Adrenaline, Mettle of Men and Unbreakable and you will always get away :D
---
You're definitely correct that this sub is full of ignorance. Spirit needs some changes though, she's about as interactive to play against as Nurse(and that's not even mentioning prayer beads).
---
Someone should give Constantine a call.
---
Ooh mettle of man, that might work
---
What is this ‚Äútotem you speak of?‚Äù /s
---
Thanks man, will give it a look!
---
Nice job on the perfect game. It looks like it was a good one. People are just bitter. Here is your gg! You deserve it
---
Shit I do this. I wonder if my friends think I‚Äôm a nut job for it.
---
What I did was use BBQ religiously and go for hooks. Funnel all my points into one killer, getting all the streamers and pudding I can. Once I unlocked all the perks, burn through all the pudding and funnel those points into another killer. So on and so forth. So you could be earning potentially 96k points a trial.
---
Same with survivor except with WGLF and cakes
---
* The pallet is only unbreakable for a few seconds, as to force the killer to go around the pallet, and it is an exhaustion perk the same as Lithe or Sprint Burst. It helps the survivor gain some ground once per chase, but that's about it.
---
* Almost as fast as killers? A 0.5% increase times the maximum of five dull totems is 102.5%. Killers have a default speed of 115% for the most part, with Huntress and Hag having 110%, and Nurse having 96.25% speed (but still having a blink).
---
Yay. Let's see it happen plz
---
I have about 30 prayer beads sitting on my Spirit without even purposely pathing towards them - people who play Spirit exclusively can have hundreds. It really isn't that hard to stockpile a purple addon and use it every game as killer.
---
Want to go over some of the counterplay you would suggest people learn against prayer beads?
---
Lol okay. I do it as "come get me" and most of the people I see do it as "come get me" so that's just not true that everyone does it as "he's camping"
---
That is the point of the basement though? It is suppose to heavily favor the killer ( KILLER's shack).
---
It is a punishment for survivors to go down near it. 
---
Besides nowadays it's not even that good for killer unless you play someone that has traps.
---
You will not be body-blocked on stairs, you can run Decisive Strike, run Borrowed Time, hell even Adrenaline if it is end-game, insta-heal, like there is plenty to do to counter basement plays.
---
Basement ain't bad mate.
---
Ok super long comment but I think it will help.
---
I am a rank 10 killer so take my advice however you will.
---
I usually place 2 traps on any generator in the open I pass on patrol. You can also effectively use 1 trap on in the open gens if your using trap range add ons. You can place 1 trap on cornered gens. If possible try trapping entry paths to gens. I found this can catch survivors off guard on approach or in a chase away.
---
Trap hooked survivors if you have the time. 1 or 2 in front of the hook + more on entry/exit paths. Consider running the Pig perk Make Your Choice to help keep from tunneling, bypass Borrowed Time, stack BBQ and down healthy survivors quickly. If you get a rescue hook notification go ahead and pursue it if you have time. Chances are you'll catch survivors before they get to far as they'll be crouching or they will trip a trap for you as they rush away.
---
Hook in the basement when possible. Having 1 entry and exit point is amazing. Place a trap on the hook, another on the corner landing and another at top of stairs. Additional traps may be needed at top of stairs depending on basement location. Killer shack for example could use traps on the other side of the pallet and window. Pursue unhooked survivor notifications. Your almost sure to catch people crouching out the basement or have them trip a trap.
---
1 or 2 traps on any hex totems would be a good idea. Add more traps if a survivors finds the totem. Extra traps will make it hard to cleanse the totem without getting hit. Trust me, survivors almost *Always* come back to hex totems they were chased off of.
---
Consider placing 1 or 2 traps in high traffic areas of the maps. An intersecting hallway, door ways, popular loops etc. Survivors will be expecting traps near gens, hooks and totems. Not random open floors or doorways.
---
Learn to recognize Chasers. I call survivors who purposely get in chases to waste time Chasers. This takes intuition but knowing when someone is tripping traps on purpose is important in deciding which chases to start and commit to. This strategy is especially prevalent when survivors have 3 gened themselves.
---
Trap exit gate switches when nearing endgame. You likely won't have time during endgame collapse.
---
Lastly, the middle grate area of Lery's memorial hides the trap triangle. Completely invisible triangle. The traps aura may be visible but the triangle that the Hag draws is invisible on the grate. Be on the look our for more areas like this.
---
Add ons I prefer.
---
Trap setting time.
---
Teleportation distance.
---
Trap range.
---
Rusty shackles.
---
Rusty shackles prevents a phantasm from spawning on tripped traps. Survivors will have no idea they fucked up until you pop up from the ground and slap them.
---
Add ons that prevent teleporting for a trade off may be good but I lack experience to say for sure.
---
Hope this helps!!!
---
Thanks for helping me figure out what LF stood for lol
---
It's so weird to me when someone mentions chat. All I know is the PS4 version.
---
For the Entity's sake I hope it never tries to take John Constantine. He'd have the thing banished to some depth of hell and all the survivors back home before his first trial.
---
I agree that strategy makes sense. People just dont like to be slugged even if the reason is a good one like yours. Just play how you want man as long as you're not intentionally toxic who cares what survivors think of your play.
---
A significant amount of players are in Swf nowadays so the level of giving a care about your team is much higher than one would expect, the same with altruistic players who have spent a longer time playing the game and are aware that the moment a camping killer gets the kill they‚Äôll move to camp again, so they stay alive as long as they can, even beyond that reasoning - moving forward - altruism is almost required if you want a significant amount of bp as a survivor so there‚Äôs a chance someone will get you off if things are coordinated right and nobody wants to die on hook if they don‚Äôt feel like they have to.
---
Mettle of Man is very hard to activate. You need 3 protection hits, so bring a med kit
---
Honestly, they should remove chat all together, but PS4 has options for parties so you can always play with people you know that aren't jerks.
---
"Why can't I walk backw-*oh*"
---
Am i the only one who can't seem to get mad at this game too much? Like theres some frustration but its usually just fun even thought i dont play casually
---
I'm not new, and I definitely had hatchets. Considering you have to hold the hatchet to wind up/hold m1 to long swing and literally nothing happened, I really really doubt it was user error.
---
Man, I wish I could meet more people like you. Someone who really takes the time to explain themselves cuz you didn't have to even after you tried to play fair.
---
Cool, I think I saw that too, makes me feel like I'm going insane. Did I... did I not click my mouse? I heard it click... but it didn't do the thing...
---
People love Spine Chill on this subreddit because half of them seem to be immersed Claudettes that have no game sense. I wouldn't bother saying anything negative about it here.
---
Spine chill almost single handedly wrecks prayer beads since you still know when she is headed right for you even if she is phased.
---
Identifying the spirits build early can shut down her game plan as long as you dont keep falling into it. If you notice she seems to keep heading to totems quickly, ignore the totems and do the gens,  if she is focused on gens stay spread out and work multiple gens at once so she cant pin point.
---
Tap gens even if you dont plan on working on it, it will cause her to waste time looking around gens you are no where near.
---
These are not hard things to think about and do. The spirit is a mind game killer, you need to out mind game her to be successful.
---
Nurse Because I would basically be able to do anything however if I accidentally miss a blink I'd probably die so there's that. Spirit has hands down one of the least risky ability as you become super fast and invisible plus no one can see you for a certain amount of time question is how the fuck would you activate it.
---
&gt; but I know they'll never change the way that works.
---
This is where you're wrong. BHVR have already announced that with dedicated servers there will be a change to DCing. Players who frequently DC will get increasing wait times before being allowed to re queue. ALSO, and this is an important part, survivors who DC will leave behind a husk, kind of just like they are an AFK player, and the killer will be able to hook and gain full points of off the husk of the survivor who left the game.
---
Me and my friends call them anal beads cause of how many times its fucked us over in the ass
---
Pretty much this. The problem with Adrenaline is less that it alone in a vacuum is too strong, but rather that Survivors as a whole are a bit on the strong side currently and Adrenaline really accents that problem.
---
Thing is it would be far easier to fix a perk which I do honestly think is a bit OP as opposed to nerfing pallet spawn rate and everything else so dramatically. There's nothing saying we can't then buff Adrenaline after the fact to compensate for weaker Survivors.
---
Decisive strike is really good for clutch end game escapes when the killer is camping/proxy camping the hook. 
---
Always save it for end game if you can. Countless times I‚Äôll have my friends rip me from the hook in front of the killer, DS and escape. Also it‚Äôs great to body block afterwards if the killers attention is put on someone else or baiting the killer to chase you, which gives everyone else time to escape and then DS and leave.

You play you. If they can't get each other up it is on them and their skill set. They are not used to it and have not learned to counter it. Their human mind can't handle being out strategized by another mind because they don't feel superior. Make them eat every fucking slug until they learn to counter it. 
---
I play solo and I have saved a few swf 2 man 3 man groups from slugs. I have friend requests and messages off so I keep my experience selfish to me and me alone so I don't know if they learn or appreciate the help from a random lol. 
---
If I as a solo player by myself can carry a group thru a slugfest then I welcome it from all killers. Let the selfish minded players never learn to counter it cause they can't comprehend working together, especially with randoms for that matter.
---
Sounds ideal but that mechanic could always be abused, so devs would really have to be involved, maybe even hire some moderators.
---
Heaven is a place on earth, bromeo

Unfortunately, BHVR takes the lazy approach and makes a boring map cluttered with random assets. Hell, whenever there's an actually interesting idea like Temple of Purgation, they ruin it by using a pre-existing realm. In other cases like Ormond, A SKI RESORT WITH MOUNTAINS SURROUNDING IT, they half-bake a map by making is the same 1 floor map with a small 2 story building.
---
Well. It seems like they come out once per year. This year's was Freddy, so, maybe next year.
---
i think its the edit in the top right of the flair list. sorry i didn't try yet
---
Explain to me how you earn Adrenaline. By reaching the end game like everyone else?
---
Sorry but the argument that Adrenaline is "earned" while NOED isn't is complete bullshit. The only difference is that NOED is a crutch while Adrenaline is a win more perk.
---
I'm glad for you, too. That game can be really frustrating sometimes lol
---
This man seems very powerful
---
ahhh, yes. I remember my first game of DBD üòÇ poor thing.
---
Awesome, so then they aren't having as bad of a time as a killer forced to see an entire miserable game through to the end.
---
And remember that worse case scenario? The longest you can sit on a hook through all stages assuming no one rescues you is around a minute.
---
I'm not obligated to save anyone so of course I'm going to leave especially if the killer is camping fuck that
---
False. You can not survive, the objective, and get it. You need to do the objective to earn it, which it is possible not to do.
---
False. You can get kills, the objective, and then get noed. You need to do the object to earn it, which is possible to do.
---
Provide evidence for the absolute claim you support, as I have brought evidence proving it wrong.
---
Guys it‚Äôs just my salt it‚Äôs not super serious please I beg
---
Might try r/gaming because most people on this sub already got it
---
Will do brother thank you
---
Any survivors who attempt unsafe hooks will die. This a ChooseyPegasus2 guarantee.
---
I‚Äôm going to guess that you mainly play survivor because any person who actually plays both sides would realize how those two perks would break the game. Every survivor and their mother would be running those perks as they‚Äôre so overpowered
---
Baby Survivors are so cute when they are injured.
---
To me they're just a slight annoyance. It's rare that people blind me during saves and blinding at pallets just makes them loose less distance plus I just listen for which direction they ran off.
---
I agree with you but i still like to understand the logic. When i play survivor i never really mind it. And if it happened a lot id just run unbreakable.
---
The basement can be a pain in the ass, but I like the challenge it can present. Also, it isn‚Äôt that bad. Just think about it for a second. If the killer is set on camping, you can just do gens. If not, one person can lure them away from the basement while someone else goes for the save.
---
I didn't notice the DS till the end. SO CLOSE!  Thanks for sharing. These are always fun to watch.
---
well if the gates open and your near it and have decisive your home free if you can land it
---
Lmao I love Jimmy Neutron, poor Carl
---
He‚Äôs regarded as one of the worst out all the killers. Look up TydeTyme on YouTube, he used to do a lot of stuff covering DbD and he breaks things down by figures and facts.
---
That said, if you can get a 4K with the Doc? You do you homie.

I used to use this perk for about the first 50 hours of survivor gameplay and it does pretty much nothing for me now against any killer that isn't specifically prayer beads spirit. I am not going to dedicate a perk slot to counter an addon I see in maybe 5% of my games, and it should be pretty easy to see why that's not an acceptable "counterplay" for an addon.
---
&gt;Identifying the spirits build early can shut down her game plan as long as you dont keep falling into it. If you notice she seems to keep heading to totems quickly, ignore the totems and do the gens, if she is focused on gens stay spread out and work multiple gens at once so she cant pin point.
---
This is pretty generic advice that can be applied to any killer though, right? Spreading out and working on gens is just what you do to any killer, so I'm not sure what the point of this is.
---
&gt;Tap gens even if you dont plan on working on it, it will cause her to waste time looking around gens you are no where near.
---
I'm not sure if you're suggesting gen tapping to avoid grabs or tapping regressing gens so I'll address both -
---
Gen tapping: Too slow, you're going to die
---
Regressing gens: She has surveillance and you're going to die, or you tap the gen and she's not going to give a shit because she's going to find people working on gens eventually.
---
&gt;The spirit is a mind game killer, you need to out mind game her
---
No phasing sound is just the ultimate mind game, you are right. I've been outplayed.
---
I completly agree but I think you mean dark sense unless I have an awful memory.
---
Not the killers fault, just bad design. I dont care if killers have noed and dont care if I get hooked or killed but I'm not wasteing my time doing shit I dont enjoy like holding m1.
---
I haven't seen that many Freddy's even after his rework.
---
I think of her more as a fidget spinner.
---
*Breaks fingers*
---
Look I'm invisible!!!

You weren't a Claudette in a silver dress and a flashlight playing roughly 24 hours ago agains a GF?
