Ha that's what I did
---
---
---
Wow that one survivor with the red coat found a knife to defend against Wraith for you guys
---
I‚Äôve only had it once and it was shortly after the plague was released.
---
Autocorrect XD
---
End game collapse, more like end game crash.
---
Woah, imagine if people who played a game also went to the games Reddit :O
---
I got kicked 3 out of 4 games last night with a friend.  Last two matches of the night I couldn't even play and just had to watch their stream.  So fun....
---

---
But I have been DCing at least 5 or 6 times every night on all random occasions.  Its impossible to progress or even play sometimes for me.
---
Yeah you're fucked. IDK why you immersed claudettes think you should win instantly if your entire team died, didn't complete the gens AND failed to find the hatch first.  
---
Yeah lemme just win the game after achieving literally nothing. That's fair.
---
[removed]
---
Holy shit have you ever played Nurse? It takes so much practice to be even adequate. You know nothing about this game is you think nurse takes no skill.
---
I have like 600 extra blink addons still don‚Äôt use any of them. You rushed to rank 1 after rank reset playing nurse you reap what you sow.
---
Hell yeah lol yea I‚Äôm gonna be real hurt if she gets a tough nerf. Was lookin forward to enjoying my time as a yung pig main. Just learning to master the craft now
---
You‚Äôre Rank 13, the problem is High Ranking Pips
---
I am glad it helped you out, even if it isn‚Äôt for you anymore. It‚Äôs always good to hear something you like helped someone. 
---
It is still frustrating to me, but I still like it (for some reason). It helped to get me back in to PC gaming and moved me from consoles. 
---
I am hoping that as they start to add more ‚Äúthings to do‚Äù like endgame collapse, then the game will improve. I am actually hoping that the multiple killer thing will eventually be added, that the bugs are a feature in development.
---
Also for pig, her breathing is really loud. If you use a headset for this game you will always hear it. It's louder than a gen being worked on is. If you're really attentive and spent a good amount of money for a good headset, you can also hear her standing up out of crouch by the sound of her blade extending.

Is this a shitpost? Or a flex image? Or an actual complaint? Or all three?
---
Being a giant brick of a man is sexy tho
---
Not scared. They're all down.
---
Yeah I suppose but I mean there's just a lot of hackers that use legacy skins, they've tarnished the real legacy players.
---
Oh no
---
I can see survivors complaining that it's super toxic if the killer opens the gate :(
---
And the hatch closing...so much salt coming at us at super sonic speed
---
Pillow better not be dead hard
---
Yeah that happens sometimes around totems that have been cleansed. Dunno why though. First saw it happen in KYF and had to put the game on hold while we goofed off and screwed with the springboard physics.
---
wouldve been funnier if you both got stuck outside the map
---
Platform: Ps4 Pro
---
Bug type: Ingame
---
Video: Can produce but dont have one atm
---
Steps:  Killer runs hex ruin, play survivor and be under the hex, fix a generator until skill check appears, if you hit a good skill check release the repair button at the same time as you hit the skill check, if done quick enough generator doesnt suffer from regression and animation for it doesn't trigger.
---
Expected result:  Be survivor under hex ruin, hit good skill check and stop repairing and  generator starts smoking and unable to progress for a moment like normal.
---
Actual result: if survivor under hex ruin successfully triggers a good skill check and quits repairing in the same second the generator never  smokes out and regresses progress.  Thus leaving the generator at current progress and able to fix as soon as you can start repairing again.  If hex ruin had triggered this normally smokes out the generator which regresses progress and makes the generator unable to be progressed for a few seconds. 
---
Reproduction rate: 100% as long as you can hit the good skill check and stop repairing within the same moment.
---
As a non piece of shit you see things rationally. Most ppl in this game are not rational, especially if they have some maxed out characters and things don‚Äôt go their way. Ppl are broken.
---
Classic, ‚Äúif it exists there is porn if it‚Äù
---
I really like the word Squadette
---
At that point the damage is already done tho. A crucial hook right there could have a big impact on the game as a whole but instead the chase is extended for another minute or more depending on how decent the survivor is. Then a lot of pressure is lost.
---
For what is a supposed to be a 4% chance I feel like I unhook myself like once every 4 tries lol
---
I have had it twice today, once with the plague and once with a trapper.
---
I'm just sticking around killer rank 15-8, below that it's impossible to get games on console.
---
Say and think what you want. Just trying to help.
---
Hey üÖ±Ô∏èrank üÖ±Ô∏èorrison
---
I do as killer if I have nothing else really worth using. It‚Äôs a good trash offering that slightly helps on maps like the swamp.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Glad they keep it consistent then I guess
---
Nice copy pasta
---
I think its bullshit they just dont remove one if not both of the addons since they are aware of this issue.  Rather than ban players for using this bug they are openly allowing to continue.  But that is just my 2 cents
---
You won yes. And NOT pipping is not a punishment... de-piping is! you didn't de-pip so you didn't get punished. 
---
You won vs very very VERY bad players and that does not mean you should get rewarded for it OR punished for it...
---
All of DBD is competitive so.....
---
pings are all yellow and green in this vid.
---
Ive had it like 3 times, as killer and survivor. It‚Äôs broken as hell. Played games where someone messaged me asking if I saw giant people, too, and I did not. It‚Äôs one-sided, and it really sucks dick.
---
What dont you like about playing against him? I find I don't really have much issue looking out for his shimmer. But I do love playing as him. He's got some of the best designed add-ons, imo.
---
Huh, is Wraith now being cloaked even before that camera spin at the beginning of the match finishes ü§î
---
If you post a link to it I can translate and report back
---
maybe so but pig has 4 ( at least ) traps she can use and delay the game ( maybe even get a kill ) way more than legion can with his super nerfed ability now. He wont even be able to down people anymore with his power.
---
What I want to see is the locker getting grabbed and crushed with the survivor inside. Oh, the BRUTALITY!!!!
---
I play as David and don't agree with that because I always run borrowed time so i can save my team even if i can't do it safely.

If you are the one that gets the Frozen Loading yes all will have it until you force close it. As soon as the one (or more?) with the bug close it the others will load into the game.

Good addons also go a long way
---
When the game freezes for someone all the others freeze to until the one that have the bug closes the game. Most of the time you can guess that someone will close it and you ll go into play but if it takes too long and the image is frozen it means you have the bug so you have to close it after all.

---
If the Loading Bar does not move at all, and if the Tips and Animation are not working for a long time you probably have the bag. It's not exactly our "fault" we just have the luck to be the chosen one some times :P
---
If the things above seem normal but the game does not load it's probably one(or more) of the others with the problem so you can just wait for them to force close the game.
---
Mark for spoiler pls
---
I was chasing a Meg as hillbilly, she was about 15 metres away from me and threw down a pallet. I was shocked despite not looping it. I decided to stand still and watch her run to another pallet. She threw it down. I was about 25 metres away this time. 
---
-Low ranks don‚Äôt look behind
---
-If they see a killer, they must run across the map and hide behind a tree.
---
-Miss skill checks
---
-Waste pallets, even if the killer is 20 metres away
---
I've been thinking for a while now that they need to add a second set of stairs to the basement on the opposite side, coming out a side entrance or something.
---
The blocking survivors in the basement and holding the game hostage should not be a thing but there still needs to be enough space to attempt a body block on the stairs.
---
A second set of stairs solves both. Still a risky save, killer has 2 entrances to carry a survivor through and it makes tunneling off hooks and making a rush directly to the stairs less reliable. Territorial Imperative becomes far more useful too.
---
With the sheer amount of hooks these days, I have little use for the basement other than making a save take longer and adding a bit of pressure. Time to change the basement up a bit.
---
HOOOOOURGLAASSSS
---
This update is going to be fiasco. Another way to ruin the game. Build game around SWF lol.
---
Random players barely can make it out alive, but SWF it's a lot easier so yeah, definitely building game around SWF.
---
RIP DBD 2019.
---
YES. PLAYERS WAS ABUSING THE DEEP WOUND SYSTEM.
---
I mean to be fair, its kinda on bhvr for not just fixing it right away and instead banning people
---
I had it playing as kate the other day. I asked the killer, and it didn't affect them, so it is probably only for one person. Which survivor were you playing as?
---
The only time I can Kobe is when I want to kill myself. Wish I was a cunt and could actually unhook myself when I need it. Any tips on how to be a cunt?
---
It's not
---
I don't consider it tunneling if they had time to heal tbh
---
Back at you man.
---
Both decisive and Self care were nerfed so hard and how is using pallets and flashlight "stupid"?
---
I wasn't arguing who is the best killer overall. Pig is better thanks to her traps. I was arguing who would have an easier time in chases and I believe Legion will be able to down survivors faster than the Pig because of the fact that he gets the first hit for free. Having normal movement speed will do more for him than people give credit for.
---
Like you could make anything better
---
it's shocky daddy Doctor with his fancy skin

I dont see a hoodie on the store?
---
Recently with freddy, I've had 2 cut and dry instances. One where a survivor just disconnects as he is about to reach an open exit gate and one where 2 survivors disconnect exactly at the same time a few seconds into the match
---
Because memes sell.
---
A iron maiden would fit the best imo they are in the locker and then the entity comes and sticks its claws inside it from every side
---
"CONFESS TO YOUR CRIMES, STALE END PIECE OF WHITE BREAD!"
---
Legion released, and once survivors realized that they could disconnect from him with virtually no consequences, the entitlement carried over to other killers and loadouts. Now every other match has a survivor bitching out of it, at least.
---
Don't be a smart ass.
---
For real tho, the end game collapse looks lit af
---
give her the fucking candy, you monster
---
Y u didn't ready up tho?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If I were one of those survs and saw that the killer wouldn't ready up, even after 3-4 survivors are ready, I would also find that suspicious and perhaps dodge.
---
Agreed. If you're complaining about DS, you are the problem. Also, adrenaline is so situational, most of my games it is a waste of a perk slot because the team doesn't finish gens or the killer has noed. Dead hard is not reliable and easily counter-able once the killer knows a survivor has it.
---
Git gud
---
And he probably went and grabbed you out right after the cut too
---
I'm almost sure that DC's get insta reported by  the system
---
No shit but does he need two instadowns?
---
I think what they are trying to say, if you go into the game and intend to camp every hook you get with or without other survivors being there, then you are ruining the fun, and I agree. 
---
With the situation with all of the survivors around the hook, you could just chase them and try and down them instead of defending the survivor. If you are actively trying to down the survivors and not trying to keep the guy on the hook, then I don't think it counts as camping. You are chasing the survivors, and they made the bad play to do it near the hook. If you don't try and down the survivors and only hit them when they come close to the hook, then I think that counts as camping. I would only consider it camping if you are actively trying to only get the kill on the hooked guy, and have no intention of leaving them with survivors near the hook or not.
---
I see you went for the crying face
---
DBD should be like most of the mobas, if you DC, just make that person wait enough time that would be better stay in that game.
---
I bought this game at the free weekend to play with my freinds and i dont understand why people are dropping you off to run away? At first i thought they were just teasing and being dicks but that's never the case. I find it very nice but i dont understand why
---
It's ok. no hard feelings &lt;3
---
Facts.
---
DS maybe not but Dead Hard and Adrenaline are very good perks. Dead hard if used correctly is just as good as Mettle of Man and can be used many times. The slightly situational nature of it is what makes MoM slightly better. Adrenaline goes without saying as in SWF it's probably the best perk in the game for survivors.
---
It is indeed Frank picking on her, and apparently because I guess she cant remember after she goes to sleep and wakes up, and it saddens trapper.
---
wait, is dead hard a problem now?
---
Since launch*
---
Decisive isn't even good.  If Decisive works against you then that means you are tunneling and deserve the decisive's.  If everyone was bodyblocking that means they were not doing gens very quickly since it means they were doing gens together as opposed to spreading out.  It also means you get tons of time to wound them and make them heal up which wastes time since they can only Insta Heal X1
---
When!
---
damn if they‚Äôre saying shit like that to you, are you sure they‚Äôre a friend
---
how do you got that fancy looking perks?
---
Lmao you reached bbq then dropped bubba
---
I am a big fan of the first perk for sure.
---
Black metal!!!!!!!
---
Awwwww poor thing.
---
If a nerf to legions BASE power was required, then sure, but it wasn‚Äôt, BHVR should fixed the glitches and bugs. I like the new addition that your men‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt go down unless you‚Äôre out of the terror radius. Everything else was overdone. His power seems like it‚Äôs not even going to be useful since you have to wait a solid 20 seconds to use again if you miss the first strike.
---
At least they made him a 115 killer üòì
---
3. 2. 1. Entity, we have liftoff. The chainsaw is away, I repeat the chainsaw is away.
---
Now I can bask in amounts of bloodpoints that I'll never have!
---
Also you have my exact build. ;)
---
Well, considering the survivors have 3 minutes to get stuff done, or die, I wouldnt be too concerned
---
Does that even count as camping? I personally think if someone else is there you arent camping at all
---
Dude whats up your ass? People just want to play their games lol.
---
how 2 take a joke
---
Yeah, the others killers are harder to compete consistently against a team of 4 skilled survivors with voice-comm. Some of them need buffs.
---
It's bugged and a messaged popped up warning everyone not to use it.
---
Extra bih
---
You clearly don't understand how balancing works. The way it's supposed to go is that you balance everything around the best and most skilled players. If a highly skilled player can react and adapt to a gameplay mechanic, it is balanced. You *never* want to balance around potatoes
---
Big brain bean
---
dead hard is the same since 2017 july when it was releasaed and I sure you that I never saw someone bitch about it, I gess that every time a perk is nerfed, mains have to find a new one to bitch.
---
Bro bro bro bro I literally just bought LF 2 days ago for this. Fml
---
It's the Sky Pack, it's on gooses' twitter
---
True that, Ive met maybe 2 good nurses, the others are pretty bad, but even the good ones arent that hard for me to juke although you are right about bot teammates dying
---
There is currently a glitch with the 2 add-ons that when combined cause the mend timer to keep increasing for every case of the deep wound being applied to the survivor. This eventually reaches up to several minutes of mending for survivors.
---
The devs haven't fixed it yet because of their Legion rework coming soon. As a result, they issued a warning for players that use the blade add-ons with the consequence of bans.
---
a tip is to want to kill yourself
---
Deliverance
---
bUt tHeY wErEnT hAvInG fUn cAn yOu bLaMe tHeM!?!?
---
it was probably the last line that got me downvotes xD but oh well, reddit and the dbd playerbase are fickle beasts
---
Well... not to me, but apparently based on some responses I‚Äôm getting it is lol
---
Am I the only one that dislikes this? I feel like the game will be controlled to much by the killer. I don't really see much counterplay against this and 3 minutes isn't a long time imo I feel like it should be longer to allow cleansing of noed.
---
If the aura wasn't there and it was a little closer this could be a very cool screenshot. Maybe someone fan art this? That would look amazing.
---
I'd love this.
---
YeAh DoC=DC NO FUN &gt;:(
---
Camping is legit, but it ruins the game for that one survivor because it usually involves tunneling after the fact.
---
Use instadowns. Basically the only counter. Basically makes killers like Doctor, Freddy, Pig, etc even more useless. 
---
Barely affects Hillbilly and other top tier killers
---
just to clarify, you mean if another survivor opened the gate? and if so, I'd like to recommend making it activate only if the gens aren't powered
---
Shouldn‚Äôt they just disable the combo then?
---
They create several minute long mends due to a gamebreaking exploit I'm sure you were aware of going into the game.  They warned every babydick cheater ahead of time they were banning for exploiting the addons.  You got what you deserved.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work :(
---
How do you even know the amount of times you have escaped
---
Racism and sexism are a part of dbd
---
everyone should just leave a nurse match until BHVR redesigns these stupid heroes that completely ignore game mechanics (old legion and nurse)
---
Must be scary children you hang out with
---
yesterday a guy with 200 hours wished for my mum to die of cancer(she has it in remission just like i do. not the most dangerous type of cancer but i mean come on my grandma died of it 9 years ago). then he said he wants me to bury my dad next week(i buried him when i was 11) and also wished death upon my future children.
---
why?
---
i camped as Leatherdaddy after gates were opened.
---
my build was: BBQ, Bamboozle on 1 which was useless with the infinite in Groaning Storehouse, Enduring and Sloppy Butcher.
---
I'm planning on adding more to this idea. I'll take this under consideration.
---
Calling u/Julietcakes ! She would draw the shit out of this haha. Hook slam from orbit.
---
Many many blood moons ago ancient storys tell that freddy was a strong boy.
---
But then BHVR attacked and everything changed..
---
In fact freddy got neutered till a later point where he will be reworked and here we are at the end of April 2019 with a shit Freddy :(
---
It's fair for killers to have that anonymity, as there are perks that explicitly counter some powers in the game.
---
And what is your definition of overpowered? Regardless of your answer, some players may think that a killer you consider overpowered is manageable, or even a killer they enjoy playing against. You simply can't use your subjective idea of "fun" to rationalize a DC. Unless there's a technical problem, DCing ruins the "fun" that you seek for others involved.
---
Freddy Perkless is extremely weak since he generally relies on perks to cover weaknesses, such as ruin to fill out his slow starting games or spirit/fury to make him dangerous. Also takes a away his decent end game build. I don‚Äôt think the new legion is really weak, just boring as hell to play since it‚Äôs basically ‚Äúhit once with power, then just m1‚Äù not really that fun.
---
There he go. He shed his mortal coil, even if it was just for a few moments, to achieve feats we can only wish to achieve and reach true perfection.
---
I love this game sometimes.
---
They did tell you to not be using them. You got what you deserved
---
then fugg
---
I know that, I‚Äôve played since the beginning! 
---
But it doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore after all this time, because rework is confirmed and being revealed in a short period :3
---
Nurses on PC are straight broken. Good ones are ridiculously tough.
---
And I thought I was just having bad luck. I‚Äôve had games as the Plague where 3 of the survivors disconnect, with one leaving as soon as he got infected. It‚Äôs just getting annoying at this point.
---
Nice man, love the vest! Your corpse paint is on point, I would have been so psyched to bump into you.
---
But what... If it's going to be shit? :(
---
thats me but i wait before every pallet clicking my flashlight + crouching so the killer can keep up while my 3 swf (on voice) are genrushing, then i either escape or dc when i get downed /s
---
Nah. You just went for the ez karma but came out lookin like OhpeDo.
---
THANK YOU. Someone had to say it.
---
if you need a counter to self care, get nurses. its changed my games. I CAN SEE YOU HEALING, MEGAN.
---
Thanks
---
It's called sportsmanship. You play the game out, you move on, and you forget about it. If you can't handle whatever inconvenience is thrown in your direction in this game, and believe you have the right to ruin the experience of 4 other players, then switch games. 
---
Like, quite literally, it's a bannable offense to DC consistently. Doesn't that signal to you in any way that maybe you shouldn't be DCing for the sake of avoiding certain add-ons/killers/perks, or whatever that rustles your jimmies??

Because it's a nice gesture mainly. It also could be pity or respect for good play. Killers get enough BPs anyway that it's not a big deal to let one person go, I don't mind giving survivors some extra BPs because I know how rough it is.
---
I know there at least used to be because (if o remember correctly) they banned nurse for one of the comps
---
My pig's bloodweb has been really bad. I personally don't like NOED that much, i think it's in a good spot. I only use it because I don't have any (in my opinion) better perks. Haunted ground is a very good perk and got me a triple down about a minute into the game which was fun
---
Ya yeet. Would have loved to bump into you as well. Everybody thought I was the crow!
---
That‚Äôs a fact jack.
---
But for real the corpse paint is pretty good !!
---
Yeet. Yeah it would have been fun bumping into you too. Everyone thought I was the crow!
---
Really, lol I put it on in five minutes because I was late.
---
And you make somebody's game unfun because you DC'ed. That is very selfish move.
---
Competitive DBD? Those were some dark times
---
LMAO the music
---
Grays anatomy looks like the legion bug going around rn. Maybe have it set at a cap?
---
No it isn‚Äôt just doing the objective because it ignores every other objective. You just have zero control over generators and that‚Äôs why you struggle with it. I never struggle with it as killer, and when I do, it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt monitor the generators.
---
Just make the exit gates extra v e r t i c l e
---
It's rare to play any game for 5k hours and not experience extreme or permanent burnout at some point. Even when the game is pumping out new content, that's a fuckton of hours: 200 *days* worth of playing. Depending on when you got those hours in, that's like a full work week of gaming every week.
---
Honestly, considering how simple DBD is, I'm surprised you made it that far. People with thousands of hours in this game must either be completely jaded or have the patience of a saint in my eyes.
---
Dose survivors lose their items and offerings when they got lobby dodged? No.
---
"He's fat but he's fast"
---
In battlefront 2 palpatine had an exploit that allowed him to shoot lightning through the wall. Did Dice ban people for using him? No, they removed the character, fixed the exploit, and put him back in.
---
BHVR banning people for using an exploit that is possible to not know about is ignorant and bullshit.
---
ThEy pUt A WaRnIng....yeah, cool. How many people probably just spam the button to skip that menu? Its just wrong.
---
I mean, I've never cared for GG, so I generally don't say it because it means nothing. If there was something out of the ordinary that deserve commendation, I'll say "x was some really good shit" because it actually means something. Especially if I have match chat in-game on other titles, I'll just say it... In the game.
---
Every killer: plays like an absolute dick bag
---
Also every killer: why is everyone DCing
---
God yess... mmm my snacky boi dwight
---
The timer should get faster if someone is hooked imo. Increases the tension, do you risk getting killed to save your Friend or do you save yourself? BHVR WYD???
---
I've had someone say worse stuff to me in Overwatch. Never had something as bad as this happen:
---
I got told to cut myself.  I wouldnt've quit Overwatch because of it if I hadn't tried to before and haven't had other family members who have. I immediately got off after that game and went to my room to cry.
---
 Players who say extemely rude things are the main problem in video games. They don't even deserve to play video games. I got banned for just saying curse words in Overwatch, but that guy didn't get banned at all. It's common sense to not tell someone to die of cancer, kill themself, cut themself, etc. sadly, not everyone can use something called a brain. :(
---
You're great. I love seeing your comments
---
I don't think thier system advanced enough, this game plays like a beta. So much glitches that never get fix. I play other games and when there's a problem with a certain item or character they disable them until it's fix.

I went for downvotes, you brought up children

Worth it
---
You have 3 options:
---
1. Play someone with a built-in counter like Billy, then you have to use it every time.
---
2. Tunnel the shit out of the mom user to get it burnt early, in which case there's decisive and bt to punish you, and a chance of giving them a second charge of mom.
---
3. Win the game before mom comes into play. Ignore the obsession, kill all the other survivors and pray that they don't also have Mettle, which they do. Hatch is the only time mettle's weakness will realy hurt, as letting them go after mom activates is too big a tradeoff for any other scenario.

---
Different perks on different killers, I play all killers . Mostly ruin n BBQ , on pig/spirit I'll run surveillance nurses calling... Spirit fury + enduring on clown/Myers. Stuff like that .
---
 I don't run perks expecting to lose and get a cheap kill off survivors successfully doing 5 gens.
---
THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING
---
Nah Ochido is the one everybody hates.
---
I don‚Äôt play games with him anymore. When apex legends came out we tried it out so i played with him again for a few days. Boy i made a mistake, He did the same thing in apex legends saying i should drop the good gear because it would be wasted on me and some other back handed comments. Comments like that are not needed and especially coming from a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. Hes really chill and cool in person but i just dont like playing with him and really keep him at a distance now.
---
and also i tap-taping gens cos im eating chips

If she destroyed your team she kind of deserves her 4K though don‚Äôt you think?

Those are the pallets behaviour got rid of in that one update
---
yeah... 
---
i mean i did try to kill myself multiple times since actually childhood, people tell me to kill myself in games all the time. that stuff is just not sensitive matter for me cause tbh a person can deal with these kind of things with proper thinking. but i can't control my or my mother's cancer and thinking about how helpless i am in the face of disease makes me feel so small and having absolutely no control over my life(which of course i don't have but facing it is harsh). i got diagnosed with cancer in 2013, got a chemo, it got in remission. i don't know if it will come out again. don't know if my mum will get it back soon too. 
---
and frankly i don't want to think about my deceased father when i play videogames. i was too young to lose him.
---
bhvr is boring to do this
---
Ok. Then face camping and  tunneling should be banable with that logic. 
---
I really really couldnt care less about anyones opinion of how i play. I buy the game to enjoy it. If i dont there is no reason of me to tolerate it.
---
i'm just curious, how this comes up in people's head? 
---
like my nasty side is that i tell them what i'd do to their bodies for making me feel unpleasant (like do a bunch of small cuts and dump them in feces for the infection to spread and watch them slowly die there). but it never occurred my mind to wish for their loved ones to die of something. where does it come from?
---
Is mettle of man really good? Most of the survivors that run it are dumb.
---
Supposedly they are reworking some aspect of Pig for the endgame collapse. Hopefully they don't just completely gut one aspect of her kit and call it a day..
---
yknow, bhvr did work on a ed edd n eddy game long ago. so this is basically confirmed
---

---
Yes, loved the movie.
---
i like watching his streams but his attitude about other players and the game can get tired really fast

i am right to the point

Behind the mask: The rise of Leslie Vernon. A clever mockumentary of slasher flicks that is simultaneously a really good slasher flick.
---
1. Like I said I run different perks o different killers. I run "meta builds" as you call it but I also run other builds. I stated the ones I run most because it would take all day to list out every different build on every killer.
---
2 . Even if I ran "meta builds" every game, they don't require me to lose 5 gens in order to work for me. I can't name one decent killer main streamer that doesn't run "meta builds" , and I can't name one that runs noed.
---
Unless you're running nurse on PC or playing vs yellow ranks you cannot play without ruin. Period.
---
So the goal of killers isn‚Äôt to kill and the goal of survivors isn‚Äôt to survive. You are dumb
---
Yeah, the Hex totems have a crackling fire sound.
---
You do realize there‚Äôs more to killing and surviving than just killing and surviving right? Jesus Christ you‚Äôre a moron
---
BHVR literally made a formal announcement that tunneling and camping aren't considered as exploits or bannable offenses. You're just being wilfully ignorant to make an argument in favor of DCing for your own enjoyment.
---
If you don't care about how you DCing negatively affects the game for four other players, move on to a single player game so that we don't have to deal with your bullshit behavior.
---
At this point i just expect everyone to be toxic
---
Yeah it‚Äôs unfair, but that‚Äôs the way it should be.

‚ÄúBehind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon‚Äù
---
I recommend it if you haven‚Äôt seen it.  It‚Äôs kind of a mockumentary about a guy that has a film crew follow him around as he creates his slasher/masked killer legacy.  I kind of can‚Äôt really say more without spoiling the set-up.
---
I dunno. Thats why I'm asking
---
I thought it was AngryPug the giant manchild that we all hated
---
What do you define as toxic? For me it‚Äôs multiple flashlight clicks and/or teabagging
---
But if you have a meta build, it is far less likely that the gens will get done super quickly than if you used perks like the third seal, knockout, Franklin's and noed. If someone used noed with a meta build I could see where you are coming from, but if somebody uses noed on a non meta killer or build, then that could be counted as making up for not having the gens not be completed in the first place.
---
I've always thought it was culvasac, TIL.
---
Is the quote supposed to be backwards?
---
Nope
---
I wish it not be as it are but sadly be it do.
---
He left
---
Its a handful of things from either side. Sometimes you can tell its in jest and others its pure toxicity, like a killer nodding at you or facecamping cause of a long run, survivors clicking and teabagging. Most the time i dont get mad or anything but when its a really close match or chase and they act up it just sucks.
---
Well, I had watched noob3s video 50+ wins in a row (something like that.) A subreddit had put a bounty on his spree worth 100 dollars saying that he represented everything wrong with the community.
---
That's my horse could be a progressively stacking debuff perk. Each time you strike a survivor, the time it takes for them to heal or be healed is increased by 3/4/5% stacking 3 times.
---
I can see it now, carrying the last survivor to the hatch, only to set them down next to it and close it.
---
I hate rank reset because of that I never get to rank 10 because I don‚Äôt play a lot then go against campers
---
After it has hit 3 charges the perk is active, then it resets after you go down, and will start building charges again after that.
---

I'm curious to how you think being required to wait an extra 7 seconds to hit someone is "good".
---
Also, what rank are you?
---
It really is a great game, but this is ruining a lot of players experience.
---
I ended up dying very shortly after because I had no idea where the hatch was. I didn't even bother trying to get a chase going, I just teabagged while he hit me twice and then let him hook me. At least it was quick, but it took forever to find a game with decent ping only for this to be the result, which is a shame.
---
You smell that? Smells like the dead sea
---
Update: after wondering "How could I possibly get a game even worse than that? Onward and upward!" and queueing again, I got a game with [2 people in it instead of 3.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/99264336471535616/568991495797866498/381210_20190419193721_1.png) Best part, Myers still hooked my ass even after my other teammate DC'd.

Freddy is a lot of fun, definitely one of my favorites. He can be really good when things go right, but when things don't go right it's a constant uphill battle to gain back momentum.
---
The main problems are the transition time and the dream world RNG. The 7 second transition doesn't stop actions. It gives them enough time to get to a safe loop or even finish a gen or heal right in your face.  
---
With the dream world, if you can keep survivors in the dream world then you can stall the game enough for chases. If you can't keep survivors in dream world then youre a powerless M1 killer. The only thing that determines this is skill check RNG.
---
Finding the hatch should not be what rewards you a final kill - killing the final survivor is what should do that.
---
You're simultaneously accusing Survivors of being entitled while presenting a Killer centric view of being entitled to free kills. Think of that what you will.
---
only they dont put a warning says idiots must stay away from this game
---
they will lose a lot of players
---
OchiDo over a year ago got banned on pc. he was extremely toxic, was exploiting bugs and even witch hunting. switched to ps4 where he got better. i mean i'm no fan but i can see how kids like his loud obnoxious style. then he got banned again and now switched back to pc and hides his account to not get banned again. i mean he's still loud and obnoxious but i honestly don't understand why everyone hates him still after months on ps4 where he never really did anything bad. 
---
i also understand why many months ago people disliked no0b3. i was one of them. cause he wasn't loud and obnoxious but his playstyle used to be as toxic as OchiDo's. the only difference basically is that he didn't shittalk people, i guess. no0b3 is now better too. i still dislike him but now it's purely cause of how he does his editing and how inconsistent and boring he is. 
---
people also tend to dislike tru3ta1ent. i have split feelings towards him. but he's definitely very opinionated and it doesn't make him look good cause unfortunately when you're somewhat known you're not allowed to be this way(which is sad tbh, wish people could realize he's just a man, he doesn't have to be neutral).
---
yep Janes dummy THICC ass blocks everything
---
They did put a warning. A giant one. Right at the game launch in the news section when they add new news. If it was ignored, that‚Äôs on the people ignoring it.
---
I understand there are some circumstances where survivors lag out due to internet but cmon y‚Äôall... I‚Äôve been having this same problem and it‚Äôs always in situations where the survivor clearly rage quits the game. And it‚Äôs literally every other game that it happens now.

The reason I did it is because of mental disorders or other things that make it harder to control your emotions. Whenever I used to get angry I usually  got REALLY angry.
---
I didn't really think about the  consequences whenever I was about to say anything rude or do anything I shouldn't do, I'd just say/do it. If I got extremely angry I'd kick others.
---
Thankfully I started controlling my anger better and the most I'll do is scream and yell. Meltdowns have always been a problem for me ;( It's not as worse as it was for me before. I don't tell people I hope they get ****d, that their mother dug a hole and drowned in it, or other rude things.

I have no idea what it's like for those who aren't me, so I can only speak for myself. Everyone who says stuff like that do it for different reasons. If only we could all control it, but we're not all lucky

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rage quitting or their internet it‚Äôs probably just a bug because many other people are experiencing the same problem. Also I believe that on the survivors end it says that the host disconnected but in reality you are the one who disconnected.

(nothing D: i mean nothing, it's a joke, i'm married. and have migraine strike right now, don't judge me for shit jokes)

So how do you play good against him then?

You loop him and use your 7 seconds wisely. 
---
Objectively the worst killer in the game.
---
The prequel side of the internet is a pathway to many memes, some considered to be shitposts.
---
My Freddy is low level. I ran Fired Up and another perk I can‚Äôt recal the name of but makes me attack 20% faster. If they wanna DC that‚Äôs fine. Just makes the game easy for me and I still get quitter points.
---
I had a Spirit tell me she only found me because my hand was sticking out the side of a locker. Noticed it a few times since while playing Killer.

I'd play this

Got pissed off at being looped, wish I had bamboozle instead of BS
---
Good advice, not what they asked for

They give you a notice when you log in to specifically not use both add ons or they'll ban you. Next time read the news pop up.
---
I mean it is useless he literally has no use for it, he can detect more people nearby sure but he can‚Äôt down people with it. It has no benefit besides maybe telling you there‚Äôs someone else nearby and wasting a whopping 10 seconds of men‚Äôs time. Sure he can vault pallets but what‚Äôs the point if you can‚Äôt use it to down the stun is long enough they have time to get to the other side of the pallet again and your back to square one.

---
If the logo does not animate for at least 15 seconds, you are are the issue and everybody else is stuck waiting until you use Task Manager to close out. 
---
If your logo is animating, you are guaranteed not the issue and you do not need to disconnect. Be patient and eventually the issue will leave. 
---
Or they'll be totally oblivious and you'll wait until it's a 1v1 when the game eventually loads in.
---
#THANK YOU
---
It didn't take skill to rush a hatch and wait to press a key when a noise happens, either.
---
I think a 50/50 on most maps is fine. At least both players will still be doing stuff instead of standing around. If you'd rather camp the hatch without closing it, you can be that guy. I'll be the guy 99% what's left in response then popping 3 and rushing the hatch.
---
Thanks!
---
Life has many hooks, ed boys
---
I cant handle it pls stop
---
Honestly if it works multiple times I might try it out on my own, since I like to tank hits for my allies which I think was the intended use. I just dislike the aura reveal thing as it doesn't fit my usually stealthy playstyle, and I think it's actually a bit weak due to all the dumb counters. (Same with Adred and Dead Hard tbh I find them to be really bad situational perks that I hardly ever use. Haven't used old or new DS yet.)
---
I really think the perk needs heavy tweaking as right now you only really run it if you want a free second chance perk and stopped using Decisive Strike.
---
lol netcode
---
Seriously, they keep pushing content on top of staggering amounts of bugs, it's really getting tedious.
---
Dead Hard ain't shit except in clutch moments where that speed boost actually pushes you to a pallet on time. 
---
Nurse is arguably the only killer that is consistently fucked by Dead Hard. 
---
All you have to do to counter this perk is not swing until the survivor dashes. Bam. Countered.
---
That was me as huntress, I was super confused when that happened. I think the feng min tried calling me names after?
---
yeah I dunno whats goin on here...
---
You struggle if they stop near a hook and it seems like they were taking you hatch searching.
---
IKR so rare!
---
It's probably the radius because people generally just picture it as a circle extending from the killer
---
I'd be scared if Michael could vault pallets, it was already scary enough with the chainsaw in that old glitch.
---
Your description made me laugh tho, thanks for it xD
---
I‚Äôd love it if I could just hold down X. I‚Äôve died so many times because I fucked up the rhythm
---
Basicly, the killer makes 20-30k BP while survivors may be 5-15k on average.  If you're the last alive and the hatch is spawned and the killer happened to notice it, they may be nice enough to just give it to you so you can get 7k BP vs the killer getting about 3k BP for hooking you to kill you.
---
Freddy‚Äôs main weakness:  He sucks at defending objectives and can do fuck-all at the end-game.
---
The meta right now:  Defend objectives at all costs and be ready to score most of your kills end-game.
---
I actually don‚Äôt think Freddy is the worst killer right now.  Wraith‚Äôs power is literally fucking useless if the survivors are on comms, which most are, and even if they aren‚Äôt he can‚Äôt do shit unless they are completely clueless and deaf.  All other stealth killers get stealth along with something else.  Pig gets a dash attack and roadblocks, Freddy gets true-sight and √ºber-thanatophobia, Spirit goes totally invisible and leaves behind a decoy to trick survivors, Myers gets Exposed, Wraith... literally only stealths.  And he does it worse than 3/4 of the other stealth killers.  Freddy is still better than Wraith IMO just because his power actually does 3 things well rather than just 1 mediocrely, but even so his weaknesses are in the exact areas the current meta is built around, which nullifies almost all of his strength and makes him, in my opinion, the 2nd or 3rd worst killer.
---
It shouldn't be a guaranteed survival either though. It just comes across to me that it is more focused on ending the game as opposed to giving killers/survivors an equal chance at a positive outcome. 
---
All I'm saying is that if your options are finding the hatch and closing it or let the hatch stay open and trying to find the survivor either outcome 9/10 times will result in the survivor escaping. 
---
Especially if they rework Pig/Remember Me to not work on Endgame Collapse.
---
Huntress.
---
Or Plague, that would be funny
---
I got to rank 8 with Freddy tried out Billy was like ‚Äúwhy did I play a killer with a power that allows him to hit survivors‚Äù this was awhile ago so I didn‚Äôt really now he was underpowered and I only had 50 hours when I started playing him.
---
That ashy slashy is on point
---
Yeah, Claudette was saying you should have quit. But she was just being a jerk about it. I thought it was funny üòÅ
---
The Killer has to let you do a few gens to make the game go past 9 minutes, or they get shat on by Gatekeeper.
---
that last line is amazing.
---
It seems to happen when you close the game early or didn't play a match after you spent all those bps
---
He's actually a pretty good killer for getting lots of points. If you have at least a yellow range addon, you're set the entire match if you know the playstyle.
---
What the actual fuck
---
Well if you‚Äôre playing hillbilly,nurse,spirit,trapper you can guarantee a kill easy it‚Äôs definitely not 9/10 survivor escaping lmao
---
They need to find happiness before they get nerfed down to D tier with the pedo
---
niceme.me but honestly not really? Lampkin is fucking huge and one of Trapper's biggest weaknesses is map size, especially if you don't have good bag addons. Don't get me wrong if you take Stitched Bag and either Tar Bottle or good Setting Addons Trapper on Lampkin is fucking scary, but as an avid Trapper player I'd much rather play him on Coal Tower, Badham Preschool, Groaning Storehouse, or Father Campbell's Chapel.
---
Goddamn FCC for Trapper is the best. I think I have something like an 80% win rate on that map as Trapper. It's the 4th smallest map in the game (next to Rancid Abattoir [also a good map but ew Coldwind], Coal Tower [very open with a lot of vaults is the main issue. Hard to find good trap spots], and Lery's [see previous, also white floors make me cry when I use Tar Bottle]) and there are very few good loops which you can just jam traps on and then use your default killer powers to stomp the rest of the game.
---
Haddonfield makes me smile a bit as Trapper. Father Cambel's makes me grin wickedly.
---
Yes I love it.
---
Competitively, he's bad. But generally, he's good and fun. Having to take 7 seconds to put someone to sleep so you can *hit* them, and do normal Killer stuff is a problem, as well as the various RNG chances for skill checks to wake up even during a chase is a problem.

This is something that is coming, yes. 
---
I don't recall if it is in the coming PTB or waiting for dedicated servers, but games that lose a player while loading will boot everybody else back to the lobby and look for someone else to join.
---
I would of let someone get hatch but like the feng was teabagging me and that made me salty ngl. You guys did good though props to you three.
---
How so? Maybe Hillbilly and Nurse, because they can traverse the map fast, but it doesn't guarentee that you will find them. They can still use a key to hit up the hatch. Now is it practical to bring a key to every map, no but it does make it to where the killer has to decide which to go for. They choose the wrong door initially they lose, survivor decides to go for hatch after killer closes it with key, they lose.
---
Its not toxic to use the flashlight for saves.....
---
If you're playing an M1 killer it's incredible. It's not much of a problem for Billy and doesn't do anything against Nurse. It only really serves to make the divide between tiers larger.
---
You technically can do them before the killer closes the hatch. They're still going to change the perk in some way.
---
36m radius from the point of the killer. 
---
The sound of the heartbeat and shit is based on how close you are based on the max range. If you are still 23m from the killer, the heartbeat will only be at 25%  
---
So, if the killer's range is only 8m, you're going to go from 0-100% real fast.
---
It‚Äôs alright, I just wanted to get to next match. So I get it.
---
If they made the ranking system mean anything and with the end game adjustment, maybe, but I definitely don‚Äôt see DBD as a ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù game as it is right now. There‚Äôs definitely issues that need to be taken care of before the game gets things such as an adjusted map pool imo. Upvote for the last lime though lmfao

Interestingly enough before I decided that the current state of the game isn't very fun for me, as a casual Clown main, I had a game where I tried to play as Wraith after turning my messages back to Public, I didn't get any shit mail for having NOED and getting two kills with it..
---
My P3 on Trapper was fairly recent, maybe a couple of months ago. He was sitting at P2-45 during my somewhat lengthy hiatus from the game (I am a Legacy player), so he's still pretty young despite having all of my Teachables maxed.
---
"Terror radius" I think it's a radius.
---
All 4 survivors can use it though.
---
[deleted]
---
Okay but what was *TAPP* thinking during all that?! Please tell me you messaged him to ask him if he saw that.
---
Lol had this happen one. Two survivors left and they‚Äôre both on the hook. I afk for a few seconds waiting for them to die and end the match only to look back two minutes later to see one Kobe‚Äôd and rescued the other. Caught up to one but the other got the hatch &gt;.&gt;
---
I had two matches in a row where I hit someone as clown and the game kicked me instantly to a victory screen. Really annoying
---
Ohh ok, it‚Äôs basically radius. Thanks.
---
I did message him and he was just as confused as I was üòÇ
---
UNLIMITED POWER BITCHS!
---
u must b a console player...
---
NOED with Infinite Tier 3? 
---
(Mind blown)
---
It also looks like even if five generators are done and there is one survivor left it spawns the hatch. How does that benefit the killer at all? 
---
It literally hands them ways out when in any other match  it would ensure that they died to the killer.
---
It's so bad it's good.
---
I'm sure noob3 is a Survivor main, and people who don't cross over sides frequently tend to piss off the other side for encouraging certain types of behavior.
---
Lmfaoo your fine
---
bruh you really gonna do my boy plank like that?
---
Having an extra way to hide on one map is now considered an unfair advantage? That's like saying that Lery's shouldn't have walls. Do you want the survivors to just stand out in plain sight? They literally have one job: survive. It's in their title for crying out loud.
---
It was a week or two ago. When they also announced making survivor pips easier to get and also infinite loading screens.
---
The walk of shame
---
One... two... three strikes! YOU'RE OUT
---
I'm pretty sure there were no perks, items, and add-ons allowed in that particular tournament. Clown was also banned.
---
Ahhh gotcha. But old ds if you activated it at the end and just waited on it that's a game changer. Can't tell you how many end game saves I got having the killer think I missed it when I just didn't hit it.
---
the corn is impossible to see in as killer. It's really really bad, especially with how messed up scratch marks are now
---
Special power is he can teleport around the map through lockers. If there is a survivor within 10 meters Ralph moves 30% faster and their aura is revealed. Is the survivor is in the locker Ralph auto takes them out as he steps out of the lockers.
---
I mean, it's super common though...
---
Also camping is a gamble. And I'm honestly talking more patrolling than facecamping tbh. But it either pays off or you lose literally everybody else. If by the time I catch one person, Ruin is destroyed and there's only 2 gens left, you can be sure I'm going to be guarding the hook much more closely. Sometimes it pays off in big ways, with survivors getting greedy and allowing a lot of hook trades and injures.   
---
Sometimes it backfires and I lose everything. Camping right out the gate is stupid, I totally agree. But camping as a last ditch effort to salvage a loss? It's very much legit and incredibly high risk due to the number of anti-camping and anti-tunnel perks.
---
I never really watched, im not into esports/competitive stuff
---
I just like to watch the world burn
---
They've confirmed they are changing remember me and left behind when the mid patch update hits
---
#CEASE
---
Did literally anyone use this perk to begin with?
---
Rolf's mori has him wield the Hat of Discipline
---
Why show her :(, that is just cruel, that is clearly the entity at work.
---
I get what you mean, but I seem to have pretty good luck finding survivors running through it. It just requires a lot more focus. Besides, it's only like a 1/20 chance and not everyone has a heart locket offering to run.
---
Even on pc she still takes the most skill? Have you touched nurse at all dude? Seriously answer me that.
---
That only happens if there's one survivor left and the Hatch gets slammed shut. That's the only way the killer can voluntarily begin the endgame without having all the generators powered. The exits are powered but the countdown begins anyway if the Hatch is closed. 
---
Besides, if you think about it, there are only two reasons why the Killer would ever want to finish an exit gate: to Trigger Blood Warden or to concede defeat. There's literally no other reason given the fact that the countdown lasts all of three minutes.
---
Who the fuck said the game was killer sided lol literally every single patch of the game the survivors had the edge. The first increments were ridiculously unbalanced in the survivors' favor. Thankfully nobody knew what they were doing back then

I can only upvote once and that makes me sad. Really love the art!

Do you have anything from your perspective?
---
I don't know how I feel about this..
---
What about the shoe?
---
Nurse is cancer in general against the highly skilled ones who literally down you in 2 seconds since you have no chance in counterplaying them, can't blame people DCing in general zz
---
Stop making me look weak by association. Honest to fuck. It's not difficult to see them once you get good.
---
Looks awesome! Love the Ashy. What‚Äôd you use to paint your face?
---
Wait...is there a dead by deadgays subreddit?
---
Agreed. It turned a game state where the final survivor has no out and will die to the killer into one where survivors always have a way out. And yeah, most killers who cant cross the map in an instant will just not make it to the exit gate in time.
---
New item is jaw breakers üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
He might be referring to the see-though wood walls at every tile that's associated with "Corn" maps. It does give survivors an unfair advantage when it comes to looping them. Only Nurse can really use them as an advantage
---
Why can't they just fix their fucking game?
---
Legit this i dont understand why people get annoyed when killers camp after the gates are open,like what the fuck are they supposed to do, i never get annoyed when i get camped when the gates are done because its my fault for getting downed and they cant do anything else
---
Don't forget about he see-through wood walls on Farm maps that give the survivors an unfair advantage
---
I give them a gg if it was an intense match whether i win or lose
---
Freddy is unpopular, tons don't find him interesting/fun to play against just like Nurse. If they want to suicide on hook then let them lmao
---
I hope for you that was a joke?
---
OP Nurse main as well? I was too so I can feel the pain from here lol
---
Lmao you really posted it
---
The killer DC'd üòü. Hillbilly at lerys so I dont blame him lol
---
Those of us that spend more time repairing than saving people who trade hooks with four generators left, yes.
---
Don't be stupid.
---
Yes.
---
Pressing "Space" (Or you key or choosing) to let go would be my preference
---
Okay but honestly you can't just had one Ed. You need the full trio. Go big or go home. Survivor Legion where you can pick which one just by cosmetic options.
---
When you are playing Pig and get looped in the shack for 5 minutes.
---
Good survivors don‚Äôt exist
---
YESSSS YES I APPROVE OF THIS
---
Imagine calling Ruin OP.
---
Imagine refering to Ruin in all caps.
---
Sadly I do not. I was going to upload it somewhere but I forgot to save it ;-;.
---
I fuckin ALMOST HAD YHE PERFECT ENDING FIRST RUN AND THEN I GOT KARA LUTHER AND ALICE KILLED LAST SECOND I WAS SO DEVASTATED
---
3 blink gamer
---
If a survivor disconnects immediately after I down them in a chase then I seriously doubt it was anything to do with connection. But yes, there are situations where what you described does happen
---
Yea I figured I‚Äôd have to put spirit down. The thing is, My main problem with her is that I bamboozle myself and then I lose people 99% of the time. I‚Äôm thinking of switching to huntress or plague
---
Shot, BHVR you want my money? Do this. I'll pay $20 for this.
---
I find that most people who use it are really toxic. It's really disheartening to play against that teabagging P3 Claudette who loops you for 2 gens, then gets Borrowed Time unhooked instantly, loops you for another 2 gens, gets the MoM hit off, and then gets Adred and Sprint Bursts away. All while teabagging you at every single pallet.
---
I think these mechanics are fine on their own (even MoM, though I think that perk is far too easy to activate currently) but combined it creates a real shitshow of toxic bullshit.
---
I've 4ked as Freddy 3 times and didn't get it. I'm dying on the inside here.
---
I played survivor today, and the first 4 games had at least one DC. I hate how people get so salty that they decide to fuck everyone else over.
---
The first game, someone DC'd because they went down. Second game, someone DC'd because they went down, and another person just gave up and killed themselves on hook. Third game, someone DC'd right as the match started. And the fourth game, the killer DC'd because they got ran around for like 30 seconds.
---
It's no fun for anyone involved, it just ruins the entire match for both sides.
---
 Honestly its just a list of Common Sense spelled out for everyone to see. The inherent problem of "unwritten rules" is that they're more of guidelines that nobody is obligated to follow. I know it won't change anyone, but I felt if I expressed the rules I follow when playing this game for everyone to see, maybe others might at least have them in mind when playing, whether they use them or not. 
---
Thank you for your enthusiastic reply, and I hope you have fun playing.
---
Imagine not being smart enough to realize that RUIN (all caps, just how you like it.) can often delay the game for so long it effectively doubles the time the killer has.
---
Imagine not realizing that level of RNG isn't healthy for a game.
---
Imagine not understanding that just because 1 player is good enough to play around RUIN, the other 3 aren't, and will tank the 1 as a result.
---
guess i should have played with my food
---
I do love me some Whispers. Great for getting that first person. Even better for getting that last person that just walks around the map looking for hatch.
---
Devs buffed it to 24% but returned to 16% because of Legion. I guess it will be buffed again after the update.
---
It‚Äôs called blocking.
---
My problem is trying to get adept killer trophy‚Äôs and most unique perks suck.
---
No. Just a 4K
---
They make them spawn
---
Lmao if I hear that one more time as a defense, I'm going to scream.
---
Yeah Survivors can see through those but apparently I can't stalk as Myers through those.
---
I just had a match where i got a 4k with her without a single gen going off (mild flex), i tend to play her like any other killer but because i play around sound more than i do sight, adjusting to her power is fairly easy, possibly something you should try.
---
I recently stopped at the end of 2018 but I have playing since launch
---
Caaaarl that killes people
---
Upvoted
---
Hard agree. I'm mostly a survivor main now. Killer is just an annoying chore.
---
If I play killer and they completely irritated the crap out of me and then send me gg it‚Äôs so petty and annoying. You know I didn‚Äôt have a good game when you the rest escaped.
---
OH yeah, well everyone has that problem. It's just a numbers game until you find the right group of idiots.
---
More on my Twitter @yaboyzooch
---
if you wasted all the pallets in the map without a down, all the gens should be fucking done LMAO. That is literally how this game goes if nobody is stupid in it.
---
First you get the abs, then you get the stabs.
---
Honestly I'd love to see a Dead by daylight rendition of the characters and the cul de sac
---
IMHO there's a slight difference. Survivor bodyblocking is to stop unhooks and allow a survivor to wiggle free. Killer bodyblocking is actually allowed as long as it's with intent to gain an advantage and doesn't end up turning into a hostage situation where the other player's only way out is to DC.
---
Months ago (About 7) [they said](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9fkejw/the_final_word_these_are_not_reportable/?st=jup1dl30&amp;sh=7d15331f) bodyblocking wasn't bannable, but holding a game hostage is.
---
Basically doing it to gain madness or wait out borrowed time is fine. (Sadly Myers loses his collision when stalking so no sucking a survivor dry of stalk juice to get that Tombstone quicker) Hell I think even doing it as Pig is fine too to make bear traps go off.
---
I think on twitter they said they're looking into a way to prevent bodyblocks during the collapse because it's a bit cheesey. I think bodyblocking during the actual collapse is fine, but doing it at match-start after someone rescues a basement hook and hoping the other 2 survivors do the gens and start the countdown might be borderline hostage. (Not to mention not very viable)
---
OH, were you at Fanx? If so, we were there too o/!
---
Trapper is hot ok leave me alone

https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Ruin
---
Imagine not checking the Wiki or in-game perk name before writing a rant on Reddit.
---
Imagine not being able to find totems.
---
Imagine calling a Hex perk OP when there is literally [a perk in the game](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Small_Game) that allows you to find all the totems in about a minute total.
---
Imagine not being able to hit Great Skill Checks.
---
I mean if you play bubba that way, you kinda got it coming. So.
---
Why the good fuck are you bitching about T3 perks?
---
Why do you let teabagging affect you on any goddamn level?
---
Your job's to get rid of pallets. lmao. Let them drop that shit. Bust it and continue the chase.
---
You gotta get your mind right, man. This mental weakness isn't healthy.
---
It's just practice, homie. Match by match. Don't blame the players. Don't blame the game. Blame yourself. Analyze your mistakes and fucking correct them.
---
They can show up with iridescent king, too. Otherwise they do not spawn.
---
Pig is getting changed because of the collapse.
---
Sadly yes. Was changed. IMHO it's a dumb change considering how hard a double pip can be.
---
Ty so much nice of you to say. I draw em on paper first then take a pic and do the coloring on my phone with autodesk sketchbook.
---
Taunting the killer gets the killer to focus on the teabagging survivor only, who most likely is very good at pallet looping and therefore buying their team time. You can spin both things into being legitimate strategies but you can still call both dick moves regardless.
---
So a quick reddit search and it seems that there has been recent tournaments that are disappointing. It looks like whomever organizes it does not do a good job.
---
That doesn‚Äôt even make sense... the requirement for double pipping depends on your rank and why is it fair survivors just have to escape when killers have to do so much?
---
Ds is already situational enough. The fact that the prompt is delayed enough to give killers a second or two to move/rehook is stupid. They should make the prompt pop up sooner so this doesn‚Äôt happen.
---
He was still running when you disconnected, looks like you DC'd (red connection)
---
uhm, those are the meta perks? you can't force someone to not run those perks. what's even funnier is that Adrenaline is really situational if you and your team don't focus on gens and DH is completely useless if there aren't any pallets to extend the loop. with MoM i agree, it's kind of stupid, but no one can force me to not run it. the same goes for my killers as well, no one can tell me to not run BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's, M&amp;A, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle etc since those are meta perks. like, i don't think a killer can expect from a survivor to run Deja Vu or a survivor expecting from a killer to run Unrelenting.
---
You can‚Äôt improve when survivors have the upper hand in these issues, tell me how someone can improve when survivors like he said are bringing keys and sabotaging hooks (which is becoming more often.)
---
Does the Pope shit in the woods? That is a yes btw
---
What about his chickens? Maybe he harnessing the power of animals that we have been looking for in a killer
---
No, it;s not. If you dodge a lobby, the survivors in lobby just search for another games. If a survivor leaves a match during a match "bEcAuSe PLAGUE = DC" he/she ruins the whole match for the other players - both killer and survivors.
---
There are no pallets or windows in corn.
---
It's not survivors fault you're blind.
---
Just play NOED, Ruin nurse and make everyones day miserable :)
---
Imagine being so biased that you think you can clear all of the totems in a minute practically.
---
This is over now.
---
*T-Bags
---
i agree but franklins is actually a good perk
---
When I read this I was hoping the game was actually collapsing and being discontinued.. cause it's shit.
---
This is golden.
---
I play xbox and I have had the screen do that and it show icons for a killer dc on my name and the killers. If I dc for whatever reason it's on my name and I've also had no dc icons the match just ends for some reason.
---
OK FINE
---
Yeah the game is wack
---
^_^
---
If you see a butthead survivor near a pallet spirit walk behind them and wack em.

I had the same thing happen to me against a Michael

Okay, now I want Voice Chat in DbD.

Yussssss, same

Friday the 13th, in the right situation, was really hilarious and kinda neat with the proximity thing. It would be cool in DbD but what do I know.
---
i find none of these a problem killer is just not fun to play currently
---
Agree with you there.
---
Yes it was!!!
---
You should get a BP bonus for using a character‚Äôs specific perks. At least that will make everyone more unique and you‚Äôll see more than the meta used.

As unfortunate as it is, the hit sound effect is obviously going to be the good ol' SUBALUWA

---
i have over 1000 hours in the game survivors just have so much utility its frustrating for killers to even play i stoped playing killer for this reason its not a i dont have practice and idgaf if u teabag me and i see pallets as a core game mechanic for survivors
---
Meh...
---
Wherever I get added I always say, "This is gonna be good" and they just don't say anything.
---
Trapped and picked up = instant dc, downed by t3 myers = instant dc, windstorm bodyblock play = dc.
---
Ain't no rhyme or reason to it, survivors are just salty bitches taking advantage of no depipping off DCs.
---
"...Aren't worth going up against..." just says that you don't want the challenge. Which in some cases are fine I guess if you've had a bad day and just want a chill killer game. But that also means if you keep dodging "skilled" survivors, you'll never improve as a killer.
---
Op worded it awkwardly, but what they meant was that the endgame couldnt be triggered _with four survivors_ if the gens weren't all done.
---
No funny shit, I was sorta on the fence with this post because like, yeah, survivors can fucking suck. But so can killers, you know? It's the players themselves that can change the experience. You pretty much put a lot of trust into the community to not be assholes with an online only games
---
But the adept achievements is where I completely agree. What a horrendous change they've implemented. Can't even imagine the pain some killers will have now. Nurse? Wraith? Fucks sake, they really fucked up those Adepts.
---
It has nothing related to dbd..
---
OMG you guys literally ran the perk to block aura reading and you still lost lmfao
---
It's honestly rediculous that people are scared to face a challenge to the point that they will dodge just because Survivors are holding toolboxes...
---
Just because multiple Survivors are holding toolboxes doesn't mean you'll be Gen-rushed. You can get Gen-rushed with no toolboxes.
---
Yes, they updated it with the Plague DLC. Horrendous change that needs to be reverted.
---
But what if he didn't know? It is entirely possible, and to ban people for it is so shitty of BHVR it almost warrants refunds. At least only do a few days ban at max, but even then that is too far.
---
Recomend playing myers. He works well for new killers. His stealth will help alot and he is a great tester for perks.
---
Well i would say toolboxes makes it much much faster. If im like Billy or Hag i dont care i have the map pressure but with something like clown on big map your skill does not matter you just cant pressure enought unless survivors fuckup.
---
Groovy
---
*Laugh crying face*
---
i wouldn't mid them so much if people weren't  assholes i usually dont dodge them because i consider myself a decent killer and they make me even better at the game
---
Yes i agree i'm joking k
---
I love how there isnt even any emoting. Just both of you stop, stare, and he just walks away to stop being a nuisance hahaha
---
Survivor working with killer. Not like innocent farming at the end or anything, but actual helping killer locate then trap you
---
Yeah make it so it goes clockwise around. Firat perk in loadout on top, second on right, etc. Could make some funny builds with like faces and shit
---
That is still relevant thpugh, since nerfing a Killer to Freddy Tier isnt a rework.
---
this is why i think they should remove chat this community is so toxic they dont deserve chat
---
The only times I have ever dodged anyone is when they load in and it's a 4-man squad of P3 Claudette's. If you and your friends decide to all play as P3 Claudette's, you deserve the lobby dodge. Not because I'm afraid to face them, but because I think it's fucking stupid that they thought I wouldn't dodge.
---
It's not a bug, it's intention. M&amp;A doesn't affect Huntress' and Freddy's lullaby. Same goes for Insidious.
---
Both perks only affect the terror radius, not lullabies.
---
He gets overlooked often, but clown's design really is fantastic, and you capture it perfectly here.
---
that's weird. i mostly play solo and before Plague chapter was 90% killer 10% survivor. really, never seen much salt on red ranks(purple basically red right now). toxic in game - yes. but not in chat.
---
If your not using a good surround sound headset spirit can be harder then most, you really need to be able to hear the footsteps and the direction they're going while in her ghosty form.
---
I recommend low skilled killer for starting off like Wraith, Billy, Cannibal, or Trapper.
---
Get used to chasing an cutting off paths of travel an try not to get discouraged, you'll get there eventually!
---
What a lovely grin.
---
It's more fun when you get to talk creepy to eachother, plus you can communicate with randoms but at a risk.
---
Overwatch had an Avoid Player function, which was removed because one of the top Widowmaker players was having MAJOR trouble finding games and it turns out players were avoiding him because he was stomping on them.
---
Fuck clown‚Äôs been out a year?? Y‚Äôall remember the whole console controversy? Good times.
---
only BBQ won against those . LMFAO
---
Why do some survivor mains have to say BBQ needs a nerf anyways?? I understand saying NOED (not all the time tho) but BBQ would be stupid to nerf
---
I doubt this will stick for very long.
---
Woosh
---
It‚Äôs happened a couple of times now. First person was downed quite quickly and they DC‚Äôd. Then I met up with a Laurie who was trying to get me to follow them instead of going for the Claudette on the hook. I went for the hook but got there just as Leatherface came back. I was out in the open so got downed by his chainsaw.
---
The Laurie unhooked the Claudette who then unhooked me. Got into another chase and that‚Äôs when the Laurie popped up and was trying to block me throughout the chase.
---
I did okay avoiding the two of them for a bit but was caught in a position of not being able to get away. Was downed again and I got the mori. Claudette was downed and mori‚Äôd after me and then the Laurie and Leatherface proceeded to farm with one another.
---
Fucking hilarious I‚Äôm rolling on the floor
---
Bad survivors can't counter perks. You could tell them every way to counter a perk and they'll keep calling it OP
---
Unless it‚Äôs legion
---
I fail to see an issue anywhere.
---
Alright but like, for real though. Take my money
---
I prefer killer immensly. What specifically is triping you up in games?
---
Are you getting looped for ages?Are they blocking the hook? Teabagging does nothing. Sabo is pretty rare.
---
Sucks to suck, maybe you'll get good at some point. Probably not. But maybe.
---
Thank you! :)

You shouldn't have been banned.

It doesn't even matter if you purposely exploited it or not, it's fucking ridiculous that they wouldn't just disable them

## Three Shoe Beating
---
After successfully hitting a survivor with your main weapon attack (reducing them from Healthy to Injured) gain a 10 % speed boost for **15/20/25** seconds. If you don't hit the same survivor again during this time you become 10 % slower for **8/6/4** seconds. This effect begins immediately if another survivor is hit during the speed boost and the speed boost is lost.
---
*"Prepare yourself for an unmerciless beating by Rolf's shoe!"*
---
## Life Has Many Doors
---
Receive notification when a survivor starts to open an Exit Gate. When an Exit Gate is being opened by a survivor or the Exit Gate is open and you are within **18/24/30** meters, your terror radius is reduced to **0 m**.
---
*"Many doors, yes? Too much for couch potato Ed-boys like yourselves?"*
---
## That's My Horse!
---
The last **1/1/2** windows you vaulted are cursed by the Entity for 10 seconds. The next survivor to vault them is forced into a Slow Vault and is additionally slowed for **0.5/1/1.5** seconds after vaulting. *Lithe* cannot activate from windows affected by *That's My Horse!*.
---
*"Play me the song of Rolf's village!"*

No you‚Äôre thinking about it wrong. Its as simple as pie in mathematics. To be exact 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286 208998628034825342117067982148086513282306647093844609550582231725359408128481 117450284102701938521105559644622948954930381964428810975665933446128475648233 786783165271201909145648566923460348610454326648213393607260249141273724587006 606315588174881520920962829254091715364367892590360011330530548820466521384146 951941511609433057270365759591953092186117381932611793105118548074462379962749 56735188575272

They can rig maps not to appear and have previously disabled offerings, they could do it but wont.
---
Thank you so much, that means a lot! Although sometimes I wish for a first person atmosphere and really dark maps for the survivors.. that would be awesome haha
---
Wish more killers would just chill at the very least when it's a 2v1. But 95% they just want their extra 5k for two hooks.
---
I will give you some reasons
---
1) you can‚Äôt hook anyone because they will bodyblock you with 2-3 people.
---
2) most if not all swf groups are toxic as fuck
---
3) if they all have toolboxes the match is over in less than 3 minutes
---
4) if they all have flashlights you will be blinded 24/7 and they will spam their flashlight to annoy you
---
Done
---
It makes me happy that you do! Thank you &lt;3
---
People that unironically use UWU need to be euthanized
---
Even big DBD streamers do it. I feel it's a non-issue. You can easily reconnect and join a new survivor lobby.
---
Reminds me of those batfleck sad memes
---
3  blink nurse is actually EXTREMELY broken. Obviously not as broken as omegablink, but still very very powerful and easy as a killer.
---
Yeah they did a really really good job on his design I think! Same for Adiris, I‚Äôm not a fan of her mechanics, but her design is outstandingly good. Thank you!
---
Thank you so much :)
---
If you hate bbq so much just hide in a locker when the killer is about to hook someone lol or just hide behind a gen
---
A killer got a 4k using only bbq and op is trying (or maybe just being sarcastic) to say that bbq should get nerfed
---
Yeah I once did a spirit artwork! It doesn‚Äôt have that much of a dark atmosphere though, maybe I should do another one someday. I think you‚Äôll be able to find the picture in my reddit post history :) not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to post links
---
Hex: Epilepsy
---
Thank you!
---
Isn't like below 250 yellow
---
I can show the world...
---
Thats it.
---
Just play Claudette
---
That's because the first .exe you mentioned is the actual game binary, the second on you listed and referred to as normal actually just starts EAC (which is required otherwise game will not load) and after EAC loads up then it automatically starts the game by running the first one you listed.
---
Set it to override application and then set to off the same as you can do with AF.
---
So do survivors and they'll DC to get a better one.
---
I hate playing with the wraith and against the wraith
---
P U R E  E N E R G Y 
---
I had this glitch the other night with a window, everytime someone ran over there I noped out
---
Ah okay thank you, should I deploy a sarcastic comment?
---
No survivors are necessary better because all of them can unlock others perks, but if you really want to get technical Ace has the quietest screams. Teachable are when you get a killer to a high enough level (30, 35, 40) you can get their exclusive perks for all survivors or killers. Some of the meta perks for survivors are Self Care which is unlocked from Claudette, Sprint Burst from Meg, Dead Hard from David King, borrowed time from Bill (I think) unless you aren‚Äôt on PC and I‚Äôm pretty sure Mettle of Man from Ashley is good. It good to learn how to loop killers around pallets, so you can probably find a tutorial on YouTube. What helped me a lot was watching people play and learning from what they do. Most specifics will be learned though watching others. The last piece of advice I can think of is to be open to new ideas and find a play style that works for you.
---
Who tf uses Ruin on Billy? Ew
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that BBQ is no better than any of those
---
23rd
---
I think we‚Äôve done a pretty good job so far
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
Instantly try to beat nea to the boxes
---
Well, at least this is something really fresh about gameplay! Like, the last time we got something new was 2 years ago when the Hag was released (I'm talking about totems and hex perks).
---
I'm glad you feel that way but I know for a fact that on PS4, it takes almost an hour to just get into a lobby when playing SWF. It's rediculous in the first place that I need to wait that long, but what's worse is waiting that long just to get Lobby Dodged and start all over again.
---
You cannot easily reconnect and join a new Survivor lobby.
---
You're complaining because SWF literally exists. The truth is that the only Killers that complain about SWF are the same Killers who can't get above Green Rank.
---
‚ÄúWear default skins‚Äù....and killers complain about disconnects when they bring OP addons? Talk about hypocritical bullshit...
---
Nea vs Dwight
---
Play doctor with 3 gen strategy and make them cry
---
Who was that guy?
---
Not a Jewish person.
---
That's not helpful. Play her and crouch literally anywhere c
---
Indeed. Thank you for the guidance and emotional support.
---
If im having a bad night I will lobby dodge obvious swf. If it's a 4 man claudette, with flashlights, and theyre wearing the same outfit you know it's going to be toxic. Plus you know it's going to be macmillans. It's just not fun at all.
---
I will face camp you any day no need to invite me.
---
End game collapse more like the collapse of my ryzen 3 graphics...
---
Well nobody stops you grom disconnecting vs bullshit like omega blink nurse or instasaw.
---
In my opinion, being good at the game is just as much about tips and tricks you learn as it is reflexes and stuff, so, beginner‚Äôs stuff:
---
1. continuing to watch how-to‚Äôs is a good idea (I really like The King and TydeTime, they‚Äôre experienced, they really know their stuff, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like that stupid ‚Äújust get gud lel‚Äù bs you find in a lot of channels.
---
2. Use perks to help balance out your weaknesses (for example, I have a hard time losing survivors, so I run stuff like Bloodhound+Sloppy Butcher to track their blood trails), 
---
3. If you play killer, scratch marks can only help you so much, so learn to follow stuff like injured noises and blood.
---
***4. When playing survivor, resist the urge to run everywhere when not in chase, it‚Äôs so easy to see scratch marks from a good distance away and zoom in on a survivor that I wouldn‚Äôt have found otherwise
---
***5. When you hear the killer heartbeat getting real close and you‚Äôre working on a generator, don‚Äôt keep working on it. Number one easiest way to down survivors. When you find a generator, look for something to hide behind and, if you can, a pallet you can use if you get spotted. 
---
6. If you get steamrolled, try to think about what you messed up rather than just getting salty. Getting steamrolled can be good for you.
---
7. Facecamping only hurts killers in the end!!! Survivors take 2 minutes to die and, between that and time for chase and carrying a survivor to the hook, they can likely finish a whole-ass generator.
---
***8. Don‚Äôt insta-yoink when someone gets hooked. They have a whole minute until they get to the struggle phase as well as other time being chased, downed, and carried for you to work on generators. I personally love insta-yoinks as a killer because it makes it so easy to re-down the booked survivor and pop them back on and CONSEQUENTIALLY moving them to another phase.
---
Build, pig, gears and tampered, Thantiphonia, blood warden, dying light, and anything. I call it the ssssslllllllooooooowwwwwwww build
---
Fog used to look sick as shit!
---
Don‚Äôt keep sprinting and sprinting when you‚Äôve lost sight of them, they‚Äôll find your ass again pronto. Look up how to do window jukes, practice timing on pallet stuns.

"how dare you dis respect the son of a Sheppard Ed boys"
---
This is the type of game where you can't just be good at it quickly. That's actually what I love about it is that the only way to get good at this game is to play it a whole lot and understand every killer, survivor, perks, etc.
---
killers who dc because a survivor is looping them don‚Äôt deserve to rank up past rank 20 anyway
---
But we get nerds all the time because its unfun or unfair. How can they say it's legit. Its not legitimate with 5 gens in the first two seconds of a match. I think they should just increase your luck per second the killer is camping you compounded with the amount of gens left. So like 1% per second √ó 5 gens the less gens the less chance.
---
Any perks?
---
ALL killers who dodge swf are shit lmao
---
No matter how badly people will curse your ass and say otherwise, NOED is a crutch. Everyone knows it, people who deny it are clowns, it rewards you for failing, small game is a meme and useless when playing solo, not even a totem counter, no way to know if the killer has it, etc. 
---
It‚Äôs a shitty OP perk shitty killers use to feel less shitty. No one can deny this.
---
I already said that the only times I have ever dodged is when It's a squad-ette.
---
I have been falling, for thirty minutes!
---
Lol
---
It is. Half the matches I play everyone hides for bbq and for a while I thought that meant they weren't 40m away but it's just cause they are clever. OP and his team = not preparing for bbq
---
The in-game tools look like they do nothing as there is no text field on console, but you have to use them anyway. When I reported killer and survivor playing together on PS4 I uploaded a video of the game somewhere and created a ticket on the support site (support.deadbydaylight.com) with a link to it after the in-game report.
---
Dance with me makes scratch marks not appear for 3 seconds after you vault, lightfoot (or whatever it‚Äôs called) makes your scratch marks disappear early, sprint burst gives you a speed boost for 3 seconds every minute, dead hard does the same and makes you invincible during it
---
Blood warden tear 5, the window and pallet on killer shack is blocked
---
Not trying to abuse anything. Just frustrated at loading into a 2/3 player game where at least 1 other person d/c.
---
I usually see people hiding behind gens. You can see a sliver of brighter red most of the time.
---
Erm it does do exactly that. Rage quitting loses you 2 pips.
---
I am rank 7 atm... and I am a survivor and killer main so don't tell me you don't tell me I don't know how it is from both sides or some bullshit like that.
---
I play on PC so you don't know how toxic SWF groups are in the chat. I have had 2 SWF groups who weren't toxic and I really enjoyed that match.
---
I don't hate SWF groups because they exists I hate them because they are toxic as fuck.
---
This is actually terrifying
---
Get the fuck out of my room I‚Äôm playing Minecraft
---
the lawsuit will hopefully settle this month
---
A lot of killers here take issue with it is all. If you are fine with disconnects, my apologies for assuming. There are some that will go on a campaign against disconnects, but then support lobby dodging. Like yeah I‚Äôm going to cherry pick these lobbies for easy looking games and make people wait, but I‚Äôm also going to bring something Op and then complain when people dont want to play. Very hypocritical!
---
You act like PS4 players don't get the toxic messages either. The difference between you and me is that you get so butthurt you will dodge SWF to avoid Survivors hurting you feelings in the post game chat.
---
Harder but rewarding for sure

Well if you get downed the first 2 seconds of the game it is your fault for being bad at the game, and most killers camp when the survivor is toxic (T-bagging at a pallet or spamming your flashlight)

---
You can not out run the killers. Their base speed is faster than survivors.
---
I love the Spine Chill perk.
---
My play style is more stealthy and avoiding the killer if I can. Spine Chill helps by letting me know a killer is nearby and I may be in their line of sight, giving me time to hide out or start running.
---
When you're injured, you bleed until healed, and killers can easily track you by following the blood. The blood stains disappear after a few seconds, so you'll want to get out of a killers way well before they get a visual on you if you can.
---
Looping and juking is just gonna take practice. I've been playing for about a month and I'm only "decent" at looping, and juking is out the question for me.
---
My favorite thing to do, if the map will allow it, is to "line of sight" the killer. If I have a head start, I'll run into grass or a corn field (anywhere there are obstructions really), then start walking or crouching so I don't leave scratch marks, and change my direction from my initial one to get away. Doesn't always work, but when it does it's clutch.
---
Use lockers sparingly. I can't say when or when not to cause some killers check lockers; some don't, and others will start if they come to an area and the survivors have disappeared too fast. You'll have to decide that and hope for the best.
---
I'll end here. This has gone on long enough üòÖ
---
Losing pips is fair. DCs are the worst and should be punished more IMHO. Although,in game hostage situations it's the only thing that you can do.
---
Thank you so much
---
I dont do toxic things and I'm newer to the game. I can sometimes loop certain killers good other times I may not. I can usually hide at the start anyways but if I can't its bullshit that I dont get a chance to even do anything because a killer is crap at the game. Camping at the start is in no way a good strategy. It's a dick move especially if I'm not even being toxic. Double dick points if they beat you the hole time.
---
NOED is a crutch and makes you play worse, don‚Äôt encourage people to use something that will lower their skill cap. People call survivors entitled but I‚Äôm convinced killers would defend NOED being a default part of all killers kits.
---
Yup, the engine update with Legion has been causing insane crashes and DCs.
---
I could not disagree more. The game may get frustrating at times but just learn to detach yourself from any kind of emotion and learn from and evaluate your mistakes. Improvise and adapt. The game is always changing and you need to adapt to beat your survivor enemies. If one survivor is looping you, you disengage and try and catch someone else off guard.  Sabotaging your hooks? Start sluggin'. Cant find people? Run bbq, whispers, etc. Everything has a counter. 
---
I love how challenging and how each individual game evolves depending on who is playing and on what map. I love decimating swf teams that are too altruistic. I love losing to swf teams with excellent coordination. I love getting messages from people acusing me of cheating because i did incredibly well one game just as much as i love a wholesome conversation with a former enemy about their amazing plays. I love this community. 
---
I know its not for everyone but i can barely play survivor. It's too boring. Go here and there and do some gens and play a timing game. Or i can hunt and murder some survivors while trying to beat a clock.
---
If I remember right, you hold RT to start the heal and then press LB to use the insta-heal.
---
But what of the 3 shoe beating?
---
A post not about pig?! Have you betrayed the oink organization?!
---
Chuckles in enduring
---
I like but then some will want Snap Out to be under healing. I would rather it be after two (or more) feral Hits the survivor gets say Sloppy or another perk effect like Franklin's.
---
*laughs in hacks*
---
Oink!
---
Those perks are crazy sometimes from a killer POV. Mettle of man really added insult to injury
---
And that‚Äôs not supposed to happen, no really hard to understand. It‚Äôs anti tunnel/camp perk now, you aren‚Äôt supposed to just be able to rehook someone with it lol.
---
If the survivor who unhooked you has We'll Make It, you'll see the perk's icon on your screen.
---
I'm a survivor main who started playing Wraith recently. My advice:
---
Can you see scratch marks or blood well? Hearing is also a good way to track them. I found a teammate I had briefly lost in the corn field as a survivor by listening for the grunts while he was injured. There are also perks to help keep track of survivors.
---
When I play as a survivor, I get that map a lot, and no one ever uses a map offering for it. When I play killer I cycle through damn near every map. I hate Haddon Field and that other street map.
---
Can you imagine old ds with mom it would be a nightmare
---
You earn points while you play, survive or hook it is a game, let games be for fun and not sport and you will have much more fun.
---
If you get hooked don't rush the meter, wait it out even if camped because the only way to punish a camping killer is forcing them to wait it out. Claudette is a good starter character with self heal.
---
I wasn't aware of this info. Thanks for sharing.
---
As a killer I faced a few Jeffs, I say he isnt super loud.
---
I don't really agree with the idea of banning for this, even if it is super annoying to go against, but to be fair there was a warning in the game.
---
Go to settings, tab to your bindings, it'll be listed.
---
I have every button reassigned so my setup will be different then yours but it's on their, an if you do t like it you can change get whichever button you want it to be.
---
Does the bot killer typically ready unready ready unready on the lobby? Back in the day when botting was common on PC you'd often be able to tell the killer is going to be a bot if he's doing that. (Autoclicker or whatever is pressing ready, leave game, create new game, etc.)
---
TY! Do you see a lot of his head peeking over stuff?
---
Lmao I noticed they always make haunted grounds a little too easy to find
---
RIP SWF squad. Ya‚Äôll will be remembered...
---
If you get jakes perk that muffle or even silences your cries when injured(I‚Äôm blanking on the name right now lol) and maybe urban evasion from Nea, you can definitely be stealthy.
---

When you loop a helpless Freddy using window vaults: 
---
**‚ÄùLife has many windows, Fred boy.‚Äù**
---
Spine Chill does NOT alert you to T1 Myers presence.
---
There is no way Bunny Feng is going to have a Shard option after all the desire that has been displayed for it. If it ever does release I have no doubt it'll be AC only.
---
Some important points
---
1) Killers are faster - There are some perks that give you a window of opportunity to lose them, but killers speed &gt; yours. Don't run in a straight line unless you're going from one juking place to another
---
2) Be aware of your surroundings - You're on a gen, but what if the killer came to your generator? What would you do? Where would you go? Left? Right? Why right? Is there a pallet? Keep asking yourself this
---
3) Understand that some killers can be figured out as soon as the match starts - Do you see any fountains? Plague. Any Saw machines? Pig. Once you know that, refer to number 2 and adjust it based on the killer
---
4) Remember, your job as a survivor is to survive as long as you can - There are games where one survivor juked the killer for so long that we finish 3 generators. If that survivor goes down, we can easily wrap up 2 and rescue her. Think of yourself as that, surviving to give your teammates the best opportunity. And, if someone else is providing that time, make sure to make every second count. 
---
Enjoy DBD, my man

YOU DARE MOCK THE SON OF THE SHEPERD?!
---
They alsostated that the video was all done by prompts and not actual play, which is why it started with 4 gens left at one point.
---
&gt;And if you close the hatch, the gates power but dont open. And the egc starts.
---
The only way for the hatch to open, is with a key or one survivor remaining in the trial, which doesn't apply to all the scenarios created by OP. He was talking about using End Game Scenario while multiple survivors were still alive.
---
Whatever I'm not wasting my time arguing with idiots.

I like "The Butcher"

I actually got all perks on trapper(I was trying to do that for all killers at one point), and I got a fuck ton of good trapper add ons like 37 stitched bags, 30 honing stones, 27 fastening tools and like 58 setting tools. I definitely recommend that you dump all your bloodpoints for trapper for a little while. It feels soo good to be able to use his good add ons without having to worry about the amount that you lost
---
What an asshole
---
Where was he?!
---
This is unbelievable.
---
Ace in my opinion, I haven‚Äôt levelled him up at all, I don‚Äôt want his perks infecting my blood webs. 
---
On the contrary if his perks are amazing do tell.
---
The most well known of course is never get into a loop with nurse. But only slightly less known than that, is never wait next to a pallet, with a vision blocking corner right next to it!
---
Who says they want to pip? And yes borrowed time can switch places but most killers will go after you and not the other one.
---
&gt;I don't support banning people for a mistake the devs have created.
---
&gt;Who the fuck heals v legion anyway?
---
Do you even understand what those add-ons do? They increase **MENDING** time, not healing. If you don't mend, you go down once the Deep Wound bar is depleted.
---
Somewhat.
---
2 DC‚Äôs and dying light, you deserved that escape honestly.
---
I am not going to waste my time arguing about how good Blood Warden will be with the new update. Idc about how the EGC works.
---
Huntress, though clown is a dabbler, and I suspect hillbilly might be one also
---
I like everything from the new engine update, apart from this, you where never able to no-clip into faces before the update.
---
Ace and it isn't even close.  Two of his perks are purely for farming items while the other is just laughably bad in terms of having any effect on the game.
---
am nurse.. what's a pallet?
---
Probably 1-2 weeks after the ptb like always.
---
Wow good play
---
I'm really liking this endgame update, guys.
---
What perks you use on your Freddy?
---
Yeah they should do. I can't remember the new ash perk were when you recover and it goes to your progression bar. Is it buckle up?. But I have been trying round with that tenacity and boil over. You will be surprised how often you wiggle free.
---
Teabagging is just annoying, it‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt realize the killer is another person trying to have fun just like them. I honestly let my teammates die if they teabag at every pallet.
---
Yeah fair enough I get that tbh.
---
I use them mainly for "meme builds"
---
Yeah I'm worried about vision clarity too :c
---
I can't think of a better response üëç
---
You can still open the hatch with a key if it's been closed by the killer.
---
So to get adept the goal is to depip into low (or high, around 18, whatever) ranks?
---
It's rare to max out any category in points for survivor, especially since the other survivors are "competing" for everything apart from survival with each-other. You're not actually competing and want the others to do stuff but you just get less points. An average game for me still usually nets about 14k bloodpoints. If you want to max everyone just play killer for a while tbh
---
Prey as in playtoys not prey as in food. Prey sometimes refer to those who fell victim to a murderer or smtn.
---
Stridor is really nice on her since in Haunting sound is a big help in locating, also in case you don‚Äôt know, I believe the massive whoosh sound doesn‚Äôt happen inside her terror radius, so distressing sometimes trips people up who expect to hear the wind.
---
How is it too long? 
---
It gives some time to try and go for a save if someone is hooked &amp; find NOED if the killer has it, doesn't completely screw the survivors over if the killer is running blood warden, and that one guy needs some time to try and open the gates with the killer patrolling them.
---
I do play killer a lot but I think over the last 3 days 30k points with streamers has been the most I have. I'm not worried about maxing everyone, just nabbing certain teachable. I don't make any points though. You're saying I should do as many gens as I can and heal others when I can but otherwise keep my head down?
---
I thought it was healing, I have not had a legion pull it on me.
---
Do you not think a lifetime ban is pretty over the top? Every time a fucker DCs he effectively ruins the game and fuck all happens to them.
---
The pre school?
---
Same. I used to play killer exclusively but omg is survivor so much more chill. As killer your constantly sweaty trying to manage four survivors. There‚Äôs no downtime. Meanwhile as a survivor the second you know the killers occupied you don‚Äôt really need to worry.
---
BBQ is definitely a good perk for faster killers but I wouldn't recommend it on Wraith. It's good for bloodpoints though so no harm in running it. Ruin and Sloppy are both incredible perks. 
---
Bamboozle on Wraith is a really fun thing since he does stuff faster invisible and it's a good perk for ending some loops early, but does encourage not learning to combat certain loops. 
---
Overall it's definitely a solid setup and will be more than enough to rank you up. Killer can rank up without perks somewhat easily. If you're looking for stuff to replace, I would recommend Nurses Calling instead of BBQ or Bamboozle as it's pretty decent on Wraith since you can sneak up on people.
---
The cornfield just sucks. I never get away by running into the corn, but when I'm looking for a survivor, they seem to go to Narnia.
---
Haha, I ran into someone who said something similar after I said "nice addons" except their excuse was they were using addons before prestigining. I then proceeded to ask, you know those are bugged and cause an extremely long mending time? He replies, "yes" and makes me wonder why he bothered with the excuse in the first place..
---
I dunno, it just seemed like the obvious implication to me, but I guess it's just my head-cannon then.
---
Anyway, two cannibals is still plenty for the point about Bubba.
---
Okay so survivor tips I can think of. Don't go for great skillchecks until you can hit good ones every time. Only go for a save if the killer is chasing someone else, unless you know you can get away and not screw the unhooked survivor. Stealth, while slowly dying, is the best way I have discovered that will keep you alive. Hear the heartbeat? Go hide. Don't run unless chased. A good loadout I have used is, spinechill, self care, light weight, and quick and quiet. It's a stealth build but I can't tell you how many times the killer has lost me. If you're going for unhooks, try mettle of man, borrowed time, we're gonna live forever, and self care or bond. Self care is almost a crutch perk, but you can survive without it. Avoid decisive strike until you master skill checks. I also like alert and technician. Dark sense is good too but doesn't work on Freddy, and Myers tier one. I'm not sure about the wraith though. If you are getting chased a lot try sprint burst and light weight. You run away and then hide it you think they lost you. As for killer well you want to focus on delaying gens as long as you can. Depends on the killer you're trying to play. I'm pretty good at Myers and I'm learning the clown now, but it depends on the survivors you face.
---
Survivors might 99% an exit gate to avoid the collapse, the killer can go mess with it then.
---
Can confirm
---
And that counterargument isn't valid because dodging doesn't waste offerings/addons/nearly as much of everyone's timing.
---
hating on claudettes is dumb but at least playing claudette is a choice
---
have you ever seen a brick? I've never seen anyone look at a brick without saying "fuck me"
---
My personal guess is that the collapse countdown will count being rbt'd as a 'downed state' and slow the timer.
---
PTB goes live on the 23rd, main patch likely on the 7th
---
There should be üò™
---
I hate buses in games
---
Yes but this is a game.
---
Probably change to 'As the last survivor, manage to open the Exit gate and escape out of it before the trial collapses.'
---
That‚Äôs the design on one of Jeff‚Äôs shirts so yes it does.
---
You dont lose items dont lie never ever happend to me
---
About the offerings, the killer loses them and addons too
---
Why does it appear on screen as ‚Äúitems lost‚Äù then?
---
&gt; as killer makes to you absolutely 0 difference if they DC
---
Disagree. I can't count the amount of times I've had people DC on first down no matter the killer. That's a precious BBQ stack gone forever. More importantly it makes for a far less interesting game, I don't want a free win handed to me on a platter like that just because one person felt like ragequitting.
---
If it happens, its because you were so focused on the bm you forgot the timer.
---
Jane??? Weak. We all know Kate is the best girl
---
I only watch Bricky and Let's Play so idk
---
No problem, the Endgame was barely announced a day or so ago. I agree that it would actually be more of a challenge if it was after the gens are powered but that‚Äôs likely too big of a change for now, likely bring uproar. 
---
As it is it‚Äôs a mechanic to prevent hatch stand-offs and holding the game hostage which has been long due imo, we should wait and see what happens but I think BHVR did well this time
---
Looking forward to the Freddy changes since it‚Äôs linked with this Endgame, and hoping Pig isn‚Äôt dealt with too harshly as they‚Äôre looking at her late game potential
---
True
---
You missed glancing Ruin on the corner while the spawn animation plays
---
Seriously ?
---
I always let them escape after i got 4stacks.. so i cant relate
---
It's bugged, you don't lose anything.
---
These fucking comments are killing my childhood, but in a good way.
---
This is like, one of the most wrong comments I've ever read.
---
Dead Hard used by a not-dogshit survivor lets you squeeze out another rep of a loop or get to a pallet you would have otherwise been dead before reaching. Obviously if you're in a deadzone with the killer right on your ass, it's not gonna do anything. That's why you use foresight and run to a loop where dead hard will actually do something for you. 
---
Nurse, incidentally, is one of the only killers who consistently kinda doesn't give a shit about dead hard. If a nurse uses her first blink to get in lunge range, you have to guess whether she's gonna blink again or swing; 3+ blink nurse, your dead hard ain't shit. It's a coin flip at best, there's no guaranteed use case unlike most other killers.
---
THIS GLITCH IS SO FRUSTRATING
---
I‚Äôd be satisfied with just being able to see the killers name on console at the start of a match. Thanks to privacy settings it‚Äôs often impossible to determine who the killer is until the end of the match. I‚Äôve been trying to keep a list of killers that are prone to heavy camping but it‚Äôs often impossible to be sure it‚Äôs the same killer until it‚Äôs too late.
---
It's fair, yes, but it isn't enough to punish those who DC, because people don't care about rank.  
---
The devs need to implement harsher punishments against DC'ers. Queue cooldowns, low priority queues, as well as a more serious ban policy on the matter.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work on console.
---
Nah the upvotes are upvotes, i specifically said comments, dont be so easily offended lol its a shitty meme with crooked writing its not an oil painting.
---
Just play billy or nurse if you don‚Äôt already I bet things will get easier they‚Äôre the only viable killers to get consistent kills in high rank matches
---
Tapp's perks aren't useless. I use stake out a lot because it gives you the ability to hit good skill checks and have them class as greats, so against ruin if I stack up 4 tokens I can then rinse through a gen. Tenacity is ok if you have an anti-slugging build as you can move away fast and recover. Detectives hunch shows you everything if you do a gen which is meh usually but on those times everyone is struggling to find a hex totem it can be useful, also linked up with a map that has add-ons to reveal stuff to your team makes it very good.   
---
For me its Adam. Autodidact is meh. Diversion is ok but I don't think it charges quick enough so you usually get 1 pebble for the whole game. Deliverance is the best and can be great in clutch opportunities but so many times people will use it because they have it even if I am running up for a save and it makes more sense to let me get them off and heal them, similar to borrowed time it can make people do bad plays.
---
This needs to be a thing. I try to talk about this movie to anyone who is willing to listen. So good.
---
Literally this
---
Understand that it's a pretty strict timing. 3 seconds to pick a survivor up, 1.33 seconds to blind a killer. Too early and you won't get the save, too late and they can look away before the blind finishes. This is compounded by the fact that it's basically a coin flip whether you're going to be on the right side, whether it'll be possible at all since killers can pick you up while staring at a wall, and killers can also just stand over a slug for a second to bait out a hero with a flashlight and then run them down.
---
tl;dr flashlights aren't very good, even good survivors beef saves all the time.
---
Honestly breathtaking &lt;3. Hope you had fun making it.
---
The goal with camping is to complete an objective while the goal with taunting the killer is pure making the opposing player feel upset.
---
For me both do not bother me but this is just how I see it.
---
It would work better if they didn't have see-through/chest high walls everywhere all the time, forever.
---
It makes sense but at the same time I don't think it works as people who DC aren't that bothered and might be trying to de-rank. 
---
I am not a fan of the harsher punishments usually mentioned like waiting 15 minutes before you can queue for a game again. Only because I am not sure DBD has the player base consistently throughout different times that this wouldn't then also extend the wait time for other people. Also if it was longer than 15 minutes I don't think DBD has the same pulling power as games without bugs and issues to make people want to come back. I think the queue time out is such an obvious easy option as many games do it and it works that it makes me question why BHVR haven't hence I think their aren't enough people playing to make this a viable option. I don't want 20-30 min queue times even if it means it cuts back on DCs. 
---
I personally think have a lower threshold, like if you DC 10-15% of your games, then the next time you play your aura is visible to the killer the whole game. The only way to stop this is to complete a full game and then it will be normal unless you keep dcing then it will keep happening. I would prefer an in-game work around that at least means people who aren't serial DCers won't be affected so bad.
---
Yea they‚Äôre very weak now I‚Äôm surprised killers still run Franklin‚Äôs and lightborn for it lol
---
My baby Chae &lt;3
---
You honestly expect the Entity to be that merciful?
---
Nurse (it could flash back and forth in time between Nurse's tragic story and Nea vandalizing the same, now decrepit building).
---
Maaaaaaaaybe Wraith if his was an origin story.
---
Legion's could be unique if they focused on the kids instead of Jeff, who could instead have a passive passive arc where we can see his story progress, but only through getting momentary glances at him in backgrounds shots and whatnot, maybe the kids find his stuff lying around the ski resort as he was already taken, only for them to be taken soon after.
---
I am not sold that the devs really changed it so you can't tell when SWF joins your game. It is supposed to be all 4 survivors join at the same time but they still join the same way they did before so I can understand some killers seeing 3 people appear at once and assuming they are SWF.   
---
Problem with going against an SWF group is it is way more stressful and you run a much higher risk of dealing with really toxic players who will make the next 10-20 minutes of your life annoying and crappy. When I want to just chill and play a few rounds of DBD I am not going to want that lol. I personally feel I need to be in the right mood and head space to take on say more than 1 flashlight or multiple tool boxes. I do get your frustrations though as my friend stopped playing DBD as SWF times on PS4 are horrendous but I have empathy for killers because they don't know the SWF won't be bagging him at every pallet and making his life a nightmare the whole game.   
---
Out of interest OP do you play killer a lot or are you more a survivor main?
---
Probably because he was in a family of cannibals. Not the best choice imo. 
---
I wouldve called him The precious or The misunderstood.
---
Poor dear.
---
IWe ran around for a few minutes. I tried to message him but he had his settings off to not receive messages (not surprising considering how toxic players in this game can be) and guided him to the generators, he thought I was chasing him but just followed. After he powered up one he ran the other direction while I was just hitting the generator with my stick. I didn‚Äôt hit him. Upon running the other way he ran into the trap I set at the beginning of the match. Thats when I noticed there were only two. When he powered it up, I heard the hatch behind us but, again he ran in the opposite direction. I picked him up after he got snapped and dropped him near the hatch. Not much but eh, this game needs more love than hate. Like rainbows way of going about toxicity. 
---
Ps, im on pc but using a PS4 controller.
---
Nah.
---
Still no strap-on slap-able clown belly :(
---
Taunting a killer makes him chase you while your team can gen rush. So it's not all sentimental,it has a bit of "strategy" attached it but just like the other guy said,it's still a dick move.
---
It‚Äôs obvious that the emperor used his firecrackers very well.
---
I left the same about a month ago. I just cant handle the direction the game is going and I dont enjoy it anymore. Agreed, it was great while it lasted.
---
Really nice!
---
I am actually a Dwight
---
Happy cake day
---
Weak doesn't mean that anyone enjoys having to see that ugly ass screen effect.  It's better than the old migraine factory, but it's still godawful.  Literally my only complaint about flashlights and why I've kept my hate for them even after insta went away. All we needed was a Grey out and it would've been great.
---
I totally understand what they mean, but my point is basement saves have always been risky, no matter who the killer is, honestly. EGC is only putting a time crunch on everyone else instead of just the guy on the hook. 
---
If the killer is going to camp the basement, that‚Äôs one kill they‚Äôre going to secure in exchange for losing their Chaser emblem for being too close, missing out on the other three kills just kinda faffing about on the map and pretty much admitting defeat. This is nothing new, now only the other three people can‚Äôt lollygag for ever afterwards.
---
You play league so you understand that punishment isn't as affective as people think it is
---
*Survivor T-Bags* 
---
Rolf: You dare mock the son of a shepard?
---
This is really old news... read the patch notes...
---
All this really does is stop Hatch-Offs. The timer doesn‚Äôt start until a gate is opened, so three minutes to get to a gate seems reasonable.
---
My favorite part was when it said ‚Äúescaped‚Äù and gave you the Bloodpoints moments before you get ripped through space and time.
---
The timer only starts when the gate is open and slows down if someone is hooked. If anything you have more time to make a play and attempt to dip afterward.
---
I've experienced this before. It's complete ear rape of the static noise being spammed constantly.
---
Dead hard, self care, deliverance and iron will, not sure if it fits your playstyle but it got me out of a lot of bad situations
---
Also ace main=big brain and [B]elete legion]
---
Jokes apart every survivor is equal with the exeption of the perks you start with so choose the one you like the most, diferrent from the killer, each with a different playstile, hillbilly tends to be universal, just run, smack twice or chainsaw and you're good
---
The assassins was actually the plague, and the emperor got away because she refused to attack and only vomited.
---
you could report them if you want. there was an announcement about two killer games not being  allowed.
---
And then some.
---
When a survivor pallet camps against a huntress
---
When does it go live? 0.o
---
It only works once though
---
Yeah just yesterday I missed one against a camping leatherface, yikes I almost let out a scream. Mettle of man perk could a safer alternative.
---
OMG I was playing with a SWF group once (me and two others) and we were going for the 4ppl escape through hatch trophy. I brought a Skeleton Key and we had a LF. Everytime he hit me I'd circle around him and pick it back up and run. I cracked my friends up xD. They thought I was being ridiculous and thought it was funny I wouldn't let it go.
---
Happened to me too and I‚Äôm guessing that it‚Äôs because the animation for the hook has already begun when the DS skill check was hit.
---
Don't you have to be hit multiple times then healed and doesn't it show your location to the killer?
---
Damn.. That is so freaking cute it's killing me to se her so sad.. :'(
---
In my games it almost never gets activated as all the totems have been cleansed during the game. And if it does, I usually get one hit and as I'm carrying the survivor the totem gets cleansed.
---
Plus he says that like people actually use small game, I fucking wished they did but I digress
---
Sometimes they just want to get the match over with and move on.  It takes killers a lot of time to make sure only 2 Survivors get a decent amount of points while also ensuring the killer doesn't get much at all.  Don't hold it against them if they just want to close out a blown match and try for an actual 4v1 again.
---
In my game hank shot himself, connor is still a machine, luther died, kara and alice got shot trying to go in Canada and theres a civil war between androids and humans. I guess i really fucked up
---
Pro tip, the killer is facing where the survivor‚Äôs legs are facing
---
Probably was a Hag or Huntress.
---
Why even mention it doesnt have skillchecks?
---
You're kind of contradicting yourself here. You say there's more for killers to do than just kill, so camping is bad because they should be doing other things.
---
&gt; and stop survivors from helping one another
---
This is effectively what camping does, so I'm not sure why you have a problem with it.
---
And then you say gen rushing is okay, and also that there's more for survivors to do than just gen rush, even though when they gen rush they're not doing anything else.
---
Camping and gen rushing are two sides of the same coin.
---
No?
---
I use his perks for hoarding tbh. The game got stale for a bit so I wanted to start getting as many items as possible, it gave me a new reason to try to survive trials. It's honestly pretty fun to see how many purple and sometimes pink items you get through rng.
---
Why wouldn't it be
---
Yeah im happy to meet such nice people in one of my first killer games. \^\^
---
What's funny is I just got out of a match vs a doctor with overcharge yet I hit all of them lol
---
i have nothing to complain about the perk's/addons its the fucking killers tunneling and camping that are annoying
---
I know I said that. (:
---
this almost never works on me, most killers do this way to obvious lol
---
Gen rushing isn‚Äôt a thing though? It‚Äôs you failing to monitor the generators. I rarely get ‚Äúgen rushed‚Äù and when I do it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt monitor the generators. Literally I haven‚Äôt even been playing survivor in awhile and I still have zero clue what you guys are on about with gen rushing.
---
And thats what we call an unfortunate tragedy
---
I get those assholes all of the time oof. I'm currently dumping BP into Ash for mettle, can't wait!
---
Like
---
I never get mad when I get ‚Äúgen rushed‚Äù because that‚Äôs MY FAULT. MY MISTAKE. It‚Äôs not ‚Äútoxic‚Äù it‚Äôs me being a dumbass and that‚Äôs my fault as killer. I can‚Äôt get mad at the survivors for that
---
I feel like there is a difference between 'not letting survivors mess around and waste time' and 'forcing them all out instantly to appease the killer'. And the change being 3 minutes is not long enough, therefore this falls into the latter.
---
I don't think 3 minutes is fair on survivors when you have a close game. Then the added fact that the killer can force this on you? As if the killer has any issue hunting down survivors at gates...
---
I'm up for giving it a chance but I feel like this is going to change things a lot. Usually you are keen to pop the last geny for some breathing space, now it will be the opposite. You wont want to pop it until you are sure because it will be super stressful.
---
Welcome changes to stop trapdoor standoffs and timewasters, but it seems like these changes could have been minor and have instead been thrown in as a big end game killer buff.
---
Yes I fucking understand what a radius is lmao you clearly didn't read what I said correctly. If it extends outwards 32 meters from the killer in all directions than it's a 32 meter radius and a 64 in terms diameter
---
Really? Only recently started hearing about it
---
I'd wish Mend would get a skill check so it could add to the time or result in causing a down when Mend is low enough. Right now there is almost 0 way where mend results in a down. Its just a time sink power. Tbh it reinforces me to tunnel that survivor down after canceling frenzy. Cause if they stay in terror radius they can work on gens, mend, flashlight saves/etc if I go after another.
---
They missed out on a great perk name.
---
Oh right I forgot, I just wanted to use an example
---
When they're jumping in........
---
Monitoring gens doesn't stop survivors from hopping right back on them after you leave. The only time you can't be gen rushed is if you have perks specifically to prevent it, like Discordance, Overcharge, Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, or if you're playing Hag, Billy, Nurse.
---
If you are so delusional as to believe that gen rushing is not a thing, then to put it simply; camping isn't a thing. "Don't let survivors do gens and you won't get gen rushed!1!!1 therefore gen rushing does not exist" don't let the killer hook you and you won't get camped. Your flawed logic works both ways.
---
&gt; This is just going to lead to Survivors not opening the Gates, waiting for the Killer to do it as they teabag him on the way out.
---
True, but at that stage, it's at max a 3 minute wait, not a 30m wait.
---
nice cats fool
---
I didnt ask for spoilers
---
Freddy. Wait until there's only one left standing and they're weak. Put them to sleep for an easy kill. GG.
---
this is funny xD
---
Or Hag. Ruin is not mandatory.
---
It seems like every killer is unpopular with survivors and they need to either get over it and play the game or find something else to play. 
---
I don‚Äôt like a full team of Claudette‚Äôs with tool boxes and flash lights and discord, ill still play the match till the end though.
---
Repost :/
---
Yea that's a solid build. Like mentioned, enduring and spirit fury is also good.
---
GG BABY KILLER EZ
---
I‚Äôve been looking, can‚Äôt find it. DM!!
---
I need this template
---
This is way cool. Mind if I save it?
---
How else are you gonna slow the game down a little bit.
---
How can you smell salt through a shitpost?
---
I said "Most killers" please learn how to read
---
When I play killer I camp for one of two reasons, personally  (and not nearly every match, less than 1 in 15). Either to be my own version of a meme- hag with shackles and the one doc perk that makes your terror radius disappear- and I usually don't put survivors on dead hook when I play like that, or because the survivors are dumb and will literally run right behind me or right in front of me, body block the hook, swarm me when I'm carrying a survivor. Pretty much if they play like sweaty survive with friends groups. It's fun from time to time, and it can be a good way to get frustration over a dumb swf group out, but overall it shouldn't be a recommended play style. It hurts the killer as much as the survivor. They don't get nearly as many chase, damage bloodpoints, they spend a considerable amount of the match being bored, and a lot of times I think people forget it's a game. It's supposed to be challenging and fun, not permanently rage inducing.
---
I obviously know how to read dude. Most killers I've faced camp because it's the only way they know how to secure a kill, because they aren't confident as a player. Majority of the time I get hard camped till I'm in struggle because the killer doesn't feel confident in themselves being able to find me again. I don't play toxic as survivor, and get camped a good bit from rank 5 and up. 
---
Don't be an ass.
---
Fair enough. Although strictly speaking isn't Lightburn considered a different thing from a stun, hence why Enduring doesn't proc on Lightburn?
---
I'm pretty sure 100-250 is yellow. The highest I am willing to put up with when playing as survivor is around the 180s. Any higher and you start getting those ridiculous lag hits.
---
Ingame: Leatherface, just Chainsaw everyone
---
In reality: probably Freddy or Spirit
---
Yep, unfortunately. It's goddamn annoying is what it is.
---
Unless you are Billy - he can go anywhere he wants
---
"You thought I was a dull totem, but it was me! NOED!!!"
---
Two questions:
---
1. Will be a visual or audio notification when the hatch is closed?
---
2. Will keys work on the hatch after it has been closed by the killer?
---
Define viable.
---
Camping actually works more often than not...  so in that sense, it IS a viable strategy
---
Just because people hate it and it is a shitty thing to do doesn‚Äôt make it any less effective
---
Ouch, that sucks. Well that's what happened to me yesterday, I was really pissed because I never DC. BHVR needs to work on this before punishing DCers, I don't want to be banned because the game is broken.
---
Doesn't help that most people assume the unintentional DCs are ragequits and dismiss the fact it's an actual bug. 
---
Hope it gets better soon for you, I'll try to play today and see how it goes.
---
You rock, thanks!
---
I personally enjoy 4King, following all of the survivor made up rules, only to get no response to my gg.
---
seems like you've never seen really top notch swf vs a huntress, chases can take so long but honestly it all depends on the map for her.
---
Sorry, Mikey.  I now belong to Rolf~~'s Great Nano~~.
---
I can't wait for Mike Myers vs Michael Myers
---
Michael : *Audible Breathing*
---
Mike: GROOVY BABY
---
Fire Escape, Retreat and Think Ahead... man. I‚Äôd like these in game .
---
I thought balanced landing was a survivor perk
---
Boooooo tunneling
---
As a new player I did not know about the flashlight, thank you!
---
Lol well, they got meg
---
It's even worse when you see it coming like that.
---
I made it out though.
---
But the shrouds can somehow be recovered from the fire?
---
Called "child of the entity" - gives you one free lift lol
---
As others have said, good headsets are essential for her. 
---
If you wanna try a different killer, hag makes for some very interesting matches.
---
Ed-Boy Play the song of my Village!
---
By the same logic if you are good at running the killer around,you can taunt him so he keeps chasing you while others work on a gen. It's a "strategy" as well.
---
surveillance is actually good on high mobility killers
---
That‚Äôs an exploit, they can be permanently banned for it
---
Nothing worse than wasting a slot for kindred only to still not get saved. I legit switched to killer and camped survivors the rest of the day.
---
Nice
---
All of the killers are already dead when they go to the entities realm.
---
New survivor should be Ed w/ a pebble in the shoe perk.
---
"baby killer" is the worst thing to describe anything ever
---
just call them a "bad killer" or something, not BABY killer
---
BHVR is going to perm ban these people now
---
Not really. Camping is only useful in the low ranks. I‚Äôve get higher and higher, you‚Äôll be playing against more competent survivors who won‚Äôt bother going for the rescue. So if you‚Äôre still camping in the purple and red ranks, you‚Äôre not very good at killer.
---
Actually I‚Äôm pretty sure salt doesn‚Äôt have a smell at all.
---
How do you get more time if a timer is added. And if someone is hooked when the gates gets opened he probably won't escape and teammates probably aren't going to risk dying with a lower chance to survive
---
Yes haha
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll try using a good headset!
---
I've been playing the game a couple weeks now. In the beginning my experience was a mixed bag, some people were toxic, but mostly people were friendly. When I played killer I even had someone say "GG that was the most fun I've had!" after only one escaped. Never camped hooks, half the time go across the map. Then I got my GF to try killer because she wanted to see their perspective to survive better and she, a rank 20 with level 1 killers, kept meeting SWF groups that were purple ranked. It's hard to have fun when you just started the game and you're up against people who have been playing significantly longer and have all 4 perks at III. 
---
Then yesterday I play Killer and it's a similar story with almost every group. All SWF against people playing significantly longer and them being BM about outplaying someone who just started playing this game this month. Then I get a decent game and people are salty that a few of them died. 
---
I just want to keep playing and gradually get better.
---
It looked to me like the building was decaying, or falling apart as part of the collapse.
---
Can the devs please consider doing this? I was mildly disappointed when it didn't happen hahaha
---
r/expanddong
---
Learn how to read

Genius
---
Third person killer!!
---
Take the L and move on fam. Stubborn pride isn't a good look on anyone.
---
You should jump when they are near, not expect them to be near once you‚Äôve done jumping. It‚Äôs even better that way, you do not have to mindgame.
---
The timer slows down significantly when someone is dying state or hooked. 
---
Plus you hinge that entire scenario on probably‚Äôs and if maybes. The EGC is supposed to make survivors more weary of making an end game save while also punishing the meandering some people tend to do while thinking about making that decision to save. If you have the ability to make the risk, three minutes is more than enough time to do so. If you aren‚Äôt confident in yourself, just walk away.
---
What freaking rank do u play? I'm sorry these meg's offended you. I'm an extremely toxic meg at just Sr 12 lowest is 6. Obviously because I play for my team
---
Really?
---
I think the devs said they're stuck in between life and death actually.
---
It may still be worthwhile to report.  Iirc, devs have in the past banned people for saying truly nasty shit in endgame.
---
fuck
---
Another tip, using the flashlight on it will give an audio notification (can't remember if it's visual as well) to the hag that the trap was destroyed so don't stay in the area after doing it!
---
I just want this pillow to hold me and whisper "we're gonna live forever."
---
It should let the player know they got a positive response in game
---
Temp ban.
---
GIMME
---
I don't see how this has anything to do with DBD... You are specifically talking about his stream and how he behaves.
---
I just started playing again after a several month break and when I came back I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see ds not being complained about lol
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Wasn't sure if it's a meme or being serious, My apologies.
---
Toxic means doing something with the intention to be an asshole. Using a strong perk does not mean that you are an toxic.
---
LED light strips.
---
I main both and disagree. You can literally remove it from the game. You can straight make a killer run 3 perks and if he has other hex perks even less. Cant do that withth survivors. 4 survivors with tank builds? Just gotta suck it up.
---
OwO , you no likey? \*looks embarrassed\*
---
Looks dope man gj
---
Yeah I watched two fridays ago and honestly couldn‚Äôt believe it. It was cringe worthy seeing his chat not realize the bigger picture. If anyone is looking for people to watch I recommend 
---
Devib (very good humble killer main)
---
Ohtofu (plays both sides mainly survivor also very good)
---
Ralph (one of the top huntress mains)
---
All 3 very appreciative down to earth streamers
---
Hex ruin isn't even that hard to work through lmao
---
How do you do these cool text things like changing the size or boldness i
---
The guys a massive none appreciative dick head honestly, angers me that he represents this game.
---
Exaggeration is fun
---
I'm just going to assume that you mean camping before the exit gates are powered ,
---
Because you can't really do anything else then.
---
The problem with proximity VOIP is that it'll be used to toxicity, as it was in F13 and that game ain't alive anymore. It won't do any good for this game either.
---
Of course, no problem :)
---
The devs confirmed that that moment in the trailer when only a single generator was finished, the endgame collapse was triggered through debug commands for testing purposes. Endgame collapse only starts if the hatch is closed or if a gate is opened. Source will come when off mobile.
---
It's alright no need to apologize 
---
And yeah a perk isn't necessarily alone toxic but a perk can be used to be very toxic.
---
Im crying rn wraith would nevr do that
---
Yup, noed lets everyone actually play the game.
---
Hilarious video, though probably a nightmare if implemented, everything would devolve to extra High IQ ear rape, and 24/7 butthurt. It would be an all you can mute buffet. After a month most players would probably have permanent mute on.
---
You kissed their ass, and you got more points off the round. Mutual exchanges are a very good sources of fun.
---
Huntress/David or Nurse/Nea. Call 'em Red Forest Lullaby and Thanatophobia.
---
It feels really great when something like that happens. Today I got told that some dude was gonna come over to my house and slit my throat...
---
Oh
---
It's your teammate's fault for farming you
---
Thank you dude, appreciate it ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Monto is bae
---
The most annoying is going to be doctor, I don't understand why do you even need to ask that.
---
You can avoid it tho. Lockers. Get in the range. Cant avoid get out of jail cards like dead hard. Thats why theyre so good. They give you a whole new chance at the chase.
---
I‚Äôve noticed a significant increase in these dcs, and I‚Äôve also noticed that you can tell in game whether it was a bug/crash or manual dc based on whether there is a dc noise or not.
---
Because you can fucking avoid it really easily.
---
This has been in the game for a while. It‚Äôs part of the bigger auto aim issue.
---
Great video but real world scenario it would be open to some proper grieving.
---
Unless you're legion, never seen this happen.
---
Ever watched garbluemoon?
---
Its balanced just fine but its a crutch perk that bad killers need when they can't kill before the gates are powered. People that run noed aren't confident in their ability to kill efficiently and would rather waste a perk slot that could be used for something that actually helps the early game
---
Honestly I don't have the best vision so I have not noticed him.
---
The most innocent looking are usually the craziest in bed. ;)
---
Flashlights are objectively garbage? A survivor who is good at using one can save at least one life with it as well as give a good chance at losing a chase. Tell me what other yellow rarity item can do that.
---
&gt; will go on a campaign against disconnects, but then support lobby dodging
---
these are not even remotely the same and you know that. i am so sick of this false equivalency
---
Hook animation overrides DS.
---
I couldn't get enough of the laughably bad writing
---
looks familiar to a rank 4 game i played against a nurse
---
‚ÄúJust bring Self-Care, damn!‚Äù -Claudette, probably
---
Yeah it's sucks especially if your Freddy.
---
I don't agree with the DCing part though 
---
Just try your best.
---
 Good luck.
---
then you're either very new or just actually never experienced this sorta thing
---
I‚Äôd rather have the killer be BO. (The guy under the bed in the attic) because all the ‚Äúrubber‚Äù is, is Even Peters cute ass dressed up.
---
I don't know why I thought plunderers was also a teachable for him.  Forgot about open handed.  But yeah that too is just an atrocious perk lol.  Either way every other survivor in the game has at least one useful perk.  He is the lone obsession.
---
&gt;be me
---
&gt;against Hag
---
&gt;P3 Ace gets hooked
---
&gt;two people crouch walk up to him
---
&gt;I unhook him
---
&gt;he immediately starts sprinting
---
&gt;immediately triggers a trap that he saw Hag put down
---
&gt;immediately goes down
---
&gt;DCs
---
&gt;thanks for the unsafe unhook emblem my dude :)
---
to be honest a throwing item perk sounds interesting lol.
---
the only reason i play killer anymore is because survivor lobbies are too long because no one wants to play killer because of how awful it is
---
Yes and like I‚Äôve said already, that‚Äôs my point. Killers shouldn‚Äôt be able to move/hook before you even get a chance to hit your Ds. What‚Äôs the point of running an anti tunnel perk if it doesn‚Äôt work when you get tunneled?
---
3v1 best game mode. Lol
---
Killers shouldn‚Äôt be able to move/hook before you even get the chance to hit your Ds.
---
According to paragraph ¬ß2.3 in the "Laws of the fog" the killer is obligated to not kill the survivors too quickly. Doing this is unfair as the killer is doing their job too well. This bores the entity.
---
New killer = Joe Rogan
---
Everybody bullies my poor boy Bubba- he‚Äôs just trying to make his folks proud RIP
---
He's said it's his favorite movie!  Also has an AWiL pipe
---
1. Survivors don't need items the way killers need add ons. It's completely fine to go into a match as a survivor without any items (though you are putting yourself at a disadvantage).
---
2. You get enough items from the bloodweb that you don't need to pay attention to chests at all. Just using what you get from the bloodweb, by the time you're ready to prestige a survivor you won't have run out of items that you got from the bloodweb, assuming you're not a potato and can actually survive a reasonable amount of the time. 
---
3. Searching chests wastes time and chest related perks waste perk slots. 
---
Chest builds can be fun, but they're not strong builds. And it's a good job they're not strong, otherwise every game would be full of insta heals and purple toolboxes.
---
&gt;Why do people not use plunderer's + ace in the hole more?
---
Because unless you are playing SWF, other players will plunder before you get the chance.
---
In most games you will manage to plunder one, maybe two chests if lucky. Wasting 2 perk slots for 1 chest isn't worth. 
---
I still run Ace + Plunderer here and there but this is the reason that makes me drop it after a few games.
---
I never use any items ever as a surv, so that's my reason.
---
BBQ gives an incentive to leave hook. BBQ makes it a lot more fun for the killer against immersed survivors. You can also counter BBQ. If you seriously die because of BBQ then you really just need to get better.
---
I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôll turn even the straightest guy gay.
---
The emperor probably said ‚Äúgg ez baby killer‚Äù
---
Imagine donating money for free entertainment
---
i once had 0 bp
---
I laugh when I see or type those. Even when I die it's just a tradition haha
---
*at least
---
It's two words.
---
survivors literally have the ability to prevent it from activating
---
This isn‚Äôt a shitpost so in extremely confused
---
Keep it up
---
Hey if you like saving people why not try my favourite build: well make it , botany knowledge, borrowed time and pharmacy .
---
Cackles in nurse
---
After I killed a Claudette who T-Bagged me at every pallet, he bitched and complained that I tunneled and camped him.
---
people who don't cleanse totems are not confident in their ability to walk and chew gum at the same time
---
r/sbeve
---
&gt;When Legions Iridesent Button affects the whole map doesn‚Äòt this mean that Coulrophobia is always affecting healing?
---
Yes, it does. It will be an interesting setup to use in the new Legion since it will be riskier to remain injured against him but at least Iridescent Button is an Ultra Rare. 
---
Right now people shouldn't heal against him so this perk would be useless.
---
&gt; and that other street map.
---
badham. yeah it's killer hell
---
Its bot optimal youre forgoing two useful perks for a chest build that you can only take one thing. It seems pointless.
---
Yea now Im more about IF (the plagues' one) so everytime you shut down a survivor everyone of them will scream
---
How? tell me how you did it?
---
lmfao how many of these "AS A TOTALLY REAL KILLER MAIN you're making me look bad by association!!1!" comments are ya gonna make?
---
Sounds like my old TV when I left it on the channel for watching VHS tapes.
---
Yeah I don't get how True gets shit on while pug gets praised. He's my age and is so cringe the way he screeches all the time and yells out nonsense. I stopped watching him
---
It's like companies have different positions for different things that work independently from one another OMG.
---
True tho
---
And game developers take advise about what changes should happen from these streamers.
---
Yep. I NEVER used the old DS because it just  felt cheap and scummy. I've been using it a lot now because if it even procs at all, the killer deserves it. It's funny, now that I've been running it, it seems like I never get tunneled anymore ü§î
---

That particular one is ^
---
Confirmation bias. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
---
Thats why they said anyone doing this will be banned
---
Lol bb killer git gud.
---
This is cancer
---
looks amazing!  Is that a floating stone canvas behind the TV?
---
I laugh my ass off when I see people complain about "a squadette with 4 flashlights". Those are legit the best games. Free hits and over altruistic downs galore!
---
I was running Plunder‚Äôs instinct one time as Nea, and going against LF. When he hit me near a pallet and made me drop the Skeleton key I had gotten from the chest, I went back, picked it up and slammed the pallet in his face XD
---
Why would you want to watch angry pug. Guy seems like an asshole.
---
My idea is to make it the WIP form.
---
For every killed, escaped, or sacrificed survivor gain a repair speed boost.  Pretty much reverse Fire Up.
---
I‚Äôve heard that too. Not really gamebreaking, but definitely annoying.
---
It's definitely more effective than what I've seen in this game. Granted, their ranked rewards are another incentive for people to stick it out and play, rather than give up and DC. We need both in DbD.
---
iri button affects the map for like only a second and a half at a time.
---
Post healing nerf, I prefer bond for solo. Self care is just painful to sit through without botany.
---
That looks freaking amazing! Well done!
---
It‚Äôs not even that toxic dude that is way more toxic communities
---
But then where are its eyes? its mouth?
---
The entity wraps its tendril around hooks all over the map and can shoot them out of the ground. No spider can do that.
---
I wish they would add post game chat. It would be toooooo funny
---
this would only possibly be true if you down the survivor with feral frenzy and only if iri button activates when feral frenzy is used on someone in deep wounds, which i'm not sure of. and if it is possible now it won't be after the legion nerf
---
We never get to see it fully. And you can't say that it looks like a tree when it stabs into someone
---
People are petty lmao that's the problem. Like, last might I had 3 games where at least one person DCed when they got caught first, despite me burning streamers. It's absolutely ridiculous; I can't even burn bps out if fear that someone will DC out of pettiness.
---
It‚Äôs funny when the killers sweat it up on a single player too lmao 2v1 and me and my buddy still escaped against a Billy.
---
That‚Äôs good
---
Not his fault everyone dc'd
---
Uhh, excuse me? Kindness isn't allowed here. You might want to post this elsewhere. Only toxicity is allowed here
---
Ez pz I will still tbag at the exit gatez.
---
The stalker becomes the stalked.
---
So wait, are they bad for playing the game with 3 perks? Or making use of end game?
---
Claudettes: Try me Bitch
---
Then don't watch lol. I'm not subbed nor do I even watch the ads (adblocker). He can be entertaining during the day when he is in a good mood but when he goes off the hinges on rants or is piss drunk he is very cringy imo - however I'd say a majority of his fanbase enjoy seeing an unfiltered drunkard and there is nothing wrong with that.
---
yeah but I'm saying that's why they dc in the game. if they saw it was e.g. legion in the lobby they'd dodge before the game starts. which is why dodging in the lobby as killer is just as bad as a survivor dcing at the start of the game, in a way
---
Yes, because no competent killer will let survivors get a flashlight save.
---
I literally just leave gens when people can‚Äôt hit a GOOD skill check.
---
Original and well thought out. Nothing over powered, imo, as you put in conditions. If I may, how about some more Details on the Story?
---
Childish salt at this point. Salty killer main I'm guessing
---
What about today? Cause... You know, I had some dailies
---
Tomorrow - Gets bullied by squadette then teabagged at exit
---
considering these people seem to think legion is fine in its current state and doesn't need ANY changes..
---
DH is pretty easy to avoid. Just get close enough so they have to preemptively use deadhard. I haven't met players yet consistently who are good enough to dead hard a short attack of a killer.
---
The one survivor that isn't shown is cleansing the totem as it activates
---
The fact that Billy is a good killer is just another reason to run ruin, because he doesn't need much else in terms of 4th perk.
---
I'm glad the devs are against using voice proximity in this game. Sure, it might be great at first but then the outcome would be full of toxicity. If they ever did bring in the idea then there does need to be an option to switch off voice-chat for those who don't want to put up with it.
---
Such a cool setup, why didn't you display a better game with it?
---
Michael with a smile is best

‚¨ÜÔ∏èüö´SCAM WARNINGüö´‚¨Ü   
---
**This applies to mugs/posters/etc...**
---
This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post‚Äôs photo, onto garment preview images.  
---
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it‚Äôs inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print. 
---
Be careful, friends!
---
I gave up on ever watching Pug the night I saw him drunkenly rip into a new sub for getting a tier 1 sub instead of a tier 3, because he was wasting everyone's time with that cheap ass shit.  That had to be around last summer.  Never went back.

Camper and tunneler, abandoning a chase just to camp, what a bitch...

It's even worse when they run directly into a Bear Trap that was very close by to the hook that they should have seen being placed.
---
Today's fine since it's 4/20
---
Game lasted 5 mins with all DC's
---
I've been saying this for months. just not between killer and survivor because that's going to be toxic central

Someone tell me if this post is deleted i cant find it anymore.
---
Rewarding good behavior is better then punishing bad. While I agree that there needs to be a punishment for dc'ing, I have been dced by the game countless times and it would suck to get a week ban because of spaghetti code
---
If there's only two of them I like to slug them and let the other survivor pick them up.
---
Survivors who don't hide from the killer must be punished, no matter how many survivors are left. Even if I let them wiggle off afterwards.
---
I see it
---
I just found fungoose.  While he can be a little cocky, he spends a lot of streams explaining every single thing he does as a killer or survivor.  It's a really great stream to watch to get some insight into playing better.
---
God imagine how nice getting face camped and tunneled must be in that set up! :3
---
And cut yourself on the multiple shards of glass
---
Ok thanks it got removed for no flair but added and they put it back up.
---
Well, he IS  a fog whisperer, and thus an anointed representative streamer for dbd.
---
This was great!
---
Wtf with nurse???? I can't play nurse impossible for me. How you get that?
---
I can just imagine two grown men running in circles around a pillar. With cartoon music in the backround.
---
Yeah true, it confuses me a little bit.  May  I ask if you are on pc or console?
---
This is not how this meme works
---
What is with the dces lately, I wasted 3 puddings from 4man dces just for playing freddy.
---
Looks nice.  I've always been curious how well the dynamic light stuff works though. Dbd does look really sweet with the red there.
---
Is this hacked
---
Never heard of em.
---
Because people are too damn horny
---
Ive had the game since Christmas and play it every weekend
---
Amazing!!
---
Even Speedwagon is afraid!
---
...so far.
---
Great work! I assume this is digital, but it has a cool pastel look to it. Keep up the awesome artwork!
---
That is 100% a strategy lmao.
---
If someone is camping a hook just leave them. Its not that hard.
---
Wow what a Loser. I usally dc when there are 3 ppl unless i got double bp offerings, wich i dont use because there are so many 3 man games and its just not worth it. Always funny how killers sweat and slug for the 3k in a 3 man match.
---
"Find the Exit"
---
You're right. He should have walked away, probably knowing that all of the survivors were right there.
---
He should have walked away from the hook, so that they could've gotten a free unhook. With no Gens and a survivor most likely opening/have already opened the gates, he had a very small chance to get any other hits, or hooks.
---
He should have just let the survivor go absolutely free, instead of making an effort to secure more kills.
---
Subaluwa!
---
Hey, you don't know if they kill babies in their spare time or not
---
I know that 4% haste anywhere
---
Just out here tryna ruin peoples day...
---
Nah I am just bored and I main killer and survivor. I guess you are a survivor main.
---
Nooo plz he is too good he can't do that
---
Ive mained killer the past six months dude. If you're bored try doing something useful aside from being a petty trollish ass on Reddit.
---
I‚Äôd like to butt in say- I much prefer Space Coconut over TydeTyme when it comes to informative videos. I have just always felt TydeTyme‚Äôs way of explaining things is very definite- he says things as if it‚Äôs 100% factual. I remember he used to say the hag was a low-tier killer.
---
Thanks for taking the time to source it, people in this subreddit usually don't bother
---
Nice, deleting your comments btw. A1 move
---
Console, I play on the ps4.
---
Is the killer Legion?
---
Does it matter? DCing is wrong.
---
Oh, I didn't saw that "Find the exit", well, I think you're right.
---
It‚Äôs the same on Xbox as well. Half of the time it‚Äôs fine and then it‚Äôll be all distorted sounding the next.
---
Just let your teammates heal you next time. And make sure you teabag at them when you first see them in the match so they know you‚Äôre friendly.
---
Why don't they just temporarily lock them?
---
I want to know which killer it was, not if DCing is right or wrong. It's definitely wrong lol
---
I'm the kind of person that, if I see a good piece of artwork, I want to know who made it so I can go see more, y'know? I bet plenty of others are like that as well, just like yourself.
---
yeah even if you excel as a survivor and escape your bloodpoint gain is abysmally low.
---
What is ERB?
---
YAY I SMELL A BAN!
---
The worst kind of bullying is when you miss so many hatchet throws that the survivors feel bad for you and stand still 
---
DON‚ÄôT PATRONIZE ME YOU SCUMBAG
---
i was 80% and with my kit it was much faster. but anyway, is it common? i mean, this behave?
---
*Pretty good job intensifies*
---
I have lost like 3 escape cakes like that. You can definitely loose add ons if killer dc. Sometimes you don't get bloodpoints either.
---
Survivor should be Eddy, cause their's the on episode where Rolf beats the PISS out of him.
---
I know, right? Getting a Merciless nowadays is an even bigger rush.
---
Epic Rap Battles of History, search it on youtube.
---
Now that‚Äôs hot
---
Nurse. You can tell by the power.
---
Tru is one of the nicest streamers, why would he get shit but not the piss drunk begging cunt?
---
I haven‚Äôt realized how scary Michael‚Äôs walk is until now.
---
r/dbdgonewild is an... Unfortunate stain
---
It's even worse because it's a waste of add-ons *as well as* offerings.
---
You were subbed to him for over a year and just realized he has no class? I watched his stream for less than 30 minutes and it was enough...he was so disrespectful to his subs, toxic and off-putting, I can't believe he is a fog whisperer
---
Famous last words.
---
Right? I get Tru3's attitude might not be everyone's cup of tea but he's a decent guy
---
His walk is funny, like hurrr durr im so evil
---
PS4: The Rolling Meme
---
Oh yea, shit son I remember that, my fav is Abe Lincoln vs Chuck Norris.
---
Big Booty Jane Main
---
If you think about it, that alone feels morally worse than unsystematic mass murder, like what Nurse, Doc, and Trapper did. Killing a child under any circumstances is actually considered more abhorrent.
---
You can‚Äôt see it on PC either. Unless I am really dumb and have missed it all this time lol.
---
Similarly RNG dependant, but more forgiving to billy, yes. The chainsaw helps him get to sightlines faster, but if the exit gate is so obscured that you have to be humping it to see, there's a chance the time to open it will be shorter than the time it takes for him to patrol.
---
Remember Me billy = you don't stand a chance :\^)
---
This is terrifying
---
If this person hasn‚Äôt played since the emblem update sure.
---
I wish you could get this without his pants on.
---
It was Nea
---
They probably played survivor to get bloodpoints and use it to level up the killer without playing killers hence the rank 20. That‚Äôs my guess on it.
---
I know. Adaptive Lighting wouldnt be good for getting Flashlight spammed though, and bodyblocks just wouldnt be as annoying.
---
Is that a ps4? If so definitely add me, Back_stabber134
---
Cause why look for an item when you're gonna get camped to death anyway
---
Can we get Joshu as the next killer?
---
Still, a standard no addon billy is better.
---
The new Leatherface cosmetic looks pretty good
---
Yes and get all perks, all my killers are p3 level 50 except for bubba and doctor who are level 30, I just got plague to p3 50
---
I can't see the picture but it is possible to level up killers without playing them or just not playing for a couple rank resets
---
They seem a lot worse than usual--I honestly can't help but wonder if it's partly because Survivors are feeling wronged by the fact that the devs are trying to balance the game. They feel as though their power is being slowly taken away from them so they're making sure that if they can't play and enjoy the game, no one can.
---
Xbox one X. I'll gladly take donations for a ps4 though :)
---
Oregon trail player&gt;all others
---
This is terrifying yet beautiful
---
You can do it!
---
I‚Äôm either paired up with survivors who drop all pallets immediately and die with no gens completed or I‚Äôm paired with survivors who do all the gens before I can get 1 hook.
---
I got grotesque right jerry
---
depends on the perks and the skill of the killer but yeah billy is easy one of the best in the game so he obviously gonna be better.
---
Are you looking for a relationship OP ?
---
spermaban !
---
It's all kinds of botched
---
So like every game ?
---
Lots of people just find tru to be annoying and that's all the reason they need to shit on him
---
Maybe some day, for now enjoy that nice setup, also, happy microphone day and 4/20
---
As in?
---
Had a three man last night while playing as the doctor, one of whom immediately DC'ed. 
---
Decided to play hide and seek with the last two survivors, then when we were done playing I waved to them as I let them walk out the gate. 
---
Made me feel like I'm doing my part to improve survivor/killer relations.
---
It should go live in a couple of hours. So get ready boy.
---
He's passive aggressive at best. Tru3 is always an entertaining stream and VOD for me personally. I cant stand streamers who yell and get salty everytime things dont go their way. Worst Ive heard from Tru3 is "WOWOWOW" followed by "A'right ten" lmao.
---
Practice
---
I need this set up in my life.
---
NOED is a shitty perk that rewards bad killers with free kills. Its counter play is an extreme timewaste, im still hopeful it gets changed
---
Michael Myers. He‚Äôs the only one we *know* is completely unkillable due to the movies showing us this. You could also say Freddy, but Freddy has ‚Äúdied‚Äù before, Michael has yet to officially die even once in any of his movies.
---
It's new players that aren't used to having their ass handed to them every game.
---
Healing yourself in front of a teamate is dumb af and steals their altruism emblem credit while giving you none towards your own.  The difference between someone else healing you and a med kit is negligible anyway.  Unless the killer is barreling down on you just take the damn heal man.
---
Yes self caring in front of people triggers a lot of us.  I've sandbagged over it in the past.
---
Yeah same, though if i run noed i play without camping period. I abhore camping in general so if i run it, ill use it maybe secure the 3rd or last kill of the game. If theres still 4 left ill let them leave, i got outplayed ggs and all that
---
True. But they were a rank 12.
---
Fungoose is one of my favorite streamers. It's amazing listening to his callouts be right like 99% of the time.
---
I love those people... I needed 4 phantasm attacks for my daily.
---
Myers owns me.
---
Dang, that‚Äôs pretty good. Good job! You should be proud of yourself.
---
Hell yea it is. I've had people sandbag me in unbelievable ways and their excuse will be "I can't pip without heal points" or something like that.
---
I personally would rather you go do gens so we can get out.
---
The same phase came to the Rainbow subreddit with fan-made operations. There's going to be a thousand of these, with high effort and cool ones like this and lots of shitty ones made for upvotes until the mods get involved and have to tell us to stop.
---
I love running bond with them and just giving out presents for everyone 
---
How ever the killer doesn't seem to like them :(
---
I'll admit when I really got into playing killer, I used it as a safety net. I wasn't too worried about getting hooks until it was available, and I felt skill gap in my own rank due to it. When I stopped using noed (hag main) I actually learned some really neat trap placements that not only got me points, but kills. If I run noed now, at most I have two survivors left end game. That's if I'm going against a well coordinated solo team or a good swf in my current rank. If not I usually have one person end game, if even that. 
---
People get so worked up over protecting a crutch sometimes because they feel it's all they rely on. Idk if people forget that killer will almost always come out with more BPs than at least three survivors, many times four. It's honestly a perk i wouldn't be upset with disappearing. I don't want it, but if it did, or got changed I wouldn't complain.
---
He's actually not a fog whisperer currently, which is great.
---
Camp, tunnel, NOED. The rookie trifecta. 
---
To your point tho, its definitely not hard to identify when a killer likely has Noed based on those behaviors. This isnt surprising considering Noed rewards not pressuring gens.
---
really weird how this logic never applies to survivor perks that don't have a hard counter. so odd hmm
---
If you don't play killer for 3 to 5 months, your rank goes back to 20 after multiple rank resets.
---
Spirit/Adam, Doc/Feng or Huntress/David
---
I need this huntress cosmetics, STAT!
---
If you take two perks for item farming, you make a build around farming and either luck/survival. Its a gimmick build that you run consistently for a good few games, stock up, and let em carry you to the next farm. Plus burn a shiny coin. Always always always.
---
yeah, i think you've done a pretty god job so far...
---
but in all seriousness, that's freakin' dope!
---
Upvoted you because you said no lies
---
I don't see the point they'll never get better if they quit everytime something doesn't go their way
---
&gt; extreme timewaste
---
5 totems, 14 seconds each, spread across 4 people is an extreme tine waste? 
---
noed punishes survivors who just want to do gens and end the match as fast as possible so they can taunt at the gates
---
As opposed to effectively not being able to play the game when they get camped/tunneled early.
---
I was fine with DS.  It was only really effective with SWF, and I already needed to play more cutthroat against them anyways.
---
@gamedevs please. Just please.
---
thanks man, appreciate it!
---
NOED.
---
Mettle of man, dead hard, adrenaline and borrowed time is now that most common loadout I see on survivors. Occasionally BT is switched out for Decisive Strike. All 4 will be on chat of course, which the game design is not balanced around despite how common it is. Also multiple survivors will have med kits with up to two insta-heal add ons. The only fully reliable counter to this that the killer alone controls is Myers' tombstone. 
---
Until killers are given a minimum of 4 insta-down parks and add ones that proc reliably at a time of the killer's choosing, I will continue to dismiss comments such as yours.
---
Every. Fucking. Time.
---
*installs fog machine*
---
**Thicken Mist**
---
Exactly. Cant wait to see all the DC'S on the new game content.
---
Healing right in front of a teammate makes no sense. Even if you have a medkit, why waste your charges when you have a free heal? Especially when the guy said he was already 80% healed anyway.  Unless the killer is right on your ass and you absolutely HAVE to heal yourself asap it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Work with your team. That petty little moment might cause you to die on hook later because you‚Äôre showing that teammate you don‚Äôt care to take their help.
---
Cool I was just seeing if you had double standards.
---
well according to this guy 4 he rather wastes his addons to get 4 dc's instead of playing the game lol...
---
I am almost certain this is incorrect. It can be used one time, and then it will no longer build charges.
---
There's definitely something involving the game which causes infinite load screens and crashes, which may be why it's more often then ever before.
---
But I'm also pretty sure theres another factor. In my opinion, i think many survivors are annoyed they kinda get the short end of the stick every update. Nerf after nerf to make killing easy for those who are not as skilled, all the things survivors once had that were considered god tier get the nerf, yet they still have to deal with camping, tunnelling, ebony moris, noed almost every single game getting you caught right at the very end just for doing the objective also not even knowing how many totems are left despite because you're a solo survivor, etc. Not saying some things didn't need to be nerfed, bnp did need to be nerfed for example (but was nerfed way too hard to justify being ultra rare) but it's somewhat disheartening when the devs wanna nerf every tool you have into the ground, yet the things that make for a sour experience for a survivor just gets a pass, making it to where only a really good swf team have a chance against a killer who is good. They even wanted to nerf instaheals, I'm hoping they don't but I'm pretty sure it's coming eventually. 
---
Survivors seem to get unnecessarily weaker with every update, really hurting the solo players and not really hurting the only thing almost all killers can agree are a problem: god tier swf teams that give you no chance. I play survivor when I'm forced to (because you can only play survivor with friends) and I'm often met with a bad experience. I don't dc, but it makes me wanna play killer.
---
It's the price point that's making me hesitate
---
Yeah i do, loop the killer to buy time,save teammates off hooks (on solo you also don't know if you should go and leave the gen or  ignore a totem to save them or if someone else is going), find someone and heal them, look for hexes. Totems are in there, but i will not prioratize them, many times i have made certain though watching back gameplay that wasting time on LOOKING FOR (not ignoring)  totems would mean a gen being pressured by the killer just before popping (unless the totem is right freaking there next to it) or just little gen time in general, cause on solo, the i'm gonna get them totems mindset wastes time no matter how you look at it.
---
A lot of survivors are just done after all the nerfs to them and just DC against annoying killer builds/behaviour
---
There has always been a decent amount that just DC if they go down quickly.
---
Wow ok I'm surprised, I was expecting you to go ham on me but alright nice
---
That is so sick!
---
That'd actually be pretty dope
---
Yes
---
Br0k3n is a good streamer too. Super nice fella and he donates all his earnings to diff charities
---
He wasted 2 other perk slots in order to distract the killer.
---
Agreed. Assuming there are no extraordinary circumstances, it will usually take \~30 seconds to get to a survivor, and presumably at least a few more to down them. Then a few seconds to come out of the hit animation, and 3 more for pickup, and more still to get to a hook and complete that animation. Then the 120 seconds until sacrifice. That's enough for five gens, even if you down the survivor in 2 seconds flat, and none of them have toolboxes. The three remaining survivors only need to spend 133.3 seconds on gens each to finish them all.  
---
  
---
The only reason this works against noobs is because they cannot hit the hex ruin skillchecks. If you do this against a veteran survivor team you will get annihilated. If you don't have hex ruin, they will be out the exit gate before the guy dies on hook.
---
So bc the killers is bad he get the right to camp the fuck?
---
Streaming is work. For a lot of people, it's a full-time job. If they're providing you with free entertainment, why not show them appreciation?
---
i never actually, really used NOED when playing normally, even when i had no clue what to do when playing killer. the only times i did use NOED was when i was doing a basement chest protector build or a tier 1 Myers only build or a no blink Nurse build, basically only when i'm messing around. i almost want to use NOED once just to see how it is and then never touch it again because god lord, it feels scummy as hell. they really should change the perk into something else, it was needed back in 2016 when the game was... well, the way it was but now you don't need NOED to win
---
People DC against legion because of how he‚Äôs a flawed design that is annoying to play against. Which I‚Äôm ok with. Otherwise, there‚Äôs zero excuse to DC no matter what happens in a game
---
Which perks exactly? Which perks reward the survivors for failure to this degree?
---
I'd do a league with rules like this: 8 games per match, and the killers are separated into tiers, so Billy and Nurse can only be used in one game for each side. Legion and Freddy probably will be in E tier, and not forced to use at all, since they've both been nerfed into the ground.
---
Make it points based, and most points after 8 games wins the match.

Yes it‚Äôs possible.

Would they stack? Because that would be necessary since solo survivors cannot see eachothers perks. There would be a lot of wasted perk slots if they didn't stack in some way.
---
Here's to another "AngryPug is an ass" post. I don't understand why anyone watches him anymore. Every time I see him in Twitch compilations he's yelling at Killers for being "sweaty tryhard faggots" because they chased him and hit him twice. Even in clips where he's not being needlessly toxic he still screams and freaks out like it's 2014 and he's making a Five Nights at Freddy's Let's Play.
---
Pug is the Tyler1 of the Dead by Daylight community, only without any of the charm or humor that made Tyler1 popular. He just screams and swears and tells everyone that everyone sucks but himself. And then he wonders why people don't like him.
---
I honestly wish they'd remove his items from the charity case. I cringe a little whenever I see a Meg with the Angry Pug top.
---
Not true... MOM works only one time
---
video made me laugh my asshole. honestly I would love it if they did that and just added a ability so people can turn it off so one will complain
---
Brotha, I hate to burst your bubble. But every rank has idiots
---
I was a rank 1 killer and the times I‚Äôve faced a camping insidious leatherface or the times I decided to meme it up with basement leatherdaddy , I still got 2-3 kills on average lol and they usually kill my team... because I‚Äôm the only one not running straight into them
---
At the moment (rank reset and I just bought the game last week for pc) im around rank 10
---
Still, same thing... and once I‚Äôm back in red, it would most likely be the same
---
Making it viable. Not saying it‚Äôs full proof and you‚Äôre going to do well every time, but if something works at any level at some moments, it is viable
---
I‚Äôm super curious on this honestly XD time stamps, VOD link? Given this has happened ‚Äúmultiple times‚Äù someone would make a YT vid of it all but nope. Anyways, I‚Äôm not doubting you, I just... wanna see it for myself before passing judgement!
---
Never heard them say it but thanks. I just don‚Äôt get why rage quitting is a reportable offense tho if they don‚Äôt want us using it?
---
Fair enough, but my experience is not the greatest, i haven't played the game like mad due to lack of time, and some of the spawns seem to have changed and new ones added, again making solo a bit of a gamble on taking them down.
---
It also means "we" in Norwegian
---
NOED and totems are in the game as a way to slow down the speed at which gens get repaired. 80 seconds alone without any items is very short and having something to incentivize survivors to put their man power somewhere else for any amount of time has always been really needed to help with game balance because you guys have 3 stages on the hook. Survivors have a lot of room for error, and loadouts that can hit up to 16 perks and 4 items exasperates that gap between how much error survivors and killers can make. So because you guys have all this room for error, a high amount of perks, and the ability to do gens very very very quickly, there has to be something in the game to balance that out and NOED and totems have generally always been it. Because you guys literally refuse to do any totems ever at all, devs had to start figuring out something else which is why we now have the god awful Sloppy Butcher meta, but I digress. As for your comment,
---
&gt; NOED feels like a robbery if you havnt been caught all game
---
Sounds like you had some time to do dome totems, eh. Hmm. 
---
&gt; You cant even tell if your teamates have cleansed totems or not, you have to waste time checking already cleansed totems all to deny a shitty perk that shouldnt exsist.
---
As usual the subtext here is that you want a way to ensure that NOED literally is incapable of activating. Yawn.
---
I'm not saying the perks are op or anything, I know there are counters. I am saying I'm just seeing them in every match. I would like to see variety.
---
Also, looking for totems isn't a counter to ruin. Same as "just cleanse a the totems" isn't a counter to noed. This just makes it a two-objective game. Instead of do gens and get out, it becomes do gens, find and cleanse all totems and get out. 
---
Whatever, my point is please can we get some variety?
---
Dedicated servers can't come soon enough, that was more of a lag problem than a hit box one
---
Nah I do get salty a the heat of the moment but I understand your using something that was given to you (except old DS screw that )
---
Whats ur gt?
---
It's really every 2-3 years, 4-5 if you don't buy into a lot of the 'pretty' but incredibly unoptimized games like ubisoft type stuff.
---
someone did this on console? wtf
---
This is tight
---
I agree survivors have been getting nerfed while NOED, Rancor, and ruin haven‚Äôt been touched (even buffed in some cases) I don‚Äôt have a problem with ruin but it did not need a buff imo and we seriously need to talk ab noed now that op survivor perks have been gutted
---
Oh my jesus fodling nun, i just noticed your name, i feel stupid for giving you the time of day.
---
Dude that looks amazing well done!
---
I know, but I'm pointing out that there's almost no particular good connection in dbd to begin with lol, I'm agreeing with you
---
Theres no directx 11 for VMs soo.. you cant play it on a VM
---
Lithe is more like enduring, using your environment and playing with it. I can see mettle of man being compared to NOED but thats it. 
---
NOED needs to be removed/ heavily nerfed
---
&gt; that there isn't really a good way to destroy all the totems when playing solo.
---
That is the total point. I can't believe that people don't understand this, but NOED not being destroyed 100 percent of the time is totally intended. And having to depend on teammates who may or may not do what you want is intended. A totem counter on small game is a fine idea tho
---
Same to you, fucker
---
If your mouse or keyboard supports it, you can use a macro. Don't download a third party macro software though as that may get you banned.
---
&gt; Cleansing totems doesnt do anything for survivors,
---
It prevents NOED
---
What kind of Bubba can camp and not get any kills? It's Bubba. He's practically guaranteed at least one.
---
I just gave them my warning seeing as your tone is very dismissive in the comments below, almost making you sound like a know-ti-all that just refuses their words to be challenged in any way. A good example being @BoundByTheEntity, the line "survivors mains are exhausting" just paints you as a troubled killer main, not someone that cares for anything said to them.
---
Its available on the official merch store
---
You know what would fix a lot of this? ....add fucking voice chat for solo survivors.  It‚Äôs stupid that swf groups get a HUGE advantage and play the same game as solo survivors.  They keep nerfing survivors, so solos are fed up and just say fuck I‚Äôm DCing.  And I don‚Äôt blame them not one bit.  It‚Äôs insane to me that there is one game mode yet if you play with your buds you have the biggest advantage of them all....communication.
---
So we are just going to ignore how she was mentally broken? Was leatherface thrown into a pit of needles?
---
&gt; NOED needs to be removed/ heavily nerfed
---
This is never going to happen thank god. And you fuckers don't even try to do totems so stop fucking bitching It's your own goddamn fault
---
This makes no sense. It should be the other way around, because most obsession perks for killer allow you to kill your obsession at some point in time during the match.
---
Good thing this person was using it ironically.
---
Y'know, 95% of the time, if someone is your obsession and you aren't using any obsession perks, it's because they have Decisive Strike
---
Which at this point is literally designed as an anti-tunnel perk 
---
So, y'know...
---
*Tier 3 sound*
---
Spirit, higher skill ceiling as well as some good perks like haunted grounds and spirit fury, heck even rancor can be good
---
I see that you have no interest in actually addressing my points and would rather tone police. Duly noted.
---
Ill keep bitching about it and saying its a dogshit perk but to be honest ive accepted its just a bullshit part of the game
---
Its not lag. Im on a constant 13 ping. Even if it was lag, it would of been delayed, it wasen't
---
Reasons killers facecamp are either out of shear frustration when they couldn't end a chase fast, or either when they lack confidence about their capacity to down another surv.
---
Also sometimes they just want to be a dick/troll.
---
To be fair, if i ever go against bad killers, i take the time to practice hitting my greats, which means i might miss a few.
---
I‚Äôve gone from playing killer exclusively to survivor 99% of the time. Gens pop extremely fast, survivors are cheeky assholes that swarm like bees, and a single hook means nothing. Where are all the salty survivors that DC upon the first hit whenever *I‚Äôm* playing killer? It feels bad, man.
---
So I found another brand. How do you get it to sync with the xbox?
---
Same for SWF.
---
Yeah but that doesnt give the survivors anything, it just stops NOED (and thats if the killer runs it) which any decent killer doesnt run. 
---
Each totem should give the surviors a buff or remove a debuff
---
Really? That's great indeed, the game needs a better and healthier representation. I have no I'll feelings towards him but I think he has a lot of issues he has to work on
---
Given proper set up time, I bet Amanda could make every other kill themselves or each other.
---
They dont sync. Mine are pretty much plug and play. Plug into outlet. Use remote to set whatever color you like.
---
Yeah this meme is out of date friendo.  I mean before the decisive rework I could maybe see this (I still don't see the logic in even that) but I could at least appreciate how annoying the perk used to be but now?  Decisive only works against babykillers the way it functions now.  The only time I will ever agree with a killer tunneling an obsession is if they're running Dying Light or Remember Me.  That at least makes sense.
---
No one does that, unless they have money spilling out of their ears.
---
Far as I'm concerned teabagging is a mind game. Along with flashlights, its a pretty good way to trigger the killer and increases the odds that they're going to tunnel. Keeps the killer busy and gives the rest of the team time to jerk off in corners, or whatever survivors do.
---
If it's bothering you it's fulfilling its purpose.
---
Ahhh. Rip.
---
I mean....she had already done bad things to into the scenario that threw her into said pit of needles.
---
She was also already working for Jigsaw then too.
---
Leatherface is just a mentally challenged man whose family is taking advantage of his strength and mental capacity to carry out their sick desires.  
---
Throw him into a different family at birth he'd probably just be a functioning citizen of society?
---
People derank on purpose?????
---
He's different when we're alone.
---
(Ignore the other reply that was towards something else)
---
The in game ping reader is somewhat inaccurate, if you get exhaustion and it still hurt you with dead hard for example, it's because on the killers side, it looked right because he has ~0 ping
---
How about,if you are both using a obsession perk you can't complain about getting tunneled?
---
This is the funniest fucking thing I‚Äôve seen in a while. The killers voice was great.
---
Its not the game, I have an app to detect my wifi speed, ping. Download speed ect.
---
&gt; Survivors who don't hide from the killer must be punished
---
Wouldn't you rather get to a new game faster instead of playing hide and seek with some immersed survivors?
---
Playing Killer, you get a lot of hate. lol
---
Yeah I know. Too much time for me. I'd love to have a nice PC set up though.
---
"Easily" is an exaggeration at best. 80 seconds to do a gen. 5 gens = 400 seconds = 2 1/4 minutes per survivor for 3 survivors *before accounting for great skill check progression/toolboxes*. 2 minutes from first hook to death, not taking into account the time it takes to catch and down, or the fact that the killer typically spawns across the map from survivors. You camp first hook, game's over if survivors aren't stupid.
---
Also worthy of note, camping someone to death = 1 hook event and 1 sacrifice = some small amount of devout + malicious points, meanwhile your gatekeeper emblem is fucked, and your chaser emblem is fucked, with however little points you got for 1 chase being taken by camper penalty. You can depip on a 4k right now, the idea of camping someone to death, even two people, and getting even a safe pip is not even a little bit feasible.
---
tl;dr: camping is not only not bullshit, it's incredibly bad. If a killer's camping, get on gens and collect your free win. If you hate such a terrible strategy THAT much, run kindred or similar perks that dick on camping even harder.
---
&gt; Randomizer rolls Bamboozle + That's My Horse
---
Again, that's not really my problem. 
---
Get on a gen, while they heal
---
Me personally, I let people heal me, unless they're annoying about it
---
Seems like you are not taking your advice to heart here. Tbh everyone in this post should stop, but hey do what makes you happy.
---
Three Shoe Beating is OP but this is way too high effort for this level of shitposting
---
10/10 i love you
---
Ive heard they are changing her addons fingers crossed.
---
Base nurse is okay, you cant change it without nerfing her to shit
---
In a perfect world it'd be sick, people talking in hushed whispers so the killer doesn't hear, but in reality it'd be dudes triggered because a meghead has their fan running and it got them caught.
---
His weapon better be the giant fish he used to beat Eddys ass in that one episode
---
That's fucking awesome. I hope one day I could make something like this.
---
Relax there tard.
---
I really like the idea but the effort put in creating the product is sadly minimal.
---
first of all, the pose.
---
It looks like they just pasted in a random picture ( actually think it‚Äôs the one they released a year ago as a teaser, correct me if i‚Äôm wrong) whereas all good body pillows include tempting, seductive mannerism
---
Second of all, the background, or better said, the lack of it. I‚Äôm sorry, but it‚Äôs the ultimate dealbreaker for me. Not only is the character himself not alluring, but the absence of any form of duvet or pillow that he‚Äôd be lying on is deeply tragic. Destroys any form of fantasy you could‚Äôve maybe had in your head when you close an eye on the fact that your object of affection is a motionless mannequin.
---
I really tried to get myself to like it, but this bodypillow is unfortunately not jeffree star approved.
---
ohh I gotcha. I just don't like people camping for a kill.
---
Oh, of course.
---
i cant run prayer beads without a DC. i stopped using it bc most of time someone gets abandoned so i feel bad for the last one and end up farming.
---
Everybody has bad games. Michael especially suffers with gaining momentum on Haddonfield, take it from a Myers main. It‚Äôs not uncommon for a gen or two to pop before you can even get out of Tier 1. Camping/tunneling is scummy in early/mid game but when the doors are open? Nah man. He had every right to secure his kill.
---
Holy shit that's cool
---
Where is the perk pharmacy? I have gotten Claudette to level 29 and I don't see that perk I can use yet. Thx
---
Well I don't know what the front is but that's just tally marks on the back. Not something that directly relates to DBD.
---
i run plunderers on all survivors when i just start using them so they can get some good items while they‚Äôre still at low levels. once theyre higher and i have more items on them i switch it up.
---
This turned out great!
---
Lol that is incredible, Great job!
---
Amanda is a nobody compared to our baby boy.
---
Addons would be an okay change. I believe she can be changed without being nerfed to shit. She can teleport immediately after stun. Make it so she has to wait 3 seconds or so before doing it again.
---
The way I understood it is that they were taken from their own time and have been stuck there since. Not that present entity is just picking up random people.
---
You are right (I just have a grudge against old ds it's the reson I quit dbd for over 5 months and you can't say it's was not a stupid perk but again it's a perk it's not BM I agree)
---
Fr lol.
---
Just wait until you see Edd's!
---
Same in Yamaoka. For a while it was bugged and Hex totems only spawned in Killer shack. Now they just spawn the 90% of the time.
---
&gt;like newly discovered Swag_Dracula, who genuinely has a good attitude
---
I matched up against Swag_Dracula a while back while I was learning still learning nurse. After the game, he tried to call me out for playing a 'broken, skill-less killer' (though I guess he was half right) and acted really condescending the whole time. Maybe he was just having a bad night or something, but I've never tuned in to one of his streams because of that. Has he gotten any better?
---
You got it! Work at it little by little.
---
I don't get it
---
You can say in the chat that you have that perk and if they are smart they won't waste a slot. They don't stack
---
Amanda is only precious because of the pallet stun noise. Lets be honest here.
---
Needs more bulk.
---
Oh my god, that‚Äôs awful
---
&gt;the right to camp
---
The entitlement is real.
---
It'll take more than 60 seconds to synergies perks on console lmao
---
How many people cream themselves to leatherface's stun sound hmmm?
---
It‚Äôs hilarious watching him play insidious NOED leatherface baby tums during those streams tho. Takes his infinite anger out on the poor survivors
---
I think you did a pretty good job so far. ;)
---
Nah I like Amanda as a whole, the stun sound is just icing on the cake
---
Tto be fair you dont balance around the people not playing optimally. You balance around those who are doing the best.
---
Besides that solo only feels impossibly hard because you have teammates which can screw you over. Even a group of good solo players will be able to win without much issue most of the time.
---
Problem being most survivor players dont take the game seriously enough to get better because playing survivor isnt hard enough to want to get better beyond a certain point.
---
Spirit has a timer, why not Nurse?
---
So now its subjective. Gotcha.
---
Nicee. I bought this LED light strips + light bulb combo similar to that and I loved the way it looked so much I decked my whole place out in them. My place is *filled* with LED lights. When I play dbd I turn them all on red and it gets red as *fuck*. I went a bit overboard lol
---
Nice! Can't wait to see them :)
---
Its pretty comedic tbh.
---
Nice!
---
Yah if there is 1 left and the rest DC I let them live, unless they wanna be toxic and flashlight blind me to death! Then it‚Äôs the hook for them!
---
The whole thing is subjective....
---
I think its cool that an immersed DbD player could forge a connection between the two games...but I don't think it's intentional on the part of the Fortnite designers.     
---
Whereas DbD focuses on a lone "5" tally, Fortnite's always trying to stay within the lines of being kid friendly and I think this one is meant to be a subtle call to a long tally of how many people the scary bunny has killed.
---
NOED is never getting nerfed. Devs have already said that there is enough counterplay. It also serves a purpose for the game. It gives survivors another objective to do, which slows down the progress for generators. I don't mind dealing with it on most killers, but it's pretty disgusting on Nurse and Spirit, who are already top tier.
---
I had the giant problem yesterday on my PS4 for 2 games. And the wiggle thing pops up every few games. Now I can say this about the game I‚Äôve been able to find games super fast!
---
False. Bubba is our baby boy. No ifs, ands or buts.
---
Honestly though, Rolf's ability kinda clashes with Three Shoe Beating. Also someone said it was OP; maybe the hit survivor is healed back to Healthy if Rolf doesn't hit them in the allotted time?
---
Because the game **needs** tunneling perks.
---
Also Life Has Many Doors could be reworked from an endgame only perk into something more useful. Like, if Rolf opens a locker he sees inside all lockers within a large radius for a couple seconds?

I'm not in this group, making it subjective
---
lol
---
This One Sparks Joy!
---
This is absolutely hilarious I laughed so hard
---
This one poor soul had two of their teammates DC after I obliterated them with hatchets from a pretty long distance, and then I killed her other teammate before the first generator even finished and then I went and found her and she freaked the fuck out and started spazzing moving her head in every direction and spinning and shit so I just whacked the generator and shook my head up and down and gave her the generators while I searched for the hatch, then I downed her, brought her to it, let her go in, caught her to give her a scare, then put her back down and walked away and threw a hatchet at it saying it was okay to go. That poor poor soul though man
---
In the video, at roughly 30 seconds, there is only one survivor left. Thats how killer caused the hatch closing that triggered the end-game. I doubt you can just go open a door as the killer whenever.
---
It's a teachable from Quentin it's not that important you can use well live forever (a teachable from David king )or empathy. 
---
No problem.
---
As in the human race.
---
Yes! BINGO! It isn't an unfair request and it would make game play against her significantly better.
---
They should instead of a suspension. But BHVR has kid gloves when it comes to this. They are that soft killer that lets everyone go...
---
I mean...she has fatigue time.
---
No. Look at ~36 second mark. 4 survivors left, 4 gens left, collapse begins. I made the comment when I thought that you could cause the collapse whenever due to that part of the vid but I am aware now that you cannot cause the collapse whenever, only when the gens are powered/by closing hatch
---
Guess I'm not human
---
Yeah I don't blame you(I hated old ds too,it was ridiculous and noed is annoying af as well) but at the end of the day they're perks that people (well, mostly) use to win rather than anger the opposition
---
Shit we have the same exact tv and sound bar combo lol, what wall mount did you use? Looks bad ass btw.
---
I so wish they would do this! I would love to hear people screaming ass they are drug to the basement!
---
You take into account pure gen time. Going from one to the other, if the person is hooked nearby a gen that is worked on, the fact that everyone takes a shot at saving, if the survivor were not on gens right away and the fact that Noed will 100% come into play because you aren't going to cleanse when you only got 2 minutes to GTFO, and that you will need to open gates as well. All the things you didn't consider. You also didn't consider the killer will have that 1 (in my example 2) kill for literally AFKing all game. Ironically this hurts killer gameplay because if the devs see two kills they see balance.
---
Tldr: even if the survivors do the required tactic the killer will be able to get two and even if for some reason they don't the survivors who made it barely got 10k points meaning you lose no matter what.
---
What I'm really disappointed the fact that this pillow doesn't have bearded David, *that's it*
---
Oni wall mount I believe. 50 inch to 80 inch TV.
---
How exactly would you nerf Nurse without making her Garbo. A timer between her blink bursts would mean her base MS or fatigue time would need to be tuned to compensate. Giving her one blink would mean that her fatigue time would need changed quite a bit. 
---
Nerfing Nurse is not an easy task bc her power isn't in numbers, it's in mechanics.
---
I believe you‚Äôve missed the point. Nobody has ever stated that camping won‚Äôt net you kills. People get mad about it because it‚Äôs a game people play to have fun, and camping removes the fun. Why am I playing this game if I‚Äôm going to have a killer sit on my face/play generator simulator? Camping is scummy and unfun, regardless of whether or not it works against non-comm teams.
---
Thats a different issue. I dont know if this happens to killers too, but in like 1/4 games the game will freeze in the loading screen :/
---
Shit nice! I was actually looking at that one at Wal Mart by my house the other day lol I‚Äôm just not sure I could pull it off the way my living room is set up but man your set up looks nice, pretty good job so far.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs right.  
---
In return, Trapper picks on Frank and gives candy to Huntress.
---
I have it take a while to load ( as killer) and when we load in there's only 3 survivors
---
Oh god this reminds me of the old Socom days with proximity mics! Some guys mom got him killed! She came in and said this super loud ‚ÄúHEY HONEY WOULD YOU LIKE A SANDWICH‚Äù we heard that coming from a cave that had a hiding spot where he was, gunshots ensued and he was dead. Us three remaining danced and teabagged on top of his lifeless body!
---
The guy banned me because I said that he doesn't respect his fans. Instead of trying to correct me and change my point of view, he just banned me, honestly, it just confirmed my opinion.
---
Flair checks out
---
I like this post a lot!
---
This is pretty possible, you know how killer's attributes have Tall for literally tall killers Trapper/Plague etc. on their Character Info. Meanwhile the supposedly shortest killer is Pig/Legion, BUT apparently their attributes says Average, are we going to have a shorter killer in the future? Shower thoughts.
---
I disagree, I think it's clear as day how to rework her. Give her movespeed, give her a cooldown after she blinks and there you go. Wouldn't have to change her addons or number of blinks she has this way. Now you can't just blink across the map instantly and down everyone before the first generator is done.
---
Same, although i don't blame em... sort of... If it's a 3v1 it's still doable, at least 1 escape via normal gameplay. 2v1 or 1v1 though, i just give up as survivor and go find the killer.
---
Dwight is a total snitch
---
Really? Well usually get scared run from gen get moried.
---
I've been a viewer since his Friday the 13th days. I always avoid BBB because of exactly this. He's ok to watch during the morning streams but BBB absolutely forget it. 
---
A lot of viewers are also getting drunk at the same time he is on BBB so there's that. For people who don't drink it's just a fucking cringe fest.  
---
I've reported him several times for being shit faced drunk on stream and nothing has ever come of it.  Maybe more people need to. 
---
He's been in trouble with twitch already and on probation for going on one of his drunk rants at someone.
---
This is so sad, entity play Despacito
---
It would look awesome if it adapted to events in-game, completing a generator turns it yellow for a couple seconds, as the killer gets closer the deeper the shade of red it gets
---
&gt;Fuckin Dead 'ard
---
Gets me everytime ü§£
---
Lmao. Survivor‚Äôs job is to keep the chase as long as possible. Perks help in that. Killer‚Äôs job is to get a 4k and noed only helps in that after you‚Äôve already let the gens get done. You could use an another perk that helps you during the game but by using noed you‚Äôre assuming you won‚Äôt get the 4k before the gens have been done.
---
Why? Because killers are only allowed to use obsession perks?.
---
The devs say getting two kills is a ‚Äúwin‚Äù for the Killer. The Killer not getting a 4K before all 5 Gens are powered up doesn‚Äôt mean he failed at his job. The game isn‚Äôt over yet and I highly doubt anyone who plays Killer at a high level against good Survivors is consistently getting 4k‚Äôs before 5 gens pop. According to the devs, letting 3+ more Survivors escape means the Killer failed, not if 5 Gens popped. NOED doesn‚Äôt reward the Killer for failing. Though I do agree it does feel cheap as Survivor when a Killer who got shit on all game gets 1 easy kill because of NOED
---
Lmao the narc crew feels so accurate
---
Who knows. They had a system to detect people who did the P3 glitch a couple months back but I didn't hear of one person getting banned for it.
---
I almost got Michaels on Ormond after murdering everyone at Tier 1 but I only got silver chase with everything else Iridescent so I didn‚Äôt double.
---
*Fookin
---
This is horrible for the reasons u/Operation0919 mentioned
---
oh ok ty!
---
Salty.
---
But the killer hasn‚Äôt lost yet. They haven‚Äôt lost until the end game menu comes up
---
I will complain about this forever, until it changes but for the love of god stop cleansing against Plague. HOLY SHIT. No one in my games ever play against her that way. It's always insta-cleanse. Anytime I see a plague I just sigh. I love playing against her but I know my team mates most likely will make it harder than it has to be.
---
It's not like rank does mean much in dbd tho.
---
I think it's better to have a distinction between the two. Clearly the hitbox was in a different spot for the survivor and killer due to lag, but if we call all lag related hits a hitbox problem, then what do we call actual hitbox problems. I usually only call it a hitbox problem when there is something blocking you after the visual model has clearly ended, or when the killer, who's hosting, sees the swing fall short and the survivor still gets hit.
---
&gt;console
---
How long does it take to get into a game?
---
Yes I'm only taking into account pure gen time, but in most cases against non-pepega survivors, the time it takes for survivors to switch gens is WAY shorter than the time to find and down one person. Not to mention camping means you're leaving every pallet on the map that doesn't get used in the first chase.
---
Against pepega survivors, sure, but that's why when you're in the dumpster ranks as a survivor and you want to rank up, you don't try and save your teammates unless it's free because chances are your teammates are useless.
---
Lol, everything that I tried to explain to you went entirely over your head. You aren't worth my time.
---
Just saw that one on the apex sub reddit. Pretty set-up.
---
#In Russia pallet hit you
---
 theres a few myer mains on ps4 that facecamp you everytime. Just to be an asshole.
---
I started playing killer again for the first time in nearly 6 months last week and yesterday I got matched against the MOST toxic team of SWFs I‚Äôve ever went against and they all messaged me insulting me as a human being because I didn‚Äôt kill any of them. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt ever want them as teammates as a survivor, and I pray for any killers who are rusty who have to put up with their shit. 
---
Ps- Huntress is great, gotta love using her
---
I have, and I love running invisible walls wasting her time ü§ß
---
There was a stream recently with Puppers, No0b, Tofu(I think), and Monto where they were playing a drinking game together.
---
Everyone has since asked when they will do the next one and they all have been strong and put it off for much later. They all realize it will get old and be harmful if they do it too often. But they are kind of standing in solidarity, and Pug seems to mostly be solo, so I can understand the pressure to keep doing drunk streams.
---
I don't really care for Pug's stream, but I hate to see addiction take hold in anyone.
---
Lmao, quality use of that synth, larfed üëå
---
It is on Hag to set all her traps.

Doesn‚Äôt decisive make someone else the obsession until it triggers though?

If they were using a 3rd party app to lower their rank yes

indeed

Haha nope I'm good.
---
I think Feng has a possibility, considering her backstory.
---
I knew micheal was a cat all along! I just knew it
---
*Michael Meowers*
---
I‚Äôm just saying it takes a special kind of person to wait ten minutes to teabag a stranger. I just head to the basement and start doing other stuff until they leave, it‚Äôs entirely their choice on how much time is wasted.
---
Because shirtless David King
---
Excuse me good sir but I would like you to give me a list of all the killers that "DEMAND" perks.
---
Yep, they have to finish the gens. Just to be clear, some people (including me) were confused because in the video the endgame started with 4 gens still to be done, but a dev replied that it was only for demonstration.
---
Stopping the gens being powered is the killers main goal and to killl the survivors, survivor is to power the gens and escape. Survivors get rewarded for powering the gens with adrenaline, the killer is rewarded for the gens being powered with NOED, the survivors made a major point towards victory, the killer is rewarded for the survivors success. 
---
This is the difference.
---
Yeah, it's already hardenough to get the achievment when everyone leaves
---
Not really, people wear condoms to prevent mistakes. Noed is a mistake.
---
The survivors are a team, they have a shared goal in a game to power the gens.
---
At least it isn't another insidious leatherface...
---
Well I cleanse totems. Because noed pisses me off more than anything, such a stupid ass perk that rewards bad killers. 
---
Stupid killer mains like to compare sb,lithe,adrenaline, dH, and bl to noed is completely asisine.  Those things help get a little distance between killer and survivor considering killers are faster. So no matter what you will catch up not to mention bloodlust.. 
---
Mom just came out and all killermains are doing is complaing about it suck it up buttercup. Do I need to mention bbq, nurses, dyinglight, ebony moris, all the killers ultrarare addons ?? 
---
Come up with a better argument.
---
*Michael cries*
---
&gt;Will keys work on the hatch after it has been closed by the killer?
---
yes the keys can still be used to open them.
---
 I was thinking "that set up looks great, I could probably do something like that as well. But that tv looks really good, its probably expensive but it looks like it's worth it. Way better than my tcl tv." Then I zoomed in on the brand you have....haha
---
thank's for your comment.
---
Yeah it does and I cringe at survivors doing it, but as a killer i just hit them out, move onto the next game
---
I swear I had pants on a moment ago
---
Do note that if EAC detects them as changed files, the devs won't unban you. They've stated quite often that they don't go looking for aesthetic changes, but they're not going to help people that get banned for them.
---
I‚Äôm more spiteful about it but I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. It cheers me up after to have the last dude send me shit insulting me for not hitting him after they wasted their own time though.
---
Feng has smoked a lot of weed.
---
oh ok :(
---
Hahaha
---
I think we‚Äôre disagreeing over what these perks do for players. Lithe and Adrenaline are clearly very strong, and it makes it easier for Survs to evade the Killer. But they don‚Äôt change much about your goal as a Surv. You still want to evade the Killer, repair gens, help teammates, and escape. You could make the case that any good perk makes you worse at Surv or Killer, but I don‚Äôt think NOED is a problem because it‚Äôs strong. I think it‚Äôs a problem because it rewards Killers who use otherwise weak strategies that should rightfully lead to them being beaten by the Survs. 
---
Killers are punished for camping and tunneling by reducing pressure on other Survs, allowing them to repair the gens and leave. But NOED mitigates that. I don‚Äôt think that NOED prevents Killers from improving, but I do think it rewards some Killers for poor play.
---
im pretty sure most people know of the combo. just most either dont have both or dont want to play with those perks
---
yeah when you put it like that, it really is a fucking terrible idea. thank you!
---
His eyebrow twitch. His left eyebrow goes up and down seemingly of its own accord at least 100000 times a stream. Annoys the fuck out of me.
---
Im laughing so fucking hard right now lol i read all of this in pandas voice
---
I dunno I have had similar experiences on PC. I think it's more of a symptom of the game than it is a platform thing.
---
thank you
---
Real stone behind tv?
---
nurse cant play without her ability spirit can. a blink timer or refill would make her shit.
---
What a badass
---
But why not? If i had more money to throw around id yeet this at my friend
---
Not really, not doing totems is the mistake. I‚Äôm not even a killer main I‚Äôve had many games recently where I find 2 totems in the first 3 minutes. You get more points for doing them than a safe unhook. But hey seems like everyone (survivors and killers) likes to complain about everything
---
Ok, I now wish to throw this at people
---
I feel you bro. The worst is when I try to introduce a new player to the game, many killers try to repeatedly tunnel them off the hook. Naturally I release my final form and go into turbo shirtless overdrive. Flashlight + long life battery + low amp filament = You ain't never putting that guy back on the hook without dealing with me first. Such is the law of the Shirtless David King. I'm not about being toxic or bullying lower rank killers, but I'm also not about to stand by and watch a new player get tunneling into never touching the game again.  
---
This problem plagues the low-mid ranks because survivors are overly altruistic there, and don't play optimally enough to punish the killers.
---
I saw it on YouTube first, great funny video!
---
Finally someone said it out loud. Hes extremely disrespectful. I randomly watch it to see if hes still being mean to his viewers and it never fails he is.  I think it's crazy to expect people to pay you for sitting on your ass and playing a video game... he needs a lesson on being humble because hes a complete douche bag. I got banned several months ago because I asked if he was gonna play killer or just afk on gens the whole stream...  so of course his brainless mods post pug does what he wants and started attacking me. So I told them to suck a dick. Insta ban, said that was to much sass.. coming from that dbag?? Lmaooooo 
---
They need to ban his account for a month or so... he needs a break and need to go out in the real world and function. Because hes big and bad behind his computer screen. Bet he wouldn't talk shit like that to somones face.
---
I‚Äôll see you at twitch con mate. Excited.
---
It would also help if there were more benefits to chasing a seperate guy rather than just "pips"
---
Most players would look at an injured 2 hook guy and see somebody who can be taken out of the game fast and make the game easier since theres less survivors. I dont know many people who can safely chase the guy who hasn't been hooked and is at full health without straight up losing because the one who is on death hook is likely the one who isnt as strong at looping and the guy who has never been hooked is a god.
---
As it stands if you find both players at the same time it's just good play to chase after the weakened one. And not all killers can reliably run make your choice to make it a more even decision.
---
I did exactly what you did! I used NOED a bunch early because it‚Äôs so good at getting kills, but I stopped and it helped me understand many Killers better. NOED let me get 2ks and 3ks without regard for the Killer‚Äôs power.
---
I think the passion people have over this game is good, but I don‚Äôt think this needs to be made into a Killer vs Surv issue.

You don't get bullied with these add-ons if you have more than 2 brain cells. Prayer Beads + Mother Daughter Ring are the only thing in this game that can be even more broken than a Omega Blink Nurse, especially on maps like The Game or Lery's. And don't say me Spine Chill because almost nobody uses Spine Chill anymore and you can phase backwards for Spine Chill to not activate before you are right on top of them.
---
I love this picture
---
What is wrong with that combo? Do you think it is unfair?
---
You think we can reopen the hatch with keys
---
I feel like he‚Äôs getting away with it because we already have a punching bag named Ochido. Pug looks like an Angel beside Ochido.
---
That being said, Pug is so full of himself and lacks any sense of modesty and humbleness. I got timed out in his chat once for the most stupid reason. Someone else in chat criticized him for something I can‚Äôt remember right now and he replied with something along the lines of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just jealous that I make a living out of playing video games. Something all of you would want to‚Äù. So that kinda rubbed me the wrong way a little so I typed in chat that not everyone thinks playing video games for a living is a goal for them and some people want to directly help society. He then says I‚Äôm lying and no one thinks like that. All of his braindead supporters also started harrassing me. He then timed me out ‚Äúto protect me from the harrassment‚Äù wtf yeah right lmao
---
Also he‚Äôs really toxic. He farms teammates constantly. He also is known for his insidious leatherface for the ‚Äúmemes‚Äù. Yeah it‚Äôs funny the first time or two but it gets really old and annoying.
---
I had never pity console players as much as I do now. Looks like a mess.

To be fair, good luck ever actually loading into a four man game if you run a concealed offering. There's also a distinct correlation between the letters TTV in one's steam username and disconnecting under those circumstances.
---
If that's the case then shouldn't the streamers be sharing the profits from a match with the other players helping them to create content and entertainment for that round? There wouldn't be a stream without 4 other players in that lobby, so why don't they show appreciation to those players? I mean, that's basically my whole reason for lobby dodging streamers now: I'm not helping someone else work without my own compensation.
---
But that also seems to be way worse now come to think of it.

pretty overused meme so far

Rubber man would be cool but what about Charles Montgomery or maybe Infantata? I feel like they would fit a little better

Nothing will change

Its gonna be hate mail saying end game is a crutch for bad killers lol

While it's their fault since they teabagged for 3 min

wait until the mid Chapter. Should fix all DC/crash related problems
---
Yup the guy is a total dick head I stopped watching him like a month ago. Puppers is the one for me and monto is my favorite DBD YouTuber. I like tru as well but I can never understand what he says when someone subs to him. All I get it blah blah blah blah thank you for the opportunity.

Are you kidding?

It not

People who have previously been banned, even temporarily, can‚Äôt be fog whisperers. You can see all current fog whisperers [here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49385/fog-whisperers-program-launch); his name isn‚Äôt on the list.
---
That‚Äôd be great XD 
---
Hope so
---
Dude that helps a lot. Very awesome and I get this 'Final Destination' vibe.
---
yep, hatch always opens when only 1 Survivor is alive, no matter the gens and 1,2,3 Person Games will always get cancelled without losing anything
---
Alternatively, you could try to sneak past the killer instead of running into them head-on.
---
Is the ring better than the amulet? I still have around 50 prayer beads from xmas but only 21 amulets. I got like 40 rings tho.
---
Squee!! Kawaii!!
---
I mean you slow vaulted that. Assuming you had around 100 ping it was a standard hit for the killer
---
I guarantee you LF in the clip wouldnt hit him if he just bothered to fast vault this
---
The two best killers to start as are the wrath and the doctor (yes doctor is  hard to master but he is easy to pick up) try them yes they are a bit on the weaker side but I believe they will help you learn good luck.
---
In front of the wall.
---
Like I said
---
&gt;if you want to break a hook, do it somewhere else

Thanks fam. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people say to try wraith so I‚Äôll pick him up

I look at it like tipping. If you have good service at a restaurant, bar, hair salon, tattoo parlor, what-have-you, then tipping shows your support and appreciation. If you don't feel like the content is particularly extraordinary, no need to tip/sub/donate. But if you love what they're doing, have at it. There are a lot of streams I follow for free. A few I sub to. And a couple I mega-sub to because I love the content and I enjoy the streamer as a kind, thoughtful person on top of it, and see how much effort and heart they put into it.
---
nice
---
Im guessing they experimented with that but it was too broken to make a reality
---
Nice LED strips, I have the same thing but those bricks behind it looks pretty nice.
---
All that work and you get a TCL?
---
I totally agree. Today alone i have been gen rushed even with ruin and i finished chases within 15 seconds almost every time. It is really annoying to play killer, and it totally makes sense why it takes forever to get into a survivor game.
---
How is flashlight garbage lol, a tool that if used well can make the killer drop a surv and can be used to lose the killer if blinded on pallets while running no sound perk.
---
I had to look it up once. He actually says "You get/keep the cap emotes and linkage, welcome to the Tru3munity." But all in all, you got it way closer than I ever did, lol.
---
I was bored the other day so I tried my level one nurse and I had about the same experience as you - the most toxic flashlight and teabagging and bodyblocking SWF team I‚Äôve ever played against I just could not believe how horrible these people were as human beings. It was SO obvious I was new and they were just disgusting all around. I was just trying to figure out how to teleport because I hadnt played nurse before.
---
Normal killer that can teleport....ok....
---
Dead by daylight isn‚Äôt an advanced game sadly, we probably won‚Äôt ever get that but we can believe
---
So basically, what you're saying is, pretty good job so far whoever worked on the MoM Coding?
---
But it would explain a lot. I know Nurse Blinks, Spirit Phasewalks, and... something else wasn't working on PTB. And I know they fixed two of them. But I had sort of just accepted it when it didn't work, right up until the Infectious Fright Nurse. Thanks friendo!
---
There's already a cooldown after blinking bud
---
r/humblebrag
---
But then everyone is one hit anyway, you just dont use the corrupt purge that game.
---
Spinechill and Urban should be your two staple perks. Probably Quick and Quiet as well.
---
In front of the wall but behind your tv?
---
5 second fatigue. Whats the point. Longer and longer fatigues until she's useless. Changes nothing because teleports are instant
---
IKR, they get hit through a pallet or a BS hit box, but it‚Äôs your first hook why would you DC
---
 Very thankful for this. I hate having a useless perk just because its broken.
---
I could not stop smiling during the Leatherface chase set to "Call to post".
---
I've often enough had hits register mid-air on me (and survivors I played against) after fast-vaulting windows.
---
What adds to my suspicion that this is not merely caused by the latency advantage is that ever since 2.5.0, there are those "double-flop" post-window-vault hits, where the model falls over twice, as if re-syncing with the hitbox. This does not happen with server-side events, since it never corrects your model for latency elsewhere. So I suspect it is only happening because it's the client-side hitbox that also stayed behind, as a function of the code, rather than of latency. These double-flops also happen on fast-vaults, so there's that, as well.
---
It's a great TV
---
Same. Anyone who stays after 2 or 3 disconnecting crybabies leave deserve 5 free gens and 13 pallet stuns. I will always be nice to someone who had to endure that
---
lol. Ok.

Yeah, I think he‚Äôs a good killer and streamer and some of the things people say about him are unfounded, but I wish he‚Äôd be a bit more open to differences in opinion. And now here come the downvotes for a very mild criticism in response to someone who asked. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Nah it was a simple bug that happened randomly
---
No mither is a hard counter to all the strongest things in the game. Can‚Äôt use noed on me if I‚Äôm already injured, instadown hatchets? Pish posh, now you only have 3 hatchets. 
---
Meta perk tbh
---
Do they really? Huh. I just assumed it was because I flashlight-saved.
---
yeah?
---
Why do that when I could just bitch about NOED being overpowered?
---
I had this happen last night.  I hadn't played in awhile so I was in the newb ranks.  Two of my teammates got hooked and I saved them a total of 3 times and each time I crouch walked my way to the to unhook and they start sprinting causing the hag to pop up and hook them again.
---
After they were gone, it was me and one teammate and I got hooked.  My teammate crouch walked to save me, I was impressed!  I crouch walk away to avoid triggering a trap and I get a few steps away from the hook when I hear the trap spring behind me.  My teammate gets downed and hooked.
---
I found the hatch.
---
&gt;change 1: The timer doesnt decay in chase: If the killer is tunneling you, you should be "allowed" to run them without being punished by losing the charge.
---
DS is now an anti tunnel perk, not a jail free card. If the killer takes so long to catch you, you probably didn't need DS to begin with. I've been using religiously using DS for the first time since the change and I think its fine. Most killers aren't very smart so you can even get chased for about 40s and go down on purpose to trigger DS. More often than not, they pick you up without thinking twice.
---
&gt;Also deliverance + DS is borderline uncounterable, in the end-game it's a free escape.
---
If someone managed to reach end game on first hook, I don't see the problem in that.
---
It‚Äôs easier to avoid her chasing normally then her corrupt purge. It‚Äôs why I think she‚Äôs just pretty ok and not great.
---
Flashlight saves isnt something to tunnel for so.. probably what the guy above said
---
It'd allow deaf people to play the game somewhat as intended. That'd be pretty cool.
---
Summon Da Bunnies
---
Always choose the easier option
---
yeah.... looking at your post history I don't think people disliked your threads/posts purely because you are a killer main... 
---
If you post dumb stuff, don't expect people not to downvote.
---
&gt;DS is now an anti tunnel perk, not a jail free card. If the killer takes so long to catch you, you probably didn't need DS to begin with
---
so "if youre good youre not allowed to have the perk" is basically what that means? Bad players deserve to get rewarded but good players dont? Seems really ass-backwards to me. 
---
&gt;If someone managed to reach end game on first hook, I don't see the problem in that. 
---
Honestly not that rare, though my biggest issue is still with 4% when you're just trynna hook slugs at the end.
---
Frame rate on ps4 is dropping again. As a killer main when I hit survivors the FR chugs so bad it can be very hard to center the camera on the survivor running away after the hit. Seriously I lost track right after 1 slap  so many times recently that it turns in to free escapes for them. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE. The only work around is to reset game after every match. Please fix. Before I get asked it is not lag its FR drops. Lag looks like warping all over. FR drops everything chops all over when you move the cam. Its so bad at times its like taking a pic on your phone but your hands holding it moves all over the place. Dedicated servers will fix lag I hope but FR drop did not happen last summer I played the game. WTH happened?

Cursed image
---
Any other work around to help fix frame rate on ps4 does any one know? Tips would be appreciated till they can fix the game. As I said resetting the game on dash helps but is annoying as hell.
---
Sorry should‚Äôve made it clear it was aimed at killers but I also like survivor stealth as I find confrontation and chases harder
---
Mettle of Man ok I can agree with. Decisive is effectively useless now. Adrenaline is not a crutch. Exhaustion perks are not crutch perks. If Self care is crutch so is Sloppy Butcher.
---
Third Seal buff, causes Blindness
---
Its allll salty survivors lol. This post has already been downvoted hahaha. Proving my point!
---
I do the one next to the generator I'm working on, but I'll only 99 it, then break if the killer finds me- or break after I finish the gen to still get the credit since the killer knows the location anyway,
---
You will always get bullied when learning a hard killer that has a learning curve. A lot of survivors are toxic and like to bully when they see you havent learned a killer very well yet
---
Adam Francis is Jamaican. That doesn't mean he's smoked weed but he's totally not a Narc. Maybe he should be in the Medical Cannabis section.
---
&gt; so "if youre good youre not allowed to have the perk" is basically what that means? Bad players deserve to get rewarded but good players dont? Seems really ass-backwards to me.
---
&gt; 
---
You are allowed to use it but the purpose of the perk is to prevent immediate tunneling, being downed and re-hooked before you had the chance to run away from the hook. Punishing the killer for catching a survivor was the problem with old DS. 
---
If you pause the timer while in chase, the killer can waste several **minutes** chasing someone for absolutely nothing because that survivor with DS will go free no matter what considering the skill check is easier and you can't even dribble anymore. Unless you choose to slug that person but at this point, after chasing someone for such a long time, the match is most likely over. 
---
I recognize your name from twitch. I wouldn't even have posted if I saw it earlier considering how you behave in said chats but, whatever. I don't think I will continue to reply much longer.

It's not your fault I woke up with poor reading comprehension.

Nice taste :)
---
Random question have you seen the recent legion patch what do you think
---
I'm aware of the "stun." The "stun" does next to nothing when you can teleport directly next to someone the moment after.
---
There's not even 10 gens on a map.
---
Why‚Äôd they do ibra dirty like this
---
Looking good!
---
why would you ever turn it on when you can just invite someone to discord or for Console just invite to party to chat?

There does need to be something to counter Voice Chat for killers.

High Laurie was a buzz kill

I think you're forgetting one important part about Adam..
---
**he's a teacher, teachers are against weed**
---
I hope not everyone takes a single text chat message so serious
---
Not fatigue, a literal cooldown on the ability so she can't just recast her teleport after being stunned.
---
Yeah I know it's tricky I just wish it was here :( tomorrow would've been perfect
---
Hahaha understandable
---
I will never be complete unless i have that outfit
---
I believe a short killer would be possible, especially with how the devs have been introducing new animations to the game. Will it be a challenge? Of course they'd have to make all the animations for a smaller killer like chucky all over from scratch but in the end it will work wonders, imagine playing against chucky in a map like coldwind farm with how high the corn plants are, chucky would be the ultimate jumpscare stealth killer, with that they could implement a higher / wider heartbeat sensor so that it'd be fair.
---
thanks brotha!
---
It does feel like there is waaay more camping on PS4 these days at pretty much every rank.
---
It sucks but at least, like you said, the killer isnt going to get as many points or kills.
---
It also seems like there are more survs who try and rescue while I'm getting camped, which always leads to a game where nothing gets done.
---
That person is a fucking joke ü§£
---
If it does happened, can't wait to easily mind game survivors with it :P
---
Although scratch marks are still a thing
---
the only change i'd like for DS is that when you're slugged, the timer stops
---

Jake actually got kicked out of school for smoking weed in his original origin story, so he know he blazes it regularly
---
Lol babykiller attempts to try hard a 2 man 5 gen game and babyrages like a toddler when they get outplayed by only 2 survivors.  Absolute trash.
---
definetly a ruse xD
---
Pretty much. Soon as I can tell a killer has BBQ I hide in the closest locker when someone is picked up. sometimes I get players who reveal me in lockers because LOL LOCKER NOOB YOU CAN'T PLAY, so I get killed cuz of it.
---
This is a good idea. Even if people get toxic you can always mute them. Hell, if it is so bad make it its own gamemode so we have classic dbd and voice chat dbd. Or even a limited time option just to test it's effects.
---
Yeah, infinite loading screens is a problem right now
---
Distressing on Spirit gives her a normal TR (barely) but as long as the survivor/gen you plan on Haunting to is in it they won‚Äôt hear the whoosh, which is what most people that play against the Spirit wait for before hiding.
---
Why even respond?
---
*hums intensify*
---
I really don't get the point of Fog Whisperers. From what I gather the only thing they get is stuff from BHVR and to see content early. If that's the case why is it advertised? The viewer doesn't get codes or extra bloodpoints for watching them. It just seems dumb that they have a special name for something that only benefits them.
---
I play alot of killer and if im being destroyed by 2 fucking survivors its because of my lack of strategy and skill.
---
Yes. My husband and I have gotten it as both killer and survivor like ten times. (Xbox)
---
These are gorgeous ty
---
Why would i even wanna be in purple or red ranks as a killer/surv smh
---
The real question is this? Does it come with a happy ending for all that?
---
I almost exclusively play killer and got most of my 26.9k from here, dunno what you're talking about desu
---
I call this the ScottJund victory.
---
Ah thanks for clarifying, i get it quite frequently though, quite annoying.
---
It's funny people have the nerve to bite the hand that feeds them. He should consider himself lucky he gets to do this as a "job".
---
"only counter to it" you basically wanted the perk's timer to stop while being in a chase
---
Could definitely be a ruse, but a pretty boring one for David. Maybe he's just the hothead of the group. Or maybe it was just a coincidence he ended up with a two-man in both games?

Wait until you‚Äôre on the swamp and literally can‚Äôt see anything.
---
At least I'm not the only sensible killer main then
---
eh, maybe she had a bad day, i can't blame her or tell her that she's bad.

I know everyone keeps saying that having one piece from head to torso is difficult, but they did it with Ash (granted he doesn't have any cosmetics that are separate head/torso, but...)
---
Honestly at this point, if the render is too difficult for the traditional cosmetic pieces, they could just make the hood into a bunny hat and the torso into a jacket. Anything that makes it possible to release. Take my money, Behaviour.

Going to work on Items and addons in the upcoming days, if you want to stay updated ill be posting it on my twitter @Velyix

Didn't Jane od and crash her car in her lore?
---
Agreed. I'm sorry but at I just want to move onto a real game instead of spending 10 minutes farming every time someone leaves, otherwise I'd never get a real game in.
---
I stopped in a couple weeks ago just to see if hes changed, and right away hes camping a guy as leather face and just bming him over and over. Like who wants to watch that? Noped outta there real quick.
---
The mindgame isnt hard,, whats good about dh is that insstead of being downed you could get to a safe pallet without the killing able to do anything winning you so much extra time.

sometimes i just straight up murder him dead because i dont want to waste time farming. I just want to... play the game.

Survivors have an entire book of made up bullshit rules they want killers to follow. Fuck them, do whatever you want, if they're bitching about it, it's because it's working.
---
The killer name should‚Äôve been ‚ÄúThe European‚Äù
---
Its really not, and at some loops it can guarantee you get a hit even with bad mindgaming, bloodlust can and often will be the deciding factor between landing a hit and a survivor making it to safety, not to mention eventually ending infinite loops

The first game in weeks, other than taking 30 mins to find a single killer with decent ping, this is the first match. Oh, dear, have I missed this game.

---
Understandable!
---
Mans name is LegionTears420 and has negative karma
---
If it looks like a troll, sounds like a troll, and walks like a troll, it probably is a troll
---
On its own its not that gr8 but running against a swf with commss who will all use adrenaline and time the last gen correctly is slightly infuriating.
---
weak, no lery or the game offering with beads.
---
How did we go from No Mither being "the worst perk" to almost everyone using it recently? Did some streamer hype it up or something? Am I missing something about this perk because, I don't see any good use with it
---
just report them, then they‚Äôll get banned
---
Didn't think my friends and I (Thing 1/Bill) would actually end up on reddit.
---
Thanks OP!
---
yeah and? Tunneling someone but being so shit it takes you a minute to down them isn't counterplay, slugging them afterwards is.
---
Yup I did it for a few killers i didn't play and got a 2 week ban. all the killers and then some got put back to lvl 1 but it didn't get everyone my bro did it for like all his survivors and didn't lose anything. We joke that its because i was the killer main and hes a survivor main that I got banned and he didn't
---
dh is great against nurses and to secure extra loops
---
Downvote, report, and move on. Giving it attention is what it wants.
---
That is a pretty good image of this Santa Clown.
---
I laughed harder then I should have
---
Like with everything good in your life?
---
Yeah but the game is not really against balance.  
---
Its not hard to reach red ranks with surv/killer if you play the right perks and know how to run tiles.
---
Got killed instantly and didn't want to wait but give me a min and I'll upload a series of screens
---
He openly advocates extremely toxic behavior. He DC's when he gets a map he doesn't like, a match up he doesn't like, a match isn't going heavily in his favor. He openly admits it and almost seems too proud to be doing it. It get's really annoying and I know there are people here that have worse experiences but I've played against him a couple times and almost every time that I would kill him he would leave and call me dumb insults like a tunneler and a camper. Kind of makes me want to go out of my way to ruin his experience whenever I have to cross this ***man-child.***
---
O I N K
---
eh, whatever, everyone with their own opinion, this is the change i'd like, that's the change you would like. anyway, DS is in a good spot rn and i don't think i'll see some changes for it very soon
---
No one knows for real, but you could still be the last survivor with only one gen left and repair it before the Killer finds the hatch.
---
It seems very situational, but it can be manipulated anyway. For example, you could be finishing the last gen while a Surv is death-hooked and wait for the sacrifice to finish before you pop it. If you do this, the hatch and the gates will be immediately available for you. No decent Killer will spend time camping the gates, so you will have time to, even if they begin to open one of the gates to force the Collapse, open one of the gates yourself and escape through it.
---
Yeah but the issue is that it isn‚Äôt annoying builds/behavior that make up the majority of DC‚Äôs. 
---
90% of the time it‚Äôs just people leaving on first down or the second they hear which killer it is, and those dc‚Äôs have definitely picked up starting when legion came out. The whole DCing against legion thing was at least sort of understandable, but it‚Äôs become too normalized and now no one can play the damn game with a disconnect.
---
"It's easier to VC on console", Steam chat literally has built-in voice comms.
---
SWF shouldn't be a problem for you in most cases unless you're having tons of bad luck and the survivors are pretty good and in that case you'd have lost anyone, even against randoms.
---
DH is garbage and will work at best once, MoM wasn't in the game until a few weeks ago, Adrenaline rewards people for actually playing the game and working on gens (unlike NOED), SC is painfully slow and you will lose the game if you're constantly taking useless hits, BT can be countered by not camping or using stealth powers/insidious and DS is worthless too unless you tunnel. Once again NOED is given to you for free, you have to do NOTHING and you don't have to be skilled either. Even if you miss a bunch of swings, it doesn't matter since it's not token based. NOED is rewarding bad killers for playing bad and not putting pressure on the survivors, simple as that, it has nothing to do with "muh survivors OP". You should be concentrating on winning a game ASAP, not planning on making it to the end game, unless you for whatever reason enjoy end game builds.
---
She is already slow blinking right after the stun makes sense.
---
I think the original lore in the PTB was that she was possibly a pill addict and crashed her car after taking one too many. But they changed it once she was released to just being tired.
---
I was actually spectating at this point. Felt bad for my buddy.
---
(That Meg here) What was cut after this was me running away from the killer after attempting to open the door and running into another trap **immediately** to the left.
---
I swear I didn't see the trap until it closed on me, totally blew me away.
---
With some players, this would be the case. With other players, you'd get the end game chat in the middle of the game over voice coms
---
Lmao I just saw that. I meant headless but screw it I'm leaving it like that
---
Oh I thought it was final I was thinking about getting the legion but not so much now
---
Killer main. I play both sides a lot but I'm play Killer more because I'm just naturally better at Killer.
---
Well if YOU didn't hear about it, then surely it didn't happen
---
I get the freezing (Like the game says not responding in task manager) WAY more often than the infinite loading screen. I haven't had an infinite loading screen in ages, but had a hard-lock on loading as killer 10 times this week. Infuriating.
---
Jesus killers are such fucking babies holy shit, I‚Äôve heard about how survivors are entitled but this shit is ridiculous.
---
Adrenaline is more than fair, it‚Äôs an investment in success. NOED is an investment in failure. 
---
Decisive is balanced now, don‚Äôt tunnel. Period.
---
Mettle of man? Fine, could be OP. 
---
Borrowed time? Strong but can be played around.
---
I agree insta heals are bullshit but so are mori‚Äôs, so I will dismiss this complaint while both players have unfair mechanics. 
---
Most of the rest of your complaints are literally just whining. Do people honestly think adrenaline out of all the perks is OP?
---
Noed still gives a speed boost tho, so run hope aswell to actually 200iq counter.
---
I got him when he came out
---
Thanks for the advice I‚Äôd love to play spirit is it any good?
---
According to the lore, survivors could always talk. It's in one of Benedict's notes "Sometimes I manage to just catch a glimpse of a poor soul as he gets carried away. Others I have actually told my name. I do not always want to know their names. It makes it harder as they hang from the hook."
---
Fuck off
---
Honestly, I don‚Äôt think anyone liked hatch standoffs. Not really a side vs side kinda deal. They were boring for everyone and people bragged about afk‚Äôing for hours just to get some points and it‚Äôs like...why? 
---
NOED and Blood Warden aren‚Äôt looking to be changed and haven‚Äôt exactly gotten better, I think only Remember Me and Left Behind were up for any adjustments for right now. Any overall, the injection of EGC really has little grand change with the flow of the game. 
---
And to say it‚Äôs a killer buff is odd. The only way I could see someone dying to the Entity is if they let it happen by just being too timid and hiding for the entire duration. And because it only triggers when the gates are open, it‚Äôs just more of a shoo out and go next. The devs even said that Amanda and her RBT need to get looked at. Where is this random killer buff coming from? If anything it just helps them get a game over with that they don‚Äôt want to play anymore without just DC and to stop those hostage situation games too.

Then what happened?
---
I‚Äôve had the game for a while I highly advise you look at the little explanation cards in the tutorial menu it‚Äôs actually really good for stuff you didn‚Äôt know like if a killer kicks a gen it slower reverts back I thought it just did set amount of damage
---
*Sans music starts playing*
---
This will be the reason why so many people stop trying after a couple matches. They need to put a natural borrowed time like mechanic on a fresh hooked survivor and actually take points away per second the killer is sitting there camping.
---
I play both sides evenly and never have i needed to camp or tunnel to have fun and have a great match.
---
Sounds good so far also make a perk that if a survivor touches a gen within the first 10 minutes of a trial all survivors are instantly sacrificed and there game uninstalls itself.

Supposedly they plan to eventually refund offerings if less than 5 players load in. Hopefully the guy who crashed also gets their offering refunded.

Fogwhisperers get codes to give out to viewers on stream, but most of them give it to their mods/subs and friends.
---
Camping for me is rage inducing. So if a toxic swf induces rage I'll camp then. I only do that if I know I'm not going to win against them because of the toxic practices so I knowingly throw the match to camp the worse one.

Same, but it almost feels like I've had an infinite loading screen 3 out of those 10 times. It's even worse because it's not even my fault. The infinite loading screen *is* something that happens regardless because it's the game's fault.

Honestly I think Tru3 understands people have a difference of opinion but I think you have to really watch the guy a lot to get how forward and blunt he can be. Like he will challenge an opinion but he genuinely wants to discuss it just to some people it seems like he is just getting annoyed someone questioned him.   
---
I feel his main issue why people give him a hard time is he gets triggered by toxic stuff (I mean genuinely toxic things that everyone agrees on) or by people saying dumb shit in chat and instead of just letting it go he will rant which then makes him seem like he complains a lot or that he disregards peoples opinion. He isn't perfect don't get me wrong no one it but compared to people like Pug he genuinely does try to be a nice guy.
---
It was found in the video that there was something called 'Late Save' or something similar to that. Speculation is that you'll get bonus or maybe even double bloodpoints during endgame, therefore encouraging survivors to work towards something during it

Stridor makes breathing louder, both normal and injured so you can still Haunt mid chase without losing them.

---
I've watched AngryPug for quite a few months now, since around the end of last year. Usually, I have him on my second monitor as I'm playing another game but goddamn.
---
He has been a total a\*\* to his viewers this past week and I've honestly just not been a fan of it. Whether it's somebody asking a simple question or somebody in the chat giving an opinion "I don't really care, I'm just saying your opinions stupid" (Was something Game of Thrones related, can't actually remember what it was). Then he goes off on a rant saying that he doesn't have to be nice to people online as there is too many trolls and compares it to Retail where how you have to be extremely nice to people and how so many twitch streamers fake that same kindness. I agree, nobody want's that mediocre GTA 5 youtuber where it's over the top, fake enthusiasm BS. But don't talk down on people who are there to watch you and hang out with you, it just isn't needed. He also went off on a guy because he did @ANGRYPUG (followed up by a message) in chat, calling him an attention seeker as it lights up the message in red when you use the @ and the name.
---
 Just his overall tone of voice and attitude towards his fans annoys me at times, maybe I'm just being picky.
---
The best counter to gen rushing
---
Yeah, I definitely remember something about pills.
---
The thing is though, the Devs tend to not give a shit about toxicity OR the actual problems in the game. They lower the sound of Plague getting her corrupted purge instead of fixing their collision masks/hitboxes and their interactions with killers for example, which actually makes or breaks survivors escaping or dying. AND they took out depipping for disconnecting. Examples of them not giving a damn about both.
---
It definitely has gotten worse. I think there was at least one DC in all of my killer games today. I just came looking for a thread like this after someone DC‚Äôd on their first down when I was playing Hag (who I don‚Äôt think gets any special degree of hate from survivors). I guess it‚Äôs some consolation that it‚Äôs not just me.

Well if memory serves me right, Candyman actually *was* an urban legend before the movie, so maybe that culture still exists. People might know the story, but not know there was a movie. Even though I'd say the movie Candyman basically upholds the urban legend, and is a probably responsible for why it's so popular. 
---
I really think people should see the movie though, it's *really* good.
---
Not a fan of Pug personally as I have never felt people who use the excuse 'I know or I am an asshole' to justify them being dicks is a good thing and usually when people do it to them they don't like it, as I have seen many people message about Pug blocking them due to comments I figure he doesn't break this mold. However I don't say anything bad about him as I don't really watch the guy but I have seen comments like this before and usually about him being drunk and 'begging' - using the term I often see. I can see how this is unappealing because like you said it is there choice to do this and it shows a lack of appreciation for the generosity shown by people that allows you to, lets face it, continue a pretty cushty career.

The Doctor has add-ons, Calm, that make his terror radius smaller in punishment mode. Really good on maps with a lot of walls like Lery's. Combine it with Monitor and Abuse and it becomes a pretty small radius.
---
Nurse blink hits not counting has been acknowledged as a bug.
---
yes please save us god

Yeah sometimes if I'm looking to derank I just spend a whole game stalking. No hits.

What's his name again?

Dio for next Killer. We *need* that road roller mori

They did a teaser trailer with a narrator just for a patch that fixes the "Get the fuck out already" problem, that's been present since release?

I am trying it now, cross your fingers
---
Here we can see a salty survivor main and ochido fanboy in his natural reddit habitat
---
Right now though he is a big fish in a small pond. He is a top streamer of DBD but even his numbers are nothing compared to the big streamers on twitch. I have seen others like Noob3 and Tru3ta1ent jump to other games and even with the 'die hard fans' they lose potentially half their viewership. It must be scary to try and jump to a different game because you could drop right down and suddenly have to consider getting a 'normal' job.   
---
It begs the question as a streamer is it better to main one game and become big and well known on it but risk burn out, or is it better to play different games often and build a viewership slower and risk not having a huge fanbase but have more freedom?
---
I like it! Doesnt seem broken but seems like it actually makes it a better perk.
---
insidious and iron grasp on a leatherface, what does it mean?
---
SHIT! Just got 4k monitors. I think that's it. Thank you!
---
Not weed. Pro gamers are on amphetamines.
---
But the ladt part is gonna make a lot of LF's cry
---
Its like they have the effort but not the know-how, sadly.
---
My issue is I'd love to get more perks and I have pretty much every Killer with the good perks but the issue is it takes SOO many bloodpoints. And that means I have to play a lot. And playing lots of Killer is actually like self-harm to me lol.
---
If I'm the only one that didn't dc. Just fuckin end it. I don't want to have to go through 2 Gens all by myself just to escape. Let me get into another lobby.
---
All of it together kinda looks like a giant poster.

Yeah, to be honest I did a lot of thinking on this and this was the best I could come up with so he didn't end up as a trapper 2.0 or a last year rip off.
---
Exactly
---
More the fact your annoyed at something that someone can't help. Its like getting mad at someone with a stutter because it takes them a while to get out what they are saying.
---
I would love to use those but it sucks because I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
And to be fair, I use insidious outside the shack so it's their fault for not checking the area when they know damn well that I'm a Leatherface
---
A lot of people in this game will try to blame their failures on everything but themselves (‚ÄúYou tunnelled!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou had a toolbox!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou used a perk a don‚Äôt like!‚Äù etc. etc. etc.). You‚Äôre best off ignoring them.
---
Lol what a joke
---
I'm giggling like an idiot over horseless chickens
---
More like "When the killer has tuft of hair and tombstone and your team lets him get T3"
---
He doesn‚Äôt need eyes to smell your fingers
---
Yes but even the best killers want to just chill now and then, end of the day its a video game and supposed to be a way to relax which is not something you will get from an SWF team compared to 4 random survivors.
---
It's because they nerf'd level progression making it harder for survivors to pip. If you're not going to stand a chance early on, then there's absolutely no way you're gonna level up. And with long wait times between games, for survivors, just DC and hope to get a quick next match. I get that DC'ing in general is frowned upon but BI, in my opinion, messed up by making it more difficult to pip. This spike is DC's is the result.
---
How is it OP on any killer besides maybe omega blink nurse and godlike huntress?
---
It got nerfed a long time ago when lockers started blocking it. Just hide in a locker if another survivor is about to be hooked.
---
It‚Äôs a meme dude. Obviously everyone has heard it. Google it.
---
you get punished for doing generators instead of crowding around a hook camper.  Next? mind not changed.
---
Facing 4 random Survivors is considerably easier than facing a 4-man SWF, but with 1.5k hours ingame I can confidently say very rarely do SWF make Killer "un-fun" to play. 
---
You are playing a competitive game, if you make it to high rank, you will be facing a challenge no matter wether your facing a SWF or not.
---
Very well detailed
---
The toolbox was last minute i legot found a tackle box at walmart so i grabbed it for a prop. The whole costumes not finished anyways ^^ i am working on her grafitti skin! I just finished spirit tho recently and im working on meg and jane
---
I left the hook and they were immediately unhooked. So I slugged the guy who got unhooked and hooked the other dude. 
---
I came back (I knew he had ds, im not a fckn idiot) and I put him on hook for death. Post game I get a party inv from one of the survivors and the message about ds. 
---
I just moved on lol.
---
Fair! I agree and I wish people in this community cut each other a bit more slack sometimes.
---
Devs never fix shit and when they do it takes them soooooo long.
---
almost no one uses it for aura reading these days  
---
people run it for bloodpoints
---
Tombstone + hair + ebony mori
---
Sounds great doesnt work. I enjoyed f13 but honestly voice chat ruined the experience with toxic assholes and screaming kids. I really dont want that here
---
:O
---
Sounded a little sarcastic to me. I think he's a killer main and he's mocking what a survivor would say
---
I think the best one i've had was when i got chainsawed through a pallet, the pallet didn't break and the killer got stunned after downing me...
---
that feeling when you M1 down someone with a flashlight and someone else takes it up and flashlight-saves
---
Enduring+Spirit Fury=bye-bye pallets
---
lol, if he didn't run DS he'd be mad for not being slugged cuz he'd feel "tunneled"
---
I agree so much!!! I play both killer and survivor, and no matter how good the connection is and having no lag, there‚Äôs always at least one hit which is just bullshit. I play spirit who I find hit box one of the better ones (unlike Freddy, hag, nurse and legions) but I always get a hit that doesn‚Äôt even come close to hitting them. Of course, why would killers complain about this? But it‚Äôs just annoying on both ends. I just want a fair game
---
I agree that DBD is buggy and has matchmaking issues but it's far from unbalanced. If you get to high rank you're gonna face competitive players, no one gets to that rank "playing casually". And like I said, at high rank the difference between SWF and Solo isn't huge.
---
It working vs it causing FPS issues are two separate things. If it fixes the m1 issue then it's one step closer to a solution - does it?
---
Yes, you‚Äôre right
---
Does it work for you?
---
I didn‚Äôt try a match because my FPS went so low I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to play lol
---
what else do you want them to do? hook and go hide in the basement? it's not like they have something else to defend now
---
Leveled David and Jane to 50 and didn't get borrowed time levels meg up to 10 now I'm running borrowed time 3
---
"he said the hatch must be closed or the gates open. Generators are irrelevant." Good luck getting the gates to open or hatch to spawn with out doing some of the gens... Point of this post is people thought the killer could trigger the gates at the very start of the trial which I was saying is not possible.

Did players *actually* think the endgame would be triggerable at the start though? That's silly.
---
This is what Tier 4 Tenacity looks like.

I tried it out. It's running the game in native 4k now, my native resolution.
---
I set my res to 0% and my quality to LOW. Try that. It's a start, testing it now.
---
I played a game as survivor earlier against a wraith. We had two dcs, so bing bong boy let me and a David farm, it was nice. Then he accidentally killed the David, and then let me have the hatch. Lol.
---
I usually  hate these concepts but MECHANIC'S TOOLBOX farming???? üòç
---
Lol ok if you say so frankly I have seen, heard and know myself it is unbalanced and for me its part of its charm. Also, bar when they made it stupid hard, playing casual is dead easy to get to high rank. I have never at high rank consistently got games with amazing survivors often their are a few potatos. 
---
I am not gonna keep this up as I think your just evading my point that it is more stressful and not everyone will want that every time they play. If you are ok with it that is great and kudos but expecting others to be like that is a bit entitled. It isn't the players fault the SWF on PS4 is bollocks that is down to the devs and that is the key problem, if you got games every few minutes you wouldn't care if people dodge you now and then.
---
Well thank you for the compliment!
---
I feel like Kate would be a narc

That looks delightful!

There's at least 12 frames in this gif.

That's at least 10 more than the average BDB console game.

~~and that's coming from a PS4 player~~
---
Mettle of man does not work against multiple killers, and even if it does work, you are complaining about avoiding ONE hit through the entire game. If missing that one hit is so bad that you need to make a post on reddit about it, maybe you should chase someone else.
---
They needed a ''op'' perk to sell Ash dlc to the people who don't care for him. I wouldn't had  brought him if it wasn't for MoM.

Dwight is amazing! I can see why you went to Kate tho

I honestly don‚Äôt understand that, I mean if you want to wait for second for me to catch up that‚Äôs great

Now you get it!

Good meme
---
Toxicity is what makes this game entertaining, engaging, and fun for the whole family
---
And again my suggestions -and there's no doubt in my mind that these were discussed but were shut down because they want to appease the fucktards- would have fixed all the end game problems and hatch standoffs. 
---
I see the whole "end game collapse" bullshit as a massive waste of time and money. It's a Rube Goldberg design meant to fix something while also clearly catering survivors. No hatch grab is just an extra twist of the knife. The devs might as well say "Fuck killers. We don't want you to ever get 4 kills. We one asshole to always get away in the end. It doesn't matter how well you played versus how badly they played. We want one guy to be practically insured that he gets away. Fuck you very much and thanks for the money."
---
Because of the lore *wink wink*
---
Always expect the no ed on any Killer, it's your own fault if you don't take it into account.

because this game is asymmetrical  
---
It literally splits community into 2 groups that fight eachother
---
You can also usually tell because people who voluntarily DC leave a corpse behind. If they get dropped they vanish.
---
Not even that hard to beat
---
Dead hard does not work against multiple killers, and even if it does hit, the killer knows about it, rendering it useless the rest of the game. If missing one hit is so bad that blah blah blah. You get my point. You don't miss the hit. You hit them, they don't get injured, and they first away to another loop. That could waste another 30-90 seconds depending on their skill level. You must be a survivor main if you don't see how that would be bad after a Sprint burst, especially if multiple people can run it
---
That would make sense
---
Honestly I have enjoyed are discussion but it is getting no where, your now stating their is hardly any difference between facing SWF and solo high ranks which is ludicrous. Coms changes the whole game and allows you to be more organised than any solo could be, I have been rank 1 survivor many times and I can attest it is no where near as easy solo as it is when I SWF. 
---
You have your opinion and I appreciate that I just wanted to get across that you should cut people some slack not argue and now your just throwing stuff back at me but yet I am addressing your points and your still ignoring that I said its more stressful and you even made out I said it was 'unfun'. I get it makes you mad and I honestly have been there doing PS4 SWF but I don't get mad at the killers because fact is its nuts it takes that long to even find a lobby. Hopefully the dedicated servers will speed up your queue times and then it won't be such a big problem.
---
Aww I love their little rubber hose arms
---
I'm calling the devs stupid assholes because that's what they fucking are and you're trying to strawman and say I'm mad and that hand waves all arguments I bring up. 
---
And the funny thing with you stupid cocksucking survivor mains is this: I could be as nice as humanly possible and phrase this post as nicely as could be and I'd still get down voted by you cocksuckers and told to shut up and you fucking know in your tiny lizard brain that that's true.
---
That was my point. Also gens pop too fast
---
You know what I do if I suspect bbq and chilli? I walk to the oposite of the generator and crouch. That's all.
---
The hell? I thought this glitch was taken care of?
---
Had to throw noed in there like you can't destroy that before the 5th gen.
---
Can't really think of one but even as Killer I don't see winning vs losing as black and white. You hook everybody twice? You safety pip I think or possibly pip up (Can't remember) if you did well enough in stalling and chases. 
---
Likewise, as Survivor with the pipping changes, you can fart around, wait for everyone else to die, get hatch, and still depip because you otherwise did jack shit (no gens, no unhooks, no totems, just hid in a locker and grabbed hatch)
---
Likewise you can depip with a 3K as killer if you facecamp everyone to death. I actually disagree with some of the ranking changes (mainly gatekeeper forcing super proactive offensive play vs stalling due to no more gatekeeper points after 9 minutes) but if you do that you're both losing chaser points (Which I honestly find a bit dumb but it doesn't take points away if survivors are nearby) and missing out on extra points for chases, hits, hooks, etc.
---
To me as Killer "win" isn't a hard 4K. 2K is just acceptable performance, 3K is what I aim for, and a 4K is the cherry on top. 
---
And for the not securing the objective thing, I just see it as cheesy if a Doc can simply 3-gen you or otherwise run a stalling build and force out a win by running the clock down. There's not much that can be done against a 3-gen doc and making it so time is on his side even more than it already is just would be too much.
---
Everyone but Freddy and Michael are fodder and lack feats to prove that they can stand up to either of them.
---
Perks gives you more money after a match and does litterally nothing else  
---
too strong, would nerf again 7.3/10 affecting gameplay way too much
---
Yeah but the killer can close the hatch now so I don‚Äôt understand what the problem is.
---
You know what I do when I go against ds?  Just fucking listen for their footsteps when they hit me and pick them up again
---
Make survivors 10% speed of killer lmao you wanna play snail simulator?
---
Hey Behavior ain't all bad, at least they're addressing some of the issues with the game in the next patch. And the end game collapse stops hatch standoffs and exit gate t-bagers so that's something.
---
Dead hard does indeed work against every killer, but that is besides the point. By your logic, borrowed time is overpowered. Noed allows you to get 2 hits for 1 swing. Ruin allows you to delay the game long enough to get at least 2 or 3 extra hits in the survivors‚Äô lost time. Barbecue allows you to start chases quickly, and therefore get more hits in a faster manner. Whispers allows you to efficiently find survivors in the early game, and score free early hits. There are currently exactly two perks that allow you to consistently avoid a hit.
---
you shouldn't depip if one of your emblems is iridescent\*
---
Yeah I‚Äôve played with it quite a bit, only works once! I honestly don‚Äôt understand why everyone is butthurt over MOM. I play killer and survivor, it can be annoying but it‚Äôs not op at all
---
I almost guarantee that this idea has been done before and I look like an unoriginal taint but hey what can you do
---
Because it doesn't require skill to use, just like noed.
---
I love seeing people in their high school days.
---
I personally like that the gens pop too fast, makes it really clear that I need to run noed to win since people are not spending any time clearing dull totems.
---
What value would you suggest if that was the case? Because wake up already let's you open gates 15% faster.
---
I got punished by not getting  rewarded. If i deserved to pip and I didn‚Äôt thats punishment
---
I did and you‚Äôre saying that it‚Äôs an instant win for the final survivor and they don‚Äôt reward killers but maybe if the killer was good they‚Äôd be able to beat the survivor by closing the hatch or just a wild idea slug the last two survivors so they can‚Äôt get the hatch.
---
Give the bunny or we riot &gt;:( &gt;:(
---
I refuse to participate in your kink.
---
We're gonna dance around a pentagram during a full moon.
---
Other survivors just see you having a seizure on the floor

Spies From The Shadows
---
Spies from the shadows
---
I laughed
---
Its funny that they say that, cause Claudette is the most try hard survivor. Shes the hardest to see and one of the quietest.
---
Only bad survivors will complain about BBQ. Yeah, your aura gets shown, its not a big deal since you can just start looping as soon as they come to you and waste their time. If its a really good nurse and you can't have a chase longer than a 20 seconds, just hide in a locker 4HEad
---
Half are sacrificed, all four uninstall.
---
i like hex ruin, hex thrill of the hunt, monitor and abuse, BBQ and chili 
---
that build lets me protect my hex totems. get close enough to use my phase walk without them realizing it (i use the add ons to keep her phase walk silent) and basically i can just pull people off of totems and gens
---
I feel like M&amp;A wouldn‚Äôt be very helpful as spirit.
---
Yeah it is your fault for not finding to totems. If you play against a low - lower mid tier killer, then your sorry ass better be looking for totems, because that last gen hits, you better be on your way out. The killer is rewarded for exploiting a survivors' stupidity. You were to dumb to clear totems, then too bad.
---
Something like 100% faster would be worthwhile and only under that circumstance.
---
It‚Äôs a map add on, allows you to place a marker in the game for everyone to see. But I don‚Äôt think killer can see it.
---
I was playing survivor today, something i rarely do, so i could get my last few achievements.
---
And i experienced nearly all the scummy tactics you could imagine; killers camping hooks, tunnled to death, slugged and at times all three. The last thing this game needs is to encourage this behaviour.
---
Its safe to say i won't be touching survivor again.
---
Anyone got the if BHVR made halloween video?
---
Killer name? It may have been me
---
Both
---
Well its a good thing I dont design killers. These perk ideas were half baked so I really didnt think how they would actually be to play against, the third perk was going to be his power, but it felt out of place
---
Despite playing him like any other (like i usually do with any killer) i destroy with him and I genuinely dont know why
---
ohh thank you
---
How is 3 minutes forcing them out instantly? And if anyone is injured it slows down the timer. That's plenty of time.
---
Nw~
---
‚ÄúToo dumb to clear totems‚Äù mother fucker do you play solo? Finding 5 totems is almost never possible even with small game. Combine the killer chasing you, the need to do gens, team mates being downed and hooked, and span all of this varying between 5 entire totems that you must traverse a potentially huge map to find, not only is it a huge time waste but it‚Äôs all or nothing?
---
Find 4? Too bad, kill yourself, gg ez lel
---
Tbh his power sounds more threatening than freddy and PtB legion
---
Yes. I agree...
---
Worn by me, made by Benchmark Leatherworks.
---
www.benchmarkleatherworks.com
---
Pretty cool, looks like a lot of long-requested methods for ending hatch standoffs and quickening up the endgame so Survivors can't just hold the game hostage.
---
Id have to disagree. From killer add ons to make you exhausted to getting you out of a bind, it‚Äôs at a good state.  Especially if you‚Äôre not playing an M1 killer.
---
So don't use something the game gives you.... hmmmm.  You all sound ridiculous.
---
I brought ebony and NOED and he wanted to give my advice for playing legion. I said i was becoming a survivor main and egtting BP when legion nerf comes.
---
he said "no reason to bring ebony and items" and  then later said "no matter how you play legion he's op" then after that he said legion is powerful and no nerf will make him fair to play against
---
If that happens to you, you genuinely need to git gud. You should definitely have picked up the downed person by the time somebody else has the chance to yoink the flashlight AND get into position to blind you.
---
I know it would be a pain to balance but I really want a Killer whose power prevents you from looking at them.
---
That‚Äôs too much work ü§£
---
I dont understand why people hide in the basement. The guy on the hook will know you're there and can alert their buddies either with jumping jacks or SWF discord
---
Instead of being an event how about being something you can unlock in the blood web. It would cost just as much as a lvl 3 perk and you would have to choose if its worth it or not.
---
I feel you..
---
MADNESS GOD TIER!
---
The point I was trying to make is that they have no right to bitch about me using a perk that nullifies their playstyle
---
If you consider the "mains" of the community,
---
Survivors should theoretically out number killers 3:1
---
I personally dislike posts from X main as it normaly suggests they ignore the possible view points of others
---
The **Son** of a Shepard.
---
I‚Äôm so excited for the rush of trying to save people and get out while the timer is ticking down and the ground is shaking. Seems like so much fun. Also like you said, it‚Äôs way more dynamic than the old hatch standoff.
---
That's actually a fair point. The people who used to DC to intentionally depip were few and far between, comparatively. Now that that punishment has been removed this whole mentality of "I can get away with this" has grown.
---
Lol yeah exactly! I gave him a chance to escape by not just leaving and he got mad when that chance ended up not being in his favor.
---
Me: i personally don't care for bunny feng and think its been over hyped
---
Desd by daylight Redit: *everyone disliked that*
---
I can‚Äôt believe I read this. I can‚Äôt believe how angry and how much hatred you have... over Dead By Daylight.  I sure would hate to see how your speak/act over something remotely serious. 
---
You‚Äôre getting angry over something that hasn‚Äôt even happened yet.    
---
I think you need to take a breather, a step back, and reflect.  Maybe delete the game. 
---
Good luck to you. Have a good day
---
Me when that is actually the most reasonable strategy to secure a kill.
---
The killer probably gets more enjoyment out of you rage quitting anyway
---
But how is the survivor gonna be cursed if they can't vault the window due to bamboozle?
---
What I've been doing the last few days is timing my matches endgames once the gates are opened, and rarely does it go to 3 minutes with everyone at full health. With the exception being 1-2 survivors sitting at the gate tbagging for literally minutes.
---
We'll both just have to wait and see, but I really think you're underestimating how long 3 minutes lasts with the gates open
---
I know what you were trying to say. It's all just ridiculous. I don't even engage in the negativity in this game anymore. I say gg (even if it wasn't) and leave the chat.
---
It sucks becaus it rewards killers for playing poorly, the devs are blowing smoke. The truth is that they have no idea how to balance it and are making excuses. It‚Äôs a shitty perk that is countered by swf, who are already strong, but completely fucks over solo play.
---
Minimum pallets on each map are 8. If the games generates a map with less pallets it spawns double pallets to reach the minimum of 8 pallets.
---
It looks like this is a good thingto have a double pallet jungle gym, but actually you gonna have a bad time with only 8 pallets on the whole map.
---
You have Mr edge on the left, curious George in the Middle and UG on the right.
---
Definitely beats my stick figures tho

Well I‚Äôm not going to sit there for 5 min and let them fuck around with me.

Being a small studio is not an excuse for being lazy. Hell, legion's name doesn't even make sense with the way he plays.

He‚Äôs so pathetic. I think he used the word ‚Äúfucktard‚Äù more than any word. It‚Äôs embarrassing to see these times of people in this community.  No one in this mental health state should play the game, period.
---
I don't think it's going to change too much about how the end game normally plays out, but I think it's going to *feel* more intense, which isn't a bad thing.
---
&gt;egion is powerful and no nerf will make him fair to play against
---
Doubt
---
And I will deal with it. Because I don‚Äôt get bent out of shape like this, about this game.  And worst argument? I didn‚Äôt come here to argue. I gave my input.   You do what you will with that information.

I was that jake and you blocked me in a corner teabagging until myers came and git me you punkass bitch

i think that the game is having some audio issues at the moment however i'm not too sure. they were fixed before but it seems that they are back?

and the Doctor whispering thing is part of his madness, i think

I changed my control settings on ps4 for actions. Repair and healing are on the right directional button and vaulting and pallet drop on the R1 button. For two patches I get in the mid bottom section of the game the right directional button with the message "unknown" displayed. If I press the button without being near an action like gens my character is doing a weird animation. Changing the controls back to default is fixing this problem but on ps4 I do not want the same button for healing and pallet drops because of obvious reasons. Thanks for working so much on this game.

Mmm. So your one of those who don‚Äôt understand how hard developing a game with stringy code is? Please don‚Äôt blame the devs.
---
Shut up bitch thays what
---
It's just a salty survivor thing to say when vsing Legion if you think he's OP no matter how you play him
---
Phi Phi obviously has a lot to say
---
I don't think anyone liked ds in its former state...
---
K den.
---
Nice system
---
And you're only level 9??
---
Lmao no I didn't? The second you were done cleansing I started running toward the exit gate, then he cut us both off so I tried blocking. I'm sorry if I unintentionally blocked you man, but it's always better to be safe than sorry and just leave.

\-Signed, Punkass Bitch
---
I did this and the nurse came right after me. And I hid BEFORE the hook, not during. 
---
I was very far away. Do killers get visual notification like a fast vault when sprinting into a locker?
---
Damn what a smart reply
---
Yeah. have a few hundred hours logged on, but this level up system is all new to me.
---
You did it on purpose! You said I was too bih to fit through and stuck me in the corner
---
Too bih for you
---
If one person is getting camped the other three can no only finish any already worked on generator but then meet up and power out a 4th. Any faster and the game would end by just touching it.
---
BBQ, STBFL, Shadowborn, and Discordance.
---
I use movespeed and charge add-ons.
---
BBQ for obvious aura reading.
---
STBFL because I like to cutdown chase time, hit multiple survivors grouped up and punish hook rushers.
---
Shadowborn because I hate low FOV and you can get cheeky surprises on survivors out of the corner of the killer FOV I wouldn't notice otherwise due to the nature of phase walk.
---
Discordance for giving me map awareness and knowing when at least 2 survivors are on a gen. I use it to surprise survivors by chasing + hitting one but leaving my terror radius on the gen. I then phase back to the gen to grab the other survivor if they decide to stay. Hitting the 1st then phasing has gramted me a ton of success in grabbing off gens.
---
Haha. You‚Äôre funny, cause your wrong.
---
This dude is a troll account, check his history
---
I just want a balanced game. What is the problem with that? Why should I just lay down and take it for no reason? You're like the kids in the mw2 days who said, "one man army danger close is in the game. Deal with it." If everybody was like you, sfv would still be throw loop, anti-air jab, no story mode garbage. If people don't complain, nothing gets fixed
---
Yea, If i know I'm screwed.. I let myself get hooked
---
Yeah, I know things like Ash voicelines and other small things seem to be fixed, it's so hard to tell with some things? It's so crucial to be able to tell what direction something is in.
---
I'm pretty sure too, I guess I had just never played against him on headphones before, or something? It's also rare I let him shock me enough to need to snap out of it, anyway. Really weirded me out for the first minute.
---
Wait huh? Maybe we only had similar experiences lmao but not the same game. After "you" said I blocked you I didn't say anything else in chat. The only thing I said was "Sorry Jake, I tried body blocking for you :C", periodt. What rank were you playing?
---
I think it‚Äôs a cute one too, even though I don‚Äôt ship much
---
The devs are allowed to be criticized for shitty decisions. 
---
Also that "u just dont get it man" stuff doesn't work. I know it's hard but you have to admit they kinda suck when it comes to fixing things and listening to the ENTIRE community outside of the survivor side.
