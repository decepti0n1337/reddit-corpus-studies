Majority I‚Äôve seen agree the snares aren‚Äôt that strong. And AGAIN either way please look at the block add ons, ESPECIALLY the z block, they are really bad. Those at least need buffs
---
---
---
Why are birds such dicks?
---
Way to spin a killer and survivor issue to be completely survivor-sided, you dork.
---
Waiting for Ne- I mean the Entity to let me come into the game.
---
Those guys are doing the hard job, youre just holding M1
---
....no... it doesn't. Again, watch the example match. Then go ahead and tell me "lag" is the reason these survivors are giving up.
---
&gt; you could wait until theyre close and close the hatch in their face
---

---
Wraith is perfect for this because he's totally invisible while standing still and he can close it while cloaked. 
---
Also, unless it was changed with the EGC, he can bodyblock Survivors from using the Hatch while cloaked.
---
Yes I‚Äôve said this before! They need to actually sit down with the content creators like monto, and I personally think they should talk to No0b3 although i know they hate him, true talent and people like that because they have strong opinions about the game that actually reflect the majority of the player base.
---
This panda fellow sounds very lovely! I‚Äôll have to give him a check cuz I‚Äôd love to see his shrine week videos!
---
And I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been forgetting. I‚Äôve been so caught up in the stress that I think I need to have another chill period and just watch streams or something. 
---
Could I ask why he doesn‚Äôt use that hex? It‚Äôs annoying but I thought it was helpful for killers to slow down the game a little? I don‚Äôt use it so I‚Äôm not sure of it‚Äôs use much.
---
Aww
---
Did they say the are going to rework nurse?
---
Thanks I‚Äôll give it a try I was using Snapchats cropping feature.
---
 I teabag back...  But the point is that survivor teabag to annoy me, while i teabag, breaking the line of sight, in order to regress his revealing process, so he wouldn't break me out of Nisht Shroud. And i also slowly expose him at the same time.
---
 Thus he can teabag all he wants, he only makes my job much easier.
---
Every killer has bad add-ons. Why don't you complain about that? And yeah majority plays Freddy with dream pallets. If you want to learn how to use them you should give it some time instead of saying that it is bad and that is why I don't use them.
---
if youre wraith you have 100% confirmed win if you find the hatch, bodyblocking hatch still works since once a survivor used a key and i body blocked by accident a nea so i closed it and killed her
---
I know it is but everyone cracks on how bad F13 is in here and thought it be funny to post, guess not...
---
What have you brought upon these cursed lands?
---
Both are toxic and ruin the mood of the other person making it less fun for them, if you are teabagging dont be suprised to that leads to facecamping and tunnelling and this is coming from a survivor main who just plays killer on the side
---
Yup that was the joke
---
This is some high quality work. Well done, OP
---
Keep in mind it is not from best to worst(the tiers) like in A tier Michael isn‚Äôt better than spirit they‚Äôre the same along with billy..(imo)
---
*Brings a toolbox, map, or Small Game*
---
"Immersed Claudette" is true of most Claudette's though. The rest are just unfunny memes.
---
You tryna tell me Steve pallet slamming and teabagging the demogorgon isn't the best fate for him? Open your eyes
---
you just called him daddy myers though ;)
---
Doesn't help you when you're in a chase. You either have to avoid good loops which means you go down faster or step in a trap.
---
Three big issues. You're running Bond, Lightweight, and a lens on your flashlight. Three giant signs of a boosted survivor.
---
Yeah this is sweet and all and not at all realistic either.
---
Using unfair items like Insta heals and Ebonys is toxic. It brings about as much misery to the other side as hitting them on the hook or tbagging. Likely more.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs the devs fault they‚Äôre OP, human beings have autonomy unless they‚Äôre like 5 years old. It‚Äôs not hard to just say,
---
‚ÄúNah I don‚Äôt wanna run this it‚Äôs busted as hell and will make the other guy feel bad‚Äù
---
Wanting a GG after using only broken shit is ridiculous. It‚Äôs like bringing a gun to a knife fight and wanting someone to Pat you on the back for winning.
---
A 5% speed nerf is NOT a ‚Äúlittle tweak‚Äù
---
had this happen to me too
---
AFAIK all items of a rarity have the same chance of popping up. Clown's Solvent Jug technically shouldn't be rarer than any other uncommon. I think because of him having quite a bit of uncommons (and uncommon shit in general. BP offerings, Cypress Mori, Mist Offering, Shroud Of Separation, Scratched Coin, etc.) they seem rare. 
---
Do note however Jigsaw Pieces feel super mega rare on my Doctor bloodwebs, as if even the entity doesn't want me running Dr. Worldwide too often.
---
Yeah I've had a few. For some reason I've been finding an absurd amount of Wraiths that don't cloak very often, or Huntress players that will only go for one or two hatchet throws at you
---
walter
---
I wasnt sure if I stopped running if it would go back to normal sprint speed so I just ran around for awhile ü§£ü§£
---
How did you manage to do this holy hell haha
---
"Well needed tweaks" Uh, no. Go back to rank 20, Survivor main.
---
That‚Äôs great.
---
That poor killer, sees the flash run by and now there are scratch marks everywhere.
---
Someone running Sprint Burst who doesn't know how to properly run the most basic powerful tile in the game? Colour me shocked!
---
They changed Plague as well IIRC. I don't think this is the first time they've changed a Killer before release.
---
No one asked you to make such a shitty, unfunny meme, and yet you did.
---
Only if his Scoops Ahoy outfit is available. Then it's heaven.
---
Begone thot
---
I didn't say anything about pricing.
---
who cares if I don't know how to run the perfect tile not everyone is godlike at this game
---
Then keep scrolling
---
Makes me so sad that the Neas in Claudette suits have ruined the Claudette image. We true Claudette mains just want to hide in the tall grass and immerse ourselves in the Entity's realm.
---
It's a joke, man. Jeez.
---
Like other people making jokes about seeing trucks filled with pallets.
---
I just got hit but it bugged out where I kept the sprint burst from the hit. That's why it looks so choppy
---
Shouldn't need to be godlike to understand the most basic tile loops.
---
Hiding in locker's, you?
---
gee sorry if I'm bad at looping
---
I went against a LeatherFace that didn't use his chainsaw at all but had add-ons on boosting it,I think rank reset and the power of M1 have aligned
---
I was super bummed cause it was such a close game I worked for the win and the entity said it was gonna be cool and give me 5k anyway but then he just put me on a hook backwards and pinched my ballsack while it hung between my legs.
---
I use him a lot! The problem with some (not all) trappers is, they put the traps in bad places! Gens are so obvious. Put them between pallets or even in weird choke point. People are bound to rely on weird ways to escape and blocking those can save a game.
---
Yeah I feel like it's close to:
---
 
---
S: Nurse
---
A: Billy, spirit, hag, huntress (maybe)
---
B: Doc, Trapper, Clown, Freddy, Plague, Myers, Ghostface, Leatherface
---
C: Legion, Wraith, Pig
---
The only high tier people are the usual suspects, and the only low tier killers are the killers that recieved mega nerfs or have useless powers.
---
Mr. Fermi would like to have a word with you.
---
Rank 8 surv here. I play overly altruistic, even with randoms, because i know for a fact I'm the only one with Borrowed Time in the lobby. My mates would run OoO or Unbreakable rather than running Borrowed time or We'll make it, so I pretty much HAVE to save. If not, my mates won't do it and I can't trust randos to have BT.
---
i agree 100%.  there‚Äôs nothing i despise more than when a survivor acts like they‚Äôre Albert-fucking-Einstein by running in a circle for 10 minutes and hitting a pallet or when a killer acts like they‚Äôre God itself because they managed to down you by hook camping.  it‚Äôs really infuriating.  if i‚Äôm playing killer and get to hook a BM survivor i always make sure to give them an extra slash while they‚Äôre on the hook.  it‚Äôs totally harmless and useless, but it makes me feel better.
---
Killers got a reworked killer and new killer within the last 2 months. How can you be complaining about not having fun? Survivors still hold m1 and hit space a few times as their objective all game, how do you think they feel? Lol
---
Just leave right away. The internet will always have toxic people enjoying anonymity.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since release on PS4.  Since having a kid my playtime is a lot less and I haven‚Äôt had time to get get back to rank one as quickly as I used to.  I am running into new players all the time.
---
You‚Äôve got to be  trolling or brain dead. Trapper is mid tier. Nurse with good perks and add-onsis high tier. Everyone else is way better than trapper
---
I just don‚Äôt know how this hasn‚Äôt been taken down yet, it has nothing to do with the game and is unrelated, seeing as me posting a picture of my dog peeking around a corner when I made a joke about Myers stalking you was apparently unrelated, but people can get away with posting videos of flashlights and taking pictures of grates and pallets. What a fascinating subreddit.
---
Watch out. Logic scares people.
---
I agree with that. I definitely wasn't trying to say its only a killer issue where they think they should only play the best 3 killers in the game to give them the best chance at a 4K.
---
A lot of survivors do the same thing where they will only use the best possible perks to give them the best chance of escaping. You can still escape without any of the meta perks, but for some reason everyone needs that top tier rank which is odd because then they'll turn around and complain about how little fun they're having at rank 1 lol.
---
I think the game would be a lot better off if there was less of this mindset of "if i'm not winning as much as possible then this isn't fun". Chances of that happening though are pretty small.
---
Being a god.
---
Something was wrong with it on ps4 so they had to delay bill
---
Oh shit this happened to me today , it was such bs
---
Nah, blow jobs are just funny.
---
Why would anyone want to buff solo survivors. If anything, nerf SWF
---
Loading up dbd. What is your PSN?
---
Anime_Fan_2002
---
I like the idea, but too op. Here‚Äôs my changes.
---
Doors take 10 seconds to lock but are only lockable from one side.
---
Killers can break doors, like pallets.
---
If door is unlocked/being locked but not finished, killer can break it immediately with a small stun period.
---
I ain't spending money on dlcs on ps4 so not so many killers for me, also Gosthface is a worst Michael and Freddy is just mid tier, not Nurse/Spirit level. Survivors have to sit on a gen while one single guy keeps the killer distracted for 80 seconds to get 3 gens done, with insane broken loops, crutch, the best items and survivor sided maps very few killers are viable, those killers have don't have any map pressure or great abilities. Bring a toolbox and you make the Trapper unable to use his power, Wraith gets countered by flashlights and other killers are straight out up. If the devs cared a bit about the game they wouldn't only nerf killers 1 week after they come out on the live servers like they did with Gosthface. The only major thing we got was the flashlight nerf, but we only got it because Cote got fucking bullied to hell by some guys while he was playing his own game. If you don't play both sides or killer at all you shouldn't be talking. We can't have fun if we get teabagged to hell and there's nothing we can do about it.
---
This was already posted on the subreddit by the author.
---
First off you could be the best player in the world with Pig,  someone eventually will juke it predict you, or you will miss. 
---
Now explain why the ambush gets nerfed to not work with any on hit effects but Infectious fright gets buffed to work with chainsaws?  In what way does this make sense?
---
Otzdarva is good killer who speaks his thoughts out loud and generally explains lots of things going on.
---
I figured I'd get downvoted. These are the same killers that complain about the no heal/Adrenaline survivor meta and the gen rush. That's literally what the Plague forces survivors into. The "downside" of not cleansing is the most effective way to get gens done fast, and they get a free heal from a fountain at 1 gen left. Being a 1 shot doesn't mean much on Pallethaven when the killer is a 32m terror radius giant traffic cone with no chase power. Plague at red ranks is a bully simulator unless the survivors are potatoes.
---
Thrilling Tremors+Pop is a better combo.
---
I see this so much. Honestly, it‚Äôs just something to deal with. Maybe sometimes, take a nice match. Let the survivors win but make sure they know you‚Äôre letting them. Maybe just get in a party and play with friends and have fun in KYF instead. I know this game can cause a lot of toxicity and if you see it, try messaging them without an angry tense. I‚Äôve surprisingly gotten a lot of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù‚Äôs.
---
No.
---
[removed]
---
You know the only reason he was cast in the movie was shear luck. I had heard him doing a interview from back in the day and he said he wasn‚Äôt looking at becoming a actor and was at a casting call or something with his girlfriend at the time who was auditioning for some commercial and someone from the scream movie team seen him and asked if he wanted to audition, the rest is history...
---
You misread their comment
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool, he nailed the role
---
Yea true, fair point.
---
You buff solo survivors so killers can have better tools to use against SWF and inherit stalling.
---
Nerfing SWF is unfun, penalizing people for playing with friends is toxic for the games health
---
NO No No You Sucked My Dick, I didn‚Äôt suck yours
---
Yes.
---
I think it's been real, but we should agree to disagree. You don't know how to articulate your points. Your crutch is 'uhh, good spirits can counter it' and 'uhh, i saw like 1 - 2 matches where this WASN'T the case, so...' Enough for me to walk away, because nothing important is going to brought up
---
You can only do it on Claudette so you can be Crawl-dette
---
He did indeed
---
Madness three is supposed to be utilized to slow the game, not to try and stop you at the end. Interacting with gates but not letting you is op, it‚Äôs supposed to be used at the beginning or mid game to stop gen work and track survivors.
---
&gt;Nerfing SWF is unfun, penalizing people for playing with friends is toxic for the games health
---
This is the kind of strawman argument people pull out when they know they can't defend the real reason why people hate SWF: because it allows them unrestricted information at any point in the match and there is absolutely no drawback to it whatsoever.
---
First off you could be the best player in the world with Pig,  someone will juke you, predict you, get lucky, or you‚Äôll miss eventually.  It happens. 
---
Explain the logic behind neefing ambush to not work with an on hit effects but buffing infectious fright to work with chainsaws..?
---
Inf belt is 3 shots with iri head not 4
---
The devs have said themselves they are working on solo survivor communication so... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
So you play a game you don‚Äôt like? This does not spark joy.
---
Gates get powered when you can go and open them, wich means doing the last gen. Both are the same, just worded diferently
---
The direct middle of your screen needs to be over the top of his head. It doesnt work outside of that. Thats why when he picks up a downed survivor it knocks him out of his ability. The radius that it registers is pretty small so it can be difficult mid chase. I just imagine a little retical on the screen and try to look directly at his head. Hope this helps :)
---
Seeing basically only Freddy‚Äôs is why imma take a few days off as survivor, don‚Äôt want to over saturate it
---
Fair point. Neas of the realm, what do you have to say for yourself?
---
Additional Info: Clown kept smacking me while I was on hook till I died
---
That‚Äôs so cool! 
---
This has been happening allot lately, if it does I let them run back in and take the hatch if it‚Äôs still open... not gonna be a dick, you won your freedom..
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs toxic. As a red rank survivor main, I realize that SWF is incredibly powerful if all 4 of you know how to play the game.

If I get tea bagged as killer that survivors career is over, that's why I don't tea bag as a survivor it's just rude
---
Ah okay great thank you! With the non-licensed dlc killers that I have not unlocked (ghostface, clown, plague), is there one you‚Äôd say I should use my shards for more than the others?
---
Lol messaged himself  n-word then reported me
---
Small game? I knew I wasn't the only one that always get mad at my team not dealing with ruin
---
ik... feels bad when the community instead of finding a counter, they just dissconect... that shows how shit some people are
---
relatable
---
They‚Äôve made that so more difficult with the introduction of endgame
---
So if I‚Äôm good I‚Äôll get the ‚Äúfree‚Äù it.  Some of the time... right. Well shoot I may as well only use ambush! 
---
It‚Äôs the same scenario.  Using your power to get a hit.  We buff one that can instadown to help slug (which instadowning a survivor would be a huge benefit) and nerf an attack for what?  Just because it comes from stealth?  Except it‚Äôs not really stealth because of the roar halfway through charge... 
---
So make strong killers like billy stronger and make a mediocre to above average killer like pig able to use less perks with her power hit move? 
---
I don‚Äôt get it and your not very helpful. It‚Äôs not needed.
---
Lol wtf
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
That's why I used it before it got bugged, I keep thinking that they're lawn chairs
---
Feng min players that wear the dyed hair and shit are all neck beards change my mind
---
So?
---
This is so true, I just want bug fixes, they can leave the balace of the game as it is. I want hitboxes fixed so badly tho
---
The z block is purple, to diminish your first point, it should be a good add on. Second off, why should they stay bad? That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying buff them dude. And third I‚Äôm sure I play hours and hours and hours more Freddy than you, and trust me I use the snares over the pallets tbh. I‚Äôm not fucking saying they are bad if you would READ, I‚Äôm saying they could use some minor buffs, like their radius. There are moments when the survivor can just barely skip past and it can ruin a chase. You know nothing of balance so please move along.
---
Didn‚Äôt know there was that many people who received salty messages wow lol
---
Speintburst AND  Dead hard? Well thats a new kind of stupidity to me.
---
Wow the results are a little bit shocking
---
I‚Äôm actually really surprised to see the amount of women and LGBT people that play this game.
---
I also would never think that people HAVEN‚ÄôT received salty messages.
---
Not most, he is 115% like the majority.
---
110% is spirit, hag, huntress, and nurse with 96%.
---
The rest of the killers are 115%
---
I can‚Äôt just sit there and let that guy make bullshit claims against a killer who genuinely out played him, people just don‚Äôt know how to take a loss ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Baha
---
I don't like using it. Feels to cheap to get a free escape
---
found little bitch
---
Subscribed to him and truetalent, thanks so much guys!
---
In the words of someone else on this sub, "wahhh".
---
Yeah, unfortunately that's how Legion is now. Since the nerf, I mostly use FF for the mobility
---
Spine Chill isn't meta, I barely see it in red ranks. What I see in red ranks : exhaustion perks, Adrenaline, DS, BT and Iron Will. In 1 out of 10 matches if I see one Spine Chill. 
---
His anti loop power is useless if survivors drop the pallet earlier and you overrated the blurry seen, it's really not a big deal.
---
I mean I knew there would be more men but lgbt actually really surprised me also
---
To fix this fall off the edge. Then you will spawn where you spawed at the beginning of the game. After just escape again normally
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm not sure why we like this game so much.
---
But you made love to me!
---
PGTW is trash, any survivor will just wait around the corner and come straight back to it after it gets kicked lol.
---
No mither is just completely useless because you're one hit the entire game and 500% of the time the killer isn't going to let you pick yourself up
---
Yeah I usually never leave if I suck dick as survivor or killer I‚Äôll know and improve on it some people don‚Äôt like listening to that because it hurts their ego
---
I'm afraid Ghostface is licensed, and it depends. If you want to farm some BP I would recommend Legion or Plague, Clown is kinda useless unless you know how to play him. I bought Legion but still main Huntress so I would just say buy one and try it out. If you don't like it you can always buy another one later!
---
I already said he slows himself down after throwing the bottle, not during the holding animation. He slows himself enough to make his bottles almost useless in catching up survivors.
---
sprint burst/dead hard. 4th slot could be UE, MoM or DS.
---
Are u LGBT?
---
Yes, I ran into that the other day. Cannot cleanse that totem, I tried everything I could and couldn‚Äôt access it to disable.
---
I have a genuine respect for Jeff mains. Usually let you hit them at the gate for points, usually don't bm, usually say "Gg wp"   
---
Jeff's are pretty good in my book
---
Jacob Two-Two
---
What is the problem here? The killer was a low rank and won?
---
I am, yep.
---
I dunno. I've managed to get over 25 of every other yellow add-on, but Solvent Jug has less than 15 at any given time. Even when I stop using it to use the 50+ other add-ons I have, I get only 2 at most per blood web. Over 100 of those worthless Kerosene Cans though.
---
The only reason any god needs.
---
As a survivor main I say face camping Is good for the team. It allows them to do gens uninterrupted. If you want to save your friend so bad just do what I do and bring borrowed time and diversion
---
Exactly
---
I just pulled this trick again in another match. I was in the basement of the preschool, with the injured survivor I was chasing going up the stairs and undoubtedly going to unhook the hooked survivor that was right by the gen there. I teleported to the gen and slapped the injured survivor down before they could get the save. This ability is proving very useful as I go into more matches.
---
Nice
---
Meg doesn‚Äôt even look scared, just pissed
---
I am the one who claimed to be native American
---
The top 3 killers aren't good examples. I hate this argument. Because Nurse is broken, every other killer should be made as good as her and if they aren't then there is no way they are op. 
---
Nurse is going to be nerfed soon, spirit needs to be tweaked, and billy is the only truly solid killer right now I would say.
---
Dude i'm in college and crave dbd, but don't like surviving  
---
I need my fix :(
---
I'm a P3 Nea and I think I'm pretty non-toxic :/
---
&gt;:(
---
Definitely. I almost feel bad lmao.
---
Keep in mind that this is only out of 100 people though.
---
Cool but 2010 Freddy is our Freddy, not the original unfortunately
---
His lunge is the standard lunge range. It's just weird looking because he has a small weapon and a small model.
---
Literally stolen, like as stolen as they come
---
so you want to punish people for playing with friends?? we‚Äôre talking about a business here with dbd, and the devs want more people playing the game, you can‚Äôt punish people for wanting to play with friends because not everyone just wants to play solo all the time. it really is the way it has to be, i wish there was another solution but the devs want to keep their game alive.
---
I wonder if this can be abused to get people to die on hook because nobody wants to save them. I know the infamous Black Box Dying Light Jump Rope build to get the obsession to DC but I wonder about this one.
---
Because he's an idiot
---
It's more like my family didn't want to get a faster connection because it costs a lot more, we've been basically grandfathered into a plan that doesn't exist anymore.
---
Oh yes. This was so hilarious to do
---
wow I wasn't around back then and I don't see nobody play him at all
---
Are they aware of this bug? Happened to me too last night
---
Spoiler alert it was haunted grounds
---
I mean no offense, ofc...i still have PTSD from the P3 Laurie at Rank 2 when I was at rank 12.
---
SWFs tsk tsk
---
He's in his prime time
---
Literally it's sooooo slow
---
Solid killcount reference
---
Part of his power. When he is shrouded it means he has no red stain, or terror radius. He can only stalk people to get a 1 hit down while shrouded as well. To get him out of shroud you need to have on centered on screen. However, when you are looking at him and pulling him out of his power, he gets a visual notification on the screen showing him from what direction someone is looking at him
---
It's actually been happened to me since it came to console in 2017. So I dont know why it's still happening honestly
---
Just in case you weren't sure that the "one particular Survivor" you were obsessed with was a Survivor.
---
I fuckin love this comment

Really? Whoa, can‚Äôt believe I get this amazing survivor perk with my new Freddy
---
I agree with the teleport being fine as is but he gets way too many dream pallets.  10 feels like too many he can put them everywhere with practically non existent setup time.
---
Atleast it's theoretically jukable if you're good enough, this haddonfield loop is infinite and impossible to mind game.
---
Before you say just run bamboozle I don't think you should have to run a perk just incase someone decides to use bad design to their advantage.
---
Nurse is op though I do agree
---
Get clown. Get clown. Do it. He's more fun. And also a better killer in my opinion but more importantly get clown.
---
Oh my God  „ÄåThe Pig„Äç you are so Sexy mhmm mmm hmmmüò©üòîüòçüòç
---
So the way ghostface revealing works is sort of like a giggle shape, you need to be slightly to the left or right. Try and position him between you survivor and the edge of the screen.
---
My OP mentions buffing killers by slowing down Gen and totem speed as just a few ways
---
Well playing survivor got boring/annoying, I don't have a lot of friends that play DbD so I get paired with some of the dumbest mfs on the planet
---
I mean fine by me killer running Franklins just because of a medkit is one less meta perk on his build or you could go back and get your item on the floor
---
I remember I managed to get 4 d/c's in a match as pre rework Freddy and they were all tea bagging then one disconnected after I downed him 1 disconnected after I hooked him in the basement 1 disconnected cause i hit him while he was vaulting and the last disconnected cause I closed the hatch. He didn't even go for gate he just left. I felt amazing but my bloodpoints didn't feel very good
---
Clown imo. You rely on survivors to even use your power properly has Plague. Not being in control of your own mechanics isn‚Äôt fun. Plus clown is just better in my experience.
---
Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn‚Äôt I mean and people wonder why killer camps hook because 2.5 seconds after he leaves they get unhooked
---
Plague is better.
---
Would it be that more people follow this advice.
---
Back then if you played him even if you didn‚Äôt have sabo on if you got hooked you were face camped
---
Clown sux
---
No üòë
---
I mean it‚Äôs really not you just need more practice cause of joystick
---
I remember Plague being ranked as a better clown in a tier. 
---
But my main point is that Clown has 2 Very good perks depending on the killers.
---
POP you can use on any killer it‚Äôs just a really good perk. 
---
Bamboozle is a good perk but not on every killer. 
---
But pop is amazing
---
No... I thought the obsession was a pallet!
---
Nurse is just impossible to balance without a rework so I‚Äôm looking forward to see how they do this.
---
It's decent with New Freddy. Sure you don't have the super slowdown and tracking for tunneling, but Black Box combined with Jump Rope and Dying Light means the Obsession can't ever be woken up and has a slowdown penalty. Although a 9% action speed penalty is pretty pathetic, the obsession might just decide to DC and activate Dying Light for you.
---
She is in the middle tier but she is one of the most fun.
---
Sounds like a bullshit lie an autistic PC elitist would spew.
---
My eyes had a stroke
---
Isn't the seasons thing just where you get to create a character just for them to get deleted later?
---
Yeah, I rarely play survivor...
---
Other perks were also mentioned to be reworked!
---
Which ones specifically?
---
&gt;Stealthy killers might become more powerful! With the mention of perk reworks it was also mentioned that detection perks might not work as well against stealthy killers. Specifially mentioned was Object of Obsession.
---
Good. I'm tired of either being a stealth killer or watching a stealth killer get their stealth power practically disabled just because someone brought OoO.
---
&gt;HUGE mention of changing the disbalance between solo survivors and SWF. Specifically mentioned was addon Kindred to the survivors base kit. (They said that they were not 100% going to "pull the trigger on this"
---
I hope that means the devs are also thinking of ways to buff killers in order to be able to go against SWF/the SWF/solo hybrid better.
---
The devs aren't really interested in slowing down gen speed, though. I don't know what, but there'd have to be entirely new game mechanics added that would both slow the game down by default and be interesting to both survivors and killers.
---
But they would have no idea if you had a black ward beforehand?
---
mind....... blown.........
---
I had this happen on the same map. Cleansed a totem on pride rock, became stuck in the nook. Dead harded and sprint to get out. Ran across the map to a gen then immediately rubberbanded back to the totem. No lag in the game that was mentionable otherwise
---
I guess I can see it being toned down to 8
---
Gets gen rushed
---
&gt;(Confirmed) Nurse Rework!
---
...
---
&gt;Killer addons are going to be reworked! Specifically, the Nurse's addons and the Doctor's addons.
---
So a couple of Nurse's addons are going to be modified. Your title is misleading, you make it sound like Nurse is going to undergo a rework.
---
It‚Äôs beautiful
---
I hope so. I want to buy the Switch version, but having to redo the grind completely kills that thought.
---
This game is perfection
---
*look buddy, i'm not gonna stop laughing. I am playing doctor here, gimme a break*
---
Save yourself some time and turn your sensitivity up to 100% before you even start because eventually you're gonna want it that way anyways
---
2010 Freddy smiled lol
---
Its not really  the %50 that frightens me, its the "while sprinting" condition that scares me the most.
---
Screams in madness
---
That is the true balance we need
---
If this had audio, it would be easier to tell what happened.
---
It looks like you started revealing him, but moved the camera off center. So you had to restart the reveal, and he exposed you because of it.
---
Holy fuck, you're autistic as shit.
---
This image is too loud
---
Only helps so much tho. Those users are harder to catch but a really good spirit like me knows when to fake phase to see where you go then close the gap.
---
have you ever played against a god billy? If you dont know what you are doing then no loops are safe, His chainsaw steering is amazing
---
Sadly, I agree
---
Stfu jew boy
---
Until they add Dream Snares on Windows that push the survivor back lol
---
Because on the inside of every killer, is a BABY killer
---
Plague is complete RNG she relies on survivors cleansing without them doing it she‚Äôs a 115% killer with no power that‚Äôs why she my least favorite killer
---
Don't see how. That dude gets bullied so easily. Any killer that can be looped can't be better than a killer that's impossible to loop along with decent map pressure.
---
I got mine because a killer let me go.  I've gotten quite a few achievements that way.  Unfortunately they cease to feel like an "achievement" when it happens.
---
Because a kill is a kill
---
Gee willikers batman good find
---
I should have also mentioned that it was said that her base kit may get tweaked
---
I agree.  Well, in that they should leave her alone.  Her skill cap is actually difficult enough that people who put in the time to learn her have usually earned the right to smash face.  
---
A pro nurse is *almost* uncounterable but how many of those even exist?  Most of the people that get on that level with her usually end up getting bored with her because of how much effort it takes to play her that consistently.
---
Glad to see someone mention the actual point of the clip
---
What should I start off doing
---
Yes, the clown is really a good killer
---
Start as killer or survivor, get a buddy to help you out in swf
---
I was about to ask this lol
---
Is the zappy boi finally get some lovin
---
Clown is better then Myers
---
lmao same though
---
Same issue here
---
F13 is garbage to DBD lmao
---
It‚Äôs not. It was co firmed that her base kit would likely be changed. And honestly an add-on rework is enough to decide the tier of a killer. Legions addons dont work and it plays a big part in why he‚Äôs garbage.
---
By getting the game
---
I had that happen to me with an insta-heal. It made me sad
---
OOF that lag though
---
Badass beard+wisdom+the name Jeff = Best survivor(story wise)
---
Yeah but if the survivors are dumb enough to buy into the "no cleanse meta" then your a 115% killer with built in Stridor who also one hits everyone. I don't understand why people think not cleansing hurts Plague. Whenever I play against survivors who refuse to cleanse I utterly and totally annihilate them.
---
This game can't even let you be the killer while matchmaking with friends you pathetic fuck.
---
someone should remind him he's supposed to go to the gates so he can get tbagged
---
NOED and Adrenaline have the same description and they work normally
---
*insert I think we did a pretty good job meme*
---
No. Maybe the hatch aura thing would be okay but it would have to be long range to be even remotely useful. The devs also aren‚Äôt gonna make another exit gate perk better than Quentin‚Äôs. If anything they‚Äôll buff it. And if left behind were to receive this change the killers would need a perk that does the same.
---
That cat looks frightened and angry at the same time, somehow.
---
He's right. If the spirit is using headphones and the player doesn't have iron will(90% of players don't) then it's a gg. Billy has map pressure but who cares when you just get looped anyway? Spirit is much better and does better in tournaments. It's proven.
---
Fantastic play! I always struggle with timing pallet saves!
---
Absolutely, just don't come here after your first matches ranting and being salty on how shit its to OP
---
Thank you! I got very lucky.
---
\*click\* Noice
---
Unpopular Opinion. 
---
But none of those, besides bunny feng. And yes I don‚Äôt care for the memes or the bad jokes.
---
Nea excluded
---
A lot of people hate to lose, they (mistakenly) think it reflects poorly on them. So they project their anger/frustration onto you.
---
I think what a lot of survivors forget is that dbd is a horror game, and in many ways a survival horror game. While there's a lot of skill that goes into playing as survivor, at the end of the day on a one on one encounter with the killer the survivor is *meant* to lose, not win.
---
I think a lot of people come into dbd with that "twitch" game mentality, where two players have a more or less equal footing (everyone has a gun, a sword, etc) and dbd isn't built that way. The design itself sends these kids into a pattern of toxicity.
---
Another game I play is Crusader Kings, a game with a notorious learning curve. Over there we have a phrase: losing is fun. Because in that game, you lose. A lot.
---
And as a survivor, you die... A lot. They just can't get over it.
---
At rank 15 you should know what the killer power is.
---
Ok, I agree she's better than nurse on console.
---
Because he has such a weapon compared to other killers. 
---
Half his weapon is a glove attached to his hand.
---
Not really, its still vaby ranks
---
I'd say Plague is upper-mid tier. She's a lot of fun to play as. Vomiting on everything and everyone is a blast, and she's pretty viable too up until you get to red ranks and then maybe you're better off playing Nurse, Spirit or Billy. 
---
Plague has an interesting dynamic where she pukes on survivors until their broken and then she can one hit them, but if the survivors cleanse themselves at fountains that spawn on the map when Plague's the killer she can consume those used fountains to gain Corrupt Purge for a limited time. Corrupt Purge works like the normal vomit except it injures the survivors on contact like you're hitting them instead of making them sick. So it's currently meta for survivors to not cleanse when going against Plague so she can't get Corrupt Purge. I personally think this meta is super dumb as it just allows Plague to one hit everyone as they'll be permanently broken, and they'll also be easier to track as they'll constantly be coughing and puking. If they do decide to cleanse though then you get a pretty powerful and fun projectile attack that can hit multiple survivors with one discharge and it can go over and around obstacles. 
---
I personally find Plague to be a pretty solid and fun killer. If you're interested in her then I recommend giving her a try.
---
Billy has better map pressure on open maps like coldwind. On smaller maps though like the Game or Lery's though Billy's saw sucks ass for map pressure theres just too many walls. Plus, putting Distressing on Spirit on a small map means they can never hear you phase. I think spirit is better than billy for this reason alone: billy has a few bad maps that he just sucks on, spirit is decent everywhere and an absolute monster on the maps shes good at.
---
I squat
---
I'd make it so all traps start on the map already armed so there's less hassle of "setup" and survivors can stumble into a trap from the outset of the match. 
---
Also, the ability to reset traps manually without picking up and replacing. Like you'd go up to a trap and hold M2, and the trapper would just re-set a disarmed trap. This is a MAJOR pain if you're already holding a trap. Placing the first one down, picking up and re-placing the disarmed trap, and then picking up the trap you had to set to make room is so frustrating and eats up alot of time considering disarming traps is pretty quick.
---
What would be the problem with just playing who you want and floating around in the good ranks? Does it really matter? If you can push a lower tier killer to top 5 tank then great. If you cant you cant. If you want to crush ranks you'll pick the best guys. Like anything else. Why should every killer be the best? (and even survivor for that matter, but there's not much difference there as it's all perks anyway).
---
Wow god damn how have I never seen someone mention distressing to take advantage of her phase noise deadzone being larger that's fuckin brilliant. Well said dude, damn you got me hype to get home and try that out
---
Tough one.
---
Plague seems,to me,like she would be the more interesting killer......buuutttt clown has pop and bamboozle.....
---
Depends on how bad you want those two perks i guess haha
---
Talk about a baby survivor. Hope your account gets banned
---
Happened to me before as nurse..the game just ended...
---
It's in case you want to have the aura reading capabilities without giving up full movement speed. I don't disagree that Scratched Mirror is a better add-on, but Vanity Mirror does have it's uses.
---
Very true. Also the slow vault works wonders against even great spirits. I use it all the time against her. Think I saw zubat use it first.
---
Thanks for the answer man I've just been playing and going against Freddy so much n his hit always looks to big.
---
They look like they are about to teleport behind you and preform a mori
---
Gates are also powered when the hatch is closed. Which can happen at 5 gens left.
---
1 That‚Äôs all I need to become your worst nightmare
---
Beware the madness
---
Console Nurse is still good, but she's just simply a lot better on PC. With a mouse you can do 180 and flick maneuvers with extreme precision that just aren't possible on a gamepad or are at best significantly more difficult. Regardless of platform though she is undeniably the best killer. She's just even better on PC.
---
His lunge seem really long. But I guess it just looks that way and isn‚Äôt actually that long :D
---
99.5-99.9%? Maybe.
---
Holly dwight, best post in this comunity so far
---
I had a game yesterday where the whole team had ruinitis and someone messaged me and tbagged me and said I deserved it cause I was targeting people with no gens done. Not my fault you're scared of gens.
---
Forgot this one. So thats why.
---
Thanks

I‚Äôm sorry man I feel you.  Take breaks and just leave as soon as you load into postmatch lobby.

I mean. This doesn‚Äôt seem to strange if you‚Äôve seen Nightmare on Elm Street 2

Because the game is fair
---
Best fucking meme on this subreddit
---
I'd say Plague is the better killer and is more fun to play, but that Clown comes with better perks.
---
Still doesn‚Äôt really make sense that rancor doesn‚Äôt activate. They should change it.
---
I don‚Äôt like this bs rift, we already have the DLCs
---
Yes
---
I hardly get any even when I run the 3-gen build.
---
Love how you did her bangs, very nice.
---
no need, I agree with yours except Plague should be In Huntresses Tier and Clown and Trapper should swap
---
Well to be fair, I haven't touched this game in months
---
The older speeds do get raised, they should call and get things up to date, they probably are getting the shaft. Get a faster plan, they are probably losing out on better deals, I use to work for a phone company and those fucks will say yah your grandfathered in but your rates will slowly rise over time and they won‚Äôt notice it. But the cell phone company is fucking them and laughing about it. I saw this all the time where I worked.
---
They should delete it... oh wait that won‚Äôt happen because if they did the game would be full of more bugs and probably start melting everyone‚Äôs cpu
---
Why is ghost face not there?
---
Matthew was right. People like you need to download civilization, lol.
---
I did this recently with a meg as ghostface.. I'm always nice with ghostface no clue why.

Because he's small, especially compared to other killers (though he still has the exact same average killer lunge). To be fair, from Freddy's perspective, it looks as though his claws elongate considerably when he strikes.
---
scroll to below Dead by Daylight, where it says start - keep scrolling to Friends | Communities and there are several communities which you can join. You should probably join he one with 80, 000 people, they have many people playing SWF and KYF and could help you if you asked them.

It is cause the killer was gonna do it anyway. They are just to cowardly to admit it.

What will you be banning sir?

Survivor mains: uhhh I‚Äôll take a noed

How original...

Killer mains: and a NOED

Dating today aren‚Äôt we?

You guys are getting teammates that do gens while you run the killer around?

I've heard Tinkerer is good against awake survivors.

What about huntress mains
---
Balanced and fun... for people who don't play the game much or are just extremely bad at the game? AKA rank 20s?
---
Meanwhile, we have a MUCH larger demographic (Killer players of ALL ranks) who are saying the game is not balanced (too many weak Killers that are reliant on Ruin) and not fun (Killers get bullied into Oblivion by Survivors who are way too good at the game)
---
Who should we focus on? A MUCH bigger section of the playerbase who frequently play the game? Or a minority of bad players who rarely play the game?
---
Genrush at high ranks, ruin required. Nurse Billy or Spirit at high ranks always, because that's what lets Killer players deal with the insane power Survivors have, even without SWF. Games last around 4 to 5 minutes there and a majority of the Killers are far too weak to stop red ranks and the genrush meta. 
---
Ruin is a bandaid for a problem at the games core. People would straight up leave this game if Ruin was nerfed or removed. Same deal as Self-Care.
---
Even Survivors are complaining by the way. I've seen some who are sick of seeing the same 3 Killers every game and wanted a new top tier. They hoped GF would be that top tier. Wasn't a top tier on PTB even after buffs and live, became even worse with the nerfs.
---
MANY people like the new Freddy as he is. Survivors included. You'd have to listen to morons to nerf Freddy now.
---
I don't care about rank 20 fun, they barely play the game. Why should the majority have to bend over backwards to appease a infrequent minority?
---
Thanks for the answer man explains that
---
Thry like children because huntress is still a child in her mind
---
I always find it funny when low rank players talk shit. If your'e so good why are you not ranked higher?
---
Is there a single video of it somewhere? I see the sense in someone not showing it off, so likely not, but I am still interested.
---
The season reset and I haven‚Äôt played in a while. And being good doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt get cucked by facecamping killers and inexperienced teammates.
---
It's definitely a meta mixup right now vs her. A lot of spirits will read it but the fact that you can force her to make a read is pretty strong, especially considering how many other mixups the survivor has.
---
One google search and I found it in the stores of several countries. What exactly did you search for?
---
I mean, so is micheal, clown, ghostface, legion
---
When he grabs you off a gen with that perk that makes his tier 1 terror radius 0

He looks so content with himself

Play the nurse. Your going to hate it for a while but mastering the nurse will help you rank up.

If you find joy in ruining the game for others, GTFO, we don‚Äôt want you here.

Okay, what do you call someone who dresses up as a dragon and goes to furry conventions, a furry
---
Looks like you've played FPSs before, try out The Huntress, you get throwing axes

Joel gets added as survivor

Wait that's actually a good idea

If you win and they cry just drink the tears, always fun stuff.

Ssooo...this shit is just confusing, and they should just simplify it. x_x
---
You fuckin' hit me with the pallet, **DICK!**
---
I‚Äôm not fucking stupid, I‚Äôm not going to attempt to play nurse
---
I call bullshit on you being a rank 1 killer. High level killers are ALWAYS destroyed by a SWF well organized voice group in high rank. It's brutal for killers in that rank with the add ons and gen rushing strats dead hard, decisive, borrowed time. At high level just to maintain you have to play only a handful of killers and even then get wrecked constantly. What's your steam name? Screenshot of your rank with your name?
---
Gongle
---
Why do you care to make such an assumption?
---
And that's why I use Franklin's, if you're gonna wait around the exit gate your items stay with me.
---
It was a joke
---
Wait a minute I've seen you before
---
No you havent
---
Im sure it does happen every single game. I rarely get teabaggers in my game so i cant say i believe you.
---
Trapper or Hillbilly. Both are simple enough for a first time player
---
On a lot of these posts about camping or not I just wish everyone streamed and put their video link in so we could actually judge if it‚Äôs camping or not. A lot of killers act like proxy isn‚Äôt a form of camping. If you keep coming back to the hook and the gate isn‚Äôt open then just admit you need to camp to get kills. Lmao
---
Ryanpez is a really good billy and mains him too
---
I was joking. Hence the "lol" he's the incarnation of evil and in the movies he's portrayed as something not human by his doctor. That's what I was joking about.

I mained nurse when I first started playing (the old nurse, before she could control her blink). I got to rank one and then I started playing other killers. I didn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúmindgames‚Äù are, what ‚Äúlooping‚Äù is, I played like a baby that someone got to a serious competition.
---
Starting as a Nurse is the biggest mistake you can make as it ruins your learning curve
---
That's like saying
---
"Okay you want to be a mechanic? We'll start you off learning how to take apart Bugatti to get that out way then we can do a '93 Camry
---
He‚Äôs been informed
---
So you say no to nurse but offer Freddy instead ? Lol he's pretty complicated now too.
---
That‚Äôs why they are at high ranks I tend to let survivors go/play for fun and goofing off rather than winning and my level progression is much slower but I get way less sweaty bullshit games
---
Bad luck I suppose but they depip for that.
---
I think they're dummy values because it was made in a tweet simulator.
---
You had like 99.7% and you need to be over 100
---
I just play this game about 20h but i feel freddy really easy to use ecspecially after his rework
---
I'd say it's 40/60 with 40 being the percentage of having 1 teabagger in the game.
---
He's too high-up on your screen, so you weren't revealing as much as you could have. The game basically counts the percentage of him visible within the reveal zone, which is the center of your screen, so it probably wasn't counting the top of his body. You want him as close to the center of your screen as you can without blocking his model with your own.
---
Additionally the timer resets when you stop revealing him, so its possible it got reset at the start when he moved out of the center of your screen. It's important to keep him in the middle the whole time.
---
Well yeah then the Camry will be a peice of cake
---
i don‚Äôt actually have a fursuit or fursona so i don‚Äôt do any of that 
---
art is just cool and enjoying things is also cool
---
Short weapon and a small body. All killers (other than Myers on tiers 1 and 3) have the same lunge distance and hitboxes,
---
Thats not how humans work...
---
You don't do college before you do high school.

It was given out by another streamer but is no longer available.

Bikini Clown is the way

yes, that exactly
---
&gt;not stutter stepping to delay your visibility animation 
---
Lol
---
That's probably the worst comparison I have ever heard.
---
Interesting
---
And all I‚Äôm saying is run bbq and chilli and get four stacks. Will get you double bloodpoints and if you want you can tunnel after the second hook. I really can‚Äôt help but think you are a proxy camper with your shrug of the shoulders attitude so I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and assume you tunnel even without insta saves. Which is a safe assumption.
---
Nah, he definitely isn't as good as PC nurses. That's literally impossible with how slow the sensitivity is.
---
Yeah, sadly that's just how it goes. I've had many games where I played really bad and all the gens got done extremely fast, I only got one or two hooks, then they all go into the exit gate and teabag thinking they're good or funny. It used to really annoy me (Like this one game I'll post in a reply. It tilted me super hard at the time lol) but now since I play Ghostface mainly, I look at it more like a teabag challenge. And considering they don't squeak, I deem myself as the best teabagger in the lobby. I know they're trying to BM me, but it's pretty fun showing you could care less, even if you didn't get a single hook and all four are teabagging at the exit gate.
---
My advice, look at it in a more comedic way like I did. The game has way too many toxic people, so I try to just ignore it, or look at it in my own stupid way
---
Hey idk if i can post links here but i adapted the resolution of the icons for the game and set up a zip so all you need to do is replace the original icon folder with the one in the zip. I included credits to you, u/OsukaTheOracleTurret . I'll try posting the link, hoping it doesn't get removed

Should have been Enduring &amp; Spirit Fury

I think monitor is better than distressing. Let's you get really close for a free hit and also increases your terror radius in chases which is what you want.

Ash and Freddy must never meet, the snark would implode reality.
---
I tend to see more salt when it comes to survivors, I got gen rushed and didn‚Äôt pip but I still said gg, but some guy got mad at me because I killed him because he ran to me after he got unhooked. The other survivors were nice tho, they knew I got gen rushed hard. I haven‚Äôt seen much killer salt, probably because I‚Äôm a killer main. And if I do get teabagged, I‚Äôm going to nod or teabag back at them if ghostface or pig lol.
---
Yeah, it's pretty dumb but the Devs are aware of it. Just be happy that wasn't Devour Hope lololol

Some people go down to a nurse because they are anticipating a blink. It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre being really bad, probably just confused

If you cannot understand from that the point is you need to learn the ropes before you tackle something advanced, then I cannot help you
---
Even if you did nothing but hide in a locker? Because I just went through a game where I made a save did a gen and ran the killer for 3 gens, one guy did nothing, escaped and I still had more points than he/she did. I got off the hook once with Deliverance, after that, they hid in lockers on my second hook. Not even an attempt to save me or at least do a gen.
---
They camp during the end game because forcing the altruism can be the difference between winning or losing as killer
---
Yeah but finding it in the bloodweb is another story
---
I know Myers has longer tier 3 lunge but is it shorter in tier 1
---
Likely cause theres 4 survivors so there is a higher chance that one is an asshole. Trust me theres plenty of killer salt and i dont see anything wrong with gen rushing AKA doing the objective.
---
i was playing killer and this happened to a survivor, I thought he was taunting me w/ a bug but he was actually stuck.
---
It‚Äôs not even the original music though
---
Don't show no mercy on any Survivors because the moment you do expect what you got. The salt in this game is so rich I haven't played as much because of how bitter people are at high ranks, ruins the fun.
---
I swear. Every fucking time...
---
He has next to no lunge in tier 1
---
Just stop playing if you have so many issues with it. We all know there are things that need to be fixed, but we play it as anyways.  This is honestly the first game that has held my attention for so long. Usually I play a game for a couple of weeks and move on, but I've been playing this one for months everyday.
---
Why do people do this? Soon as they finish the game, they come on here and enter 'diary entry #38' and proceed to get downvoted to the ground. Get over it and move on.
---
Just take a break, I am. I can understand how it can be bad especially in toxicity but taking a break helps.
---
Not nearly as hard. If the hag is smart she will place traps in places where you have to run during the chase or take a hit by crouching over it.
---
This is so freaking perfect
---
Big oof
---
I mean, that‚Äôs just how the BW has always been...never gives you the one perk you really want lol
---
The reality of it is that even the dev team has no idea or backstory created, and it will never be created or revealed to the playerbase. They loosely stitched together something they didnt even really need to explain in order to provide narrative context as to why players can keep playing matches over and over again.
---
You mean BBQ and hex ruin
---
The pig mains and their oinks üòÇ
---
The big question: will this affect trophies?
---
don't make the killer dc next time
---
Calling people salty by making a post where you‚Äôre clearly salty, ok
---
It was a legit hit tho. That‚Äôs what you get for camping pallets like a moron
---
But they stated clearly that they didnt do it, are you new to the internet?
---
I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with gen rushing too, but if yalls gonna do it, I‚Äôm also going to try and get a kill early on so I can try and win. And most of the asshole killers would probably be rank 20-12 killers since they aren‚Äôt good and resort to face camping and tunneling imo.
---
I kind of like these ideas. The first one I think is a bit much. Imo it should be 1.5x more. It's pretty lame that you can play a game for ten to fifteen minutes and barely walk out with enough for a level up. Hell, a million bloodpoints is only enough for roughly leveling a character from level one to thirty five. I'd like to see the bloodpoint payout be increased a bit. Gets pretty tedious when you play ten games but only get enough for four or five level ups and still not get anything good.
---
For the SWF part, I kinda like the idea, but I think that's a tiny bit too small. Two percent at high ranks will buy you literally 1.6 seconds
---
Urban evasion doesn't make Hags power useless, you're going to have to run eventually
---
Lmao. I guess it wasn‚Äôt fair for a level 18 against level 13s and 12s
---

---
No. Contact bhvr.

Since I get teabaggers almost every game I can‚Äôt say that believe that you don‚Äôt.... lol i don‚Äôt know what you think my motivations would be to lie about this BUT I respect your opinion and it‚Äôs possible that to me it just seems like there‚Äôs a teabaggers. Marijuana is almost always involved so there‚Äôs that. But I am going to pay more attention to find out lol.
---
There enough pallets and windows that 1 survivor can keep a killer busy for the entire time it takes the other 3 to fix all 5 gens. Which is about 4 minutes. 
---
This game is incredibly slanted in the survivors favor, and while getting face camped for that 1 person sucks, the killer loses the match because of it.
---
Jesus man that sucks. Honestly they should jusy give you everything in the game rn
---
Ahhhh, this reminds me of two days ago when I get heavily insulted by Old Man Bill. I was messing around with the wife (Ghostface) and I downed the Bill. I hook him, and literally three seconds after I hooked him, someone unhooks him and the Bill runs right by me (yes, run into the nice man wearing a creepy white mask and black robes with a combat knife while you're clenching onto life), and his savior runs the other way (instead of taking a hit). He runs me to Killer shack, and I down him again. I put him in the basement, patrol across the map for a bit and no one is working on gens, so I decide to go back. He got unhooked and runs right into the front door, where I was happily standing with my knife. I down him, the other dude is nowhere in sight. I hook him again and he's dead. After the game, he said, "Lol when ruin fails tunnel". I tried to explain to him that running into the killer when being unhooked is not smart. He tried to call me terrible and claim he was better because I was a rank eleven and he was a rank four. It went back and forth from him insulting me as a Killer and insulting my mother while I was calmly telling him to take a nice warm bath to calm down and how it's not smart to be unhooked then run right in the Killer's face while your team refuses to take hits for him.
---
Moral of the story, don't have a superiority complex, and don't run into the Killer after getting unhooked and somehow think I'm just gonna let you run past me while I have no clue where anyone else is
---
Did you just delete this because of one comment?
---
You'd think. But apparently that's impossible or some shit.
---
Does it matter what age or no
---
Nah I don't proxy camp, but the people I've been playing against have an unbelievable urge to unhook before I even bounced, I'll admit that I survey the area for a good 15 secs and start searching around gens but people are just dumb af
---
Possibly, but what if he's fun?
---
Give us late game piggy back and we'll be all square  :)
---
Someone just got sacrificed by Freddy.
---
Smart
---
Also I hope bbq &amp; chilli pops up in the shrine soon
---
No problem.
---
This shit happens too often, hopefully survivors realize one day that half the shit that happens to them in a match is their fault
---
Super ultra mega rare add-on
---
Yeah, lately I've been using it but it doesn't push me forward. It just puts me in exhaustion. Best bet is to just switch it for Lithe or Balanced Landing for the time being
---
Yea its possible ive got that daily yesterday and today, not sure what I did to complete them...just kinda played "normally".
---
Awh shi you‚Äôre right :( 
---
Sorry
---
True
---
Guess you could say he likes to pig out on those baguettes!
---
GOTTA GO FAST!!!
---
This seems to come up a lot, and while I agree I don't run it, I also NEVER check gens when killer and its 1 left. Might not be as many points as escape cuz you might get caught, but popping a gen real fast if you know where the hatch is and the killer doesn't know where it is, doesn't seem a terrible waste, y'know? Is it meta or even mid? No, but I'd still run it sooner than "shoot me in the face" No Mither.
---
Oh thanks
---
HA 
---
I can't play rn cause I got work in the morning, but I should be available after I get back home if you want to play.
---
I think they have mentioned doing something about it. They realize that it's getting to be such a problem that it needs to be addressed
---
Thanks dude!
---
I totally agree. I think the devs are creating the lore as they go along. Hopefully, The Archives will give us more insight!
---
Ikr? My thoughts exactly! It'd be so dope if she was actually a blind hatchet thrower.
---
What time do you usually get back from work?
---
This is really Epic. A well written theory and 100% valid. Bravo!
---
I get that but man when I see those clocks I die a little inside.
---
Nurse is extremely tedious to fight. Also, Nurse on The Game is just not fun or fair at all
---
I love the legion too! They're backstory is excellent and what adds on to it is the fact that you can choose to be any one of them. I also think that the aesthetic they have is what makes them great and fits right in with they're backstory, like Frank is wearing the mask mockingly to show that he's actually the opposite. The others follow with there own versions of Frank's outfits I think because they want to show how dedicated they are to following him or because they fear disobeying him. Could just be for the group outfits tho and I'm just overthinking it lol
---
I realize I can't properly theorize what The Trapper's lore is with such inconsistent lore. What are your thoughts/theories?
---
Going to it and pressing the skill check button
---
Nice write up, i enjoyed reading this. 
---
I'm really looking forward to getting new tidbits of info in the archive system. For too long old killers have sat untouched and their lore has been stagnant.
---
They did skins for the pig and ghostface.

From my own personal experiences, I don't get many hate messages at all. But even if it was PC with the endgame chat, it's still not as bad as stuff like DOTA and Xbox 360 days of CoD
---
Really good strategy that's pretty much what I do in the endgame. Play as if the killer has NOED so I cut down on risky plays and rely more on stealth.
---
Clearly a fake post in attempt to get a leveled account for free. Lol at the people believing this guy
---
That sounds like something only a furry would know
---
Bro both Freddy's were pedo's lol
---
Isn't this freddies current power of hitting a survivor and they get disconnected
---
She isn't fun or she isn't middle tier?
---
They're fixing that stuff, from what I heard. I guess they're taking the average levels of Survivors. Also, that's just what SWF can be sometimes. It's brutal, especially when playing groups past rank eight
---
This is a very meta post
---
Me when the killer is hard patrolling the gen I had almost finished.
---
Thanks, I'm not that good at time
---
All they really need to do is make maps less RNG generated and put more static structures that provide more options for both killers and survivors. If you look at a game like TF2 or Overwatch, the maps are static and within the same game mode, all play fundamentally the same, it's just those same parts are organized in such a way that forces, rewards, or discourages certain kinds of game play. If that's what you are referring to as being "game innovative", than I agree with you. But not every map needs it's own distinct mechanic that only applies to that particular map. I would be totally down with a complete map restructuring in DBD where they create maps with more static elements with set pallet spawn locations, but the actual pallets and generator locations randomized. That would allow them to remove the large numbers of frustrating maps from the game and have easier control over how map dependent killers such as Billy or Huntress are able to function.

Well, you are assuming they are burnt out and not just corrupted black or any number of things the Entity is capable of. It could be that being touched by the Entity has a virulent effect on things and we can see that clearly through the Fog itself with the haphazard and sloppy way it reproduces things from the real world.   
---
Nothing says they are burnt out in the lore and her model in-game clearly shows some small points of light.

Counterpoint from someone who plays survivor and killer: Freddy is fun to play as and against

---
I've never actually seen a cat do this.
---
Bruh How could I mess that up. and yeah one time I managed to actually get to evil within 3 using Fragarant tuft of hair. And Tombstone the game turned in my favor real quickly that add on is just so powerful at the expense of most likely getting to tier 3 when there are 1 or 2 gens left.
---
Did it go back after you stopped running?
---
Ok confused?
---
That blows. This happened to both of is within the same 20 or 30 mins you were also on xbox?
---
Oof, that's a Derpface FAIL moment.
---
The symbol is a perk called make your choice.

PS4. Logged in right after rank reset, played earlier today to grind to Rank 7 and was stacked as usual. Troubleshooting has failed, and I really prefer not to grind out my teachables again, as well as rely on web RNG for ruin and shit.
---
No i know that. You cant answer the phone and play?
---
Unfortunately yes
---
Specifically when the survivor just put down the god pallet without completing a single loop in the shack.
---
Thank you so much for the detail. Thats what im aiming for now but this game grinding killer so long so i think i need few months to do
---
Ikr

CONGRATULATIONS! you made yourself look like a douche bag, a narcissist, and an idiot in just 5 sentences! Bravo MATE üëè
---
Dude posted about having a stressful experience because of salty survivors and it was keeping him from being able to enjoy playing as Killer. My comment was about how I feel about salty survivors, and about the fact that I always enjoy playing as the Killer &amp; why. Yet you say I bring nothing to the conversation. IT IS THE CONVERSATION lol= IDIOT‚úîÔ∏è
---
When I talked about always winning with the spirit and usually do well with the other killers, you threw shade!  it was far from saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a god at this game and I‚Äôm the only one that‚Äôs good at it‚Äù but then YOU DID THE SAME but you had to assert your ‚Äúgodly killing prowess‚Äù by throwing up (win being 4K)= NARCISSIST ‚úîÔ∏è
---
So it seems to me that it was your post that doesn‚Äôt bring anything to the conversation. You strike me as a wannabe ninja-troll that desperately scrolls threw posts looking for anything that might give you an opportunity to make yourself look cool and funny but in reality all you really do is make yourself look like a pathetic DOUCHEBAG‚úîÔ∏è
---
And if you always win as the Killer and your not having fun that just means YOU don‚Äôt enjoy being the killer. 
---
It‚Äôs called being a survivor main. It doesn‚Äôt mean being the killer isn‚Äôt fun for everyone. I HATE playing survivor I think it‚Äôs boring, and I hate the thought of being this weak and fragile thing. BUT that doesn‚Äôt mean that playing as the survivor sux for everyone. It‚Äôs called being a Killer main 
---
.
---
It's more like a buzzcut
---
Daubeny show yourself!!!
---
Dying on a hook, you?
---
Stfu, im trying to hide
---
Yeah, a derank button could be abused. Imagine a rank 1 guy deranking to rank 20 for easy points. Hell, don't some people throw games to get lower ranks?
---
If your referring joke build as in basement LF its fun at first but everyone just DC's or kills themselves when they know what your doing
---
New killer + Freddy buff + survivor nerfs + no new survivor = More Killers/ fewer Survivors = Worse killer queue times
---
GG Behaviour, I haven't played the game in 3 weeks because the queue times have been so bad, and they just keep getting worse
---
Also using both of the add-ons that reduces tantrum stun its fun just going around whacking shit and doing it really fast
---
Nah I'm not going to use Bubba's basement my messege requests are already clogged with your bad at the game and uninstall to staright up KYS
---
Yeah same lol happens to me everyday
---
Dang
---
How is double bloodpoints = toxic? All that offering means is that their survivor is over level 10.
---
That being said, it wold be interesting to see some kind of matchmaking based on your character level(as well as rank)
---
You know this is sweet and all but Huntress is a Russian who grew up in the woods with only one person to talk to and also in the 1930-40 so the chance she even knows English is slim, also isn‚Äôt Nea Swedish? I‚Äôm very disappointed in the inconsistency cues in lore.
---
I'd honestly like to see them rework leatherface and make him a bit more different from billy you could ask anyone and alot would say Chainsaw Sprint is better then Chainsaw Tantrum.
---
Doc giggle is more cute than pig pallet stun.
---
He just sounds so happy!
---
Idk if there are actual numbers to support it. But everyone agrees killer queues are crazy right now which would imply there is actually an abundance of killers.
---
Yeah, but it said normal human.  I assume it's referencing the disfigurement of a lot of them (or unnaturally large stature).
---
They said in a Q&amp;A that the nurses add ons are first then they said maybe LF
---
Eh, deranking should be mildly punishing/tedious in my opinion.
---
Not cleansing is only good if you do it to speed up gens. Getting all 4 people broken is a good way to start a slugfest
---
Yea. I played against him a few times and it didnt go amazing but i had a good time
---
I find Freddy both fun to play as and against. I'm not sure where the annoyance comes from for you.
---
Generator teleporting is limited map control that gets worse as the game goes on (because there's less generators to teleport to). It also has a five second warning for the survivor. It's fair.
---
Dream snares have the same stats as Clown's default bottles. They can slow you down, maybe rob you of some loops, but usually all you need to do is drop the pallet early. Dream pallets are entirely map-reliant as some maps make them super useless, like the farm maps.
---
For the most part he is a M1 killer who can teleport sometimes, and he doesn't need a nerf. Would you rather go back to Spirit/Nurse/Billy 24/7?
---
Their nerfing nurses add-ons? At least their not touching Nurse herself. I've seen the forms  while I like the posts alot of the survivors form is people whining about killers. Which leads to stuff like this which I don't like.
---
The only community more toxic that I have personally encountered is sea of thieves.
---
i have been selected :3
---
but there is really no instructions on how to join it .. do i just log in at the specified period of time or i have to download a separate beta build ?
---
Idk about nerfing they just mentioned how most of them arent that good and she also doesnt have any Ultra-Rare add ons
---
Really don't think nurse needs this she's fine the way she is other then needing some ultra rares and some buffs to some of her lower end add ons
---
You forgot the hag: the disgusting spawn of nurse and trapper.
---
Bill and Unbreakable
---
mmmm... False. I'm going with false.
---
Love your name
---
On PS4,skill check button is L1 whereas Interact(close hatch) is R1.
---
Ah.. then it's just something with Xbox.
---
it's 3 free gens if the other survivors know what's going on and play at max efficiency. then there are still 2 gens with only 3 people.
---
"Just do gens" has never been a real counter to facecampers.
---
A brief note on why I consider the killers I do F tier and their powers useless:
---
* Ghostface: Very easy to reveal, good survivors won't fall for Night Shroud chase mindgames, basically a powerless killer most of the time
---
* Legion: Power is useless against injured survivors, power lost a lot of chase strength after the nerfs, basically a powerless killer most of the time
---
* Leatherface: Much easier to force M1s out of than Hillbilly, doesn't have Billy's mobility and gets punished for using his power with the self tantrum, once again basically a powerless killer most of the time
---
* Pig: Traps most often don't actually waste much time or that much of a deterrent, Lunge becomes highly situational after the first in the game, especially now that it's not considered a normal attack, you guessed it, basically a powerless killer most of the time
---
While stalking he has no collision, you could've just run through him and at least prevented the stalking, which would make life easier for you in the future and all your teamates...
---
 I think Spirit is situational against SWF. If they all have Iron Will you'd have trouble against a SWF. She's good in high ranks tho.
---
This is so true. I will be in a swf game, I tell my teammate not to run after I get them off of hook, because it is a hag, the first thing they do when they get off of hook, is dash and trigger all of the hag‚Äôs traps. Then we die.
---
Those tiers are really off
---
Rank reset is a great thing for picking up new killers. It's the 13th of every month. Honestly, what I'd do is just say "feck it, I'm sticking it." Playing against good players is the fastest, but most painful way to learn. Failure is the best teacher, and an easy experience teaches you almost nothing.
---
Jake and saboteour
---
Why did you run into a corner??
---
I've been enjoying using Save The Best For Last with Pig and I'll use my ambush on the obsession to not lose counters
---
The Clapper was great, once!
---
That's what I've been saying, who the hell nerfed Bubba? Who asked for it? Ok yeah I know that once you are way too close it's pretty much game over, but that's your fault for letting him near you. Also the ruin thing is real, I wish for a gen regression buff since the devs said that 80 seconds is enough to complete a gen
---
Hey man I'd be happy to play sometime. I'm rank 16 with ~20 hours and I'm looking to find people to grind with. Add me on discord estoymuybien#6969
---
His power was clapping. Whenever a survivor  did something stupid he clapped making them get blinded
---
Oh God I still don't have Franklin's
---
who're you talking to I am calm? don't start ish with me on here troll.
---
That is pretty petty, doesn't really make you any better than the Dwight. Just ignore it, you will play better.
---
A good Spirit is either not going to be affected by Iron Will or they'll be running Stridor which after the sound updates completely counters Iron Will.
---
Explain?
---
Nurse: is hard to use. if I get sacrificed by a player using the nurse, its respectable.
---
Spirit: also hard to use. I have nothing against her, I win some I lose some.
---
Hillbilly: chainsaw makes me shit myself and isn't an op killer.
---
Huntress: hatchets are annoying, and her humming can fuck off, but otherwise a fine killer no OPness there.
---
Hag: is not particularly hard but you have to focus for her. NOT OP.
---
Freddy: Game does his job for him, requires no skill.
---
My point is that these killers above require people to place there hands on there keyboards/controllers and play.
---
Literally the first killer to make me dc from a game.
---
Xenomorph: after injuring a survivor from a healthy state they get the "infected" status. 30 seconds after the infected status the killer can spawn (teleport) out of that character
---
Want a wahmburger and some fresh cries lil biotch
---
Her power can still be countered. In chases you can't counter Hags power because you aren't going to flashlight Hag's traps or UE over her traps either. A good killer can easily turn the game around with their power (except for m1 killer powers and Doctor/Wraith) if they know how to use it correctly.
---
That‚Äôs impossible,I feel like the killer let you do that.
---
Since Killer closing hatch triggers endgame and you would pretty much be dead if you were the only one left.
---
*Reads trough comments*
---
I‚Äôm disappointed on how it was done,but I respect the killer for being nice and wanting some BP
---
Exactly people get annoyed when killers legit see them waiting for them to leave it‚Äôs quite obvious I was camping this guy because the rest of her team were being stupid this guy was taunting and T bagging and I instantly killed the guy behind a tree because they were trying to bait me away it‚Äôs not called camping it‚Äôs called common sense lol
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you just quit the game after 30minutes? Or just spend 5 minutes and farm to give the man what he wanted
---
The pig and Ghostface are owned by completely different companies. And their skins were very serious in time, nothing like the gloriousness of Shirtless Myers.
---
You Also Get Less Points For Proximity To Hooked Survivors, And As Someone Who Alternates Between Killer/Survivor I Dont Think I've Ever Facecamped, Sure I Tunnel That Fucking Nea Every Now And Then But Fuck Facecamping.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
That's not a trial, that's an execution.
---
Haha, exactly man! And I play both sides as well, enjoy them both, busy leveling up my Trapper!
---
/u/peanits forward this to the lore team lol
---
Seems more likely to me that the devs, in an effort to avoid making the lore too wordy, meant that Archie told Evan to kill the miners, and Evan merely acted on his orders. It doesn't seem likely to me that a senile man lead multiple men into a mine, set the charges and detonated them. Plus, the lore keeps hammering home the idea that Trapper was essentially his father's enforcer.
---
The devs have stated that Trapper's horrific injuries are from The Entity.
---
Honestly, Trapper's lore needs the biggest overhaul of them all. It's so damn vague.
---
Maybe you're just trash at dealing with him
---
I Just Bought Freddy After The Rework So I'm Busy With That
---
The same thing could be said for the pigs addon Amandas letter. Survivers think that they can hide nearby while the pig is crouched. If they underestimate the killer because it's the pig  they give up a easy first hit. If anything they should be at least on the same level.
---
Walking though an opening in the middle of the map and being surprised when you get revealed, then never playing the killer again is the biggest IQ move
---
Against bad rank killers? S tier - Low tank killers aren‚Äôt good at knowing which pallets are real/fake, and get really screwed.
---
Against good rank killers? Mid tier - Gets looped hard still. Snares are a decent addition to him and he has pretty good map pressure but he loses the pressure quick from getting looped. Might still catch a survivor or two in fake pallets if they‚Äôre not that good.
---
Against SWF? Low tier - They can call out pallet locations during chases to let each other know where real/fake are. They can discuss where to meet to wake each other up so they don‚Äôt have to deal with fake pallets. Basically, he gets hard looped 
---
So overall I‚Äôd say mid tier
---
for both sides, man it is so boring as an insta-down huntress i had like 7 head and 4 belts but i couldnt make it through the 1st game
---
Tremendous lol
---
MOOOOOOOORTY!
---
RIIIIIIIIIIICK!
---
I CAN FEEL MY IQ RISING
---
Shirtless Jane or bust
---
Yes, it's extremely fun. You should try  it. Especially when revving the chainsaw as LF
---
I Hate You
---
Well, now it‚Äôs proven.
---
Only works below rank 10. Survivors will hear the one blink at the start of the match and know exactly what you're doing.
---
Jeff, he has history as a rocker type/bad boy
---
Wouldn't it be nice if people would stop bringing this stupid "us vs them" mentality to unrelated posts. Anyways if knowing makes you feel any better, i just unlocked jane a few days ago and got her to about level 36. After her i only need to unlock and level up 4 more survivors.
---
That flashlight belonged to the guy that died. Im not gonna bring a flashlight when i use plunderer....
---
You know you love me &lt;3
---
I'm sure you've looked into this plenty but I just want to ask why the doctor is so low, because although idk a crazy amount about the game in depth. Surely a few years of playing the game can back my opinion up to say that from my experience he's quite broken. Playing against him has been quite difficult unfortunately it was usually against trash killers so I still survived, but whenever I played him the true potential shined. Just by walking by a survivor at the beginning they scream and you've already commenced a Chase right away and it just continues. Until everyones dead and one person might get lucky and get hatch because they've been avoiding teammates all game and letting them die. My grammar is horrible, sorry.

What I‚Äôm most excited for with the addition of the archive is the thought of kate performing in a cutscene
---
It‚Äôs Jeff
---
It should just be down 3/4 marked survivors like how it it is for most instadown killers.The leaning is a bit too much and the way they word it makes it sound extremely complicated.
---
Top 5 on pc= nurse, hillbilly, huntress, spirit. In no particular order. Freddy's decent now that he's got anti-loop tools, but he's only about the same as clown.
---
/r/PartyParrot
---
Can I say amazing use of the actual movie where Ghostface is from. Scream, great movie....however now it's cheesy...
---
not enough watermarks. sure you got ifunny in there but I'm sure there could have been 2 more easily
---
Its odd how centered it needs to be when he's clearly within few and im staring at him. Thanks for the info!
---
I will speak for Neakind, Chase me you cunt.
---
Where's the Tapper? The nasty uncle who taps everybody6 ass in the family?
---
haha you poor bastard, what did you have to cut?
---
THAT IS THE SEX POSTION! THEY WILL HAVE SEX?!!
---
Jason's the only force that could stabalize that kind of concoction.
---
if only this were an actual comic series
---
I don‚Äôt wanna be a party pooper, but in the DbD lore Amanda‚Äôs pig head is literally stuck on to her. It can‚Äôt be removed. And also, obligatory Nea is the entity and not a normal human.
---
You did it, you stopped disconnecting!
---
It's Jeff, the skin was leaked forever ago
---
Huntress, Michael, ghost face, clown, trapper, all of the legion are all normal.
---
Not to be rude, but in what world is that Bill
---
All y'all on reddit take shit too seriously lmao I was joking
---
I've always thought alien would be a great addition. Predator's lore however is that he will only attack people who are armed, so it really wouldnt make much sense as to why the predator is just hunting survivors, despite how awesome it would be.
---
If you think I‚Äôm playing Haddonfield when a survivor uses an offering for it, you‚Äôre out of your mind.
---
I only due it to toxic assholes, idc about the match if i can piss you off and waste your time
---
if it's that bad, you knock down the unhooked survivor and then chase after the farmer UNLESS you're being bullied. It's a game, don't get so immersed that you forget you're not the only person playing the game.
---
Using his power to scare survivers off gens
---
Bring I think survivors need to get nerfed and this is just plainly wrong. The game has a required ladder for matchmaking, it should be balanced
---
Look at the flair!
---
Thanks.
---
\^
---
Well yeah of course keep the game the same with the randomization I just want more innovative maps. ‚ÄúThe game‚Äù is a good example of a dlc map that is innovative, innovative meaning it enforces a different type of gameplay for said map. Doesn‚Äôt have to be wildly gamebreaking but it‚Äôs different enough to add spice to the game.
---
If you think I‚Äôm playing Killer when a survivor uses perks, you‚Äôre out of your mind.
---
If it‚Äôs not phrased as a joke how do you expect people to think it‚Äôs a joke?
---
I‚Äôve always thought she was intellectually equivalent to Bubba. They both do what they‚Äôre told because they‚Äôre stuck in this child-like mindset with the sheer brutality that comes from being oversized adults. The entity rewards her for following a command and she responds with uneducated blind obedience.
---
Yep. My comment was downvoted by a butthurt survivor who expects killers to just walk away after seeing them. Pathetic some of them, lol.
---
LOL what on Earth makes you think this is an "us vs them" thing? I feel like you've just seen that said on this sub and now you're trying to make up a bullshit comment with it. It's not one of those situations. I'm telling you, as a fellow survivor, that your build is shit.
---
the killer's job is not to *kill* but to sacrifice survivors to the entity so it can feed off their emotions. if you kill off survivors as fast as you possibly can, they don't have much *hope* to give the entity, which displeases the entity. 
---
It's important that you drop the "it's my job to kill" meme, because killing survivors off as fast as possible takes away from your pips an your BP. The best way to play as survivor is to extend the match as long as you can before you start killing.
---
Pig is better than wraith.  Pig is at least D tier.  Also, Huntress without Iri head still gets bodied by high rank SWF and is way too map dependent.
---
nah, opposite. surv sucks pretty hard atm.
---
Myers
---
Killer mains ego gets very easily bruised lol
---
Future tips for making memes:
---
-Make sure the joke is obvious
---
-Eliminate all of the white space
---
-Just dont
---
Totally the same thing. 
---
Great comparison.
---
His lore actually is his only attack‚Äôs prey armed or not as long as it‚Äôs a fair fight and most survivors are actually very fit and young
---
Walter
---
You get less BP and you are less likely to pip if you tunnel. Extend the match as long as you can so both sides have a chance to have fun, instead of rushing your objective and making the match turn toxic.
---
Okay than I got that wrong. But yeah these were the best perks i had on jane. Also its still unrelated to the post.
---
Fuck You Daubeny 1v1 me the ring warden v warden
---
Surveillance had been amazing on Freddy. Great synergy with his teleportation. Between that and pop it really helps keep the pressure on.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried it yet but It seems like thrilling tremors would also synergize very well.
---
Been watching a ton of vids on the new Freddy, he seems really fun to play with, and really terrible to play against üòÇ I personally can't get past 3 gens against him with randoms.
---
It's still the killer who decides to take advantage of it. The survivor who gets farmed has no choice in the matter, why should they be punished for something they have no control over?
---
I've been getting pretty unlucky and I've only versed Freddy twice so far :/
---
They literally said "Technical issues"
---
Great one of my friends gonna find this and  put on discord because he is obsessed with Nea so much I think we need to put him down.
---
Survivor: Claudette for self care, David for dead hard, Meg for adrenaline (in that order)
---
Killer: Hag for ruin, Leatherface for BBQ and chili (in that order) and then Billy for enduring, spirit for  spirit fury, nurse for nurses, and doctor for M&amp;A (in any order depending on which perks you need most for your ‚Äúmain‚Äù)
---
I dont play warden, warden is just bash spam
---
Not a comparison
---
Yes dedicated servers will fix this
---
I mean in the movies it shows him not killing people who literally have no weapons (girl in first movie didnt get attacked even though she was hanging with the beefiest group in the jungle), unless you're using the comics and sequels which im not too well versed in.
---
Either way i think he'd be a sick addition to the game.
---
Dummy values or not, good touch
---
Mid tier.  High rank SWF still bullies him most of the time.  Can't be high tier if you get bullied in high ranks.
---
We're Bills sir, we're expendable!
---
Is it inspired by hybridpanda?
---
lol
---
The devs have nerfed windows and pallet placements so much that there haven't been any infinite loops in the game for a little while, unless you count lampkin lane balanced landing infinites.
---
Classic
---
are u sure about that ?
---
the email i got says 
---
"The password to access the Private Test Build will be sent out prior to the beginning of the experiment"
---
so i guess there should be some kind of procedures to do before logging in .
---
Like old Freddy; Hit them after they fall asleep. This can be either the second hit of a chase (you hit them to sleep then hit them again) or if you catch them already asleep, the first hit. I had the daily so I decided to pay attention to the scoring events and that's when it proced.
---
üòÇüëçüèº
---
It's too bad Behavior couldn't get the rights to the film, but the COSTUME, so they can't make any movie references, even slight, or else they'll get their balls sued off.
---
you shoud use Ruin for slow the game down just a little bit, M&amp;A for getting to tier 2 as fast as possible and also can help for getting to tier 3, PWYF for compesate the speed you lose for the tombstone and get the kills easier once you get to tier 3, and for the last perk you should run Brutal Strenght or Bamboozle for countering the looping.
---
DUUUUUUUUUD
---
What if you do a pro-gamer move and hook them near a gen though? do you have to avoid the gen? what about between gens? its just positioning and not camping but it would seem like they were proxy camping
---
How did you stun huntress so quickly? /s
---
Noo.... 
---
Shhhhhhh!
---
‚ÄúLegion is basically powerless‚Äù
---
&gt;puts pig lower than him
---
~What? In my experience pig is low-A to high-B tier, you‚Äôre just ban with her lol
---
Or Catch 1 Instead Of Facecamping The Other To Death You Prick
---
That bubba build should not even be a thing.
---
You Play "Lawbringer" Don't You

As a Franklin's Demise myers all I can say is:

---
I may lose, but when I hit someone they lose too, even with white wards.
---
Honestly the real offense here is them using monstrous
---
Hit the gen and move onto the next gen/survivor? It‚Äôs not rocket science. A lot of killers waste time checking lockers, setting traps, etc. and pretend they‚Äôre being efficient when actually camping. But then they show their true colors by lurking around the hook. It‚Äôs okay to admit you need to camp but don‚Äôt act like that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre doing.
---
Nope
---
I pat the cat
---
Don't worry, this year is health year for the game, bugs will be crushed, everything will be fixed. And in year 4 they gonna fix those bugs they introduced in making the game healthier.
---
Plus it's survivor bug, so they really don't care you getting robbed of escape. If it was killer bug this bad, like when endgame starts you can't down someone sometimes and he gets free escape it would be a pinned thread on top and would be fixed in at most one week.
---
The problem isn't than being good at a game makes you a no lifer. The problem is that usually people who are really good are people who spent way too much time playing videogames because they hate other people and normie behavior. You must know atleast one person that does this it's pretty common.
---
No problem
---
Nice, more insults. I can see it's pointless talking to you.
---
Again, imagine making a thread asking why face camping happens, then getting mad at one of the answers. It's also very ironic that you call others a dense cabbage When You Type Like This.
---
Learn some manners kid.
---
When survivors bring op addond like insta heals and perks like adrenaline, decisive, mettle of man and think that they are hot shit by playing on easy mode and tea bag every chance they get. I always win them when I'm with a viable killer, but with shitty ones I DC
---
Ok But I Just Don't See Any Fun In Making Another Player Have A Bad Time (Besides Killing Them) Or Wasting Two Minutes Having A Staring Contest
---
I would make a funny for honor joke but I don‚Äôt have any
---
Survivors using shit map offerings is about 900% more common than killers using moris.
---
P3 literally means nothing. You can have 4 p3 Claudettes and all of em could be rubbish nubs. 
---
Just means you got to keep a clean eye on em.
---
Mobile devs pls ban him
---
You‚Äôre not stupid, that‚Äôs okay. :)
---
Definitely PC. I‚Äôm jealous, haha.
---
I'm a PC player who runs stealth myers, which requires me to stay in Evil Within 1, which means I can't use my power or at the very least have to use it extremely sparsely. 
---
The tradeoff is having a terror radius of literally nil.
---
Thank you so much. I‚Äôve been doing a movie break anytime I get heated. This thread has helped a ton.
---
You Are Very Hypocritical Saying I Am Insulting You. Also It's My Thread I Can Question Answers If I Want.
---
Oh! Thank you so much for explaining. And yes, I‚Äôll definitely check out Panda! :)
---
Camp, just do it
---
No, I want people to improve and I think that overtly praising them urges them not to.
---
And that makes me mad.
---
Mimimimiiiii
---
Haha, yeah, I definitely relate. Unfortunately that slashing is considered toxic so I try not to do it but eh, not really a chance for depressurizing from the stress without dropping the game.
---
Thank you for a actual  answer! I understand those types of survivors (my friends) and they usually get what's coming to them, but correct me if I'm wrong you DC if the survivors are shitty? (No perks or common)
---
It's not about the bloodpoints. It's about sending a message.
---
Oh, that‚Äôs different but I‚Äôm glad you get apologies! Could I ask what you say? I try to be nice, but not engaging in the chat is usually so much safer.
---
Don't enjoy part of your game if you don't have enough money for paying for a great connection or if you live in a remote part of the world.
---
Me when I call her Minnie uwu
---
Thank you so much. Yeah, I realized a couple of the things I‚Äôve mentioned aren‚Äôt actually toxic, they‚Äôre just annoying as hell. I‚Äôm just tired of not being able to play for like ten minutes cuz I‚Äôm shaking off like three sparklers. It‚Äôs annoying af, lmao. But yeah, I‚Äôm giving myself more breaks to keep from getting too salty.
---
No shit Sherlock
---
Oh we got a big boy here
---
...I mean that's fine. You asked if people enjoyed facecamping. I shared the one time I absolutely enjoyed it. I'm not claiming facecamping is universally fun and i love every second of it. Just that there are times where the chance to ruin a toxic players day fills me with satisfaction lol
---
Then why bother making this post?
---
Yea I Know I Asked If People Got A Kick Out Of It.
---
And then you go into stalk and see a red Aura....
---
***OK seriously am I just going mad why does every third game or so have an Object Of Obsession?! Thats a suicide perk if I was playing any of the meta killers!***
---
I wanna see some rank 1 chases. I see people do crazy shit even at rank 10 like hop in out of the locker 5 times while dodging stabs and then 360 and speed off but what even goes on at rank 1
---
Nope, if the survivors are shitty I just fuck them over. I almost never DC, unless if those conditions are met (cocky survivors on easy mode) I just play the game normally. And even on those cases, I still play until I notice that I'm not having fun anymore, so I just DC and stop playing for a While
---
No no no, his power was to *clap them cheeks* *boi*
---
Well yes, you have to apply with the link they provided.
---
Absolutely
---
Lol I‚Äôm trash tho. You play on Xbox?
---
Since the other movies aren‚Äôt canon anymore, then yeah he‚Äôs completely human. But the ending to Halloween (2018) has me thinking otherwise...
---
The complaint is referring to when killers slug for 10 minutes and wait for everybody to bleed out. It's just frustrating, boring, and un-fun.
---
The T in EST is for "time."
---
Latency is a hell of a drug.
---
Michael myer I wouldnt really call 'normal'
---
I had someone message me the other night saying I deserved their tbags since I was targeting them with 5 gens left. Wtf? They were the ones afraid of ruin. You have to be pretty bad to allow more then 2 hooks to go on before the first gen. Why does that not make it okay?
---
Then don't post it if your not gonna give credit
---
You're right, you're right
---
I assure its either hes bugged out in some way or its on sonys end
---
Honestly too true :(
---
It's always possible that more than one person had the same idea for a meme, it doesn't mean he copied it
---
Get juked, pigs.
---
Yesterday I did a game against a legion, i wasn't doing anything toxic, I was just trying to survive. I got chased since the beginning of the match and after the third gen was done he gave up, disconnect and everyone lost the pip.
---
I mean, I've just made a killer quit his job, even better than simply survive, at least give me a pip...
---
Don‚Äôt forget the Spirit and Plague also.
---
Well i meant people who are currently human, plague and spirit are dead really
---
"Aaauu^^uuuggg^^ggg"
---
High tier. Easily.
---
Old Freddy was mid tier without a doubt due to his map awareness and stall.
---
New Freddy has a strong chase tool and map pressure comparable to Billy/Nurse/Spirit.
---
It was hardly fast. It was basically just to counteract the slowdown you normally get when sleeping someone. Even with the best addons stacked I think all it did was completely negate the slowdown, you didn't get a rush of speed or anything like that.
---
Without Ruin I‚Äôm stuck in the purple ranks.
---
Right, please don't cleanse. You're just making it harder for me to kill you when you don't. I really enjoy the 4ks I get when they cleanse. It's so easy to track healthy survivors that don't leave a puke trail and breathe ever so silently.
---
Ok.. do cleanse, thanks for the oral machine gun!
---
Yeah but clown doesn't have eyes
---
Technically so is Leatherface
---
Getting shot 6 times, falling off he balcony, casually walking away?
---
I said it's not mine and I don't know who's I just wanted to show something cool
---
I knew i was forgetting someone
---
I say Halloween is pretty good, Michael is a powerful and versatile killer, he has somewhat nice perks and his addons can drastically change every game you're going to play with him.
---
F
---
Oh...well, as I play both sides, I can understand how as a survivor up against a totem of any kind already slows the game down considerably and so seeing 2 or more Survivors being tunneled, slugged or camped with 5 gens still up can certainly be...lets use the word : Frustrating. Especially when the Killer tunnels, that by far is the worst.
---
But at the end of games like that, are you happy with the points you get? What are your scores usually? Curious.
---
I know it‚Äôs horror and theirs clich√©s,but no Human survives multiple gun shots,Burned Alive and others
---
Nu uh nu uh, the MASK, we can‚Äôt have the actual ghostface robes in the game, they only have mask rights
---
Can't detect EW 1 tho

---
Missing some, but cool comparison to their sizes.
---
as a new player, get Halloween because Laurie has one of the best perk in the game and it assure you protection against tunnelers. 
---
you can grind for Curtain Call, Clown has 2 great perks + Kate has 2 decent ones and one of them, Windows of Opportunity it's amazing for beginners because it shows you where all the pallets and windows are within 20m and it can help you memorize the environment around you better.
---
do you play on console? if not, get Spark of Madness, Doctor has 1 great perk and all or Feng Min's perks are amazing for beginners.
---
what's your playstyle? do you play more immersive? aggressive? 'cause perks like Iron Will and Spine Chill are best counters for Spirit. however, against Plague depends on you, if you are good at looping, run perks like Dead Hard, Decesive, Adrenaline etc. if not, then play immersive and use perks like Urban Evasion, Spine Chill, Iron Will etc
---
Hmm I wouldn't know how to really describe my playstyle. I mainly play altruistically and always end up being tunneled.
---
Lag
---
Goddamn if I was survivor I would be laughing too hard I'd probably get hit.
---
They are working on fixing things in the game
---
You're right, I really dropped the game because this game went to shit. And before I droped the game, I became a survivor only. C'ause it's way easier even on high ranks, the game is obviously survivor sided, and that's sad. And you're telling me about the addons and maps... like... u don't say? It's obvious. But even on the strongest builds, survivors have the power role(unless it's the nurse)
---
Or most people just enjoy having fun and don‚Äôt try to ruin everyone else‚Äôs game experience. 
---
There‚Äôs a difference between bringing a good item and playing on the most survivor-favored map in the game, with time beforehand to pick your perks. 
---
The post was ‚Äúkillers, why dc‚Äù, so I gave an answer. If you go out of your way to ruin any chance of fun I could have, I‚Äôm not playing the game.
---
yes, definitely
---
No ome ever said he was an average human
---
Oh god please not again, does he ever give up?
---
Just move onto a different game
---
Dafuc you classify as human, you telling me that whatever comes out a mothers vagina from being pregnant may not be a human.
---
I thought it was he hunted the strongest beings alive and kept their heads and spines as trophies.  That would be a cool mori thinking about it
---
Honestly they way I see it is that you just happened to take down the worst player so they blamed you cause you were able to out skill him there always these kinds of survivors who blame the killer for their own mistakes and I hate them honestly even if I'm playing swf if the people I play with shit on a killer cause he is actually being skillful I'll give them shit for being shit survivors
---
Youre right i cant count. After researching it though the 5th slot is up for debate since there are only 4 top tier killers. Some say hag, others say plague or miers. Make of it what you will i guess.
---
I know I'm going to receive a lot of replies well this is what you did wrong or this how the game works. I'm here to tell you that's bullshit. You don't play a game a lower level hit 20k+ and not receive a pip. It just shouldn't happen. There's no justification for doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing and the game telling you to go fuck yourself. The pip system is completely broken.
---
And the yapper

You forgot a different type of trapper

Iridescent deviousness

If you hover over each of the categories it shows how you got the points, it's all in percentages though.
---
Angelo was a greedy man, the kind that wouldn't stop at anything to get what he wants. Scams, theft, nothing was beneath him, but he was running out of options, after of months of wandering around, he begin to have this weird feeling, as if something bad was about to happen, he felt evil was finally coming to get him. he had to stop it, he had to make ammends, after thinking it shortly he decided he was going to join the firemen, he was going to save lives to pay for those he destroyed to save his own.
---
Time went by and his abilities made him a very valuable member, the feeling of danger was gone, maybe all was paid, he tought, he would continue there until he found something easier to do. But one day, an old rich woman's house burned, when he was inside he could see a box of jewelry. it was more money than what he could earn in a year. his greed took the best of him and he took them. But how could this continue? he got an idea from TV, he would start fires on places he knew would have something good to loot.
---
He became apathetic, he cared for nothing except the fires at the rich neighbourhoods, and even in then he never rescued anyone, he just liked to go there, the other firemen started to suspect something was wrong, they decided to put an eye on him. in the next fire they caught him stealing. anger invaded him,everything was ruined but he was at least make them pay for it,  he took his axe to finish them off when he heard a voice, the language he could not understand, but he knew what it meant. somehow the place was so damaged it could fall at any moment, if he hit in the right place. as crazy as that sounded he decided to give it a try, he hit the spot the voice told him and the whole place fell down burying them all. His body was never found.
---
Speed: 110%
---
Power:  Flames
---
The arsonist is forever engulfed in flames, wherever he walks a trail of flames are left for some time, survivors that stand on them will ignite, and a burning bar will appear under their names, the bar is visible to both survivors and killer. when the bar decreases survivors will take damage.
---
Flames will extinguish after some time. stepping on the fire trail will increase the fire damage they take greatly as long as they stand on it and it will make the flames on survivors to last longer and burn faster the more they stay inside the flames.
---
He can also ignite windows, lockers and generators he interact with, and pallets he pass next to, survivors that interact with them will receive minimal damage.
---
his active power is pyromancy, he can take the flames off ignited object or survivors and use it to throw a fireball at them, this takes some time in which his speed will be greatly decreased, but if he manages to hit survivors with it  they will be put in dying state. Fireball has a small explosion where it hits,  allowing to make it easir to hit survivors with it.
---
Perks:
---
Emergency: when outside a chase, the killer will receive a 10/15/20% speed bonus to normal speed movement, this only applies when walking forward.
---
-He was eager to get there, but then...he just lost motivation.
---
Hex: suffocation: As long as this hex remains, survivors will be exhausted, also aura reading and detection abilities and perks will stop working for 2/3/4 survivors and the killer.
---
-I can't see nothing, and it's getting hard to breathe...
---
Blocked doors:
---
The black lock will not be visible until it‚Äôs opened, it will have a 10/15/20 seconds delay in appearing and oppening after the the sacrifice of the penultimate survivor.
---
-Hahaha, that‚Äôs so irresponsible...
---
The only times I DC is when either teammates are purposely getting me killed or if the killer tunnels then camps me (both happens very little amount of times)
---
Well it's not just that. Afterwards in the party they were calling me trash because they lost me in a 360. Isn't that supposed to be what a 360 is for? Also I went to get a gen for two of like five 360s. But yeah, and in the end I had fun but they were just a bunch if buzzkills.
---
Rule 1 is that ranks dont matter. They represent only time sunk, not player skill. At rank 1 i still get plenty of people that don't really know how to play. Besides mid rank is where the fun is. You mostly avoid the most toxic players that are consistently in red tier.
---
Yeah, I know. Even though I hate them, I LOVE the toxicity. It fuels me for my next game.
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
also ik i played like a potato here :thumbsup:
---
lol dude really baited the cop Im done. It really do be like that sometimes.
---
oh no not again
---
Can I get....an AMEN!?
---
Bitch!
---
I dont believe OP is refering to those situations, its more like you down someone for the first time and they immediately dc, or if someones dead on hook and they just leave.
---
Well tecnically you are a baby huntress
---
I do not farm my teammates for BP. Ir's rare for me to pull an unsafe hook. I wish I had taken a screenshot of the badges, it may have told the bigger picture.
---
Yeah, but they were saying I'm a baby killer. Huntress yes, killer no. I made it to rank 15 twice so I know my stuff... it sounds cooler in my head. I have a level 35 trapper (don't judge) and a level 28 Myers
---
They delayed him for some reason idk or care I just want grandpa.
---
Op before posting someone‚Äôs art please give credit https://derinimlhc.tumblr.com/post/184139512609
---
Exactly what this guy said.
---
Yeah. Some killers have a harder time pipping than others. Which is why higher ranks are either only nurses or billy's or spirits. It's about dragging the game out, toying with survivors, and getting everyone hooked enough times. You need to focus on stalling the game by making sure gens aren't done so quickly (which is why everyone says ruin is a necessity) and chasing survivors long enough and making sure you hit them enough times as well as making sure they get hooked enough times (without camping). 
---
So as a pig main you might need to need to change up your build and try to get enough points for a pip or two
---
&gt;  do not farm my teammates for BP. Ir's rare for me to pull an unsafe hook. If it happens, it's never on purpose
---
Never said you did but it isn't rare for teammates to go down immediately after being unhooked and before 10s is past even if it was relatively safe. Hell, some times when I unhook my teammates with Borrowed Time they manage to go down instantly.
---
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, people can be really shitty :(. One thing you can do to make playing survivor more fun is to make friends with nice people you meet on game, and just 4 man SFW. As for the killer side, I‚Äôd just take a break on it until you‚Äôre 100% fine, salt sacks will deem anything ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and complain about it. Just don‚Äôt let any of it get to you.
---
That got fixed in last patch.
---
What's the point in not killing them?
---
This thread is funny because veteran players struggle to **derank** (in the hope to have better queues). You have to literally stay afk otherwise you pip / safety pip. If you actually play the game, very rarely you won't double pip.
---
Pig is better than almost every killer on the their above her and huntress is not that up there
---
Speedo Quentin but only if they fix his face.
---
Speedo David.

Ghostface after downing meg who thinks running around a pallet is a skill.

No offense to you, but this is why I hardly post on this sub. I come here level-headed, looking for answers only to be downvoted.
---
I came here as a new player months ago and was downvoted for asking questions. I'm not singling out you, but this sub is about as toxic as it gets.
---
I think people think Legion is bad because he can be even quicker than the survivor and vault pallets. That's for the survivors. I think killers hate him/her because if the effect they get, instead of injuring them or downing them
---
Thats alot of g a m e r s
---
A map offering is part of the game like a Mori. You think is funny to get hooked, camped, downed instantly and moried? No, but I don't quit when I see a Mori and as I said I don't understand why on this subreddit if you say Mori=quit you are really going to get a big shitstorm and if you do the same thing as killer you are not. Btw just to say, I got red ranks also with killer, not every month because I don't always have time to play, without quit games and avoid lobbies. Some games are easy some games are hard, it depends on the map, the add-ons, the players, the items and the builds. Get to rank 1 playing only easy game doesn't make you a better player.

Samination‚Äôs Trapper in a tux please

I usually 99% someone and either let them go for now or expose them in a good spot. I love running double recovery addons

Of the actual killers.  
---
To be more deliberate with my statements since I feel there is miscommunication, she‚Äôs one of the few that can just swap her clothes and not draw attention.  That‚Äôs what I mean by stating some of the numbers that aren‚Äôt researched or correct, but generalized in my previous comment.  A few of them could as well, but this was based on the idea that most would look imposing and violent normally.
---
What Michael survived in the movies should make it pretty clear that he's not human.
---
It's bugged right now, change it out for a different perk until it's fixed.
---
The case is, I'm not talking about thinking I deserve to be rank 1. The case is, when I was a DBD player, I always got rank 1 and it was stressful, because of all cocky easy mode players and all. And you think that this game is not survivor sided? Do you know how many killers are totally unviable on rank 1? Do you know how impossible is to even have a chance with low tier killers? Come on man
---
I mean you say that but there are people who have taken shotguns to the chest and survive
---
Yeah I know but I‚Äôm saying killers aren‚Äôt able to see offerings
---
Yeah those are stupid reasons to dc. As killer, when 2 or more people dc, I let others leave.

Petition to have Shaggy as a survivor with obligatory Scooby Snacks Perk

*Down the teabagger after a few pallets and only 1 gen in done, proceeds to down all teammates that dont have any means of escape but windowns*
---
That‚Äôs true. Ok.
---
This inspired me to make a build to put myself before others.

Items:

‚Ä¢A purple flashlight (for saving my friends, not wasting my seconds on anything else.)
---
‚Ä¢ A med kit with an insta heal in case my teammate gets knocked down 
---
(depending on the situation you might wanna save it, and make it a good med kit with another add on that leaves extra charges left, if you do that, you can get rid of self care and get sprint burst to position yourself for a save.)
---
We get it, you're better than everyone else.
---
Did anybody else read the title in the theme of The Addams Family?
---
Then they shouldn't have it labeled under unsportsmanlike conduct when you go to give said report ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I've not seen them ask that though.
---
Then don't be subbed to it.
---
cringe
---
"Pallet Town"
---
lmao
---
I mean either he is over 8ft tall or the survivors are midgets
---
Old freddy was mid tier you say?
---
I agree, but he stated that he wants to rank up and find it hard to do so, and high rank players must play with one hand to derank.
---
No, his lunge is huge.
---
Same key you use to kick generators.
---
Snapping out of it isn't in the healing category I don't think, so it won't.
---
It might be that you're in gaming communities that don't have standards.
---
Wasnt the bunny mask for calming down the girls she kidnapped?
---
The only way I can think of possibly doing this is if the generator is at like 99% and the last person dies, you pop the gen rush to a gate while the killer is looking for hatch and leave, or the killer is letting you farm gems as last survivor and lets you escape
---
Haha nice
---
Hmm, that's a great build
---
I love the way he leans, no arms or hands, all torso supporting him
---
Thank you, kind stranger.
---
Yeah, fair point.
---
Why not? Nurse don‚Äôt need perks
---
No, stop bullying devs, they are super bussy 34/7 working for thr battle pass that we all asked for
---
Fair, but that last comparison is just dumb. Should have left it out.
---
Camping and tunneling might not be "toxic", but it's boring and frustrating and completely unfun.
---
You're welcome
---
Thanks!
---
I'm sad when I rank up. Playing on lower ranks is more fun.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, if the hag is anything like me, they‚Äôll mash the teleport button confused as to why it‚Äôs not working
---
Or it could be a Microsoft issue since the Left 4 Dead series came out on Xbox 360, but not PS3
---
PC. I did allow it to the firewall, verified game files, reinstalled, tried literally everything.
---
I like the idea of a killer leaving a trail behind that damages survivors, would discourage looping.
---
You mean ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt‚Äù care less. ‚ÄúCould‚Äù implies you care at least a bit.
---
The devs are aware of the issue, and are working to fix it
---
A lot of effort and it came out pretty good. The only critique I have is "Suffocation" 
---
Ditch the aura reading or replace it with something else because 3rd seal already effects that.
---
Rule 13: All memes must include a hidden Claudette in the background
---
Pop is really good on freddy
---
It isn't about you but go ahead and think the world evolves around you. If it isn't for you then why are you here? This is obviously a post for people who been waiting 3 years for Bill on Ps4.
---
I disagree, every other killer has ‚Äúthe ___‚Äù as their name, Ghostface should be the same way. ‚ÄúGhost face‚Äù would be a weird name when everyone else follows the same pattern.
---
‚ÄúThe ghost‚Äù ‚Äúthe scream‚Äù ‚Äúthe slasher‚Äù ‚Äúthe mask‚Äù ‚Äúthe lurker‚Äù , etc etc are all good alternatives.
---
Clearly is a Joke....this one of the guys getting mad that he's not on console
---
Iv yau ddnt lyk dat den u muzt hayte diz
---
Could just be a straight up design choice since she's always wearing a mask or a full on animal head with her last several cosmetics. Might be a simple case of 'don't render it if you can't see it'. There are a ton of game characters that have minimal details because of what you actually see.
---
It's a cool theory though in all honesty still.
---
Poo poo pee pee, pee pee poo poo, my friend
---
üòéüòéüòé
---
And clearly I was being sarcastic
---
eh thought he was going to tombstone you
---
Do you even know what the perk does lol
---
üëÄüëâüí©
---
well back to balanced landing for now. they break something new every patch i swear
---
"I played one match against Freddy and now know he has no counters!"
---
"What's that? It takes more than one match to learn how to play against a new Killer?"
---
"RRRRRRROYSTON! They are questioning my expertise!"
---
 &gt;:(
---
he exposed you right before you revealed him that means he stalked you before and you didn't reveal him back then. nothing wrong
---
Dead Hard is currently bugged. Use a different exhaustion perk for escape until it‚Äôs fixed, i recommend Lithe or Balanced Landing.
---
Better yet, use sloppy and nurse‚Äôs to get the drop on a healing survivor and down them in one hit
---
"Suffering from success." So it's true.
---
Then reverse google search it and find the artist to give proper credit to instead of just implying that ‚Äòi don‚Äôt know who drew it so i don‚Äôt have to give credit‚Äô
---
Well this such a git gud tier list
---
And what's bad about that? If you don't suck at killer, that scenario is better for you. Also I wouldn't like to play with 4 stacks of thanatophobia.
---
Tbf I think it was cheesy even by the standards of the time lol
---
Thought of this while watching Scream when that scene came on :D
---
Yeah, but still a good movie
---
I like this artist already
---
Sweetie, even old Legion was slower than an exhaustion perk
---
I think it was because the film didn't actually make the mask up and they literally just found it in a local Halloween store. Only thing they thought of was the robes, which were originally going to be white until a producer suggested they be made black instead.  
---
Still a shame tho, would of been cool having either Sidney or Randy as survivors. With maybe the film set from Scream 3 being the new map :D
---
‚ÄúThis game sucks so much‚Äù
---
And you‚Äôre Rank 1 because you play it a lot and possibly skillfully. So what was the point of posting this.
---
I mean what punishment do you think people could receive besides just losing any points the earned in the match which already happens.
---
Have seen 1 freddy since the update (if you dont't count kyf).
---
I mean, if you do get better as a killer, survivors are gonna have a bad time... 
---
So it's technically true?
---
Yeah I cant really play Clown on higher ranks (I got bullied like fuck yesterday with *0 hooks*) So I enjoy him more on lower ranks where people dont really know how to play against him
---
Why wait 3 years for 1 character? And it's revolve üò≠
---
Yeah it was
---
Gotta go grab mine to calm my kidnapped girls 
---
/s
---
First, rework her add-ons. The "increase chances to trigger a skill check" and "Increase penalty for failed ones" are useless as fuck. Second, make rule set n.2 base power. Third, make her crouch instant just like Ghostface.
---
Maybe make it harder to pull of the Bear Traps. Idk, maybe more Jigsaw Boxes in the map so it‚Äôs more difficult to pull of the Trap. That way she gains more time. She lacks on mobility to patrol I think.
---
With his stall and map awareness yes
---
Seeya
---
Hag &gt; Freddy
---
This is a good meme
---
Dude, moonwalking and teabagging are signs of skilled players. You are obligated to let those people farm you. They spent like 15 minutes figuring this shit out.
---
Approx 69 abdominal muscles takes a hefty amount of time to 3D model.

Again you can not balance a game around rank 1.

Every single chest hair animated.

And the dead walk again.
---
I know that but i mean currently
---
that's one of the problem not that he was ever faster but the fact is there not gonn make him faster as a whole and hes just gonna me low tier killer no matter what they do honestly
---
The way ghost face wipes his blade is from the movie. Subtle nod
---
The hashslinging slasher
---
Yeah, he's the bogeyman

k

You could Google how to do a reverse Google search  :-p
---
It's not just PC, the game is very popular on all platforms.
---
&gt;fredy op
---
no
---
&gt;yes I know was joke
---
yes was joke
---
Breakfast
---
DON‚ÄôT GO FOR SELF CARE. It‚Äôs a trap.
---
Go for Bond instead.
---
Self care teaches you bad habits. Bond lets you learn a lot about the game
---
Risky click of the day.
---
Don‚Äôt go claudette. Self care is a trap
---
Are you dumb? We are talking about how erect our dicks become when we see shirtless myers!
---
That delayed reaction was hilarious.
---
The commentary was gold.
---
Razor wire to place on vaults would be amazing.
---
Her base kit is fine to me, it‚Äôs her perks and her trap interaction that needs work, in end game when someone was trapped it should be treated as a hooked survivor and the timer just slows down, 
---
As far as her addon very few of them are useful,
---
They should be scared to release it, because that lawsuit would be massive.
---
ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
I think the Wraith and Trapper were the ones who  were least eager to kill.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cigmac/pc_version_audio_cutting_out_and_massive_fps/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I love this artstyle.
---
I'm pretty sure that despite the description you just need to mark and down 3 survivors. No need to lean. Although it's the best way to actually stalk and mark people anyway.
---
*freddy hooks survivor
---
Freddy: only know at the end you understand
---
Yea knew that one from otz already thx for the reply though
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even be mad if they copied and pasted last years event again just give us something.
---
(I know this person didn't say this in the post, just wanted to point it out)
---
Why do rank 20 players feel the need to write "ez" at the end even if they died. Like, I'm a survivor main, but I don't understand. Or say "noob".
---
Myers is the most entertaining killer to play as and against.
---
I never said tunneling was a GOOD strategy, I said it was just a strategy. If a killer wants to tunnel, they can. The killers‚Äô objective is to kill, not to make everybody have fun.
---
What? They changed it months ago. Now it's 2/3/4% speed with two tokens.
---
He‚Äôs very fun to play, I would definitely get him. Plus he has save the best for last which is a good perk on many killers.
---
In my opinion,  a low-high tier to mid tier killer. I enjoy playing him.
---
I would just rework her addons honestly and I would also like it if taking off the traps weren't based RNG. It really annoys me to see survivor instantly remove the traps on their first try. It would be better if it was "search x amount of boxes to remove the trap" and she could have addons that increase that number. I think she is mostly fine otherwise.
---
This is the quality content I sub for.
---
**I'm so ok with this.**
---
It's the same thing when they keep saying that you're bad even though you killed them, which makes them even worse than you, and they all do that. So I have no idea.
---
The only thing unbalanced is that when I‚Äôm the killer Hag and someone triggers my trap in front of me it scares the bejeesus out of me, ha.  (I main survivor though so maybe it‚Äôs just habit to be scared of little Lisa.)
---
Playing Laurie without DS but running at the killer after an unhook with Unbreakable is the ultimate megamind tactic.
---
Legion is more of a pack of feral hyaenas than any normal human being
---
Oh god I love it
---
Hahaha.
---
If the exit gates are powered and you trap a Survivor, the timer sound start and the Survivor shouldn‚Äôt be able to leave until they get the trap off
---
This would make a great to be continued meme
---
Can confirm that he is fun to play against. I always have an anxiety attack when going up against him.
---
Would the Doctor be the Zapper?
---
Seriously he‚Äôs clearly not fully human and been confirmed to have supernatural elements that make him so evil and powerful. I think most people haven‚Äôt even watched the movies except the remake which even then made it somewhat clear he wasn‚Äôt just a  human
---
That would be cool, because I have two contradicting replies now.
---
I enjoy it cause I get to imagine a pissed off survivor and it‚Äôs just the kind of petty victory I need after having to deal with flash light clicking, teabagging, ene though they miss pallet stuns. Only other time I do it is when the survivor camps a pallet for 10 fucking minutes instead of getting gens done so he can drop  a single pallet on my head and call me a trash killer.
---
They need to keep him alive if they want to milk it.
---
????
---
Human can survive that..
---
Old Freddy was so bad he actually created the F tier
---
If you are pro with nurse, you may want to have make your choice lvl 1 so it can be used again in 40 seconds instead of 50 of 60
---
Hahahahaha, im dying of laughter :l
---
With dream pallets - high (A) tier
---
With snares - mid or low mid (C) tier
---
I sadly won‚Äôt be able to test that in the next 3 days, so you‚Äôll need to find someone and test it yourself üòû
---
I have thought about this before: merge two maps together, 2 Killers vs 8 Survivors, 10 generators, basically multiplying everything by 2.
---
I mean it‚Äôs true tho, they follow their gang leader in whatever he does and runs around stabbing and screaming for an adrenaline rush. I wouldn‚Äôt call them normal humans
---
Yeah, its called a gang
---
Where?
---
Is she dead
---
you thought us veterans wouldn't recognize this repost?
---
Not a normal gang to me. Irl gangs do fucked up things but they don‚Äôt act like feral slasher villains.
---
I get that, but sometimes a survivor tries to run me around and somehow thinks it‚Äôs a smart idea to run for the hook after dropping a pallet and not expecting for me to head straight for the hook. People still say I‚Äôm proxy campaign when I‚Äôm doing that, when the only reason I‚Äôm near the hook is cause the other survivor decided to run me around in that area
---
This was such a fun read that this subreddit needs more of!
---
Have you ever heard about cultists
---
Even better, no powers on killers, so Ghostface without his power
---
From what I said above:
---
I play Plague pretty often in red ranks
---
Ruin/Thanatophobia/Spirit Fury/Enduring. Typically at red ranks the survivors are smart enough to not cleanse. Thanatophobia prevents that and is a required perk IMO.
---
Vomit on EVERYTHING. I see people wasting a lot of time doing full charge vomits on a gen, you only need to charge it slightly.
---
If a survivor is at a strong loop and you're having a hard time directly puking on them, it's better to just M1. They will still get the Broken status later.
---
She snowballs very hard. If you have a rough start you're going to have a rough end.
---
Edit: If you aren't red ranks, Thanatophobia is replaceable by whatever you want, probably BBQ. Ruin is replaceable by Corrupt Intervention. If you don't have the Spirit Fury/Enduring combo, M&amp;A and Bamboozle work as well. I'd say it really depends on what you have at level 3.
---
So either:
---
Ruin (or Corrupt Intervention), Thanatophobia, Spirit Fury, Enduring
---
or
---
Ruin (or Corrupt Intervention), M&amp;A, Bamboozle, BBQ
---
He's joking
---
Technically any killer is a human. The entity may gave them a few new powers but in the end their are all human. For the "normal" part tho... well not so much.
---
Yea I agree that 10 is probably a bit much.
---
You break his stalking ability if you squat/rub them with your forehead.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd quit if that happened to me. 45 million bloodpoints doesnt even sound like its enough to get everything you had back.
---
u/FBI check this out
---
i literally just bought freddy to test this killer..... he is the easiest killer. thats not my opinion its fact. i had 1 perk and managed to 4k 4 games in a row.
---
FREDDY IS THE EASIEST (FACT)
---
Also it does mean they suck.
---
Awesome.
---
It's also why plague lunge seems like it was super small
---
You guys get a match at lower rank ?
---
Oh, so you want another nurse level killer that doesnt require same amount of skill to fuck with survivors? Look mom hurr durr i walk and people die hurr durr.
---
Balanced landing.
---
Lithe is definitely worth it. I've been using it as my main exhaustion perk while dead hard is bugged and been having a blast
---
Quite literally me. 
---
First game, teammate goes down, disconnects.
---
I start looping the hilly for 2 minutes, I go down and get hooked, nobody helps and im dead.
---
The Entity blockers radiate what looks like heat, too.  So this theory is looking more solid by the second.
---
It's the drugs that got to him
---
FD is honestly so rude.
---

You might like stroking yourself on the moral high ground you've built, but sometimes you have to stop and see how dumb you look to others
---
You're a prime example of the mindset I was mocking in my original post.
---
for me it's Dead Hard, it makes me feel so incredibly safe when i'm injured, even though i can really easily fuck it up and get baited to use Dead Hard, it still makes me feel safe because i feel like i have a CHANCE to survive when the killer comes around again
---
and even though it's bugged, i only actually had a problem with it once, i'm not really sure how it's bugged, i guess sometimes it works and sometimes it just doesn't.
---
Pedochido's mating call.
---
I don't use lithe because it's a waste when you want to loop in double windows, even in zones with only 1 window like jungle gyms it's a waste because the good way to use lithe it's (I think) by using it to leave a zone and going to other loop, so if you are looping in a jungle gym you only will get an extra loop, that's not bad but I don't think it's worth it. But lithe can save you ass in short and unsafe loops, you drop the pallet, you fast vault it and you try to go to another zone with a good loop
---
It's funny because in the scene he's running away lol.
---
Aw ... Leave baby Feng alone.
---
But survivor thinks the opposite
---
Myers that high what why
---
He probably didn't even see her lol
---
He still is Joker in the DCEU. I don't think he was given enough screen time to be judged as a bad or good joker.
---
Flashlight clicking is the survival greeting
---
She's clearly mentally a child.
---
I want a panda skin for the pig.
---
Oh I rarely re-hook the downed survivor, I don't want them to quit the game and shit, the only time I'd REALLY do it is when there's like one gen or edit gates are powered
---
The engine of a car is not working. However the windows work fine. Jusy pull out the window and use that as the engine. Im sure it works that way.
---
My issue with Trapper is suviviors seen like they disarm traps faster then you can place one
---
they need to make it where killer can hear then if they talk or not to help locate to avoid rank 1 players who are already annoying from ruining higher rank games for killer if this is implied for everyone on survivor side
---
I have both those perks on most of my killers you‚Äôre not losing me that easily
---
I think at lvl 1 is every 8 second Discondance gives you a notification if people are still working on a gen, at lvl 3 you will get the 2nd notification at 12 seconds, by that time those 2 may not be repairing that gen anymore, so at lvl 1 you can know if there are 2 surv still working on the gen after the 1st notification by waiting 4 seconds less that if you had the perk at lvl 3
---
I don't think they'd go near xenomorph because it's not humanoid. But PREDATOR would fit so well. He's all for the hunt he'd probably work willingly for the entity for awhile. He could have snares or something with the plasma cannon and stealth mode. The infamous clicking sound, and the mori could be him taking the survivors skull.
---
gotta love pallet wasters
---
I don't ask you how to play against Clown only because I don't want to make you more sad.
---
But I'm on Ps4 so maybe you can tell me.
---
Cows would be proud, but it‚Äôs better with the syringe
---
Yeah the would explain how it's able travel through time I bet it requires massive amounts of energy to travel even more so too steal from the time and take the object to somewhere else.
---
I like this theory and untill told otherwise will be my belief as to what the entity is and how it functions.
---
Hexy also daids Billy is actually op and unbalanced to go against
---
Oh wow so you play exclusively against low level killers and feel great about winning?
---
Sometimes I stop playing and laugh my ass off when people drop shack palletsüòÇ

Snares last 3 bottles last 2.

Bill Looking dope with that Claudette teachable perk: Cloaking mode!
---
You lucky bastard.  Dead Hard has bugged and downed me about 12 times since it broke this last update.  It got to the point where I can't trust it and had to swap with Balanced.  30% of the time you'll press it and just stutter in place for a second with no dash.  That bug has given basement hooks to tunneling Spirits for christ sake lol.  Unnacceptable.
---
Laurie legit calls him it in her freak out to her family in Halloween 2018. ''I saw him. I saw The Shape." 
---
It's not even just a script thing anymore. It's a canon name for him.
---
Yeah on pc it's space I think which is the vault button and inata med kit button
---
Shirtless Myers will be the whole Summer... fall, winter, spring and one more summer event by itself.

Too bad Vigo wasn't a physicist. Probably.

I thought vthe hatch was made by the Entity though, if only to give the survivors some hope.
---
Nice  :)

* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots. 
---
I understood that part, but why do it in a game you don‚Äôt enjoy? Why not just do it in a game you actually like to play is what I mean.
---
While I do think this would be helpful at high levels of play, this would be absolutely detrimental to lower levels of play, which is the majority of the player base. So ideas like these would be a lot more useful if they were only implemented for people ranks 1-8 tbh.
---
The hag player hears the same 'splurch' sound you do as the flashlight breaks it, and the trap glow disappears.   So its not as clear of a notification as say someone stepping in a trapper trap.
---
The Entity is an evil being that has summoned killers after survivors to kill them as we know. Some killers (The Hag) has called it to get strength to kill her kidnappers and some has disappeared into the Entity's world like Doc and many others. But The Entity has also been helping on both sides Killers and Survivors. The reason being is the bloodweb, this bloodweb give survivors benefits to help in a chase when found by the killer, but The Entity has also help the Killers to end the chase quick and kill them to sacrifice them to the Entity. But, The Entity also isn't siding with anyone in his game. They takes away certain items and perks that would usually help both sides. Why would the Entity help the killers if they take away certain perks if they were on their side. And why would the Entity help the survivors if they want the killer to kill them (like pallets, perks, and items). At the end of each game he would reward each side based on how much effort they put into each game by how much gens they did or how altruistic they are or how many kills a killer has gotten or how many pallets the killers has broken.  This is all just a theory and of course they are probably things that can disproven my points, but this just seems interesting to me and I love the lore of the game based on the items description and the killers/survivors bio.
---
Legit not me. I killed myself first hook cuz dude is UE around the map to come save me.  He just didn't get that he was wasting a perk slot and everyone else's time. Told him straight up I had no intentions on carrying him all game just move along to the next game.
---
I play xbox too, and when I play killer I get matches in less than 5 minutes.
---
My guess is that they got away with doing the Pig because Saw is being rebooted? And "The Ghost Face", while using the appearance of the Scream character, is a different person than any of the people who took up the mantle in the franchise. But that is all just me guessing, it could be anything. I ain't gunna complain, pig is my fav killer.
---
No she isn't. Bubba is mentally a child. The huntress is mentally more like an animal and her knowledge is that of a child. There is a difference between these two things.
---
Dang. It takes me 5 to more. Just wanted to see if anyone else had this problem
---
Hag is not better than Myers
---
Don't judge this is like my first game, I'm still really bad
---
Who‚Äôs art is it?
---
I did search that, but nothing showed up :/
---
It's so fucking annoying, I sometimes play with some friends and one of them is really fucking toxic, always shittalking every single killer, teabagging as much as possible and if he doesn't get saved fast he just tends to get annoying, and he often gets facecamped cuz he acts tough, meanwhile we do 3-4 gens and all he does is complain how unfair it is that the killer can decide to make him depip
---
???
---
Dont forget legion used to have it to, and everyone wanted it changed because it made them suck
---

---
I did the daily and thought I messed up by not leaning. Had to farm with the Survivors to try to get it. Turns out the one person I stalked normally counted.
---
So not only is it verbose, it's also inaccurate.
---
Imagine being this ignorant lmao
---
You actually don't need to learn, as I learnt. So it's inaccurate as well as needlessly wordy.
---
so basically alredy pig is just complete trashbag. so id change it to and other killer or if u wanna kep playing her sure. pipping as killer is hard bcuz the emblem system sucks a fat cock for example if u kill people on the first hook u lose points for not hooking enough people. and if u get gen rushed u dont get anymore points almost at all. and if u patrol or camp u lose a shit ton of points so u rly have to extend the game as long as possible and hook them as many times as possible. im a killer main and i am in rank 1 so this is from experience.
---
Doctor is the worst killer in the game along with LF
---
To be fair Freddy and Myers are called "The Nightmare" and "The Shape" respectively.
---
You could do it where at for example at red ranks certain perks or perk combinations get disabled or you can't bring items yourself and have to rely on the items in the level or stuff like that, they could test out endless stuff on the PTB and just looks what works best for the game/community/balance
---
I noticed all the 666s first
---
But why?
---
Ah, I see
---
So yo got 2 hook rescues in terms of points or just 1 hook rescue in terms of points?
---
I don't really use Exhaustion perks but if I do then Dead Hard. I'd rather use other perks.
---
i mean..it‚Äôs the only one that has a chance happening not even joking
---
If it looks like plagiarism and sounds like plagiarism it's probably plagiarism.
---
This reminds me of that guy who worked for IGN who nearly copied a review of Dead Cells word-for-word.
---
Idk if there's a way to make everyone happy I guess lol. Cheers mate
---
10 minutes? Thats it? Wow.
---
Just to let them get escape points. It‚Äôs a reward for not being an ass and tbagging me, which happens very often. Also, once I get what I need, I feel like I don‚Äôt need do kill them. There‚Äôs no satisfaction.
---
So I, as someone who just wants to know your reason for it, therefore engaging in your Idea and trying to understand it am a waste of your time, so you wasted your time on a pointless pointcharts no one will give a fuck about like, ever. If you can't explain why you demand changes, your entire fucking argument falls flat, you know that?
---
You're argument is that players are bad so they won't be able to cope with an extra objective.
---
Never know they can be pretty unpredictable with characters I thought Amanda would be weird af but they managed to make her fit
---
Of course it is, it's me. Honestly 2 days ago I was scared to even play killer, getting way too frustrated, but now I'm doing pretty well :)
---
Someone said like 2 post above they balance for rank 10 which is mid rank?

Trapper and billy are just dudes too, not sure if wraith counts tho

He hunts beings he finds fun to hunt if he hunted the strongest beings alive they would probably hunt more Xenomorphs or themselves but heads as trophies could fit into the game somehow and it would be cool
---
It's not an attack, it's a move speed buff with an attack tied to the end of it.

That could be cool. I could imagine some of their perks / power could let them on-demand do what the Entity does now, like maybe block a generator or a window for a set amount of time without having to vault it or whatever, or maybe let them kill survivors once the gates are opened without a Mori, like the entity does when they run out of time.

I am a player level 47 &amp; currently at rank 18 about to pip to 17 survivor rank. Just looking for a SWF group around the same rank as me to have a good time. I play on XB1. Username: TheMidnightKat   The, TMK are in capitals also. add request won‚Äôt go through if you do lower case on them
---
Well make the neas with obsession and purple flashlight go behind the nurses so they use obsession to find our boy miers
---
The Shattered Bloodline DLC is also a great option with spirit being one of the top killers. I thinks she is the second best. Nonetheless she is very strong and the survivor counterpart, Adam, has the perk deliverance to ensure a safe hook YEET! It is a very good perk. Overall, this DLC and the Halloween Chapter and the DLC you should consider.
---
He literally looks down at her
---
I know what it is, but freddy just jumps from far away.
---
lmao fixed
---
Every killer has the same lunge. Freddy‚Äôs appears longer because he‚Äôs shorter and the animation makes it seem huge. This is also why the Plague‚Äôs seems to be very short.
---
You heard right! Dweard should be here any minute with the pizza.
---
Plague main here, both alternatives are good. But i get more downs getting people to stage 2 of the disease. Im just too lazy to go and get that corrupted vomit.
---
"What's the matter Dwight, you look like you've seen a ghost"
---
Because survivors get shit for BP unless you farm your teammates as is
---
I'm just surprised because this bug has existed for years and it's still here lol
---
Legion is very fun to play but definitely not the best for actually securing solid wins like 4Ks since his power can‚Äôt down anyone. I think it could use a rework to make it more viable, because the mending thing is mostly useless unless you tunnel one survivor at a time - which isn‚Äôt particularly efficient or fun for anyone.
---
A
---
My completely OP perk doesn't work and I can't play without it devs plis fix
---
This is like the reverse Piper Perry meme
---
At least they added the ability to look up and down when dashing, iirc you couldn't get dash hits on some stairs before.
---
Many people just do it out of politeness to allow the killer to get a hit in and get some more bloodpoints out of the game, and getting punished for being good samaritans is pretty stupid.
---
Pretty sure it wouldn‚Äôt activate, NOED looks for a dull totem once the gens are active, if there aren‚Äôt any it won‚Äôt.
---
He can't completely stop loops with shock, he can allow survivors make additional 1 thousand laps before they drop a pallet
---
She doesn't need a nerf but something to make the traps a bit more fun would be cool and could build off of the saw theme. I just find the luck boxes to be really boring, don't make me run a lap around the map, give me a game to play.
---
He just got reworked and is actually fun, Jesus Christ pal just let the hype die a little and then it‚Äôll return to the normal, oh so fun killers like nurse, spirit and hillbilly. I can‚Äôt wait

Yeah love getting that spirit furied tier 3 hit with 0 counterplay. 
---
Inb4 what's spirit fury?
---
At least Legion could use Frenzy to move faster! 
---
On console, Huntress has NOTHING going for her. When people say, "Leatherface is the worst Killer"; I'm like, "Bruh. At least it isn't crippled by short loops, can get to gens BEFORE they are completed and has a normal-ass terror radius".
---
Christ... With the release of Plague, Huntress legit has no reason to exist!
---
It happened a lot of times to me as well. I started using DH because it forces u to loop better compared to other exhaustion perks (where you just get such a boost that you 'run away'). Now with this bugged DH, I find myself unable to switch back to Balanced or Lithe because they fundamentally change how you loop.

I don't want to give him a secure tier until at least two weeks after the update is live, however if you asked me what I think he'd go in with a blind stab guess...
---
He seems to be around B. He doesn't scratch top tier, but he's definitely not bad. You might be able to get away with him at high ranks.

Every single update buffing her had a nerf as well. And in all cases, they hurt her more than the buff helped her.
---
Because teabagging in this game is funnier, can't see other games where it's better, I like to see killers tilting and swaying their head up and down when the down me, I love the thrill of it, I love when they stay there on hook watching me hanging and I can feel their rage so much that I burst of laugh everytime and makes me happy. Especially because I run kindred and other surv can see the killer is camping so they end game and the killer finish 1/4.
---
r/dbdgonewild

So I came back after a month break from the game, and this is what happend. So, this game, they all escaped (again, as stated, I didn't try to get a 4k, or even a 1k.) I have my profile set to mostly private, so, this 4head went to my picture, to comment there, because I left early, because I was scared? idk either. My profile description is, something like, I capitlise on survivors misstakes etc, but, that was a while ago. And besides, this was a P3 Legacy Claudette, what'd you expect?
---
No. Trapper was always messed up with his family business. But I do agree with wraith. I think that wraith and spirit are probably the least eager. The spirit just made the deal with the entity for revenge on her father. She didn‚Äôt make it so that she could spend her life killing.
---
this cant be true....Neo looks hot...
---
Duck you
---
(Why does this to have to be ducking true? RIP killers main)
---
"Sneak" killers I think always feel OP because I'm bad at the game and keep listening for a heart beat. The pig, ghostface, and Sexy Myers have all made me scream loud enough to wake my kids when I notice them just watching me.
---
Also, I know that I am supposed to ignore this type of behaviour, but, I couldn't resist.
---
People will always cry though, so trying out can only bring good results, especially if it's on something like the PTB and not on live. You can gather feedback and decide then. I mean I bought Kate and I can't use any of her perks since they're all pretty meh or straight up trash :D something I'd love to see is having surv's have a nonteachable perk that only they can have, that way you can limit OP perk combos and stale metas. As an example for people who'll always cry, R6 Siege introduced a pick and ban system for their ranked and a shitton of people started crying, but the biggest part of ranked players said it's much better now, and almost all polls the devs did showed that, but those people don't open up 15 redditposts a day telling everyone they like the new system
---
The reason you get less points when someone dies first hook is because unless you‚Äôre playing with new players if someone dies on first hook it is because you camped the survivor the whole time. It‚Äôs unfun for the survivors and as a killer it does not show that you‚Äôre very skilled.  
---
Yes there‚Äôs times where camping is the smartest play, specifically when gates are open. However a lot of killers will just camp their first hook. I don‚Äôt see why a killer should rank up doing this in the same way killers who don‚Äôt do this get rewarded.
---
It's probably because the only Halloween movies worth watching are 1, 3, and the 2018 one. Everything else just makes Micheal less scary and adds stupid lore that doesn't need to exist or make sense. Carpenter had a plan and only even bothered to make 2 because money. He's blatantly said it was a cash grab.
---
Why do you care so much about what I do guy?

[here‚Äôs a link to a video by the devs about pig  ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

In the 2018 story line he was caught shortly after where he received medical attention. The other timeline isn't really worth discussing.

---
damn, you lucky
---
45M BP? I think you meant 1000+ hours because I have 170M BP with 2400hours.
---
I agree, would be great if they add his friend Rod as well tho
---
\*mother... fucking... TSA\*
---
Considering many Elder Gods in things like Lovecraft are associated with stars, makes sense.
---
 I can't read minds, I don't know if you're staying because you are giving free points, or because you want the achievent, or simply because you want to rub your escape on my face... All I know is that I'll hit you like a pi√±ata if I see you in the exit gates. 
---
P. S. If you appreciate your items you shouldn't be giving free hits to a killer running Franklin's, it's not like you can turn off the perk during the match.
---
Nope but if for whatever reason EAC does detect it the devs have stated they won‚Äôt help you so it‚Äôs a do at your own risk type of thing
---
He's still human. Just has a supernatural drive and obsession with a random babysitter. It's all left purposefully vague to be scarier and the sequels wanted to make it clear for some reason while only making things more confusing.
---
That‚Äôs the main point of madness is the screaming. The illusions aren‚Äôt an issue the screaming interrupting actions or snapping out of it are only an issue if he already found you and if he has then it‚Äôs fair that his only power should be effective somewhat in a chase but the majority of that chase is going to be decided by how well he times his shocks and outsmarting at loops. 
---
His madness itself isn‚Äôt a problem people usually have it‚Äôs the screaming and the doctor knowing exactly where you are part that usually bothers them. The only other effects madness even has are illusionary pallets, doctor illusions, exhaustion and longer snapping out of it times those effects aren‚Äôt constant and aren‚Äôt in every game with the doctor either. I think neutering his strongest early game advantage is sufficient enough and Vigil needs a different change or buff that doesn‚Äôt specifically target one killer again.
---
Idk how many hours I've put in, PSN doesn't track as far as I'm aware. I play quite a bit tho, been rank one multiple seasons.
---
Also BHVR knows that's why there's a proximity penalty that's why you have perks against camping (allthough obviously they should be passive because camping is braindead and I shouldn't have to waste 2 perkslots just to not get camped).
---
Where is the teabag penalty? Why doesn't BHVR ever adress this epidemic of bming survivors? &gt;!BECAUSE THEY DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CRYBABY BULLSHIT YOU SILLY KILLERMAIN FUCKBOYS, WEHHHHHH TEABAGGGGG WEHHHHHHHHHHHHH stfu you're so embarassing man, you're like the nerdy kid in school who couldn't figure out that the reason he got bullied wasn't because he was a fucking nerd it was because he got supertriggered by it 24/7 holy fuck grow the fuck up you're such childish pussies.!&lt;
---
The killer was a trapper who was camping last hook and hatch because they were so close but I managed to unhook the guy (died anyways woops) and escape through hatch (he had traps on all sides but he ended up stepping in one of them lmao while waiting for it to open).
---
&gt; Hell yes. This game brings no joy
---
Killer*
---
No
---
Not allowed
---
I mean it's pretty ridiculous they would even think about nerfing pig when spirit and nurse exist. I guess she's just a hard killer for new survivors to deal with?
---
BUT EAC told us they don‚Äôt really care about anything that doesn‚Äôt give you a gameplay advantage so you can always reach out to them for an unban
---
No so much killer mains, more like actually decent people.
---
Reddit it's not for you bro haha, way to go insulting people and wanting to be taken seriously.
---
It's canonical to leave Bill and let him die while everyone else escapes.
---
It's always a nice surprise to see a killer who doesn't make it impossible to enjoy the game. And survivors who don't farm you for points while sandbagging you so you get rehooked. 
---
I try to message all the nice ones with a thank you after the match since win or lose, those games are usually super fun.
---
No not that game, probably a moba of sorts
---
I was waiting for this one
---
Oh... I was gonna ask you if you'd play swf sometime...
---
But my pc is crapüò´üò≠
---
You got 45M BP. Takes about 1M BP for a level 40 char. I think you got enough to get every Killer and Surv to 40. So unlocking every teachable is possible, no need for the shrine. And stay calm dude.
---
Lmao this is perfect
---
And the hash slinging slasher
---
Ze Zapper
---
You already have an advantage it being a 1v1, does it really need to activate on the last survivor
---
Balanced Landing. Reason being because while the sprint speed is absolutely amazing, it has an ability that works even when you‚Äôre exhausted. The 75% less stagger when falling from heights is a lifesaver alone and having a speed boost while not exhausted is phenomenal.
---
Can you make the killer drop a survivor with a firecracker, the amount of times people blind me with them while I‚Äôm holding a survivor during events is a shit ton but it never makes me drop the survivor.
---
Wow diversion and borrowed vs a facecamper, hows rank 18 treating you buddy?
---
The killers internet was like, malfunctioning so there's not really a reason to NOT use pallets to get as many points as you can, and hopefully black pip.

aww :(((

More motivation to beat them with skill not by standing around proving to them how easily triggered you are and how childish of a pussy you are, but congratulations on being all those things.
---
I don‚Äôt like him either, but he is skilled and gives some good advice
---
But you don't have fun. Personally I never cared for pipping or depiping especially for others, so why should that make me feel better? I just want to play the game

I got the best tip: if you don't like someone, don't watch them.
---
What's the reason for trying to push other people away from watching him?
---
I know about all the addons for killer, this isnt a they cant use their power thing, this is a they have add ons for a power that they didnt use for the entire round
---
In his defense, his opinion is clearly more relevant than yours. Go QQ to your friends...if you have them. No one is making you watch him. My guess is in some way you're jealous of his success.
---
When a survivor is being chased by a killer and does a quick turn around the killer
---
So, you're complaining about tru3, DISCUSSING, possible changes they could make to improve the game. He's not telling them they need to do this, like anyone he's expressing his opinion, which he is entilted to by the way, and people are just having a go at him for it. It's quite pathetic to be honest. But hey, if you need to create a reddit post about this, like its going to do anything, to make yourself feel better, go for it man.
---
It‚Äôs funny how you were saying that he complains too much in his chat but here you are complaining about him when all he said was swf should get a debuff

Impossible to swallow pill: Nobody cares about your "fun". Everyone playing the game paid for it (barring free weekends) and can play it however they want within the TOS. People like you deserve to get camped.

Anyone have the full video?

I meant the nea
---
Hmm odd, I‚Äôve been completely blinded for like 4 seconds but not gotten stunned or dropped the survivor in hand
---
Noed does, so why should rancor not activate?
---
Too bad that the definitions of camping and tunneling are different for every survivor, because the "Rulebook for Survivor Fun Times" is always being revised. I hope your next five games feature good old Leatherbilly with a nice tall glass of go fuck yourself.
---
Research how licensing works before you try to comment on it.
---
he legit helps me play the game better
---
same reason why anyone watches anything because they just like it
---
i'm very confused as to why you're bringing up Identity V in the DBD subreddit?
---
Hmmmmmm
---
Im still setting up perks so its gonna be done soon. I just hate when BBQ perk not display in bloodweb of my doctor :(. Im poor luck
---
who else hits the last survivor as clown when they are on a hook and laughs at them
---
*Toxic survivors using the flashlight for its intended purpose*
---
Ahhh, thanks!
---
The sad truth of the matter is things like this are a buff to killers who camp and tunnel.
---
Anything that works is a legitimate strategy. Most of the survivors who complain about camping are in the potato ranks where that shit works.
---
My mind is blown. Take my upvote
---
Watch as they eventually release shirtless Myers and it will be even more expensive than the pig's leather outfit
---
I like where this is going
---
Because noed specifies gates are powered, rancor doesn't.
---
Who cares whether or not people watch him lol. It doesn't affect you at all. I don't like him either and agree that he has fucking dumb opinions. His entire community is accepted as a meme in the dbd community. All of the good players know that he isn't very good and his stream is full of people that have no idea how to play the game. He claims that he wants the killer to "be the power role" without forgetting the fact that its a video game and you have to actually be good at the game to kill everyone. You arent entitled to a 4k just because you are a killer. Imagine playing a shooter game and thinking that you are entitled to kill everyone without any skill just because you have a gun LUL. He also openly admits that he plays with 3000 dpi on his mouse. If you are playing with that high of a dpi you can't even complain about anything. At that high of a dpi nothing will be consistent and its not a surprise he misses so many hits on survivors.
---
Yea but how do u know what direction to run in
---
It's a pretty calm answer, it's just saying try not to make ignorant statements, especially about something as complicated as rights and franchises
---
It really just comes down to a shit map layout and/or a god tier looper.  I also struggle when you add in multiple get out of jail free cards to a decent team.
---
This can be in purple or red ranks depending on the time of month.
---
Doesn‚Äôt the killer have to look at your direction for spine chill tho? With premonition you can get a heads up before the killer even knows you‚Äôre near them, so if you‚Äôre not in a good place to loop you have a head start to make it somewhere before they even know you‚Äôre there, or if you‚Äôre a P3 Claudette you can find a nice bush to hide in
---
Sounds pretty cool
---
Found the survivor main.
---
You forget about the Clapper , the mapper  , and the slacker
---
Because it's surprisingly the only "competition" to DBD (and hardly so)
---
Exactly! I always thought the randomization of traps made things unfun. Without it she‚Äôd have enough room to be a viable killer through buffs
---
You can master her blinks fairly quick , for the power she has when you do so, it should be WAY harder to play her. She ignores all the chasing fundamentals, if you play vs a godtier nurse theres litsrally nothing you can do, if she sees you, you are dead. Nurse is the killer that needs a nerf the most , and asap. For starters she shouldnt have a lounge attack, if she can ignore structures and objects the least they can do is make her all the time like tier 1 myers, only small shirt attack. Spirit is def the second one to need something, you literally dont need to be good at the game and you can still secure kills, which doesnt make much sense. Prayer beads have a simple solution, no sound for survivors? Take the sound off for her as well when she is phasing. You need to have some kind of balance if the add on is super broken. Killer main here btw.
---
I'm rank 7
---
ok
---
Nurse used to have 3 base blinks and 115% movespeed. People who butch about her now obviously didn't play back then.
---
Nah im actually a killer main im not very good at survivor lol.
---
ikr
---
She's not unbeatable, she's just hard to counter. But if she doesn't play with the rules of the game you also can't use the assets the game has. I mean the easiest way to counter the Nurse is by being immersed and ultra sneaky, The best way to not die against a nurse is simply not being seen
---
Use Spine Chill as others have said, or just try predict the killer - look out for BBQ by hiding in a locker or behind a gen (you'll know if they come straight to you after hooking someone, they could just be patrolling but doesn't hurt to be cautious), don't do gens that the killer is constantly coming back to/knows is on high progress, don't alert the killer etc
---
Hopefully never
---
And the zapper.  
---
*Oh, wait*
---
I feel you. Had a game yesterday on Mother's Dwelling and I was trying to get the top gen. I was super relaxed and the second I turn my camera, a Ghostface popped up from behind the door and grabbed me off
---

Tru3's not the problem, a lot of his fanbase is. They feed his ego, much like most streamers. He is somewhat philosophical, but not to the degree that he seems to believe he is. Hearing him constantly talk about how logical he is (and that one time that he said he's all about "expelling ignorance") is a big turn off for me. I enjoy discussion about balance as much as the next guy, but he doesn't really strike me as the type that's in it for the discussion as much as he is for himself. Again, his fanbase feeds his ego.
---
Is he problematic for the DbD community? I dunno. If he is, he's certainly not as problematic as Ochido was. TydeTyme too, after his whole twitter rant. Sometimes Tru3 reminds of TydeTyme...just more conventionally attractive. And British.
---
I agree with the consensus that if you don't like him, don't watch him. Nothing to really gain by fighting public opinion on a twitch streamer.
---
For EVERY sacrifice? No way, offerings are already super easy to get for killers.
---
Def wraith imo. I play frequently both wraith and pig tho. They are fun, and being hard its a challange i like to have, anyone can do good with spirit or nurse, but how many of them can do well with wraithy boi?
---
It's just the Crapper but the hand is off screen
---
I don't care what they do with the nurse. I'm an old nurse main who migrated to stealth killers. But can you fuckin' blame people for being apprehensive? Look at what they did with Legion. Freddy was a pleasant surprise, but BVHR generally doesn't engender confidence with their reworks.
---
He‚Äôs good at the game and provides good tips without even saying a word, just watching him can help newer players a lot. I no longer whiff window hits thanks to this guy.
---
Probably because you slugged them.
---
stealth counters her, but stealth doesn't give you blood points
---
Holy shit that was smooth
---
And in the movie the ‚Äùkiller‚Äù hypnotizes you to take your body.
---
Basically that could be replaced by the entity taking your soul and the killer puttin his brain inside your body.
---
Lol if you don't like watching him, then just don't man
---
Skill ceilings can create satisfying experiences for both survivors and killers, and we definitely need more high skill caps on both.
---
Love how the dude doesn‚Äôt even check if the kid is okay
---
So they gonna go down the old fortnite/apex route to milk this baby for everything it's got shoulda noticed when they added the auric cells
---
So, because he makes a living doing what he enjoys, its perfectly okay to be sniped by people who change their profile names and shit to target him and his girlfriend on a personal level? Sounds more to me like you're unhappy with your own life.
---
Personally I‚Äôm all for this :3
---
IKR
---
"just waste every pallet on the map bro, bloodlust doesn't exist bro". You're 100% a killermin who never faced a MM with this setup.
---
Fix dead hard. you get no dash nor protecion.
---
(PC) bonus blood points from offerings/perks not being displayed on end game results.
---
That Jason is the Friday the 13th: the Game.
---
The only version they'd even *possibly* get the rights to is the remake one, and even that's highly unlikely.
---
Lol, and then survivors yell at killers for tunneling.... OK
---
As I killer I could have easily sneaked up to you behind you and trapped you there, be careful,
---
I just can't imagine trying to get it up when you keep hearing that glass cracking sound when she uses her power. God it makes me cringe
---
I agree, red rank nurses are literally unbeatable.
---
it's hangry
---
Ohhh that's why a survivor I was with escaped with one on his head and didn't die
---
I think it foes it automatically for some stupid reason
---
Say it louder for the people  in the back
---
It's always been a shitty system, but I wouldnt stress too much about pips. They literally mean nothing. Casually hit rank 1 every reset back when I played religiously. The games don't get better skill wise, just longer Q times and less fun all around.
---
Yeah they killed the strategy of using your traps after the gens are finished.
---
This is accurate AF.
---
the remake one is my favorite tbh
---
the Best feeling ever lol
---
All it means is that they‚Äôve put a lot of bloodpoints into that character. This community, I swear. You put yourself in the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna lose‚Äù mentality before you even start, just because of a stupid cosmetic.
---
I really like macready for a survivor, though that's probably just cuz I freaking love The Thing
---
Marry me
---
Stupid sexy Myers.
---
I personally don't mind it too much. The battle pass will have two tracks to progress, one free track and one paid track, but the only rewards are cowmetics, so you don't miss out on anything by ignoring it completely. If they start putting bloodpoints or items/add-ons though I'm gonna be pretty angry
---
 Of course it doesn't affect and the timing is the same, but it's way harder to hit if the pointer is moving at like 15 frames per second
---
Don't nerf the precious squeal
---
Flashlight clicking is the intended use? TIL.
---
No seriously, I didn't even notice I had teammates.
---
I had that happen 5 games like that yesterday. Offerings and addons used and abused. RIP Pudding.
---
PS4
---
Sometimes I get a "No Network Connection" message when my internet is actually working fine.  
---
Once or twice, I've been disconnected while in a game because of this.
---
Missionary Anal eh? Classic.
---
#Buff Miss piggy oink oink oink
---
I hate it when Nurse strikes at me from the couch with her lounge attack
---
Her traps need more pressure.
---
No one ever said "wait don't pop the last gen I still have my trap on!"
---
And I think that's what should be going through people's headset when she's fixed
---
There ya go
---
Dead hard's OP? You are just a bad killer if you think it is.
---
This is a ridiculous comment, are you seriously suggesting the opinion of someone who has played for a couple days at rank 20 are as important as someone with 3k hours across every rank and role in the game?
---
When will we see expansion of the Trapper Family? We want the Fapper!üò©
---
I've said it once and I'll say it over again; Hex: Ruin
---
i just hit rank 15 as a killer last night.  my 2nd match i played against this REALLY awful team  and i wondered if they were messing with me or if they were just bad.  
---
well after the game ended  i saw that 3 of em were rank 20s and 1 was a 19.  so it made sense why it was so easy for me but damn why did they get matched up with me?
---
He said it‚Äôs ‚Äòhatlrd to find ultrarare‚Äô add ons in the title, he doesn‚Äôt have any reason to complain about offerings when killers get the most blood points and have no items unlike survivors, therefore each bloodweb only has add ons if you‚Äôve prestiged so much that you have no perks left. Don‚Äôt see your point here
---
And it feels like randomazation itself is broken. It's either first box or last, never second or third.
---
This so much.
---
Started this game 2weeks ago on xbox and the party system is really annoying.
---
To all the people putting Ghostface and Pig of all killers in C tier or higher, please get past green ranks.
---
Some people think it‚Äôs useless. I‚Äôm not quite sure what it‚Äôs for, I think just the lower the rank the more skilled the player is at the game. But it‚Äôs not always accurate because I‚Äôve met some pretty smart people in the lower ranks. I like to stay somewhat low because people in the high ranks don‚Äôt know how to lose.
---
Yeah he cant play huntress because he openly admits that he plays at 3000 dpi. He never got the memo that lower dpi is better. It's part of the reason why he isn't very good at the game.
---
So what? Ruin + Omegablink against a non-swf is an Auto-Win every time in red ranks, I don't give a shit how it used to be, it's oppressive as fuck now and it needs to be changed.
---
I don't know why people bodyblock, in general, when they are the only ones there to take a hit. I have seen SO many people let the killer hit them when person being hooked wasn't even close to wiggling off. It's really only worth it when more than 1 person can take a hit and you know the person can wiggle off.
---
I wish I hadn't seen this.
---
Yeah I suppose, but are they in every characters bloodweb or no?
---
Survivor meta is Adrenaline, Dead hard and DS, last one is ur decision
---
As killer Ruin is meta, and that‚Äôs it u can choose between Discordance 1/2, BBQ, Nurses, Whispers 3 is a godlike perk.
---
I clicked on this and I hoped to get the ‚Äúcan‚Äôt reach this subreddit‚Äù, but I was sorely disappointed
---
Oddly enough I always hear ghost face because he just sounds like a gimp roaming around in that leather lol.
---
Everything you just said describes spine chill.
---
Looks like every other finished score board.
---
Don't get too hooked with the killer, it's a weird experience I tell you.
---
Well are you playing survive with friends or solo ? There are different "best perks" for each . Although generally there are some meta perks such as Sprint burst or balenced landing . If you're playing solo deliverence might be a good idea. Self care is a must either way. I like to run urban evasion too just to avoid being found sometimes. Other good perks are dead hard, borrowed time. Prove thyself or leader are good if you're playing with friends bond can help out if you're not but still want to run one . I hear spine chill is good too. Decisive strike is good if you can hit it even after it's nerf. Just play around and find your play style and go from there.
---
Play a few more matches you will get higher rank survivors than you. Even if you get someone from rank 10 and 12 lemme know how it goes.
---
r/shitpostcrusaders
---
I mean I figure if the killers looking in your direction they know you‚Äôre there so you don‚Äôt have nearly as big of a head start right? I never used it so I‚Äôm just thinking based off of its description
---
Play with your food is good with some setup. Dying Light is just a tunneling perk though
---
Like I always say 
---
Goto any stream and pick any random time and within 10 minutes he'll be complaining about something, it is what he does best followed by bring barely average at a game he literally plays close to twice the amount hours of hours per week that most people work at a real job, which pretty much explains his simmering rage.. having to face that fact all day long, day in and out. Poor bastard.
---
oh yea ive had some games where i was wondering how the hell i got matched up with them.   where their lowest rated was a 12 and the other 3 were 7, 8 and 5.   i mean i  barely even got 1 hit
---
Diversion does not work if it hits walls or lockers. I believe this is on all platforms. It would make this perk useful if it correctly worked
---
You have my upvote
---
I‚ÄôM THROWING AWAY MY HUMANITY JOJO

Oh so they actually are getting dedicated servers? I just kept seeing joke posts about how we were never going to get them

What problematic things did Ochido do rofl?

---
Loading Screen Tip: Did you know you can press B twice to jump higher?
---
Killers the general meta is barbaque and chili, ruin, devour hope and agitation or iron grasp there are other perks which help like haunted grounds spirit fury bamboozle and pop goes the weasel. Once again play around and see what you like but you really cant go wrong with barbaque ruin devour hope and iron grasp or agitation.
---
Yes. They actually tested it on the PTB a few months back but had to make some big changes before the next test time
---
If anyone needs to be nerfed, it's The Doctor. I don't think I've ever won a match against him as a survivor.
---
Harder to swallow pill: Tunneling is not inherently toxic or a point of criticism and getting a player out early is simply the smart thing to do. There are already numerous perks that counter tunneling in the game, and the emblem system also penalizes for it, so tunneling doesn't even happen that often.
---
This is so sad please buff UE
---
Also people shouldn't downvote this just because they don't want advice and just want Freddy nerfed, lol.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen multiple times. Contacted tech support and they said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre working on it‚Äù. It‚Äôs just frustrating because now I‚Äôve de pipped to level 12 and I was 5-6, the survivors at this level are terrible...
---
Comments like this crack me up, especially the mention of a "real job". You're just dripping with envy and clearly so dissatisfied with your own life that you have to invent this narrative that a successful streamer is bad at what he does and has "simmering rage" to make yourself feel better lol 
---
He makes a decent living doing what he enjoys and has a hot girlfriend. I sincerely doubt he's losing any sleep over it, mate.
---
I still cant get over the fact that such an iconic killer has copy paste add-ons for years and his own add-ons are worthless.
---
You bait the dead hard, then you swing. If they use it to make it to a pallet, all other exhaustion perks would be better which would give them more distance. Its not OP.
---
r/foundthetoxicsurvivor
---
Unfortunaly there's a thing called Aim assist in the game, very cancerous to use IMO.
---
But don't you think going to that 1 Box slows it down enough? 
---
The Box has fast and hard skill checks unless that was just a pig add on
---
With gold express coming this year, there will be real competition to dbd
---
They implemented a new matchmaking system a while ago. I don‚Äòt think they specified how the new one works exactly, but one of the effects is that killers queue for a lobby like survivors, like you described. The new system has shorter wait times overall apparently.
---
So if a Spirit gets a 4k they potentially get four new prayer beads add ons? No thanks.
---
Bragging rights.
---
I play both, mostly killer for the bbc blood points and survivor for short queue times, but i enjoy the gameplay of both survivor and killer.
---
Why am i not allowed to do bad as killer or survivor, of course i try to be good at which role im playing, BUT IF I HAPPEN TO DO BAD i am told to kill myself, uninstall and 'get gud' (yeah bud that is why i am playing,) the killer never really complains, it is always survivors
---
Got a bad killer? great easy points
---
Got a good killer? great experience? no? 
---
IT IS NEVER ENOUGH TO JUST SAY THAT THE GAME WAS FUN, GOOD OR EVEN GG
---
CAN I JUST BE ALLOWED TO DO BAD SOMETIMES
---
i just want to play DBD and not feel attacked :(
---
Tbh I think Spirit requires more practice then Nurse... But I also don't think Spirit's OP with her Add-Ons. (Yeah, Prayer Beads needs to be changed, but I think they should just make it an Ultra-Rare and call it a day.) 
---
Besides, Spirit is pretty easy to counter. Spine Chill+Iron Will destroys her if you're smart about it. She can't mind game you, you know when she's phasing to you, even if you're in her terror radius, and she won't be able to hear you if injured in Tier 3 Iron Will. 
---
That goes for all killers really too. I've been running those two perks together since I've started the game, and they've saved my ass more then once
---
Today, versus a Freddy, a Jake ran across the entire length of the map to reach me on my hook... and then ran right past me. I went into phase 2 before he ran back and unhooked me. I think his alarm clock was back there somewhere and he prioritized waking himself up, because he was awake when he came back.
---
I've always found the Wraith's lore to be a little confusing. What's listed on his page could be read two ways - he was either an innocent man just wanting a fresh start in a new country, or he was fully aware that his car crushing place was a murder factory but pretended not to know. 
---
&gt;Philip Ojomo came to this country without anything than hope for a new beginning. He was happy as he got offered a job at Autohaven Wreckers. A small scrap yard where bribed cops turned a blind eye for the somewhat shady business that took place.
---
&gt;Ojomo didn't care. He had seen criminal activity up close in his homeland and as long as he didn't get involved, he let things be. He just fixed cars and handled the crusher. Something he did really well. A car went in and a small, metallic cube came out.
---
&gt;It was not until one gloomy day that he, just by accident, saw some blood coming from one of the un-crushed cars. As he opened the trunk he found a young man, gagged and with tied hands with panic filled eyes. Ojomo freed the man who managed to run ten feet before Ojomo's boss stopped him and slit his throat. As Ojomo demanded answers he got explained to him that he'd been nothing more than a simple executioner as more or less every car had a soul in them as this was a "service" the scrap yard provided to certain "clients".
---
&gt;Ojomo snapped and went ballistic. He threw his boss in the crusher and let it slowly compress, as the head stuck out, Ojomo grabbed it and pulled head and spine out of the body. Then he left and was never seen again.
---
I'd like to think he had no idea it was happening, but maybe his ability to disappear is like his ability to turn a blind eye. But the way he freed the man and killed his boss indicates he wanted the murders to stop. Ack, I'm torn.
---
Killer doesn‚Äôt have to look in your direction for premonition
---
I‚Äôm getting the special edition for free actually Xbox gamepass  has the game
---
He's been perma-banned from this game despite how much shit the devs normally let slide. I think that says enough.
---
Digging the Frankenstein thing.
---
Jockstrap david when?
---
Nope it does not. Because not all survivors will go to a box right away when they have a helmet on, not unless it is blinking. So no it really is not enough of a slow down.
---
-"GG EZ baby killer just learn to play better"
---
-"How about we switch places, you play M1 killer and i call my buddies so we can swf with BL and insta heals on Haddonfield?"
---
-"LOL your (sick) just bad learn to play"
---
I must say people in this game are something else sometimes.
---
Could be useful on Mount Ormond
---
You can't derank from 16-20, only rank up.
---
The only way to derank past rank 15 is rank reset on the 13th of every month.
---
*party starter
---
"Hunter" made me laugh

---
Spine chill my dudes, never get sneaked again
---
You said he gets an ultra rare every bloodweb, which he does not.
---
NO
---
Drag me.
---
I've tried both and level 3 premonition only has 30 seconds for a cool down and it's not even that bad. I play with my homies and if they ain't getting chased and my premonition goes off, 9/10 times killer is coming towards and they don't even know I was there besides the genny making the clunk sounds, also in my head if something has a cool down and a similar ability doesn't the one with the cool down 100% of the time is the better ability because why does this ability have one and the other one doesn't....... another bonus is that you have to be looking in the killers direction so it forces you to look around and you don't get jump scares anymore.... I find spine chill to be to close of a prock and I don't have enough time to get out it's to glitchy compared to premonition IMO
---
Did something similar the other day. Was playing ghostface on haddonfield and a Claudette ran into a dead end room in one of the houses. I just so happen to be right behind her, blocking the door by accident, I stood there for a minute as she ran a circle in the small room before we stared at each other for another minute, I stepped back and let her run out of the house. It was pretty comical to me.
---
I have been looking at the forums and I know what you are talking about lol like the pls nerf posts I promise you I won‚Äôt
---
He also thinks he is the best killer in the game, he is good but nowhere near the best.
---
I've failed
---
Too many people said yes sorry bud
---
ü§ß
---
I'm expecting them to compensate for her nerfs like they said... At some point... Hopefully...
---
I‚Äôm not he bad guy *duh*
---
Oh I usually do. I guess other people don't.
---
I just remember spending almost the whole match trying to get their trap off because I kept failing the skill checks and picking joke boxes.
---
Yeah bitch!
---
90% of the time it‚Äôs being clicked to get another survivors attention or because the survivor clicking it is just bored.
---
Maybe it should be the trapped survivor needs to find the key from just 3 boxes with a maximum of 5 boxes if you add 2 add ons that add boxes, in about 1:30 seconds then in order to remove the trap the survivor needs to find another survivor to  free them from the trap, and as a bonus the trapped survivor sees the auras of other survivors the only thing stopping them from freeing themselves is if either they lack communication from other survivors if they are not swf (making pig deadly to solo players), or most survivors are in a chase or busy. Needless to say the traps also makes other survivors involved to save other trapped survivors or risk them being sacrificed.
---
How? He stops loops and you'll eventually catch someone with his power.
---
You can avoid shit in your profile by making your profile comments friends only. That is if we're talking about Steam.
---
Yup, 130k in rituals I think? Maybe 135k? I have a mori ritual, a chase survivor ritual, and then the 'use your power' Plague ritual.
---
Finally someone using this format correctly, instead of making it another "fact" template üôè
---
The Pig is this game's Blackbeard
---
I dont need moris. I need addons for myers and ghostboi
---
Here's some explanations: Its based on how well a killer will do at red ranks on average. So we don't assume the killer goes in there with no addons, but we don't assume they have red addons every games. We also consider that the killer can be unlucky with a shit map.
---
wait did you make a rank 3 disconnect?
---
Yeah sounds superserious.
---
Let's be honest though, the only reason everyone doesn't like ochido is because they're salty killermains who don't like people teabagging and flashlightclicking aka "bullying the killer" just admit it guys, it's pretty obvious.
---
If they don't, they'll face the wrath of r/oinkers
---
I don't get it
---
r/justa
---
he lagged out
---
Freddy us actually really good now, not being able to tell from where hes coming while sleeping, combined with good placed Snares and the ability to teleport to gens, even if it gets completed, are really strong
---
i just wanna have fun ):
---
ty
---
I just consider having fun as a win at this point honestly
---
Problem is that the gas doesnt go well through walls and he gets severly slowed down when charging up the throw
---
No they aren't. Unless the game breaks and you can't do the objective or something, no match is unwinnable.
---
Spine Chill works like a charm: when I started using it, I was finally free from turning my camera left and right everywhere!
---
huntress
---
So I did a bit of research, and they won't hunt any human. If they feel threatened they will kill, but their main hunt is the strongest. They take trophies from the strongest warriors as prizes and that is why they hunt. Again yes they will kill if they're defending themselves, but if worthy, they will take the spinal cord and head.
---
I love when the dbd and rpdr communities overlap. You are giving the gays everything they want.
---
Those are the most fun games imo, it actually is a __horror__ game, and can scare you. Going up again a billy is just... annoying, not particularly scary.
---
You so end up with an unbalanced game if you're not balancing for lower levels.
---
Ouch.
---
Tru3‚Äôs fanbase is a bigger problem than Tru3 himself. You can‚Äôt really discuss about the game‚Äôs balance there whatsoever because they‚Äôll rapidly accuse you of being ‚ÄúlE eNtItLeD sUrViVoR MaIn‚Äù or something. They are also quick to flock towards any post that has an ounce of criticism against him.
---
Would a good idea be to only allow 1 perk for each survivor? And maybe only allow two perks for each killer and if they have the same perk it wouldn‚Äôt stack. Also if two killers are chasing one survivor that would give time for the other 5 6 or 7 survivors to repair gens since both killers are occupied. Also if the map is bigger there could be more obstacles and buildings to the survivors could loop. And the killers couldn‚Äôt be the same killer. Your points were very valid but tell me what you think of my adjustments.
---
I mean he's better than he was for sure but he doesnt seem that strong honestly. Definitely better than a lot of other killers but not #1-5 imo
---
Nope. I only slug if every survivor is injured and is close to me.
---
Lol maybe she jumped in the pool
---
*Deathgarden PTSD intensifies*
---
Happened to me too once! Looked so funny. I think it was because of low ping
---
That's how it's worked in every game that's remotely competitive
---
Whenever a trapper hears a survivor step in his trap he nuts.
---
imo he absolutely deserves the Tier under Billy, maybe even the same
---
To the closest pallet
---
Yup. I know they ain't obligated to do anything for me, but damn if they could give me a break sometime lol. Kinda feeds their ego when they get an "ez escape"
---
Brown Medkit only has enough charges for one heal, failing a skill check reduces the amount that's completed,  so by failing a skill check the media won't heal you all the way,  this being worthless
---
Smh my comment was a joke too you ü§°
---
Ahh kk, that makes sense
---
Fair. Like i said its all subjective, there is no right or wrong and at the end of the day it mostly depends on the pilot, not the plane. I have played against old freddies who were better than really good billies
---
I'm pretty sure you picked Claudette by accident.
---
You glossed over every actual example of griefing/exploiting that Ilya already mentioned, I don't need to state it twice. "yeah sounds superserious". Well, yeah, it kind of is, and that's why - like I already fucking said - *he was perma-banned from Dead by Daylight.*
---
What did they do to her?
---
I mean its not that subjective when the game literally tells you if you won or not. 
---
I mean your child can be in fourth place in his Karate competition, and you call that a "win".... but its not a win.
---
Yes officer this post right here
---
Trapper, Hillbilly(he was born with that face), Huntress
---
It would mean once someone is hooked with a trap after gate open it'd be basically impossible to escape
---
dont forget slower repair when asleep if hes using the right addons.
---
Im just here excited for Meg sweater lol
---
Not screaming has really saved my behind against the doctor. But for other killers, it is kinda weak. Could also time down the grunts while cleansing, just to add on to the idea.
---
she looks like she just got some sass
---
So, according to your logic, there's lose, draw, win and super win?
---
Did he use Tinkerer?
---
BHVR has a tendency to needlessly overnerf Pig
---
Funny you posted this... I only recently got the game, and didn't know what Bloodwarden was, my toxic friends that taught me the game told me to Always wait and Tbag.
---
Well last night I was on my deat hook and found out this perk existed. I'm going back to not being a cunt from now on.
---
did queenie get a new nerf?? i‚Äôll cry
---
Got chest grabbed by a Ghostface yesterday. I just wanted that sweet sweet brown toolbox :(
---
ye, the slow down plus the Red Brush are really strong
---
Awwww, bitch!
---
Pretty much yes.
---
You can keep believing that you "won" when everyone escape and you lost a pip, but that's just childish mentality imo.
---
Hey that Myers could have turned into a Hag at any moment.
---
Yea I've definetley noticed it hahaha but I've seen survivors make a killer just look like a pre schooler and I've also seen a killer make a group of survivors cry for there momma so alot of the balancing in this game I think people get confused with a play style, because the only killers I have a problem with are Freddy and legion but Freddy is tolerable now and legion no one plays so idc hahahaha me and my homies change play styles on the fly and it's help to have a perk or two that can help with everykiller and I find spine chill is more helpful with strictly stealth based killers but since you have no idea who your going against premonition is IMO hands down the better choice
---
Adrenaline it‚Äôs gotten me out of so many tough situations
---
I mean, I've never said nor implied that, but carry on being a shithead because your post is poorly made bud.
---
For me, a 4K is a win, a 3K with hatch at most. For you, no matter how shit you are, you think you win if you pip. Get your head out of your ass.
---
Then you are a survivor with a brain
---
no i‚Äôm just dumb
---
That‚Äôs just wraith
---
I wasn't explaing I just... Noted it.
---
&gt; 90% of the time its being clicked to annoy the killer and b8 them so you can run an infinite the whole game
---
FTFY
---
Only if Joel dies in TLOU 2.
---
So no, it's a very bad idea.
---
That seems great as well
---
I think it is; isn‚Äôt it a reference to the EA ‚Äúsurprise mechanics‚Äù thing?
---
Because he has the right to give his opinion?
---
U don‚Äôt lose pip if the match doesn‚Äôt start due to dc.
---
how long have you been working on this? this is really really cool my dude
---
I‚Äôm not your guy buddy
---
r/kidsarefuckingstupid
---
The pool is next to her so hopefully she jumped in.
---
Dude the doctor is like lower/mid tier. He's easy to counter
---
Did you know that any killer that isnt learnt is garbage?
---
I recently picked up Amanda (and killer in general) and I seriously see absolutely no reason for her to be nerfed basically every update. It just blows my mind, she‚Äôs an average mid tier killer. Even when I play survivor I don‚Äôt see her being overpowered or anything at all, she needs some buffs if everything. She‚Äôs still super fun to play as and against.
---
He always boasts about his prowess as killer
---
Ah yeah, good point.
---
But she's asian, so automatically hot no matter what! 
---
you wanna english for me?
---
Godlike
---
And yet pips have been lost.
---
Essentially what I‚Äôve noticed is a bug where it will ‚Äústart‚Äù the match only for it to close out within 10 seconds so your ‚Äúpoints‚Äù are counted and since you got best to 0 you lose a pip
---
Good thing it didn't glitch out for you.
---
Haha nice job taking the literal sense in it wow very cool and inspired comment that was definitely what I meant
---
It really isn't, I think he did that in one single game, it probably got fixed right away, problem solved, I've seen other people stuck in lockers or jumping down the ironworks map and getting stuck inside a pole and everyone thinks those are hilarious but when the flashlight/teabag guy does it now it's serious business? I don't think so, it's hard to admit that "i hate this guy because I suck at killer and I hate people who teabag and flashlight click" because that just makes people sound like babies, so instead they rather find some obscure "exploit he did once" to justify their intense hatred of a guy who really didn't do that much wrong.
---
Same here, but on Xbox - it seems like every time I pip back to 12 I get d/c until I‚Äôm back at 14 or 15 :C
---
This happens too often
---
It the bar gets to 100% he will kill himself and connor.
---
Funny you say that, because the video I posted before this one is about that very glitch lol
---
I  like Tru3.....but lately, he's becoming more and more toxic. I still watch him and enjoy his content because he's a pretty decent Survivor / Killer. I know he likes to say "I'm not a killer main because I play both sides" but it's pretty obvious he's a bit bias. I'll give a few examples of how toxic and arrogant (IMO) the guy can be and how salty he is after a loss - especially playing Killer.  Here is an example of yesterday's stream while doing a Viewer request build playing as Wraith.  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/458193398?t=03h45m52s . (Please pay close attention to how long he chased the Claudette while not even noticing the Ace sitting on the Gen.) While  still chasing the Claudette on an "un-mindgameable" loop, he continues to miss hits while chat is telling him there is an Ace sitting on the Gen. Getting completely frustrated with the chase, the other survivor found a key and exited the game via hatch. Tru3 continues to ignore the Ace while chasing the Claudette. Tru3 then allows the Ace to finish the gen, and catches / kills the Claudette. Instead of saying "Hey I played bad, or gg wp" he goes on to say " I don't give a shit man" after chat was informing him that he allowed a generated to get completed in his face. BTW, the game was over 10+ minutes, I don't know what he classifies as a "quick game" but 10+ minutes isn't quick IMO.
---
Today's stream.  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/458648651?t=02h58m20s  Viewer requested Billy. Please notice  what seems to be sarcasm /satire about how Billy gets looped, etc etc while playing completely like shit. For a little background, Tru3 places Spirit &gt; Billy which has been an ongoing thing with him and Hexy (another popular DBD streamer) when it comes to killer tier list. He did admit after the match he made a "few" mistakes - but judging from his gameplay, I wouldn't say "few" personally. He still managed to capture 3/4 at the end of the match.
---
There is a !nbt command which says "We understand your frustration about the killer/survivor debate, but today we are going to be ignoring it all to just chill and have a chat about other things".  Personally, I find this command funny and a  bit hypocritical. Again, today's stream, he suggested that SWF needs a nerf or some type of penalty while playing together. Instead of following your own command - you complain "voice your opinion" which in terms made chat go into an outrage. Having commands and not following them IMO invites toxicity or unwanted things into your chat.
---
I'm sure you can literally tune into any of his streams and if he gets destroyed or loses as a killer, he will most likely say "it's a SWF group" or something other than just GG wp. On top of all of this, if a viewer gives you $10 to try a build, no need to say how shit said built is when you lose. It was a requested fun build - just play and have fun. You're getting $10 per build. No need to say things like "shit build, idk why anyone would use it"etc etc. It's obvious people tend to request dumb builds for their own entertainment at the expense of the streamer.
---
I will honestly provide more points if need be. This has become an ongoing behavior with Tru3 and it's making his stream less enjoyable to watch. I really hope you take this as constructive criticism. This is by no means a personal attack.
---
Everyone is at the post match lobby? If not u dced so yeah u‚Äôll lose a pip for that but if everyone is there means the match never started so u shouldn‚Äôt lose a pip.
---
This should have way more upvotes. A really nice guide man
---
You did say literally though.
---
No offense man, but you need to use punctuation.
---
*sad oink*
---
Are you going to deny that he is decent? Even the buttmad OP admitted that he's good. He's still never said he's the best killer, and you are spreading bullshit by saying he did.
---
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
---
Sorry, I'm just tired of hearing "NuRsE oP lIterAlLy unWiNaBle." Like yeah, she's really strong and I'm sure playing against a good one is extremely difficult, but it's still possible to win.
---
When learnt killer is a no no, bad bad killer is.
---
But can dream pallets respawn?
---
We need more ruin like perks 
---
Maybe something like, for every totem still standing survivors gets a 5% penalty 
---
Basically ruin and thanats baby
---
Basically a single gen slowing perk can change so much and I'd like to not be rng based and just have a flat do x or gens will be slower perk
---
happy cake day! &lt;3
---
He is overrated, he is far from the best killer.
---
i always see people say this but for the ps4, is bill on the other systems?
---
I personaly think one way to change Hexes so that they arent instantly destroyed is that the totem activates when a survivor sees that they are cursed, so ruin and hundreds lullaby dont light up untill a cursed survivor gets a skill check, or 3rd seal doesnt activate until a survivor is hit

---
Thank you for the idea. :) Is there somewhere I can look for other people that play the game? I‚Äôve bought DBD for several of my friends but can‚Äôt seem to get any of them to play.
---
The illusion is very very inconsistent and gives you a broad general area to look in that only goes off every once in a while it‚Äôs partially crippled by the perk and the add-ons aren‚Äôt going to be used every game aka Restraint.
---
A sexualized rotting ghost corpse.
---
So don't chase them then
---
Wait, what nerfs has she gotten? (Been away from DBD for awhile)
---
She is almost impossible to win against if someone knows how to use their blinks
---
I tried to go through both a few times
---
So you agree that they do it for attention from the Killer?
---
Im on sweatbox unfortunately
---
Ah okay, my bad!
---
Wraith is my baby don‚Äôt touch him!
---
Either you're taking me for a ride or you're denser than osmium. 
---
In any case, Ochido was banned for save editing, ban evasion, and numerous reportable offenses, not glitching through map assets for a larf.  
---
You're 100% correct that him being a toxic shitlord was the icing on the cake. Regardless of what your personal definition of "toxic" is, it doesn't change the fact that the devs themselves think he was worth permanently booting from their game. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I have only 3 IQ, can someone help me?
---
There was only one time I actually dcd pn purpose. I was playing doc (I was a new doc) on console and I got the Mount Ormond map. First thing, I couldn't see shit through that storm and to top it off my frames dropped like soneone holding a hot pot. This made survivors very hard to hit and I only got 1 hook, not even a kill. They ended up just circling around me while I couldn't hit them and tbagging at pallets. The reason I didn't dc earlier was because "Hey, maybe it might stop and my FPS will improve, I also brought a rare addon and would like to use it and not waste it" none of this happened. In the end I lost my addons but kept my sanity and was releived I didn't have to play on that stupid map.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean it was meant to be interrupted in the most literal form possible
---
Yes, I agree. Almost impossible. Possibly in need of a nerf.
---
How i'm gonna raise my kids
---
EXACTLY. Oh my god, I feel that so much. I even do the DC/Hatch thing. I try to reward the people that play well cuz I get so salty at the others. I need to try to calm down tho.
---
Devs did say they were gonna nerf her add-ones but maybe not her character :/
---
Bill isn‚Äôt out on console yet. So you can still get his perks as universal perks, until he‚Äôs released. And then you‚Äôll be forced to level him up to get them.
---
Shes the only killer I cannot 360 and i have no idea why

---
To those of you who want an unmasked/Amanda skin for Pig, it may not be as impossible as you think.
---
Doctor needs more than addons rework. From what I got they want to update Nurse, mostly her addons and Doctor(not only addons). Doctor is just garbage,  he needs something in his base kit as well.
---
Don‚Äôt mind,you know there are very nice people in this community ^^
---
From one doc to another, his map pressure would be too good, especially if the exits are close together. Not to mention doctors auras stare at the survivors in tier 2 and with proper addons you can shock them off exit gates like its no biggie.
---
That sounds ok. It's ok for there to be strong characters and or perks, but a good nurse with strong add ons is well past the line of "strong but balanced"
---
No idea why everyone is salivating over this theory. You're way overthinking it. Auric Cells are literally just a made-up currency for microtransactions. They aren't mentioned anywhere else in the game and likely never will be.
---
Legion sucks but he‚Äôs still kind of fun to play. His add ons are garbage. Feral Frenzy is pretty damn weak. He feels essentially like a powerless 115% killer that M1s the entire match. I personally place him bottom tier.
---
That makes way more sense, thank you for clarifying.

You revealed him though?
---
2B from Nier Automata had 300k polygons in justhe her ass. I want 300k polygons on a single nipped on shirtless Myers
---
Well, calling Amanda normal is a pretty long shot
---
Of course. Just it's weird I run into more toxic than anything. But yeah, I met a few nice people. I became a killer main because I wanted survivors to have a chance.
---
There......are.......no........rules
---
I've been trapping windows and and pallates. And some escape routs  when I have someone in the basement. I also haven't been leveling him up as I'm working on getting BBQ and maybe ruin.
---
WAH
---
THIS MUST BE A COSMETIC I NEED IT!
---
The only nerf I think would be necessary for the pig is to make the game machines invisible to her. Every pig I play with just camps the machine. What‚Äôs the point of the headgear if you‚Äôre not actually gonna let it work on its own? You might as well just play the Hag
---
Myers was also labeled as The Shape in the credits of the original movie
---
Fuck leatherface üòÇü§£
---
Meg main big brain
---
Upvote for you. I really don't get why people are praising this theory so much. OP made so many leaps in logic just based on illustrations of a fake currency and a trip through Wikipedia, lol. 
---
 Auric cells only exist to represent microtransactions with players' real-world money. If they had anything to do with the game plot or lore, they'd actually be involved in the game beyond "spend $20 USD for 1000 Auric cells" or what have you.
---
They could be very cool to fit in the game I mean a lot of characters don‚Äôt make sense why they are there like Amanda but they might her fit in a cool way so I think they could find a way to do it
---
It starts in purple ranks already and I don't get it. I get a shitton of US killers in lobbies despite being from EU and I see a lot of asian survivors in my killer lobbies, most of the unwilling to leave which means I have to requeue the 10 minutes of waiting.
---
Seriously, I played since 2016 and April 2017 was officially (see steam charts) the lowest player count and yet the lobbies were so much better, I just don't get it. And then these devs keep repeating that it's not the match making when it obviously is.
---
Premonition is you look in their direction, not the other way around
---
What were you thinking while typing this?
---
They do it because they can. Simple as that. They aren‚Äôt punished for DCing so they will continue to do it. Until dedicated servers come out, we all have to deal with rage quitters
---
Ooooh. So that's what this sound is supposed to be. I always thought her bones are cracking because she moves her hands so much. :D
---
Loading Screen Tip: In order to avoid getting hooked - stay out of the killers sight. 
---
THANKS GAME
---
What if.... every game you brought an ebony mori but it was just part of the "character design" ü§îü§îü§î because then itll be really fun for 20% of the people in game and we gotta boost people to red ranks to help queue time somehow.

Yeah just showing the part where he sends people to report someone, girl doesn't seem very reluctant to do it either, wonder what the person he's "withchunting hurrrr" did, conveniently left that part out.
---
You're a pedo, now you've serious allegations against you as well, it's really sad how far you're willing to go to character-assassinate someone just because he teabagged and flashlightclicked people in a video game.
---
"Even though it was already down" you don't understand how pallets work, do you?
---
yep.
---
She‚Äôs like the Blackbeard of dbd
---
But that's the thing, dead by daylight isn't meant to be a competitive game, it's meant to be a party game. Which is why this game will never be truly balanced lol

HELLO REDDIT USER. I AM BETTER THAN YOU. HAVE A NICE DAY.

Spine chill. I get spooked by the same killers and just always run that until I get better at the game.
---
&gt;Again..
---
It's not really saying it "again" when your original comment provided no feedback besides a baseless remark. But I do understand what you're saying now
---
And her addons need reworked. At times they actively make her worse. Lose 3 traps and two boxes to get a 12 meter aura whilst crouched
---
I thought Bill was out on XBox?
---
"It's not my art but it's pretty cool" then don't fucking post it
---
Credit artists!!!!!
---
Congrats, you're the first DBD character to be able to switch sides mid-trial
---
It's not the only goal. You get basically no points for doing gens quickly, so survivors mostly do it just to flex. The game is designed to reward long matches and completion of multiple objectives.
---
I think it's honestly both. She's covered in shards of glass and her bones are completely disfigured, but cracking glass is the easiest metaphor I can think of to explain the sound.
---
When l4D3 comes out
---
Totems should be placed by the entity from the beginning otherwise the killer would lose to much time trying to find good spots. But it would be nice for the killer to make any totem of his choice as a Hex one. That way Ruin would be better hid than usually or,on the other hand, easier to be spotted by survivors if they sneak up behind the killer. A balanced change I would say but I would have to try it as a killer first to know if it was a good change
---
I‚Äôm so confused by everything you just said but it makes sense to a dumbass like me so, it must be something, if not correct.
---
How are you trying to reason with me? You just keep stating the same shit over and over without backing it up lol
---
I mean I've made certain to maintain that the pedo thing is pure allegations and AFAIK there isn't much concrete evidence to suggest he is one. I didn't even want to bring up the exact details of the topic but I figured I'd give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're just lazy rather than willfully ignorant and practically belligerent.
---
Thanks for wasting mine and everyone else's time. We're done here I guess.
---
Maybe it just injures them everytime a generator goes off until the trap is removed.
---
Teamplay is important in this game
---
Woah hol up. Tampered Timer and Rule Set no. 2 are some of the Pig's best add ons. Otherwise, I totally agree with everything you said.
---
NSFW tag please.
---
true , true
---
10 hours practice, and I'm being generous with that number, does not constitute how viable it is to get a 4k literally every single game regardless of build, add-ons, or the survivors and what they can bring. 
---
Nurse is the strongest killer in the game. Spirit is the second strongest (against good survivors). If you think Spirit is OP, then you need to attest to Nurse being OP as well.
---
Then why is there a ranking system? I like the casual play, but if you're a killer main (like me) you can't really relax when you play. I think there should be separate competitive and casual modes, but either way, it should be balanced for the top of the barrel
---
Leatherface for a couple reasons. First you get BBQ, which if you plan on playing killer often you‚Äôll want (for the BPs). Second he‚Äôs a really good killer to learn on since survivors will loop the fuck out of you.
---
*Blackbeard flashbacks*
---
Every tier list is the same, stop. Seeing the same shit posted by 20+ people in one day pisses me off
---
You seem to be saying people think shes OP because they cant loop her. Its like other survivors dont want to actually learn different tricks to survive instead of relying on loops. There really arnt that many good nurses anywhere. Its not like you're always facing a nurse that'll buttfuck you. Most of the time most nurses are potatoes and constantly overshoot you(even in rank 1 games) so you can juke them and sneak on out of there like its going out of style. Personally I have a vendetta against the shocker but thats because I hate the madness system.
---
I don't think she needs nerfed, but I don't mind her being nerfed as every pig killer I've played against are annoying piles of shit and they seem to get salty easier than any other killer.
---
No.....survivors  get that chance  with me alot everyone dead 1 gen left guess what they do......Hatch sprint.  It's an achievement it's supposed to be difficult.
---
No, it doesn't. It counters KILLERS (sans Doctor). That is not an inherent weakness to Nurse. And she's even less prone to it than other killers due to the movement speed of her blinks. And even still, you cannot effectively stealth against a good killer, Nurse included. 
---
This is complete misinformation and it NEEDS to stop being spread.
---
I understand your frustrations. Unfortunately camping is a strat used in all ranks. Not camping first hook all game mind you but using you as bait for a little bit to get another. It doesn't work often but can work really well against a dumb swf team.
---
I would love to see you do a clown or legion. I feel like Clown would be more interesting than Legion though.
---
Pig unmasked cosmetic when?/s
---
When I first started playing the game, literally all the tips were about how to counter certain killers.
---
As it turns out, those tips were always about the killer I was playing against.
---
Turns out, tips *are* pretty useful at telling you who you're up against.
---
Ur joking, right?
---
Was it really a nerf? How many perks are harder to use now because her dash doesn't count as a M1.
---
Then you should send an e-mail to the devs. I'm sure they'll reverse his ban based on your compelling and 100% correct arguments.
---
Actually it kind of does but it's a moot point since everyone is pretty aware that you just used the colloquial form of the word that is more akin to "actually" than "literally."
---
This has to be the most stubborn and ignorant thing i've read lmao "you shouldn't be able to swing through something within arms reach because I can't judge distance"
---
Had no idea about that game, I look forward to it
---
Agreed (:
---
Gee reminds you of something you did with ochido "I don't like this guy, lemme find dirt on him so I can get rid of him" and you called me a smalldicked troll even though I've been perfectly respectful towards you but ochido is the toxic one? Again seems like you don't really give a fuck if someone is toxic or ban evades, you're just very triggered.

Same. I'm waiting for the next test to play it. The day I had known about that game was the day a weekend test ended

Literally not a killer main, you don't salty
---
No pain no gain
---
There‚Äôs always hatch as last resort :)
---
While this would definitely make survive with friends stop generating you however for solo survivors they're going to get killed by randoms not giving a crap about them
---
Great guide. Just a real quick question, when should I be using the alarm clocks to wake up?
---
Nothing about it currently is challenging, it‚Äôs luck based. People run and try and find the hatch because finding the hatch is much more reliable than spending 80 seconds on a generator. You‚Äôre better off camping a door and opening that as soon as the hatch gets closed.
---
If any of the following happens you‚Äôre screwed
---
1) if more than 1 gen is left
---
2) if the killer knows where the hatch is
---
3) if you‚Äôre not almost done with a gen by the time the last guy dies
---
Like he's wearing nothing at all! Nothing at all!
---
I'm actually losing pips, went from r3 to r4, happened all day

less points in gatekeeper for you that way but ok.

*Fuckable Myers*
---
They could do a survivor paragraph with Sean of the Dead and Chris Washington amongst others, and include cosmetics that match for existing survivors. That way it reaches more people by including Sean himself as well as matching cosmetics for Dwight or Ace or someone
---
&gt; Dream Projection gives you a five second warning if he is coming to your generator through the blood effects, so use these five seconds to find a safe hiding spot to make it hard to find you. This is safer than running away because he can follow your scratch marks then or you might run into him if he was faking the teleport. With that said, run away if necessary.
---
This is imo the biggest aspect of the counter play that many people are missing right now. Admittedly I  play killer around ranks 8-12, I don't play killer nearly as much as survivor.. but I imagine the survivors complaining about Freddy aren't at better ranks than this anyway. And they just cannot seem to get a grip on how to react to Freddy starting to teleport to a gen. Unless they are within 5 seconds of finishing and they just chug through it, they seem to always immediately bolt away. Leaving a direct trail to them and often running into my LoS before I finish the teleport. 
---
I know all the best players essentially always say stealth and hiding are useless, but I love that a solid smart counter to Freddy teleporting to the gen you're on is a bit of stealth. Break Loss to the gen but stay close, and still carefully watch the other directions too because bluffing a teleport is so easy to do as Freddy and his power only slightly depletes from it so it refills fast. 
---
Freddy doing a bluff or two to try to flush survivors off of gens is really fun right now cause survivors start running around like headless chickens, but that really doesn't mean it's overpowered at all, it has an incredibly easy counterplay so long as survivors just keep calm about it
---
Calm Spirit should make the Spirit unable to attack or hook survivors.
---
I talk about getting hit when the fast vault animations is 99% done and you're basically already on the other side of the window. Maybe I'm mistaken but I feel like earlier there was a certain point throughout the animation where the killer would miss you even if the vault wasn't 100% completed yet.
---
The changes they've been making lately have been okay, devs don't care much about console, I agree, after all, I play on Xbox. But hey, at least we got Bill.
---
On :c
---
If she were to get a buff on this, there would be no point in playing against her.. as soon as she downed you and put it on your head, you‚Äôd be dead and that ruins the fun and shortens the game. She‚Äôs fine the way she is, at least survivors have a countering action they can do in order to live longer.
---
Man.
---
Fucking Meg
---
Tampered Timer is fucking trash. It reduces the timer by 30 seconds. 30 seconds is literally nothing, and while it can be the deciding factor for a kill the Survivor either has to be a complete potato or you have to hard "tunnel" them away from the Jigsaw boxes for a kill.
---
Ruleset No. 2 is alright and honestly unlike most people I don't think it should be baseline. I *do* however think the effect is way too weak for an Ultra Rare and it should instead be tied to a far cheaper and weaker addon like Face Mask. While it can buy you some time if the Survivor looks for their box before it activates the addon immediately becomes worthless if a generator pops. You *can* be a toxic shithead and use addons like Slow-Release Toxin in the end game to make Survivors permanently exhausted but if you can already get a trap on a Survivor in the post-game you may as well just hook them. The end problem is that the Survivor can just ignore the RBT until a gen pops and then go remove it; there's more than enough time to do so.
---
Ultimately RBTs are for game stall as opposed to kills and both these addons provides mediocre game stall. Tampered Timer exists purely for "kill" potential while Ruleset No. 2 is easily countered. You're far better off running Bag/Crate of Gears or Jigsaw's Sketch (Annotated Plan increases the RBT timer. Also yes name's are incorrect in-game) in order to actually stall the game *and* increase the time to take off the trap, which directly translates into a higher chance of killing with the trap.
---
"RePoRtEd"
---
The fun part about all of this is that you can link this right back to the original topic. Of course Tru3 is the way he is...people like this exist all over the internet. Imagine dealing with trolls and people looking to start shit coming into your stream on a daily basis when all you want to do is earn money and engage with your community while playing games that you love. Kinda defeats the whole purpose of streaming to get away from your average 9-5 in the first place doesn't it?
---
Oh well. I've dicked around enough in this thread.
---
You must not play killer very often
---
At my rank everyone hides in lockers so due to the massive amount of scratch marks around the locker I just assumed
---
Calm down dude
---
No. üòÇ

I really don‚Äôt get when this happens to me as a new, rank 19 killer. Like how are you low rank survivors so toxic already? Just rude.

With Premonition it can go off and make you walk away from a gen even if the killer isn't even headed your way.
---
Then you have more to learn as a survivor. I have slammed hatches and chased 1 survivor  everywhere on the map he worked hard and earned his escape.
---
You could have at least gotten better Images
---
It shows a depip but you don't actually depip
---
What‚Äôs wrong with the chosen images?
---
Unless it's closed
---
Sounds like the only option you have left is Ghost Face and the Piggy.
---
I disagree. Patrolling a hook is an ok strategy and a viable one most of the times. Camping/Facecamping the hook is just a noob way to get an easy kill or to get revenge either from a toxic survivor or a good one.
---
So if you stand near the hook is not ok for any survivor. If you are patrolling an area of approximately 30-40 meter range from hook then it is ok. It gives me the chance to unhook/get unhooked and the killer the chance to find that altruistic teammate without being toxic. Fair and Simple as that.
---
I‚Äôd love if some of my teammates follow this tip and not keep working on a gen til the killer is 5 meters away.
---
I do agree that Rule Set 2 should be less rare. I've gotten like, 5 at most in the entire time of been playing pig. I've recycled the level 50 blood web a bunch and am preparing to prestige. Part of the reason I want to prestige is so I can get more Rule Sets so I won't have to use black wards.
---
Anyway, Tampered Timer is responsible for most of my game overs, and these are fairly competent green or purple survivors that I didn't tunnel. 30 seconds is a long time in DbD.
---
In order to win a chase, you must win the chase.
---
Pls no
---
Nah I'm good. Remodel it and then we can talk
---
That‚Äôs nothing new but it‚Äôs amazing it hasn‚Äôt been fixed lol.
---
There is proven infinite‚Äôs in hadden field when using balanced landing.
---
How do I counter dream pallets? Should I just stop relying on pallets then? No way I‚Äôm able to remember which is real and which is fake
---
I guess i love you too
---
Pig is waifu
---
Thank you all
---
Nah not fair. If you want ruin you use a perk slot on it.
---
Is it his appearance or what
---
Killer's not as miserable as solo survivor. With killer you do as well as you personally can do, but with solo survivor you can only do as well as the 3 other idiots enable you to do.
---
I made my whole profile private after they started telling me how to play DBD in my Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review
---
While the lore is inconsistent, it could be that Evan was loyal to his father and was in fact his enforcer but when the order was given to trap the miners in the mine Evan executed the orders but as an unintended consequence was trapped in the mine as well. Evan thought his father would come and look for him as he maybe thought that the loyalty between him and his father was mutual. His father either because madness, or some other reason (or a mixture of multiple reasons) didn't care and after quite some time he was able to escape and blamed his father for not coming to his rescue. It was then that Evan confronted his father, damning his father to the same fate that his father had doomed Evan to. Evan likely then retreated into the forest, knowing his own death was not long after, not just from wounds of being trapped, but also because the town would soon come for him as he would be the only survivor. The entity took him not long after.
---
That's my best guess from beginning to end of what could have went down.
---
ok i understood, leave me alone...
---
this so much, the only time i will ever attempt a tunnel is when the gates are open, but what i normally do there is try to hit someone once before they get to the hook so if they unhook in front of me ill take the trade and hit the unhooker and keep the process going....tunneling feels cheap to me and i really enjoy chasing people.  The best feeling is when im running make your choice use it a few times and then in lobby i get asked why i never went after the unhooked surv...duh im using a perk that allows me to focus on the unhooker :).
---
The first 5 times you go against each killer you get a loading screen tip about them.
---
Had the same issue, thought it was my internet but that‚Äôs all good and I‚Äôm on a wired 100mb solid connection and any other online game works fine and I never get booted! But with DBD for the last few weeks it happens 2-4 times a day or more! Very frustrating and I keep depiping because of it, I wish BhVR would fix their game! PS4 btw
---
Its not the range it's literally just bugged.
---
Skill check is LB and closing hatch is RB.
---
What are your suggestions? Having his giggle juice hit players he can't see is super annoying. Having to reset every time to try to get same and miss the skill check bouncing all over the screen. If you get a skill check in the 5'clock part of the circle when you don't know where on your screen the circle going to be is next to impossible unless you've played so many hours nothing is hard to you.
---
PIG IS WAIFU
---
**KKCCCHHH-KrrrRRK! KRRRRAAAACCCKKKKKKK-KCH. KURRCH. KRAK.**
---
I‚Äôd never play solo again and just quit the game if this happened.
---
Sadly those were the last two survivors alive and they made it possible for the killer to have his 4K. Fucking hell I got so angry because of them.
---
You can go to r/dbdLFG and set up a post there asking for nice/chill people to play with. You can use a community tab on your platform to find people there. And lastly you can go on the DBD forums and put a post up there, warning though cause there is a bit of salt on there. Hope you can find some people to play with! 
---
P.s. is it too late to get a refund on those games you bought? Lol
---
What's so bad about really rare obscure achievements?
---
Like as it is now, it's legit an *achievement* to get it.
---
repost
---
I almost forgot about that post
---
is this a lesbian dbd comic
---
Finally, a meme for us red rank brothers.
---
Say what now?
---
IM A PRESTIGE 3 PIG SHE IS #MINE#
---
we need him :,(
---
Boy yy have passive phasing or some shit
---
I do the same. I play killer for BP and it‚Äôs easy to get enough without sacrificing all the survivors. I‚Äôd rather have the fulfilment of giving them the escape
---
Except now its basically impossible unless the killer gives you it intentionally.
---
Just give her the pig ears only as a head cosmetic. (im fully blaming what people consider a 'cat-girl' to make this justifiable)
---
is this a lesbian sex dbd comic
---
nice , im not that far into her ;) but one day
---
The survivor‚Äôs hitbox is a huge cigarette, basically, while hatchets are spheres (which in this case doesn‚Äôt even matter, that cigarette hitbox is about 1 head talker than the survivor anyway)
---
wtf is that abomination? no, its not scary, it looks like a toy
---
#EVERY TEACHABLE FROM EVERY KILLER ON HER. I AM UNSTOPPABLE#
---
 But I want to see the killer :( how else can I stare at his LOVELY face when I'm  not in a chase
---
I USE INSIDIOUS JUAT TO BE A PRICK IM SUCH A GOD
---
reminds me of Doctor
---
I know this might not be the right place to ask but I think this post is going to get attention so......does the dreamworld effect feel taxing on anyone's eyes? I mean physically taxing not aesthetically.  As a survivor main, I've never had this much exposure to the effect previously. Anyone's thoughts?
---
Pig is  better than most give her credit, IMO, and she is fun to use if you want to be stealthy and chase well. Her traps also help slow the game down quite a bit.
---
yes
---
This meme gets funnier when you realize that he was 1/2 of Ghost Face
---
Make it then, random person on the internet.
---
But don't some perks counteract each other
---
&gt; translating to 'press it for a moment' in Chinese. I thought I was onto something and getting instructions. 
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
The guy you‚Äôre arguing with made his account 4 hours ago, it‚Äôs just bait.
---
Maybe for the first 60 seconds of a match or something, otherwise all the detection perks would be majorly nerfed.
---
You're shit as him, no offense
---
He has insane map pressure, plus his ability can insta down
---
I would be offended at this but you actually kind of have a point. I‚Äôve never been let go by Amanda or farmed with her as a Survivor but I‚Äôve definitely done it with her as a badly ranked killer.  My killer is only 16, I don‚Äôt play Killer a lot and also I goof off a lot.
---
Yes. Yes it actually the fuck does. By definition of the term. 
---
"OVERpowered."
---
i don't mind, the important thing is fixing the game rather than events
---
He has Balanced Landing for sure.
---
Doesn't really invalidate my point though. Unless we're just talking about doing it to flex internet gaming boners to other people, then yea sure people used to get it easier so it diminishes how satisfying it is to show off.
---
none. sorry
---
I just want a cowgirl hat on Kate
---
Still think he‚Äôs shite but like the saying goes. 
---
Opinions are like assholes, everyone‚Äôs got one
---
this is a pretty good tier list
---
3 blinks has no counter since 3rd one is always a free hit unless the Nurse is shit in which case it doesn't matter anyways. Omegablink is somewhat counterable if you're able to lose LOS and get enough distance.
---
but... from what movie he is?
---
I literally just defended him by saying we all knew what he meant and it's cool but he was technically incorrect in hopes that he'll maybe take it upon himself to articulate even better next time. 
---
I hate you Reddit ass holes that don't understand context. So now we're even.
---
i think he should be a little slower with his teleport power than he is now, but that‚Äôs all
---
&gt;doing it flex Internet gaming boners
---
Why else would i want it?/s
---
Don‚Äôt forget the WAH. Honestly worth playing against a spirit just to hear that while your being carried
---
When nurse can use add ons to teleport to gens from outside her terror radius stealth also becomes unworkable.
---
To be fair, something had to change when endgame collapse came out or her endgame would be way stupidly OP. They just overdid it by a lot.
---
I don‚Äôt this would work because solo survivors will get fucked over.
---
I'll tell you what. A good pig can juggle well enough to get another survivor down while the other is still pulling their trap off. Pig might need a buff in some way bur definitely not this one. Btw, why is your title "Pig is Waifu" if you don't main her. Doesn't really make sense to me.
---
I need it!
---
Freddy isn't the strongest B-tier Killer, Myers belongs in B-Tier, Legion isnt stonger than Myers, and so much more is wromg with this list. Ok you need explantions so we understand you reasoning?
---
This is just my opinion. Lot of my friends have quitted this game bc how the devs remove every fun outplay mechanic. Didnt ask any explanation about those so called infinites. I know how they work and i never have trouble catching survivors around them.
---
The movie is called wishmaster and is a wes xraven film. So he designed scram as well. The killers actual name is djinn
---
Lmao I do watch pug and I get a bit annoyed when he does this. The sad part is a while back he started to do it after every match his teammates would piss him off so I have a feeling that was his way of ‚Äúgetting back at survivors‚Äù. He‚Äôs a blatant hypocrite but laughing at that is one of the more entertaining parts of the stream. lol
---
except that for a fact he has one of the strongest abilities, but it is a bit tricky to learn how to use it
---
Well to be fair, if your opinion is 'billy is bad' then your opinion is wrong
---
MYC, NOED come to mind. That's enough to call it a nerf.
---
I'm playing on PC.
---
Use his chainsaw to get around the map faster instead of just to kill, you‚Äôll have a much better time :)
---
Did you blood lust him ? Of your not a killer main, or don‚Äôt play killer enough your opinion on infinite‚Äôs is void.
---
meh... this killer is not verry popular, i doubt BHVR would buy their license
---
The traps should make the survivor stab another player to get it unlocked.
---
I actually lol'd at this comment
---
uhhh I don't understand. English?
---
He‚Äôs extremely easy to play as, recommended killer for beginners.
---
no the one that revealed some guy that he had no idea was there and resulted in free kills with no effort
---
Or.. they just didn't bother modeling and animating eyes that would never be seen
---
Most likely are to many killers out there so the survivor base ain't enough and they'll have to queue people of different ranks and regions togheter to shorten killers wait time.
---
Yeah i just wanted to know the communitys thought on this. Thanks
---
Account made 2 hours ago... lots of new accounts ‚Äònot attacking him‚Äô.  He‚Äôs a human after all and sometimes reacts to provocation from chat when he is sniped almost every killer game for 2 weeks by the same accounts. 
---
All these new Reddit accounts on this thread are very suspicious at the same time he is dealing with harassment daily on stream.
---
You were defending him for no reason he was just taking it too literally on purpose just because he could.
---
I didn't ask how you felt about my opinion. Also didn't ask how your friends are. Infinites are only fun for the survivors.
---
Should be the other way round let‚Äôs be real.
---
No. Made it to red ranks several times with playing around 1 game with killer per every 20 survivor games.
---
There‚Äôs a theory her eyes are like that on purpose and she uses echolocation to see (hence her lullaby)
---
"You have the undeniable capability to sense danger.
---
Get an auditory warning when looking in the direction of the Killer in a 45¬∞ cone within a range of 36 metres.
---
Premonition has a cool-down of 60/45/30 seconds each time it activates."   
---
Homie you got it mixed up with another perk
---
Oh he got dem plump juicy lips wraith is ready for some macking
---
Id say I at her a lot but I wouldn't say I have enough play time as her to say I main her
---
Nah i usually play trappy alot past 13 and can get about 5 survivors caught on average. You just have to place them in tall grass and a few windows, not out in the open, and that's with out the add ons. Survivors who are actually careful and vigilant should be able to disarm traps, since it takes alot of patience to not get things done quickly, just because a survivor countered properly doesn't mean that traps are usless. Plus he's pretty good excluding the traps, with a good lunge and good speed. Trappy is in the perfectly balanced spot, as all things should be.
---
Oh hey, it's a repost of a repost of a repost.
---
np... sorry for my first comment, it sounded kinda rude
---
Let me put it this way. The killer has to do whatever he can to get a 4k. If your team sees you hooked and I'm just standing there like a dumbass face camping you. They should be blowing through gens. A smart killer should realize nobody is coming to save you and should go for the gens. A bad killer will camp you like a dumbass letting a good survivor team unhook you with perks to protect you and body block for you to get you to the exit. It's worked countless times. Sure it won't always work Everytime but your teammates at least get to survive and the killer gets a depip. That's a win in my book.
---
I upvoted just because you're not screaming Nerf. Also the info is good so, bonus
---
Her ambush attack doesn't count as an m1 attack anymore, which, as far as I know, means that stbfl, noed, etc won't activate if you use ambush
---
Huzzah! A man of culture I see!
---
I feel bad for all you guys really..I get it on the first try so much that when she puts the trap on me I'm like "YAY I GOT A COOL HAT THANKS" and I go take it off when it beeps. I feel awful that I'm apparently the only one to experience this
---
welllll that booty don‚Äôt feel computer generated if you know what I‚Äôm saying
---
After watching all the movies he definitely can teleport. There's just no way for him to constantly be in different places as fast as he does.
---
Survivor: Tried using Deliverance to get off the hook to get to the exit. As soon as I got to the gate, something bugged out because I stopped stopped moving for a split second and slowly go back to sprint speed, getting me stabbed, hooked, and facecamped. While that was frustrating, I posted it on this subreddit. Dude said "Should have used DS" in which I responded "I don't like using it. Feels like a free escape that I didn't earn." Proceeded to get downvoted to hell by salty survivors for disrespecting DS.
---
Killer: Accused of hacking for one hit downing people. I was playing as Myers
---
Everyone: You can't hear writing
---
Me: Exhibit A
---
he was running so that his exhaustion could stay at 1% so that he could get that clutch sprint burst. smh toxic players /s
---
I literally told all of my friends it was 0% on your first try, I‚Äôve only been playing about a month or two now and I‚Äôve been watching streamers and somehow it‚Äôs never come up that someone removes a trap first try. Something fishy is going on with the RNG, I think.
---
Huntress is Russian I would have to guess and she is HOT
---
How ? What part do you find hard ? He has an insta down other killers would die for that
---
She‚Äôs both
---
We need at least one perk titled "WE HANDLE SHIT".
---
SWF &gt; killer &gt; solo
---
Solo survivor is way harder than killer because of the things OP mentioned. killer you're crossing your fingers that luck is on your side and the survivors aren't good. As solo survivor you're crossing your fingers that not only are you better than the killer, but also that your teammates arent trash
---
Wait I can‚Äôt view that
---
man why you gotta do jane like that
---
It's more likely he thought the shady stuff was like a backroom kinda thing and the actual car wrecker part where Wraith worked at was legit and therefore he didn't care since he thought wasn't apart of the illegal stuff.
---
Ooohhh
---
or they lunge really early and you run out of the locker and get hit.
---
when it makes sense situationally, i imagine. you'll always have to run across the map for a clock so if your time is better spent doing a gen or wasting the killer's time in chase then better to do that than waste time waking up, i think?
---
imo they could've slowed down the timer for every person with a trap on their head. That would've been better than just letting survivors walk out with a trap
---
Yeah i mean they can do my suggestion of escaping through a door after the hatch is closed by the killer, 
---
Or maybe escape through the hatch after everyone else has escaped
---
Maybe even escape through the hatch after it has been shut.
---
probably not
---
Quality shit post
---
Yes you do, I can confirm this as an Xbox player,
---
You do you my man
---
I've been seeing double pallet loops on coldwind a lot recently on ps4. Both as the killer and a survivor. It's atrocious that they still spawn 2 on the same gym loop by the shed. 2 pallets and a window. It's busted as fuck. I would love to post screenshots and/or video of it but I'm currently out of state and my ps4 isn't with me.
---
When I see a nice killer, I tap a gen for them to kick again (that way we both get what we want) entity can go suck a Nea
---
Just gave me a thought.  Luck should affect boxes and traps. It would give aces perks a meaning.
---
STBFL, noed, make your choice don't work with ambush anymore. Maybe there are others, but those are the ones I know of
---
Yeah I was saying skill checks arent skill full and we have too much of that in the base game. Usually trapped survivors are injured for a bit longer since a lot of pigs run make your choice and no one stays near the hooks. So the injured survivor defaults to finding boxes which are loud to fiddle with. Also it's a short chase for the lig if they didn't see or hear you approach brcause your crouched and have no terror radius. These boxes are usually on the way to objectives anyway so it doesnt hurt to check them for the injured survivor. It has a higher success rate than you think it does, seen it work in red ranks too.
---
This area in pokemon is called Pallet town
---
They for some reason had the rights to the ghost face character but not any of the movie characters that‚Äôs why the killer in game is made up.
---
Against a plague your needles are trash
---
I know, I just needed to rant.
---
i love how megs watch the killer set down traps near me when im hooked and they run into it.
---
Dude that's so frustrating I can't imagine having to hear some clicking noises :(
---
Can awake survivors wake up sleeping survivors still?
---
boi
---
repost thot
---
*made with mematic*
---
I am not sure mate as I never use that perk with the spirit...
---
What perks do you use if you don't mind me asking?
---
There was another post here a few days ago that it was their first time playing him and their first perfect game
---
Depends how long you've been away. Survivors can walk out the gates with a trap on their head if you put it on after the last gen has been done. Traps in general only activate after a gen is done. The most recent one is that her ambush attack doesn't count as an m1 attack anymore so perks like noed, for example, won't work if you ambush
---
you need to fall off in the border of the map, you will spawn inside the map again, try to find the hatch, is the only way to escape when that happens
---
MHM
---
I click everything. The killer, my team mates, the tree, that rock over there, the sky. Idgaf. Click click click click click.
---
considering the spies notification is similar to a failed skillcheck, Id say yes.  SftS isn't really good to use ever though tbh
---
Nah, they quit because they raging.
---
Most recently her ambush doesn't count as an m1 attack anymore
---
It should
---
Lol hilarious. Now uninstall the game after every update and reinstall so your files get reorganized so you can play. Those pc laughs come with a price consoles never have to deal with.
---
They just slow the game down to which is boring for the killer too :/
---
The loading screen can actually be invaluable
---
If the loading screen says "FACING (killer here), and provides a tip for said killer, that means you are fighting said killer,
---
For example: FACING THE HILLBILLY or FACING THE SHAPE.
---
Me trying to help a new Pig player
---
I think it should, considering it's not an aura reading perk. It makes a noise notification when someone walks past and alerts the crows.
---
Only perks that show survivors auras (like Nurse's Calling) don't work with phasing.
---
people that don't get this haven't experienced this hellish situation

Check the ground for pieces of remaining already broken pallets before throwing them and scout the map before hand
---
stop giving me anxiety attacks &gt;:(

It would give luck itself a meaning as a game mechanic. Currently the only way luck is useful is if you're against the trapper or like to attempt hook escapes like an idiot

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cim8ho/do_survivors_hear_the_spirit_whoosh_when_they_are/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

It‚Äôs the ultimate middle finger to toxic SWF groups (hook one down the rest)

If Im a rank 10 survivor doing 8.5/10 ruin skill checks, I feel like rank 1s should be at least that good, if not better.  
---
  
---
Good tip though.  I would also like to add this works with NOED ;D
---
But did you or did you not just say reasoning is not the important matter of what's intended and known is understood? And you just said yourself I was defending him. 
---
What a total hypocrite you are.
---
it's the balance, survirvors were constantly nerfed in the last year so less ppl playing that side than needed.
---
lol i saw this posted this morning
---
Indeed. It made things a lot easier.
---
Not because the tips were good, though. "Run Away From The Trapper When They Run At You," no shit.
---
No killer belongings are only traps and hooks there is another add on for totems, and if you want to find totems you can use small game
---
Unless they get rights to use shawnee smiths face id rather not have a unmasked pig.
---
Are my "attacks" wrong? Or are they justified ? I clearly stated I like him and watch him. It's one thing to make a mistake, but to be nonchalant about them are completely different. My points are very valid. The thing with True3 is that you  have to be cautious about things more so than others - especially when you have a massive following. This is my very first reddit account, I usually don't get into these things. But after watching his stream today and he actually looked at this thread, I figured I'd try to reach out to him.
---
I‚Äôm too busy being the Casey (I‚Äôm running away why telling him to please leave me alone)
---
Hehe good one.
---
Sad PS4 here, i will go cry in my corner... :(
---
or you have a shitty sense of humour
---
They literally said that they aren‚Äôt doing a summer event so they can work on the game‚Äôs health and such. Including dedicated servers
---
wish it was like that on mobile. its so hard to use flashlights there.
---
And just like that, he deleted the game and switched to solo Minecraft
---
No sir it's the "red twine" addon and it's way better at finding totems than small game is. Didn't know about traps though so thanks.
---
So after that they stop apearing? I was wondering why it never told me what killer I was up against and how to counter anymore.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
why did this get downvoted so hard it‚Äôs a joke lmao
---
Apparently healing and repairing makes your hitbox as tall as the Eiffel Tower. I've had the unfortune to be in the receiving side too.
---
So fucking Sexy
---
hope you get banned for that
---
Yes, teammates are bad
---
Can‚Äôt wait for dedicated servers to deal with people like you
---
You honestly sound like someone that pretty much exclusively plays SWF and simply wants to pretend you don't have a huge competitive advantage playing in stacks.  Most agree with him on his views on swf.  Acknowledging the benefit doesn't automatically make you a killer main lol.  It just makes you capable of objectivity.
---
Well they are trying their best to focus on the games health and make it better in general. I‚Äôd rather that than rank rewards tbh.
---
When you have sonic speed (that the game gave you), who wouldn‚Äôt use it to mess with the killer
---
What massive outcry? Lol
---
I wish I could respect the killer, and use nice fun builds instead of the meta and just the meta, but everytime I do this the killer bullies the shit out of me and I usually get farmed or tunnelled, and a lot less common but even camped.
---
Out
---
You‚Äôre just garbage if you are complaining that Freddy is OP plain and simple. He is fun to play as and play against in his current state. This is coming from a toxic survivor main lmao
---
I thought the mending timer doesn't go down while in a chase
---
Freddy vs the cooler Freddy
---
That‚Äôs fucked up (they literally set you up to fail)
---
How/when did they DC?
---
doesnt he have pretty much wallhacks once he smacks someone in frenzy?
---
I dont get it
---
Petition to change Huntress's mori to her crushing the survivors skull like a watermelon between her thighs

that's ok the bbq stack isnt that important to me
---
You call it a teabag but you admitted it yourself that you enjoy being an ass
---
I mean they breaking you out of stalk is a giant clue they are nearby
---
I never go into any match without spine chill lol
---
He went out of his way to do it too. Easily could have been on a gen during my chase...
---
I actually died by running into a wall at sonic speed and he caught up :(
---
Thanks for ruining the experience for four other players. Pathetic.
---
Learned that the hard way lol turned and he was staring right at my teammate that was on the same gen. Poor guy was tunnel vision on the gen and was just grabbed and tossed on a hook lol
---
Not really, I just suicide in hook.
---
I don't blame you, It's boring.
---
Nope, I‚Äôll just die on hook instead.
---
Well‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre all not used to being speed demons (at least you had fun while it lasted)
---
still should be reportable imo
---
Nurse players ruin my experience, I‚Äôm not going to force myself to play her.
---
At that point, I'd find the level of pettiness these guys are at to be "willing to shoot their own foor to bloodstain my dry cleaning". Also, I'd be laughing all the way to the bank.
---
that's always read to me like his boss was running a drug ring or something and he turned a blind eye to it until he figured out that there was murder happening as well.
---
You seem fun at parties
---
I don't have many perks with her. Im using Spirit Fury, Ensuring, Ruin, and Pop Goes the Weasel
---
Relatively new survivor here, who would you say is top 3 (3 to 1) most powerful killers?
---
Yes, his power is annoying to new players. That's it. It barely/dont help him in a chase at all. You dont need to have thousands of hours to hit the skillchecks either. When it comes to killers, the strongest ones are those effective in chase. Spirit, Nurse and Hillbilly are the top 3 because of their ability to end chases quickly and find new survivors. No offense but I think its too early to call out for nerfs when you cant even hit doctor skillchecks.
---
Right? Bloodwarden pig would be so fun then lmao
---
they dont Force you, but they can ban you for leaving.
---
No one forces you to play
---
Powers could include something like...
---
Do you wish to escape this chase? Do you wish to hook escape? Do you wish it were someone else down and not you? After 3 wishes shared between survivors maybe he can one hit survivors the rest of the match.
---
I was meaning to write this as well. Freddy has a healthy amount of counters and is no worse than Hag. He has a limited number of traps and doesn't even have a power if Survivors are awake. I do think dream pallets could use a *slight* nerf (the main problem is that he has way too many of them imo) but if Freddy has dream pallets you can just loop with windows instead.

Did you watch the last dev stream? 3 or 4 of the questions in the Q&amp;A were asking when they were going to nerf him because he is op lol.

One person asking a question even suggested freddys speed being nerfed to 110% since he csn teleport and slow you.

??? wym we don‚Äôt have to deal with this either
---
He does. The community just don't see it cause they just want shirtless myers.

Now that he‚Äôs on the console, you need to unlock his teachables in order for them to appear on others webs again (as long as you don‚Äôt prestige characters you already have his perks on, they are still useable on that character)

The games ‚Äúhealth‚Äù is big fixes and FPS increase across the board. That includes latency and hit boxes.

XBOX ONE (POSSIBLY ALL PLATFORMS)

Bug with Rancor
---
When a killer is using rancor the survivors who are not the obsession receive the killers effects. (All survivors locations are revealed to you after the completion of a gen). I noticed I could see where the other survivors were after a gen was completed while playing survivor.
---
Might still be unfixed then :P
---
Yeah that would be a good feature, just didn't read right because I thought you meant buy perks like BBQ or make your choice. Perks that require actual money basically.
---
Waluigi spirit skin?
---
I ALWAYS go after the guy sandbagging his teammates. I don't camp or tunnel, but I make sure to stay within view of them and tunnel the shit out of them. It's happened several times.
---
I'm with you but I think you should at least wait to see if it's a good nurse or not.
---
Baby nurses are fun to bully :) Gotta discourage them when they're still young
---
I never agree to D/C but the moment u saw the haddonfield offering you just shut that shit off because that's not gonna be fun
---
I play on console, but it usually around rank 8-12. I haven‚Äôt been lower in a while, so I don‚Äôt know if it happens in ranks under that. It‚Äôs understandable to hit someone you see, but that‚Äôs not what the pig killers I face do. I could see them hit another survivor, then I‚Äôll get taken off the hook. They‚Äôll leave that survivor and start checking machines closest to the hook because they know you have to get it off.
---
And I have terrible luck so most times, the third or fourth machine is the one that takes the trap off. It just sucks when you can see the killer isn‚Äôt even chasing everyone else. They‚Äôre just stalking the machines because they know you need them in order to take the trap off. If I don‚Äôt go to the machines and just continue the obj, I‚Äôll die. But if I play the game, the killer is just checking all the machines and I‚Äôll get ripped off of it.
---
I guess some people don't think about that aspect.
---
Here is one example. I can find more to prove my point.

I've been playing for 3000 hours so i know all totem spawns, but no the killer belongings are hag traps, trapper traps, and fake pallets while in the dream world

I‚Äôm not sure I think that was Benedict maybe?

Personally I‚Äôd like to believe Vigo used the first iteration of the Hatch to escape the Entity‚Äôs realm and the Entity just uses a modified version for its games, since it does give the survivors that shred of hope the Entity finds so delicious.

Not all monsters.

I‚Äôm more then happy to play against every other killer, make a nurse toggle and I‚Äôll be happier üëçüèª
---
Oh, do it's just my lack of knowledge
---
I agree but that doesn't make her better I still think she's skummy for doing it but in rare occasions I'll do it to just because the survivors are bad and won't leave so I just chase them around the hook, sometimes if you just wait the killer will leave, some survivors don't get that and rush you right after putting someone on hook so it's hard to leave hook because you obviously see them, I'll play stupid but not that stupid.
---
Meh, nurf her and I‚Äôll stay.
---
You can create a card game with all of these
---
There are still infitites in the game, on McMillan, Farm and Autohaven when certain pallets are dropped you can chase around them for infinite amount of time ;)
---
not needed, there will be a "u" toggle, called timed ban
---
When the map is created, each jigsaw station spawns with your own personal key for each trap. So it's been just weird luck I guess.

nah, feel free to stay away

I am on PC so theres hope i guess

I'm expecting a lot of negativity but I think its wicked fucking cool. Epic games has already proven how flexible Unreal Engine is with Fortnite Mobile ( put your unnecessary hate for the franchise aside for a sec ).

I mean it's hard to miss the severed limbs and glass embedded into blue skin, I think people just choose to ignore it.
---
Jesus The Christ what a horrid thought, thank you for calling for clarity on that
---
Yes. You can stop some loops, not every. Also stopping some of the some loops may actually take longer than just going through a pallet. His chases are incredibly long, if you'r using his power and if you don't, his a killer without power.
---
If there weren't a shortage of killers it wouldn't take 10+ minutes to find a lobby, not counting lobby dodges
---
They did also say that the chainsaw Killers (along with Pig and Myers) would also have their addons looked into. I do agree with the devs that Nurse and Doctor should be a priority however. Doctor is incredibly addon reliant, and Nurse is the exact opposite in the sense that all her addons are completely useless say for a few exceptions. (Matchbox, Fragile Wheeze, Plaid Flannel)
---
Then yes they can get banned for this 100%.
---
Wrong continuity
---
The Creature
---
Ash main big dick
---
Those Insta heals musta worked well XD
---
What if thr RBT also gave a survivor the broken status, so they can't heal instead?
---
Nurse is top one for sure, Billy and Spirit are 2 or 3 (order is debatable) but all 3 take enough mechanical skill and/or map knowledge that you'll probably not see many good ones that much if you're new.
---
This isn't much of an excuse but if the other two hadn't remained in the area I would have went to do gens.
---
Plus....ruin haha yeah that's definitely not an excuse lol
---
Other killers however are a lot simpler to understand what they do though. Nurse is stronger but it's much easier for new players to understand everything she can do
---
Where did they say this ?
---
She's harder to play against when your soloing. You can't trust randos to do gens against a Nurse and they'll usually get downed 10 seconds into  a chase or just give up against a Nurse.
---
Taco taco, burrito burrito
---
I believe they stated it's going to be free to download but I could be wrong.
---
I bullied a baby Nurse once. It was pretty funny how much she missed her attacks.
---
Considering I like to play Huntress, hard pass for me
---
I'm not as merciful as to completely ignore the hooked guy, but the farming asshole is definitely a priority when i play killer. I will down the guy who got hooked and then chase around the farmer. Most of the time, the downed guy stands a decent chance of getting saved by another teammate while i'm busy chasing the farmer around anyways.
---
Thanks! Didn‚Äôt think of that
---
I slug the sandbagged guy and then I go for the sandbagger
---
I thought you were playing killer and I read that 5 times until I realised you were playing survivor.
---
I‚Äôm dumb :D
---
But there‚Äôs not much you can do. Just report them and move on

enjoy your depip i guess

I used to be to scared to play survivor I tried it todat after 24hrs and it wasnt that scaey actually

So did you just post this to farm downvotes?
---
Yeah those people weren't right. You doing that causes the strife between killers and survivors. People like you then get 3 people killed due to the clear disadvantage. Just play a different game, you honestly can't think being this selfish is ok?
---
Tunneling is when you go after the same person you just hooked, when they were just removed from the hook and injured. Too many salty players
---
Ah deer is. 
---
That‚Äôs how I pronounce it
---
Yes they do
---
The father after he killed her....
---
Do huntess next ._.
---
i got this achievement legit 
---
don't complain
---
10+ min wait as survivor? I play NA and always find a game in under like 2 minutes. Killer on the other hand takes long as hell but that's also affected by your rank.
---
maybe they should implement an avoid feature like ik overwatch, so People could avoid you
---
Supposedly it‚Äôs when you go straight after the guy who just got unhooked. Some consider it toxic other consider it a smart play style
---
There are still safe windows that survivors can easily vault 3 times whilst wasting a lot of the killer's time. Disturbed ward main building, Wretched shop main building, Torment creek main building, Ironworks of misery main building, Suffocation pit main building, ... there's a pattern. They aren't infinites, but survivors can use them in a way that's way too efficient with current gen-times. 
---
Windows aren't the problem, it's the ones that aren't mindgameable.
---
Toxicity an overblown meme, both on killer/survivor side. I wish that word would just get you autobanned.
---
Tunneling is when you focus one person specifically until they're dead, usually by waiting around for them to be unhooked and going after them instead of the person who unhooked them and not letting them heal.
---
Funny thing is, several times I went for the closer rescuer because they were the one who kept taking everyone else down. I figured it would slow the unhooks down if I got them, and it did. Salty people be salty XD
---
Thank you
---
Looking at this data and thinking about it a bit, I actually wonder if changing this to how we *expect* the boxes to work (where each key is assigned its own static box) would be taken positively. As it stands, you have a 50% chance of getting the right key on the 1st try, and a 75% chance to get it by your second try. If this was changed, we'd have only a 43.75% chance of getting that trap off our heads within two boxes. I imagine that would be when survivor mains actually started calling for Pig nerfs for real.
---
Most annoying video of a mori to ever watch.
---
Don't worry, tunneling isn't bannable
---
In fact, in not sure anyone is ever banned in this game but that's besides the point. Tunneling is a legit strategy, albeit not much fun if you're on the receiving end of it as a survivor
---
Anytime
---
Oh man I love this new meme format lol
---
Did she get nerfed again?
---
Devs thought it would be pointless configuring that much code for somewhat insignificant console ü§£

Werent these posts banned?

Don't come for someone if you can't handle it back, especially when you're wrong.

Not my fault your comprehension is limited and you couldn't understand what I said. Read it again but slower. Or don't. I don't really care.
---
Is this supposed to be an original post
---
moris and NOED are pretty lame
---
haunted grounds and devour hope are fair game though
---
Who does this benefit besides Nurse mains?
---
Has she been nerfed a lot? What has been the most recent?
---
Grand savior Quick and Quiet. Also probably an inattentive killer because most of the time if the scratches stop they check the nearest locker.
---
As said before, spine chill is less specific than prem. You don't know where the killer is when spine chill goes off, you only know that they're looking at you within a certain distance. You know the direction and distance of the killer when prem goes off. And I've never had a false positive using prem so idk about that
---
i really hope they look into his addons soon cause like most of them are either copied and pasted useless or both
---
Exactly. This is what a good killer should do. You‚Äôre not chasing anybody and you see the guy just got unhooked? go for the rescuer. That way nobody is salty, and it‚Äôs better for you. Instead of you downing the guy from the hook again and everybody working on gens, you‚Äôre chasing the rescuer and the guy who got hooked is wasting time healing instead of doing a gen.
---
They said him and Billy would get some love too.
---
He didn't
---
Until then stay insidious in the basement.
---
This. Just like camping... while it‚Äôs a ‚Äústrategy‚Äù that is very annoying and usually the sign of a bad/salty killer, BHVR confirmed it‚Äôs not bannable
---
All killers, 360's are a pain on full sensitivity, I've had hundreds of people 360 me because I couldn't turn to catch up to them, lunging is mich harder because of this, also flicking to mindgame your red glow, making it a bit easier.
---
I agree that it‚Äôs selfish, but at the end of the day I‚Äôm playing for enjoyment for myself with the product I spent money on, I‚Äôm not going to waste 10 minutes of my free time playing against a killer that isn‚Äôt fun.
---
Ooooooh I've lived this situation, in the chinese house map. Awful
---
Hes defetinly not worse then something like Wraith
---
Then balance her, everyone and their mother knows she‚Äôs broken, yet the refuse to nerf her, but they are happy to nerf pig.
---
What if I'm in a SWF and I sandbag my teammate
---
User name checks out
---
yeap which is why a lot of people have their Hope's high for dedicated servers
---
10+ as a survivor on the NA server at around rank 10, my internet ain't shite and ots almost always a 10+ minute wait
---
It was not buffed actually in fact the stun time is nerfed for the killer the stun lasts longer
---
Yes, awake survivors can still wake sleeping survivors, but every time a survivor is woken up in this way, the next time will take longer. I think the max amount of time is like 16 seconds? 
---
Failing a skill check can still be worth it to avoid falling prey to traps and to hinder the cooldown of Freddy‚Äôs teleport, but waking up in general isn‚Äôt nearly as urgent as it was with old Freddy.
---
Her eyes kind of look like they have cataracts or something on them. They look like of "washed out" to me, color-wise.
---
There's tons of strats, perks, etc. that I think are cheap too. Doesn't give me the right to fuck other people over though. You're not the only person playing man. Remember that
---
I had a moment when a survivor looped me and obnoxiously teabagged only to join the next match with them as a survivor. I came across what was clearly Hex: Haunted Grounds and cleansed the fuck out of it with pleasure and got them hooked. Luckily the my other teammates did not receive the collateral damage.
---
Why does she look like Joe Swanson after a nose job?
---
Yeah, posted on BHVRs official instagram account. I guess I shouldn't have cropped the image so much, it looks like a fake post haha.
---
Hopefully your last as well.
---
Okay, see... that is legit hilarious. I should make a comic of it.
---
I find killer to be harder if you're in purple or red ranks. I have to derank just to do my complete 2 sacrifices daily as some killers. Most of the killer dailies you get on ones you don't play and you might not even complete the daily until the 5th games for some. Hell, in higher ranks if you aren't really good, you can only play Spirit, Billy, Nurse, and if you know how to aim then Huntress, and maybe Freddy. Any other killer can get looped easily if you're not extremely good at killer.
---
In green and lower I think solo survivor is harder because your teammates might be complete garbage and any killer can be played no problem in those ranks. The killer could've not played a bit because of rank reset so they can also be way better than the survivors.
---
It's to make him feel extra safe. :)
---
I fully support this.
---
Chris Washington and Frankenstein sound dope but adding Shaun feels redundant cause there‚Äôs already a lot of him in Dwight‚Äôs character&amp;design
---
That's just bad luck, the way it works is that there is a key created and placed in a box for every trap at the start of the game, you don't have a "chance" to find the key once you've searched the box, per say. Its either there or it isn't
---
What nerf will/did she recieve?
---
She is the hardest killer to learn and in reality is pretty balanced. Soon it will be Spirit too strong nerf her, billy too strong nerf, and so on and so on. I dont get where people have these issue. Im rank 3 and rarely run into these unstoppable nurses I run into maybe 2 or so every blue moon.
---
Is there something you want to tell us
---
He's just new.
---
Yes, we know
---
I was legit about to make a crying post about this, you're doing god's work.
---
I'll keep you posted. :)
---
Everyone was asking for more Pig buffs and BHVR was like buffing a killer? Nah let‚Äôs nerf her because of EGC even though EGC doesn‚Äôt even help killers that much
---
thats a weird comment because cock is always delicious 
---
thats like saying "how does pizza taste?" as an insult
---
it tastes yummy
---
Nurse players need to realise they are facing real people not AI,
---
As some killers it‚Äôs pretty necessary at high ranks. Some(billy, spirit, nurse) it‚Äôs not. you could always get lucky and get a good spawn
---
Freddy's potentially A tier to me.
---
Op just saw white beard probably
---
*Murderer
---
Dude im a rank 12 killer and i got a couple rank 4 survivors the rest are purple rank
---
So besides the toxicity, why would you expect the high rank players to not use top tier builds and to not be trying? Like what‚Äôs the point of playing a game with some degree of competition and not try?
---
I don‚Äôt by that excuse, because she‚Äôs hard to play as it‚Äôs ok for her to be broken ?
---
Care to go against my SWF and prove that?
---
I'm sure they'll get a kick out you getting tunnelled to high hell for being a dick to them.
---
No I knew about dbd mobile, I meant controllers specifically for mobile?
---
Wait wut? Ur swf would probs fuck my shit in
---
Yeah, almost like this is the mobile port
---
That‚Äôs my issue, she just dominates my team mates I‚Äôm seconds.
---
Lol he was more worried about his dance being interrupted than the kid he fucked up.
---
She isnt broken. I do see her a very strong but not broken. People like you ruin our community because you act like doing this is fine and then people just start a whole DC epidemic again then evryone is mad at each other.
---
U fucking liar.... u lied to the whole community
---
Always love your videos. They're so informative and in depth. Thank you for your work. Random question, what do you plan on doing once you're done with the current roster? Maybe analyzing survivor builds?
---
And do you plan on doing the freddy rework now or wait until it's settled with buffs or nerfs for a while?
---
Nothing is a faster death to a clean run than people refusing to just let someone die on hook. I can't count how many games have turned from 4 gens done with zero hooks to all four people being dead before that last gen is finished just because they keep running at the hooked person. As a killer main, I just have to wonder what's going through their heads at times.
---
bless you op
---
There were the original nerfs that were necessary, if a bit much, after Endgame Collapse was added.
---
Then, they decided to stop counting her ambush attack as a "basic attack", limiting her perk selection.
---
&gt; They do not make an explosion notification when dropped like real pallets (or at least they don't a lot, this might be a bug). 
---
They do, and should. Survivors are still slamming the pallet down, it just isn't real. Also, don't forget about the pallet add-on(s) that allow Freddy to see your aura for up to six seconds after you interact with a dream pallet. Slamming down every pallet you find is definitely not a good idea against him.
---
Thank you :)
---
The snare slowdown is 3 seconds jsut thought id point that out
---
The Vanilla experiment, I would assume. Everyone plays solo, without perks or items, for a given number of matches.

oh well that too could be the case I seen some other post around reddit about it

Enjoy the rest of your day good sir, instead of banning people maybe they should just balance the game.

this happens every single time a killer gets changed or a new one comes out

How I die in most of my games against Billy. Shooketh

Even worse when you keep getting matched with the same killer(player). I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs fun for either side to keep getting the same people.

Thank you for the idea. :) I appreciate it, it gives me an idea of what to say. But you‚Äôre right - so few killers I feel like lately and finding a match with decent ping seems to depend on the time of day or day of the week.
---
Wait until a sale hits, grab the game and, if you want to play killer, one of the killers from a movie you like, and then just mess around. Don't worry about winning or losing at first, and just take your time learning.

I know he extends his arms in Part 1 and in one episode of the tv show, but I'm not sure about his claws specifically.

Note: if you think my theory is wrong, I want you to take the time to create a counter post, so we can actually get some organized facts and start debating. It‚Äôs hard to do this in the comments section. Also, I‚Äôm genuinely curious to see what you guys come up with! :)
---
your video is anecdotal, the claud is just that kinda player. the top reasons survivors give up are lag or their team is doo doo. to get a better idea i guess you could record every single game and post it. thats the only way to prove that all or most survivors are doing this.

And nice no0b3 perks üëèüëè

&gt; and the nurse absolutely dominates even top skilled players
---
I disagree. I think the game, while it gets very sweaty at that point, is quite balanced, not because of the right reasons though. You need to be able to pressure the map and end chases fast vs gen times and Nurse is the only killer that can consistently do this vs the best survivors.
---
I guess we're on the different sides of the spectrum, i like facing Nurses, it is a completely different game but it isn't the same old looping with added flavour depending on the killer's power (my favourite killers to vs are Nurse, Billy and Huntress) so i'll agree to disagree :)
---
Just had another double pallet at Macmillan estate on PS4 and it was against a trapper...
---
I mean both of them are older than Bubba
---
Everyone is playing killer right now because of the Freddy rework so killer queues are going to be very long and survivor queues very short
---
Enjoy!
---
It took me a few weeks to come up with a logical theory, and a few days to find all the facts, write this up, and get it proof-read by an astronomer. :) I‚Äôm glad you like it!

I would main the fuck out of MacReady

I forgot all about Ghostface's existence. Sad to see Plague didn't rate high on your list. The character looks so cool.

Yea, one 'monster' will break the pattern and give hope that anything is possible and more likely after it.
---
Spirit.
---
Hunter?
---
Most add-ons stack, unless stated otherwise.
---
I believe the gen penalty would stack on this, but not the time since it's a set length. The shorter time just runs out while the longer one is still going, as silly as that sounds.
---
I'm an Xbox player but I do feel for you guys, hoping they get him to you soon. I don't understand why they wouldn't hold him to release on both consoles at the same time out of fairness considering he is basically just a skin

its a visual bug
---
How frustrating is it! Even on a good day it can take a while tonget a full lobby. I wad playing killer other night and survivors were DCing during load-in - I thought survivors/SWF players were complaining killers DC :/
---
Definitely don't buy auric cells. They're a worse value in every way than just buying the DLC. There's usually a big sale on this game every other month, so you'll probably see another sale in a few weeks.
---
Doctor addons are pretty good overall, only ones that are terrible are the tape that turns your shock therapy into a circle and the horse. The
---
 Doctor himself is low tier but he has potential, with some changes he can be really good.
---
The problem isn‚Äôt that you individually used them, it‚Äôs that it seems like every other match (especially in red and purple ranks) they get used. Whether it‚Äôs a survivor using a syringe or prayer beads spirit, these addons are way more common than the term ‚Äúvery rare‚Äù would lead you to believe. 
---
I can understand people getting fed up, but it‚Äôs not your responsibility to balance the game by holding back.

Don't worry, dedicated servers WILL come in the end of the summer.
---
i dont see why not. i feel like my frames would go to shite more often tho lol
---
Just checked, I definitely lost those pips
---
Well, it is true, altough the difference is that it affects killers, i put it kinda as a protection/downside of it. since as long as that is on use killer won't be able to use BBQ and chilli's auras, I'm all ears, black incense and all that will be render useless.

You just need to use it better. It‚Äôs pointless to come onto the subreddit to complain/ask for buffs about something that was your fault. Balanced Landing did what it said you just didn‚Äôt use it soon enough. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
it's a surprising ending they didnt expect but regardless people will always react that way when its unexpected and unfortunate at the same time
---
Stbfl has more use now that you can keep all your stacks by ambushing the obsession. The cool down only effected the normal m1 so running it only made sense if you weren't gonna use the ambush attack. Noed makes sense but do you really need to be crouched when noed is active? You're giving up the increased speed too.  And idk if noed is worth running on the pig now that her traps were rebalnced for egc. MYC seems like it in a  grey area.  Are you really gonna try to ambush attack someone who's only exposed for 60secs? I would assume you'd just use the normal movement to get back to the hook to try and find them rather then crouching all they way back (unless you're watching from a distance to track the rescuer but then still normal movement speed would help you close the distance before they hide.  Are these perks really worth running on the pig? MYC always seemed like it worked better on high mobility killers, noed might not make it to the end of the match and STFBFL is if you don't wanna ambush.

When I'm playing killer and someone tells me thanks for being fun minded gamer it's a cool feeling !
---
Wonder how many weeks it will take
---
Use whatever add-one you want, and ignore what others have to say. As long as you‚Äôre having fun, that‚Äôs all that matters.
---
What did OP's image? He deleted his /u wtf
---
Maybe do some reserch instead of bitching. Every lunge is the same. It looks wonky because of his size
---
This reminds me of the Don‚Äôt Starve art style
---
Definetly switch to killer for a few days, I find that helps since you dont have any teammates to ruin your games lol! I rage at my teammates more than at the killers üòÇ
---
I bet you‚Äôre fun at parties.
---
Glad this is just a shitpost. I hate when people come on the subreddit to complain about stuff that they did wrong.
---
No it‚Äôs not
---
I just depipped because the kilelr DCd. First time that's ever happened. And I know sometimes it's a visual bug but his one was real.
---
His lunge range is the same range as all the other killers' standard lunges. It's not longer. This is a misconception. You should be focusing on the distances in which any killer can hit you with their lunge, and not at his animations.
---
Nah, everyone would use a basement build with this then. Plus they woukd get free add-ons for camping the basement
---
What do you even mean by outplay mechanic? It's stupidly easy to notice if killer is trying to mindgame you around such loops and they can barely do anything about it.

---
You can also try the trick of beginning to teleport to the gen that's right behind her and waiting to see if she jumps over the pallet. If she does go over the pallet, you can just cancel the teleport and slap her for a free down.
---
Clown and Trapper are both C tier
---
I don‚Äôt teabag killers unless I‚Äôm about to escape. That‚Äôs asking for a tunnel and face camp
---
&gt; On a real note killers have different lunge ranges based on movement speed 
---
Uh, they changed this a loooooong time ago, my dude. Lunge ranges have been standardized for like, more than a year now.
---
It can‚Äôt and I kinda like it tbh. Makes Meyers s p o o k
---
Why T-Bag at all? It's pretty pointless and makes you look stupid and childish
---
JACK THE FUCKING RIPPER
---
Not really, especially if there's a gen near that fake pallet. He can easily just teleport right to you and follow your aura.
---
Her power is split into 2 parts, traps and stealth. The crouch makes you slower but no terror radius, if i wanted no terror radius i would play ghost face. The traps are meant for slowing the game down but it doesnt work as well as legion bc he can indefinitely slow the game down with his power but pig can only trap 4 times.
---
For me i have less fun if im losing bc of my character, not that im not doing well bc im dumb. Pigs power is just watered down and theres chatacters that does what she does better
---
So to fix the problem you have, it's ok to ruin the game for 4 others.  This is the game you bought and are playing by choice, why not use the nurse games to get better instead of quitting?  Seems silly to have a game that you won't play fully because of fear of dying to a certain character.  You must always win every other game vs every other killer right?
---
I think killer secret offerings shouldn't be shown at all. A mori should be a secret thing, not something that's basically broadcasted to the entire survivor team just because the killer offering didn't flip over.
---
That literally never happens. At that point Fredster is wasting more time switching targets and it's always better to stay committed to a chase unless they're going through select faux infinite loops.
---
Depends on whether the killer has been a dick the whole game or not. Whether he‚Äôs facecamped a friend or tunneled someone until they died. Which at my current rank is nearly every game. Also you are clearly the childish one if you think someone crouching fast is a reason to get angry.
---
Is that supposed to be a joke or am I missing something
---
"That literally never happens" when he just came out a few days ago, lmfao. Plus, this exact thing is how I downed an injured survivor just the other day. An injured survivor kept slamming down the fake pallet I kept putting down, and I followed her aura over to where she was crouching in a corner for a free down and hook.
---
true
---
Yes those are exceptions but since it‚Äôs Reddit I have to consider how many people want to lie to themselves, and the Internet, and act like they‚Äôre so good they don‚Äôt need to camp. It‚Äôs a fine strat but I feel like it takes a lot of cred away from streamers/players who actually don‚Äôt need to camp. I see so many killers wants this cred but in the back of their mind they prioritize proxy-ing the hook. I just want the community to get a grip and self observe honestly.
---
Huh?
---
Where is he from? His accent is cute
---
I dont understand.
---
Came here to say this. The majority of the time she's throwing hatches she isn't humming, due to being in a chase. It's a cool theory, but it doesn't really hold water.
---
Did you get a screen shot? It‚Äôs like that one of Jane under the gen lol
---
Just change the offering screen alltogether, just make people aware 5 offerings were burnt and leave it at that.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt have had a chance since billy knew where open gate was likely I‚Äôd go for get get tapped once and it‚Äôd be death Either way
---
Something being hard =/= something not having counterplay. Nurse having a slightly steeper learning curve doesn't warrant her literally ignoring the game.
---
I dunno it happend after i got hit. The galaxy icons are pretty nice.
---
Not to mention this actually makes the extra box add on a self-nerf when used

So wholesome the killer wants to farm.

Totem not revealed by map on new badham
---
I went into a match with a green map, green stamp and a red twine to find totems, but the totem in the kitchen inside of the two story house won't get revealed when I read the map, this has happened twice. Note : I don't know which version of Badham specifically this was, I forgot.
---
Get fucked son. These guns aren't even using good perks. Calm spirit? That rank 2 got 3 exhaustion perks lmao
---
If I see the unhook happening and have the decision to go after the one that was hooked or the saver I‚Äôm going for the one that was hooked. Why make the game harder for myself when it‚Äôs your OBJECTIVE to kill the survivors
---
Survivors who suck at the game like to shift the blame onto the killer when they lose. Play the game how you want, ignore the people who try to tell you how to play.
---
Who guarantees us that?
---
That'd actually be a nerf in a lot of situations.
---
If you are running rule set nr. 2, less people feel pressured to look for the boxes. Your trap is inactive, there is no real pressure. Instead of aimlessly running around, you can get on a gen.
---
Without rule set nr. 2 there is a higher chance people actually go for boxes. This is what you want, a game delay.
---
the anniversary what
---
This was a waste of time.
---
Ah shit, yeah that definitely makes things more complicated.

This motherfucker made a doctorate thesis on the lore of a bug filled mess. Hats off to you my dude

Lmao. I actually love that freaking songü§£ü§£ imagine if someone actually did that üòÇüòÇ
---
I mean going for the trapped people is the wrong play most of the time.
---
Those are the guys that you are certain won't be getting on a generator anytime soon, so instead of pressuring them when they can't even do objectives, go for those that are sitting on gens and not running around looking for boxes.
---
She has a face model.
---
Unless ur playing leatherface or billy then u can get both maybe
---
The point isn't that top tier players are *wrong* for using the best builds available, but that it's fucking boring and tiresome to tryhard every game.
---
Or leave straight after the game ends so no salt in chat
---
Not, but at least they have to warn killing me,
---
I just wish there was a perk that combines Unbreakable with Tenacity
---
gotta get those 4 stacks.
---
Survivors are worse than skins. They‚Äôre time gates to getting perks. Survivors need passive abilities that make it so that I have a reason besides 1 perk to level that survivor.
---
TBH all offerings on your side should be (your side being survivor or killer)
---
You should know what your teammates burn and that‚Äôs it
---
Um, no it should not be known, lmao. There's a reason why moris are supposed to be *secret*. **Plus** survivors aren't supposed to be able to just pick and choose what matches they want to go in into as well. Thank you.
---
Really good guide. One thing to note though about the Gen teleport is that there is an add-on that while it disable his ability to cancel the teleport, the 5 second warning appears on all gens and I do believe the husk for the Gen he's going for appears very late. While you should still walk to a hiding spot, just note that in doing so, it does slow gen repairing a little bit

Its worth it man. Just wait till youre the most feared thing for survivors.

Left this game because I felt it was too toxic. Maybe playing with people I can get to know through the game would make it more fun. I'm open for any type of gameplay. I'm terrible though and need to practice a lot more.

But that's exactly what I mean. You are busy chasing someone who wouldn't be working on a gen anyway while other people are doing the objective.

New Legion if you stab someone with Deep Wound while in Feral Frenzy, you dont do anything to them and stun yourself

Upvoted for disagreeing with cries for nerfs. If I had gold or silver, I'd give as well because you explained legit counters in a clear and simple way.
---
Freddy is by no means top tier, let alone OP, and it kills me because Freddy on release received the exact same reaction. 
---
Original Freddy with double dress addons was arguably much stronger since it could essentially keep everyone in the dream world and disabled stealth. Had a lot of fun with that build.
---
But new Freddy finally has any chase potential with his power and has gen pressure sometimes. Survivors aren't used to a killer like that. Killer mains don't play Nurse as a  mercy to survivors and it honestly sucks. People forget that killers are allowed to present a challenge.
---
was this supposed to be funny
---
this is cursed this is bad oh no
---
I know, I was talking about stabbing all 4
---
Unbreakable and Tenacity should have been a single perk first of all. There is no reason to have a slugging perk that is normally situational to be so weak.
---
I am proud to be a spirit main

what if it was a child that would be better right
---
You son of a bastard
---
;)
---
So shaving off 25% progression instantly is bad?
---
Well without Borrowed Time you actually have to rub 2 brain cells together to get a safe unhook.  That's too much for survivors - better just get carried by stupid perks that reduce the skill cap.
---
You didn't follow the survivors rule book for killers
---
After every 3rd game
---
I dont understand why people bring those in lol. I guess maybe prestiging a character or something but its not like those are coming back. I get one the same way too :)

That's what I mean, would be so powerful

no, i dont bully. ever. no matter what

Pretty sure they did in the anniversary stream.
---
Maybe the huntress too?

oof

Rule Set No. 2 does nothing but slow the game to Hell. It forces Survivors to spend a super long time on boxes if they decide to go for them before their traps start, and if they decide to wait till they're activated and they're going for boxes, then they have a worry of head pops, and they're forced to do boxes until they get that trap off. And if you even do something as simple as chase people off their box, you give yourself a better chance of a headpop. I've only ever gotten them with Rule Set No. 2.
---
Have you seen his face when he lunges towards a Survivor? It's truly terrifying.
---
I've thought a lot about Ghostface and Wraith, but their tiers are due to interactions between Killer powers and Survivors being more highly valued in this list. With GF, the trial is a constant cat-and-mice game with a lot of "found you" and "found you first" moments, while Wraith's add-ons are unfortunately quite unilateral for the most part.
---
Most of the counterplay for his add-ons is "just listen to his feet stomping the ground or be wary of the shimmer" which just aren't as fun as constantly having to expose each other because the Survivor doesn't really have an agency over Wraith's power, just over their own stealthiness.
---
I agree.
---
Yeah but it doesnt feel the same man
---
I can't find the latest issue
---
Postal 2. The best game ever created by mankind.
---
Quwstion: keep getting different numbers with each match on preschool. Like idk if theres actually that many maps or what but I've seen like badham I, II, III, IV, V and I'm confused
---
No, I said I was defending the original comment, fuck up. While also pointing out that you should use words more accurately if you want to avoid the susceptibility to comments such as his instead of fucking whine.
---
We all knew what you meant and that's what's important, but you aren't allowed to bitch about someone picking at something you yourself inflicted.
---
Same way they would punish someone for bodyblocking someone else in a corner all game I guess. Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should lol.
---
tbh, feels better for me
---
Every 60 seconds in Africa, a minute passes.
---
It is not your fault unless you face camp survivors  and hit them multiple times while hooked. other than it is 100% survivors fault for not safe hooking.
---
I can tell you have never played killer
---
This thread has helped a great deal and I've been working on it. I appreciate the help. :)
---
Definitely the most frustrating part of their kit, especially when you literally can't down anyone with FF anymore (unless you're willing to waste well over a minute and have purple add-ons to burn).
---
I guess I'm the only one that downs the unhooked and then chases down the guy that unhooked?
---
It's not full blown tunneling, but I'm not going to intentionally make poor decisions.
---
It depends on how long it was before he vaulted that window again tbh, if it was within a couple seconds then he definitely cheated, but if he left and came back after another loop or something, basically longer than a few seconds, it will open back up again after a short time.
---
So, because I didn‚Äôt use the word in it‚Äôs 100% accuracy, I have to get corrected... Or you could just interrupt like a normal person...? The word ‚Äòliterally‚Äô isn‚Äôt as ‚Äòliteral‚Äô as it used to be. If you or the other guy have any social interaction, than it‚Äôs pretty obvious, but I guess I will move my words around a bit. Just so I don‚Äôt get dumbass replies, like I have.
---
Very good guide.
---
I'm pretty sure it's showing that it's the "x" version of Badham. For example, the one in the clip the "III" version. When they remade Freddy, they remade his map as well
---
Those are unilateral. Altho I don't consider B a bad tier (it's just mid) it kinda pained me a lot to put her in there because I think she is indeed a lot of fun, but just as with Wraith, the Survivors don't have any way to interact with her power besides running from hatchets. Which is very, very fun to do, indeed, but doesn't give Survivors any real agency over the Killer power.
---
But what *really* killed her in this tier list is that her add-ons are a mess or just outright power creeping without any real change to her power besides numbers. Add-ons play a much higher role in this list than the power itself. Otherwise she would easily jump to the A tier or maybe even more.
---
Dont get me wrong, theres a learning curve on nurse ofc, i just meant that its so much harder to master other aspects of playing killer like working around tiles/structures , dealing with looping, its waaaaaaay harder than mastering blinks.

Phillip Ojomo was just a guy who killed his boss predator style and ran away, so i would assume he is human

---
It was as soon as it made the blocking sound i moved around the trunk since I knew he wouldn't be able to vault over it again but he somehow was able to
---
An absolute masterpiece
---
Didn‚Äôt bhvr‚Äôs roadmap say something about a luck rework?
---
It gives them a head start when bugs are found during it, you don‚Äôt lose anything when some spaghetti breaks the game, it happens, this is their first successful title and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre trying, cry about it
---
I‚Äôm a stealth and juke master with Adam, he blends in and doesn‚Äôt breathe loud like David, Jeff or Ash.
---
Survivors be like: wow tunneling killer as they are unhooking the second after you hook.
---
We can also have a Michael Myers mask that is like rotting away and revealing parts of his face, sort've like Rob Zombie's Halloween II mask
---
Yeah he somehow glitched it then. There's no perk or anything that lets you ignore the entity blocking anything.
---
You don't have to enjoy something to get an adrenaline rush from it, but the description of feral frenzy calls it a deep rage, so I guess you're kinda right
---
Uhm no, being balanced means that a situational perk must be really powerful. Tenacity is low tier and being paired with Unbreakable won't make both unbalanced, will only make Tenacity viable. The fact that not many killers will slug means that Unbreakable should be very strong to punish that one match in which the kiklery will slug. Just like Balanced Landing: it's the most situational exhaustion perk and to balance it, they added a passive that will work even if you are exhausted. The less situational, Dead Hard, needs to you being injured and also good at timing, in exchange to being an activable perk.
---
So he cheated by exploiting a glitch then?
