With all due respect pretty much every mechanic in the game deserves to have some form of counterplay.  EGC is meant to be an anti BM measure nothing more.  Also I've seen survivors screw themselves with this tactic by not having the door opened fast enough after they pulled off the save and the last survivor in the conga line getting downed as a result.
---
---
---
The achievement is worth it, don't let your dreams be dreams, just do it.
---
It says on DBD Wiki that with scrathed mirror you can't get past tier 1 of evil within, so why mix it with endless tier 3?
---
Might also add in that NOED is a bad excuse of a perk. You should never aim towards getting end-game in reality, but instead aiming to close out the game preferrably way before last generator has been popped.
---
Chain, Saw
---
Having "Stances" for characters isn't a fundamentally bad idea, but they would have to be very similar, unlike Old and Current Freddy's kits.
---

---
In this case, the most amicable thing to do would be to release Old Freddy's kit as an original character, and then make them free in general, free to Freddy owners, or a reduced iri shard price, considering old Freddy fans basically had what they bought swapped out on them and it'd be rude to make them buy him a second time.
---
Bringing back a widely-reviled kit on a licensed Killer would be kind of rude to EVERYBODY, including Candyman.
---
lol i dont mean together. One or the other. Guaranteed 4k with endless tier three, guaranteed jumpscares and fun with scratched mirror
---
Original: Oliver Tree - Fuck
---
wow, way to pick a killer who literally has it stated in his power that his lunge gets bigger at tier 3...
---
You knew fully well i meant normal lunges so stfu
---
Oh yeah Doc is also very hard to play against for beginners, I don't blame you for having a hard time with him, even in higher ranks people do.

oh hehe my bad
---
I haven’t played against Nurse yet and do not want to
---
Relentless pursuit would be op
---
Can't blame BHVR for long queue times if you can't see the queue times.
---
Get LF and Freddy or instead of Freddy Ghostface
---
Hands down best post in this subreddit.
---
Ash has a very nice looking set that reflects how he looks for about 60% of the show.
---
Myers has a very nice set- the knife and the overalls are very over the top with the gore, but then the ask is very subtle- a bit grubbier, and with a streak of blood across the face. I love it. 
---
Also, Freddy’s great as it looks like the Entity just dumped a bucket of blood on his head.
---
Yeah, you probably don't want to play against her, Spirit, or even Billy. Those are 3 of the strongest IIRC.
---
But the matchmaking is bad so queues are already massive.
---
I honestly don't have an issue with the idea, it's just that it wouldn't work until at least dedicated servers are in.
---
It’s not the amount of people you kill it’s how you do it for example tunnelling and face camping
---
Shut up nerd
---
I got a good laugh looking through your previous comments. I'm not a trump supporter myself, but it's the way you try to push your political opinions that is the reason for all your downvotes.
---
Dbd gonewild  you know what to do. ÕwÕ
---
I spend money..... it isn’t as bad as it looks you don’t care about graphics when your playing you care about how it runs, honesty the devs have fixed many things
---
You couldn’t see what perks did, they fixed that three updates ago, you crashed every time after a game ends, fixed two updates, you could grab people after they ran away from the vaulted window, that had to be fixed fast, and it was! they are improving the game from what it was and I say they do listen to reviews, 
---
you can’t just through something away because it looks bad that’s like if you just stopped playing DBD for pc/console because it’s beta wasn’t good, *and it is still in beta that’s why it’s free and only in most European countries for testing*  or stop playing it because you had a three man match and then had somebody dc after an hour waiting for it, 
---
it took me eleven seconds to get into that match... so... ur problem you have long lobby times...
---
I should stop ranting, this isn’t about you it’s mostly for everybody that is calling it disgusting even tho it’s not that bad and I only once had to deal with bad lag and it was during a storm
---
PSA: heal no one but yourself unless you are 100% sure you won’t get bit in the a** for it. Every WoMan for themselves.
---
It helps.
---
That looks really good!
---
Nancy is just so cute
---
And? No one is blaming people who play Survivor for gens going too fast (and if they are they're not thinking straight). 
---
That's like blaming people who play Killer for Ebony Moris existing.
---
Yes
---
Yeah, Survivors shouldn't feel unsafe in this horror game. Spirit should be visible to Survivors when using her ability, like Wraith.
---
I am reading ur comment my dude, 
---
and I can say that my NOED has gotten cleansed quite often actually cuz 1 of 2things happen, 1 nothing happens cuz the survs knocked out all the totems, it 2 I get a down or 2 and it gets cleansed. The survs sometimes don’t actually cleanse it sometimes and just gtfo while I’m having my frenzy over in the corner. I saw what you were saying I was just also kinda providing the feeling of getting NOED knowing you only have a little bit to react or not at all cuz it couldn’t activate. I don’t use devour hope that much myself as it’s annoyingly try to protect 2 totems at once (the other being ruin).
---
Mort par le levé du solei. La mort n’est pas une échappatoire
---
This is oddly poetic
---
When the killer closes hatch after someone opened with a key, EGC starts so I don't think it would automatically open again.
---
Hey thanks!
---
well it does look terrible compared to the real game and feels very uncomfortable to play imo.
---
The Devs might do a good job, but that doesnt Change the fact that this looks like a Joke compared to the real game
---
Those downvotes are from making the mistake of trying to convince a bunch of Bernie bros to not tank the election if they don’t get their way, but I feel ya.
---
Killers are technically punished constantly. The only way to not lose progress is to be playing optimally.
---
Borrowed time has been nerfed hard with all the oblivious buffs. BT is absolutly useless against freddy. Just saying.
---
Yea this is just a meme about how al lot of the time survs will be salty about the 4K no matter how much or little of those plays were in there
---
Pizza time.
---
Right now, I think I like ghostface the most. Mainly for air assassinations.
---
That would actually be absurdly funny, make the survivors chase the killer to get their item back
---
he meant the very High fov
---
It’s on mobile and still in beta, it isn’t the Mona Lisa here remember *mobile* the fact I only dealt with annoyingly bad lag once was a miracle
---
Yes it will reopen actually. I had someone do it to me
---
yep, teachables are completely separate from the perk you have on the original character
---
i mean it's not that difficult to wait for the right moment to throw the chase ending hatchet and there are a good amount of times to almost guarantee a hit. Maybe Red addons should take up both addon slots. Iri is still incredibly unfun to go against even with 1 hatchet, just like 2 bink nurse is still unfun even tho she can get many more (for now).
---
Out of all the skins... that's toxic?
---
Why does his eye color change, tho?
---
r/unexpected
---
You don't need ruin on Killers such as Nurse or Spirit, are you fucking delusional? Being forced to run ruin, what an amazing Joke.
---
Poor Demogorgon, how's he supposed to get laid with Quentin scaring off all the action.
---
PGTW would work better for an anti-gen build that STBFL
---
I hate Bernie as well, to be fair. Downvoted you anyway.
---
She is fairly easy to learn yes, but you need to know how survivors run loops and be able to predict their movements and try to counter it quickly. Spirit basically lets you counter play survivors to an extent. She has good loop game is what makes her difficult to deal with.
---
Are you sure it's not just oversaturation? Anyone gets boring when you can't find anyone else.
---
Yes. I’ve had to put down several games because of how hard this shit is though. Color blindness isn’t a sexy disability for causes.  It doesn’t keep me from getting jobs, and people don’t judge me based on it, I just can’t see shit as well as other gamers.
---
I'm not sure how your thought process works my dude. If you so desperately think you need NOED as a back up i can list you some perks that will suit you better if you get "genrushed" that badly :)  
---
First off you can try Discordance, which let's you see when there are two or more survivors working on a generator together. This will perfectly fit one such as you who gets "genrushed" all the time as you can immediately end chase when you see two people are in fact trying to grab a generator. Discordance is also in shrine this week by the way, if you don't already have it.  
---
Secondly we have Corrupt Intervention. This perk will let you seal 3 generators furthest away from your spawn location for 120 seconds in tier 3 (which is about one and a half generator's worth of time). That way you will have a way smaller area to patrol early on in the game. This could get you an easier early start of the game or just help you with setting up traps or other stuff, obviously depending on the killer you play.  
---
Third you can always try Thrilling Tremors. It let's you seal every generator on the map for 16 seconds when you pick someone up and has a cooldown of a minute at tier 3. In addition to sealing every gen, there is also the information you get from it. Any survivor who is on a generator when Thrilling Tremors pops will pretty much reveal their location to you right away since the perk emmits a white aura around the generators that are sealed, meaning that generators that are being worked on as Thrilling Tremors pops will not be sealed and therefore you will know that one or more people are on that generator.  
---
Other alternatives you can look to try out could be ones such as Pop Goes the Weasel, which let's you kick generators and instantly regress them 25% within a 60 seconds timeframe after you've successfully hooked a survivor. Do keep in mind that a good player will manage Pop well and won't see any real need to run both pop and Ruin.   
---
Surge is also a very good perk in the mix for slowing the game down and countering "genrushing", it explodes any generator(s) within a 32 meter radius of a downed survivor and regresses them 8% with a cooldown of a mere 40 seconds.  
---
If you have trouble with getting "genrushed" in general you might want to look at what's wrong with the fundamentality of your gameplay, are you protecting your hex-totems too much? are you committing too much time for one chase? maybe you're not looking at the main objective close enough, which in fact is protecting the generators.  
---
Please do keep in mind that  there are several ways you can change your playstyle and perk setups to effectively better your gameplay and experience.
---
Got a name or link amigo?
---
Ghostface is actually owned by the mask company that created it I think. he is owned by a mask company not sure for the reason. but dbd Ghostface is not scream ghostface. Scream ghostface is referred to by scream. Ghostface is the mask. They got the rights from the mask company. its confusing lmao
---
He shouldn't work once they hatch has been closed if you disagree you're a faget
---
Once it was by accident after hitting the power button when I was trying to do something else, the others were rage from being tunneled
---
Easy solution is to report for unsportsmanlike and if it’s a repeat offender, give them a warning then start giving them a cool down if they continue
---
What does pgtw stand for? I'm probably stupid for asking
---
what are you talking about? I know that.. I'm saying console survivors seen to have no brain so I play survivor on PC :)
---
Is it just me or are Legion's alternate costumes AMAZING? I never cared about that killer until I sat down and looked at all of them in detail. Not only do they all look SO GOOD, but I love how they fit into the theming of Legion being a group of people and so each has their own completely different look and even different posture. I love it.
---
Haha I would but I’ve been red ranks for awhile and I enjoy it. Only recently did I decide to go tryhard for the achievement
---
I don’t hate Bernie, I hate his supporters that think he’s the only candidate worth voting for.
---
Sexy Twink Frank in a similar getup.
---
Yea I’m surprised, I’m a rank 3 killer and my queue times are instant but survivor takes forever
---
They're going to but they're also going to Nerf the shit out of her because that's what they do when they fix add-ons, billys fucked
---
For the same reason that they don't need the base kits of hillbilly or huntress. Shes not OP. She just makes the survivors have to play differently. She punishes the aggressive survivors. Stealth is the best way to play against her and play erratically so she cant read you
---
lmao you're such a child, what are you, 12 ?
---
Nurse is better but yeah, they need to go.
---
I say this as someone who plays a lot of Spirit
---
Would be cool if you posted a tutorial but thank you
---
U
---
Can we get a fat F
---
watching this hurts my soul
---
Least you finish a game all day iv been crashing
---
-Buff Emblem XP to the point where you can feel good about it.
---
-Raise BP caps to 10 or even 12k per category.
---
-Give drastic buffs to the low-tier Killers. I mean wacky stuff, like letting Clowns set bottles on windows and gens to be knocked over by vaults and pops, letting Wraiths phase though pallets, or making Doctor's snipe on top of his base shock by default.
---
-Multi-Killer mode; Co-op or Vs. both acceptable.
---
-More Survivor BP outside of surviving; easier Killer pips/Adepts.
---
-Matchmaking good enough that I can actually get a match as Killer, maybe even against people within 10 ranks of me.
---
This isn't The Spirit.
---
I'd take a thematically interesting and aesthetically pleasing killer over an effective one on most days.
---
E
---
For me or the killer
---
Pop goes the Weasel; Hook someone then for a few seconds, you can inflict 25% regression on a generator  immediately
---
If they rework the key, then they must rework Ebony mori, because that shit is the exact equivalent. Imo they should both be removed from the game since they don't provide ANYTHING other than making you go to the next match as quick as possible
---
the entire gameplay from both sides
---
I would scream even louder, that thing gotts hurt
---
but mostly the killer
---
Oh, I don't have it. Also them knowing I have discordance and spreading out means I can kick more generators for surveillance.
---
What?!! How?
---
Yes. Huntress is an alien from area 51.
---
2dc from console huntress
---
At least she got cosmetics, looking at poor Quentin in a corner crying.
---
Thanks for these tips but for the record, I know what just about every perk in this game does
---
I hope you are beeing sarcastic...

Eh what? Long lunge and fast cd after attack during frenzy? That's old Legion. Now missing an attack brings you out of frenzy and stuns you for like 4 seconds
---
Its one hatchet wym 2
---
I've changed it again, I think another range killer might be interesting
---
Nah, cause I enjoy facing most killers at purple ranks, which I usually stay at so I don’t hit Spirit only ranks.
---
you didnt have enough charges to finish the heal so when the skill check went off at the end the merit ran out and you weren't able to finish the heal or hit the skill check so it counted as a fail
---
Supposed to be red ranks too and my perk setup isn't even that good, but of course one of them makes sure to call me a trashcan right after their DC
---
I've seen a lot of bad survivors on PC in videos, seems there's just as much on PC as there is console
---
you need to be really good at chasing survivors if you want this to work at higher ranks, chases must be less than 20 seconds
---
Well yeah, I'm saying long lunge and fast CD after attacking a survivor, not just swinging at the air. Landing that FF hit is always really satisfying for me personally.
---
Lol use both and you become burger king myers and are literally slower than base speed nurse
---
Yeah, she's pretty ZZZ-tier for me.  I don't see any fun in hoping she suddenly becomes Helen Keller mid-power.
---
Lol my bad I dont know play huntress, then it should just be removed a permanent one shot ranged weapon is broken
---
if you're kicking gens that often brutal strength could add up very nicely

---
Who in the hell actually mains Jeff? Gross.
---
What an attention obsessed freak, surprised your mom gives you attention the way you act, pathetic.
---
Nice strawman. I said "killers were forced to use ruin". Killers, plural and general. Not two specific ones.
---
And even though PGTW was buffed to actually be useful, Dying Light is ok, and Thana is ok, Ruin is still the best way to slow the game down to this day bar none. And it relies on their shit totem placement system which have been made so simple that a 5 year old could cleanse them.
---
So yes, players who didn't use the best killers who could at least stall the game through slow-healing perks or quick downs via a great killer, have to use ruin or risk gen rush. And it's all because the devs are too incompetent to make secondary objectives for survivors, or just want to keep the game as basic as possible since they don't think you can handle having to do more in the game.
---
Well survivors, run a perk if aren't skilled enough to counter Prayer Beads. Run a perk, and don't look for pity here. You have the tools to do it, so do it.

---
Dunno if this is witchhunting but I ran into him a few months ago. I'd argue he's pretty toxic. Won't go into further details.
---
&gt;Tbh barbecue sounds like it would be a hex perk
---
Barbecue is fine and the locker change was unnecessary but survivors were crying too much at the time. BBQ is supposed to help reduce camping by giving the killer a target far away. Being found and being caught are two separate events.
---
&gt;They can easily look at a wall, turn around while picking someone,
---
Like killers couldn't do this before??? What???
---
&gt;they pick survivors much quicker than before,
---
Even then, with the right timing it still can be done. Just because it takes more skill and timing to use doesn't mean it's broken or "nerfed into the ground". 
---
&gt;they have multiple perks designed to counter them too
---
I can think of two. Franklin's, assuming the killer can hit a flashlight-holder first, and Lightborn, which I haven't seen a killer run ever. 
---
&gt;Listen friend, I actually pretty much NEVER run any items or add-ons on my survivor games. But it's pretty demoralizing to see every single fucking thing survivors have get nerfed or be complained about, when there's plenty of absolute bullshit killer add-ons. WHEN will survivors catch a break? They've been nerfed directly and indirectly for a year straight. Of all the broken things to complain... keys? seriously?
---
I never said that there wasn't anything that killers had that were broken. Prayer Beads on Spirit can be gross, I-Heads on Huntress probably could do with some changes, and a couple of others. But the thing with these is that they can at least be countered in some way. Survivors can guess what a Huntress or Spirit is going to do, and in the case of Spirit they have a myriad of stealth perks to avoid being found in the Phase Walk. Meanwhile, keys have no sort of counterplay at all. 
---
Plus, the game was balanced in the favor of survivors since the very beginning. When killers can actually kill without relying on the survivor to make a mistake, that's when the game will be balanced.
---
Hello detective

Correct answers are being downvoted ^ It will open again.

Eh I guess but it was so damn funny

I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
not that one. the comic version lol.
---
I say, 99 them and if it don't work then just stalk
---
personally as a red rank if you want to keep rocking this build - I'd change 2 perks. Surveillance and Discordance are gonna be the staples so you keep them - but switch out SaveTBFL and Surge for Brutal Strength and Ruin. Surge is a low value perk because at most you'll usually get 1 or 2 gens hit with it, and you can just go kick with brutal instead and it doesnt take that much more time.
---
I don’t want an absolute nerf just a way to make it more fun I guess.  Cause atm she’s tied with legion for most boring killer to face to me.

Petition to make this the new loading screen

Can confirm. In a totem challenge all the totems were gone before I could find one and I suicided. 
---
There's also a search 2 chests with plunderer's in one match. 
---
I don't mind but some of them are pretty specific and require you to go out of your way. I saw one requiring killing all 4 survivors and I am unsure if they mean sacrifice or mori. If Mori, clench your buttcheeks because you're going to see Ebony Moris almost every match.

Yeah, I was just goofin'. IDK, the Entity did it.

Them being rare doesn't make them balanced. That's not an effective way to balance an item. I see at least one key in nearly every single game. That probably wouldn't change if keys were brown rarity.

Also how is a part of the game that has zero counterplay somehow balanced? That doesn't make any sense.

Nah, but seriously, my strat is always just to see what Otz has done and if I like it. Would Unrelenting stack with Frenzy to let you speed-stab across the map?
---
I would like to play killer and survivor equally but survivor is generally less frustrating if youre doing poorly because if you lose, you go to the next game fairly quickly but if youre killer and youre losing then you have to sit through the entire miserable game of getting looped and danced on
---
People being reckless trying to be noob3 or something

Well they’re wrong.

Wtf? So I found a match and because some baby leaves I have to leave, double depip, and get a new match? You're fucking dumb
---
On ps4 killer queue is 30 seconds all the way to red ranks meanwhile survivor queue takes about a full episode of stranger things just for the killer to disconnect because he saw 3 man swf of all p3 survivors with flashlights
---
Why is there even room for that many survivors now? 🤔
---
As whiny as people are about getting killed, it seems like they actually prefer a dangerous Killer to a tedious one. Doctor and Legion are reviled, despite being very low-threat Killers.
---
I honestly have no idea.
---
The only nerf Spirit needs is a vaulting animation.
---
Yes.
---
I dislike playing as Myers in general, but I am highly amused by how he can use survivor's stupidity against them. Only other ones who can do that are Hag (People who run off the hook after being rescued) and Plague (People who never cleanse or cleanse way too often).
---
Doesn't that make me better considering I can play on 30fps and be rank 1 constantly 💜
---
....On me or Susie?
---
That would be p2w
---
It definitely is. Especially when they're all grouped up and you get 4 hits in a row
---
Nope just know console version of dead by daylight is dying off
---
Could they legally, though? I mean, technically, they removed Old Freddy in terms of kit, but you still have to have something after exchanging money, right?
---
Why are you mentioning hitboxes? This is clearly a desync.
---
Oh yeah
---
VIBE CHECK
---
What the heck are you talking about? It's impossible to tell if they're bring in a key? Gee, I guess because survivors just have so many incredibly small items, huh? Wait, but the only small items are the rare limited firecrackers and the much more common key! Golly.
---
What I'm trying to say, SURVIVORS STAND DIFFERENTLY WHEN HOLDING AN ITEM IN THE LOBBY.

Noticing random chest keys can be harder but doable, I think survivors run differently while holding items?

Riiiight and whys that?
---
"YOU'RE GONNA DIE, CLOWN!"
---
Seriously, though, PC Nurses vs. Console Survs would be abject cruelty.
---
New 8 survivor 2 killer mode and half life 3 confirmed!
---
I love how they just spaced out when you started the saw xD
---
A perk that synergizes with Spies like that could be really strong, especially if you get to manually place birbs.
---
Offerings are only worthwhile if all 5 players can use them and meme Birdtown.
---
It can be done if the killers let's them, if they mess up, how often do you see flashlight saves nowadays? If the killer doesn't want to get flashlighted while picking up a survivor they just don't.
---
Franklin's, Lightborn and Overwhelming Presence, that I admit is weak, but it's there.
---
I'm sorry, I don't think I agree with you here, how do you "counter" players beads or insta hatchets? You WILL eventually get downed, regarless of how well you play, and if not you, your team mates. IMO, guessing is NOT valid counterplay. The problem is not getting found during phase walk, its getting found after you got hit, no stealth perks are gonna help you then if the spirit is good.
---
Not all stuff is meant to have counterplay, this is not a competitive game my guy. Good add-ons spice up the gameplay, im fine with them as long as they are not in every game, hence why RARITY is important, and they aren't mindblowingly overpowered like BNPs and Instablinds used to be. But keys are not one of them, if multiple survivors escaped via key, you probably already LOST, 5 gens done and 4 survivors alive. And if one suvivor got a free escape, so what? is not a win is they dont get STOMPED? 
---
I'm sorry if I come out negative, I seriously don't get people on this subreddit. Survivors were disgustingly OP once and i fucking admire the killer mains who endured that at the time. But since then playing survivor is so frustrating, every single thing thats decent or midly strong gets called for a nerf. Not every game has a Claudette deathsquad man, the solo survivor experience is miserable. And seeing people complain about the most innofensive item survivors have just makes me sad. Killers get insane add-ons, offerings that win them the game before it even starts, but noooo, one measly survivor got a free escape at the end of the game is too much, gotta take that away to.
---
Either way, I shouldn't have to memorize a bunch of different character animations to figure it out. Plus, many of the early survivors animations are incredibly similar when holding an item vs when not holding one. This isn't seen as much now, such as David wiping his nose with his thumb or Steve placing both his hands on his hips, but it still isn't an effective work around. 
---
That still doesn't justify the fact that keys have zero counterplay without altering your build.
---
*W I G . . .*
---
Clown's the only one that really caught my attention.
---
It's a bug, I've lost purple flashlights, keys, insta heals, even though I've not used them up and escaped I've still lost them
---
It’s ok, sorry for getting too personal about my life, it’s always my last resort when I get bullied....but let’s forget about this and get on with our days, ok?
---
We need both
---
This isn’t a fucking fandom none of the “shipping” bullshit belongs here
---
Ye
---
I DC when I want, sue me
---
That's not a Sniper Doc. Sniper Doc is Interview Tape (Beam Zap) with the best range addon, NOT Iridescent King.
---
Some one stitch his mouth shut and cut off his fingers
---
I'm a Survivor Main, but I've recently started playing killer a bit (Bubba) and HOLY FUCK, I can see why talk about DCing Survivors.
---
Someone stitch his mouth shut and cut off his fingers
---
Pretty good job so far
---
*Person in the clip thinks the other person is Legion*
---
Him: Oh f\*\*\* I thought you were the Legion.
---
Legion: **WHOMS'T HAS SUMMONED THE ALMIGHTY ONE!?**
---
That uh, that positioning with GF at the end looks a little um, suggestive.
---
Unless they add the same amount for both versions... the paid and unpaid... just as something nice to work for....
---
These are joke videos no need to be rude even though it’s the typical for legion. Just downvote and move on.
---
Oh right because you dont like it it means its gonna die 😂😂 it's the same fucking game you mong
---
But when you dont forget it's always haunted grounds, always.
---
Considering how many people would probably leave if this happened to them, giving props to someone for not being toxic in this situation is acceptable.
---
thanks captain obvious
---
Best bet is to try reinstalling the game.
---
Miss that 90s spidey cartoon.
---
The person cleansing the dull totem that turned into noed must have been very happy.
---
Looks like Jakes been having a little too much fun in the entity’s realm.
---
So me spending money on a wig and a mask is digusting, me trying to have fun is disgusting, yeah sure there is a part of tik Tok that is just plain gross but that’s not me, I’m not on that side of tik tok
---
The graphics looks worse than a shit free mobile game with a thousand ads every minute
---
It looks like an album cover
---
It’s even worse when it’s about to be your second hook and you’re with randos so you can’t even tell them about the totem!! :(
---
What software did he use to make this?
---
cursed_unbreakableicon
---
All the little cry baby survivor mains downvoting me lol and no I don’t play spirit.
---
Not report for struggling, but for using your unhook attempts and just letting it kill you, newer players get the prompt to keep struggling and while it’s disadvantageous this isn’t bad sportsmanship. But you were to see someone use attempts and not struggle, report and if they are repeatedly reported for that, give them a warning and maybe a tip to not attempt and if it continues give them the short cool down.
---
Wow. Wow. Wowowowowow. A fandom means, and I quote, "the state or condition of someone being a fan of something." There you fucking idiot. If u like a game or movie or show and do things for it, for example joining a subreddit about it, you are in a Fandom. And they're just a young girl! What's wrong with you? She make a cheap joke. WHATEVER! MOVE ON WITH YOUR DAY!!! IS IT WORTH YOUR PRECIOUS TIME TO WRITE A HATE COMMENT ON SOMEONES JOKE!? No. No it's not. Just leave a downvote then go your fucking way, don't bother  them. They just did something random and then got said that they need to die. This is why the people hate the internet.
---
Yeah, but then you'll be waiting till the gen is completed

if thats you in the video, then you are on that disgusting side of tik tok sweetheart, you wanna have fun keep it to yourself and friends, this is reddit, people don't like this type of stuff here, tik tok is cringe and you posted cringe, that why people don't like your post. sorry to break it down to you sweetheart
---
Entitled survivor trash lol that’s what this is and no I’m not the spirit as I don’t play spirit.
---
I like to phrase it like this. It's not about giving props about not being toxic. It's about giving props for being such a good sport about such a negative situation.
---
yeah
---
*cough cough* jack ass
---
&gt;It's a joke, man. And disappointment.
---
Because of jokes like this, this community have no idea what hitboxes are.
---
I always tab out cus I don’t want to hear it 3 times per game
---
Gonna have to wait till next year ;(
---
You're missing out! Some of the music is totally rad.
---
I would be deeply tempted by the disconnect button.
---
And then Huntress downs him mid-swing with an Iridescent Head.
---
I REALLY want 2v8 man
---
Look. I just hate people bullying each other. I HATE IT WHEN IT'S FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AS WELL. Your a terrible person. A terrible, terrible person. Why. All she did was some stupid ass skit, and all I did was say 'hey, don't tell her to kill herself!' I've done nothing, she's done nothing, and you've made a fool of yourself. Haha, I win! Your horrendous insults won't save you now, bitch. Yay! :3
---
Feng min had the spot light for about 3 seconds
---
This rift/archive thing is going to be a shitshow... I don't think its going to play out as the developers hope.
---
Hello, welcome to the DBD community. A couple things off the top of my head:
---
1) When playing against a hag, you don't activate her traps when you are crouching over them. Just be aware of them when going for a save on a hook when playing against her.
---
2) If you see a totem, just break it. Don't want to risk the possibility of Noed appearing at the end of the game. 
---
3) I would also recommend watching videos of other people playing the game. I couldn't remember any of the perks at the beginning but I started watching Monto, and was able to get them down pretty quickly. Plus, you learn some tricks in the game.
---
I can't of many right now but I wish you the best of luck 15jackets. Just have fun dude. Also, just a precaution, wait time can sometimes get bad depending the day, so I recommend a good book or watching YouTube on your phone while you wait. Alright well good luck. =)
---
How you got the game?
---
Ya its reaaally bad, I found PS4 (Xbox probably is just as bad from what I see) is the worst and I have my suspicions why. It’s a serious problem.
---
Myers Stalking Dwights on a Gen, Claudette urban evading infront of him.
---
Thanks nerd.
---
Any time &lt;3
---
I imagine the hook is on a cooldown after destruction so maybe reduce recharge time.
---
As a survivor main I agree but her base kit doesn't really need changing
---
3 years and 89 karma. Ouch. Keep up your great Ted talks they’re working great.
---
The majority of people having big issues on the dedicated servers besides having high ping and normal slight growing pains as they work out the kinks have been because
---
1. They're using wifi
---
2. They shut off vsync 
---
3. Raised their fps limit 
---
4. Don't have steady FPS
---
Or worse some combo of the above.
---
I think that’s the visual definition of button smashing in hopes that something works 😆
---
Nice work regardless 👍
---
the point of this post
---
your head
---
Locker change is pretty annoying. As a killer, I usually find nobody. As a survivor, I usually am the only stupid doing gens LOL
---
And most of it was from a single post on r/dankmemes
---
I usually study if I’m waiting for matches (same with Overwatch). I’ve watched some Twitch streamers play which was what got me interested in the game. So far I hate when killers camp by hooks or the last generator. What’s a totem look like as I don’t think I’ve seen one yet
---
Anyone wanting to play swf or kyf? DeaconHP on Xbox just pm me anytime
---
Reminds me of the crying witch from left4dead.
---
🤮
---
That's not new. Been happening for a couple months at least unfortunately.
---
I know it's the same game but it's going to die on console also you seen really buthurt
---
Not really. If you were to take the spirit’s ability to grab people away shortly after the phasing, she is, suddenly, not that scary with no whooping sounds (you don’t hear them in most cases anyway, as you always are in her terror radius while in a chase).
---
Grabbing people is the real issue there.... Also, gen tapping, map control etc is a thing too.
---
Except when I play against optimal 4man swf, where all of the survivors are on gens and I usually get gen rushed only getting 1 or 2 stacks of BBQ :(
---
For what it's worth the majority of people having big issues on the dedicated servers besides having high ping and normal slight growing pains as they work out the kinks have been because
---
2. They shut off vsync
---
3. Raised their fps limit
---
I may have used poor word choixe when making the post, lol.
---
Unrelenting is the perk that lets you miss and reduces the miss cool down right?
---
Legion can't miss with feral frenzy otherwise they get knocked out of it and have to do its special cool down animation.
---
I mean, at least the Demogorgon is a biological life form. The Terminator is a machine and uses guns to fight. Tho a killer with the power of a T-1000 would be cool.
---
That it was a meme? I know. I just dont care
---
Bro you definitely break off and chase that guy. They messed up and it’s time to compound that tilt to oblivion by tunnelling them for their mistake
---
Makes exactly 0 sense. But thank you for the try &lt;3
---
*Freddy's Bitches*
---
Btw I went through a lot of the threads here and saw your opinion being shared, and upvoted several posts that got wildly downvoted because I agree with you 100%, even though you come across as a bit of an arsehole. Glad to see you aren’t just an arsehole when someone disagrees with you 👍
---
I meant that compared to the vomic version him in the life action is rather wimpy compared to the comics and this was about powerful characters
---
What
---
Like I give a shit about rules 6head
---
His legs is almost as skinny as wraiths
---
Like this post
---
All abilities that involve the killer directly damaging the obsession removes stacks. Meaning that the only abilities exempt are the Trapper's traps, The pig's trap, and Plague when she puts survivors into the broken state.
---
He never had time for Gym
---
I literally just woke up, so mind my callousness. My head really hurts.
---
Are you bready to die!?
---
That's dope, I like how they used Susie's mask
---
Thank
---
oohhh, you're the rank 20 guy?
---
Can I please just have fun with my videos?
---
Sounds like a bug then
---
He might not need teleport or mobility but if you want him to be on the stronger side he needs either some form of mobility or some way to end chases fastish. The best killers have both. OP's og version has neither.
---
Hes that rank 20 guy that bragged about not getting Hit
---
To get this charm, you have to reach the epilogue of the 4th level through any means, whether it be killer or surv.
---
The 4th level is the hardest as all the challenges need to be done in 1 match and there are only 2 main routes which are solely killer or surv challenges with challenges such as 2 flashlight saves in 1 match or 3 sacrifices in the endgame while using NOED in a single match.
---
have fun with your videos but don't cry if someone tell you their opinion, i get alot of negative comments aswell but i dont care :)
---
HEADON! Apply directly to the forehead!

*HEADON! Apply directly to the forehead!*

Expect it’s a great game in beta and doesn’t have a single ad, it’s also free because it’s in beta and gives log in gifts, which include tickets that allow you to play any survivor or killer for twelve/twenty four hours, shards, blood points, offerings, and cells
---
OP perks lol
---
I’m a cancer so I cry about everything
---
How soon does it go live?
---
whatever you say. u will see
---
100% agree, that's why I said they were completely and grossly overpowered.
---
are dedicated servers still live?
---
Yes, I considered that a possibility and it very well could be, but I haven't seen this issue from anyone else.
---
He hit all the quick time events!
---
i have seen a few ppl complain about the dc issue did you mess with the files? like turned off vsync or anything
---
She looks very fit and I find that appealing, totally understandable to call her hot!
---
FTFY
---
This isnt bullying, People just state their opinion.
---
Also I like Legion, but Im just confused by this video
---
Bleeding after being picked up makes sense for trapper but everyone else wtf
---
October 22nd
---
Keys are fine. If the survivors actually manage to spawn the hatch and then also find the hatch then that's fine. The requirements to use the key are enough. It's a fun item for survivors and it is rare for it to work. Not everything has to be perfectly balanced. Let killers and survivors have some fun and slightly unbalanced stuff.
---
Sounds good the only thing I would change is make it 10 minutes instead of 5
---
Might have to read the comic version
---
imbecil!
---
Please don't bash me again
---
Nothing at the moment, no.
---
You realise Ds, and Bt directly counters tunneling, thats why they exist, balanced landing and iron will aren't crutch, they are just good similar to bbq, and ruin. Noed however punishes players for being good at the game and rewards the killer for playing poorly, that is the definition of a crutch perk.
---
Until they instantly find your totem
---
Really? That seems like an oversight by the devs then, or maybe its a random double standard?
---
i would go on the forum and make a complaint about it as they are listening to feedback trying to make them work
---
dont know, I mean it makes sense, as STBFL only effects Basic Hits
---
once you get to high ranks people just push right through the ruin
---
I’m normally against bullying but damn guys 
---
Why can’t we treat each other equally. Don’t you think she had enough?
---
Nah they're just like Forrnite kids. They're not all bad but there's so many of them that the average survivor is probably a dickhead.
---
I wasn't trying to be political, I just saw this and thought it would be funny to make a meme out of
---
Why?
---
As a killer main i also agree they are almost useless, the only time I get blinded is when I break a pallet. Even then I just use sound to track them, so the blind was pointless and a waste of their time. And I see more pallet saves than I see flashlight saves.
---
Then buy battlepass tiers or the skins directly if you can't be bothered to play the game. It's not like they are lootboxes. Miss me with this.

should be counted as a power cooldown

Then why does it affect Feral Frenzy and Plauge's corrupt purge?
---
Their system is so confusing.
---
It's not my fault her booty so thicc I can see it around corners

N00b question: what exactly does "kobe" mean in this instance and where did that term come from?

Congratulations bro! Keep that way
---
A DBD simulator!
---
damn there goes that idea
---
I've been the killer in this situation loads of times. :-/
---
In the pc version you just click the same item, not the equipped one just the one in your inventory
---
I feel bad for you but just moved on. Also pink hair and blue hair is fine. I personally go for blue on Susie because is my fav color but overall I love color hair
---
Well look at his situation! One of them DC, The other one is hooked and the other one is probably looking for the hatch and there is still 4 gens! Of course he is gonna be like that!!
---
it would honestly be way to strong
---
Just having some fun! Also, don't listen to the guy who said TikTok is cringe. People of all ages are on there and I think it can be a very wholesome platform. Keep having fun and being kind!
---
Select the item in your inventory again, that should work
---
Good job you wore regular clothes with a paper plate on your face
---
What the fuck did I just read my guy?
---
R
---
Thank you I can’t believe I didn’t think of that 🤦‍♂️
---
Thank you I’m so stupid lol
---
it is a good idea to struggle to almost max since a lot of killers seem to find it funny to be toxic and drop them near the hatch just to close it on them when they get close
---
Nice nice, very nice Caesarino
---
Lol nah, you're good. Hope you enjoy dbd
---
We will see when it goes live. Once nurse players adapt to this though, which we will, what will you complain about next? Multiple blinks are gone and omega blink is dead.
---
I really haven't had any bad experiences with the dedicated servers so it's hard for me to relate to any of those posts
---
Funny video, good production quality. 
---
My only critique would be use the SMPTE color bars a little less. Besides that it was great.
---
I'm gonna watch some more of your content. :)
---
gonna go ahead and comment it despite knowing I'm gonna get downvoted by hordes of biased one sided survivor mains. NOED doesn't reward bad play it punishes survivors for not doing totems, the whole point of hexes is that they're extremely powerful but can be removed by survivors or in this case never even come into play, in most situations where the killer gets kills with the perk they probably would have done better if they just ran another perk that doesn't set up endgame plays, and just won before that. It's much harder to get more than 1 kill with it, it can be countered and the survivors can easily escape if they killer wants to camp the totem. The time taken from doing totems should be worth the time if NOED is such a game changing perk, yes I agree a totem counter should be in place for both survivors and killers. 1 survivor perk can completely ruin this perk, which means a lot since killer perks should put much more of an effect onto the game. if NOED gets nerfed killers are gonna go on strike for an adrenaline nerf since they're essentially the exact same perk with one small difference, and NOED can be prevented while adrenaline can't. Do every game with the intention of countering NOED before it's proc'd. Not replying to blatant one sided survivors.
---
is it wrong i could see 90s cartoon spidey fitting as 'Dwight' perfectly?
---
1. Cool.
---
2. How does he even see out of that?

I like how you acknowledged he was right and still got downvoted. Gotta love Reddit.
---
"Good job you guys, keep trying."

it's nancy wheeler and "friends with young children" was obviously referring to dustin and the others
---
Very carefully
---
Fuck right off, running adrenaline, DS, Borrowed time, and dead hard is playing like an asshat, but what do you know, I play the game anyway.

You’re in the entity’s realm, what’s stopping it from just keeping you out of the “coma”?

are you sure it does?

HELL NO

Discovered him recently. I wish he had more just plain-ol good games. Not on the tru3 level of just uploading every single game.
---
Or the skill check that always pops when moving off a gen.
---
Spoken as a true blendette self care main.
---
I would like to know as well. OP didn't give anything to back up the statement except "nurse is fun sometimes".
---
Question, I've been thinking of picking up the game on switch but I'm kinda weary of buying multiplayer games for the switch as the ones I've bought tend to die out couple weeks after launch. 
---
So is there a stable player base on the switch, are you playing docked? With controller and headset 
---
I play the game on PS4 and the reviews ive seen for the switch port keep comparing it to Friday so I tend to drop out when they try to compare the pro and cons even though they are different games with different mechanics and objectives.
---
It’s more funny when I’m chasing them and I pass a dull totem and my heart swells.
---
#***Care***
---
Yeah but when I’m just a friendly neighborhood rank 18 wraith I’m just trying to do my dailies lol
---
Oh, that's a better idea than mine. If you see constant games where killers camp, you should think about getting Decisive Strike. It helps counter tunneling killers. As far as the last generator, make sure to not triangle yourself with gens, meaning, don't leave the last three generators right next to each other. The totems is pretty much a skull being held up by bones.
---

---
You could never keep a good cow down
---
I've been talking about this for a while, it's the goddamned Dedicated servers.
---
no. This causes too many issues. Do they keep updating old kit if stuff happens? Do they support it in matchmaking so now people need to worry about which version of a killer they are facing? If so, future skins support old kits? There are too many problems with this, its a shit idea.
---
The meme was funny, my comment was towards the person who decided to make it political.
---
This is what happens when you don't play with headphones.
---
Is this also apart of leveling the bp? Like through challeneges
---
"Later bitch" - Steve
---
Sure DS probably should be slightly changed to be less annoying but complaining about perks like dead hard and borrowed time is really showing your skill lvl. Literally just don't tunnel the guy off the hook and you never have to worry about borrowed time, you can either wait/bait the dead hard, adrenaline on it's own isnt a big deal really unless 4 people are using it and even then it's still pretty tame.
---
It’s annoying and Reddit hates emojis 
---
No one likes it
---
Death is not an escrepe
---
Awesome. Who made this?
---
yeah, as a killer though *we de-pip from that disconnect*. trust me, nothing is more annoying as a killer then watching someone DC and fuck over their teammates.
---
the thing is, there is no "bad" killers in the sense that you will never get a kill on them. Each game is inherently different with players and thus the general skill level. Sometimes a good player will step into a trap and get farmed for it. Sometimes you just don't find anyone and get teabagged at the exit gate.
---
Every killer is able to get a 4k, it just depends on matchmaking luck, and luck ingame.
---
The only change I would be okay with is making it exclusive with infantry belt, so you can't have more than one instant down hatchet. Huntress isn't a very strong killer as it is and this community is getting very nerf happy.
---
Trying to play Nurse on console is like trying to play Prokofiev on a banjo.
---
I love using these things called eyeballs and deductive reasoning.
---
Umm, I guess no one uses Head On ever. 🙄
---
You act like everyone using insta heals and bnp. I can counter that by saying that killers get moris and strong ultra rare addons but i recognise that they arent used every game. Killers have more crutch perks than survivor and pallets on most maps can be mindgamed. So yeah it is your opinion. Just cause you cant 4k every game doesnt mean its the game thats broken.
---
I’d say the game is amazing and you should definitely get it. Though I’ve never played Friday the 13th on switch I believe the games are somewhat similar but most people say dbd is better (or at least I do). I believe there is a pretty stable player base, when playing survivor it takes about 20 or 30 seconds to find a lobby, and as killer anywhere from 5-10 minutes (which I think is pretty normal wait time) I play the game in handheld mode with a pro controller and headset. Also, the game runs fairly well, though there is DEFINITELY room for improvement. I almost died earlier because frames kept dropping on skill checks and made me fail, and great skill checks were nearly impossible to hit. I’ve been playing for about 3 days and that’s only happened once or twice so I wouldn’t worry about it. Overall I was surprised how well it ran and will definitely keep on playing. Also switch version comes with a few extra characters and a ton of cosmetics so that’s an added bonus.
---
Incredible, a neon Nea actually stopped teabagging and flashlight clicking long enough for a photo.
---
Gotta be honest I’d forgotten about the game until this post that I don’t really have interest anymore
---
Has Susies mask but franks clothes
---
I feel like you should choose one between surveillance and discordance and replace with maybe pop goes the weasel or ruin (when you get it)
---
It isnt toxic, it just punishes Survivors for not doing something not critical to their success. So it's a bad perk by design.
---
Then maybe they should learn how to control their emotions instead of mistreating other human beings. Excusing toxicity as "a bad day" is a big problem in this communirt.
---
Fuck those TTV tards most of them are trash players who strictly ruin the game and play like scumbags and ruin this game further! Anytime I get one in the match as a random teammate or survivor if playing survivor or killer myself always ends badly! 
---
On PS4 they are rampant and I have been lobby dodging from now on anytime I see a ttv pop in just because I know it’s gonna be trouble and a bs match!
---
There are very few who carry the ttv name that aren’t scumbags and I tip my hat to them!
---
Never had it happen as a killer so I can only imagine how that feels. People suck.
---
I'm looking forward to see how the rework changed the dynamic. Nurse used to be the best killer, Now I wonder if she's better or worse than the spirit
---
If your friend is brutal "behind a screen", then she isn't a good person.
---
You say that, but I'm rank 6 and frequently get in lobbies with red ranks these days
---
The survivor that DC should also get pips for killer because they are hurting and maybe killing every other survivor in the match.
---
"Suggestion"  
---
I agree.
---
The entity sends me a gift so that I may send him one back
---
Actual posts I have seen on this sub:
---
"Killers with instadown are OP."
---
"Anybody can win with instadown killers."
---
maybe for consoles, but PC vs anything is cruel and unusual punishment for the people not on PC.
---
That thing... It scares me
---
I started having fun as Ghostface when I stopped trying to stalk altogether.
---
no, but you are a massive cunt if you do.
---
Why tho, I just got this game
---
Switch docked actually looks on par with its counterparts
---
Poor dwight
---
doesnt meg literally have the most cosmetics.
---
i dont remember that happening to me. i was lucky enuff to get a mori one tonight, and for cannibal too. thats like my dream ritual
---
#stopquentinabuse
---
What's ttv?
---
Ol'realible
---
It's finger lickin' Good!
---
The most unlikely part of this is that Dwight left the locker
---
She is one of the original 5, so she should have a halloween cosmetic. They did 2 survivors last year, they should do the same this year.
---
At least safety pip
---
Lmao
---
How about no
---
It should be a safety pip. Which it is if the killer uses the leave match option. It only de-pips you and takes your shit if the killer force closes the application
---
FIYAH
---
*blip intensifies*
---
The tools of console don’t support her kit. She’s hard to maneuver on comtroller, the console frame rate makes everything go apeshot, etc etc
---
Yeah
---
EHH HAA HAAAA
---
I was walking through the gates with the killer behind me and he DC so I lost my toolbox and the BPs for surviving. Not happy at all
---
It is an automatic safety pip, but I think at the very least survivors should keep the blood points and offering they used, the killer has no business wasting everybody's time
---
he needs viagra
---
It's not critical to their success, until they get downed by NOED and go on forums to complain about it
---
I think it should be a pip, you could theoretically have been on the road to a double pip you only had to escape but the piece of shit killer leaves
---
bbq is my faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaave perk in teh entire game. but mostly for the points. finding ur next target just makes it all the more awesome
---
I mean he just isnt the worst. Wraith, Clown and Bubba are all worse.
---
Try using perks like Bloodhound and Predator, the Wraith is great killer to start out with. It also helps to play both sides as well.
---
I think it's great how these types of situations occur commonly in this game, it really mimics those cliche horror movie scenes.
---
French by daylight*
---
It is? Huh i didnt know that. They should keep bp and offerings idk why they dont
---
Your Meme sucks and you should feel bad. Just because you used a different picture doesn't mean we haven't seen this a hundred times before.
---
i wouldn't get no mither, it's pretty garbage, discordance is pretty good, so unless you want to get a character with that instead it might not be a terrible buy
---
Leaked Killer: Helen Keller
---
Women just wow
---
Knew it.
---
I feel like I should've brought inner strength instead of adrenaline, but what works works.
---
Claudette does have cool cosmetics though? Well at least different types of ones.
---
Myers thirst is real.
---
I dont agree with the Bubba rework. Might make him a tad to strong. Insta-down mechanics are a very powerful tool and making him faster would almost guarantee an insta down every chase. Survivors would be very limited what loops to go to, "to be safe" from being insta downed.
---
Maybe with addons that would be okay, but not for the base kit.
---
Legion: I like the hide the red stain while in Frenzy. That.... would be....amazing. I personally wouldn't want the map wide detection in frenzy. I like the way it is now.
---
Why not
---
If they actually leave sure, if for whatever reason the connection just fails, nah.

To make survivors DC, run 8th page and 7th page together
---
Always. 
---
Go. 
---
For. 
---
Grab. 
---
There's nothing more satisfying or mind crushing.
---
I feel like the mist offerings need to be beefed up. It would be nice to really be able to mess with visibility.
---
then cant you simply just dodge the hatchet? If you dodge the single hatchet, it literally makes the addon useless, Sure you can bait out dead hard, but it's still a crutch perk. DS and dead hard are in every single game I play, on EVERY single survivor. Both of these perks are just fucking awful to deal with, but I never DC unless of personal reasons.
---
Legion is interesting to me. Degenerates fall into murder and create a group to terrorize and kill.
---
Trapper's story is ass. Rich guy collapses mine, killing hundreds, then takes on the persona of a bear trap laying wild man for literally no explained reason.
---
Medicore?
---
Nono I you got it all wrong. We’re the purple medkit with double instaheal?
---
Changing a charactee is different than removing them entirely. Behavior changed them because he was too underpowered. They made the power and perks to begin with, so it was their choice.
---
Well often by the time blood warden pops, there's no more pallets on the map. It's a very powerful perk IMO!
---
Damnit
---
If that's inner strength and no mither, they won't work together because you can't heal yourself to healthy.
---
Overwatches Halloween event of years past lasted for about 20 days from October 9th to October 31st
---
Team Fotresses Scream Fortress 10 lasted 26 days from October 19th to November 24th
---
Warframes current Even started October the Second and is Slated to end November the 1st.
---
Its not nearly two weeks, its 10 days at most.
---
And what evidence or any sort logical reason do you have for the assumption that another week wont make a difference, or the assumption im not pulling this up because DBD is being somewhat stingy with even duration's for no reason? 
---
Like your doing a hell of alot of assuming and condescension to justify stuff right now, trying to hand wave it off as 'welll youuuuss just need to play the vidya game more clearly and clearly it doesn't matter because you don't play the game enough to use the stuff'. Again im going to do the event like last year (Because despite your assumption i play this game rather frequently when i can, OCE killer Queues can be rough) , but its hard to see this Time crunch duration as anything but intentionally added pressures to make sure people buy the dumb archive season pass thing, because hey here is all this new stuff, here is a arbitrary and ununsual squeeze on said event.
---
Its not just a hallowed blights thing either, the infrequency and lack of duration they tend to do with bloodhunts also is somewhat questionable, like there is not monetization associated with the bloodweb, so why are augmented bloodpoints such a stingy thing (Honestly the entire Bloodpoint system feels like belongs in a free to play game in the first place with how arbitrarily grindy and restrictive it can be, like im half expecting to see some sort of 5$ Premium Bloodpoint Pack show up on the side)
---
Punished them rushing the objective. In a more thorough game survivors should do bones if they’re afraid of NOED. If they don’t do bones I don’t see why they’d complain.
---
 [The Dead Girl 🌷 (@thesireenscall)] (https://twitter.com/thesireenscall?s=09) on twitter doing God's work.
---
I don't get the joke.
---
And Andrenaline being tame? What the fuck, the perk grants a fucking health state and a haste buff on an objective being completed, and said objective has a base time of 20 seconds and can be resumed any time a survivor wishes.
---
Everyone:AAAAAAAAAA

Is it just me or do you run faster on mobile
---
This usually saves me. I get a nurse one and scrapped it and got a huntress one. Reloaded it and got a myers one
---
Maybe those kids were jerks, you don't know.
---
Wow so do you not play dbd
---
I didn't think of that! Tbh I feel like that be hard to make but if I could find something on Amazon or whatever I probs but it! I'm already making the saw out of cardboard, paint and a bracelet. It need to be in a decent price range too. On a budget!
---
Would like some friends to survive with on steam. Kinda tired of having people disconnect at one down or people just giving up after one hook. Name is レイシス
---
Fake news! We all know it was that meth head hobgoblin Quentin!
---
So much legs. :)
---
??  
---
I don't see an issue here? You're literally 3 ranks behind them, not much of an issue.
---
The balancing needed to be from being rank 14 and queued with rank 20s and having a rank 10 killer
---
It’s pizza time.
---
Agreed. That’s the way Id like to have worded it.
---
Itll be awesome to see when its done! You can check the trick or treat studios website im pretty sure they have a reverse bear trap. I think its about 50$ tho.
---
PS4, usually pretty fast. Maybe 4-5 minutes at most, but usually maybe 2 minutes on most occasions.
---
huh neat maybe your right
---
Micheal is one of the best anti teabag at pallet killers xD 
---
I love the ones where they t bag mikey then he insta kills them at the exit gates, as a myers main this has happened to me quite a few different times it never gets old lol
---
Can we get a round of applause for TheRealDysective for proving someone wrong on the internet, being wrong themselves and then boasting about being "correct". Clearly a fine specimen of human.
---
I agree
---
I already spent 64$ on the mask I don't think I can afford that with vet Bill's coming up :( feels bad man.

They are doing a pretty good job so far.

---
imagine thinking bbq needs to be a hex perk
---
Oh no! A whole 3 ranks! I can’t believe you were matched with players so far and away out of your league. BHVR should be ashamed of this ranking system!
---
The DC epidemic has grown to plague levels on both sides of the table.
---
Imagine just fucking enjoying a meme instead of posting your shitty opinion that nobody cares about
---
no
---
Twiggy Piggy
---
Exactly. I played a clown today with pinky finger who was rude as fuck, and the addon was very, very strong, but it’s more balanced than irk heads by a lot.
---
I mean. Plenty of kids have been jerks to me. I didn't strip them naked, stick my dick in them, and then claw them to death XD
---
Twiggy piggy, piggy twiggy
---
Tummy gang wya
---
Swap corrupt intervention for thrilling tremors and that's the build I run in red ranks pretty successfully. 
---
Or surveillance or Whispers, those are good too.
---
This is how they balanced it, what is the problem? You can get players up to 6 ranks above or below yours.
---
"You just go back to doing that gen, Dwight. I'll be with you in a sec."
---
It's 11 days. That's 3 short of 14. So yes, that's nearly 2 weeks. Numbers and all, y'know. 
---
That's great for a whopping 3 games, but as I said, most MOBILE games (which is where events like this originated, you might recall) generally don't last that long. 
---
Why WOULD it make a difference? If you can't do it in 11 days, how is having another 11 going to help any? Keep in mind, the ONLY things time gated with the event are the bloodweb items (medkits, flashlights, and the offerings). The currency to get the 2 outfits will remain past the end of the event in the Rift. 
---
Killer queues can be rough, are you fucking kidding me? Try playing SWF on PS4 some night and see how fucking long you wait for a single match with all the errors and dodgers for crying out loud. Cry me a fucking river. I have NEVER waited ANYWHERE near that long for a match as Killer. EVER. 
---
Well the quests or whatever they will be called to level up the Rift will give additional BP, so that will actually help alleviate that grind to an extent, and they also just made it so we get more perks starting at 40 too, so it's not like it's THAT bad. 
---
And keep in mind, it used to be like four times as worse when this was just on PC.
---
I think Thrilling Tremors sounds good. I’ll give it a shot
---
Bought the wrong shit accidentally but tbh I'm working with it!
---
What are you talking about this is the strongest build in the game atm
---
Frig yuo, New Vegas legion is epig and yuo are totally unfresh unlike me, bubba, and caesars legoin
---
could easily have googled dbd spiderman and posted a link to the video itself, giving the source views
---
no bubba be fresh and fresher than all else
---
Oh no, please don’t stab me Ms Piggy UwU
---
Using no mither only
---
 
---
Possible but a survivor letting go is instant I believe. So no unwind like chainsaw rev
---
The entity demands it ❤ but take a hard helmet for safety!
---
I hate remake Freddy. The look grew on me a bit with mk9 and this game, but that movie was stupid.
---
That sounds horrible haha 
---
Could mix that up with No Mither and Object.
---
Probably because he is better (at least in my opinion)
---
Theres always next time :D
---
if they even dare touch my billy i will be sad :(
---
Very true!
---
Lookin forward to the finished project!
---
I know this is a couple days late, but I'm toying with
---
Thanatophobia
---
Dying Light
---
Corrupt Intervention
---
X
---
build. I'm thinking Sloppy Butcher might not be bad because it'll slow down healing as well. I'd like PGTW, but I don't have the Clown.
---
I like it the way it is. Deep wound is useless but it's super fun running across the map and stabbing multiple survivors, not to mention the baseball slides across pallets.
---
Those knees prove he earned the promotion
---
Thanks mate I just wanted to to try something special for the bois that stuck around I just didn’t want to be on the legion hate list because. Dressing as a survivor sounded good but legion feel more spooky ya know? Anyway thanks again
---
Are you confusing safety pipping for depipping? Because that amount of points should make it impossible to depip
---
I've only seen one episode and even I knew OP meant the kids that were playing DnD in the opening scene
---
I call this weapon "Thumb Wrestling."
---
i think itll be like october 20, right? and go for maybe 2 weeks?
---
Well I just find it annoying trying to get builds to work in rank 15 because the survivors are potatoes
---
If you enjoy playing one side and not the other, it’s not stupid to avoid playing what you dislike.
---
Old DS was a crutch but now DS and BT are not crutch, they punish tunnelling. Adrenaline doesn't matter to a good killer because they'll not let the game get to that point and if it's gotten to the point where there's a 4 man adren then sorry, you already lost. As for balanced landing and iron will...are you having a laugh? How are they crutch? 
---
Noed however is a crutch because so often killers get outplayed all game and then get noed to bail them out. Again, similar to what I said about adrenaline, good killers have games over before it matters. So it rewards killers for playing poorly, adrenaline rewards survivors for playing well and getting the main objective done. Noed rewards killers for not getting their objective done. That's the difference. Just do totems? Yeah true, but if you're not in a swf you have no way of knowing how many have been done and it can waste a lot of time looking for totems that might not be there.
---
If you kill everyone with 5 gens still up are you kill rushing? No, you're doing your objective
---
So stop bitching about gen rushing and don't blame survivors for only having one proper objective and doing what they are supposed to do. Take ruin, pop goes the weasel etc and if you are applying enough pressure on gens and not wasting time on chases you're not winning then gens will not be "rushed" as often.
---
I definitely understand what you were saying. I just wish it wasn’t the case. I think it would be cool to have a viable killer that can just slow the game down to a crawl, giving him enough time to kill the survivors. It would definitely be a fine line though because survivors wouldn’t want to be stuck in long games. I’ll be honest I don’t play killer at all. I just think it would be fun as a survivor to go up against a killer that has this slow burn that sort of drains you. Cause like you said right now if a killer doesn’t have mobility or a power to end chases, the games become pretty quick and if a killer doesn’t know to give up on a good runner it’s boring
---
Electrophiles
---
Isn’t the first suggestion just the original Franks Mix Tape at base kit?
---
As if Ms. Oink isn't prime enough, there's a tummy too.  I'm weak, this is S-tier.
---
Yeah, if survivors can have adrenaline, I can have NOED.
---
So a Decepticon?
---
Only playing what you like is separate than it being stupid to assume you can best learn the game only playing half of it, as per the definition. I’m using the term quite literally and to the T.
---
Thank you! ❤
---
Sadly not here's a quote from their announcement : "The Withering Blight event runs from October 22nd - November 1st. Act fast, the Pustula Plants only appear once a year and when they’re gone, they’re gone." That's only 11 days 10 if you consider they'll cut it short that last day 
---
 
---
&gt; drop them near the hatch just to close it on them when they get close
---
If they are a T.TV I do that to troll, and let them leave through the gate. They curse you out, but when you let them get the door their reaction is funny. They usually don't mind afterwards. :)
---
Any tips for using it?  I love the idea but I'm bad.
---
I too like the running and chain stabbing survivor part of legion but i want to be able to actually use my power after the first few minutes of the game without hindering my ability to actually down survivors because 90% of people dont heal versus legion in my experience.
---
Her weave?
---
Gd he thicc
---
You're welcome, belly piggy!
---
Billy has speed and an insta down in his kit, while Freddy has a innate slowdown, loop shutdown ability and equal to better map pressure with a mind-game with it.
---
*Entity pleased*
---
kinda but i want the survivors to actually be able to do something after getinng shanked thats why i want the speed boost to be abit slower and give his succesfull hits during frenzy a cooldown
---
Gotta love p3 Claudette's. The second they have to take their pinky off of crouch they just don't know what to do :P
---
no mither, and selfcare.
---
God I don’t want to be playing this on next gen... it doesn’t run well on current
---
free Hong Kong.  China yiur days are numbered as a communist scociety!
---
Hey from what I seen on your comments here and what everyone is saying. It seems like people are just trying to tell you that the humor you're trying to do isn't funny. I don't think they all mean to be harsh but yeah. Plus just my opinion, not trying to attack you, but it's kinda cringy. People will tend to attack you more often if you whine about something so just some advice. So good comment right? Uhhh I like the mask.
---
I was watching this girl stream and the game did this.... LOL have y’all ever seen this before?
---
Yes it was a joke
---
The bottom tag line should be that “The Oven is not an Escape”
---
Mrs. GhostFace?!
---
Mrs. Ghostface outfit coming out 2020
---
It's a constructive rant unlike your chody downvote
---
If it was constructive then you wouldn’t have to tell people it’s constructive.
---
It's BHVR, I'm happy if my game don't freeze when killers DC...
---
Thanata is an extra perk to add on since it effects healing.
---
Killers DO dc on that stuff, so idk what your point is. Not like either of the two you named are a real issue after next patch.
---
It was a total nightmare. I play solo and I can tell you I hate BOTH killers and survivors :))))))))))))))))))))))))))
---
Best situations at last 10 pips:
---
1. Spirits every second game.
---
2. Full mori squad on killer once he saw we use items/maps/keys etc.
---
3. Getting killer rage quit after fast ruin/2 gen clear ( lost pip )
---
4. Getting survivors DC if they are first to be taken down by the killer
---
5. People farming you without borrowed time
---
6. Plain facecamp "pretending" to patrol the vicinity while being next to the hook :)
---
7. SWF pointing fingers and tbagging at me while im hooked :)
---
Man. It was a nightmare. Never again.
---
Shape isn't that good tbh
---
Maybe you're just delusional. I wouldn't be surprised if you were one of the OP's I talked about.
---
Probably it got destroyed while you were loading in considering survivors spawn holding it now
---
yeah I like to give the people a chase, and let them get away unless they hit a trap
---
then they have earned death
---
Spirit + Billy S tier
---
Myers Plague A tier
---
less time to work on an event i guess /shrug

imagine using both hands to do gens

this comment was made by the M4 gang
---
I don't think that's a thing.  Likely they spawned in the jungle gym it was in and cleansed it in the first 10 seconds.  I've done it before where it literally spawned in game at my feet.
---
Lmao what a quality game I love it 10/10
---
A Twitch streamer. They’re kinda common. Most are too small to even pay mind to, though.
---
This looks like one of those scammy mobile game trailers that steal models and the game looks literally nothing like the trailer
---
Thank you for not adding ginormous anime tits like most others do.
---
This tier list is pretty rough tbh. I would not put Myers in A tier
---
Holy shit it looks much better here, the fuck v.reddit?

Were the survivors toxic post game

---
Yeah, failed to grab my obsession ealier and missed my swing that should have been a grab, cancel my power, had to lose 4 stacks of STBFL all because of this.

---
Not when the killer has a ranged M1 attack that insta downs you, you don’t have the advantage in any way there

Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?

Ok, didn't quite understood because I really do think whispers is awesome on every killer lol
---
Don't listen to anyone else, you're definitely the mature one here.

HOOOOOOLYYYYYYYY... 😲😲😲
---
Gens don’t have a base time of 20 seconds, wtf are you on talking about
---
meh, this meme builds aren't really that funny.

...Wraith and Hillbilly were also part of the initial release...

*Mass Effect wishes to know your location*

I think this was made to be played with a controller. Or maybe its just a weird, unecessary port for $$. WHO ASKED FOR A MOBLE DBD?
---
Honestly with how servers and hitboxes are, dodging a huntress is extremely easy. Maybe you should play her sometime and see just how much of an advantage good survs have.
---
DC’ing is usually melodramatic. They “stop” playing the game (often with the excuse to save their time) just in order to wait to play another match again. I’m not making any exaggerations in this post lol. They try to “save time” by wasting 4 other people’s time, and their own for waiting in a lobby.. loading the match.. quitting.. and having to do it all over again.
---
Its the new DS a. k. a Disconnect Servers
---
Hey skin tone gotta match right? Tbh it makes it stand out more and feel more cohesive!
---
Come on. It doesn’t take a genius to realize that NOED’s a total scrub perk. It’s aight to run it if you’re a potato who doesn’t know any better or you’re memeing an endgame thing, but when you throw it on there ‘cause you know you’re bad and can’t handle the survivors you may as well reevaluate what it is you’re doing. 
---
It’s not the end of the world to lose. Can’t win em all.
---
Can say that as of the patch i do not hear her phasing while in terror radius.
---
Might as well be, 80 seconds is not enough.
---
Mrs. Stark, I don't want to go.
---
It definately is cool!
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah, would not fuck with Spirit. And I can just say goodbye if I’m up against a Demogorgon.
---
There are at least 2 good window locations on every map, also flashlights are compatible with literally any pallet.
---
Absolutely no reason to be a needless dick man.  Don't let the clowns that upvoted you full you you're just making an ass of yourself.  Let her have fun.  If you don't like it you can say that without being a condescending douche about it.  And the sweetheart stuff is pretty cringe man.
---
Killer doesnt let me escape... it must be their add on and the person is an asshole. Waaaahhhhhh!!!!

Hopefully they will nerf mori's, but also keys in the same update.
---
Bread by daylight
---
pretty easily legion, while a dude with a knife isn't harmless it's something that can be dealt with, unlike nurse who can tear a hole through reality to teleport to you or demogorgon who is a demogorgon
---
This isn’t even that bad?
---
Like totems Lol. Learn how to apply map pressure
---
&gt; I've had spirits who won't close or let you escape via hatch and has No-Ed
---
So...you're mad the killer doesn't let you win? Or uses a specific perk? Fascinating.
---
Haha its all good, its a decent enough question but that one detail makes it a little easy to answer. Maybe "who would be the most terrifying killer" would have been better!
---
Yup keys are skilless bullshit but then again so are Moris.  Both would have to be part of a joint rework.
---
The Pig buff I've been waiting for
---
I had a similar thing happening to me
---
You know when you get hit and you gain a sprint Burst? So i got hit at the exact moment my balanced landing activated and then idk what happend but i got an infinite "sprint Burst" from the hit
---
Zoom bitch
---
Nah, the one being chased might be good at gens. The one failing skillchecks clearly sucks and its better to have them fucking up gens.
---
Same reason that I kill the person who cleanses most last or I let them go.
---
I wish she couldn’t hit survivor hit boxes when phasing
---
Didn’t you hear? The idea that pedophiles are bad is exclusive to Tumblr™, apparently.
---
Thank you so much!
---
From what I've played you need to complete ALL challenges - for both killer and survivor - to unlock the rift fragments. And even with all challenges completed youre still a ways off and will have to grind over 100hours to get the remaining fragments...
---
Hmm. You say that but I have trouble believing you for some unknown reason. Funny how that is.
---
You're late... I'm not paying for those.
---
Demo is A tier? Eh.
---
Spine chill be constantly going off.
---
It honestly depends if you have to play both roles to actually finish it.
---
That said if there is an issue with queue times or something bad happens we know BHVR can and will adjust things to fix it mid-event, so let's have some faith and see what happens before we start worrying about unknown things outside our control.
---
It's also worth noting that, as part of the PTB, BHVR sees how long it's taking people to finish rift challenges and will probably adjust values based on how long it's taking people to finish them vs how long they want it to take for people to finish them.
---
But going by BHVRs very own stats Survive with Your Friends Groups are INSANELY low probability outside of the absolute highest ranks, but even in those ranks it is unlikely to see them. You shouldn't be building yourself off of every group of randoms who have game sense is equal to 4 people who are actively talking.
---
Also, rank = time played, not rank = skill.  Being a rank 1 survivor or killer can be done on even the most trash setups and there is plenty examples of that so don't act like the solution isn't "Get better" or at least "Critique harder", cause it is.  It always is.
---
Hey, get better at the game and stop whining. Why would a killer just automatically gove u hatch
---
That's stupid, games barely even last 10 mins
---
Lol yea
---
Vote now at dennisreep.nl/dbd/

Square
---
True, but they were created and revealed later in the game's development. The trapper and the 4 survivors were the original characters that were shown off right off the bat. And the wraith and billy still got cosmetics for halloween in the first blight event

I find It more annoying than boring

"Killers have crutch perks" like what? Noed? That only affects endgame, it isn't great at all in any capacity. Noed is the only crutch perk for killers. Also, like 70-80 percent of SWF groups I go against has either an Insta or BNP. Not only this, but with just normal toolboxes, they get gens done SOOO much quicker. It isn't my opinion seeing as how many of the top DbD players actually agree and understand where I'm coming from. Killers can't kill unless survivors make mistakes. If you ask me, it should be the other way around. Killers should hold the power since they are the ones that have giant weapons that kill survivors. I don't mean in the sense of "Killers get 4k's every game", I want a few simple changes. I want either SWF to become limited to 2 people, or gens to take longer to complete. That's all I want.
---
finally a high quality mask :)
---
Do you REALLY need me to break down why using a thing that instantly down or instantly kills someone on first hit is NOT making the game worse for others?  It gives nobody a chance to beat you because even if they are higher skill than you, you will down them and kill them before they can even bother to fight you, and unlike Billy or Bubba you aren't trading effectiveness for the ability to one shot, you aren't trading chase power \[Bubba\] nor are you trading higher skill \[Billy\] for the ability.  Yeah, Huntress and Clown are hard, but even I can easily land a hatchet or two and win games with very little effort just using IRI heads.
---
And it decreases EVERYONE'S enjoyment of the game, even you as downing people instantly doesn't give you a payoff in BP or in other tangible ways \[I landed such a good halfway mile hatchet!  I mind-gamed successfully\] because you are just, well, *winning* with such ease and most survivors won't bother to play out the game \[DC or suiciding on first hook\] as a result of your decision, and honestly?  No one should blame them as it's total bullshit to waste time and ingame resources \[Offerings, items, if you bring them at all\] on a game where you go down first to an instakill hatchet kobe and then have no choice but to suicide or feed into the Huntress meat grinder that will reward that killer's more or less highly selfish playstyle.  If there is any addons that need UNIVERSAL removal and reworks it is instantaneous game changers, with heals being nerfed recently and instant downs and kills being next hopefully, as they near require an ENTIRELY different playstyle than the one you normally do given their nature.
---
This is beyond cringe
---
If you watch ghostface on the other screens he doesn't have that plus in his idle animation he throws his knife a bit
---
I posted this 4 months ago
---
She has a bulge though.. Nea a trap confirmed? &gt; _&gt;;
---
For Wraith people might want to say Silent Wraith build but his Aura Reading addon is his strongest possible where he sees survivors while cloaked within 12 meters.  Pair that with his fastest uncloak addon and he becomes a nightmare for them.
---
You will not put words in my mouth about pedophilia.
---
You need to shut the fuck up.
---
This tier is solely based on ratings, so at least it tells how the community thinks averagely of each killer. 
---
Although I agree with both being not that good.
---
Killers don't need to leave the game if they verse good Survivors, they just dodge them in the lobby.
---
The Coxcombed Clapper nullifies and overpowers the Bone Clapper.
---
Coxcombed silences the clapper so the Bone, which makes the bell gong omni-directional, is useless.
---
That's a yikes
---
Spirit has glass fragments, plague has her rotting skin and I don't know about the others.
---
It looks like they stole candyman's hook hand
---
Pls dont compare a insta heal to insta down hatchets. On this sub 'survivor bad' gets a shit ton of upvotes.
---
I have no idea why all start complain about Spirit just after nurse rework? I mean Spirit was in a current state for a long time, she hasn't any buffs recently. And all this time everybody was OK with her. But now everybody start to cry about spirit, why? 
---
Also, Im not a Spirit main if you think so, Im even not a killer main, (survivor main 1,4k+ hrs, red rank).
---
The **characters** stayed. Not the players
---
Just because this game can never be truly balanced doesn't mean they should give up on trying. What a horrible take.
---
Awh poor baby, god forbid a killer do what's they're supposed to.
---
I feel ya dog. I made rank 1 finally after 2 months of playing the game grinding. Between rank 3-1 was a total nightmare other than the last 2 games which were nice and easy. Since then been practicing killer and im far worse at that lol
---
I understand, but I’m saying that rank 20 - 12 is not that bad when it comes to matchmaking. I’d rather have rank 20s in green rank games than red rank games.
---
SpiderDwight cosmetic when?
---
Notably, if you can manage to get good on her on console, she is just as brutally overpowered as on PC (currently, anyway).  But the difficulty curve is even more rediculously high.
---
As is your interpretation of "voices of reason" on reddit.
---
Im a p3 claudette and i am hurt
---
Downvote harder bitch. You get harassed when you start making serious accusations.
---
Hadn’t heard that song before, nope.
---
Nothing more satisfying then a gen grab
---
PLEASE tell me this is happened
---
You know when I first seen that Jake cosmetic I was slightly upset, not only is he a character I do not play, but it looks so fucking cool!!! :((((
---
Seeing it on Nea really gets me cause she's been my girl since day one :( I NEED IT!!
---
Same.
---
Something something before it was cool
---
Being the power role doesn't mean steamrolling through every game with broken addons.
---
A Killer getting hit by 4 single use insta-heals is bad, and so is getting hit by Iri Head that they never actually run out of. Both are on the same level of bullshit. Please, for the love of god, stop justifying blatantly imbalanced mechanics because "4v1".
---
I noticed people have been doing it for about a month or two. I honestly think its cause as more people see the same killer in more games, they start to nit pick and see where they think the killer is unfair but thats just how it is sometimes. We all get frustrated, but most of us just move on with the day. Its just the ones who voice their opinions are the loudest unfortunately. But they dont speak for everybody.
---
There are only two types of people in hell, Pedophiles and the sexy children that brought them there.
---
*So, it is to be WAR between us!*
---
Spider-Man doesn't take shit from anyone!
---
Yeah lets not let people play with their friends. Thats fun. Nerfing gen speed will kill solo survivor and thus force people to play SWF.
---
You should switch fixated with solidarity ✊
---
The ones who complain don't want strong characters in the game. The reason she's played so much is not only because she's easier than Nurse but she is the only other killer apart from Nurse that can deal with all the BS from survivors. God forbid if all the other Killers were that strong. You should fear the Killer. Not be glad it's a certain killer who's shit like Bubba.
---
Oh, so it's hard to hit a single hatchet?
---
Ooooh, I see! You hate people having fun and coming up with funny scenarios! My mistake, I thought you hated the meme format or something. Funny how that works out. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
Now please, if I could make a singular request... Maybe try to tone it down a little? People enjoy having fun and making jokes and memes. There is nothing wrong with that. If you don't like it, simply hide the post. It's 2 button clicks away, as opposed to the 200+ it took you to write out this meaningless and hurtful comment of yours.
---
This kind of behaviour is the exact thing that makes people unhappy and doubt themselves. Don't do that. Making people miserable is one of the worst things a human could ever do that doesn't involve physically hurting someone or something.
---
Dude, you're a fucking asshole.
---
Dwight smiling is beyond cursed
---
I love Spirit for her lore too. She's just so great haha
---
Most games I do go up against a four man swf group, all a rank color lower than me. Maybe even sometimes in the red ranks, but that's totally fair, I guess. I understand that it'd be their fault, but alot of the times, while they'd have a designated looper, the others can loop fairly well, too, giving time to get atleast 1 or 2 gens done in that time. I don't want the game to be completely killer sided, but I also want them to fix the fact that killers can't actually kill unless survivors make mistakes. This game isn't killers kill survivors, it's more just like "Survivors fuck up, so now killer gets a hit". And they have to mess up TWICE!
---
Is that the Trick or Treat studios mask? My friend wants to dress up as pig but is unsure if he should buy it. Mask looks good
---
Lithe and dance with me?
---
As a spirit main, I think the biggest thing that needs to be changed on her is the fact that she can immediately swing after phasing. I think there should be like a .75 - 1 second delay. So many times I have just shat on people that I know have dead hard because they simply have no time whatsoever to react to it.
---
As far as quietest its ace
---
It’s what he deserves ;)
---
You’re not entitled to anything a killer does for you.
---
Thanks! He was unsure about the $60 price tag and was thinking of getting a more movie accurate one from Etsy. But with the costume it should look even better, and you’re saying it’s good quality so that’s another plus. Also, you’d be surprised about mask visibility, crazy how clear I can see out my Devil Ghost Face mask lol
---
Ah, so it's the same time as the event. I thought for some reason this was going live beforehand.
---
A solid 4 man swf can run the game. Not 4 solo survivors. I mean killers do well all the time. This might be more of a you problem.
---
Try to get Mettle of Man to activate twice after the next update.
---
Oh, that makes a lot of sense. For some reason the only "kobe" I could think of was the beef variety (which could also make sense) so that's funny
---
I think the Hex: Paranoia is a little too weak to be a Hex to be honest, it feels in the same vein as Hex: Huntress' Lullaby (which I also don't think should be a Hex, it takes ages to ramp up to 4-5 tokens as well) as it messes with audio cues and lowers your time to react (Lullaby cue delay reduction vs. Paranoia speed increase).
---
If you're paying attention it does absolutely nothing despite the penalty for the generator explosion, you can just hit the 'good' portion of the skill check bar and be okay (unless Ruin is up, which can be cleansed in and of itself, removing the issue of whether you can hit the great or not).
---
Oh you want to be a good player. Im just talking about tilting a guy to oblivion
---
Nah they moved to another camp fire.
---
In red ranks 4 man SWF are the real power role
---
To get the most out of The Rift yes you would need to complete the Killer Challenges too as they give you those Blue Tokens that can be used to purchase tiers in The Rift.
---
I think that in later tomes there may be a challenge that requires you to play Killers to get the little animatic thing and "complete" the tome but I don't think it'll be as bad as you might think. Like there are multiple challenges to do for Killer and Survivor, the Hallowed Blight situation effective forced you to say either side within the same time frame and I think iirc there was one side which was faster so that caused a severe imbalance.
---
What I think will happen is Killer mains will do their challenges then switch over, Survivor mains don't play killer so it won't be too bad IMO.
---
These get less impressive everytime
---
Anyone in normal clothes and a mask is a legion cosplay tbh
---
"Ow, my invisi-dick!' - The Wraith Probably
---
I don’t think so cause i asked them if they ever cleansed my ruin and they said no but who knows maybe you’re right and the survivor didn’t want to tell me. Really weird situation lol
---
All in a day's work.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Aaand, that's why sarcasm doesn't travel over the internet. Wasn't trying to write an angry statement, just an amused/exasperated one. Imho that movie was just too cringe compared to the hype that surrounds it.
---
ive had alot of weird incidents lately with killers seemingly ignoring or otherwise not detecting me. i try to remind myself that it's the killer's playground, not the survivors', nonetheless this could be one of those rare times he really didnt see you  
---
its possible he saw you, that nod up is saying something interesting to me. i suspect he didnt casually check both sides of the generator either
---
We need a legion with a joker mask from the movie
---
With all the damn perks.. U choose deja vu... Fokin' scary, u love it!!!
---
I really wish they won't but for a good while now (Not including the time of Nurse's Nerf) I have seen droves of Spirit hate and it was worse than the hate for Nurse and I think that says something. It's not like old legion hate, but it's certainly getting close.
---
They won't rework her just give her nerfs like reverting the non-directional phasing or something you know. Which is arguably one of her more powerful "abilities" suffice to say.
---
Prayer beads does need to go or make it Ultra Rare and make the one that makes you really fast into a Purple. Although probably remove the scratch mark condition on that Ultra Rare if you make it Purple and give it to Prayer Beads as it'd now be an Ultra Rare. People don't tall about it but even tho she doesn't make noise with Prayer Beads, grass and crows still move and if your headset is good enough you can hear her footsteps too. So there is counterplay with Prayer Beads it's just much harder and being Ultra Rare it should reflect that.
---
Also people don't talk about it but that Father-Glasses one is honestly BS, it doesn't allow for mindgames as Spirit can just follow the blood. Granted it's ultra rare but that leaves you in literally unwinnable chases pretty much so IMO that needs to go and be changed.
---
I think everything else about her is perfectly fine though.
---
I was playing a game today and tried to let the last person, who was an ace, live.  I closed the hatch, then went to look for him at the gates.  
---
Once i found him, i made the fatal mistake of downing him (hey, free points).  I smacked the gate while he wiggled free, but he ran away from me.  At that point, i stopped moving and just stood there thinking he'd run to the other gate and open it...but he didn't.  He just died out in the middle of the map.
---
0/10 no ferrets
---
I don't understand why they're designing an entire mobile game around Dead by Daylight and... The scratchmarks are still awful and don't correct the color blind issue.
---
They may have very few quest but they do have great armor and a badass leader plus I just go around killing everyone in my playthroughs so quests really don't matter to me
---
What's the point about hating the worst killer rn?
---
TRUEEEEEE
---
also in the 4th one or 5th, he gets called a child molester in a paper.
---
Good one.
---
Disagree on the Plague. Most people cant aim a consistent puke unless youre actively vaulting or something.
---
He’s definitely trash for tunneling,but it is still easier to refer to those easy loops like the window on coal tower as infinites
---
It's an instant DC from me.
---
From what I saw so far you do have to complete both the killer side and the survivor side to fully complete it, however since you have more than a month to do it, I hope it won’t break q times too much.

# FAQ
---
## What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
## Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
---
* Spreading incorrect information,
---
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
---
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
---
My only concern is if the challenges say "play as a specific character using a specific perk"
---
I have all the perks, tier 3, on 3 survivors, and 9 killers. If it's "use a specific perk" then I have characters to pick from. If it's the other, then I might not be able to do a challenge :(

Honestly, don't know if this will happen, but I love the perks tbh. I think they would be interesting to have in the game regardless

---
I didn't say they shouldn't try. But every time people complain about balance, i feel like with one true balance, this game will actually loose most of it's charm.

I never complain about slugging. It just activates my trap card.
---
I was not expecting black silk boxers. Fancy.
---
I'm pretty sure the vials are only early on in the free pass but we won't know until it comes out
---
I feel your pain dude. Out of 6 games only 1 ended with more then 8k bp due to the killer either being mega sweat or just dc's shortly after it starts. My solution is just play a rank 1 character and don't run any perks. That way you're more likely to de-pip into more chill matches and it's a new fun way of challenging yourself
---
Nope I played with 1 buddy, other two were randoms

---
Lol this clown so mad about what people think of fictional characters he made a whole FAQ about downvoting them. 
---
Must be a killer main, Prayer Beads Spirit or Insidious Leatherface. Could also be a survivor main, either flashlight Blendette or pink-haired Nea. It's ok, you don't have to confirm u/21stdeadcats, everyone who read this far already knows true.
---
Oh no, I feel your copy/pasted downvoting FAQ incoming, however will I sleep tonight?
---
Even then, having a sexual desire, no matter how horrible, isn’t grounds to arrest.
---
Nope its a new glitch and hex totems straight up dont spawn
---
Doesn't look very hellraiser. Potential loot box tests?
---
There are a few bugs to be worked out, but overall the experience is much better.
---
Went from having to hop game to game looking for anything under 250ms ping to 82ms on the dot every game. It makes for a much, much better experience.
---
Gotta keep that equipment clean at all times, even if it’s filled with pure sweat from that Claudette
---
Well he agreed with them and then immediately said exactly the opposite of what he just agreed with.
---
What's the change?
---
But what would a DBD loot box be exactly?
---
You might want to rethink the leave/DC to depip strategy with the implementation of dedicated servers. Now they will be able to track unusual spikes of DCing/leaving games and act accordingly (not sure if this is on all platforms, but I know it’s on PC). The better solution is to use the games in the high ranks with the goal of practicing over winning. For instance, decide one game that you’ll all work on communication skills and use the match to develop call outs. Or choose one game to practice using flashlights or keys. That way, you’ll eventually practice enough to the point where you guys are fine at high ranks
---
Does undetectable make Spine Chill not work?  That's really my main problem when I play stealth killers/play against them.  Spine Chill makes it too easy to invalidate them sneaking.  It needs to bypass Spine Chill to be truly good.

---
I supose Myers, he doesn't have that many weird abilities like other killers and if he catches you he dispatches you quickly.
---
on the other hand guys like Freddy or Herman take special pleassure in torturing their victims. and if you think about it, outside the game mechanics. Freddy is really powerful in his realm, he is one of those villains who get defeated because the story calls for it, but in a real scenario would be unstoappable. and the doctor madness would really screw you  as you would see and hear shit isn't there.

yeah, i got what you were saying. but you also wouldn't say something like that if you didn't already think you were special. both are true here. you think you're special because you let killers bleed you out, and you think he's a snowflake just because he doesn't.
---
So forcing you into entirely different playstyle is a bad thing? People been asking for something refreshing for ages. Red addons spice the game up a little bit, to be this refreshing horror mode. Nothing toxic or assholish about this.
---
Takes a whole new meaning to you look like a pig
---
Seriously tho i dont tho i dont think ive been more attracted to a killer than now
---
Literally the post above this the OP said that he was making a joke and he said it aggressively and I think there were two “found the survivor main” comments. This community is the most hypocritical, blind, and trigger-happy for the “word” toxic I’ve ever seen.
---
Calls people losers for having fun making jokes
---
Throws bitch fit on Reddit over said jokes
---
You're indeed the real pathetic loser here for getting mad at literally nothing. Grow up
---
When ever you see a Jane with the bra and skirt cosmetic on at the same time.
---
It's paedophilia... Which is very much an arrestable offence...
---
I don’t ship Myers with Susie
---
Remove its ability to open the hatch, add its ability to reveal all nearby players to the base item.
---
Yeah if someone unhooks literally before I have the chance to walk away from the hook, I let the poor fucked that was just unhooked go and go after the unhooked....unless the group of survivors are being toxic, then i definitely punish the group for their shitty decisions
---
I have 11k shards. Should I buy legion, plague, or does anyone recommend anything in the shrine this month.
---
Ah okay, from what I saw there was a full path for survivor to complete the tome. Guess you do need to play killer too
---
With "hard skillcheck builds" you dont have to hit great, but only good skill checks, which is damn easy. Also, a lotta people dont really care about ruin that much,they do hit great skill checks only, or at least 9 out of 10 times. Another effect of ruin is that you dont get bonus progression when hitting great skillchecks, which can make a difference in a game. Most people however are just fricking uncreative and run the usual meta perkbuild on every killer and dont even think about what perks would be best, so thats why they take ruin,which is a damn shame cause its getting boring. Whenever I see a streamer run the meta build I instantly watch someone else,more creative.
---
A definition doesn’t change based on whether or not it affects someone. You just think that killers dodging lobbies is worse because it affects someone. 
---
Sure but in DbD dodging lobbies is not some new word separate from the rest of the world. Survivors dodge lobbies. What the Fuck would you call it?
---
And who is possessing child porn?
---
That's all folks is the tagline from Looney tunes when the show's over. Us being stuck there caused the game to end, hence the title
---
I don’t know if you know this bud. But the level is directly above their heads. Basic math can do the rest.
---
Perfect.
---
I know the other guys explained it but basically, the nurse is very  difficult to master and consoles run at a lower frame rate so she's even harder to use.
---
This is fucking amazing
---
I made this because on another post I kept getting called a killer main for memeing things that mostly affect survivors but it looked to “killer sided”.. meh. Sometimes I swear it’s the entity doing this to feed off of the anger and hate.
---
Rank literally means jack shit. If you're going based off rank, you clearly know even less than I was assuming. Next you're going to tell me players loading in together means SWF even thought they made it months back where people load in together regardless.
---
/s
---
&gt; just give a cooldown for quitting. 20 minutes for 1st quit 2,5 hours for 2nd quit, 1 day for 3rd quit, 2 weeks for 10th quit
---
I agree, but how long until it resets back to 20 minutes?
---
The green headed duck? Thats what he's looking at on his tablet...? As I said, in the original its a picture of a chick, which in the context is child porn.
---
? I didn't say anything dramatic, just facts
---
Including the part aboutmy preature ejaculation
---
I guess when I played killer yesterday and people joined sporadically I have some magic different copy of DbD than everyone else?
---
Yesterday I consciously set thet build for a match, i zoned out and didnt really thought about what I was choosing, then when I loaded, in the middle of the match or so I didnt understand why I couldnt heal, I was really tired of listening to moans, until my dead teammate commented on my meta build as observer. I hadnt felt this stupid in a very long time.
---
Removing the leave game option would be complete bs for those who actually need to leave the game. Those punishments are way too harsh
---
What is the point if removing them? What does that accomplish?
---
Mmm. I don’t think you’re reading the meme right man
---
"good killer" I'ma mori you first for that
---
It's charm surely isn't disgustingly broken add-ons. They ruin the game for one side no matter how they're used.
---
I don't see why anyone would laugh at that.
---
10/10 tummy, would def get reverse beartrapped by you
---
I mean, it more depends on if you're terrible. It's not hard to hit a hatchet eventually, pair it with Infantry Belt and you're guaranteed a hit if you're not smooth in the brain.
---
It’s uh... meme......
---
Phew
---
Hatch could close immediately after that person uses it. But then that would prevent anyone getting from getting the achievement.
---
DADDY GOT CAKE THO
---
What's 10mins though? I'd go watch a youtube video and come back. If someone is gonna rage quit *mutilate* times *a day* then why play?
---
1st 10min
---
2nd 25min
---
3rd 45min (minimum)
---
Its heavily implied in the first movie but never said directly. My guess it was to help with the stricked rating system at the time
---
Movie about a demon killing people? That's fine
---
A movie about a demon pedophile taking revenge on the kids that ratted him out? That's a no
---
Nearly every game I had the other day someone d/c in the first two minutes
---
The devs are creative they could work something out. Tomorrow I might make some ideas. He's a lot more interesting that you might think. As for the real life serial killer rule, I strongly believe Jack is excused from that. Identity V and Assassin's Creed Syndicate opened my eyes to the fact that Ripper could be made as a playable character brilliantly with fans loving the devs for letting us play as Jack. DBD is no exception to this.
---
I wish you were capable of engaging in a discussion with someone you disagreed with... without calling them a child.
---
Wait I thought Dwight didn't have one also? Or did I miss something
---
I would use Iron Will instead of Adrenaline but it’s your own choice really.
---
He been institutionalized for most of his life he ain’t got no gym
---
Same, sometimes the survivors are still working on them...
---
Yes it works like that
---
Alright, I'm not saying it's hard and I'm also not questioning anyones intelligence when it comes to this. If you can consistently land hatchets, you're probably a good Huntress. Never said it was easy or hard.
---
Yup just what i expected. Keep being a dick on the Internet and copy pasting the same shit. What a fucking ass
---
I can hear this image
---
I almost thought this was real. ALMOST. very well made.
---
Bloody hell, I thought I was high when I saw Spider-Man, but fortunately or not, I'm not high. This was absolutely amazing.

8 P3 claudettes in the same lobby
---
There should definitely be a ban for about 15 minutes for DCing.
---
Well they are creative they could be creative with any concept so i would say there needs to be a more specific power concept for it to even be worth considering
---
And while there are some great games that utilize jack the ripper in either the protagonist or antagonist roles to great effect that doesn’t mean he would be a great fit for dead by daylight.
---
Hello there
---
be sure to report them for this if you haven't already
---
"Feeling cute, might chase some survivors later"
---
My god....the cheeks.
---
That's a good one.
---
Kinda like what I've done at Valentines Day, I'll bring in items with cool add ons and leave it in front of a survivor. If they pick it up then they're me Valentine.
---
Ouch, Feelsbad man. I’d be lying if I said I was surprised by that in the slightest.
---
Agent Claudette !
---
David and Jeff are 100% the best. Not default Davids though. They’ll just farm you for stax.
---
Nothing really wrong with it, only really should change it if there is a specific difficulty you are running into
---
Guys don't worry he is running self care witt botany so it's ok
---
Iron Will is a better choice in red rank
---
I want you to play a SWF with 3 other players and a random killer who has an instadown addon in their inventory, play 10 games, and have the killer randomly choose when to use said addon and you will see why I mean that it's bullshit.
---
I am going to assume you play the game not at all if you don't agree because you can't be this stupid on this. It's obviously toxic, it's obviously OP, and it's obviously bullshit, there isn't an excuse on the planet that can make instadown addons OK and the same was said for instaheals.  It isn't playing a different playstyle, it is playing the game slow as molasses and if you get seen you die, you have to ENTIRELY change EVERY aspect of how you play the game for a far slower, FAR worse experience that nobody has fun in.
---
Yes, it's assholish and toxic, get over it.
---
I showed you my Tier 3 please respond
---
I'm pretty sure you have to be over the age of 18 to make a reddit account.
---
I mean gen rushing isn’t a thing, but noed is still a valid perk. It’s no different than running rancor or bloowarden, just endgame focus. Plus cleansing totems not only avoids noed but gives you extra points so. 
---
And “crutch perks”? Lmao y’all really be acting like all the perks aren’t a crutch in one way or another? Run a few games perkless and see how you do.
---
Omg it's a puzzle box.
---
That's some talent.
---
I think that you shouldn't change anything until you find that a perk rarely gets its use, or if you become bored with it and want to change things up
---
He has one, from last year with claudette :)
---
If you're playing SWF then you don't need bond.
---
If you play solo queue then  SC/medkits might good to have because teammates might not heal you.
---
Lol f’ing gg
---
Yeah I plan to create one tomorrow. I just wanted a few people's thoughts on the concept of the actual character.
---
There were antagonist roles every time for Jack. He had a very cool assumed look to him- the shadowy figure with a top hat. 
---
Jack the Ripper is like an old school slasher. He is the boogeyman of old English horror and criminology. He would fit perfectly into DBD and it's horror vibes.
---
Its all good. I've had my fun with nurse. I don't play her as much as I once did.
---
I must be blind or something because I have never seen it
---
Damn bro 3 people care with decent suggestions and got downvoted to oblivion wtf xD
---
Ah you see I wasnt sure what to do with that. One friend told me no good advice, the other one said it's a bad joke, so I posted it here to see how wrong he was
---
Freddy is refinery A+
---
Probably just a new killer they dont know that sometimes it's better to break chase with a survivor
---
Yeah i would have to see a concept that actually has a power for him, not necessarily opposed to him being a killer but i also don’t see any inherent value to jack over a original killer
---
Yes. What about 2nd and 3rd or more dc's?
---
So hot
---
For me every time it just shanks the survivor in the back without grabbing
---
True. They gotta be the shirtless ones
---
they state 100K times already that spine chill will keep working . It will counter Aura reading abiliies tho
---
As a disabled gamer, I find this offensive.
---
Whispers over ruin or noed.
---
Ahem... Peter tingles.
---
That's what they're doing in the lockers
---
Learn to run while looking at the killer, keep track of when and where the killer loses line of sight and make sure you time how long it would take him to reach the point of line of sight again, this keeps you safe from mindgames, allows you to be annoying at every pallet and exploit something that's been in the game since day 1-
---
Survivors are fucking overpowered as shit.
---
sigh *unzip*
---
very nice :P go for it..
---
&gt; And slugging ain't a bad thing kids
---
Depending on the killer &amp; perks it's quite a gamble as well, all your work can be undone by one survivor vs hook states are permanently gone :)
---
if there are no save key addons in bloodweb, we'll see less keys in a long run. People will spend more keys and use them less often. even if you have 80 you'll eventually run out of them if you're active key user
---
Aren't all the killer/ survivor ratings pretty subjective to the point that they don't really matter?
---
Like Hillbilly is rated as easy while Wraith is intermediate.. Sorry, but how is learning to control that chainsaw easier than learning to click a button to switch between cloaked and uncloaked? lol
---
Legion: just in case you wanted the feeling of dead harding into a wall, but as the killer
---
Welp since the nurse nerf was a nice change, she still top tier but requires skill and can fuck up now.
---
Maybe they can work on buffing the living shit out of other killers that really need it.
---
Rework them so that they only allow the key holder to escape. Also add an add-on for the key which allows the hatch to stay open for 30 seconds to allow other survivors inside (for achievement). Make that add-on ultra rare. And make it so using that add-on consumes the key when the hatch is opened.
---
Keys are powerful but they should be selfish items imo. But there's an achievement for getting your buddies out and I think an ultra-rare add on would be the best idea.
---
That doesn’t make any sense.
---
I know, RIGHT??
---
Different strokes for different folks. For me, even a a standalone film, unconnected to the Batman series, it was an okay one at best. It takes a lot from The Machinist, but is also too in love with its own stylised cinematography to create realistic looking shots that would invoke genuine emotion. Felt like a candy wrapper without the candy, which was upsetting considering how much people are praising it.
---
Also, that's a surprising amount of downvotes. Just because I didn't like a movie? It's simply what I thought after seeing it, not an attempt to break any Joker-loving hearts on my part. You're free to enjoy what you enjoy, I'm not judging. Just let me have my opinions too &lt;3
---
Mildly annoyed he isn’t carrying his bat.
---
I said I would do it
---
Yeah, this post is about OoO hard countering stealth killers like Ghostface when he came out.
---
You can still use Spine Chill to detect them when they are close, but you won't be seeing them from half across de map anymore.
---
Awesome post dude! Loved it!
---
Dead by french
---
^Google  ^translate  ^is  ^not  ^an  ^escape
---
Discordance is arguably the best legion perk and legion is a bit of a bad spot atm (he can still be fun to play as tho) so I’d recommend buying that perk unless you really want to play legion. Plague is way better than legion and has one decent perk like the legion. You could also spend those shards on cosmetics if any of your fav killers or survivors have any available, hope I could help.
---
**Evil Withunderwear**
---
I think dbd should probably stick to fictional killers
---
Feng has that gamer one coming up then she has that kick-ass demon skin contest winner whenever that is
---
Bro it’s not that bad. Why do people act like she’s gotten seriously taken down.
---
Oh no she kills people 0.1 seconds slower.
---
I'm disappointed Dwight didn't get any Entity's baby juice on him :/
---
I'm glad ghost face is in a pretty solid spot right now.
---
i love hobo jake
---
I don’t think so.
---
K
---
Ah so there will be this event called Withered blight like the one last year 
---
Basically as you go through the rift you get this item called serum. You can use it to buy the new cosmetics for free like the clown one jake spirit etc
---
If you get all the serum you can buy 6 items aka 2 full outfits for free
---
More info will be shown ingame at the time!
---
So true it hurts! :(
---
Also worth playing killer a bit to learn from survivors directly. I’ve learned a fair few tricks about juking mostly from it happening to me
---
Sucks to suck
---
My typical stealth loadout is iron will, calm spirit, premonition, and self-care, but the latter two are kind of just personal preference more than stealth. (Calm spirit is great for killers like doctor bc he can’t use shock to detect you, not to mention crows.) I almost always play jake, but (and forgive me for saying this) claudette is also a good option since she’s harder to see. (Be warned that she may get you tunneled more bc of her reputation.)
---
Spine chill is a good choice, and I’ve found urban evasion to be less essential for stealth and more about speed, but it depends on how you play. I’d also recommend whatever that perk is that feng has that makes repairs quieter, as well as trying dance with me. 
---
You just kind of gotta play around with it and see which perks you like best.
---
Bread is not an escape
---
That was me!
---
Micheal is actually getting a hospital gown and 3 weapons. But yea Freddy and Leatherface definitely need skins, also pretty decent ideas.
---
Mort à la lumière du jour. La mort n'est pas une issue.
---
r/confusedboner
---
Yes, it's OP, but no, it is not toxic. I have over 3k hours on this game and play almost daily both survivor and killer and i actually very much enjoy challenges against red addons. I win rarely, but winning is not a primal factor for me to have fun. And fun is a very subjective point of discussion.
---
Those dedicated servers man... I've also been glitching all over the map, but never like this.
---
i have no idea honestly, probably from just doing the archive challenges or instantly unlocking it via the battle pass i guess

Agreed. Terribly annoyed me today when all of the survivors were at the gate about to escape from ghost face and he dcs... lol. Ty mrbpotato
---
oof because i just bought claudette vigo’s apprentice so..
---
Seriously. If you really need to be playing Dead By Daylight this consistently that you need it on a Mobile Phone, you might need to take a break from the game lmao.
---
It’s a cool concept, but I can’t see this taking off in any direction. It’s gonna bomb. The graphics look awful, the controls look terrible, the Killer is going to be SO bullied in that version of the game.
---
Moris keys instameds are all fine to use. People need to get a grip.
---
And then you still didn’t answer the question.... lmao.
---
This question was asked many times when GF came out and people believed it's from his knife, but the knife has no such handle. It's probably some clipping texture or he was/is married. 
---
I already wrote a fiction with this backstory for him... If that turns to be right I'm going to show it to BHVR :))
---
First, I speak proper English, it's a you problem if you can't understand
---
Second, no. It's not how it works dude.. are you literally 15? Not even joking. I even draw an example for you and still not understand that. You can't be this ignorant
---
No he's a snowflake because he DC. I would call anyone who DC because things don't go their way a snowflake with a paper thin skin. You try to strawman me but you can't even do that
---
You're really pathetic tbh if you attack me by using a strawman this weak..
---
Thanks for posting on Reddit, Very cool Kanye!
---
Dang! This is the trick or treat studio's one? Impressive, I was gunna get it but didn't like the look of it all that much cause of the hair and neck lol but this may have changed my mind
---
Is it just me or are survivors getting more toxic? Like he DC'd first down so I called him out on it but then acts like I'm the bad guy for him ruining the game.
---
Yeah, I can imagine how difficult that must be with a joystick.
---

Oh ok that sounds cool the costumes are nice too so it’s worth it

Map Pressure is a huge deal in terms of power. Having all those traps to teleport to both Generator AND Exit Gates is super fucking good.

It’s a wraith, he didn’t even have NoED pipe the fuck down lmao
---
Blocked btw
---
knowing when they're looking at you from a36 meters distance isn't the same as seeing their aura from the other side of the map though
---
I love when devs retcon or tie anything stupid to the entity.When they released plague they said "the entity is merging realms" for the map,which is a fancier way for saying "we got lazy to make a whole new map"
---
Julie is literally the worst legion member don't @ me

Honestly if you pair it with Bloodhound, it just makes you impossible to lose in a chase. Extra Points if you use Sloppy Butcher. Useful for putting healthy people to sleep.

the joke is he's wasting two Iridescent addons and an ebony mori at rank 19, I could care less how OP his build was. Btw NOED's ass lul

Lol luckily I stopped running selfcare around rank 7 -8😂
---
Yeah started happening every like 10 or so games says something like “unknown error has occurred” then goes in to a endless searching for match till I reset. Only happens on survivor from what iv seen
---
“Wasting”
---
Google Autocorrect; Did you mean: “Using?”
---
I'm just messing with you lol. But most of the time it is the p3 Claudette crouching around the map and selfcaring in corners, even in red ranks sadly. Obviously there are some exceptions like yourself lol
---
The very first line "its heavily implies but never mentioned directly"
---
Ah oui, mieux xD
---
It makes you realize how strong certain building layouts really are.
---
oh yeah I forgot about that
---
Poised can cone in clutch though
---
Pair with Empathy for a very altruistic build. Maybe Adrenaline, Buckle Up, or just Self Care
---
no its the engine used to render these.. i usually do these on cycles which is a path tracer and has more realistic shading but takes 10-15 mins per frame .. with eevee its a realtime engine can do these in few secs but less accurate lighting.
---
I love Plague and Spirit's theme, same with GF, instant classic is the lowet tier for me. But I agree that Clown's theme is the only thing that's OP about him.
---
Well the next chapter doesn't have map and  I assume it won't have survivor either. So it's likely that the killer will be Cenobites as there's no memorable survivor from the Hellraiser series.
---
I'm waiting for Frank \* \_\_ \* Hope you have one &lt;3
---
It gives you emblem points which goes towards pipping. I'd call it secondary objective if it helps to pip since how BHVR designed the game after the emblem system, doesn't matter if you live or die kill or not but if you pip so it's an objective.
---
Improve totems positions is necessary since often it's literally next to a gen or in the open which is bs if you have any hex to be that easy to spot and actually deny a perk slot
---
It's expected to find every totems or most of them because it's very easy to do so. If you have a decent knowledge about the maps and the game in general, you know already where they are or probably are, by knowing the map.
---
Your whole argument show to me you have little to no knowledge about the game. I might be wrong but that's what it looks like when you say things like that
---
REMOVE HOOK VACUUM!!
---
Explanation. This is what devs have to do to have full body awareness for a 1st person camera. Deform and stretch the model to make it look nice in 1st person while keeping it from clipping into view.
---
All Killers have something like this done. You can somewhat see it for yourself at any time as well. Just look at your shadow on a bright map like Lerry's or The Game.

I love the Hag's new feral frenzy power after you hit someone lmao
---
Yeah, killer mains are largely overinflating the power of keys. Just play both sides and spam ebony moris and keys and you'll see how a key is a rarely successful crutch when an ebony consistently steals games. 
---
The terrifying "whole swf goes down the hatch" must be what, one out of 1000 games ? 5000 ? I'd love to have some stats.
---
Totally agree, I think that there's no a good way to buff him. You can easily make him OP, but from the other hand you can just throw pallets, there's so many of them... If people jut do gens and don;t fck around he has no chance, so I agree that rework would be the best.
---
But tbh I think Doctor needs help even more.
---
True, they probably do care more about ratings and sellimg more copies to a wider audience which sucks :( cause this game has potential to be better imo if it could be more graphic
---
They ask for any support if video or picture evidence so I don't think they keep their own.
---
So.. when 3 gens are popped after 1 chase that take around 1 min since gens are done in 80s and the time to pick up, go to the hook and hook is about that time. That's not genrush? It is
---
Is it wrong? No, is it Survivor fault? No. It's BHVR fault that they haven't even tried to find another objective to survivors that's not just hold one button, which in itself is boring af
---
Genrush is a real thing but many survivors, and also you I guess, think it's a personal attack. No, they are doing the gens efficiently but when you play this game efficiently, games fly quick
---
Marth88 proved this several times, if survivors play efficiently, not even an omegablink nurse can't do much about it. Maybe get 1 kill or 2, but that's it, with broken add ons and the best killer in the game mind you
---
That is legitness
---
Ho-how did you know my fetich was exposed belly????
---
Well, I can see why they use NOED.
---
I think cannot be done due to poor programming/engine
---
No, the purple one can open the hatch too. Green is the only one that cannot.
---
This is why I casually play at like rank 12 lol, fuck purple/green+
---
It's more about the connection between survivor and killer, I've had games like this where i can literally run circles around the killer and i've had games where one particular survivor was extremely hard to hit. I don't recall there being more than one survivor but it's certainly rooted in  Internet Connection
---
I can confirm as well, did it on PS4.
---
This tier list is so bad yikes
---
The rating are so dumb
---
Just the fact that every survivors too have ratings it's hilarious. Ignore it, especially when devs have no idea how people play 90% of the time, so..
---
Ah okay. I personally don’t take issue with it, but noticed that the suggestions with 20 downvotes (for the most part) were attempting to come up with reasonable nerfs. As a surv, I almost never use keys (mostly cuz I thought they were “broken” til pink)
---
Same 😒
---
... In one?
---
tbh there's absolutely no reason for the exposed belly and makes no sense. Only thing it does is give these high amount of oversexualizing comments. Suppose that's what some people want 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
The rating is based on their perks not the ability. Enduring/lightborn helps you not get punished as hard and tinkerer helps you find the survivor.
---
Wraith has a simplier power but perks are garbage, scratch marks even as a new player are pretty intuitive to where they went, FOV change is nice and his only good new player perk but would be a crutch to start on and new players barely look at bloodstains anyway so its a learning tool. Basically nothing to help you out that you wouldn't get by playing another killer. Billys stun reduction at minimum makes him easier to play to start with
---
''We get it: You're gay
---
You're nothing special''
---
"Experienced Killers"
---
NOED
---
*disappoint*
---
I definitely agree with you in that one. Dull and Skeleton keys activate when gens are done/survivors get sacrifiiced, and the person actually has to find it without the noise it makes. When you equip a key, the chances of using it are so low in an average game, that there are addons that help you keep it when you die. 
---
On the other hand, moris can be used in pretty much any game, well unless you have the cypress mori and everybody escapes.
---
Oh I thought just the survivors were rated off of their perks while the killers were rated off of how easy it is to learn their ability.. my bad.
---
I can't make that unseen now
---
ooof your post is glitching and is getting posted multiple times
---
it only lasts for 60 seconds. and you can slug? i don't understand this comment
---
wow this is very high quality meme

Prestige 3 basically after leveling a character up to level 50 you can set them back to zero in exchange for a free bloody cosmetic you can do this up to three times per character, it is usually used as a status symbol and can have different meanings depending on what character you prestige for example P3 Claudette or Nae are usually stereotyped as toxic.

hell no
---
If you mori with this killer your entire house crashes
---
Healing has been slow as fuck anyway and medkits didnt do a whole lot to speed it up. They are pretty much only used to heal yourself at the moment, people rarely medkit heal others because its just not worth the charges for a very marginal speed increase. Plus insta heals were nerfed too, so itll be better on both ends.
---
Yeah, a David did this once when I was playing as Jake.  It was in the mid of the game though.  Much appreciated, Dave!
---
worse than rank 20 lmao
---
The point is you can do whatever the fuck you want for that 60 seconds including staying on a gen in front of the killer or sandbagging to a hook to rescue someone and playing recklessly and dumb with zero punishment because of a dumb skill check. If it’s truly an anti tunnel perk he should go get healed, the killer isn’t chasing them, instead he sits on a gen and if the killer pulls him off he gets dsed. Killer isn’t tunneling. Survivor is playing badly because he knows he can.
---
Doctor is kinda a hit or miss for me. I never did bad with him, but meh.. he has by far the most fun addons for sure
---
Time to make Legion good again
---
if he stays on the gen you can definitely slug? all you have to do is back up... and lunge. do YOU even play at high ranks????
---
just go after the unhooker... im assuming that's what the wraith is doing here. ds really shouldn't be causing you so much of a problem.
---
Nice one.
---
I played a game there as killer, and got 40,000 and never killer anyone! But when I kill all 4 my blood points are less than half. Why is that? 
---
My points were , b 4400, d 6016, hunter 6922, sacrifice 2100, I played as the hag
---
That’s skillful tbh annoying yes but hard to pull off and a sabo god is busy saboing and running around ready to save to do gens which is a good thing
---
As someone who mostly plays Killer, Spirit is one of the least fair killers I can think of. At least Nurse requires a bit of practice, but all you need is headphones and a couple of brain cells to play Spirit properly. 
---
Still, I somewhat agree with you that nerfing her first might not be the best idea. I'd rather them buff the worst killers first, otherwise if they nerf Spirit into the ground everyone will just jump to Billy and the cycle will repeat ad nauseum.
---
So I saw! Thank you kind stranger I've gotten rid of the others
---
Me: plays SWF 4X insta heals, Borrowed time, unbreakable, DS, adrenaline, keys.
---
Killer: stop being so toxic to killers who can’t keep up with all the second chance perks and items survivors have.
---
Me: *plays solo survivor with no items or meta perks* Prayer beads, ebony mori, 1 hit hatchets, tunnel, camp
---
Killer: gg ez baby survivors
---
Me: I- ..... *goes right back to SWF*
---
Now I could do the same thing with your paragraph, but i'm sure you already get what i'm going for here.
---
I'm sure they don't care that much to come looking for you, your good lol
---
It was made with the idea of dream world in which they did get the rights for the character. BHVR did seem quite enthusiastic with that “nothing’s too big for us” statement, so maybe one day.
---
Tunnel the guy doing that. Seriously, as soon as I see a Jake going for the sabotage I drop my victim and get him. Its not just because he's annoying, its just that if he's good he'll keep doing it
---
I just feel bad when I dc. I couldn’t message them afterwards to apologize so I was kinda hoping one of them might see it here.
---
It was a long shot but I feel guilty when I do that. I feel like I wasted their time
---
Can someone please explain how keys are overpowered?
---
I have only been able to get them to be useful a handful of times.
---
That’s not toxic that sounds like you’re either new to the game, the survivor your faced is much more experienced, bad map, or the killer you chose can’t handle a good looper. 
---
If you get one of those though it is better to chase someone else who is hopefully easier to down and doesn’t know where pallets have been used already and catch them off guard
---
could not relate to a post any more.
---
Camping for no reason/tunneling extra hard (for no reason)obviously, Tbagging and clicking. Everything else is just annoying, but game mechanics so you can't really do anything about it (flashlights, insta heals, keys, iridescent..)
---
*That Plague daily...*
---
The photo at the end lol
---
I get that and it’s a never ending cycle for both sides. However I run solo survivor que and no matter how painful it is I do find that more challenging and skillful then a brain dead swf with every out in the game.
---
Okay. What's stoping them from afking or dying on hook then? 
---
Nothing. And both of those have the same effect of hindering the team. You can't force someone to play out a match that they don't want to play, giving them penalties won't do as much as you believe that it will. 
---
Maybe we should try balancing the game instead to keep the player base happy and encourage people to keep playing. In fact, the devs are working on that now!
---
Spirit: What are you doing up there!
---
Spidey: Staying away from you! Those are cute scars, did your father give those to you?
---
Spirit: 🥺
---
And if you play survivor at all, David and Dwight both have perks that increase bloodpoint gains.
---
I can see why :D but i just lovved that if you just missed that skill check by 0.1 second you would end up dead but u did it. Did you unhook yourself before that?
---
Oh also my point was more just how people treat people afterwards or during (teabagging and bming) or people who will go out of their way to go to persons profile or stream to shit talk them after a game like that. Just a huge yikes overall.
---
Looking damn good to me 👍
---
We call this feature ‚bond‘
---
If you have short games even if you kill everyone fast you get less because everything you do in game gives you points. If survivors are putting up good chases you’ll get lots f chase points destruction points from pallets etc 
---
You benefit from hooking and smacking everyone lots of times rather then just getting them once and them dying on their first hook. You can even depip if you kill them too fast.
---
I dont see anything as toxic, i dont give a fuck what people do to enjoy the game
---
But it's still not balanced and they nerfed Nurse, ONE of the TWO viable Killers vs all the survivor BS. Now it's looking like Spirit is better and will probably be the most played Killer in Red Ranks now.
---
This is fine right? So good, so balanced. 
---
"Give me more" says the braindead Survivor Sympathiser.
---
I don’t mind that too much, I can counter that with good movement. I can’t counter her having strider even though I ran iron will.
---
Spiderman perk set
---
Blood web:
---
 When in the killers terror radius but out of chase, use the action button to pull a pallet you are looking at from a distance of up to 10 meters. This causes the exhausted effect.
---
Arachnophobia:
---
When within 16 meters of the killer, the killer receives a 20% slow down to breaking pallets, generators and searching lockers. Up to a maximum of 60 seconds
---
Spidey senses:
---
Once you have made a safe rescue the perk will activate. When in chase if the killer gets a hit, you will automatically Dodge and avoid damage. This perk can only be used once.
---
FYI This is obviously a joke post, please don't talk about balance XD
---
poor killer needs to learn how to swing instead of lunge lol
---
The whole game is a waste of time, It's only purpose is fun - If your not having fun then dcing is no time wasted.
---
There you go.
---
Lol!  What an intelligent counterpoint to the very valid points I brought up.  Got it, you're either trolling or just very very terrible at killer still.  If it's the former sad man, just sad...if it's the latter still sad but definitely fixable.  Watch some YouTube vids to learn how to play optimal killer games.  Not Otzdarva and Truetalent can teach you a lot.  I'd start there.

---
I'm going to be the buzz killer (bee killer confirmed btw), but as a french dude who spent a lot of time in Paris, this is a bit exaggerated. But only a bit, as millions of frenchies buy their baguette everyday and you can indeed see a lot of baguettes in the streets. 
---
It's just that Paris smells more of piss than croissants, sadly.
---
Thanks for the advice, appreciated. I’ve not long started playing but it’s been good fun. Takes a whole to get games sadly
---
I agree that people shouldn't be toxic to anyone, but being in an SWF and using the best perks/ items isn't really toxic just like playing a meta killer with strong perks and add ons isn't toxic.
---
Not very fun? Sure, but not toxic.
---
Yeh it sucks. I'm rank 4 survivor so it's not exactly low ranks like you would perhaps expect
---
Camping and tunneling isn’t toxic. Killers are meant to kill survivors. Camping and tunneling are strategies some killers use to achieve this goal. Camping isn’t an effective strategy. And it sucks to be tunneled, but it’s not toxic
---
Haha 😂
---
As I David main I can com firm I've never done this. :(
---
For me she's scary, which makes her fun to face.
---
Survivors are just skins, and I don't run blend shit lmao. Nice one

---

---
The collab we never knew we needed
---
I think you’re camping and wasting time which allows survivors to escape, because 17k is not normal. Even if all survivors escape you should be getting at least 25-30k. Go for hooks on all different survivors, hit as many as you can, use your ability, don’t chase survivors for too long, knkw when to leave a chance and find someone else
---
I think my best advice is to stop playing the game for a week. You need to chillax.
---
And everyone believes that for sure.

---
Legit as in "op as fuck".

Sadly they changing Instagram heals

Tbag happened
---
Oh a big boy with big numbers assuming things without any proof behind things. We have a internet winner here boys and girls
---
Bro someone said you get it from the archives like 5 times. Wait until the update and get it then ffs.
---
No that's not remotely toxic it's just bad strategy.  You said you're new though so it is totally cool and understandable.  Basically you never want to chase the same survivor that long it let's the others pop the gens uninterrupted.  You want to break off the chases you can't end efficiently.  Also if you're struggling this much with tracking you might want to run Bloodhound.  Nurses Calling is good too since you can see them healing if they manage to lose you.
---
Cry me a river, someone pressed ctrl in an exit gate.
---
Seconded
---
Goddam  that's spooky. Great job!
---
Course they dont
---
this made me actually lol, but I feel like Nancy would def say “occupied” tbh
---
Yeah and how often do you play against killer with moris? Lets be honest, killers only mori with devour hope or when a new killer comes out. Thats probably the reason why they didnt nerf moris yet. Its also impossible to nerf a mori to something that wont be total dogshit
---
Here’s my assumption; once the mid-chapter patch is out in two weeks, every week on Wednesday for four weeks we’ll get a new collection of the licensed cosmetics. Normally one collection launches WITH the chapter/mid-chapter (Upside Down Collection for ST, Priestess of the Damned for Freddy rework, Demon GF for GF’s chapter)- however, since the Rift will launch with a shit ton of cosmetics in it, I think the first collection will be out a week later than usual.
---
Yes they do, Joey got the Legions’ first new skin being that Neon one
---
Great! Sounds sort of like a lament at the beginning, really nice
---
If you think a one off one state heal (or even full heal(pink)) is op, especially considering they have to have a medkit and the add on from the start of the game- I just have to assume you’re butthurt from the only one you almost killed in a match getting away due to insta heal.   Which, yeah that’s frustrating, but they just happened to use it right
---
Oh stfu you earlier called iron will "a crutch"
---
Meh seems like you have 50 games as killer once you main killer. You’ll know how it feels when they’re at exit gate and tbag and you be like gtfo already. 😁
---
I haven't watched "Stranger things" yet, I should've put Steve and Nancy in this tier without knowing them at least a bit, but thought "Why not, maybe it will be good"
---
Zapclaw
---
I mean I literally have close to 4k hours split evenly between survivor and killer but I wouldn't know what it's like to have someone tbag in an exit gate considering they rarely even get 2 gens done. Sucks to suck, buddy.
---
I'm a Killer main, and I hate survivors with all my heart but sorry, it is. The game should have a built in BT no matter what. Imagine this, a survivor unhooks you and immediatelly the killer comes in, down you and you either have DS or its over. But then again who doesn't have ds? And ds is op for that reason only. Its a toxic thing because the game allows it to be like that, and unless its actually a strategy that will win the game/you find the same survivor by chance and he messes up, then its ok. Otherwise, it sucks
---
That is one girthy knife.
---
I must say i do think your Steve placement was spot on though
---
Never had a game where one escapes and tbags? Hmmm you must be the best. Why don’t you stream? I would gladly subscribe to your channel.
---
Depends. If your loading in with prayer bead spirit or Iri huntress with an ebony mori ontop? Ye, kinda.
---
Wtf did you smoke? I've never been moried with devour hope in 1000 hours...
---
Both have great benefits and down sides... Dead hard is great but when in high ranks once you've used it once killers generally wait it out and balanced landing isn't great for all maps but on certain maps it makes certain loops infinite
---
Didn’t you just upload someone’s artwork to wallpaper engine, the creator put effort and time into his pieces for you to steal them and try take credit for it.

---
Judging by your username I can see you are a man of culture
---
implying a single generator gets done when the killer is a spirit.
---
That’s so dumb, it’s like saying. Would you rather go against devour hope or a all gen perk nurse. Btw you don’t find devour hope until your whole team is downed and slugged and the killer is mori’ everyone

Buff clown by making thick cork stopper and sticky soda bottle default (faster reload and 1 more bottle) and make  tattoos middle finger block off any windows the gas touches but takes away 2 bottles, Cigar Box makes bottles regenerate naturally but makes clown slightly less slower when full, sulfuric Acid vial becomes a very rare and makes the survivors slowly lose a health state over time when hit directly. That's all the buffs id do
---
But not mentioning selfcare xD
---
I mean, I don't care that it takes me 30 minutes to get a game as killer, I'm DCing if it's Haddonfield, and you can be sure I'm DCing if the survivors brought an offering for Haddonfield.  
---
That map is not fun, and certain survivor perks make it near impossible to do anything as killer on it.
---
So bbq have currently at least 6 counters. So not only you're crying about spirit that have plenty of counterplay but also bbq that have the same amount
---
I guess you wanna loop in the same way no matter who are you facing.. that's sad. Really really sad
---
Time for some clappin‘
---
In a perfect world maybe, but by dead by daylights CORE design, this won’t happen. There’s so many variables in play, it’s foolish to say that.
---
Oh that bitch wanted you dead XD
---
I feel bad because my favorite survivors are jake, Meg, ash, and Laurie based on looks and lore only but I don’t wanna tunnel in order to see them more lol
---
Yeah I avoided her all match only to get caught and Rancor'ed at the very end.  I was salty to say the least.
---
I love Jeff and Jane so I'm pretty biased when I run into them as killer, admittedly.
---
It is.. you just suck at hiding I guess. Or lose the killer in general
---
I stopped running self care and went up a whole rank color just bc I wasn’t spending half a gen self caring against a killer with sloppy butcher
---
Ethical. And it actually stands for:
---
People
---
Eating
---
Tasty
---
Demogorgons
---
Dude.. I use gf with brown add ons. He's fine, just be more sneaky
---
I’m not even saying keys op, like moris. Their mechanic, much like Moris, is still a very strange way to design a game. Why implement the way they were planned in the first place? Ez 4K, ez escape. 
---
Personally, I’ve never had an issue finding the hatch, so maybe I can’t subjectively see the issue with finding it.
---
But my point still stands. These people are giving ideas, and they’re getting downvoted, and I highly doubt it’s because they’re bad ideas. Rather they don’t like the concept of a key nerf. Mori should be after 2 hooks, and maybe these key ideas should be considered.
---
thank you for reuploading someone elses work with no credit for internet points im sure the creator of this appreciates you
---
Sorry for the typo lol
---
I fucking need this. I’m sure sooner or later every survivor and killer will have this skin, but I just can’t wait anymore! Nea and Feng Min, when???

Wait they’re changing syringe?

Nurse and Spirit are unbeatable of the player is good (though Nurse is really hit or miss due to all the bugs with servers), NOED can be completely negated before it even activates. Answer is pretty obvious IMO.
---
Snap em anyways
---
Concept art? What one is this?
---
AFAIK, the only Hallowed Catalyst concept art is [this one](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/599901077877424148/632542376400912384/Hallowed_Catalyst.jpg?width=1168&amp;height=657), where he's definitely wearing the same glasses as in his final model.
---
Don’t tell him PepeLaugh
---
Balanced Landing, it enables unintended loops (which is definitely getting nerfed sooner or later btw) and completely breaks maps like Haddonfield.
---
Can't tell if bait or not.
---
I'll grab the bait anyway: if you need certain perks &amp; items to win, you're doing it wrong :P
---
The issue is most of them either was a wait time, which would kill a lot of the key’s usefulness, readddng the hatch grab mechanic, which shouldn’t be added back in for obvious reasons, or removing the key’s ability to open the hatch
---
BEGONE HERETIC
---
it's bad on live too because they thought it was a good idea to use unready servers on the base version when PTB exists.
---
Idk I see shitty demo all the time but if u play him well he’s really good I think he’s to new right now and people rely on shred and don’t use portals or just use portals and don’t shred I think people don’t practice enough they just play him for daily
---
They definitely understand the bit about them becoming less common, but you didn't understand their question. What is the point? Saying "they'll be spent faster" isn't a reason. Why should BHVR remove them?
---
Rides with Strangers, leaked new stranger
---
For anyone wondering, I'm talking about (this)[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=romanian&amp;id=601371642] game
---
having the source in the comments doesnt help with the fact you uploaded this without giving any credit.
---
when you do shit like this, it seriously harms creators who could otherwise be getting some really great recognition, youre fucking over people like Fantozi when you leave no credit.
---
dont make the argument that this will increase his recognition, either. it was never your intention and the amount of exposure he would get from someone else giving credit is relatively small when compared to the amount of recognition he would get if you just linked us the youtube video you got this from.
---
had you just left Fantozi's name in the title somewhere, i wouldve been fine with that. he would have gotten the recognition and exposure he deserves from the months worth of work he put into this.
---
even worse is that you never said anything about this until people called you out for it. everyone had the impression that you made this, and you got a bunch of internet awards that cost actual money for shitting on someone elses efforts. awesomesauce.
---
theres no excuse for this shit. there needs to be a rule where stolen work is outright removed.
---
I got against Moris very often and they do need a nerf, they aren’t even on the same level as keys.
---
No one ? Ok i do it then ! 
---
# PIZZA TIME
---
yea it’s a ptb dude, if you’re not on pc nurse has been doing that for a while. she’s really buggy on console
---
nah
---
k.
---
They’re not OP, it’s just now that instaheals have been nerfed, killer mains are looking for the next thing to complain about.
---
I feel violated in so many different ways, i couldn't pay a psychologist enough for his time to describe this !
---
Aww... thats cute!
---
and a bit creepy
---
it's not a PTB it's literally on live what the fuck are you saying? Server are currently enabled on live and it causes constant bugs and rubberbanding for her
---
Hello there.
---
Tag this nsfw dude ! Now the floor is drenched and wet, because i wasnt the only one seeing it !
---
it’s not a server thing it’s a nurse thing then lol, what the fuck are you on about.
---
Whatever happened to that game?
---
Did it come out?
---
They only had themselves to blame
---
The onion ? Has that somthing to do with shrek ?
---
“Carbs are not an escape”
---
it only happens because of servers
---
Yeah, just got back into the game after a year and having trouble finding games too :(
---
No clue. The Dwight just reminded me of the first stranger in the demo, and I linked it.
---
They are..... ***too***... similar.
---
Fun Goose, he is an amazing looper and all his videos are tutorial/educational.
---
and is a bit crazoo
---
It’s a satire news site.
---
Oh wowsers thanks man I didn’t know that
---
You can hear spirits footsteps though
---
Bear mama Steve ain't fucking around
---
For survivors i would buff the lightweight perk slightly and for killers i would remove all totemspawns next to gens.
---
Y’all ever play pig like ever this would never work maybe the add ons but not this power change
---
Actually he looks like the costume considering it came first then the movies.(I know you probably know but still)
---
nice cake, and obviously outstanding :) :) :) :) : ). im pleased eatherway
---
It's amazing my good man make more please
---
Bruhhh
---
I imagined that
---
Curtain call
---
Yet when tested in game... it doesn’t work. I even mentioned it to a mod. I asked if it was bugged
---
“Nope”
---
“Just tester it again, yes”
---
*no response*
---
Oof
---
Now like Hilbilly😅
---
IIRC they intended him to be one, but there was a string of child rape incidents in the US around the time of production, so they changed it as to not seem like they were capitalising on real events.
---
I believe remake Freddy is directly referred to as a pedophile, however.
---
This aged well.
---
i'd say go shattered bloobline. spirit's top tier atm and her perks are great. adam's cool and while hes perks are more situational, they are a lot of fun when they work
---
The demogorgon is really fun to play  so id say get stranger things, shatterd bloodlines is also not a bad option. Unless you reallllly want pop goes the weasel instantly id say dont get curtain call, clown isnt great imo
---
In the current console update demogorgon is immune to spine chill &gt;_&lt;
---
Got discordance from shrine this week (will NEVER buy legion), still didn't get it on any killer, but once I get it, I'll give it a try. Ty for the suggestion :)
---
I should have been more careful, it's a real slipping hazard.
---
I sould just stop trying...
---
Yeah pretty much
---
Now my friend, that’s just bullying the hillbilly
---
They already said they are going to rework Haddonfield and Red Forest
---
Oh and I forgot to mention I already have Demo
---
&gt;Yeah and how often do you play against killer with moris? Lets be honest, killers only mori with devour hope or when a new killer comes out.
---
i guess you only play killer :D
---
I don't think assigning one survivor to be the guy that hides in lockers all match, so the rest can't be moried would be fun either.
---
S n a t c h e d
---
Dream therapy
---
Dude i always play meg but for that little time i mained david i couldnt stop myself from trying to tank for my teammates david just makes you a better person lmao
---
Well shit son, get shatterd bloodlines then. Nancy and steve arent great so there is no need to get stranger things chapter
---
They do.
---
Wait? Can you own Demogorgon without owning the Stranger Things chapter
---
&gt; *Bread*th
---
No problem legal is already on the case to send you the papers /S
---
Shattered, definitely. Also, Ash's has no killer (if I understood well, you're planning to play a different killer)
---
Davids are always units
---
Your basically describing the add on for keys.
---
I think it’s perfectly balanced due to create more chaos for the killer.
---
A race for the hatch you should call it, either the killer gets there or the survivor.
---
The other reason they are balanced is because if the killer could put the hatch out of commission for the rest of a trial is utter bullshit, survivors should be allowed to re-open it and use it for an escape.
---
Now I do admit people can be selfish with keys, but that’s how it goes, you can judge your team by the way they use keys, it kind of adds to the realistic scare that your team has left you behind.
---
Yeah, it's a bug
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dguj2x/huntress_be_like/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
For me and my friends it took the clown going afk in at one of the exit gates after the last gen and then is spending 5 minutes looking for the rando who was just chilling at the exit gate next to the hatch.
---
Only time I ever KMS on hook is if either I slipped the button or the killer is camping.
---
Does spine chill still work against stealth killers? ~~Please dont please dont please dont~~
---
There would be no totems, this way. Every single totem spawns near to a gen.
---
I really thought i was the only one who plays jane because i usually don't see anyone and that gives me hope
---
That's why I made WGLF teachable. So  people don't know I'm still farming them as Dwight. Just run borrowed time and you can have a clear conscience about it.
---
It seems you just can't play Billy not a bad thing but just because you can't play him doesn't make him no longer one of the best killers. But it's good you have found killers you are good at
---
That is a very optimal build but I reccomend blood warden in nurses calling since gens get done in under 30 sec. If their running certain stuff
---
Pepa?!
---
I would buff myers to have no shirt and Insta down every survivor upon spawning into the map
---
Got it ez with piggy
---
When you stare at the special ed kid and the teacher notices you
---
what's fangs stereotype
---
I'd wait 2 weeks because the haloween sale will probably put the non licenced dlcs on sale and maybe some of them too. Probably can pick up shattered bloodlines at a decent price.
---
**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**
---
Are you listening to yourself?
---
"A race for the hatch should call it"
---
Literally the next sentence:
---
"Keys are fair because otherwise survivors would lose the game when they lose the hatch race"
---
If keys are involved, there is no race for the hatch.  The killer can close it, but if the survivor finds it you just lose. *It's not a race if one side wins just for limping across the finish line dead last.*
---
Keys completely fuck the endgame paradigm by making it flat out impossible for the killer tho to get rid of the hatch, and that's not even *considering* their use before endgame.
---
If you have a key, you don't need to play the game. The objective becomes *optional*. You're carrying four parts of Exodia and are trying to find the fifth on the ground somewhere. You can turn a 4 death game into a 3 man escape with one item, and that
---
Keys are not balanced. Don't make me fucking laugh.
---
I can’t put my finger on what’s going on but her face is potato. It’s not as bad as the goblin but this just looks odd
---
Is the Halloween sale also on Xbox?
---
Congrats, all you did was make it easier to find the totems. They can't be within x of a gen and they still need to meet special spots to spawn? easy locating.
---
If you want I can do it.
---
Saw
---
It is not from what I’ve seen, I’ve seen challenges like (break the same generator 2 times) or (repair 2 generators).
---
You fucking madman
---
The ebony is nerfable, how about you can mori everyone in game after everyone has beens hooked at least once, instead of morying everyone after save tunneling...?
---
Maybe not, i don't know if they will make the sale apart of the next patch or if it will just be a steam only sale. I don't play xbox so i can't say if they sync sales with other platforms sorry :(
---
Nerf them by dull only letting u tro and skeleton only lasting 5 sec and only 2 survivors allowed tro (without adons) and adons should that add nr of survivirs that can exit but decrise the time of use of the key from 30s to 10s.
---
It would’ve been funnier if I could have read the actual replies but ok.
---
Were also a swf and brought a 2 purple mists
---
"David *fucking* king" brings "I dared my bestfriend to ruin my life" to mind and I love it.
---
Wait is doc getting a buff? **IS DOC GETTING SOMETHING GOOD?!**
---
U can still read them?
---
It's cosmetics, nothing good or bad about it. Just buy whatever you like and what you think looks cool.
---
Wraith is not one of the worst imo
---
Can't read the replies lmao
---
Like the first message. Then all the replies are too bright for me.
---
Would get more upvotes if it was tho lol
---
Sometimes yeah I'll spot one and head in her general direction while not directly looking at her.  Always catches them off guard.
---
I must have it
---
30k is def not normal as a new player lmfao. The max is 32k, your telling me a new player should be getting nearly merciless every game? Hell even i don't crack 30k most of the time without an offering, its usually 22k+
---
RUN
---
I only be an asshole to these kinda survivors, the ones who get sakty easily, I love winding them uo
---
instaheals are so balanced that they're getting nerfed
---
I mean, I'm also a really terrible nurse and I can make her sound weak too. "How am i supposed to track survs when im always looking at the floor, I always lose them."
---
but we know good nurses destroy, It's just a matter of improving as billy. 
---
Those are the tools that make him as strong as he is, You just have to know how to use them. Once hes ontop of you your basically down against a good billy.
---
Because it’s only 8 minutes old and mods aren’t all knowing
---
Poor legion, left out
---
I see no actual difference for the 2 and 4
---
"Want to win" will obviously use the best of the best for that
---
This also apply to survivors
---
Yes where do i sign on
---
YES YES YEEEEEEEES!
---
Keys are still useful for wallhacks, bond, infinite obsession aura and opening hatch after the killer closed it. The hatch change we need is for the survivors to not be able to yeet out of the game, while moris can just be removed
---
Hag, buff her teleport range to 60M base, and make an add-on that resets traps that have been triggered, but not used.
---
Newbie question here: does looking back at the killer make you slower versus looking straight ahead?
---
Weirdly enough, grabbing works on Ghost Face for me but not Myers.
---
Because you dont play well, plus I said 25k-30k is normal, 22k is pretty close buddy. BTW just FYI 32k doesnt mean its a merciless, you can 32k black pips you know. BP has nothing to do with emblems

---
Your just a shit billy tbh. His saw takes time to get good at to hover 99% without using but afterword he is debatable 3rd/4th best. Micheal trapper and legion are way behind him in an equal skill players hands.
---
Mobility is king, being able to traverse the map within seconds is the best thing you can have as a killer, beyond instadowns even. Billy has both. The problem with them, is that they are more telegraphed and jukeable then the other 2 high mobility killers options, being speedy invisible tracking and literal teleports.
---
your not supposed to use the mobility in a chase, you use it to guarantee a down with the chainsaw when the survivor has no options, you still have your m1 if they use windows or loop good enough.
---
I just quit every match with a secret offering. Moris are too unbalanced to even take the time and try to play that match
---
Ah okay cool. 
---
Hopefully the dlcs are on sale on haloween so I can buy leatherface
---
Option 2 is neat but hitboxes aren't the most consistent thing so there would be so many "that should've been a headshot" moment and vice versa
---
That is very wrong lol. Moris are very common and the amount of nurses and spirits with ebony or the best addons is insane
---
Plague would say occupied and Huntress would screech
---
New killer: The Exodia
---
True. But since everyone knows Plague for puking on everyone, I guess it might fit well anyway
---
yeah my bad, usually when i get 32k i get at merciless or at least brutal. 25K may be normal as a killer who knows things, but i literally watched my friend play killer for the first time for 3 games the other day and he literally got 1 hook and then they 4k escaped on him all 3 games. 9K~ BP average.
---
Moris and keys are not fine. Insta meds are. Moris are so easy to use you dont even need to make an effort, you just win in 5 minutes. And keys, they are so unfair, the amount of times i got a really nice killer who got 1 kill and everybody was hooked twice, but we just escaped because we had a key is also very large
---
Hey, nice job :)
---
Yeah but her lore doesn't really fit the furiously shitting angle, even if she does puke.  I'd imagine her to actually be pretty civil besides her vomiting ability
---
Huntress is literally a child so she's furiously screech like when you drop a pallet on her.
---
Nice
---
its a good achievement. well done man!
---
Nobody likes a quitter crybaby though.
---
Waiting for vaporeon ghostface
---
 ba dumm tsss :v
---
Dude you just offended burgerking myers ! You dont have to bring the clown into this ! There is already one in the game !
---
And ruin the other 4 players' experience. Keep it up, you are doing great.
---
Yeah. Exactly)
---
I'm not talking about new players, obviously you aren't gonna do well if you dont know how to play the game, only got 1 hook. I'm talking about red ranks which is actually the average player if you look at the graphs from a few months ago, and unless they are on a brand new killer with no perks, they wont get below 20k.
---
&gt;I mean okay lol regardless of what you consider a secondary objective it's still completely unfair to have all your hard work trashed because you only got 4 of the (yes, more and more well hidden) totems.
---
Wait.. "your work trashed"? What do you mean? You gathered points didn't you? You God your emblems, I don't remember you get insta killed if you don't find every totem and even if so your work, or progress, still count
---
&gt;I realize a lot of them spawn inside the same spots in jungle gyms but there's still various locations that no one would think to check like the corner of the outskirt of the house in Yamaoka's estate or inside the corner of the garage in the auto shop. 
---
  Again,  hexes are the most powerful perks in the game which is why they can be out in the open or extremely well hidden. That's the point of totems otherwise they'd just give the killer the benefit with no repercussion lol
---
You can find many totems just hopping to gen to gen. There are few decent locations but most of them are not. Yeah hexes are very powerful but with a huge downside, can be denied. You acknowledge that so I don't know why are you crying about it if every single perk of survivors cannot be denied at all 
---
Having better spots just makes the hexes slightly more viable since only 1 is actually used, ruin. That's it. Why? Buy time, even if just a little bit because it's so easy to find due to totems locations
---
Any other hexes are a waste due to this reason. Why would I use devour hope when it will get destroyed before I reach even 3 stacks? Why would I bother use lullaby when it won't last for even 2min. And so on
---
&gt;As to having no knowledge of the game that's a pretty ignorant response just because I think noed, a notoriously unfair perk, is unfair lol
---
Again. Want me to show you perks usage? Noed is decent but at high ranks nobody uses it because gets denied before it even activate. And when it does, you can get 1 down before get cleansed.
---
Yes, what you say is pretty ignorant if you think noed is a problem and unfair. It's fine for what it does as well as adrenaline, the opposite of noed but cannot be denied. In fact it's used even in high ranks unlikely noed
---
Pretty sure they can already use their huge fucking dick to smack the killer about with. Real Big Dick energy for 2 MoM uses.
---
Moris are op. Instaheals were op. Keys are op. Trapper ultra rares - op but he kinda needs them so I'll let it slide. Prayer beads, op. Fathers' glasses, op. Wraith all seeing - op but, again, he kinda needs it.
---
Because the toxic cunts will stop being toxic cunts then ? Fucking 2000 IQ play right her ! Big Brain times ! I recommand Civ6, i heard thats a good game !
---
Michael Myers

His update was announced at the same time as the nurse's. It was said that it was going to be mainly addons reworked on nurse but look at what they did to her kit! I'M SUPER EXCITED TO SEE DOCTOR'S KIT UPDATED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. Cause current doctor's kit is mainly consisted of having to shock precisely to the millisecond to get the stun and getting pallets thrown at you left and right, which is so f'ing annoying since you know you can't hit that shock because of the lag and the DELAY, OH GOD THE DELAY....
---
Well if your slugged your probably not the last guy, so if you don't need the bloodpoints it's actually beneficial for you to leave since it helps your team mate.
---
In my opinion, the apron is really good. It would pair well with the welding mask(s) or the miner helmet.
---
I’m not ‘complaining about killers doing their only objective’- and I’m well aware of what a crutch is as well. And in terms of a video game crutch, NOED fits right in; a handicap for not playing well. It’s obvious to see why NOED exists; it’s training wheels for new players, and I don’t have much of an issue with that. We were all new once upon a time. But this doesn’t make it any less of a crutch perk.
---
What do you mean “there are no crutches, only crutchy mindsets”? What does that even mean?
---
# ^ YES THIS !!
---
The delay hurts my soul, legit playing as doctor is more annoying than playing against him imo...
---
Man OP as fuck already with impossible Gen build. If that shit gets any worse people will uninstall.
---
I’ll be honest my favourite skin is seaside psycho the face mask and weapon looks awesome
---
Na this guy was clearly oblivious or just really wanted to catch that survivor. If he assumed he had ds, as you said, would not stop him from downing them, just from picking them up for a bit.
---
This does happen quite a lot when a killer has been in a chase for a bit. They just get more angry to that one survivor and ignore everything else.
---
To be fair he wasnt that toxic. He messaged me after the game and we had a nice chat and we both said gg in the end
---
IMO myers and billy are the most BALANCED killers
---
Not saying myers is top tier just balanced
---
He is Mister Ghostface ok ! Let him have some privacy, damit !
---
Instaheals getting much more nerfs than Nurse
---
You rank 20 or something? I've played against that type of doc and yes, at first it was annoying to the core, but after ranking up and getting better (and getting a new GPU), I can now easily hit the skill-checks :)
---
Its always good when I get a free dead hard/ speed boost when Legion stabs a second time lol
---
Facing nothing but Billy and Spirit must be fun
---
I was gonna make a meme for that but I think someone already did the meme I wanted to do
---
Yeah thats called using your perks to your advantage.
---
Alt f4 is actually coded to use the escape menu leave. Then quits the game. By force quit I mean open task manager and kill DBDs process
---
If your going full meta tryhard then your gonna want meg first, sprint burst and adrenaline are basically bread and butter of high ranks you will see often, at least on PC. Dead hard(david king) is better then sprint burst  since it gives invincibility frames however it takes time to get used to using it, but is the best exh perk in the game imo.
---
If your just trying to learn the game, feng is a good start off person as a brand new player, especially since shes free on console, but her perks are not that meta or used at all. One is a situational sprint burst and the other two are basically worthless since one will almost never come into player since you shouldn't miss skillchecks, and the other just tells you what killer it is if someone else gets into a chase first basically.
---
After meg/david if you want dead hard, you really can't go wrong with going dwight just for bond, it gives you so much information if you can process it or Bill for borrowed time.
---
An ideal free survivor build would basically be
---
Exhaustion perk(sprint burst/dead hardbalanced landing), Adrenaline, Borrowed time, your choice. Gives you chase potential  with the exhaustion, adren for late game surviveability  borrowed time for saving and final perk whatever you like, self care for healing yourself,bond for team locating and information, we'll make it for healing after hook saving etc.
---
I'm thinking of changing the tagline, so reply with your best ones and I might do it
---
Shiet the first pig buff we received in a long time.
---
Lmao rank 20. No. Rank 5 in PS4 and 1 week into PC and I am now rank 7. Solo queue is testing me tho. Shits hard when you get a generic Claud who hides in tall grass instead of saving you
---
I'm getting dowvotes on this?? Do people seriously think a 15 second opening time would make keys useless?? 
---
Or was my mori nerf suggestion too much. 
---
I guess being tunneled off hook by a ghostface is balanced. 
---
I'm not mad at the loss of karma but I am certainly confused as to how the hell people think moris and/ or keys are fair...
---
\&gt; Really ?
---
your originality is incredible
---
Yeah it takes time to loop, i recently returned to the game and its tough. My main problem is that its hard to know exactly where to run to during a chase, but it comes with time learning the maps. Your friend is basically telling you to get meta perks that require knowledge to use. You may get really good and he is basically setting you up with good perks to build around, but its often better to use shitty perks to get game knowledge first rather then have the best tools and slowly learn to use them. For instance, you would think its a great idea to have self care so you can always heal yourself, but as a new player your basically going to prioritize getting to a corner of a map and then healing yourself at twice the speed you would of healed at if you just went to a teammate at a generator and then you both could of did the objective together. Its all about wasted time.

Excuse me?

Trapper needs to waste way too much time collecting and placing traps, plus somewhat decend players will know where traps are placed.
---
Legion was broken af with the mend Timer going down without looking and is now still really decend at allowing the game and tracking survivors. Sure, Legion is really addon depended, only the cd/duration and iri button are useful, but  that us also true for Wraith or Leatherface who are both pretty much completly useless without good addons.
---
Also, do you realise how dumb the claim "no rework can fix" is? Even if something is completely useless/broken, a good rework can make it decend or good

Started running calm spirit as part of a stealth build with iron will spine chill and distortion. Its great when getting hooked as if 'shurg, that all ya got?! But most useful with the doctor and that scream perk when survivors get downed.

Its worth it just for that occasional doctor who gets all stressed out that their power isn't working.

Im sad i have only 72 karma :(

New ability, orange wall. At random moments an orange wall will appear on the left side of the Plagues shoulder, immediately killing any survivors that come into contact with it.

I used to try stalking with him all the time, thinking that was his main power. Boi was I wrong. I only stalk when the right situation arises, otherwise I go for easy stabs and use night shroud in the chase mixed with crouching for some mind games. He’s very fun and effective when not using his power how it must have been intended.
---
Yeah stealth killers are getting undetectable status when using there abilities so that means aura reading perks won’t see them now right?

you do know that you cant hear gifs, right?

Imagine a survivor enjoying a game with you, the killer, so much that they take the time to make a picture for it. True love.
---
&gt;I'm talking about red ranks which is actually the average player
---
You used this in the sentance saying that if unless they had no perks they wont get below 20k. What your saying is a red rank person can basically get what he did with no perks, and with perks a red rank will get 25k+.
---
How is a new player supposed to be getting 25k, i'd say 15k on a newish player with no kills is about average.

Try overcharge instead of surveillance, it doesn't always proc but id say it procs a good 80% of the time and it drops back generator progression

The only time I ever notice crows is when they make a bunch of them freak out on the boat in the swamp maps.

I would just hope you arent hiding all game
---
Thats what he actually did
---
That would add back hatch stand-offs, but they would be even worse than before. If there is at least one other survivor alive, having a standoff because a person has a key would be extremely survivor-sided, since the other person could easily do gens while the person at the hatch and the killer wait for the other one to make a move or mess up. On the other hand, if there is only one survivor, and the killer closed the hatch and initiates End-Game Collapse, then it is extremely killer, favored, since all they have to do is wait out the timer and the survivor can't do anything about it.
---
Thanks
---
My friend who i mentioned before was rank 20 and got destroyed by level 14's. He didnt face a single person below rank 16, and that was a bill who had borrowed time and unbreakable lmao.

No he’s just giving a thumbs up for the entire match

Her dresser must be a dumpster

To be fair, they are cosplaying a normal woman in a mask, lol. Technically it's as accurate as it gets.

Hag literally got a tiddy out, and spirit wears a medical tape thong. If you want to complain about costume accuracy, sure whatever. But y'all complaining about a belly button showing in a cosplay of a murderer sounding kinda silly
---
Reverse bear trap my heart
---
The point of all items on the game is to make it easier without having to change your play style this would disrupt everything and cause a pretty huge debate considering none of the survivor items require any skill. In addition making them similar to devour hope would probably be a buff you’re just potentially giving the killer a free exposed effect with no totem to cleanse along with the mori’s towards the end game
---
Imagine putting Michael in the same tier as Billy and Spirit.
---
Jon Fucking Mess

UwU
---
Good idea, I didn’t even think about practicing loadouts
---
Yeah I genuinely like nothing apart from maybe the set from the Grim Matsuri collection, but that's at a push lmao xd
---
A good wraith, who knows how to use his power during a chase, is so much more than an M1 killer. He isn’t high tier by any means, but he’s excellent at punishing unsafe pallets, along with the extra mobility and stealth
---
If he got ‘The Ghost’ add-on (Terror radius and red stain fully reduced 5 seconds after decloaking) as a passive, he’d actually be in a really good place
---
That pig face looks grotesque!I love it
---
Well I believe in the dev update when they changed this, it was either new players or all players, have a general limit +-6 of their current rank for a game. But like I said, if they're doing swf with a rank higher than yours and there's barely any on in your region then you'll struggle for games.
---
No. I'm really into fashion in video games but there isn't much to do with current jane's outfit.

Eat a dick you fuckin sociopaths
---
I actually don't know how people constantly play against toxic players. I rarely ever do and I have 3500 hours put into this game on my Xbox. Just play the match and move on.
---
You can curve around objects making his chainsaw extremely effective during chases but it’s also hard to time. Then he can go across the map within seconds, so he can get survivors down quick and protect gens effectively without waiting for his power to come back up.
---
Yeah ive had so many of those i dont even let pizza dwights get away anymore and if i have a mori ill let them crawl to the hatch then mori....little toxic yes...but thank the community for being so toxic why would killers show kindness
---
Ah yeah. That’s happened to me once or twice. Sorry man
---
Oh no, my negative five inch dick was showing wasn't it?
---
Neither should be nerfed. That's a really stupid suggestion, tbh.
---
And he learns a new juggle trick with juggling the knife with his wrist.  I think he wants to work at Hibachis
---
Oh pity me. I just want BP. This is a rant.
---
All.
---
Not really concerned about deranking as much as BP gain. I die 3 mins in the game with a BPS. :(
---
It would honestly be great if the camera were raised a foot while crouched (no need for any change to the model) so I stop bumping into palm fronds and corn ljke a blind person.
---
Hey I got a negative 5 inch penis and I'm proud. My husband accepts it too.
---
Awww at that point it's just bullying lol, wonder why she missed so much tho
---
well if you wanna know what his Problem was:
---
He basically complained that you were tryharding after his wife had a dc and that you left him to die on the floor, which is just dumb as he crawled and hid in a corner lol.
---
Hes just an entitled and kinda pathetic Survivor Main and seems to be a really unpleasent human being
---
because this post is poo crap
---
You make me angry
---
I still have yet to make the saw and a few more details. There really isnt much else when you go for her Test Subject cosmetic ❤
---
your information is wrong, hatch only spawns when there is +1 generators complete than the number of survivors who are alive. With the exception being one survivor left in which the hatch spawns regardless. So for 4 survivors 5 gens need to be done for hatch to spawn, 4 gens for 3, 3 gens for 2. Keys are in no way a free escape, especially for multiple survivors, I would say ever since killer was given the ability to close hatch, keys are even harder to utilize in a tight situation for multiple hatch escapes as the killer can just close the hatch after 1 survivor opens it, so unless you have multiple keys, multiple hatch escapes in the presence of a killer is very rarely gonna happen, let alone if you add a 15 second time to using them.
---
The very rare cases where you have 4 man hatch escapes are most likely already in a losing killer match anyway, all gens are done and everyone is still alive and if the killer is on you guys when doing it it IS still possible to close the hatch before all 4 jump in.
---
Sure you can have the odd game as killer where you lose out on a kill or 2 due to it, but that's literally the design of the hatch in the first place and it doesn't happen every single match to where it
---
is broken due to how unreliable it is to get the hatch at times.
---
Yeah that's a good idea, but I'd rather level up hag and trapper for ruin and brutal strength (for kicking gens)
---
Billy is more like A on console, like the nurse he’s much harder to steer
---
👀
---
It is! I am really happy with it!
---
But it’s legion
---
Already married ❤
---
See brutal strength is good for gen kicking but I don't see it as anything better than that and I don't think you really get much out of it if they just tap the gender quickly after you leave
---
That's fair as a Pig main, it's nice that OoO, Alert, etc. wont work while crouched.
---
This is why I never spare dwights
---
But not Kindred though, right?
---
NOED says it all
---
I don’t constantly play against these toxic SWFs but when I rarely find them it just ruins the game for me. They always have to message you after the game reminding you that you lost as well.
---
That's bc you suck
---
Yeah lol, honesty the crop top was a mistake I thought I ordered I midriff for it but I'm pretty happy with how it looks so I'm going with it!
---
Geez the pathing stressed me out but the killer did more
---
As others have said, individual’s performance isn’t always the determining factor. I suck with Nurse but she’s still widely considered the best because in proper hands, she’s a nightmare. 
---
What Billy has is the ability to gen-pressure better than any other killer and insta down. He’s not like Spirit or Nurse where they can end chases quickly if they’re getting looped, his best move is to surprise people are generators. If you find yourself in a prolonged chase as Billy, you probably aren’t utilizing his skills to their highest capacity. 
---
The saw isn’t going to be the main weapon in most loops or a handful of chases (Insta-Saw Billy is a different story). But flying gen to gen makes him dangerous. Using BBQ can ruin games very early.
---
BAKING is not an escape
---
Turn off messages from people you don't know/leave the lobby after the game ends. Stop pretending like you can't do anything about it.
---
Break that in half and you'll have the new trapper mask
---
Bread is not a baguette!
---
I think it’d be possible because all we have to do is gens and I’m pretty sure it’s shared across all 4 survivors and killers just have to hook survivors on certain hooks.
---
At the end of the day, NCR = Cowboys, Legion = Indians
---
It's one of my favourite westerns going.
---
Or maybe... they could not message the killer after the game to be toxic? Sounds like a better idea than blaming the people receiving the toxic messages 🙄
---
No i dint depip but i do 69 points
---
Thank you so much for this!  This is very helpful!
---
" I mainly play legion at rank 1  " ....jesus you are a masochist ! 
---
They do what they do and the devs are disgustingly stupid and listen to exact those people. Why do you think the nurse got so trashed and will become basicly garbage to bully, because toxic swf cunts complained long and load enough for her to be completly trashed, then they will go to spirit and than will continue with whatever killer triggers those crybabys next and the devs will pander to those non stop, they getting there money for stupid mindless cosmetics, so why should they care ?
---
Eep, that’s scary
---
We're thicc but we're quicc
---
Its not that hard to find totems lol, if youre struggling run a map with red twine and youll learn the basic and general spawns

No don't be funny with this guy he's just gave you a solution and you threw it in his face. Turn off your messages and move on.

Not blaming you. Never daid I was. But you're being a 'victim' over some stupid messages. Turn off notifications or if you're on pc, just leave after the match is complete. It is not that hard.
---
I dont blame players, when its in the game, then you have every right to us it, i blame the incompetent devs for not addressing issues, not the players. If insidous is in the game to make camping "vaiable" i blame the devs for doing it, not bubba for using it. Same goes for suvivor perks.
---
Man I understand swf is annoying to deal with but omg do u know how annoying soloing and getting trash teamates riding on ur back gosh I've been chased for 6 whole mins and not a single gen was touched they were all looking for ruin
---
WHY?! HOW CAN STEALTH KILLERS LIKE MYERS AND GHOSTFACE STALK THEN IF THEY NEED TO STALK THE SUVIVORS?!
---
that's an aura reading ability, so I doubt it.
---
I agree with you man. I get called sweaty and a try hard just because I want points.
---
New perk: Pez.
---
Spirit: You can phase around the map at the speed of sound and basically have constant mapwide pressure.
---
GhostFace: You see survivor auras for a split second after downing someone specifically with your power.
---
Say the guy who plays the most antifun killer in the game
---
Oh, apparently tier 1 myers isn’t affected by it. That’s it though
---
What if you use the styptic and syringe at the same time? Would you gain endurance and also be healed passively?
---
I main Billy. He’s hard to steer but once you learn it’s easy. I’m not talking about how hard they are, I’m talking about how effecient you can be with them as a console killer

it's no problem, thanks for apologising

you know that this function isnt existent on the App?

they're too good, imo.  ANd i consider myself a killer main.  I've had games as survivor where it is getting later in the game, the killer has someone hooked and 2 downed and chasing me.  Me insta healing to full one of the downed survivors allowed us to get the others off the hooks and finish last gen and all escaped.  Otherwise it would have been a 4k.

---
No he’s not. Sure his Discordance + Pop combo is strong but smart survivors with a brain will just not stack, and now he has to teleport to one gen then walk all the way to another to still get looped. With addons he’s A tier but not without
---
Well let's see, the other night my friends and I were getting moried by killers for a solid 5 hours straight just because one had a flashlight, the other had a toolbox and for other petty reasons including the fact my feng has the blue hair/mask cosmetic or simply because we all loaded in at the same time. You can't get anymore petty than that especially since I never bring items into a match to begin with since I horde them. So after literally every single game the killer brought a mori I decided to use my depip loadout which includes my commodious toolbox and brand new part, resilience, prove thyself and no mither. If you're gonna tunnel and facecamp right off the hook and make the game unfun then I'm gonna make the game unfun for you and end it in 4 minutes flat. Get fucked.
---
Tldr: It happens more often than you think. Meanwhile insta heals can only be used once per person in a match. Your ebony mori doesn't just disappear just because you used it on 1 person the same way an insta heal does when it gets used.
---
Get a grip lmao
---
Turning off my messages isn’t going to get rid of toxic SWFs. The messages are only one of the many problems they bring to the game. My main problem is with the SWFs themselves not the messages after the game.
---
Because matchmaking dosnt take long enough already, LOL !
---
So, the spirit had ebony but you and another survivor had enough guile to repair 5 generators and unlock the exit gate but you are still the victims?
---
On that day kars became the perfect organism...
---
Most people not knowing how to use Plague does not mean she’s not A tier. If people actually knew how strong she was she’d be use much more often. And also to aim puke, you have to look to the side of the survivor and the puke will twist in

One chase costs you 18 seconds at best an insta heal can be used 4 times on 4 Survivors seperately. Thats 4,8 Minutes chase, gens can be done in 80 seconds, thats 4-3 gens if done optimally. 
---
An ebony mori needs a 36 second chase overall to kill one survivor, and 144 seconds for all survivors (18 second optimal chase, keep in mind that chases against good players take alot longer than that).  Ebony moris are strong af, yes. They can indeed just fuck an entire survivor match, but keep in mind that youre not supposed to win every game and that the killer should be stronger. There is a high chance that the killer next match doesnt use a mori unless you guys are an swf or have some really "I JUKE YOU FOR DAYS" Skins. I play as a leatherjacket kate and i havent been moried this month so far, i guess you guys are really unlucky. 
---
Mories shouldnt be nerfed just because survivors got an ultra rare nerfed, thats the typical "if i get that, you get that too" Mentality, i guess we should just let the devs collect data about moris and then we will see. 
---
You guys should keep in mind that the nerf had a reason and if the devs will see that the mori does come in use more often than usual it will get nerfed surely too.

You don’t just make dedicated servers, they haven’t got money to buy servers globally, plus BTW the whole reason they do licensed content is for profit, same with all DLC’s. If it made them go into negatives they would’ve stopped ages ago but they’ve had rising and growing success. Especially with stranger things. Sales rose by thousands on the release.  So before you don’t understand how business works and that they make profit not constant profit losses, you shouldn’t talk about how they can’t afford servers as it’s expensive to run the servers especially with the amount connecting.

Legit not matter xD
---
If you run from all your problems instead of trying to fix them, life’s gonna be rough for you. Tbh that’s why I usually see more younger players rage quit in comparison, they typically haven’t learned that lesson yet. Quitting to just put yourself in the same position over again having learned nothing keeps you in the same cycle, plain and simple. It’s like playing Madden and every time you fail a play.. you quit.
---
Yeah sorry your right
---
I'd say to make it so that the hatch will close after the survivor using the key enters it, and it can't be reopened after the killer closes it.
---
Other than her mind game ability, Prayer beads' removal of the sound is seen as plain BS so theres the suggestions. 2 seems moreso funky and is just an idea I had
---
If you’re in deep wound, you can’t be healed, right? You’d need to be mended first?

Interesting! I didn’t think about the possibility of shining on the husk.

Bubba is fun,and so are the others.

Only killer that doesn’t really require skill is clown.

i would have thought knocking back would be legion, but thinking about it i feel like it could be both.

Why don't they make it so Iridescent head just trumps other add-ons they had that before with with some of the hag's old addons 
---
So if you use iridescent head you're locked to one hatchet even if you use Infantry belt or anything to give you more it's just a waste of an add-on.
---
Everything else would be able to apply it like increased reload and wind up time but just not more hatchets

---
I don’t see any problem. When you use Adrenaline you take the risk of being injured before exit gates are powered. If the killer was good this Steve could’ve been hooked just before exit gates were powered, then he might be fucked. It’s a risk you take. We should stop telling bad killers to use NOED, they’re relying on a crutch. We should instead teach them map pressure and rotations so they won’t need NOED. So when this situation happens, they won’t get tilted, even though if all 5 gens get done and no one is dead, that’s definitely on you.

No XP or Blood-Points are rewarded in Kill your Friends the mode is purely made to have fun with your friends.

If they're SWF, it puts them with another player of around the same rank of the best rank. Could be the reason.

If you are a good survivor you shouldn’t need certain perks or addons
---
Nothing is easy to play at high ranks lol. I got the grasp of nurse within 2 games but I can't learn spirit for the life of me

Wow, thanks man, I always wondered why Myers shadow looked like a penguin trying to fly.
---
Mories ARE NOT FINE

Not my proudest fap

What? Matchmaking? Fixed?
---
Well hello there.
---
Shit lol
---
Hey now, don't start talking about my wildest fantasies.
---
Dwight: "Ocupado!"
---
Yeah I hope they work on it soon. It’s making it hard to rank up when I’m the only one who knows how to play the game and they all get thrown so quick. And it feels unfair to the baby killers when I loop them. It’s just not fun over all
---
&gt;Boris
---
This feels like one of those weird images you find with a Russian caption.
---
The longer the killer waits for a game the less strict the matchmaking is. So after waiting long enough the survivors rank could be all over the place.
---
They are going to remove this post because "it brings nothing to the subreddit" my got removed too except myn was a meme and for some reason they didn't like that it was a screenshot.
---
Honestly I'm not fond of the body I prefer his varsity jacket.
---
But I really like the weapon and the mask
---
The mask would look really good with Joey's devil-may-care
---
It’s not broken, if you want to go against people your exact rank your friend would be waiting for hours on end. You do understand that right??
---
Because then you’ll have rank 20’s at rank 1
---
I probably won’t be playing legion at rank 1 for much longer. I wish I could still play him but SWFs doing 5 gens in 5 minutes makes it hard to get more than a black pip. I think I’ll switch to spirit before the SWFs get her nerfed too.
---
I am happy to find an outfit for Julie I actually like
---
Yeah the base mask looks good, but some contour and blood will make it look a lot better
---
They'd better nerf SWFs somehow. Because 3rd programs cheating ruins games for me many killers
---
That’s good for you, and I respect your opinion, but not once have I ever had that experience, or any experience where one side wasn’t having fun without goofing around together.
---
&gt; They all appear separate
---
This can happen when someone has a slow computer.
---
I’m on Console and I can forgive that happening the odd time but it’s definitely not why I’m only ranked with these ranks for the last two days for up to maybe 20 games over all.
---
You got that right! They are like fleas!
---
Oh okay between you and me, I thought the skulls were made of little cakes.
---
Im glad you left the squad, and yea i prob relate a bunch of dumb shit with all them with you, but you still where bad enough that i actually thought you hated me. Maybe i did misunderstand some things but i know you remember some shit that went down.
---
yes it was dumb of me to say shit like that, and i doubt you care much, but i will stop, i dont care anymore. i thought you hated me since we first met, and i guess i was wrong.
---
I'm such a weeb that I bought it as soon as it came out.

First and last time I ever bought cosmetics.

They probably will at some point: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/df12kp/patch\_notes\_330\_ptb\_official\_thread/f30cd9e/?context=1000](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/df12kp/patch_notes_330_ptb_official_thread/f30cd9e/?context=1000)

You've done a bad thing, mister.
---
A spirit with noed? I think that’s a first for me
---
My username isn't referencing my opinions as i think hag is good, its a reference to Tydetyme's (i think thats how you spell it) tier list where he put bubba in B tier and hag in D tier.
---
And also yea wraith is arguable, but i think legion is a tad bit better, wraith is 100% better than Bubba and clown tho.

If it lasts more than four hours, contact The Doctor.

I see that like a total win

I have no idea how hes so serious while playing after 3 years.

Why are you trying to conince me that huntress is fun to play against? I hate her, I hated her forever I played countless matches against her. I don't care "famous streamers" think of her.

Bud they’re literally spending money and time on reworking survivors hair animations.... yes I know how business works, but the shit they spend their money on is stupid and could’ve had dedicated servers by now if they put that money towards that instead of reworking an animation for survivors hair. It’s not just licensed outfits, it’s the shit that doesn’t matter. I’m pretty sure they aren’t even close to losing profits even without their licensed skins considering they aren’t even out plus they have a season pass coming which cost $10 as is plus the dlcs that come out and plus the non licensed skins that all they gotta do is design and not go through legal shit.
---
No problem
---
Also make demogorgon not be able to get blinded because he has no eyes
---
I wouldn't call it rarely successful. I've had a pretty decent amount of 3 or 4ks robbed by keys, but I'm sure that just as many survivors have gotten escapes robbed by moris. I think of they made it to where only one survivor can escape with a key, then completely removing Ebody Moris would be fine.

I love when we get a peak at his real face.

Yes, I am aware of that. I don’t think I should have to change my message settings every time I play this game. Can’t believe people are defending hate mail.

#13/10/2019 Patch Notes
---
*Killer Balances and fixes* :
---
-The Pig can now get killed by the Survivors
---
-The Pig can no longer damage survivors
---
Alright I'm pretty new to the game and I dont understand what happened here. How did the (blood warden?) Gate pop up right then?
---
Platform: PS4
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: I selected a 103% bloodpoint offering and green add ons on my Spirit while waiting for a lobby, then I changed them to black ward, prayer beads and yakuyoke amulet but when the offerings appeared it showed the 103% bp one instead and actually used it. The black ward was still there and the add ons gone. This bug forced me to instantly get her to Prestige I and waste several Black Ward offerings.
---
I was with you until I saw the lower half.
---
I’ll get ranked with people one color up/one color down.
---
It only appeared for me because the killer can't escape. That gate wasnt there for them, only for me.
---
Noed. I tend to automatically assume the killer has that just to be safe, so I always play different when last gen pops if I can.
---
Better not cleanse it!
---
Pretty sure Skeemoo showed that he still has pants under that. The realm would explode and peoples pcs would catch fire at the idea of having to render such a glorious meaty member.
---
Add that to the "things I had no fucking clue could be made into sentences" list. Also happy cake day

Michael: \*drops teeth over the stall door\*
---
what am I complaining about? Can you read?
---
It's a trade I would be 1000% willing to do yeah. I don't really care about keys since they change my games rarely. I just did a full afternoon of red rank survivor games using a key (I had a healthy stock on my Bill and this conversation sparked my curiosity so I decided to just burn through them), around 20 games, the key helped me escape two times. Alone. (there wa 
---
If we were to grade it, I'd say that one survivor escaping via key is uncommon, two is very rare, and more than two is ultra rare. On the other hand
---
Very true. All the following dc’s are saving time though.
---
I've been playing this game for over a year and I don't use addons or offerings. I horde literally everything because I want to see what the cap on items/addons and offerings are if there even is one. I still have 15 of those Halloween flashlights from last year as well that I just decided that I wanted to keep those 15 in specific instead of wasting them. I'm not some new player that sucks at the game. Unlike the majority of the people in this sub I actually know what I'm talking about and what I'm doing. Sorry that most of y'all only have like 40 hours up to 200 in this game. Meanwhile I have well over 5k hours put into this game. There's no reason to make shit up and no reason for me to not have 100+ types of offerings on any one of my killers. Insta heals are one of the rarest things to show up in a bloodweb and that says a lot since the purple flashlight is the 1st rarest to come into a bloodweb.
---
You basically told me that the problems I’m encountering arent a rank 1. Thus implying that my entire argument is invalid. Therefore saying my balance complaints are nothing even though it’s ruining the game experience for me bc I’m not a rank 1 player. 
---
So yeah you did say that but okay
---
Damn, I must have just turned it off at that time. Was he just trashing the build the whole time and legit raging at it? Also is the game clipped?
---
Demogorgon doesn't have the nicheness people enjoy from other killers, it's very much a jack of all trades. He has a little bit of everything, tracking (portal instinct), mobility (portals), stealth (portal undetectable), mid-chase power (shred), and game slowdown (destroying portals)
---
Generally, people have more fun playing killers with distinct strengths and weaknesses.
---
Honestly, I don't really see anything killers do as toxic. Yes, there are some asshole moves, like facecamping, but I don't equate it to be the same thing, mainly because at least it's still some sort of strategy (bad strategy is still strategy). I guess mori spamming or tbagging as pig/ghostface would be about it.
---
Mainly the only thing I really count as toxic is tbagging and flashlight spamming. Neither are good for strategy in any way.
---
I wouldn't say it's the most unfair, but definitely boring
---
I also depip a lot because people dc very early in the game making it near impossible to finish the generators. It’s very problematic and if I’m already being fucked over by having an even worse chance to survive then I shouldn’t be fucked over by my rank either.
---
And prove thyself sfw
---
Hex: Joe
---
Ah right, I forgot how hard it is to hook one person and then tunnel them. Killers have it so hard.
---
You beat me to it
---
"It's a shit build, it doesn't have ruin."
---
And then he proceeded to call the person a rank 15 killer lol. Nevermind the fact that there's a LOT of high rank killers who don't use ruin and still manage to perform very well on a regular basis.
---
I wouldn't mind Tru3's opinions - for example that ruin is mandatory and any build that doesn't include it is by default shit - if it wasn't for the fact that he touts himself as a really good killer and proceeds to go on a "not in red ranks" rant when people point out that they do well with the builds he call shit. Big yikes.
---
I had to get it the second it came out. I've had a few survivors DC because of it I think lol
---
Make the Spirit be a pile of body parts because chopped up bodies don't float.
---
Flashlights needed the nerf, insta heals needed the nerf (even though they’re still very good) I’m not sure about brand new part as I don’t know what it did before it got nerfed, maps are kinda bad but can still be used to find ruin totem, and keys are cancerous. There is zero counterplay you can do against a person with a key except kill them, but then another survivor will just take the key and now it starts all over again.
---
I’m not saying killers are perfect, Mori’s should have to hook the person twice so you can mori them on death hook. 
---
When you’re playing at rank 1 and you’re just having fun with a low tier killer and then all of a sudden they all start insta healing against you, some escape through hatch because of keys it’s just not fun.
---
\*\*\*ruin the 1 other player's experience. Let's be honest here, no survivors are enjoying that match anyway
---
Damn
---
They're dead on 3rd hook anyway, so there would be no point. They could just reduce the number of survivors you can kill with an ebony, though.

O I N K .

Are you saying that we are seeing through his body or something? Photosensitvity only means how much does something react to photons so I don't see how blinding him in the "face" makes any diffrence then lets say feet or torso region.

Yes it's when you switch [core] platforms
---
It might prompt you about syncing cloud data, just make sure you get your old data back
---
Oh lol whatever the word for “gets burned by light” is
---
I wouldn’t say raging at it.  But he was just ragged on it the entire game.
---
Me and my friends played probably ten games to try and get this achievement and finally got it against a baby Huntress who failed to hook any of us even once. Even in our best games before that, we reliably lost our first person with one or two generators left and another shortly after the last one.
---
Get a better group. When I got it we did the achievement on our first try and then did it another 2 or 3 times just for fun.
---
he complains about everything if hes not getting constant 4ks. i cant stand going into his streams anymore

I live in the EU but I play with Americans all the time. I say I'd have decent enough internet to try gaming with you. I try to play for fun and mess around alot so I end up deranking alot and never keeping a high rank. That all good with you?

* Uncivil behaviour. Please be respectful towards other users.

thank you

I'd like the idea that the killers aren't working with eachother, but instead are trying to sacrifice the most survivors.

My bad then. When I last played that mode I was under the impression that 4 survivors and a killer were needed.

I think it would just be a burn because the heat is what is actually burning you so I guess if he is easily burned then he shouldn't be able to play in some maps and some parts of maps.
---
Not really the same thing. I don't understand the survivor entitlement here. Were you not expecting a horror game when you got Dead by Daylight? You should be on the edge of your seat. You should feel like only one of you might make it out.

You changed button prompts to hit skill checks with X?

Idk if this is different on pc, but on console, if you spin just before the stain is on your back, you can dodge a killers lunge almost every time. Bad killers will get tilted and keep trying to lunge (aka this rank 21 Spirit), good killers will just swing.

---
Is it or is the a lazy attenpt at the fact on average there is always 1 player that dc and devs refuses to punish players abusing that
---
Yes. I feel comfortable that way. I work on the generator holding RT and hitting skill checks with X, therefore I can do it with one hand. Sometimes I eat with one hand and do a generator with the other lol.
---
I haven't seen it from the survivor perspective, but i think it's actually offset from his hand as we can still JUST see the blade spin after a hit

Same, dude. Sorry Bill and Ash but I gotta cover some wars

That's genious. I don't like Dead Hard being on A, might change it to X

Fixation,urban evasion, lightweight, and diversion are my favs for stealth

This community suffers from the same problem war thunder does, where everyone wants other factions nerfed but doesn’t have an issue with theirs being OP.
---
I don't really get the "well you don't play against red rank/'optimised' survivors" thing, as if matchmaking didn't place low-r killers/high-r survivors together constantly
---
If a build is shit why not tell the person so they can improve with a better build? Not everything works right together.
---
Nice, I hate when other survivors fuck with me lol
---
Ima do that for now on

Some people just can’t be helped I guess
---
I\`m playing her a lot and this what I would like her to be. Currently she is joke and "OIINK" meme.

Yes because keys requiring gens to be done AND to find the hatch is op.

Why did you queue into the match knowing that you have to pee?
---
or if it happened during the match, do you really have to go the moment you feel it?
---
One time I was mid struggle and spilled my coffee on myself. Died pretty fast on that one.

They claim to have a few plans for to punish DC's once the update to make this a server side game is fully live and they can actually track DC's properly

Best outfit yet

My dead hard is B.

I vault/drop pallets with A.

Keys are annoying as shit but they aren’t overpowered or whatever just sucks thinking you have someone dead to rights then poof
---
Thing with OoO is how absolutely fucking broken the perk is no matter how you put it unless the survivor is bad. On swf infite intell on the killer. (If you run this perk you have 99% of being ignored by them and have perma intel on the and there is nothing the killer can fo about it. And if they chase you just fucking loop them. Only killer to pose a threat to this is nurse (spirit is countered by the fact her aura is removed when phasing) and even then if you are in a tr no one sees the aura so it doesnt matter at that point. 
---
And the absolute worst fucking offender is how stealth killers just dont have a fucking ability or stealth agianst this perk unless its tier 1 micheal. It is so god awfully designs and ruins the killer experience 99,9% of the time
---
Watched a streamer bring a skeleton key in a swf group and getting 60 escapes in a row..
---
Cause I used to think Doctor was the worst killer to go against when I was starting out, and now I always anticipate a 5 gen chase with him
---
Shit, I stop playing for a couple of weeks and I lag behind the trends.

Does the fact that ""ahem sound"" is in quotes mean they say "AHEM SOUND"?

No blood points, yes you can play with a friend
---
I like your flair
---
I mean, you've kind of screwed your teammates over by letting yourself die on the first hook... If you need to so badly that you can't wait to finish a match, either go before you queue, or see your GP cause something ain't right.

shatterd bloodline. best killer in the game as of next patch, and deliverance.
---
I am sorry, but the dev get there money though adding more and more disgusting cash-grab tactics for stupids ! Likle battlepasses, soon lootboxen and other garbage shit ! Not because of good balance !
---
run whatever perk you want and do whatever you think is needed to win
---
i personally dont  like noed because i rather use perks that will help me stop survivors from completing all the gens
---
Found the ruin
---
I should clarify that I didn’t mean this specific example, just that in general players want their faction to be powerful and the other not to be. At least that’s how it seems.
---
Telling them once  or a couple times is one thing. Ranting about how shit it is for an entire game and how its a low rank build is different.

I’m kind of new, how did you mori her in the healthy state?
---
I should've underlined the video with this song lol
---
That’s really short for this game
---
I was playing with 3 Steves. One got knocked down before 5 mins into the game and they all disconnected simultaneously. Was a big bummer for me because I knew I was dead lol. When I'm killer and everyone disconnects I try to give the last person an opportunity to rack up points or survive, but I understand that's not every killer's play style.

We all wanted shirtless Myers but BHVR gave us pants-less Myers instead. I’m not complaining.

Michael Myers has a purple add on called Tombstone piece.  I'll just copy and paste the description

Tombstone Piece:

A fist-sized granite piece taken from a broken tombstone.

Kill healthy or injured Survivors with Evil Within III.
---
Disables the ability to stalk with Evil Within III.
---
Killing a Survivor considerably drains the power of Evil Within.
---
Considerably increases the amount of evil required to reach Evil Within III.

Note: Tombstone Piece does not stack with Fragrant Tuft of Hair.

🤡👍
---
Use your imagination.
---
Am I wrong?
---
Are the servers like this all the time?
---
I'm happy when this get's punished more for killers and survivors. DCing is the biggest bitch move you can do and just shows you are a pussy (Personal reasons and DCing because of exploits and glitches not included).
---
Same. Got a purple rank to say I'm using cheats cuz I could hear them running around injured
---
Right I’m sorry you sound so stupid right now. The VFX team and designers,illustrators ,animators and so on are qualified in those areas, yeah? Now them working on hair animations does not affect dedicated servers at all. Shocking right, that’s why thy have separate roles. As you said they’ve been working on dedicated servers for a while but DLC’s and patches won’t affect the time it takes for dedicated servers. Can’t believe I have to explain what a job is, do your local bin men come and do your dental work after they’ve taken out the bins, then educate your kids on Uni level Astro physics.???
---
They have a point. You screwed your teammates.
---
How are they not the same thing? And how is this Survivor Entitlement? Survivors got a free extra life with insta heals, and Killers get a free game and an entire round of de-pips with an Ebony Mori just because they've hooked the person once the entire game. Unless the killer is dog shit (Which, I don't see very often in high rank, because it's only Spirit/Nurse). I mean, at least with Devour Hope I can argue the counter play because it can be broken at any point, and it actually requires the killer to get more then one hook to get the pay-off. 
---
I'd be okay with Moris staying in the form of Devour Hope, Rancour or Tombstone, but I just think Moris are pretty BS, especially for how easy it is to get them in Bloodwebs.
---
Well, falling in rank means that you're going into a more appropriate rank. In theory. The emblem system is bad, so not always.
---
DEranking is deliberately lowering one's rank to bully or, at best, SWF with newer players.
---
&gt; You should see your doctor
---
Because he needed to piss? xD
---
This happened to me in game. It was awful
---
Yeah good observations, it’s definitely not just something I say to be funny. You sure got me!
---
I feel like the question people arent asking, if the legion went to the bathroom, would all four be there doing their business?
---
Now put next to a gen
---
Ahhhhh that makes sense. Didnt think about that, thanks!
---
Did she do the bones? Because if not, that hex NOED (No One Escapes Dad), is not going down.
---
I feel like Steve should screech and make the sound he does when he's hooked
---
On ps4 when the killer drops from the game during the loading screen, all offerings are wasted and not given back to the player.
---
This is because killers do not want to play certain maps.
---
You're in for a scare.
---
I’m talking about how they spend the money on fixing hair animations instead of using that money to hire new people to help with the dedicated servers/patches. Yes I know there’s separate jobs.
---
#OI, JOSUKE
---
My bad about the hatch spawn thing. I guess it spawning with one gen left was a bug a while ago or something.
---
In my experience the only way to counter a key escape is to kill the person  with the key and to hope they aren't on coms or to kill them all before any gens are done.
---
As for what you said about multiple escapes being rare: for solo players this is true. But at rank 1 where every game is swf it is very easy to get two escapes or more. 
---
What me and my friend do when we go for a three man escape is easy:
---
Person with key doesnt take agro and is immersed (p3 claudette is recommended)
---
Rest of the team use bond (key holder doesnt need it but can bring if they'd like)
---
We ignore our other teammate. If they get hooked we will unhook if we are close but we wont flashlight save him or anything.
---
If the killer has Franklin's we hide the key in a corner of the map.
---
As soon as hatch spawns we all start looking for it (key holder must be immersed but others may run.)
---
When one finds it they sit on hatch and help the holder find it thanks to bond. If someone is being chased or is hook the non key holder takes a hit and bang all of us are gone.
---
This strat is yet to be stopped, even at rank 1 (unless its spirit, nurse or a mori). 
---
Is it toxic? Yes. Do I care? Lol no. 
---
Until they nerf that shit I'll abuse the hell out of it and the fact that they never will because people actually think its fair is amazing XD.
---
Bake is not an escape
---
A friend and I went on a whole discussion on how it’d be cool to see Frank as a survivor. Then the idea of a whole chapter with a plaza from the Willamette Mall as a map with a psychopath as a killer. I also thought it’d be cool to see psychos as skins like Adam the clown for the Clown, the veteran for the Trapper, and the cultists for Legion.
---
Kindred right now specifically states that it trumps any of the killer's stealth abilities, so I hope it will keep doing that
---
I've played a game vs 5 survivors before... never got cursed with 6.
---
Lol, learn to adapt yourself pussy. I say this as a killer main. Haddonfield also isn't that hard, it has many advantage points for balanced landing but that's it. If you have just a bit of skill you'll know how to play Killer on Haddonfield
---
I mean flashlights don’t really take skill after you add some addons on it also to be fair most of the addons for killers completely change your play style and take skill (obviously this depends on the killer though). I’ve seen new part used once in my 200 hours but regardless hitting skill checks generally isn’t hard unless you get fucked and have it at like 5 o’ clock. Keys are basically luck based you either get an insta win or get fucked by rng and have the killer get your or the hatch first
---
Time for the dollar store!
---
Agreed 100% it’s ridiculous. And tbh most of the time it’s people that rage quit immediately after they get downed FOR THE FIRST TIME. like they haven’t even been on the hook yet?!?! You could wiggle free SOMEONE COULD SAVE YOU. I just don’t get it. Play the damn game or get banned for abusing it
---
We’re going in a cycle now, the amount of money that they spend on labour, licensing, all that shit is covered by the overall revenue from the DLC. They make profit from it and overall have more money in the long run so they can help the dedicated servers.
---
The Entity is almost hilariously lazy as a plot device. Any power can be a gift from the Entity. Any backstory works because the Entity can just torture anyone into killing.
---
I was joking when I suggested it, but when are we getting Evil Dwight as a Killer, since that's totally possible with the way things are written.

It honestly seems so lose lose at times you play as fair as possible yet still get called a camper or tunneler not all survivors are like this granted but the negatives tend to stick more like why do I even bother trying to be nice Aka: be somewhat decent of a person and killers will be back
---
I didnt down vote you, but just because you are polite doesn't mean people can't disagree with you.

Where's the other 3 Legions?

Might be dumb but wheres ghostface
---
What???? The flashlight addons barely do anything at all, at most all they do is just extend the amount of time you have. How do they not take skill when there is literally a specific small time frame that you have to nail to flashlight save someone?
---
Why would anyone donate to streamers? Because most of the twitch users are lonely and nobody considers their thoughs
---
Kids would fanboi the shittiest people. Tru3 is so fucking fake, he does the opposite of what he says
---
There was 2 gens left
---
I now have to cleanse it, even though it's probably Haunted
---
Gen rushing as a term is dumb but i think it the best word to describe to absolute speed of which gens can be completed( thats why i use it i dont blame the surv its just a good word to desrcibe the issue)
---
I did 2 out of the 3 gens that were done
---
Yeah, that's the "something" players were entitled to. I'm just wondering if, legally, they COULD delete a Killer and pocket the money, not if they ever would.
---
Or, in that vein, if they lost a license somehow, could they replace a licensed Killer with an OC version?
---
To nerf a mori I would suggest making it so that moris can only be used once that survivor has been hooked once AND has repaired at least the equivalence of one generator (not in that order) justified by escaping the hook and progressing in escaping would anger the killer so much it would activate a mori. This would also reduce tunneling since you can't stay on one guy's ass all game if you want to mori them. I expect that at that rate maybe one survivor would get morid per 1/2 generators completed or less.
---
It’s likely a slow point.  Everyone grinded 2x 2 weeks ago.  We have shrine/rift/Halloween event in two weeks and the chapter isn’t fresh anymore.
---
Devs are not allowing have more than 1 legion member in one match
---
Once a claud, always a claud
---
It's not considered lightborn, it's just that you flashlight her and she gets stunned like every other killer.
---
Maybe
---
Stop watching him, there is better streamers and people around.
---
No, that's for the Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden update. Michael Jordan does it even though he's tall enough to reach the hook.
---
Like before the game started I drank a a liter of water
---
*Sad Oink*
---
I hate those people
---
You are being toxic and complain. Something wrong here
---
I barely noticed the Pig ears lmao, great job.
---
A Killer like this would be interesting though. "The Amalgamation".
---
Oh, so that's how it's supposed to work. I've only ever seen "orange man bad" on, like, actual critiques and informative posts, so I thought it was like a general "I don't like the thing you're saying," rather than for calling out laziness.
---
I know but all 3 are different people
---
😭😭😭noooooooo pips😭 what will you  ever do about your pips 😭😭😭😭
---
I think they just messed up the matchmaking with the latest patch then. I've been put with people like 6 ranks higher than me but I always assumed it was because of me playing SWF.
---
If there is someone hooked during the endgame, I go for the unhook, expecting to trade places with the one on the hook. Now a basement hook during endgame, big yikes. 
---
I think people forget that this game is asymmetrical which makes us think of things as fair or unfair. The game is designed to pit survivors against players. People's view of fun and fair play are all different. We are bound to run into conflict because of the style of game. This isn't a shooter with equally sized teams.
---
Think about how often you don't get a message from a survivor/killer? Or at least don't get hate mail. People who had a bad experience are more likely to tell you that than someone who had a good or okay time.
---
Right, and there's still 2 more gens needing done, as well as opening the exit gates and helping other survivors that get hooked...
---
I'm just excited to finally make a reliable Rancor build with ghostface. The perk fits him well and I love his mori just never liked getting outed by my own perk
---
That's weird. Only cowards DC against Trapper.
---
Alright, kindly tell me how I'm being toxic, I've specified situations I've been stuck in, my thoughts on them and etc. If anything came off as a complaint, it was meant to be an opinion
---
Looks like a party over there!
---
Behavior knows what's up.
---
There already is a punishment, not getting your points. They need to be more severe, dc'ing has become a meme and some of the top streamers can take some blame for that, they do it for the shock reaction of the crowd, which normalizes it for quitting when you don't get your way. It's really stupid that a person can twist their brains to justify it as a way of winning, when it's really just the lowest and saltiest form of losing. It is supposed to be addressed after Dedicated servers get implemented, if that ever happens, can't happen soon enough....
---
For example, Michael  in tier 1 carried the aura immunity before the demogorgon ever came out with the undetectable status effect. Michael in tier 1 is invisible to kindred, so I believe kindred doesn't work on for those that have it. Kindred I think only trumped wraith's cloak and insidious. Now it just trumps insidious unless otherwise.
---
Maybe if you make 100 more posts on it itll happen
---
Oh I didn't notice that xD
---
Bruh you killed him lmao
---
whoops wrong floor
---
Lies
---
Xbox can't capture anything over 5 minutes unless you're streaming. I was hoping I caught the whole match, it went so fast
---
No hammer all chainsaw! Make it so it doesnt instadown but he can cleave hit with it.
---
Wow its amazing
---
I disagree I see how stupid I was
---
beautiful
---
You talk about business but clearly you don’t understand that you have to take risks. Imo opening up more servers will only make the community grow especially with all the shit they add. You can’t expect new players if your servers are already limited. I think you have lack of knowledge by thinking so single minded. “It won’t show a difference”. If they have an increase of 100,000 players over three months but their servers can’t handle it then yes it will show a difference and impact performance and those new 100k people will claim this game is trash. Then they lose 100k as well as the profit they could’ve made with those 100k. (Btw this is just an example, not saying that it will be 100k players). Why do you think they’re adding season pass and archives? The want more new players to join and gain the attention.
---
Honestly, this just makes it sound like your entire group is smurfing. If you actually play at a high ranks, even with a swf, it's not common to see all 5 gens done with no deaths, then enough time to go find hatch, still with no deaths. I honestly doubt any killer who actually belongs in rank 10 or above would actually allow this. Either you're trolling or got stuck with a low rank killer still learning the game.
---
Well, not the dick part.
---
I just started the game last night, friend gifted it to me for my birthday. I started with Demo. It's actually really fun to play as such a looming creature. I've had two crashes, a SWF (I think that's what they're called right?) a survivor ragequit and two games where I managed one kill. I even apparently legit scared one dude because he'd never gone against a demo before and he had a really hard time getting away from me. lol
---
It's honestly been really fun, but I can really tell who has played a huge amount before vs newbies like me. I kinda wish that derank thing wasn't a thing. it's weird.
---
Bruh people literally asked for one. You’re the asshole. Also it didn’t get too much karma so no, not farming karma
---
I try to place portals in between 2-3 gens so I can cover the whole map and have decent pressure on all gens. Cool down addons are really good IMO. If you want to you can also place portals by hooka and run make your choice, but I find that to be a little tougher. The 'russian roulette' build works pretty well on him too if you want to give that a try and well! 
---
As for the shred, I use it to get hits quickly, and to down the obsession if I have save the best for last. Other than that, you can charge it up to deny people windows/pallets to put them in an easier place to get hit, or get them to drop pallets early and break it faster.  That seems to work for me! 
---
My general build is BBQ/ruin/surveillance/thrilling tremors or surge, but there are some other builds out there that work well too!

On pc it's the opposite. PC has slow killer matchmaking and fast survivor
---
That’s completely hypothetical. You’re quitting to “save time” to go wait for another lobby.. in which there’s a good chance if you do this on the regular.. you’re just going to DC again. You’re wasting more time spent trying to find “the perfect match” realistically than just playing the match in the first place.
---
Will need excessive rubbing anyways.
---
It’s a ptp game so no servers yet and yes

Imagine being a bitch bc someone chooses to play a game on a different console
---
I use it cause isn’t she like 15?
---
Imo if ur killer play how u want ur objective is to kill its not to make it fun for survivors i use to play as "fair" as possible and ive been widdled down to not careing now since im on a team of my own i dont have to care about others i just gotta look out for myself
---
New ship confirmed???
---
I have a 1st class honours in Business and management and a 2:1 in economics, the whole point of enterprise is to take risks. You are un-educated on the matter. Dedicated servers aren't intriguing for buyers of the game and isn't a deal breaker, it wont bring in more players like the licensed DLC's. They're making their money whilst they can. They aren't adding archives to bring in new players, as it's all cosmetic based, just makes the game more and more money.
---
I stated what I did, I'm not saying what I did was okay, I'm definitely in the wrong here and I'm accepting that, there was definitely room for improvement on how I played and I will take that into reference for future games. What I'm more concerned about is how I'm being called the entire cause for a set of survivors dying. 
---
The general rule of thumb for if someone is camping, leave and don't let them have another kill, this person did not and put me entirely at blame for securing a kill. Their actions based on that was nameshaming me multiple times instead of facing the fact that it was a game, which would have made the predicament easier for both the survivors and myself. Less time wasted on getting a lobby, less time wasted arguing over potentially nothing. 
---
As I said I was slightly in the wrong for camping them, but their reaction was slightly overboard in the context of a video game. Then again a majority of society seems to take pleasure in blowing certain situations out of proportion.
---
Feel free to make more excuses how this thread is something I've made just to complain on.
---
Can we just stop altogether trying to police what perks people use?
---
It’s more consistent than Ruin. Every match it will always do the same thing for the same amount of time, no exceptions. Ruin is more of a risk/reward perk, it has the potential to do more than Corrupt can, but it’s dependent on you defending your totem long enough for it to be effective
---
If both are spamming the action, killer closes it first. If both find it, the killer cant hit the survivor otherwise they escape, so without them closing the hatch first, it's a free escape for them. While isn't exactly fair for the killer.
---
Lol. You're high if you think this game is even 10% as toxic as league.
---
Welp, this is day 1 of posting this meme, out of 100
---
What a fucking legend
---
The point is, is that flashlight saves need to be done at a specific time, there is no addon that helps you do it at THAT specific time. You can't just stick a brightness addon and then expect to do it whenever you want.
---
Love it!
---
Stalker With a Crush:  
---
You become obsessed with a particular Killer. When within this Killer's terror radius, they can hear their own terror radius as if it were 30/10/15 feet away. In addition, everytime the Killer hits you, gain a token. For every token, gain a 1%/5%/10% increase in action speed, up to a maximum of 5 tokens.
---
scyptic now applies borrowed time effect instead of insta heal. Syringe heals 1 health state after 8 seconds
---
"Do you like horror movies, Ghostface?"  
---
"oH NO"
---
Alright try looking at it from OP's point of view. Killer has little to no chance of catching someone at the exit gate. The game is over. Someone made a mistake and got hooked in the basement. OP knows that the survivors can accept that 1 person is gone, or they can use their perks/tactics/whatever to try to get their survivor off the hook and out the gate. Sometimes this game doesn't seem fair, but that's just how the cookie crumbles. 
---
I don't think my responses nor the responses from OP will change your view, but I want you to try to take a step back and look at the situation objectively. I understand your view on the killer's actions, but they are all part of the game. OP didn't camp the hook all game. OP secured a sacrifice in the endgame.
---
Lol shitting louder
---
S t o m a c h
---
On pc some games go by in 4 minutes...
---
Everyone talking about mori's and I'm just sitting here like: Can we remove Prayer Beads. Playing for 3  hours and I got 4...  Idk if it is my anger or my Heart who has been jumping out of my chest when getting pulled of a gen.
---
In your post history you tell us about a killer being toxic because you gen rushed, looped and blocked him so he didnt get a kill. And now you, the same person but as killer now, complain about these survivors who behave like you. Something really really wrong here
---
Well that's new... Does this happen during game?
---
I definitely won’t say there isn’t reasons to DC at times like harassment or getting glitches out, the issue is people who don’t know how to distinguish valid reasons from themselves just being lazy, shitty, easily frustrated etc. Then those people see people with valid reasons and use that to validate their stupid reasons like getting downed once and quitting.
---
Yeah that's cool, but for me its unfortunate because I am stuck at Ranks 1 and 2 therefore, I don't see a doctor. All I face at high ranks are Spirit's, Nurse, Huntresses and occasional Anti-Gen rush Freddy.
---
I was asking you but if you need me to imagine it then the point stands. Whores very very rarely would ever wear bandages for clothes
---
it is prob just a desync issue. before dedicated servers the survivor could be in mid animation and it still closes on them now that killers are no longer hosts they are sorta seeing what survivors kept seeing the devs are going to have to find a new way to polish the hatch game
---
Yeah, but what if she doesn't play dbd
---
So if my foot hurts the solution is to cut it off right
---
Silence from every direction!
---
All you have to do is play badly and never down them. They will never leave.
---
P.S. if you bring any offering that looks scary, they may run away before the match starts.
---
You see quitting as winning? .. Uh...
---
Man ill tell u what if u run thatophobia,nurses calling,hex ruin, and save best for last ur op just stab dont think about stalking just stab healthy people
---
great format
---
But they are still the same killer, the legion.
---
If things worked that way we would have "the frank, the julie, the susie and the joey" instead of the legion
---
when you have a good billy game and chainsaw everyone quickly and 4k with under 20k bloodpoints

Look at that thread count 😍

Oh God I'd be all over this

Holy shit lmao
---
Sooz /s
---
Bra cosmetic?
---
Not to this degree though. I was in it for over an hour today. I had my daughter keeping check for my while I was doing bits and pieces, and there was nothing
---
Those trigger on lockers?!
---
doc would laugh
---
that at least takes a bit of time from the killer
---
Does she get to cleanse it for the BP?
---
Honestly a scoobert doo chapter would be really good
---
well 3 gens were done and this is likely not a high level game so that could have been like 15mins lol
---
I did recently, but after that I haven't seen her for a while.
---
Yeah I comically exaggerated a little bit. But seriously, my entire life in the US I have seen literally zero people carrying or eating a baguette in public (outside of a restaurant). In Paris I saw several every day. And Paris has Brasseries and Cafes on like every other street corner, and they smell amazing.
---
I really dont get this joke
---
Yes! Getting instadowned by one hatchet is gay
---
I was so confused when this happened. I just sat there staring at my screen. When the struggle phase came, the lag was so bad that I couldn't even struggle
---
If you take the big stall, you can all use it instrad of dealing with the inferior tiny stalls.
---
Shitting aside, I don’t get how her lore makes her a worthy killer. The way she’s described she fits more into the survivor category. She wanted to help the sick
---
yes they trigger anytime you dont move or do an action for 1 minute
---
Charms should be coming out with the new patch along with the event. That’s all you’ll get though
---
Hex: Happy Birthday
---
Would definitely end the game!
---
I've seen flying hatchets. Is that enough for you?
---
it takes 90 seconds for the audio queue
---
Meters, not miles lol but trust me, with how terrifying he is 8 miles seems legit
---
I got your point and i know how it feels. But it is really whack if you know everyone else will escape and you force 1 kill. Sometimes you just have a bad round and you should accept it. Instead of being a dick for 1 kill, just let him go or hunt him and it will be a healthier environment for the game
---
Is that really a problem right now? Because I have lost so many 4ks to a scenario where all the requirements are right for a grab out of a hatch but it just doesn't work and I hit them instead.
---
Holy fuck rofl
---
Or get turn on
---
Knew that but thanks for the locker info
---
Yep,been happening for a few weeks now.
---
It always changes my surv dailys to killer dailys,never the other way around.
---
Gotta love having an easy ass "heal survs 3 health states" change to the janky ass ghostface daily.
---
Would cleanse :3
---
Devs have said they want to keep killers humanoid
---
Even tho i do agree that DC-ing needs more of a punishment, it is shit if your game just simply crashed or anything like that..that’s probably why it is so hard to make a fair punishment.
---
You're welcome. I'd prefer that everyone has a good time in the game. I wish more people would share positive or neutral views even if they disagree completely with the post or comment they are responding to. It's awesome that you are willing to take a look at both sides of the coin.
---
That's awesome man! Good job, bet she will love it.
---
Yeah her and Hag (I think) don't make much sense when it comes to their desire to kill others.  Unless they're just entirely vengeful of Hag being angry over her demise, and Plague the same.  Meaning she resents that no higher powers came to her aid so she just lost her mind and said "Fuck it, all these survivors are going to feel my wrath."
---
I would have given huntress belt where she carries the hatchets so he could hold a trap or chainsaw in left hand. Still cool.
---
My fear is my mom seeing here and not knowing what im playing
---
how can a velociraptor hook you
---
The devs have no idea how their game works so most people just ignore the ratings
---
Laugh it up, your the one who looks like an insufferable bitch now.
---
Not saying you're stupid at all, when you gotta go, you gotta go. But teammates have a right to then be a bit pissed is all I'm getting at.
---
Fair enough if you're in your last hook, being camped or tunnelled. But first hook, when there's still a few gens to be done, it can seriously screw the remaining survivors.
---
This comment makes me want it even more.
---
tiara?
---
How are there jokes in a tier list?
---
Yeah you pretty much asked for it. Should honestly apologize to that guy.
---
she's in university lmao
---
Overwatch has a feature where you can rejoin a match you left if you happen to crash or ur wifi dies, that could work just fine
---
I feel as if Steve would be in the 'screeching at the top of your lungs' category. Have you heard him scream? He could shatter your eardrums from the other side of the planet.
---
I know that but what I mean is they do a visual making the 21:9 monitors have a 16:9 play screen with the rest having said visual. It's really annoying having to change to 16:9 from display settings everytime I want to play
---
Maybe it’s because I’m new, but dbd is nowhere near league’s levels. One guy ddosed me because I didn’t ward his side brush as jg. Some people are fucking insane.
---
Platform: PS4 Type of Bug: Stacks of add-ons disappearing. (When normally only  an equipped add-on  would be depleted) instead every one I had in that specific category would disappear after the one equipped expired. As for reproduction it happened 3  times with 3 different add-ons all of which I had multiples of. Playing Killer as Spirit.
---
Lol, i was thinking about doing a joke chapter about dinosaurs.
---
Anyway, the reason why the Demogorgon fits and a dinosaur doesn't is simple. their size. A Jurassic park velociraptor is almost the size of an Utahraptor, which means that is close to 2 m. tall nothing wrong there, and 5 m. long, which is the main problem.
---
Of course they could make it drag the tail like in old depictions but right now it would make it look weird.
---
In before new NSFW subreddit created for him.
---
You improve yet?
---
I’m really sick of all these memes with the caption in the title ffs
---
Freddy is a pedo ?
---
where's the joke
---
What I do is if you see someone on a gen than 99 the and go for the grab, if they see you coming then just stalk and get the one shot, hope this helps in some way
---
Thank you for looking at it from the killer's perspective. As killer, I would carry the second downed survivor to the exit gate. That's because I like when survivors escape. It isn't the objective of the game, but that's how I'd respond to that situation. It would give the others a chance to unhook. Perhaps OP feels like the killer only wins if the killer kills. This is killer versus survivor after all.
---
Hahaha
---
I’m pretty sure he was tbagging the demagorgon, if he picked u up in front of him, chances are you would have gone down straight away

Am laughing at idea of Demo in a stall.
---
Welcome to why dedicated servers are bad no longer do u have to worry about urs and killers connection to each other (example 100 ping) u now have to worry about ur connection to the server and the killers connection to the server (lets say both of u have 75 ping each with server the ping now is basically 150 between the two of you) and because the way the game is the server has to send info like a pallet dropping to the killer but on the killers screen hes hit u by the time the pallet falls and stuns him...u get the same bs on hatches if bother the killer and survivor find the hatch and stand on it before it opens the killer closes hatch but because the server hasnt updated the info that its closed the survivor gets to jump in it
---
S C O O B E R T
---
Killers on console at higher ranks only know how to tunnel. 80 percent of my matches are killers tunneling and proxy camping hooks. The other 10 percent disconnect when they lose more than 1 chase.
---
Great game devs!
---
*slaps survivor head*
---
It hold many träp, bröther
---
the addons being changed will change to their new rarity, just like the wraith's coxcombed clapper. All the ones in people's inventories went from brown to pink.
---
The game is shit, especially on ps4, like 85% of the dcs are either people crashing or getting disconnected
---
Pinhead or the tall man from phantasm would be fucking great.
---
Hex:RUINed the marrage
---
This killed me.
---
Because the way this game is setup, there is always going to be 2 sides pitted against eachother. There will always be arguements about the other sides since they're so different. It's honestly sad, I wish everyone could just play and have fun
---
I kinda wanna get the game on pc for that reason. I miss playing survivor but can't stand que times.
---
I’d say instas are basically the same as the old Mettle of Man. It’s just a free health state. It’s insanely good for keeping the killer from building pressure.
---
I know my friend
---
So pip back up. You're good enough to be in reds, so just go back there.
---
It’s the slowest possible Myers you can have, I think. I forgot what add ons you’re supposed to mix, I think it’s the one that keeps him in Tier 1 because it slows down his speed a bit, while also using the one for infinite Tier 3 because that considerably slows down his speed. 
---
Basically it’s called BK Myers because he’s so fat his slow ass can’t catch up to the survivors
---
I think doc nurse and wraith should switch with the top 3
---
You can't get hatch grabs.
---
This is real footage of me in game.
---
Ew why are you running Unrelenting
---
Never Open Exit Dgates
---
Yeah, I mostly stalk people doing gens or healing who don't see me, because it saves me the 2-hit chase. Also, Is he really playable at high ranks?
---
Thats a you problem, noob 😎
---
So you’re justifying you having to do more because other people want to do less? Tf

It’s funny because his girlfriend does ASMR so I guess people go to his stream to pick up the negativity and then go to his girlfriend stream to release the negativity lmao
---
Trying to force people to play more killers? Haha
---
I've played both  and gotten salt and toxicity much more frequently
---
There are still better options but yea, I see that this could be an issue
---
but still time between queueing up and the match ending should be enough for someone to notice that they have to pee and hold it for the rest of it
---
2 people escaping isn't that spectacular, in fact it's literally the dev intended balance of 2 die 2 escape.
---
Beautiful
---
You shouldn't stalk period, 2 hit chase is always better then the stalk, most of the time you don't get to expose anyway
---
so if they are quick, the killer wouldn't see the crow
---
and if they were not, 90 seconds for a notification and then the killer has to make their way to them. This actually helps other survivors a lot
---
People even play Trapper at high ranks, it's just about learning to play an M1 efficiently and knowing the Emblem system fairly well.
---
That's why everyone is happy
---
Fragrant tuft of hair and judith's tombstone? You madman you actually did it
---
Me wanting Jason (👁👅👁)
---
You mean everyone but the killer mains.
---
But does it really take that long to piss? Just quickly hurry to the bathroom. 
---
If the killer chooses to kill you while you’re AFK then so be it, but not even attempting to hide or something did kinda screw his teammates.
---
UNDERWEAR
---
I almost heard "Mmm watcha say" at that grab.
---
David 'FUCKING' King, has a ring to it. I like it.
---
It's so much worse. Just play at green ranks and you'll understand
---
No one escapes death, happy birthday!
---
He wouldn’t play it though, right as you knock you’d hear the Erie theme and know you fucked up
---
Oh no he went foraging for those skulls, too!
---
I played all lol
---
I’ll take one Mr. X and Leon, please
---
“I’ll just go the other way.”
---
i felt this as a 3,300+ hour player it hurt
---
Nurse is still S tier I’m not sure what you mean by she got trashed. I have seen nothing but positive reviews from the people who have been playing the PTB. The devs “pander” to all the crybabies in this game that’s why insta heals, DS, &amp; MoM (just to name a few) got reworked. You sound like a bully yourself tbh.
---
I think I got to cleanse it
---
 Noed.
---
Very true.
---
so the judith’s tombestone and the other add-on which doesn’t let you past tier two but let’s you see the auras survivors when you use your stalk ability, so t makes you really slow, but he didn’t know that it’s burger king Myers, which means he genuinely thought that it would work
---
That means we should start investing in that blood web for match boxes?
---
Joe = Haunted Ground
---
I’ve played both extensively and DBD is nowhere even close to League’s levels of toxicity lol

Not really, but i cant change the mind of the mindless like you seem to be one, so move on !

I'm not justifying it, I'm saying it seems really trivial. What do you get by being in red ranks? Disconnecters, apparently. There's no benefit you actually lose by being in Purple for a game or two.
---
k, I guess?
---
Gg
---
Your wife knows my Ruin location. I'm going to have to tunnel her now.
---
I want Pennywise and I want him now!
---
*BP whores want to know your location*
---
Gets you to a more balanced game quicker.
---
Nobody asked
---
Ah I see. Just another person who wants to come on here and complain but not actually have a conversation. I’ll move on when I feel like it Slumber but thanks for your input.
---
No
---
Plague would screech or say occupied
---
Little brain plays
---
Oh sucks they took that out
---
Even the killer mains knows she's bullshit. Been at the S tier for years
---
Wasting the time of the other players is a win
---
One time someone’s hair got left behind.
---
Both go extremely well together
---
People who DC enough get tempbanned. The punishment goes.
---
1 week -&gt; 2 weeks -&gt; 4 weeks -&gt; Permanent
---
Well, that isn’t the only thing getting rubbed tonight
---
Where have you been
---
LoL has much more toxicity, while DBD is pure of saltiness from both sides, especially from green / purple rank tho.
---
I am pig and I can look up.
---
Not a bug, PER SE,  but please OH DEAR GAWD fix the fact that "fast vault" and "dead hard" are the SAME button combo on console.
---
Also fucks up when trying to throw a pallet down at a sprint and end up dead-harding back right into the killer.
---
Pretty good....job...so far.
---
Bottom of my heart.
---
I was getting 3 dailies done and got to rank 4 my accedent, but the queue times are still fine so i didnt depip
---
Scrounging about

it be like that sometimes 😔
---
Totally! Mr. X, the original Tyrant, Nemesis... All could be really fun with unique powers!
---
couldn't relate more to this. Too damn accurate
---
Nah that’s like destruction 10
---
Destruction 100 is when you break a pallet with fire up 3 5 stacks, and brutal strength 3
---
k
---
Just imagine Nemesis blasting pallets with his RPG lol
---

Thank you Kanye, very cool!

Break it for bloodpoints!
---
If anyone has seen Terrifyer, I think that clown might be neat.
---
But I think there's already one clown. That's enough. I second Pinhead as well.
---
You ever just feel bad for survivors and tunnel someone cause they keep alerting you to their teamtes postion and sandbagging and everything
---
this is disgusting i thought there would be ash 5/10 clickbait
---
Nope, we are fine with it
---
That makes sense. I didn't realize it. I'm sorry if anyone got angry at me and i didn't know the reason
---
*proceeds to "doing gens, you? While the guy distracts the killer*
---
Cardboard it seems
---
This is oddly terrifying and amazing at the same time, bit of a role reversal and I love it.
---
It’s contributed percentage. So if you and a buddy did 1 gen start to finish each, you each get 50%.
---
Yea no

The only thing that annoys me about this post is that I can’t freakin see which killer you used.

---
My body dysmorphia: you look like this
---
thats for kyf, to accomodate spectators and people switching roles
---
I’m getting this too, along with all my friends. Unless you restart, it happens in following matches against non spirit killers, so spirit fucks something up
---
🤮 Legion
---
Great pack but can you make the perks more colorful?
---
I remember playing Bing Bong on low ranks. It's not even funny how many people DC'd on the last hook. They could stay in the match for 10+ seconds, but they prefer not earning a single BP instead (assuming they did know DCing made them lose a lot more)
---
This is definitely incorrect, play league in ranked Gold- Plat and you'll be on suicide watch
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
Good example, and great usage
---
Yes completely, dcing a game to deny a game mechanic is completely uncalled for, If the killer dc'ed because he saw a survivor heal someone for a full state then everybody would flip the fuck out. Dcing in general, (unless it's for personal matters) is an asshole thing to do. It's toxic.
---
Candy man would be a cool addition to the game.
---
i second this motion
---
Actually I believe Dwight would say "Occupado".
---
I think she will break it
---
At least it’s in a meme format this time. Still posted 87 times every fucking hour
---
Yeah he uploads every single game and puts clickbait titles on every single one :(
---
They were entertaining for awhile but like damn.
---
These are all ugly
---
yo I just watched that and hell yeah!
---
I bet these people who say DBD isn’t as toxic as LoL haven’t played it in years. I play LoL and DBD frequently now, and yes, both still have toxic players.
---
League has far fewer though. In gold ranks, it’s rare that I get a dc or a troll cussing me out. It’s usually at the end of a long night of games and it’s my cue to go to bed.
---
I get dc’s constantly at green ranks in DbD and the trolling / flaming is through the roof. True talent recently had entire teams dc-ing against him when he ran iridescent head huntress AND NOTHING ELSE. No other perks/add-ons, and the entire team left. I too, have games every now and again where everyone dc’s, when I’m not even using good add-ons. When was the last league game where EVERYONE rage quit? Exactly.
---
Then again... I’ve been told it’s quite peaceful at rank 20, so maybe that’s where all these commenters live...
---
BBQ = best perk waifu

I thought she viewed the entity as her new diety to follow, which is why she does as it wishes of her.

Same bug since May, Wounded Healer trophy is not obtainable and is bugged. Wish someone from BHVR community team would actually check this thread instead of dicking around on the discord.

Then what’s the point in using them?
---
No One Ever Does (Dulls)
---
No one escapes door
---
Yes. If my wifi dies and I spend 10 minutes fixing it, I will happily join the game again. No. This isn't Overwatch.
---
A sekelton=tool box?? Didnt know that toolbox can cheat you a win against a killer who is winning
---
Most of the time when you are winning as a killer against decent survivors ,you gonna have 1-2 gens left and 2 survivors alive ,those survivors can cheat the 2 gens with a key and escape ,taking away the win and pretty much black piping the killer
---
That sounds fair to you?
---
League is 1000% more toxic than dbd will ever be
---
Very nice! How much time did it take?
---
ghostface killed Steve also ghostface hates him 😎
---
They all contain white so im ok with it
---
Julie is the cutest (Susie too)
---
Also congrats on hitting rank 1!
---
I used to try to get under everything to pick them up. Sadly it never happened.
---
VERY satysfying
---
It looks awesome, great job!
---
There's a tragedy alright but its neither my game play or the survivors unfortunate play. 
---
Hope your day gets better, cheers.
---
Just not youre style. We get that. No need to call someones artwork ugly.
---
it is a gift from the God-Emperor of Mankind
---
Yeah gens are hard to find in badham
---
I really like these ideas. would use in game for sure. 👍
---
Meta for me would be Enduring, Bbq, Ruin/Corrupt, and play with your food.
---
Either make fully charged shots one-shot while making it charge slower and giving her some form of penalty to her movement while charging so she gets penalized if she winds up a shot at a bad time, or rework it to give a nasty effect to a survivor hit and take away any penalty it has. Hard to come up with any descent or creative effects for Huntress though, she is just too straightforward when it comes to gameplay.
---
Haha!
---
True. True.
---
I dont know, i play in global at csgo, and dbd rank1 doesnt even come close to the amount of "i hope your whore mother gets raped by your stepdad over your dads grave" as csgo has (had that exact insult)
---
Looks like we aint gettin 2018 myers anytime soon
---
Why wouldn't you join again? By that point it would be better to just hop back in and get your bloodpoints
---
Almost all indoor maps are disliked.
---
1000 survivors
---
VS
---
a killer that sees all survivors auras all the time and can mori you just by having you in his line of sight
---
The only trap I placed that wasn't used was on the compound harvester. I didn't think I would be playing Basement Trapper lol
---
I’m sorry are you literally asking if incentivizing all players to play both roles will somehow make queue times worse?
---
Gen rushing is a term used by idiots who don’t know how to play the game, gens are the survivors ONLY objective what are they supposed to do just run in circles and let them you kill them?
---
Hm, that makes sense. Thank you so much for the tips, I'll keep em in mind. Turns out playing as killer is harder then I thought
---
How about you give the creator at least a shoutout instead of stealing his work.
---
Trapper or Wraith, arm looks like Trapper but weapon looks like Wraiths lmao
---
These are all super cute!
---
You dont have to like my stuff :) perfectly fine! Not everyone has the same tastes
---
Daily rituals changing? Had to sabo 3 hooks... finished it, no notification that it was complete, checked daily rituals and it said “Be chased for a total of 120 seconds with Bill”
---
That would be nuts! 
---
Does she vomit serum?
---
My guess is Wraith but I’m not sure.
---
His mori could involve him feeding bees to the survivor
---
actualy that could be interesting, and imagine then someone picks up a suvivor and trapper fucks the over by making them step in a trap and stealing the suvivor from them
---
On trapper and hag, yes. On most of the other killers no, unless it gets cleansed obviously.
---
Thats the one of the main ideas for these
---
At the time of posting I didn't know who the Creator was. This has been posted in the comments already. Stop reposting comments.
---
Is there a way to filter out shitposts on this sub?
---
instead of the current 1:4 ratio pushing for a 1:1 ratio could indeed have consequences, yes.
---
Yeah the icon definitely isn't Trappers so I'm like 99% sure Wraith
---
Also Matchmaking at its finest :D
---
I wonder if this Spirit knows how to not lunge
---
Like...  from his mouth into theirs?
---
I like them
---
Of course, I play for fun and experience more than anything, after all, rank is just a number in this game
---
Simultaneously buff him so he can edit the map however he pleases. Freddy would now be creative mode ala Minecraft.
---
[OP here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bhrnla/new_perk_discord/). Could you please not repost this? You could at least give credit.

''Honey? What's with this effigy?''
---
You should change your flair to Locker, it would fit with your username so much
---
I think it's less of a 'killer' and more of just someone who unintentionally killed their followers.
---
I would kill for those hair styles, and as in kill I mean sacrifice even more survivors to The Entity.
---
I don’t care what killer it is, I just want new perks to play around with.
---
It must of spawned on the gen again..
---
*Ahem sound* sound
---
tier list of how much perks *slow the game down* : highest category: *just a lil' bit*
---
Weren't headshots already a thing being considered?
---
Playing killer is nerve-wracking but somehow it's more satisfying when you win rather than when you're a survivor. Enjoy playing GF, he's a fun killer to play and go against :)
---
She said "Ghost Face" 5 times in the mirror for you
---
If it glows it goes!
---
Great job! Looks fantastic!
---
Commodious toolbox with spool+socket swivels is way more OP than a key too. People complain about keys being OP because it ends the game abruptly but if you think about it multiple toolboxes are way worse problem than a key.
---
If you think that's a problem the  it's all good, no fun in teleporting from gen to gen
---
Stole from my friend who has Ifunny so.....
---
Bloodpoints gain has no impact on the emblem, the wiki lists co-op repairs as having no benefit to the lightbringer emblem.
---
Honestly don’t see anything wrong with what you did, I do it all the time. That one kill could be a safety pip because we just lost, I say fuck people that’ll try to flame you, if your not face camping or tunneling with 5 gens done you aren’t toxic. I will say I play both sides 50/50 now and it’s way worse when a killer is toxic compared to survivor. Both sides just need to accept the loss and move on the next one. More times then not the guy you just killed pipped or double pipped so it doesn’t matter anyway.
---
DBD is not that toxic
---
[deleted]
---
Baby ghostfaces trying to expose you mid chase or stalking right in front of you
---
Just adorable
---
She's pretty
---
I need the puffy pigtails 😍
---
I think what would happen if it does work is you pop the medkit and if you don’t get hit you just get healed but if you do get hit, it gives you deep wound and the syringe heals the deep wound but still leaves you injured. I think it’ll be like this because adrenaline will, if you are injured with deep wound, heal the deep wound but still leave you injured so I think the same applies to the syringe.
---
You dont understand. You get a message "Destruction 100" on the left side of the screen each time you break a pallet, its about the amount of blood points you get.
---
Gimme an S, gimme a P, gimme a I, R I T. What's that spell? School spirit...ha. ha. : ^ )
---
That’s fucking worse
---
*Pumpkinhead :D
---
I love it.

Yes, you need to unlock the perk again by levelling up Bill.
---
"Attempt"
---
Well I've played many games with this skin and this bug happened once in the menu, in game it's fine. And yeah they never make skins that changes how the power looks, maybe they will one day :)
---
Oh it’s all happening so fast
---
Hi, terrible spirit here.

Halloween 3 will take forever to come out

New map: Open field with a single tree :)

Just happened to me like twenty minutes ago from a red-rank Kate.
---
Pinhead!
---
Also trapped, wraith, billy, and leatherface
---
Hag, nurse, wraith, trapper, hillbilly, bubba, doctor, nea, ghostface: *sad forgotten noises*
---
Do you think Pinhead would have any problems finding hooks?
---
Sorry sir, the pre school is off limits.
---
That ain’t groovy. I’ll just go the other way.
---
Thanks bud
---
Oh wow you do make your own memes. Look, one of my friends sent me this. I didn't steal it off YouTube I stole it off Instagram. Look at the file name.
---
Compared to league, dbd is WAY more toxic. I played thousands of hours of league before picking up dbd last month, and in league I've never been personally attacked like with this game. Sure, people were loony and spammed stuff like "kill yourself you loser", but people literally go to my profile and rally together from dbd just to talk shit.
---
Thank you kind sir/lady
---
Truth be told, yeah. Can't wait for some real Candy from Candyman~
---
I asked, punk
---
Well... yeah. I've seen some waaay better
---
My poor nea mocked again xD
---
Ok just please credit the creator somewhere. I hate seeing when an artist gets no credit for their work
---
You're probably right lol admittedly it's been a while since I've played and I don't look too into the lore!
---
This is an app for discussion and i wanted to discuss this. 
---
So yes.
---
If you see them on a gen
---
Look around In the comments you'll see it.
---
If you go on my profile and see my friend's trapper you'll know whats an attempt
---
What is the point of a ranking system when you end up going with the rainbow? At this point it's just to give you a feeling of accomplishment.
---
Yeah, I've had three killers DC on me today when the match wasn't going their way. Four including the one Michael that DC'd the second we spawned in on the farm. Takes long enough to get into a lobby as is on ps4.
---
There’s a new one coming out in 2020.
---
There was a time I encountered a Jane who was wearing an exact same outfit combination I love.  It was the blue suit with her hair down.  I looked past her the entire match and let her escape... XD
---
I love how survivors underestimate the killers tracking senses.
---
He’ll only follow my scratch marks!
---
Turns he was following your blood trail and your grunts cause you forgot to pop insta heal.
---
Oh? On god?
---
So cool !
---
Ghostface, he's a spooky boy
---
Check r/dbdLFG
---
Wraith, they can completely come out of nowhere and destroy you.
---
I prefer BBQ, cause of blood points and I'm bad at finding survivors. Ruin is very nice, but I prefer to have fun
---
I see, I just think maybe you yourself should give some form of credit. Too bad you can’t edit reddit titles
---
If they do I hope they get the license from Novel first for two reasons. One, the novel is more violent when depicting death, [example.](https://youtu.be/MyyHEVmn8bE) Two, this would give the devs time to secure the likeness of the actor’s face for DLC.
---
As a major fan of the series, I hate everything Rob zombie did with the franchise
---
Oh damn nice.  Needs it desperately.  Surprised to hear about Red Forest though.  My only problem with that one is the sheer size of the thing.  Takes forever to patrol gens.
---
Blendette wants to know your location
---
Ikr or I would have.
---
Moris shouldn’t be fully removed since it’s a waste of animation. Maybe ebony should only be able to kill 2 survivors. But keys don’t have a purpose other than punishing the killer for killing 3 survivors and closing hatch.
---
Yes. Halloween Kills in 2020 and Halloween Ends in 2021.
---
This was just a random suggestion anyways, I'm just trying to think of possible solutions, no need to get so bent out of shape about it lop
---
Looked at it and it's still better than what a lot of my friends could do lol
---
And good job with the "attempt" lol
---
I think he was trying to be safe helping you.. totally fucked him over D:
---
Well, my friends "motto"
---
No fun without Ruin
---
But personally, I prefer BBQ, makes it easier to get Ruin later
---
It should be tbh, that "I'm SiTtInG sTiLl LoL oUtPlAyEd" shit is so annoying. She should at least have to use her power to force someone to vault into her.
---
Put it on the nightstand in the bedroom. Then u can have. Hex:DevourAss
---
nice
---
Discussion, exactly. Not whining how you are unable to ignore someone streaming and how they stream
---
Unless you're his manager, even in that case this isn't the place to do so if you are.
---
Thanks a lot
---
Under community info there is an option to turn of memes and shitposts
---
Look at otz tho, he discusses everything and tries fan builds all the time. Idk Tru3 isn’t fun to watch anymore
---
Yeah, Rob Zombie fucked it up. I think the idea of Laurie being his sister came from his movies, I still like how Michael looks in the pic though, I like the idea of how he never moved on from wearing different masks and shit
---
She's a lucky wife.
---
I desperately want a fucking viable original killer.
---
Pyramid head zombie from silent hill is best boi.
---
Good job, rank reset is tomorrow. DON'T COME BACK.
---
This is great! Where did you get the bones?
---
Then there’s the fnaf fans crying in the corner wanting Springtrap, but being told no.
---
hex: marry me
---
Would it be dumb for survivors to be granted 1 less gen that needs to be completed for every dced player?
---
Agreed, which is why I let them still get points or if they want to get killed on a hook I oblige. DCing though hurts the killer and throws away what points you got because someone else wanted to be a dickhead. Punishing yourself and punishing others because someone else can’t deal with their own failure isn’t the way to go about it.
---
I thought you were the original commenter. Even so, why are you back on the tread?
---
"You may call me a 4head now, but I'll be the one laughing when the killer has no noed."
---
Urban is not s tier
---
Adren s+?? Adren is a decent perk but it’s so rare that you reap all of the benefits. It takes up a perk slot and is useless until end game. You also have to get all the gens done, which doesn’t happen every game. If you’re left with one or two gens every other match, it’s a wasted perk slot. Not only that, but it only works properly if you are injured or slugged. Yes you get effects on hook if you are unhooked, but that becomes harder at end game as killers are more likely to stick around hooks to get people going for saves. So it’s only effective 50% of the time once all the gens are done, which is what? Maybe 1/4 games? A perk that is useful in only 25% of your matches isn’t really that great imo.
---
I'd rather have Kevin shields if we're gonna have MBV representation
---
Did they call you a nonce or say you fuck kids?
---
Kreygasm I LOST
---
I don't use it either personally but I feel it is a crutch perk for survivors with no real counter play for killers.
---
Of the top of my head, I think that these perks should be higher:
---
Wake Up (better now with the EGC), Q&amp;Q, Unbreakable, Tenacity, Bond (so much information in one perk), Iron Will (probably the best survivor perk imo).
---
I'd rate Calm Spirit, Detective's Hunch (at least until the buff is live), Streetwise, Mettle of Man (genuine F tier), Sabo, Solidarity lower... There's quite a lot I disagree with here actually lol
---
“It’s Cool Guy!”
---
What hex is that?
---
**Bea**
---
Bond C tier???
---
I occasionally play Demo but I don't have enough Perks on em yet.  Plus I don't find them as rewarding or entertaining as other Killers I play, sadly
---
This was not a support post. It was me talking about an on buggy match I had
---
DBD is straight wholesome compared to League, and even Overwatch.
---
Very noice
---
Fantozi is a good friend so I'm probably gonna sniff around a while longer due to freedom to do so :) thanks
---
Also does activate if you're last standing when they close hatch. My biggest reason for the S+ is because killers don't have a truly reliable way to counter it except NOED
---
Lithe is not on par with balanced and dead hard. It's good but not as good as the other 2.
---
Urban evasion is bad, not sure why it's in S.
---
We'll make it is like kinda meta, yet it's below self care and sprint burst?
---
Noed is the counterplay to it.
---
I think it’s one of those perks where you either get very little use out of it or it’s super crutch. I used to run it and would only find it useful maybe in 1 out of 20 games. I prefer using perks that I can use throughout a match rather than just once.
---
The only perk I disagree with placement massively is Left behind, it's a solid solo survivor perk as you can find now more easily and with a key it's a gurantee escape also it kinda makes life easier if you get potato teammates as well mentioned find hatch way faster and keys and stuff etc etc.
---
Fanztozi is amazing! I watch him whenever he pops up in my recommended :) I'm also going to stick around a while, maybe repost some more, idk.
---
That happens when you play Freddy.
---
Someone missed the whole "havent played in awhile" bit
---
Like spongebob pinhead?
---
I played league for over 4 years and honestly you're right. league is a shit show and is rotting more and more each consecutive day... Now I'm regretting having spent like 300 euros on that shitty game... 
---
At least when survivors are toxic it's fun xP
---
The counter is to not let them do gens. Even against a good swf you can still get a proper 3 gen going. That’s the best part about playing against that perk. The counter play doesn’t make you detract from your main goal, which is gen protection and sacrifice
---
urban evasion is higher than deliverance, bond, iron will and we''ll make it?
---
Dunno, I play a lot of both League and DBD and I see more DCs / complaints than on League, but its not irregular on League by any stretch.
---
yes
---
Whenever this happens to me as killer I hit the unhooked to slug and create pressure but chase and hook the rescuer.
---
Mettle of Man is pretty easy to use still. Block a hook while killer is carrying someone and you'll get your protection hits in no time.  Remember, it's also about counter play with this list. Street wise can be easily countered with Franklin's and even overwhelming presence. Calm spirit is really only that great against doctor and clown. Detective's is great if you need to find totems without a map but once updated it'll easily be an A tier
---
NOED only cause she hates it lmao
---
Trappers who watch a lot of Otzdarva videos lol.  Seriously I've faced some scary ones with mad genius trap placements and you just watch it snap around your ankle and go damn I can't even be mad that's a good fucking trap.  Respect.  An out of their mind Trapper makes you second guess and fear every single loop and vault.  It can be nervewracking.
---
Well credit the creator and people wouldn't have a problem. It's pretty easy to do
---
Can you imagine an item so powerful it can very circumstantially create the target balanced outcome for a match (2kills/2escapes)
---
Fun fact: You're supposed to be able to do all 5 gens and still all escape. The entire point of the objective is that it's supposed to be reasonably possible for Survivors to do but still challenging. Yes the average Survival rate is 2 but that accounts for all the games where everyone escapes as well as all the games where the Survivors are potatoes or memers and die within the first 5 minutes of the match.
---
If you really have trouble doing gens equip Prove Thyself and possibly Better Together / Bond. Also get one person to run Small Game or a map so you can find Ruin easily. Then just bring toolboxes (possibly with Brand New Parts) and just gen rush. If you're even remotely competent at stealth or looping you can easily get all the gens done while one person loops the Killer, and then have them run to the hatch (with Adrenaline) and all escape.
---
I really love how when Killer complain about gens being done too fast they're told to git gud and apply more pressure but when Survivors complain about gens being done too slow and not being able to use keys for an achievement we're supposed to universally agree with them. But "lol r/deadbydaylight is a killer-sided sub guys."
---
Can't wait for this post to be downvoted as well because immersed rank 7 Survivors can't do gens.
---
Give him a trapper and he wont use traps, he'll just lay them down to get rid of them and forget about it.  
---
Give him Ghostface and he'll never stalk  
---
Give him low tier, Doc, Legion, Clown, Wraith and he'll say "See this is why X killer is so bad"  
---
Give him any perks he doesnt like, and he treats it like a no perk slot instead of getting creative with it
---
Otz and Fungoose is where its at.
---
Oh my god! Legion? He is like, the easiest killer to cosplay, go get a life noob! (please do not take this seriously in any way shape or form)
---
&gt;Sole Survivor rated above Object of Obsession. 
---
Trolling.
---
Oh my god, that’s neat
---
bones from amazon, sticks from outside, everything else from michaels
---
That is true, more or less I'm thinking along the lines of its actual activation. You can't STOP the heal or the burst of speed without heavily guarding gens
---
Iron will is S tier
---
Balanced should probably be slightly lower as something as simple as a map can counter it.
---
Probably top A tier or lower S tier.
---
Just play a character you’re bad with. I had to play as Nurse for the mori challenge and it brought me up to rank 9.
---
&gt; You basically told me
---
Oh, you're one of those psychotic broads that goes based off of assumptions. Never get into a logical argument with a woman, because they'll never reciprocate LOL
---
I slug the person unhooked so the “rescuer” doesn’t get a safe unhook
---
tru3 is just the great value shitty version of fungoose
---
.....but bubba is in it
---
Me wanting more cosmetics for jane that make her look thiccer
---
Clown, might seem like a odd choice but holy moly are good clowns scary, "oh you got a loop, denied. oh got a window tile? Have fun getting hit?" They just know when and where to through bottles and it's terrifying
---
i heard that perks coming out in the next chapter too lol
---
I figured he was an easy cosplay so I chose him lol. Also I just like the way he looks not even just that he’s easy to make.
---
You can be full health and at a pallet and killers will break off an injured survivor they almost caught to get your thicc ass
---
i personally believe ruin is slightly better than corrupt, but corrupt intervetion is also a VERY good perk and you should get it still
---
Only reason I did that is because with the upcoming changes to all the stealth killers,  OoO is going to be more risky than anything. Sole survivor is great because as long as you remain alive their aura reading won't work which is great since a lot of killers have aura add on perks anymore
---
Awesome!
---
Thanks :)
---
Wraith with silent bell and the add on that delays his terror radius for six seconds? Nightmare fuel

Wow, basic much? God, find something original to do! (also sarcastic, please don’t flame me with downvotes)
---
This might be the best looking one I've seen on here.  Great job looks awesome.
---
I put it at B just because yes it quiets you but most killers are looking for your blood trails and scratches anyhow
---
I Just imagined the singing Cowboy in the sky screaming : AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 🤣🤣🤣
---
once i had everything it took the afternoon, cause the sticks and skulls wouldnt stay in place, used a lot of hot glue
---
Now she will break it for blood points
---
Pain-train Bubba builds
---
will do
---
by the way yes, its still a dick move to rescue someone if the killer is very near, even if you have BT. unless you are near an open exit gate
---
I’m fine with it. I’m just sick of getting six of them every single day.
---
This post is the same as people complaing about inconveniences, discussing gameplay ideas. Whats so bad about a streamer discussion
---
I can agree with that. I just like that even without the sprint it still makes some loops actually plausible without the landing stun
---
WW1 actually. Her lore mentions “German soldiers began to pass through, on the march to attack the collapsing Russian Empire.”
---
Meanwhile I’m over here, hoping the game adds in more original killers and stops putting in licensed ones.
---
OoO doesn't reveal you If it doesn't reveal the killer. Only true stealth killers like Ghostface and Wraith are effectively now immune to it. Pig doesn't spend all game or even most of it crouched and unless it's scratched Mirror Myers doesn't go into T1. 
---
It's not riskier, it's just weaker now. Sole Survivior is useless now with EGC since if ur the last one, the match goes by so much quicker.
---
When the plague catches the super plague.
---
A squadette with 4 flash lights
---
I hope so because I have so many styptics and syringes, I think it would be a fun combo.
---
50% ? Lmfao
---
The totem getting the best head is ruin. Change my mind.
---
How about jack from the shining with a hotel map. Also his wife as a survivor
---
I think you and your wife keeps kidnapped people in your basement.
---
This happens EVERY DAY to me and it is so frustrating
---
Ace: UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Legz for dayz.
---
Nope this is clearly photoshop.  I read the dozens of comments on this sub daily that clearly specify that the only killers you can possibly play at rank 1 are Nurse and Spirit.
---
TBH the only thing I think really needs to be done with keys is make them more high-vis. You can quite clearly see when a Survivor has a toolbox or a medkit, and flashlights take time to use so it's obvious when they're in effect too. Even firecrackers aren't that hard to see in someone's hand, especially the Chinese New Year ones that stick out like a sore thumb.
---
Keys however are absolutely microscopic and on some Survivors (Steve) they hold them in such a way that it's nearly impossible to see them. As a joke I said that keys should be lime green and glow in the dark but I honestly think that something like that should be done. You can rarely tell if a Survivor has a key and if you hit them with Franklin's you can't see where they dropped it. (Double edged sword to be fair.) I don't think this would make keys too weak since you can still bait Franklin's out with a broken key.
---
Perhaps they could change the key to a key ring? That way they could use the same "holding" pose as the toolboxes and medkits.
---
I want to know how you accidentaly equip no mither and not notice it
---
Yay mate no worries, I was just being french. Clichés exists for a reason after all. :) I do guess that it must look outlandish to non-frenchs. I'm happy you enjoyed Paris and didn't suffer from the Paris Syndrome ! 
---
For instance, the most french thing to do, is to go buy a warm baguette just out of the oven, and just fucking bite it right out of the bakery, mouthful, eating the crouton, while walking in the streets. We've all done it here. You could even say it's the "privilege" of the person who goes out to buy baguettes everyday for the rest of the family.
---
I still don't know what those are
---
_If it glows..._
---
Vigil is absolutely the worst survivor perk
---
Oink
---
From a survivor standpoint I agree. Indoor maps are trash. However killers may prefer them. I’m not entirely sure. 
---
The only indoor map I don’t mind is the meat packing one. It’s a lot more open and spacious for an indoor map which provides opportunities for both survivors and killers. A bit more balanced imo.
---
my point exactly... instead of making quality content people spam these zero effort things over and over, because it gets upvotes. It gets stale and hurts the community
---
Piggy
---
1 minute exposed?  Are you confusing NOED with Haunted Grounds?
---
Plague
---
Iron Will at B?
---
That would've been a great idea! Maybe for her next surprise
---
I love these tier list memes more than you'll ever know XD
---
Well... I’m not a woman but uh okay... I guess you are not the psychotic person who is going off of assumptions. Your ignorance is showing and it’s truly disgusting.
---
What the hell is that one called cause I don't remember that ever being in the game
---
——^ here we can see survivor who’s not good. And not a fucking “Bruh” to you you little *Bleep*
---
Why is everyone going after spirit now I thought people were ok with her for like ever? Only thing I see as an issue is prayer beads tbh
---
That mask is amazing! Incredible work Skemoo!
---
RIP this was reposted and the repost literally got over 9000 karma.
---
Where
---
its really obvious that you are begging for karma btw
---
The arm
---
I'm playing on Red, purple ranks and 80% games it's spirit. So it quite helpful.
---
Pharmacy is f tier and self care is s tier??????
---
bruh
---
The arms are Freddy and Huntress
---
Bit everyone put downvote on this pic :(
---
So pointless, killing yourself takes 20 seconds longer
---
I don’t really want any more licensed killers, cause most of the iconic ones are in the game.
---
Now it seems we want B &amp; C tier horror icons.
---
Freddy. Because he is definately stronger then pig.
---
Hag's traps, Michael Myers and Ghostface bc of their stealth and there being no noise, and demogorgan bc of his music, sounds, and teleportation between portals
---
shes more addicted to the game than i am lmao
---
I would record a match of me running nothing to prove you wrong but 1. I don’t know how to do so and 2. I don’t want to feed your flames and give you any energy
---
I mix it up a little on him but I like to run Ruin, Pop, STBFL and Nurses pretty often.
---
He just drags Survivors around by his hook hand, Survivors have to try and pull them off while he's chasing them.
---
I think it will be cool as long as she plays the game too or she might pull that therapy card.
---
This post is for you&lt;3.
---
Ruin&gt;BBQ
---
Hag can pop out of nowhere so can doc
---
*If you die in the game, you die for real!*
---
I would prefer a survivor giving me a bunch of points than them just deciding to dc
---
Did somebody say "Add Carrie"
---
No?
---
Just me?
---
Groovy
---
Resilience and This is Not Happening ought to be higher. They excel at gen rushing and hard counter ruin and also if you slap DS and Dead Hard on you have an unkillable injure build it you can loop well

---
It could be a survival mode: 
---
Throw out 20 survivors and four killers in a massive map and add a time limit.
---
Survivors need to hide until the clock runs out to escape, Killers need to hook as many survivors before then.
---
Both sides get more BPs based on how many survivors escaped/got hooked.
---
Individual survivors get a bonus for escaping first, most unhooks, ect. Individual killers get a bonus for getting the most hooks, shortest chases, ect. Both of which encourage healthy competition for the same teams.
---
It would be glorious, chaos, but glorious nonetheless. It’s be the battle royale of survival horror
---
spooky.
---
Jason wasn’t manipulated.
---
He was maybe killed? Then after his mom died he started killing worshiping her decapitated head.
---
Unless the ghost are suddenly a thing the F13, Jason is just a crazy murderer.
---
Welp time to caress it for a few seconds while making disgruntled sounds
---
i like it on both sides of the playing field. sure is a hell of a lot better than The Game or The Underground Facility
---
Still doesn’t fix the issue for the majority of other players in your game.
---
The only fix is removing reasons why people dc
---
Holy sh*t, I just hope that this isn't the ruin totem; well done job mate!
---
Why is her school uniform weeby?
---
lol dbd disconnect, rank doesnt mean much, meanwhile if you disconnect in league you get ban, if you are toxic ( ban), and ppl will still be toxic. "gg ez" in post game in dbd, big wow, meanwhile you have the entire game chat to flame in league, also flame come from your team as well, not just the opponent.
---
Looks great!
---
I thought it was possible to edit your own posts on reddit? So couldn't you just give him credit anyways?
---
Pig will be getting a bit of a buff though. OOO will no longer work on her.
---
No agreed!!! If I get better at editing I would love to make custom profiles for killers/survivors/etc that id love to see. I’d love to see Carrie either a killer or survivor tbh. Not just you !
---
Thank you young sir
---
I really enjoy playing the Pig. I just like sneaky killers.
---
I feel like Candyman would be great, i mean the dude literally has a hook for a hand.
---
I can’t agree. The Game and Hawkins Lab both have ways to find gens. I don’t like Hawkins Lab much either but The Game is one of the best maps in my eyes. The verticality is really fresh and the loops are much better for both sides. Léry’s just feels too much like a guessing game (and lets not ignore how hard it is to find totems)
---
Aww you are cute. Maybe you learn someday how to record and then manage to do that.
---
Spirit is strong without adds and is even better with them. I normally run the activation charge time and move speed. Honestly the only tip I can give for her is turn up your volume and be aware of your surroundings. Once you hit someone it is very hard for them to get away without having iron will, assuming you're a decent spirit.
---
Are you here just to be a ass to other people? They haven't played in a while, and is recovering from a serious injury as the title states. If your going to act like this then go somewhere else.
---
Marry me?
---
to each their own
---
pretty sure that's the "just fuck me up man" teabag
---
MOM is terrible considering the fact you gotta block a hook 3 times (a decent amount of the time not even registering) and then having your aura shown after you’re quite far away when healing.
---
Same really
---
I can see why based off the guidelines set. Although the med kit update will probably change this.
---
listening to music while playing gang
---
Dude I’m at rank 8 right now I’m sure I could do it with no perks if I played my cards right. I do t have access to any things to record with but I guarantee once I can I will send you a video
---
Y’all seem Sinister?  Baghuul would be a neat killer I think
---
I only Want to buy licensed killers and buy the rest with iridescent shards
---
Id fap to that
---
dont bitch about mori and noed if you think this fair
---
this is cheesy ,undeserved win
---
Won't hold my breath little man. Go go .. your mom said that it is bed time already.
---
I think everyone is burning all their instas right now lmao
---
This is awesome! Would totally love it if my husband did this for me as well. Hex: good husband!
---
Thank god theres no child survivors
---
I bet this is red ranks too. That vault is about the level of play usually found with survivors.
---
Lol
---
Trash talking is fine, what gets me is how a person can ruin the entire match for you. In csgo you can kick them or carry them, and if they'll get kicked if they TK or damage you too much. Idk but even playing with a troll in csgo is MUCH more bearable than in dbd. And that was at SMFC before I quit for esea a few years ago.
---
Maybe other people disagree but I just mute trash talkers or laugh. In Dbd a survivor can drop every pallet, lead the killer to you, and then just disconnect. Your match is pretty much ruined due to how it works.
---
Self care a tier
---
Freddy would have a field day if there was
---
Hard to make fun of someone’s age when they’re actually 13 and you’re actin like an 8 year old

t1 myers does

All hail the God-Emperor of Mankind!

How dare you

People still find that funny?

If that pallet stun landed on me I'd be salty.

Any fix on this yet? Still happens to me every game lol

Me: wanting BHVR original killer
---
*Working as intended*
---
On the desk, you can see the typical BHVR employee, ready to nerf pig again.
---
I think old school NOED lasted 2 minutes but the hex perk NOED lasts until you cleanse the totem. Killer has a small speed increase along with giving the survivors the exposed status
---
Username doesnt check out
---
I'm so excited for that, now to nerf moris and keys
---
I’m in the same boat on PS4! I don’t think tank has anything to do with it either, because I have a hard time finding games as both a high-ranked killer AND a low-ranked survivor.
---
RIP Ghostface
---
That's a very true point
---
Sad thing is, I recently faced a swf team with all object of obsession and I really wanted to die, if only I actually had third seal
---
What trait she lose if you destroy it?
---
&gt;(&gt;.&lt;)&lt; SOOOLLAAAR FLAAAAAIR
---
💋
---
&gt;Haven't played in a while
---
It's been 4 days. I gave up the game for a few months and I came back kicking ass. If you can't take a little criticism then I suggest it's best for you to leave.
---
You must not be a fellow gay
---
Damn I’m dumb I swear her arm looks like his
---
I'm pretty sure that with Project Resistance, Capcom will be able to include their characters as survivors/killers
---
stealth killers auras won't show
---
Stop simping it’s not gonna her you ass
---
I cant really see it as super complicated but maybe it is? It would awesome though
---
Depends on what lore you believe, originally he wasn't going to be a killer at all, the creator wanted him 'to be a victim, not a villain'. But the original made a lot of money so that went out the window lmao.
---
The ghost thing is actually widely believed, especially after the F13 game came out and you hear Pamela urging you to kill when playing Jason. Friday the 13th lore is pretty convoluted, one of the more 'common' theories is that Pamela used to necronomicon to bring him back, which is why he can't die anymore and also how he's suddenly alive again in the first place. 
---
There was also a ghost child in Jason takes Manhattan that haunts the final girl, so yeah, ghosts are a thing.
---
All my most wholesome games/messages seem to happen when I play GF.
---
Idk what it is maybe survivors just love shitting themselves as opposed to holding M1 and looping pallets all game
---
Ideally you want to play with someone who is also new, otherwise it's going to put you against higher ranked killers.
---
Goodluck on the search!
---
Clown and Doc would laugh
---
Why does he want u to kiss yourself 🤔
---
is that a fucking ruin??? CLEANSE IT
---
I think ot would be interesting to have her be both killer and survivor.
---
Maybe have some random lore bit where the entity seems to go ravenous due to this girl always being of the verge of hope and despair and enjoys using her as she always provides sustenance no matter what side she's on.
---
Wait so you want to give him an even less effort suped up version of Spirit Fury on every pallet?  I'm looking over at Randy and he said that's a hard pass from me dawg.
---
They’re close, I’ll give you that. However, LF has thiqqer arms and a bracelet/watch on that arm
---
Okay, thanks for the input.
---
Thanks for the advice, have a good day
---
no, why ?
---
She has the perfect time for a birthday.
---
no he just has to work overtime obviously
---
“Attempt”? More like rousing success!
---
We make anything work!
---
That guy REALLY commits to his lunges...
---
Frustrating huh
---
Well, I ain't watching it then.
---
Being broken trumps every healing item/perk until the timer has finished.
---
I'm pretty sure OP was looking for ideas on how to buff the man, not nuke him from F Tier down to...wait..what comes after Z?
---
lol
---
The pig make her dash attack one hit with an add one. When the exit gates are open and survivors have a trap on the timer starts.
---
Give Credit at the fucking least it makes you look like a douchebag.
---
Ruin hands down is the worse perk in this situation.
---
***I want to play a game.***
---
Just because im talking about someone you like doesn’t make it whining bud.
---
IMO the best Claudette skin so far
---
You can actually buy cosmetics from the pass you just gotta wait 6 months I believe after it's over. Besides that pretty good archives review.
---
if someone throws down a pallet, try standing still and watching. They will think you are phasing, so you can trick them into walking right into you
---
So you are actually little kid.. damn should I feel bad now?
---
You tell me
---
Strider is really good on spirit, gives you almost perfect tracking when someone is injured
---
If you're playing Survivor on PS4 then yes, yes it is.
---
I think they said that a while ago but the pip system contradicts that now. Its nearly impossible to pip at red ranks with a 2k. Black pip? Yes. But regular pip is difficult.
---
Never said i didnt like him
---
Just pallet loop the clown killer a few times so he loses weight
---
Hey aren't you the guy who posted the "skins stealth killers get" meme?
---
That's actually rly lit hehehe get it cuz the totem active
---
I experience more of these “DC memes” than I actually do DC’s.
---
How dumb do you have to be to think mentioning a post that is clearly visible on this person's profile is suddenly going to "out them to people they know", as if those people couldnt find the post themselves by simply clicking on the profile... Please use your brain my dude
---
This is promising to hear.  I enjoy the core game but would really like to see more challenges and missions to focus on.
---
A powerful curse
---
Well hag is like a witch, does that count?
---
Hold x (or a on Xbox) on the character then move the left joystick
---
I have that same lamp
---
Yet you're still well enough to be able to play the game. I don't think holding down a button will make much difference compared to clicking it, no? I gave construction criticism, looking to help you improve at playing killer. My way of delivering it may not of been ideal but you have to look past that to see the bigger picture. But, I do hope you get well. I couldn't imagine living with something like that.
---
have a 3 second grace period, if you DC mid-game you'll still be punished but it will make it much less likely that server-side DCs get punished.
---
it really do be like that sometimes
---
Welp, it's pointless that's why
---
You can just ignore the guy. This thread isn't about the game by any shape or form just about shitting on a particular streamer, pointing at him and say "look how shitty he is". That's it.
---
I don't call this a discussion but a circle jerk
---
Oh here's the salty boi who got all mad when tru3 said he had a crappy build, got banned because you wouldn't stop bitching, made a new account, then paid TEN DOLLARS to tell him how great your build was it was all just his play style.
---
Get a life, kiddo. Your build sucked. You got ripped apart for being a snotty bitch to everyone. If you thought he sucked so bad, why did you give him ten bucks to play your build lol
---
I thought dead hard was X on ps
---
Ghostface is confirmed to be using various types of perfume and cologne so his category is prefect
---
[STOCKHOLM SYNDROME INTENSIFIES]
---
We got a a stage 4 clinger with Stockholm
---
not getting BP is not a punishment, it is simply just like you never played a game, it's a neutral interaction.
---
that’s pretty awful and ruins what they are.
---
Cute how I just got downvoted in seconds after I replied.. ty to confirm to me this thread is a circle jerk and nothing else
---
i never said slug the hooked survivor.  even if your proximity camping, you can just go for the guy who unhooked.
---
Why do I hear boss music?
---
Platform PS4 I don’t know if it’s a bug or intended but I sealed a portal for demo and while I was working on a gen he came through the floor where I sealed the portal and it made a new one
---
pyramid head isnt a zombie tho
---
It's super fun stunning the killer and being hit through pallets still anyway, I dont know what you mean
---
I like that it's in the game, but don't jump for joy when I get it unless I'm Myers.
---
That's actually dope
---
She gonna have flashbacks and instantly go to cleanse it
---
If you dc, 30 minute ban. Done
---
if that's the case i'm more comfortable with the pass. where did you hear that?
---
r/technicallythetruth  
---
Get it. Cause you LITERALLY get 100 bloodpoints in the Brutality scoring event labeled "Destruction"
---
Perfect
---
Plague with add on that shows aura when there sick it’s either cleanse and get sniped or a game of hide and seek
---
I really hope they don't have the bits float. The only reason I use the City Slicker body is because it's the only body that doesn't give Ghost Face away super easily.
---
6 months is so long. I was like to buy the pass instant, but after reading some different reviews I  feel like I getting too much forced to play. They said 1 hour per day and for me that's too much. Some people can only play on the weekend or a few days and then they feel the pressure to complete everything to earn the things they want and can't play the way they want. I feel like they should do something like a second way, which is for the people that have not that much time. Like they can choose 5 things out of the whole season that they want and the rest is picked randomly and they can only go this road which is faster (like 70%) and you get less for the faster way (like only 30% of all cosmetics)
---
I was rank 4 in this game and I believe the killer was in purple. I didn’t look behind me because by that point I knew how she was playing and I could clearly tell when she was about to swing. And finally, just posted this because I thought it was entertaining. Thanks for all the comments and discussion, always good to see.
---
Never underestimate the silent Bing Bong
---
I just always took the Pamela thing as him being crazy like she was.
---
She kept hearing his voice but he wasn’t dead as far as we knew by the ending.
---
I don’t remember the ghost child in Part 8 though, but I don’t remember much of that film. Lol
---
The hell are you talking about lmfao
---
Stop bringing survivors to the hatch.
---
Done, big boy Bubba is back on level 37.
---
in red ranks yea probably, it is purposefully made harder to pip in higher ranks. You think all 4 survivors are pipping with the way you're escaping too? Doubt it
---
You’ll keep all your addons- it’s just they’ll all be changed to their new versions, which includes their rarity. This exact thing happened with Wraith and Freddy.
---
Imagine another survivor using her as a bridge
---
I like it, but when it's a doctor or someone with the trapper perk for harder skillchecks in terror radius, I hate it. It's not like I miss the skillchecks, Its because I get forced to pay more attention in skillchecks.. and.. skillchecks are borring
---
Yeah, it looks like the top of the wailing bell
---
Fun and interactive gameplay thank u bhvr
---
You're entire trash attitude is from, what? The swing at the start of the video? Hahaha you're entire shit attitude is from my accidental swing because I winced in my seat trying to shift. 
---
That would have been an ambitious hit with a lunge regardless and I couldn't tell yet if she had Dead Hard.
---
1000 iq move : Using Claudette to bridge the gap
---
I think it’s an overall cool map, but my frustration with it depends on who I’m playing. If I’m Doctor or Myers then it’s great. But if I’m Huntress or any chainsaw dude, it makes me kind of want to DC.
---
360s kinda work sometimes now that there are dedicated servers, survivors look quicker
---
majority of posts are circle jerk, when they talk about toxic this and that is a circle jerk. When they talk about of "how good i am" its a circle jerk. The only not circle jerk in the myriad of circle jerks is asking for advice. Streamers are related to the game as the main source to learn the game, since you're on your own after the ingame tutorials
---
I think that "Undetectable" should counter Spine chill, as well as OoO. Undetectable is temporary effect, after all.
---
He was teabagging the demo, trying to Agro him. You misinterpreted and sandbagged him.

I'm honestly amazed that you have positive upvotes when I don't. Even though your opinion goes against what people want.

I think this proves that Reddit looks at your comment history for problematic opinions before upvoting your replies, even if it's something they agree with. :/  
---
Children are still developing. And they are easy to influence and bend. It's easy to get them scared if you know what you're doing. Even if their fear would be irrational, they wouldn't know that. Their minds haven't evolved for advanced thinking. This is backed by (what I recall, anyways) biology.
---
DESTROY IT IT'S RUIN!!!
---
Dude I don't care, I'm not turning this conversation into some all-encompassing conversation about what perks should be doing what or whether they're op, anti-fun or otherwise.  
---
NOED rewards bad plays from killers. Thats it.
---
I apologized them for tryharding after the game. Said sorry that they could not win because of killers in 2k19 xD. All I could do T.T
---
I know right? Jeez, it’s almost like top tier killers are the only viable killers these days smh
---
Make it deplete 50% of the toolbox instead of the add on. Two hooks can be a hook prevented. Usable but not terribly strong
---
Trying to get her to cleanse your totem?
---
Eh he’s a good killer he’s just out shined his ability is sort of boring thoe bring a clown I love it
---
Thank you for not leaving it on 925,000. I give my respect to  people like you.
---
become one with the basement bubbaz
---
Demodoggo is oppressed, he's a pretty little flower :(
---
she looks like she shat her pants
---
Someone dced on me yesterday on last hook, they played for a good 15 minutes and probably would have gotten 15 or 20k if they had just let me hook them and died. That amount of time is wasted on nothing. If you don't value BP, then yea it's neutral. If you play to earn BP, you are screwing yourself out of that time spent grinding
---
I’m sorry, I must break it.
---
how is mettle of man c tier but kindred D
---
you callin the hag's fashion sense terrible? great hair, titty out, living her best life is what fashion's all about
---
He is low in the rankings, yes. Not a bad killer but one of the worst applying map pressure. Very few ppl play him. I'm one of them, but among the 5 killers I play regularly (Freddy, Clown, plague, myers and ghosface), he is the one I struggle most with.
---
well done :)
---
Ching Chong your opinion is wrong
---
What does my profile show? If you really looked into my comments and into who I am, you'd find I'm not as bad as a person you've judged me to be.
---
And me leaving this platform is an ongoing debate I'm quietly having with myself. What I say to others shall not affect that.
---
I bet he shit his draws irl lmao
---
Gotta get that bread-points
---
With how little people actually sabotage, I’d say it’d be very niche.
---
That's the problem with most of these tier lists.  The game is completely different at all levels.  
---
Dead hard, Head on, balanced landing and adrenaline are great for Purple/Red ranks but will not be effectively utilized by most white/green ranks.
---
Devs stated it I believe from what I saw from what everyone else was saying and checking around a bit(I've heard people say 6 weeks but the majority has said 6 months so idk)
---
Better not be haunted grounds! Lol
---
That’s very thoughtful
---
The last few Wraith skins have been phenomenal. My wallet is crying.
---
She probably did, Bubba is really scary lol
---
it's normies
---
Can I borrow some of them shards?
---
Only lvl 40 btw
---
...so if you aren't touching the ground, hey? Hmm, interesting...😈
---
He had a really good point... why the fuck do yall keep watching his stream, keep subscribing, just to be jackasses? Who the hell has that kind of time? You don't like him ripping on your shitty build, don't subsvribe, don't pay the ten bucks to have him use his build.
---
That whole mess earlier was because he said the build sucked, which it definitely did lol. Either you were the bitch boi who threw fits and got banned to come back later and pay to say how much you hated him, or you were the dude who kept low key saying Tru3 was a terrible person the next three hours.
---
Either way... don't like him, don't watch him. Pretty damn simple. Go watch any one of the dozen or so other popular streamers. Nobody is gonna miss you. Nobody is gonna make you stay. Be about your way and we'll all be happier.
---
Is S/SS Easy?
---
Is this just a product of all the OP stuff from survivors getting nerfed so Killers are moving onto the next thing to complain about?
---
Insta heals have been around for 3+ years and out of no where it's the flavor of the month thing to hate. Is a big killer main streamer talking about it a lot or something?
---
Depends on how long it lasts, if you are good at finding survivor at the start of trial, go for Corrupt
---
No worries!  Rank reset is tomorrow!  That most wonderful time when potatoes get matched *even more frequently* with skilled players because bhvr wants to fuck us all!
---
So adrenaline. Prove me wrong
---
My argument is it's the same as adrenaline. Your point is "I FEEL just rewards bad killers" which isn't an argument, just a feeling you have
---
I prefer facts, I don't know about you
---
Delicious.
---
Finally, some good fucking Hatchets.
---
The matchmaking problem probably has more to do with how many people are playing each role and when they queue in, because of the smaller community on the ptb the skill gap is much larger
---
You also have ds activated
---
lmao you're a rank 15
---
It was in Jason's dream. Jason may be able to subdue his fear of water in the real world, but in his dream, he's just as afraid as everyone else would be.
---
Come on, the one time I don't take borrowed time...
---
I hope so too. Loved the series adaption of scream.
---
The first movie  was actually good tho :/ idk abour the 2nd
---
Looks like Susie got nerfed
---
Sounds like a good idea for a perk, not sure about an overall ability though as I feel like it would encourage people to just hide in one spot or in a locker more often when injured instead of looking for a teammate to heal or playing smart and avoiding the killer in the first place. I'd love some form of this as there are times I wished I had it but as an overall power that all survivors get..... well I'm hesitant.
---
How would this interact with stridor? And would infectious fright and Doctor screams still occur?
---
Is that Maurice?
---
Ahh its nice to see a fellow player do a legion mask from scratch
---
How did you get in that situation?
---
I'd want pyramid head or an original killer as they're always my faves
---
Leatherface looks SO good Prestiged!  And lmao on Monstrous Shrine, that Perk needs a 100%  rework
---
Based on my experience, get BBQ while it is there. Ruin will appear like Deja Vu compared to BBQ.
---
I think 63 killers 1 survivor, everyone does a battle royale on a Fortnite map to decide who gets to kill the one survivor.
---
Until he gets a tux he ain't to me
---
Interesting abstract thought, but I don't think a raptor would fit.  
---
I would love to see Ian as a survivor though.
---
Huh, I’ve seen that bottom bit somewhere else
---
Just wait for for the blight skin to release (event) and you’ll see him a lot more
---
Clown isn't fabulous? K
---
Are you suggesting Survivor's buff? Are you new in the neighborhood?
---
Yeah but she aint wearing any clothes and she so skinny you swear she got lost in the forest and canibilsed
---
Oh man me too
---
No. If you're broken, it trumps any heals until removed, IF it can be removed.
---
To be fair, if it was SWF, the rank 3 is the one to blame for the imbalance unless they changed it within the past week or so?
---
If the killer is close enough to proc BT then by definition the killer is close. Ergo, what you're saying is that using BT is a dick move.
---
Thanks, do you have the rest of the clothes for a cosplay?
---
Clown
---
Sacrificing Pig to the Nerf entity.
---
Try again.
---
Like I said, the lore is really convoluted. IIRC, the original creator wanted nothing to do with the sequels, he was totally against villain Jason. This lead to adult Jason being very open to interpretation.
---
There's lots of comics, books and short stories that deffer wildly. Hell, he even differs wildly in the movies. 
---
In JGTH, his regeneration is due to him being a deadite, but in Jason X, he just has super fast regeneration. Freddy also manipulates him into killing by pretending to be his mother in FvJ. Sometimes he needs outside influence to resurrect, but sometimes he resurrects just cause. 
---
Jason is one of those characters where no one is right or wrong, people get to think what they want. Which is just another reason why he'd be great in DbD.
---
Legion
---
Guess you'll have to cleanse it to find out
---
just learned what it meant lmao
---
So far I have the pants (though not the same ones but dark blue jeans) and I have a gray sweatshirt and a black one to go overtop (for the grey hood/black sweatshirt combo) but I’m not sure if it will fit/look right, I still need to try it out. Also I bought medical tape and fake blood for the hands so I’m hoping it looks good
---
First time iv hit red ranks thanks to billy
---
I really can't say anything about that since I don't watch any streamers or youtubers who play dbd, but in my experience I've managed to get to red ranks pretty easily with post-nerf legion and usually hover around rank 3 or 4 with him. At those ranks I usually manage 2 or 3 kills a game. I do definitely play survivor a lot more than killer though, so my opinion might be a little biased.
---
One time the killer ran right at me and fell through a hole in the floor. I felt bad for him, but also laughed hard as I ran away. Reminded me of something I would mistakenly do as killer.
---
What the hell are you talking about? Did i say i didnt like him?
---
queue times are actually fine at red ranks. around 7pm i get instant lobbies as killer but an hour earlier and it takes 10 minutes to get in
---
The council shall decide your fate
---
That is really fabulous!
---
I love using the white burial kimono on mine because it makes her seem older and wiser, elegant and gracefully powerful
---
Easier than on PC imo. I play both.
---
TYL that /s means sarcasm
---
You know he isn't playing Frank, right?
---
He can't... Or else you mean his illusionary self in that case then yes but Hag can also teleport and take one of her double's place.
---
So yes but actually no with a little bit of yes anyway.
---
I've definitely had a few teams wrecked by him. Usually by the people who use the chainsaw to quickly go from one side of the map to the other, although it does look comical lol.
---
Come to think about it the medical taoe is a great idea, hope you don't mind if I steal it =)
---
I'm at rank 5 (survivor) but I really don't deserve it, I can't play that good, I pip pretty often but I don't want to :(
---
indeed
---
Nerf Michelle he’s too strong with that reach
---
Same, and I agree.
---
No problem, it makes a great addition especially if you don’t have the knife. I have a knife that would sorta work but I might get in trouble if someone were to actually report me to police or something crazy for having a weapon in public :(
---
Reminds of the F:13 feature.
---
I agree to a point.  Spirit almost completely relies on two things:  scratch marks and sounds.  
---
Being careful about where you leave scratch marks and staying healed or having iron will is vital.
---
Still, she can just straight up appear out of nowhere with no warning and pull you off a gen.  
---
That said, I kinda like going up against her (even though i know I'm probably going to die) because she and myers are really the only killers that can give you a true "oh shit!" moment.
---
Didn’t i see you in Otz’s chat earlier? Glad you got this game, more players the better
---
K have a great day
---
Good point, have you considered making a fake knife of cardboard?
---
I would love pennywise as a killer. But it would be weird since we already have a clown. (Yes, I know pennywise is a shapeshifter)
---
You are severely overestimating the “downsides”
---
Ooooh that’s a great idea and then I can paint it! Never even thought of that lol I’ll have to try it out and see if it looks good
---
That’s always true :)
---
So Spirits clap you too quick, gotcha
---
pretty epic gamer 😎
---
Well, r/leaksbydaylight will probably have the dates soon anyways.
---
Always wondering what would happen if Myers moried someone at a gap/ drop
---
Not just the men, but the women and children too.
---
Whatever dude deleted his main post anyway
---
The fact that this meme is bad is what makes it good
---
Im sure there must be some tutorial or guide on how to do the legion's knife or some other one that looks similar.
---
literally playable

It’s great when people accidentally out themselves as a baby killer by saying Nurse is terrible now. Like really, “oh my god, she can’t go from corner to corner of a map within seconds AND negate a core mechanic of the game in looping” the horror!!!! She’s still comfortably a top 2 killer, whether you put her 1st or 2nd is up to you.
---
If I'm killer and everyone DCs and leaves the last person, I try to pity them. Has been happening SO much to me recently as a survivor. I am not a good a killer lol. 
---
(Want to add that I don't expect any other killers to do the same, just the way I roll.)
---
Blendette has left the game
---
Tbf You we're kind of a toxic asshole too, looking at chat - if You're calling them trash and laughing at them. And this isn't a biased opinion, I play both Killer and Survivor, not to mention Spirit if necessary.
---
If players Rage Quit, yeah, that's a issue, but the big thing causing random and instant DCs lately has been the fucking servers. I can't play the game because of it.
---
My test is always where have I got insulted more. DBD is just the usual camper or tunneler. League, on the other hand, somebody called me the n-word every other word because I banned Riven. There is no way that DBD compares to League's level of toxicity.
---
Thank you! I appreciate the advice I just want to ask a few follow up questions. 1. Should I equip more ambush focused addons rather than trap focused ones 2. Do I have to uncrouch to grab gen survivors or can I do it whilst doing so 3. What perks would you recommend?
---
Yep, this man doesn't have friends because he isn't a fan of a certain character in a video game.
---
*AHEE-Uugh!*
---
You should always run at least one exhaustion perk.
---
Non meta/ seldom used perks which are useful: kindred, distortion, stake out, we'll make it, resilience, prove thyself...
---
You get flamed far more from your own team than the opponents in League, and both flame you more than anyone in DBD.
---
Removed this has nothing to do with dead by daylight
---
Not an accurate one
---
They were all in a SWF, the only reason he didn’t dc is because he died on hook first.
---
Ok cool thank you!
---
Turns out it's haunted grounds and this is how the husband plans to kill her in one hit
---
Why are you booing me? I'm right
---
R2 i guess
---
In pc is the same button as the primary attack, isnt the same for consoles?
---
You guess, so you are not sure 🤔
---
I absolutely love running Quick and Quiet, Lithe, Dance With Me, and Self Care. I take a hit, run to a gym, break LOS, vault a window and rocket my ass to the other side of the map to heal. Its hilarious when the killer will start patrolling the gym and I'm out in the corn healing. Although i die a lot with that build so I switched it up to Urban Evasion, Dead Hard, Self Care, and I usually use the 4th slot as a flex spot, alternating between Borrowed Time, Fixated, DS, and Adrenaline.
---
If no one answers in here you may be able to find some more recent posts that help a little more! Perk questions come up often, so sometimes they can get overlooked. GL!
---
As long as it's not ruin...
---
No it will do the chainsaw animation
---
Where do I begin.
---
Sprint Burst, UE, Self Care, Distortion, Alert that high? Iron Will, Unbreakable, OoO that low? lol
---
Pure luck. That Spirit seems pretty average to me.
---
Yeah people not actually reading shit. They just scan it and like or dislike seeing certain things without actually understanding.
---
Sorry if this is a joke and I'm out of the loop, but why would a team of survivors do this?
---
I got mine with tomb Myers. Not that I care about achievements at all but I just happened to unlock it lol
---
W Ö T?
---
Youve never played Dead By Daylight?
---
You know its toxic, right? 
---
Here I'll cut you a deal.
---
The game is $30 with DLC that makes you better for around $50 extra, and that's a great price!
---
Anime cliche I believe
---
Swing your main weapon. So R2/RT on controller.
---
I've been seeing a bunch of posts with actual slurs and death wishes on the chat. Does the game not have a chat register to punish this stuff?
---
Maybe an option to rejoin a match you left less than 5 minutes ago? Idk
---
It's not about being good, it's about sucking less then the other guy.
---
Yeah, dude... I think you're the bad guy here.
---
Also do you mind if I ask what rank you are and how long youve been playing survivor? After using Spine Chill for awhile, it will pretty much teach you how to track the killer without it. Once you get to that point, you can drop it
---
&gt;It’s great when people accidentally out themselves as a baby killer
---
Couldn't be any more wrong about that my dude. Nurse is just severely overrated.
---
yes thats why I said that
---
It’s the PlayStation messages app
---
"Understandable, have a nice day"
---
You play clown/wraith/doc and tell me how long it is to go to high rank. Or just tell me if you can get to green rank at all
---
She can now say you ruined her birthday.
---
There's something kind of precious about the toxicity in DBD. It's like a community so dumb it just keeps hurting itself. Myself included.
---
If they DC on third hook, count it as death, and grant the Killer BP for it, but also give the teammates BP for it
---
Sacrifice level BP, not a paltry "fuck you, have a few pennies"
---
If someone DCs from 3 games in a row, suspend them for 15 minutes (roughly one killer queue)
---
I don't use add-ons, so can't really comment on that.
---
Yes, you need to uncrouch. You'll still have a factor of surprise on your side.
---
The best build I know is Enduring/Monitor&amp;Abuse/Whispers/Brutal Strength. Last one is the least important, so you can replace it with one you like most.
---
Best advise: watch Scorpionz on Twitch. He's the best Pig main out there.
---
Plague got herself a headpiece to wear while her flesh was falling apart. Look me in my watery eyes and tell me that isn't dedication to fashion, you coward!!
---
Easy choice. BBQ's increased BP gain makes it better in the long-run.
---
It's ok to disagree but that's rude
---
It’s pretty easy, just takes practice same as any killer
---
Gonna be freaky naughty Michael
---
Me wanting Devan Sawa from Idle Hands as a reluctant killer who cant control his hand
---
So anything that's not OP is useless?
---
I understand that it's annoying for killers, but I'm rank 8-1 usually as both survivor and killer and I don't really notice anyone putting them on too often.
---
We need a CNA killer now
---
Overwatch is sooo bad man. Everytime I finish a comp match on overwatch I'm like "damn, that was the most toxic experience of my life, never playing this game again", but by the time I finish my train of thought I'm already in the next game because it's too damn addictive.
---
Put a trap around Huntress' arm
---
&gt; but that's kind of the point? they're not exactly common in the bloodweb
---
I hate this mentality.
---
So should we keep omega blink nurse then since it's not common?
---
I don't own Clown. Wraith is fairly easy. Can run a powerful build on him and I have never intentionally played doctor to rank up.
---
Exactly, it doesn't make any sense to add Pennywise. If we are being honest, it would make alot more sense if Pennywise WAS the Entity
---
Who you callin pinhead, pinhead
---
U think Freddy’s face looks the best? Mods please ban this man.
---
yes lmao, she's hard to master and I believe if you're skilled with her power then you should be rewarded accordingly so
---
After the lawsuit is done with, they should ass Jason. It's highly unlikely but possible
---
Where is our hillbilly friend?
---
I would also imagine Creepypasta fans are also Sharing the same corner
---
He's not my main so I had no reason not to prestige him, but he's the first and only prestige I'm gonna get.
---
It’s called using your analog sticks... d-did you seriously think you can’t curve?
---
Ironic he could save others from death but not him self
---
no, except when I got outplayed sometimes
---
I want hannibal
---
So for keys everyone has to have done a gen at least 50% would be a fair requirement since you're screwing with the killer version of a key
---
Reminds me of Habbo
---
Like high ranks or just bad game.
---
Stop clicking on shit you don't like.
---
Maybe it could put you on your last hook, it would be annoying for people who lose connection mid game, but they wouldn't be kicked altogether
---
Just hit one guy, the can't bodyblock
---
Right now I'm trying Inner Strength, Small Game, Sprint Burst and Fixated.
---
It works really well, as Small Game helps to find ruin (And activating Inner Strength) while Fixated helps me at saving Sprint Burst.
---
Maybe I have my settings wrong but I can't do that even if I hold left/right on my analog stick
---
I would make them go find a different corner to wallow in shame at.
---
You forget 1 thing ,killers get punised for using ebony mori as they are not getting piped if they morri everyone ,while survivors can still pipe if they escaped via a key ,and a key in swf is prerry much a free hatch escape for the last survivors
---
They’re just meme’ing around
---
&gt; "Man, I'm so tired of topics like this! Better waste even more of my time by opening it up and bitching about it."
---
And here I am desperately wanting a Deep Sea Diver killer
---
if they're op, I can understand nerfing it. but this drastically changes the way the game is played with them. it changes people to use them more selfishly and completely gets rid of the mechanic in the game. but they're being completely taken out of the game. personally even as a killer main I thought they were awesome. survivors are already hindered as it is and this just kind of put the icing on the cake
---
What would pennywise's ability be?
---
That better not be Haunted Grounds
---
I want Jack Torrance from The Shining, an Overlook Hotel map, and +\- Wendy as a survivor.
---
both, over the course of the last 2 years
---
No, If i destroy then i will sometimes let the one that gave me a good chases leave
---
Better to look like a pepperoni then be a fat double chinned clown and a spirit  that has hair that can probably reach the moon, weird eyes and just generally babyfaced, weird
---
Pc: game crashes in match happens at least 1/10.  Very frustrating for me and the team I’ve left. Also makes me look like I did it on purpose
---
Try turning up your sensitivity it's entirely based off of your sensitivity
---
Nice pallet use...
---
OK now I need help.
---
I just hate the legion because as a survivor you basically have to spend all your time healing if hes even half way decent. Its just not *fun* to face him.
---
My bad it’s L3 i just checked
---
whats wrong with you?
---
Clearly, Bilinda Butcher should be the killer. She’s got the name and everything.
---
I main ghostface (a guy who relies on stealth more than any other imo), when I come against an OoO, I just change tactic against them. Instead of trying to stealth them, let them break you out and get a free 1st hit as they stand there like lemmings.
---
I disagree completely that OoO is broken in any way, what you are talking about is the issue of swf not the perk itself. Thats like saying borrowed time is broken in swf because of body blocking, that adrenaline for swf due to perfectly timed last gen pops. It makes no sense to say "X is bad because its too powerful with swf", its swf, its inherently more powerful regardless.
---
I've wanted Pinhead *[forever](https://i.imgur.com/wn272P9.jpg)*. 
---
&gt; *^^no ^^tears ^^please, ^^it's ^^a ^^waste ^^of ^^good ^^suffering*
---
I would purchase all of them!!
---
You completely deserved the third one, imagine being such a tryhard you slug for a 4K after 2 DC's. That was a TIER ONE TACTICAL DISCONNECT to counter your cheese and open hatch with absolutely no counterplay, exactly what you deserve!
---
In all seriousness sucks when that happens. The Freddy hand at 2:50 made me almost spill my drink laughing though.
---
As a major fan of the series, I love everything Rob Zombie did with the franchise
---
Seriously, Pinhead would be so hype!
---
This isn't quite relevant to the question, but I have 2 ultra-rare addons
---
**Odd Chasis**
---
*A gleaming chasis for a chainsaw, made of a shiny yet organic material that seems nearly weightless*
---
-While the chainsaw is charged, you move at 4.6m/s
---
-Moderately reduces chainsaw acceleration rate
---
**Iridescent Muffler**
---
*A black as pitch muffler that still somehow glistens in the light**
---
-While the chainsaw is charged, your red stain is hidden
---
-The chainsaw makes **no** noise
---
There you are. Took you longer to respond than I thought it would
---
He could have the ability to place traps in the form in-ground veggies.
---
Because they extend chases by a metric shit ton. Against good survivors, the extra 20-30 seconds insta heals could add to a chase equate to damn near half a gens repair progress just for hitting a button. Now multiply that potentially by 4 if every survivor brought one, and suddenly the killer is in big trouble. Michael, trapper, GF, Hillbilly all have to work to get their insta-down, and Huntress’ instadown is regarded by most players as unfair and in need of a change, since Infantry Belt negates the only downside of using Iri head, so that’s not a very good comparison
---
I never said take away moris, but we *are* losing our insta-heals..
---
Whoever sent you this literally saw it in this subreddit.
---
There was a Claudette in my match today who wouldn’t stop clicking her flashlight at me. I ignored her because usually they are trying to waste your time when they do that, but towards the middle of the match I ended up killing her.
---
She then messaged me after the match and complained about me “spamming snares” with Freddy. 
---
It blows my mind how entitled people can get.
---
Hag
---
nah, demogorgon cutest don't @ me
---
Say that to the people who escape when there’s still 1 or 2 gens left, saving 2 or 3 people.
---
I doubt they’ve even touched killer, they probably just enjoy bullying weaker killers without consequence... ignorant of their own actions
---
Yup, that’s survivor mains for you
---
Yeah lore wise there's no good way of doing it.(although I have seen some interesting power concepts) Personally, I just want chucky or cujo. Just something really unique and can bring a completely new playstyle for killers. With demo, they've opened up all doors for any killer.
---
As a killer it can be fine sometimes (if youre not the best), but as a survivor its absolute fucking torture to be in the same team as people that clearly dont know how the game works or what teamwork is. Its just awful. I mean I just hit rank 7 again after avout 70% of my games being suicides, dc:s and bush clauds. And now I just have to do it all over again.
---
Pinhead Larry is killer and Dirty Dan is survivor
---
Oooohh that’s dirty!
---
Asking the real questions here
---
This is the exact reason why I will never use a different cosmetic because I'd rather have a clothed dead girl then a naked dead girl
---
They just make the games far easier you can make more mistakes but if you know what you're doing you can play anybody up there.
---
And the dev also said moris were going to be visited later on, I say keep the instaheals but nerf keys. There's no reason to have two-three people being able to leave via hatch mid game.
---
It's lit
---
It could be better, but I like it and I’m sure she will too, especially since you made it, she’ll love it.
---
The thought of a feral hag curiously knocking back is funny as hell.
---
^^you ^^are **^^outrageous**^^, ^^madam
---
Yup, even though I play both and tend to favor survivor even though I’ve been playing for killer I’m never this toxic
---
Many people just do this because they are Toxic so you can’t really tell the difference between good and bad anymore. Its sad
---
You say dollar store costume but basically all of Ghostface’s outfit is leather with black gloss accents. Definitely one of the cooler outfits in the game.
---
but just as they have to work for it, there's add-ons that make it insanely easy to work for it. hillbilly doesn't have to work for his, trapper also doesn't need to do much except place traps in general locations. Michael has an add-on that allows the exposed status for an infinite amount, and gf has add-ons that can expose people insanely fast. huntress wasn't a good example ig but my point still stands that just like how a killer has to work for their power, it doesn't need to be worked too long if they're a good killer. saying there's a good survivor is just like saying there's a good killer.
---
Don't fuck, did you really think the bag was for you?
---
Wow, you are a horrible companion, he still leaves you at 99%, he takes the risk of following him and you sell him like a miserable one, you are a fool of the ass, I wish I could block people like in LoL, I would not want to meet you ever.
---
Poor ace, he did everything for nothing.
---
Pffft. I guess!
---
Thats because Dwight swallows, like a classy gal.

I want a Naomi Campbell CLaudette and the first one is like that

Hag is top tier, Myers arguably is as well too just on the lower end of the top.

What if we saw his thumb spin after he hit someone

I've got 3k hours been playing 3 years and I still learn something new everytime I watch that man play killer.  He is so good and just a joy to watch man.

If springtrap was added I'd fuckin stop playing this game and throw my console out the window, that thing scares the crap out of me. Although the animatronics would be a very interesting killer to add. There would be some very interesting chase mechanics involved with them id presume
---
I think Hillbilly is pretty cute. And the Plague would've have a really nice face pre-plague.

Two things, I think you could have just ran straight to the exit gate instead of standing by the pallet and secondly, I think that Steve screwed you over because he just sat there waiting and when you made it to the exit gate, he got you stuck when he was bumping into you.
---
Outside my sphere of knowledge I'm afraid.

****Boris****
---
Awesome. Had a match earlier where I cleansed a ruin and the killer showed up right after and tunneled me the rest of the game
---
Making memes ain’t that hard dawg u can do it
---
Dead Hard and Ruin are both great, what?
---
Yep.  I'm right there with you in the purple ranks.  I get matched with ranks 20-16 enough as it is, but tomorrow it's all the way back to survivor hell.
---
If someone DC’s, as in clicks the leave game button, set them one enter rank back, grant everyone in the lobby 1200 points, and suspend the user from queuing for as long as the game you left takes to finish+30 minutes.
---
If their network shits out, give them 2 minutes to try to reconnect, keep their player in the game, so if the killer knocks them down, and hooks them, they will be hooked when they come back.
---

Got it, thank you!
---
The last one killed me
---
Dude I was being sarcastic.  Just making fun of the clowns that pretend the game is impossible to win without playing those two killers up there.  If you're good enough you can roll with just about anybody up there and have success you just have to work harder and play more optimally for it.  Nurse and Spirit just happen to give you much more room to commit mistakes and still recover.
---
I feel disgusting without we'll make it
---
cleanse before gens
---
Trapper sacrifices a shit ton of early pressure to properly set up his traps, and even then they aren’t guaranteed to catch anyone if the survivors are particularly observant. Hillbilly can only use his instadown if he catches survivors out, since utilizing safe loops and pallets render his power useless, Michael’s Infinite T3 add-on greatly increases the amount of evil he has to gain to activate it, and he’s still susceptible to being looped if survivors are aware of how far his lunge is and when to drop pallets, and GF’s Exposed effect lasts a negligible amount of time, observant survivors will see him coming a mile away most of time and can safely make it to a loop to stall out the timer. Not a single one of these is comparable to hitting a single button and instantly extending your chase by a whole 20 seconds, maybe more
---
Maybe it was a daily
---
Yeah I generally make it an effort to make those people never make it out, even if it costs me the match. It's not about the money, it's about sending a message. Play long enough and most of the time you just meme anyways, like I end up doing.
---
well i was about to pick her up and hook, i just hitted the gens first.
---
&gt;ely useless
---
Done.

I was working at a gas station with a male and female single toilet bathroom. I knocked on the guys restroom and heard somebody gleefully say "Come in!"

I promptly returned to my station and held it for like twenty more minutes

The skulls are from Home Depot, and all the other bones were part of a “bag of bones” collection from Five Below. All of them are touched up with some plaster and paint (since they looked like cheap plastic to start).

Who gives a fuck? It's not all about you, sweetness.
---
He's extremely abusive towards everyone around him and believes himself to be smarter than everyone. I feel sorry for his girlfriend cause there's no way he's just acting like that towards the people that give him money.
---
I hate how true this is. My totems are either:
---
On a hill
---
Right next to a generator or, if right next to a hook, it’s the only hook in the corner of the map that I have to go to
---
Or in shack
---
Chris should be her Survivor so we have an evil survivor for the first time.
---
you're giving me very situational examples but I see what you mean. do you think killers are harder than survivors? and is this game killer-based or survivor-based to you?
---
They’re just mad about how cool your Hag looks
---
My favorite thing to do is match a perk to a character to bring out a theme. So for example:
---
My Dwight is a nervous, jumpy delivery boy (Urban Evasion, Quick &amp; Quiet, Lightweight),
---
My Meg is a bold, no-nonsense leader who takes charge of decision making (Leader, Bond, Premonition)
---
My Adam is a sweet, quiet and tender helper (Botany Knowledge, Calm Spirit, Dark Sense).
---
It makes it fun to switch around characters because each has to solve their problems with their own unique personality
---
Pools closed
---
I hate indoor maps with a burning passion but I'm a huntress main
---
I met 4 man swf, 2 had no mither and they just didn't care, they showed dominance and as a virgin killer i dc'd when they all looked right at me.
---
WHAT?
---
Just because it's a game mechanic doesn't make it fair or fun. I've never disconnected as killer before in my entire life because the nature of it is that killers have 4 chances to have fun and survivors have 1. If some broken killer add on is used, their entire game experience is ruined for the entire match. Might as well leave because you got on a game to have fun, and if you aren't having fun, then why play? If you're playing killer and one survivor uses an instaheal or hits you with something you find unfair, so what? You still have 3 other survivors and now that one survivor no longer has this ability. The very idea that DCing as a killer is equivalent to DCing as a survivor is absurd and wrong.
---
More weeb cosmetics pls, give spirit some cat ears and i'll instabuy
---
That looks super cool
---
Well, i feel like you could make an argument that ebony mori is the killer equivalent of keys.  They're both potentially "free" wins.
---
But I'm not a part of the "omg this is too op plz nerf" crowd anyway.
---
Nurse?
---
Maybe, I still sent my usual "gg good luck with the next one" message and they sent me a "kys" sweet guy
---
That's a keeper ❤
---
Even Jigsaw isn't THAT evil
---
I really love the direction for the add on though. Probs to you for a really great idea.
---
Umm, the plague is a fucking queen. 
---
She's the original Fashionista
---
I caught the sarcasm, my comment doesn’t change though. It’s likely he could’ve swapped or have been leveling up his character then taken the screenshot.
---
Is this that uncommon? I typically see insults at the end of matches all the time.
---
Well of course, you didnt even crouch as an apology lol
---
As a League  player, I confirm that DBD is nowhere near as salty as League.
---
Fantastic man. Need to cleanse it to get rid of that hex ;)
---
There's no difference. Unless you're going to prestige soon. Building up a bank while using your remaining items and offerings then when you prestige you can get over level 30.
---
Mirror myers that has 5 stacks of devour hope on any indoor map
---
So so so true!
---
This game issn't actually that toxic. This subreddit just whines a lot more about it.
---
What fucking server were you playing if nobody trashtalked you/inted on you in LoL?
---
You never see Nurse because no one plays her on console.
---
right now that makes a lot of sense since everyone that is survivor main is just using all of them
---
She might cleanse it, be careful
---
If you wanna get it to have the experience playing as ghost face then yeah, but he’s not that good of a killer. Myers is the superior version of him. If anything if you wanna go for kills then I would choose Freddy or Myers. As for shards I’d say spend those on spirit.
---
Until something like Legion happens again. Then we’re not happy.
---
I always do that against mori's I just accept whatever points I got and leave
---
Plague is a tall skinny model with a golden crown silk robe lined with gold and a golden censer yet a man in a raincoat and a half naked man with a torn cape is fabulous.... banned
---
Thats bad...I wanted her to have noed, just to down that clicking idiot
---
If you find that unbalanced and unreasonable: You don't play Leatherface at high ranks. Keep me updated.
---
idk.. I guess I don't really care what people play like, I just enjoy having fun in the game and when I saw a survivor use an instaheal I see it as fair play and I kind of cheer them on. and I main killer lol. there's no point in taking the game too seriously and that's one of the reasons I loved instaheals on both ends. from a competitive standpoint it makes sense to nerf them for the "good" survivors but most survivors and killers aren't at rank 1
---
Bond needs to be higher
---
Why would you ruin her birthday 😏
---
David would punch pretty much anybody.
---
He just punches pedophiles harder.
---
I love ghost face but he’s utter shit on dedicated servers atm. I’d wait a bit before you get him.
---
Killer has facecamped toxic nea
---
*whispers* i think he was being sarcastic
---
*bing bong intensifies*
---
I would honestly just get the character you would most enjoy playing. For everyone that's going to be different, but if you like Scream/Ghostface enough, then regardless of the perks you have it might be worth it.
---
I have both Ruin and BBQ, and I don't use Ruin at all, and I only run BBQ for bloodpoints, otherwise I'd choose something else.
---
I'd suggest watching some Ghostface gameplay on youtube to help you make your decision.
---
Killers can be just as much of an asshole without provocation as well, but to think you are entitled to be toxic to the killer while he just has to take it is hypocrisy and delusion. And if you think teabagging or clicking a flashlight will make killers less prone to camping or tunneling then keep trying because you’re gonna have a hard time.
---
in fact it takes me about 10+ minutes to find a game at my ranks but when I drop to rank 8 or even was playing with my low rank friends, we would find games instantly.
---
Slenderman would be cool af
---
Mate I recommend ranking up whispers before using it it’s way too broad in ranks 1&amp;2
---
How did you get the sticks to the skulls? Hot glue?
---
This is how you end up single again
---
and haddonfeild
---
Cool
---
Yup, the moment he started clicking the flashlight made me disappointed.
---
After demogorgan came out I just need the xenomorph and ripley
---
Throws pallet on charged Saw.  Pallet had no effect.  Free instadown.  Every pallet a possibility for this lol.  If you think this is balanced you haven't played both sides at red rank.  The man needs buff love for sure but an overpowered version of Spirit Fury that requires even less skill to activate sure as shit ain't the answer.
---
Yeah I play on Xbox but I JUST got back into it after quite the long while.  And even then I didn't play toooo much.
---
Do you even like the Legion rework? I agree that the original was bad.
---
Nice shot!
---
The DC at 1:15 was likely because he’d just been unhooked and you intentionally avoided hitting the Meg who literally ran into you in order to tunnel him down, even though there’d been a DC, only 1 gen done and someone was still on the hook.
---
I usually use the apron, the scratched mask/iron man mask, and the prestige cleaver
---
I’m a simple man. I see Ash Williams, I upvote.
---
wow nice played.
---
would i have been the Killer, i would have totally tunneled you.
---
Ah this happened to me like 2 weeks ago :/ guess it's just a coincidence, but a really cool one! :)
---
I'd love a killer that's like a child of the entity ngl
---
You didnt even need to watch the clicking, with that flashlight and addons you know is those type of survivors who think they are the best and cry/dc when they get demolished...
---
Now that is a top tier killer right there.
---
If you ever get matched with a Susie who seems kind while you're using that outfit, come over and sit on her lap instead of running cause that's likely me hahahaha
---
Bruh I just dont want 3 licensed killers in a row. I love their original characters

---
Pretty balanced imo
---

---
Yeah I just guess her own death crippled her and broke her into becoming just a straight monster.
---
A perk
---
I played against this David on Ormond I think I was Wraith at the time and while his team was pretty shit he was an absolute loop god.  I can loop too pretty solidly but he was as optimal as optimal gets.  He had some really impressive juke and mindgame attempts too that I had to respect.  He would just like stare at me and kind of move his character in a manner that while totally arrogant didn't constitute as bm in my book it read more as friendly meme territory.  When it got down to the final 2 players he was the only one touching and repairing gens.  The other player was just immerse Claudetting her way towards a hatch.  I was running Overcharge and this fucker would just run up immediately all balls and successfully hit that skillcheck robotically right in my face.  I ended up downing him and slugging so I could find and kill the worthless teamate of his and give the man his hatch.  We had a cool post game chat and I thanked him for the fun challenging chases.  He carried every random in that lobby.
---
Like I said, at higher ranks they weren’t used for altruism that often anyways, just a tool to extend chases. Altruistic insta-heals were few and far between, so it doesn’t seem like a huge change in pace from my perspective
---
Or you could just not throw down the pallet while he is charging and go for another loop, as his movement speed is now 25% slower. It takes skill to loop while sweeping with the chainsaw without hitting an object and taking a massive animation penalty. I have been playing DBD since the beta.
---
Dont you see the marker. That was my planning lol. 
---
I couldnt figure out how to cut out the eyes and keep eme without it looking dumb. Tried think of some elaborate axe configuration but it wouldnt last until halloween if I did any of that.
---
What rank are you? I found killer queues were pretty spicy when I was in lower ranks but now I’m rank 7 they only last about 10 mins maximum, usually less.
---
play basement bubba
---
Just report the killer to the IRS then escape
---
Ah okay, I have unlocked a lot of parks yet as my Spirit is only level 20 something so I got keep going. 
---
How do the perks work exactly like the 1, 2 or 3 ticks at the top right of them, I know they mean level but what’s after that? Is a reddit or forum about it.
---
,,,wig
---
I guess we have very different games then lol. maybe making the instaheal like the medkits? where it heals others insanely fast but heals yourself standard
---
Clown doesnt do anything overpowered, nothing game changing, and hes not shitty enough to bitch about if youve unlocked a perk or two.  Too middle of the road to get a lot of ay
---
Just don’t die 4head
---
The one that always makes the least sense to me is Wraith’s backstory, I don’t see why unknowingly killing people would turn you into a killer, or what car crushing has to do with turning invisible or where the bell even came from.
---
because i saw him.
---
if you play killer and see 2 survivors one is injured the other one not, who do you chase?
---
This made me chuckle thanks
---
:peeposmug:
---
It looks stellar! I want to recreate it so bad. It would look so cool in the bedroom.
---
How come the words isnt american is this a fake screenshot
---
That would be an interesting change, I could live with that. It’s nice to have things that encourage altruistic play
---
Oof. That'll explain part of it then, I am lower ranked now because I took some time to solely play survivor during the DLC launch.
---
A million gets you roughly to 34. Give or take depending on what items you buy I guess.
---
hmm not gonna be good enough to be meta maybe block all generators forever?
---
There is a huge problem with this thought process. The game is a horror game but it's not a solo story or anything where you are limited on experience on a situation to know what to do in a moment. You first start off scared but as you progress in hours that killer you thought was scary and op you now know how to play against after lots of dying against them you have their number. I'm not on the edge of my seat when I see an ebony mori I just think if I am found early it may be inevitable based off of skill level and I'm rank 5 currently so I'm expecting other high ranking killers. This game is horror based but it's not a horror game.
---
If you play on steam just open their steam profile and block them. Then in every lobby just check if there is a survivor that you have already blocked. If there is bring a mori.
---
Much easier than keeping a list especially since some might rename their account.
---
I like new Legion he's just not very good. I think it was smart to change him from "hey tunnel this one guy down til he's dead" to "split damage across the whole team as much as possible". The problem is his power just lasts too short and takes too long to come back to use it to its full potential on the big maps.
---
Garbage players like you that have no awareness. Of course you’re a Meg too. He wasn’t going to just farm you back up, leaving at 99% was the best move
---
I totally forgot about Wraith.  Once again I think it's really just a mega overexaggeration over the events that happened, to where his mind snapped after figuring out he carried out all those killings without knowing.  Although tbh it'd suck ass but not enough to morph someone into a straight up permanent killer, let alone this jacked up paranormal Bing Bong Boi.
---
Yeah I assume that that is why it’s getting reworked. It’s not as hard to patrol as Freddy, but it’s still pretty annoying.
---
I’m also hoping they rework the big autohaven map, the asylum one, and blackwater swamp
---
Anytime someone goes out of their way to count D Strikes in their lobby it tells me a few things about their playstyle.  The best piece of advice I can give you is constantly switch targets.  If someone unhooks in your face focus the person making the save and trade bodies out.  Do this and D Strike won't trigger against you period.  It's a non-factor in my killer games.  Make them a 3 perk player and never tunnel off hook.  Assume they have it because the higher you rank up it's likely they do not to mention Borrowed Time.
---
before i read your title i thought its fanart.

you totally nailed it, i REALLY thought this is Meg.

---
If shes not a noed hater, shes peob finna file for divorce.
---
If she doesnt play dbd, she'll think u in a cult.
---
Well, you can at least keep a list if you play on steam. Just go on their profile and block them. Before every game just check if any of the players are already blocked by you.
---
I tend to play fair and even give last person hatch BUT if I meet someone I have already blocked I know they flamed in post game chat, DCd (obvious DCs like on first down) or sabotaged their team massively in a previous game and they will have the most unfun game they can imagine. I'll gladly let others escape that game just to make the game for that person unfun. After they flame in post game chat again I tell them why. It's always fun. It can be a challenge when you have all 4 blocked because the whole team is just full of the absolute worst toxic people but an ebony mori usually is enough anyway even for a team like that.
---
I want chucky before pennwise lol just imagine his short stature carrying around survivors
---
So I tried my hand at making one of those "meme" videos that everyone seems to be doing these days. If you have any suggestions for the next time I try my hand at editing, lemme know :D I'm open to all criticisms
---
His power is fine since the nerf, he needed the limit on his power. However, they need to get rid of his free wall hacks that's the one thing they need to take away from the legion
---
Ah yes Nancy. Dead by daylights first survivor yandere.
---
You have to mend first, yes.
---
Yeah. Not always the best. I do pretty well with them though. Merciless 3 times in a row at rank 6.

absolute MEGhead fails a skillcheck so hard she's ported to the real world smh my head

Good idea for players but doesn’t make sense story or gameplay wise

Funny thing is is that NO-ONE would care if it didn't get upvoted. But people STILL CHOSE to upvote. So I'll take it. And credit is in the comments. And sort by new on the comments and you'll see EVERY SINGLE COMMENT TODAY HAS BEEN ABOUT IT BEING A REPOST.

Queue times are always related to player population but too many people refuse to believe this and nonstop bother the devs to meddle with matchmaking in order to make it faster (which leads to unfair match ups and people also complain about this). On top of available players, there are many variables involved when searching for a match. Overall regional population, time of the day, ranks and available players of the same rank at the moment you pressed the "find match" button. Not to mention SWF that with the newest change, removed a lot of players ranked 20 to 10 from the matchmaking pool at that rank. 
---
Based on steamDB (which is global population, not regional) or whatever other website that tracks player count, people genuinely think DBD has enough players to ALWAYS have fast queues. 
---
I genuinely feel bad for our devs that have to put up with the amount of ignorant people spamming their social medias and it is also annoying the amount of spammed threads we get in here, official forum or steam forums.
---
Yesterday I tried to play 2v2 Rocket League and also found myself sitting in queue for ages even though the matchmaking there is 1 for 1 (not 1 for 4). Is their matchmaking also broken? No, the player amount just wasn't high enough for fast queues at that time.
---

I like these! I'd say that Lifeless would need to be slightly stronger. Maybe make it 2/3/4 seconds.

Ah yes, I’d love to get banned for a week because my game crashed
---
Yes. Fair punishment.
---
Itll be on the wiki

Yeah I guess but I’ve been having a problem where I get a No Network Connection screen when my internet is fine. I’ve been deranked 5 times because of it.
---
that was hilarious, well done

Ability description: "Survivors can eat the vegetables. They don't do anything, they just taste bad."
---
I have only the little plastic tools that you get in dollar stores. 
---
My current plan is to cut out a mask from a milk jug and lay it over.
---
Yeah I have toxic experiences every once in awhile, but on those two it’s every other game with straight up blatant racism and sexist shit happening to people
---
Probably helps to read the description 😂 thought it was just general vicinity of the killer
---
Yeah credit is in the comments, there, hidden so anyone can see, better place than in the title
---
K i still get my kill -shrug-
---
That loathsome piece of shit told the man to kill himself before using what might be the ugliest most despicable word in the English Language.  Absolutely fuck that man and the inbred sister he rode in on.
---
I'm literally stating the current system that BHVR has put in place to prevent DCing. I'm saying that if you DC *too* much then you will be banned.
---
No.... Top 3rd comment...
---
Over time I just started ignoring my illusions at high ranks, it's useless...
---
It's GOD
---
Match leavers with other leavers, to get out of "leaver matchmaking" you have to get a certain amount of 1 or 2 pip games as both survivor and killer, more leaving means more exit games required.
---
That’s all I had lol
---
Just takes a little more time
---
This is why I run Small Game, Inner Strength and D-Strike. Gotta be as self-sufficent as possible.

Ah, take the street fighter approach, I like it!

Killer perk idea: Feathered Familiar
---
You can place 1, 2, 3 crows around the map. These crows give 1,2,3 seconds worth of aura tracking as the feathered familiar flies around the survivor that startled it. 
---
Feathered Familiar has a 60,50, 40 second recharge.

Maybe give the familiars a slightly different visual? Maybe a red third eye?

I play mostly Bubba and Legion with no addons (mostly because I'm a survivor main who barely spends points on killer :D). Not gonna lie, sometimes it's really hard against very good survivors but nobody is supposed to win every match. People who say it's impossible to rank up with worse killers are simply bad but they don't want to admit this.

You are clearly the toxic one he could've farmed you by picking you up and going inmediatly down by the Demo instead he tbagged the demo to incite a chase and you body blocked him... congrats you win the douchebag award
---
Yes, its like- ok i got you, annnnnnnnd they have a window and pallet
---
If you're legit asking, I am confident enough in my ability to catch survivors that I would go for the one who hadn't been hooked yet, because I want my BBQ stack.
---
The first DC sucked, but I don't blame that guy at 1:15, you played like an asshole and tunneled a guy on his way out of the basement in a game that was already heavily in your favor.
---
You didn't want to leave him a chance, huh? :D
---
A lot of the time, you trade 1 for 1 once the gates are open because the killer has no other objective than preventing a guaranteed kill for escaping.
---
Myers deserves to be lower, considering his perks actively dick eachother.

Played a game this morning where a Bill talked in the pre game lobby asking if we are good at the game. He said he was sick of shitty teammates. 
---
During the match he unhooked everyone in front of the killer. Two of us had been hooked twice while our third got three hooked as fast as I’ve ever seen. All this while only one gen was done. I feel like he did it on purpose and used Bill because Bill usually has borrowed but this guy didn’t.
---
If not in a chase, it’s 4m for EWII and 32m for EWIII. In chase it is 20m and 48m for each tier respectively.
---
I mean they’re not gonna escape, so they’re basically trying to befriend you with their teabag instead of running away
---
I mean a simple fix is making no repeat killers
---
That’s sick lol impeccable timing for all of that to happen w randoms

Tbh in game freddys face is kinda small

They're rarely a problem.  I've had a few minor issues vs pre-made 4 flashlighters on specific maps.  Generally just face a wall, or walk up and do a 180 before picking them up.  The best play is to stand on them like you're about to pick them up and the flashlighter will walk in front of you for an easy hit.
---
Sorry for the question, but can you finish the whole pass playing just as survivors? I really hate playing as killer and don't feel like grinding through missions if I don't enjoy it
---
They are SUPER good against hag, and flashlight saving is definitely still effective in this game and very useful, while difficult.  Personally I run flashlights almost every game just for the extra boldness for blinding.
---
You’re right, didn’t notice that. But honestly, I think it’s the closest it’s gonna get. Still pretty similar.
---
*Brilliant Vegetable - what is best in life?*
---
**To crush all survivors, to see them sacrificed before you, and to hear the lamentation of their teammates.**
---
I was getting healed and I went all the way, and then no progress and I got stuck. No crows either because I was getting healed
---
Oh, you mean see estimated time to GET a lobby?
---
That'd probably kill the game. A ton of people would drop it because they see that lobbies will take forever.
---
Youd hear the Myers song playing
---
The amount of time I got teabagged by Dwights when I play killer is beyond countable.So I now have no mercy policy towards them. 
---
As survivor, they rarely help especially as the game winds down as you can see in your example. They will hide in corners or lockers.
---
That would be neat!
---
Yeah that’d be great if you could give me a link
---
Ooohh ok thanks. 😁
---
Not anymore.
---
If you don't think they're gonna destroy your portals, place them in spots that'll give you an advantage leaving them up like at a 3 gen camp
---
Red rank killer here. I've learned the best way to play red rank killer is to not be a red rank killer. But I like the challenge, if I didn't I wouldn't be red rank.
---
Hmmmm, this might be a bit op, i think to make it balanced we should nerf pallets
---
Awww thank you so much ❤️ Really makes me happy :)
---
You post might not be too popular around here, but I agree with you. There’s a lot of ways to counter her, and while some are harder than others, I still think she’s fine as is.
---
_Sounds like me tbh_
---
IRC he drowned because the Camp Counselors weren't doing their job and watching him.  Mrs Vorhees then vowed revenge for that reason and was killing people she viewed as WHY her Jason was dead.  The theory goes that Jason was rezzed indirectly by some BS Mrs Vorhees tried with the Necronomicon forever ago, other theory is that "Jason" isn't actually her kid, at least fully, and partly a demon who was brought through instead.  I think it was retconned that in order for Jason to be revived X many souls had to be killed at Camp Crystal Lake but I'm not sure on the specifics, and neither is anyone else.
---
His power set has largely been the same only growing and shrinking based on what the films say his power now is, so in Jason X he becomes an unstoppable Terminator like killer while in previous films Tommy Jarvis could kill him because Tommy was a messed up kid just like Jason "Is."  The demon thing I buy more as manipulating Jason to keep killing would suit that entity more but I digress.
---
Ghosts and demons are a VERY REAL thing in Friday the 13th to a point where Jason isn't even the most ridiculous thing in lore.
---
They hated jesus because he told them the truth
---
There's a screen where you can see all the perks you've unlocked.  At the top there are slots to activate perks and equip items.  You start with one perk slot and unlock a 2nd/3rd/4th slot at ranks 5/10/15.
---
And I'm here still waiting for pyramid head from Silent Hill PepeHands
---
That doesn't make up for the fact that you could get 5000 if you escape, or 1000 if they were hooked 3 times
---
Happy oink
---
What’s GF?
---
Yeah totally. Always nice to have someone who's addicted to a trash game.
---
Not often enough!  Hopefully there will be one on the 22nd.  Otherwise I believe we will be able to do challenges for Bloodpoint rewards with the rift.
---
Props to srgrafo for the template , i didn’t draw it he did , I just used it to portray the community
---
1 Doc, 1 Spirit, 1 Plague, 1 Huntress. 
---
Doc reveals you to everyone else, Plague infects you, making Spirit borderline inescapable, and Huntress just for lols.
---
Why should we bring in iron will to counter one killer? It’s not fine
---
Sounds like a pain to keep track of. I basically just have the vague wish that awful people would have it know that they're like that, so everyone's discouraged from being awful.
---
You're doing God's work out there.
---
Errmmm... source?
---
I seriously doubt BHVR are gonna make us wait 6 months for these cosmetics. I imagine they'll be available week-by-week after the current rift closes.
---
I really like this! Thanks.
---
yeah that was unfortunate =\
---
Seen a lot of Spirits recently bring Stridor to counter Iron Will.
---
Try to remain awake whenever possible and identify which power he’s using early, if he’s using pallets, you’re gonna have to keep track of which pallets are real while awake, if it’s snares, you’re gonna have to drop pallets a bit earlier than usual. Keep in mind you’re immune to snares and can’t see dream pallets while awake
---
I was thinking Coke Music lmao
---
Personally i thought the new skin looked like the spitter from left 4 dead 2...
---
Play at night.  Rank 7 killer and queue times are instant for me at nighttime in US.  During the day they take up to 20 minutes.
---
I'm not sure how he can walk into a lake constantly in the real world and then turn around and be afraid of it in a dream. I don't GAIN phobias in dreams. If anything, I'm braver and stronger.
---
Thank you, apologies again for my ignorance but how do you access this screen, or the inventory? I've added lots of stuff in the bloodweb but I've no idea what to do with it. Still enjoying the game nonetheless!
---
Yeah I'm really looking forward to those new challenges
---
yeah he’s got some [weapons](https://imgur.com/a/OjlVwF8) he likes to do it himself sometimes ;)
---
I Iove lettuce hag :)
---
Here's the link to the video that the guy had worked on for a month. You don't deserve the upvotes and rewards you're getting for this. https://youtu.be/DfCYw83wOl4
---
I always hated running sprint burst. It just annoyed me having to walk everywhere to save it.
---
It wont happen, but if it did, it would need to be accompanied by a very long stun (and instantly open all exits).  Otherwise killers would just BM/farm hits and hooks.
---
if u think it's trash then why are u here
---
I would love for her to get some cute hair!
---
whats the reason?
---
The official server is complete ass in my opinion your better off going to a discord server for a content creator you like
---
Totally valid idea. You just have to make it so that Killers transferring hooked Survivors to THEIR hooks don't make the Survivor drop another stage, instead pausing their hook timer.
---
I thought that game was dead woah
---
 Oh yeah, you’re definitely the type of person to ask your professor to round your 15% to a 70%
---
Machine heal thyself!
---
So are we supposed to take your word for it when you say you didn’t deserve a ban?
---
Doesn't seem to happen as often
---
Sloppy is better thana really isn't that good
---
Pinhead Larry!?!?!?
---
Yeah that's really the major issue with multiple killers.
---
Freddy discovered that fear by MISTAKE in that fight. Jason was afraid of water from the damaged pipes on his own. Maybe if Freddy had transformed him into a child it would have made sense, but they certainly didn't construct the scene to imply any of that well.
---
Yeah it would be mega dead
---
I love goodest Boi and play him alot. Not great in red ranks but still super fun
---
Character model rendering, especially hairs, are fucked up post Stranger Things release.
---
Reminds me of Eric from trueblood
---
...Good point.
---
I agree, she’s strong but not overpowered. 
---
Along with iron will, I’ve found that spine chill and fixated help a lot too. Use the fact that she can only see scratch marks to your advantage.
---
Get rid of prayer beads though, they have no counterplay.
---
But that's my point, you cant really mind game something that's standing still. That's where the mind game is completely on her side. Yeah you can loop her but it's down to pure luck when it comes to countering her phasing and then like I said with collision sometimes it doesn't even matter. And her phasing isn't useless if you break line of sight because she can still track scratch marks and try to sound survivors out. 
---
At least with killers like Billy the mind game is equal. Hell, even nurse has a more fair counter because you can try to predict her blinks due to being able to see her and see her animations to where she might blink. When it comes to spirit she could be phasing, vaulting or even standing still and you purely have to guess what she's doing. That's just not fun for me.
---
And the devs still listen to the newbies.
---
There are no discounts. The only reason to save up is when you're planning to prestige or get a new character and want to skip the phase where perk slots are locked.
---
Not technically no, but kinda. He's a manifestation of James Sunderland's hyper-violence and violent-sex tendencies/thoughts.  James openly thought about raping Mary while she was sick as well as doing a lot of other things like cheating on her with other women and, depending on ending, mercy killed her because she was suffering and he felt she was better off dying this way then from the disease she had, to murdering her in cold blood because she couldn't satisfy him.  He technically exists to punish James but so does every monster that isn't directly in say Angela's nightmare.
---
This is also why Maria exists as Maria is a physical representation of what James darkest side WANTED Mary to be:  A sexy, slutty, always wants in on that James Sunderland monotone delivery dick.  She was, QUITE LITERALLY, born from Jame's wish that he could have Mary again and that she'd be what his darkest side always wanted.  Hell when James first meets Maria on the pier she straight up reaches out for his hand and puts it FLAT on her boobie.  What a world!
---
Which gets us BACK onto Pyramid Head as Pyramid Head was a creation by the old gods of Silent Hill SPECIFICALLY MEANT to torment James for what he did to Mary, which is why the first scene in which you see Pyramid Head he is not so subtlety raping \[Or having hyper violent sex with\] Nurses and can later be seen dragging their dead bodies around.  The Cult really doesn't appear in Silent Hill 2 outside the Rebirth ending but, as far as they are concerned they ABSOLUTELY LOVE honesty with one's self and James completely fabricates Mary's letter with her likely being dead IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR at the start of the game as a way to cope with the horrible thing he did, of course there was also the Silent Hill old gods kinda just fucking with him which helps too.
---
Technically, in a way, you can say that Pyramid Head is a anthropomorphic variant of James darkest thoughts acting as a punishing judge, jury and executioner but IDK if that really flies as that kinda is a cop out they use to justify Pyramid Head showing up in Silent Hill Homecoming and games where he FOR SURE isn't needed.  Heather/Cheryl had entirely unique enemies from James and from her own father Harry Mason because she was dealing with her own inner demons tag-teamed with her other half's from the failed birth of a god in Silent Hill 1 which got the REAL Cheryl fucking killed.  Harry is more or less dealing with the manifestations of the GENERAL TOWNS demons, 4 is based on each nightmare Townsend goes into as the subway has those perverted long-tongue dogs for the sexy Mexican lady to the weird double-baby-head demons in the Prison for the killer, etc.  The way the system works is that ONLY James should technically see Pyramid Head because Alex Shephard should see, IDK, Glock Head or some shit due to Silent Hill going out of it's way to torment people in every way it can.
---
Pyramid Head being a general "Punish bad guy" dude only happened in Silent Hill Homecoming and that is because the writer for Silent Hill Homecoming was kinda trash garbage.
---
TL;DR:  Pyramid Head is awesome in a lot of ways but technically he's JUST Jame's personal demons personified into a sentient creatures so no one else can see them.  It's really interesting to me at least!
---
Iron will counters every killer its works better on Spirit because she relies on sound.
---
Yes you can.
---
Yeah, about that. Usually when I mention Legion I go for Frank.
---
Yeah, people still DC, left and right, excluding the player from matchmaking for 5-10 minutes would work much better than losing a few measly bloodpoints
---
Ghostface isn't Scream Ghostface. They licensed the mask.
---
Plus, no phone calling or second Ghostface. Or original costume.
---
Hag you can get with shards, so Bubba would be the best Killer to buy perk-wise, but Michael looks like the most FUN licensed Killer, with a similar mechanic and generally better perks.
---
He has had the same cigarette in his mouth for his entire life
---
Yo 20 second standard cookdown sprint burst was balanced. Y'all just need to learn to adapt!
---
thank god thank you so much &lt;3
---
Well I wanted to place her in the "just a lil' bit" at first but it seemed too far stretched for me.
---
ZOMBIE REDNECK TORTURE FAMILY
---
But DCing = escaping
---
 /s
---
please realize that that it's a medium vault and the killer was also close so that should be 100% a hit
---
Yeah like the other person mentioned, blood warden is the most obvious use but also let's say you have someone slugged and you're vsing a SWF, you can open the exit gates to start the collapse timer and force them to rescue which can cause you to turn the game around specially if you have noed. Another use is to force the collapse to stop players from holding the game hostage
---
Idk, fear gas is a bit like Carter's spark.
---
They're bad for everyone, people are saying evenings are better, but why is unclear beyond the SWF matchmaking change.
---
Most of us think it’s trash however it’s still fun as hell
---
Demogorgon can be controlled though, mind flayer BS and all that.  Pennywise is far cooler as a concept than he would be in execution which is where my worry is.
---
 Perk Build:  Insidious - Standing still for three seconds will remove your terror radius and red stain light until you move. 
---
Franklin's Demise -  Hitting a survivor with a M1 attack will cause them to drop the item in their hand.
---
 Iron Maiden - When a survivor exits out of a locker, they give the killer a notification to their location. 
---
Monstrous Shrine - Faster Entity progression, increased difficulty to struggle off the hook, penalty to try to escape.  
---

Made by me :)
---
Used to hate it but I've grown to really like it. I'm a killer main so it really helps with eliminating lines of sight and surprising survivors.
---
Welcome to our club
---
Do you have the blank template per chance?
---
She's killing under the impression that her god is telling her to. One if the more dangerous types of killers throughout history.
---
I mean it depends on what you think is toxic..I don't really consider DBD toxic since tbagging and flashlights and stuff is more BM than actually being toxic. In League people literally intentionally throw the games and tell you to kill yourself and stuff if you fuck up once
---
If it’s “fun as hell” then it’s not trash
---
I always hit the unhooked guy then go for the farmer. Leave him to be picked, and at the end I'll let him go.
---
Obviously, Iron Will and Unbreakable can just be replaced by No Mither. Then you can use Mettle of Man to fill the slot. /s
---
Otz has a pretty good series on underrated perks, but I always thought DS was very crutch. I'd rather have Prove Thyself in a team, or Bond out of one.
---
Unless I’m playing hag they don’t bother me
---
He doesn't need children. Just people who believe. Children are the easiest target because they always believe. RIP those two little cuties from part 2.
---
Carefully, he's a hero
---
Yeah they've done a pretty good job so far.
---
Freddy too stronk
---
No slowdown while revving, make each swing also lunge forward, meaning a skilled player can take corners with him.
---
Power users? Like people who seek out the most upvotes with their posts?
---
And yeah, timing is definitely key.
---
but no BP
---
Your comment radiates much more toxicness pal. And appearently you know peoples intentions. This is why people hate cocky killer mains lol
---
DC.  If you aren’t having fun don’t continue to play
---
A lil' friendly advice — do not try to heal your buddy in the corns within humming distans while yourself injured.
---
You don’t just get banned for no reason. The most stupid f**ing reason was something big,
---
😂
---
Yeah on the big subreddits, you may notice it’s the same few users getting top of Reddit every day with millions of karma.
---
10/10 good husband points.
---
“Sup, Ash.”
---
Just let him set bottles on stuff so Survivors can be penalized for taking a vault he knew they would in advance, or can't afford to pop a gen so Overcharge might suck less.
---
Kinda reminds me of Wesker from Resi Evil.
---
He won’t be added as he has his own game, plus DBD does not own the right for me voorhees. Unlike all the killers you have so far Jason is the only one to have one so in return won’t be added
---
Same. Just by getting more content I'm happy already.
---
At PIII lvl 50 (I THINK) it only increases your ultra rare chance by %2
---
And browns will be yellow more often
---
That’s it
---
Well no but actually still know.
---
He doesn't spark, he glitter at worse. He shine at best. But he doesn't spark.
---
what the hell happened there
---
I really like this killer idea, would be nice to have another jump scare killer!
---
Everyone, you know what to do
---
Welcome back fellow killer. I hope you are doing much better and recovering. Congrats on the successful return.
---
at first i thought all survivors had borrowed time
---
Haha yeah man
---
Thas not me
---
PC' Gameplay bug. Got stuck as demogorgon on haddonfield, at one of the trucks. Couldnt move at all untill i attacked. I could use my ability to teleport but i was still immobile
---
I've mainly stay away from the big subs on here and focus on games that I play. I do know art is popular on gaming and usually an artist or an art style can dominate the page consistently.
---
See Rainbow 6 for example. But thanks for the clarification.
---
This is so good!
---
If you can do huntress, that be great. You don’t gotta tho
---
...unless?
---
Best hope your not giving her Ruin cuz it will break before the day ends
---
Playing trapper or most of the dlc characters fares pretty well
---
Based on feedback from other users regarding the viability of the power, I have come up with the following change to it:
---
“Another user has also commented on this general weakness and I’ve been thinking on it. One idea I’ve come to is a second ability like you’ve suggested in which you begin with a small number of gas canisters that can be placed any where and and stay there for a couple minutes. These canisters omit a cloud of fear gas that applies the same affects as the main ability to any who pass through it. In addition, you can proceed to teleport to these canisters from anywhere but on a decent cooldown. A new one can only be placed once an active one has expired.
---
Based on how you use them, you can use them to apply pressure around the map via the teleport and force players to be affected by the gas by placing it in key areas they must go to or through.” (From another comment thread on this post).
---
Also hillbilly is a good starter
---
thanks!
---
“He was a hero, I just couldn’t see it yet.”
---
Trust me, as a pc player, they dont help with this at all. If anything it's actually worse because now you can stun a killer with a pallet and STILL get hit by a swing on the other side of the pallet.
---
Yes! That's what I like about it. My only worry is Object of Obsession. My thought would be just have whenever he's standing still it doesn't effect him, but it'd basically make it so he has Insidious *naturally*.
---
It's fine to have a perk that counters a killer, but Object would completely destroy him entirely.
---
Isnt it kinda silly for a hit to still land when you are numerous feet away from the opening?
---
"Oh no, he's HOOOOOTTT"
---
I have 1.5k hours on pc, I'm not looking for a starter. I'm about to have everyone p3 level 50 and I just wanna know who I should try maining, letting people choose just for fun
---
Not going to lie I just bought spirit for this skin today😂😂😂
---
He grabbed you at the same time the game registered completion.
---
It’s pretty simple
---
Well in league of legends  you would get that everytime not only when you are good lol
---
Edit yes even by your teammate
---
BOYYYYYYYYYY...............
---
I got better belts, as well as finished the hood and got some gloves! Basically 99.5% done here, just need to weather and get some extra detailing done. Ill post some pics of the 100% finished product when i take him to a convention in 2 weeks!
---
Not quite, its 6m for EWII. 16-8 = 8 *.25 = 6
---
I am that survivor, I love Lery’s. :( It’s genuinely my favorite map.
---
Clearly you didn’t see it suctioned me back to the killer, therefore the game compensated for lag and it should not have hit.
---
I’ve gotten swings like this that missed by a mile, more often than not.
---
Finally, he swung late.
---
I’ll be posting more.
---
that's bhvr for you
---
I can normally keep items when I escape buy I have never kept an item through the hatch or when I escaped while downed. It also sucks because you can get downed through the entity claws that block the killer from escaping, making you lose your item.
---
Why don't the survivors just stomp on it instead of molesting it? But looks awesome!!!!
---
Awesome job!
---
OwO what's this, OH FUCK IRIDESCENT HEAD!
---
òWó
---
Spirit? Myers?
---
that shit happens to me all the time so i just stopped complaining, devs won't do anything about hitboxes since they said "hitboxes are fine" when they clearly aren't
---
Thanks for stealing the video without giving the original creator credit
---
Not perfectly balanced, she has some things that needs to be tweaked or changed, like remove collision when she’s using her power. Disagree, but it’s pretty much a free hit for Spirit when she bumps into a survivor.
---
Look at Billy, he’s still one of the strongest killers, the only con he has is loops, but a good Billy knows how to deal with loops so he still doesn’t have much downsides. I hardly ever see him anymore.
---
Billy was my first killer can't tell you how many fast games and 4ks I've had with him in my time defo Billy is amazing on console
---
I played legion for a daily the other day and it was the boringest mud hole stomping I ever gave a SWF team. Its not a lack of viability it's just not fun to play them anymore.
---
its your lag. Since dedicated servers it HAS to be your lag
---
Hag, she is a really slept on killer. She is super good
---
Fuck yes
---
reeee  
---
for the eight hundredth time
---
Well you seem great at finding ways to counter spirits
---
No literally the new outfit is the costume version meaning he's wearing a literal dollar store outfit
---
Do the roar!
---
Thanks so much c: Really appreciate it ❤️
---
What the hell. Now shes going to fail skill checks in the kitchen and set the house on fire like the Sims
---
Michael Myers, he’s one thicc boi.
---
Ghost Faces are just also so often toxic and unfun to play with that when you do get a good ghost face it feels like a major treat
---
Well I'm gonna go off of who I should main based on which killer most people say, so I'll see who gets the most "votes" in a few hours or tomorrow even. So, thanks for the input
---
I get about 2 to 3 death threats/some one telling me to kill myself every week when I play DbD. In lol it’s only happened once or twice in the 8 years I played. So yah DbD is very toxic
---
What are your goals?
---
Which Killers do you enjoy the most?
---
Which rank do you feel comfortable in?
---
Shit... will you marry me?!
---
She is really good, one of my personal favorites. I don't feel like I need ruin on her when I play her at red ranks
---
id rather have a fucking plank as a killer than pennywise
---
Is there a doc part or am I blind?
---
I'll try to find it but I do remember seeing it definitely 6 something though it could be weeks or months but I think it was months
---
Hex: no one escapes love
---
survivor bad upvote to the left pls 😎
---
Idk man, bought her yesterday and reached level 50 today.... Lost only 1 game so far. And I'm not even spamming prayer beads.
---
he could have an ed ed and eddy skin as well
---
Just stop running ruin
---
You really don't. With more killers coming out with new and pretty good perks, ruin isn't crucial. Hag is just great.
---
I just want to get the rank 1 achievements then never care about rank again.
---
And? Also the killer only gets 5k bp for a dc instead of the loads they could have collected for multiple hits, downs, chases, and hooking.
---
Plus, if you keep it to a minimum you don't even get depiped. 😂😂😂😂
---
Yea its wraith
---
It’s not his. He stole it from Fantozi. 
---
Didn’t  even credit
---
https://youtu.be/DfCYw83wOl4
---
Really? Im on ps4 and its seems they fixed the wait time issue. It used to take me 5-10 minutes until last week when it started only taking about 30 seconds to a minute.
---
My goal is to main a killer, that's it. I know their abilities, I'm not a beginner, im just letting people choose for fun.
---
I enjoy hag, demogorgon, legion, and I used to love freddy before he was reworked.
---
Sadly, I end up at red rank at some point provided I play enough, so I'm gonna be at red ranks anyway
---
Whether its survivor or killer this DC crap is getting out of hand. I love spending a half an hour looking for a game and then people dc over the most minor bullshit. Just cause you suck doesn't mean people dont want to fucking play
---
No, he doesn’t. He reposted Fantozi’s YT video without giving credit
---
Hmmmm huntress... Maybe in the future. Actually hoping for a new cool killer or survivor to come out anytime soon. But I'll think about Huntress ;)
---
Meh shrine.
---
No. The devs and not_queen have said that the percentage increase for better items is still extremely low.
---
Info: its wraith, you cant see her on the pic
---
Who you calling pinhead?
---
Look what they did to my boy
---
Well yeah but Feddy sucks
---
Unless you are yellow - green ranks i dont believe you at all
---
So put it in the title bitch
---
Otz?
---
I don't want to not be able to D.C. until I can be sure im not playing against cancer.
---
thanks,
---
-Everyone
---
You must hate your wife..
---
You are stupid.
---
Dedicated servers aren’t on console :/
---
Yeah like I said. It’s just a general bug. Getting downed seems to have nothing to do with it. I also forgot to mention that escaping through hatch we we’re both still losing our items as well. Might as well just consume them at this point.
---
Yep, quality... and stolen without credit
---
It looks super fun. I almost already did, but the fact that being color blind would give me a significant disadvantage with spotting things was really discouraging though. I’ve tried games with similar difficulties and it’s just immensely frustrating. If they add that in, I will jump in immediately.
---
It's the exact same minus the bandanna.
---
I looked up the numbers for dead rabbit and saw it reduced EWII by 4m, didn’t read close enough to see it was just a 25% reduction I guess. Thanks for the correction.
---
Yeah. In the books they explain that children are the easiest to scare. Which makes a lot of sense, go for the easiest target
---
Not going to credit the guy who made this right...cliam this as you made it huh
---
I'll edit it right now.
---
Never did.
---
That’s...what reworks are.
---
YES. I'VE BEEN WANTING PINHEAD FOR SO LONG.
---
You know....this can be pretty low cost to make. Think i can go to the halloween store and get the supplies for it on my college student income.
---
Here comes a new bedroom decoration!

(Shitpost/meme) flair, “am I a joke to you?”

That’s true, healing then being exposed for 20 seconds is much better trade off than being broken for 34 seconds, then healing. The only thing second wind has is that it’s self reliant but wouldn’t matter in swf

Wait.......did you trigger deep wound on 2 people at the same time?
---
Also if you look at my most recent post I updated the mask a tiny tiny bit and made the knife. It’s not finished yet I still need to add blood to it but for the most part it’s done
---
It is if you're a killer main.
---
How can you get suspended for moris...
---
Yeah, it's pretty much been confirmed that all killers will eventually have the same amount of add-ons within their respective rarities.  
---
They have said that they want to rework the Cannibal's add-ons, but we have absolutely no idea where he sits in the line of upcoming add-on reworks. It's likely that the devs don't know either at the moment.  
---
All I *really* wish for, though, is to see poor Bubba finally get some add-ons that aren't completely useless. Most of his add-ons are either undesirable or literally don't even work. It's ridiculous.
---
Im happy either way. But id really love to see some more original, unlicensed stuff.
---
100% agree, the red rank solo experience is genuinely awful.
---
Hopefully with the rank reset all the boosted people won't make their way back up.
---
Legion relies on getting smaller maps harder than any other killer in the game, if the map is even slightly above average he's most likely going to get trounced.
---
Honestly I love Lerys. I can run a killer 10-20 minutes easy on that map. I honestly don't understand why people hate it so much. All you have to do is learn the window placements and distance to get a fast vault. Learn that and the killer won't be able to catch you. Hope this helps anyone struggling with this map.
---
You welcome bro comment again so i can give you more upvotes
---
a Minimum, so what? In most Games that would get you banned and reported
---
Because he was a salty survivor main so he sent hate messages and I responded back calling him out so he reported me and my messages.
---
:)
---
Oh... F
---
I don't think we can expect her tho. Fist of all, she's 16 and second of all she probably looks too human to be a killer.
---
Yeeting Claudettes from grass to skies sounds just amayzing tho...
---
imagine playing a few games in 1 hour, i usually can only play about 2 in that amount of time
---
I performed a grab at the wrong moment. A survivor was going into a locker and I thought I would make the grab but it fully closes. Instead of striking the closed locker, my M1 still went through the locker as if I interrupted their entering animation.
---
Switch is the same.
---
Yeah.
---
Which is also why the longer instinct range addons are absolutely useless in almost every possible scenario.
---
That idea is epic but image how could plague work in this system
---
Me wanting sack boy from trick or treat :/
---
allow what?
---
Now it's hollow knight
---
Pinhead would be dope
---
This is the first good cosplay I've seen on this sub. Seriously, great job
---
I'm failing to see the issue...
---
Infinite mending was a bug and bugs don't have a place in balance discussion. And Legion was still the worst killer in the game when they had no cool down on missed swings.
---
I’m typing out the problem hold up
---
Wtf are you talking about??? I've never been banned for that. 😂😂😂😂 stop being a pusscup.
---
I'm guessing Billy will be nerfed in some way because why not? He's fine but the crybabies keep crying about him and history has proven with this game that when the crybabies all cry about something they get their way. 
---
I'd be surprised if he didn't get nerfed in some way. Now, a Leatherface re-work has me interested because you could do a lot with him and Behaviour has more incentive to make him stronger because he's licensed (thus cannot be bought for free) and that means more money for them.
---
he do be lookin kinda fresh doe 😳😳
---
Wouldn’t be a bad perk tbh, say press ‘activate ability button’ when injured and for the next x amount of seconds that survivors sounds and movement speed are 100% silent, with a cool down obviously. I’d probably run it semi often.
---
"WOAH FUCK"
---
Toxic nea Kobi's
---
just good enough to get to red ranks but not good enough to ever win at red ranks :/
---
Y'all forgot about Adam who is a literal teacher also huntress would probably have freddys head mounted on her wall if she knew what a pedo was
---
Are you aware that when people refer to this game having a bad community, they are talking about people like you?
---
Just give us a RE2 chapter already with Leon &amp; Claire as survivors and Mr. X as the killer within the police station.
---
Toxi Nea uses key and escapes via hatch
---
I would have got a heart attack
---
r/shittytumblrgifs
---
Jason would be good
---
I don't want to miss anything. Seems like im going to have to pay up as well as many others
---
Babysitter and MoM don't particularly pair well together
---
Toxic neas game crashes rendering escape invalid
---
We did it, the post is deleted, we have won
---
Unfortunately just like every season they will. Rank should get a rework. If anything then atleast make it so only good survivors can reach red ranks. It’s too easy to hold M1 and farm people while an actually good survivor loops the killer for most of the game
---
There's a summer event too right? And that's it?
---
I actually really like legion. I wouldn't mind if they got the most "votes"
---
I mean, he's basically an off brand 50% off entity, but loves children more than pizza delivery twinks. It would take a lot to do him right.
---
But I also didn't think they could make Freddy happen right. And they did... after like 20 years of not doing him right, lol.
---
cool idea but he’s technically a kid i think? idk how that would go with bhvd :/
---
Link?
---
Started at 14 since I rarely play killers, at 7 now and games pretty much look the same so far. And yeah I took into consideration the ranks, but it just seems so easy to win with her it's unreal.
---
Speaking of, what perks for her? I'm running: Ruin, Haunted, Noed, BBQ - Think it's pretty cancer already but can I make it more cancer?
---
You're kind of a dick
---
Honestly Davids line sounds like my everyday fantasy...
---
Right but without connection to the mind flayer the Demogorgon dies, the entity controlling the mind flayer would be exactly as unfitting as it controlling Pennywise.
---
I went back into the messages with him and all of my messages were removed by PlayStation Safety
---
Known bug, I'd level him though so you can get bbq
---
the tier list dbd needed, but not the one it deserved
---
Nice job on that knife man
---
I don't know a good build, but OTZDARVA, ZubatLEL and Tru3Tallent already played Ghostface with some nice builds.
---
Tip: While playing Ghostface, sometimes it's better to use his power only to walk around, not to stalk. But you gotta have a good build just for it.
---
Because what you said broke Sony’s rules.
---
He broke Sony’s rule
---
The build i run is Ruin, PGTW, Whispers, and Bbq. I'd say this is a goof build. But, whispers feels like a must on ghosty, helps early and late game to get easy stalks off. Surge can be really good as you are preferably downing survivors near gens all the time. M&amp;A is also good for the FOV, as it gives a wider stalking area, allowing for easier detection. For addons, run cooldown addons or mark duration addons. Ghost face caught on tape is also really good.
---
 **So some context for you all**  
---
3 friends and I joined a game against an M2 billy, we thought he was just trying to do his daily ritual but then he started slugging. After he downed all of us he just waited for us to bleed out. When I asked why his response was he was trying to make everyone in his games depip while he safety pips, my friends and I already reported him but I doubt that's gonna do much...
---
Oi never said it had to be quality lol
---
Does it happen at midnight EST or 8pm EST, just like the bloodweb?
---
Then he prob got dealt with as well if he did break the rules by cursing at you. You prob just don’t see it cause your banned or if not then after serve the ban report his messages back if they are really breaking Sony’s rules
---
Honestly I try so hard to resist tunneling the ones who farm the hooked survivor when I'm literally two inches away from the hook. Stop trying to screw over your teammate and just back off until I'm gone ffs
---
Dead hard, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline and Hope. If you have a team that really do gens, it's perfect.
---
I don’t think slugging is against the rules :/
---
I can’t report him because I can’t even sign in
---
With Doctor Sleep coming out soon and DbD following stephen king, I'm gonna say a Jack Torrance killer and a trip to the overlook hotel. 
---
Think of how amazing that map would be, it's got a hedge maze and the entirety of the hotel.
---
no clue, currently 00:33 on British Summer Time and the rank hasnt reset yet
---
I'm not a beginner, this is a voting thing. Just say someone
---
Thanks! And yeah, I was more looking at his live-action counterpart as opposed to his in-game counterpart, same for Quentin and Laurie.
---
I 👏 want 👏 tall 👏 man!
---
Tbh I agree but it's bullshit for both ends. Number of times I've played Huntress and thrown above a window/pallet and it hits it anyway is just infuriating. Also number of times I've went round a corner and hit 0.5sec later by an axe 1-2 pallets distance away is beyond counting.
---
Yes! He's fun
---
That’s why I said wait until the ban is over but chances are he’s already been banned if he did indeed curse you out. Have you ever been banned before? Cause 30 days is pretty damn long for a first offense and they usually for cursing give just a warning
---
Offer to slug her
---
Wait, you can actually get their teachables from this bug?
---
I like the effort
---
I think you chose wisely.
---
Yes, I got a 7 day suspension way back
---
He's saying Sony saw both of your messages when he reported you and got a nice ban himself
---
All the time. I played a game today where my frames were constantly less than 20. Guess we just have to get used to it. I really wish it will/could be fixed.
---
That actually makes a lot of sense, so gameplay wise, the killer removes them, and if they get hooked again they’re worth more bloodpoints?
---
Then that explains why you got no warning he prob is only going to get a simple warning for it unless he posted some really bad shit or was banned before. Try to be carful next time and just report
---
These are the ones that I youse:
---
Must have:
---
- Adrenalin: saved me so many time while being chased by the killer at the end of the round
---
- Dead hard: helps you out of a lot of critical situations
---
Other perks you could use:
---
- Self care: you can heal yourself if he loses you for a moment
---
- Bond: helps you to not run to your teammates while they are doing gens. You can also see if they are close to you to heal you
---
- Iron will: killer loses you faster wich gives you time and opportunities to heal yorself
---
- Decisive strike: gives you a second chance.
---
Can also help you if he's tunneling you
---
Unbreakable: Can be a second chance, but only helps you if the killer is slugging you
---
Ah, but this time they can't SWF with their rank 15 friend for effortless pips.
---
I've never heard someone refer to it as "disconnecting" before.
---
Lmao it’s not you.
---
 surv mains do seem to get confused about what happens in that basement.
---
It's just a shitty coded, inconsistent mechanic honestly. When it works, he's one of my favourite killers to play against. when it doesn't, you just get 1hit for free due to shit coding. Eg: stand on other side of pallet from one another and cannot reveal him oftentimes.
---
I think it varies depending on the killer
---
Masked killer with a machete 
---
I see what you did there behvr
---
Next chapter is gonna be original, the one after that most likely licensed
---
Iron Will Lightweight Quick n Quiet + whatever exhaustion perk you like. I like Balanced Landing the best but use what you want.
---
Yup unless he was never banned before then it is possible he just got a warning depending on what he said or posted
---
IF a child would be "immune" to the Entity why would it bring a pregnant woman in the fold? Unless it doesn't know that babies would be immune and that to me wouldn't make sense. 
---
Also.
---
Nobody seems to age in the fog so would a pregnancy even go further in there?
---
Yeah hitboxes have seemed even worse lately. But also latency issues and whatnot I guess? Number of times I fast vault and killer hits me like 0.5sec after I've already ran away from the window is insane. Whereas on killer, oftentimes hit the window when they're just finishing the fast vault animation. Just really inconsistent.
---
I also think huntress if you read her backstory.
---
Shouldn't BHVR be able to do as they please with his cosmetics though? I mean, it's not like Valve will reject money...
---
I had to look at the picture a couple times to see that it was real. Bonus points for the toxic flashlight.
---
You want Myers in a dress? T3 wouldn’t even be scary.
---
No he went to go shit in the tall grass.
---
What if you brought your last iridescent Mori but one survivor said nah fuck you
---
Match cancelled due to starting a match with 3 survivors and you lose the Mori &amp;_&amp;
---
I mean the wraith killed his boss for killing someone else if I’m right and the entity offered him something after that I believe, spirit also wanted revenge because her father killed her (? Pretty sure I read that somewhere) and the entity offered to kill the survivors
---
It’s got a lot of lore but I like the thought of disobeying the entity sometimes
---
\[Haunted Ground intensifies\]
---
When you've hooked the second to last survivor and discover the escape hatch near them.
---
Can't camp generators if there are no generators.
---
Holy shit that’s awesome if u told me this was from the game I would believe it
---
On my spirit I run Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, BBQ and Nurse's Calling.
---
Um... that’s a hospital gown, and Myer’s is getting that skin already. The post advocates for the same outfit with Laurie.
---
Imagine a child looping a killer while clicking a flashlight
---
Which splinter is hubby's?
---
Honestly a new killer should be like the thing, and you can take on the form of a survivor or maybe after you mory them you get there appearance. I don’t even play often but it really is a cool game
---
Reboot Micheal has no place in the game
---
If I glows, it goes.
---
There’s a splinter for cannibal?
---
BL or DH, OoO, maybe Quick and Adrenaline
---
No, it needs to be deleted
---
Yes the mouse can be more accurate, but enough practice on a controller might surprise ya
---
Bruh you don't deserve downvoted wtf
---
You actually have a point, if it is so easy to steal hardwork, maybe he should have put a watermark
---
Burn Iri King. Shitty add on. Let's hope the second one will be cool.
---
I understand 100%. Once you choose you character or killer it should be one of the options on the side. Haven’t played in ages so say if you find it!
---
4 man swf is just as toxic as slugging.
---
The plague has a boner for the survivors it seems
---
He can't force you to derank. You deranked because you suck. You didnt get people up. Your chases lasted 2 seconds. You did no generators. He didnt even use BBQ and chili and you finding it hard. You should be losing ranks so you can play people who aren't crushing your weak play
---
Heres a Idea, If someone DC's for survivors, If there are 4 or more gens, one gets completed instantly while the killer gets points for the hits it would of taken and hook stuff. If the killer DC's, Give the survivors a safety pip and 8k bloodpoints as a bonus and priority into them for finding lobby's for one game.
---
Yup
---
Tends to fluctuate for me but playing Demogorgon was truly a nightmare. The shitty auto aim coupled with crappy frame rates felt awful
---
Thotette would be better
---
Your welcome ur very gud
---
His worst category of add ons is purple. Chili has no upsides and the chain add ons are really crappy.
---
It's not incorrect tho, killer ques on console can be really bad I've heard while PC is not too bad unless there is a double bp weekend or new killer
---
PS4
---
Almost every one or two games my friends are put into a match and I’m left in the lobby, with their characters greyed out. 
---
Unknown error occurred kicks me out back to the main screen. 
---
Sometimes lobbies the timer will freeze and then kick everyone out.
---
you got yourself into this mess
---
I always thought pinhead was too overrated
---
It’s not the best solution at all and let’s survivors keep map pressure. But, if survivors are swarming the hook however, it leaves little options for the killer.
---
The concept of cliche is fucking stupid in this cases
---
He still likes them young 😏
---
&gt;Huntress - 
---
&gt;Little girl. Increases hatchet amount by 4.
---
I'm scared
---
You always earn a pip or more in 16-20. You cannot derank past 15. Therefore only new players will be in 16-20. That's why it takes a while. the general population far outweighs the few brand new players who are playing at that exact moment so in a few games it'll be fast.
---
???
---
Cute
---
The second one was just me making the most alternate claudette I could and the third is just supposed to be a plain outfit. The hair is what i care about the most lol
---
Yep
---
Thanks! Just posted the finished version with the mask
---
He was running a slugging build and you were playing as a 4 man SWF which should have completely countered it, it’s your own fault you all got downed. Yes it’s a crappy way to play as is when a Killer camps however it’s not against the rules, and with those points none of you seemingly did anything.
---
I totally forgot about Bill’s cameo in the first Payday game. It would be nice to have that outfit.
---
While she may be underwhelming compared to some killers she still good in the state she is now if you know how to play her but what you are suggesting is just kind of ridiculous SOME add ons do need reworking but her power is fine aside from needing a few minor buffs
---
Maybe, but I remember seeing a timer that did that months ago. It would say: "estimated time: X "
---
I honestly haven't seen toxic neas that much and im in purple ranks, idk maybe its the server im on but my friend whos literally across the country has the same issue but idk if it is how it is now, if this is just for shits and giggles now, or if their still is toxic neas and i just haven't encountered any
---
hmmmmm.....nah.
---
Only for Wraith mains with Big Brains
---
I just want chucky...
---
Lol yeah I tried again and realised I didn’t know what the ability button was and it didn’t work again
---
Its one of my favorite, most satisfying moments in game. In fact, it may be bad because I want to get it in so badly I take more risks. But its fun to be able to do something other than run!
---
Destiny Comp. Its much better now but it used to lock behind crucial PVE weapons behind it.
---
I mean, if you let something as simple as copyright infringement derail you in this day and age, and you're not a multi-million dollar company, maybe you're not motivated enough in the first place. Yes, it's wrong, and should be fixed, but to quit over some rando posting your work somewhere else? Happens to every content creator rather frequently, I'm sure. Also, raising an issue about the problem can be publicity in and of itself, so it's hardly a loss ultimately.
---
Played against a 3 man SWF most toxic group I ever played against. 
---
2 had instant medkit and ofc the David King is sporting a decked out flashlight. 
---
They used every pallet to its fullest potential, David King looped me for days Tbagging and moonlighting me the whole time.
---
Oh yeah and they SANDBAGGED THE RANDOM JAKE.
---
Like 8 TIMES they led me to their poor random Jake player. 
---
After like 40 minutes I managed to slug the 3 SWF, I caught Jake trying to heal one. 
---
So I slugged him, brought him to the Gate and opened it for him. LOL, he turned towards me before crawling away as I proceeded to hunt down my other 3 slugs for dinner. 
---
I will never forget post game chat, they were all so pissed and salty. At the Jake too it was hilarious. 
---
He was the only one working on gens the whole game. 
---
It felt like the other 3 dudes were playing literally just to be toxic assholes. I never caught any of them working on Gens. Just looting my chests and slamming pallets down.
---
Plague should be jus a lil bit as prior to getting infected herself was seen as a healer
---
Rofl that made me laugh. I swear people blame everything on dedicated servers now. Most of the stuff people complain about was happening years ago. DBD is just a really buggy game. Something always seems to happen. That grab was pretty bs though.
---
Laughs in country with free university
---
Is the bottom left Feng Min?
---
the first outfit with the third hairstyle ♥
---
Bubba is now Mr Worldwide
---
That would be pretty sweet
---
Just make sure other people don’t steal her totem so she can get all of her points.
---
it's the bone splinter
---
Yeah there’s a lot of situations where DCs happen in weird interactions, and then of course there’s all ‘you dared to tab out on the loading screen’ DC
---
I'd really enjoy a "The Thing" killer. Maybe it's true form could be a mass of tentacles and appendages, and it's ability could be to take the form of someone it's hooked? That way you can't really trust everyone? Could be freaking sweet. With Mac as the survivor too? Oh baby
---
