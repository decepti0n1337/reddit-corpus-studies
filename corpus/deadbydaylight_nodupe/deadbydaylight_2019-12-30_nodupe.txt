Move with purpose needs a slight change since it’s the same from rank 1-3. Should probably scale 40/50/60.

---
How are they nerfing him?
---
Theres a black cord on the ground from the shop to the bowsers.
---
I would think Frank would be asking Suzie...
---
Is Frank cheating on Julie with Suzie?
---
I got my first ever 4K with billy on Hawkins but that was a total fluke I think. It’s probably the worst map for Billy (equal with Lerys memorial institute) but it is doable. I usually just give up on trying to chainsaw and just accept that I’m an M1 killer for the duration of the game.
---
I believe it’s based on the perks they come with. And assuming you’re using those 3 perks.
---
I've seen it, both sides are toxic
---
Suzie was the nervous one to join, so this is him basically pulling her into the gang.
---
The perfect cover up, you genius!

Thank you. I was wondering if I was losing it today. Played maybe 15 games and got almost no coordinated teams. Of course it was when I was recording so I have a bunch of potato games instead of interesting ones haha.
---
LMAO!
---
I can hear generators, injured breathing, (unless iron will) and totems being cleansed. If I pay attention well enough, I can hear the grass moving and someone leaving or entering a locker. Then they're like "HACKER!!!!" or "stream sniper" when I find them.
---
They are available. You just have to kill Meg, Dwight, Claudette, and Jake a certain amount of times to get their faces
---
***iS tHaT a JoJo ReFeReNcE?***
---
I’ve been disconnected several times as survivor today, I don’t know what’s happening but it’s been quite bad today and it’s frustrating as fuck.
---
Me looking at Nurse: Look at how they massacred my girl... 
---

---
Otr though Watching Killer gameplay is always fun, but I've become increasingly bored watching Survivor gameplay over the year.
---
It's almost like the devs are making the game to easy for the survivors. Oh wait...
---
Had a go at creating an edit for a fan made Tapp cosmetic. I’m not very good at any sort of photo editing so please excuse the quality, I did it on a few minutes using photo editing apps. It’s an outfit worn by the same actor that plays Tapp (Danny Glover) in a different film. Although it does looks like he’s skipped leg day :/
---
Hahaha
---
Are you PC or console ?
---
That's not what he means. yes P2P doesn't need dedicated servers but the game still had game servers so that it can track and save everything you do. These game servers must make sure that everyone that logs on is using the latest version, if not it just won't let them connect
---
Anyone else run circles over that thing and ding it 20 times a match?
---
You have provoked a gang war
---
Same, it hasn’t happened to me in game as survivor but it happens to me when I’m trying to find a match, or when it connects to a lobby and then says I’ve been disconnected.
---
honestly, at least you did feel guilty and knew you did a dick move , even with him tunneling you hard core . some peoples egos r way too bloated to admit theyre intoxicating the game
---
Shes absolute trash on console though, even pre-nerf let alone now
---
&gt;It's not supposed to be easy to survive a super-natural killer 
---
FTFY
---
Ok boomer.
---
Console. Xbox if it makes a difference.
---
It's exactly that. Killers have this too, though it does still factor their powers as well, it's basically a summary of how well each character performs based on how they were intended to be played, and how doing so turned out for the majority of players.
---
Its tough for both, lot of wah killer hit me once discos and asshat tb at gate/hatch from survivors. Lot of sweaty killers not wanting survivors to get any bloodpoints and wipe team asap
---
more like
---
you *cant* see
---
I hate people that are this toxic, the match was super unfair and you probably had no way of winning and he still had to throw in a “gg ez” like he didn’t have to rub it in

THIS IS TOO FUNNY

Just had it happen to me, switched right back to survivor lol

[removed]

Something that made me smile is when I was playing pig and had a pretty bad game but at the exit gates the survivors all booped my snoot and gave me a gg so that made my day

Good to know. Trying to rank up as quickly as possible. The game is so good in general I just hope they can put some amount of performance issue focus on the Switch version.
---
+ 15 min wait times. Flashlight and pallet abusing teabagging lil shits
---
Freddy's slowdown addons are next to use less now.
---
6% progress penalty became 2%.
---
His only good addons are his Teleport speed ones now.
---
This was incredibly well put. Definitely made me rethink using it. It sounds so good on paper but it simply takes too long and you’re absolutely right about getting comfortable with being injured. I’m definitely guilty of not being comfortable in a game if I’m not healthy!
---
the wraith showed up and i was the first to get smacked in the face
---
Just had a 4 man swf with 3 flashlights and a toolbox, they were all higher ranks than me and they made sure to teabag and the exits and message me to gloat afterwards lmao some people just can’t win gracefully
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
he definitely watches ninja
---
Oh damn... it really do be like that sometimes. Shame it wasn’t ghostface because he could have joined in.
---
Claudette.... Bush..... Home
---
Don't give up, just like in life. When people insult your capabilities, use it as motivation to get better. Then go back, and squash the little assholes.
---
Yeah, feels bad man. I just started playing killer again after a 1 month hiatus. For the most part i'm having fun. But when you get that one match on blood lodge against a 3/4-man SWF, you kinda wana give up on life. Lol.
---
Yes
---
I like how high ranks think theyre the shit for fucking with a low rank
---
Well I mean that’s a given. Everybody’s seen it with this game. I’ve just had worse experience with survivors when I play killer rather than vise versa
---
Thanks man :) I’m reassured by the fact a better killer than me will destroy them in another match lol
---
Named Aidan. Spongebob meme avatar. Uses the word 'dud' for dude.

My guess is 14-16 years old.

yuis got the coolest cosmetics imo, and come on, elf dweet is iconic and you know im gonna wear it even in july
---
yui
---
Since I’m always solo survivor I usually vow to help my teammates as much as I possibly can because in the long run that benefits us all. The only times I won’t go for a save is if I’m on a near-finished gen, being chased, or the person is on the complete other side of the map while I’m working on a gen. I also try to distract the killer as much as possible if they’re after an injured survivor/if they’re coming towards a gen that I’m working on with another person. I like to take the aggro as much as possible since I feel more of a sense of obligation being solo.
---
O P E R A T I O N H E A L T H
---
I used to be quite good at killer, but I took a break from it and played survivor, and now I just can’t play the same way lol. I can stand losing but when people are being toxic because they know you can’t beat them, that’s when I want to just delete the game lmao
---
I play both, and have fun a both, you just gotta have the bad ones to recognize the good ones. Also the bad ones can help point out flaws in play style. Ignore the hate this community is way too aggressive. Just do your best an have fun. Its just a game, and rank in this game gets you nothing anyways.
---
It isn't the same.
---
The primary effects are the same, but the recovery time is longer for lower ranks of the perk.
---
This is the same as every other exhaustion perk.
---
Yeah I mainly play survivor because I play with a friend nd we both just go good ol toolbox and gen. But if you wanna do your challenges and you actually see other survivors it kinda feels like you wanna kick the shit out of them.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Mike startles me every single time without fail.
---
It increases the chance of finding rare items
---
That’s true dude. Wish everyone thought the same
---
imagine faking the lift with your SB ready
---
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST MAKE IT THAT BAG ADDONS DONT CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF TRAPS ON THE MAP I just dont want to feel like I need a bag to be able to cover a three gen
---
Exactly lol as survivor I hate when I see others teabag and flashlight spam bc I know how that shit feels as killer
---
Well I mean the 6% was a bit much maybe if they reduced it down to something like 4% it wouldn't be so bad
---
Lol!  I was seriously thinking I was in the Twilight Zone or some shit lol.  Yeah Haddonfield is crazy survivor sided.
---
So what I am to gather from your statement is: "no matter how much data the devs collect, I will continue to call them trash and say killers are UP and survivors are too OP, even if they CLEARLY have an over 60% kill ratio, because I read one forum post and think I know how data works and thus can ignore it".
---
News flash, with 3 months of data collected it is enough, taking in count items, addons et, to clearly determine that killers are way more powerful than they should be, even the killers people say are shit, like Legion, Pig, Wraith etc. Just because the data doesn't collide with YOUR world view, does not mean that the data is wrong or that "we need more variables dammit".
---
What, are you just gonna continue to ask for variables until you get that nieche part where is shows that survivors escape more often than they die or something? This community is such a joke.
---
I basically only have the one blink - I can never figure out how long I can charge the second blink for before the cooldown.
---
OK zoomer
---
It's a clear bug abuse, record it and send the video to support to gift them a ban.
---
Doesn't seem fair that it's impossible to be hit though
---
This looks so much better than normal. They should keep it.
---
[ everybody liked that ]
---
I do agree, but get this.
---
The 9% addon, is now 3%...
---
I do agree 9% was too much, but 3% is almost nothing.
---
i play swf with a red rank , yellow rank and green rank when i am rank 13 and we always manage to land a red rank
---
feelsbadman
---
Omg the RUSH for the mori, love it 😂
---
Try experimenting when you go into games, try to extend it as much as you can and if it doesn’t work shorten it until you got it right, I’d say you’ve got about a second or 2 to charge the blink
---
It doesn't even look like the legion lol
---
Like it's funny how survivors call out toxic killers but when you do not camp, tunnel, slug and play by the unofficial rules and times they survive they say shit like too ez. Like atleast respect the killer for not being a "dick"
---
Dewit
---
F
---
If I know I’m dead or not getting out, I don’t wiggle, I just give up. Rarely gets me the hatch, but idc, cause I gave up anyway
---
Killer used to only be graded on number of sacrifices and that was awful. Multiple people posted here how they were able to insidious camp their way to rank 1. NOED was much stronger because it would single handedly lead to a safety, single, or double pip. The current system is seriously flawed but I'd rather have this than the tunnel/camp meta from before. 
---
Besides, lorewise your goal is not just to kill. It's to fill the survivors with the hope of escape before crushing it.
---
60 seconds of sprint that builds up 3 seconds per 1 second of sprinting = 20 seconds of 3% speed increase
---
50 seconds of sprint that builds up 2.5 seconds per 1 second of sprinting = 20 seconds of 3% speed increase
---
40 seconds of sprint that builds up 2 seconds per 1 seconds of sprinting = 20 seconds of 3% speed increase
---
Unless I’m missing something there seems to be no benefit for ranking it up. Maybe if the speed leveled 2/3/4%
---
You cant punish people for something outside of the game. The game has to recognize something happening in game in order to cause players to lose the perks. In this case, the game would be recognizing that you are grouping up with friends, and thus it would decrease the perk slots. So no, you're not being punished for voice communication, as that is only an assumption by the developers. You're being punished by the game for playing with friends.
---
Definitely wasn’t too much. Gen speed needs nerfed.
---
The bottom one I’m CRYING. See how you like being there for a million years, sir!!!!
---
It is abusing a bug but then you just get to stand there and camp until they do something. And if they complain at the chat dunk on em since you had a reson. A sirvivor was there and you couldnt hit him
---
Yeah that's definitely not good but then again no one wants forever freddy back.
---
Yeah lol. I used to watch their perspective after playing with them to see what they were doing, what they were commenting about and other stuff (Half of time they were shittalking me, which was sad to see). It was a nice to see where I could've done better or where I could've looked to make my life easier.
---
Daddy Tapp
---
Exactly! I always try to be a fair killer and play in ways that I’d like the killers I play against to play like (not tunnelling, camping etc) but some survivors just make you want to get rid of that bc they treat you the same way regardless lol
---
Yeah, playing killer really humbles you. I used to t-bag and flashlight click when I first got the game in mid-2018. Played wraith, got bodied a few times, and learned how it feels. i think these players need to experience the same thing.
---
They didn't even do the last second switch correctly.
---
I have reached Rank 1 (or played at while getting wins) on PS4 with every single killer (I did Leatherface before I’d even got ruin, humble brag) except Pig and hag (I find them so boring I cba to learn them, but I could probably rank 1 them), and Oni as I sold my PS4 and got a switch before he came out.
---
On PC I have reached rank 1 using a controller with the base killers + myers and leatherface but I haven’t bought anyone else (I play survive with friends on PC). 
---
In general the survivors across PS4, PC and Switch are of the same skill I’ve found, but brown rank switch players are way worse than PC and PS4 (though they get better fast). 
---
Killer on PC is a bit easier to play thanks to the higher frame rate. I use controller but I assume KbM players will find it easier then, especially Huntress, Nurse and Clown. Theres far more toxic SWF on PS4 but that’s slightly balanced out by the 30fps making consistent great skill checks harder. 
---
But in general it’s about the same difficulty to reach red ranks across all consoles.
---
Killer is soul destroying, I respect all of you killer mains. Apart from campers &amp; tunnellers y’all can suck my ass.
---
That’s definitely true. If people knew how it felt to be on the receiving end of it, they wouldn’t do it
---
As a killer main, all I can say is either block them. Or, grow an extra set of nuts and chad on them.
---
I came here to comment this, but I knew in my heart that it had already been said.
---
Nurse wasn't killed at high ranks, it made her skill ceiling higher so now there's less nurses over the already low amount there were. Trapper is a bug, i highly doubt they intend for trapper to always get stuck
---
i use that head cosmetic too. the curls r so cute :)

Which sucks especially with all the horrible shit they're doing to their neighbouring countries. They're just power hungry pieces of shit

I always respond to them and call them out for being dicks but sometimes I wonder if that’s just what they want lol
---
The edit killed me, much like the scenario.
---
Agreed
---
Okok, you win.
---
Please don't send the gang members after me.
---
No it was a bit much but I dont think survivors want to hold m1 all game
---
Bill cus l4d
---
ive played both and xbox has a lot more freddy at r1, pc has a lot more huntress and nurse
---
“Laughs in mad grit”
---
100/10 would buy and main him
---
60/50/40 seconds of *Exhaustion* that builds up over 20 seconds of sprinting.
---
The effects of the perk are *identical* across all levels.
---
The only difference is that with T1, you need to wait 60 seconds to fully recover, and at T3 you need to wait 40 seconds to fully recover.
---
Then why are they testing out punishments for it? 
---
It's a shitty trait and spoils the enjoyment of the game. Maybe find another game that you're good at where you don't have use the "disconnect" loop hole
---
holup u can get banned?  its not even a ranked match, you dont earn anything from customs
---
Why is this hated on? I've always wondered... Is it just selfish player building?
---
And killers don’t like it when five gens pop in under four minutes
---
Yeah but not only a little but much
---
Pretty cool concept but I think the backstory needs more work I saw that your not as good as writing but it could definitely use some QOL improvements since it sounds like you pasted The Spirit's backstory and edited it
---
i knew i was about to die against a pig, so i tried to boop her snoot 
---
i thought she was accepting my friendship offering, but she downed me :(
---
The funny thing is I'll see killer-mains, t-bagging, and flashlight clicking when they play Survivor as well. 
---
So a survivor did it to you, and your reaction is to do the same to another killer... Some people  XD
---
Soon this game will break and consume your soul and life. We Always love fresh meat around here...
---
 So innocent
---
People continue to wonder why survivor que times are so long at red ranks.
---
I do this. I don’t know why as a killer main I do this but I do this
---
Fair enough
---
I know, right?
---
Some of these are stretching it lol
---
This is brilliant lmao
---
Are you really suggesting nerfing killers further?  Christ.
---
That made me laugh really hard in a while. You get an upvote and a special thing called, A FOLLOW.
---
They’re trying to fix it bcuz it’s annoying not unfair, u dc, ur annoying, but u didn’t cheat, just deprived everyone of something
---
me my pal and 2 randoms all just crouched and stared into a fire barrel for like 5 minutes straight
---
Specifically each survivor 25 times
---
I highly recommend a film called THE FURIES. It's literally DBD with a twist.
---
MOVIE SPOILER BELOW
---
.
---
. 
---
Group of survivors wake up to find they're being hunted by killer types in the woods. What they dont realise is that they're paired with a killer... they die, the killer dies.  😱😱😱😱 
---
SPOILER END
---
A gory as fuck slasher film which is amazing with the twist.
---
Is this the hot new game ‘Not Alive Before Sunrise’?
---
Nurse is still very good. The rework really barely weakened her.
---
Neither side is supposed to be easy. But this is a thread about killer nerfs, so I thought I’d stay on topic
---
This just happened to me too, rip.
---
Then maybe change the wording of the first bit, “if you are not exhausted the perk actives. Once you reach full exhaustion the perk deactivated until you are not exhausted again.”
---
Your phrasing assumes that you can only not use the perk when at full exhaustion. I do really like the idea of the perk though, it’s different for an exhaustion type perk
---
if they cant do gens near em, and your ruin spawns on the opposite end of the map, youre kinda fucked
---
I say this shit all the time
---
Yes, after doing any research, apparently this is a thing, tis a little convoluted, and you need someone with the same exact build/ setup as you. Examples of a tutorial: https://youtu.be/2Z_QhPvlZpY , according to steam discussions, it's not bannable either.
---
it was he’s just dumb lol
---
You pet that woman right now!
---
Yeah I get it but they have to keep the game interactive, if they slowed gens down to much then it would get boring playing survivor.
---
He's not saying red rank and yellow rank survivors and killers are the same. He's saying that BHVR keeps putting red ranks against yellow ranks. You have pointed out how they are different in their skill levels. That is why this is funny is because we all know they are different skill levels yet BHVR keeps putting red ranks against yellow ranks and 1 side ends up shitting on the other. You some how have understood the concept of the rank meme but not the BHVR part of the meme.
---
And all of them are still good.
---
I misread the first time too, that it only worked when already exhausted from a different perk, but 0 exhaustion is still less than 40, so it activates
---
last I saw IAMcows got banned from it
---
Of course! With the very cool life take awayers, Pokey Floor Decorations, Invisible Churchbell Striking Black Man, and nnnnnnnNNNNNNNNNYYYYYYOOOOOoooommmm
---
This sounds amazing. Looking it up right meow.
---
Edit: I can't find it. Got a YouTube link to the trailer?
---
Edit 2: found it. It's only available in the US on Shudder. This looks bonkers! Can't wait to watch. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Another good response is act completely wholesome. “GG EASY BABY KILLER” “ Good job guys! You all played exceptionally well!”
---
Must... do.... generators.....
---
well hit them before they sit under the hook it is not impossible to counter
---
Because they're pointing out a common theme and venting frustration in how frequent it happens
---
Don’t forget the terrifying life taker awayer coming soon, the common cold!
---
This is one of the few things I actually agree with when I have never thought about it before.
---
They read the front top page posts. They have for years, ever since this was a tiny subreddit. The Legion balance is a complex issue that's taking them years to figure out, so it's not as easy as 'fix it.'
---
And they're also well aware of the accessibility request. But until now we aren't shaming them strongly or sternly enough though. We need to move to make the transition from meme to disability advocacy for that.
---
its actually an issue with textures. Huntress can throw hatchets through walls in the shack in certain places, its not new. The other one place I know about is left from the shack entrance beside the box which is the only place to hide from her if shes standing behind a pallet, she can simply hit you through the wall, lol. I also witnessed it on streams, so it isn't about servers, really. Its exploiting.
---
Coming soon: The floating female healer
---
Haha that’s true. They wouldn’t know what to respond if there was no salt lmao
---
a simple meme but i can't stop laughing, can always rely on this subreddit to cheer me up
---
That's exactly how it works.
---
That’s true, some people complain about it and yet continue the cycle of toxicity lol
---
If you've never played her it's hard to learn her. You also have to pay attention to how many blinks you have, which isn't easy to do while you're in a chase.
---
Lithe off a pallet when the killer is trying to mind game the loop and making them miss is quickly becoming a favorite move.
---
What do you mean? This is DBD right down to the ping.
---
That's true
---
She's supposed to be difficult to learn. Such a powerful killer should require more skill to be used effectively.
---
How exactly are you going to break line of sight 24/7?
---
You have to constantly make the correct calls or you will die, you just have to hope to god you can read her
---
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

I truly believe that if you're using disconnect as a viable tactic either killer or survivor you're gonna do it more than once in a session. Three times from logon to the third time you disconnect auto autoban for 24 hours.
---
I've had two separate discussions on this forum today with people seeming to think disconnecting is not cheating... 
---
Don't announce the bans.  Let them do what they do and catch them in the trap and wait for the salty tears here and on twitter.
---
Create some killers and survivors crying animations to respond to them in twitter. 👍 Job done..
---
Please Behave.
---
Literally the very first response to my criticism about spamming shitposts was a commenter defending how there is little to no difference between player skill in yellow and red rank.
---
Nice
---
*RUB RUB*
---
This is very detailed! Thank you. I had figured there was not much of a difference but I don't have the experience to say so.
---
Aliven’t next to brightness
---
What
---
In what way is she powerful? I've never had any trouble playing against her base kit and not at all after the changes.
---
Hawkins is the only great indoor killer map. There's only a couple of safeish pallets with the rest of them being bloodlust breakers (unsafe). Totems are usually ridiculously hidden (finally) I rate it the most visually appealing indoor map.
---
The Game is hell unless you are Doc, Nurse, Freddy, or Spirit. There's a couple of unsafe pallets with the other 10+ pallets being 100% safe and / or unable to be mindgamed. I rate this a killers nightmare.
---
Lerys is... okay. It's got a good balance of unsafe and safe pallets but has a lot of windows leading to safe pallets. The totems are hidden pretty well for killers but not unreasonably hidden (a couple of spawns are bad but most are good) I rate it the most fun indoor map to play on.
---
He feels way better to play. I can see how anyone that used the sloppy/thana would feel like it was a nerf, but I have done nothing but great with my games after the change. It was absolutely a buff.
---
Therapist: The Tregion isn’t real, he can’t hurt you.
---
The Tregion:
---
YOU WANNA TRIP? I'LL BRING IT TO YA
---
&gt;  grow an extra set of nuts 
---
I actually imagined what that'd look, and feel like. lol
---
But regardless these posts are stupid.  They just copy and paste over the same tired used and abused a million times over meme templates.  Do something different worth posting.  I love the Office but I could do going 10 seconds between seeing this template spammed on here.
---
Wasn't Freddy's addons nerfed, too? I think survivors get way too comfortable with maps. Every match should be randomly generated to keep the suspenseful atmosphere. The fact many killers lose their momentum after certain ranks is no fun. Everyone needs variety.
---
*No One Escapes Steve*
---
Plz explain
---
Ok, listen here you little shhh...
---
I was watching a DBD stream of my friends playing and we joked that the reason Michael wasn’t showing up was bc he was out buying snacks and juice, so I made this later that night. That’s abt all the context I can offer LOL
---
It’s called a hook tech and the counter is to just not swing and wait for them to make a play.
---
What is "SWF"?
---
This was extremely satisfying
---
Here's the problem. The killers are OP at lower ranks. The survivors are OP at higher ranks. And it's about even at middle ranks. You change one it will greatly affect the other. Make killers stronger, lower ranks are completely fucked and mid ranks now killer is OP. Same the other way. Make survivor stronger then killers are completely fucked at high ranks and survivors are OP at middle ranks. There's no magic solution that works.
---
She can literally teleport through walls and pallets and shit, making many otherwise safe loops or structures way less safe. She can teleport long distances to traverse the map quickly. I'm convinced you've never encountered a good Nurse.
---
Like killers.
---
Survive with friends. Sometimes you can tell a group was a SWF group if the ranks are drastically different
---
Steve because his scoops outfit is top tier. It’s illegal to kill a scoops Steve.
---
Is that Riley Reid
---
Calm down, hes suggesting that devs find a way to correctly nerf killers instead of out right destroying them. Stop being so salty and just read.
---

---
How do you expect them to gain a fanbase when nobody knows who you are? Who is going on Twitch sorting for people with low to no views (a minority) and the luck of them clicking on you?
---
To get away with that, you would need to essentially become a content creator for a brand new game because there will be a low amount of streamers and if you are good it'll be way easier.
---
I can loop good Nurses even if I suck at survivor. I've played against them a lot in SWFs with higher ranked survivors that it's easy for me to loop a Nurse compared to something like Plague or Huntress.
---
Yeah and? So what if they use the same meme template. The content for it is what makes it funny. I usually see these and either chuckle or just nod and agree to it. It's better then using a text post to say the same thing. I'd rather then see a meme even if the template is used a million times then a text box trying to make the same joke. If you don't like it then downvote the post and get on with your day but don't try to shit on OP for using a meme template that fits the joke he is making perfectly.
---
Killers are just suppose to make the game fun apparently, let them leave the hook 2 times if you want to score big. if your an effective killer and manage to kill a surv on a second or first hook then you lose out on points.
---
You haven't seen how stupid most of the internet is, then, buddy?
---
Just because they made a post about it doesn't mean we have to like it.
---
why say big word when little word do trick
---
Apparently they aren't that good if you can loop them so easily.
---
He looks like such a weirdo lol
---
Watch AaronPlaysTV on YT.  He did a video where he showcased Billy’s strength on Hawkins.  Almost every single pallet is unsafe to the point he was guaranteed a chainsaw down at each one.

I felt this deep in my soul.
---
can't relate, most of my killer matches are more enjoyable than my survivor matches. I don't cry when a survivor teabags me, nor does it impede me from playing the game. Though when a killer is toxic to a survivor it usually consists of facecamping and hardcore tunneling which ruins the match for everyone and creates boring matches.
---
Dude, after she got "changed" I have only played against her TWICE and both times she got absolutely destroyed against non SWF team. I know this because I play at red ranks on a daily basis. All I see at red ranks are Freddy, Huntress, Spirit and Trapper (probably because of tome challenges) in that order from greatest to least. Also, of course the infinite trapper bug is unintentional, but come on that is a game breaking bug as a result from a different bug from months ago. They legit take forever to fix ONE bug. I'm not saying one bug should be fixed overnight, but come on. The fact that they take months to fix the trapper trapping himself after setting a trap (first bug) and then him getting infinitely getting himself trapped (second bug) is crazy. Meanwhile, they are over here making live streams discussing future content or how they are on social media answering questions, but not really answering the important ones because of their infamous trademark, "soon". It bothers me, especially for a guy that plays this game on a daily basis.
---
Im lost. Where can i see the changes?
---
ye hehehaha
---
Haha yes I have played quite a few games the last couple days. So thrilling when you finally escape!
---
Haven't developed my web enough, so I don't have Make Your Choice with her, but that just sounds like more reason to power up my Piggy!

---
I never let anyone go but poor dweets that arent ready to fly yet get killed last unless they act up but it is the thought that matters just like Christmas
---
hyuckhuckhyck
---
They could make it so a gens have to have a part installed before they can be repaired. The parts can be found around the map at chest spawns. That way it’s not just more M1
---
I give hatch even if they wiggle. Depending on how I annoyed I was that match
---
I did watch it.  However, he had to use purple moonshine, no?  And the survivors threw down pallets early instead of camping them until he came close, which is the opposite of what you want to do at unsafe pallets.
---
Well I meant eventually you’ll fall prey to the toxicity most likely, but sure
---
That's perfect, exactly what I want. Thanks so much!
---
bc technically there can be more killer challenges I think idk tho
---
Yes. I’m not playing the damn Hag get over it!
---
Yessssss
---
Caaaaaaaaaan do! Currently running Devour/Ruin/Discordance/wildcard. Sometimes Rancor, if I'm working on the Archive and need kills, sometimes NOED, if I'm feeling weird: Deerstalker. Hoping I pull Thrill of the Hunt for some Hex security.
---
Thanks, I've seen it a lot in this sub and didn't know what it meant.
---
Nooooo don’t kill the dweets 😔
---
no its my mom
---
Okay. That’s your opinion.
---
Dead ones
---
ik it's a sin
---
LMAO mood
---
I love playing in a swf with my friends but solo queue is just so damn disappointing. I'll be sneaking around the hook waiting for the killer to leave so I can get a safe unhook, but then all of the sudden one of my teammates sprint in and just farm the other person who either goes down immediately or doesn't even get a chance to heal up before they're being chased again. It's always when the hooked guy isn't even close to the next state too. It's so frustrating to see when I'm running BT and We'll make it. When I'm solo I just play killer to avoid that chaos.
---
E
---
The hells a pip
---
How
---
Tho in all honesty haddonfield does feel like a chore to do. Worst map in the game. Hate it no matter if i play surv or killer.
---
I like Hawkins and Lery’s tho
---
Such a genuine scare.  Dbd still got it.
---
All the stalking killers mess with me. Spine chill is a must.
---
it's not opinion that usually a survivor being toxic ruins the gameflow and actively brings the game to a halt. Teabagging and flashlight clicking doesn't stop anyone from playing and is usually detrimental to the one doing it.
---
Same can't be said when a killer is doing the same kinda of things to a survivor. Both outcomes make you look like a dick, but one actively makes the match less fun for ALL players.
---
Stupid ones who waste pallets. And farm other survivors in front of me.
---
The Nurse is still top 2 killer
---
It’s okay, they’ll evolve in to Dweards with flashlights in no time.
---
You can tell how far they'll go based on how far up or down they're looking.
---
I agree, solo queuing as survivor can be so frustrating bc sometimes it feels like you’re the only one doing anything or you get teammates that fuck you over immediately lol
---
Why did you use the 3rd k and not the 2nd lol?
---
Okay
---
Hahaha they can be very very handy. It’s like having a little assistant.
---
Cute! Nice shading too
---
This man knows.
---
I think hag is one of the few killers that are actually strong on haddonfield. The rest just have a hard time
---
Agree to disagree I suppose.  I just wish this sub had more substance but it's 80% fluff (Shitposts and memes).  Obviously you're fine with that and that's your right.
---
Thought I’d try and spread it out 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
But if I can tell they're an actual baby and not just an overcocky ass hole, I'll show them mercy. Chase about everyone else, but them.
---
Oh god, I'm gay and I know what this is ☹️
---
It just proves that people are apparently really bad at the game, I've had no issue with sacrificing four people in the basement, did it on my first try. Also today I was just playing killer cause I already finished the tome and basically I got that exact challenge again people really overestimate how hard it is.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for dark sense it's also really not that hard to do it, I personally got it after 3 games and a friend of mine got it in her first game.
---
(Both are red ranks btw)
---
Trapper isn't terrible there either but yeah just trap killers basically.
---
It also meshes with the detection perk
---
1. She didn't throw a hatchet, it was an M1 in the video
---
2. If this is true, that's an issue with collision, not textures.
---
We need a Legion rework, A REWORK
---
Quentin bc I kinda feel bad for him, how he ended up where he did instead of living a normal life after surviving a nightmare. I have sympathy for this character. Also love his physique and those few cosmetics he has. Also, his iconic unique beauty, hes just wholesome xd. My beloved main. 
---
And Claudette bc shes a beautiful woman of color and suits my stealthy playstyle with her casual dark/pale cosmetics (not a blendette tho).
---
Do you have a clip of that?
---
Steve
---
Yeah same, but I chase the babies for a bit to scare them and then leave them alone 😂
---
Think its just you on this one
---
Especially an ahoy boi 🥺
---
Imagine needing to use an exhaustion perk to get around faster. 
---
This post was made by Fixated gang
---
The problem I have with Lithe is the fact it basically forces you to leave the tile. That way you might go from safe spot like killer shack to complete dead zone. If you choose to not leave the tile Lithe is useless and gives almost no value.
---
Nancys and Kates.
---
Devotion is the worst. You get less rewards at the beginning till LV 70. I'm devotion 7 now, it's so pointless.. I'm glad that you got really far tho x
---
As a Nancy main ily
---
Of course! Why didn’t I think of that?
---
For my team it does.
---
The way you worded it kinda makes it hard to see the sarcasm. Remember sarcasm isn’t always as easily portrayed through text
---
Whatcha mean claudette got good hair pieces, she got her curls, her braids, her purple &amp; red hair and her dreads
---
She looks super cute I love it ! And you made that skirt work 😍.
---
Ngl that was a horror movie twist.
---
I'll agree to that. This sub has always had the same content with the occasional big brain play. It's not gonna change so I don't see the point in getting mad at people for doing the same thing the sub has always done.
---
I think that's what's most frustrating to me about end game chats where the killer is complaining about this challenge. You can't expect to hard camp basement from first hook and get this challenge done. Even if survivors didn't know about this challenge (and they do, and most of them will do anything in their power to not give it to you once they realize what's up), anyone with more than two brain cells should understand to just stay away from basement at that point.
---
The times I've seen killers get this were the times they put pressure on the survivors early, got a few hooks, and then went to the basement later when everyone was on at least second stage.
---
Ah yes, my bad, I watched with no sound, its connection then, for sure. And yes, collision, its just called different in my language (literally textures), I guess it should be collision.
---
Ahahahahahah love it. Can’t see him, can’t see you. Perfect
---
Pair rancor with remember me and kill that obsession, that fucker doesnt suffer the penalty.
---
Oh yeah forgot about trapper. Hag just comes to mind since it is one of the few maps that are small enough for her to always be able to teleport without addons.
---
She’s a beast on that map
---
&gt;i cant 180 boohoo
---
Most of my games I just want it to get to 3 tokens so i can form survivors in one hit and go for a slugfest.  But it’s not really a great perk, but it can be really fun when it works out.
---
Possibly, but it's rather disappointing that almost all of his Very Rare cosmetics are like that. He could benefit from having some more variation.
---
Also Hallowed Blight Billy isn't goofy and neither is his Scarecrow outfit with the broken noose around his neck; it is possible to give him outfits that don't look silly.
---
well that is why it is legal
---
Well 20 seconds of exhaustion is less than 40,  which means it would be active, so I assumed you could “99%” the perk and keep it going for longer periods
---
Remember this as a general rule:
---
**wiggling:** 0 chance of escape, guaranteed death
---
**not wiggling:** very low chance of escape, noy guaranteed survival
---
The odds are slim, but theyre still odds.
---
I cant do the 4x basement sacrifice challenge. Every single game, 100% of my attempts, a survivor disconnects once they realise what I'm trying to do. I've had a few people stay in after game chat just to laugh that they ruined it.
---
Cheers :)
---
Country girls make do
---
But u can’t hit em once they’re there that’s the thing, if I’m chasing them, hit them, and then they run for cover under a hooked survivor, WHAT NOW
---
She looks like she put on Waterproof Makeup and took a toaster (that was plugged on) and shoved it into her stone cold bath.
---
Do you tell people to kill themselves before kr after the wholesome time?
---
Ah yes, the sub 3 viewer streamers who try and advertise their twitch channel with TTV in their name.
---
I was on my rank 20 friends account being nice to survivors and 2 people dc'd so i just farmed with the other 2 and had a nice talk in chat
---
Actually play well on other people's streams. I know of at least 5 players that are excellent at this game who if they decided to start dreaming I would support. They don't need to advertise.
---
Imo if they worled their ass off but lost because of the others, theyre good to go, granted they were respectable.
---
Such as, if i find 2nd last dude on a gen with 2 or 3 to go, theyre escaping, only heroes work on gens when theres 2 left.
---

---
I don't have a clip saved but I'll direct you [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhMMYbcnzJU) and skip to 6:43
---
Kate makes do
---
Pound me daddy!
---
I really feel like the camping needs to be dialed down but then again there's no BBQ to actually encourage killers to go for other survivors. Ironic how people complain about that perk but killers play so much more scummy without it.
---
That said, I actually don't mind the part about having to play the survivor to unlock their stuff. Especially since once you hit level 40 on that survivor you're good to go if you don't want to keep playing them. Also love the shared inventory between all survivors so I don't end up with a situation where my Meg has trash perks but all my toolboxes.
---
Fun perk bad on its own, makes breakoffs and fake breakoffs  more viable. Better when you combine it with others. For example.
---
Rancor: makes the survivors not want to unhook the obsession
---
Dark devotion: Makes dark devotion more usefull for longer
---
Nemesis: More oblivious
---
Remember me: Easier remember me
---
Play with your food: wastes two of your perk slots
---
Me: “We all started together with a gen in front of us. That is suspiciously perfect for a stealth killer.”
---
*5 seconds later...
---
*Michael Myers music intensifies*
---
I hope they keep this version
---
They SUCK. When I get that map as killer I just farm with them because it gives me eye strain trying to see anything properly.
---
Your laugh is like what the cabbage patch kids have.
---
When I play survivor and the killer is just fucking around I sacrifice myself so they can get a few bloodpointa
---
And those &lt;3 viewers are their friends, they have terrible audio quality, and their stream is sub 720p and 30fps.
---
It's a bug, not an intended mechanic. It'll get fixed soon ^tm i'm sure. No idea why people are being downvoted in this thread for saying so; probably by people who are abusing it.
---
Devs won't ban anyone for bug abuse though so there isn't any reason to report it.
---
Kate since she is my main when I play survivor, or baby megs (unless they teabag after every pallet)
---
It doesn't matter how long you run.
---
If your exhaustion meter is full you gain no benefits. If it isn't full, you run a tad faster.
---
You can partially recover mid chase, but it's not super time efficient.
---
if they run for cover under a survivor and ur carrying on u can drop that survivor down the one taking cover and hook him and just slug the other one resulting in 2 survivors doing nothing
---
mystery box is there
---
Mmmm shirtless David
---
Imagine running to the edge of the map  to self care in 2019
---
I could see this being a thing
---
Neither m8, I don't h8. Game's gr8 and I like the community. I r8 8/8 no b8.
---
What is it
---
Meg is probably the most lean, so she should prove an excellent and healthy meal.  
---
On the other hand, I reckon Jane is the most tender of the bunch.
---
Juggling to a new level
---
the worst part is u would abuse him and flashlight click like that if he did look like a baby killer smh
---
I've had this happen to me... This is basically a DC... Without the symbol. I know this as the hatch will open even if you didn't sacrafice him. I was also Doctor and the person never screamed even in tier 3 and never left saw that person.
---
Balancing this game is impossible. First, it's asymmetrical. Second there are dozens upon dozens of different perks and perk combinations. It's a horrible combination for a PVP game. 
---
PVP games should be an equal playing field but the nature of this game doesn't allow that. Asymmetrical games will never be popular because you can't make it fair. Especially when you pair this with an extremely inept development team. 
---
And also from what I can tell they have very little interaction with their community/playerbase. They're just raking in the money from the sheep who keep buying the new dlc.
---
🤔is this sarcasm?
---
Did not know this, thanks for the info friend. So basically mori em x amount of times to unlock
---
Yeah it’s hard hurting your main survivor, especially if they’re in the same outfit combo!
---
Nope.
---
I bet you message people after games because no one follows your rules. Right?
---
The best idea I read for a buff to Distortion was making the effect temporarily cover any survivors nearby you in a short range because for example using it to counter BBQ and Chili is hard if you're working on a generator with another survivor, your aura will be hidden but the person right next to you might still lead the killer in that direction. Same with Nurse's Calling and healing, your aura might get hidden but it's going to reveal the aura of the person you're healing so the effect is kind of wasted. I know people like to run Distortion more as an information gathering perk (knowing for sure which aura-reading perks the killer has) rather than a way to actually counter those perks, but I think \*at least\* making it cover healing would make sense.
---
Oh, well, you see... It's... You know?... You can.. erm.. ask OP?
---
Ahhh yes a pomegranate dog
---
Nobody wants to see a flashlight clicking ass hole bullying a baby killer.
---
well SCPs are secured contained and protected the entity is sure not secured or contained but heavily protected by like 18 different rampaging killers that u can't kill bc whenever they die they just end back up at the campfire which the entity could likely place the killer back in battle plus we don't even know what ties the entity if I recall there isn't an SCP that isn't tied to something either this world or an item so there is that
---
which is ironic cause legion can break gens in frenzy but i guess it makes sense if they coded where pallets just get vaulted instead of broke lol
---
It was released by signature entertainment in the UK. I introduced it at FrightFest in london... people... watching me.... shat myself harder than I do when myers pulls.me off a gen.
---
It's a lot of fun. Support it with a view and if your in other territories with a purchase or rent on digital 👍
---
It’s talking about already hooked survivors, otherwise yeah duh, but once they just slide under they aren’t coming out until I leave then they unhook that person
---
Nurse has two things that go against her frequency, her skill ceiling turning away the new players from playing her and her general unappealing play style. Most players agree that while nurse is effective she's just boring to play as because if you've bothered to learn then you'll just destroy as you counter the two things survivors have against you, pallets and windows. The nurse's you went up against probably weren't all that skilled with her but were trying to learn her or were having an off day, or even more rare the survivors on your team were actually skilled aswell. They literally changed almost nothing about her base ability so no, she wasn't gutted. Also trapper bug does need addressing but saying they take forever to fix the game when they took a week to fix nearly every big introduced in oni update. And have brought plenty of fixes every update, yea it can be frustrating but things take time.
---
Im a rank 6, not my fault for the shitty match making
---
Why don't YOU tell ME?
---
The devs don't give a fuck.
---
What does rank have to do with flashlight clicking?
---
I respect no pallet.  
---
Enduring gang.
---
🙂
---
And using an exploit like disconnect to shift things in your favour and using as not intended when playing a game is usually considered... what?
---
well no u cant go and hide under currently hooked survivors anymore that was patched
---
Just play how you like, as the killer there’s only 1 person in your team and that’s you. So long as you don’t break any rules (dbd rules not make up survivor rules) your fine. 
---
I play however the game pans out for me.
---
For example I don’t usually tunnel, but If gens r popping like crazy then sorry but ima tunnel your weakest survivor to slow you down.
---
How recently cuz that happened to me over this weekend
---
" out of their way to be overly mean to killers. "
---
Such as? Other than post game verbal abuse (which can be hidden) I don't see how Survivor's can ruin a killer's experience. A killer can camp and tunnel into mori, or keep everyone slugged for 4 minutes, which is an absolutely miserable experience. They can delay the game indefinitely if they block you somewhere and go AFK. That ruins an experience. Survivors can't do anything that completely removes the Killer's ability to play. If you think teabagging/pointing is toxic... try to change your mindset. It's usually meant to be cheeky, or to acknowledge a play. It's not always toxic. And seeing that shouldn't ruin your game: You're chasing and stabbing them after all, is a point really that bad?
---
Or maybe not gearing the harder rift challenges towards swf and completely fucking people who play solo how the hell am I supposed to complete 4 gens by myself?
---
Oh heck! I saw this in a game with a friend the other day as well. Confused us all.
---
r/doputyourdickinthat
---
survivors can hide under survivors getting hooked that is still a thing but I know for a fact BHVR patched the glitched collision box on hooked survivors
---
Well not all scps can be contained. I remember one that lived on a completely different plane of existence and only comes to our plane to take documents about itself or take people who talk about it but the goes back to it's own plane
---
I tried.
---
He tried?
---
ITS NOT SHIFTING FAVOR UNLESS A SURVIVOR DISCONNECTS CUZ THEN IT GIVES THE KILLER POWER, IF THE KILLER LEAVES NO ONE GETS ANYTHING, ITS NOT CHEATING JUST ANNOYING
---
Wow! Excellent play at the end! We are all impressed!
---
Would be better without the nobody.
---
When flashlights are usable items for a reason.
---
It seems like you have already set your mind on it being good considered the way you comment on others explanations. It is not really possible to have a discussion with you if you simply deny facts or make up your own.
---
If you like it use it. You don’t need permission for the rest of the community to use it.
---
Don't get me wrong it's well executed and all, but there must be some other graphic that better describes Legion than his cluster headache after running. Maybe the mask(s)?
---
Well idk cuz I still saw it happening so idk
---
You can't just decide that you want to boop the snoot, the snoot decides if it wants to be booped.
---
The fact that you have pay the price of 2 killers to play as Base Joey still annoys me.
---
The best solution is to get good enough to brutally punish toxic players. I'm not at that point yet, but I'll get there someday. I WILL have my faces, one way or another...
---
May I have your chicken nugget?
---
They're used to blind the killer. Not be a toxic asshole. :)
---
Then you get called trash killer by every survivor
---
Clowns bottles are much stronger as he can clog huge spaces with that blur..
---
But Freddy also has something cool, called gen pressure.
---
What I like about Hag is that almost every perk in the game is good on Hag.
---
My goto build though is Pop Goes the Weasel, Save the Best For Last, Franklin's Demise, and BBQ for bp (though you can use another perk like Ruin if you don't feel comfortable playing Hag without Ruin or any other perk you fancy. BBQ is literally just for bp)
---
Thanks luv!
---
Anyday 🙂
---
I mean ppl can create SCPs all they want but it seems the majority is contained
---
That's why I play him most of the time with a couple surv matches a day. The only way to escape michael is to *be* michael.
---
Yeah it happens mate. Yet this sad toxic Kid downvotes me. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Yep that's him. That's the cutie patootie :3
---
Yesterday had a survivor try to get my attention the whole game while i downed his other teammates. I ignored him but then downed him and he immediately dced.
---
Same tbh. I won't be sleeping tonight. I will be too busy building a shrine to this guy.
---
It's obviously someone getting very enthusiastic about someone else applying peanut butter or a soft cheese to some crackers.

I'm sure we've all been there once or twice.

I don't like crackers so I haven't been there. Tell me more.

You had us in the first half , not gonna lie.

---
Do you play on console(ps4?)? I have yet to meet a toxic survivor in red ranks tho.. I’ve learned from green and purple ranks to not give a single shit when getting teabagged by survivors. I’m a rank 1 killer now and i play Wraith, GF, Legion and sometimes Billy with no ruin. Yes i’m very chill as killer dw :D just an advice if you see a good player that tbags try your best and ignore them, half the time they’d chase after you and do nothing. So take that chance and chase after the weaker ones in the team, slug the last one THEN go after the tbagger. It has worked pretty well with me and now i can say i’m a pretty skilled killer who knows not to give them the satisfaction of winning and looping me. I know it’s frustrating going against them, especially the ones who have flashlights and just go *Click click click click* on you. :c I really hope more people play killer cuz its so hard to find a match in survivor lobbies. :/ While in killer it takes 3 seconds. Killer is also fun guys :’)) i think i’m the only console player who still plays killer in red ranks xD oh whale.

Hahaha it’s quite a satisfying scream isn’t it?Omg Jane and head on. I shit myself every time I see her juicy ass come screaming out of a locker.
---
I don't give a shit about flashlight clickers, teabaggers or anything else I play with low effort mostly the times I try hard it goes well other times it goes okay but I play for fun
---
Good
---
I went back to save a dwight yesterday on yamaoka and was downed (death hook) two inches in front of him on the hook. He got the kobe though and escaped because i'd opened the gate before going back for him. I'm so happy he lived!
---
The Haste change would make Hope a broken dick ass cum perk.
---
Pig used Double Team!
---
Will agree that maps are the biggest problem with the game currently.
---
Damn bro that sucks. Same here tho, i have set my msgs to “Friends only” and i have so many survivors send friend requests just to shit on me. Like how pathetic is that?! 😪
---
Why does Dead Hard flash every time you get a great skill check though?
---
Wow killers get Nothing amazing
---
So I see that this sub never changes. It's been like almost a year since I've played and I'm having the easiest time of my life as a killer. Massive amounts of jerks disconnecting/suiciding, even more survivors that can't loop at all, and EVEN MORE survivors that don't focus on gens. Honestly, I don't know what happened of the year, but daaamn the quality of survivors have dropped significantly.
---
\[Freddy gang have upvoted this\]
---
• Haste will always increase Survivors' movement speed by 150%.
---
Are u crazy? u know Hope is a perk? why the fuck should survivors run at 250% for 110 seconds or some shit
---
Ok why the fuck is this community obsessed with lesion he has the worst mechanics and I can't imagine it being fun have your matches canceled because let's face it everyone dc's against legion
---
ofc it would be a fucking mess but that is the fun part
---
*tombstone intensifies*
---
2 killers sounds like something that would be fun for 5 minutes then I’d never play it again.
---
I feel that for the most part the game is pretty balanced. But I think there are certain maps that are very survivor sided if they get lucky RNG
---
Thx
---
Whisperers is the best tracking perk in the game and is heavily underrated
---
Ya Killers already have almost no Status Effects, and I thought about making flashlight blindness or pallet stuns into a Status Effect but there's just nothing that's already in the game that could make good Status Effects for Killers unfortunately.
---
Trapper
---
what about oblivious killers can have that
---
I feel like whispers makes me look around in one spot for too long— but maybe that’s because I’m easily distracted and new! My more experienced killer friends sing its praise though!
---
No. The Nurse that I faced was not new to the nurse because I asked him if it was his first time playing the nurse and they said he had several hundred hours playing as her. Also, the first nurse said they played several games as the nurse after the changes and the second nurse had already played weeks after the changes. The trapper bug has been there for quite some time seeing as how I noticed the bug when I was forced to play as him for his level 1 tome challenges. If you are talking about the infinite bug then yeah it could be a week, but still that bug wouldn't had happened if they had fixed the first bug.
---
I have to say oni. Simply his presence is terrifying especially in demon mode it looks pretty awesome.
---
Please explain how it's a nerf. Nowhere on his sheet, power, or perks does it say "Oni can turn 180 degrees in an instant". It's a design flaw not taking into account mouse input because the devs are bad at what they do. A nerf implies something that existed was made intentionally.
---
It's not a nerf, it's just bad design all around.
---
The downvotes just prove to me that you people have not even the slightest clue about game design and why developers should never listen to cry babies.
---
Also, still waiting for your genius retort on this issue aside from some brain dead MUH NERFS.
---
It's neither. You can't look at it from a logical perspective without making up scenarios such as player experience, players load out, which map and more. If you have 4 survivors that play optimally in SWF they will win 99% of the time as it was previously demonstrated by Tydetime.
---
If the killer is very experienced he will kill at least 2-3 players each game. If you play top 3 killers it will be more likely than when you're playing bottom 3. See, you need various scenarios, each game is different with different scenario, it's rare to find very good killers each game and vice versa.
---
I miss 97% of my swings against skirt Jane. Js
---
I didn't include changes to specific Perks on this list, but Hope would just increase a Survivor's movement speed by 5%'/6%''/7%''', not grant the Survivor Haste.
---
This is blatantly obvious
---
well if u walk forward and it turns on u got a 180 degree cone of where the survivor could currently be cos it didnt turn on before when u learn how to use it then u can easily abuse it and always be around survivors and stop looking in places u thought survivors are but they weren't
---
Oh. Alright.
---
I love it! I'd freakin' love one of feral frenzy, I think their power has the best looking icon.
---
Certain random map spawns, addons and many bullcrap things can make it feel differently depending on your side.
---
I’d say that it’s still survivor sided, but it might be because playing the killer makes you think about and take everything seriously, when on survivor you just lie back and relax.
---
Oblivious is a Survivor Status Effect...
---
When you go into the gas station in autohaven it makes a ding sound.
---
Damn- my baby self had no idea it was a cone!
---
Here comes the virgin
---
You'd think.
---
Once upon a time I accidentally had random team voice chat on in Fortnite. The things I learned about gays, my mother and what had been done to her, and how many games I should uninstall before I killed myself...
---
I came to the game after almost a year, and I swear the amount of dicks that just suicide/disconnect have doubled. The quality of survivors have degraded immensely. I don't know what happened in the time I was away, but I'm really surprised how bad it's become.
---
Again, they could've just had bad games then. It's not like you're 100% guaranteed a win just cause you picked nurse before and after the update. Also with that trapper bug its weird as it must've happened sometime after the 4th tome was added because I had played trapper for the challenges and had been stepping over the traps just fine.
---
Yeah, some survivors don’t play the best, but there are plenty around that can bully weaker killers
---
You can stop buying DLC for starters. Or rally the playerbase and stop playing the game all together. Haha, who am I kidding.
---
Spirit
---
Dude, it would be an absolute clusterfuck full of toxicity and many DC's and ragequits. 
---
But I'm totally willing to Experience that Hell cause it sounds really fun
---
Why can't I find more killers like you
---
"With bad luck"-me
---
It would just be your Survivor teammates and like I said above, the hardest part from my point of view would be the reporting part of having a voice chat.
---
No! This is Patrick!
---
Oh yeah ONI is definitely up there, and that roar!
---
If they didn't advertise that how would you know?
---
[Insert Nea is a killer/the entity joke]
---
Alive By Nightfall
---
Luck is not a skill. Situational awareness and decision making is.
---
"An assumption" everybody knows everybody uses voice comms when they play SWF. If not voice chat, at the very least text chat. So yeah, they'd be getting punished via that method for *voice comms*, not for playing with friends. End of story.
---
idk why you keep making excuses for them. It wasn't just a bad game, the nurses got absolutely destroyed. The first nurse didn't get a single hooked survivor. The second nurse got only one kill and that was because he got looped 3/4 of the game and decided to camp the first hooked survivor. The trapper bug happened to me when I was doing the lv1 challenges when the archives was first released. It happened when you set a trap and any slight movement would cause you to fall onto your trap. It got worse with the infinite bug because you would set the trap and then it magnet you towards the trap causing an infinite trapped animation loop.
---
She didn’t do anything? So what if you got hit when you weren’t the one to fail the skill check, it happens
---
Doctor  is my main killer and i love tf outta him  lol  can't  wait  for them to get rid of switching  between  punishment  and treatment
---
well it is a circle but if it didnt turn on before in like one area u can assume that the survivors are just in a cone in front of u bc it didnt turn on behind u before it is weird
---
Not everybody has a mic or can afford one. And since voice comms cannot be detected in game, you cant punish people for using them. You would be punishing for the mere fact that they grouped with a friend, as that is literally the only thing the game could detect in order to turn off perk slots. End of story.
---
David and Jeff, don’t ask why
---
is it? Myers T1 has it, Pig crouch has it, Wraith has it, Demo exit portal has it, Ghostface in power has it and so on
---
Pig in that situation is so so, but GF can wait on the other end of the roof vault behind the gen, vault over, and achieve an easy grab. Survivors that work on that gen always look at only the stairs.
---
I thought i was the only Dwight main who’d stare at his face while doing a gen,healing etc... thank god i’m not the only weirdo out there...
---
You know what, i just want to know. Why is nurse terrible now compared to her old version? How was she gutted. No two nurse games flat out statistics, what was changed.
---
Edit: Also I'm assuming you mean why am I defending the devs. Because I'm not some person who just looks at what they haven't done like a majority of this community seems to be. Devs give us content, they Should've worked on bugs. Devs Work on bugs, they Should've gave content. Devs fix bugs but introduce new bugs, they never fix bugs... It's a merry go round of toxicity and the community revels in it
---
Ok, like, if you eat crackers, usually they're just lightly salted.
---
And if you're just eating crackers by themselves you'll probably want more flavor on them, so you'll get a knife and spread some peanut butter or cheese on them.
---
If you're really into it, as the person in the above picture clearly is, you're liable to let out an exclamation in anticipation of your culinary treat. 
---
Most people just go "mmhmmm" or "yum", but clearly the person above likes crackers and peanut butter a lot.
---
Pig is more than viable imo
---
Yeah, his insane turning combined with the fact that he could down you with the demon dash (and also not bonk like Billy) was incredibly op, but of course everyone wants to be able to turn their brain off and still win.
---
You're thinking of Undetectable which I included.
---
For example if a teamate wastet all palets in you're arear and then the killer comes to you and you are injured then you're screwed
---
on boi cant wait for russians to scream at me
---
oop mb
---
Ok so he’s getting matched against top survivors,  showing how the equal skill means that Freddy is still top tier like the previous dude said
---
Obviously that depends
---
...and?
---
Same.
---
but when I play survivor.
---
Does it work with other things or only crackers?
---
No thanks
---
Why?
---
I actually like self care...it's my go to perk.
---
Except the reason they'd be implementing this would be because of voice comms, not people playing with their friends....
---
I personally find survivor easier bc there’s 3 other people to support you if you need it, whereas killer you’re on your own lol. But I can see why people struggle with it
---
&lt;3
---
I like it, too! (Even if it takes forever it’s better than walking around groaning)
---
I just wish the community was kinder to inexperienced players on both sides but I guess that’s wishful thinking lol
---
Plus the scratch marks don’t show up around  the middle building of the new map where all the vegetation covers them up. If survivors break line of sight for a few seconds they’re GONE
---
No u!
---
I mean ranks don't matter for about 37 different reasons, but I really don't think we should balance around low ranks. Low rank Survivors will learn to play, cause if people at low rank never got good they'd never rank up.
---
Yeah it's a blast going against red rank survivors at rank 14 who know how to loop you perfectly but still whine when you actually kill them. I know I'm not good at killer but Goddamn is it frustrating being placed against red ranks every other game. I cannot mind game for shit so even the simple loops take a while usually if the survivors are decent :/ some day... Some day I will stop being a potato, today is not that day.
---
Yeah that's the only downfall. I like it bc you can't always rely on your teammates and I'd rather hide and heal for the little time than run around the map looking for someone to heal me and chance getting them killed too
---
It’s weird cause whenever I play with in a swf with one or two friends of same ranks, we tend to get randos similar to us. But when I was solo queueing last night as a purple rank, I was getting gray and yellow rank teammates and killers. Or a match with 3 purple teammates (including me), a legit rank 20 teammate and rank 13 killer
---
I think if it happens they have to completely change the rules for that game. Replace generators with something more interactive.
---
I mostly play solo and I don't want an experience like Friday 13th
---
Should I learn how to sew so we can make him a custom badge?
---
Then don't go into that area. Shit how hard is it to understand? Decision making and awareness go hand in hand and work well in this game. If you go injured into an area without using your brain first then it's your fault, not luck... Own up and stop blaming luck for your lack of skill. End of story.
---
I usually let wiggling people go, and not wiggling always kill
---
Survivors can completely bully the killer when they're playing at their bests, but killers can just break the game and give no chance to them. It's just impossible to scape from NOED and Ebony Moris, and Nurse / Spirit (maybe Freddy too) speaks from themselves. 
---
So yeah, killers can just fuck with everyone if they want to.
---
Yes.
---
Plus, every swf game is OP, imagine that every game.
---
I definitely agree. When I first began killer I could feel my blood rushing extremely fast. It was definitely stressful. But- I soon began to prefer killer. I remember I stopped playing survivor as much because usually my teammates are braindead or the challenges are too difficult. I get a lot of hate when I play killer. it's best to just power through it and transform that energy into skill to annihilate the next team. also- bbq.
---
Fuck it. Freddy, fire it up
---
So many things in this game make no sense.
---
No because I play on PC, are you that salty you're stalking me now? Nice
---
Oni and its no contest.
---
If only he wasn't nerfed.
---
The flick was too good and made it almost Spirit Tier uncounterable (can be countered but good luck being able to do it 5 times in a row). So they nerfed him, maybe too much because you're supposed to be able to flick in 90 degree turns but as it stands it's closer to 30 degrees. He's still fun to play but it sucks getting all those missed attacks.
---
And the only way it would work is if the game could recognize when someone is in a discord chat, or xbox live party, or playstation party. Since the game cannot recognize that, it would only work by recognizing playing with friends. So it would be punishing playing with friends first, in the hope that it is punishing voice comms.
---
Forget 180, you can barely go 20.
---
What was the nerf?
---
"Wah wah wah... it's not cheating because it doesn't affect me if I'm killer... it nust makes me a toxic cunt"
---
Thanks for the clarification. You're right... cheating is better, at least people still get to continue the round despite being more difficult for the survivors left behind. 👍
---
what about 1 survivor and 4 killers and the killers have to escape? finally they will know fear when they are chased by meg
---
There was also a perk (resilience maybe?) That made it so you vault faster and BHVR said it was a bug even though the description literally said that's what it did
---
The killer aura is shown to everyone at a bigger radius
---
Also, kindred is the only perk for which Open Handed doesn’t stack more than once
---
He can't turn at the last second of his demon strike.
---
I get it was a strong ability but now with the nerf skilled survivors can easily avoid it
---
I feel like keys are just like mori’s 🤷🏻
---
SCPs aren't "Secure*d*, Containe*d*, Protecte*d*", they are things that are anomalous and need to be kept track of.
---
There's really nothing stopping the extremely dangerous SCPs from just waltzing out of the door if they wanted to. Heck, Shy Guy busted out of his containment unit because some lumberjack looked at a photo in just the right light to see four pixels that were Shy Guy's face.
---
Legion lol
---
You gotta pick the one killer not available for me don't you? (He isn't on the switch version, I did play on ps4 before this but I don't now)
---
*unhook me comrade*
---
I really enjoy killer but I get so discouraged bc I get so many insulting messages. It’s not like they hurt me or offend me, but I’m just like “ah why should I bother, I’m better at survivor anyway”. I’ve considered turning my messages off but I like to get messages from people I’ve played with (mostly as survivor) thanking me for the way I’ve played or something. I’m a pretty low rank killer atm and I keep getting paired with people 6-10 ranks above me and I just have no chance lol. Makes me not want to keep playing killer in case I rank up and get even higher rank survivors lmao
---
And a teachable?
---
Doctor-Monitor and Abuse
---
Shoot ok, trapper, brutal strength
---
Not my fault for shitty match making, i also made all the killer mainz mad 🤣🤣🤣
---
Imagine teabagging against one of the weakest killers in the game LOL
---
I agree he shouldn't be able to turn 180 degrees. That was a bit ridiculous. The problem is now you can barely turn at all. Ironic how you're criticising us for wanting to play a killer brainless when now you don't even need a brain to counter him. Just turn 1cm to the side and you're good.
---
Oh yikes. Pc is much worse. I bet you die first a lot.
---
Hag, devour hope
---
*Results will vary.
---
Trapper, brutal strength 
---
Got it
---
Joey gang rise up
---
Sewing? Really? He has no time for that peasant shit. I am starting question your faith.
---
Mommy, can I pet him?
---
What shall I do then??
---
Demi daddy
---
Survivors can't vault it either if you ever want to sandbag
---
While it's not that good compared to some since you sometimes don't even get a chance to use it. The ability to instadown can snowball you pretty quickly if the survivors have no idea where your totem is /you get lucky with the placement. Many games have been saved by devour hope and it's satisfying as hell watching all 4 of them get morid as they run around the map trying to find the totem. I'd highly recommend it just because it's fun and satisfying when it does work. Yeah a lot of the time it'll get cleansed before you get much value (usually people won't bother looking for it until you down someone instantly) but I'd still recommend it just for shits and giggles.
---
She will be my next challenge if the trapper proves easy
---
Myers. You're working on a gen and then turn your camera to see that pale emotionless face staring at you.
---
Just praise him, every night. Offer him a sacrifice.
---
Well that's conclusive.
---
Already got Trapper then Hag lined up, I'll see the Doc if they are too quick in my opinion
---
Ironic considering nearly every killer in the game is broken atm
---
u shouldnt mention streamers, as theyre lucky overpaid folks who just get even more money when u promote them
---
HAHAHA wow spam more emojis smh
---
Nah, There are games that are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more toxic this DBD for example, RUST
---
Also there is toxicity in every game. Get off your high horse.
---
yea but in CYKA BLYET PYNAM IDIOT U MOTHERFUCK but more russian
---
Matchmaking be like that. I recomend grinding bp from survivor and shrine and just going nuts on leveling up killer to get good perks. If I may ask, which killers do you have and which killer would you say you main?
---
DBD is far from F13 and with the proper report system in place the toxicity would be contained.
---
shes so adorable

Try running really fast and then turning on a dime. Report back with your findings.
---
I always thought maps should be more random.
---
The survs with thousands of hours in the game can keep a chase going for ages simply because they know every loop, every jungle gym, every single thing about the maps.
---
But I like zapping people:(
---
id spam otz then he deservers to be over paid
---
did he actually say that? oh dear
---
I do that with everyone I play as lol (I do it more with Dwight :3)
---
This honestly makes sense, and everyone who's complaining about the risk of being bullied can just turn off their voice chat it's not that hard...
---
Wraith, Shadowborn!
---
Wraith blood hound
---
That’s more toxic than fc
---
lol her foot sounds like its as hard as metal too. i feel like ghostface takes longer than average to break pallets
---
Since i mainly play as survivor, killer queue time is to long for my taste, i have enough ultra rare addons to mori away the toxicity from the game.
---
Jake- Sneaky bois are my fav on both sides and they are hard to find/easy to lose
---
Huh. I heard there was some legion nerf thing. Must be a deep wound change.
---
Facts
---
The match you're about to play, it will show in the offerings screen too
---
8
---
I think Shadowborn would make for a much more difficult match lol.
---
And then you have finished them and need to wait another 3 weeks
---
With Oni, survivor or real life?
---
No, I mean't, why are you defending the two nurses that got destroyed? So, how was the nurse gutted? Well lets see, she has shit common and uncommon addons. Her good addons are the rare ones, but they are nullified by her new base kit because she struggles in chases now more than ever. In the previous nurse build, she would struggle to hit people with her blinks, but that was compensated with the infinite number of tries to blink. Now that we have new indoor maps and maps that help survivors lose line of sight of killers, the nurse now has to carefully plan out her limited blinks. If she misses her blinks, she is forced to chase, but then that becomes simple M1 killer loops which is another problem entirely. I'm not saying these changes make her a low tier killer, but I am saying that she is no longer viable at high ranks because over here at the high ranks it is very competitive. You need a killer who has good map pressure, can down people quickly to keep momentum, need a killer that survivors can fear and the nurse just isn't it anymore. I wish I had more games against the nurse, but the two games I got tell me good enough what I am looking at. On top of that, not only did she get limited blinks, but she is still a killer that requires skill and muscle memory and seeing as how most red rank killers are afraid of using killers that are hard to use this makes it another negative. I mean, think about it. Why would any tryhard red rank killer (this includes me sometimes) would want to use a killer that is hard to use and not much fun to play as? Why not go for someone like Spirit or Huntress? Both those killers require some skill, but are viable at high ranks and specifically the huntress can be fun to play as at any rank.
---
Play how you want to play. Not how others tell you lmfao.
---
It means the one coming right up.  So the trial in which the offering is burned.
---
I only play as Dwight lol :’) love my bby dweet 💞
---
Ok, Bing Bonger
---
I have all the OGs (incl. Huntress) and I’ve bought Freddy, spirit and oni. I used to main wraith and Freddy, but now I mostly play spirit bc I find she’s the hardest to bully (and yet they still do lmao). I was thinking of trying out ghostface but idk if he’s any good lol
---
I mean, I'm just saying... Why would you ever look away from the entrances?
---
You use it in whatever match you use the offering. Not the match after using it. It activates just like all the other offerings and at the same time. Hope this helps.
---
I suppose.
---
I was expecting any second for a ghostface to sneak up on you and expose you.
---
Alrighty, thank you guys!
---
'Mom we want dead by daylight'  
---
'We have dead by daylight at home'  
---
Dead by Daylight at home:
---
I play on PS4, and killer queue times are like 30 seconds whereas survivor is a lot longer. Seems like the opposite is true for PC
---
I flash light clicked because the killer was a tunnler
---
Uh....
---
(Just saying.. I completed that basement challenge first try. It's not impossible. Keep trying. :))
---
Exactly! The Devs could very easily make it so that when you hover over a Survivor's username, you can just click a button to mute them.
---
Unhook us comrade*
---
U might want to erase the "and survivor" part from your name as we can see you're a major killer with how you hate seeing survivors put effort in the game and view every survivor as noob3 level of skill.
---
nah shadowborn would actually help more
---
Killers aren’t OP at lower ranks people are just bad lol
---
Wait where did they say that?
---
I think chat buttons would be a better option. A) Killer is close. B) Heal me. C) Finish this gen. I can imagine all the bullshit over voice coms like why'd you run him over here, why'd you take my chest/unhook, or other useless information.
---
Thank you for adding the English! I have all of these in the original and love it &lt;3
---
I’m guessing he learned that from hexy lol
---
Just saying, not only would colorblindness settings be great, but so would visual indicators for those with hearing problems. Like DBD MOBILE ALREADY HAS.
---
Yeah he said it. Pretty awkward considering he already calls himself a pro
---
Nope, hooks work.
---
I feel insulted but I also feel like you missed the point of my post.
---
Probably because people would abuse it into oblivion like fortnite :(
---
I actually main Ghostface. I adore his playstyle. idk- theres just something about being able to suppress your terror radius instantly and remain 110% speed
---
 Very useful for mind games. If you're going to stick with Spirit I recommend (I honestly don't know if I'm spelling that right or not) nurses, bbq, pop, and ruin. although I myself do not use ruin. Oni is not for me- Nemesis can be pretty fun, tho.
---
Cue in the loud piano music
---
I only blame Hexy for this
---
So what I am to gather from your statement is: "I have no understanding of statistics or how blatantly flawed they are as admitted by the developers themselves, or how said statistics can be blatantly manipulated to show off any information the devs desire."
---
News flash, it is super easy to manipulate data, and anyone who works with stats knows this. Even without manipulation the fact that the devs don't account for matches with trolls, throwers, and derankers averages out the stats to be more inaccurate. Just because the data is ADMITTED to be flawed by multiple sources doesn't mean that people who doubt it are wrong because "we need more variables dammit."
---
What, are you just gonna draw conclusions from the stats that the devs flat out said not to draw conclusions from? The bootlickers in this community are a joke.
---
I read that as "shit and space"
---
Tbh I would like the dark blue aesthetic and would switch fron red to blue
---
That’s literally what I was saying, killers who dc are dicks, I’m a killer and I agree with this even if I don’t do this, but if a survivor disconnects, it can potentially throw the whole game and give the killer power. If the killer disconnects, they and the survivors lose their offerings and any blood points they gain (which would be none). I’m on ur side, but it’s not cheating bcuz it’s not against the rules, it’s like ragequitting pretty much, not cheating just annoying. Even my dad who plays survivor agrees, it’s not cheating since there’s no rule against it, however it’s unfair to the survivors especially, but the killer still gains nothing from the situation. I think you’ve misread this whole thing, and I’d like to reiterate myself to tell you what I mean in the purest form I can.
---
He's  a good boy, just dont make eye contact!
---
~~Oh wait...~~
---
Yeah he seems really fun, but I’m always too nervous to try out new killers in case I’m totally trash lol. Might give him a go tho. Never actually tried oni, I got the DLC for Yui. I’ll have to try that build on spirit, I run something similar but without pop and nurses :)
---
Nurse is crying as she reads this post
---
We heard you loud and clear. To make the cosmetics feel fairer, we're rising the killers' prices 300%.
---
Honestly all Claudette's are cuties
---
That applies too in this case
---
Really difficult challenge that can heavily rely on whether or not a survivor decides to DC to prevent you from completing it. It's the only one not finished
---
That whole match was funny.
---
It makes me wish I could catch his streams more often.
---
What event? What skins? Could someone provide a link please? Google just gives me last year's event.
---
I'm sure that useless info probably be shared but just chat buttons wouldn't work because then the Devs would need to add voice lines, something they've already said they aren't doing.
---
I have a Nurse main friend who's pretty much quit this game after the Nurse nerfs. He has played in several tournaments and while I can't speak for his accolades I'd be more than willing to have him come and vouch for himself.
---
He made several threads about Nurse's state after her nerfs to point out how much worse she is, and almost all of them were met with "git gud stop using OP nurse lol."
---
I used to be in green ranks with killer which is decent but I just gravitate more to playing survivor regardless 😂But you got this. I have faith that you’ll be a better killer than me
---
Remember kids: The Enity feeds on hope, if you give up, the Entity starves!
---
I used to be like that. I'm still not comfortable with a few (Oni, Billy, Bubba) but when you start to play killer more you start to learn that it's best to get an early hit in order to reduce chase time. Ghostface is probably the best at that imo. Maybe Legion but.. y'know. Spirit is free grabs if their deaf or you use beads. if you do try out Ghosty- I recomend bbq, spirit fury, enduring, and free slot. I usually use stbfl. sometimes ruin but I do not like that perk.
---
Think you went up against a scratch mirror Myers (could be wrong)
---
No heartbeat but doesn't power up his Evil Within.
---
He doesn't gain Terror radius and red stain until evil within reaches tier 2, he was probably running a stealth Myers build
---
This baby hag isn’t the only thing that “grows so fast”
---
tic toc tic toc tic toc
---
NOED is not only not OP, it's not even good.
---
Yeah it's been REALLY bad recently. I'm Rank 9, and literally 95% of my games have at least one red-rank. I even ended up with a full red team at one point, something is clearly wrong with the matchmaking.
---
\*Insert Demo Mori animation\*
---
I feel your pain. I had a 4 man SWF on Mt. Ormand as a baby Doctor with Franklin’s1, Overcharge 2, Ruin 1, and Brutal Strength 1. 
---
I got teabagged at the gates. Like, they’re trying to rub salt into a wound that didn’t exist. I left the lobby on accident, but I was expecting toxicity despite being a mid-tier killer on one of the safest maps.
---
I hate ruin as well, but I feel like I need it in order to even have a chance lol. Whenever I don’t run it, all 5 gens are popped and I’ve barely hooked anyone. So frustrating. I think I’m gonna try him out, I’ve always enjoyed people’s gameplay of him, and he seems like quite a powerful killer when used correctly. I’ll try that build on him too
---
I guess it's because on pc we can properly aim with the killer while on console is a lot harder.
---
SKREEEEEE!
---
If you were on the hospital map thats scratched mirror Myers, its an addon that makes him permanently tier 1 but he can see through walls. Plus since he is in tier 1 he doesnt have a heartbeat or red stain.
---
Down side he moves slow as fuck and can be looped for a long as time and he doesnt get bloodlust
---
She’s an odd girl
---
A lot of the time as killer, you swing for a survivor and it definitely should hit but somehow it misses lol. Alternatively, PS4 hitboxes aren’t the best, so you do get quite a few unfair hits as well
---
Woah woah woah. This is a place for shit talking, not sense talking!
---
... 
---
So she's gutted because.
---
1. Her add ons are now appropriate with the rare ones being good and the commons being eh
---
2. You need to mindgame the survivor and plan out a blink. (She's always needed to do this on the fact she's always been the slowest killer in game)
---
3. Indoor maps exist. I mean one indoor map has been added in that time frame. But going by that logic wouldn't billy be shit to? He definitely struggles with indoor maps.
---
Here's the thing. You only emphasized what i said. She's a killer who requires skill to be effective but when you get that skill you basically destroy. She's always needed to mindgame and no, if the nurse knows what they're doing they can always secure a hit quickly. Nurse has massive map pressure similar to Billy on account she can go a great deal of distance in seconds. 
---
I have no idea why you think two nurses dictate her effectiveness but no. She's literally the same she was before
---
If everyone had the voice capabilities of SWF, you'd probably see a dramatic decrease in the number of killers playing the game leading to huuuge queue times. Unless the game is somehow rebalanced where comms is the new normal, it'd be too difficult on killers at higher ranks as survivor coordination would ruin the experience for killers
---
Idk man I dont memorize when they say shit. I dont even play anymore. I'm just here to read patch notes and shit on EA li- I mean BHVR
---
Just the one.
---
But she was crouched in front of me staring.
---
Ohh I see
---
This was actually really helpful. And it didn’t feel like you were talking down on me which felt nice :’) I just wanted to make a funny meme and I get met with a bit of hostility. But thank you. Everyone has a different playing style and I’ve just found I’m better at being a survivor. Also, I do play console, I play on ps4 and Xbox
---
Hag is just great in general.  Criminally underrated.  Been really getting into her lately.  I love the whole being anywhere and everywhere at once concept with her.  If you don't play her like an M1 killer and put 9 traps on your hook she's a lot of fun lol.  Too many people just don't play her properly.  Gives her a bad name as a proxycamper.
---
I ran face-first into Ghostface in the killer shack doorway. Scared and him, we both backed up real fast, stared at each other, and we sort of ran off for our own reasons. 
---
He 4k’d us, but damn was I laughing until the bitter end.
---
Spine Chill, Lithe, Dance With Me, Quick and Quiet for easy window escapes out of there while the killer checks the area for a survivor and you’re already long gone
---
The devs released a "new year" themed Claudette and Hillbilly. The Hillbilly set has him with a bunch of fireworks which I *guess* is New Years themed (imo skin would've been better on a killer like Clown by having him throw firecrackers, but lol no one plays Clown) but the Claudette one has nothing to do with New Years. It's just another dress to add to the pile of dresses that Claudette already has.
---
Hudda.
---
I mean to be fair Deep Wounds *was* changed recently :V
---
&gt;Please explain how a reduction in power is a nerf.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance#Nerf
---
Sounds like a typical solo queue game to me
---
I'm playing recently prestiged Legion at Rank 12, holy shit there are so many purple ranks and no green ranks
---
* me to the entity *
---
"That's right. I'm your dirty little bp slut"
---
Probably because he was a baby?
---
Only 2 types of killers?
---
Alright cunt.
---
I’m a rank 6 survivor and lately I’ve been matched with weird combos of survivors and killers. It’s never within my range lol. I had a game with a rank 17, a rank 13, and a rank 4 survivor and the killer was a rank 8. The matchmaking system is bizarre 😂
---
This is the issue honestly. I do agree that Oni needed *a* nerf but (like all nerfs from good ol' BHVR) it was incredibly ham-fisted and overdone. It's the same with the Deep Wounds nerf honestly: yes I do agree that Legion + Nemesis / Beast of Prey would've been overpowered, but instead of fixing these two perks they nerfed Deep Wounds *again.*
---
No offense but the examples of unpopular opinions are not unpopular
---
Clown and Jane got placed correctly
---
For me, it's the Doctor, hands down.  His wheezing, the wires protruding from his skin, and the absolute glee on his expression despite how fucked up his face is... idk man, that guy freaks me out the most when it comes to looks.    
---
But when it comes to sound, the Oni makes me shit bricks.  Just hearing his stomping around and the roars he makes has me feeling like I'm in Jurassic Park with the power shut down.
---
It doesn't actually do what it says it does for one. Plus when you go against Oni that is hilarious
---
Hey man if I can help one survivor rethink running that perk I've done my job lol.  You're right it sounds amazing on paper and for the longest time it was a staple on my personal loadout but once that healing speed nerf happened hell to the nah.  My buddy convinced me to ditch it at that point and I'm thankful he did.  I've grown so much as a player since removing it from my loadout.
---
But people still like the women screaming at cat meme...??
---
It’s a bug on console  among many others
---
Actually I hit rank one consistently. But thank you anyways.
---
It’s not going to be perfect immediately after release. You should expect changes in the beginning. Especially with this game
---
Jane. She thiccc
---
I still don't understand why they removed that button.
---
Steve, but only when he's in his Scoops Ahoy costume.  How tf am I supposed to hook something that adorable?  
---
I also have a soft spot for Claudettes.  Her whimpers are so cute I can't help but want to protec instead of attac.
---
*points towards hook*
---
I respect pallets so i can vault them then stab you.
---
Fixing something that was not intentional is not a nerf. Get your head out of your ass.
---
Most of the time I hear these things but I cant find the survivors anyways (because dumbass) like I hear the totem but I cant find where the totem  was
---
I remember getting a 4k on Sanctum as demogorgon. Had a salty survivor call me  "tunneling trash" because I had a portal above the basement and claimed he took a hit for the unhooked survivor although he took a hit for air. The saved survivor didn't even leave the basement, so I slug him using Infectious to find the salty player I was fully intending on targeting, so I guess using the Demogorgon's power is toxic lmao. You can destroy already active portals for a reason, but none of them bothered to try infortunately.
---
It...it is.. its in the game, when he bumps with the saw he does "the dance"
---
A Dr Weird/Aqua Teen reference. You just singlehandedly restored my faith in this sub and humanity.
---
Funny how the most wholesome man is one of the best killers
---
Nope. 1) Her addons are appropiate, but she relies on them heavily and most of her viable ones are rare. BUT, this is assuming she's viable at all with her base kit (which she is not). The reason being is that she becomes an M1 killer after certain blinks. 2) Yes, the typical nurse chase mindgame is their, but it is more damaging to the nurse now because she has a limited amount of blinks. At high ranks, it was easy to dodge her blink attacks (in most maps) the thing that made her scary was that she was able to gain distance with her infinite amount of blinks and this was important because most survivors would run across the map after one hit. 3) That's exactly my point. She was never good with indoor maps. The only saving grace for her, was her ability to blink however many times she wants. Yes, she becomes just like the Billy, but the Billy has a saving grace in the fact that he can down you instantly and has an easier time doing so if you just hug the survivor instead of chainsawing across the map. She's just an M1 killer now, with limited amount of teleports which makes her easy to manipulate, especially at the high ranks as seeing how many of the players at the high ranks have thousands or hundreds of hours handling blink lunge attacks.
---
I think you want people to tell you that you AREN'T in the bad so I'm gonna give you half of what you want: facecamping was the smart thing to do, you weren't in the wrong there. BM'ing is of bad intent so that part was in the bad. Be the better man, as they say.
---
I’m an R1 survivor and I haven’t seen a Nurse in weeks. If the alleged “best killer in the game” doesn’t exist where they are supposed to be the strongest, how is she supposedly the best killer in the game?
---
Even though BHVR does have a reputation with tripling down with their nerfs, this was just an accident. They DID intend to nerf the flick down to a cap of 90 degrees. They just fucked up and overdid it to shit (I guess because they just can't help themselves). They will fix him eventually but it pisses me off that they're taking so goddamn long (presumably because of Christmas and New Years), cause he was SO fun before the nerf.
---
But I love "extwa cwispy" Billy
---
Totally not the killers fault that they stayed with you in chase for that long smh
---
If a perk less, no addon Nurse 4ks against red rank survivors, those dudes deserved to die lol.
---
They could use text bubbles that only other survivors can see.
---
Once had a game as ghost face like that. It didn't last very long...
---
I literally had a dwight slugged and crawled to basement to give me the last sacrifice because I was a "Daddy Myers" with agitation and Iron Grasp. He KNEW
---
1) decisive is used to ANTI tunnel, so no it's actually repaying a nice tunnel
---
2) getting to bloodlust 3 is their own fault for not breaking a pallet in a loop or not giving up on a chase
---
3) his third statement is understandable
---
That's what people say about every big change that benefits either side. I'm certain that in the unlikely scenario were what your saying happens, then the Devs would find a way to make the core gameplay more balanced to support it. But like I said, it's an unlikely scenario and it would be best way to bridge the infamous SWF gap.
---
You say that like it holds any merit.
---
ik dude, literally toxic SMH
---
And you actually think escaping = good.
---
wait legion was viable 7 times
---
Why do you think it isn’t good?
---
Not what I said, but go off.
---
Okay? As a trade off you run faster than her and it’s been shown off now that you can force at worst 2 double blinks out of here (which is 12 extra seconds of her time due to the recharge mechanic) just by running in a straight line. 
---
There is no skill involved in countering her. That’s a fucking problem
---
Two of the three he said could've been avoided, Decisve gets countered by slugging and bloodlust three gets countered by actually interrupting people on gens
---
Statistically false.
---
This will be my technically first DbD fanart, and I’m really proud of it, even if I know it’s incredibly flawed. Don’t be afraid to give criticism, go ham with it, pun not intended.
---
Oh I didn't realize that, thank you.
---
Calling a baby killer trash, while you play with red ranks swf.. the hell man!
---
You can't die to not being healed if you're never able to be healed in the first place.
---
If you think dying a lot is bad then you obviously think escaping means you're good.
---
tHat iS fUckInG tOxic dUde

Just like Sprint Burst,Adrenaline and Dead Hard huh lil buddy?
---
oh no
---
Leaks by daylight said it should be out on the 7th of january
---
I said die first. But as usual, you have a hard time reading. Gnight buddy.
---
Considering the counterplay to Nurse now is to run in a straight line, you are correct. You get Twitchies and entitled survivor mains who whine that they died so now the killer needs gutted.
---
Which member of the legion is cutest frank, julie, susie, or joey?
---
Did you see how mad he got yesterday because of the team he went against?, He was so angry at them because they might play against other killers the way they played against him and I felt like Otz is litterally all the killer mains dad protecting them from these survivors
---
How the hell would you even nerf a loop?
---
Onis nerfs were meh. He’s..meh. 
---
Nurse went from god to garbage. 
---
There’s a giant difference.
---
He called a baby killer a trash while he plays with smurfs red ranks swf.. this is sad and infuriating at the same time.
---
I'm sorry, but this made no sense
---
"how is she the best killer in the game"
---
the nurse be like: whats a pallet? wait are walls a thing? these twats think vaulting can make space against teleportation?
---
if the nurse KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THE KILLER WELL then you can counter her
---
Oh spare me. The Nurse nerf turned her from god tier to Clown tier
---
*Hangs head and fistbumps.* Nice.
---
So if that’s the case then how is she nonexistent at high ranks? Why is her use rate similar to Clown?
---
Reducing something's power is a nerf, even if its labeled a "bug fix." Get your head out of your ass.
---
Oh wait it's so far up your ass it's coming out of your head.
---
They should remove keys and moris though
---
&gt;They will fix him eventually

Wait.. when did they say...

&gt;Not nerfing low-tier Killers
---
...Oh it's one of these posts.
---
By shortening it or removing super safe pallets/windows.
---
*raises hand*
---
I don't think forever Freddy's addons were ever an issue. He maxed out at 15% slower gen completion, and that required everyone to be asleep.  Let's say everyone is asleep with old forever Freddy and two survivors are working on the last gen. It takes 44 seconds without his addons. With his addons, it takes 50 seconds. That's insignificant when compared with other things like pop or ruin.
---
The issue is that Freddy has incredible generator pressure, which he still does. If survivors three-gen themselves against a decent Freddy, they will not win, before or after the nerf.
---
Ugh ikr, I phased back to the hook as spirit (I hadn’t camped, I was kicking gens on the other side of the map) and when I got there, the unhooked person was healing under the hook and when I downed them, they called me a tunneller and a camper. It’s so frustrating, if I was genuinely playing unfairly I wouldn’t be so mad at their messages but they’re just salty for no real reason
---
But I mean more the swinging of the chainsaw he does at the end of the movie
---
Well you'd be one of the few
---
Furthermore I’m interested to see what you have to say to the fact that the most effective counter to a Nurse is to just run in a straight line. 
---
Here’s proof 
---
https://youtu.be/fcO-rJBkcOo
---
I needed to escape a match with Nea and am a very new player. I went up against a spirit today who kept downing me (me being a potato). She ended up carrying me and dropping me at the exit. Made my day.
---
I only play killer, I find that playing as a survivor is not much fun to me, I like playing as classic horror characters as well as being the one giving fear, not receiving it. As a killer, almost every game I get a hate message from one or more players, and as much as that sounds bad, let me tell you how it isn't. Just mess with them. Waste their time and make a joke about their message. For example, make it like a game show, or come up with a comeback, or even just be as weird as possible and see how long it takes for them to give up replying, set a high score. At this point, it's half the fun of being a killer for me, very entertaining.
---
"Hope" I'm done responding to you, to be quite honest.
---
Mhm. Most of the killers at low ranks have already played survivor and have a basic knowledge of most game mechanics, while the survivors are much newer.
---
Same with Spine Chill.
---
BTW Spine Chill (and Resilience) still makes you vault faster despite the descriptions being updated.
---
That sounds way more complicated than just adding in-game voice chat. Especially since 3rd Party voice chat has existed with DBD since the addition of SWF.
---
Just take one of the cold wind farm maps and remove EVERYTHING And leave just a huge empty space. Win/win situation for everyone
---
I assume you are new to the game and don't understand hit boxes
---
But there's not really any need to bridge the SWF/solo gap, it adds an element of skill to the game. Without comms you need to decide when to go for unhooks, when to stick with gens, and try to figure out the killer's location. A good solo survivor will be able to make these reads properly. If everyone had the comms an SWF team had, these variables are removed and the killer is put at an even bigger disadvantage. I think at low to mid ranks it would be ok, but high rank games would be hell for killers (I say this as a rank 1 survivor)
---
The killer is in the other side of the map. Two boosted morons at fucking red ranks crouch to me and then keep on hiding until I hit the second stage of the hook to then "save" me. 
---
Honestly in these times I won't save, heal or do anything helpful for the rest of the damn game. I will be waiting for the hatch, no thank you.
---
you should put /s after you joke since people will think you are being serious
---
This is an awesome killer concept, I love everything about it. The only thing I'd change is not allowing you to block exit gate switches with the statue. I could see people complaining about holding the game hostage with that.
---
really really really high learning curve with equally high rewards. she is the strongest but nobody plays her because nobody CAN play her EFFECTIVELY. if your not remotely good you will get shit on and if you are remotely good then you can do ok but you need to NOW HOW TO PLAY THE KILLER well in order to 4k every game no add on no perks. i personal arent aiming to do well i aim to have fun so i dont play nurse i play hag Freddy sprite and plague. and explain how you counter nurse
---
I'm not even a Ninja fan, but watching the reddit community have a mental breakdown just because the guy is starting to post DBD content is actually hilarious. Hysterical, really.
---
Thousands of hours? *laughs in the modern mister rogers, paulie esther*
---
Imagine DCing against Legion after their first rework.
---
What are we supposed to see here?
---
If you figure out a good solution, let me know.
---
But really, I'm in the same boat. It helps to only play when you're not in a bad mood and expecting the bad manners as you go in. At least, that's what I try and I'm a little bit relieved when someone doesn't teabag at pallets.
---
Holy shit that's cool
---
Red ranks contain the best players. Red rank Nurses are the best Nurses. Are they all “not remotely good”? 
---
Also you counter Nurse by breaking LOS and being unpredictable. So you can’t pallet loop her, big whoop. Play stealthy, focus on evasion, not looping. There’s a difference in gameplay
---
I mean it flat out is. There isn't even an argument to make: get a single safe unhook do 2 gens you get Iri Benevolent and Lightbringer which is enough to pip.
---
cool run in a straight line and get blinked to and hit. if the killer isnt too good you might dodge but if they are you will get hit. face one good nurse and it will change your opinion
---
Imagine being this delusional.
---
Who are you talking to?
---
He said that? Well then I’m sure as hell not going back.
---
Then stop responding. You obviously believe everyone is privileged enough to afford a mic.
---
 
---
 One final time, the game cannot detect 3rd party chats, so it cant punish players for using voice comms. It can only punish players for grouping up. Why you're too dense to understand this logic is beyond me.
---
Yeah, they really are pretty ugly. Like 90's Nordstrom ugly. At least some of them you can mix and match to get a decent look.
---

---
I'm glad somebody said it.
---
Then stop responding yourself. Happy Holidays.
---
You waste too much of her time to make it worth the chase. You run in a straight line and pull off the occasional juke and boom, you have a foolproof counter to Nurse. There’s borderline zero skill involved in countering Nurse now.
---
just because they are red ranked doesn't mean if they got to red rank with clow hag myers and plauge that they could play nurse
---
You're the one that said they were done responding. Apparently you weren't.
---
I'm not mad that he's playing dbd, its just that he calls himself a pro and uses a smurf red rank account. It's just weird and cringey considering he just started
---
&gt;Every match should be randomly generated
---
Maps are randomly generated, to an extent. Depending on how the game links together certain vaults and pallets, you can have some maps that flip-flop between favoring killer or survivor.
---
as much as i wish this game was hide and seek the killer has a lot of tools to find you
---
I knew I should've blocked you earlier.
---
Legion is still good btw lul
---
And you're still responding. Good job.
---
No but somebody who got up there with Nurse is obviously gonna play Her at red ranks. Those people have fled her in droves. So I fail to see how she’s “the best in the game” if the people who got to red ranks with her have just up and left her.
---
Imagine being this much of a Survivor main.
---
Hey guys the 2018 Lunar New Year Flashlight change wasn't a buff to Survivors! It was a *bug fix!* The devs said so! 4head
---
And you have a lot of tools to not get spotted.
---
Anecdotal, but I'd much rather play against a god nurse than a god huntress, if I'm honest.
---
Ghost face with I'm all ears
---
if they didn't run no mither then it is not a true sabo squad
---
ok thats the same with every killer tho, waste time. and if every killer saw that guy at that distance only billy and oni could reach him faster (well hag and demmo but forget it)
---
Awesome, appreciate u
---
Veronicuhh. These types of people pollute dbd
---
I was actually waiting for a lobby as the Doctor (Trapper and Hag were easy) and have genuinely spent more time at the waiting screen than in game, so I will see to the ghost face
---
Well as a Rank 1 Killer, I'm not worried about it. I agree that there's a specific element of skill involved with playing Solo, but that doesn't change the fact that SWF and 3rd Party voice chat exists, and they're not going anywhere. I'm willing to sacrifice the skill required for Solo play if it streamlines Survivor play.
---
it all comes down to who has the better tools and who has the better hide and seek skills
---
it is called having eyes and paying attention they shouldn't get a tool to help them that they will surely use too much and not be ready to stop using it like NOED for new killers
---
Only the last one makes any sense
---
His m1 can still hit through the window you just need to time it right. Also it’s not like a giant club is actually supposed to phase through walls and hit survivors behind them, it may be good for the killer but it doesn’t really count toward good game experience because it is technically a bug
---
shes underplayed not underpowered
---
And you as a survivor can win that game lol. You can be unpredictable and evade. I’ve done it before with loop focused perks
---
So why is her killrate similar to Clown?
---
If you can't get stalk- don't go for it. The stealth ability is good enough. don't try to get greedy and stalk when you can't.
---
just kick my fucking door down and nerf me to my face
---
No offense but why does everyone keep insisting on calling him Micheal when it's obviously Michael? It's one letter. Easily mistakenly put there. But you have to battle autocorrect on this one.
---
How so? Text “bubbles” already appear in game when you are next to a gen, chest, totem, locker, window, pallet or a hooked survivor, and those have been there since the beginning. Just assign a control to each phrase and have it show above the survivor in the bottom left, or across the survivors chest/above their head. Hypothetically of course, because I don’t really believe voice coms are the answer to this problem anyway.
---
I usually always do. I think it’s hilarious that people will take the time to send a hate message. I don’t get many though other than the “gg ez” ones but I just ignore their messages. I think one of my favorite messages I’ve received was from another survivor. They literally messaged me saying they found the hatch and I should die already. Gave me quite a laugh 😂
---
I did that because hes a tunnler, go cry now killer main
---
because players that are trying her and arent good are muddying it up
---
The killer won't have bloodlust if they just hit you. A hit cancels bloodlust stacks.
---
He was mad at his own doing? What a man, what a man, what a man
---
^
---
well as a killer and a survivor  (i play very equally)its a skill and perk game
---
Haha, that's hilarious! I've played a good amount of survivor mind you, two max characters, but I've never gotten a hate message from a fellow survivor.
---
Every action have its reaction
---
I have a hard time believing her killrate tanked that hard due to players at the best ranks trying her and muddying it up. 
---
Console players weren’t statistically significant enough to skew her killrate down. I have a hard time believing the few bad players that wanted to try her were statistically significant enough to skew her killrate THAT hard.
---
What is that even supposed to mean? First off, I don't "main survivor". Even if I did how is that even relevant?
---
Your arguments are elementary and you're making yourself look stupid. But that's probably natural for you considering you live on this sub.
---
Please stop replying anytime.
---
You don't love lying on the ground while exhausted? I've had times where I dead hard earlier than I should because I know dedicated servers will fuck me, but I still don't end up using it early enough and go down.
---
pfffff dude ur the one bullying basically a child here thinking that ur cool idk what excuse u wanna pull out next maybe that he didnt say GGWP to u bc u know how to flashlight blind a killer that probably doesnt even know how to counter it rly 10/10 from u even a fucking killer can show some curtsy to a survivor that is clearly in the wrong ranks
---
Yeah but if you get knocked down while vaulting a window with lithe, you get to crawl faster for a few seconds. It's like a shitty version of tenacity.
---
People say slugging is toxic

Thats why you have such irrelevant replies, have fun stalking me.

Thanks for the advice man! I’ve just bought him and I’m levelling him up rn
---
A Claudette who just **blends** in the environment.
---
i wanna guess that out of every 10 nurses i faced 3 are good nnuff to 4k at 3 gens done and the others are potatoes but lets agree to dissagree because i came on redit for memes and this is not that but i respect your opinion and am happy we had this conversation i hope i may have caused you to rethink some aspects
---
Do you mean: *shit in space?*
---
You'd still get downed if you activated the vault on your screen, but it's not activated yet according to dedicated servers. It'd be just like how dead hard is now.
---
Man, might as well make walking toxic, If you move on the map you're a toxic (survivor/killer)!
---
I was happy with the basically perfect score, however I now realise I didn’t max survival. RIP.
---
Well that’s what I mean, no matter what u do it’s toxic
---
It’s hard at first! I totally understand why you might not wanna continue! But I think what makes dbd the most enjoyable is being able to play either and understand the game fully. It’s gonna suck until one day you realize that you actually aren’t all that bad (happened with me lol)
---
Good luck!!
---
Dbd community is fucked if this keeps going on XD
---
If you get his cosmetics, I recommend the classic robe and devil mask. Embody the stealth. I personally use that with the devil blade- which is optional. Just- don't get caught before your first stab and you should be golden. Good Luck and have fun!
---
I miss 5 seconds ago when I didn’t read this
---
You’re absolutely right, imo you can’t understand the game unless you’ve played both sides.
---
Thanks dude :)
---
Those who like to...hang around
---
No problem! Good luck getting back into killer dude :) definitely worth it
---
Thanks, I’ll check it out! :)
---
I’m pretty sure it will continue exponentially until the game dies
---
It's really really freaking sad. So many games suffer from crap like this = /. It just makes the game boring and if there was a competitive scene to the game you can consider it dead or atleast heavily hampered by changes that happen for stupid reasons..
---
Eh I strongly disagree. I play both survivor and killer equally, and I very rarely get a toxic killer, while toxic survivors are a dime a dozen.
---
Whats best for the fourth perk slot then? Whispers?
---
Oh well, let's make the best of it
---
Using this logic, [anyone below trapper on this chart detailing red rank pick rate](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/910/6KD3I8P3L1V9.png) is worse than trapper. Pick rate does not equal viability. Hag is the lowest chosen, yet she is still a very strong killer when **used correctly.** A small amount of nurses are amazing, and those are the ones that get to red ranks, so of course its rare to see them. Not a lot of people are willing to put in the time to learn her.
---
Speaking of which, it sounds like all of the problems you have with her still existed before her nerfs, and if you think old nurse was one of the worst killers in the game, boy do I have news for you.
---
Speaking of stats, in that same post they list the [new nurse performance rate](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/864/BDOZ0GYZMPZW.png), which is 50/50, like every killer is balanced around.
---
And in 98% of the cases it goes down in 30 secs. Just pull through.
---
If you compare the games current state compared ti what it used to be I'd say it's fairly balanced.

What is it with the keys? I’m a killer main and idk wtf it is about keys that people complain about, they’re like maps, information items, so what they use a skeleton key to get hatch? Fuck em move on, it’s not often enough to be annoying
---
As a killer. I'm letting a last survivor do 4 gens, (when I killed 3 of them and no1 did any gen) stun me with pallets, open some chests, clean totems and finally open the exit gate.
---
Well yeah its fucking necessary, If you don't use it then the gens go back in fucking seconds, And it's pretty easy to find MOST of the time because the devs have it in shit places like in the middle of fucking nowhere or right beside a gen
---
Imagine carrying a survivor to a hook and then stepping in your own trap so the survivor escapes and then pallet stuns you right after to add insult to injury.
---
This post was made by a Sad Trapper Main.
---
Even if it had been a perfect score, mods would've removed it as oversaturated content. Not bragging but I get at least 1 32k score game daily.
---
Ok? It's a good perk and people are going to run good perks most of the time.
---
Next you'll make everyone runs bbq, noed, ds, borrowed time, dead hard, adrenaline posts and so on...
---
Strange thing to complain about.
---
If I'm going against toxic survivors, I play a toxic killer. It really depends on my mood.  There are typically three responses from me.  
---
First option, I tunnel and face-camp the hell out of them.  I never tunnel and face-camp survivors who don't  t-bag, flashlight click, or body block.  But if they abuse those mechanics, I'll abuse the mechanics that work to my favor too.  
---
Second option, I never DC, but there have been times when I just decided to stand there and let them farm if they were going to be super toxic.  This has actually earned me some apologies from survivors who realized they were being overly toxic.  
---
Third option is if I'm playing Pig or Ghostface.  If the survivors are gonna be toxic, I'll be toxic back but in a goofy way.  So if they t-bag me after pallet drops, I'll t-bag them after a hook.  Survivors tend to respect goofy killers.  I've had t-bagging dance parties with several groups before and it's a fun time.
---
Man I can't do that for shit
---
Huntress-beast of prey
---
But then the events would just be big disappointments like in Overwatch
---
I haven't used ruin in 3 rank resets because I hate seeing it as Survivor. It definitely has fixed the I lost because of my perk or win because of my perk bullshit.
---
I got lucky. I got it first try when a person tried to hook bomb the basement with me as clocked gf. 2 killed in basement with 3 gens left. This was also at rank 10-12 range.
---
I had a game where I had killed two of the 4 man swf and the other 2 teabagged me at the gates so I didn’t give them the satisfaction of even going over there. They stayed right until the end of the EGC and refused to leave. I will never understand survivors who act like that
---
i don’t know if you’re being sarcastic or not...so i’m just gonna assume you are
---
Talking about killrate tho, she’s comparable to Clown. 
---
Her problem is that her basekit is now trash
---
*runs a sabo team in 2019*

---
*shocked pikachu meme*
---
So you watched A Series of Unfortunate Events, and that brought you to this post about how to make Legion viable?
---
Bloodhound is an underrated perk
---
For one, if you're good enough with killer it's a waste of a perk slot since you should be able to end the game before then, or if not make enough progress so you won't need it anyway.
---
High rank survivors will cleanse totems before endgame so there's a good chance you won't get to use it, and even if you do, the second you get a down survivors will search for predictable totem spots and have it gone likely before you get a second use out of it.
---
Once it's gone the killer will likely only get one hook out of it and unless they're on death hook they will be forced to camp and as long as there is an exit opened of 99'd, any survivor with BT (which there is likely to be) will hook bomb and the unhooked surv will tank a hit so they both make it. Even if the unhooked goes down before escaping they could have DS (which, again, is likely) so they can just crawl out and force the killer to pick them up.
---
I realise this is arguing for if the survivors are good which isn't always the case, but it is still a very survivor-dependent perk which is why I think it's very overrated.
---
I did it on my first try sweating as Nurse at rank 12. Survivors are dumb there, it wasn't that hard for me.
---
Problem is the 4 gen with Dark Sense one. Fuck.
---
Lmao oh boy
---
For me personally, I have to be in the right set of mind to play killer. If I'm in a chill mood and just want to relax I play survivor but if I'm in I want to kick some ass mood then I play killer :)
---
otz is a real wholesome guy and i really appreciate that. i think i'd enjoy watching him regardless of skill because he's just chill and friendly. v positive and complimentary to the people he plays against, and even if they're not good he still doesn't talk shit about them. i dicked over somebody on stream once, and while i think they deserved it, it's not the kind of behaviour i feel like i should have put out there, even to my tiny audience.
---
it's the kind of energy/attitude i wish more people had, especially people like ninja who have big fanbases &amp; that skew toward age groups that are more easily influenced
---
*cough cough* NOED is only good against low rank survivors *cough cough*
---
No. You didn’t. I’m a diehard Nurse fan and have been since day 1. I hate what happened to her. She is one of the most unfun killers to play as and playing against her is so easy my 8 year old brother can do it. 
---
It’s pathetic. She’s awful.
---
Exactly.
---
That sounds ass and back to old legion with franks mixtape what is the counterplay to that? like franks mixtape fucking nothing. At least that is what it sounds too me
---
What sucks is there are only so many items a chest can contain and I found a key in all but one match out of 4 (I think. Might have been 5). I almost always carry Franklin's because even if no one brings in an item, chests are just vending machines with more often than not good items. (Even a brown toolbox is useful when trying to pump out that final gen)
---
Absolutely, I just stood their afk as if I fucked off to do something else until they were done with their bullshit. My favorite ones are the ones that teabag so much they die to the end game collapse.
---
Haha, I always think I’m in the right mindset to play killer, and as soon as I get into a match and toxic survivors start teabagging me, I lose my shit
---
so this is a "my opinion is right fuck u" kind of post ok bai
---
I agree with all these statements, genuinely! But, less experienced survivors are stomped by Noed- or if the killer is “too good” and the survivors don’t have time to cleanse the totems before it pops. I think it’s a crutch perk, and it isn’t as good as it’s made out to be too! (: definitely a baby stomper perk.
---
I think it depends on killer, map, and perks. Otherwise it’s pretty fair game
---
It’s great on legion!
---
Except as mentioned above, you can't find a mori for just opening a box. They both need to be fixed. I think most of the community agrees on that.
---
I actually got the last challenge by complete accident. Like I tried a lot, *A LOT* with a "basement build" buy failed Everytime. I gave up on it, but left it active because it was literally the last challenge I was missing so why not. Played a game as Freddy with my standard build (bbq, ruin, pop, whispers) and found myself with a three gen next to basement and was lucky enough that no one DC'd (the real challenge). Felt good to actually get it, because I've literally never gotten 4 sacs in the basement before
---
Rank?
---
Not once have I seen a cute hag you have done the impossible
---
You're not responding. Every problem you have with the new nurse is present in the old one, I don't understand what you believe this nerf did other than make more of her addons useful...
---
Lmao I guess you havent experienced a SWF 4 man group who gen rushes and uses the key before you can even get two or even one hook. Theyre super unbalanced as the killer has literally no way to counter it. Once 4 gens are done they can all dip into hatch.
---
nice man but it is console where kills max sense can't keep up so lol
---
Really? Never tried it on legion but now that u say that it seems it would work really well.
---
He washes it when it starts to make crunchy sounds.
---
He is viable, please.
---
I don't find them annoying either, but it can suck to have 3 people escape when they have two gens left with the game going in your favour. Happened to me before and got bm'ed. I didn't care that much at the time about it but I can see how annoying it is.
---
Yeah, Ninja doesn't do that, Ninja makes fun of people he goes against and when he is losing he makes up excuses, Otz only got mad yesterday because he felt like they would do this to other people, He gives off the wholesome vibe and never does he make fun of or respond negatively to anyone unless for like a joke, Tbh he's the only person that makes me feel like that I shouldn't give up playing because people say shit and he reminds me that there are still good people in dbd
---
frenzy is a bitch, so it helps a lot. (: 
---
It’s quite useful on Spirit, too.
---
bvbyscorpio is my psn. Red rank consecutively, veteran player. 
---
You need help? I think I can give some good tips
---
Explain to me what you think my issue is and I’ll explain why it isn’t existent in her old base kit.
---
Dm me if you wanna plY
---
I’ve run into several swfs before without keys and it’s just as annoying, not much difference with a key besides a faster game
---
&gt; I never try to be toxic, and when I do its usually towards someone that is laughably bad
---
Maybe you were just laughably bad?
---
every killer is viable to me at least
---
she is like all other survivors nothing different
---
I just started yesterday sure
---
I disagree. A lot of red rank survivors will just sit on gens and ignore everything else especially if you don't run ruin.
---
Yeah me too unless "Viable = 4k'ing each match"
---
Well unluckily for you new players are not very good at having eyes or paying attention. Even then its not common for the killer to come up on you from an angle where you didnt expect and try to hide or run the other way but you are in sight of him
---
That video cowsiam made where it was proximity seemed like it could work if you talk killer will be able to find you eadier
---
I never thought about that. I'll have to rethink the 3-hit down idea. I suppose if my changes went through some of the add-ons would also have to change.
---
Still no counter play. Atleast killers can do sometimes do omething against gen rush. Killers can't do jack shit about keys
---
Yeah, circumstance I guess, but if ur getting gen rushed (supposedly) or the game is just going by really fast, just makes the game faster, without the key it seems the game was already rigged from the start
---
My psn is cadaver51917 just add me and tell me your from this reddit and we can play
---
What happened? Did he got into a trapping loop and couldn't get out?
---
I hope this never happens to me, yikes... poor Evan.
---
If you don’t mind going against my rank killers, I’m down.  But tbh they’re gonna be easier to learn from since it’s true to how killers should act- not newbies
---
Franklins
---
They already were but at least they *existed.*
---
I’m new I’m 19 and have a friend that’s 17
---
She is a strong powerful russian woman. She doesn't need a puny axe to break pallets.
---
How, can someone explain for console
---
His name is Trap Daddy
---
Exactly! But people don't think like that. It's all about TTV = bad.
---
No our david glitched out after being hit and couldln't be healed, couldn't move, or do anything. and then our david dc'd but trapper was trapped even after endgame collapse :(
---
if this happened we would be back to stupidly good legion
---
Then those are very bad red rank survivors. If youre a red rank survivors and get insta downed by NOED, it is 100% your fault. You can nullify the perk completely so I dont understand how anyone can possibly complain or say it's a good perk. if people are still having problems with NOED then theyre not very good at the game and dont understand how to counter it.
---
Edit: lmao downvote really? Aight keep getting punished by a crutch perk lmao not my fault yall dont know how to counter NOED and think it's a good perk
---
My point was that the fact that they called themselves events made the lack of content even more disappointing and apparent. If they had just released some skins it would have been a lot better since then we would have just gotten skins and not been so hyped for something new that will never come.
---
Since when does ninja play dead by daylight?
---
Oh, ok, I actually knew that, I just didn't understand what you meant.
---
well no shit no shit intended but that is something u need to learn without extra help u have a joystick/mouse you have eyes u hear a heartbeat u should start looking
---
You can pick up a key after its been franklins'd.
---
Takes 10 franklins hits to break a key. Franklins is a garbage counter especially if they just stealth around with 1 gen left you won't even see them to take the key they'll 3 man escape as you watch your last 3 gens.
---
to me it just means feeling like i wasn't powerless :/
---
ok then well lets agree to disagree
---
**UPDATED NEWS**: Trapper was released from his glitched prison after about 5 minutes of waiting.
---
**EDIT**: more links to proof

Did the killer pip for one kill? If not, I don't think that's really abusable, survivors would just gen rush and leave and the killer would depip.

---
I’m simple if I lose,I lose.
---
I don’t wiggle because I either went to the bathroom or am on my phone.
---
I don’t expect kindness of a killer.
---
Yeah, that's enough for me. I like playing Legion, Wraith etc.
---
Because no one cares?
---
"You can't tell me I'm wrong, everyone uses hex ruin"
---
Uh... yeah... it's a good perk. This is such a useless post.
---
You need 1 more gen completed than the amount of remaining survivors for the hatch to spawn. So for all 4 survivors to escape through the hatch you need all 5 gens completed.
---
but fun is always the most important part
---
Nobody *needs* any perks. Your point?
---
Camp, tunnel, at that point it doesn’t matter
---
Lmao, noe that I've had some time to cool off, i was doing pretty bad. I wasn't guarding gens, i wasn't quitting chases properly, and i didn't guard my hexes, so yeah, i was doing bad.
---
I mean Franklins is soft counter to SWF groups but like you said, you can just pick that shit up again and still have a good amount of usage from it
---
Oh... well that sucks. F for the David and the Trapper.
---
u know it is funny I play only trapper pretty much and never has this happened to me
---
I actually like it. Dbd perk icons are really well designed.
---
That's not really what viable means though. Every killer can kill and perform well, but that doesn't make them a good pick if you want a reasonable chance at winning. That's what viable means.
---
I'm sorry, I didn't meant to disrespect the OG killer.
---
trapper definitely has that classic slasher movie energy that fills you with dread because no matter what you do, he'll keep coming. the charred skin and metal sticking out of him only adds to it because you know he's been through it and he's still going
---
spirit has a similar kind of relentless vibe to me. obviously from a different genre of horror, but she's another character you can just look at and immediately know that she's been through some shit and that only fuels her. 
---
honestly most of them are off the charts scary for one reason or another but those two visually communicate a trope that's fucking terrifying to me
---
It is the most important part, that's why I don't run ruin. It's fucking annoying for Survivors and if I win or lose it feels like it's just because of ruin, fuck that perk. Haven't used it in 3 rank resets.
---
ranking system is booty rn but can we take a second to look at the top survivor's perk choice? Who runs sprint burst and lithe?!
---
it is garbo alright but this is how BHVR intended it to work ig has to be if this is how it is normally right?
---
Good survivors know this isn't true
---
Remember anyone who bitches and moans is a neckbearded whale. DBD is a casual game that you play for fun. As long as you are having a good time, that's what matters. The toxic fanbase is just that, poison.
---
Survivors are all the same, But I'd say if you're going for adept try and save your decisive strike till the moment when you most noleed it, also, Laurie's really fucking loud so try your best to not get hurt and if you do get hurt either have iron will or get yourself healed really quickly with a medkit, dont use self care that takes too long, That's really All I have to say
---
I get bullied when playing killer too :( But when I play survivor I gotta cary the whole team.
---
You're not wrong. It's by far and away the strongest killer perk. Can't blame killers for using their strong perks.
---
no I believe in just being able to just have fun and do something with every killer that makes them all viable but it doesnt make them all equally strong
---
I’ve been having the same issue man. all red rank survivors with DS and every meta perk under the sun. it’s impossible to do any challenges
---
This reply doesn't have enough upvotes, I'm here to help fix that.
---
Makes me realise that the system Fri13 had had some merit. You'd either play Jason or survivor, and everyone played a bit of everything. No mains, for better or worse.
---
They loosened the matchmaking range a bit before the holidays to give survivors faster queues. They discussed this in the most recent dev stream.
---
someone who is trying fun stuff

Thank you that's pretty helpful she is extremely loud

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ehgfcq/virtualbox_exploit_eac_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yeah and it’s not just a one off occurrence, it’s EVERY game.
---
This is my friend the Nea playing with us can confirm and that’s great go Evan ;_;
---
You're welcome, also, She's an average height survivor so playing sneaky with her is also an option
---
You're also a man of culture, I respect that.
---
If only the killer had some sort of like, area of effect type deal that gave survivors an audio warning when they were getting close. Call it a horror circle, or something.
---
I dunno I've always thought Scarecrow Billy was pretty funny.
---
I didn't even need the audio. Oh my fucking God I love it.
---
That sounds like a bad idea. New players get their hands on the game only to get shot on by people WAY out of their ranks. This is the type of stuff that makes others not wanna play.
---
I'm a 15 and was just put in a match against 2 level 8s and 2 level 7s..... I feel you and on top of that they were all neas and you could understand how bs that is
---
You dont bait a swing with dead hard if you are good. DH for distance should be the only reason to even use dead hard. Can't reach window? Dead hard. Can't reach pallet? Dead hard. Can't reach exit gates/hatch? Dead hard. The only time you want to use it for a bait is when you have nothing else available near you
---
It's used a lot in the lower ranks for this exact reason. Bad killers can't play without it and bad survivors don't know how to counter it.
---
May not be good to you, but it seems to be OP to most of the survivors, especially high ranks
---
You don't find it weird there's an item that just says 'end the game'? Moris and keys shouldn't exist.
---
That sounds cool. I never played it, but it’s a shame what happened to it with the whole copyright battle
---
Even if you camp or tunnel..."Hey bud i dropped the key by shack" wow the key is in play again even though the key bringer was tunneled to death.
---
While tunneling/camping i also likely brought myself to a 1 or 2 gens left scenario so all 3 key escape.
---
They're ridiculously strong items.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eh94wk/in_the_creation_of_this_meme_alone_legion_and_pig/fcj04ds/?context=3
---
I'll use the video here as an example.
---
In this video, the nurse is attempting to use her blink as a roundabout form of running. As the survivor runs in a straight line, the nurse blinks in a straight line. 
---
If at any point in the first example the nurse blinked diagonally, attempting to cut off the path of the survivor, they would have been forced to double back and lose time, allowing you to catch up if your prediction is correct. 
---
The second example is assuming a lot of factors. First of all, this can only be done if the path ahead is entirely clear, no pallets/jungle gyms/buildings or anything that would make the survivor turn or move in a way that isn't forward. The nurse, by design, gets her ground by going through defenses and obstacles that survivors cannot, effectively increasing her map traversal capabilities. 
---
This means that, yes, if you do not come across any obstacles/environmental walls, running in a straight line is a way of wasting time and then getting downed anyway.
---
Does this mean nurse is bad? No. Normal killers can have their time wasted as well, through pallet loops. Pallet loops are everywhere by intentional design, there isn't a map without them; and they are always numerous. Nurse's time waster can happen sometimes on some maps, and they still go down in the end because (unlike pallet loops) there is no reset; once you hit a wall your dead. In a pallet loop, the whole chase resets when you use the pallet itself. 
---
So yes, nurse is able to have her time wasted much like any other killer, but comparitively, the method at which you waste time is much harder to pull off and ends in a pretty much guaranteed down
---
I think you're on the wrong sub reddit
---
&lt;~~~ Deaf guy. Heartbeat doesn't help. Empathy does. 👍
---
You’re right
---
Bbq chili is pretty damn good...
---
Bro that match was 3 P3 Claudettes and a bright flashy Nea, on Yamaoka Estate.
---
What you say works if they are in the open and you should never fall for Dead Hard in the open, the problem with DH is, when its used on a loop to make distance, than there is nothing you can do as killer, no bait or anything.
---
Whats the perks
---
Yo look, it's that famous rapper M&amp;M!
---

---
This is an exaggeration obviously. But there are a few noteworthy examples.
---
Others weren't able to play period because these match ups weren't happening. What's the better choice? 30 minute+ wait times or uneven matches? I'd take the faster queues personally.
---
I guess you’re right, but in general it’s only effective if 1) you complete three gens and 2) find the hatch without a noise notification. It’s definitely powerful, but so are moris and if moris exist can’t skeleton keys?
---
Give mikey a shot. It's very satisfying knowing they have no clue who they're up against or even where you are until you're already at an advantage. He's also quite good at using toxicity against them. You wouldn't believe how many survs drop pallets and then tbag for ten seconds. It really turns your frown upside down then sticks it right in their fucking ass.
---
true story for the Oni was fun now is unfun thanks BHVR
---
Upvoted cuz this is somewhat accurate. On my totally unbias view anyway. :)
---
He's devour hope, shadowborn, botany knowledge and borrowed time
---
Margarita gens pumping out their best. Leatherface making some badass bbq and chili with the hillbilly's help. Sounds like a great 4th of July.
---
I’d say as long as moris are in the game skeleton keys can be too, it’s like a survivor mori, ends the game quick
---
Ok, but that's not what viable means. When people say viable they mean a good choice competetively. It's great you're happy to play those killers, but that doesn't change that they could use some love.
---
What happened to the oni and when? I am not aware of the nerf.
---
Ds is supposed to be anti tunnel, but people often use it for momentary protection (doing gens in front of the killer, bodyblocking without worry, etc)
---
I wouldnt call it toxic, but its definitely annoying.
---
🤤
---
Imagine doing the gen in the middle of the map of the hospital. You dont know where that mf is coming from
---
Wow you play this game deaf? I'm interested how you go, what build do you run? That's really awesome
---
So they’re taking away his static field and replacing it as an add on?
---
Now that's a clever way to use that perk.
---
It's still cutting the game short. And I literally  said moris aren't ok either
---
Good survivors dont need d strike / exhaustion perks but i bet you'll see it 9 out of 10 matches.
---
Need is a dumb argument anyway nothing in this game is needed.
---
Frankly, I still have trouble finding matches. It usually takes around 10-15 mins to find a match, so better match ups would be my preferred experience. Plus 
---
Quality/Quantity
---
You dont always have line of sight of everything. There are walls and shit

And then the killer has Spirit Fury and you go down. :(
---
Started playing survivor recently, no insults on my profile from killers I faced and no toxicity against me. Though if I play killer I get told to kill myself and insults on my profile 24/7 by playing the game. No moris, NOED etc just having fun and I get toxicity. I'm playing a lot more survivor now because of it :/ I like being the power role and not relying on teammates but its just ridiculous the toxicity you face when playing killer..
---
Idk dude remove both I guess
---
Giv
---
Sounds fun haha, my brother used to main him and I’ve witnessed him fuck over a toxic survivor many times lol.
---
***shoulder touch***
---
Hey. Wanna feel this cool knife go up your stomach?
---
They removed the flick from his demon strike attack. Before you could rotate 180 degrees which was a bit ridiculous but they nerfed it so hard you can barely surpass 20.
---
So glad you are having a good time with Hag! I just love playing as her :) She can do so many fun and effective things as a killer. Keep it up!
---
Oh yeah 100% I play both sides so I see both points of view. Unfortunately sometimes the timer does need to be as long as it is because some killer's are just super determined for the tunnel
---
dead hard is genuinely almost useless if you know they have it/bait them using it
---
But you completed the challenge. Die before the killer DC's
---
If you got a salty survivor trash talking you, here the steps to follow: (PS4 and Xbox One only) 
---
1) Download a facts or joke app
---
2) Copy and send it to the person trash talking you
---
3) Keep sending facts and jokes until they rage and block you
---
4) Profit!
---
Besides my 3-hit down idea (that you obviously don't like), how do you feel about some of my other ideas?
---
Spine chill has never said that it helped with vault speed in the 2 years I’ve played
---
but it always has given the 6% bonus to it
---
Oni is a Hillbilly copy-and-paste that absorbs blood to use his power, but his power has better control, easier turning, and he can track you if you don't heal. There's nothing fun about that.
---
We don't know yet.
---
His static field is gone and I'm trying to guess if his second red add on will give it back to him.
---
If it does come back as an add on it might be a bit op considering that he not only doesn't have treatment mode anymore and has a static blast that instant ups a madness level having all 3 may be too strong.
---
She blocked him from running
---
I think just reducing the time to remove them would be enough. At the moment you can usually run to all the boxes with maybe a slight detour and still get it off on the last one. You should basically not have enough time to attempt all boxes. Most pigs tend to leave  trapped survivors alone if there is another target available. It would result in more trap deaths but not feel too unfair. A survivor should need to plot their route wisely to check boxes.
---
Or give her an add-on that increases the likelihood of the box furthest away from the trapped survivor being the correct one as that would ensure they work more reliable as a stalling mechanic if the devs prefer to keep their lethality low.
---
still learning I am still saying that a perk that would help new players too much would be bad like again noed new players cling to it too much it is bad for learning
---
Ymmmm hl2 explosion barrels.
---
the last nerf they did to him they took the turning he had on console which was fucking shit and put it on pc where it was fucking okay so now u cant do shit about 90 degree walls ur a shit billy that can only punish people walking straight it is fucking stupid
---
So treatment mode is built in now? That’s a nice change, but do we know exactly how his power changes overall?
---
I respect no pallet. Fuck your pallets anyway even without enduring gang
---
Loud noise mean killer close. Quiet noise mean killer further away
---
this game isnt competitively viable to being with
---
I'm saying to use one of the pre existing perks. Not add in a new perk for the purpose of giving new players the directional location of the killer
---
Well yes, yeah okay. Challenge complete.
---
I have all 4 levels done. That challenge were you need to kill 4 survivors in the basement in a single trial was such BS. They need to think more about these challenges...
---
Do you know when is the Tome II coming out?
---
Jeez... I am so sorry you have to go through that :(( I feel awful for complaining now. I don’t blame you for wanted to switch to survivor. What do you play on?
---
JuSt_InSaN3lOvE
---
*piano intensifies*
---
Ha, she’s getting shoulder touched!
---
It's not easy.. Let me just say that. Haha.. As OP stated, i ALWAYS have a perk that gives me some sort of killer location intel. Usually empathy because it covers the entire map and gives (in my opinion) the most accurate read on the killer. Your buddy gets hit, you know where he's at immediately. Other than that, I usually run self care with urban evasion and borrowed time (sometimes wglf if I need the blood points.)
---
How much spare time do u have my guy? Are you the fastest hand in the west?
---
I’ve seen all five gens done in 3 minutes.
---
https://youtu.be/hxkk5sH6zRI
---
loud noise means killer could be coming from any direction. having a perk to assist means killer is coming from THAT direction when loud noise is happening
---
I recognize your voice? Do you have a twitch by any chance?
---
Same. I play survivor all the time and never have I ever received a message like that 😂
---
i wouldn't say it's*definitely* not a good idea, but you're right, it would take a whole lot of work and honestly probably way more than it's worth.
---
the game is balanced (whether well or not is a separate issue) around a specific scenario, and any changes to that would throw everything wildly off. there's ways to simplify the issue, but the issue still exists. and that's just purely mechanics, player attitudes are a whole other thing. the meme potential is high, but so is the potential for toxicity, salt, and just generally bringing things down for everyone else
---
honestly the amount of work it would take on bhvr's part could well make a whole new game now that i think about it
---
The burns I get sometimes say “possibly” but that might be because I’m stupid.
---
Treatment Mode is gone amd some of his add ons will give survivors reverse skill check's and also increase his TR if his static blast is ready to use.
---
Also I'm not sure if this is true or not but one upgrade madness is getting is that survivors at level 3 madness can't repair drop pallets heal or Vault the latter is a big upgrade.
---
Probably next month or the one after
---
Killers aren’t OP, survivors just suck.
---
The devs should be getting balance input from people who play at the top level, not people who think Clown is OP and can’t loop for shit.
---
I was about to be somewhat mean and say that Trapper was a potato. But then I noticed this is console gameplay... humm.
---
Nice spins dude.
---
PC. Its honestly awful playing killer and it really just makes the game stressful for no reason. Wanted to get to rank 1 by the end of the year (rank 6) but its so toxic it really ruins the fun. I like being facecamped/tunneled more than the number of insults I received. There's also the fact that survivor is a lot more relaxed and you don't have to be on the lookout 24/7. Queue times are so quick on killer because no one wants to play killer lol.
---
Omg I thought this was gonna be bad by that sounds great
---
Doesn’t matter. The input about balance should be from the best players. Not the mediocre.
---
999999999iq
---
have you guys played nurse post rework? She plays absolutely the same for anyone who was good with her so either you're just shit and don't know how to play her or you haven't played her post nerf
---
Oh no :(
---
It will also make him more cancerous and obnoxious to play against.
---
Still not what viable means, but ok
---
This is the equivalent of saying “Good survivors don’t need Decisive Strike”
---
Well yes, it’ll be a doctor resurgence really
---
Pull her shirt down a bit ;)
---
Seems like you've never played against the "Michael Myers copy-pasted buff" GhostFace...
---
If when you walk and noise get louder, that mean killer in that direction
---
I try to get generators done while avoiding the killer.
---
I'm not great at chases so I try to avoid them
---
Better to deal with a strong annoying killer than a weak annoying killer I say.
---
Of course
---
Wow. The game must be a lot scarier if you can't hear the killer coming. It's really cool you play the game like that
---
You on PS4?
---
I don't care if he has a feather duster as his weapon he had so many bugs exploited that I'm not taking any more risks by playing against him. Infinite mending was stupidly used by a lot of players that I left the game tell it got fixed
---
Iron Maiden....im so sorry
---
loud noise happens. Baby meg tries to hide behind a rock and it turns out killer was coming from the other direction
---
&gt; is there a way we can make something like this get more attention?
---
Give Behaviour a way to monitise it.
---
It wasn't necessarily the addons themselves it was the addons plus a choice of 3 or 4 of ruin, pop, thana, corrupt, and dying light
---
I dont agree with the guy, but calling someone a survivor main because they have a different opinion is ridiculous.
---
Played against both. Never said Ghostface was fun to play against.
---
What're the new changes?
---
The stats don't correlate with nurse because nurse takes skill and time to learn, but once learned you can pretty much never lose even against the infamous 4 man 4 commodious bnp prove thyself gen builds
---
I’m so sorry dweet
---
Are you magically not supposed to be able to win against them?
---
This killer ignores the usual chase strategy and can move around the map at high speed. High level players are near impossible to escape when they use this killer.
---
This killer run fast and hit weaker.
---
A good nurse will fake where they're looking so survivors don't know so you REALLY haven't gone against good nurses
---
Billy has remained consistently a top tiered killer since release primarily due to his map pressure. His chainsaw down is less reliable on some loops, but as long as you learn how to steer him he becomes very useful at quick killer games and he requires less skill than nurse, but more than spirit. It's worth learning to play him.
---
Baby Meg learns a lesson and gets better at the game.
---
Again we do not have the luxury of baby meg growing old. That happens at her own pace
---
I wonder if this is what will happen if I never boop the snoot
---
Ok, so now we have two problems. Pointing out that the problem is twice as bad as what OP posted doesn't mean the devs don't need to look at it. What OP should do is make an official forum post about it so the devs community managers hear his feedback, though I have seen them from time to time on here it's very rare this this forum is unofficial.
---
It really does ruin it. And then there are people saying “get over it”, “it doesn’t affect gameplay”, “it’s not a big deal”, etc which is entirely not true. If it makes it not fun for you, then yes it really does affect gameplay and it’s not that simple to “get over”. Sounds melodramatic but if the game isn’t fun anymore, why would you play it? Instead of quitting, I just found survivor to be the fun I wanted in the game. So do what you need to do to have your fun with the game, whether it be switch survivor or whatever :) I just don’t understand why people don’t get that everyone has a different playing style and not everyone has the patience to sit through the nasty comments or the toxicity
---
Yeah actually
---
This Reddit likes to say they get those teams every other game and that they're impossible to beat imo I can beat them with Billy 70% of the time
---
How is it fun to have a perk that doesn’t work
---
you might even want to use spin chill. If the perk lights up for like more than 3 seconds you know hes right on you
---
Majority of games would result in backfiring hook rescues resulting in a pip. Not all of them, just a majority.
---
How do you do this i can't copy it :&lt;
---
If you think you are more capable of being funny then make your own content and if you dislike this group then make a new group a lot of games and fandoms have like 1-10 different groups
---
Just picture me 2:01 simple things okay no problem yang swaybee and never forget the FONZ that’s why 2 am is so funny I was ready to roll that beautiful let’s just say... lol it’s. Not all bad it’s been a wild rift . it’s okay if it’s not actually easy enough for a summer to be ice cold but bot lane here come admiral hopefully he can play mobas duder lol
---
Nerf moris while your at it.
---
Well that's how being new to a game works.
---
"country snacks" incredible
---
I've always preferred it to balance Landing because it's not map dependent and is a deadly combo with quick and quiet plus dance with me.
---
Balanced Landing can't be used on half the maps depending on your RNG and you can accidentally use it all the time.
---
They're literally all running urban evasion, self care, spine chill, premonition, etc. Did they just hide the whole game and do gens?
---
So how is it a problem that Nurse can beat them lol
---
You are aware coldwin maps have the highest survival rates right?
---
You and me both, dude. The Shining is my all-time favorite movie and having him in the game with an Overlook map would be the greatest thing ever.
---
A good nurse will beat them 100% of the time, a good spirit will only beat them 85-90% of the time
---
In what way
---
Running the mediocre killer build eh
---
They did mention a Legion "rework"?
---
I am still not sure, but was the last nerf considered THAT REWORK? Or was this just some band-aid patching, unrelated to the incoming rework?
---
Legion feels a bit simple but it fine but the second idea for pig doesn't feel like it enough pressure since the original one puts a bit much force into the game so they don't have to worry about dying in the game
---
You can be matched against people within 6 ranks of you so nothing

---
It’s so bizarre. It’s completely turned me off from buying any customization for survivors since the wait times are so god awful that I won’t even be in a match to show it off
---
The game is just so stressful as killer because 1 mistake and you lose. As a survivor you have 3 chances, DS, Dead hard, adrenaline, borrowed, unbreakable, keys and all those give you so much chances its really not as scary to make a mistake than as a killer. But really some insults I've gotten were pretty harsh and as I've said I get told to kill myself pretty often im my games because someone didn't like how I play (I have a priority on who to kill, usually I get the injured player or the person dead on hook as a priority to get them out soon, no camping though. Its not viable imo). Players run infront of me expecting me not to hit and get pissed at it. And when I lose (0-1 kill) I get teabagged and flashlight spammed and its honestly what triggers me the most. I already lost just leave and don't be a bitch. I get why some say "but its just a game get over it" but it really gets in your head after a while. I really started to play survivor because its easy as shit and I can play with friends and even if I lose I have a lot of fun. Its sad that I feel like I wasted about 500 hours on killer (mainly in the menus because I don't even want to start a game because I get stressed out during a game). I guess it makes me good at predicting where the killer might go lol.
---
Legion?
---
What is your opinion on jesuses
---
rank 17-20 is the best. when will ppl learn theres no point to 'winning' and ranking up? the point should be to have fun, yourself and others included, and make max bps
---
*heavy breathing*
---
I want it to play dbd with it from my couch lol. But I hate normal stick aim with controllers. I think the mobile version uses the gyro sensor, but it's too laggy on my phone
---
Maybe someone can answer if it's at least possible to use motion controls on the switch version like in splatoon. But I don't really want to buy it a second time, hence asking for pc compatibility
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
no such thing as abusing flashlights or pallets.
---
i can't believe i already forgot about my new favourite character
---
No she won’t lol.
---
Yeah, I completely agree with that. I plan on ranking up once I get my builds together and don’t need bp anymore. Until then, I’m just having hella fun.
---
" Yes, god nurses will kill you. However, there are still nurses that will absolutely get destroyed by survivors if they don’t know how to blink."
---
Just like you were never catching god survivors when the game was more survivor sided, even though the bad survivors still got caught, The fact that you are skilled enough shouldnt let you win 99% of the matches you play against a opponent with the same skill level.
---
Even when they do that I can still escape against most Nurses. When you get used to Nurses, you can tell how far they'll actually blink.
---
With the recent buffs Empathy is a great perk that gives you so much free information without needing to stop working on whatever you're doing. Doing gens? Now you know which way the killer is headed after hooks and if they trap it, and if you have any teammates going to save. Getting hooked? Now your team knows if and where traps are and which way the killer went
---
Using a perk is never toxic. It exists to be used
---
Yeah legion is simple but I feel like it would make him more powerful. People mend the second you leave and their right back to work so being broken will help I think. With the pig i think it helps because let’s say you get a 60 second timer and have to search 3 of the jigsaw boxes and it takes roughly 12 seconds to search them. So you have plenty of time to prevent your death but you have to do it quickly. (If the pig is chasing you the timer will be paused) so that’s a long time for someone not to be doing anything. Plus if they go down it can screw other people over cause there maybe multiple people who need saving or help. I think it could create a lot of pressure.
---
I thought this was a small streamer guess I won’t be watching this any time soon
---
invisible man confirmed for dbd
---
If you've ever watched Zubat play nurse...
---
Teabagging at pallets and clicking flashlights is abuse, yeah.  You’re specifically trying to rub salt in the killer’s wounds.
---
BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED 
---
1. so cannibal has BBQ
---
2. nurse for nurse's calling
---
3. hag for ruin
---
Insta heals were broken, keys are ridiculously dumb, god loops still exist in this game, flashlights were too strong but rn are in a balanced spot. Insta flashlights removed any skill in flashlight saves and same when you could get stunned regardless of the animation. Moris should really be killed if keys get killed too though
---
Then your fine those are the perks everyone has
---
Nah, Huntress and Trapper
---
Nurse can rip holes through spacetime and appear on the other end of a small wormhole instantly.
---
Spirit can enter an ethereal plane and transverse it extremely fast.
---
Hag can place doubles of herself and teleport to them instantly.
---
Clown: BOOTLES
---
rank 13 killer myself and get rank 2 4 man swf...this is why I main survivor
---
I do more than just fine in both. Still hate getting nothing but killer dailies.
---
Most players in this game (even at high ranks) are shit now, most veteran players (2+ years or 1000+ hours) have left because the game is going in a shit direction with balance on both sides. Nurse is garbage if you're a shit killer so 99% of the nurses playing this game are hot trash
---
Abuse as in repeatedly doing something that is broken? Its toxic not abusing a item.
---
Yup same here I just stick to survivor mostly
---
Me too, and it’s always killers I hate playing too lol
---
It's so stupid that a single outfit costs $10
---
Neither am I but I’d have to agree, it’s disheartening to die constantly when I first stared so once I got self care, I was able to stay in the game much longer and actually play. Then I got better and I still run it, that or inner strength
---
whoops replied to the post instead of your comment but *holy shit*
---
Did you actually make this though cause I know I seen this posted almost a year ago now.

New (slow and insidious) killer: The Overconfidence
---
Oni is fun as hell to play against. Would rather have him than Plague, Michael, Clown and Ghostface any day honestly. As Oni stands he's a worse Billy that needs to charge his chainsaw and can only use it for a minute and needs to recharge it again. Might have better controls/turning but its useless most of the time since you can't always use it. Also, who cares about the tracking on his power? Its got such a small range and seeing orbs there doesnt mean they're anywhere near there anymore. He's one scary bitch to play against and that's fun. Also, if you think his power is so strong, stop greeding against him and drop that damn pallet, he can't get his power (or ridiculously slowly) if he doesn't get the first hit in
---
Mmm long pig
---
Jump scares, aplenty! And never let your disability define you, bud! I'm by no means top tier, but I get by.. And have fun doing it! 👍
---
"We hear you loud and clear. Thanks to your feedback Feral Frenzy will no longer apply deep wounds and instead instantly complete a generator when hitting a survivor. See you in the fog" -BHVR probably
---
She’ll win sometimes. Not all the time
---
Well I mean, it's not exactly a lie.
---
I do wish there was some kind of VISUAL terror radius though, for hearing impaired people. Although I obviously realize that it could be easily exploited by people that don't ACTUALLY need it, unfortunately.
---
Nice way to censor their names and all, never seen like this before
---
but why like this?
---
Well, it's shit if at zero stacks but 5 stacks and ruin still up makes life difficult for survivors who aren't proficient in hitting skill checks. I had no issues using it on her.
---
I've tried them all. Everything from Bond to Premonition, the latter not being much help considering it's an audio cue.. Haha. I prefer the aura perks because like I said before, it's almost an instant UAV on the killer. Plus I'm a decent looper so half the time I'll just run right at em and hope my team does gens. 😂
---
Never mind then lol. Have been going up against nothing but purple ranks at Rank 13\12
---
smh this whole thread and not one "what what in the butt" joke
---
I find lithe useful for helping to get away when you are stuck at a shitty loop
---
I also personally like it a lot because I feel like I can use lithe to actively lose the killer. If I lithe over a window with a good wall to block line of sight, I can regularly find myself successfully hiding. Other exhaustion perks don't really let you lose the killer, they just extend the chase
---
i have every character at p3 so unless you mean being able to select specifically where each character goes this wont make a diff to me but i guess it could be useful for ppl
---
MYC and monitor and abuse are great on her, too! Also, the dark skin for stealthy hag is great. She’s definitely my favorite killer to play atm :D
---
Same thing has been happening to me. Red ranks against green killers
---
Im a survivor main and I didn't realize this was a thing xD
---
It could work. Maybe just have a little indicator that lights up the closer you are to the killer.
---
Speaking of which, have you considered using Stake Out? It won't tell you how close they are, but you'll at least have a visual indicator for when you're inside the TR.
---
They want to rush the generators asap to escape the fastest they can (kinda the goal of doing the objective lul)
---
Really?
---
im too lazy to even crop it out
---
the odds of wiggling free are so fucking slim at that point, and even if i do the odds of *escaping* are even slimmer. i might as well just not and see what happens
---
Fair  enough
---
It's been like this since last update. The killer still did pre okay but I felt it was unfair towards them.
---
Lots of people throwing information at you, like MYC Dark Devotion being super but imo one of the best is Monitor and Abuse. MnA drops your TR to 16 meters. Allowing you to get very close to people.
---
Highly recommend investing those into Cannibal. He really struggles as a killer so levelling him is hard and his teachable BBQ and Chili is not only powerful, but very good for BP grinding as well. His other perks aren't bad either.
---
After that, Hag for Ruin and then whichever killers have perks that suite your playstyle best.
---
This but when you hear Myers tier up and you're on a 4 man gen
---
Just make a discord server?
---
It's amazing how little awareness survivors can have sometimes. I've had games where I go out of my way to not tunnel and hook people evenly and someone will still find a way to complain.
---
Well sometimes training wheels are the way to go. Its not really hurting them in the long run. Just speeding up their progression
---
Was this the borrowed time nerf or is it sum new nerf?
---
What YouTuber do you recommend me best for killers build?
---
Wow, she's gorgeous. Amazing work!
---
Same can be said about ttv killers getting 4ks consistently tho
---
No one wants to see sabo builds come back. They're REALLY unfun. Imagine if killers could disable gens for 1m30 if they went on one for 15 seconds. Disabling the opponents objective is just shit gameplay. Predator would be fun. WGLF would just become a better babysitter. Its fine as is as its honestly so easy to stack lol. Maybe let you see gens around you or something like that if anything
---
For pc? If so any decent hyperx or any gaming headset works well. I've been using hyperx for a few years now, works really well for games and music.
---
I cant with this one, i got hook 4 in basement in 3 tries, this one is hell
---
I will have to level up my Tapp and give this one a shot. Never tested this too much. I'm not sure if you're familiar with a game called "Identity V" but it's basically a cartoony mobile rip off of DBD. Anyway, in that game.. When the killer gets close to you, you can actually SEE your character's heart beating. It's a bit over the top, obviously, with the cartoony style but in the DBD art style, something like this could work.. And wouldn't really give MUCH of an advantage to anybody that can already hear the heartbeat, anyway.. So long as they work in conjunction with one another.
---
I've found Not Otzdarva to be a pretty great resource. He has a big focus on teaching and explaining his choices as a killer player.
---
Tru3Talant is also good, but his builds are more tailored to his playstyle which could be harder to use as a new player.
---
Yeah which is right after the bloodhunt which will take place January 2-6
---
Bro, how come you didn't get Hex: Ruin?
---
To slow the game down... *Just a little bit.*
---
Talk about you. I have not played survivor since November and I only get survivor, and mostly survivor specific daylies. E.g repair a total of 3 generators as ______.
---
I only play killer, why I'm getting survivor rituals?
---
Nurse still viable
---
It’s sad how common this is
---
It’s Tergion then!
---
Laughs in level 1 Spirit Fury.
---
It was meant to be a shitpost comment dude, not a serious comment
---
That's the most common response to the colorblind complaint and it's annoying.
---
That's right, I remember that game. That is a great way to implement it.
---
If you ever come across me, that'll never happen. The second those gates can be open, I'm gone. I have no idea why some survivors waste their and the killer's time.
---
Killers DCing gives safety pip and stops the game, a survivor DCing fucks everyone (points, killer pipping and survivor chances from escaping) over and ruins the whole game for the next 10-15 minutes. Now tell me, which is worse? Going into another game or staying in an unwinnable game for 15 mins to requeue after?
---
It happens once in a blue moon.
---
Get over it.
---
The white dot in the slots under your rank if you hover over it
---
I don’t think you know what shit posting is
---
Maybe
---
And Vindicators as Huntress. (Probably will want to edit the sounds though, or it might be a bit weird)
---
I think it’s bc most killers and survivors dc from the loading screen or when in game I think that messes up the servers where ass for killers it’s only 1 instead of 4 idk server loading times have been like this since launch I truly hope they end up fixing it😔
---
I just had a game where the rest of my team was being super altruistic against a legion with good perks.
---
We managed to bang out 4 gens, but last teammate got sacrificed and killer found hatch first with both exit gates on the same side of the long autohaven map.
---
I decided I'd try one of the doors and see how long I could hold it before the killer came and killed me. To my surprise, they actually let me finish it before downing me. Then, surprised me again when they carried me to the exit gate.
---
I'm not sure why but it really touched me for them to let me go after trying to come back from a poor start.
---
How did they hold you hostage?
---
Whatever you say boss take your ego and go elsewhere it wasn’t meant to be serious get over yourself

*Rank 1 killers* You could've beaten them!
---
How was that response ego? Seems like yours is getting hurt for no reason
---
Not going to lie, when this happens and I am playing Huntress, I let the other person get up.
---
I usually pick Iron Will just because Spirit protection and it was good even before Shattered Bloodlines. 
---
It's really great if you don't waste your Lithe. Don't want to be in a chase anymore? Just vault a window out of sight from the killer and you can be practically anywhere as far as he knows.
---
Mmm yes because you clearly don't safety pip anyway because 2 people dcd. Also, I slug for the 4k because of how dumb hatch is and that if I don't do it with 2 dcs I have no way to even safety pip. So yeah I'll slug
---
Nah, I’m tired of entitled players  jumping someone when they make a comment
---
To answer your title, probably. To answer your post, yes.
---
Ohh, they still are. I'm a new player, and i'm playing trapper. They're all running flashlights, blocking hooks, speed healing, and not doing any gens anymore even though it's very clear i'm unable to deal with their shit.
---
She’s not gonna give you coochie bro
---
just happy that people constantly always play the game :)
---
Wait, how is Demo throwing a projectile?
---
Thot is the only reaction I have lul
---
Have you tried playing killer on? It's awful, and recently mming will put you with red ranks, who are way better than you and will do their best to make your experience as miserable as possible.
---
I've actually stopped playing survivor because I'm tired of unintentionally bullying killers 6+ ranks below me.
---
If only the devs would release some decent accessibility options.. Until then, I'll be running a radar perk, 100% of the time. Haha. I realize that I'm the minority, but I still love this game and want to be able to play it more efficiently. Getting snatched off of gens is starting to give me nightmares! 😂
---
If they can do it tastefully that would be awesome. I don't know anything about Native American culture though so I have no ideas
---
I always hear Monto in his vids with Puppers and No0b3 that you can hear his breathing and the crackle of lit totems. I hear the totems but I’ve never heard Michael breath before. Is it really low because my game volume is at 100% so idk
---
Well that needs to get put near the top of the very long list of necessary fixes. 
---
They added an interrupt animation for when you're working on a generator that becomes blocked. They could just use that animation for Any Means Necessary cancel from vault.
---
This is the definition of over saturated content.
---
Killers really act like a single pallet stun will send them to the shadow realm.
---
Use a different perks to slow the game down?
---
High ranked survivors can churn through gens pretty quickly even without toolboxes. Is it really all that bad to have a killer's add ons that slowed it down to rank 12 levels? As for it being boring: it is not fun for a killer to down a survivor after a minute long chase and have 3 gens pop by the time they are on the hook and a fourth ready to pop by the time you get to them. Forever Freddy was not really that much of a juggernaut at the red ranks. Not every killer plays purple or green.
---
Ouch sorry :(
---
That's a rough new experience. They're probably a lot more experienced so don't feel too bad. If you're still playing right now, try facing a wall when you pick up a survivor, that way they can't stand in front of you and blind you. Also if they try blinding you while you're walking, flick your camera up and it won't work. Go get em!
---
I’m a killer at red ranks as well and I don’t think slower gen speed is something we need at all. There are a lot of problems with the game that need to be addressed on both sides with little to no counter. Survivor popping gens you can counter in some ways. Use different perks or master the killers with the best map pressure.
---
Yeah Gen repair time should be increased significantly. When it takes a veteran to stand a chance without ruin something needs to be changed.
---
Gens should take two and a half minutes solo and every new person adds 75% repair speed. 
---
Also kicking a gen should regress it like 5% and the regression speed should be a little faster
---
But the e-peen though. But seriously, whilst you are right that rank doesn't give you anything, I can understand why so many people, including myself, think about it too much/obsess about it. I mean, you'd always want to be "number 1" instead of just a "random nobody" and at least if you're the highest rank, you are someone, not just a "shitter". I'm guessing that is the branch for all people who ranked anxiety in games etc.
---
Not a bug. Was doable a while ago and they added it back in afaik
---
That went from 2 to 20 REAL quick
---
they finally did the last gen, and i just opened the gate to force the game to end. that's enough dbd for today, i guess. :)
---
I don’t think people will care, I think they would just rather have some communication during the match.
---
Base Joey? You mean the Legion character? One of his costumes can be gotten with shards
---
All three.
---
MMMMMM
---
Exactly. The only time I’ll wait in the exit gate is to see if my team is getting out too or if I’ll have to go back in, but if I know I don’t need to stay, I’m gone
---
I'm sorry friend. I'm not a great player, but I could give you some tips or help if you'd like. I play on PC
---
They were supposed to have fixed that addon with the release of Oni, but apparently it's still bugged. I haven't tried to use it myself or seen anyone else try to use it.
---
Or add other objectives so that the gameplay doesn't revolve around holding left click and sometime pressing space?
---
If it’s not a holding left click simulator it’s not dead by daylight
---
Hyper x cloud 2 or hyper x cloud alpha I highly recommend. Been using them for years.
---
Hyper x drivers are built in a special way to not clump up all the sounds: [This](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2017/09/HyperX-Cloud-Alpha-Dual-Chamber-Driver.png)
---
It'll be less saturated when it's no longer a problem.
---
OOF. Look at that blue berry pie
---
If you play on PS4, you could know at least one person that isn't a mean player; I play killer and survivor but only play survivor because killer is a pain sometimes.
---
Implying they need nerfs. Anything remotely solid gets shattered.
---
nah, i play PC. i've had quite a few hard games, and i don't mind fucking up because i'm new and suck, but this was just on a completely new level. They did the last-moment switch to 4 flashlight claudettes as well, so it was definitely planned.
---
I don't know what it's like for rank &lt;5  killers but killer wait times are almost zero.  The problem now is unbalanced matchmaking.
---
Will it be less against the sub's rules when it's less frequent?
---
My favorite survivor is anyone who brings selfcare, bonus points if they still take time to heal themselves if I have sloppy.
---
My second favorite survivor are people that camp pallets then dc when I end up hitting them anyways.
---
Overdue for a Male? Are you forgetting Steve from ST?
---
\*Heavy Stalk Breathing\*
---
There's a kind of white affect that happens on the edges of your screen before you enter the fatigue state. You can use that to get a pretty accurate guess to how long you can charge your second blink. With the new changes make sure your second blink is actually available. If you can't see a number 2 next to your power in the bottom left then you'll only be able to blink once.
---
That rule is entirely subjective and since I haven't seen any posts like these get taken down... I guess it isn't against the rules.
---
A week? He was nerfed in PTB even, it's like kicking the baby before it's out of the womb.
---
I know it doesn’t mean much on console but I was proud I actually 360’d
---
Move the thumb sticks in opposite directions while sprinting
---
Nobody is commenting on your pun, so I just thought I'd say well done.
---
Indeed
---
Search on YouTube, I’ve been using it to try and do 360s for months but hey I finally did it
---
What the fuck i'm staring at him why isnt he exposed
---
Recently got into the game and am liking ohtofu on twitch.  Seems very positive and doesnt complain much like some others ive watched time to time even before dbd (hexy)
---
If the law isn't enforced then it's not a law is very poor logic. These posts are getting taken down daily.
---
Every single one I've reported has been taken down so let's see what happens with this one.
---
&gt;Some of the Pig nerfs I can understand
---
*cries in oink* Why??? Since when has Pig EVER been on top?
---
2521. The more dangerous ones are 3999 (can literally destroy reality) and 2317 (end of the universe). Those two cannot be contained. There's another one which is 169 which is a leviathan. These that cannot be contained and (most likely) will destroy the world are called Apollyon class. I would love to see an SCP in DBD (049?)
---
Now replace the knife with a bottle of Windex and put C L E A N as the title
---
L     E     A     N
---
I wouldn't mind if there was some buff to kicking gens. I'd hate to see them simply increase gen speed since it is boring enough already. Also good counters to gen speed are, perks, slugging, or defending 3 close gens.
---
Is he a good nurse? I never seen him play Nurse, it would make sense if he was a nurse main though as he is really bad at every other killer in the game. Thankfully I watch him for entertainment and not to learn how to play killer better. Lol
---
That being said, Marth is probably the best nurse that streamed, I think he quit the game again though. There is also Zubat which is just good at everything, and OhTofu which is a meh nurse player but still knocks the majority of other nurse players out of the water.
---
Yeah tofu is chill. Ohm on youtube is probably one of the most chill non toxic killers as well.  Hexy from what i’ve heard is just toxic af and a complete nightmare.
---
I'm doing this RN
---
fuit gumme
---
No
---
Rank 8 killer, can confirm wait times are almost zero. I am frequently paired with red ranks. At times there are a few Rank 18’s, but I just chalk that up to swf
---
Same for me
---
I can't wait. I look forward to BHVR doing nothing because "We were unaware the community had a problem." I'll just go ahead and report every fucking comment and post asking for more nerfs.
---
She was probably busy tunneling.
---
I genuinely couldn't believe she left. I was like yes we are getting out here then WTF....
---
Currently theres no point in kicking a gen unless you're going to chase survivors off of it. Unless you have pop goes or overcharge or some sorts
---
A lot of guides are from a couple years ago. I started earlier this year and a lot of them recommended Claudette for self care, dated 2017 or maybe early 2018.
---
Yeah, but the law is entirely subjective.
---
Recently no he hasn’t played nurse really at all.He used to play the nurse quite a bit and actually was not bad at all just occasionally would mess some blinks up.  
---
Thanks! Most streamers don’t really play nurse and the only time I ever see a god tier nurse is once in a while in my own games which I don’t get to enjoy lol. Which sucks because it’s fun to watch a good nurse game.
---
Yes I get the gen rushing, but there's no point in all 4 running leader and prove thy self.
---
They don't stack and if you're doing a gen solo they don't make a difference
---
Well, I mean, tons of players still think self-care is one of the best perks in the game. They will never make the connection that the reason they lose is because they waste too much time self-caring. It's always because of their team, or the killer downs them too quickly, or whatever. 
---
Even if they watch those Youtubers, they will hear this conflicting opinion, immediately think they don't know what they are talking about, and stop watching.

---
Did you just assume Steve's gender? :p
---
Yeah the whole mend thing is useless.
---
Imagine hitting a survivor then running away, they heal and then repeat.
---
His ability is a joke, that’s why he’s never used.
---
The mend process should have been taking into account more, they nerfed him with making the timer pause when in a chase but that only benefitted one side, not both.
---
The Deep wound is a joke which is why most streamers chase and knock the deep wounded survivor after the stun (which is unnecessary with how his ability works) because you aren’t getting hooks but putting survivors in deep wound and the running to the next while in the time it takes you to hit the next survivor, the prior deep wounded survivor is already a third of the way healed.
---
It‘s not like you can see the arua of them either, a nice buff would to be able to see those who are mending or give the mending process harder skill checks(if there are any at all which I doubt) so a legion player knows where to go next, the killer is made so wrong.
---
The proof is that you never see that killer in a game, maybe a low 10% but that’s it.
---
*Welcome to DBD....* lmfao
---
No one really streams nurse because being good at nurse is apparently quite boring.
---
You sound dehydrated.
---
They dont stack, yes, but it won't give you your leader effect. Having 2 players on a gen both with leader ups the speed of both while only 1 leader buffs only one player, slowing the speed a bit
---
You sound like you have chromosomes to spare.
---
i'd definitely love to see a native american survivor, dbd is pretty diverse and i'd love to see them continue on in that way, but i'd be hesitant with a killer or anything more tied to their culture than the backstory just because a lot of the tropes there make a pretty shaky foundation in terms of offensiveness regardless of how well they'd want to do it
---
i think i'd feel similarly about an indian (or general south asian, assuming that's what you mean,) character, but i think the fact that asia does have its own horror industry would make it easier to do well and/or respectfully. i mean obviously i'm not expecting something super high brow and polished, but i still want them to try
---
double capacity isn't something to scoff at
---
I would think he would have a power where his arm extends out in a straight line like demogorgon lunge to hit survivors
---
A literally just bought that teo days ago wtf
---
Pick a top tier. If you're on PC, become a godlike Nurse and learn to just delete people... though it might be hard after the nerfs. Spirit, Freddy, and Hillbilly are also good. You need to pick a killer that is actually viable because even the best killer players play in a lackluster manner with clown. Pick meta killer perks and play survivor to figure out how they play.
---
Tappy glover more like fappy glover
---
I mean an Indian survivor wouldn't need to be with an Indian based killer they could be from other parts of the world, for example Adam Francis is actually Jamaican but lived in Japan before the entity took him.
---
Then why do streamers like Kittychops and Jendenise depip?
---
Native American here. I would not be offended. The lore would need to be on point if they would not want to offend any tribal leaders.
---
Maybe he starts the trial disguised as a different killer to confuse survivors and can shapeshift for some sort of bonus to play on the whole looking like your biggest fear thing. I don't know what they could do with it outside of that though.
---
'You were camping every hook' Nope. Your Dead Hard was predictable and you pull the plug on your death hook to save your rainbow map. Know the difference. GG [based on a true story]

---
As a trapper main 100% agree. I think just adding an ability base to reset traps would fix him/ help or give him a 2nd base trap to start off with
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
That sounds pretty cool! Would definitely need some extra stuff to work with that though
---
They could add just a native American survivor on their own and the killer could be from like Sweden or Australia for example, survivors don't need to match where a killer is from do they?
---
My brain at 1:30 AM
---
Not at all. Could be from completely different periods in time also.
---
The things Oni has going for him are not as good as the things Billy has going for him, IMO
---
It is really easy to juke Oni until his power goes away. You can't play those games with Billy as much, because his power is always up.
---
I have a HARDER time controller Oni myself. And his dash takes forever to charge. Even with his power FINALLY charged up, he doesn't feel as dangerous to me as Billy.
---
Billy is an easy 4k in red ranks for me. Like, recline in my seat and drink coffee while barely trying 4k. Oni is a struggle, and I rarely get 4k's with him. He isn't very fun to control either. It was grueling just having to play him to get my achievements back up to 100%. Now I won't ever play him again unless a daily calls for it.
---
he is the projectile and his hands have a width to them that isn’t directly in front of him.
---
If they were to add they need to be incredibly careful on how they add it. Colourblind colours are one thing. Sound is such a major thing in dead by daylight in tracking survivors, if they happened to show the direction of where survivors were in terms of sound, that would practically make flashlights and immersion 100% useless.
---
This. Currently kicking a gen does little to nothing since an immersed survivor can simply just run up and tap the gen as soon as the killer leaves it. Hell, this is so bad you can even tap the gen *during a chase*.
---
gotcha
---
i mean like i said, i'd love for them to add even more diversity to the game. i just think it's cool to have all these people from different cultures and backgrounds and whatnot even if it has zero impact on the actual game. (probably at least a little because of that too)
---
Hmm true
---
I mean me too man I really hope that FOZZIE bear picks up the game
---
The Legion gives people a second objective through healing and we all know how well that goes down.
---
sksksksksk the sheer embarrassment im surprised she didn't dc
---
Legion isn't even that bad.
---
I always interpreted Jake Park as native American, or native-and-Korean American
---
So true. They can't handle loosing.
---
That fact that you said “that bad” proves my entire point.
---
It's C tier at BEST. Take a shot every time a meme starts with the word "when"
---
It costs 7200 shards for each piece.
---
If you just want the body thats fine, but I think most people want the mask also, so 14400 shards for base Joey is around one killer and a devotion level
---
You know something's wrong when you hate playing killer so much because it's unfair in certain situations you literally convert to the opposite team which I find is actually easier
---
That's some horror movie shit
---
I used to think this was standard until I started buying TF2 cosmetics. Save your money and buy a new game
---
The legion one isnt a rework, and it really doesnt effect anything since no one heals against legion in the first place.
---
and the pig rework is needed and studiedly OP. People really dont understand just how much time the traps give you during a match. and havig those traps be infinite, would literally make it impossible for the survivors to win, added bonus if they are running gen slow down.
---
Its still holding down left click the whole time. Maybe make finding some stuff in the basement so that territorial could see some use, parts for a gen on the other side of the map like Freddy clocks, something other than just holding down left click the whole time. The RBT are a fun way to add a second objective (though they were nerfed to oblivion) and still make it fun
---
I think you mean
---
^WWWWAAAHHHHHHHHH
---
A killer truly made me smile this week.
---
Although it seems like it’s normal to killers help survivors out of pity or something, it’s not for me, it’s very rare to something like that happen to me so if my memory isn’t bad i think it was a ghostface, It was a good match and all the survivors managed to scape with good team work, anyways the killer ended up catching me while i was opening the exit door and instead of hooking me he picked me up and walked me off through the exit. Everyone found it funny.
---
btw i was a steve with scoops outfit idk in case the killer get to read this you’re awesome
---
The fact that people complain about DS but in the same breath think IRI heads are balanced baffles me
---
Imagine that, the post was removed. 
---
 Lmao you've got a problem with your 21st chromosome.
---
"oooh yea these ribs are so hot"
---
What would you suggest is a better way for them to advertise their stream?
---
Here's my criticism: this is hilarious and I'm so glad you made it
---
Yeah, its kinda obvious that this isnt an hitbox issue. The hitbox has just become such an meme around this game. Tought I should blame it on that.
---
Hagys are cute, she is a QT
---
Yes, i too, want to be sexually abused and penetrated by the Saw franchise character Amanda Young, also known as The Pig.
---
I don't understand your logic, since RBT still requires you to hold down left click and press space every once in a while. There isn't much that *won't* include that, outside of the time used to run around the map.
---
It’s incredibly frustrating to create a new account to play with my family and to have Rank 18 killers with Ruin T3, BBQ T3, Tanach T3 and NOED. It doesn’t make any sense to allow this when these survivors can’t even hit skill checks to begin with.
---
If we get this skin then we need to get Bruce Campbell dressed as Elvis

Trapper needs darkened traps and yellow bag as default, this wouldn't break him, it would just mean you can run some different freaking add ons lol.
---
Diesel Trapper, with the red paint or the black paint and skull mask
---
Edit: I'm actually putting my vote in for the Pig. She's not big, she's not imposing, but damnit if my stomach didn't sink the first time I saw her Pig mask silhouette gazing back at me. The sadism of what that mask represents is definitely the most intimidating to me

Atleast you don't stand still holding it and are pressured to do it or your head fucking pops. Legion's mend is put on so often and if the legion decides to chase you after hitting you with his power it won't go down since you run the whole time until he leaves you and back to mending. Having an RBT on your head gives you another objective (getting it off) while forcing you to move around the map quickly to find boxes to get it off without getting caught by the killer taking it off and its actually scary since you're out immediately if it pops. Legion is really annoying because of how many times he can use it on you and force you to mend tbh
---
He should have a cup of lean
---
it's dead by left click
---
I just played a game against Trapper, let’s just say I did the loopty loop around several tress to lose him. Kinda amusing
---
Trapper is one of those killers that NOED isn't even a crutch on, IMO.
---
Survivors get to break his traps for longer than it takes to repair all 5 generators with any toolbox, or the Saboteur perk, as well as detect with very lenient disarm prompts, as well as Small Game, and action speeds (Resilience, Spine Chill) work for escape attempt speed, and Slippery Meat works for escape chance.
---
And he basically has little-to-no power in the end game because good luck repositioning traps when gates only take 20 seconds to open, Trapper has to burn a perk slot (Corrupt Intervention) just to have an endgame at all.
---
And even with NOED (if the five totems haven't been broken) he still only moves 119% compared to Hillbilly's 230% instant-down and Nurse's 333% blink-hit, but they have powers to deny loops that can't be taken away in six different ways.
---
You finally went against a shit killer congrats
---
Why the fuck is Freddy F tier
---
Edit: and Hag in D? What even
---
I do this fucking too. I got hooked, three people on the other side of the map just sitting there doing gens while I sit on the hook, someone else gets hit, the other two continue doing gens, one of them finally breaks away after not only have I hit the second stage but I've almost died. He unhooks me, I'm already pissed but I need healed, he blows TWO skills checks on me so I run from him, I refuse to let me heal me more, I heal myself, and I refuse to do anything more to help them. I do gens and watch them die. We all eventually die and the Jake that did all of this is telling me how I'm not good at the game. Its just insane sometimes. I understand the stigma of SWF but its almost the only way you know you're not playing with fucking boosted apes.
---
Idk, it’s been a while since I’ve played one
---
K so how is using ds or getting the killer to bloodlust 3 toxic? Can some1 pls explain this to me
---
Edit: I now understand the direction of this post nvm heres an upvote srry

Also its a shame how wraith  purple addon

 "ALL SEEING" and "WINDSTORM" arent appart of his base kit

Huntress is top B tier

GF is A- tier

Trapper is top C tier/bottom B tier

Also tier list are banned
---
When (I’m new here)
---
Ok thank you
---
I play creatively! My favorite part is designing what I think constitutes a scary, intimidating Killer, by choosing my favorite cosmetics and picking perks that evoke a theme.
---
Then I test drive it, making sure to look out for survivors who I can tell are immersed and want to have a fun, exciting game. Part of my favorite aspect is also seeing how they make *their* builds. I try to be patient enough with confident/brave/cocky survivors, giving them the benefit of the doubt that that is their roleplay style
---
However, if I can tell a player is specifically going out of their way to taunt, tease or grief me, I just ignore it the best that I can by breathing, playing for fun and waiting it out until the end.
---
Honestly Killer is super difficult, especially with creative builds and current matchmaking, so I just really focus on the aspects I enjoy knowing I won't have perfect wins or perfect games. A few great chases with fun survivors, or a few perk strategies that work and pay off is usually enough
---
I enjoy the intense focus and drive of playing Killer, but it has taken real practice to grow a thick skin and let the trolling roll off my back. It's been worth it though because there are great interactions to be had with good natured, chill survivors
---
Daddy Glover has come to Tapp your cheeks
---
OK, but the steering on oni is **objectively** better, like in a numbers sense. Unlike hillbilly, oni can use the A and D keys to strafe *while* moving forward, literally allowing you to zig zag around obstacles with ease. 
---
I'm not sure what you mean about the Oni being easy to juke. If the Oni repeatedly spams demon dash, of course its easy to juke. But his demon strike, by definition, is not easy to juke. He moves at full speed while charging it (Unlike hillbilly) and it still gives him a speed boost at the end. Not to mention, if you only charge demon strike partially, it still acts as an instant down; which is **Objectively** better than billy; who charges his chainsaw at a slowed speed and has to charge it all the way.
---
The demon dash is for mobility, bouncing from target to target; or to help close distance on survivors. In a loop, you should **never** be using your demon dash, because (Like you said) it requires a full charge up (Unlike his Demon Strike) and; despite the fact that he has an increased turn rate from billy, it is hard to strike out of a dash if the survivor is smart and hides around corners.
---
But corners do jack shit against his demon strike. He has full aiming and moves full speed while raising his lunge, effectively being impossible to miss save for some sweet jukes.
---
No one is trying to say oni is better than billy, but to compare the two is unfair. They are both different takes on a similar principle, and they both have their merits.
---
It boils down to this, **hillbilly is better because he always has his ability**, but when his power is active, **Oni is objectively better in all respects.** it is all dependent on which you prefer. I like Oni's playstyle personally, but its just that; both have wildly different playstyles, making them almost incomparable.
---
The pig got me out of my survivor main shell, now look at what they've done
---
See I'm a red ranks surivor and I keep getting 17 rank killer and other survivors. So either they all die instantly and I spend the whole game unhooking them and we don't get any gens done, or we all get everything done instantly and we get out in five minutes, I'm never seen or touched by the killer and I de pip.

I do agree with the ghost face and nurse spots tbh tho.
---
Can attempt basement build, territorial imperative, agitation, brutal strength and hex ruin or maybe devour hope
---
I think they're serious lmao but it's pretty atrocious
---
It was a lot of fun. The dwelf crew stole the show. https://youtu.be/wd4iqYomiQs
---
In terms of whatever survivors do, I use mindfulness: whatever is happening is happening, and I'm gonna breathe through and process my reaction and focus. Then I don't let myself get upset; I see the reality of the situation and adapt. Sometimes that means I win, sometimes it means I lose
---
If a killer hits you then that cancels the blood lust.
---
If I use this build and it don’t work... I’m going to be pissed lol
---
His right looks like Vibe Check
---
...when?
---
Used to be Marth for sure before he stopped playing. Idk who it would be now though.
---
New Chapter: Night within them, starring The Gang and Death Metal Biker
---
Did basement first try No Ed was my biggest issue
---
Balancing is not impossible.  It's just incredibly hard since you have to measure all factors that contribute to the strength of each side.  There are still definite numbers to each side so there is a definite way to balance them.  The problem is the number of ring factors affecting both sides.
---
I love fashion Claudettes because they're so sweet, and sweet Dwights (like the holiday Dwight, but not Dweards)
---
Megs are also pretty fun
---
Neutral Neas are my absolute favorite; old school Neas in plaid with the beanie I love to give the hatch
---
you can’t depip till rank 16+ sooooo
---
I dont think anyone plays nurse much anymore, good nurses got bored of her years ago. And the bad nurses left when they removed her broken addons.
---
That would be broken.
---
Maybe back in the day when it was about horror-themed stuff. After like 3 seasons it just became "blah blah angels vs demons" every single episode.
---
Hey, listen I want to tell you this. I believe that you are different, about to challenge the limitations that block the many from mastering these killers. Inside your mind are the keys that allow you to react and predict, which is why it is your destiny to become a Nurse God. Reclaim you're fallen crown.
---
You have to be pretty weak minded to let something as trivial bother you imo...
---
Thanks man I appreciate your opinion
---
I just get the feeling BHVR don't wanna go down other parts of countries they might stick to the Asian, survivors of color, and Caucasion survivors to avoid potentially upsetting other countries.
---
However Jane was a nice addition but I'd love a survivor from Mexico, India and someone Native American because I'd love other cultures aside from the ones we have.
---
That’s because Plague has the power of god and anime on her side.
---
I’ve decided to save up for a headset bc linking the app is so complicated
---
Boo hoo
---
“bUt hE’s StReaM sNipIng” Ninja cries as the killer only has whispers and bbq&amp;chilli
---
TWICE I have looped a killer all game without me having any perks and then at the end they call me toxic. I don't get what goes through their heads - presumably nothing?
---
Thighs, man.
---
Lmao man shut up people just can’t do something new and be proud of it you should have stayed in the basement bro
---
The Bloody Mary episode would be a good call back.  That one terrified me as a kid
---
I don't think Pennywise would come to DBD since we already have a clown, but my idea for his power would be like the Dream for Freddy, you'd have a \~60 second timer before entering this state, which you would start to see any kinds of hallucinations, Pennywise "decoys" walking around the map, if you landed a great skillcheck there would be a chance that the gen would explode, and in this state, Pennywise would shape shift into one of your teammates to trick you, and to exit this state, you'd have to interact with 4 baloons around the map \[like pig's boxes\], and if you spend \~60/70 seconds in this state you would get hindered/exposed
---
Ouch
---
Oh shit I left dead by daylight for a good month or two and...
---
Did ninja fucking play it
---
It's just a failed initialisation. Resetting should resolve.
---
I hope he ordered it toasted
---
Yep, and he's been playing often
---
I keep hearing that killer queues are long but i guess thats on pc because on Ps4 killer queue is almost always under 5 minutes while survivor can take 30 mins
---
&gt;She plays absolutely the same for anyone who was good with her
---
This is hyperbole.
---
Yes, her power works the exact same, and a player with patience for the new cooldown can still play her extremely well.
---
It was still a nerf. She is *not* 'absolutely the same'. 
---
Still strong, still a nerf.

I'm speechless. But if we come together we could boot him off. If enough of us bombard him to leave our community we can make it happen

You could argue that more new players is refreshing, but ninja fanboys wont care about the game. Just more of the teammates you wonder how they could even be so clueless of the strategies of the game.

Ninja... people... cant be our fanbase

Set the frame limit to 240.00. That worked for me

Okay for Oni, but stop it for legion, he's already dead

I use hyper X cloud alphas.
---
Amazing headphones. Comfy, amazing sound quality, really good surround sound. P decent mic, ect.
---
I recommend watching some YT reviews on it. but god its amazing for both killer and survivor.
---
(oh and i have had these headphones for 2+ years, all that needed to be replaced is one of the cords, and my ear muffs are peeling a bit, but thats bound to happen.)
---
Zubat is really good with nurse but doesn’t play as often and with marth gone again, I guess streamer wise there isn’t much nurse content.
---
Yes it was a hyperbole but not by much, she gets her first blink back before she recovers from her cooldown and her second blink 3 seconds after, even faster with add-ons
---
I don’t see a sprite bottle in the top one?
---
I’ve heard on console parties help a lot for survivors so i’m sure it will be worth it.
---
But I still get frames when it's at 0.000?
---
Missed opportunity on my part
---
Nah they look bad. You don't bring in 4 OoO, usually only 1  or 2 at most, 2 with unbreakable, DH, adrenalines and DS. Or if they want to rush the gens Leader, Streetwise and Resiliance with commodious and socket swivels and instructions/BNP
---
Depends on a lot of variables.
---
Rank,which killer,swf or solo,map,perks,etc.
---
Red ranks with sweaty tryhard swf?
---
Survivor sided without a doubt. The survivors just shit on a killers day.
---
High ranks,no swf?
---
Usuay killer sided
---
The killer is nurse/billy/spirit?
---
Killer sided
---
Map with a lot of strong loops/vaults/pallets?
---
Survivor sided.
---
Etc. Etc.
---
Same I always feel humiliated as a killer because I feel clumsy and silly trying to catch the survivors who teabag and play about with me. Survivor is where I’m comfortable...
---
Unless hatch is near by I hook even if they don't wiggle
---
Better perks out there than self care 
---
I used to be apart of that "self care comes in clutch" bandwagon but now im really starting to explore different builds rather than using the same ones every time. Note i only have 200 hours and im still learning shit to this day.
---
Sounds like cheating.
---
Nah people watch noob3 and try to do the same shit he does and they act like Gods, then be same people to DC when they get outplayed stfu
---
He calls himself a pro are u fucking me have u seen his gameplay
---
That’s a bannable offense.
---
I’m sorry what? Why on earth? For what?
---
Just use a pen/magic marker
---
So you know how we currently call bad teammates "potatoes" or a "Meg"/"Meg brain" how about we call them "ninjas" from now on so he'll hopefully realize that's he's not in fact good enough for youtube yet mostly because he says he's a pro
---
To have a reticle for aiming
---
r/wholesomeotzmoments
---
I like using it only when it is the only hex perk. Survivors typically dont do totems unless they have to or they see it. I find if it is the only totem perk it doesnt get found or cleansed as often. There still are some games it gets found before you even get a stack though...
---
Ima killer main but there are multiple reasons why I dont think survivors should get nerfed more I'm fine with where the game is now but theres always room for improvement
---
ever seen a fire barrel? crouch behind one next time you're being chased and you know, the Killer doesn't have line of sight on you, and boom, you're gone.
---
This is just a shitty recaption of an actual funny meme that uses literally the same sentence but changed downed to something
---
Wanted to see if it does heal or not
---
That's a meme format, a template for countless jokes. This is the same joke repeated in different formats.
---
Play a few rounds of killer. It tends to humble you up, understanding what it’s like to have all gens done and exit gates open in a matter of minutes.
---
Is it really though? I could easily do it with my monitor settings... it's not something they can really identify.
---
Yeah, I managed to get 4ks once in a while when I was super in the zone, but the imprecision of analog sticks makes aiming a downright nightmare and has left me unable to kill anyone on quite a few matches. That inconsistency unless I'm in amazing shape at the time is why I say she's trash, since if I'm that in the zone I can 4k with pretty much any killer more easily unless I'm going against a team way above my skill level.
---
A fishman
---
Then that’s your monitor, it has no affect on Dbd files. Any 3rd software party mixed with original DBD files is an automatic ban,  if caught.
---
To be honest I would rather have a bad game as killer to a good game as survivor. 
---
You do all the looping, skill checking, sneaking, rescuing and you will end up with something like 18k points.
---
Eat pallets all the game and still your score be 20k+
---
Somewhat new to the game. Still learning a lot of things! Appreciate the tip :) will definitely try it next trial thank you!
---
How is it bad feedback? This needs to change, neither side should lose because they played well.
---
So cheating
---
9 days probably like it says in the archives.
---
He's a discrace to yui mains I'm sad because I'm a yui main &gt;&gt;
---
Yeah, but this kind of software wouldn't need to interact with the dbd files. Literally a dot in the middle of the monitor.
---
Yeah, there are some people that I remember vividly that specifically play just to be a cunt, so I just dodge them cause it is a waste of time.
---
Like who? Legion is the only one that comes to mind but that was cause their power is just unbalanceable to begin with. Better dead then stupidly op
---
Been there and done that. The constant tbagging and gen rushing blow for sure. But waiting for a match for 5 mins to have it taken in 3 by a killer ain't sunshine either. So instead of getting salty by these 3 killer actions and having my game ruined i refuse to play against them anymore. I call it my lesson learned list.
---
But why? Why is it so hard to just learn the character?
---
not really cheating, and besides, it won't make you learn where to aim.
---
No I did it after the match
---
Damn, that makes me want to try again. I really wanted to play her because I’m a nurse irl but she is so hard.
---
We went from shirtless myers to shirtless tapp
---
I wish, from the little ive seen of him, he’s incredibly bad
---
That won’t really help you. Watch some guides for the huntress and try out different add ons until you find something comfortable. A lot of huntress guides will help with throwing hatchets and give pointers.
---
Reclaim you are fallen crown

---
the problem with Nurse is there are only two types of Nurse players.
---
either they're super ultra good and they stomp the Survivors in minutes or they're hot garbage and get thrashed.
---
the problem is if someone is good at Nurse, they rarely want to play her because usually speaking those super good players actually find chasing and actually PLAYING the game fun. Nurse just doesn't play DBD if you play her perfectly and you just end up getting bored of demolishing teams in three minutes.
---
and if you're bad at Nurse chances are you just don't play her because you're bad with her and don't want to get shit talked and teabagged.
---
I super enjoy Nurse just because I'm in the golden range of Nurse skill level, just good enough to win most matches but not good enough to absolutely shit on teams in minutes and honestly I kind of want to stay at that level of skill, I fear that if I get better at Nurse I'll start stomping with her and lose my love for her and her mechanics.
---
the fact she missed that is pretty sad tbh.
---
Boy that person is gonna love Iron Will
---
Killer queue times are a lot worse to be honest. It sucks for both sides. It sucks to wait 20 plus minutes if not longer just to have 3 gens pop like two minutes in. It sucks for survivors to go up against the same killers with not so fun mechanics as well. That’s why finding counters is important for both sides or some way to mind game.However dcing because you don’t like a killer, if that’s what you do or plan to do, is shitty. Survivors are supposed to try and survive yes but they don’t have the absolute right to it just like killers cannot expect or shouldn’t feel entitled to a 4k.
---
Fake and gay
---
would be soo fucking amazing. daddy pyramid head pls
---
Freddy immediately after release. Pig slowly over the years. Huntress before they realised it was too much and reverted it. Oni (although the 4th panel is more fitting).
---
I'm a Hag main. 
---
Also beside the point. if a survivor dies on the first hook, the killer should get a large chunk of the points he would have gotten from 3 hooking. Enough that if everyone dies 1 hook the killer at least black pips.
---
Same with all 4 survivors d/cing. Why is it when the killer d/ces, the survivors black pip. But when the survivors D/C it can derank the killer? This is a bad mechanic.
---
Killers can equip perks that let them mori so ig that would be the equivalent?
---
Did I have a stroke reading that or did you have a stroke writing it
---
If you learn to curve or use your red stain to your advantage, Billy on Hawkins shouldn’t really be an issue. It may not be as fun as zooming around big open maps, however, it’s better to play it out.
---
It's beautiful. You truly captured my vision
---
Wow, so much hate for suggesting that Killers shouldn't lose rank for people quitting the game.
---
Thought I was on /r/wtf!
---
There was this one claudette that dropped each and every single pallet she came across, she didn't even loop them, she would just move on towards the next one, on post-game she said: gg ez \[she died with about 9000 bps\]
---
You must suck at being killer if you love a perk idea that gives you a free hit
---
Lol
---
Idk just be happy tyst you werent that rank 12
---
11*
---
Well that was completely unnecessary lmao. I'm a survivor main anyway.
---
i hate that that's the exact face i made when i read the title
---
I never dc but in the que before the match starts if one of the names come up i bounce out of the que before the match clock hits red. This is a love hate game. My plans are to enjoy it as much as possible. Just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same.
---
AHOY LADIES!
---
Playing right now and I can vouch for this. I just want to level up Nancy without playing killer but I gotta wait until the next star wars film to release apparently
---
Do you mean looking at the players name? If so understandable. It also doesn’t affect anyone else so i’m sure plenty of people do that. Or should do that instead of dcing.
---
The Mobile daily rituals are much cooler and more rewarding, and there's more of them.
---

---
*I sure hope Pyramid Head is gay*
---
Yeah! I like his man bun cosmetic
---
Big boys get big love from me
---
I main killer but tunneling and facecamping are real strategies, that's what perks like Insidious are for. I always play Ghost Face because of the bonus points, and I have never killed anyone who isn't already dead but I can still not hurt them and that makes me happy. 
---
During one round, all 4 survivors tried to loop me, but I got back by mindfucking them and overkilling the trapped ones. I let them think they are safe for a second and then BAM! I rush and strike them down in one blow, heh heh.
---
One of the changes that came with the 2.1.0 patch was "Evade" mechanics. These mechanics were actually in the game from the beginning, but in my opinion, were never really used. I don't know how good they are or what they are good for, but they were never really used and thus weren't made well.
---
U must protec the ahoy boi because he serve the snac
---
Yeah Claudettes injured noises are so cute it makes me feel so sad especially the mmmm one... you know what I mean!
---
😂😂😂
---
i don't think i've ever seen a more ice cold play before
---
Imagine still getting offended by words in a joke in 2019.
---
Also it’s not my job to tiptoe around your triggers, so no, how about you grow up.
---
It’s weird. If they design a killer with a power to counter loops, then he’s considered uncounterable (excluding Huntress) but if the killer can’t counter loops in some way then the killer sucks. I think Oni was designed in a way in that he’s supposed to represent extremes. Horrible without power but ridiculous with power. Can’t loop him, and has a lot of map pressure. However; now you can loop him around most tiles which hurts his power a lot.
---
Yeah I can understand that with legion and the thing about the pig rework would be the fact that the traps are still connected to generators to go off. So if the game is stalled with gens not being completed then the pig still doesn’t have a power. But at the same time if that’s the case the killer usually has the upper hand anyway.
---
Wait he said a bad work I'm offended omg I'm not gonna watch your content no more monto

How come?
---
I think you're the one that needs to grow up because if you were a normal adult, you wouldn't be commenting stupid shit.
---
Lol fair!
---
Yea, but if no gens get popped, the killer wins.
---
but if you pop gens, you get 600 traps on your face
---
everyone starts somewhere
---
Exactly. I wouldn't dc in match but before it starts. As for killers i get it super hard and annoying as well.
---
I will legitimately quit if I see one of three killers and I've played against one of those three already. I already hate them, I don't want to keep playing against them.
---
I also just discovered the absolute garbage that is Iridescent Button. I legitimately thought the game was bugging out, only to be disappointed in that it was a feature. I honestly stopped playing seriously when I heard the noise, thinking it was a botched game with shit audio, only to discover it was an add-on to Legion. Like I wish I knew that, I probably wouldn't have fucked around, played more seriously.
---
But I mean that's just another reason not to play against Legion, I suppose.

Thanatophobia ruin blood echo sloppy I find is a good perk build for him you injure as many as you can and if you think you cant get to your next person in frenzy go for the guy you just hit with frenzy but not hit him again run infront of him and try body block any pallets or windows they are running to
---
Last live the whole community showed distaste for the upcoming doctor changes and they basically gave us the big "fu** you".  I have decided to play Killer less and start working on a team of swf. If you can't beat em - join em. We can only play with the hand BHVR dealt us, and a killer strike is what this hand is called.
---
That’s what he means. Killers destroy at low levels of play but don’t at high level. The devs goal seem to be trying to balance around the entire community.
---
The mods removed my post like this becuase you need to censor the names and post it on rage Wednesday apparently in violation of rule 8

I'm curious because I don't play much Legion, but starting to get into them, why Blood Echo? I have the same build, but with Discordance instead
---
His bugs got fixed. Nobody really cares about Legion but he’s a meme. He’s the killer who got nerfed and was considered relatively weak and then got nerfed again. And again. It happens in most PvP games where some character gets seemingly randomly nerfed and it becomes a meme in the community.
---
Blood echo becuase it helps get rid of exhaustion perks becuase many good players who use good exhaustion perks will not heal against a legion and sloppy is good against the people who do heal becuase it gives you more time
---
I’ve been getting nothing but killer ones lately, I can’t remember the last time a survivor one showed up for me to complete

I played against the pig and she kept testing my boop game. Everytime I booped, she left me alone. The other survivors, despite my attempts, couldn’t grasp it and they all died.  
---
  
---
Boop the snout, walk on out.
---
He’s just a kid. Hopefully he grows out of it soon. I havent even been here in awhile and first thread I check is another obnoxious post from him with even more obnoxious comments from him lmao.
---
Survivors still play on Billy-friendly maps, even when they’re bound to get destroyed. Just accept that the map is garbage and play the game.
---
Who knows? You might get a group of 4heads.
---
Tbh i find legion with button more fun and a challenge the bubba or hillybilly aka fast boy with the spamming of the saw camping in a basement corner. 
---
Basement corner campers force survivors to make the decision try save your teammate or kiss his butt goodbye because the game is dead if we try do a save.
---
That is a crap decision either way. Nope i will just play against someone else.
---
I just hate how if you go to rank 8 to avoid toxic red rank 4 man swf, you still get them anyways. Then if you go to green rank 12. You get potatos who teabag in a corner all game and tell you to get cancer when they all die with no gens done. Even if your nice they still abuse you in chat because your green rank and not purple like them.
---
It falls under the Over Saturated content because so many people post the same thing about matchmaking - you're supposed to post it in the Wednesday Rage thread per sub rules
---
He doesnt need add ons to destroy survivors.
---
If I intend to give hatch. I give hatch. If they wiggle out that only makes finding the hatch faster.
---
This weekend this happened. When I am just looking at them and I am like..."Hm....easy stalk hehe...hm...maybe just stand and do nothing until they notice me and scatter like rats, that's always funny! Hm....I could go for that jumpscare grab too....alright let us do that...let's see here....who...oh fu Dwight :)"
---
Interesting, I'll give it a try and see how it goes!
---
It was a nerf. Sloppy Butcher was essential on Legion, and they took that away. Now I laugh anytime I am against one.
---
180 flicks were BS tbh, I feel like BHVR should have just reduced the max angle of the flick to 90 instead of making it harder to turn more than 30 degrees at a time
---
If it bothers you, set your profile to friends-only and delete all those comments.
---
Yes but that would only be if the killer downed you put a trap on and left. They would still be hooking and having to get traps. Another thing I forgot to mention is how the pig has to collect more traps at the jigsaw boxes. They don’t immediately reappear. She can restock similar to plague possibly. If someone gets it off then it turns yellow and she knows she can pick it back up. That way it gives survivors time to get things done. Plus she would be limited to 2 without addons.
---
'Doing gens, you?'
---
Purple ranks should never be matched with red ranks. Period. (At least until Rank 5-6)
---
May you sit next to the firepit and tell us of your tales in the fog, friend
---
but the time difference compared to her getting her traps back to the time it takes for a single survivor to get one trap off is way 2 big
---
Gay
---
I would only go to survivor because the queue time is a bit too long. I should get more active and start ranking up again
---
The pallet’s hitbox gets bigger when someone uses that perk on a pallet. Had that happen to me while playing, it’s annoying.
---
HECK
---
Haha thinking I have a family house -  this was made by the orphan gang
---
I'm gay and I'm not offended by something that is clearly a joke Im pretty sure 80% of the LGBT people in the community know this was a joke and don't need people with an IQ lower than room temperature to suck up for us
---
Exactly. Especially now that they're improving totem hiding locations, or worse there are occassionally times where totems spawn in impossible locations (blocked rooms, inside lockers)
---
Rare but it can happen
---
The worst daily ritual*
---
Honestly the Archives added so much toxicity to the game - it's all because of the single objective focus. A player isn't going to care for fixing gens when they have to heal allies and vise versa. Why they didn't just have Archives obtainable like rituals blows my mind. That alone really demonstrates BHVR's ability to balance their game - imo I would get a new balancing team.
---
since dead by daylight has no alternative game modes, making it incredibly boring after a few hundred hours, this'll be quite fun to see Ingame. Hope the devs actually listen
---
I love it, but Rin is probably the reason why necrophilia is as big of a problem as it is.
---
Okay but I feel like this is already really weak. If she’s downing 4 people within only 2 gens being down then she’s better then whose she’s playing against. Usually people will run her a bit. Some not so much but she’s still easy to loop. So if she’s able to get traps on everyone’s head twice before all 5 gens are done then the survivors are doing bad and will most likely have been losing. They could pull out a win but if the killer had the upper hand then they win anyways.
---
LOL wtf did I just watch? Are those hacks?
---
In all the games I've played as killer, most survivors, regardless of killer are anything BUT sneaky.
---
Me: Sees survivor with White Ward
---
Me big brain: lets them survive to waste White Ward
---
Self care is good, but only in solo cue. You can never trust other survivors to heal you.
---
Hahahaha, your salt wall is growing, my friend, well done.
---
If its affecting you, then Don't let them get to your head, since people who go into a prof straight away after a bad game tend to be the idiots themselves.
---
ExtReEm tUnNeL ViSioN... mean while you are dancing around the hooked person with the killer, and trying to flashlight him constantly. Bruh.... 
---
Yeah, flair checks out lol
---
Well you are supposed to be sneaky but not everyone has to do that. But I find it more fun to be sneaky and not get caught the whole match and the doctor just completely ruins that
---
I read everything in text to speech except "addons", which instead was in Elijah's voice.

I feel you man , ive been facing red ranks all day with killer rank 12 , its hard.
---
Spirit just got nerfed lol, I believe they should reduce the noise you can hear while phasing but besides that I believe she's in a pretty good spot. I never have problems playing against a Spirit after her nerf since it's super easy to juke her if you know how to play as Spirit lol
---
And this is why I only play with decked out killers so there is no such thing as being taken hostage and the salty after game chat is delicious
---
They’ll never find out lololol
---
Just wait till you play against doctor and try to be sneaky and get cucked
---
Some are saying 3-7th but I'm pretty sure it was 2-6th
---
Love you hun, you're doing the Lord's work.
---
You’re supposed to play the game how you want. The most effective tactic available (META) is to - again - be anything but sneaky. But again play how you want but he was put in the game to combat that playstyle
---
Favorite exhaustion perk is Head-on because it's fun.
---
They announced in their Q&amp;A a few weeks back that the double BP event will be on the 2nd-6th January
---
Sprintburst becuase it is just the best
---
I healed another survivor as a killer.
---
I had a Trapper tonight who was obviously trying to finish the challenge. He downed me on the opposite side of the map, so I wiggled, got my points for escaping his grasp, then ran to a basement hook and waited for death. 
---
Luckily he was able to get the other three into the basement, too. (They weren’t actively helping with his challenge.)
---
Doctor is an antistealth killer but he's also one of weakest killers in the game as well. Lol
---
Balanced Landing, it's really useful
---
Yikes, that poor killer
---
Seriously though, fix your internet.
---
I love it for various reasons.  Just the finding match system pisses me off lol
---
The sound of impact with my weapon, the screaming, the jumpscares, the thrill of the hunt, the salty chat after (this game allows you to beat up assholes and that along with the hunt are my biggest reasons
---
I agree with a lot of this. However; I don’t think that Oni is the King of snowballing. I think that he should be and was before the hotfix though. Getting a survivor down with power and going to the next one is obviously the best thing with him. The problem is, survivors shouldn’t really be caught out of position by him often (unless you’re on rotten fields or something). When he has power, he glows bright red and is still 10 feet tall with a normal terror radius. Which means that the survivor *should* be able to get to a loop before he gets to them. Before the hotfix, this would not have mattered since he countered loops pretty well. But currently, he has to run the loop normally (which takes a while relative to power time) and then use his normal one shot to down them. He then loses a chunk of his power to down them and has little power left.
---
That being said, that’s how it *should* go on paper if the survivors are playing well. More often than not, in actual matches, survivors get caught out of position or get really greedy and end up getting one shot pretty early which gives Oni more time to find other survivors and have a better chance to snowball. At least, this is what happens most of the time for me and the streamers that I’ve watched. And I’ve basically only played Oni since his release lol.
---
*When you unhook in front of a killer*
---
That is a killer walking backwards, I doubt it's hacks because they got stuck at one point.
---
Nah the comments dont bother me at all, I honestly think it's pretty funny.
---
Nea, my favorite killer.
---
What image? All I see is fog.
---
Dead hard, because it feels like I’m gambling for it to work and when it does it’s amazing
---
But it's nerfed. Is it still very good?
---
To be fair, Legion is the only killer in the game that doesn't have a lethal power.
---
*Sees Michael*
---
*Gen explodes*
---
Bro same
---
I can pitch in here as someone who is colourblind, while I extremely rarely play survivor, yes, for me Ruin skillchecks are very hard to see so I have to hope there's a white wall I can put my camera on so I stand a chance. I've asked my friends who are not colourblind and they tell me that Ruin skillchecks are bright and easy to see.
---
yeah its pretty much impossible for asymmetrical games to be balanced. if one side is having fun the other side most likely isnt. its not even the perks that make the game unbalanced. Its the heavy reliance on RNG when generating maps, awful map design and trash ranking system. 
---
Why do you think there are no tournaments for this game? One team can load into Clowns Asylum map and get Killer shack window facing window of a long wall connected to two more loops that connect to double fast vault in middle building and then next match the survivor team does not get that same god like set up. 
---
add in BHVR incompetence and IDK why this sub even looks at this game as anything but a meme, especially when they themselves are dogshit at it
---
Don't worry, my teammates didn't let me leave through the exit gates so I died :D
---
Yes you say its nerfed but what is nerfed? If your exhausted you will still stagger? What does that nerf mean. It means toxic survivors can no longer run around the same circle nonstop. The nerf doesnt apply to an average survivor in most cases.
---
Furthermore it got buffed as you dont even make sound in dropping. As a killer main, that sound cue is important.
---
I use Vanity Mirror and Tombstone at the same time.
---
Exactly!
---
What about the Doctor? He's a pain in Haddonfield.
---
Still the best killer in the game so who cares?
---
Sloppy no longer works with legions ability. I would replace it with something else more effective personally.
---
Yea, you right.
---
If I could use it, Dead Hard. But because I'm the worse DH user ever, I have to say Balanced Landing. Easy to use, but not in a way that you activate it accidentally.
---
I mean something that can draw a fucking circle on my monitor not some elite dark web program
---
I mix my perks up constantly but I always run ruin and bbq or nurses calling but I like to try whatever i’m feeling at that moment. Pop goes the weasel is also great for legion but I prefer Thanatophobia. Use stridor if you have trouble tracking with him. Also be sure to take full advantage of ff. Most people don’t use it to track which is a waste.
---
Cool meme, but what show is that picture from?
---
Have you been off this sub for the past 2 weeks?
---
this worst part about this game is the RNG on map generation and reddit thinks we need more of it. thats enough for tonight
---
Works until killers start following scratch marks instead of los.
---
LoL nice job!
---
So the secret to maining underused characters is to make them daddies!
---
"300 iq"
---
Einstein's iq: ~160
---
Is that a roast or a compliment?
---
That's the first time I've seen a survivor do that and not get smacked by the killer before they get the prompt to drop the pallet again.
---
Most stuff I see is memes about legion and pig getting nerfed. I thought ninja playing dbd was like a joke, but I watch one of his videos of him teaching his friend how to play and had a good chuckle. I know he's new to the game, and learning how everything works, but he claimed the killer was stream sniping like 3-4 times lol
---
Just give Clown a Pennywise skin, no point in adding another Clown to the game.
---
I mean in this instance the person literally said they were stream sniping 🌝
---
The one's that intentionally fuck you over and troll other players. Also players who DC.
---
Ghostface lasted a few days
---
legion is a fan favorite on this subreddit. The killer that took the chase interaction between survivor and killer and threw it out the window. Now you understand why Legion is reddits favorite lmao
---
Dwighty boy
---
His power doesn’t help him in the chase, he’s weak af
---
There is a 420 in there lol
---
Being that I play both killer and survivor I’m brashly aware? I also never said all killers were anything — I’m specifically taking about situational events. ☺️
---
I'm talking about completely randomizing map layout so that people don't get too comfortable with gameplay. Meta killers and perks really take away from the variety that DBD has to offer.
---
Accurate
---
Same with /r/2007scape. I don't even play runescape but the memes are great.
---
So, a killer tunnels down all team mates, and leaves them slugged, letting all four bleed out rather than picking them up and hooking them. Or slugging a survivor and staying around their body, refusing to let anyone pick them up and forcing them to bleed out.
---
Imagine not knowing how toxic slugging can be.
---
Lithe for me. I like using it for chaining jungle gyms and windows can be found on every map.
---
Claudette. Simply because she’s the most played character and more players equals more toxic players.
---
It's probably just a survive with friends. Same thing happened to me all the time!
---
Shed a tear every time :'(
---
yeah man those 4 troll matches you selectively remember totally skewed their entire data. literally what
---
A month ago while on here, I noticed how some killer mains agree that they face toxic survivors too often, and I’ve made a point to be a better survivor. Now I send killers “Gg” and a positive comment about their gameplay when the match ends if I like how they played (regardless if everyone escaped or everyone died).
---
I'd get so angry at Geralt every time he was a dick towards Jaskier. :(
---
Play legion and use their power and dont kill anyone. pip every game.
---
The REAL crime here is using frosty eyes
---
If a survivor DC's just before they get hooked for the third time I appreciate the BBQ not activating if I'm not near a locker or too far away
---

---
What I heard from one of the devs was a buff, that ended up being a nerf, I hope they don't leave Legion in the state it is right now, even if McLean said while livestreaming that they are fine
---
It’s from a YouTube channel called Vivziepop! Here’s the link to their pilot episode for the show [Helluva Boss](https://youtu.be/OlahNrlcgS4)  they have another pilot called Hazbin Hotel you could look into if you enjoy the first :)
---
the legion was in frenzy and couldnt break it lmfao
---
Since he’s about to get his rework and it seems to be for the better i’m sure it will be more fun for people to play as and hopefully fun to be matched withZ
---
I'm the opposite. I can always hear Michael breathing but never the hex totems.
---
Nea. They all watch n00b3 and decide they wanna be him and his toxic series lol
---
Resilience says it increases vaulting
---
*"Like a good friend, David is there"*
---
And that’s just one instance. But this particular instance? I’m talking about them doing this in one game. Let me elaborate! 
---
Killer downed his first victim, took them to basement. No big deal, right? Well, they proxy camped, went to basement when someone went for the save, slugged them and left them downed in the basement before going to trap upstairs; they then stood just off the boat, watching the area. Someone went for the save, cautiously avoiding the traps before being smacked. They managed to get the slugged person up, the slugged person grabbed the hook — the killer was instantly down there with them, slugged all three and left them to bleed out while heading to look for the fourth.  
---
One had unbreakable and managed to get up but was slugged again while they were picking up the third person. They were then hooked, and the other was left slugged. 
---
On top of all this, they were stream sniping to try and see where people were off two different streams. 
---
Slugging isn’t *always* toxic. But this was. 🌝
---
I suppose I should rephrase: Infectious Fright oni is the king of snowballing. I agree with most of your other statements (Other than the fact that oni can't counter pallet loops; his super long lunge that can break pallets makes it much easier to face loops than other killers)
---
if the data showed a 60% survival rate then this subreddit would be using it as proof that the game is survivor sided. The only reason you are mentioning irrelevant scenarios like “troll” games is because the data doesnt prove what you and reddit killers believe. 
---
To a reddit killer it is more believable that BHVR are some masterminds purposefully manipulating the data than just....realizing that most survivors dont escape as often as you think they do. Just because they escape a lot against you doesnt mean the data isnt wrong man. Tough pill to swallow but you’re just a kid, you’ll get better at games if you just practice man :\^)
---
It does work I'm not talking about the impact on mending I'm talking about taking advantage of the survivors who heal to healthy state
---
i just now FINALLY finished the last of the challenges fuck all a y'all :)
---
Honestly I feel like killers shouldn't be able to turn 180+ on a regular swing. It's annoying to get a really good circle around them but they can just swing and throw their mouse across the room to 360 whirlwind you to death. There are so many maps with large dead zones (as in, no pallets or windows to vault) that having something that can sometimes be pulled off is nice. Even even you pull it off it only buys you a few seconds, anyway.
---
There's pretty much nothing to collect from Tier 7 onwards...
---
Freddy or Hag?
---
Demogorgon
---
The Oni changes in particular had such a bad reaction due to the general consensus of him before imo. People thought he was OP in the beta but he was reasonable and great when the game came out. Fun to play as and against. After the hotfix, not as much.
---
So it went from “wow BHVR did a good job with a killer on launch finally” to “You guys actually did a good job and messed it up in a week”.
---
Neas try the hardest to be toxic, but usually fail. Fengs seem to be the most toxic survs I see that are also reasonably good at the game.
---
Nurse will always be viable as long as they don't rework her power. Which knowing Behavior, they might...
---
I’ll be honest. Your first paragraph wasn’t all that bad. Then you lost your mind on the second one.
---
Oh, is it like when you stun ghostface but quiet or different?
---
Ran into him once and destroyed him on Spirit. Didn't even know it was Ninja Ninja.
---
I don’t really consider that countering loops as much as it’s still dealing with a loop but dealing with the loop faster than the other killers. Like how clown deals with loops vs how Nurse/Spirit deal with them. It’s all semantics though lol.
---
Nea or meg or Dwight
---
This post is ToXiC.
---
But in all seriousness, I'm predicting people will be arguing in the comments. Because they're toxic.
---
Legion should be nerfed. They should remove Legion from the game.
---
Imagine getting downvoted for speaking the truth.
---
Yall are actual snowflakes and I pity you. Fake and gay!
---
I mean that proves the point doesn’t it. 😂
---
You’re fake and gay
---
A lot of people on here just love to argue or insult people instead of discussing anything. No clue why, just how it’s always been.  There are some cool people
---
with open minds to both sides and their arguments but it just depends.
---
Hey
---
I can tell this post was made by a Blendette.
---
Not saying he's fun to go against, but idc about him revealing my location. I care about not being able to use Dead hard, vault a window, and shit like that in key moments.

Nah I’m a Laurie main lol. You would expect me to play literally anyone else but 💁‍♀️
---
It’s really bizarre. Like, I don’t really understand the reasoning behind it? Maybe people just think it’s fun to be jerks rather than be constructive. 🌝
---
If you're getting that many comments about your internet, you should probably fix your internet..
---
Cool.
---
Hooking people in the basement is still just playing the game, you can still do gens and escape. DCing out of spite when you're beaten is completely unsportsmanlike.
---
Sitting in the corner waiting for your team to die so you can skulk out the hatch is actively saboutaging your team making it basically impossible. They don't deserve to be rewarded for that.
---
I would be **SO OK** with that after the 4th stun. Dying and being hooked is nothing compared to completing this pain in the butt challenge.
---
Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I really appreciate this information, and I will use it in the future during my gameplay.
---
Spider can't hook people? Maybe it can do something else that isn't hooking but works the same way?
---
Say it instead has nests and warps people up or something different.
---
Depends on the player.
---
Probably head on. Getting points for stunning a killer is nice. It also pairs well with a decent amount of perks.
---
Well she’s made to have a lot of map pressure.
---
If played right she should have traps all over the map. Most people I see play her barely have 2 sometimes.
---
you must like playing against ghost face because a lot of times you will be on an even page with everyone else
---
But your last sentence makes sense. Why have killers all have the same player style. 
---
Some are territory based, others are stalkers, some are loopers and there is mobility and some are two in one. All want to kill and defend. They key is that they do differently than each other. And they counter differen things. 
---
Doctor is fuck your p3 urban evasive blendette killer.
---
The game just generates salt in general so who knows.
---
Keep trying you will get there! Watch fungoose, otz (our lord and savior) has guides for begginers and people commend ohtofu but I never watch him. Spacecoconut for hag as well! 
---
Don't use noed now as it can teach you 
---
bad habits. 
---
What killers are you starting with?
---
After Legion hit the pallet, it looked like he was out of frenzy. After that, bust that pallet wide open.
---
Also bring an ebony
---
I'd really hate games in which I get fucked by an unlucky map generation. Something as vital as that determined by RNG is a terrible idea.
---
he is just kinda obnoxious, it really sucks that we have an entire killer dedicated to being annoying and thats it. Like he isnt annoying but good, no his only attribute is being annoying.
---
That being said, i would take a doc over a GF, clown, or spirit any day
---
Now you can swing that arm really fast but only when you're carrying something on your back.
---
And then claiming to be anti-vax when its born
---
Close postgame chat, run noed, and just focus on the match. Let the kills and points speak for themselves. Usually his I go about it when I'm just sick of the BM
---
New Ghostface cosmetic?
---
Earlier self care heals at 80% of normal heal speed so they recommended it. Now its 50% and most people dont recommend it. Its better to run bond then self care or bring a medkit.
---
It looks very nice, but why the "SHIT, I DROPPED MY ICE CREAM!" perk?
---
To be fair I usually let them hit me so they get points but never away from the gates or if they have noed
---
That's like saying grabbing someone's balls is a real strategy in a fight.
---
I mean, yeah, it'll work. But no, it doesn't mean it's a positive thing.
---
Just a continuous, very low breathing sound.

You can hear the Wraith's footsteps too when he's cloaked but that one might be more obvious.
---
Dead by daylight is legit the cutest horror game ever
---
Does anyone else remember when killers actually made public black list to dodge/mori survivors that they dont like.
---
yea im on a few of those
---
Does Hexy really have a bad rep? I think his overreactions are hilarious
---
te llaman
---
That's just dumb
---
They hated /u/rorororoxr because he spoke the truth
---
I'm getting red rank survivors as a 12/13 killer consistently. It's sooooo broken.
---
That happens 9 out of 10 times to me.  I'm good at red ranks without even needing to rank up.
---
Survivors actually need offerings that do somthing. 
---
Killers really dont have much but its more then  survivors.
---
That being said i would rather have moris get nerfed then add any new offerings. But if i had to add one, i would want an offering add another gen to the map. (to a maximum of one or two)
---
This would make it so the killer has more gens to keep offline while survivors only need to pop 5
---
The one I can understand (now there is EGC) is that party hats can't activate after every gen gets completed (unless put on before last gen is popped). I don't remember most other pig nerfs.
---
+1 air acquired
---
Seen ohms vid of a mad grit demogorgon lol and man is it terrifying
---
&gt; I think some of the “single match” challenges are fun, because they depend a lot on the killer, your team, and the randomness of how the match goes.
---
That's exactly what's wrong with them. They're completely out of our control. So it feels like we're stuck on a challenge forever waiting for favorable conditions.
---
&gt; You’re not supposed to be able to get 3 challenges done in one match. Most people would be done the entire archives in a day or two that way.
---
Other battlepasses allow players to do that and they still take more than a day or two to be done. But if that becomes a problem, they can just increase the number of challenges in a tome.
---
&gt; the Spine Chill survivor challenge where you cannot be hooked by the killer at all.
---
You see, I found this one easy because Spine Chill is in all of my builds. It didn't take much for me to get it. But I understand how frustrating it can be for people who rely on other perks and find it difficult to lose the killer. I agree that everything that potentially forces an alien playstyle should go.
---
i hope they dont ban for x number or reports bc letting someone die to get hatch definitely isnt considered a bannable offense, its supposed to be part of the game even if being on the receiving end sucks
---
That sounds cool and would have more impact than removing a couple of hooks.
---
Nice one
---
Awe =\[ D: :x :O &gt;.&lt; u mean survivors are fucking assholes??? Sh0o0o0ok =( \^\^ ;\_;
---
Im fine with it.  It will expand the life of the game and maybe get them enough cash to make the events happen again.  Who knows maybe a new game mode.  Jk I'm sure that will focus all that cash in to cosmetics
---
Same, im playing only him since chapter comes out, having tons of fun
---
&gt; Apart from campers &amp; tunnellers y’all can suck my ass.
---
which, according to post game chats, is every killer!
---
I main killer, but now I genuinely have to play survivor because I get such awful lag spikes.
---
Nah.
---
Oh I’m sorry. So which part of the survivor rulebook states a killer must *always* immediately pick up a survivor after downing?
---
*points flashlight*
---
*Elephant noises*
---
I let the killer hit me at the exit gates so they get the extra points.
---
It’s even better when you unhook them during the EGC and they run in the opposite direction of the gate
---
You know im just cool with any survivor/killer thats not iconic just lets bhvr have some creativity on what they want to do. Maybe like a twice every year thing where they get a licensed killer/survivor. Would i like to really have a say on what gets added yes, but will it happen No
---
Ironic because you never even specified to me what this “situation” was. All you did was say in your OP “slugging is toxic”. When in reality, it’s something that is required to be done by any good killers.
---
That's the sad part
---
I literally didn’t. You obviously didn’t read my text original post.
---
I kinda wish they still could so long as EGC wasn't active. But I imagine that would be pretty difficult for BHVR to program.
---
Instead, they should focus on improving other aspects of her base kit, and her completely underwhelming add-ons.
---
Additionally my first response directly to you said “how toxic slugging CAN be” which infers that it has the potential to be toxic, but is not inherently toxic.
---
Theres nothing wrong with wanting and asking for something you want to be added to the game. Now if people are saying this game is trash because they aren't in the game then yeah sure that's ridiculous. I will not stop requesting jason vorhees  to be added. I dont give a fuck if theres a lawsuit or whatever reason hes not in it. This game isnt complete until jason is added and I'm not giving up until we get him..
---
Chucky should be added too.
---
SO YOU JUST GOING TO POST FRUIT GUMMY BUT NOT THE JUICE HUH 
---
I SEE HOW IT IS
---
And therefore more fun. So many funnt situations happen when trying to play in a specific way or get a specific goal.  
---
I was doing the 6 traps in a single match challenge and I was 2 trapped survivors short. There was 2 survivors left and they were in a 4k or hatch position so instead of sacrificing one of them after picking him up, I showed him the trap and let him wiggle off. He proceeded to bm me, refusing to farm. He kept disarming it. I left him and went for the other guy. The other guy even refused to loop properly knowing that I wanted him to run into a trap somewhere. Then I heard his team mate vault a window and get trapped. He was trying to do the fast window vault bm booms to get my attention and stepped right into the trap he disarmed a moment ago. The thing is it armed itself up because I had Iridescent Stone (every 30 seconds a closed trap opens automatically). The guy I was chasing then panicked and started looping properly, stepping into another trap.  
---
It was hilarious.
---
Damn, I wish people left nice messages like those on my profile :(
---
LOOK I WANNA COLOR IT FIRST OK I’LL POST THE JUICE ONE TOMORROW
---
Please Michael may I have fuit gummy 🥺🥺🥺
---
Michael will give u the last pack 😔🙏🏻
---
hahaha man, when i first started playing, I thought it was the survivors being nice. Like, oh lets wait here and let the killer get some extra blood points for finding and hitting us one last time!  
---
Ignorance is bliss!
---
When people still think hitboxes are the issues
---
bless michael...i offer him a pineapple juice box in return....🧃
---
BIG SIPS THRU MASK 🧃💦

The big problem with Autodidact is "THE NUMBERS, MASON!"  The first 2 skillchecks set you back 35% of a bar, and skillchecks 3 and 4 only net you a total of 20%.  You need to get 5 skillchecks just to break even (at tier 3.  At tier 1 you need to get 10 motherfucking skillchecks to break even and at tier 2 you need 6 to break), you usually only get 1 check per heal, and the perk can easily fuck over your own team more than it helps by giving the killer more time to come back and tunnel the person you reverse-healed.  The problem with adjusting the likelihood of skillchecks, however, is that this is a perk that could easily be overtuned.  Getting two 35% skillchecks back to back would make for some pretty cheese plays.  I think another way to rework Autodidact would be to take its name more literally.  It means self taught, so what if it gave you a boost to healing others after healing yourself?  Something like "After healing yourself for a total of 50% of a health state, gain a token.  For every token, the speed at which you heal and mend other survivors is increased by 10%.  You may have a maximum of (4/5/6) tokens."
---
to be fair, the demogorgon literally tunnels when using his ability, and his add-ons are like, crushed soda bottles and other pieces of trash. the guy was a dick for harassing you, BUT HE WASNT TECHNICALLY INCORRECT.
---
You find it fun hiding in a bush?
---
I got three hits one time and then the killer wouldn't take the fourth cause he got tired of getting stunned.
---
HyperX Cloud II. It's the set the many BHVR devs use and it's pretty much the best set for less than £100.
---
Depends on what ur trying to do
---
You’re not wrong, but I had at least 3 matches today where I was tunneled right off the hook. One involving Bubba 😂
---
D e p r e s s i n g
---
Hm? Can you elaborate? Im not sure like? What tactic or?
---
Bruh. You say that it's dumb when killers can do 360 swing in the same sentence with "when I do a good 360 circle around". Like, WTF?
---
Basically a build or tactic yeah
---
I like high pressure builds. So i usually slug when its possible. Early game is also important for me.
---
Chase game for me is also going pretty good even without any chase perks. Tho im all ears can help alot with m1 killers
---
I've beem playing for like 2 years and I've always used self care. It's definitely my crutch perk
---
He now looks like the masked cannibal from the forest
---
Hey there. Just curious, do you have a Cursed Legacy updated version? I'd love to use these icons to fill my missing icons from a dif pack, but I don't see Oni/Yui. If I'm blind, please inform me haha
---
I stuck around to the end game just to get hooked because someone mentioned in lobby they needed the end game unhook. Np. 
---
Ask in the lobby if you're having a hard time getting those challenges. :)
---
This is what id run 
---
Ruin 
---
Im all ears 
---
Nurses calling 
---
Thrilling tremors
---
I played Jumpscare Myers and the Survivors pretty much started suiciding when I got 1 person in the basement. Literally tried to unhook while I was still there.
---
Got called a basement camper though haha.
---
Aight. Ill prob replace ruin with pgtw but thanjs alot. I see people run nurses on him alot but dont know why? I usually dont see anyone with it when im playing.
---
Much rather BHVR to create their own than licensed killers tbh
---
Gg hope all goes we'll for ya happy killing
---
Mhm. So about nurses. Why do people use it on gf?
---
Some people are just delusional. Once they get bored of something they think it's dead despite it not being the case. Almost as if the world revolves around them.

I really couldn't tell ya in all honesty ngl
---
You are the reason this community sucks, this is a player who is proud of something they have achieved. Yet you rub your salt and trash all over it to make them feel worse.
---
Mkay, well. I got it so might aswell try. Thanks again.
---
that’s exactly what I keep seeing, it’s so fucked. and to compensate, I’m getting face camped to death and I’m seeing more and more killers having to do stuff like that to get any kills.
---
and how did that make you feel \*flips over page in notepad\*
---
Ive never seen this happen on PS4 but ive gotten this and 2 killers 1 lobby on the switch haha. Is it a bug?
---
Less scratchy....
---
Yea I know, but I’m not very good at coloring yet.
---
I love the perk but tbh i think it's one of the dumbest perk names in the game.
---
Lithe can be a bit too on the situational side imo
---
Your steam name is pretty on point for this situation
---
*\*looks out window upon hearing sound\**
---
**"hmm...must've been my imagination"**
---
*\*looks over to bottom right and sees spine chill activated\**
---
**...\*slowly turns around and sees Myers staring menacingly behind me\***          **\*tier 3 Myers sound starts blaring\***
---
Nah, just being Honest but OK Joseph
---
Of course it is the part of the game. As a survivor you need to *escape the killer*. Even in real life you would have to choose ever kill yourself trying to rescue someone from idk, school shooter, or to run for your life from school.
---
It isn't okay and fair for the other, but it is survivor main objective *SURVIVE* not *BE ALTRUISTIC 24/7 AND DIE BECAUSE OF THE TEAMMATE *
---
Yea that shit sucks when it happens. But some games you’ll get the forehead survivor who can’t comprehend losing without making up an excuse. “I lost, therefore you must’ve camped.”
---
Pop, sloppy, nurses and thrilling. People use nurses on GF cuz you can sneak up on people healing and down them instantly instead of wasting time with a chase
---
&gt; but it’s not like you have to be incredibly perceptive to see it on high graphic settings
---
umm yes, did you?  "but it’s not like you have to be incredibly perceptive to see it on high graphic settings"
---
If anything he’ll bring a wave of popularity which means more money in the devs budget.
---
Baby Dwight doo doo doo doo doo doo
---
Your name is whycampdawg, you're obviously a biased survivor main. Also, I'll happily give up both my mori's for keys and rushboxes
---
I was considering something like that the hatch spawns as far as possible from the survivors.
---
Delighted Dwight would be a buff to Huntress tho.
---
More Lockers &gt; They are closer &gt; You can refill hatchets quicker, not going anywhere further
---
Does it actually?
---
I have stepped over the barrier and i dont care anymore... Mostly
---
The Archives are fine get off your ass. The game was already toxic to begin with and the Archives just added a way to grind bloodpoints.
---
Same. Rank 10 killer and getting majority red ranked survivors.
---
I love how you say it like it's a bad thing to run insta hatchets
---
If he calmed the fuck down and stopped calling out the killer in PGC, and of course learn about game mechanics more and game play itself, he would bring a lot of new players to the game and shorten the queue times on low ranks. Otherwise we will have OchiDo 2.0, but with less impact?
---
It all depends on his fanbase (and if 9/13 year Olds would buy the game and just be straight toxic to everyone)
---
Tfw when you play gen sneakily and gen jockey because you suck at looping and can't get a single pallet stun.
---
Are we gonna act like this community wasn't already toxic?
---
She just wanted her hatchets :(
---
Being left to pass phase 2 on the hook even the killer doesn't camp is so painful guys. It's even more painful than being facecamped to death, it's even more painful than being tunneled. It actually discourages me to play with that team for the rest of the match, all I want to do is running straight to the killer and leave the match as soon as possible.
---
Maybe you guys think I'm toxic or something like that but frankly speaking, I can stand anything in this game except for this.
---
There are public blacklists awesome where?😄😄
---
plebarino
---
Even though Billy's outfits are only expensive, I love them all. What I can say I love ridiculous outfits.
---
Hitting with feral frenzy doesn't apply sloppy butcher anymore. So unless you down them it won't make a difference.
---
I believe the implications are that he will lather your grilled body with said sauce
---
Ah alright ty.
---
I got to as far as rank 8 and you get entire teams of rank 1-3.  I can handle purple ranks just fine.  But rank 1 survivors are something else.
---
The killer's about to down a survivor, but a boxers only Tapp shows up and starts tbagging. The killer goes after the Tapp but a David who was hiding behind a pallet unexpectedly dropped it on the killer and all the survivors escaped  
---
Tapp: "Hey David, you think that thing helped, eh? You think the distraction helped?"  
---
David: "Hahahaha, no but I wanted to see if you would do it."
---
Proper toxicity
---
lol
---
Why did he stop playing Fortnite? 
---
Out of curiosity, what rank is he? and has he encountered Nurse yet? lmao
---
I like him too but that doesn't mean he doesn't have room for improvement or need some buffs and proper balancing
---
spinning a random wheel for perks maybe we don't know it doesnt look like a sweaty player tho
---
A fucking pooh meme
---
You can be sneaky against doctor.  In my matches against doctor I'll only get to stage 3 if I'm in a chase.  You can push down your madness by crouching outside of his terror radius.  You can also reduce madness by being in a locker while in his terror radius.  I'll only do this if he's in a chase with someone else.  And working on a generator or a totem will not reduce your madness.  He's one of the easiest killers to loop if you are in a chase.  And don't go for a save if you haven't hit tier 2 madness yet.
---
&gt;but his power has better control
---
it doesn't at least billy can fucking curve in loops but oni cant do shit sure oni can run across the map easier but a good billy can do pretty much the same and be more scary then oni bc with Oni u just go to a 90 degree wall and he cant get u with a insta down
---
Don't expect much. They said that they are happy with the DW changes, which is ridiculous btw, and recognize that Legion is in a bad spot so they will try to fix him in the future. If anything, they will probably use their usual buff something nerf something else formula instead of properly addressing the problems Legion has.
---
Nice moves! I’m still so hit and miss with 360’ that I still get hyped whenever I land one...even if I do end up going down a moment later 😂
---
this is soooo pretty uwu
---
okay ig
---
All is welcome to play the game.
---
I'll smack those who are disrespectful... Especially if streamers are known to be toxic. I ain't afraid of 'em.
---
First of all lvl Cannibal for BBQ because its usefull for farming BPS and one of the best perks in the game. Second lvl up hag for hex ruin cause its op for slowing down the game which is in favor of every killer and absolutely needed for some (one of the best perks in the game). Third u should lvl up a killer that is good for BPS farming which was legion but after his nerfs its kinda hard on him. In low elo u can still pick him for BPS farming but later on u should just pick a Killer that u are good with or having fun with(cause this will ensure that u continue playing the game). After that yes Nurse is a good choice for nurses calling(op perk too) but as a new Player i can recommand u the trapper because brutal strength and agitation are not the best perks but worth most of the time and on most killers. Even if u arent that experienced  they will help u win no matter how good u are. From there i would recommend u the Clown for PGTW and The Plague for Corrupt Intervention. Anyway best of luck as a killer. Dont try to always kill all Survivor and let some escape from time to time to get some good karma and dont rank up that fast. High rank survivors will fool u all the time and u wont have that much fun. Get some good perks first and then rank up. Also dont use red Addons or Offerings before u get into Red Ranks because save them for the toxic survivors uk.
---
probably for the next month
---
Getting 4 stack survivors 5-10 ranks above you is absolute frustration. Of course the rank point system doesn't give a shit and still deranks you.
---
why should I be happy about a toxic asshat coming to DBD taking his fans with him that are toxic as well to ruin the game even more we don't want toxicity we have toxicity and we want it gone thank u
---
This actually looks super badass, it reminds me of that scene in Saw 7 where Doctor Gordon jumps Hoffman with the help of Brad and Ryan.
---
It's really deterring me from playing killer at this point. I just stand no chance against the groups I'm put up against.
---
it’ll be there forever, its no event exclusive
---
Nice yeah so far I've seen only replied with this headset. I was thinking of getting Astros A10s cause I heard decent things but I'll probably get these.
---
He's high rank weak, while low tier broken powerful.  It has to do with what tactics are used at what ranks.  At high tier, urban evasion isn't a perk that used.  But between ranks 9 - 15 it's in the top 5 most used perks.  High rank survivors rely on their knowledge of tiles to be able to buy time for their team mates, however, in low rank games survivors rely on stealth to escape.  It's pretty difficult to stealth a doctor so he's extremely powerful up until doctor starts facing rank 9 survivors.
---
Yea I imagine the report button doesn't fucking do anything at this point and I don't blame BHVR tbh
---
*record scratch*
---
*freeze frame*
---
Yup, that's me. You are probably wondering how I got in this situation.
---
calling him a big head...I think?
---
They've done a fair bit to quell how easy it is to derank by making the season reset only drop you down to the next color tier below your current one, instead of halving your current rank.   Means rank 1s don't become rank 10s overnight, but just rank 5.   For not playing the game/killer/survivor, it takes 4-5 months to fully de-rank, vs 3 months.
---
With DC punishments also coming into play now finally, that other easy source of de-ranking is going away too.  You could still ultra-potato your killer games and suicide on hook as survivor to derank, but at least that forces you to go through a fair bit more time.
---
It's not about toxicity, because it doesn't matter how hard we will try, there will be always toxic people, and we can't do anything about it.
---
I am saying, that he would bring more fresh players, who (idk, 1%/50% of them) would act toxic at the start. And that toxicity, at the low ranks, would teach other people being toxic (Of course they're already teached, that T-bag after pallet stun is a must). Let's be honest, Dead By Daylight can be sometimes more stressful than scary. And of course, I don't know if baby killers would like to see survivor T-bagging him after pallet stuns every time, especially when the killer player is young. If they don't know why they're T-bagging, they will learn: They T-bag, because they suck at game, because they are noobs and worse than them. Maybe they suck, but they're beginners! My God, everyone sucked in every game at the beginning. It would discourage begginers playing the killer, if their objective was "Kill the one who disrespected me". And the circle closes, we can see tunnelers and Face campers, especially in Low ranks. They do it to secure a kill, yes, but there's a chance, that they belive that if someone is better than them, is toxic, and will show it how much they suck.
---
The time will show, if Ninja would bring new players, or bring new wave of toxicity in this game.
---
What? They stopped frenzy in front of the pallet after the attempted hit. Totally could have broken it but instead they just walked away.
---
OP is not on their high horse, it's clear as day. Lighten up.
---
I'm roughly in the same boat.  I play an equal amount of survivor and killer, so I'll rotate back to survivor when I get frustrated with killer.  Not to mention I'm a better survivor then killer.  I'm a rank 8 killer but I'm a rank 3 survivor.
---
Map offerings should be removed just bc how unbalanced some maps are making it heavily unfair when u can choose such maps.
---
Remove mori offerings just fuck these things only good ones are green and red and it just assures someone is getting fucked not very fun balance even if I am the killer main.
---
that is all
---
First world problems
---
Petition to make Tier 69 the maximum tier in the rift
---
It does alert him as the snares make their own scream sound effect when stepped on. Fake pallets also alert him as  they make noise when dropped.
---
I love resilience tbh
---
But hey! You did 3K
---
Congratulations Spoiled Toes
---
Yeah I'm rank 4 survivor as well, survivor times on ps4 are pretty atrocious right now so I figured I'd just increase bloodpoints and get quick matches as killer. Straight up not having a good time lol.
---
Lol nothing against n00b3. He’s my favorite streamer, but I see it all the time.
---
We all started somewhere didn't we?
---
Sometimes I like to bring Broken Key and see if I will be tunneled
---
I’m not doing any custom matches though. And, it’s not my name at the end of the game that pops up but the other person’s.
---
That’s literally most memes in this subreddit
---
I’m just saying he can’t really be toxic yet if he’s ass
---
Searching for survivors or evading the killer is what makes the game fun. Randomly generating maps will help keep it fresh and encourage switching strategy to an extent. Damn, why are you coming at me like cleaned a toilet with a rag and jammed it down your mother's throat?
---
How has this post lasted this long
---
I agree mostly. I just don't understand why people spend their time hating on something/someone they don't like. There's better things to do with your time.
---
They either find it immediately or they get put six feet under. It's really good in smaller ranks where nobody knows what the fuck they are doing and in like a hex protector build with thrill of the hunt. Hag is pretty good with said build.
---
&gt; but the Legion nerfs made him more boring to play against when I'm survivor
---
Don’t forget that sounds, Wraith, Spirit, and Hag all got broken right before they went on vacation (:
---
Aliens
---
I'm gonna say no, the items probably activates on the item you have equipped and not the one you are holding. But I am not sure.
---
to be honest i understand it, ninja gets a bad rep and can be toxic but again, it’s for show. I don’t really care much about him but i don’t think he’ll make that much of an impact on the game. Besides, i believe most of his viewers stay for fortnite and leave when he plays dbd
---
Dont you also love bright neon skins that just scream "here I am, come hook me!"
---
I think it only works with something you bring in. Although its much safer to do it that way anyway, since theres no guarantee you'll even be able to open a chest, and if you do theres no guarantee itll be something worth using a white ward for.
---
Rank 1 survivor means literally nothing
---
I have like 300+ hours on this game and a few days ago I learned that survivors can heal each other without medkits.
---
Yes, pretty sure it's checked on death as to whether you drop your item where you died or keep it.
---
Yes you keep exactly what is in your hand, people saying you don't are incorrect
---
Megs are cute because they are all bots. Whenever they see you they just run. They will occasionally vault a window or drop a pallet but only if it's on their way, they will abandon a loop no matter what. Be it missing a skillcheck, hearing the Terror Radius, hearing the heartbeat etc whenever they have a feeling your are near they will run for dear life.
---
Yeah ranks don’t really matter, you nailed them!
---
High skill ceiling tech that is effective but isn't easy to execute (like that flick) is so much more fun to go against than something that is braindead easy to execute but is also super effective (freddy snares, bloodlusting)
---
Cause as a survivor, if you have experience playing the killer or against the killer, not only do you have options for risk/ reward coin tosses but you can challenge the killer's level of skill flat out. Kind of like Nurse; getting into a certain position, coaxing them to "land this shot if you're good"
---
Idk why they removed it. Oni was fucking scary to go against but not as oppressive as say a good nurse. The charge is so unique there's like infinitely more possibilities to try and learn before it's a solved game.
---
Whereas someone like Freddy, Nurse, or Spirit is "solved" right out the gate. No counterplay, just hope the person playing them fucking sucks.
---
and like u said "new people are finding and enjoying this game" keywords new people adding more toxicity is not okay just bc we already have toxicity
---
The Crow, Hatch and Hook Recycle killer offerings are actually pretty solid
---
And blew up the gen that wad about to finish :/
---
when people say "god nurse" or really "god" any killer, those people still make mistakes. no one can play 100% perfectly, but the thing about nurse, is you fuck up, but you can almost immediately stand back up and fuck up the survivor you are chasing.
---
A "god nurse" might miss a few times, but you cant really read anyone without knowing how they play, you mostly just guess
---
i dont have a link, but i do know there where a few i was on, it was a whileeee ago
---
I actually really like wacky and stupid looking cosmetics. I don't know they seem funny to me
---
I feel like he was counterable, but *insanely* nuts. As survivor you really have to play like 2 or 3 steps ahead, and also consider just how maneuverable he is/ how he can juke you despite looking like he's committing to one direction.
---
My way of nerfing Oni would have been to completely rework some of the clearly broken add-ons (top knot) and make the "aoe" of his demon strike considerably narrower the more you turned during the lunge. That way you had to have some precision when performing flicks.
---
I appreciate this a lot
---
Everyone is complaining about ninja but i hear no one talking about how hexy is literally teaching him how to be a cunt in this game.
---
Meh I would go near for urban immersion
---
So in other words you are a bad player and let your team take all the pressure GG
---
Getting Hit and activating lithe at the same time is almost a guaranteed escape though. I actually started using Lithe in because of the vault lag. Gives me a double boost pretty much.
---
I disagree.
---
Against a good oni, yeah you felt helpless on 90% of the map, but against most Oni's I faced they were really bad or sloppy with the lunge execution.
---
I'm a lot happier going down to an Oni than a Freddy bloodlusting with floor snares. The former takes a little bit of practice, while the latter a fucking braindead pidgeon could peck out.
---
Or I’m playing the game how your supposed to and not being a dumb ass and running out to get myself killed.
---
Why punish people for crimes they haven't committed yet. You assume there will be "new toxicity" when not enough time has allotted to make that an accurate assessment.
---
The Tapp on the right says it's his turn to play on the Xbox
---
reported for stream sniping
---
I saw that map almost 5 years ago on a youtube videa
---
ouch
---
I find him fun to face. Who cares if he reveals you? He’s weak as hell and gets looped all game.
---
make the most of it while you can and have a pig crouch party
---
I believe the third thing was that you have 10 or so seconds to leave the proximity to the hook before it starts penalizing you. So you do have enough time to check around if you think someone is nearby.
---
That's a cool idea fam
---
Jesus christ
---
*cough*
---
Lol dbd was the first game where I had to make my profile private for this reason. Had one giy so upset he left comments everywhere, on my profile, on my screenshots etc
---
Anyone who is playing p3 of a character no one even touches.
---
Like Adam or tapp
---
SB is the best, SB gang
---
It's just a common add-on, pair it with honing stone and it is ok.
---
Nah the normally daily rituals are so much better. U can actually remove one if you don't like/want it whereas the archives force u to be a toxic killer/survivor. Also the daily challenges reward sooo much more bloodpoints than the archive one. Most of the time the daily challenges can be done in a single trial and reward up to 60k but archives are like hook 5 survivors in basement using a perk and reward 20-25k only. Or like destroy 100 pallets/generators and the reward is 25k (obvious exaggeration on pallets/gens lol)
---
the map is just a beach, instead of pallets its beach towels that you throw on the killer to slightly annoy them instead of stunning them
---
You need to play the game more before throwing opinions out
---
Daddy Joey
---
Obviously
---
you feeling okay?
---
Fair, maybe with a change like this it would have to be made yellow. 
---
Not gonna lie I don't really play trapper, idea just popped in my mind as I was watching Otz's latest video with padded jaws
---
And survivors have no way to pop either and they’ve been robbed more than you since you were at least granted they easy game, they were literally just put in a match to die.
---
So don’t be surprised when they disconnect instead. People like you ruin the game. Imagine making someone wait 3 mins on the floor so you can feed your ego after 2 people already got kicked/disconnected from the game.
---
I got face camped 4 times by the same russian player today. But despite that, I still hate the solo survivor experience.
---
Out of curiosity, why do you say NOED teaches bad habits?
---
Literally how I got the challenge lol.
---
In a real fight? Do whatever you want to avoid bodily harm yourself, that's definitely a positive thing. 
---
Why is it that killers are expected not to "play dirty" though (camping/tunneling)? You see survivors saying "real killers" wouldn't do that, and you even see killers saying "I'd never do that", but why? Honest question.
---
Why is it that killers are expected to play by the rules, when there are absolutely no such rules in place for survivors? I never ask you not to complete too many gens at once or not take advantage of me not facing a wall when I pick someone up.
---
Because imagine using a cheap POS like Billy and then complaining that you don’t get to use the broken POS to his full potential.
---
In my experience, it gets used plenty. It costs me hits on window traps at least a few times a day.
---
When I didn't have a game, and just watched some dbd youtubers, I thought that Huntress is a man with a long black beard
---
I know right! He’s part of the reason Ninja is like that and no one cares.
---
*starts throwing money at the screen*
---
I guess if you like greasy, pimply faced nerd....
---
I actually like this idea alot. Its a nice buff to a meme addon that doesn’t make it insanely.
---
Self-caring takes 32 seconds, 40 seconds with sloppy
---
Ahh yeah I understand. Tbh I love playing him and I’ve only played with him in grey to green ranks. In green ranks I usually get schooled and get no kills haha
---
Dude, even a perk that requires build up should NOT allow you to heal a full health state in three seconds.
---
Never said there aren’t any on survivor but its surprising to me how little are tbagging or disconnecting.
---
Meanwhile survivors get disconnected from the servers and killers still slug and spam “ez ez noobs” post game. Nodding after every instadown, hard camping and tunneling with zero shame and gloating postgame, mori spam and anytime you even come close to winning there seems to be an 80% chance of a disconnect.
---
That’s my genuine experience the past few months.
---
Glad they weren't salty
---
hOw DaRe yOU cALl mE tOxIC? gEt gUD bAbY kIlLER/SuRvIOvr fIlThY MaIN
---
I'watch this later.
---
A game that allows camping and tunnelling make people feel salty? 
---
I wouldn't guess.
---
Sorry for the bad drawing, it's late, and I'm tired.
---
I don't get it
---
i believed for THE LONGEST time that the "exposed" effect meant that killers could see me
---
I don't even play survivor anymore because I had back to back to back to back to back games where all survivors were red ranks and the killers were rank 13-18. I always apologize and tell them they played well regardless, but it sucks knowing they most likely had no fun at all
---
I thought the game was balanced.
---
Funny thing about it is when I was rank 15-13 I faced pretty good killers, and when I hit rank 12  the first killer I faced was camping, tunelling Legion rank 17
---
I died multiple times yesterday because my teammates refused to heal me. 
---
You can all say what you want “self-care” in itself is a good perk, but having self care doesn’t mean you should hide in a corner and heal all the time. There is a time and place for everything, like every skill.
---
Yeah i did it yesterday and i have never seen it before but it’s understandable. When i first saw the meme,  Haddonfield came to my mind directly so maybe this happened someone too.
---
Looks like Quentin in drag xD
---
He’s not gonna bring anyone in the game because he acts like a toxic asshole and has already discouraged Reverse2K from playing. Or, he’s going to bring toxic assholes like him. It’s a no win situation.
---
So the way it works is that once somebody's hooked every survivor is suddenly reminded of chili which causes their stomachs to rumble and thus they are revealed
---
This is hilarious, why is this in controversial lmao
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who sometimes stares at survivors' faces while healing/doing gens. Made me see some details, like Nancy, Jane, Yui and Kate are the only survivors with eyelashes in the game.
---
CLOWN'S PROS:
---
+Clown's bottles are ranged and, if you know what you are doing, you can guide the survivor to wherever you want as they try to avoid the slowdown.
---
+Clown's bottles in general give you more freedom  of movement because you don't have to place them and can be used to prevent survs from reaching loops all together instead of just being used in loops like snares.
---
+The gas also offers visual impairment which greatly hinders the survivors' sense of direction.
---
CLOWN'S CONS:
---
-Clown doesn't have any way to track survivors other than his eyes. I guess screaming survivors from the intoxication is some kind of tracking but it's nowhere near to, say, Legion's killer instinct.
---
-Clown doesn't have map pressure and has to rely on quickly ending chases to apply pressure instead.
---
-Bottles need to reload, an action which takes too long and happens too frequently because he only has 4 of them.
---
SOMETHING ABOUT CLOWN:
---
~Clown's power is super simple to use even for starters and is very effective if you can track and end chases quickly. It's a lot of fun to play a simple killer that doesn't require intense mechanical skill to be effective like Huntress or Nurse. However, because his ability is so simple, there aren't really any interesting ways to combo his power/perks and addons. No perks really push the clown's power to it's limits and the addons, while great, just change numbers and don't offer different ways to play him maybe except redhead's pinky finger.
---
FREDDY'S PROS:
---
+Variety. Can play with either dream pallets or dream snares, both of which are deadly in the right hands.
---
+Freddy can place both instantly and without needing to reload.
---
+Snares' slowdown is a lot more potent and to reach said potency the Clown needs the flask of bleach addon.
---
+Freddy has map pressure because he can teleport to gens.
---
FREDDY'S CONS:
---
-Snares need to be placed which means they only work in loops which survivors can avoid altogether if they see that said loop is becoming unsafe.
---
-Higher rank survivors remember where pallets didn't exist and can avoid fake ones all together.
---
-Both of his secondary powers can be avoided if the survivor wakes up.
---
SOMETHING TO MENTION ABOUT FREDDY:
---
~Freddy outshines Clown in general because he can teleport to gens and has more variety to his playstyle. As for the slowdown, I personally believe both are equal yet different and come down to preference.
---
Probably Oni or Demogorgon. Their roars are intimidating.
---
When I was against any Michael I would just let them stalk me. I was so confused what they were doing, I thought they were being friendly towards me so I have them a tbag.. haha.. we know how that ended.
---
I mean if he wants to that's fine..not like there is a rulebook for not tunnelling and camping.
---
But don't get salty if survivors use toolboxes for gen rush, maps for ruin/totems, Comms via discord, DS you millions times, BT saves and body blocks, and obviously abuse loops.
---
What, I bet he is type of killer that bitches and depips and wonders why he de pips
---
like ochido his community just bread toxicity same with no0b3 so what is stopping toxic ninja and his fans from turning toxic
---
I tend to agree for the most part. Guess what happens when you don't use ruin? Yes gens will pop fast, but most survivors don't really pay attention and tend to 3 gen themselves into oblivion. I don't play with ruin and I do just fine without it. There's better perks for me to equip.
---
I am red rank/purple rank killer btw. Still can't fathom how tf I reached there without knowing something so simple.
---
The fact 2 or 3 killers are viable out of 18 after a certain rank shows how comfortable people get with the game.
---
As a killer you need to make choices all the time and they need to be RIGHT choices. Do you have time to loop this survivor? To pick them to hook or do slug to stop that gen from finishing? How to cut a loop and chase someone. If you make bad mistakes and it leads to survivors almost escaping then you will eventually learn from your mistakes but with noed its like you have this safe blanket then whats the point?
---
Specially if the game is going really bad because of the killer mistakes but they get a 4k thanks to noed. 
---
Atleast in red ranks survivors can afford good items, perks and some of them are well versed with the maps, great skill checks and loops so noed is understandable with how fast games can be.
---
Punishment for bad internet/bad performance shouldn't exist. At all. They CAN check to see if you hit disconnect or alt f4, because of the protection.(also yes they can just turn their wifi off)I see your point but any punishment, repeated or not, shouldn't happen to someone who did not actually dc.
---
LOOOOOOOOOL
---
Multiple times the game has crashed for no reason for me, and trust me, its not from performance or internet, just crashes. Blaming the player on this, is wrong.
---
LMAO! Yeah it does get thrown around quite a lot. I don’t experience them that often tbh
---
Some times its understandable, I have gone against rank 13 and 14 killers at rank 1 survivor and 1/2 dc. That is another issue in itself though. Better Que times but ruins the game for either or both side.
---
Yes, the offering is used for that trial and will be “activated” once you die. Any item you find will be kept as long as you still had in hand upon being sacrificed or mori’d
---
Wait a minute... this is just legion with the trappers body. What are you trying to pull here?
---
The megs I encounter are all really good but one did sandbag me and cause me to die the other day 🥴
---
...how...honestly
---
On another note, when are consoles getting dedicated servers + the DC banning 👀
---
obviously a claudette teachable
---
Every cosmetic that make will always and forever be available to purchase at any time. The devs said they do not want exclusive cosmetics.
---
*Looks at mobile that received some cool looking blue skins*
---
"dc banning" isnt doin fuck all on pc so dont get giddy over it
---
I read these in the DbD Samination voices.
---
it’s deterring me from playing the game at all, it’s so frustrating
---
For real? Damn dude :( quitters are legit savages I guess.
---
She's my second most played killer. I still have no problem getting 4ks. I don't see why she might need a buff at all when I play her. I think she's in a good spot how she is right now.
---
In all my time playing I came across one farming Killer, and that was only because 3 bps were offered. As for when I play Killer, I let them do 1-2 gens if there's just 1 DC then just start plating normally
---
There's no DC ban right now.
---
ppl just kill themselves on hook now
---
All killers are viable, most players are just plain bad.
---
What makes or breaks killers besides nurse or spirit is the map. Every single good player will tell you the same thing.
---
The huntress just decides to... Run into the reset pallet.
---
What was the thought process
---
Killer Mains should go on a strike.
---
YEET
---
I activated two dream snares one after the other and the freddy player just walked right past me, in fact he didn't do anything the whole match.
---
Another was a doctor who just walked right past me as i crouched literally in front of him.
---
Two survivors who decided to just crouch in front of me when playing killer. Given my shitty connection at the time i decided to just call it a day when that happened.
---
Incorrect, you can go down if you dont mend..
---
classic ps4, killers are a rare breed :(
---
Quentin face rework in a nutshell
---
on PC I said
---
When you’re getting tunneled by a P3 legion and you see that immersed baby Dwight look through the window
---
This is why i set messages to friends only as long as i'm playing dbd anyway
---
MM addons are the most noob unfriendly. I did not know there was a lumge addon? I played scratch mirror usually woth the increase in movement speed while stalking haha.
---
fix that lag tho homie
---
wait why do Keys need to be fixed?
---
That's me now. I dislike the game and just don't bother with it anymore, but I come her for a good laugh every now and then.
---
To my knowledge no solid date yet. Was supposed to be months ago... the delay better be worth it.
---
As for your original post as killer I'll farm sometimes if there is 1+ DC depending on my mood... however at high ranks with 2 DC the chance to pip is already long gone and personally I don't care if I pip or not anyway I play for amusement and blood points.
---
A big factor for me is when they DC if it is early I just want it to end and move on farming with 2 people from the get go isn't often worth the time. If the game was halfway done sure I'll farm for a few minutes and let the rest go, basically it comes down to "time vs gain" how much do I gain for my time and is it worth just moving on.
---
If I'm survivor and there are multiple DC early I'll do the same I'll find the killer or I'll just stay on a gen/cleanse totems until the killer finds me and I just don't run. The idea being get a few blood points and they farm or kill me quick so I can move on. I throw myself on their mercy as it is their trial.
---
Really well thought out reply that addresses all my points. When I say objectively, I mean in an objective sense. I'd like to hear a single reason why hillbilly's instadown/mobility is better than oni's. Not to mention billy also has a loud ass chainsaw, but it doesn't matter. Because billy is not supposed to surprise people at all, and neither is oni. Yeah, sure, you see him and hear him. What are you going to do, run away? It d oesnt matte r, he moves fast enough that whether or not the survivor notices you doesn't matter at all, unless you're one of the 2 people who still run tinkerers.
---
There isn't really any case you can make for hillbilly's power being better than a demon rage oni whatsoever (id love you to prove me wrong though). The thing that billy has over oni is the fact he always has his chainsaw. But once hes enraged; he becomes superior to billy in every aspect.
---
Dead Hard because it is the best one,when it works properly
---
Looks at Siege fucking me out of Gingerbread camo by 1 day and never bringing it back.
---
Second this messages to friends only... and turned of friends requests... don't happen often but sometimes they are so upset they send a friend request just to fill in the message section.
---
You are a good man then 👌🏼👏🏼
---
He’s a massive douche who got someone banned from fortnite for ‘stream sniping’ when the kid then proved he didn’t. He accuses everyone of stream sniping or ‘knowing who he is’ when really he just got outplayed. I personally hate him however the new players will be a nice addition because the matchmaking will be quicker, just hope they aren’t all toxic assholes like Ninja.
---
Can tell you are a low rank, you will need to learn to adapt based on killer and map. I know I will be downvoted for the truth but thats ok
---
You are wrong you keep what item is in your hand at death. It doesn't matter if you traded items with someone, found it on the ground, or went in with nothing and looted a chest.
---
As long as the item is held at death you keep it.
---
I use my white wards regularly with a chest build to farm items.
---
I use my white wards regularly with a chest build to farm items get some decent stuff.
---
I'd say being resourceful is a good strategy
---
I never EXPECT hatch for not wiggling, but BHVR adding in the wiggle points has made it into a prisoners dilemma. 
---
If I don't wiggle and get hooked, I get the tiniest bit salty that I missed out on a few blood points for no reason. Not enough to say anything, but silent mini salt.
---
Adrenaline because I've lost count how many times I got downed through a window and the last gen popped
---
Congrats, I still have 2 from the survivor side and everything killer. I thought that, I wont be able to finish it in time but now I have hope.
---
SAME LMAO
---
finally gets out of the trap before killer reaches u
---
\*honing stone activates\*
---
That huntress is the definition of forehead
---
I used to think that keys could open the exit gates 😬
---
She's my most played killer, and I honestly still disagree with people. Her dash is weak if survivors aren't total potatoes, especially if you are not running add-ons. The crouch time and speed makes any large map a nightmare to try and stealth, even with the standard M&amp;A + Whispers combo. I am amazed everytime I 4k against red rank survivors on Redwood Forest or Jungle Gym Central Rottenfields / Thompson House.
---
I don't know how I feel about her traps tbh. I am not really one for too much RNG in mp games, especially if it ends up being the deciding factor.
---
I also don't run any slowdown perks on her, because I don't agree with the game's constant focus on them. I don't think killers should have to rely on them in order to have a fighting chance, personally.
---
Pig is also the killer I have the easiest time going against as survivor, even if the Pig isn't memeing around with me and trying their heart out to win. I honestly feel bad bullying a Pig who is going for an ambush mindgame on a pallet loop and I am already at the next jungle gym.
---
If you bring in NoED, its a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. You essentially bring it in case you need it at the endgame, but bringing it along in the first place means it's way more likely that you will reach a point where all 5 gens are done, while your intention should be to completely prevent it.
---
Why is it more likely you ask? Because you brought NoED, a perk that's 100% useless for the vast majority of time you'll be in the trial, instead of bringing in it's place a game slowdown perk (PgTW, Ruin, Corrupt), or an information one (Thrilling Tremors, BBQ, Whispers), or a perk to end chases faster (Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle). If you ran one of these perks instead of NoED, the chances that the survivors will manage to complete all 5 gens are gonna be much lower.
---
Plus, it's a perk that rewards you for playing badly and overcommiting to chases you'd be better off dropping and trying to pressure gens instead. Bad game design at its finest.
---
I’ve never played killer in the higher ranks so I didn’t know this tbh. As a survivor I know you can still benefit from a farming game in the given circumstances I provided (early game with 2 survs vs killer.) I just assumed it could work well for the killer to 🤔 that sucks tbh. 
---
And yea I remember reading something a while back about the update being delayed :/ sucks how it seems we’ve been left in the dark lol
---
[YOU MISSED!!! HOW COULD YOU MISS?!? HE WAS THREE FEET IN FRONT OF YOU!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu3s9w98MYs)
---
Tbh spirit is game breaking and no skill required killer. This is an opinion of a killer main.
---
technically it's more efficient to have one self-heal and the other do a gen  since there are diminishing returns on gens
---
He is anti stealth but not that good anywhere else.
---
Super ultra mega rare offering to mori the killer
---
For like my first few weeks/month of the game that is what I thought as well.
---
"and the god pallet lived to see another day"
---
self care hasn't been 80% for a long time, it was recommended regardless though
---
I've just stopped playing killer because I'm sick of being a green rank and only going against red rank survivors
---
If youre injured though you just get exhausted and go down.
---
broke back mountain killer edition
---
Tbh as killer I’ve seen more toxic Yuis than anyone else. Claudette close second.
---
When I started the game I used to avoid touching the chests cause no one else touched them, and I thought they were for something specific and I would get yelled at for touching them. I also used to fast vault into lockers and complain when the killer knew where I was, so there's that
---
what's funny is a few years ago telling people to go dwight for prove thyself or nea for urban evasion would've been laughed at while self care would've been recommended
---
Eh, I thought Oni was fairly easy to get the hang off after a few games, and he was straight up brutal and merciless once he got his power. 
---
All it took was one bad teammate, and it won't really matter how good you are, as a Oni with his power would often be able to wreck and snowball out of control really easily.
---
Gonna get downvoted for this, but Oni deserved a nerf. He was straight up unfun to go against with his power active. You were fucked against him in the open at any distance, but you need to cover that distance to get to the next pallet.
---
Why discordance 3 tho
---
Please, please just make it so that Iri head can't be paired with belt add-ons on Huntress good god. 1 instandown hatchet is fine, but 2-3 is ridiculous. It is too much room to make error after error, especially with Huntress chucking grenades right now on dedi servers.
---
Welcome to the DbD community, if you disagree with someone, it's clearly because you main what they don't main.
---
Well, you can hear footsteps around 0:09 &amp; 0:10
---
They could have fire up or something like thrilling tremors. It’s hard to notice really. Also that new oni perk with the windows. There’s a lot for you not to notice because it’s not blatantly obvious. Shadow born too
---
A paid game with a f2p in-game shop is just ridiculous, League of Legends which is a free game has a better and more accessible in-game shop than dbd. Ridiculously pricy cosmetics, 80% of the killer and survivor roster locked which are all unlockable by either paying dlc or a month of grinding just for 1 survivor or killer.
---
I always found Dwight's perks to be the saddest. 
---
His story is about the outsider who tried to fit in and they saw him as the loner, they drugged him and left him in the woods alone during a work retreat.
---
He stumbled in to the woods to find his way out never to be seen again.
---
Now his perks are all devised for the greater good of the group. Bond, leader and prove thyself are all there not for his own selfish needs but to help as many people get out as possible. 
---
It's sad when you couple his story with his perks and even the community mocks him for being a coward when he literally needs to be on the front line for 2 of the perks to activate. He overcomes dammit... overcomes!!!
---
“Sword”
---
Because it is? Pair it up with infantry belt and you'll be ready for the slaugther.
---
I’m mad I laughed at this
---
Well it's an addon that exists in the game? Is it really that bad to have a good build?
---
It shows a lot of unfun bs survivors don’t want to deal with. Also inflates killers kills per match which negatively impacts killers getting looked at cause if they’re getting at least 2 they’re fine.
---
Seems kinda dumb to "waste" white wards on a chest build, but you do you I guess.
---
Tyler Ninja Blevins had better stay the fuck away from my DBD.
---
Most people are asleep
---
I'd like to state that it is 6am and I did this as a meme
---
Well Padded Jaws works well. If someone randomly steps in a trap the odds of you catching them in the trap are quite slim, that also doesn't happen a lot that they step in a random trap (at least not for me). You are better of chasing the into your traps, and if you do doesn't matter if they are injured or not
---
That's fair, it's just such a gamble. Even with plunderers 3 I've found so many brown/yellow items in chests.
---
I'm pretty sure the term is meghead.
---
use OoO as well and i’m sure you will
---
Exactly! Sc was amazing a year back, but now the meta shift so drastically that you don't want to waste so much time sc yourself. Many players including myself would rather do gens while injured than sc.
---
I’ve already played against a couple people who were able to sneak up on me. Definitely shocking!
---
survivors always go right through me...Especially when im standing in the centre of a thin hallway or space while my attack is cooling down
---
Yup did the same some time ago, i can't have fun and a clean profile at the same time when playing dbd.
---
There's a lot of terms for potatoe teammates/survivors I just call them megs because they tend to be embarrassingly unaware, rather like a pickle.
---
A full swf running no mither is scary
---
It's actually only about half a rotation if we start at dawn.
---
nothing has changed
---
I call them megheads because it's funnier, lol.
---
The problem with the Forever Freddy was the combination of so many compounding slowdown perks + his godlike gen pressure due to teleportation.
---
Pop, Thrilling Tremors/Sloppy Butcher, Ruin and Thano became a very common build I was seeing on Freddy at Red Ranks, usually paired with Swing Chains and Jump Rope. It honestly made me just not want to play as a survivor because of how quick interruptions were happening since the Freddy would focus on gen defending over everything else.
---
Tbf if the survivor was a real survivor they'll just see that sometimes killers tunnel when they're getting desperate or because they're a dick.
---
In those cases if I can see the other survivor is on the other side of the map using bond or signalling me that they've found the hatch... I'll let the struggle points go and allow that person to escape.
---
Am I the only one that gets really bad anxiety from playing killer? Like my heart is about to jump out my chest from beating so fast. And if I dont get everyone I feel like the biggest loser ever. Maybe its just me lol. However I do like killer better, it's just do hard for me to press "find match" because of my bad nerves sometimes :\
---
I find it interesting that Surge, Cruel Limits and Mindbreaker all sound like Doc perks. That kind of thing seems right up his sadistic alley.
---
Have you even played year 1 Dead by Daylight?
---
I am not and I don’t
---
You are making it sound like survivors only do those things when a killer facecamps which is bullshit. You can be the nicest killer in the world and still get thrown every single thing you just mentioned at you.
---
I got the game for Xmas and all ready been called camper and toxic and bad killer(I mostly play doctor). I can't find them so I bait them out like animals. It works unless there's 2 and one of them is sitting on the hatch.
---
I don't know, adding real people seems weird.
---
I finally got to level 50 on dwight!! &lt;3
---
Yeah the test is over
---
M i c h E A l
---
I don't care about pips really. If possible I'll let you escape, but otherwise I'd rather just murder you quickly and move on to a more fun match.
---
What rank is ninja? I just started playing on PC again and I'm rank 20 with over 1k hours.
---
Thicc
---
I doubt there will be any
---
They work on one killer at a time. They are now on doctor, and with 3month dlc schedule I doubt they have resources. Also I believe bubba is due to rework after as well cuz he is quite bad too
---
Remember how long it took for any rework on any of existing ones? (Nightmare, nurse, hag) 
---
Which is shitty really...but this is what happens when Devs don't know what they are doing. I really wish anyone is rev team was consistently rank1 on both sides to keep it balanced. Both sides has been saying gen speed and 2nd objectives needs to be looked into...but no instead we got ruin/PGtW as a staple in meta builds..and it's getting real stale
---
You're complaining about toxicity but you were toxic yourself. Killers don't have to follow your rules, they aren't there to entertain you either.
---
I hate YouTubers who say they are pros. Like fuck off and humble if you really are, and no Ninja, you aren’t pro, so fuck it
---
I’m fine with campers and tunnellers, I always play SWF so I know it can get hard haha
---
Rank 1 with NOED bragging about destroying a team consisting of a rank 8, rank 12, rank 13 and rank 17. Go you.
---
This really sums up most killers I see these days.
---
2 quit and pretty much every killer decides now is the time to slug for the 4k.
---
Most of them are shit players that dont get to win very often. If you get in a chase against them that becomes obvious.
---
Also love how every single one, without exception gives it the old “EZ EZ” post game too.
---
I just disconnect now. If 2 survivors have disconnected/dropped from the game then I’ve been cheated too and I refuse to waste minutes of my time slugged.
---
As in, why use it, or why level it up to 3?
---
I'll answer both I guess -- I used it because I had an empty spot and wanted to track them easier to know what gens are being done closest to the Gates and it's level 3 because why not.
---
I thought they mentioned something in their last stream about relaxing matchmaking requirements for the holidays?
---
But on another note it's all just an obvious balance issue with his game. Plenty of survivors especially those who play with friends on comms have a huge boost with no downside so you get a lot of survivors who either are good or play enough make it to red rank/purple ranks and then you end up not having enough skilled killers to fill that need. So for the sake of people getting matches you get these skilled and or teams put up against purple, green, and sometimes yellow ranks.
---
I'm rank 4 survicor on ps4 and maybe face a red rank killer 1 in every 10 matches... maybe a purple 2 of the 10 and the rest are green rank or yellow.
---
The game is apparently balanced for around rank 10 which sucks because you have those who are skilled and in red ranks and they can consistently stomp on killers and the killers in these situations feel weak or like they don't have any control. Sure it doesn't happen every match but it is happening more and more it feels like.
---
Then you have brown yellow ranks where survivors scream about everything being op because they don't know the game well yet and killers feel powerful.
---
Last week or so as a purple rank killer I've been getting consistantly rank 1/2 survivors who all magically know how to loop everything perfectly. They know how many times they can go before the drop the pallet and so on... and if I'm not playing a strong killer with a meta build well screw me I guess...
---
It doesn't make me want to play killer because I like to play a variety of killers and lets face it some killers just don't do well consistantly at high ranks.
---
And no I don't need to win evey match to have fun heck I don't even have to get a 2k... I just want some balance and have the killer feel strong at high ranks.
---
TLDR: game is horribly unbalanced... ranks 6-13 killers feel balanced. Rank 14-20 killers can feel too strong. Rank 1-5 killers often feel underpowered. Skill gap and horrible ranking and balance leaves good survivors facing killers who get destroyed to easily making less people want to play killer.
---
I respect that 🤷🏻‍♂️ for me it just feels like such a slap in the face from the game when you depip and walk away with like 4-6k bp thanks to quitters lol if that doesn’t bother you though that’s cool.
---
But Nea is right there
---
Read the chat dude, wtf.
---
I always have messages to friends only. Why in the hell would I ever want strangers or randoms in the Gaming community to message my profile ever??? Only I send requests to people I want to be “friends” with (a.k.a just expand my list and potential random play opportunities if it arises, rarely talk since I have a partner and a real-life friends circle so I don’t really expand upon anything online further than necessary.)
---
From older day experience in the PS3 times I learned people will message the ever living crap out of you acting like an inherently pathetic child just because people aren’t playing the way THEY want them to. Screw them. It’s about having fun, I personally could care less how I play because it’s about my own enjoyment, not about winning or losing which I hardly care about (unless it’s for a specific objective), it’s just about progressing and playing a game for fun. It’s not a bloody E-Sport and unless people are actually trying to get into E-Sports to build a career and make money out of turning gaming into a competitive sport, people should never be so damn toxic or serious about whether they win or lose, being upset or stressed about it speaks volumes of your mental health and I’ve never been able to relate. I’m calm in all things gaming related.
---
By all means, if they want to embarrass themselves by repeatedly proving why they never truly graduated from the Third Grade, that’s their own idiotic decision. You just do you and have some bloody fun!!!! As should everyone else, toxicity has no place in a logical and reasonable society and within the Gaming Community, it really needs to change because it’s pretty damn petty and pointless, one of the most needless downsides to Multiplayer and Online experiences. I’ll always remain in control of who can talk to me online until the day comes where people have some basic respect and learn the common sense to not take their Gaming so seriously to the point of acting like a baby, their livelihood doesn’t depend on it.
---
Same as Freddy lul
---
Demogorgon protecting the objective?
---
I remember a game against a russian streamer where I checked out his stream out of curiosity (he was the first I ever saw with twitch.tv in the name).
---
He only had a short delay (felt like 10-15s) and you bet I abused the extra information I got from that
---
If theres 1 dc early then I 3 hook everyone and give last one hatch. I try to keep everyone in as long as possible too. Not removing one until the others have been 2 hooked.
---
I think you need to play survivor to have empathy for people in this position. A lot of players clearly dont as they just use a 3vs1 as an excuse to use that extra time to camp/tunnel people out of the game and still slug to deny hatch
---
*You're* cool, u/Jay021!
---
“Uncounterable” come on man his turn rate while demon dashing is not that great so you could just outmaneuver him
---
Most people see what I see. I see a rank 1 killing low ranks with noed and then doing the classic “why are you upset LOL” trash. 
---
then you come to reddit and clog it with your oversaturated posts when literally no one cares about your after game chats.
---
I was the first one chased in Autohaven Wreckers, it was for a good 2 mins and I knew because I used 4 pallets and got bloodlusted on both hits. When I got downed, they barely did 1 gen. I was thinking it was Ruin that slowed them down, but when I got unhooked and started to work on a gen I found out there was no ruin at all.
---
You'd be surprised how good his turning was in the PTB.
---
I play Spirit at Rank 1 and you wouldn't believe the post game comments I get. My favourites are 'Reported for no phasing sounds', 'extreme tryharding' '0 skill killer,' 'camper (with 5 pips D Hope). I've never seen a game where people complain so much.
---
I know. I just get bored fighting against underwhelming Killers. I would like to actually play a Horror Game
---
Umm don't ya mean pink keys fella?
---
I played spirit a lot and I got a lot of the same messages I stopped playing her recently due to getting fed up with the buggy lunge when coming out of phase and all that. 
---
Once they fix her I’ll start playing her again.
---
Sadly at Red ranks there's only a few truly viable killers. If you can master one of them, even the best survivors don't stand a chance (especially Spirit). Otherwise you will get bullied fairly often
---
And its getting worse.
---
Had this discussion on another thread but the short if it is as rank increases and you face higher skilled survivors playing killer gets harder.
---
The game is apparently balanced around rank 10.
---
So ranks 10-20 against those who are actually at that skill level killers can feel okay or even too strong.
---
But when you get red ranks except a few killers with meta builds killers feel underpowered unless you're really good. This leads to a lot of people not having fun or sticking with killer so the game has to match skilled survivors with even lower ranked killers. Its bad the game needs better balance.
---
Its harder to be a good killer vs being a good survivor.
---
&gt;When people still think hitboxes are the issues
---
People aren't the brightest, even with all the technology at hand that can be used to search and learn things for free, they rather stay ignorant and make dumb complaints about something entirely unrelated to the issue they are trying to show.
---
Damn Girl, wish my sister could play more advanced stuff she's she's likes captains since or GTS sadly.
---
Level 1 is better because you can get more info from it.
---
I did until ash was added. Now I'm a puppet hand ash main.
---
Don't know if you're trolling and not trying to talk down to you, but *looks at patch notes* okay...
---
The game is horrendously buggy atm, especially Audio. Its an absolute mess.
---
I don't expect him to be even remotely good yet, I mean God none of us were although all the good players have had a period where they think they are "pros" only to find out they are wrong. I mostly watched Tru when I started and after the fact I know that his opinions were holding me back and I was letting them just because he had obviously played the game longer than me.
---
I'm devotion 3 and I'm currently working on mastering every killer, it's a pain but man is being a decent nurse on ps4 rewarding
---
I play almost exclusively solo as survivor and lemme tell you it's extremely hit and miss with what types of teammates you get lol
---
&gt;It's been like this since last update. The killer still did pre okay but I felt it was unfair towards them.
---
Its been like this since the release of DBD. People just refuse to understand how matchmaking works and complain nonstop so devs are always meddling with it (for better or for worse). 
---
During low or high populated times, anomalies are bound to happen just to ensure people can play.
---
That's who I'd play as well if Jeff wasn't in the game lol similar tastes it seems
---
Your first paragraph sounds like you came off the game I played in that inspired this thread 😂 The trapper was having his way with us whether we liked it or not. 
---
But yea I hear you. People can be assholes sometimes. I’m still gonna try and stick around after DC’s just to see if I can benefit a bit from the game.
---
Adorable. Cute.  Perfect execution 10/10, would use as wallpaper
---
I've adjusted some of the graphics settings and now it's the most visible of maps for me. I love these maps as killer now.
---
Just another day in DbD.
---
Although Legion is not good, they are fun to play and do a pretty good job of juggling multiple targets. IMO, I think half of playing killer is learning how to play as a killer and the other half learning the specific character.
---
*demodoggy noises*
---
He’s always played other games.
---
Fortnite right now extended its current season by several months. This caused a lot of players to take a break as there isn’t much to work for right now.
---
Legion:I am speed
---
A toddler could 4k with insta hatchets.  Some addons just go to far man
---
As a huntress main, that throw hurt my soul.
---
I'm a Rank 1 Spirit and keep getting matched vs Green Ranks and Purple. It's the absolute worst experience, like playing mindless bots. Literally had a game last 50 seconds as they all rushed for hook saves Vs STBFL.
---
There was a time when this community wasn't toxic.
---
It's more beneficial for the game to promote fun/fair gameplay and bring in people with that mindset rather than the usual 12yo tbag toxic bs.
---
When I firat started out as killer, it took me 50+ hours to finally feel like I stood a chance against the people I got matched with.
---
The pure amount of unadultered shit you have to eat to get going as killer is mindblowing and requires at least some masochism to keep at it.
---
It felt like banging my head against a concrete wall on a daily basis: without any meta perks and with the god aweful matchmaking at low killer ranks, you already want to quit. Some games I'd look at the lobby and go "Ok this will suck" just from seeing the outfits they had.
---
But then there's the BM and boy is it something in this game: if you lose, you get taunted, teabagged and insulted. If you bring NOED to down at least one of the teabagging clowns at the gates, you get death threats or people wishing cancer on you.
---
I'm still not quite sure how I managed to stick with the role until I finally started dominating some of those cunts and the game actually being fun
---
Bingo, that's what I'm talking about. As a red rank  survivor this is what I do. It makes me wonder though, why did you come back killer? You had enough sense to know I had DS that gen is almost done or is done. Why did you waste that time?  
---
I recently had this game where I got off hook and went back to my gen that was 90 percent and finished it while hearing Billy coming. He got there it was done I had 40 seconds on DS so looked at him. He downed me and got DS and he knew there was a window and I had lithe. He DC at that moment but again I wonder why did you even come back?
---
Which sword are we talking about 🤔😏
---
Yeah, I am trolling about how impossible it was to win as killer when the game first came out. You caught me. It has never been harder to win as killer as it is now ^^^^^^^^^^/s
---
Might not have actually been him because it was a long time ago but someone with his username was the first to die to my basement Trapper.
---
Ye.
---
Don't know if that's important or if you care but huh... I don't know how to end this comment.
---
Never watched Ninja before until now and all bad gameplay aside, he's just very unentertaining and childish. His commentary is simple and boring, he's bad but unwilling or unable to learn, and overall I'd rather watch fun people who know what they're doing like No0b3 or something. Not to mention Jess is not good either, but far more annoying.
---

---
Hag is legit the only killer that still scares the absolute shit out of me sometimes. Lol
---
You're not supposed to be sneaky but you can this isn't a stealth game and you should learn how to loop because that's one of the basic things needed so you can do good in chases and doc is not that good at looping
---
Is it bad that I actually do that? Like not to be toxic but if I get a pallet dropstreak I get just like that ... hightest drop streak in a match was 6
---
The problem with self care is that it really isn't the way one should go about getting healed. Yeah, it's important to not be injured and to be independant about it, but SC is too inefficient. Bring a medkit along, or run Inner Strength to also take care of totems along the way and benefit your team.
---
Doctor can manipulate electricity to make you go insane.
---
Since when has a character having their own game prevented them from being included in DBD?
---
The thing is that you're in a game with four other people. They are going to suffer if someone disconnects, regardless of the reason, with no guarantee that they'll not get the same thing next game. If you punish the person that disconnects, it incentivises them to do something about it: to find out why they are disconnecting. Either work out what's wrong with their install or machine or find how to reproduce a crash and help the devs fix it. If there's genuinely nothing they can do, it does suck, but imo that's a price BHVR should be willing to pay for the sake of the other players.
---
And if there's a way around the punishment, people will find it and abuse it. As you said, someone could unplug their router or ethernet cable to fake their internet dying. Somone could find how to reproduce a crash and not report it so it stays as a "safe disconnect." Hell, people just died on first hook to get out of the game quickly during the test.
---
The only other solution BHVR has is to have people working full-time jobs monitoring reports and disconnects, and manually handing out punishments. But this is slow, subject to human error, and expensive.
---
There isn't a right answer, the devs just have to test and find out what works best for them. People will suffer and complain no matter what they choose.
---
Well then I'm afraid your eyes are foggy with one-sided ignorance. My point of this post is to show all you 'Legion is boring' or 'Killers are OP' Survivors that it doesn't matter what rank you are, what Killer you play against or if you're SWF -- the skilled and tactical Win. And if you're bitching about NOED, you clearly aren't playing the game right as a Survivor -- I played perfectly, got them all to final hook, let them do gens furthest away from Gates and only left two Survivors to finish the final Gen before I downed them with NOED and opened the gates to complete my damn Challenge.
---
That's a GG all-round. Sorry you can't see that and decided to side with literal losers.
---
Holy shit this is next fucking level
---
How do you know when the killer gets bloodlust? As a survivor I mean
---
Head On and Lithe would mean you have to be hiding in there locker for 40 seconds!?
---
I think it's sarcasm.
---
you just have to find your favorite play style, i, for example, LOVE stealth games, so being able to stalk survivors before going for the kill as ghostface, is right up my alley. just takes a minute to analize what kind of player you are, and the killer will fit you like a glove.
---
Switching to killer is he?
---
Horrifying
---
“It’s difficult to play survivor” lol i play survivor when i want to de-stress from playing killer. Survivor is alot easier than killer imo.
---
Yeah that's Claudette's teachables
---
u/Goldwolf25 hi sorry for the tag I know this is an old post but where the hell did you find DBD vrchat models (judging by Yui's animations might be wrong sorry if so)?
---
If i white ward, then you franklins and i die withot the item in my hand do i keep it
---
Its every game where 2 dc/get kicked early. The killer will always slug. I get they want their points/pip but at that point im pissed off that ive been screwed too and Im not wasting a few mins on the floor while the killer looks for the last survivor who is immersed at the edge of the map.
---
If they earned their 4k then sure but these games were handed to them on a plate.
---
I can see survivor numbers dropping once the dc penalty comes in. Nobody wants to put up with crap like this.
---
What’s your point
---
If they never break the pallet and keep on chasing you around it and they’ll become the speed of fucking Usain Bolt
---
Can I just say -- I find it atrocious that many of you will read the endgame chat and not bat an eye at the fact that the Survivor is clearly being Toxic AF, which really shows the juxtaposition around here.
---
Stop Maining a side people, that's the real toxicity.
---
Idk what y’all are doing but I’m sitting on the corner of the map self caring because the killing has sloppy butcher
---
When you take a pallet to the face
---
Clown should have the option to either throw the bottle to do whatever it does or drink and gain supernatural vision or movement speed or something.
---
 Ah I gotcha so you just know by your own intuition. I was wondering if the game had any sorta blood point notification or something from the survivor aspect that let them know
---
No solution yet, everyone on switch is affected who change controls.
---
There had been at least 2 patches and bhvr did fk all :(
---
Billy:Really nigga?
---
Yeah I wish there was some sort of feature, but just remember, this is behaviour we’re talking about
---
Lol They didn't? Why?
---
well, i agre with you on this one, survivors have a much easier time playing the game the way it was intended, but as killer you have the responsability to make it fun for everyone, afterall you are the power role and the game will revolve around the mechanics of your specific killer. 
---
The "i would never do that" part is a moral code, if i'm playing survivor i'd get pissed if a killer started face camping me, so i know how is like when it happens to them, this is just standard stuff but if i gotta do something else on the other part of the map i'll go but if they are right on my face after i hook someone forget about me leaving.
---
I have officially given up on playing the ghost face, I hate this killer more than legion, I've been playing for 8 hours, it's mid day, I'm moving on. You win, have a gold award.
---
*pixels
---
Again you’re bragging at you as a rank 1 destroyed a team of noobs. Do you want a medal?
---
Not sure how your post proves anything either. “Legion is boring, killers OP” umm how does your post prove either of those either way? Maybe the survivors found him boring, maybe not. Also “skilled and tactical win” yeah it sounds like you as a rank 1 went pretty hard on them. First message you get seems to be a translation of “unnecessary.
---
4 noobs get stomped by a rank 1 and message you sounding like they were unhappy and hard done by. No shit.
---
Again, go you. You demolished that rank 17! That will teach that noob to dare enter your lobby!
---
I don’t know what ranks y’all play at but I play purple-red survivor and I rarely see toxic post game chat.
---
Hate to burst your self-righteous bubble, but your explanations bore me almost as much as your post. I’m actually a killer main, so you should stop pretending the game is hard for killers. You lose against the top 5% and usually win against the other 95%. 
---
I don’t care what you did or didn’t do in the match. You’re clogging up my sub with useless posts that prove nothing except what we already know — killing low ranks means literally nothing. 
---
Also, I can promise you didn’t play perfectly. Your post doesn’t show me anything you mentioned. Play a match against the top 5% and tell the skill and tactical always win. Your unfamiliarity with this game shows.
---
I see low ranks who aren’t very familiar with the game with one sending you a very non-toxic, non-threatening message. If you believe that makes someone a literal loser, then the only literal loser here is you. Your style of speech is boring, you brag on killing low ranks, and you post chat messages on this sub. Not only is your gameplay extremely boring, but your post has no value AND your assumptions are awful. 
---
I understand you are unable to play well against those who know the game so you gain a power trip off the very weak. Not a good look. I’ll see ya around, boss.
---
No changes needed.
---
I have played on high on low on ultra IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCES
---
yup, you have to prepare for the worst case scenario even if you are going to play nice, even tough you can read what kind of players you are going against in the lobby.
---
Just get a group of people to boost it with you. Invite 3 other people and a killer who isnt going to kill you.
---
They ain't good for much else...
---
Keys have addons to protect them
---
The only thing I personally would use then to protect is a really good toolbox.
---
Got to do something with all the extra white wards.
---
get a swf make sure the 4th guy is getting chased do all gens and then go run around until u find the hatch call for ur friends and escape
---
Nice, it’s weird but find the pig sort of cute... I think Iv just been brainwashed by all the piggy memes though 😂
---
Something is definitely wrong today. 2 games crushed the moment it began coz connection issues, the 3rd one was inredibely laggy and plague was vomiting non-stop lol. Ofc that game crushed as well.
---
Hope it wont be one of those “entire day with a connection issue” events.
---
It happens but I don't find much of a good use for them except protecting a good toolbox.
---
I second that
---
I personally stand in the exit gate if not everyone's escaped yet, because then the killer must either force me out (wasting their time for one or two hits) or risk me being able to go back into the map and help.
---
I try not to be toxic, but some people unfortunately think I'm waiting to teabag and start doing so
---
Hes pissed off that he got wrecked due to shit matchmaking. Which is no different to the hundreds of posts we get on here daily about green rank killers being put against a team of red rank survivors.
---
Matchmaking blows and people are unhappy that they are being out against much more experienced players. Who would have guessed?
---
So you love a russian facecamping you ?
---
ruin is for baby killers who are unvilling to git gut but still pretend they are hot sht.
---
*Dead by dawn!*
---
In my opinion, progression should be David to 40, then bill to 40, then Laurie to 40. Starting with David get dead hard and wglf. Use wglf to get bill up quick. Then on your Bill you will have dead hard, wglf, unbreakable, and borrowed time. Then do the same with Laurie but eventually replace wglf with decisive strike and you have a top build.
---
Okay.
---
M O N T O
---
No, I just love to hate the solo survivor experience.
---
Hexy seems like a class A douchebag.
---
Hahahaha! Cool that you're teaching your bro! 
---
'Woo~So that's the Hag...' LMAO! XD
---
OMG haha, 
---
I thought you was just being a dick and was gonna downvote you but actually that’s quite funny 😂.
---
I hate the swamp so much
---
No audio sorry, Shadowplay didn't capture...
---
Gather swf. Use the Springwood offering (I prefer this map bc it’s not too hard to find hatch with the layout) . Use meta perks (DS, BT,OoO, etc), if extra toxic  everyone takes a key (w/ring add on preferably). GL
---
I’m a ponytail Jeff main and PROUD. I never see another Jeff in my lobbies either lol
---
Imagine floating and being slower than a dude with a belly that you could probably fit inside of
---
* Sloppy Butcher, Dying Light, Thanatophobia and everyone is injured. You're almost finished!
---
Then, that Nea just fast-vaults next to you to get the sweet sweeeet healing points; as you got exposed by that dummy cleansing Haunted Grounds even though there was no Ruin or Huntress Lullaby announced.
---
I got 2 private messages on match yesterday after failing to save a hook by seconds and then I later died myself :( 
---
I opened them and to my surprise the hooked survivor said GG and thanks, and called me legend for trying anyway, and the other message was simply a GG and added me as a friend 
---
Woahhh! 😍
---
“Mind blown!”
---
I wish they would implement some system that allowed you to trade in offerings or add-ons for BP, like very small amounts. I have over 500 Brown offerings on most killers that just collecting dust.
---
First two are fine, but I feel like enduring and SF can be replaced with better perks. I have seen nurses, SB, thana, CI used on him for a strong combo.   
---
You said you want to a lot of pressure, so SB and thana last seem to fit you more.
---
The problem is that you main killer. In order to become a better killer you have to try to play survivor, that's how I stopped tunneling and camping even tho It's ”satisfying” seeing toxic survivors ragequit. Ayrun is a good example, hence why he's a god survivor and killer.
---
Thank you for sharing. I never knew Dwighty boy had such 𝘥𝘦𝘱𝘵𝘩.
---
Honestly I can't believe that someone is using this argument, but here I am...
---
"Wow guys you know what damn since it was so easy for killers in that first year. For the next 3+ years let's just start nerfing every killer into the ground! Let's make being a survivor really easy just to balance it all out!"
---
Yes what a brilliant idea... /s 
---
(Some years later down the line)
---
"You know what since it has been so easy for survivors for the past couple of years... Let's need survivors into the ground!"
---
Me: *head desk* *head desk*
---
What's the point of you bringing up it was easy to play Killer when the game FIRST came out...?
---
I hope you see where your reasoning fails...
---
Nah, that's why you should enter locker or make killer grab you when you know you won't escape
---
Honeslty survivors that are toxic probably never play killer. They just don't understand how it feels to get bullied. I've had 2 weeks brake lately. After that I started playing Trapper. Never got entity displeased but I've encountered so much toxicity I'm thinking of having a brake again.
---
Because his playerbase are on average physically 12 years old and mentally 4 years old? Ninja coming to DBD is like dumping 12 pounds of gasoline soaked manure on a dumpster fire. The fire is now even bigger and stinks even worse.
---
Name has nothing to do with dbd.  Imagine calling someone a biased survivor main from their name. Yikes.
---
I shall try to spread your wisdom.
---
A plague who was AFK, as the survivors we naturally decided to stand close to her and try to point at her to death.
---
She then game to life and we all shat bricks and scattered.
---
*John Carpenter appears behind you with a keyboard and start rocking dat beat*
---
Or make survivor have to 2pip as well
---
Thank-you for proving my point.
---
nice adrenaline at the end (teammate)
---
Dude as long as they take out those stupid luck bags. Nothing ruins a good bp splurge then having to waste em on a chalk bag. The only worthy luck offering is salty lips.
---
Many people (killers AND survivors) think that  it’s not fair that multiple people can just escape with little to no effort, especially if they do poorly in the match. I have even heard the hatch referred to as a “single player mechanic in a multiplayer game” which is not wholly incorrect.  
---
A number of people are pushing for one key equals one escape as well as moris only working after second hook.
---
What are you talking about? I am pretty sure Spine Chill's description does say that it helps with vaulting. It was like that since I remember.
---
32 seconds to heal, without sloppy. One gen takes 80 seconds at base, no perk influence or toolboxes.
---
Lol at facecamping russians :) 
---
I wonder if there are specific tendencies and differences to the way you play depending on where u from. 
---
Forexample i keep running into arabs that tricks you into thinking you are all farming, but it turns out they were using you for their interst only. I literally get farm invites pregame that absolutely gets nowhere but me dying on the hook once the game starts :)
---
I think it’s because most of us try to play fair and have fun, but also most of us have been accused personally of being called toxic at one time or another, so you sub consciously feel the need to defend yourself when reading a post about a toxic behaviour you have been accused of at one time or another.
---
Maybe? I dunno I made that up but it sounds legit at least.
---
What does grinding bps have to do with toxicity
---
Yeh both sides can be toxic, both sides tend to whine and complain about the other. But tbh from experience I can confirm survivors can tend to be entitled.
---
Do not make calls to action against other players.
---
ESPECIALLY not other ponytail jeffs
---
&gt;You’re clogging up my sub
---
LMAO calls someone else self-righteous then goes on with this arrogance. I'm sure OP's so sorry that your precious reddit experience was ruined, we'll be sure to cater this entire sub just for your experience from now on.
---
Why tf Meg inside adam
---
When you fool the killer it is great but most of the time the killer looks at you like "wtf I am not fooling for that"
---
Except that you can't after the hotfix. It's more like 30-45 degrees
---
The shirt makes it all the better
---
I’m EU red rank killer and queues are always under 10 seconds for me.
---
For me it's the other way, survivor red ranks on console is a bitch. Killers? High ping. Survivors? Crackheads. Tbf, I'm not in red ranks as killer this season so it would be alot less stressful.
---
You don't only focus on healing allies for a measel small portion of bp "to grind bp" on one challenge, you take We're Gonna Live Together and Borrowed Time (or We'll Make It). Prove Thyself, and other bp gain perks for survivor to grind BP.
---
As killer you're gonna take distressing and/or BBQ not try to only focus on hooking 4 survivors in the basement for a single win condition.
---
The idea that you think these challenges are for "grinding bp" further proves my point when they made you think they were a reliable way to farm points. You directly ignore the objective of the game for less points than you would of prioritizing the objective with a farming build.
---
But I guess adding Jaws as a new killer would be asking a lot. 😂😂😂
---
We should not have to activate them to get them completed. They should just auto complete if we meet the requirements in some matches.
---
Also, stop with the "must be completed in one match" and ridiculous number requirements.
---
At least that is a counter to legion
---
This is some s tier editing.
---
Yes! I posted this the day before cursed legacy came out, I've made another post with just Oni &amp; Yui if you want a preview.   
---
The link I posted is updated with all the current characters!
---
With less of a major change, maybe make it so that you can gain tokens while self healing, to a maximum of 1,2,3.
---
and/or make it work with medkits
---
An Oni that gets consistent downs with Blood Fury means survivors cannot loop or juke him. I'm an Oni main because let's be honest, he is fun asf. But I've played survivors that made me look like a plastic bag in the wind, helpless. I can tell you playing Oni has made it so easy to learn how to not die to Oni. Even getting caught in the open has a chance out. Just run towards and diagonally away at the last second. I can count on one hand how many times I was downed by Blood Fury vs the couple dozen times I faced Oni grinding dailies.
---
Survivor Farming Build

You're welcome.

Normally I wouldn't feel sorry for Basement Bubba's but I image the poor dude is just trying to complete the final Tome challenges.
---
If they add James I swear I will become a survivor main
---
its not a ''good'' build. Its an Op and unfun build to go against. Same as keys, moris, old omega blink, old legion with franks mixtape, and many more op shit that needs to be nerfed.
---
Do you think these people forget they’re playing a video game to have fun?
---
Enjoy while it lasts! jk, welcome!
---
Idk who that streamer is but looks just like Dwight
---
People really don't know how to feel about Legion do they. He is either OP or the worst killer in the game.
---
Best killer in the game? Shitty teammates. 
---
 Best killer you can play? I'm enjoying ghostface
---
Lol no offense, but sop saying she’s trash. Youre just trash (with her)
---
Silent Hilll dlc would be litty! dayum...
---
Aww. Sorry you didn’t get the praise you were looking for.
---
Hag, she's both fun and strong when played right, not the strongest but still really good
---
Then don't be surprised when someone calls you a scum.
---
Get gud nerd
---
How are you gonna know you’re up against that killer?
---
Why would you care about the survivors' experience -____- . You are a killer not an entertainer, use whatever you want because survivors sure do the same. If it's OP so be it, I payed BPs to buy it and will use it.
---
Legion go stabby real good
---
Unfortunately, yes. Most Survivors are big babies with small brains lol
---
That too.

Greatest to play I say trapper fun and rewarding but just best killer in the game is nurse boring and OP and not rewarding
---
I think we just need underwear and or swimsuit skins for everyone ASAP
---
Lol, gotta check him out
---
I love this thank you. 😂 Bubba is my least favorite to go against
---
Nurse is just the best killer in the game, she has great chase potential as she can basically ignore most defenses. She also has great map pressure being able to teleport you know. Another really good killer is spirit, she is kinda like Nurse but more mind gamey. But you can make any killer work if you just play right.
---
*laughs in Ghostie Main*
---
* Submissions not directly related to Dead by Daylight.
---
I’ve thought about hag, just haven’t got around to leveling her up
---
Any tips for playing nurse?
---
see u say that but even if ur hard to see it doesnt mean I can already see anything to begin with it is like fighting wear black in a pitch black room it doesnt matter does it
---
Oh for sure! You should try to convince her to play one round of dbd just to see if she likes it!
---
Fair fair, I’ll check out trapper!
---
Did I miss something?
---
I actually felt pretty good
---
Recently played list shows past players in previous matches and in que players with the killer.
---
Im a survivor main who plays a decent billy and its usually a slaughter from grey to green with hex ruin. The couple sweaty teams here and there just don't dent my rank enough to even worry about it. 
---
The real killer is how boring playing killer is. Feels so lonely even compared to solo Q.
---
That’s no 4head... that’s a 7head!
---
At last he is dbd killer. What are you?
---
You are not wrong. But this is usually type that bitches a lot. Tunnelling and camping is a strat as is every tool that survivors have too. But it's fine when they camp and tunnel, but insta blind flash is toxic? ¯\_( ͠° ͟ʖ °͠ )_/¯
---
Not saying this is great balance wise tho..the game does favour survivors when competent team goes against competent killers. But that's another reason not to tunnel and camp anyway if you want to win as a killer
---
I just want the game over, usually that means killing the remaining survivors. Sitting there for 5 gens farming is just boring
---
Pipping is nonsensical anyway, red ranks pipping is ridiculous and not a reflection of skill in anyway.
---
do i need the sekelton key or is the dull key fine too? (because in the text stand i need the skeleton key)
---
Looking at your previous post where you were bullying a new player this post makes alot more sense.  
---
You’re just one those asshole survivors who finally exposed themselves on Reddit. The only difference between you and those other toxic manchildren is that you’re dumb enough to show everyone how much of a cunt you are.
---
As a freddy main, I am honored you put her with nurse and spirit and I also have to disagree. Freddy DOES NOT Have the power to get free hits at safe loops like spirit and nurse can. Rather he can use his slowdown to force players to drop the pallet early (only if they are asleep of course where nurse and spirit can use their power at will) if anything he is more similar to clown in that regard but with much better mobility.
---
I would certainly say hes top tier, but a strong looper can loop a strong freddy. A lot longer than a strong nurse. He cetianly does not fall into the category of "just hope they're bad"
---
"Heart just skipped a beat" situation.
---
For me it's actually the opposite:
---
* Maybe I don't have to play killer?
---
* Maybe I can play survivor sometimes?
---
* 20 min lobbies @ getting tunneled @ Bing Bong dances around the hook creating his music
---

The devs said on the stream the other day they were looking into reworking how looping works in the game. They said they’re getting rid of jungle gyms (except for L and T walls) and reducing the number of pallets on all maps. They said they’re aiming at having 10-15 pallets per map at most.
---
Also, they’re nerfing God pallet
---
Because there is another person playing that survivor, because i actually try to have fun and i want everyone to have fun as well. If i wanted to tryhard and win every game i would use OP addons, but whats the point? Its not fun or rewarding winning when you have such a big advantage over your enemies.
---
mmm yes, dull totems, bloodpoints mmm
---
The only time slugging is toxic is when the killer just lets survivors bleed out to waste their time.
---
Don’t know about 14k being a devotion level cheif
---
Dati deesu done datu cheap
---
purple and up works
---
He did it on regular matchmaking too though.
---
Yeh a skeleton key will help
---
he has a couple times ik that but when he did the legion one he was doing it on KYF
---
What are you talking about?
---
From the beginning I said that it used to be damn near impossible for killers to win during the first year. I don't know how you manage to construe that as "it was easy to play Killer when the game first came out", but congratulations, you did.
---
The reality is that Killers have had a much easier time winning now than before. That is reality, so this whole idea of "it's almost like the devs are making the game to easy for the survivors. Oh wait..." is objectively wrong.
---
I would love to see you play killer during the days where there 2-3x as many pallets, vacuum pallets and vaults, no entity blocker, no EGC, no bloodlust, no exhaustion, no falling stun, no ruin and no hook regeneration.
---
Yup. Its sure annoying when you try hooking a survivor and they just sit there in front of it all day where you cant move. By then when you try smacking that survivor the one you're holding gets loose
---
Whispers would work decently well as it is not only helpful outside of this combo but it also means that if you hit the obsession and they run using the sprint burst, you can use it to find survivors working on gens around the map. Worth using it.
---
Not sure what else would be a good perk to amplify the combo
---
It's basically just saying "I should be able to do this thing and have no repercussions"
---
She’s very tedious to learn tbh. I would instead play as Spirit or Billy. Freddy is also a solid choice
---
Its gettin easier to be a killer out here
---
...r u suggesting survivors that know how to loop r toxic? wow...killer player (im assuming) that instead of evolving and learning how to end chases efficiently instead expects from BHVR to nerf looping....pfff. Once again BHVR making the game even more annoying for the survivor...I am wondering though, instead of reworking the tiles...why dont they fix their early shitty map design...just a thought! :
---
Well that's a but dumb
---
Everyone in red ranks sweats their ass of and uses  meta only perks and you seriously believe that there is room there to care about the person behind the survivor? If you refuse to use addons which are fun because they are &lt;&lt;OP&gt;&gt; then you are missing out on a huge part of the game and on builds that are arguably more fun that being nice needlessly. Using &lt;&lt;OP&gt;&gt; builds on smaller ranks is overkill, yes, and douchy but in red ranks, there is no &lt;&lt;having an advantage&gt;&gt; because everyone uses their perks and abilities to their max potential.
---
Holy shit that sounds crazy. It would be lit if it gave the clown more speed at the cost of being partially blinded by pink drunkness effects
---
Imagine thinking looping is toxic 😂
---
It’s so weird. Everyone says Nea’s the toxic survivor, but when I play as her, I always end up doing 4 of the 5 gens myself.
---
Imagine playing Scratched Mirror Myers on Autohaven maps because some Survivor thought it would be a great idea to bring a map offering.
---
I don't know if it is good, or bad
---
I’m kidding man. OP is just messing around

*whew*
---
I thought I did this twice before, but didn’t realize it had to be during a chase. My first one wasn’t. I wanted to scream and cry.
---
Alright
---
You do understand op is kidding right? The devs haven’t said anything on the subject.
---
same. Seem logical to me to let alive people who fight to live rather than people who don't try.
---
Imma see if she's interested she's not to good at scary stuff some times and chucks the remote so I'll see
---
Have you ever played the fucking game as a Nurse / vs a Nurse? She's not "teleporting" and she's not traversing through space "instantly". It takes her actual time to fly through solid objects.
---
I only got this challenge done because of a farming Freddy. 20+ matches later it was such a relief... though definitely more satisfying to accomplish these during a real match.
---
I heard they're going to add a New Chapter based on the Notflix hit series "Weird Stuffs" . Can't wait to play with my boy Stevie. I also hear the Assassin is a really cool one, The DemonGordon
---
If they dont give up on hook they will just afk. You can’t force them to play no matter what you do. Probs best to have them out of the game so that maybe hatch will spawn at the end if enough gens are done.
---
I wouldnt be against removing struggle though. A bit of lag and it stops you struggling for a second then sacrificed. For me I use dualshock 4, if I accidentally hit the touchpad it brings up the menu which stops me struggling and again I get sacrificed. If anything at all comes between you and mashing the button in that phase then you’re dead.
---
Threesome booping
---
eldritch creatures hate them! find out how 5 survivors said **no** to the trials and just had a nice time instead!
---
I think the devs are aiming for 25-35 per map at the current rate
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
The only time I say something is when someone is like “looping is toxic” or “he slugged me to get the survivor that was 3 feet away from me” people don’t have a clue what toxicity in dbd is lol
---
[I made a comparison video](https://streamable.com/64b8u) (1.2 seconds insta wind-up, 1 second deafult wind-up) to see how much of a difference instas actually make. I get that all the milliseconds count in this game but saying these addons go too far, I completely disagree
---
I think it's better to bring a perk that stops them from getting 5 gen but you do you homie if you went perkless survivor's would still complain.
---
Never personally played Ghostface, but I know a couple of players that main him and he seems very fun. And in my opinion, it's a challenge to play against a good Ghostface, which makes it worth even more!
---
I'm a firm believer that if you have the time to stop and tbag on a loop, then maybe the loops are too strong.
---
Is there a rise in face camping huntress all of a sudden or I'm just really high.
---
A few matches later, had a killer who wanted to help, and he stood at a pallet waiting for someone to hit them. A little too late for me on that one. :/
---
Seriously? Reducing the amount of pallets is exactly not what they should do. Good lord, Bhvr really is an awful company.
---
Play the game how you want, people might not agree with that but that their faults for expecting something out of you.
---
NOED is to Survivors what DS is to Killers. Basically, they hate the absolute fuck out of it.
---
I once wanted to give the killer a free hit since I made it to the exit gate, and so I ran to him... He NOED'd me and hooked me lol.
---
2ho the fuck doesn't break pallets and only bloodlustes lmao
---
"you want to put that *where*?"
---
Guess people who down vote me strongly disagree xD
---
There is a VRChat world called "entitys realm" that has a ton of DBD avatars. You can also just search "dead" in the worlds tab and find it. That's where I get the avatars for my videos.
---
Ehm, nurse is still good tho. She only has higher skill required now.
---
Umm yeah, no. I'm not missing out on anything by not using op addons, im having more fun by using the memey ones. If you're good enough you don't even need addons to get to rank 1. I've started using only meme addons for the past 4 seasons and I've gotten to red ranks every time. If you need addons to carry you you shouldn't be in red ranks at all.
---
Oh girl that makeup is terrible
---
Freddy: can teleport, bamboozle and shhut down loops
---
Legion: i can injure people and then injure them again and again and again and then they do gens and escape
---
I don't play her, you seems very boring to play once you now how to play. Just play games I guess
---
Tried that challenge 4 times yesterday. In all but one the last survivor dced going down the basement stairs...
---
Oh pft a misread on my part unless you re edited? Or maybe you should grammar better I read the first post as if you were saying it was easier for killers in season 1. (Running HB yeah I can see that.) 
---
Besides the point though I am objectively right though when I say they're making it easy for survivors because *that's what they're clearly doing* . *Face palm* Y'know what I'm just going to agree to disagree. However you're seeing it is you i guess? 
---
And again it still makes no sense to use the back in the day argument. *Sighs* that's like saying man remember when they used to put slightly more poison I my drink? Damn I remember those days sucked. Atleast they're putting 5% less poison dude. *High fives*
---
Otr I have been playing since DbD came out. I don't know what DbD you played but idk I don't even care because I'm not going to change your mind.
---
Huntress, for the rewarding gameplay 
---
Also, use glowing concoction on a cold wind farm maps, it's makes landing the second hatchet easier threw the corn.
---
Vore_irl
---
but the purple key also works?
---
Now I want a Valentine killer now, or Nurse can clone herself and sponged survivors out of existence.
---
so the purple key also works?
---
NOED is a b*tch perk, tbh, and gets you into the habit of not defending gens. 
---
Besides this, you need to run perks which make up for their weaknesses. For 90% Killers, that's a lack of gen-pressure. This is the case with Myers, but he's also bad at loops. What he's doesn't lack, however, is lethality. Never run insta-down perks on insta-down Killers, as it's a wasted slot.
---
For Myers, I'd recommed either;
---
Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, Enduring and Spirit Fury.
---
Or
---
Ruin, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Infectious Fright and Thrilling Tremors.
---
oh you thought THATS why i wasn’t wiggling. i just give up 🤣
---
Me but with killer queues
---
Took it with the Hag, riddled all crappy places with traps so people can't just run away if they wiggle out.
---
Meanwhile Survivor, you could do absolutely nothing the whole match and wait for the hatch. Or escape with like 7,000 points after your team does all the heavy lifting. I was able to get all of the Survivor Adept achievements back-to-back in a single night without dying once besides on David since no mither is a pain.
---
Survivors should have escaped tiers. Like how Killers have different outcomes.
---
Escapes
---
Depip = Selfish Escape (Entity Displeased)
---
Black Pip = Lucky Getaway
---
1 Pip =  Made it out
---
2 Pip = Perfect Getaway
---
Sacrifice
---
Depip = A Quick death.
---
Black Pip = Brutal Sacrifice
---
1 Pip = Almost made it
---
2 pip = Heroic Sacrifice.
---
Adept Survivor = Using only their 3 teachables, attain A Perfect Getaway or heroic sacrifice.
---
 Either that or make Adept killer only require a 4K. Either way I think the new survivor Escape system that I listed above should be implemented. It would give the survivors more goals and encourage altruistic or selfless play. And it would just make you feel better seeing Perfect Getaway. I know after a bad match I would smile seeing "heroic sacrifice" instead of just "sacrificed"
---
It is man stand still don‘t loop please
---
Oh that's interesting! I play both sides and I don't know if I want a rework of the Killer shack. Yes it's strong and yes the pallet is strong, but it's often also the place of the basement. And that in mind I don't want a heavy nerf of the Killer shack.
---
one word: “Bloodlust”
---
Demogorgon mains rise up
---
Because farming is a long, tedious process and people would rather get into another match ASAP
---
The sheer arrogance of these people.
---
I'm not saying this would be the solution to everything, but it is one less quit option. If they AFK the killer can still third hook their bodies, because the killer is also suffering when people just die on their second hook. Playing for the hatch is just a gamble of whoever finds it first and it shouldn't be played that way. 
---
And yeah, struggling in general is very inconsistent, even on PC. Sometimes I spam the spacebar with two hands and for some reason it doesn't register a single hit between the 0.5 seconds that I'm spamming it and boom, I am dead.
---
LOL that’s hilarious. To be fair though, my heart was POUNDING the first few times i played dbd lol
---
Also, the "Skilled Huntress" achievement is harder on console due to he lack of accuracy and presistokn, still it IS possible, I seen it completed before.
---
Multiple words : "god loop", "infinites", "unmindgameable loops"
---
Considering some maps have more pallets than gen time, some could use a few less.
---
Good choice of controller, even if I dont agree with using controller on a game like this. 
---
But yeah, I also think they should remove or change how you struggle. Its annoying, and literally just makes it so I cant play the game too long cuz I'll get tired quicker because Im mashing spacebar so much.
---
if you are at loops long enough to gain bloodlust, youve already lost vs decent rank1 players.
---
Yes my dude. If you have one that you’re not ready to part with, there’s an add on to prevent loss in case of death and an add on to spare the key once used.
---
BHVR need to make struggle phase automatic. That'd stop this.
---
Where was the survivors who shouldve evolved and adapted to nurse and spirit? but nah, lets just nerf them instead. Oh wait, some things are actually overpowered and needs nerfs.
---
Just realized I'm straight getting down voted by people that probably play survivor and bits of Killer, I don't have no beef with y'all though so whatever. My beef is with developers crazy way of "balancing" the game. It's ridiculous and I will not budge on that opinion.
---
&gt;maybe you should grammar better
---
You have gotta be kidding me...
---
&gt;Besides the point though I am objectively right though when I say they're making it easy for survivors because that's what they're clearly doing .
---
It is called balance. Plenty of patches have adjusted either side. This whole idea of the game being made easier for one side from a general standpoint is simply incorrect.
---
&gt;And again it still makes no sense to use the back in the day argument. Sighs that's like saying man remember when they used to put slightly more poison I my drink? Damn I remember those days sucked. Atleast they're putting 5% less poison dude. High fives
---
No, your use of "back in the day" doesn't make any sense. In fact, it is the most inane comparison I have ever heard. My example made sense because of this game's track record as a whole.
---
&gt;Otr I have been playing since DbD came out. I don't know what DbD you played but idk I don't even care because I'm not going to change your mind.
---
Cool, then you should know that this game is currently at its best point for killer in years.
---
Let them complain about something that's apart of the game, play however you want dude.
---
My point was about how his effective strategy doesn't require much good execution. Place a snare at a pallet, place another snare on the long end of the loop, hold W. If they drop pallet you can choose to bloodlust or kick it if it's too safe.
---
He's about as interactive as a Spirit. Nothing you can do if he chooses to spam snares and turn 90% of pallets in the game into a bloodlust center. And it doesn't take any skill on his end either.
---
Whereas with Oni, barring survivors just position themselves badly, there's a little more to it than holding W
---
LITHE + DANCE WITH ME GANG WE OUT HERE
---
Whoops replied to my own post my bad anywho
---
Yeah I don't play anymore cos college, this place never disappoints when it comes to making me laugh, so many amazing people.
---
Yeah I play both sides (rank 3 survivor, rank 5 killer) so I know the survivors have lost as soon as there is a DC
---
Cute :)
---
Offerings to *reduce* the chances of being sent to certain realms, and instantly give all Killers 999 Coldwind ones.
---
and force people to play games they don't want to be in yaye and dont give me "if u pressed ready u chose to play" if my team is dead before a single gen is done and they still try fighting it I would much fucking rather give up on hook and find a new game
---
Oh yeah thats good too.
---
I think its a matter if just settling for it when you can't get spine chill. I mean, you can run something better, of course, but knowing where the killer is can save your ass.
---
Because Legion needed more counterplay to their power amirite 🤔
---
ThRoW AnOtHeR RoCk
---
I ship WraithxTrapper, the OTP 😤😤
---
I am *bleed*
---
Oh she deserved that hook so bad. Asshole move right there. This is satisfying.
---
— A survivor main
---
Play ghost face or the hillbilly
---
Dumb bitch
---
Literally everything you're saying in this thread just tells us you're a shit survivor who can't loop.
---
That's when you press R and down one or two more.
---
this is dumb bc as every time I see this I go 1. some games that have been lost survivors still fight and u have to wait even longer for it to end meaning I will kill myself on hook find a new game and accept defeat 2. if I can't struggle and I want out and I can't DC well then I will just go AFK being more shit as a teammate.
---
u can't stop ppl from DCing or just wanting to leave games especially when DBD is as unbalanced as it is I think if DBD just continues to fix problems make changes then ppl will enjoy games more and see less DCs and for the community to learn what to expect.
---
If they have been decent players and respectful I usually give hatch if they don't wiggle. If they wiggle I will hit a rock or a solid object and shake my head, and if they continue it's to a hook you go.

Clown has shitty gen pressure while not being as good in chase as other chase focused killer he need some buff
---
this makes no sense in the context of Legion or Oni bc neither of them are stupid strong yet they get the shaft
---
totally
---
Noed is a clutch perk when you’ve already lost, it’s not a bad perk but it’s better to have a perk that doesn’t rely on you almost losing
---
exactly. im sorry but if im not having fun in a game im not playing it. ill just go afk and make food lol
---
Can you imagine how dope this would be? Not sure if they could ever get the rights though
---
Indeed, easily one of my most satisfying kills!
---
Newb question, but is there an up to date list which has tier lists for characters?
---
I have no clue who is worth playing any more after they keep neutering the killers
---
Like there is a difference from not having fun and just being outplayed but removing the option to admit defeat by losing is just stupid I am losing eventually why do I have to wait not like it is gonna change how I am playing "oh what is that u unhooked me and I cant kill myself hey killer come here"
---
and why do i usually dc? because of either a select few maps that are broken as fuck and not fun or a select few killers that are broken as fuck and not fun. fix the damn game and people will actually want to play instead of forcing people to play some bullshit broken match
---
It the other way around for me
---
Can’t blame her there! That’s going to be a fun game to play.
---
Every. Fucking. Time. 
---
Excellent post, thanks friend.
---
Mate they are referring to insta-down hatchets, the ultra rare add on. Not the wind up speed
---
Same here. Last challenge left, tried hard to get this done with basement Trapper, but it wouldn't budge. Said fuck it, queued up with Pig just to have some fun with my regular build and got Badham with the basement inside the school and the survs getting 3-genned near it, so i got it done even without Agitation or Iron Grasp.
---
no u wanna know a useless perk? This Is Not Happening only use is to do the challenges
---
new legion buff: if you injure survivors that are already injured without putting them into the dying state 30 times, you can escape and the last survivors out, gets sacrificed
---
bruh i was scaredd lmao t walls are garbage
---
And then you and Myers bust into a groovy jig
---
They have too many pallets that can't be won for killers. There should not be any 100% safe pallets but there should be more so there's constantly an actual interaction between killer and survivor.
---
it would be rly nice to get more map reworks like especially haddonfield imo I hate it as a survivor ever
---
Chase was non-existent, but avoiding the chase was/is pretty easy.  You can see the red glowing ball of fury on the other side of the map.  It's pretty easy to play hide-and-seek against a giant firefly.
---
i DO think they should rework some maps like that. like for example underground complex is so garbage. id rather there be like 8 pallets if they were actually safe than 30 unsafe ones
---
As a survivor it’s so fucking annoying to have no chance of escape just sitting on a hoop spamming keys(or buttons) just to not be rescued and waste their fucking time
---
Yeah, wtf are they doing over there? I always use Kindred so I know **they** know what's going on and that the killer isn't facecamping
---
I think Adept should trigger on Ruthless instead of only at Merciless. There's no way, unless you get the dumbest sack of potatoes in DbD history, you can get Adept after a certain point. If there's any excuse for purposely going for de-pips, it's to get Adept killer achievements easier. 
---
Shit, I got Adept Laurie by doing literally nothing. We were on Badham, and one person went down in shack. The other two tried rescuing and they all died in the basement. I was watching from upstairs in a house as I worked on a generator despite Ruin being up. Since the first guy went down in under 60 seconds, I had already decided not to rescue them. Once the last guy died, I popped out the window and found the hatch. Easiest Adept survivor trophy I've gotten.
---
I would prefer him to have some sort of trap boxes which take health state from people passing by. He's a clown after all, but sadly he doesn't have enough funny surprises
---
your laugh is so contagious
---
Lmao no cap, I'm using TINH tight now on my claudette...I heal myself 99% and just do Gens so I always hit great checks....8/10 matches have a Ruin in it so TINH really helps me out. Of course you gotta be injured so I go find the killer so he hits me then I lose em and go on about doing my Objectives. Maybe u should try that
---
I haven’t bought the DLC and was actually wondering what people thought of it, time well spent!
---
It should work for hatchets, and hatchets should be Salvageable from the ground and walls from being thrown.
---
Just yesterday I found a Yui working on a gen, stalked up to tier 2, then still got the gen grab as she freaked the fuck out and blew up the gen.
---
I agree people shouldn’t act childish or be assholes online but on the same note be an adult and just ignore these people considering they can’t harm you. If you have trouble ignoring messages then change your settings to ignore non-friends. Have fun bud.
---
as a killer main, my advice is to play 100% for fun. focus on winning too much and you'll go crazy and ignore the survivors they'll bitch and moan even if you follow their rules on how you should play. as long as you're not face camping every hook, you're not being toxic no matter how they might feel
---
haddonfield sucks for both killer and survivor but id take it over underground complex or yamoaka any day. none of the 30+ pallets in underground are safe and yamoaka is basically just bamboo the whole map. id rather there be like 10 or under pallets on underground if they were actually safe and some window loops would be nice. haddonfield has none of the t wall or jungle gyms either which sucks. basically if you dont get autohaven the games not balanced at all
---
ain’t it a blink tho, not a teleport
---
Uff
---
We're just hopin the game lives up to the first, also sad there's no multiplayer in the 2nd cause I enjoyed board slapping people.
---
and they want to rework perks like balanced for haddonfield instead of reworking the map ehich u can still abuse without balanced
---
Well, Payday (and surely other games)  did it, so its not something new , and maybe he could come with some of the Crypt TV characters as a killer? The Look-see maybe?( after all he was a character on that series)
---
Yeah but normally if you played things right you're still gonna rank up from the rest of the game, if it's not the case maybe you guys did generators too quickly and really didn't care about the killer's experience or yours for that matter, enough for both parties to get enough points to rank up.
---
I mean.. I guess? You're assuming these and un-mindgameable loops I assume? If they can be mindgamed a good freddy (or any killer for that matter) should make things a bit more interesting. And I mean, aren't you just describing over half the cast when you talk about a killer being forced to just run around a loop and m1 you? 
---
In addition if does what you describe (bloodlusting eveyone down) he will completely lose the match against even semi-good survivors. So I'm still not sure I understand the complaint? You hate killers who can do nothing but run you around a loop and bloodlust/force the pallet, but you hate nurse and spirit cuz they're too strong and theres no counterplay..... so you hate every killer?
---
Well you are right. But we can say she is "alive" as a spirit. Fucking dead bodies is other rhing
---
i got like 3 yesterday
---
DAMN you got me good. you wrote this out really well i actually believed you
---
It's like I always say. Baby Dweet gets the yeet (down hatch that is)
---
I’m gonna start this by saying I tried a few games with territorial 100% for memes, first one was with billy and within a minute someone went down there and I got em, worked a couple more times too and then I was like holy shit this would work with leatherface so I threw it on and went into a game. Waited just out of range for the first person to go down as soon as the notification went off I went down and got him, then the same again for the second going for the unhook, and the third.... and fourth I ended up having 2-3 games out of 10 having all of them hooked in the basement. I think because I wasn’t insidious camping they weren’t as worried to go down and this is also how I got the basement hook challenge done.
---
one of the bonuses of playing nice most of the time is that you don’t have to feel bad when you bring iridescent head and a mori whenever you see 4 toolboxes
---
I think the boyfriends note gives extra lunge in t1
---
They also said it was intended...so we don't fuckin know.
---
Right, I get that being facecamped is just a frustrating experience. I guess my whole point is that it's kind of a double standard that it's look down on to give survivors a frustrating experience as a killer, when giving the killer a frustrating experience as a survivor is actually encouraged.
---
I see where you're coming from with the killer being the power role, but I don't think that makes them morally responsible for the other side's experience. It's not a game like D&amp;D where you're the dungeon master and you have to avoid fully stomping the characters.
---
Sorry baby, if it glows it goes
---
Since the power control, he is meh.
---
right now he's midtier
---
as soon as they readjust his flick to 90° he'll hopefully go back to top tier but we'll have to wait and see how they actually go about doing that
---
Whoops... then yeah, I agree. I'm too used to when people called wind-up addons + old tinkerer 3 "insta-hatchets"
---
4/5 games I spawn in and go straight into a gen. Within 10 seconds spine chill lights up and I'm into a chase. Its like the killer has a tracker planted on me or some shit. And if I'm first hook best believe I'm getting tunneled. That's why I've started running ds. It has also made me aware of the fact that deliverance would be useless to me. I'm not even that good at survivor. Maybe it's because I run a Nea rocking the bright blue and pink top with the Grey sweats.
---
Lol same! There are a lot of ppl who have high expectations for the game so they better not screw it up :l
---
Ps4 or PC, because I play huntress on ps4, and the controls aren't that bad.
---
Yea shes just instanty moving from point A to point B. Thats teleportation my guy.
---
it’s a shame that now as survivor literally all you have to do is turn around at the last second
---
IT tAkeS hEr aCtUAl tImE
---
Pedantic as fuck
---
You wanted that item huh 😂😂💀
---
The devs have said they will change it in the future like they did with Prayer Beads. Its just too over powered to have a power which instantly downs survivors from any range
---
The Plague's leg would fell of if she tried to break the pallet, she is skinny and her body and if im not mistaken her disease had gangrene-type sympthoms, so a bit of force and goodbye leg and pallet, and also just kicking it would'nt fit her classy and educated personality,  Huntress is more Savage (and russian)
---
Id say this applies to life in general
---
I was lucky and somehow got it against a Billy. Two of them I even interrupted his chainsaw sprint.
---
Fuck that. Lithe is awesome. Especially combined with Dance With Me.
---
Mate I will let you dangle for an another bong hit, but I'll use BT and make sure the killer is on me.
---
Yea ik it is dumb
---
STAB STAB STAB STAB STAB STAB STAB STAB STAB
---
it becomes bad when u can learn when to always hit greats tho
---
The first game did everything on point making a simple generic event into a beautiful tight story, just a bump on the story could make it slightly worse than the first way to easily, so who knows if it will be worth the years of waiting.
---
right now bottom mid tier just bc his power got slapped with BHVR no logic nerf tool
---
&gt; "If you want to know the answer, give me your money or sub to me."
---
I would have donated the minimum possible unit of money I could just to spite him.
---
this. As a survivor main (I'm trying killer from time to time, and my experience is : gameplay is fun, survivors are not \^\^), I'm always on the lookout to see if I can help a friend come to the gates. I got killed lot of times for trying to help. 
---
AND I REGRET NOTHING
---
But it ain't that much fun if he founds you you're dead no matter what you do. Especially with BBQ
---
Yea well that's not me right now even tho I'm Rank 3. I hit plenty of great skill checks but sometimes they get away from me causing me to expose myself or get frustrated with ruin penalties that I just leave gen to find ruin.
---
Please tell me this is not a thing
---
Kek
---
Wraith: *BINGBONG*
---
I always find ruin makes me hit more greats and I love it when killers bring unnerving presence.
---
Some people see a killer hovering around a hook and think "megacamper!", when in reality they might have seen a survivor or something.
---
The reeaal campers, the ones who stand 1CM from the hook as Bubba, reving the saw, they can eat my ass.
---
Did you play against one? There were two streamers doing it on PC it was really funny
---
legion was never strong but extremely boring to play against.
---
What about pig?
---
I don't see a lot of toxic post game chats as a survivor after the game (green - purple), but as a noob killer (less than 10 games), half of my games I have at least one person making fun of my skills or teabagging me
---
At least I'm not the arguably worst killer in a dark entity's realm
---
I really don't miss playing on ps4 at all. On PC if you don't want to get harassed you just leave.
---
Don't go straight for a gen when the game starts and you won't be first hook, thus you will get tunneled less.
---
People need to stop telling other people what perks and add ons they can and can’t use.
---
Who are you then?
---
I am talking about the current legion not the reworked legion
---
Demogorgon: Look at me, I'm a tulip! *emerges from the soil*
---
So the conclusion I'm drawing from this is that bad survivors are toxic.
---
Unfortunately, this is the internet.
---
Why i dont fuck around at the exit gates, tbagging has no positive value.
---
This ^ Just a matter of gitting gud if you can’t deal with the loops. The game is more than just chasing a survivor around strong loops, people can’t seem to realise that and just whine if they get outplayed for bad decision making
---
I'm fast as fuck boi
---
Trapper on Hawkins is stronger then u think 1 trap covers 1 doorway and almost an entier hallway sure they are very open but not hard to manage since the bottom lvl is meh small kinda it works okay for me
---
but yes welcome to matchmaking
---
Glass bead map add on, I believe it’s yellow. Press the secondary action button when using a map to put a beam of light on the map that other survivors can see
---
ty, Ghostface can be fun if you try and use his ability strategically, try patrolling the outside of generators to get free grabs, people usually don't expect much
---
Yeah I keep doing it this way then having someone give up/not get rescued on their first or second hook. Like im off chasing other players and hooking the dudes on death hook in the basement but no one is gonna go across the map to get feng? SMH
---
It already is pretty easy, except playing against SWF. You should win 95% of matches against solo queuers
---
Typical
---
No one knows until the shrine refreshes.
---
Hang in there, my good buddy. I've had my fair share of tortures for playing a lot of killer games myself and I definitely know how it feels. Hell, I learned how to become desensitized to every single insult thrown at me by just having a lot of hours on this game, really. There will always an another game that you'll win, like I always say to myself.
---
Yes Freddy’s back 😎
---
Yeah I've tried at least 30 times, 4-6 were pretty close or in the bag except for:
---
1: Someone gives up on first hook outside of basement
---
2: DC out of spite
---
3: DC out of spite
---
4: Mis-counted my hooks, or they let nea get to phase 2 on the first hook and I didnt notice
---
5:  No one rescued Feng and she died on the first hook
---
6: Spite DC
---
Freddy enables it far more easily and his add-ons/ perk builds afford him that opportunity to waste time by slowing the game to a crawl
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eeiz56/information_regarding_matchmaking_dev_stream_1218/
---
That challenge sounds horrific. And I thought Sekiro was hard
---
Killer sided at the potato ranks, gets more Survivor sided as you go up in skill level. Around purple ranks and up its Survivor sided.
---
I remember when the ranking was more fucked up than ever and every match pitted a Yellow rank killer against purple to red rank survivors, horrible times
---
Huntress: Catch!
---
Ace with pink pants
---
Some survivors dont even know what tunneling means. I was called a tunneler for using legions ability a lot in a match lol
---
Not only he is not really strong , he also feels very bad to play. The only time you have fun is when you hit someone with demon dash but since the nerf it only happens if they run in a straight line, a simple tree or small rock can completely negate your power. Weaker killers like trapper and doc at least have their own gameplay and fun factor, with oni you are m1 killer 60% of the time, Billy 39% of the time, and there is that 1% of the time where you feel like Oni
---
Great point, what are the equivalent rules for survivors? Better yet, what are the equivalent rules for SWF players who are on comms? They are none and that's why so many new killers are annoyed and stop playing killer.
---
Ah the classic "forever freddy op" even after literally all his slowdown addons were nerfed. If he uses both his best slowdown addons, and everyone is asleep, it slows the game down less than any slowdown perk in the game does by itself. His "best" addons are worse than most killers
---
I have no idea how would it work but i want it

The only thing that prevents Clown from being at least decent is the slowdown he gets before after throwing a bottle
---
Yeah this is one of my favourite uses of the perk. Unsafe pallets aren't a death sentence if you don't get the stun when you have Lithe.
---
I've always thought Clown's bottles have potential (based on the lore) to be much more interesting and effective. Why not add small repair/healing penalty after being hit by a bottle? The Afterpiece Tonic is supposed to be an anethestic gas, but survivors can literally stand in the gas and do generators just fine. Shouldn't inhaling anesthetic gas also make you sloppy? Maybe some weird skill checks? I know what I'm describing goes more or less into Doctor territory, but the point still stands. I think if they could find a middle ground where the bottles were still effective looping tools, but also had other effects that gave some penalties and restrictions to survivors.
---
I was thinking about this the other way.  
---
Spirit; Can phase between dimensions.
---
Leatherface; Fuck it i'll use a chainsaw.
---
I also find docs perks to fit demogorgon more,
---
Overwhelming presence cuz in the show flashlights always flicker and sometimes completely run out of battery, overcharge cuz he can interfere with technology and monitor and abuse cuz he a sneaky boi
---
I've played quite a few games where I hear crows so I know there is a camping ass survivor somewhere.  I'm deaf in my right ear so it's hard to pinpoint that sound. She did all the gens herself damnnear while I was looking for her teammates. Let her go since she was the only one that played, and she let me get a hair away from tier 3 Myers and I grabbed one out if a locker, insta downed the other, and hit the third before they could get out.  I searched until the egc was almost over for the last one down in the bushes. Fuckers.
---
Thanks for the strat!
---
Nobody likes a show off
---
Pretty much, yeah. Cumulative effects over time for repeated exposure makes a lot of sense, even if it gets kinda close to Doctor.
---
Righteo!
---
not all bad survivors (weren't we all bad at one point ? ^^), but yeah. 
---
That's also where you can encounter "smurfs" (don't know if the term is used in dbd, but rank 19-20 with all good perks maxed out and who are kinda good at the game), or red-ranks in a SWF of 3-4 with ranks 19-20. So perhaps this is where they all go to be assholes ^^
---
It looks like no one answered your other question yet. Yes, tombstone is an addon of the rarest type (pink), so you don't get them very often in your bloodweb. In terms of casual play, yes, I would only use pink addons rarely, for times when you want to stomp on survivors or make a video like this one. Survivor pink items/addons aren't nearly as powerful as tombstone, but some are good. The more time you put into the game, the less you will care about saving rare addons and will just like to use them for fun. 
---
Also just want to mirror what the other guys said, good survivors push through ruin. AKA, just try to go for the great skill checks, eventually you will get better and it won't be too much of an issue. At high ranks the killers have to use ruin because all the survivors don't miss good skill checks and most can still hit great skill checks consistently. For them its the only way to slow down the game.
---
In my experience the SWF groups and people who bring items love to write "report him for camping and tunneling and slugging!" even when its not a 4k and not even primitive camping or tunneling or slugging, but a tight match.
---
Ok this is funny
---
He didn't.  He said the extra pallet throwdown was for MISSING the insta hatchet.  When you're that  close to someone and you miss, it's almost brain shattering
---
Yeah, well, repairing 3 generators with Dark Sense has not been fun.
---
Imagine utilize self care in 2019
---
No, I meant in general. Not in this specific context. It’s all over this sub.
---
He's not OP but most people I go against choose to play him boring. Ruin + Pop + Swing chains, throw on discordance or sloppy for good measure, bust gens. And when it's time to down someone just spam snares and hope they run out of a lifeline, or you force the down with bloodlust.
---
It's not particularly unique. Not particularly strong against a good set of survivors. But in solo queue I just want to suicide on hook when in the first 5 minutes 0% progress has been made on all gens.
---
Yeah it's rough. I admit like half of those failures are my fault, but then when I don't try the first two hooks outside the basement everyone's on to me and runs to the far corners of the map! It's the last one I have left just like the OP so I won't feel too too bad if I can't get it done.
---
One, two, freddys coming for you!
---
COMMIT
---
You love it, you slut!
---
Not gonna lie but as a bingbongboi player (like, only killer I'll play atm) I get hella toxic to flashlight tbagging survs. I will invis patrol your hook and make fucking sure you get sacrificed. Typically ends up in a slaughterfest as well cause aultrism kills, and people get cocky cause it's just an M1 killer.
---
Also, I run NOED simply because I AM a m1 killer. Why shouldn't I lol
---
He accused a huntress that she was stream sniping cuz she always knew where he was but she was just running bbq&amp;chilli
---
He’s still strong but requires more practice I do just fine in red ranks with him without ruin.
---
Doing this challenge shocked me into how many killers *still* insist on respecting pallets. And how out of their way they go to prevent a stun.
---
Leatherface AKA "The Cannibal" is highly recommended for new players, he's simple to play, and has great teachable perks, especially BBQ &amp; Chilli as others have said.
---
Just like the movies
---
BHVR usually tweets out the perks a little while before they refresh
---
Idk, my personal quantifier is "have you been an asshole/useless to your fellow survivors this game?" if yes, no hatch for you boyo. Otherwise, I'll give it if I pass it on the way to a hook, or go looking if they don't wiggle.
---
Try again. That really doesn't happen all that often in my experience.
---
u just described the game. imagine if the game was that easy then this game will be already forgotten in our steam library.
---
I’m sorry, what exactly are you getting at here?
---
Look at the shit people post on this sub and you want to act like it isn't already a bunch of 12 year olds with 4 year old mentalities
---
Freddy is the best. Period. End of discussion.
---
Nothing really. Clown is the worst killer.
---
The mindgames! 😎Well played!
---
The killer is finish  nyyppä is a way to say noob in finish
---
My guy...stop it. The game is getting more and more balanced forcing survivors to learn to play better thus making them better at the game. It has nothing to do with making it easier for survivors. IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE EASIER FOR SURVIVORS BECAUSE GUESS WHAT 1v4. 
---
But if you want to see why it was much worse... here take a look

I've been playing since September 2017 and while I didn't experience the horror of no ruin, vaccum vaults and sabo meta I did however experience vaccum pallets, slow hook/generator kicking/pick up animations, old brutal palleta kicking speed for a bit and quite a lot of delicious double pallets and so forth. IT WAS NOT FUN
---
Ah I guess I understand. Freddy and wreck uncoordinated teams. But you have to realize you are complaining about a freddy build that is not even his strongest. Pop is a must on freddy, and unfortunately most killers run ruin (I main freddy with no ruin) but forever freddy is not his best build.
---
You are better off trying to keep people asleep and/or injured and having good rotation utilizing his high mobility. His best addons, besides the pill bottle and his pinks, would be the drawings that increase his power recover speed. Thus increasing his mobility. Or possibly dream snares with a certain build that focuses on getting some strong pallet down and then replacing it and rotating.
---
Ahh, I see.
---
Oh yeah, that shit needs to go.
---
I appreciate what you're saying and I have messages blocked most of the time. It's a shame though, because what if someone wants to say thank you? What if I could make a friend during a match, but because I have to block messages to avoid the toxic people, I miss the opportunity to make a friend? Granted, online gaming friends can't compete with real life friends, but on a similar vain, most of my friends in the real world aren't gamers and most of the ones that are gamers don't play DBD. It's a classic catch 20-2. Sad state of humanity I guess.
---
It's definetly not the best perk but I really grew to love it. Balanced is too situational imo. Need to get to a high spot first which sucks imo. Dead hard is bugged half the time and also requires you to be hit already. Sprint burst I just my dislike for the 99% strategy.
---
So theres only one perk left. Lithe. Getting to a window is easy. Gets you out of shitty looping spots like t-l-walls. Also good with dance with me or quick and quiet. No one expects you to have it since not many people use it.
---
But I think the exhaustion perks are all on the same level. And most people stick with the one they played first which was lithe for me.
---
That killer on my last post was a tunnler so i bullied him,  Killers literally complain about everything if they dont get a 4k, they want everything nerfed if it helps the survivor,  Reddit is full of killer mainz so I can see why everyone is so mad.
---
"The dumbest sack of potatoes" lololol
---
Y'all gonna fuck or what?
---
Please remember that some of the people you play with are immature kids raging behind a keyboard for the dumbest things.
---
You know how some kids go absolutely nuts if you don’t give them the new phone that they want, and will either throw a hissy fit or attempt to explain why you should give it to them? Yeah.
---
I wouldn’t let it get to you, or bother reasoning with them. The internet brings out the worst in people, especially young children who don’t know any better.
---
Wraith: Can turn invisible
---
Freddy: Can teleport people to an alternate dimension
---
Demogorgon: Able to traverse through portals
---
The Trapper: **traps**
---
As a killer player I agree with everything you said but I do want to add one thing I think a lot of killers will agree on:
---
NOED does take no skill. It carries so many bad killers to hoghers ranks than they should be. There's even more stuff that carries survivors, but when talking from the killer side, its def NOED.
---
Fair point.
---
Ah yes
---
No events to focus on more DLC’s and over priced cosmetics. 
---
Cash cow, a game bye BHVR
---
Yeah it’s a known bug. You can only dc as far as I know
---
It runs like ass and there is no cross progress.
---
Legion: stabby stabby stab stab
---
Yes, there are perks that aren't as easy to identify.  But if you have identified all 4, then you know there's no room for noed.
---
So what perks were you running in those games?
---
Very true just like head on is a nurse counter
---
Dwelfs, no matter how toxic they are I will always spare them
---
Toxic T-Bagging P3 Claudettes, I may be the only killer main that spares these little fucks, cuz i wanna reduce the amount of toxicity by teaching them that there are better ways to play this game than this, instead of nodding your head and smacking them on the hook which will make them know you’re pissed (which is what they want) give ‘em the hatch and just say gg and leave.
---
laurie, cuz I think I’m the only person in this game that Maine Laurie and has her to p3, so I show respect to ppl who play her
---
and finally steve (must be scoops ahoy tho)
---
He’s been playing for at least a week or 2 now and he still doesn’t know what bbq does or what exposed is. I knew this shit day one. Also the fact that he doesn’t play killer at all which means he’s most likely going to become a entitled toxic survivor main.
---
Laughs in Balanced Landing
---
it wasnt a showing off move it was a statement
---
Yeah I was confused too. Insta hatchets refers to both her when wind-up addons with old tinkerer. I guess the newer players just weren’t around for it so they got confused and thought it referred to her insta down addon.
---
Do what you must,for I have already won.
---
Just change your name to "2x pal stuns == kill" or something, i'd help you out ;)
---
I really just need a lobby full of survivors who need various quest, do them all and then hook em all. everybody wins
---
Hag: "I can channel a dark ritual to teleport and make mud copies of myself."
---
Wraith: "I can turn invisible."
---
Oni: "I can access my inner rage to become lethal and fast."
---
Huntress: **"HATCHETS."**
---
Killers
---
- Leatherface: they camp waaaaaaay too frequently.
---
- Nurse: Either its a god Nurse who ends the game in 4 minutes and no one gets to play, or a shit nurse whose so fucking easy its not even fun
---
- Trapper: The trap is always in the one place I didn't check, without fail.
---
Survivors
---
- Claudette: Fucking invisible.
---
- Bill: King of farming their teammates just because they have BT, and end up screwing their allies for it.
---
- Nea: Always great at loops, always runs full metaslave perks and is usually toxic
---
Maps
---
- Mount Ormond: Way too many configurations of this map are impossible for Killer, as too many powerful tiles can end up next to each other.
---
- Haddonfield: The window loops are annoying, the fences are annoying, this map is annoying
---
- Red Forest: Way too big, unless I'm playing a killer or perk setup with some map pressure, I'm basically fucked.
---
Items
---
- Keys: Way too broken with the EGC, can be used to just skip the midgame
---
- Medkits: I have PTSD from old instaheals
---
- Flashlights: Can be countered by good play, but it sucks when you down someone in the open and have to chance the blind.
---
Offerings
---
- Moris: Ebony is busted as fuck, Ivory's not much better
---
- Shit Map Offerings: basically Ormond or Haddonfield offerings, the less I have to play Killer on those maps the better
---
- Rotten Oak, the purple version whose name escapes me: Only seen by aids SWF groups who stack these on a big map to make hooking impossible.
---
r/noisicomments
---
You're forgetting about ds and borrowed time which makes the killers lives miserable
---
I think the community is well aware that balancing a killer, especially Legion, is difficult as all get out. But that does not change that the devs are handling this horribly. 
---
They did the same thing with the Nurse rework. They went against the wishes of the community when we said we didn’t want them touching her base kit, and they still did. And when they got pushback on it, the devs didn’t say anything. In fact it’s been radio silence aside from the same “we want to see where things land” line of BS. 
---
When the devs go against the wishes of the community without giving a good reason, it is to be expected that the community is pissed. The devs don’t listen to us. 
---
We tell them a killer is weak, and they pull the “well the stats show they’re doing fine” and when someone uses the stats to say something like “Nurse was over nerfed bc now she’s statistically similar to Clown who is objectively one of the weakest killers in the game”, they say “THE STATS ARENT EVERYTHING”. 
---
These devs are shady as fuck and they don’t handle these situations well. The only 2 killer balancing situations they didn’t completely bungle was Spirit and Freddy. Spirit was bc she got a touch up (despite statistically not needing it), and Freddys rework was a massive success.
---
It used to have the niche of allowing you to change obsessions throughout the match which opened up unique synergies, but Nemesis now does that but in a much better way that has better synergies with things like Play With Your Food.
---
I really don’t agree. It depends on want Rank it is. I started a new account to play with my family and we get 1-2 randoms. Those randoms Can never do gens. Especially if it’s a Rank 17 with Ruin, BBQ, NOED and Tanac. Ruin should not be allowed until Rank 10. It’s utterly game breaking. These people just cannot handle it. It doesn’t slow the game down. It breaks it. They do nothing. And even if I loop the killer for minutes, because this is Rank 17 they’ll chase you forever, nothing gets done.
---
I’d be ok with Ruin going away and generators taking longer to be done but kicking them only setting them back a tiny amount depending on Rank. 
---
Either way, they really need to tune the numbers based on Rank.
---
She even got a second chance with that flashlight save and everything
---
He's the perfect Dweard cosplayer
---
Invis traps is legendary
---
I give hatch if you played well, whether or not you wiggle. If you were just immersed the whole game and tried to avoid me while taking 0 pressure from your team or if you sandbagged/farmed a teammate, you die, wiggle or not. Fucking hate it when that happens to me as survivor and then I see the dumb fuck get let go by the killer.
---
Dark traps are a no. Those are annoying as fuck to play against. Give him yellow bag as default and make him arm his traps *slightly* faster
---
I'd say very low a tier-high b tier. Was higher before nerf.
---
&gt;  Or escape with like 7,000 points after your team does all the heavy lifting.
---
Just wanna say, 7,000 points doesn't necessarily mean you didn't help. I've done like 3-4 gens by myself before and gotten barely any points cause I wasn't getting chased.
---
None of my Friends even play DBD on Switch so no sfw for me like ever rip. 
---
Good luck on getting good teammates.
---
If you get downed at end game, expect to get camped. Survivors and generators are the killer's only objectives. Once you finish the generators, what's left? 
---
Stop whining.
---
One slight correction. 
---
Mending timer will go down in the TR now. The mechanics are now based on if ur running.
---
Same. Last time I got a toxic killer it was some tunneling but nothing DS can’t fix lol. It’s every killer game I do that survivors spend the whole game being little dicks 😂
---
I'll do the same thing.
---
I sometimes try and mind game really safe pallets, and by the time you realize it is too safe to mind game I already have bloodlust and get really curios. 
---
Once I tried to bloodlust the cow tree pallet just to see if it was possible. I think it is because I got slightly closer each time, but I won’t know for sure because a Dwight came and sat to lengthen the wall with the pallet to add 0.5 seconds to each lap. Still mad about that, there was at least 2 gens yet and it was her first hook why do you have to take a hit.
---
i played a match as killer the other night.   this one dude kept clicking his flashlight to get me to chase him.  
---
i ended up hooking him 3 times, 3rd being after the EGC started and i killed another guy.  2 escaped.   
---
he felt it was necessary to message me something about being garbage.  so i just responded and said gg.  he decided to keep going about how it took me so long to get him.  i just said gg again.
---
Black Christmas jeff for life. Mix of metal and xmas
---
I body block for killers on t-baggers. "Oh you tbagged? Well you're stuck between me and the killer in the corridor now bitch." They get so pissed.
---
My first killer match ever on ps4 I got told u is a major dick rider after I got a few messages every game I just set it so I only get messages from people on my friends list, and it’s so much more peaceful
---
ok.
---
Yeah until they start giving us viable killers I’m done playing killer. 
---
Strictly survivor for me. Even soloq is less stressful than killer
---
&gt;  is basically a second chance
---
Shall we list all of the "second chance" perks that survivors have?  How dare the killer have one as well.
---
Lol I used to use black Christmas Jeff but now I use motorcycle metal Jeff
---
Lol.  I'm guessing they get 10 million false reports a day from immature salty players.
---
Yeah if the killer is staying in the area because a team mate has been obvious, you’ve gotta blame the team mate and not the killer. Yeah proper face campers can go stub their toe.
---
I was one of them :D it went from a 2 stack to a full swf team :D. It's loads of fun!
---
This game has so many second chances for survivors that its gotten ridiculous. Sometimes you need to accept that you're getting sacrificed. Especially at the end game. Deal with it and move on.
---
I used to be staunchly against camping but after hooking every survivor twice and letting them save each other and tea bag in front of me and act all cocky when they escape I’ve decided at times camping is a necessary evil. I never do it the whole time nor do I do it in every match only when the crew are jerks. I’m not gonna have a flashlight shined in my eyes and watch you all praise the entity at the exit gate, then get a hundred messages saying get rekt noob, because I feel guilty about camping the biggest asshole of the group.
---
[You're a good man. Thank you](https://youtu.be/NIUlGYSYc_Q)
---
Yeah I really love my purple-green clearly two separate SWF groups. Those games do tend to be pretty fun as killer.
---
Might be the chest searching challenge, when I did it I used plunderer's and ace in the hole and got keys every match
---
Run NOED on whoever you want. They don’t make the rules
---
Once faced w doctor on the game. Without knowing who the killer is the first terror radius scream scared tf out of me. Never again
---
Tehnically correct - the best kind of correct.
---
This is not right. I am disturbed and feel Bubba's pain. #KILLERLIVESMATTER
---
I played against a billy the other day that was using haunted grounds, devour hope and NOED. It doesn’t matter m8, just use what you want lol.
---
Leatherface: I am hungry
---
How is it sad? God this community complains about how long it takes to grind one second, and how easy the next.
---
That’s a really interesting and lovely way of dealing with toxic survivors actually, if you don’t show them you’re angry they’ll get bored of it! That’s brilliant, good on you! Yeeesss scoops Steve has my heart ❤️
---
It's Locker Time!
---
Slaughtered by Sunrise
---
Murdered by Morning
---
What demo skin is that?!
---
This is completely understandable. I feel the same actually. Especially when they message you afterwards teasing or taunting you. It’s not really fun :( its exactly why I main survivor. I’ve just found survivor to be more my playing style and I’m more comfortable there.
---
Played a game where a guy kept cleansing and then Immediately unhooking infected survivors. My gf and I just couldn’t believe it and then started taking bets on how many times he would do it. Three. Three times. Then a DC.
---
You can see her flying from A to B, so it's not "instantly" and not "teleporting". You don't say that planes teleport from A to B even tho they travel fast and go through space.
---
And the way things work right now, yes you'll get camped one game but pipping or double pipping is simple as survivor, you'll get the rank back while someone else gets tunneled and camped in your other games.
---
Lol, I've done this too. They usually get stuck between me and the columns.
---
I also think he really needs to have a little more starting amount of gas. Recharging in the middle of a chase  means loosing a lot of distance, and 4 bottles are really like nothing against a good survivor. It's just not worth the value you get out of bottles compared say to Huntress who has 5 hatchets. I think 5-6 bottles by default would be much better so you don't have to take additional bottles addons if you have to have a fun game.
---
Prestiged demo ;)
---
Jesus fuck
---
I hope so also.  The dev's never said anything about it?  Is everyone in the dark?
---
You’re making up strawmen and arguing against points I don’t even make.  
---
Also, “you’re a killer main so your opinion is invalid” is getting old and such a ridiculous counterpoint. You can be a killer main and still objectively talk about aspects of the game that are (un)fair. Your posts and comments have shown me that you’re not open to discussion and you just want to shove your opinion down everyone’s throat.  
---
Everyone who has a different view than you gets instantly shut down with nonarguments like: you’re bad, you’re a killer main bla bla bla bla and so on.
---
As my second main, Clown taught me alot about positioning and chasing survivors. I'd say I can average 3K on him now. You just can't make many mistakes with him.
---
I'd say these perks on their own are not slowing down too much but the complete combination just sucks... which was the joke
---
I try to do it between pallets or doorways but if i see it i gotta take the opportunity. I understand being cocky but youre just being a cunt at this point and the only way they stop is if bad shit happens to them
---
It’s a double entandre ( I think)
---
That is a porn star . They are implying she is wanting a person to spread open her vagina and put a penis inside it. 
---
There is a double meaning that they want the person to spread the ague disease.
---
I was playing back when you couldn't even regress gens. So fuck you for giving me PTSD about tbst. If they change gen regression based on rank I feel like that would be bullshit. It wouldn't be fair to the killers and would be yet another survivor second chance. They cannot tune the game times based on ranks. No other game fucking does that. Why? Because it messes with the skills you're supposed to gain as you get better at the game. That is adaptive difficulty which should ONLY be a thing in single player games. 
---
Oh you get random's that never do gens? Poor you. I play solo survivor and suffered my way to the red ranks so I could get better teammates. I still sometimes get shitty kids who won't do gens. That's part of the game. If you want perfect teammates, then either bring three friends or shut the fuck up.
---
When you prestige the skin gets white?
---
At the cow loop you can't really mingame, you just gotta push the survivor on the worst side for them (where they get the slow vault) and maybe hide your light
---
This was beautiful 😂
---
Is that sarcasm or actual fact? (Seriously I’m not sure)
---
Same, wtf??
---
These Claudettes... never learn, do they?
---
No, prestige makes him bloody. So blood is constantly dripping from his hands. It looks rly cool
---
that was pretty funny but you cant talk about her having a very toxic addon, if you have a very toxic perk. 
---
I can already see this getting downvoted
---
the real struggle here was: if she wasn’t fucking up her tbagging u wouldnt have had ur 1k :)
---
When I play killer and I see this happen, I usually let that survivor live and kill the rest of them for being morons. I main survivor and know exactly how this feels.
---
Nurse: Constantly in pain while using her ability. 
---
Clown: Constantly laughing and having a great time.
---
I once saw someone running premonition AND spine chill 🤧
---
You have way too much emotion in this game and obviously don’t care about it being balanced unless it favors you. Makes sense. Once you turn 25, which you clearly haven’t yet, the prefrontal cortex will start operating and you’ll look back on this time of your life and think “holy fuck I was insane.” 
---
Good luck.
---
Sometimes it works like a charm.
---
Worst case scenario if you randomly aim it somewhere as sole Survivor when hatch is open. &gt;!And you regret seeing Killer going to that direction you threw.!&lt;
---
Getting bullied for 3 gens and still managing a 4K felt great can’t lie
---
This with the glasses and cap.
---
Gay police in the hood.
---
I literally just got out of a game with one. Red ranks too.
---
I like Meg, sprint burst is really helpful and adrenaline is cool
---
It would be cool if clown had an intoxication meter similar to doc or plauge with different penalties being applied depending on how intoxicated you are. They would obviously have to balance this with a way for survivors to lower their intoxication level however
---
Report and move on. Also if you are on steam, blocking them is great...cuz next time even if they change their names, you know who they are.
---
Tunnel the shit out of toxic ones. 
---
That said, I never do toxic after chat. Just GG and move on. If I lose, I need to get better. Played huntress after a long time (I'm prestaging nurse to p3...needed BP) and my aim was so bad..one of the survivor said I needed to learn to aim. I simply said what do you think I'm doing? And he goes touche and we left at that.
---
Every game is a practice. Sure killer at high rank isn't exactly fun some of the times, but then is solo q survivor is just as bad. Just embrace and move on.
---
...except for bad matchmaking. Stomping baby killers and saying ggez is just toxic af
---
It's my thing ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I see so many survivors fuck up at endgame despite having an easy time early and mid game. It happens quite often that they get too alturistic and the killer ends up with a 3k or 4k
---
and color blind settings
---
Maybe, yeah. I was thinking n intoxication meter should just be the duration, not strength, to keep it somewhat different from doc or plague.
---
Decisive Strike and Adrenaline are SUBOPTIMAL??
---
You should be a fucking comedian.

FACT. Don't listen to people who will say otherwise. They'll say that just because he's a colossal pain in the ass and they're salty they can't survive lol.
---
Can you elaborate on that? I'm not sure I understand what you mean
---
Man people must be really salty to downvote this.
---
No, but it comes highly recommended.
---
Mainly Killers have shown success without it at the top of the ranks, but it is still one of the best Killer perks in the game, and Killers who lack mobility and map pressure heavily appreciate it to help them on bigger maps that they might struggle to control.
---
He has more mobility as he can control his charge and sprint with WASD keys.
---
Although my biggest concern about him that he can easily get his power back if Survivors don't heal at all. This even applies to No Mither. You leave Blood Orbs everywhere if you make a stop. Even if it's a short interaction like a totem or chest.
---
Not sure if this is an exploit or not, but 17 killer vs 3 rank 16’s and a rank 3. They also had full builds and add ons. Wtf
---
I do the same. Just keep hitting them with GG. That pisses them more than if you would react on their level
---
If they do that then I'm sure multiple Huntress mains will just stop playing. I swear these devs are the main reason this game is losing players.
---
What? You egg.
---
[He stabs him]
---
Is this another nerf to Legion?
---
Nah man.  They don't deserve that.  That's rough.
---
Also clown: LEMME SUCK YO ~~TOES~~FINGERS
---
 "Shoot this thing on my back!"
---
Just wait until after they move it up. Can literally throw a hatchet right after they do that. They still can't move for at least half a second so free hit.
---
Maybe they don't want to give the survivors their archive challenge
---
That doesnt even help really. I get lots of friend requests that I just have to decline because it will turn out to be someone who just really needed to tell me I'm trash
---
Same
---
Really cringey dude yikes
---
That sounds like maybe there were at least 2 SWF present
---
I love seeing survivors get rekt after doing toxic shit like this. Makes my day.
---
Doesn't eacape give you like 5000??
---
So...2000 points before escape does mean you did fuck all tho
---
&gt;Imagine using a cheap POS like Billy
---
Oh, so you’re one of *those* players. lol
---
Ghostface: I can *bend* my legs!
---
Yes it does matter, after all you were talking about your games; therefore it's important to know what perks you used, in order to tell how easy the survivors would have figured it out.
---
Imo, the thing that would help him is survivors having a smaller vision through the gas, this would really help in mindgames, as you could hide your red light. And the bottles as you said, he needs more of them. I would even fight for removal of the speed debuff when reloading.
---
Big brain time
---
Karma is a bitch!
---
Here is an upvote for having me see this
---
Love how the impact effect was right on your face too, gotta love cuntress hitboxes.
---
Oh Oni is still great people are just whiny little bitches. Oni is like Billy level but he's much stronger when he has his power but needs to get it so he's balanced. He's one of the killers that has enough pressure that he can do just fine without ruin. Others are being Billy, Huntress, Nurse, Spirit, Hag, and maybe Pig and Freddy. But no other  character is really worth using.
---
Can already imagine the nerf after one week
---
Should've got it before the pip system. I regret it still.
---
On the other hand, bring Haddonfield offering as ANY survivor and chances are you will get out with your achievement.
---
I think the speed debuff when reloading should stay if base amount of bottles is increased, but maybe buff it a little.
---
+ for a bit worse vision inside of the gas
---
I've got it, the scariest situatuon: Working on the Myers house generator, and Wraith decloaks right behind you, you can't escape that
---
Ok
---
Hmm this was one of the easier ones. You literally just camp a pallet and wait til they swing. You’ll take a hit each time but even if you don’t heal you should get 4 hits to 3 hooks.
---
I also ran object of obsession for this one.
---
People want a second objective, but then get annoyed when a killer gives them that second objective. Sigh.
---
I wouldn't call that abuse. it's just people playing with their friends. this could be abused because if I have an arrow showing me that someone is breathing to my left then it becomes a problem for the survivors. it very well can be abused and it's hard to implement on sound reliant multiplayer games. the point of the stridor perk and many other things would be absolutely useless and everyone would be using this setting regardless of hearing capability.
---
Just revert him to his old turning and it's fine the fact the power is this hard to use is dumb when he is already a worse Billy and Billy power is stupidity easier to use and more powerful
---
I think geisha
---
Pretty certain it’s whatever device you’re on.
---
Imagine all totems being hexes.
---
Bringing Haunted Grounds does wonders.
---
Oke thanks.
---
That’s just too much fun
---
I laughed for too long at this
---
Can’t relate. I only play with strangers
---
Maybe im bad at survivor but why would you vault into the killer?
---
What ? Spine works the same way....you get to see when hes around your area looking and when hes coming to your exact location....Spine stays lit so it's just like Prem only no cool down.
---
Tombstone Myers be like:
---
true but its still funny though XD
---
What did hexy teach him that would be considered “being a cunt”?? I watched a few of the game they played together and he did fine except for the fact that he should use self care
---
if i wanted to control the actions of a fat alcoholic with too many knives, i'd send my uncle memes on facebook
---
Sarcasm? Not judging if it is.
---
So the current issue with Killer Adept achievements is an assortment of things  that have mashed together to form the frustrating mess we have now. 
---
* They've always required a Merciless Victory, unfortunately what that has meant through the years has changed drastically. 
---
* This used to be purely point based. Get 20k Base points in a match and you were golden. Simple and pretty much an Auto-pilot type achievement.
---
* When the Killer cube was introduced, Merciless meant essentially getting a 4k. There was some more nuance to it, but generally if you got a 4k, you'd get your Adept Achievement. Still not horribly difficult but felt fair enough given the Survivor Adept Achievements were laughably easy by comparison.
---
Suddenly we have the Emblem system and this is where the entire thing shits the bed. 
---
The problem BHVR faces is, as I understand it, they can't retroactively change achievements due to restrictions from either Sony or Microsoft. I can't remember which one. But whatever the achievements were when they were implemented, they have to stay that way. So BHVR has its hands tied on this one.
---
The only thing they can tweak is how you get a Merciless Victory. But they can't change what the achievement actually requires. 
---
What's weird to me is, they keep making the Adept achievements for newer killers the same way when it should just be "Sacrifice All 4 Survivors in a Single Trial with 'Killer X' using only their respective perks".  I guess they'd rather have the consistency but man does it suck trying to get when you're not allowed to use other perks to make sure your Gatekeeper emblem doesn't instantly take a nose dive.
---
Mending on the same place you got hit isnt interactive gameplay. Its not fun. Especially since he can do it so much. Doctor's snap out of it atleast got skill checks. RBT needs you to travel across the map. Freddy doesn't force you to wake up but encourages you, and if you do you can't get put to sleep for 30 more seconds. Demo's portal waste a bit of time with skillchecks and the fear of being snuck up on/demo coming out of the portal.
---
Missed opportunity to say “Hatonfield”
---
Vigil actually does something though. Up the Ante is the worst survivor perk, does absolutely nothing but give you a slight boost of the chance to unhook yourself.
---
My only problem with this is that Clown's power needs tuning down just a little bit if you give him new mechanics to help with his glaring weaknesses. Just giving killers extra stuff is basically a HUGE buff, and may need some testing before it would be launched. Good idea though.
---
Listen dude I am new to the game played killer like 5 times and out of these 2 people teabagged me at the gate? What did I do? Laugh about it, because I do have a sense of humor and don't have to take everything personally. I do this stuff as survivor too, because when I feel like it I'll do it it is kinda fun to spam the flashlight imo.
---
 Downvote me all you want
---
Or both!
---
No it's not because Vigil can actually be useful to your team more than one time...Prem is only useful 1 time and it only gives you very little info. Imagine you guys are opening the Gate and you hear the killer coming with No Ed in play...Someone havi g Vigil will help you open the gate faster. Idk how that's useless to you
---
Maybe i'm dumb, but weren't emblems added in 2018? I could have sworn they were already in there when i started playing back when it was a ps+ free game
---
They should give you at least 1 or 2 Rift points IMO.
---
I haven’t played nurse in a while when did she get a distance indicator?
---
I had a Michael on the Cornfield map with the Gen in the barn.. he was stalking me through the boards in the window and i look over to see his red stain and i nearly shat myself. Me and the Ace who was with me bolted as fast as we could and unfortunately no one heard the scream i made
---
For a while I started farming with survivors when one or two people DCed. But ... it kind of pissed me off. Survs then do all gens, all totems, want to pallet stun and flashlight blind me and the game goes on forever. And at the end? As a killer I have maybe 15-20k and survs leave with 25-30k. And I’ve lost twenty minutes of my life just bc I’ve been nice to survs. Fuck that. If two people dc I make sure the other two people die so we all can get into a better match. Obviously, most of the survs get mad at me, but let’s be real, if I would have a terrible game as killer they would let me start farming with them. They would stand in the exit gate t-bagging and flashlight clicking me and telling me that I’m a piece of shit trash killer. So no, I don’t farm when someone DCs.
---
I wouldn’t like that. You could end up with a challenge for someone you don’t like/use and it stops your progress in the tome.
---
As a daily you can re roll it for something different.
---
 oh damn true
---
I only know *of* Dead by Daylight, haven't played and didn't know there was a clown, but seeing this screenshot of him I was surprised he looked all drab and dingy. Presumably he fits the aesthetic better and is harder to track visually but would it be neat to give him the cosmetic ability to switch to a brightly colored smiling laughing clown at will? Obviously no in game effect but imagining running/hiding from that then it gets bright and cheery as it murders seems really in tone with the game.
---
Who knows, just a traveler from /r/all and have always enjoyed the concept of the game.
---
Thats because it's easy for killers take advantage of survivors mistakes. I cant tell you how many times survivors have gotten gens done in 4 minutes and they get really cocky. At that point you just have to down 1 guy. They will all be rushing for the unhook and wont 99% the gates so usually 1 or 2 is forced to escape and the entity takes the others.
---
I’m assuming the Tapp panicked. And as for Claudette, I was in Frenzy and she thought I would vault to her side, so she juked herself XD
---
I enjoy playing Freddy, I love spamming dream snares
---
Why tf did I get so many downvotes? It's good the entity won't steal the perk since I guess you want it? Ffs. Did you figure it out yet?
---
It is 90% survivor propaganda and 10% truth.   They mostly just don't want killers to use one of the only second chance perks they have compared to the multitudes equipped in survivor meta builds used currently.
---
It can cause you to get lax in pressuring gens if that is in your nature.  But at  purple/red, unless you are billy/nurse, you have next to zero gen pressure anyway, and they will pop 2 or 3 before first down most of the time anyway.
---
Reminded me of trapped boxes from Last Year. I have to agree, despite being a clown he doesn't really has surprises. I think that they would be a bit too strong if they outright took a health state out of Survivors (except if they worked like Trapper's Bear Traps, which only really damage Healthy Survivors) maybe they could instead give Survivors a heavy speed debuff along with revealing their Aura for some seconds? But at this point I'd be happy with any buff to the Clown, he suffers so much.
---
Rework to Lerys, that's interesting, I haven't heard about it in the leaks by daylight.
---
Honestly, the demogorgons perks sound more like the Mind Flayer
---
Find a guy called 'Not Otzdarva' on YouTube and he made a detailed video.
---
Unfortunately the only way I know of is to rank up.  I'm a purple rank killer on PC and killer lobbies take less than 1 minute.
---
STOP TBAGGING THEN jesus christ this is why i just leave
---
Not saying you can't roll dailies. But the category can be added up next to rift and tome challenges.
---
I just think it would be more fun if those boxes would do something different from what his gas already does. Maybe remove health state only if already healthy, maybe just push in some direction and bodyblock some area for several seconds.
---
I like how many different options Freddy has, I think here it should be the same.

Demofam Unite ! ,justice well served. take my upvote !
---
So many badly drawn pictures very shitty memes and lots of shitty legion cosplays.
---
That shows how little you know about killer then. Try playing below rank 10 and see if that still works. The game at its highest levels of play, which all games should be balanced around, is mostly survivor sided.
---
Did she message you afterwards?
---
PC: How are players pulling the instant 180's?  I've seen it other directions as well, almost as if on a macro.   Normally you can see their model turn, but these will just instantly snap to another direction and they are off.
---
Oh definitely needs testing, on paper does not directly translate to gameplay, for example this buff would most likely do absolutely nothing for Clown while on a wide open map like Blood Lodge while it would make him nightmare fuel on Lery's or The Game.
---
Giving Clown more stuff was kinda a thought of how they reworked Freddy and how the Demogorgon was implemented: They were given a ton of stuff to their kit and some of their passive stuff makes their main gameplay much more fun, such as Freddy being invisible at long distances to awake Survivors while his lullaby and Demo's portal obliviousness can make jumping Survivors very enjoyable.
---
The stealth process part of this was a thought of how Ghostface was actually pretty strong without any bonus mechanic stuff and sort of made me realize how much of a weakness the heartbeat actually is and how the less time a survivor has to react the more dangerous the killer seems to be.
---
Still, I dont think this would bump Clown to being as strong as Nurse or Spirit, I mean his slow does nothing to pallet vaults and thus he still needs to break a ton of them to catch aware survivors. I see your point though.
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
That's how it always seems to go ;-;
---
No not including mori. That’s so unfair. Tunnel right off the hook with red mori and addons would suck
---
Nice, that must have felt good!
---
I'm definitely going to have try out Oni but probably sometime later I'm burnt out. Besides him though how I see the killers
---
S+ Billy, Nurse (I should probably play her a bit more this patch but I'll keep her next to billy.)
---
A Spirit (Actually iffy on her after the patch), Huntress 
---
Middles: Myers, Dem
---
Low Middles Clown, Pig
---
Everyone Else
---
Then again I'm not even taking the pup system in to account because that actually tells you if you "Win"  Then pretty much  most killers would be knocked out.
---
You shouldn't be playing this game anyway if you cant have fun without the best addon in the game
---
And when the killer hooked her, he is just going to hook the hat and she is going to try to reach him (jumping).
---
The survivors to rescue her, are going to just unhook the hat and give it to her.
---
Is there a reason why you turned 180° before you picked her up allowing yourself to be exposed to the flashlight? This is either staged or shows your lack of skill/awareness.
---
I literally got this one in the first game.
---
I also did the sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement 3 times already but never had the challenge equipped ; v ;
---
*YES YES YES!*
---
surprised she didn't dc to assert dominance
---
Ghostface mori OP! How am I supposed to escape if I have to keep running over to moried teammates to photo-bomb?
---
Nope. She was probably too ashamed after being a toxic potato
---
But he looks cool
---
Lmao no it doesn’t run like ass. It’s quite the graphical downgrade but it has a stable FPS. And no console has cross progress.

I'd gladly die if I could finish this challenge. I lost track of how many games I've died with 2 stuns.

How about instead of a 4k its if they pip or double-pip
---
Aw shit, here we go again
---
IDK about that, some killer need add-ons, or they have add-ons that make them just amazing. Huntress with iri heads could just play forever. If you want to keep your add-ons just use a Black Ward.
---
I don't feel like it is as fair cause Killer add-ons (at least the higher tiers of add-ons) impact the game more than survivors item does.
---
Historically?  Because the matchmaking system was super easy to abuse to get easier killers/survivors.
---
Currently? The game will give you a +/- rank difference of 6 ranks, so the sweet spot for getting the fastest queues around rank 9, enabling you to go all the way to red, and down to the base of rank 15, which is the usual default for returning players.
---
Also because they are assholes who want to bully for entertainment than play a "fair" game.
---
Yeah either or it’s just if the game recognizes how well you did “the entity” says you did good son and let’s you keep the add ons
---
Yeah I definitely have to agree with you. A lot of people will play her twice and be like “lol nurse is trash now” when she really isn’t she’s just really difficult to play. I probably didn’t get a single kill for 20+ games before getting good at her. I regularly 4K with her now (not always). She struggles a lot on rotten fields and the new Yamaoka map is just broken for nurse. She can’t blink through the statues at all. I DC if I get the new map because it’s that unplayable for her. 
---
I still think that her blink cooldown should be be shorter then what it is currently but I don’t see BHVR changing it anytime soon so....
---
That was my strategy for a while since the math adds up. Trouble is getting a solid team to safe rescue and heal after the 2nd pallet drop and hook. I started running deliverance after being let down a few too many times. And then theres the killers who refuse to get pallet stunned. Glad you had luck with it.
---
And then the whole match turns into a disco with all survs (&amp; ghostface) teabaging and all killers spinning in the Strode house
---
&gt;Rework to Lerys, that's interesting, I haven't heard about it in the leaks by daylight.
---
"leaks" by daylight often leaks stuff that is already in the game files. Most of the stuff anyone can see without having to use other programs (like upcoming skins). 
---
They will "leak" everything they can find in the files during the PTB for the next mid chapter, in January.
---
Yeah, because if we're gonna have 4k's letting you keep shit you'll be encouraged use a mori every game lmao
---
This post was worth it to watch you baby rage and get downvoted to oblivion alone.
---
I use Mettle of Man, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike and Dead Hard on Ash. Cause he'd naturally fight against the killers and protect the Survivors (or atleast try to)
---
Thanks for proving my point. There’s no proper discussion to be held with you, because you resort to things like “lol u mad” and “you probably say” PROBABLY is the key word here. You assume things that don’t actually know.  
---
&gt;killers have powers which survivors don’t have  
---
This has got to be the worst argument I’ve ever seen someone come up with.  
---
Dead by Daylight: an asymmetrical horror game. Assymetrical. Assymetrical. Look that word up.  
---
And if you’re gonna argue like this: survivors have a power the killer doesn’t have and it’s called teamwork. One can distract the killer whilst the others work on gens.  
---
Try to come up with a response that replies to what I’ve actually said instead of responding to or assumings things I haven’t said/done.
---
Yeah. New killers are 100% screwed.  Can't get faster lobbies until you rank up, but nearly impossible because it almost exclusively pairs you with reds.
---
ur mom is milf
---
Bruh, try hiding in a musty ass closet waiting for this shit.
---
I need the source for this format
---
I fooled a Freddy into checking the locker I threw my Diversion at. He had just death hooked someone while I was nearby and was about to teleport to the other side of the map where my injured teammate was, but he cancelled his power and walked back to check the locker. It bought my teammate a little extra time to get away from there and has been the only time that perk has likely ever worked as intended
---
It's not that I can't have fun. It's the fact that every update the killers get nerfed and nerfed and nerfed EVERY SINGLE TIME. Legit these devs are ruining all the killers. Stupid how survivor sided this is even after the "balance".
---
The glaring issue with both of these is that stealth mechanics suck. It seems more balanced on characters like Michael or Spirit because they have indicators, or they're not stealthed all the time. Michael loses a lot of speed to stay stealthed. And gives up his tier 3 ability to instadown.
---
Spirit has to stop moving, and loses sight of survivors. As well as the noise.
---
Wraith can't attack without a loud bell, and taking time to reveal himself.
---
Ghostface has counters, if he's spotted. He loses his power. 
---
Giving clown straight upsides to his "Gas generators" is more powerful than you're realizing. Either take his bottles away, tone them down, or have a way to disable the gas. Like, a 10 second skill check on the gens that does no progress, but deactivates the gas for 30 seconds? Giving survivors time to do things in peace at the cost of time.
---
Oh it’s just a meg your fine.
---
*Samurai Shrek*
---
It’s markiplier losing his shit over the bite of ‘87 from FNAF
---
The issue is that people who play the clown spam that shit like they work for Avon.
---
I feel like I'm about to be molested.
---
This game is semi-competitive and there are far more difficult things than Ruin. If you dont have the determination to even try timing the space button currently then you **will** have a miserable time with this game. This is the kind of game where you need thousands of hours at to consider yourself a good player because there are just so many obstacles and you need to learn how to avoid them. You need to learn how to counter every killer and every playstyle if you dont want to die every round.
---
I assume your gf is a casual player who dont play much, so I suggest either she learns how to hit the skillchecks or one of you run perks to find the totem. If that doesn't work, then dont play the game and instead try something like Friday the 13th and Last Year.
---
The playerbase is doing just fine btw, as we're constantly increasing and there's no competition in the genre.
---
They were 100% released in 2018 before Clown even.
---
I keep hearing people say how awful it is. You like it though?
---
That is weird. I just assumed everyone got mostly killer dailies like me. I play both killer and survivor equally, so it'd be even more annoying for you, sorry man :/
---
Killer: Kills
---
Survivors:    :O
---
what about the grudge
---
Laughs in toolboxes
---
Oh yes, because sandbagging another player/working with the other side vs spamming an animation are equal levels of scummy :)
---
&gt;Maybe i'm dumb, but weren't emblems added in 2018? I could have sworn they were already in there when i started playing back when it was a ps+ free game
---
Doing some research on patch notes for early 2019, this is the only thing I could find mentioning emblems:
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/52295/the-emblem-system-changes-explained/p1?new=1
---
Bo- I meant, the 2nd one.
---
Instead of a 4K I think it should be a pip or double pip. Getting a 4K is kinda RNG with the hatch unless you slug
---
The pig just disobeys her own lore and let’s people escape the traps
---
premonition activates when U LOOK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE KILLER, spine chill tells u when the killer is lookin in ur direction, they are the exact opposite
---
Not to mention that every killer will eventually get their own unique chase music, starting with Doctor next week and already seen with Oni and Demogorgon.
---
Stealthy survivors are frustrating for both, the other survivors and the killer. 
---
They take so long to make a play such as running to unhook, simply working on a generator if they hear terror radius or running to a new generator after finishing one.
---
:(
---
You can do that by either bot moving from where you are and waiting for him to finish his turn or even moonwalking if you're scared of losing him again.
---
Plague: I'm every germaphobe's worst nightmare
---

---
Jack in the Box.
---
Are we turning into Naughty Bear again?
---
Speaking of that, when's Naughty Bear 2 or are they just gonna focus on DBD now that Deathgarden is dead?
---
Toolboxes are broken in numbers, one toolbox won't lose you the game. But a 4 premades with toolboxes might.
---
Maybe make it so you can’t keep ultra rares? As a killer main I’d be fine with this since most if the add-ons I use are yellow/green
---
Yea but it's still useless bcuz it doesnt matter if u look at the killers position....its not gonna be the same after 3 seconds...killer is gonna be somewhere else. Plus, if your Prem goes off...that means killer is near and is patrolling so hes gonna come closer to you soon so Spine would tell you that asap. Prem is toi unreliable and not accurate.
---
If you tap the item key while you have a flashlight it will instantly turn you.
---
I am tripping balls tho
---
Maybe because survivors have been constantly nerfed since release? Even a year ago the game was so survivor sided that a coordinated swf was literally impossible to win against. Its not even a nerf to Huntress's ability, but her busted addon. And dont pretend like they didn't make Freddy a top tier killer and are gonna rework Doctor.
---
I think it’s so amusing that they leave messages like that, I don’t tunnel neither I don’t camp, I play fair but they always get salty when I kill the four of them, I personally leave the comments as a Hall Of Saltiness.
---
While this is true and also more efficient not to be immersed, I used to find the game more fun while playing immersed at least as a solo player.
---
yeah doesn't proc anymore.
---
WGLF does literally nothing gameplay wise.
---
You’re fired
---
Are you ok? Do you know what a meme is?
---
Can survivors tell when stridor is in the game? Can they hear the difference?
---
I'm not sure Oni's sword is even the most likely thing to one shot a survivor, or even his kanabo.  Bubba's meat mallet is designed to 2 shot fucking cattle, paralyzing on hit 1 and **FATALITY**-ing on hit 2.  I know in the fucking movies that knocks some people out, but IRL taking a hit from that shit straight to the dome would be nearly as lethal as taking a bullet to the brain.
---
If this was yesterday in the hospital, sorry 😬
---
The best addon? Iri+Infantry does nothing for her windup or recovery time, and leaves her sitting at 3 hatchets. Yes 3 is annoying, though she's also spending 13,000 blood points on the combination.
---
You should be able to dodge 3 instant-down hatchets when you have 40 meters (her lullaby radius) to reach a loop that is safe against her hatchets/that she can be stunned with the pallet when turning the corner unless she swings wide and lets you get another loop in as a result.
---
Particularly with her 1.2 second windup time and recovery time after, letting you gain even more distance (especially since there are so many trees now).
---
I'm not convinced people who want to people who want to play Huntress with Iri+Infantry are doing a bad because she still has so many innate weaknesses and an incredible lack of map pressure, people who are actually decent dodge her hatchets at pretty much anything other than within a 10 meter range frequently enough.
---
It's like the devs want everyone to play Hillbilly because zooming around the map at 230% with an instant-down to snipe survivors before they can even reach a loop is okay, but stuff like Huntress/Legion/Wraith aren't ever allowed to stand a fucking chance.
---
Nurse blink moves 333%, Nurse's base kit is many times more powerful than Iri+Infantry, you're going to go down faster against a middling Nurse or Hillbilly than an Iri Huntress.
---
Played temple? Or against blight spirit on any map?
---
I mean, I feel that, but also, I'm going to continue to play killer out of spite
---
he's the killer who force the pallet down the fastest.
---
That's the whole point of his kit. Use bamboozle in addition and he's the worst killer regarding chase interaction for a survivor pov.
---
If you give him good map pressure in addition it's just stupid.
---
Ok you know about Freddy... why does he always seem to find me so easy in the dream state? Are the auras revealed to him when you fall asleep?
---
It's a new good (imo at least) show with quotable lines and in the same series as one of the most popular games of all time, it was inevitable it'd get endlessly memed.
---
Well what is the point of keeping brown, yellow or green offerings, those can be found very easily. And purple add-ons could also be game changing. No insta down hatchets. but you still have a lot of good purple add-ons.
---
Wow. Did you literally not read anything I said about it being different at Rank 10 and beyond?
---
Lisa is *hungry*
---
Yeah... I think I’ve heard that before but it was quiet so I assumed it was my survivor breathing
---
It's possible, but Konami is extremely hard to deal with
---
&gt;Making the game more accessible to a wider audience has been goal for us...
---
Oh no no no. RIP colorblind etc.
---
Listen, Bubba just wants to make sure the meat is flavorful enough before he eats it. Having to hook the meat more than once makes it tough and stringy :(
---
One killer. Literally one killer has gotten a rework. Mean while Oni got nerfed for no reason and we survivors out of no where complain loud enough for Spirit to get nerfed. Literally any killer that is good or just decent gets wacked by the nerf bat. Also The insta Hatchets aren't even the most op add ons. You still have to hit with them and at max get three. Like why even play as killer anymore when you have to deal the the devs being so incompetent and survivors either being toxic or hateful regardless of your play style.
---
Intense piano music is intense
---
This is very sad moment for us i usually just hook em and let them get saved (Red rank)
---
Have more than 100 hours on the switch version. Yes to both. I have no noticeable FPS drops. I primarily play PC and know not to expect PC qualities on a switch lol. People are being so over dramatic.
---
r/unexpextedshakespeare
---
Oh you sleeping on Hag my dude.
---
CI is better on killers that benefit from a 'set-up' phase, like Trapper, Hag and arguably Demogorgon.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted, this is correct.
---
Legion attacked the pallet, which removes him from Frenzy. ("Missing an attack ends Feral Frenzy" from the wiki).
---
This would let him break the pallet.
---
Wraith if anything is one of the weakest killers. Top tier would consist of Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly and Freddy
---
It’s called a blink but it’s pretty much the same
---
I always try and get the killer to pop gens we’re at and slug us so they can boost their stats up. Then towards the end I go to them to see if they just want to kill me via hook 🤷🏻‍♂️ But I get that every survivor encounter is different, you’ll probably run into entitled survivors that if you tell them they have to die towards the end they wouldn’t do it &amp; get mad or something. And yea asshole survivors exist sadly so I get your reasoning

Yes, sometimes you will get creamed and that's okay. I try to think "how could I have done better" and I usually end up having fun. And usually when I do well I get more hate mail than when I do poorly. Just remember it's a game and don't let rude players get you down!
---
Honestly I'd say the huntress is still terrifying. She gives those hatchets some fuckin velocity.
---
Spirit is cute.
---
CUTE!
---
Idk, I'm new to Reddit. I appreciate the insight of the downvote phenomenon. :)
---
Lol just a bit she's honestly pretty balanced but steam rolling a hag isn't to hard. I think the only hard thing about going against a hag is figuring out if you're playing against a hag. Because everyone runs ruin now (not that I could blame them.) 😂
---
Please, please, please, please, please!  That's awesome.
---
There shouldn't be an addon that requires you to have at least 3k hours in the game to have a chance against it
---
You said plague and clown 😂😂😭😭
---
The adam was weird
---
All you have to do w that add on is make it instadown when hitting a survivor further than, say, 32m away. Have it reduce your max hatchets by maybe 2-3. Rewards skill, and it IS an ultra rare. It should be powerful, but not overly so and require some skill to use.

People generally don't avoid the gas in a loop because it doesn't slow them down enough to make it unsafe. 
---
I'm not getting why you would say a survivor quitting a loop against Freddy is a con. Deciding not to drop a pallet is a huge disadvantage for the survivor. The maps are structured to give you just enough time after throwing down a pallet to make it to the next loop. If you decide to just leave one cause it's unsafe, your chances of survival have gone down, and you've also failed to waste the killers time. 
---
I would love it if people left a loop against the clown, but they stick with it because the gas does not make a loop unsafe.

Second Wind: Am I a joke to you?
---
&gt;Hi lovely people, can you still get the meg white mask by getting DeathGarden? Thank you
---
Yes, as long as you have the game added to your steam library.
---
Just teach her to push through it; its what I do cause I suck at hitting Greats. It doesn't set off a noise alert if you make a Good success, its just regresses a small amount.
---
You don't *need* to go spelunking for the  totem if you see Ruin, just tough it out.
---
Yes.  Like the movies, and games.  Slow, but swings that sword so fast, and has such a long reach you can't understand how you just got chopped in half.
---
Taking a quick look at your post history, you just hate everything, and post "memes" about how much you hate everyone.
---
I hope your life gets better soon.
---
I would suggest watching these vids
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C49wygOeZ5I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C49wygOeZ5I)  which killer to buy 
---
[https://youtu.be/Goi0knDvpGI](https://youtu.be/Goi0knDvpGI) well not which survivor to buy first but which survivor to get first at least
---
Not anymore, he no longer sees auras of sleeping survivors
---
You lobby is full of black peoples m8
---
* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
Shut up you fucking manchild
---
Even Demo screeched to the music!
---
Pretty sure 2000 means you did a full generator (1250) and half of another (625) for 1875 total, and then met a survivor at a gate (reunited, 200) as they opened it for a total of 2075 before escape, 7075 after.
---
I suppose it's technically possible to do that if you don't do anything else in the match without necessarily abandoning your team to die, since each survivor only has to repair 1.25 worth of generators to contribute equally to the actual powering of the gates.
---
But even then I don't see it meaningfully happening, since it means no other interaction within the trial whatsoever (not even cooperative repairs), not even just points for being in the TR without being chased...
---
It’s not op bruv you have to be injured to use it
---
The devs never planned for Oni to have a flick at all but with all the backlash they've gotten im sure they will buff it. As for Spirit, the nerf is barely noticeable. You have a vaulting animation now, that makes the whole killer useless now right? The actual nerf was to Prayer Beads, which was even more whack than Iridescent Head.
---
Yeah, the gap between survivor and killer BPs is ridiculous, especially when running BBQ
---
Again not a babyrage.  Just love this game and hate to see the sub watered down to almost nothing but shitposts and memes.  
---
Also "downvoted to oblivion"......they're fake imaginary internet points.  Only really sad people care about these things.  They only have the value you as an individual invest in them.  And ironically enough those fake internet points that shouldn't matter are the reason we have all the shitposts and memes.  We got members that don't give two shits about discussing the game or helping new players learn what they're doing.  No they subscribe so they can copy and paste the same  beaten to death horse image for the millionth time to farm these stupid things.  Seriously man you got a lot of growing up to do if you not only put any stock in fictitious points but care so much about them that you get off at the idea of seeing them lol.  In case you didn't blow your nut on the last ones here's another for you guys to have fun with.  These things don't matter lol.
---
Jokes aside, I still can't believe they keep those shadow men in the background... like, it just looks terrible. Not professional at all.
---
I do main killer and I don't get all the teabag hate. And getting someone on your team killed over it is a dick move.
---
Wow this mans a genius
---
They look like sleep paralysis demons
---
Thx.
---
I’m the same, I find it’s because you’re on your own, whereas you obviously have teammates as survivor (however good they may be lol). My stress levels hit the roof when I play killer and gens start popping
---
If Killer has very few tools to find someone who wants to hide, why not hide?
---
I'm not condoning urbaning around the outskirts of the map, but Stealth absolutely has a place in the game
---

If they didn't mesn to have it then they wouldn't of had slightly nerf it first. They would of out right wouldn't of had it to begin with.
---
Not really, to pip you have to do decent in at least 3 of the emblem categories. A camping/tunneling killer takes 2/4 emblems away from you. You are at best black pipping, MAYBE 1 person is getting a single pip out of that match, but nearly everyone else is either safety pipping or depipping.
---
Yes, it makes all sound effects louder to everyone. Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference though.
---
The perk Surveillance (which makes generator working noises 8 meters larger) also affects the entire map.
---
The hatch annoys me sometimes. Like I either slug for the 4K which I know is extremely unfun or I basically have to let the last person go with no chance to stop them. I understand why the hatch exists, but it’s just disheartening when you miss out on a 4K because someone sitting on the hatch
---
Can't tell if you mean that or just being a sarcastic. Gonna guess sarcasm.
---
That’s definitely true lol. More often than not you get shit teammates that let you die on 1st hook
---
I regret choosing this username all those years back. It is now haunting me.
---
I don't care. Might get you jext never know
---
Hell yeah. I thought I sounded louder in a random game but I died too early to wait around and see the killers perks lmao. Thanks for your answer.
---
Deserved it, Claudette.
---
Should have GTFO, and this is coming from a survivor main.
---
I'm pretty sure publishers can tweak the requirements for the achievements on Steam/for PC players; Steam Achievement Manager lets you give/take away all the achievements from your own account, so Valve themselves are not concerned with the integrity of Steam achievements/actually earning what you have.
---
No idea whether that's true for consoles, I'm not here to hate on consoles in general, but doesn't Sony/Playstation specifically charge the publisher a fee just to upload an update to their game? I think Xbox might too. It's kind of bullshit.
---
Steam and reddit forums are over there if you want to have the same few "conversations" that are even possible for this game.   If you are so concerned about the content of this sub, apply to be mod so you can jack each other off about how much better you are than everybody else.
---
And on the "stealthy" Survivor too. :)
---
I'll admit I raged at a teammate yesterday.  I'd stopped on the way out to let them heal me and as the killer approached, he body-blocked me and I couldn't exit.
---
I've never been so pissed in 1000 hours of play.
---
I find killer very fun and very satisfying when I win, or even when I get 2 kills. But the abuse you have to endure from survivors despite playing fair, drains the fun completely. I try to ignore it but sometimes I do have to switch back to survivor and take a breather lol
---
Survivors with no perks seems worse than killers with no perks but maybe I'm wrong.  Still new to the game.
---
A lot of hit perks should work with her hatchets
---
My friend is on the 4 gen version. We have been doing lots of swf's to help him but it's still a challenge, especially when our friends refuse to help him sometimes
---
Claudette gang dissaproves
---
If he has 2k Iri Shards, he can just buy BT from shrine, it's in there for 2 more days.
---
That’s true, the fact that I’ve experienced firsthand the toxicity of survivors is exactly why I don’t do it when I play survivor.

If someone actually gets salty over teabagging then that's just dumb. Tea bagging is apart of every game and it's almost a must. When Ghostface or Pig outplay me and start tea bagging, I laugh.
---
I usually find the hatch before them or there just sitting on it
---
nothing in the universe feels worse than hitting a Survivor after they vault and as you're wiping your weapon on the other side of the vault the last gen pops and they zoom all the way over to the other side of the map
---
Aha, thanks dude! I am still playing killer bc fuck toxic people, and the few games I’ve had recently have gone a lot better
---
That makes sense, although they could certainly implement more survivor dailies like some a the ones in the Archives-Heal 5 people off hook using the perk We'll Make It, or get 3 Head On stuns with Dwight or something. Just made those up, but they could definitely make up more dailies, be it perk-based or whatever, for both sides. As it is, I don't think I've gotten one survivor daily since November myself, so still think it's pretty lopsided :s
---
I used to, my logic at the time was : Spine chill tells me the killer is close, time to see where he is coming from \^\^
---
nowadays, I just check around me constantly with either of them
---
Lol.  Better not upset a very small percentage of the worlds population. 
---
Also you better not be immature, hurtful, or insulting when you're insulting something, or someone.   
---
Some random sensitive bitch somewhere might get offended, and tell people to grow up.
---
That’s good that it hasn’t happened to you I guess? But it happens to me a lot, and evidently it happens to others too based on the comments lol
---
Thanks for the response. Hopefully they fix this soon. Is the bug only on Switch?
---
That’s why you leave dawg
---
Rank matchmaking is half the reason I hate playing killer bc I am always paired with massively higher ranks than me. So frustrating lol
---
Lmao! I weirdly enjoy playing Hagasaurus Rex xp
---
That blood warden though. A well deserved ending for Claudette!
---
the issue is that there are so many band-aid fixes currently that increasing the time of gen speeds will just break the game. With Ruin, PGTW, Surveillance, Discordance, Thrilling Tremors, Surge, Corrupt, and the decent strength of combining slowdown perks like Thanataphobia, Sloppy, and Dying Light along with killers like Freddy it is hard to justify slowing down gen speeds and just leaving it like that.
---
All the stuff I mentioned would just get stronger, and nothing will stop killers from having an easier time locking down an area of gens and just making it impossible for survivors to win, not to mention the obvious scenario of if a gen takes longer for 1 survivor to die on hook (it's already rather close 80 seconds:120 seconds) then camping will actually become an effective way to win as killer especially with all the stuff I mentioned.
---
It already happens from time to time when survivors play super sloppily early on and they are already near death when 1 gen is barely done, there's no coming back from that anymore simply because they don't have time to do gens, I feel like scenarios like that would be more prevalent if JUST gen speeds were looked at, something else would have to change with it. I remember hearing a suggestion that if this were to happen, the best thing to change next to it would be survivor's time on the hook getting increased a bit as well, this will discourage camping even more, still hold up the match a bit, and also give survivors time to play more slowly.
---
I assume you're talking about the Yui? Claudette didn't do anything; Yui literally sandbagged her to click her flashlight.
---
I tried, man.
---
Collision detection's a bitch sometimes. Not sure why Dwight didn't GTFO.
---
1. You're going to die, and that's okay. Escaping a Killer is hard and often you will eventually lose your chases instead of getting away, so just aim to make your chases as long as possible
---
2. Don't waste the pallets as survivor! They are a precious commodity so try not to panic and use them right away
---
3. As Killer, look for tiny clues! A crow flying away, the sounds of footsteps. The smallest giveaways will help you find a survivor
---
Welcome to the fog and have fun :D Remember *dEaTh iS NoT aN eScApE*
---
But doesn't your non-dash demon lunge have shit turning? It seems like it can be countered the same way. Billy can juggle his chainsaw meter as long as he needs to for zigzaggers
---
I’d actually consider myself a survivor main, so it’s not really attempting to cater to killer mains, but they clearly share the same experiences. I made this post based on the games I had and just because ranking up is easy for some doesn’t mean it is for all
---
I sweated out a match of basement hooks in springwood for that damn tome challenge and only managed to get the last one there because they stopped wiggling hoping for mercy. I didn't remember til after the hook that I had switched to another challenge just before that trial...
---
Find some friends to play with and practice the roles, be patient theres a hell of a learning curve- and have fun with it. I find when i get tilted i play so much worse and then i end up pissed off. Play both sides too, its easy to hate on people for playing certain ways, but when you get a better understanding of how killers work it makes it easier to play survivor and vice versa
---
Worst feeling ever
---
Dude the pallet was great! GG on this tho, very cool.
---
As a survivor main, most of the toxicity in the game is from survivors. You can definitely get asshole killers too, but they’re less common
---
Don't be mean to Dwight. He's already been through enough :(
---
&gt;Yeah. It's big brain time.
---
in the moment prem activates u are supposed to use ur knowlege to track the killer, i didnt said it was better than sc, it has other uses
---
Hvent seen one still, whats it do?
---
It is very strange that PC killer wait times are so long bc on PS4 they’re like 30 seconds. Is survivor wait time short on PC?
---
He can forces pallets and be an overall fiend when it comes down to chasing ill give him that but that still barely cut it even just for chases he still takes longer than a skilled nurse, huntress and spirit with less map pressure than those three any team worth their salt will just genrush his ass into oblivion
---
I thought that it was that survivors were supposed to be able to climb. (which they ended up actually doing in blood garden) and that they had a planned killer whose killer power would be to wreck structures that survivors could climb to force them out?
---
A lot of the time I’ll find it first if they didn’t already know where it was. If they did, as soon as the person on the hook is dead, they’ve already escaped lol
---
Deja Vu: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ehckzc/do_u_even_hitbox/
---
Both threads are equally ignorant, mentioning hitboxes when this is textbook lag.
---
As a veteran nurse player that now plays ghostface and spirit as mains nurse is counterable. Its a way different playstyle. If you want any tips to go against these just dm me. Yes these killers are strong. But not op. All are counterable. Imo
---
That's probably because he used to stalk a girl he liked or something awful like that. It's ridiculous that an entire group of adult would left him alone for no good reason.
---
Oh I bet that was so sweet! I haven’t used a key yet so I can’t wait.
---
You mean...

Huntress: "I can snipe people from across the map."

another person who has no fucking idea what hitboxes are

nice

When legion active the frenzy, the terror radius gets the entire map
---
That would cause a lot of problems
---
Nah, you right.
---
Oh my fucking god
---
So don’t accept random requests from people you don’t know.
---
Yea nah...the pros dont outweigh the cons. Shit perk. Period.
---
Feels like they put a killer's hands on her.
---
can you just not do them? does it really matter to you what other people do?
---
I use CI on demogorgon and its easily the reason I am able to apply mad pressure from the start of the game
---
Oh shit
---
Stealth killers and Regression perks are pretty strong right now. A good player on someone like Ghostface, Wraith or even Myers can actually preform really well. While killers like Spirit, Billy, Nurse and Freddy still do very well, I’m actually inclined to say stealth is looking really good because catching survivors with their pants down means you have more control over chases rather than giving them a 4-5 second head start with your terror radius. 
---
Regression and slowdown have been the meta pretty much all over as a result of the “no heal, do gen, Adrenaline” meta so perks like Ruin, Pop, Corrupt Intervention and other info perks like Bbq and Nurses are still as good as they have been.
---
Rage
---
Well, it's knockout gas, so drinking it... oh!  What if it made him immune to pain, so if survivors tried to pallet slam him he'd just put his hand out and stop it from falling, and if he's blinded he'll just be blind and won't drop survivors because of it.  He'd get pain resistance for 45 seconds, or until after he stopped 1 pallet stun
---
I’ll admit that when I first started the game I would be a toxic cunt. The only time I was downed by teabagging, a teammate flashlight saved. Now if I’m at the gate I leave both because of a possible blood warden and not to be toxic. :)
---
Oh and someone please teach me how to add more than one pic to my posts
---
You can redirect the killer with the aura. You give better odds of survival to the person you saved by letting them run away instead of hide. Being able to run without worrying about tracks is a huge boon as a survivor. Especially for new players that don't have perks to mask their movements after a unhook.
---
 Endurance is cool late game when you want to get that person out of the exit gate. I play both sides of the game and as a survivor being unhooked and then tracked right after just because of scratches and blood is the most annoying thing in the world. I also appreciate being able to then use aftercare to find said person I saved and drop an adam heal bomb on them.
---
Ghostface: "Selfie time!"
---
poor bubby : ( do you know if he was actually trying to do the one challenge?
---
except that it's easier to actually lose a Nurse during a chase than a Clown. Yes you can't use pallet against Nurse but given her self stun mechanics there is room to escape from a chase against her. 
---
Against Clown it's just about dropping pallets instantly and running to the other pallet until he got you or until every not trash pallets have been dropped. Which means that your teamates can't rely on loop anymore. Which means the survivor weapon against Clown is to be as efficient as possible on gen, which is possible since clown does not have any map pressure tool.
---
Then its not lethal.
---
I usually play killer and when it's late game and I down someone who looped me for a decent amount and I don't hear gens pop on the way to hook I honestly feel bad because I know how it feels.
---
A few times when i've streamed i've put it as my steam name, just to see if i can gain a few extra viewers. I'm not toxic neither do i pretend to be good at the game, but i've gotten a few games with it where i just get tunneled, camped + nodded at or moried, which i can only assume is cos of the name. Its a really weird reaction..
---
hes running the tombstone and fuit gummy addons
---
Iconic
---
I play both killer and survivor and typically main killer and this post just comes off as salty killers mad that they can’t wreck people with certain killers like they used to.
---
Yea, it's annoying. Thanks for your empathy.
---
They certainly don't require farming. All of the master challenges can certainly be done in a single game although a few are certainly tough. The non master challenges can just be slowly grinded out in a few games.
---
Leerys is honestly fine.
---
Sucks for Huntress and Billy, but that's not gonna change.
---
There's more help topics on here than you're crediting it's just admittedly difficult to find them amongst the sea of low effort Karma Whoring that takes place here with the shitposts and memes.  There's plenty to still talk about and lots of new or struggling players in need of help that's the main thing that keeps me here.  I've had people thank me for helping them learn how to play better killer or survivor on here countless times and that's what keeps me coming back. 
---
I have zero interest in becoming a mod or censoring anyones posts.  They're free to post whatever dumbass zero effort karma farm posts they want to just like I'm free to criticize them for doing it.  I'm not going to be ran out of here by memes lol.  You guys do your thing and I'll just keep calling it out for what it is.
---
I didn’t think Lerys needed a rework but I’m excited to see what happens to it. Lol
---
Also a great film that is seeing a theatrical remake in the near future.  I especially like it when Atari Sega-Chan told Cindy the ancient Chinese secret that no, dumbass, not all Asians are the same and you're on the wrong side of history. Also, that Atari Sega-Chan is not her name and just because you say random Japanese car dealership names doesn't make you fluent in the Japanese language.

I just love my beardy bois. Bill and jeff are solid gold. Now Jake too. Plus jeff the real thicc
---
reminds me of the time me and my boyfriend were playing custom game and i was laurie crawling away from michael saying how i needed to go to best buy to buy another iphone 4 since michael ate the last one i bought
---
Well to sum up my thoughts, I beg to differ on stealth sucking.
---
Michael makes himself stronger through stalking but he doesn't make the Survivors necessarily weaker. A lot of his balance comes down to when you should attack right away when the Survivors have zero reaction time and when its good to pop evil within 3 and get a free down, its oddly similar to Leatherface in that timing since both cases are deciding whether you should secure the injure or attempt to go for the immediate down at the risk of a pallet or window being too close and causing that opportunity to go. There are many cases where making the Survivors injured is much stronger than trying and failing to get a down due to a loop being too close. I see allowing Clown, a killer who has no natural stealth and no natural way to one shot Survivors, to get the jump and first hit on a survivor as something that would definitely increase his strength, but the fact that the gen has oblivious and needs progress in order to start afflicting survivors with it is the warning that players have that they might get jumped by Clown. Come to think of it, the device on top of the gen immediately tells players at the start of a round that the Killer is the Clown, similar to how jigsaw boxes and trapper traps give away the Killer.
---
Spirit's stealth is much different in the fact that she's less a stealth killer and more a map pressure killer/chase ender killer. She is more comparable to the Nurse than the stealth killers in the fact that she doesn't use her "stealth" to really sneak up on people but rather to mind game chases and allow her to move across the map more unpredictably, as well as quickly. Spirit has a lot more going for her to the point where she doesn't necessarily need stealth to do her job so having the noise or her standing still give her away is balanced for her.
---
Wraith does have to ring his bell, yes, but his strongest add-ons either make his bell global and non-directional or it removes that bell all together. Without either of those he struggles immensely against mid to high rank survivors since the whole point of his stealth is to secure that first hit. It is also some of the logic of how I want to buff Clown: allow him to get the first hit more easily.
---
As for Ghostface, well when he goes on survivors who are on gens myself and many others have discovered its just better to not use the stalk and just go for the injure since it gets them off the gen and makes them too scared to repair again and force them to heal or they take a risk of trying to finish the gen and potentially being downed without a chase. When I stalk the Survivor  gets plenty of warning and gets away to a loop easily unless they are out in the open (similar experience to myers tier 3 or leatherface chainsaw: only do it when the survivors have nowhere to run). So usually using Ghostface as an m1 killer that can manually stealth and move at full speed is much better than stalking in my experience.
---
"Giving survivors time to do things in peace" is where I will heavily disagree with you. From an opinion standpoint survivors should NEVER do their objective in peace unless they absolutely know where the killer is, they should always be on their toes unsure of when they will be attacked if they do not physically (also aura reading) see where the Killer is (or where there friends are telling them where they are in the case of swf). There are many things that negate the power of this as well, such as perks (spine chill, alert, premonition, ect.), items (mainly keys), map knowledge with killer patrol routes (seeing the killer and knowing he isn't coming back for x amount of time, or repairing a gen the Killer knows is not worth defending due to position), SWF comms sometimes, and just the fact that the Clown's normal gas (not gen gas) causes Survivors to scream and thus lets you know someone else is being chased on top of the Clown himself being fairly easy to see from a distance, being the glorious fat bastard he is. All of this combined with the fact that if Clown does get the jump (and assuming you dont let him grab you off the gen) its still just the first hit out of two, he still needs to catch you at potential loops and you still have time to delay him for your team to get work done.
---
Now this last part is a little bit of a rant so take it with a grain of salt.
---
I think a lot of people forget that as a survivor on a team, your job isn't to loop the killer for all 5 gens and get out safely, your job is to waste the killers time enough to where going for you isn't worth going after the other survivors. To put in perspective: a gen takes 80 seconds without any other factors (including skill checks), it takes a competent killer roughly 20 seconds to land the first hit on average if the survivor is not at a super strong loop or is not completely out positioned on a good chase. It takes another 20 seconds if there are no super long loops nearby to down the survivor, it then takes 5-15 seconds to get to a hook, then another amount of time depending on the map to find another survivor. The Killer has to do this 2 more times on the survivor they hooked and 3 more times on everyone else. Survivors just need 80 seconds to pop 2-3 gens on that first chase. Every second the Survivor can waste in a chase is huge miles for the survival of the whole team and I think a lot of people do not realize that.
---
Overall I do appreciate your criticism and I think it has a lot of value, but there are a lot of things that the Survivors already have going for them, in the standard game and against the Clown as is, that makes many of the concerns not as big of an issue as they might sound alone. Perhaps there could be a way for sabotage to have an effect on the gas gens, but preferably id like to see how powerful it would be in a ptb before suggesting ways to reduce its power. Thanks again for the feedback!
---
Spirit: runs at the speed of light while invisible.
---
Susie: pinches teens with a broken ruler.
---
Literally no one said that.
---
He has cosmetics where's brighter. He's even got a santa suit.
---
Naturally y'all come up with excuses for why survivors are allowed to sabotage each other's challenges, just not the Killer's. Both are bad, just let them get the challenges done so they don't have to fuck people over anymore.
---
I finished it
---
I don't think many iri heads huntress do pip.
---
I totally agree! They did a fantastic job with the story in the first one. It's pretty common for developers to add "twists" to the story, especially in a sequel. I just hope they don't butcher it.
---
S-s-sorry to disappoint... °~°
---
I've personally been lIking Corrupt a lot more lately. The smaller starting zone is easier to pressure while ruin can sometimes be impossible to defend.
---
Shhhhh let him have this ok
---
Unless he has the add on which reveals auras when a survivor interacts with a Pallet or Snare
---
Myers: *heavy breathing*
---
They're keeping that, but they're changing the passive field into a second ability. So it'll be:
---
M1: Attack
---
M2: Beam zap
---
Active Ability Button (same as Dead Hard): Area blast zap
---
I'm usually breaking dull totems of there is about 1 gen left cuz I don't wanna deal with NOED. Sorry
---
What are the best perks these days? I have recently got into the game again but this time on PC. I haven’t played since legion was released on PS4 to give you a timeline.
---
You’re expecting people to stay on a gen for 115-150 seconds depending on how well they can hit the great skill checks. That’s 2-2.5 minutes per gen. I contend that is obscene at Rank 17.
---
Stop it.  Survivors don't have a single perk on NOEDS level of crutch at this point in the games meta.  I don't want to even slam NOED Gamers right now but the ones that pretend it's just another perk and survivors have all these equivalents just shove off with that noise lol.
---
they will if they were in
---
Aw man haha yeah I guess that makes sense!
---
I played her once for a daily challenge and got dabbed on by what I suspect was a swf so... I binned the challenge and vowed never to play her again 😂
---
How does he have shadowborn on his billy already though?
---
“Don’t play the game.” At least you’re upfront and honest about not caring how small the player base is. You all act like Rank 16-20 is some god tier MMR that needs to be really challenging to be fun.
---
There are ranks for a reason and using perks meant to slow down the game at higher ranks seems ludicrous.
---
K
---
What about hillbilly? He revs his chainsaw and survivors drop pallets like they're hot
---
Atleast he got a sweater

---
Meh, I dont like not doing anything. If i see a totem before a gen I'll pop it. If anything getting chased first alot helps me get better at loops.
---
I was just saying that the people who were nerfed needed a nerf. Spirit still has little counter play and nurse can still ignore safe spots of survivors all they did was raise the skill needed.
---
Hopefully they twist up the clickers intensities and just make look even more gross.
---
It's a mental win. Because even though mathematically it isn't significant the game makes the survivor feel like healing will speed up gen speed when really they are losing time. This gives the killer more time to get hits. On the other hand if you are playing a M1 stealth killer where you can easily get that first hit in then survivors are again pressured to heal and wasting time. Most killer perks are designed around making survivors waste time. Perk isn't bad it's just counterable by survivors which is fine. Also better on killers like the legion who like to 4v1 instead of 1v1
---
I did this once to get the NOED challenge done and ive never felt worse. I profusely apologized to the one i camped on hook. The challenges make me play in a way i despise. 
---
When it happens to me though, i just Ghostface sigh. No use in getting angry over shit that'll happen again eventually.
---
Instead if teabagging I pointed at a huntress and lost the same way. Was deserved. Still hilarious
---
Clown bottles and hag traps don't deal damage themselves.
---
I can opt not to do them you are right, however almost every game I have played as a survivor has been a trapper trying to farm or survivors throwing the game so they can do their challenges.
---
I switched to killer and find survivors playing like idiots to try and get flash light saves or chucking pallets to get challenges done and if they don't get them or I don't let them then they just DC. 
---
I can choose not to do them but I am a solo survivor and will always run into one person playing like an idiot to try and complete a challenge.
---
Wait how did the pallet go back up..
---
It was a bug.
---
Not really an option if you have The Rift Pass. Some of these challenges just encourage "not-so-good" behavior. Or they're just super specific for no reason
---
Yes most definitely. The killer has alot more choices to make than survivor. Like when your mid chase and you run by a gen with 2 people on it at like 85%. If you stop the chase to push them off and kick it, you could end up losing all 3 of them.
---
I agree completely but it seems like a lot of people on here main killer and are mad they’re trying to balance out some of the stronger killers and are pissy if people don’t join in their anger.
---
"I use NOED on Michael for that sweet extra kill"
---
You can drop the Michael qualifier, that's literally the reason every NOED gamer runs the perk regardless of their killer selection 
---
The truth about NOED is it's a perk for beginners which I believe you said you are so use it on any killer and don't feel bad about it.  But ultimately after you learn the basics of the role you'll hopefully outgrow it and move on to a better perk that'll actually help you prevent endgame from happening period.  
---
The issue with NOED is it won't teach you a thing about how to play better killer and it will actually instill terrible game losing habits like over committing to chases and not pressuring gens.  Also good survivor groups and EVERY decent swf will cleanse your totems meaning it's a waste of a perk slot.  Basically NOED only reliably beats bad survivors which you don't need anything special to gameplan for anyway.  Those types of players will die regardless.
---
Once you get a few more miles on your vehicle I'd swap it out to a perk that either slows gen progress or helps to end chases faster.  That's how you end games with gens up which is how you have to play if you want to beat strong survivors.
---
Didn’t expect league here tbh
---
I use it on hag and trapper all the time, I love it
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little shit? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.
---
I didn't say they do but they definitely encourage it. It is significantly easier to get bear trap challenges with farming which is why I swapped to killer for the last couple of days. I want to play the game not step in someone's trap over and over because they want a cosmetic.
---
it's not that simple. there is a "mindgame" around dropping or not the pallet against Billy. The clown forces you to drop the pallet 'cause even if you win the mindgame you are too slow to manage to do one more loop.
---
Yup, or deciding whether to commit to chasing someone or leave them to find someone else or patrol gens etc. With survivor, there’s less pressure to do the right thing/make decisions
---
In my opinion the Neonlight or something like that. It looks awesome (Don't use tho, PS4 here).
---
You can visit r/PerksByDaylight
---
I agree. What do you play on?
---
I don't get it though why wouldn't you want to make the game balanced?
---
PS4, unfortunately lol. You?
---
Same!
---
My build is Corrupt Intervention, Pop Goes The Weasel, Enduring, Spirit Fury. 
---
Corrupt makes every map smaller at the start which helps you Feral Frenzy multiple survivors to get people injured. 
---
Pop to regress gens
---
Enduring allows you to use pallets to get out of your power quickly. Spirit Fury can you get you an easy down. 
---
I've seen a lot of success with this build running no perks against red rank survivors.
---
No but unlike legion, you can actually down a survivor using your power.
---
ok
---
The incentive is janes ass tbh
---
I don’t see where you said how objectives would get done
---
Wow, I see karma is working beautifully as intended.
---
Their version of fun is running through survivors and not getting much resistance is my assumption
---
OTOH the Clown sounds like he's having the most fun of any killer. Everyone else alternates between "screaming in rage/constipation", I'm pretty sure Clown laughs heartily even when someone slams him in the head with a pallet.
---
And as a killer it's so fucking annoying/stressful trying to secure a kill at the end when the doors are open and the other 3 are weaving in and out trying to save the last guy on the hook.
---
Now for females put them in bikinis.
---
Starting with jane
---
Depends on the time when you got hooked.If you did about 2.5 gens and cleansed a totem or two,you probably already have iri lightbringer,and probably gold chaser too if you did get some stuns.If all the gens are done you already have silver unbroken and benelovent depends on if you healed/safe unhooked someone.
---
Well yeah being over powered is fun in a single player game. Although I actually do have a lot of fun fighting nurses and Freddie's I dont like spirit though.
---
It's not actual fact at all.  I play a lot of Freddy I love Freddy.  But he's a top 3/4 killer I place him at 3 just over Billy personally.  The top two are still Nurse and Spirit.  This was indisputable until the reworks came out.  In all honesty said reworks didn't knock them from their spots at all but did raise the skillcap a bit for both players so basically all the fake Nurse and Spirit players that relied on shit like Omega Blink, Prayer Beads and Collision try to tell people they aren't good now but it's nonsense.  They just never knew how to play them from the beginning.
---
I got lucky with a very accommodating friendly.
---
So your line of thinking is that he was banned for doing it in KYF, and not for the times he did it on live? knowing that he did it on live?
---
huffy., but why didn't 180 when you picked her up tho?
---
*bill with 1000 hours has entered the chat*
---
*deliverance d strike and adrenaline have entered the chat*
---
Nurse is still the best killer
---
No ding if you run urban evasion though.
---
You are also not taking into account the killers at the same rank. Just like the survivors are not good at ruin. The killers aren't as good at tracking, chasing, and just making good decisions in general.
---
Ormond, Crotus Prenn, like any Coldwind map devs? Instead you choose fucking Lerys?
---
Survivors bad... Killer good...
---
&gt;toxic potato
---
I'm stealing that.
---
For killer, it's BBQ, Hex: Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel. Of course there are some perks that work very well on some killers but not others, so it depends who you play.
---
Survivor is probably Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Spine Chill, Decisive Strike
---
No but then it's even more annoying when you don't pip cause everyone just DC:d sop you lose your offerings. I just think killers shouldn't have the ability to keep add-ons. Maybe if they double pip one random add-on would be saved, but not both.
---
the guy literally said against a camping/tunneling killer.
---
If you are the one not being chased, you aren't getting Evader or Benevolence.
---
If you are the one being chased you aren't getting Benevolence or Lightbringer, and chances are you won't get a good Unbroken since the killer is on you all match.
---
you also highlighted another problem, 2.5 gens, you think there's enough to do 2.5 gens to do across 3 people while the killer hugs the 1 person on the hook?
---
a match where the killer tunnels and then camps right off the bat is beneficial to nobody in that match.
---
it will be available forever
---
do borrowed time and we’ll make it work well together or is having one over the other a better idea/ also do they activate at the same time?
---
About 122-125 seconds on avg. if your potato rank killer is running Ruin III (which will not be 100% of the time at that rank) and you hit all Goods on average 6.4 (so 6 or 7) checks yeah.
---
It works.
---
Perk that's meant to slow down the game actually slows down the game 40-ish seconds, go figure.
---
It has happened to me but it's very few and far between. Most of the time i get a gg or just silence, regardless of if i get a 4k or can't hit a single person the whole match. I just find it really difficult to believe that some people get this every other game as they claim. I've been playing for over a year now. I think that people just focus on their bad experiences, and don't remember the other 10 times they didn't get trash talked before that.
---
Those the 3 hairs I use  too expect I use the purple version.
---
It's my add-on
---
People already d/c against Iri Heads if not just suicide on hook was my point since if people just die on first hook or d/c you basically aren't pipping at high ranks.
---
I wait there when there's no killer so that way of someone manages to get injured I can save them before the round ends
---
I really like David's, but I'm a biased David main too. But the general gist is how his life pre DbD is that he genuinely didn't give a shit about anyone but himself, when he got banned from rugby he didn't care because he had the money and just got in fights and got drunk, then all of a sudden he's in the Entity's realm and he's a team player who lives for the thrill of the chase, which I think goes well with how his perks work, NM and Dead Hard for the chase, obviously WGLF that he'd do anything to get someone out.
---
In terms of a custom perk build what'd suit David for example? Decisive and MoM easily because they're something David would have in context as David's perks are sorta catered to getting the shit beat out of him and getting back up ala NM, MoM fits in that context of WGLF as it now requires Protection hits, the other two? Either NM or Unbreakable because again, getting the shit beat out of you and then getting back in it and final perk MAYBE Adrenaline as David lives for the rush.
---
Wow what a nice argument
---
Resilience is slept on hard.
---

Super cute! What perks do you have with her?
---
\^ this man gets it
---
Same here. I got him during the Black Friday sale and I don’t really have any problems with him. Feral frenzy is basically a detection perk that you can injure 4 survivors within seconds and then start downing them after.
---
I find that we'll make it works in more situations, but borrowed time is a good way to get someone off the hook while protecting yourself since they usually try to take a hit for you. As for running them together, I'd say it would be better to swap one out so you don't have 2 out of 4 perks revolving around unhooking.
---
Oooh Speedy response =\] thank you I'll check them out.
---
A part of me wonders if its rank related, but as a killer from rank 20 to 1, it's been around the same (with higher ranks being slightly faster)
---
As a survivor with over 1.3k hours It's gotten a bit worse. I wait around 2 to 8 minutes to get a lobby now and I'm rank one. A year ago, it'd be less than a minute to find a lobby as a surv.
---
She broke her legs so she can't walk and floating is very hard when you are doing it constantly okay?
---
I think it should be one pip keep addon 1 
---
2 pips keep second one also
---
You went through all that trouble and didn’t get the portrait size the same. :/
---
The time is pretty large before rank 15. This is because the only way to be under rank 15 is to be new to the game or to leave the game for a time while your rank slowly drains down. Once you hit 15 it does go a lot smoother.
---
Not doing it the whole time and switching from camping to not camping is evil too. I mean, yeah, it SOUNDS better, but then the survivors just don't know weather you'll fuck around with the guy you just got so they can do generators, or if they should try and save the guy if you're not their. Pick one, please! You can't legally fuck woth our heads like that 😣
---
Happy dead day: Killer Babyface (Lori) Survivor: Tree Gelbman ( her perk is  resurrection after 4th hook but in exchange 1 generator will be reset)
---
Fixated, calm spirit, inner strength and my last one is either balance landing or borrowed time so i can make saves.
---
Use your charge tactically more than offensively, along with the cassette tape if you have it to make your charging better. Helps when dealing with loops and getting over gaps on second stories when survivors are on the other side teasing. Bear trap people early game to ensure they get their use, as it won't work once all the gens are done. Remember that there are times when you are better off not sneaking around and to just go for the survivor. And keep in mind any time a survivor is exposed, the charge will ignore the exposed state (one health state instead of insta down) , so don't rely on it if you have the opportunity to get a clean hit off. Other than that, practice. As for Perks, to each their own, but honestly imo survalience is amazing for Amanda, along with sabatoge to make extra sure you know when a Gen is being fixed
---
I want Monika from Doki Doki literature club
---
I just think his bottles need a range and projectile speed buff to act more like a hatchet. They don't go very far so you can't really hit a far survivor while they're running away
---
My solo queue teammates run it down mid all day so why not 🤔
---
If that person did everything, they can go. Dummies who sell their team are dummies
---
Sure, Haddonfield and Ormond are super survivor sided and need a rework, but treatment theater is... nobody sided. I think it's the least fun map in the game, and can't wait for the makeover.
---
Bc there hadn't been a flashlight up until then. So I didn't have a reason to be careful
---
I find this an excellent idea, but I would go for a drink that helps with tracking.
---
Maybe it's just me, but I have trouble actually finding survivors on clown, more so than with other killers.
---
So what I'd like would be: drink from a bottle, gain a cooldown to throwing and drinking any more bottles for, say, 30 seconds.
---
The bottle's effect should be something that helps with tracking: it could be important like survivors having to laugh hysterically at the clown when they are in an 8m radius (which would make him a bit similar to the doctor's tracking) or something small like "glowing" survivors like with Freddy
---
Whoah. I googled it and it actually makes a lot of sense that BHVR already did a game like that before.
---
Locker sounds pretty fun btw. Especially if you don't have to actually open it but rather be in a vicinity of it, something like Head On cone. You can make the shack actually dangerous this way.
---
Regarding their focus on DbD - I think they will do something else eventually, DbD is pretty old already. But they are probably have a heavy focus on it right now.
---
Spirit not getting collision while using her power is a nerf as well but it's still risky to double back as survivor
---
Yes, that’s exactly what I, a survivor main, am saying. You can be critical of toxic players without saying every player is like that
---
My hag would always have invis traps. That'd be OP
---
I don’t think it’s necessarily swfs but just a group of competent survivors in general. That just happens to be rare outside of swf lol.
---
CI is so nice on huge ass maps like Ormond and Temple. Honestly wish they had a competitive mode where the map you are going to get is announced and offerings can't affect it so you can actually choose an appropriate loadout.
---
Maybe it if was a double pip. Cause if it was just a 4k or single pip, strong addons would never leave your inventory. Atleast with a double pip there has to be a solid performance shown.
---
If you're any good with Huntress, iri+infantry is an instant 4 kill
---
You may be forgetting the times where Survivors didn't need a second chance in the game because you wouldn't actually catch them in the first place lol
---
why the response a month later
---
nope, none of those here
---
A still image. You could also market it as the “iconic dbd infinite load screen bug cross stitch”
---
When I used to be higher rank killer, the lobbies were still very short wait times. Low rank survivor is fairly quick but once you get to green ranks, in my experience it becomes a lot longer. I’m rank 6 survivor and I have to wait around 10+ mins for a lobby
---
Interesting build you're using there
---
Dude shut up kissing killers ass.
---
I’m sorry can’t hear you over my campfire. It’s a cracklin! Haha My point is that I will put someone on the hook or the whole team multiple times, and leave them be but if one person has been tea bagging, beaming the flashlight in my face for no reason and just a straight up asshole I will camp them. No one else.
---
So many survivors play this game on autopilot.
---
Oh the opportunity!
---
Doing one of the many "faffing about" challenges from the tome (like looting god knows how many chests)
---
If a survivor brings No Mither to a game against any killer, they're gonna die real fast.   
---
Also, if you wanna force survivors to not heal, just play Plague or Legion. They are way better at it. The entire point of the Oni's power is to instantly down survivors, which loses a lot of its point if people just don't heal. Survivors not healing isn't a bad thing for him though, it's just infinitely better for killers that retain a useful power past that point (i.e. Huntress, Hag, Spirit, Nurse, Trapper, Wraith, etc.).
---
Nah, I had about 3 games in a row that were like this. Maybe not all 4 of the survivors, but at least one. If you lose, they mock your inability. If you win, they call you a tunneller or camper lol
---
I get it. Like I get feeling potentially targeted but also does that make it fair to lash out at people?
---
You can use both together if you want, but they are both normally used in different situations.
---
Borrowed Time only activates if you are inside the killer's Terror Radius while unhooking. If the killer has no TR, or you are outside it, BT doesn't do anything. BT is great for when the killer is camping the hook or patrolling the hook area. It's also good for making saves before the hooked survivor reaches the next hook state.
---
We'll Make It will always activate after you unhook someone. You can still use it if you unhook someone in the killer's TR, but you might want to get further away before healing. If you're playing solo, sometimes it's difficult to get the unhooked survivor to stay and get healed. By chasing after them, you end up wasting the time you would have saved by running the perk. I'd still say that WMI is a higher tier perk though.
---
Nice thank you, I've been struggling with her Charge honestly and I've been noticing how usful it can be. Did not know about the exposed state, so thank you for that tid bit!
---
Game is more fun when played like Naked Snake if you’re alone, can’t change my mind
---
Mmmmn I dunno. Playing both sides, I think both are super equally shitty. I’ve met some douche survivors and some toxic killers. Scales are pretty even from what I’ve seen.
---
Doctor Pimple Popper going to work.
---
Thanks but I have no friends :D
---
I like to think the Yui blocked her deliberately
---
No face camping in the halls
---
Never understood these cosmetics. In the lore she is a shy, nerdy botanist and yet in her cosmetic store, she is wearing fancy dresses and outfits for high class parties or for clubbing.
---
I mean for sure there are times where people are just overreacting. But the general seems that people feel personally attacked.
---
The point is not about whether or not he should. The OP posted asking if it's good or bad to use it. All I'm saying is that the allure of using the perk is certainly there, but you'll be able to improve on your skills as a killer more if you don't rely on perks like NOED, because you can focus more on your early game and mid game pressure. Even Thanatophobia can do more than NOED if you practice with it, for instance. 
---
NOED is a trap for new players, because it counts on you performing poorly, and rewards you as the killer for letting the survivors finish their objective.
---
If you focus on builds that slow the game down instead, you'll learn better how to kill all survivors before even getting to the stage where NOED becomes relevant.
---
If you really like NOED, though, and want to try a stronger perk, that also has impact early on, try Rancor. It has a similar effect in the end game, but gives a lot of information early on.
---
as a killer main who hates toxicity, I fully approve of this. Fuck bubbas, they give us a bad name
---
Its the mystery of DBD
---
I love using mad grit to just nyoom around the map, not even hitting anyone, and survivors call me a cheater ;_;
---
the new perk Any Means Necessary allows you to reset pallets every 2 min.
---
&gt; Honeslty survivors that are toxic probably never play killer
---
I've played with plenty of people that are toxic that play both.
---
Hopefully this gets resolved. It just makes it even more annoying to do their tomes haha. Plus, it takes a stupidly long time (est over 200 hrs) to get to tier 70. But thats another story haha
---
That changes the whole perspective. Happy trails!
---
I’m gonna have to disagree with this one, bro. 
---
There’s //no// possible way to slow the game down enough to start snowballing with killers thatre below a certain performance tier. Ruin is needed for killers that aren’t as viable as spirit/nurse. Especially killers with low map pressure. 
---
Gens go far too fast sometimes lol
---
I think it was a bit too powerful and was another thing PC players had over consoles
---
You had a disconnect.
---
Wouldnt be surprised if its because you camped hooks like every other Ghostface I’ve ever faced
---
i just take it as it comes.  
---
some games there's just nothing you can do.   if they open gates hella fast, i wont even go to them.
---
Ty
---
Yeah but does she have a belly with specialy designed wiggle animation? NOOOOO.
---
Ruins pretty fantastic at low ranks when survivors can barely hit a good check, let alone great. Or spend half the game urban evasioning for it. 
---
CI for high ranks though.
---
Yeah, you're right. But shadow play, Re-live, and OBS are all free and easy to use, plus you can get a decent mic for like $35 on amazon.
---
I'm very confused by your title.  What is it you're attempting to communicate with this post?
---
This reply is the very definition of "entitlement".
---
Brilliant! The original was so good up until the R slurs started though :c
---
Yeah I learned it the hard way. One of her many nerfs unfortunately. But either way still my fav killer out there so I'll live with it xD. Just remember you can use the charge mid chase once you figure out about how long you have for it and can judge the distance. I've gotten a lot of survivors mid loop with it cuz I can go around the corner and get them on the other side of the pallet before they realize what I'm doing
---
I honestly don’t know why either but i guess shy and nerdy girls like to go out and look cute too lol
---
Can i use it to make  memes?
---
&gt; Just an idea I came up with like 4 minutes ago
---
ya'll need to chill haha
---
Me neither lmao
---
From what i’ve seen since I just found out about him thank god is that he’s horrible to teammates and whoever he is playing against. Just incredibly rude and toxic like one of the most toxic people i’ve seen.
---
Can someone explain the hype behind Nemesis for me, I see streamers running and it just doesn't seem like that good of a perk.
---
Survivors want less camping/tunneling
---
Killers want more time and overpowered loops nerfing.
---
It’s a tale as old as the game itself. Everything else on top if just gravy.
---
Me? I’d take those two and the removal of Ghostface.
---
it's on the wiki. some perks have hidden attributes that aren't in their description. Spine Chill doesn't state that it increases vault speed, but it definitely does. or at least it hasn't stated it for as long as I remember.
---
I’ve finished the killer challenges, I’m not ready for all the survivor ones :(
---
Decisive Light took me 15 games and I only got it when a low rank trapper tried to get us all in the basement and I managed to run out and get a save
---
it is crazy, I've had killers literally back up like 5 feet away from the pallet just to not be stunned by it. Normally I would take advantage of awful plays, but it just made me waste so many unnecessary pallets trying to complete these challenges.
---
I had to play like an idiot and die to even get these pallet challenges done. Meaning I had to literally let a killer hit me in order to get the stun on them because there was no other way I was actually stunning them with the pallet.
---
I mostly play survivor but occasionally play killer. So I have a pretty good understanding of what to do but am not great at executing. This leads to me destroying the people that should actually be near my rank on killer or struggling to get 1 or 2 kills against people higher ranks than me.
---
Michael: ..........
---
Jake: What, you egg?
---
Sure if a nurse isn't great there's a lot you can do
---
If a nurse is perfect, rip
---
Mori, NOED and facecamp
---
And some people wonder why the community is often so salty and the game full of disconnects.
---
I’m planning to bring toolboxes and immerse hard for it, and pray for a good team.
---
Someone suggested a good one a while back called “Black Candle,” or something like that, which would show a lit hex totem as an unlit totem. Thought that was a pretty cool idea.
---
Bored
---
Cool stuff thank you! Hoping to Main her so wish me luck!
---
Where is that post from?
---
My dailies are always pure killer ones and I haven't played killer in a long time.
---
Don’t be mean to my man just doing his tome :c
---
Good points, but keep in mind that having oblivious has it's own drawbacks. Good discussion, and I hope this is something looked at. :)
---
It does. It has the worst pallets in the game, from a Survivor perspective.
---
The nurse uses the power of #THE HANDO
---
Well, the third perk has to be ruin.
---
Adrenaline is the equivalent. NOED cheeses a few extra kills at endgame, Adrenaline allows a few extra survivors to live.
---
... You hide when the killer is approaching then do gens when he's gone? That's how good survivors stealth, which separates them from typical urban evasion gamers who hide all game despite killers not being near them.
---
That is true which I understand completely. Just sucks because it can actually be enjoyable sometimes to watch someone who is actually good with the nurse in action.
---
It's a bit disingenuous to have this mentality. Especially when it comes to toxicity killers are more likely to be given a free pass. Lag switching for example was hardly talked about in this sub reddit.
---
Fucking ghostface. Time to stare at him and NOT expose him.
---
Well the bottles don't do damage and currently they do nothing if you hit a survivor directly (with the exception of one of his ultra rare add-ons). So there is really little point in the bottles going faster. As for longer distances, he needs to be close enough to follow up a hit and properly use the bottles, the only situation that would be useful is to check far away areas if there are survivors at that place, which usually isn't possible to do at extreme distances thanks to how tree and certain props block that (not even mentioning some indoor maps).
---
The idea of the Clown is to throw bottles in places where you expect the survivors to go and try to "herd" them into an area where you can more easily hit them. His lobbing of the bottles is more so he can plant gas over small baracades and walls to hurt survivor's speed during a loop, increasing his projectile speed to make the bottles more straight would harm that aspect of him, so im not to sure about that idea imo.
---
Have you noticed the new wall textures in the central room? I think that's a glitch hinting at an outdoor area that will be included.
---
Probably someone who rarely plays killer and went through a few rank resets.
---
That's pretty cool! I recommend selling popular perks.
---
That’s a really good idea!
---
hurr durr
---
just because someone is shy and nerdy doesnt mean they dont party.
---
Luck! We need more pigs out there. She is underappreciated imo
---
Curtain Call. We need more Clowns.
---
The slowdown does add up when combined. At most optimal use of the 2 perks together you are getting ~30% slowdown on things, which isn't bad. Combined with other slowdown perks like sloppy, killers that can easily capitalize on injured survivors such as stealth killers, or killers that can keep survivors perpetually injured like Plague or Legion.
---
I think this is why these perks will never be substantially good on their own, simply because of how much damage they can do when used well together and in the right setup. Refer to Forever Freddy, especially before the nerf, for what I mean.
---
There are some good things that work off of an obsession, and unfortunately a few of them are held back by limitations. Like, Dying light having a hard cap on how many tokens you can get. Having the obsession change to a new person allows for some strategy. From what I can remember, there was only 2 other ways to change the obsession, and 1 of them was survivor controlled. (DS)
---
For example: Michael has an addon that makes stalking your obsession gain evil, faster. If you end up stalking your obsession to max, having the obsession change can now free up a ton more evil for you to gain. This is only 1 example.
---
It looks like Claudette took the hit for him? Or no
---
Could be someone who just leveled up the clown and has no other teachable perks. Also, ranks reset every month and this person could have not played for a long time.
---
Thanks! Oblivious does limit the usefulness of heartbeat perks like Overcharge and Unnerving Presence but I think it might have a place with Coulrophobia with survivors having to choose whether to be affected by that or risk healing in an area where they cant detect the Clown at all which I think would be a fun, if not small, interaction.
---
Why does it matter if getting an achievement is easier on survivor? It's just an achievement it doesn't do anything.
---
When ever people click flash light or be T0X1C I know they are new to the game lol
---
floaty hoety vs bottel boi

Imagine your main looking like a goblin when they smile and not adorable.

Quentin, you Gollum-lookin mother fucker...
---
I guess but he was really good
---
No she didn't, unless she tanked it without getting injured lol
---
Emblems were in but they did some changes early in the year to make it harder to pip
---
I guess but man he was really good
---
Just use Head On instead.
---
I myself stopped playing survivor for a long ass time and went from 2-3 to 20 lol so it does happen quote a bit with rank resets every month.  You keep your add ons and perks so you can be a rank 20 with all the perks easily.
---
Yeah I guess but he played amazing
---
Yeah, I remember my spine chill up while opening the gate and when I started to think about running, got a hatched on my skull.
---
Oh I thought tr still affected it also but it still proves the point of legion is not buffed and is in a bad spot right now
---
FUXK INDOOR MAPS
---
Where does it say he stalked a girl? Clearly not in his character description. We'll know more about him when he gets featured in a future Tome.
---
Yeah. I rewatched it and saw she didn’t get injured. Really weird.
---
Nah fam, Lery's does need a rework. It's pretty much only good for Meyers and Ghostface. Every other survivor and killer hates it.
---
No doubt. He probably was high ranked and didn’t play for a while.  It’s easy to rank up as killer at times so he won’t be rank 20 for long lol.
---
I only run HO if I'm just focusing on gens then run it with Spine Chill and Q&amp;Q+DWM
---
I’ve been complaining about this happening all holiday week. It’s been worse since the holidays. And it’s not that fun.
---
I know people don’t feel the same way but I still contend that certain perks shouldn’t be usable until certain ranks.
---
Thrilling tremors + surge = discount pop goes the weasel. Besides, surge is fun as fuck.
---
Thrilling + BBQ lets me know to which area of the map I should teleport to.
---
And yk, ruin. To slow the game down, just a little bit.
---
exactly
---
Btw, this is on PS4, so no dedicated servers.
---
I just didn’t know it he was a smurf or if it was a glitch
---
It's not my favorite map, infact it's close to one of my least favorite, but why are they going for a Lery's rework? I never really see anyone complain about the map being unfair or killer/survivor sided as it has it's pros and cons.
---
Especially when Haddonfield is remaining untouched.
---
Or are they only going to touch maps when they rework the killer to, i.e. Freddy and Badham. If that's the case is Haddonfield ever getting reworked anytime soon since Michael isn't even on their radar for reworks yet?
---
"The map is.. The Game!"
---
*all survivors dc*
---
Is self care bad now?
---
Oh stop man please not the tired false equivalency to Adrenaline.  They aren't comparable dude this is just something NOED gamers tell themselves so they don't feel bad.
---
Compare them and let's take that broken legged horse out back and let's put it out of its misery together.
---
Adrenaline activates as a reward for playing well and successfully repairing all 5 objectives.  NOED activates as a reward for playing poorly and losing all 5 of the objectives you were tasked to defend.  The same ones 25% of your rank are determined by.
---
Adrenalines Haste effect lasts 5 seconds, only applies to the survivor running it and is then gone forever.  NOEDS haste effect is permanent and can be used to chase and down every survivor.
---
Adrenalines heals one health state at the moment of proc just for those running it and then it's gone forever.  NOED removes one health state from and and all survivors and is permanent.  The totem just has to exist.  
---
Trigger event winner NOED
---
Strength of effect winner NOED
---
Feel free to run the crutch if you'l can't kill any other way I won't judge you or talk shit but please for the love of god stop spreading this false horseshit around here.  Post Decisive and MoM rework NOED stands alone as the single biggest crutch perk in the game on either side and it isn't even remotely close.
---
I'M All Ears, PWYF, Nemesis &amp; PGTW
---
Im all ears can work really well sometimes if you hide your red light correctly. Otzdarva made some good videos on it and it works especially well on killers who tend to keep survivors injured like Legion. Might be fun to mind-game some loops that are normally very difficult to mind-game.
---
Nemesis + PWYF combo shouldnt really work on legion since Frenzy hits count as a lethal action but it can be useful if the survivors decide to not heal. Moving at 130% movement speed is scary for an injured survivor. 
---
Frenzy with an extra 15% movement speed would also be fun. 
---
PGTW is just for stable regression to provide some gen protection. You could of course swap it out for another perk like M &amp; A.
---
It was somehow the hardest challenge of this latest tome for me. It got me going insane.
---
Plag: reeeee
---
If we get that before swimsuit Quentin I’m gonna be pissed
---
Sacrificed all of the survivors in Swamp’s shack basement on the same hook. The second meg I killed’s body disappeared, but I still got sacrifice points and she was out of the game. Happened with the Claud’s body that I sacrificed during the end game collapse. Not sure if I wasn’t supposed to sacrifice them all on the same hook or some shit but I guess I just got outplayed by the archive :/
---
Ah yes, people cleansing dull totems for a noed that probably only occurs once every 15 games
---
It can only be once every 2 minutes a.k.a. 120 seconds. Maybe if some killers broke pallets instead of bloodlusting them this perk would be halfway decent?
---
DS is only meant to prevent tunneling and give a survivor room to breath.
---
Head On name is fake it's actually called Bug On, because like dead head it only works half the time.
---
Rank resetting to 20 doesn't mean he's not gonna be good
---
I wonder if putting them on the same hook somehow bugged it? Like it ended up counting as just one sacrifice in the basement
---
ive been trying the perk blood echo from oni, its really cool, works well with bbq, im green/purple ranks, but i think u can make it work in reds
---
I once got reset to rank 20 on survivor and killer out of nowhere (not on rank reset). I complained to the support, but they didn't do anything, so I had to butcher my way back to red ranks lol.
---
But to be fair, I didn't use perks until rank 10.
---
Sweet thank you!  I’ll definitely try it out. It would also be cool to see  if and how Nemesis and PWYF work on Legion.
---
Demogorgon is my favorite for humbling cocky survivors at the exit gates.
---
Probably haven’t played killer in a long time
---
I have a question. Is it rude to just stand at the exit and let them hit you before you go out? I was told once it was OK because everybody gets points for it. If this is rude I’ll stop doing it. I don’t teabag. I do sometimes wait in the gate and now to the killer before I leave if it was a good game.
---
Looks like the hotboxes are broken for killer as wel haha. That’s some bs bro
---
Yeah I have a lower ranked survivor as I mainly play killer and prefer to make the game fun and not a chore, sadly as a low ranked survivor the games aren't to joyous.
---
What exactly is a protection hit?
---
my strat was using bond to stick to the rest of my teammates like a leech so they couldn't get any gens done without me.
---
Yeah I mean to be fair, I also sometimes get some hits that should have missed.
---
I’ve seen this meme about a million times now with wraith and Claudette. Just saying
---
A clown has all the clown perks max and bitter murmur level 2, oh no!
---
Do you have it selected?
---
Yeah at rank 20 you seem to have missed the point
---
It’s selected in the screenshot lol
---
Oh lol
---
Dead Hard is better
---
Just didn’t seem right but I get your point
---
Waiting at the exit gate without tea bagging is fine, and letting the killer hit/down you as you escape is good sportsmanship :)
---
If I know someone is waiting at the exit gate then I'll put on a show and moonwalk in front of the exit gate. Those survivors usually approach me and we'll have a friendly encounter
---
I've done this multiple times as survivor. I deserved every hook, but usually I still pip after so hopefully the killer does too. Plus, as killer, that's the most satisfying sacrafice. Win win
---
Im talking about ds. DS gives you a forcefield, that shouldnt exist in a horror game. 
---
There are too many perks that take the horror off the game, and most of you dont even see it
---
Demo boy is underrated ngl. I'm just starting to learn him and I can usually secure a 3-4k in red ranks
---
Plus they can vault pallets and it breaks them afterwards
---
it's sad because you wouldn't be able to do that at all normally. you SHOULD be able to do that normally. it's sad because after the tome ends, we'll just sit there wondering why it's taking so long to get bloodpoints again.
---
Michael Myers: *BREATHS*

I’ve never used it on Legion so I’ll have to try it.

I believe most cosmetics are listed in the files as available with shards, it's likely something that they can toggle at will, like when they used to put auric only sets on sale for shards every now and then.

Bro people survive a chainsaw to the back right after being lifted off a hook and ate able to  run at the same speed of their mates even after stepped in like 7 traps, These survivors are mad strong surviving a katana to the back isn't that unlikely to them and the spirits probably much stronger then she looks cause well she's one of those Japanese folk tails about angry spirits seeking revenge and I promise you in horror games those spirits do more damage then any other fucking killer I've ever seen
---
it will be fun
---
I had it happen to me when the 3rd person was ass with their attempts to bodyblock and got downed outside basement.
---
Sure
---
I love the game but the damn fan base kills it for me sometimes
---
Made my day.
---
and i was right about the downvote thing :)
---
there are too many people that think that its completely okay for a survivor to run op perks but then go on and cry when a killer does it too
---
its called double standards and its that one thing that is really annoying about this game. You do good for a match and instantly some stranger messages you and tells you that you suck because you used noed, while that guy used adrenaline aka survivors noed.
---
Im really trying to enjoy both sides, im playing more survivor now because bullying really gets one off...
---
Honestly play what you want, but dont think that other people think and do the same. 
---
Maybe we shouldnt focus on hating the people that use those perks or addons, but focus on that Broken game design?
---
im sorry for judging you guys for using op perks
---
Is it wrong that ever time I see Susie I just wanna give her a big hug?
---
I got 3 stuns and the killer and they proceeded to break off me for the rest of the match. This happened 2 games in a row.
---
At this point no action shows they don't give a shit.
---
Hence why it needs a rework before Haddonfield or Mount Ormond. :)
---
Yeah survivors on the gook dont have a hitbox with hatchets
---
You just openned a gateway to the darkest depths of deviant art.
---
Also add oni and hillbilly to that.
---
Didn't miss the point, my point is it's not like some fucker who got teachables from 5 killers.
---
Actually been having fun with Legion lately, gotten a decent amount of 4k's and reached rank 12 using him.
---
The Crapper: 💩
---
On average, I’d say MOST survivors have 1 perk that’s worth getting, if any. Bill has both BT and Unbreakable so I recommend him first, as those are both great perks. I’d also consider Meg for Adrenaline, Laurie for DS, and Nea for BL, but it all depends on how you play as well as Rank. Unbreakable is typically more useful at higher ranks where more killers slug in my experience, but the increased recovery speed is big even on its own.
---
My go-to build is Bond, Unbreakable, Balanced Landing, and then either Adrenaline, Spine Chill, or a gen perk, depending on how I feel like playing.
---
Ranks being wildly different has nothing to do with SWF. Matchmaking is just that bad.
---
tbh I do agree that Lery's needs *a* rework, and I understand why it's getting a rework since Doc is getting one, similarly to when Badham was reworked with Freddy. The thing is that there are maps which need a rework far more than Lery's and it seems like they're only going to rework maps that came with Killers they're reworking. Unfortunately since Myers is probably one of the best designed Killers in this game and Legion is on perma-nerf mode this means that Ormond and Haddonfield will probably be reworked sometime in the year 3587.
---
Let him trap those gens and cause an effect similar to last year's gas.
---
Russian Roulette Spirit is a lot of fun!
---
https://deadbydaylight.com/en/news/2019-year-review
---
Yeah but the whole idea was that she was a loner because people perceived her as a freak for being into bugs and plants. Not some high class party girl
---
Pretty neat man.  I love that she made one for each of you.
---
Of course they do. I regularly use them to train cross maps shots when the game is done. You can hear the scream when you hit them.
---
I actually switch inner strength for we'll make it. that healing speed is insane for 90 seconds lol. 
---
"oh my teammate got hit in a chase?? lemme go heal really quick..*5 seconds later* get back out there bud!"
---
If we wanna go by talk horror movies then killer shouldn't be able to end chases so quickly, After all horror films have intense scenes like this.
---
Also isnt a person getting away from the killer by using a distraction or a weapon if only briefly in horror films as well? 
---
Dont try the whole "this is a horror game" with me. That aspect died when the devs nerfed stealth and healing forcing survivors to become more and more like looping gods while running BT and/or DS with some adrenaline.
---
Wait you get looped for the entire trap duration?
---
With Switch, you can play DBD on the bed. 
---
I rest my case.
---
Imagine if you had a mori lmao
---
it was up there for me. Not the hardest, but definitely most frustrating, for a challenge that could theoretically be finished in like 1-2 chases in 1 match, it took me like 6 matches to complete.
---
It was the most surprising challenge to me in seeing how many killers are still scared to even get stunned by a pallet and makes me sad at how bad some of them continue to be.
---
Thanks! We have 5 of us in total who play, and one is more of a killer main so he’s getting the red slash through all the white ones
---
Not sure when you played last, but Self Care takes 32 seconds now, I believe, which is double regular healing time. It gets a lot of criticism because many people end up running to a corner and healing instead of working on objective, helping others, etc. There are a good number of people who still regular run Self Care.
---
Technically, it takes less time away from objective if you self heal, as someone else could be working on a gen, but it all depends on how the survivor uses it.
---
When I play killer and I know someone has Self Care, I'll hit them and watch them run off somewhere, then go after someone else. If they're going to waste half a minute healing, then i've got plenty of time where I don't have to worry about them.
---
I got the challenge from Legion who kept running to me next to a pallet while in Frenzy...did it more than 4 times that match lol
---
At least hillbilly has something.  At normal speed, he's moving at 20 mph.  With addons, he runs at something like 28 mph which is the same as the world record sprinting speed set by Usain Bolt.  Except billy's doing it with a chainsaw.  Leatherface just kind of steps forward quickly a few times.
---
Oh look another Otz meme *yawn*
---
Legion is a fun killer to play, but for me i prefer to play with the pig, its more fun the way you can surprise the survivors with stealth
---
Its clear who the real winner is here.
---
alright this may be a dumb question but..
---
how do you get those different colored perks?
---
there was no blood warden, she just chose to fuck around too long
---
That’s because lag switching is a far less common issue than survivors BMing. There are plenty of posts on this subreddit complaining about toxic killers who tunnel or camp (and rightfully so). You can call out toxicity without taking sides.
---
"Babied killers"
---
Have you ever played killer before?
---
Ok but you know who's the real virgin: The Legion
---
I main Trapper, mind games into traps is satisfying as hell, also dabble with Mike and Demo but never play them for long
---
Spawned right next to bubba went for a pallet stun he lagged through the pallet and knocked me with chainsaw then proceeded to facecamp me and let everyone else go while I died off the start
---
Dude even the alternate gets one.  Love it.  Tell your girl she did awesome and to keep stuff like this coming.
---
Haha I took a break from dbd right after the second tome came out so I am massively behind in the rift with no home of catching. I’m just trying to do all the challenges I can for those sweet BPs lmao
---
When someone else is injured and you take a hit for them or when someone is being carried and you take a hit. The game can be weird with protection hits at times soooo sometimes you get a protection hit and you are like??? Okay I guess lol
---
I can do that in my room too. On a way bigger screen...
---
Yeah, when matchmaking works the way it should, I have decent games. But when I get paired with people above my rank, I struggle and have very little chance of getting a 4K lol
---
Sacrifice 2 survivors with NOED promotes camping and tunnelling, Sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement promotes camping, unhooking the survivor that unhooked you promoted farming by throwing the game for the rest...
---
I use them both if I’m farming Bp for ‘We’re Gonna Live Forever’ stacks.
---
I’ve been trying to get better with him recently but the ranking system is so fucked on PS4 that I get squashed every time and have to switch back to Ghostface to build my self esteem back up.
---
I'm scared because that probably means a Hawkins 2.0 with useless pallets. The hospital right now has only one safe pallet which is the studio one. It didn't need much change except for the studio double window and some other windows...
---
Konami may be hellish but Masahiro Ito still does Pyramid Head artwork that in his own words "Aren't James's" 
---
They could add *a* Pyramid Head without adding *the* Pyramid Head
---
Only problem is he would have to be like, Nurse speed with a OHKO bigger than Oni's.
---
Or when you are running looking behind and get stabbed in the face
---
If there is a phantasm trap right by a gen, is it possible to crouch over and repair or does the action of repairing trigger it?
---
ackkkshuaaallllyy in the first two movies he's credited as "the shape" so maybe it's a nod to them
---
Personally, I don't care about pipping, only blood points. And I got 31/32k + BBQ that game. That satisfying Claudette kill was just an extra bonus hehe
---
Newb here. What is a pip?
---
???? You were out D: you got saved and you were out, whyyyy? These moments are great
---
Resilience and sprint burst are also meta for survivors.
---
I've always considered the "secondary effect" to be to encourage safe altruism, since survivors are on a team and do best if they work together. Besides, two of David's perks work towards saving his teammates and himself from harm, it fits his theme.
---
I’m very bad with trapper
---
Ds now is annoying, but it used to be much worse
---
*BELCH*
---
And my best game was as hillbilly against a 3 man swf on Lery’s all using purple toolbox to make a long story short it was a frustrating game until the end I had only sacrificed one survivor and they had a gate open and then they started to taunt so I chainsawed the first one pulled the other out a locker and hooked them both and when ever the last one went for the save I chainsawed her down and she disconnected so satisfying to win like that when they’re trolling
---
Double snootin' for twice the boopin'!

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ehprpk/im_burned_out_with_the_bugs_in_this_game/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Never met a godline nurse. Only some really good ones. But that can be countered by breaking line of sight and making them not be able to pass something by going behind alot of things so it cancels out beacuse otherwise she would be stuck in the wall or any other object.
---
People tend to heavily underestimate just how deadly hitting things with a blunt object is with how flashy and showy blades are.
---
They didn't manage any kills but still won't get a derank, they aren't having fun at Rank 1 and want more balanced games that aren't broken, but they aren't even able tk derank due to the system
---
I feel ya, I'm on PS4 as well. 
---
I was on a break from dbd and I wanted to try the Oni. But learning a new killer on red ranks can be hell. 
---
However, it's been great! Just after a few days I can confidently say I'm good with the Oni on red ranks. I 4k most of my games with him :D
---
The sound of that bell instantly raises my blood pressure 😂🤣🤦🏻‍♀️
---
&gt;My boy was teabagging me every time he could then i caught his ass teabagged em back, he got unhooked and he bumped into me so i just slashed em again and he ragequit. Important to mention this was on Lerys and i was in night shroud so no i wasnt campin
---
&gt; The second meg I killed’s body disappeared
---
This is why, she dc'd before the sacrifice happens. You get points for a  sacrifice if someone dc's on a hook but you didn't sacrifice her.
---
ok, but why turn towards the open level to pick her up when there was definitely no one in the gate?
---
I know, I'm just saying that no players refer to him as such because his real name is so iconic and gives off such a strong mental image, whereas everyone mistakenly calls The Ghost Face^tm "Ghostface" because they know who he's SUPPOSED to be, but legally he isn't that.  But "no one cared who he was until he put on the mask!"
---
You’re not alone hahahaha
---
Every time I take wglf I bring breakout with me. Survivors always forget protection hits also grant stacks of wglf.
---
Nope. Just don't be surprised when she stabs you repeatedly when you do.
---
To be fair, unlike in horror movies, a chainsaw would easily get caught in clothes, and would break a bunch of teeth upon hitting bone.
---
Don't get me wrong, the person hit would probably bleed out and I wouldn't want to be on the end of that, but it's not as immediately fatal as one would think and it certainly would fail to work after the first time you tried.
---
Chainsaws are made for cutting through wood and cutting through anything else is a surefire way to break it and cause it to stall. Assuming it hasn't stalled already just for being *on.*
---
If I get looped I'll stand still and face a wall for a moment and see if they fuck up if that doesnt work I'll just let them go they cant stay in that area forever
---
Yes, as long as you hold the crouch button down all the way to it and until you start fixing it. Any movement without holding it will set if off
---
He's pretty easy to learn, just trap windows and pallets on the side that hides it most (usually there's dense grass patches on most maps) then learn where survivors frequent to get to gens or hooks and trap those, all you gotta do then is chase and down as usual but try to herd them towards a trapped pallet if possible. Also trapping the gates when gens are finished buys you time if you place it by the switch, they'll have to disarm and if they do then you get a notification and know where they are, makes escapes more difficult unless you're miles away.
---
I would be if I could afford it (I don’t buy auric cells very often but I’m a Jeff/Yui main
---
I feel like David would be one of if not the first to die because he’d try and fight the killer alone
---
It's possible to crouch over it and repair the gen without triggering it. You can even release the repair on the gen and stand up, as long as you don't move before crouching, you should be fine.
---
It takes literally nothing to bee a good person, i just wanna play the game
---
Poor, sweet summer child.
---
Do you know who’s the real virgin? Everyone on this subreddit
---
You get what you fu*king deserve
---
Cheers, hopefully this makes going against hag a bit easier for me
---
Found the Legion main.
---
They're probably just going to stuff it with broken af loops and cram pallets in every doorway then call it a rework.
---
Clown: shuts down loops somewhat easily
---
Freddy:*shuts down loops very easily in 2 different ways
---
*can teleport to generators
---
*has a built-in Oblivious effect on sleeping survivors
---
*is invisible to awake survivors
---
*offers natural game stall with his alarm clocks
---
*part of his power is completely passive and works automatically
---
and there are still people out there that think Clown has a purpose to exist when there is another killer than can do the ONLY thing Clown is good at, but better along with a laundry list of other things.
---
It's not bad of a map, just really unfun considering like half the killers can't use their power and a lot of the pallets are really bad
---
For me I've found the best thing to do before you get tilted is to play accordingly to how the survivors play. My goal is to three hook everybody without hooking somebody twice in a row. If I get a game like that and it's fun for me I'm perfectly happy with it. In these cases it doesn't bother me if 1 or 2 people escape. That's the fun. And as I play survivor arguably more than killer nowadays that's how I enjoy playing as survivor. I like it knowing that even if I died somebody in my team got out. Maybe I will get out on the next one.
---
This all changes depending on what happens during the game. Obviously there will always be people substantially better then me. They will loop me to hell and back. In this case give it the 20 second rule. If you don't get a hit or force a pallet drop from them within 20 seconds of entering chase leave them. Accept they are either better than you or in a good position. They do this twice then only pressure them off gens and leave them for last. Play normally. If said person decides to be cocky and toxic knowing he's better than you this is when my playstyle changes in one of two ways. First I'm going to try and get rid of his team in the early game. Not tunneling but definitely not passing up on free downs as I normally would. My goal is to make him 1 of 2 people. He dies the other gets hatch. If I see this isn't going to work in time I no longer care about the match as a whole. Congrats 3 other people because you are getting out and I'm OK with that. But this man is dying. Win win for everybody but the toxic guy. Even the best survivors can't loop forever. You are getting facecamped. If he gets unhooked he's going down again. In the EGC this is more complicated. Don't fall for a borrowed time hit. Don't eat a DS. Play it smart and usually they won't get out. Usually the toxic ones will stay in to get an unhook after EGC. Bait their attitudes if they get away. Don't chase them out. Down a teammate and proxy.
---
However most of all accept that they might get out. And it's going to make them more cocky and more toxic and ruin your day. In that case just go play a few meme games. Chest protector Bubba is always a fun one. In the end just letting them escape alone without ever engaging with them is usually enough to knock them down a peg and ruin their night. That's the best course of action.
---
No, killers tend to get more BP than survivors. I'm fine with this if you nerf killer BP.
---
Why not just play killers you're unfamiliar/not great with to derank
---
It depends of the matchmaking, sometimes it's rank 8 for some reasons
---
He has a cosmetic tho
---
It's on PC
---
Visit r/PerkByDaylight where it should be written how to change Perk-pack, and if not you can ask them
---
Thanks
---
You seem to forget that rank 16-20 killers are also bad and may need slowdown perks. I still stand by my opinion that its better to learn how to deal with maybe the most common killer perk early than be hit by it like a truck later against better killers. It would be even more of a struggle to get past rank 10 for new players than just experience and learn at rank 16-ish.
---
There's far worse maps than Lery's in the game and they still go for it? Hello? Haddonfield? Devs?
---
The downvoted are a symptom of the community being incredibly small and not liking other ideas about the game. They don’t see a difference between Rank 1 and Rank 20 players.
---
The opening cinematic has never played for me. I am playing on Steam.
---
This wouldn't bother me except none of the Archive cinematics will play for me either. I'm fairly sure this is somehow connected.
---
Does anyone know why this might be the case? And, if so, how to fix it?
---
Can that be a meme for the DBD Community, just Chad Myers?
---
/r/vore_irl definitely isn't a real thing, /u/thepuppet99.
---
The final girl would be Blendette, who will appear only during The Final Scene.
---
For real tho, I think Clauduette would be final girl, don't know why, just see her in the role of  final girl
---
I’ll give it a try
---
dramatic is basically hex huntress lullaby?
---
Sometimes I get depressed playing DbD, So I just take a break from it.
---
Playing killer can be very stressful, sometimes u do easy 4k's, sometimes u dominate them.
---
Anytime u feel bad, just take a break and play something else.
---
Very cool! Could use some skulls.
---
9/10
---
Do, to be fair it might not be to your style but I find it most fun when everything comes together as planned
---
Exactly. The equivalent of a Hag putting down traps on a hooked survivor, only to come back AS SOON AS the trap gets set off. Or in many cases, the hag comes back anyways even if it wasnt set off.
---
he's been without cosmetics for 6 months longer th
---
k.
---
That’s the proper way to secure a kill after the gates are powered. Getting a 1k is a lot better then nothing. Just play the game and don’t get toxic with someone who wants BP and to possibly pip.
---
I didn’t forget anything. I’ve played as a Rank 20 killer. Got a 3K the very first game I played. With one perk. I can get 2-3K kills at this Rank. Once you find a survivor they are hosed. Once there are only three gens left on the entire map they hosed.
---
Now throw in a single Perk that persuades most Rank 20 survivors to not even try and then double the time to complete the gens for the remaining. Now throw in BBQ n Chili, NOED, Gen lock downs, and making skill checks even harder by kicking the gen. All that at Rank 20.
---
The same problem exists for Rank 20 Survivors with all the Very Rare Perks. Imagine a new Rank 20 Killer against a group of survivors with all the best Very Rare Perks. 
---
Now imagine this over and over again because of the holidays.
---
It is broken.
---
killer can now break pallets!
---
Yes, my main is pig, its a different style of play
---
I blame children's television (/s), since they don't allow you to show blood.  It leads to characters getting punched in the gut so hard that they fly through the air and slam spine first into a tree or something but it only knocks the wind out of them, whereas any sort of blade is considered the most deadly thing ever, because it draws blood, and so it can never ever be allowed to ever touch anyone ever or it's instantly fatal.
---
Try to check files integrity. It's the default try to fix anything wrong with any steam game.

https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335
---
Some people say it's survivor sided, some say it's killer sided but I just hate it on both. You don't know what kind of tiles you're going to come up on, too many windows, a lot of unsafe pallets and it's huge. I would have loved for them to rework Ormond or Haddonfield first but I'll also welcome a change of lerys
---
Noed is for bad killers. Good killers don't let 5 gens get repaired.
---
Pigs gonna  win
---
Deranking is lame as shit. There's nothing "more balanced" about doing it if you consider your opponents.
---
And if he is good enough to safety at rank 1 requirements with 0 kills I'd say he is at the rank that's appropriate for him.  Rank 1 Pip requirements are steep which means he multi hooked every survivor and cleaned up with scoring events to manage a safety pip up there with no kills.
---
Yeah, I too hate it when they say Raid: Shadow Legends.
---
bc there hadn't been a single flashlight in the game up until then. So I didn't have a reason to be careful
---
We all know Nea would be the killer.
---
I agree.
---
Was recommended to throw a watermark on this to avoid art stealing. I usually don't like adding stuff that intrudes on the art, but I figured it's better to be safe than sorry. Apologies if it's a little too noticeable.
---
Yeah agreed. I always run into toxic survivors when I’m playing killer so now I just main survivor
---
Make sure you don't close hatch or let door open. EGC makes the sacrifices not count for some reason.
---
I wish Santa gave me some adderall too :(
---
I let a ghost face kill me for noed challenge :&gt;
---
\&gt; chance to force at least one survivor to look for a a totem.
---
\&gt; 2 minutes trying to find immersed survivors that wait out active time of a perk.
---
I don't know, man, goes either way.
---
Hide your red light to give survivors a good fright
---
I love playing killer, but the toxicity really can ruin it and take all the fun out of it. I keep playing and try to ignore it but it grates on me
---
Haddonfield isn't so bad now that balanced landing isn't as strong, and same with Ormond. A God loop or two need to be fixed on both, and the long fences on Haddonfield need to be straight up deleted, but other than that they're fine.
---
Treatment theater on the other hand, was a fundamentally flawed and dogshit map for both sides of the equation. Impossible to find gens, no good loop tiles, terrible opportunities for mindgames, and W ^I ^^N ^^^D ^^^^O ^^^^^W ^^^^^^S that have no purpose. No fun for either side, and I think them prioritizing this map first is a good idea.
---
Rank progress. You see the pips when you look at your rank. Each game you can gain up to 2 pips (or lose one) based on the emblems you get.
---
Any virus scans running ?
---
Ok what you said was I am a cunt for flashing the killer, I said I flashed him because he kept tunnling, you are the one that started the arguement for calling me a cunt so therefore theres no point in arguing with you because ur just being a hypocrite
---
Players earn pips through their actions (and inactions) to increase their player rank. After a match, you can see how you did on the game summary tab. If you did poorly, you don’t earn pips (and can actually lose them) and it eventually lowers your rank. If you did well, you earn pips that add up until your next rank.
---
I would have done the same, if people leave the match I feel so bad for the rest because it becomes loads harder to escape.
---
I'm on PS4 and it says No Cosmetics
---
You get light ringer for totems (5 total) and Gates (2 total), across those there’s enough for a gold and you’ll get an iri Unbroken and I think default bronze in Chaser because of starting points
---
wow that episode was really dark!
---
Why do we even HAVE that totem?!
---
It was an eye opener for sure.
---
Yeah I remember. It was awful
---
Now I wonder what they did with legion ._.
---
im with you on this, my second issue that they to lock the notes in those hard challenges, at least for me lore shouldnt be locked behind them
---
I know that feeling.
---
They also force you to sometimes do things you hate doing. Like I boycotted doing the noed challenge for a while because I hate running that perk. I also despised the sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement challenge because I had to camp the basement sometimes to ensure sacrifices. i don't mind if the challenges are hard but i don't like when they force me to play in a different playstyle
---
How much survivor do you play?
---
I don't understand. Pig traps don't count down while the survivor is in a chase, so how are your traps killing them?
---
"Hey should I play like this". Play however you want, you are never gonna get one answer, some killers let everyone leave, some leave 1 other leave none, it is is completely up to the player and the player only. I am a very competitive killer and so I never let anyone leave, why? Cause I am a "scumbag" who only cares about the win,  I don't play so everyone can have a good time, matter of fact if every survivor has a bad match and tells me to kill myself after the match I have won. 
---
So play thew way you want to play. Unless you're way of playing is asking others how you should play the game.
---
Happened to me, i was cleaning a totem and thinking: "here goes your devour hope!" And then got exposed because it was hauted ground... I started laughing: "aw crap... Diden't remember that one!" (I haven't saw HG for a long time, and truly forgot about it!)
---
I main Huntress, I guess I found that guy who makes assumptions about people on the internet. Oh wait! That's basically everyone! Way to stand out!

Windows Defender running but not scanning
---
That flair. I salute you good sir/madam.
---
Awesome thank you !
---
I was also thinking of Perks, I'm new to the game sorta, so I won't do good at making up perks. Since James's channel is known for Kill Counts, maybe he gets buffs every time a survivor is hooked or sacrificed. On his channel, he gives Two medals to two kills on each kill Count, Golden Chainsaw, and silver machete, seeing the two medals on the channel, I think it'd be funny to make those into perks.
---
I’m not so much complaining about it as I am pointing out that the game is tilting. Never said anything about killers following my rules either i play killer as well I just don’t like the fact that there are abilities in the game (on either side sorry for not clarifying that sooner) where you can ruin the game for your opponent or teammates
---
But It says "Select Challenge" under it like it's unselected. 
---
Idk my guy you got fucked over one way or another.
---
To be fair, he has a huge arsenal at his disposal for status effects with his addons: exhausted, mangled, additional hindered, wallhacks ... which are all good.
---
I find the clown to have the coolest addons in the sense that there are next to no completely useless ones.
---
What he lacks is tracking and map pressure/slow down. 
---
Since map pressure/slow down is something hard to just build into the kit without it being annoying/broken, I'd go with tracking
---
4 man hooksawing swf when I was a doctor, each down the hook I was taking someone to got fucking sabotaged. DC'd after the 4th hook getting dismantled in my face.
---
Your idea isn't all that bad but it'd still not solve much. Slapping on Oblivious on anyone working on a generator wouldn't be fun for anyone as they cannot hear the Clown approaching. He's already a solid chaser so giving him a basically guaranteed hit on anyone working on a generator that has bad LoS.. its just cheap. 
---
Here's some buff suggestions I liked plenty that I got from a "buff clown" thread I made on the official forum before I got permanently banned from there;

* Remove slowdown for throwing bottles. 
---
* Remove the vaulting noise the Clown makes. He's literally the only killer that does it and its hurting him a lot, as he cannot perform window mind-games as easy due to it.
---
* Hitting a survivor directly with a bottle douses them in the Afterpiece Tonic, making them leave a trail of gas for 2 seconds after leaving the cloud. Its basically a longer duration slow as a reward for hitting them directly.
---
* The Clown releases clouds of Afterpiece Tonic around himself whenever he's reloading his bottles. Quickly tapping the reload button releases a small cloud.
---
* Survivors who's intoxicated cannot see the red stain. 
---
* The longer a survivor remains in the gas cloud, the longer the duration of the slow will be.
---
* A minuscule exhaustion debuff should be part of the gas by default, like 5 seconds. It'd force survivors to stop running away if they want to use Exhaustion perks.
---
* The Afterpiece Tonic automatically start regression on Generators within its AoE that's not being worked on.
---
Yeah you've got a point there, But it looks like neither Bubba or Max give a shit and they just dash through survivors like the survivors are small pine tree's lmao, OP is wondering why Oni, a massive ogre wielding a katana (made for cutting down people and can be considered better then the longsword) does the same amount of damage that a little ghost girl with a weaker katana does, My theory is that the entity enjoys torturing the survivors by making them able to endure these hits but still have to suffer the pain of it
---
I’ve done this before and it feels so dirty, yet so right because they were stupid enough to not safely taunt me.
---
She doesn't even have wiggely tits like spirit 😢
---
That is certainly an exageration
---
*Cries in Hillbilly main*
---
It kinda is a hard concept because the game was not built that way, giving solos comms means you have to do a full rework on killers mechanics to fight the Survivors knowing your whereabouts 100% of the time. And knowledge is probably the Survivors biggest weapon. There are already talks between devs about improving solo play which I agree with, but swf were never meant to exist and they Implemented it without any kind of balance. If they rework killers to fight it fair enough but it seems like a big change to make considering (apparently) only a small percentage of players do full 4 man swf squads.
---
They're called dead zones for a reason. You need to play around them.
---
Base Hillbilly without add-ons is a joke.
---
Look like she got yeeted
---
Joined on hate train huh
---
I pretended to be a nice killer.  Helped with gens.  Let them do totems, gens, and get stuns.
---
Than I slugged them all opened the exit gates, slugged the adrenaline user again.  Hooked with blood warden, and cleaned house on both challenges on the first try each.
---
  I got a lot of salty massages on that one.  Lol.  Survivors are so entitled they get mad when the killer doesn't play exactly the way they dictate killers should play.
---
Can u msg me what he msgs u
---
DESTROY IT! CAST IT INTO THE FIRE!

---
just saying.. if there was a comp version of the game, there'd have to be perk bans otherwise there'd be no point of playing comp. that's considering they make comp like most games have it (it doesn't give as much progress as casual especially cuz it's filled with sweats)
---
you get no Evader emblem if the killer completely ignores you, you MAYBE will get bronze if you're in the TR for a bit, but that's it.
---
That is not enough for Gold for 3 people, and chances are a survivor will most likely be doing way more gens than necessary for an Iri emblem. this goes back to what I mentioned on how at best ONE person will get 1 pip and it's usually the one who goes overboard and hogs the objective to themselves.
---
Also against a camping killer there is no time to run around and break 5 totems, chances are they will already be on the 2nd survivor camping long before you finish all gens if that's the case, in which you are basically losing to a camping killer because you're off doing useless shit.
---
Optimally in the best case scenario you are getting 10 points, that's 2 Iridescent in Unbroken and Lightbringer and the base value of Benevolence of Silver with 0 Evader. Hell I'll even be generous to say you somehow got Bronze Evader. that's 11 points. You need 12 to pip once, and that's at best what 1 survivor is  getting against a facecamping killer that refuses to do anything else. 
---
In some scenarios someone can barely edge out those extra 1 or 2 points to pip, but it won't always be you, and you still run the risk of rewarding the camping killer with more kills when doing stuff like this, which will just destroy your Unbroken and/or benevolence emblems if you screw it up.
---
It is statistically impossible if you play "perfectly" against a camping killer to always guarantee constant pips.
---
Big problem with lery's is that you're running blind. Will there be a window in this next room? Which wall will it be on? How you perform on either side has much more to do with rng than other maps.
---
Just shut up, I'm over this. What makes you think it's a good idea to comment the next day adding to the fire? It's ridiculous. You do need to grow up.
---
I can tell you're brand new to Reddit because you're making an ass out of yourself.
---
Wouldn't be so different from Ash Williams, Nancy Wheeler, and Steve Harrington, all based on fictional characters, but it looks like the actors exactly. Plus Ash Williams is voiced by Bruce Cambell, the actual Actor who played Ash Williams in Evil Dead. James wouldn't be so different.
---
Depends, if the killer isn't close than just leave, I know I would rather just get on to the next game. If somebody is hooked but you don't want to go get the guy (cause NOED, or being on death hook) you can wait at the exit till the killer forces you out or wait to body block.
---
She had it coming.
---
I think the purpose of them should be to force us into alternative playstyles, otherwise they're just what, passive challenges that don't matter? But those playstyles shouldn't promote camping, tunnelling, or other shitty forms of gameplay.
---
Honestly, the rift rewards are mostly reskins of each other (charms with different colors) and reskins of some uninteresting cosmetics. If it were only the good cosmetics, I guarantee it'd be less than 20 levels. Plus they are going to be sold at some point sep so if you miss out, theres no real incentive to buy your tiers. I do like the vial charm at tier 70 tho. Maybe the next rift pass will be better. The boost in bp from the tome is a nice welcome bonus though. I DO think that you should be able to make progress in every challenge as you play naturally instead of only one challenge counting per session, since most games that use battlepasses tend to let you progress what you can when you play.
---
How much fps are we talking about?
---
The culture of selfacaring one guy loop the killer for three minutes and the others are using self care in the corner of the map that perk need to be removed of the game
---
I feel like pig would be on Myers' side
---
Or just use calm spirit.  You know, the perk that makes you not scream?
---
They really should just be like achievements where you can complete any of them by doing them at any time, but also have it so you have to redeem through the web in order to get the rewards.
---
I think Myers is my fave killer for toxic survivors. Suddenly grabbing that asshole who has evaded you for the whole game for a kill is incredibly satisfying.
---
Noed is al ready a week perk and you want to nerf it
---
No problem.
---
You're obviously not over it if you're still telling people to grow up.  You're the immature one. Bullying someone just for calling something gay.  That's what an immature person does.
---
I deleted this post how are people still commenting on this
---
Just got the game and have been having fun so far.
---
Saw there are a lot of DLC's. I plan on mainly just playing survivor, so are any of the paid DLC's worth my time? If so, which ones?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
A safety pip and easy blood points vs a purposefully de-popping killer isn’t that bad.
---
Doing gens is toxic like hooking survivors
---
There's not much you can do to stop genrushing other than patrolling and running gen stopping and regressing perks. When it comes to being looped, if it's a strong loop and I strong survivor, find somebody else, don't waste your time. You'll learn this stuff as you play more. Practice makes perfect.
---
It's all you can do. I was against a sweaty 4man red rank swf, at rank 8 - they finished the gens in 7-8 min minutes I got maybe 4-5 hooks. Won every mind game, even tricked them a few times to run into gens I teleported to. I made a lot of gen pressure, and didn't tunnel or camp. They all got away, told me to get cancer, and I de pip'd. The only thing they said that made was when I said "I expect when I do well to get rewarded" and the dwight goes "I know your lying, you at least black pip'd stop being salty you didn't get the 4k".
---
Though if I did camp/tunnel/slug, threw away gens, or took NOED. I wonder how much different that score would have been if I had got even 1 sacrifice when I played well.
---
Yes it was a swf, I saw them all playing together in the toxic twitch streamers stream laughing about how bad they did, but won anyways. One even called out "If I didn't have adrenaline he would of had me at the gate". Yes thats true, if you didn't have adrenaline you would of been punished for not playing safer near gate. While I have to take 2-3 perks just to balance the game like PGTW and Ruin.
---
Anyways tl:dr It might actually be more benefical for killer to camp/tunnel.
---
The reason tea bagging is frowned upon in this game as apposed to others is because in other games you are usually on equal footing in terms of gameplay. It's two very different styles of gameplay ALSO it's a 4v, as a survivor you have a team, a killer is alone, so to bm when you have a team on your side, feels like bullying. And finally, 90% of killers cannot teabag, and if they take the time to bm you in some other form IE, camping, they will lose the game. It's not just an animation it's what it stands for, it's like saying. "HA I BEAT YOU" at a position you couldn't win. Which is why it furiates people more when you bm at a pallet or loop which is unbeatable outside of running it with your eyes closed.
---
Yes, it’s so frustrating when I complete a challenge but don’t have it selected. Wish it just worked regardless of what was chosen but I suppose then you’d get through the challenges too quickly
---
Or the mob mentality scares them
---
Rocket League has servers and this feature exists so there is probably a way to bring this back.
---
Yup because they totally weren't being an ass to me too. Also, it's not my fault I wake up to some dumb ass commenting in my notifications. Just fuck off.
---
Trueta1ent: *bans DS*
---
every survivor against Otz: *bans I am all ears and STBFL*
---
Tydetyme didn’t even list them in top 5 perks, so they’re suboptimal.
---
Smegma
---
This is why we cant have nice things
---
I'm the one ruining the game when they DC? Because I don't give you your win? How entitled you are is funny. I don't want an easy game but I don't want to lose a pip because morons dcd. Especially as its waaay harder for killers to pip than survivors. I'm just ending the game without getting fucked by this fucking ranking system. Also, 3 mins on the ground? If I can't find/down you in 3 mins and in that time you don't pick up the other guy there is a big problem.
---
Gotta get that Whispers with Corrupt.
---
LMAO well I suppose that's one way to do it
---
Survivors act like the killer can do anything other than camp at the endgame. Like what are they supposed to do? Chase you to the gates and let their hook go for free? Just because it hurts your feelings to be killed in a killing game? Camping is the best thing you can do in the endgame with gates open or 99’d.
---
It's been 15 weeks if not longer. I applaud this man for the cause he stands up for. When a company has barely acknowledged the issue that says more what they think of the community than anything. Oh you want color blind mode? Here have some more 10 dollar cosmetics.
---
If there are disconnects. And the remaining ones are still learning, I’ll chase and hook but in a slow way that gives them a chance to still make it out. I don’t help farm with them but I make it blatantly obvious that unless you’re just hanging around me and teabagging, you’ll get some points and make it out. 
---
If just one dc’s and they’re are still getting things done quick, I’ll play as normal until I see they are sort of potato-ey. (Easy to hit, making bad escape choices). Then I’ll back off a bit.
---
Tip: playing with headphones makes it a lot easier to find the distinctive noise the hatch makes when it opens. And figure out which side it's coming from
---
Better question, who's the new survivor?
---
He does fit the ghostface motive to a T though. Ghostface was never just 1 guy, his whole persona was always multiple people trying to be him for various reasons. One of those reasons being fame, look at Scream 4.
---
The Ghostface we got here uses a similar motive to gain fame for himself. Since he's a self-centered asshole and loves the spotlight.
---
Also referring to the meme itself, he isn't a teenager, unless a teenager can somehow move from town to town and net reporter jobs easily.
---
They make generators now in addition to fixing them? Time to DC
---
Ahem. You're forgetting the OG Laurie. But blendette would be like the aliens in Signs... they were there the whole time.
---
Yes.  Logic, reasoning, and calling out keyboard soy boy bully losers like you would be making an ass out of myself in the eyes most people on the internet I'm sure.  You deserve to get camped, tunneled, and get trolled by toxic swf groups for the rest of the month.
---
Play as hag to get ruin, it will slow down the game a little.
---
Focus on map pressure and when the game starts go to the furthest away gen
---
I literally said in my caption that "you gotta love match making" implying that the match making is broken for giving me a shit killer, dont be mad because youre a shit killer 🤣🤣🤣
---
Go check the gates bro! Promise we won’t unhook with BT. PROMISE!
---
I'm confused about the point you're trying to make. Both Myers and Ghostface have a "the" name that isn't their real name, and both are called by their actual names. Just like nobody refers to Freddy as "the Nightmare." What do you think Ghostface's name should be, keeping in mind that every killer is "the" something?
---
I’ve had plenty of frustrating SWF games but my most recent was versus a SWF that all brought flashlights and I couldn’t pick up a single survivor because I would just get blinded immediately. I probably should have just slugged them all but it was already the end of the game and I just wanted them to leave. My most satisfying was against a SWF that thought they could bodyblock the hook then they all were downed within a matter of 2 minutes and one by one they DC’d. It’s funny how killers rarely DC even when the odds are against them but survivors will DC at the slightest inconvenience lol
---
I started running Windows of Opportunity specifically because of it
---
Buying the DLCs and leveling the included survivor will give you access to the perks of that survivor across all of the others. I would take a look at the in-game store to preview each's perks, to see what appeals to you, but the DLC survivors with the best overall perks are probably Tapp (Saw chapter) and Feng (Spark of Madness chapter).
---
damn you funny!
---
That is what you should do. Stand far enough away to keep pressure on the hook while not getting the hook penalty and letting them have hope of getting them off the hook. You can get two to three hooks before they give up and let you have the kill probably. (Only in endgame do this)
---
the topic was pipping against the camping killer, my point was that you can't always pip against a camping killer.
---
Also it isn't a lot of bloodpoints either, you're getting roughly 12-14k tops in matches like this(even less if you're the one camped). Which is shit compared to what you can potentially get in an actual active match
---
I know Umbra sometimes trades Ruin for Corrupt on her Huntress build and does pretty well. I think Ruin is still better on Huntress, or any other slow moving killer because bad players will run out of hiding to find it. Corrupt is just consistent and ruin is usually gone before a gen is done.
---
I tried not to involve licensed survivor. If I would count them, then definitely Laurie would be final girl
---
Wait fr? The devs confirmed this?
---
If you’re playing survivor Halloween DLC for Decisive Strike. Maybe the Stranger Things DLC for Inner Strength and Fixated. Other than that just collect the other survivors at your own pace.
---
If you're just focused on playing survivor, you'll mostly be concerned with the perks that the DLC survivors have, unless you prefer the looks of a certain character.
---
Many of the best survivor perks belong to survivors in the base game, but if your playstyle could benefit from one of the other perks you might want to buy the character and get their teachable perk. Alternatively, you can wait for the perk to show up on the Shrine of Secrets (in the store) and buy that perk with Iridescent Shards. You might be waiting a while though, as there are a lot of perks in the game now.
---
Some of the popular DLC survivor perks are: Decisive Strike (Laurie), Inner Strength (Nancy), Deliverance (Adam). Some newer players might benefit from Technician (Feng), or Windows of Opportunity (Kate).
---
By no means is any of this definitively the best stuff to run. For everyone it's going to be different. If you have a specific play style, I can try to recommend perks you might be interested in.
---
Source? I'm not saying you're wrong, I just didn't see that in the blog post.
---
Go Demarcus Go Demarcus
---
Do you want to be different!?
---
Do you want only 3 useful perks instrad of 4?!
---
Well I have a deal for you!
---
You can take Corrupt Intervention!
---
Not only will it increase the chances of higher rank survivors being pushed to the same gen at the start of the match, but also will tell them where you spawned and the direction you will most likely come from! All for the fair price of 6000bp on the bloodweb!
---
Maybe we'll get a morgue variant!
---
They mentioned it in the last dev stream before the holidays.
---
Ah sorry for such a late reply. If I buy the curtain call I have more money for one / 2 more killers at that price, any suggestion? Not sure I'll get the clown, but will look into him.
---
Leave
---
Leave the group chat
---
It’s totally up to you. If you feel good about how you played the game, and it’s a fair match, then cool. You do you.
---
Tydetyme is not the definitive opinion on Dead by Daylight, no one is, but most people would generally agree DStrike and Adrenaline are very good perks.
---
Dstrike essentially grants a Survivor 60s of invincibility, which often lasts long enough to still be up, even if the Killer chases someone else off the hook. 
---
Adrenaline is more inconsistent, but can basically guarantee an escape in the late game, or even save the team if the killer is slugging to try and snowball a late-game win.
---
Also, not actually giving a reason for your opinion and just going "Waaa, someone popular said it" is pretty weak.
---
yep had to change it for the dickhead lol
---
Am I the only one who likes Lery's and Hawkins lab? Honestly they should rework the Meat Plant - f that place.
---
Thanks for the tip. I already do play with headphones and knew to look for the sound.
---
What platform?
---
Can also confirm, most matches are under a minute of wait time, rank 9 killer and somehow coping with red ranks
---
Like I'd be the only one if the post stayed up.
---
I actually like that map as survivor, old balanced landing was so fun on it as well. Now Lery's is one I would want to avoid.
---
I'd fucking hook em the basement
---
I can’t wait for more Lery’s action. I hope there’s a variant that’s more outside mixed with inside. Like 2/3 is front area, parking lot and open grassy field and the inside is the office mixed with a few other tiles.
---
Or they call him Ghostface instead of The Ghostface because his name is ghostface? Just like how people say it’s legion not The Legion.
---
No wonder the dipshit is named "Clod"
---
I really love diversion, it works really well if you just know where to aim (lockers, vaults, gens). Saved me so many times combined with iron will.
---
Yes but legion is filled with edge Lord,bille elish music
---
That's not the point though is it. If your playing at rank 1 and not getting kills you arent having fun. It doesn't matter if you safety pip if the game you played was stressful as fuck and you didn't even have fun getting said points.
---
The community is pretty horrible.  If only people could be honest with themselves.
---
first video doesnt include some new killers. What about the new ones?
---
My friend knows how to do it! Sucked for those of us who didn’t get to play killer lol
---
Well then im sorry bud but you mustve not been that good with her to begin with
---
At least it's better than Quinton, and her makeup is always on point.
---
"What's your super power?"  
---
"I can run a bit faster than others for a short amount of time!"
---
I think The Game needs more survivor interaction. lerys is bad for both killer and survivor. I tend to stay away from lerys because I don't understand it. too confusing of a map.
---
Happens to me too. I’ll have a team of potatoes then I go to play killer and it feels like I’ve been put against a 4 man swf in red ranks
---
Me: bans SWF
---
Dwight?
---
Yup, but post game it gives you BP. It has a great purpose.
---
Thank you!
---
This. I enjoyed the "Dark Sense" challenge, if not for it wanting me to be there for 4 whole gen pops. That's more challenging than it needs to be for the wrong reasons. It's not that the challenge is hard to do, it's just that it requires either RNG, or a team with heavy coordination.
---
The range is 7-19 fps
---
Because it doesn’t really work that way if people have commented on it. It won’t show up in your history nor can people find it in a list. But those who have commented on it and still do so.
---
If they make multiple Lerys maps like they did for Springwood, i really hope they keep the original version untouched. I need me some future scares with Scratched Mirror Myers
---
Awesome, killer specific chase music could bring some fresh life to various matches.
---
Oh ok
---
I call him the bing bong boi
---
Too often someone uses diversion but it makes a notification outside the map, then it’s obvious what’s going on.
---
I'd say undergroud lab is far worse.
---
At least lery has one room with a longwall, the god pallet at the office, and multiple safe pallets in smaller rooms.
---
It can actually not work if your too close to a wall. If the killer suspects you have DS, they can pick you up near it so it won’t actually work.
---
Does this only happen with DBD?
---
Panic sets in for survivors with early disconnects... lots and lots of panic cause it seems like all is lost.
---
I know I've had people just end the game quickly and other killers just start snacking gens to indicate they'll farm. 👍
---
Jokes on them because I'll body block them, and make damn sure they don't escape for being a filthy rat.
---
you don’t ‘have’ to disconnect, just because you had a little challenge
---
I think pig is very fun but unfortunately her pressure is incredibly rng based. At the end of the day she is just an  m1 killer, and against survivors with more than 3 braincells the dash attack at pallets trick doesn't work. And since theres a chance to get her trap off first try, how well she does is very rng reliant. The only real advice I can give is to use 2 traps at once then stop. That works for me most of the time. 2 survivors being unable to do anything for a bit is great for getting more momentum. You also need to learn basic minigames at pallet loops if you havent already. Good hunting miss piggy :)
---
I suspect I understand the community better because of this post. It’s full of Red Rank players that have no concept of what it’s like to be a brand new player anymore. So when you suggest it’s still broken at Rank 20 people downvote and lose their minds. But if you suggest it’s broken at Rank 1 it’s upvote supreme.
---
It’s just broken. And wanting to derank to have more fun and to secure kills says this all the way.
---
OH SHIT.
---
If we can all get behind fixing haddonfield can we please get behind fixing the game, Hawkins, Blood Lodge, and Thompson house? All are incredibly unbalanced
---
It's because this Rift is based around Claudette and The Trapper. That's why most of the challenges have been "Heal" and "Trap/Basement" Themed.
---
Other rifts will be themed around the killer/survivor combo of that Selection.
---
Xbox
---
Problem with both is that CI would heavily encourage survivors to go find your totem since they can't do gens. Without CI survivors might try to work through the ruin instead of finding your totem.
---
"Hoping the killer will fall for it a fourth time"

Meanwhile killer

"Fuck, Macmillan Estate again. This is gonna be great"

"Gotta force him to drop that pallet, and that pallet, and that pallet, maybe this time he will goto that unsafe pallet - nope. Gotta make him drop this pallet. Alright screw it, i'm chasing someone else. Finally found someone - did that dude I was just chasing just finish that gen he ended the chase next to? Wooooow."
---
I got to R1 using no addons with her. 
---
And I’ll do without the condescension thank you very much.
---
I did the ol classic DS locker juke
---
I see your points, but I dont entirely agree with some of it.
---
For one, nobody hearing the killer approaching and getting a cheap hit is Myers, Ghostface, Pig, and Wraith (with his silent bell add-on) in a nutshell. There is even the perk Tinkerer which rewards that kind of thing (Even Demogorgon has an add-on that increases the time he remains undetected while coming out of a portal to do exactly that). Not many Survivor's complain about them and for the most part most love those killers for that exact reason (and rank 1s sometimes prefer that over the usual nurse/spirit/billy), so I think that argument doesn't work well in the face of everything else that's in the game.
---
Hitting a survivor with the bottle and making the gas last longer is a good middle ground as opposed to what I suggested with the extra slow down. I still prefer my idea since longer duration of slow can still mean a survivor reaching a pallet and getting away where extra slowdown almost guarantees a hit in many more situations (which is why Flask of Bleach is so strong).
---
While the thought and the look of Clown releasing the gas around himself would look cool, he still is slowed down a lot from reloading and most survivors take that opportunity to create distance from the Clown, making it not as effective as one would think.
---
Not seeing the red stain is cool, but fairly minuscule considering you can't see very much anyways when you are under the gas effect, it would be a nice quality of life but wouldn't change very much probably.
---
Now minuscule exhaustion would be nice on a lot of killer powers by default, however Behavior kinda shows preference of keeping exhaustion based stuff to add-ons and perks rather than default powers so I am not too sure it would get in but I do agree with it. Same boat for the regression on gens for the gas, seems pretty unlikely even for theory ideas just because Behavior wants killers to be kicking gens but I still agree with it personally.
---
The remove slowdown and remove vault noise is something I'm 100% on board with and can see behavior not having an issue with either.
---
Overall good suggestions, I still personally favor my own idea but your buffs are very good quality of life things for Clown. I approve. Thanks for the Feedback!
---
He doesn't deserve them
---
I have been noticing drop mechanics seem to be jonky. I was playing a game trying to get the flashlight save and I got the killer blind notification/points but the killer didn't drop the survivor and in the end game I noticed the person I was saving had DS. I wonder if both counter each other out.
---
Isn't the DBD Ghost Face in his 20s or 30s? I thought he used to be a journalist who reported on his own killings.
---
Sweaty killer is the "genrushing" for Survivors.
---
Are you a Killer who can't pressure well and thus loses a ton of Gens? Genrushing amirite?
---
Are you a Survivor who gets hard bodied by a Killer who out mindgames you in the chase, makes the right map moves, and has the sheer audacity to run a common perk setup? Fucking Sweaty Killers ruining the game as usual.
---
I have a feeling r/Oinkers_ would be proud
---
I have the same issue. Turned messaging off after getting a couple bad ones but ended up turning it back on because someone sent me a friend request with a note attached saying some positive things. I like getting positive messages but I don’t want to deal with the negative ones. Luckily I haven’t had any negative since then but I know I was gonna get one while my messages were turned off because some guy with a bunch of followers teabagged me a bunch and I camped him for it (I know, not ok but I don’t like bad manners) so he immediately sent a request and ‘followed me’. I’d say the positive messages are worth it but at the same time if you don’t want negative, defo turn messages to friends only. Sorry for long message, I just like putting my two cents in
---
&gt; Technician (Feng)
---
For me, Feng was a really good starter survivor (still is). Failing skill checks and having a good shot of not being punished by it is great. Also, Alert is a good starter perk, you can see the killer from time to time (does not work with invisible ones, sadly).
---
I get it, every disconnect no matter the reason is bad. 
---
At the very least on my challenging matches they’re at my rank. Wtf am I supposed to do running against a well optimized SWF red ranks? They’re literally severely above my skill level.
---
That reminds me, when I was going for flashlight saves for the archives, I blinded a Billy but they didn't drop the survivor. In the post-game, it said that I had completed my flashlight save challenge.
---
Not always, but some of them are whiner babies.
---
I was green ranks taking on red ranks before.
---
It's an excuse to get better, not to DC. You do not have to DC in this instance.
---
This please, the Entity's who shindig seems to be grabbing Killers who commit unspeakable evil /mass murder, but Wraith is only down as killing one mobster in a fit of fairly justified rage.
---
Don't forget Yamaoka, MacMillan, Autohaven and Haddonfield
---
I noticed, its just stupid how every killer who isnt "good" at the game assumes they lose cause of swf instead of trying to get better themselves
---
Yikes, sweaty, let's unpack this
---
in b4 deleted for oversaturated content

Survivor games can get frustrating at times for me but since I only ever play SWF with other people I don’t really get as mad because I have people to talk to which makes it way less irritating even if the killer is a toxic fuckwad. I think one of my worst games to date was when I was playing killer and a group of survivors ran a sabo build but waited until the end of the game to use it. I had gotten a couple hooks but no kills, which is always a bit disappointing but I figured it would turn out alright at least. Ohhh boy was I wrong. With one gen left I picked up a survivor and suddenly hooks are dropping left and right. One of them even went to the other side of the map just to duck with me since I can see the aura of the hooks disappear. The basement was too far so all I’m left with is the sound of the last gen popping and some point emotes at the gate. Not gonna lie, I was on the verge of tears because I’m a little weenie but I think what felt the worst was them being like “haha that was pretty mean we’re sorry” in the end game chat because you know they really aren’t.
---
Shes a keeper! Haha
---
Thats the weirdest complain considering he’s running really fast in a straight line with a one hit M1 down ability. Being able to turn that agile seems stupid to begin with.
---
Can't wait for Ace's
---
"Unhook yourself twice.
---
must be done in a single trial"
---
Hillbilly "Successfully 180 with the chainsaw
---
must be done on console"
---
I felt this
---
I just want it to not have a button to push because it’s ruining my controller (ps4) the X button is so weird now it’s almost impossible to struggle anyway
---
Agreed!
---
There are people on this subreddit who complain that. SB should still work with legions ability. Some hope it would cause problems
---
Solo queue is the weakest role in the game and killers still complain and accuse survivors of being a SWF. It’s not bad to play with others just because you want competent teammates for once. Some killers just have to make excuses for their loss, just like some survivors.
---
Right? Can't be talking about your experiences in and out of the match around these parts.
---
I just became a killer main after 200 survivor hours and I've only been playing Ms. Piggy with a staggering 7 out of 8 average games getting 4K .  
---
I hope I'm not the reason this has happened.
---
Because to most Survivor eyes, the game is won once all gens are done, so they see NOED as essentially getting rewarded for losing, which is not even wholly wrong. 
---
Of course, the game is still to play for until the gates are open and everyone escapes, but the feeling that you got punished for winning is hard to ignore when it comes to NOED and it feels really shit, ironically similar to second-chance perks like DStrike.
---
Yes only with DBD, other games run fine without problems
---
No idea why you’re downvoted. This community is really bizzare with its voting sometimes. I just imagine teenagers in their mothers basement clicking that downvote button and immediately masturbating to it afterwards. I need a new imagination apparently.
---
Im glad for you!
---
Sales baby here, I love playing as killer but I feel like the perks all seem to be equally situational. Im having a hard time figuring out whats good and whats trash. Huntress is my most played so far and I think the lullaby one is pretty good since it really messes with the survivor but other than that I dont feel like anything is particularly good?
---
True, if i lose i dont really care myself honestly and try to improve myself but people complaining about losing cause swf while the whole team is random is just stupid now
---
Nea is the killer jokes are still funny in 2019.
---
Tbh I had an easy time with the 4 man challenges. Like the 4 man basement challenge I went Freddy with Iron Grasp, Agitation, Mad Grit, and Insidious. Took Pill Bottle and Nancy's Masterpiece as add ons.
---
It didn't enjoy it, it wasn't a fun game, caused quite a lot of disconnects, but I got it done and out of the way easily.
---
My Gf and I played ten games yesterday. All but one had someone DC after they were downed the first time.
---
Because you just have to blind when the killer has someone in their arms. If you don't get the flashlight save you timed it wrong, that doesn't mean you won't get the challenge.
---
Infinite Iridescent Hatchets here I come!
---
And a better tutrial
---
knowing the killer's location has a different strategic use than knowing when he's looking at you, and is better at achieving other goals that don't involve avoiding the killer
---
Hexy is worse then ninja. straight up.
---
Ninja doesnt false report anyone (in dbd ehehe) from what i know, ninja has the excuse that he is new and thats why he complains, and ninja just flat out insnt as big of a cunt people like to say he is.
---
Also no, dont use Self care
---
I just had this on PS4 😁 5 survivors and no killers, match cancelled straight away
---
Roar
---
Was it a Nurse?
---
i remember, for the last week until shattered bloodlines came out, the fog travelers set went on for shards. pretty cool, sad they never did it again.
---
Also Nurse's Calling, Thrilling Tremors - Sprint Burst, Prove Thyself
---
You haven’t gotten all the perks to see what’s good and what’s not. 
---
Killers have some pretty good perks and lullaby is not one of them.
---
I am totem boi
---
Or you could run ruin, still have 3 perks, because it's already cleansed before you load in
---
Oh I didn't say she wasn't terrifying. Just basic.
---
i mean yea.
---
All of these post are just rank 15 survivors who just bought the game or 12 year old rank 1s saying some dumb shit.
---
i can sum up all of them.
---
"Hey *insert semi controversial killer* stop camping/tunneling/existing"
---
"you tbagged"
---
"shut up you *slur*"
---
*reddit time*
---
Idk Billy skin is pretty good, except for the weapon. Yeah it's "ugly" but that's like Billy's while thing. If I played Billy I'd want it.
---
That's sound very enjoyable
---
2 of us alive, last gen, I was looping the killer at a place with no gens. After a minute and a half I got downed. Teammate was hatch camping.
---
Man, I had actually forgotten for a little bit that such an epic piece of music was used on such a shit story.  Now I'm sad.
---
TL;DR: "I think we did a pretty good job so far."
---
They also forgot to mention how they nerfed 5 killers in a row. Wait a minute...
---
"Making the game more accessible to a wider audience has been goal for us"
---
...oh never mind. There it is.
---
They are fictional characters though. I'm playing as Steve Harrington, not Joe Keery.
---
.............YOU SAW NOTHING!
---
Dude these guys get so defensive when I call BHVR EA lite. Its 10 bucks a cosmetic unless you hard grind the game and never buy from the shrine
---
And this isnt even a f2p game
---
its bc they latch onto anything they think is op. 
---
"I didnt lose due to skill! it was... that super OP swf gamemode" 
---
If you can only play against solo players, players with a huge handicap, you are not as good as you think you are.
---
That is exactly what happened for me as well. I was just watching a streamer get blind and he didn't drop the survivor he was carrying either
---
The best 'general' perks will be the ones that  
---
1. Help you find people  
---
2. Keep people from doing generators. 
---
There is a meta for killers, in the sense that some perks are used far more often than others, and are generally good in most situations. For example, you will see plenty of people running Hex: Ruin and Pop Goes the Weasel, since they're effective at stopping survivor progress and do not require any special scenario or play to utilize. Likewise, you'll see plenty of people running Whispers, A Nurse's Calling and BBQ and Chili, since they help find people while doing the things you should be doing.  
---
However, it depends on the killer, and perks that are shit on others are mandatory on some. You won't see many people running Iron Maiden (increases the speed at which you open and close lockers, also fucks over people in lockers), unless they're Huntress, since it decreases her reload time, for example.   
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7\_yixIT0p58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_yixIT0p58)   
---
Otz did a video on good 'base' perk builds that don't require much leveling, maybe you'll find it helpful.
---
Lullaby can be a decent perk at newer ranks if your totem lasts for a while. As you encounter more experienced survivors, it won't be nearly as effective though.
---
You might be interested in Shadowborn (Wraith teachable). It increases your field of view, which can really help with Huntress because she's a bit slower than other killers.
---
Tracking perks will probably be your friend too. BBQ (Leatherface teachable) is arguably the best, but if you don't want to spend money on him and then level him up, you may have to wait for the perk to show up in the Shrine (where you can buy perks with Iridescent Shards). Alternatively, Whispers is a free perk that helps track survivors. Just don't spend too much time chasing someone down if you don't find them quickly.
---
I gave up when they wanted me to urban evade around the map with spine chill last tome
---
It makes sense as doctor is being reworked, they did it with Freddy and preschool
---
BHVR: Sorry! Sorry! *nerfs pathetic killer*
---
I mean, if the Killer gets completely Gen Rushed and they do only get one down, what are they supposed to do? Just let all the survivors escape and not at least try to get a safety pip?
---
That sounds like something a camper/tunneler would say.
---
So he got unhooked, you just happen to be hanging around with night shroud active and he gets downed again.
---
Yeah I’m sure he just accidentally bumped into you.
---
I know man, but the combination of CI, Ruin, Haunted Grounds and Discordance on my Wraith just works so well lol. Like yeah they will look for ruin...but once they hit HG its bing bing time!
---
I suspect they DC because the killer is Rank 17 with all Tier 3 Very Rare perks and can find and down someone in the first 20 seconds because all the survivors are new.
---
well shit, guess I only saw it from my perspective. I main huntress when I'm not playing survivor, so I appreciate it when survivors wait at the gate so I can snipe em before they leave for the long shot bonus bp. I'll be more considerate in the future, thank you for the insight
---
I helped this one dude with his 4 gen challenge, i was bubba and fucking around, in turn he helped me get the 4 sacrfices in basement
---
big disagree.
---
survivors can easily bring toolboxes or use prove thyself, quickly negating any and all other perks brought by the killer by genrushing and dipping out of the game before any of them become deadly or viable during the match.
---
This is a post that may invite skub and fighting, so, sorry in advance, but...  
---
I see some killers recommending builds on Ghostface and Wraith that promote a hit-and-run playstyle and punishing healing, so that everyone is basically stuck as a one hit KO. 
---
Which kinda makes me wonder, because... Wasn't that the whole point of Legion? A killer that's really good at injuring but then has to sort of go back around to down the people they injured? What do these killers have that makes them better equipped to handle this playstyle that Legion in particular doesn't? Is it just their capacity for stealth which lets them avoid loops?
---
No clue. I have had times where I Deliverance off a hook and got picked up broken and DS failed. Maybe that’s what happened?
---
Nobody asked for a “win”, I just said there’s no reason to slug for the 4k.
---
Player spawns in...2 of his teammates wuit in the first minute. Said player is then expected to sit and wait an extra few minutes before being able to start a new one just because sweatbag wants his points.
---
The dumbest thing they added back to the game.
---
No, not at all. Actually play oni before arguing about it. You have FULL turning at FULL speed.
---
&gt;  their power is just unbalanceable to begin with
---
Be honest, on Lerys, no red stain or terror radius it happens more often then you think.
---
I agree with you, but you’re being really mean about and I don’t like that you’re being mean.
---
It says select challenge if you have one selected too. If he didn’t have it selected it wouldn’t show up the way it did, it would literally just be the “select challenge” button.
---
Dbd's Ghost Face is probably the scariest Ghost Face killer compared to the Craven killers.
---
For what it's worth this was at Rank 5 and it was a Rank 3 saying it. I can send the full screenshot if you're interested, it was just rather irrelevant for the post as a whole.
---
How do you sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement if they decide to keep DC'ing on you when you get 3 of them?
---
He only has cosmetics for PC, if I'm not mistaken. I believe it's due to him being a Steam property. Like, they were already reluctant to put him on console in the first place 
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
I like how I've completed all challenges for the each tome and I'm left with 5 tiers over, like come on we should at least get a level for completing all challenges in each tome.
---
Ad you prevent my injured panicking ass from escaping through the hatch I’m crouching on cuz I know I can’t make the run to the opened exit.
---
Most of them don’t accept the lose and want easy games where everyone plays like a potato
---
Literally that strategy only works if you keep spamming demon dash and don't use your M1. You have COMPPETE turning with his M1, if you miss or get another oni to miss, thats on the player; not oni himself
---
If you’re looking for good perks, Leatherface has Barbeque &amp; Chili, Flesh and Mud has Hex: Ruin and Curtain Call has Pop Goes The Weasel. All of these are excellent perks, and Ruin is an absolute must have.
---
If you’re looking for fun killers, my personal favourites are Shattered Bloodline, Stranger Things and Nightmare on Elm Street
---
He got a Christmas jumper like 2 weeks ago
---
Since I don't recall exactly, but who were the five killers? I known for sure Legion got nerfed hard, but who else?
---
probably. But what if you weren't at the hatch, hmm? Can never know
---
Meg when she get hooked: *AAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
---
Stranger things is one Im looking into, I love the show and he looks amazing. Care to explain about the perks? Maybe I'll get both stranger things and one of the perks
---
LOL so you’re bragging about a 4k as Ghostface....on Lery’s.....with a disconnect.
---
Strong killer on his strongest map where you can sneak up on survivors without them aware and one person even quit early thus removing some of the pressure.
---
This reminds me of the guy earlier who as a rank 1 bragged that he wiped out a load of survivors from ranks 12-17.
---
Seems killer mains set the bar low.
---
Nurse’s asylum map
---
No one calls him "The Ghost Face" because having "The" in the name was a really dumb choice in the game's design team. Before, he dropped he was supposed to be "The Ghost", but I believe that caused issues name-wise with Wraith and Spirit in other languages.
---
This is why I hate the idea of the Survivors Rulebook, though I don't think tunnelling or camping are the best way to win, sometimes and I mean SOMETIMES they are necessary ways to gain the upper hand. The NO TUNNELLING OR CAMPING rules were made up by Survivors as they game became more balanced towards killers. You could play the whole game adhering to these rules and get punished for it, then get a lovely greeting of teabags and bm in post chat for your commitment to follow made up rules. Which is why it's pointless to do what they want because they would never give you the same courtesy. 
---
In regards to adrenaline, yes Survivors have alot of clutch perks which allow them to play bad and get away with it. Borrowed allow saves to be reckless and a garanteed escape even if it's right in front of your face, DS is a 60 second immunity from being hooked, even more so if you bring unbreakable, adrenaline resets any progress the killer has made on downs or hits for rushing the objective, which to be fair they have to actually earn adrenaline, but it's only prequisite is that you exist in the game when the last gen pops and makes endgame laughably the safest point of the game. Survivors know how easy it can be with these perks, which is why playing Survivor is so much more chill than playing killer. 
---
ALSO: The pipping system is messed up, you can get a 4k as killer and still blank pip (depip if your plague), playing Survivor you can die and still 2 pip (unless in red ranks) but still one pip.
---
Spirit, Legion, Nurse, Freddy and Oni.
---
Too bad you have to play through this instead of being able to just DC cause you’ll get punished!!! What a lovely gaming experience.
---
Flashlight saves have to be performed at a specific point in the pick up animation, if you do it too early, you’ll still get the blind and the points, but the survivor won’t be dropped
---
I wrote a bunch and then erased it because you have it. The stealth makes it so wraith and ghostface can sneak up on people and initiate chases when they aren't in optimal positions. For legion you always know they are coming and can plan accordingly.
---
I hate it for the simple reason that it *could* be great, but it's unlikely to get there due to the incompetence of the devs.
---
I would say wiggling still gives you a super tiny chance of escape. There's always the chance that there the closest hook is *just* far enough away and also next to the escape hatch.
---
I prefer Gideon, if he were to dc in the beginning then I wouldn't be bragging about it and not even a killer main
---
DbD is really a good game.
---
But very toxic. (Like most good online games)
---
Many kids telling you to eff off if its not going their way ect ect. 
---
If you know you're good and that everyone effs up sometimes, you're fine. 
---
Let them talk and keep it cool. You wont see them again (hopefully). 
---
Congrats on red rank!
---
At least I have a set goal when going into a game. After playing the same game mode over and over, I lose any and all interest in playing, with challenges I’m exited to be trying a different build or perk I might not otherwise use.
---
that's not what they're on about, I didn't even know what you were talking about with your ea li-. what the problem is, is that you said information but didn't know the source. this game has bad rep for saying things that aren't true and being taken serious. so anytime there isn't a source for something, it's not taken seriously. and anytime someone says, "idk where I saw it but I know bhvr said it" it's also not taken seriously. it's actually a meme at this point. so next time you want to say something you think is true, please just provide the source or a general idea of where it is. such as where I said it was on the wiki.
---
Would have loved to been in that post-game chat. Serves them right.
---
*"it´s in the name"*
---
This made my Day somehow
---
I know it doesn’t mean much on console, but I’ve been pulling them off recently and man it feels great.
---
Damn. Oh well. One day I'll get my Bill Cosmetics. Until then I'm fine playing as that new Yui girl
---
You have to do all different hooks
---
Absolutely deserved it. like, just run and go. don't be a dick.
---
After tons of games against pallet respecting killers (and refusing to ask to farm it), finally I came across a Huntress of all killers who didn't respect a single pallet... Thank you from the bottom of my hewrt
---
The Shape is Michael's other canonical name in the Halloween franchise. DBD didn't make that name up.
---
&gt; Raid: Shadow Legends.
---
lmao, what's the actual R slur tho?
---
Delete this
---
Yes. I will purposely stop moving for a second when the "repair" prompt shows up and *then* start repairing just to ensure that at no point do I stop crouching.
---
I'm a hag main so if you had any other questions about facing her let me know. She is a very strange killer to face, and new players practically throw themselves at me.
---
Barbeque lets you see survivor auras when you hook someone, with the added bonus of doubling your bloodpoints. Ruin is unfortunately mostly luck based but when it works it can slow the game down dramatically. Pop lets you regress a generator by 25% if you kick it after hooking a survivor. 
---
Most of the best survivor perks are available in the base game, but I think Feng Min’s Alert is super underrated. Let’s you see the killer’s aura whenever they break a pallet or gen
---
I feel like there was a lost message. The fact that he can't kill the survivors but still not derank is broken. I don't know if op was trying to derank and I didn't want to be rude and say he's just not good enough to be rank one. The mechanics are just trash and they don't leave you at a rank that gives a balanced experience. Not to mention, when you max out the rank of a video game, there can still be a huge gap from bottom of the top and top of the top.
---
You’ll know after the fact when I send you an angry message.
---
Then why are you complaining lmao shut up
---
He was being a dick but that nurse was really fucking dumb lol
---
The chances of people finding the hatch are pretty low. I think I've only had 2-3 people find the hatch before EGC in 1500 hours of play.
---
Also making Mori's only work after 2nd hook makes them have almost zero strategic value at all. You'd be better off burning literally any other offering. Mori's should have some kind of strategic value as they come with a cost and aren't entirely common even if people tend to have a lot of them.
---
So can Hillbilly and Oni, except they run faster.
---
I sound like a goof ball, but thank you!
---
I hope you are kidding about selling them, I really do.
---
Interestingly enough, in the November stats release, it was one of the three deadliest maps overall. I don't know if this just shows how survivor sided most maps are or if the if the list of killers that this map is good for is much longer (I think it's more of the latter but I also expect the lack of a god window helps it in the former as well).
---
Some? Try 90% But of course you'll get that person who says "It DoESnT eVer HapPEn to mE."
---
I was serious. Until I realized copyright is a thing... it was an afterthought
---
Bc Nurse is genuinely not fun to play as anymore and it’s bc her basekit nerf makes her feel clunky and unplayable, and it’s destroyed her red rank viability.
---
Awesome art, Myers would destroy the other to tho lol
---
Ah, I see it now. Sleepy eyes saw Blood Warden instead of Thrilling Tremors!
---
I actually did this once, fun build.
---
I would 100% buy that dlc, imagine having Heather, Harry or James as survivors. It would be damn awesome
---
I think the survivor perk from the halloween pack is also really great, after you're unhooked in any way if the killer catches you, you can stab him and stun him for a few seconds and escape.
---
I've come to accept that I'm terrible at looping as a survivor. I think the best plan for me until I get better is just to stay away from the killer as much as possible and not get caught. What is the best survivor build for that? I would think spine chill to help know when the killer is nearby. Are there any other perks that give a warning when the killer is approaching so I can get to safety?
---
Ah, I see it now. Sleepy eyes thought I saw Blood Warden instead of Thrilling Tremors!
---
Just babies looking for excuses on why they lost. Is SWF very powerful? Yes, but most don’t even abuse the most powerful aspects of it, and act cocky and run straight into you looking for “plays”.
---
For new killers to play, it up to the play style. Personally I mostly played trapper but wraith is a good one. You can easily roam the map and his surprise attack gives blood points. Freddy is also a good one since he is simple to play.
---
My main thing with it is that it was a gift by someone close. It just kinda seems rude to turn around and then sell it. Unless I'm missing something and missed the point entirely.
---
True
---
I'm a survivor main
---
Yes, Decisive Strike is a great perk but I didn’t mention it because you said you already have Halloween.
---
Wasn't Legion the only one out of those actually nerfed? Spirit got a cheese removed and an addon change, Nurse got a bunch of addon changes but I thought she was mostly still the same, Freddy is a new killer, and Oni was adjusted at launch from the ptb.
---
Imagine your main not being dummy thicc
---
Brought to you by the Jane Gang
---
Oh, I am chasing their teammates. Not them.
---
Isnt Freddy like laughing stock of DbD killers?
---
:/
---
Yes imo the halloween pack is 100% worth it, super fun to use.
---
Just make it 4 kills again. There was no reason to change it
---
It can also be stupidly hard to find gens that spawn in small rooms with line of sight blockers.  If no one has touched the gen yet so that it's producing noise, it can be very hard to figure out exactly where the gen that is supposed to be in that general area is.
---
Or they'll know after the fact when someone thanks them for sticking around
---
I agree, Halloween is probably my favourite chapter. Great survivor perks, great killers perks and a really fun killer to play as.
---
The fact that he could 180 before was really bad.
---
No that makes sense! But it was actually her idea, she liked how it turned out and is thinking about making cross stitches for Etsy. Like making new ones for people not the ones that were gifted.
---
The only thing I hate about this game really is just how toxic some people are. They just ruin what's supposed to be a fun game.
---
I'm getting my brutal killer with the two kills + DC penalties. I play how I want. I'm not a swEaTBAg for wanting my points. I'm the killer, I decide how I play. I want to kill everyone even with 2 dcs, its not my problem your teammates are asshats. Being entitled cunts to escaping through the hatch is the reason we slug, because you didn't even deserve it at first
---
lmao i know
---
UL does still have some very solid loops on some tiles, it's just so hard to orient yourself in the map to quickly access them.  Unlike most maps where you can see the tile as you approach it to get a general idea on how you'll need to enter it to run it right, you've got no clue with UL's tiles.   The map could REALLY do with some glass windows on some tiles just so orienting yourself as survivor is more reasonable.
---
I am bad.
---
You’ll never get better unless you practice/get comfortable running the killer! Spine chill is always good, especially against stealth killers. Iron will is also great... it can be a huge life saver
---
Billy: Vroom Vroom
---
I've been playing for six months and I thought it was a weird bug... I am the dumbest dbd player xD
---
pink addon on flashlight isn't actually good, i've heard.
---
The pallet-drop challenge definitely required farming to get done.
---
Not disagreeing - but as a survivor main, I hate that 99% of my daily rituals are for killers and I can only get rid of one every 24 hours. The archive allows me to get some extra bloodpoints while not having to be the killer. Also, as someone who doesn't ever try new builds, it does make me try new perks and do things I wouldn't normally do.
---
None of us have actual records of all the times a killer has complained, so no one can give an accurate percentage. In my experience, most of the time a killer complains in the after game chat when survivors are abusing exploits or trolling lower rank killers, not because they’re running annoying perks or they’re just better at the game.
---
Léry’s? But not Mother’s Dwelling, Blood Lodge, Crotus Prenn, or any other large map or map with a god loop? Nice
---
Ooooh, I see. I think that would be a great idea, she's pretty talented in making them, I'm sure somebody would love to add it to their collection.
---
Yep. Anyways I'd either pick up the ruin, barbeque, doctor (dont remember perk) and pop. Or pick up stranger things and barbeque. Can't decide lol.
---
people who tbag are dickheads. I never tbad cause i aint a dickhead. i run
---
Thanks! I’ll pass along the compliment, but like I said after we posted this we got to thinking that there may be some copyright issues involved, but I’m glad people like them!
---
Oh man, that reminds me, Doctor’s Monitor &amp; Abuse is fantastic as well
---
I guess she’ll T-bag closer to the exit next time. 😂
---
To be completely fair, Freddy's add-ons were a common complaint surrounding his rework, which even killer mains themselves agreed they were problematic. Plus it was only his add-ons that got nerfed, still amazing regardless. 
---
Same goes for Spirit and Nurse. 
---
Nurse was a very powerful killer, the most powerful and still is, but remained that way for years. Omega blink nurse was ridiculously OP, and even the Nurse mains agreed that this was too much. Pretty much the same thing for Spirit, extremely strong add-ons with very *little* to no counter play at all to her with no add-ons at all.
---
 I definitely agree that Legion and Oni's nerf was very unnecessary. Don't know if you were saying these were deserved or not, but let I want to have a discussion so do let me know what you think.
---
Yeah this one! A video recommended using michael myers with this perk.
---
I felt that.
---
You can try to run spine chill + alert to have multiple info on the killer's location. 
---
Also, level 3 lightweight reduce your scratchs marks from 7 seconds to 4. If you can get some distance from the killer, it may be enough to lose your track.
---
She can be a very challenging killer to play against, especially if you save your masks for late in the match.
---
Now, does she need a nerf? I'm not too sure about that.  I feel like there are other things begging for it, like Spirit or BBQ Billy.
---
Every.. SINGLE. Time.
---
Just because you're a good killer doesn't automatically mean the survivors still can't get past you with 5 gens. Plus, the the goal is to kill the survivors, while the gens are the secondary objective. The game doesn't end after 5 gens are done.
---
He was, now he is a top tier killer after his rework.
---
first time i thought it was a bug too, but i read the add ons the killer was using, and i realized that it was not a bug hahahaha
---
That'd be nice. Knowing the map while in ready screen so you can choose perks depending on the map. That'd make the game way more competitive.
---
Even though Clown's bottles could be more unique I still think he's fun to play as. I also think he has really nice looking cosmetics. Hopefully he can get some dev love eventually.
---
&gt;Lery’s rework
---
Ah yes, let's focus on reworking a slightly killer sided map instead of the like 75% which are survivor sided.
---
What really boggles my mind is most maps don't even need a rework, just some tweaking to prevent certain things spawning if other things spawn. That and a few size reductions.
---
Ahahahah thats what I love about this game!
---
Wait.. Do I have to get their bloodweb to level 35 to unlock this perks? Or I auto unlock them?
---
They complain about Lerys because it's just unfun in general.
---
It feels terrible for many killers who basically have no power (Billy and Huntress are basically reduced to only M1s, and Trapper has so little to hide his traps with that his options are much more limited than normal), for survivors it's a confusing map that is super hard to find points of interest on.
---
Depending on the situation, I also like to hang around so the killer could do a daily if they have one.  Specifically the Huntress, Demo, and Doctor dailies, if you don’t play them and are up against good survivors (Who know how to juke the abilities and you don’t know the ranges/charges times well enough to hit them reliably) it can take an annoying amount of time to land the abilities enough to get the daily finished.
---
Yes because survivors sure have a chance of escaping in a 2 vs 1 game. Totally balanced.
---
You do you, you can do what you want. Just don’t be surprised when survivors disconnect rather than put up with your bullshit. Some people just want to have fun and aren’t virgins that take the pips so serious. They want to play a game. When one game is thrown bu ragequitters they would just like to call it a loss and move on to the next. Not sit around waiting a few minutes so you can feed your ego by showing the survivors that “I iz teh winnar!!”.
---
Then enjoy your de-pip ;) because you wont be getting anything else from one survivor
---
Is this an inappropriate joke that I don’t know about yet?
---
I'm betting the they'll only be based around killers/survivors that are given to you at the start. So that everyone can participate. Maybe. I'm thinking back if all of the perks required for these challenges are free perks.
---
You guys remember when snap out of it considered healing....
---
Yeah and the devs said that wasn’t supposed to be, they literally forgot they made that a patch. Sigh good job devs
---
Evan and Philip being friends
---
Your daily rituals are 99% of the time killer because you play survivor 99% of the time. If you played killer 99% of the time you would only get survivor challenges. If you play equally you wouldn't have this problem.
---
The point in dailies is to get you to try something new.
---
At the very least it's not Nurse-friendly. I'll never forget this one Nurse from months ago who really had something to say to me in the post-game for burning Lery's. I guess all of the junk lying around blocks her blinks in most rooms but I don't know since I have never played her before or after her rework.
---
Technically Claudette has already started, and I’m glad I’m a claudette main
---
That’s a high quality GPU, there’s no reason for the throttling. My guess is the game is actually using your integrated graphics card instead. Otherwise, I have no idea, perhaps a faulty install of DbD?
---
"iTs jUsT tHe lAg, iTs nOt tHe bRokEn hiT bOxeS"

there you go. Im sorry

There's only like five annoying ones though...
---
"You get what you fucking deserve"
---
No one deserves hate on what ever they run . They shouldn’t be hated for it.
---
Pretty cool but i gotta, r/croppingishard
---
wHaT wAs I sTaBbEd WiTh?
---
It was a trapper and he wouldnt hook us. He'd hit us down then leave. He hit all of us for probably about 30 minutes without hooking any of us then when the last gen was almost done he started hooking. Half the game i was on yhe ground recovering
---
I'd be ok with it if it only activated when the killer is a certain distance away from the hook. Like only activating if the killer is within 32 meter's
---
It cannot use the iGPU, it's deactivated through BIOS. I noticed that DBD sets the Disk Usage at 100% all the time. I reinstalled the game 2 times.
---
I understand
---
Everything about this clip hurts to watch
---
oh no she is still crazy OP.
---
People freak out at the slightest nerfs to killers, they act like its something like what happened to oni or legion. 
---
She is still the best, just harder
---
God bless em but I still cannot understand how they are so slow with making changes with over 200 employees working on the game.
---
Im sorry guys but they will NEVER give us a chainsaw for ash.
---
i think is prety strong, was nerfed a bit, but still can ignore pallets, walls and stuff, takes lots of practice, but is a great killer, very fun also
---
I hope they do something like that, it’s one of my favorite maps in the game. I just hope they don’t change it too much.
---
This happened during a Custom match because the person didn’t want to get stabbed first by Michael Myers. It didn’t matter either way because they ended up as a sacrifice and I escaped
---
What happened to the timer?
---
Ah, yes. Thank you for adding that insightful input
---
May be just killer mostly and dumped a ton of blood points into a survivor? Just a guess.
---
Gotta do it closer to the exit so when you fall forwards you automatically exit... dumbasssssssss
---
Thats really annoying and it shouldnt be possible. Even if we ignore the fact that all killers have superpowers, they  can grab and carry survivors around the map without problems, some of them (oni, trapper,billy .....) are even over 100kg of lethal power, there is no way a 60kg claudette can block them.
---
Don't forget Borrowed Time.  Basically 15 free seconds of you can't hit me na na na na na na.  And god forbid you do.  Because now it's a 30 second to a minute chase to follow that up.
---
I think if you interact with anything or get in a locker it should deactivate. If you have time to complete objectives, you're not being tunneled.
---
Am I the only one who felt like Lery's is a decent map currently? I don't have issues on it as survivor or killer (red ranks both sides if it matters). I actually find it a bit killer sided if anything.
---
Unpopular Opinion: 
---
If players didn't get so bizarrely caught up in bullshit honor code wars it'd be a bit less of an issue. There's such a large margin of what people can do in-game, and then there's what the players actually tolerate, and I think that tolerance could afford to be a little bit higher.   
---
Like, yeah, BRs and Russians click their flashlights and teabag me after every pallet drop. 
---
Yeah, I get camped by people, I get patrolled, I get put into the basement with T. Imperative.  Just vibe with it. People do shit.
---
Nurse is harder to learn to play now, because failing multiple blinks is now more punishing. She's still probably the strongest killer in the game, but her skill floor is very high.
---
I don't think you understood the post. She deserved that for missing. Not because of instas
---
Oh really? It might explains a lot. I am confusion about flashlights
---
Freddy seems to be the only thing that works for me at high ranks. I get bullied as every other killer lol
---
Really? I only find the center room to have super bad pallets. The other pallets are workable for loop for me.
---
It took me a minute too see Claudette
---
level up nurse for nurses calling, and u have a great gf build: bbq, ruin, sloppy butcher, nurses calling
---
You already posted this? I'm confused. Are you trying to get more karma or something?
---
Balancing around realism is a great way to ensure this game’s survival /s in all reality though it’s there for a reason the nurse just played dumb she should have whacked and use the loss of collision to her advantage right away
---
I've had it where I've completed a challenge for it to not register lol. Its kinda like how some achievos are bugged. I had to win 3 matches to get Jane romeros achiev when she released lol.
---
I just want better maps bro. I don’t even care about any of their perks anymore. Just fix the maps.
---
That would be pretty cool
---
No, just tried to get a better quality. Sorry for the confusion.
---
Sorry that me and my teammates wanted to try to help I guess
---
Real life physics have very little to do with gameplay. I don't understand why you've got a problem with me here
---
Ooooh i see
---
Happened to the entire killer shack for me
---
The sad pert is, I've seen people with like 1k+ hours do it.
---
What do you use on Freddy?
---
Oh noes! Survivors are being mean! I would rather be teabagged and be able to play vs being at the mercy of a killers connection.
---
A killer can still play regardless if survivors are toxic or wholesome vs a killer who lagswitches. It's hardly an equal playing field in that regard.
---
Are y'all just on the Haddonfield meme-train that keeps chugging along? Cause unlike everyone here devs should have an idea of how lethal Haddonfield is now that they nerfed BL. We don't know how numbers were affected by that alone.  
---
Also "survivor-sided" maps still have kill rates over 50% so there ain't even survivor-sided maps. Just balanced 2K and killer-sided 3K maps.
---
Smh. Need that chainsaw. Laurie can stab people with glass but ash can’t even have his own chainsaw that’s vital in the show. Smh. Damn behavior.
---
Ikr, i feel like maps shouldn't be insanely killer or survivor sided. But just balanced
---
Survivors on the same gen is a good thing. There's diminishing returns. It buys you 2 minutes of set up or only having to check a few generators. If you have literally any information perk you've cost them so much gen time by time CI has cleared and the one or two you've chased. 
---
It's the same as ruin except less potential and much less risk. If you get a hook before it's gone, you're in a good place. If you get two you're jiggin', if you don't find anyone and it's cleared, you brought 3 perks, RIP. 
---
Besides CI is more for territorial Killers like Trapper.
---
It's pretty cool, I'm not an RDR fan, but you did a good job. :)
---
I got this archive challenge completed when I had a Hag on Lery's I did like 2 or 3 more just to be safe I got it.
---
I understand plague's ability, and how it works with corrupt and all that jazz. However what's the best strategy to use when playing her? Do you commit to every Chase and down a survivor or do you just infect them then move on to infect everyone else? I'm struggling to play her well.
---
I get hit from a mile away
---
They’ll never fix them.
---
Meta shit. Bbq, thanatophobia, pop goes the weasel, and of course, ruin.
---
Thank you! I don't really play DBD myself but I do watch my Girlfriend play it all the time and I like The Pig!
---
You did your job. But this should not be possible. It ruin the immersion.
---
 It's a freaking flying ghost, you should run!
---
The issues with balancing for some characters is so bad that it feels as if they don't even understand their own game.
---
That would be pretty stupid, actually. You wanna nerf it, let's talk about nerfing NOED right along with it.
---
One is a killer perk, the other a survivor one. Ofc the killer counterpart is stronger
---
BBQ game changing? It has 9 counters.. no other perk has that many counters which most of them are usable without running any perk, just game knowledge
---
Plus you can also get 32k on survivor too, it's just harder since you are most likely not gonna complete everything by yourself but still possible. Plus 22k~ isn't a bad average for survivors
---
they should jsut do multiple floors, like another ward of the hospital. A morgue is a common suggestion.
---
You have done well
---
She’s strong but a lot of people don’t find her fun to play anymore.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Level up
---
No one cares
---
Still, you're the proof that survivors are the most toxic players in this game
---
Sorry this happened to you. I haven't played the game in a long time, so I haven't encountered this (just can't afford ps plus).
---
Aww no! xD yea, she's definitely not the strongest killer, but with time and practice she can be super fun x) Bonus: she's got the best mori in the game imo xp (not that I use mori's, lest there's a challenge xpp )
---
Of course. It's something that would hit every player
---
It would hit survivors harder since they DC more often but would also hit killers if they do
---
It was a good suggestion and a good thing to know in future, but sadly didn't affect it.
---
I forgot about this, but also if I try load a cinematic from the Archives I get a black screen. Clicking a button takes me back to the Archives, but my sound has turned off now. Dunno if that extra information helps at all
---
yes but that was nerfed from the PTB and he was literally fine on PC not OP not shit and still fun but then they just fucked it more and said "hey pc have console turning" and now u might as well just go straight bc ur not gonna curve around any wall
---
The inherent problem with SWF is the game is (theoretically) balanced around not having information on your teammates by default.  You need to sacrifice perk slots/take items for things like Bond/Empathy/Kindred/Key auras to get the info that SWF get more reliably for free.  SWF in Discord chat is giving every survivor in the group 3+ free perks that solo survivors/killers don’t get, and increased efficiency on several others (1 OoO in SWF means every survivor gets the benefit but only 1 gets the drawback)
---
My favorite killer to play
---
It's a killer with supernatural powers, we should hide and run away from him like in the trailer, not searching him and troll him like many survivors do.
---
Yeah they have no chance of winning, and that's normal. The game is designed for 4v1, not 2v1. DCs shouldn't happen and the DC penalties helped a lot not having as many DCs (and even killing themselves on hook). Some people do want to have fun and I do too, and my fun is having a feeling of progressing. And really, virgin as an insult? Damn, you're sad. And if you want to really call it a loss then go to the killer, loop him a while and get as many points as you can, or die to him to let him 4k and move on. You aren't feeding my ego, my goal is to kill you. You're just an entitled little bitch honestly. There is NO reason to DC in this game, ever. Bad map, mori, key, SWF, no reason. Fuck your entitlement
---
I am gonna be honest Onis perks arent great and playing him is not fun
---
This made me cackle. OP's just mad
---
I came up against a Freddy with a build that just bullied me as he just had obsession perks and add ons. It doesn’t help that I was using a build with object and sole survivor
---
My 2019 review:
---
Highest ranks achieved: Rank 9 for survivor (planning not to touch red ranks) and Rank 15 for killer (I don't like to kill) Started late January with Legion.
---
All of the chapters have been pretty enjoyable. All the killers are all viable and at least mid-tier. The perks are all pretty good except for Ash's perks, Ghostface's Furtive Chase, Demo's Mindbreaker and Cruel limits, Yui's Lucky Break, Steve's perks, and Oni's Zenshin Tactics. 
---
Perkwise, I agree with all the changes except for Balanced Landing, which I wish wasn't nerfed that much. Would have been better to fix Haddonfield first. I wish for buffs to Ash's perks, because Mettle of Man should also count safe unhooks. There are still many perks I want to buff, like Demo's perks and no Mither with a Bloodpoint bonus and beginning with healthy state and WGLF to have some kind of aura reading like BBQ and Chili. 
---
Dedicated servers is a meh to me, I haven't felt much differences but do notice a lot of times when my hits as survivor or killers should not have hit. 
---
The new maps are very good, though the reworks to preschool are a bit better, but I have no idea what are the differences between the 5 maps. All-in-all, good job :)
---
And I hate the nerfs for Legion, Oni, Nurse, and Pig. Spirit was the only nerf I agreed with. The Freddy rework, however, is excellent and I hope won't be changed anymore. forever Freddy nerf was needed. I hope Pig gets an addon fix and her endgame pressure back. Oni needs to have 50% of his flick back. Legion, just check the forums. And Nurse's addons are almost useless, I have found only 6 addons that I would use regularly, the others aren't good. And the cooldown was kinda unnecessary and unfun. Doctor buff is exciting, but I hope to see buffs for Bubba and Clown, as they are too loopable. Clown is basically a weaker version of Freddy. 
---
I don't really like how the events have been pretty disappointing(except for the lunar new year, that was amazing, and kinda the 3 year anniversary), and with them not giving Winter Solstice. I also don't like how they are stopping the events and only doing double bloodpoints, which definitely sounds like a bad tradeoff. Yes, I know they want to focus more on bug fixes, etc, but it just doesn't feel right. 
---
The Emblem system is meh to me, because it punished you severely if you die due to the mistakes of other survivors, like a survivor farming you off hook and the killer deciding to just kill you on the spot. It also annoys me when I do amazing in a match and escape, but still get a safe pip.
---
I am also disappointed when the devs decided to not give some of the cosmetics, because even though older players complained they worked "hard" for them, it is just because they discovered the game first. It feels unwelcoming and unfair for newer players to not get them. It would have been a better choice to give something extra to those who already had the cosmetics. Only cosmetics that shouldn't be given out freely is legacy, because they deserved it.
---
There is still a lot of toxicity and playstyles that I wish could be more punished, such as bullying in post-game chat, farming survivors in front of killers and doing it again to kill the survivor, disconnects (unfair for remaining survivors, and for killers to get more points), facecamping, and more. No one wants to face these playstyles and will probably chase away more players from playing the game if they continue to exist. It isn't easy to change the mindset of survivors and killers though.
---
And matchmaking. Is. Horrendous. It used to be okay, but I have been getting either gray rank teammates or facing red and purple rank survivor gods as killer that I can't even hit. And I have faced maybe 10 games of these the past few weeks already.
---
There is also Archives, which I love the idea of collecting lore. However, the rewards just isn't too worth it on the free side, there should be something in every slot and not have empty slots for 20 tiers towards the end. I also hate how some of the challenges are near-impossible, and how grindy it is. You are competing against other survivors and the killer to get the archives done, so it is impossible for everyone to easily get theirs done quickly, because you have survivors already stealing your unhooks and flashlight saves, and also as killer get survivors who disconnect so you don't get your challenges. Disconnects should really count. Love the idea, hate the grind and how long it takes to finish even 2 quests.
---
Gen times are still so fast for any killer that doesn't have any mobility or slowdown perks. And Survivor still feels unfair when the killer goes directly after you get unhooked without Decisive Strike or Borrowed Time.
---
All in all, I give a 8/10. There are still many nice and understanding players in this game, and the game has been very fun and my new personal favorite. Glhf, and ggwp :)
---
are u 12 years old? fucking act normally
---
I never said it was stopping killer’s from playing, it’s just a dickish and unnecessary thing to do. Yes, lagswitching is a worse undoubtedly, but it’s hardly ever done and is bannable, so you don’t see it often, if at all. It’s not a competition, two things can be toxic at the same time - one doesn’t have to be worse than the other to be talked about lmao
---
He is pretty nasty right now. On console I would say he is s tier.
---
i wish they make tomes of al the og killers, they are great, the evan one was awesome, with the lore, the cosmetics and all that
---
I just want maps to be balanced and have some counterplay almost everywhere but when haddonfield has enough pallets and windows u dont rly need to loop it then wtf is the point
---
I think the Spirit nerf was necessary, maybe Nurse too, but Oni and Legion were definitely uncalled for and forever Freddy was never so OP that it couldn't be countered. My point is that all of those were just to improve survivor gameplay, yet god loops, huge maps, and other century old issues are still a thing in 2020...
---
i main wraith
---
say what u want but if BHVR isnt gonna balance their game the DC punishment is only gonna fuck with ppl that have internet problems and game problems not the ppl that DC
---
Soooo... thats the Hag. Hahahaha that was funny
---
What are the ABCs as a killer chasing a survivor? How long until I give up? I’m a Freddy main and even though I’m setting snares in key loop areas, it seems like they always make it to another loop area without snares, which when I place them in that area, they simply move on again. I’m getting loop-bitched.
---
Definitely. He can just pick survivors off one by one as he slows down everyone else. Kinda disgusting
---
And demogorgon?
---
They'd all die in less than seconds because you can't run in circles, and do squats in rapid succession to get away from Jason, freddy etc.
---
Why would that be stupid? NOED doesn't need a nerf, it's an awful perk.
---
Imagine getting bullied by a default dwight
---
SAME!!! Others don’t scare me/I can see them coming but the hag scares the living shit out of me.
---
She’s not as easy to play as sprit or GF so people don’t bother but in experiences hands (extremely rare now) she is still the best killer imo
---
\&gt;2019  
---
\&gt;still thinking The Game is killer-sided  
---
I WAS SO STARTLED LMAO
---
Or look at the killer when running
---
SURE DID
---
This community really downvote for the sake of downvoting now huh
---
Yeah I forgot about that. Though that was a good change since it was all chance
---
can be fun his perks are quite bad except Surge with the pig perk Surveillance but nothing I would suggest going for
---
Says the guy with the name DrFruitLoops, dont get mad because I proved your point wrong🤣
---
Hmm, yeah, an awful perk, I guess that's why it's one of the most used ones, huh?
---
Omg u changed it from cute to downright handsome well done lol
---
People get upset because these kinds of comments are usually phrased like "Why are all survivors/killers such toxic crybabies?" Obviously people are going to get upset when a group that they are a part of is generalized as toxic.
---
Wow what an unique complaint
---
Wait, let me take notes for this brilliant idea that nobody has thought of for 3 years!
---
Thanks for your contribution
---
&gt;!/s!&lt;
---
bc ive had a name for 15+ years that I been playing games makes me the kid here and not the pre teen spamming laughing emojis like it is Instagram
---
DS should deactivate if the survivor starts working on a generator or a totem. Before you guys slam me with downvotes, hear me out. DS is meant to be an anti-tunneling perk, but if you are safe enough to begin working on the objective, you are *not* being tunneled. This change would encourage survivors to heal instead of instantly jumping on a gen in front of the killer with no punishment.
---
\*Work on a gen\*  
---
\*Use stealth when killer approaches\*  
---
\*Killer wastes half a gen worth of time going to your gen, looking around without finding you and then going to another gen\*  
---
Time lost healing if gotten hit = 0  
---
Time lost by the team going for a save because you got hooked = 0  
---
Team hook phases lost = 0  
---
Number of pallets wasted = 0  
---
Other survivors: Y aRe U nOt CoNtRiBuTiNg?! REEEEEEEEEEEEEE  
---
Killers: Y aRe U hIdInG iNsTeAd Of LoOpInG wHiCh I aLsO hAtE? REEEEEEEEEEEEE  
---
Why are you booing me? I'm right.
---
funny thing about the "dark senses" challenge: it incentivizes you to give up on hook if gens get done while you're hooked. Once it's impossible for you to be on 4 gens while they get fixed, like say if 2 (or 1) get fixed while you're hooked, your time may well be better spent leaving the match and trying again in the next one.
---
I'd have done it a few times if not for the fact I'd already finished the rift by then.
---
Get some puke on them and find someone else to puke on until everyone is infected. Then, just finish up to get them broken and play like a regular m1 killer unless they cleanse, then just reinfect them, take the corrupt puke and kill everyone
---
Adjust your brightness in your GPU driver settings every time you get the map. It'll make the maps look washed out but at least you'll be able to see. It's a bit of a hassle and not a permanent solution, but there's no permanent fix that I know of until BHVR does something about it
---
Insidious, Devour hope, Cruel limits and Noed on Michael Mayonnaise.
---
It's something that must be done by Behaviour. Ask it on the forum.
---
🤷‍♀️ I say for every downvote that's how many more bubba's you make rage quit hahaha
---
You don’t want survivors chugging thru bloodwebs faster. More bps is more items more items is more keys more keys is more mori’s/lobby dodges. You give survivor too many bps and Franklin’s/ivory mori’s will be a hell of a lot more common. No one wants this.
---
Can't wait for some more killer nerfs! This game is doing great and totally isn't a headache to play at red ranks without ruin. Gens should be done in 70 seconds because 80 seconds w/o greatskill checks is way too slow :(((
---
That's true, but at least it's universal
---
good ol P2P
---
James is so pure he'd let his Character be free too.
---
Lmao that title is so funny, been there big F.
---
Post this to r/Oinkers_
---
I just love The Pig because I'm a huge fan of the Saw series.
---
It really is the stealth aspect of the killer (Ghostface's being a little better than Wraith's since he can pop it whenver and come out with a hit whenever he wants). Ghostface for exemple will hit someone, commit a little and let them go to find someone else. If they find someone healing in nurses calling range they sneak up on them with their power for an easy down. Legion, though, doesn't have that. His power is to get the first hit but after that he can only follow up as an m1 killer with a heartbeat so no sneaky hits
---
They all kinda are scp already..
---
I mean the killers. Entity included.. an scp can be literally anything that can twist reality in any form, biological, time or anything that you can imagine
---
An scp can be a pen that write stories by itself and a paper that makes any description wrote in it become real, so..
---
Yea no it is close to pitch black and I dont wanna sit there and adjust my brightness more bc whenever I open google it fucking blinds me with the white background
---
wraith is fine
---
It seemed like there was still a small amount of time left though, weird but hilarious.
---
My DS is level 3 so it's active for 60 seconds. Laurie keeps the knife in her cooter.
---
Gotta love that crisp no lag servers😫
---
Next patch: "Fixed an issue that caused the killer to win"
---
I would insist that it’s an HDD issue, perhaps a partition speed problem, but all your other games work clearly. My last guess would be to check if all your RAM is being allocated while in DbD, you can check through Task manager.
---
Done!
---
So which ones should I go for?
---
NOED is pretty busted. But you can counter it without going to much out of the way. Unlike ds, you either pick em up and they get out, leave them on the floor and leave, or watch them for 60 seconds. To counter noed you just have to do totems which you don't lose anything for because you get points for cleansing them. And whats with people bringing up NOED when people start bringing up perks?
---
You kind of were tunnelling him. That's why it's active for 60 seconds. Why should there be no counter play to your trap? Sorry you got stabbed but it seems like it worked as intended.
---
There is no better feeling in existence than catching that survivor who chose to be toxic instead of leaving
---
she can stab me with that knife any day
---
The best is when ruin is gone and no other hints of a hex totem are around. meghead: Let's get the totem guyz!
---
This person gets it
---
This comment was a mistake
---
While I don't necessarily disagree with you, do you understand that if people want out of a game or simply don't want to play that match because of whatever reason, DC punishments wont change that, right?
---
Whenever I try this my ruin is always the first to go Q_Q
---
Is the switch version dead already?
---
I played tons before halloween but took a break for a couple of weeks when all other platforms got the halloween event and we didn't get the event.
---
I have to wait like 15 minutes for a survivor lobby now and I gave up after waiting  25 for a killer game last night. I know that my connection can be janky so im just wondering what other peoples experiences are.

“Get this get this: I’m going to throw down a bottle on one side of the loop, and walk in the other direction so that they are forced to throw down the pallet early. It’s gonna be fuckin lit dude.” -Scott Jund 2019
---
This is probably my favourite meme ever.
---
How? I literally went across the map and ran into him on a box. Was i supposed to act like i didn't see him? And last time i checked you dont have to wait 60 seconds to touch a box
---
Delete it fat
---
The dog from the dog ending.
---
Am I the only one who only gets SWF when playing killer? It’s fucking frustrating, especially being as a rank 14 killer and the survivors being rank red/purple with only T3 perks?
---
I’ve been outsmarted
---
The truth if I've ever heard it
---
^^^
---
Surveillance, that one demo perk (down survivor and gens blow), corrupt intervention, and overcharge
---
I've found people to say it's diffrent at least. Though the whole legion hate is never avoidable for me. Even if they've been nerfed into the basement
---
Yes it is, crouch the whole time and when you leave the gen start crouching immediately or she will pop up. Same for totems
---
idk man this is why I recommended the video a smarter person then me
---
It is, it requires you to give up the main objective for a boost in power at the end of the game. And that's if survivors don't cleanse. At the end of the game if the survivors aren't morons you'll only net one kill off it, which isn't worth everything you sacrificed to get there. The perk is a noob trap.
---
I think its fine, but every map could be up for some minor improvements. There is this one god loop in main experiment center, but dont know if its still strong after the balanced landing buff;
---
Over all im just hopin we get multiple versions of the map, thatd b super awesome
---
He is a pretentous asshole. He'd throw anyone under the bus for anything aswell. 
---
He has a shit reputation and it has been earned, not randomly fabricated.
---
THE KILLER FOUND ME! STREAM SNIPER! (Killer has bbq).
---
Not sure I followed that point. They call him Ghostface because that's his name, "just like how people say Legion not The Legion"? But Legion isn't their name or names.
---
I think his point was The Ghost Face is absolutely awful because that's like calling Micheal Myers "The Micheal Myers" or Legion "The Stabby Teens" 
---
Ghostface is the name of the killer and of the copycat killers, of which "The Ghost Face" is one, presumably. That or he's literally the fanfiction version. 
---
Micheal had The Shape organically, and it works. Leatherface's "The Cannibal" works, we all know he's a Cannibal. Even "The Nightmare" works, but nobody is going to call Freddy Krueger that. 
---
I stand by Ghostface should always have been called "The Actor" and they should have just made his back story slightly different. Have him be one of the people who played Ghostface in the Stab movies (The meta-movies that are based on the events of Scream) but he instead actually tried to kill the cast.
---
I had a guy do similar (I wasn’t mad, it’s nbd) I just wish he had let me open the exit gate for my Jake challenge 😑😑
---
NOED is a powerful perk. DS is a powerful perk. That's why it's constantly brought up. One wastes the killer's time, the other saves it. 
---
If you're of at least average intelligence, you can usually estimate when DS is over if you suspect a survivor has it and just avoid a survivor for that minute. Besides that, being hooked is excruciatingly boring. Nobody wants to be hooked twice in the same minute.
---
I love Lery’s, it’s honestly one of my favorite maps.
---
Are you surprised you get called an asshole when you behave like an asshole?
---
I know you don’t *care*, but don’t pretend like you don’t deserve the the ire.
---
Spireh
---
The genius behind your comment is that nobody knows what you main.
---
He should get a nightmare level rework as he doesn't have much going for him with his current state.
---
However Legion Clown anf Cannibal need reworks first.
---
Self care got nerfed but medkits got a buff. Also, a lot of killers are taking sloppy butcher now, upping the time to self care to around 40 seconds iirc
---
It would reduce it. It was definitely down during the timeout experiment based on what I experienced.
---
Just because it wont eliminate the problem completely doesn't mean people should be allowed to continue as they are.
---
Omg yes I’ve had that where I’ve had a challenge selected, done it and it acts like I haven’t. So frustrating lol
---
Imagine working on a gen on the second floor of a Haddonfield house. The killer comes, he KNOWS someone was working on that, and they vouldn't have left without making noise or leaving scratch marks, so he searches every nook and locker of that house.  
---
Meanwhile, you're already working on another generator pn the other side of the map.
---
I'm sorry you feel that way.  You're entitled to your opinion.
---
Sorry! I thought you were the same person who's been saying Oni sucks, so I wrongfully assumed you were being sarcastic. But yes, he moves at full speed with full turning and he is able to partially charge his attack and still OHKO survivors. Sorry again.
---
This next year is going to be important BHVR. While I wouldn't say it's 'make or break' time, they've kind of put it all on the line.
---
* Dedicated servers absolutely need to be adjusted / fixed. Congratulations, Lag switching is dead, but my god does every other aspect of the game seem to suffer.
---
* Disconnect penalties need to not be a joke. If they get put in the game but the time penalties reset every day or so then it will all be for nothing.
---
* While Lery's isn't unexpected for a rework, Haddonfield is still a god awful nightmare due to the relatively static layout and sometimes ridiculous long walls. 
---
* The impending Doctor rework has shown a worrying trend. BHVR isn't concerned with making a killer stronger or more efficient, all they want is for survivors to be less annoyed when they play against him.  I'm willing to wait and see more details but keeping my skepticism.
---
* Losing all events still seems like a bad move. The Rift / Archives are...well they're meh. The lore is really subpar and it feels like they try to say the same thing over 7-10 lore pieces.  Honestly I'd rather have the 'old' dailies back that give 100k+ BP upon completion but I know thats personal preference. 
---
I know this has gotten a bit rambly, but I think the gist is, the game needs something more than 4 killers/ 4 survivors / 4 maps this year. Something, anything to at least attempt a little innovation.
---
is that hentie
---
h e n t i e
---
Oh man!
---
Okay so I had just got ghostface from the cyber Monday/black friday right? It wasn't even 3 minuets into the game and two people DC'd, the other two were marked and had given up.
---
I then get four messages that all have "ghostface broken, kys dumbass." In some kind of wording.
---
My most annoying was when I got spirit, and I was given the haddonfeild infinite window. I actually just DC'd and one survivor messaged me saying how broken that window is when up against a spirit.
---
YOU ARENT STUCK WITH THE KILLER
---
YOU ARE STUCK IN HERE WITH ME
---
Someone else said it already, but I need to repeat. This is stupid. Not the survivors, that was a great play by them and a poor play by the Killer, but it is silly as all hell. 
---
I never understand why Micheal Myers can be bullied into a corner by a little girl, or the Demogorgon is physically unable to push some squishy humans.
---
I just want army of darkness ash :(
---
You're not supposed to have bbq n chilli and ruin at rank 20. If you're a good killer then you'll rank up while getting bloodpoints to unlock those perks. Doesn't even matter if you bring perks or not. If you've watched dbd videos then that already makes you compareable to rank 15's at least. You'll destroy the other side until you get to the rank you fit in. Ruin can also be cleansed, as its a hex perk. Has it crossed your mind that these "Very Rare Perks" include teachables? Should someone not be able to use their own perks until rank 10? Survivors just have to use slippery meat and spine chill while killers use spies from the shadows and monstrous shrine?
---
Sometimes the late 1k is just as satisfying as the 4K
---
Maybe she's into getting the plague.
---
Yes, it was teachables. That was what I meant by perks from different characters.
---
Honestly anything that got map pressure. I'd say GF is better than Wraith though with a hit and run playstyle. Nurse still remains #1 if played very well, followed by Freddy, Billy, Spirit and Ghostface
---
Making WGLF easier to stack should be a good enough buff tbh. Like from healing health states on other survivors.
---
You couldn't leave them alone for 60 seconds though? No worries, I'm sure it was a mistake. I am also positive you downed him after your well deserved stun, and rehooked him. But I'm sure it was a mistake too.
---
Monthly deranks can still set you back to 20. If they haven't played for multiple months in a row it's possible.
---
I did that one by hiding in lockers all game, waiting for my teammates to die (and trust me, without me helping on gens, they did) and then waiting for the killer to stomp hatch and patrol exit gates so that I could dash to hatch and escape with a key.
---
Got this on my 3rd try.
---
This would be a horrible idea. Part of what makes him scary is his slow but unstoppable approach, you can’t make Pyramid Head a fast moving character. It would just be dumb.
---
No, his point was literally everyone refers to The Ghost Face as Ghostface when they shouldn’t because he’s not the movie Ghostface.
---
I’m saying or maybe it’s because what else are we going to call him? Hey guys the killer is that guy who isn’t actually Ghostface. The game calls him Ghostface. He’s Ghostface, so people call him Ghostface.
---
Absolutely deserved it. If you're not sticking around to potentially save a fellow survivor, get out. Geez, such children.
---
lol for real clown just a guy were is his power
---
But he doesn’t swing his sword quickly at all...
---
Yeah I hate that map with a passion. As killer, survivors can just crouch in a bush and you probably won’t see them due to the lighting. As survivor the map is just painfully boring to play on.
---
"Is that a hen tie"
---
"Yes, sweetie, today is the day that I cross that fuckin' road"
---
I never realized that this was the intention but it makes so much sense. How could I have missed something so simple?
---
You’ve blown my mind here today.

That's a [pretty nice banner.](https://s3.deadbydaylight.com/data/seasonnal-g-plague-1920x1080-share.jpg)
---
The only change wraith really needs is to make his bell map wide by default. Anything else would be overkill I'd say.
---
Booooooo
---
Test out the perks I feel any killer is fine just comes down to preference when you play u don’t want it to be a drag playing a killer you don’t want to use
---
I had a friend who was convinced that Wraith players were hackers who modded their terror radius to be non-existent for a little while when they exited stealth till I told him about the brown addon that does exactly this lol
---
lmao
---
Never said it doesn't, but if we're going by a perk doing absolutely nothing then gameplay wise WGLF fills that role completely.
---
I say that as someone who uses it, I'm a bloodpoint whore.
---
That’s why they’re unnecessary challenges. If you don’t like them don’t do them.
---
at first I was like, "haven't played killer in a while, it seems... kinda jazzy now" and then I realized it was added music
---
Not really since literally everyone got out and the only reason you got him was pure luck instead of skill. Jbh
---
The Archives have absolutely ruined the game, but to be fair, it's the players fault. There's plenty of games with challenges and Battle Passes and the players of those games still more or less play the game normally while also attempting to complete challenges. In DBD, all players care about is completing the challenge. They'll unhook you in front of killer, they'll drop every pallet during a chase, they'll open every chest, etc.
---
Noed is a crutch perk and it punishes survivors for playing the game..so yes you’re the bad guy /s
---
oh this is some spicy OC me likey
---
Do you choke your patients irl?
---
You *saucy* boy
---
Someone who has some sense in em on this sub :D 
---
People get so emotionally invested in this game. I coudn't care less if someone tbags me, they're wasting time not getting to the next loop/getting distance which works for me.
---
It’s okay to want to bring out the good in ppl and encourage the community to not behave like dickheads.
---
Yeah- Boyfriend’s Memo, but the lunge is still really poor.
---
LOL
---
OP build, disgusting.

How the fuck did she not make it

They just haven't played in a long time. My friend is a rank 18 legacy Meg right now.
---
1. I have no respect for pigs who actually check their boxes.
---
You don’t need to be sorry about my accurate, well-reasonable, rational, and observation-informed opinion.
---
You need to be sorry about your own murky thinking.
---
I like that Nurse art. It reminds me of Hive wizards in Destiny.
---
DS doesn't always make the person who has it the obsession. The guy who got unhooked could be doing a gen or totem a good 40-50 seconds later. Do i ignore them even tho there's a high chance i can kill them? When i down them do i stare at them for 10-20 seconds? It's 100% a crutch perk just like NOED. If you get hooked twice within a minute while the killer is halfway across the map that's on you. Me complaining about it on reddit wont change the perk tho. I just wanted to rant somewhere and i appreciate you giving me a space to further rant
---
Ok seriously though, is it?
---
Candle Head Wraith is by far the best cosmetic in the game
---
Just be thankful it's not the same as it was in 2016 and 2017 where you could use it whenever you wanted :) 
---
This perk has been nerfed 3 times already and killer mains keep crying. 
---
If you can't find another survivor to down within a 60 second time frame after someone gets unhooked that's on you.
---
This happened to me 4 times yesterday. So fucking annoying!
---
If you know how to play her and time her blinks right she’s still very strong it’s made it a more punishing for new players could take a few games to get used to her
---
That's not what he said at all. He says we call "The Ghost Face" by the name of the character he is SUPPOSED to be, Ghostface. The game never calls him that, I think that's where you're confused. We call him Ghostface because that's who he is meant to be. 
---
Micheal Myers is called "The Shape", Leatherface is called "The Cannibal", Freddy Krueger is called "The Nightmare"
---
For those we usual refer to by the former because they're iconic, licensed Killers. But we don't call "The Ghost Face" Danny Johnson because that's not a person we've ever seen or heard of outside of DBD. We call him Ghostface because that's the Killers real identity. They didn't have the rights to any actual Ghostface so they had to make up a character and call him "The Ghost Face"
---
Again that would be like not getting the rights to anything from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, making up a character and calling them "The Leather Face"
---
Exactly. If people are going to the use '"I'm not having fun, therefore fuck everyone else in the game!" excuse then they shouldn't even be joining lobbies in the first place. 
---
At that point they're not even playing DBD, they're playing some bastardized version where they expect complete strangers to capitulate to their will.  The game is better off without them if they keep d/c'ing enough to rack up to the 1+ hour timers.
---
yeah, go on r/dbdgonewild if you want to go scour for it it was posted quite recently
---
This is beautiful.
---
yes let's pretend that 4/5 of those killers aren't still perfectly viable and capable of performing well.
---
I guess we could pretend that they didn't nerf some of survivors strongest tools either the past few patches either if you want to show your bias.
---
Thanks. Now I can stress about walking out of open gates too.
---
compared to Haddonfield or Ormond though?
---
Idk why they even run decisive strike I hate that perk when I play survivor I feel it as a wasted slot
---
You play on PC/PS4? If so I could give you some tips on killer. Also maybe a few on survivor, but I’m not nearly as good on survivor as killer.
---
Or this happens
---
https://youtu.be/o1DNwAgV4cI
---
You're right. You complaining on Reddit won't change the perk. Hope all your steam is properly blown off.
---
Yeah, I’m mid rank and it’s still a struggle for me to find matches as survivor or killer.
---
Ight I'm my defence I was doing the "hook the obsession 10 times" challenge (hence the fact I was using furtive chase), I got ~9 downs that game but only hooked the one time I got my obsession (a blendette that I found hiding exactly where you think a blendette would be hiding) at like one gen left
---
If i hear something near a box im checking it
---
Look at my comment
---
It definitely is
---
I play both sides right now but I'm a killer main. I've had killers be unable to get kills (usually Wraith) because their killer isn't good for pressuring gens. I don't blame killers for running NOED because you make one mistake it can possibly cost you the whole game if you aren't a meta killer or Leatherface. I mostly run NOED in case someone lives past hatch being closed so I don't have to waste my time being looped and if I get against one of those SWFs (I have before). I can usually 3k or 4k before the gates are powered tho.
---
Yep, in the last dev stream.
---
Sometimes it's more satisfying

---
How often does that happen?
---
Eh, it’s more like sliding through space and time than ripping holes through space and time.
---
it begins with "re" and ends with "tard"
---
um. yeah okay. 
---
Its 100% going to be fixed, but i mean, it is 2 easy kills.
---
and you can bait it, or wait for the survivor to die LMAO
---
It obviously depends on the rank you are, the killer you play and the survivors you get, but I’d say around 1/4 games has at least one person being toxic
---
That's what I meant by not being able to de-rank in ranks 20-17. I don't know how your friend got to 18 but still he is not 20 even though he has not played in a long time.

If I hear/see somebody on a box and there’s no other survivors around, why wouldn’t I down them? It’s free map pressure, which is something you need as pig.

They didn't make up "Ghost Face" either. Really, I would like to know what his name "should" be instead.

That’s not lag. That’s the hook tech. It works on console too and has nothing to do with lag. Cause you know...there’s someone on the hook....

You have to understand how game development really works.  There are certain kinds of work that you can scale optimally.  Art is one of them, that's why you see a constant stream of new cosmetics.  The other thing that you can do to scale is increase the number of platforms that DBD is available on.  Which is why you see a PC, Xbox, Playstation, Wii, and mobile dead by daylight.  However, programming requires precision.  One syntax error can make it so the game crashes on start-up.  This means that the number of programmers that can work on a specific build is limited.  Generally no more than 5 programmers per platform.  And the programmers have to be in constant communication to make sure that they're all on the same page.  Then there are 2 additional groups.  The designers/programmers/artists who make new characters and the designers/programmers/artists that modify existing characters.  These are just guesses, but I'd say there are probably about 12 programmers who work on the different ports, 3 programmers who work on new content, 3 programmers that work on existing content, 3 programmers that work on networking/servers.  So all in all, the individuals that make changes account for just 10 percent of their workforce.  And that's an optimal number, getting more programmers would not be helpful.
---
Has nothing to do with connection

Just saw it. Feel kind of stupid for not thinking of traps like that. I'm new to pig so i don't know a lot of her strats yet
---
So what you are saying is that my assumption of not being able to de-rank in ranks 20-17 is false? Which means  [this](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank#Pip_Conditions) is false?
---
I say this so often. But really I love the game. Sometimes it's just very frustrating...

the answer is STBFL always STBFL

The extended scene where they catch the kid’s soul and put it into the nerf blender again would be perfect for Legion
---
lmao sure buddy
---
Probably a stupid question but what is the hook tech? I heard about it on otz’s stream but I don’t know what it is.
---
I liked it better when I could use it on a slugged Ally to punish a sweaty killer slugging for the 4k. I never got mad when it happened to me considering they're extremely situational and tough to pull off. And the styptic agent is just depressing now. It's only 10 seconds of BT and that's it. Pretty much useless unless you've got a challenge to fully deplete medkits
---
Myers all the way!
---
It’s called the hook tech. It’s possible on console too. You know there’s a whole human on the hook right??? 🤣
---
A Dethklok meme? Sign me up
---
If you use nvidia card you can use freestyle and have a brighter setting for those maps. Then all u gotta do is press alt+F3 and choose the preset you made. I do that and before the 360 ends and match starts my brightness is set. Easy peasy.
---
he is talking about the lag at the end
---
Got team viewer ?
---
are u dumb? did u even watch the end?
---
Someone did an Oopsi.
---
What lag
---
Also if they do that Mori change, they should add new Mori animations as a cosmetic like apex legends has with their finishers
---
Sigh...
---
I don't see that being possible against Myers
---
Yes it ends with bill jumping through a window so what?
---
Because you went straight back for him instead of going after the person who unhooked him or applying pressure to the other survivors on gens. Ignoring everything else in the game to go straight back for that guy is still tunnelling dude, and unless both of the other survivors were already dead, it wasnt even your best play.
---
This is incorrect.
---
I play both sides equally, and 90% of my Daily Rituals are for killer. I differentiate killers so I play everything and I play survivor just as much.
---
Word of mouth, just like everyone else who made it. You also have to be good at what you're playing.
---
the basement itself promotes camping.
---
So positive. LMAO.
---
I wish them 2020 as positive as their shitty servers
---
You've gotta be trolling, dude haha
---
Damn, that's forbidden now, too?
---
You're not alone.  Something is strange right now with matchmaking.
---
Did you not read the post? I was patrolling gens and i saw him at the box. It wasn't even out of the way
---
*A B S O R B*
---
Its funny when some dickhead tries doing it, then the killer just stands there camping you because some idiot wanted to showoff.
---
Might as well just suicide on hook to deny the shithead the points.
---
As a killer you want one of two things to happen quickly (can't give you an exact amount of time sorry), either you hit them or they drop a pallet. Specifically, you want them to drop a pallet that you must break, because that means that the area is much more dangerous for them going forward. I would say unless it's one of the two or three god pallets on a map, you want this to happen within fifteen to twenty seconds. Even then, if you can have someone loop you through three solid pallets it's fine to then break off to delay the gen that you just got brought to (or in your case teleport somewhere).
---
I can't speak for Freddy since I just don't play him, but for traps you want to be thinking about what your goal is. Like I play hag, and so sometime when I set a trap it's to force a survivor to drop a pallet early or take a hit. Other times I really want them to get hit and so put more time into set up. Freddy slows people down, so you think about where they are going and what the map situation is like where them slowing down helps you.
---
There’s also splinters for bubba, oinkers, and Myers
---
Oh it's so great to be sneaky, find the gen jockey first and trap them. Then sneak and find the others on gens while the gen jockey is searching boxes

So you want to choose a Phobia that has a negative effect on the survivor for an extra perk slot? Dunno about that one.
---
If we’re going off that then people in dire times muster up the courage to fight back against the odds to protect and get everyone out alive. Trust dude you should really just stop thinking about how this game should be realistic and just focus on it being a fun game. Yes at times it can suck but still better than saying killers should be an unstoppable force due to realism or that getting hooked should weaken and basically kill the survivor it ain’t worth the headaches man
---
Ah, that first time is so memorable. Although I will say the difficulty has changed a bit. Back when I started playing, at least 2 gens had to be finished for the final survivor to get the hatch, and the killer could grab you out of it instead of closing it. I think my first *dying state* hatch escape that wasn’t a killer being nice, and me actually finding it by chance, was even more of a rush. I hope you’re enjoying the game!
---
If you don’t want one you don’t need to equip it.
---
It's a token that lets you play the Nightmare (Freddy) for a game. He doesn't have any addons or perks, but it's mesnt to allow you to try a new killer without buying them.
---
It’s to make you want to buy the dlc
---
i want young ash so badly :(

or suit ash, that'd also be good

I already own him...

Well it doesn’t help that you are playing Doctor who in my opinion is one of the weakest killers.

Any chance you’d say who it was so we can avoid them?

Some love? Are you serious? He’s already way less fun to play since they made him easy mode with the wraith cube. Just get better with him instead of asking devs to make him even more easy and less fun to play.
---
Ahh. Skimmed over it sorry. Gotcha.
---
I did read the post. Patrolling gens means dick all if you dont provide us information about what you saw while patrolling them.
---
You can't derank past a certain point via not earning enough emblem points each match
---
However if someone doesn't play for several montha in row, then on the 13th for every month they would keep getting pushed back in rank.
---
They recently just changed this to be less drastic, so that you only get set back a single 'color'of rank (grey/brown/yellow/green/purple/red). 
---
So even now you could still get back to rank 20 from Rank 1, but it would take a helluva long time.

That’s my secret cap, I’m always hungry.

Yeah these people legit on fucking airplane mode lol
---
Dick all? I saw nothing ^
---
Looks terrifying
---
I guess it's just sad when I'm going against a pig and I get off the hook and I go to take it off and this bitch is just following only me the whole time and spends the entire game trying to kill only me and everyone else gets out just because they were chasing a survivor already in peril
---
Steve when hes gets hooked: *AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa**^(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)*
---
What I've seen in my matches as Pig that usually the boxes another player got their party hats off at another hat won't get off at that one. If 3 boxes were already used, the 4th box is usually the definite one.
---
I don't run any addons and the only slowdown perk I run is Ruin because I don't have my usual Pig build right now because I've been prestiging her. When I run my usual build (no slowdown perks at all) I can get kills pretty easily. I'm probably just good at stealth killers because I don't get kills as quickly when I'm Leatherdaddy or Trappy Wappy.
---
The killers that I main or have gotten against a lot (Nurse, Billy, Leatherface, Ghostface, Pig,  and Trapper) I loop t byhe best.
---
PC
---
Fun little fact, Wraith was buffed in a total of 12 different patches (without counting bug fixes that made him better) and nonetheless playing him without add-ons is enough to give crippling depression to the most experienced of players. Yes, Wraith with add-ons and a hit-and-run playstyle can be good. But Wraith needs his add-ons. Which is VERY bad.
---
Solution: just decrease the effectiviness of the add-ons and add the difference to the base power for the Entity's sake, it's not so hard.
---
And it gets even better when survivors decide to grief and bm right after
---
Then that, my friend, is a glitch.
---
The test is over, there's no DC ban.
---
Feng min says the gamer word
---
I am big time biased, but based on their actual character descriptions, probably Nea. She’s supposed to be stealthy and quiet, which is something horror protags seems to struggle with. 
---
Otherwise I’d say Claudette due to in-game abuse of her... skinniness. That’s what makes her hard to see right?
---
It’s definitely a killer sided. I’d say the one beating out Lerys is lab just because of how useless every pallet is on lab.
---
Welp, wasted my bp on it
---
Full group of sfw with purple flashlights and I'm toxic for camping one kill. Survivors can get fucked lmao.
---
idk why but my nose looks like a dick...i just noticed.. :D
---
I live this game, and I try to play both killer and survivor but I find myself playing more killer never the less, camping is a legitimate strategy and I feel like people forget that sometimes.
---
I've started playing Survivor because of it. Today all 6 matches I've had so fsr I've died in 4 and pip'd while not doing much. Even the match where I hatch camped I pip'd (hatch camping is bad don't do it kids). Yes the emblem system is in need of a serious rework.
---
He was 20 when he started playing again. You still derank on the 13th of every month no matter what.
---
It doesn't adjust to other killers, unfortunately, so just don't spend your bps on them.
---
Am I the only one who thinks there should be a short grace period between the animation of a killer picking up a survivor (and being unable to move or look away) and when they can be affected be flashlights like even just two seconds after the animation ends so they have a chance to look away
---
That's the thing, it's a waste of time to stand there waiting for the person to come out from behind the hook. Because the other 2 are probably doing gens.
---
Now start sprint bursting into the wall as soon as someone comes close
---
Sure let’s also pretend that survivor is now super stressful and unfair since you can’t follow the killer during a chase with an instaheal ready for your teammate.
---
Survivors already have no mither to make the game harder and they dont use it most of the time, what makes you think they will pick a phobia Over a perk slot, atleast no mither has a benefit of picking yourself up and you cant match it with other perks to make gen repair speed insanely fast.
---
The phobias wont do anything apart from giving the survivors an excuse for why they died
---
 This post will probably get buried but oh well.
---
I fucking love this. This is amazing.
---
I understand throwing more programmers at a game does absolutely nothing, but I still can't imagine what the other like..180 employees are doing. Couple people for sound design, then a QA team (lol), Community manager-type people, a couple of level designers, maybe a few creative designers for new content then. Assume the mobile team has a completely different staff, so that's like another 30 people. A few people that check for console parity, a few people that compile the patches and send them to steam / PSN, etc. Then what? 120 artists?
---
I'm not trying to put them on blast or anything. I'm genuinely ignorant of why that many people are needed for a game with updates as slow as DBD.
---
Well if they’re flat out tunneling you then I can understand, but sometimes you just happen to pass by a box and hear a survivor getting their helmet off
---
i think my SB is on Christmas Exhaustion :D
---
The guy literally said we mistakenly call The Ghost Face as Ghostface wdym
---
He is the strongest killer in dead by daylight right now. Easy to play, automatic 3 gen, able to mind game at generators, powerful at loops, built in slow down in the form of add-ons or just spending time waking up, and he's invisible beyond 32 meter range.  Even within 32 meters he's intermittently invisible.
---
Happend to me to
---
I believe there are name and shame rules on this sub.
---
The pig can throw hammers now?
---
Oooh a phobia mechanic is really cool flavorwise for the game. I like that you really tried to pin down a way for survivors to incur deficits in the theme of the game....
---
What?! Please tell me you are joking. Have you not read Claudette's lore?
---
Ohhh yeah that makes sense...
---
Don’t use that word I despise that fucking word
---
Oh the irony
---
BHVR obtained the rights to the mask, but not the actual Scream character, as they are owned separately. I'm not sure why this bothers people. "Ghostface" in the movies isn't a person, it's an identity. Really it's anyone who wears the mask. Even in the first movie he was actually 2 people. So making up a character who wears the mask and calling him Ghostface makes sense to me.
---
&gt;diversion
---
"Teabag at gate and die" the audacity and accuracy of this
---
Just came back after a small break, I stopped right after the archives final missions were released and I finished so I could do some other stuff for a bit then the holidays came etc. Came back still rank 1 killer and I was doing trash honestly and all I got was hate. I got tbagged called trash even when I wasn't being rude I just got bullied cause I was doing bad. So fuck it I'm either going right back to not playing or I'm deranking cause of the people up here. Idgaf if it's shitty I'm not here to sweat I'm here to have fun
---
Also no more treatment mode and static blast instantly ups a madness level.
---
Ruin gives you more time if they can't find it, but you know what I like more? Reliability. Ruin is better but doesn't last that long. CI gives me some breathing room and makes finding people and setup  easier. CI simply doesn't it job every time and that is what I really need the most.
---
I wear the new assistant outfit  with bloody face, her bloody clothes and hallowed hair, or just the new ultra rares with bloody face
---
I know we all say streamers are people too and deserve to be treated as such but as a streamer I hold myself to a higher standard and all streamers should I think. If its 5 or 5000 people watching you,you have to remember that your actions and attitude are going to be watched and emulated and used as justification for other peoples actions.
---
Hopefully you can get an accurate-looking toolbox prop
---
I think it is fun idea tho
---
well it's not like that for either side, unless you're so hyper focused on always having the perfect win and think anything less than that is a loss and means the game is unfair.
---
No it doesn't. Be kind to yourself now :p
---
Cause you have to deal with getting bullied to do that
---
You do t have to camp the basement at all. Just run Iron Grasp with Agi, you can almost definitely bring everyone to basement pretty easily. It's how I got it done.
---
If they really want to punish consistent dcs then a lower priority queue wouldnt hurt.
---
Cute, but I have the feeling you’re going to blow up a gen and sprint halfway across the map...
---
This looks awesome! You make a really authentic Meg!
---
Killers can’t pick up a downed survivor if you’re healing them, so you can stall by forcing them to hit you
---
Lord forgive me for I’m about to sin.
---
You can do whats easy, or you can do whats right. If you confuse the two, there's no telling what you become. -close quote from this perks description
---
And one of the most boring and frustrating killers to vs. He’s getting a rework because of how frustrating he is to vs.
---
You acted friendly and noncompetitive as a ruse to make your opponents stop trying to win. That's considered cheap in any sport or game as far I know, so the survivors are entirely correct in being salty about it.
---
This guy gets it
---
r/okbuddydaylight
---
No I've edited preferences on the engine.ini file
---
Nurse for looping/gen rushing, wraith with windstorm add-ons for gen rushing, spirit for loops/chases
---
is this a shitpost?
---
 He's trying to improve himself. He's started gardening and he's working on a book right now
---
Understandable, it looks gorgeous btw :)
---
Turn off chat and messaging then.
---
Maybe the Trapper?
---
The map with 22 safe pallets and survivors DC? Yike.
---
Lmao. hITbOxeS. I can’t believe how much people I’ve talked to on Xbox about the “hitboxes” thru the window when it’s obviously just them lagging and me hitting because I’m the host
---
Let me know if you have any criticisms!
---
Lmao baby survivor rants are so cute
---
I think the biggest problem with the challenges is that some require you to do the whole thing in a single trial, if you could stretch the hardest ones out over multiple trials then it wouldn't be as stressful or even as annoying
---
At your head lmao
---
Because none of the Phobias I suggested are near as disadvantageous as no mither. And picking yourself up isn’t that good when the killer knows that you have it. 
---
No Mither literally does nothing if there’s a killer who knows how the perk works. It’s just a disadvantage.
---
Doesn't stop in game bullying
---
I literally just explained. If BHVR got the rights to the appearance of Leatherface but not anything to do with the movies he's from, and called this new made up character "The Leather Face" we would ignore the new character and just call him Leatherface, just as we don't call him "The Cannibal" or call Freddy "The Nightmare", because they're iconic.
---
Thanks!
---
And so started the Christmas fiasco of 2019
---
Even still I'd search for whoever unhooked him because that guy still had to get the trap off so he was no threat. Why bother to put the trap on him at all if your next play was to down him again in 30 seconds?
---
He has Christmas sweater for free. It’s in his inventory already, no purchase necessary
---
Artists, Security, Human Resources, Management, Community Managers, Designers, Quality Assurance, and Data Scientists are some of the other positions.  I'd guess that about half to 2/3rds of the work force are artists.
---
It is still hell for any 110 killer; and an infinite for anything slower.
---
Okay but again it’s not a mistake to call DBD Ghostface as Ghostface. No one is calling him Scream Movie Ghostface we’re calling him Ghostface because his name is Ghostface lol.
---
I've always seen treatment as extremely survivor sided. There is a bit of RNG involved but a few close generated windows could mean an instant loss for the killer. I don't think I've ever seen treatment side with the killer. It's either neutral or fucks over the killer.
---
If I'm right, it's when a survivor goes under a hooked survivor, using the hooked survivor as a sort of shield. Basically all the killer can do is wait, because if they hits the hooked survivor, they're on cool down and can't do anything, leaving the survivor to be able to unhook and run away.
---
Don’t be discouraged. Yes, reading the challenges on paper can seem daunting, but honestly a lot of the challenges can be completed easily. Some of the survivor ones are even easier in SWF. Some of the killer ones can promote scummy play, but the tome will be over soon. Plus there’s always more scum to dodge; at least now we have an idea of what’s to come and how to plan accordingly. Also, farming is not the worst time. Sometimes I play killer and farm just because I feel like it. It’s nice to have a game where no one is sweating or anything and everyone gets points, too. Either way, these tomes are totally feasible, and I wish you good luck in your future attempts to complete them!
---
Mirio Togata approves.
---
We're mostly agreeing, but they didn't call him Ghostface. They called him Jed/Danny. His title is "The Ghost Face", they didn't have the rights to "Ghostface". His title should have been "The Actor"
---
The point is we call original killers by their title, but licenced killers by their name. Ghostface would be the "name", the identity of the licenced killer, but they didn't get that. So he's Danny - The Ghost Face, like Freddy Krueger - The Nightmare
---
i run ruin, bbq, enduring and spirit furty its generic i know but on t3 getting the hit after spirit fury is just a free down hard to ignore
---
The challenges are dog shit
---
Change my mind
---
But MOOOOOM i Wanted a Key -.-
---
If you hit a survivor who is on a trap with sloppy butcher, will they gain the effects?
---
Reading the comments around here makes me feel like not playing and I don't know why.
---
Because they're nerfing top tier killers without adjusting gen times. Killers deserve no nerf currently and the nurse change was completely uncalled for.
---
why is this in the controversial section lmao
---
of course i have. even my good friend who is autistic and basically terrified of people enjoys going out with me every now and then. so what from her lore says she cant enjoy herself or look pretty?
---
i just took a break for about a year and i was ranked 20 when i started up again
---
that....could be a possbility :D
---
Not at all. Have you played killer at red ranks? Do you realize how sweaty you have to be in order to just not depip against an optimal swf team?
---
I don’t like that is has to be like that on one side while as a survivor you can have a chill game so long as you’re not being tunneled. I play both killer and survivor and playing survivor is 100x less stressful. Maybe that hasn’t been your experience but I’m sure many people can relate.
---
I'm not counting Security or HR as Behavior has 500 employees, not 200. Obviously those other 300 can contain more non-game related positions. I already mentioned artists, CMs, designers, and QA.
---
If 2/3rds are artists, that means like 130 people are working on what? Three skins every couple of weeks and a survivor and killer once every 3 months? That's just absurdly slow for that amount of people.
---
you can also buy survivor perks from the shrine
---
"this actually happened"
---
Confirmed. Didn't happen.
---
I’ve only experienced it as the person on the hook though and it sucks.
---
Not to mention that they release a rework for one map every three months. I would prefer them skipping one chapter to make improvements to the base game or increase the gap between chapters because in the end if they make a new Killer that’s actually decent, they’re just gonna nerf them anyways so what’s the point.
---
There are so many problems with this person’s reasoning I don’t even know where to begin
---
Add me on steam, usernames Shadowsetp
---
What is the exposed sound?
---
Pig and wraith are two of the weakest killers in the game. Also I think you’re a bit confused about the pigs abilities
---
Your whole post is the symbol of noobie ignorance.
---
Lemme help you with this
---
Wraith is one of the weakest killers because you can loop him, sure he might get an easy hit but for him to get the second hit to down you he has to work for it.
---
Pig, yes she has stealth and traps to slow the game, but when she is crouched the killer vision is hindered by a lot of things plus the survivors can see her crouching a mile away because her model isnt small with that big ass head, the traps are more useless now than they were before because of the EGC (end game collapse)
---
The one that throws "hammers" a.k.a HATCHETS is the Huntress mah dude, i suppose you got confused because the guy with the huntress was using the pig cosmetic
---
The Hag is one of the easiest killers to loop because of her lower speed, for her traps you can just crouch past them and they wont trigger or use a flashlight to burn them (BTW talking about burning you can burn the wraith before he uncloaks stunning him)
---
You'll get used to the totem placements with experience, they always appear in distinct places, for now try looking around for them and memories where theu spawned after a while you'll find them instinctly.
---
Survivors have it easy in this game, atleast if you know what you are doing. Thats why in the low ranks killers are OP because even if the killer makes a mistake the survivors dont know how to take advantage of that. But on high rank killers make a mistake well they're fucked boom 2 gens pop BOOM 3 more pop BOOM game over.
---
Both Moris and Keys need a rework since theyre both unfair as fuck
---
&gt; And the killer agreed with me.
---
I'll do this to rile up survivors in my lobby. If the killer actually agreed, they would have let you crawl out.
---
Yet that game is dead xD player base barely tops 1k
---
You don't need an add on to have the terror radius cover the whole map there
---
probably because that isn't the main issue here. everyone knows legion should've broke pallet after, but the video was showcasing how the perk stops legion from vaulting the pallet, which is obnoxious and unnecessary.
---
I forgot to mention that he wasn't being sarcastic at all.
---
I stream on twitch as gzmo12 p3 pig. Feel free to tune in sometime! 
---
A lot of the time her charge is slower than just standing up and survivors dont see it coming.
---
Your crouch is great for mind gaming around loops! 
---
Dont burn your traps early in the match! While it's great for slowing down early game if you cant steamroll you will be in trouble!
---
When crouched and heading towards a gen walk backwards or sideways to fuck with spine chill 
---
Current perk build I'm having a blast with is ruin,enduring,spirit fury,and discord 
---
People love to boop a snoot and the reaction to a pallet blowing up and amanda raising up super fast is priceless! Discord is amazing for finding survs and ruin is well ruin but I might swap it for corrupt intervention and maybe take bbq over discord mainly for the bps
---
Like I said feel free to pop into stream with any other questions &lt;3
---
I don't do them, However people that are throwing 15 pallets in a row to do a challenge against red rank killers make my games shit. Survivors being way to altruistic bum rushing hooks also ruins my games as killer.
---
Whatever you say :)
---
Thats alright, my dick looks like a nose.
---
Yeah ppl will cry about anything
---
Starting with the first killer, Noice
---
Ok then never learn other killers you may enjoy and purposely derank by just idling then. Clearly he doesnt want to play at red ranks
---
Most battle passes you can do multiple challenges at a time though so you don't have to go into a match saying "I NEED to drop 15 pallets in a chase" but "oh I have to drop a few more pallets and open a chest and do a gen"
---
Who cares nerd
---
I like Lery's and The Game but I'm not a big fan of Hawkins, it just feels too easy as killer
---
Oh- I never really thought about that. That's pretty lame but understandable. I hope they find a way around it. You can always use splinters, after all
---
I see, I see. Well, thanks for answering. So many questions to this game! Man..but it is fun sometimes though, when I just dont get stomped and teabagged as a killer or not downed and hooked multiple times within the first minutes as a survivor xD
---
Alright, I will keep that in mind! I hate that perk though, holy moly im so bad against it. And a gen that usually takes like what, 1ish min, now takes 2-3 years xD
---
In dbd ghostface is in his twenties.
---
Oh, thank you,  I didn't know that
---
Unfortunate. Had this happen, but got out with a grab on a toxic, cocky survivor. Any who, I think the issue that this glitch stems from is having two traps placed within close proximity of one another. Sad to see that this bug is still a thing. Though, the devs appear to be slow on every bug, both killer and survivor.
---
I mean if you're good it isn't hard to depip unless you're actually just losing or camping or just brought a Mori.
---
Besides how is this an argument about which side is chill? Your main point was saying how all the killers got nerfed, I just said survivors had changes to so don't act like BHVR is being biased. Especially since most of those killers you mentioned are still in a good spot.
---
If you don't have the pass I would suggest taking a 9 day break because at the moment it is a shitfest.
---
&gt; since I don’t play as killers
---
Don’t worry we can tell
---
ZA WARUDO!
---
Apparently a lot of people.
---
Aww... I remember when I too was a noob. Don't worry, there's this dude in the comments who out a bunch of really good advice. Go listen to him.
---
I like both games but friday has been dead ever since the whole lawsuit &amp; we never got Jason X. That's when I stopped having interest in it. I got it on the switch &amp; started playing it again but i don't play as much as I do Dead by Daylight. I only agree kinda with what he said bout the community. Our community can be brutal &amp; for no reason. But overall, it's more fun.
---
BHVR works extremely fast, not slow.  You're expectations vs reality are completely at odds.  Making even one skin is probably the labor of love for 3 - 5 artists over the period of a month.
---
Great design when that's basically the only way to do it without an afk killer or insane luck.
---
I ruse I would never fall for.  Because I'm not nieve enough to believe serial killers, and monsters have my best interests at heart.  I'd be angry at myself if I fell for that.  Not the killer.
---
&gt;  Shadowsetp
---
Mine is Lievrehare
---
a few tips 
---
Against Thanathophobia you have to heal yourself and team - the more injured in the match the stronger perk is.
---
Jake has a perk 'Small Game" helps to find hexs - they have repetitive respaws.  
---
Wright is fast when he is invisible because he is not so fast unclocking - he must have a chance to catch you.  
---
Hag's traps, you can destroy with a flashlight and she has a limited number of them. You do not activate them when you crouch.
---
20 hours is really little time for this game, with time comes experience and you will see that the kilers are not OP at all :)
---
They need to wilt the corn so you have to croutch to be hidden by it at least.
---
Pallethaven wreckers just needs less safe loops and probably less pallets overall
---
what would you change about Haddonfield?
---
See, you keep saying that, but I'm pointing out why what he said contradicts that and disagreeing with you.
---
His name isn't Ghostface. It's Danny. Freddy's name isn't "The Nightmare"
---
In game it does nothing. we are talking about the overall usefulness of perks. wglf has a use.
---
If you have deliverance and adrenaline. If the last gen pops and you get off the hook will you be injured or healed
---
Exactly
---
I keep reading this as BORTLES in Jason's voice from The Good Place lol
---
He shows narcissistic tendencies and is a complete sociopathic psychopath. He shows no remorse for killing in fact he enjoys it and wants everyone to see it which is why he films himself/makes fotos of himself.
---
The DC penalty was actually extremely impactful and decreased DCs massively. Now that it's gone DCs are rampant, often 2-3 a game for me at Red Ranks.
---
But don't expect it back any time soon. Too many people complained about the timeouts until the bugs get fixed and with BHVR it's guaranteed the game breaking bugs will never end.
---
This is literally a moment where it was anti-tunneling
---
Their pace is still a little on the slower side by industry standards, I'd say.  Probably lack of experience I'm guessing and different priorities.   They do put a lot of effort into new platforms and other new forms of income, and less so on existing content and balance updates.  I also find a lot of their balance changes oddly considered, they seem to struggle deciding who they want to balance the game for, and how to best go about it.  BHVR still strikes me as a company still getting their development legs.  They created a massive, surprise hit they probably weren't quite ready for, and are still playing catch-up.   Let's hope they get there.
---
Something's wrong, I can feel it.
---
What OP left out is that it also makes you break pallets when you vault them, which is my favorite part about it.
---
I'd Tapp that
---
It’s massively killer sided, as are the other indoor maps
---
Lery's is by far the worst map in the game. Glad to see it's getting a rework.
---
I'm always surprised when I'm watching a streamer and they DC. It's an instant leave for me, watching a tough game is more entertaining than watching them sit in queue.
---
Hey look mr. killer man, you saw me all the way across the map when I'm right next to the gate, come chase me to it you totally have a shot of hooking me.
---
I see! Thank you for clearing up my misunderstanding.
---
Sure but you need player levels for that for which you probably ranked up a bit. But I found the answer in another comment, will edit OP
---
Pretty sure you’ll be broken, but you’ll still get the speed boost at least!
---
I'm doing the pallet challenge right now and I find that it encourages me to find the killer and lead them around dropping every pallet I see which really fucks over my teammates. I feel like if it was "drop 5 pallets while being chased by the killer" it wouldn't be a big deal but 15? My goodness.
---
Toit
---
Clown has a healthy good boy frame and loves his chicken tendies and lots of dewwie.
---
Dude what. It is NOT that hard to make a skin. I've made a few mods for games before and making spec maps, nmaps, the actual skin, and combining everything to attach properly to a model is NOT something that takes that much effort.
---
You're saying it takes an average of 4 people an entire month to make one skin. That's like 21 days of work accounting for weekends / a day off here or there. Normal 8 hour work day minimum, and youre looking at 168 hours for a SINGLE person, then multiplying that by 4 for **672** hours to make a single fucking skin? Get outta here with that.
---
Dead by Daylight is just a small part of BHVR.  Look up some of their other titles on wikipedia.  I may not agree with every choice that BHVR makes.  But on a whole, they have done very well.  It's difficult to balance a 4 vs 1 game and they've got the game to be somewhat competitive (for a game that's really meant to be a casual party game)
---
Who dis
---
The fuck is up with her hands??
---
You clearly don’t understand what he’s saying. 
---
He went to the gens, found nobody, went back, and found the guy he just hooked at the box. 
---
^ I really doubt his next play looked anything like this.
---
There's a difference between Immersed and Stealthy
---
Rank 9 gets screwed by matchmaking.  9 - 6 = 3.  Due to the large amount of survivors in red ranks and a lack of killers.....they get tossed into your lobby.   I haven't seen a  game filled with my own ranks ever since the change.  It is a non-stop train of red rank swf teams that are super salty assholes win or lose.
---
This is why we don't teabag at the exit gates
---
Blink hit five different survivors in a row without getting fatigued
---
I’m not claiming BHVR is biased. All I’m saying is that they need to figure out a way to make playing killer more fun unless they want everyone playing survivor. And nerfing killers who perform well isn’t the right way to do it. I wonder why they got nerfed in the first place. Surely not because survivor mains complained right?
---
I got something similar too, but I was hovering sideways away from the hook. Wraith had bad aim
---
good to know. I could have swore the Jake was off the ground and on his shoulders when I did it but I could have been in the window.
---
We need Kronk as a survivor
---
Let's go scoops
---
I wouldn't consider almost half the company "just a small part." I do agree they're doing pretty well, but they are still extremely slow for the amount of employees they have.
---
Anthropophobia (Teamphobia) - team 3+ survs have a 75% reduced chance to be in your queue
---
Yes, it is okay and not rude at all (from a bloodwarden user btw)
---
How is doing your objective as the killer BM... some people really don’t understand the point of the killer is to be an asshole.
---
all i hope is we don't get 5 versions of Lerys because 5 Preschools where nothing is different just buildings in different places is dull af.
---
It’s good for setup killers where you’re fucking off being immersed too, laying traps n stuff
---
I would just wait. Thats two survivors bot doing gens. One is dying and its the other survivors fault. You wont lose hook ppints got camping either because the other survivor is right there. EZ two piece
---
Yeah that's what I mean. Theres a reason why red rank survivor queues are long as fuck. No one wants to play red rank killer. It sucks ass, its more stressful than fun. And if you arent doing good it's very hard to have fun. Even when I'm losing as survivor I'm having fun, because I can loop well, and I can hit skillchecks. As killer if your getting slammed by survivors there is just no fun to be had. It's actually awful.
---
They can nerf DS when they nerf some of the insane killer perks. DS is one of very few survivor perks now that actually can change something.  DS, Adrenaline, and a few other exhaustion perks are probably the strongest stalling a killer's game perks survivors have.
---
Meanwhile killer has great perks for stalling pretty much EVERYTHING to a significant degree that a survivor can do.
---
Need help tracking? BBQ, Whispers, I'm All Ears, Nurses, etc.
---
Need help stalling generators? Ruin, Pop, Corrupt, Dying Light, etc.
---
Need help stalling healing? Nurses and Sloppy.
---
Hate items? Franklins.
---
I can get downvoted by  the community and the like, but at the end of the day?  Killer is so fucking handheld right now. If you slap on some tracking perks and stalling perks?  The only thing likely to get in your way of a 4k is a poorly designed map not a survivor perk.
---
Ahh the larva stage. Soon you will blossom into a dead hard, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, Adrenalined up  t-bagger. Give it time, friend. You will soon learn how to counter all of these. See you soon when you climb some more for a Spirit, Freddy, or Billy rant! Good luck in the fog!
---
how is it scamming when those were released in china only? it's like buying a collector's item lol ofc the price will be high
---
u wanna say it 5 more times or read the other people that already said it
---
damn my trigger finger
---
&gt; The Pig is also extremely annoying. She can **throw hammers** at you, put a trap on your head that makes you absolutely useless to your team until you find the right thing to remove it? Fuck that. No other killer has a power that renders you that vulnerable. 
---
what
---
yea bhvr seems the type to send cease and desist over copyrights
---
Need OG Ash.
---
I usually assume the survivor has dead hard and try to wait it out.
---
They really don't. I've done all of mine legit
---
You misunderstood what he was saying, it’s not picking a phobia over a perk slot, it’s picking a phobia *for* a perk slot, which is a rather interesting idea in my opinion
---
How am I supposed to know someone already said it?
---
by reading
---
pOwEr RoLe
---
stronger than me, I hit straight LOL
---
We’ve already had map reworks and Lery’s is getting reworked early 2020. So yes they will be fixed.
---
But the killers suck too yet they 4 man nearly every game.
---
tbh she still doesn't have the right nerf that she needs just make the fucking shards on her glow brighter standing still should not be a mind game
---
I deadass haven’t gone against a spirit since the nerf, which blows my mind because she is still crazy strong.

You think that I think I'm confident?  Thanks for the compliment.  
---
This community is really nice.
---
thats hentie
---
Why are you trying to argue semantics
---
Hags name isn’t Hag so why do most people call her Hag instead of Lisa? Obviously Ghostface isn’t the name he was fucking born with why are you arguing that his real name is Danny. No shit his real name isn’t Ghostface, but the Killers name is Ghostface so that’s why people call him Ghostface.
---
The guy I responded to said people mistakenly call him Ghostface when he isn’t because he isn’t the movie Ghostface. No one is talking about real life names.
---
Killer: maybe this time they forgot they have dead hard so imma swing anyway
---
*survivor uses deadhard*
---
Killer: well it was worth a shot back to looping
---
Leaksbydaylight is a mess
---
The guy that owns it has a huge ego and thinks he is superior to everyone
---
Spine chill is honestly the best survivor perk in so many ways
---
And I don't wanna DC to depip faster so I'm just doing shit on purpose as Leatherface. So survivors can enjoy their boring games where I just chainsaw pallets and only kill Dwight cuz I need his face still
---
It'd be interesting and kinda hilarious for the super fat guy to become stealthy. I even remember someone either here (might have been you) or on the discord mentioning Clown should have Oblivious somewhere in his kit. 
---
The only little problem is it might end up un-synergizing with Coulrophobia (Clown's "You heal slower in my terror radius" perk) although that's not really a new problem, since Doctor has a perk that makes his TR smaller which most doctors never use. 
---
Also I think the effect should last a second or so after leaving (Similar to Mindbreaker), otherwise survivors at the "Oblivious only when working on generator" stage can easily gen-tap to bypass it.
---
Killers always cry swf when they lose. Good survivors are good survivors, swf or not. They don't have to be in a swf to win but it's funny listening to the excuses.
---
I think that you are coming from a perspective about how other games work, and even though DbD has its balancing flaws, as you play you will begin to see how the pieces fit together
---
DbD is meant to be very punishing; the Killer is meant to be stronger and faster than you, and they have dirty tricks at their disposal to stop you even faster. The objective is not to never get injured or hurt, but to balance out the hooking and unhooking so that the generators get completed and the survivors can coordinate an escape. Even games won come with injury and hooking
---
A lot of DbD is about time management and pulling off a few things extraordinarily well rather than doing a lot of things sloppily. Good survivors use stealth to not be found in the first place, though it's usually inevitable to be found. In that case, wasting the Killer's time for the sake of the entire team being able to do more generators is usually more realistic than actually escaping a chase
---
As an individual, the Killers overpower you with strength and unfair tactics. But as a team of four survivors, as you balance doing generators and keeping the killer busy, you can lead each other to the Exit Gates
---
In any case your post was a fun read and put a smile on my face, I hope you can keep enjoying the game despite its many frustrations! After a lot of practice your instincts will guide you to victory more and more!
---
Love playing Huntress but her hatchets either hit you about three miles around a corner, or literally go straight through the survivors body. Nothing tilts me more man
---
Wow that's a self report for bug abusing that end with karma lag.........interesting!
---
Yep, he's an experienced killer who used his profession (journalist) to report on his own murders for fame.
---
At least that's what I remember
---
I do this thing, so everyone must do this thing in this situation 100% of the time.
---
That’s right lol
---
I suspect you’re underestimating what a chainsaw does to flesh and bone. A quick google search suggests it’s going to do serious damage and not break teeth nor seize the saw.
---
If I see a toxic survivor on my team I'll heal them at the exit gate and let them get hit by the killer. Fight fire with fire
---
Yeah I just bought the rest of the rift pass just for the vial
---
I got better FPS when I switched to medium settings and reduced the resolution scale to 0.
---
The only other killers that are remotely scary are when myres or demogorgon sneak up on you
---
Yeah I don't really go against spirits anymore but I play her without using stridor, to give survivors at least a little bit fair gameplay.
---
Its 2019 why people still run it
---
I see you are a man of Wraith culture too. :) I like that build idea, I just havent had the BP to dump into him yet. Still unlocking all the teachables....
---
Ive decided to just do the trapper and then the winner just to see if you like it and want more.
---
That’s true I have had michael sneak up on me the other day
---
As usual, the DBD Community is never happy.
---
It's much easier to 4k then it is to escape, and op addons like iri head huntress or mint rag hag would make it insanely easy to keep your addons. It'd be unbalanced
---
I'm a toxic nea myself but damm. She deserved that.
---
I mean if the got a "real" Ghostface, then what would they call him? Billy, Stu, Debbie, Mickey, Roman, Jill, or Charlie?
---
all the killers are, or at least were once, real people. They all have real names and so what BHVR couldn't fully license an entire character from the Scream series, but they did something unique with him that still very much fit the entire persona of ghostface in general.
---
they showed the data some time ago. It's pretty rare that you get a 3-4 swf group. And most of the time (speaking for me and my friends), we just play to have fun and not to 'destroy a killer and 'genrush'. We're just playin'.
---
Honestly, it doesn't matter if I look at the killers or survivors. Everyone is blaming the other side (or the own mates) for mistakes. Genrush because of an organised group? maybe one out of 20 games. Genrush because you failed the first chase and couldn't build up pressure properly dispite there were plenty of chances? Bingo!   
---
Same goes for survivor, their biggest mistake is wasting time. Searching for ruin, early positioning for a save, hiding super early, etc.
---
Don't get me wrong. There are a lot of unfair scenarios like wonky hitboxes, weird autoaim, bad RNG. But it's not every game and it also even itself out because it happens to both sides. 
---
Is a SWF with OoO, discord etc. fair? No.  
---
Is a top tier killer with a ton of slow down perks or NOED, with the strongest add ons and an ebony mori fair? No.
---
Is it every game like that? No.
---
I want to sometimes but I keep that for the bedroom.
---
All the nurse change did was raise the skill level required to do well with her shes still the best killer
---
"slightly"
---
I agree. You should know when she is phasing or not. Nerfs didn't solve her real problem.
---
I don’t know what that means but it feels like some sort of trap.
---
I mean, when half the dev’s can be shit on be below average players it’s to be expected that the gameplay would lack fine tuning
---
Some challenges are ok (Hooking a certain number of people across matches, unhooking people across matches, healing people, hitting people, etc) but some challenges are just stupidly hard and promote bad game mechanics. I finished the "sacrifice 4 Survivors in the Basement" challenge today and, without camping/remaining near the basement where a hooked Survivor was for 80% of the match I would've NEVER been able to do it (and I've been lucky too that no one DCed, which is another bad thing, DCs shouldn't affect chalenges that badly).
---
Legion's a toughy as his power got hurt a lot by many changes. Basically what you want to do, is use his ability to chase a bunch of survivors down and hit them to slow the game down by forcing them to mend. His ability combos particularly well with Thanatophobia and Sloppy Butcher.
---
Also no exposed will not work.
---
We have carried out an in-depth analysis of the reported comment but have found it is suitably rated.

I can see you're confident by your lack of spellcheck. Honor or honour*

Depending on the quality it may be more than 672 hours.  Did you need to create a new material, which requires creating a shader, what about things like hair physics or material physics like Dwelfs hat, Animations or Amandas Skins which have animations sound effects special shaders, etc. Now most skins are probably going to be under 100 hours.  But some of the more crazy skins like Dwelf or many of the killer cosmetics could have taken more than 1000 hours to make.
---
First let me say that this looks great. The detail and shading are fantastic. If I can only offer one critique without coming off as a jerk or trying to diminish the fantastic work in any way, for my tastes there’s something that feels too “soft” about him here.
---
This Freddy almost looks cuddly or friendly? If that makes sense.
---
If you do another Freddy I’d love to see just a more sinister glint in his expression. A bit more of a scowl or sneer in his lips. 
---
Again, I hope I’m not coming off like a jerk. Because I truly do think this is great and you’ve got exceptional talent. None of my art would ever come close to this, and I’ve rarely made a halfway decent Fred.
---
Perks fit play styles so they’re all personal preference
---
Defending toxic shit and stereotyping countries. Classy.
---
Not to be a bragger/asshole but I didn’t farm once and I got them all done. The complete 4 gens challenge was a pain
---
It's true. The only thing that makes his power good is when he can moonwalk to kill a survivor, otherwise he's bad. Thy need to rework his power
---
I like to use feral frenzy and run back and forth in front of the gate. It feels good. Sometimes I know they’re waiting on me but I’m having too much fun vaulting pallets.
---
You're talking about tips that tell you when to but a button. You don't think it would be confusing at all if the UI didn't just have the normal tips, but also text bubbles filling the screen too?
---
And like I said, this is just another example of avoiding a real solution, like just adding voice chat, that would actually fix the problem.
---
They're all passive challenges that dont matter.
---
Because you're not getting any tangible from all this, it just makes people stressed and angry because they're so obsessed with getting those *precious* challenges.
---
I just looked up the lore on YouTube and now if I get a challenge done, that's great. If not, whatever I already saw the rewards.
---
Battle of the stalky bois
---
Bad killers
---
How am I the one arguing semantics? You keep changing what you're confused about to ignore the very, very simple point. We're not talking about REAL names, we're talking about IN GAME names. The game doesn't call him Ghostface. It calls him "Danny - The Ghost Face" because they only had rights to the mask, so he's an original killer based on a licenced killer. The Hag isn't a licenced killer. We're talking about licenced Killers.
---
As simple as can be. His point is that the odd one out here is stupid and was easily avoidable.
---
Name - Title - What most people call them - Are they called that in game Y/N?
---
Leatherface - The Cannibal - Leatherface - Y
---
Freddy - The Nightmare - Freddy - Y
---
Micheal Myers - The Shape - Micheal - Y 
---
DANNY JOHNSON - THE GHOST FACE - Ghostface - N
---
Its bc they didnt fix her, if you dont have iron will, you are dead.
---
I somewhat agree. You can't stop the farming tho- There are some lazy asses out there and that's alright. It also sucks that the 4-man-basement-time-challenge can be interrupted by a lucky hatch spawn. 
---
I wish there would be more perk-related challenges to promote certain combos and an interesting playstyle. Like using Spine Chill and Resilience for the extra vaulting speed! Or combine bloodhound with sloppy for juicy blood puddles.
---
people care about those a lot
---
Confusing? No. Not at all. And “filling the screen”? I think it’s clear by your response that you’re not understanding what I’m saying and voice chat is the hill you want to die on. Voice chat wouldn’t fix the problem, it would make things much worse. Have a happy new year ❤️
---
What in gods name
---
true
---
And if you ask a question ("Is X thing legit? Some dude was talking about it last match.") they get all pissy at you.
---
You have to conceptualize them, get the approval, modelize, tweak, texturize, put on some physics on the materials, tweak, tweak, and tweak again, and even then you might have to scrap it.
---
Skins are subject to marketing decisions AND licensing for the licensed characters.
---
It's still quite a lot of work to put in.
---
nah fam. just cuz the game did something bullshit doesn't mean i don't get my points
---
You'll have to talk to my phone about that.  Thank you for caring enough to tell me.  God bless you.
---
Yea well survivors get the golden pass of releasing with broken mechanics and it staying that way on release, damn they get everything. Even though Ash, Adam, and Yui all had perks nerfed instantly after coming out, and overall survivors have had an awful perk lineup the past half a dozen chapters.
---
BHVR is working towards balancing the game, sure not everything is going to be on point, but they are actively tweaking all aspects of the game, albeit slowly, to better balance it. Idk what more you want unless it's to just leave killers alone because they are 100% perfect with no faults at all and just nerf survivors? Let's also not pretend that Freddy, Spirit, Nurse, and even Oni aren't all still capable killers able to dominate matches along with a couple other killers.
---
Killer is fun, in my opinion more fun than survivor at times due to solo survivor hell. Sorry you can't find fun in the game. Try Civilization
---
I skipped over the flashlight saves because I just can’t do it. When I’m playing killer and it’s obvious the survivors are struggling, I’ll make it easy for them to do a flashlight save. Sometimes it feels like your elderly aunt is trying to take you pic and you have to just stand there until she figures it out.
---
I tend to get connected to a match as a Survivor within 4-7 minutes. The longest time it took me to get into a match was around 10 minutes I think, and that's because I was playing at 3am. 
---
Killer matches on the other hand? Prepare to wait up to an hour to get people to play with you.
---
its a fucking game not an encouragement camp. no1 is responsible with anyones fun. if you wanna do some shit like bringing ds and hide in lockers whenever the killer is near your ass or stuff like that and t bag him and flashlight click him thats fine. you can do that. it should be up to the players in the game to respond to stuff they dont enjoy. im so bored of this discouraging peolpe from using stuff shit. lots of people stop doing dickhead stuff on their own u just let them have their round at it. facecamping is only fun for like 3 games. same for noed same for tunneling. playing the game a bunch of hours teaches you that the game is all about fun so go do whats fun to do. just stop fucking policing everything and everyone
---
Dangit I forgot to read that post. Thanks for reminding me of it!
---
Oh good! I'm guessing it's just my ass connection. Thats a shame, I really wanted to try the new Oni dude
---
Let me tell you about the Doctor
---
In comparison to how survivor sided A LOT of maps are it's absolutely "slightly" killer sided.

great tips though
---
I doubt having it as "Ghost Face" instead of "Ghostface" is to get around any licensing issues. This discussion made me curious so I looked up the original scripts, and in the first movie they are referred to as "GHOST," "GHOST FIGURE," and "GHOST MASKED FIGURE." He is called "Mr. Ghostface" by a victim and that's it. In Scream 2, he is referred to once as "the Ghost Face" in the script and never in the dialogue. There is one mention of men in "Ghostface costumes." In Scream 3 he is simply named "The GHOST." All of the merchandise is labeled as "Ghost Face."
---
So I played a game and then it went back to normal. Kinda a weird bug tho xd
---
Right now, I'm doing the stupid one with This isn't Happening. Not only do I have to find the killer to get injured, I then also have to escape their grasp and find a gen, praying that there is no Ruin because if there is, the greats won't count for some fucking reason. Then, I'm that asshole groaning on a gen, desperately trying to land greats when normally I just go for good, ignoring everything around me =\_= I normally play relatively altruistically with a gen jockey/unhook build, so needless to say: **this sucks.** I literally got killed on my 5th great once and almost had a break down because I was SO CLOSE.
---
Combine this with a lovely bug I have where I can't do the key challenge, and I've had a pain in the ass time trying to fucking complete the archive.
---
Haha
---
I agree, but his point was the naming convention, not the lore. He could have been any of them or a new killer, but his name should have been Ghostface and his title should have been something else. 
---
Leatherface isn't called "The Leather Face", we would have called him Ghostface anyway, because that's his iconic name, so making him "Danny - The Ghost Face" is just stupid.
---
It's the great equalizer.
---
We all become just as miserable as each other.
---
I've had this happen except the killer was afk the whole game and i was standing on the hatch and the last other dude waited to leave till the last second to leave so i died right as the hatch opened. and thats my story of how an afk killer sacrificed me
---
&gt;Lithe pauses while you're falling. 
---
So Balanced Landing, 2.0?
---
I'm a man of extremes, little overkill can't go astray
---
10 days later:Still immortal huh trapper?
---
*shrugs*
---
Not if you'd only lucked into a single kill.
---
Why TF didn't the nurse just smack you guys or go around?
---
You should be able to
---
It's fantastic for stealth killers, especially scratched mirror Mikey. You see them, they cant see you hear you.
---
"My phone totally goes against basic smart text programming and uses obscure words like honer instead of honor/honour even though I can see the word before I hit send. As well as other non words like nieve, which is a name not a word." Classic!
---
I know but its annoying.
---
This happens sometimes when a survivor disconnects during the hook.
---
Toxic cause they completed a gen and cleansed both the killers Hex perks?
---
I just got ghostface so...
---
Legion’s gimmick is time management. Essentially you want to use your power to stab, find another survivor, stab, and repeat unto you can’t find anyone else. You would chase normally on the last survivor( or current one with no one else around). The survivors have to waste time mending, while you are trying to chase one of their friends, and that’s about it.
---
The problem with legion, is that he doesn’t have a lot of “power” in the game. That is, he can’t really down anyone, only hurt them, and needs map coverage perks. You’d want perks that compliment that play style (thanataphobia, corrupt intervention, etc) and force survivors over to you side, and slow down the game with each hit on the survivor.
---
All about time and managing it effectively.
---
Bill is good for a different play style and a few really good perks
---
I agree but I don't really see people disconnect against a god-like nurse. Personally I wouldn't disconnect against spirit even though she is boring to go against.
---
Honestly. It makes you sound like you're right next to him.
---
So unless you were already in the TR, it's obvious whats happening.
---
Lmao you are right. I got 4k in my 1st match perkless and add onless but i feel like turning in demon dash is poor garbage
---
Are you sure you weren't just using the Ethereal Hatchets add-on?

they should just let us select 3 challenges at a time so we can complete them simultaneously, then there would probs be less farming bc you could choose a gen challenge, a hook challenge and a chase challenge, and you’ll probs do a bit of each!
---
How do you even set the trapa so close to each other in the first place?
---
Okay I was wrong about the Pig throwing hammers apparently. Some killer does, right? Clearly, I didn't fact check this and I'm addressing some  \~pro gamer bois\~ so I have to be careful. There are a lot of meanies in the comments and I'm feeling really uncomfortable. I put myself in a very vulnerable angle and some of y'all are bullies.
---
I really appreciate the helpful comments. I was expecting a fair balance in the game, but I'm now understanding that it's supposed to be kind of unfair for the survivors. It makes sense.
---
Thank you for the helpful comments and I'll make sure to read all of them! I'm learning, guys.
---
I also believe this is incorrect because 99% of my matches are killers and 90% of my daily rituals are killer
---
What did she say in the post-game chat? If anything at all? Lmao
---
Because even before this game, every calls Myers ss Michael Myers, Freddy as Freddy, Leatherface as Leatherface, and Ghostface as Ghostface. The game absolutely calls him Ghostface it’s literally the name of the Killer (again NOT THE IDENTITY) and the name of the DLC. It doesn’t even say “The Ghost Face” on the DLC just Ghostface. 
---
I’m not confused about anything, or “changing” anything.
---
Wow that plauge was definitely on something
---
Some people base their ego/pride on playing this game like an “honorable survivor/killer” and don’t get that a lot of the early game, at least 120 or so hours are spent grinding blood points for teachables anyway. Goes a lot faster with some freebies every now and again.
---
What's stressful is having to spam the game over and over once you have no challenges left to get the last 20-ish levels.
---
Devs can alter achievements all they want on Xbox, remember it being a selling point for the One, and I've seen it a few times.
---
Meg or Laurie
---
Sloppy is usually applied through basic attack. As long as you hit them with a basic attack, it should be applied.
---
its bc you can at least try to out mindgame a god nurse, it feels interactive, but with spirit its just a guessing game constantly
---
Watch the whole clip, it teleported me back to the billy
---
Don’t be bias. There are unbalanced maps on both sides.
---
That frontgrab was extra juicy
---
Last swf points me out to the killer and i lose a red map and the killer gives him the hatch. So i sent the video to the devs and reported to xbox along with them admitting with the killer via msgs that they did.
---
Why do we not have the option to be in a lobby with swf groups?
---
Not my idea of fun.
---
 P.s if options were available that would rock. I am sure some would opt in but more would opt out of swf matches. It blows to be on the outs before the match even starts. There are way more negatives to swf matches then positives from what i have seen. Agree or disagree?
---
Well I wasn't sure if you were trolling but thanks for clarifying. I never said anything about nerfing survivors yet you keep bringing it up. I can see that you play mostly SWF and I can see why. Let's just agree to disagree budd.
---
Oh, thanks for notice - even better, can pick already without leveling character. 
---
I don't know why, but SG suited me with Jake perfectly :p
---
Me: doesnt run prove thyself because teammates are boosted and cant hit ruin skillchecks so two people on a generator are usually worse than one
---
It's not, it's been stylized as both. The point is still that the "The ____" is not meant to be their name, but their title. So by DBD's logic his name is Danny - The Ghost Face which makes him the odd one out. 
---
We call Bubba - The Cannibal Leatherface because that's what we know him as, we would have called, say, Luke - The Actor (The guy who plays Ghostface in Stab) Ghostface anyway. 
---
It's the same as calling "Jimbo - The Leather Face", it would be stupid.
---
No I definitely understand what he's saying.
---
Stone cold, I love it.
---
Didn't even barf the gen.
---
Don't forget, on hit perks don't work on him anymore. Things like Sloppy or STBFL
---
Bc there hadn't been a flashlight in the game up until that point. So I didn't have a reason to be careful
---
I mean there are two sides to it. People want to play with their friends. And they don’t deserve ridiculous queue times. But I am not having fun playing killer agains non-stop sweat squads. I dunno what the answer is but separate queues would just worsen already terrible wait times.
---
Damn those dirty SWF for not wanting to deal with brain-dead, urban evading Claudette’s in solo queue. Fuck them. Toxic assholes.
---
January 2nd
---
Stealth is one thing. Playing the entire match fully immersed is another. Good killers won't waste time trying to find fully immersed survivors and it leaves them free to patrol gens and apply map pressure. Committing to chases waste killers time therefore learning to loop is generally better for the team + more points for you if you can win chases but most people who hide all the time can't run a killer for shit when they get found.
---
It's more about knowing when to be stealthy. People who play the game immersed are frustrating to have on the team because they generally are too scared to do much, they don't commit to gens when they are about to be done because they urban away the second there is a heartbeat, slowly go for hook saves which can lead to first hook struggles etc. Infact most of them hit crouch the second they have control and never let it go. 
---
That being said stealth does have its place, it's a matter of doing it at the right time.
---
thats fair.
---
jake is the survivalist and is rather stealthy
---
https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/nieve
---
Ok.
---
To caveat off of what some of them said, it's typically acceptable, especially if it really was a GG WP for all of them. If the killer got destroyed, it could actually be bad in some cases if not most as the killer might feel like they're getting a pity party. I'm sure most killers who get destroyed would rather you just leave.
---
P.S. Not attaching a negative connotation to 'destroyed' to imply the killer sucks. Sometimes good killers can get outplayed, and I'm sure they'd rather you just leave.
---
Just thought you were a shag rug under the gen
---
It happens to me almost every time I’m hooked. It’s not always so far away from the hook, but often just to the side or a little lower so the hook goes through my characters face...
---
That’s most likely not why, he’s not wrong but I doubt that’s the reason. You still lose rank if you DC by any other means except by pressing esc and leaving game. If you press esc and leave game you won’t go below rank 16, alt+f4 and all other ways you will derank below 16. You get way more P3 50+++ survivors at rank 20 then you do at rank 16. This will stop once they put in the DC penalty (hopefully).
---
Lucky you. I was playing survivor earlier and we were all rank 2 and got a rank 16 lol
---
This sub in a nutshell. Gets 4k and complains it wasn't easy enough.
---
I’m not a fan of his walking animation when he’s carrying someone, looks silly his stride is really small.
---
Wait times i can handle. I see no negatives to giving options.
---
They're all the way down there, straight tot the boiler room of hell...only some of them though, Others are kind
---
Try a different killer. I play Spirit at Rank 1 against God loopers who mastered 360s and still get 3ks at worst every game.
---
hot chip
---
I added that so if you activate Lithe from a rushed window vault that goes directly into a fall, you aren't loosing any Haste. While this would make it similar to Balanced Landing in that specific scenario, please tell me how that would make Lithe better than Balanced Landing.
---
The balance shifts as you climb. For newer players the killers are unstoppable. For seasoned survivors the killers are kittens. It takes time man. This game has a surprising amount of depth and plays to make. It will take time to get it down. I am 155 levels in and just now feel like I am not throwing.
---
Tf you mean I don't see what she missed here?, is this a video about just a plague kicking the gen?, don't see anyone.
---
One thing that bothers me is why doesn't his hammer change appearance when you switch to a different weapon cosmetic?
---
He has the same issue as Billy and Pig.
---
I agree with guessing game but i think dc isn't the way.
---
I wish I could play demo without my frames dropping :(
---
Personally I just find farming really boring. I mean I don't mind the odd game but lately some nights have been 4-5 farming games in a row and it gets so dull
---
We love a defeatist argument. Guess it's better than admitting that you're wrong.
---
Ahh yes. The noobie ignorance I never claimed not to have. I forgot about the Huntress lmao that confusion triggered some experienced gamers.
---
Your tips turned out very useful. I had no idea that you could use the flashlight to burn the Hag traps and the Wraith too, damn. I get that looping is the main survivor's strategy. 
---
How are keys unfair?
---
Fr. I feel the same with the swamp map
---
I am already waiting 5-10 minutes some nights. I’ll pass on the wait times. This stuff will blow over. SWF teams messaging the killer is super rare compared to other frustrations. I have only had that happen to me once.
---
His name is not Ghostface, that is what you're confused about. It calls him Danny Johnson and titles him The Ghost Face. 
---
It calls Leatherface (Who has a real name) Leatherface and titles him The Cannibal. 
---
Ghostface is the odd one out because he's an OC titled "The Ghost Face
---
"
---
I really don't care how you feel about that, I'm explaining why some of us, including the person you were replying to, find that stupid.
---
lmao thanks for the wisdom  \~
---
Bro me neither, I've gone against more Oni's then spirits and that's a bit concerning
---
i didnt say DC'ing was the way, i just said why people do it
---
What rank are you?
---
yea..... sorry
---
Wraith is honestly quite a weak killer, he can sneak up on you to get a first hit, but other than that he doesn't have anything to help him in a chase. Spine chill is a great perk against stealth killers, if you know how to use it.
---
Pig cannot throw hammers you must confused Pig and huntress together. Pig has a blade on her wrist, huntress wields a large axe, different killers wield different weapons, aside from Myers i think, he can have a pipe, or a knife
---
Hag can place up to 10(i think, correct me if i'm wrong) traps at one time, she can place another one after she reaches her limit, but the oldest trap disappear then. 
---
Speaking of lunges, if you think that hag range is "long" then you haven't played against Freddy yet. Every killer has the same range of basic attack(1 m) and lunge(3 m, except Myers at tier 3) but the thing is killers like Freddy or Hag has shorter weapons, while Doctor, or Huntress, or Trapper has longer weapons so hitbox may seen a bit of, besides if you are playing on PC, there are dedicated servers, which doesn't work perfectly.
---
Thanatophobia is for the most part a placebo effect, unless you are playing against Legion or Plague.
---
If you have trouble finding totems you can use perks like small game or detectives hunch. If ruin is up, unless you got small game, just power through it, it will be painful, but you don't have better option. And if you come across any totems cleanse them, it can feel like wasting time, but saves you from NOED.
---
Wiggling is supposed to stop the killer from bringing you to basement every time, besides you can still come across some sabo squads. You don't sabotage hook instantly, hook sabotage progress saves up, so you 99 them, and when the killer goes to that hook, you then sabotage it, because hooks just repair themselves after 3 minutes or so. Hook also becomes destroyed if the killer sacrificed someone on it.
---
Killers have memento moris, survivor have keys, both are used to end the game early. Community cries about both things for some time now, but as far as i am aware they didn't said anything about nerfing them or removing.
---
About cooperation boost or other things you mentioned. Bear in mind that there are also SWF groups (Survive with friends) most of them just play to have fun, and like to do some stupid things during the match. But there are also much more sweaty groups, abuse every game mechanic (or at lest try), makes gens as fast as possible, i don't think any totem last for more than 30 sec since the beginning of the match, so those kind of groups will abuse those "boosts" or whatever you want. Killers like Legion or Doctor have a very hard time against those sweaty groups. If you buff those killers, then solo survivors are f*cked, but if you instead buff survivors, then you can be sure you will never see those killers again in high ranks.
---
There are two perks which lets you recover from the dying state: unbreakable and no mither.
---
About, selfishness. There always will be people who are selfish, in any game any part of the world, the higher you go in ranks the more altruistic are people, sometimes even too much, you just have to get out of low ranks.
---
Your greatest mistake was: "I never play killer", this is asymmetrical (or whatever) multiplayer, so in short their gameplay differs from each other. How can you want to outsmart the other side, when you don't know how they think?
---
Beside i don't think meg is a good choice for a beginner, you might not have the sprint burst when you need it, adrenaline requires for you to survive the whole match, which honestly i doubt will happen too often, quick and quiet is most useful when paired with lithe.
---
My best advice? Play killer first, get him to rank 12 or something like that you will learn where the gens can spawn, totems and overall map layout.
---
You can also watch some youtubers like Otzdarva, Painreliever, Monto, Truetalent or whoever will come to your likening.
---
Also git gut.
---
Either way we probably would have escaped
---
Gotta love killer FOV... even with that though I'm surprised they didn't see you
---
It's actually faster to not gen tap, powering through the generators is faster on average, it's been tested
---
So I got the game for christmas on my PC and when I looked at my trapper masks I had the ornate and chuckles mask already there. I searched up the chuckles mask and it turns out it's super rare or something so I was wondering why it just came with my game for free?
---
I didn't say anything about making it better than BL, I said it would make it like BL in that scenario. Please reread what I said.
---
I find it incredibly boring. I want to play a challenging game.
---
That is silly. I thought you would get all the levels from completing the Tome how ridiculous
---
The only one wrong here, is you. Try actually reading people’s responses before replying to them. Again, have a happy new year. Maybe in 2020 you’ll grow up 🤷🏼‍♂️❤️
---
It's killer sided because survivors don't know how to run to a pallet and press spacebar duh. Where's the immersion in that?
---
"there's no competition in the genre" there would be if 2k didn'tlet evolve die. the day evolve died was the saddest day of my gaming life. that game was my ideal 1v4 game. but 2k had to fuck it up.
---
Yes that would be good. I would almost always choose one altruism, one objective and one perk based for survivor and for killer I would form builds around a collection (like a basement build for those challenges)
---
Yeah
---
it’s boring and not how the game is meant to be played
---
Every claudette born before 1993 can do all of the above PLUS gens
---
I've had this idea with map and perk bans before but the idea of an actual draft mode makes this sub freak out for some reason.
---
Thank you that was super helpful ! You are right, I was coming from a perspective of how other games are balanced. I totally understand what you mean. I really do enjoy the game and won't stop anytime soon. My initial impression was that it tends to be unfair for the survivors, but that turns out to be kind of the point.
---
I'm glad my post was a fun read to you haha I don't take myself seriously at all ! I'm not scared to admit that I'm really bad at the game right now lol
---
I would have loved to have seen a blighted version of the Demogorgon during the events
---
Wait, what?
---
Oh my god, perfection
---
What the frick have you brought upon this cursed land
---
I wish
---
battle for the universe 2069 colorized
---
I have to agree
---
daaaaaaaaaaaaw
---
The noob stage is awful. Thank you!
---
\^This
---
Wait so the SURVIVOR gets to choose what phobia they have?, can't it just be random?, it's a great idea that will give survivors more things to fear but if this were to be added all those survivors that play scummy won't even try it in fear that it will hurt them in some way.
---
Just play on the switch! Players sometimes T bag but, there is no chat after the game is done!
---
Yes, we need an archives chapter 2.
---
Creating physics objects in UE4 is actually very easy. Attaching a sound effect to a skin is literally as simple as holding a microphone up to a buzzsaw. There are no special shaders. I'm beginning to think you have no idea what you're talking about. There is not a single cosmetic in this game that should take more than 1000 hours to complete by a competent team.
---
Keys are a free escape without doing the whole objective, hell even more now that the hatch spawns when theres only one survivor and not like before where you had atleast do 2 gens for it to spawn when the was only 1 survivor left.
---
If the killer is doing a good job and killing survivors and theres only 2 left and they still need to do 3 more gens (i think, i forgot the gen:survivor ratio for the hatch to spawn) well no worries they got a key and boom the killer loses 2 kills because...key, even when he was destroying the team.
---
Or better yet, lets say the games over 1 survivor left the killer closes the hatch and the gates are close enough for the killer to guard them, then the survivor decides to try its luck and search for a key in chests and finds it Boom escapes, not by skill but by luck.
---
There is no bad side to the key apart from taking an item slot where you could take a  med kit or a toolbox. The only benefit the mori has is ending the game quick but because of the points system in the game the entity is never pleased with that 🤣.
---
It's a hard game!! I like it precisely because it tajes finesse and focus. Have fun and welcome to the fog!!
---
This doesn't really make sense. Ruin is a staple perk and not something you run situationally, whether you were gen rushed or not. Either it works or it doesn't.

It was an exploit, you could play as myers with his tier 1 form, so you didn't have a terror radius and you could use a chainsaw with him, it was hilarious.
---
I plan on playing on the switch as well when they enable cross progression. I’ve only been playing for 6 months but I have almost 500 hours in the game and I don’t really want to start over cause now my characters are getting good perks in stuff.
---
Lery's is pretty much a guaranteed 3K for me even at red ranks. I got almost all of the Adept achievements on Lery's or The Game.
---
And btw, if every single map has a kill rate of &gt;50 % according to official BHRV statistics, not a single map is actually Survivor sided. Even though Farm Maps are obviously more favorable to Survivors.
---
interesting. good luck in the fog, im sure you’ll be able to counter these mechanics in due time
---
I mean ghost face can teabag though
---
if someone is rank 20 with meta perks, trust me they need then badly. you will literally climb to atleast 8 just by playing ruin + hag. did that in my first week of playing the game. climbed to rank 8 from rank 18 playing ruin, bbq, sloppy, whispers hag double pipping every single game.
---
Everyone's said it which is why they're not going to do it.
---
it was glitched last patch and I decided I wanted to play a good ol' game of Scarred Hand Hag for shits and giggles and I actually got the Gideon Meat Plant. My eyes lit up a little as the Entity had blessed me with the PERFECT map for Scarred Hand Hag without me even using a offering, set all my traps on the stupidly ultra safe pallets and rubbed my hands together like an evil villain because I thought these Survivors were about to get trashed on.
---
then
---
they ran through all the traps like they didn't exist
---
I only cried for 20 minutes.
---
I'm pretty sure that even if the nurse smacked them all to get rid of them the nurse wouldn't make it to a hook, especially if one of them was running breakout. Was an unwinnable situation from the nurse unless she hit everyone before picking up the dwight
---
Sounds good I'll have to keep an eye open for you going live! =\] Thanks for the tips, especially the one about messing with spine chill, I actually never thought about that.
---
Apparently they are carrying on with more reworks, Doc being next, so I assume they will get to him at some stage. Fingers crossed.
---
I literally pointed out solo survivor, how the fuck do you get SWF from that? Normally I played survivor more, but I switched to playing killer more often since it's easier to have control over a match.
---
You're right though, we aren't getting anywhere when someone says "you're trolling" or "agree to disagree" you know there's no discussion to be had anymore.
---
Michael: I just walk around and look at people lol
---
It kinda is due to it being a really awful word to use against someone. Like if you ever worked with SPED kids, they will tell you how awful the word feels. Like it is just common decency not to say it
---
When you have people DCing over, getting salty at, and intentionally denying NOED, Basement, Flashlight, Pallet (just what I've been seeing on this subreddit) challenges because they dislike those playstyles, it stops being about 'the good in people'.
---
if I streamed I'd absolutely make this an emote for my chat, this is fantastic. very well done
---
Okay then explain how the creators of Path of Exile, who have about half the employees, put out significantly more cosmetics, new content, music, UI changes, gameplay changes, items, entire new areas, and far more in the same time it takes DBD to add one new killer / survivor?
---
I agree :(
---
I’m not confused about anything lol the killer is named Ghostface. Again, you’re arguing semantics. If you played with a new player and they asked “who’s that killer?” Would you really say oh yeah that’s Danny Johnson. No you would say that killer is named Ghostface. Which he is, because the game calls him Ghostface. The “Dead by Daylight: Ghost Face” DLC says “Ghost Face is joining Dead by Daylight” not fucking Danny Johnson, not “The Ghost Face” but just Ghost Face.
---
for every extra second low rank survivors take to repair the gen, the low rank killer you're against is probably taking double that extra per chase he's in
---
I think the vast majority of the time when people get sent to Lery's they do it as a Killer who's massively favored on that map (Mirror Michael, Pig, Ghostface, Doctor, etc.) All the 4ks that Mirror Michaels get on Lery's massively overshadow the average kill rate on that map.
---
That being said finding gens on the map is a bitch and a half and very often games go down to 2 or 1 gen left with none of the Survivors being able to find it. Add in the fact that it's the smallest map in the game and it's very easy for a Killer to patrol between the last few gens.
---
Real people who were born in 1996 such as myself can do everything. &gt;:D
---
And here you have the obligatory "devs said the kill rate is 50% so the game is fine" post.

&gt;So Balanced Landing, 2.0?
---
That implies that you think Lithe would be better than Balanced Landing. I think you should re-read what you wrote...
---
There's no mindgame, chainsaw rev and either they drop it or go down, and also the payout is much better with billy cause you actually get a down if they don't drop it, and with clown you only get a hit
---
True, that does need to be changed. So you don't have to have an active challenge and can instead work on any challenges at any time in a match.
---
Ahh, gotcha. In that case I'd imagine he's near the top of a relatively short list. I couldn't think of many killers less-viable than him.
---
Evrlery survivor still tries to do that pallet juke with Legion where they vault, wait for you to vault, then try to go back over the pallet. Despite that not really working consistently since Legion PTR, if I remember right.
---
That said, still an excellent compilation. Enjoy the upvote
---
Imagine having the chainsaw, then getting slapped by Ghostface or Susie.
---
Bro, get off the fucking steam page and look in the game. His name is Danny and his title is The Ghost Face. That is what I’ve said the entire time. They call The Cannibal Leatherface on the store page as well, his title is still The Cannibal and not The Leather Face.
---
What are you trying to argue here? That the game does not title a character called Danny “The Ghost Face” or that I should like it instead of finding it silly?
---
In my opinion they should remove the ”accept challenge” and make it so you can just complete any challenge that you have reached so far in the tome. 
---
Having to always go back to the archives to switch between survivor and killer challenges is pretty annoying and not being able to search for a match while doing so is also pretty clumsy by BHVR.
---
And another thing, if the point of his kit is dropping pallets it's clear he's shit, billy does the same thing but it's better, he has an instadown and possibly the best mobility in the game
---
Oh god.
---
Yes, please. Let’s lower the number of viable killers from 2 to 1
---
We were having a productive conversation until you just decided to play defeatist. I've been in enough arguments to know that when people act how you are, it's because they don't have any other way to argue their side. Just sure, I'm the ignorant one, whatever makes you happy buddy.
---
You see things through your perspective, do you see things through mine?
---
I have no issue getting blinded and looped, they're part of the game. I just hate when Survivors seem to think they take any form of skill.
---
don't get me wrong, there are good Survivors and bad Survivors, but a good Survivor is just a player with common sense.
---
let's be perfectly honest, holding your run button and reacting to what the Killer does isn't exactly skill.
---
I'll defend toxic shit because even if I don't use these perks I think fucking with people who are doing it just to get done with the Archives is stupid as fuck. 
---
I don't think people should hold any expectation of how or what other players use and do. I didn't get upset when people AWPed back when I played CS:GO, I didn't get upset when people took advantage of Garen's E buff in League. Why should I get upset when people use flashlights, or moris, or perks that are in the game.   
---
It's okay if I say the BR-word, I have a Brazilian friend and he gave me the pass.
---
I did not expect for Yui to pop up out of no where lol.
---
I feel like the challenges are good and bad...while for survivors it makes them play styles they may have never tried and gets them off meta perks and more comfortable going for saves and bmore aggressive towards the killer the killer challenges seem made to encourage slugging,camping and tunneling in order to complete as fast as possible!
---
I understand that a lot of people will say well you arent meant to get them done in the first match and you are supposed to get them naturally over time but c'mon guys who the hell thinks people are going to casually do a challenge? Like have you met this community or any gaming community?
---
I love how the box gets thicker
---
I agree, it does get dull...but like once or twice  a night or something like that i dont mind but like u said 4-5 of them in a row boring, only exception is during bloodhunt....or bps
---
Precisely. It’s endgame. If you expect a killer to not camp then you are a very pampered player.
---
It's the fact that he has to work for it that makes it less rewarding. Hillbilly can do the exact same thing whenever he wants. Oni needs the flick otherwise he's just an inferior Billy.
---
insert run of the mill "no god up here but me" meme
---
There would be lots of competition if the devs didn't fuck up. Its honestly a shame that every game dies because of incompetent devs or legal issues.
---
Something tells me you're taking a lot of this sub out of context.  The point of this post was to show poor rank based matchmaking.  Not how easy or hard things may or may not be.
---
Yah that post was a bit self-serving. Reeks of a PR person who has never played the game which I get but... really? Let's tone the hyperbole down from 11 shall we?
---
cute
---
No worries bro! Yeah I'm working overtime this week at my normal 9 to 5 but I'm gonna try to throw some streams up! If you come in I'll play amanda and try to break down all my decisions good or bad
---
Where did I say anything about Lithe being better than BL in this case? Cause I don't see that anywhere in my post.
---
That would be pretty cool!

I've also thought this would be good, especially if they're insisting on doing these 'complete within one trial' challenges. Just adds so much extra stress onto a game that's already very stressful for killers. I didn't really struggle with any of the survivor challenges. The spine chill and 4 gen dark sense challenges took a couple of games but I didn't have to change my play style at all really and didn't get stressed. The killer challenges have almost given me a mental breakdown. I don't think it's bias at all from the devs, it's just that they don't really understand their own game very well, especially at red ranks, which is frustrating.
---
&gt;&gt;So Balanced Landing, 2.0?
---
&gt;That implies that you think Lithe would be better than Balanced Landing. I think you should re-read what you wrote...
---
It's not unbalanceable. I'll start!
---
1. Instead of injured state and deep wound, Feral Frenzy now inflicts one damage state and deep wound, unless the survivor already has deep wound applied, in which case it ends the power.
---
2. Feral Frenzy once again counts as a basic attack.
---
I'd say this is a good start to balancing Legion.
---
I truly dont think there are any "OP" perks in the game, but i agree with your point.
---
My main issues is that there are so many game breaking bugs that will force you to DC, and there will be more in the future. 
---
The devs are going to punish you for there shitty game design.
---
The DC penitently fixes nothing but giving the killer their BBQ stack before the survivor kills themselves on hook. This change will literally do nothing but make the flaws in the game look deeper then they where before.
---
Yes, we have perks to assist us. That's the point of them
---
BHVR has all exclusives unlocked because they noticed they were being marketed for exorbitant prices . They made them available for all players to counter this.
---
yeah. sadly my own individual love for an online game doesn't force everyone else to love it too
---
You are getting downvoted for playing the game
---
I'm agreeing with you btw. just wanted to make sure that was clear
---
i farmed for every single one of the killer ones.
---
last year was about survivor nerfs, but okay
---
Reposting what you just wrote doesn't answer my question, dude. If you don't have an answer, just say so, I won't judge.
---
Dam dry I didn't know
---
 You can literally stand still near a loop as spirit and the survivor has to play a gamble which spirit nearly wins %70 of the time. I don't want to kill her viabilty but standing still shouldn't be a thing.
---
Meg, Feng Min or Kate for their athletic perks
---
 **Claustrophobia:** new meme build for dwight....
---
This exactly. I want a game like Last Year to blow up in popularity that way the devs are actually scared of losing their player base and actually try to improve the game instead of jacking off on their keyboards whenever they nerf a viable killer.
---
There's no way to casually sacrifice all 4 in the basement. It's just not going to happen unless you run a basement build, go back after unhooks and slug for the 4k. And even then the survivor can bleed out, forcing you not to slug, as happened to me.
---
These were exclusive items a long time ago when the game first came out or for events. However, since it has been such a long time and nobody ever really wears them anymore, BHVR decided to just give these exclusive items away anyways. They're mostly recolors anyways.
---
Funeral Ash to look fancy when loopin.
---
using this logic killer takes no skill either, all you do is hold W and react to what the survivors do
---
You can absolutely win that “””gamble””” by playing well
---
Ok, thx for clearing it up for me
---
Hey I need points too to salvage a safety pip. Sorry but you have to die
---
I actually had a match where there was a myers but only his mask was visible.. that was fucked up and scary lol. But all this was a long time ago.
---
Sub-50 hour survivor only here. I'm starting to understand some of the killers and how to juke them (Demo, Pig, Billy) but what about those less picked, like  Plague, Doctor, Legion, Freddy? I still don't understand what kind of impact, early or late, being sick/mad/asleep, etc has on the game. Do I need to concern myself with being asleep the whole game if Freddy hasn't even found me? That kind of shit.

Don't forget civilian posing Myers
---
Idk.
---
Remember when they made it so you actually had to hit people with her hatchets and every huntress main bitched about needing to actually have to aim so they reverted it like a week later. Now she just throws 747's again
---

Op
---
honestly the nerf is hardly noticeable
---
Why would we change your mind? It's true.
---
To add onto this. Resilience pairs really well with Spine Chill. Spine Chill and Resilience both add increased vault speed and if both are at tier three then that'll give you 15% extra vault speed.
---
&gt;survivors noed
---
Do the roar
---
Yeah there was no way she'd get it lmao
---
Her skill floor is about the same when it comes to downing a survivor, she just lacks map control since you can't blink nonstop and her overall gameplay is clunkier because of dedicated servers and how her blinks interact with map props. More often than not any random prop will cuck your blink and you won't move while having to go through the cooldown.
---
The devs should've just nerfed her add-ons but they went overboard and made unnecessary changes to her base power.
---
Is she still strong? Absolutely but, her gameplay is frustrating.
---
Yeah dailies exist to encourage people go play different sides and different ways. The fact people think BHVR would just give out free BP for no reason is funny
---
Rar
---
Most survivor loses can be attributed to "I got greedy"
---
You are saying that good killers are uneducated people?
---
🤔😏💦🍆✊
---
As a spirit player, you can hear survivors, see the grass moving, scratch marks etc. What information do survivors have on that situation? If she isn't moving, you can't know if she is phasing or not. So all you do was hoping spirit makes a mistake.
---
true, guess my point is a little muddled and hard to understand.
---
like if I'm a survivor and being chased, say I'm at a standard jungle gym, the Killer chooses how I run said tile, see what I mean? I don't get to choose what side I loop or how I loop it, the Killer decides and I have to react and loop the tile as best I can from the Killer's choice of how they want me to loop it. does that make sense? again there a certainly definitely good and bad Survivors but I don't think the skill gap is nearly as gigantic as it is with Killers.
---
Whenever I get into a lobby I’ll invite everyone into a party (I’m on Xbox) so I can talk to them and I’ll do my best to cooperate with those people, I won’t fuck over the ones who don’t join but if they get mad about something then i at least feel like I tried to cooperate with them at the beginning and they have no leg to stand on.. that being said if you were on Xbox I’d def play with you since me and my buds are always looking for a 4th
---
Then how about you stop running so she can’t follow your scratch marks, ya ding dong
---
not to mention people often run ebonies with it
---
I'm still sure they lied about that. My guess is in theory it should be rare but seeing how shit match making is it prioritizes swfs to fill lobbies faster
---
You listed 3 survivor sided maps and one killer sided, I listed improvements I think would help the bs on the survivor sided maps and then asked what ideas you had to fix Hawkins as I don't have any useful suggestions for it
---
You then go on a rant about people complaining about the maps you just complained about lol
---
Corn isn't the worst but it's absolutely detrimental to certain killers. Survivors can see the killer from anywhere in the corn, it needs to be lowered or the mostly removed (and then a huge tile rework).
---
Infinites on any map need to be completely removed.
---
I know what makes the survivor sided maps horribly unbalanced, I don't know how to fix a killer sided map without recreating those same issues.
---
So what would you do to fix Hawkins lab?
---
Iron grasp tier 1, nothin else to transport bodies... wow
---
No it just disgusts me that a really good killer has to work for a 4K and a garbage killer can slap on no ed and get an easy 3k.
---
That was just a example..
---
Ash --&gt; Boom Stick to stun. Chainsaw to break hooks.
---
As a Jane main this made me so proud that I shed a tear
---
That's way too difficult to do on such a tiny surface
---
I almost always get killer challenges as a killer main, just never for the killer i main
---
well, time to moonwalk into gens!
---
Why would alt+f4 derank you below 16, though, when you can't get -1 pip at 17 or below?
---
I usually try to farm when someone leaves the game. I think it s the perfect time to do so.
---
Fixated, I run it with sprint burst usually. So much fun walking that fast haha
---
That's how you get a lot of killers to be better you abuse really good add-ons. But I do agree with you, Nurse is one of the few killers who can consistently 4k and win the match without add-ons. And those who can't 4k now and say that the nerf was to much, need to be better. But I can kinda see why tho. If you only played with range and chain blink add-ons it is in your muscle memory how long you should charge the power for, but still, she is the best killer without add-ons hands down.
---
Example of what? That you don’t know how to counter Spirit?
---
I always appreciate when someone has kindred, team player
---
well we just built it
---
The repost *is* the answer. I literally cannot make it more simple for you.
---
Hope. I think it's very underrated.
---
Don't apologize. Its EGC, why on earth would you leave and let the hooked person escape
---
*now if you camp from the start you're trash*
---
WGLF, as a killer main I feel robbed when I play survivor. So I need the extra BP.
---
*correction
---
*That will happen!*
---
Bruh just use the wheelchair
---
i can post a ss of the build and my account
---
We'll Make It for me. Not just for healing after unhooking but also breaking the killer's momentum when they have multiple people injured. It's a godsend too against stealth killers and Oni who somewhat require the team to stay injured in order to get their shit done.
---
thank
---
Brown Medkit
---
Yeah! When I just started, I would play mostly killer because of those sweet bp.
---
I can agree if it’s usable the entire match, not just 1 time. If the survivor wants to be poking at the killer with their DS active they aren’t doing gens or anything else and killer can just slug them. Then there is 1 maybe 2 that aren’t doing any objectives to go heal that person up, if not then the DS user just lays there contemplating their bad life choices until killer hooks them. Win win.
---
Idk. I play my killer very different than others (pig main who makes up my own rules on who lives or dies, once i get 4 hooks with bbq idgaf and just mess around) so it forces me to RP a different "game" for each archive as killer and I enjoy it.  
---
As a survivor it allows me to practice stuff basicaly and set  challenges against myself.  
---
You don't have to do the archives, but I enjoy doing them.
---
How much space is left on the partition with your OS installed? Sometimes low available space on the same partition can have a negative impact on performance. 
---
Did you have this issue with the previous Nvidia driver release? If not, rolling back may be a good idea.
---
Additionally, if you have Discord running I urge you to disable the Discord overlay if it's active, and to disable hardware acceleration in Discord.
---
CHKDSK may help shed light on any issues with the drive. 
---
If your PC is always on, I highly recommend a good old-fashioned restart as well.
---
True. I did the noed and basement one as trapper. The noed one I tried way to many times but only was able to do it after camping (its impressive how survs either die really fast or become untoucheble gods)
---
That's what's been great about the changes the good nurses are still super strong and the mediocre ones aren't.
---
how fast can you go in a wheelchair though?
---
This game is literally the ARK:Survival Evolved of asymmetrical horror games
---
Her addons needed the nerf, not her power itself.
---
3 blink nurse wasn’t fun.
---
4 blink nurse wasn’t fun.
---
5 blink was if you were soyboy.
---
The fact she could miss and blink back in x amount of times was difficult to play against, and especially if they’re good at nurse.
---
But, nurse is good even without addons and since she is the best killer, it’s difficult find the right balance for her, especially cause of her unique play style. Personally I think they just need to revert her original power back, but keep addons the way they are now, because that alone was what sucked for players going against nurse.
---
Usually that happens with new killers so it should get better as you rank up. Sometimes higher rank killers do it too though unfortunately
---
I used to like running WMI, but the amount of Claudettes who go to a corner of the map and Self Care in my face is too many for me.
---

---
Random question about your switch you getting that new Animal Crossing next year?
---
Ah you're correct. The wiki says that it works, but it appears to be outdated
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ehtq5d/hey_guys_i_need_help_all_of_my_dlcs_are_gone_i/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Okay cause I don't think I'd want to play if every killer was like that lol
---
Last year = a good game with absolutely trash of devs
---
DBD = a decent game with devs who try their best but *their best ain't the best*
---
Rin Yamaoka. I, the legion, shall tell you that you shouldn't be here right now. Go use your weak add-ons in a trial with p3 Claudettes which have flashlights!
---
Mhmm like I said lucky
---
What ruin does is further widen the gap between good and less-good survivors. So it actually has a much lower effect on really good survivors. Goddamn i love corrupt
---
Stabby gang for life
---
Nah, best one is where they taunt you while healing a teammate, as nurse I teleported over and picked someone up. Didn’t realize it was the _healthy_ survivor.
---
Yes. This also works with Save the Best For Last, so if it's not the obsession it's super useful to give em a whack.
---
telepathically controlled wheelchair*
---
Kindred is amazing because it’s bond for the entire team when someone is hooked. And since the times when survivors are hooked are usually integral to game progress, it’s like bond but when you need it most.
---
with the buttons you can
---
That's every game. Most fan bases are super toxic
---
Ah ha, that's impossible on PS4
---
You don't have to be injured lol. Just hit the greats while you are using the perk.
---
So we should buff the best killer cause she doesn't feel great to play to you. Here is the deal, Nurse needs an entire overhaul IMO. She is the best killer in the game, and she is probably better than some killers even without add-ons. Nurse is all about muscle memory. That is why a lot of Nurse players don't use add-ons, causer it just makes her "worse", cause they are not used the the charge time, length of blink or amount of blinks. If you only used 3 blink Nurse before that is what you know how to play.
---
IMO the way to change Nurse is to remove the ability to chain blink without add-ons. That would make her harder to play as you would have to be very precise with your blinks. And add-ons would give her the ability to gain back another blink.
---
Only reason I don’t fall for it more is because they tend to throw multiple. At that point it’s pretty obvious what’s going on.
---
Absolutely
---
Not even close.  I've gotten the Epilogue of every Tome, so I have a good number of challenges left, but it only adds up to about 50 rift points.  That's 5 levels.  The number of games + challenge rewards it took me to finish everything I **did** complete only got me to level 40.
---
Nothing worse than a killer getting outplayed all game just to get kills through noed. It's they way it rewards someone for playing poorly that bothers me. I mean yeah, do bones. All well and good in a swf were you know how many have been done and if I see one I'll do it but solo queue there is no way to know other than to waste a bunch of time hunting for totems on the chance the killer has it.
---
The survivor in me says you're a scholar and a gentleman.
---
I would not worry about getting reported if that's what you were worried about. 
---
The killer in me says that it's okay if you still had fun.
---
Nah... tbag bros stick together
---
Can’t be bothered to remember they even exist half the time, their benefits are marginal at best

Lol I was talking about having informations to plan your next move but I don't think you can follow the conversation.
---
Nurse does not need a one-shot she is already broken and all other one-shot abilities should get nerfed HEAVILY
---
I remember back in October of 2017. We had a BP event, not double, but triple BP. And back then WGLF used to stack up to 200% increased BP (50% per stack), that shit was fire dawg.
---
would it still come with when she blinks then?
---
*aaaargh*
---
Pretty much this, unless it's a mori for a daily or streamers/pudding, they're pretty pointless.
---
Wraith seems OP to you because you haven’t developed the awareness you need to the game; it will come with time. You can use spine chill to help yourself with that in beginning as you don’t have a lot of teachables unlocked. Also, you should try to play both sides so you can view their perspective as well because it’s really different. Have fun !
---
What’s really frustrating is when you close the hatch with the last guy downed so you can find him, but adrenaline pops. Doesn’t seem like the perk is “rewarding you for winning” in that situation.
---
Rank means nothing. If you still haven’t learned that... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
If I'm not using Botany Knowledge, it's Autodidact. Especially if I see more slugging than average. Usually, if the killer is using Sloppy Butcher, you can snag 3-4 tokens off of a single heal and be set for the rest of the match.
---
Obviously there will be moments where it screws you over but man I love perks you have to 'power up' to use.
---
I don’t run it cause I like teleporting but that run in closed places would be amazing lol
---
Thanks! I'm actually running save the best for last and sloppy butcher on trapper and I wanted to know that
---
Why are they entitled when you were the guy pretending to farm? I dont even have words to explain how much of an asshole you are being right now
---
Well, what the fuck do you need? Either she’s phasing or she isn’t. God forbid you have to actually do a little bit of thinking
---
They should make it so you can shove survivors aside even if they slow you down a little.
---
I always run Babysitter in my build, its kinda fun to be able to see the killer do a 180 from across the map and start barreling towards me
---
No it isnt. Re-tothe-tard was and still is the actually term for mentally disabled people. Just one week people decided it was offensive being compared to someone mentally disabled 
---
Every word is offense at some point and replaced with longer phrases
---
In the next few years mentally disabled will be replaced with "lower IQ individual"
---
Nope I can't
---
I don't like Spirit
---
Doesn't stop my innate instinct even though I'd happily be deranked for less stressful matches
---
*A B S O R B   H E R   M O I S T U R E*
---
Buff MoM so when active you pull out a chainsaw and murder the killer
---
You represent the worst and most toxic part of the DBD community that you depend upon to have an enjoyable game on a reciprocal mutually beneficial manner.  That’s not to say you collaborate with your opponents, but rather you all agree to certain boundaries within the game which are necessary to preserve the integrity of the game itself.  For example, if both teams in hockey don’t agree that the rule of offside makes the game better, it would be a pretty shitty game of hockey go have one team running all over the rink as they please.
---
Look deep within yourself. You know this to be true. You just don’t *care* that it’s true.
---
I don't really get your doctor complaint, Freddy is better after his rework
---
Yeah, I would be fine with that.
---
Thank you dude these maps I wanna cry when I get them I thought I was alone on hating them. Especially as killer someone goes and the bushes and poof they gone
---
It’s a game. “Killer instinct” is just a mechanic. You don’t have to try so hard lol. Maybe that’s why 3 people DC’d in the first place 👀
---
He does look cool but could look cooler. I like the green cosmetic for him with the bead necklace and helmet over his eyes much better than the original cosmetic
---
Killer mostly relies on survivors mistakes so if the survivors are bad and the killer isn’t brain dead it shouldn’t be too hard
---
but thank god we can play Dead By Daylight on our phones soon, right guys?! 
---
Heh heh.. uhh... guys..?
---
They want to make the game in general have more unsafe pallets/windows to force interaction between the Killer and Survivors, as opposed to just throwing pallets as soon as it becomes relevant and forcing the killer to break them.
---
It makes a ton of sense for the next map to be Lery's, since it's Doctor's Map. They might as well keep them together, much like what they did with Freddy and Badham (both of which got reworked at the same time).
---
My only gripe with that sub is poorly executed futa stuff and the fact that anytime there is any "hardcore" stuff posted people get butt hurt. Like it's a game about putting people on meat hooks but a bruised tit is what upsets them? Wtf
---
It might’ve been bugged, but hilarious never the less. Also I’m on PS4!
---
Well if a red rank swf is mad in trying too hard maybe they should quit
---
Yeah. I ran into iron will calm spirit claud on one. I saw her once the entire match. She can literally crouch. Bam. Gone.
---
Survivors can be idiots sometimes.  Obviously he’s gotta give you ten seconds at least
---
There's something unsettling about this... the eyes... the overly smooth skin...
---
This.
---
Honestly I don’t understand why everyone hates playing against spirit I’m fine with them
---
He does have a sweater
---
Wouldn’t say that.  Ormond needs a rework first, then haddonfun, then probably Lerys
---
Is it still possible to get the nurse achievement for grabbing a survivor off a gen after three blinks? If it is, what perks do you have to use
---
I noticed a couple of things during the days they were testing DC's. 
---
One was people just suiciding on hook which pretty much makes it pointless on a survivor side.
---
The second, and this could just be coincidence, but I noticed more killers playing like absolute shitters as if they knew survivors would be less likely to DC. Like a lot more camping, hard tunnelling with 5 gens still up etc. But maybe I was just unlucky on games with that one. But it does cause me to worry that both sides will start being more toxic because they know the other is less likely to rage quit.
---
SWF is a totally different scenario. Some of them go in to have fun, others go in with the sole intention of ruining your fun. Those are the ones who truly deserve to die lol.
---
people be sleepin on alert, underrated top tier
---
Pig has literally only had 3 changes to her since launch.  So why are there so many memes about her getting a nerf?  Wouldn't this at least make sense if it was the doc?
---
ncreased the Terror Radius from 28 metres to 32 metres.
---
    Reduced the fade-in/fade-out timer from 6.6 seconds down to ~4 seconds.
---
Decreased the base crouch and uncrouch duration from 2 seconds to 1.3 seconds.
---
They’ll prob do coldwind when they change the chainsaw addons and buff bubba
---
Oh agreed absolutely one of the most frustrating things, especially if they literally run at you off the hook or do a gen right in front of you
---
That's why I like having a "fuck you" response with trapper so much
---
Dude same. And then there are people who think that saying “get over it it’s not that big of a deal” will help when it really doesn’t. Constantly getting teabagged at and stunned for kicks and giggles is extremely annoying and it’s not even worth playing killer anymore (for me). I would just rather play survivor where you can actually counter the toxicity (tunneling, camping) with good perks like BT, DS, etc.
---
Yikes, looking at the community’s reaction to our little exchange, it would appear I fucking schooled you, wouldn’t it?
---
Get *dunked* on!!!
---
New kindred is so useful when doing solo queue.
---
They aren't  entitled.  They feel entitled to a free escape just because I was being friendly.  If they didn't feel entitled they wouldn't get angry when other shoe drops.
---
It never crosses their minds a mass murderer would trick them.  Bait, and switch. 
---
I wouldn't be mad at the killer if I fell for that tactic.  I'd be angry at myself for falling for it.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'd happily run fun non meta builds if I wouldn't then be bullied by meta builds
---
That’s honestly just sad at that point. The fact that they’d take THAT much time out of their day to message you dumb shit. Smh.
---
Out of intrest, what rank are you and what rank is he?
---
If I sense it’s a SWF I just run Spirit with a mori. Usually I get at least one DC lmao
---
Now that I think about it, I found Dark Sense kinda fun when running it for the challenge. Came in handy a few times.
---
Against freddy, it's better to be awake because his power wont effect you, but dont prioritize it. All that sleep does it make it so you either see fake pallets or can get hit by his snares.
---
Plage is an all or nothing scenario. If one person cleanses, then I tend to say have everyone cleanse. It's better not to cleanse though because the black Bile is really strong.
---
And when you go against the doctor,  just cry.
---
Hope that helps. Good luck in the fog
---
Oh, I see. Yes its pretty much reality, unfortunately
---
&gt; The reasons people DC are extremely poor map design and balance
---
Here's your problem. You're assigned some sort of 'noble' intention behind d/cing to give it justification. 
---
When someone D/Cs because they were the first one downed, or they are trying to deny a killer hook perks/ archive challenges that's just them being a dick. Then they come on here and argue they should be allowed to d/c because their fun is more important than everyone elses.
---
The game has allowed people to d/c almost as much as they want for nearly its entire existence.  And the only thing that has gotten us is a warped sense of entitlement among the playerbase to treat the game like some sort of buffet, that they get to pick and choose how 4 other strangers play the game. And if one of the strangers does something not according to this invisible set of rules, just d/c and instantly get into another game to try again.
---
Curious if you all think this is a good strategy or if it wastes time: the first gen I find, I run it for 1 second just so the pistons start pumping. Then I sprint off to another. I think killers tend to walk right past an unstarted gen and onto the next, but might waste 20 seconds running circles around a started one. Plus, if you have spine chill and run another gen nearby, you might get early flashes of it while they circle the decoy. But since they are still circling, it gives you more time to get away than if they just made a straight pass from a to b.
---
The killer should be hiding from her
---
You make many good points.
---
Few points I want to point out though:
---
It's asymmetrical competive game with one vs many. The maps aren't and they shouldn't be balanced because they can't be balanced. You can try to balance the map vs M1 killer with no power, but the killer power will ultimately always tip the balance to one side or another. You will get a hillbilly in the hospital every once in a while and sometimes you will get the ghostface in the game. Trying to move more and more towards balance and fairness will ultimately make the game more bland, I feel. A lot can be improved, but I think ultimately variance is what makes the game more interesting.
---
You talk about unfun playstyles. What is fun for me might not be fun for you. I love playing jumpscare Myers in the hospital, but others will DC for the mere thought of having to stay more alert. Some of us have a very narrow view of fun such as playing with all your 14-year old friends and try to annoy the killer as much as possible to make a video - when this group gets the power taken from them in a form of instant-down hatchets of a huntress, should it be okay for them to dc? Are some of the perks unfun to play against? Maybe. Ruin, for example, doesn't make an unfun perk. If anything it gives you another objective, which you only have two of anyway - repair generators and escape. I agree it can take it's toll when you see the same perk 75% of the time which is why I think variance is key to more interesting game.
---
I've seen a lot of players argue for right to DC without penalty, but we should also consider what DCing does for the rest of players in the game. I think there are only two reasons for DCing the permits someone. DCing to give someone the hatch, which I feel is misuse of game mechanics. Then there's is DCing to end the game incase you have a real life situation. Neither of these situations should happen daily.
---
If you are placing your own enjoyment above other player's enjoyment and time many times a day, there absolutely should be a penalty. If you don't find the game enjoyable, you should consider taking a break.
---
Stake Out. It's a really underwhelming perk, but something about stalking the killer is just a lot of fun to me.
---
More recently Inner Strength has worked wonders. It's incredibly fast, great for when you need a clutch heal and it ignores Sloppy. I hope it never becomes popular because those dulls are mine
---
don't tell me they are going to nerf pig... she is one of the most balanced killers i can think of
---
What did she say after game?
---
lery's isn't killer sided...
---
Hard restart the console usually fixes these things
---
I forgot that’s a thing, I generally did not care about rank. Still don’t, is there any benefits to it, like increased BP earned or access to new skins?
---
What was the update?
---
Legion and oni are both trash. So 3/5
---
I've always held the belief that Kindred is a solo survivor staple, and now with it's buff it's even greater.
---
Yes but it would retain the momentum so it can be used as a projectile, after which it would slowly stroll from where it landed towards wherever you are. The mori would be phasing the chair inside the survivor making them explode. There's so much you could do with a wheelchair
---
Then it would be impossible to get a flashlight save unless instant-blind flashlight was brought back.
---
Yee agreed 100%
---
Check the official 2019 post, that's what peeps are saying.
---
It's got it's killers it favors (mostly stealth ones), but it's a pretty fun map either way for me.
---
We're gonna live forever
---
I love it but find I don’t make it to end game enough to justify it
---
When the rift updates and all that stuff changes, will there be new challenges? Or do we have to do the same ones but like in a different order? What happens when the rift is over???
---
objectively- Adrenaline is the best.
---
Even if low ranks manage to do all the gens most of the time they will die, all they know is running in a straight line, no looping or anything, just running, and the killer is faster, and even then most low rank killers run noed so yeah you shouldn't balance around low ranks
---
Lol says the guy who ends with try Civilization. It's pretty clear that you had no intention of changing your views. Move on, man. Because the game is fun for you as a killer it must be for everyone so therefore the game is fine as it is. Got it.
---
I feel like its survivor sided, but thats because I play killers who really suffer without good sight lines (Oni, nurse, etc.) so I'm biased.
---
I'm collecting data on killer and survivor rank differences.
---
Around 77% of survivors are within five ranks of killer's rank. I'd say matchmaking is working quite okay.
---
Lery is one of my favorites for playing killer, if you've got a pile of potatoes, it's definitely killer sided.
---
What is slower than 110? BK Myers?
---
When all three survivors go into the basement to unhook and heal
---
Out of all the killer's there are 3 stealth killer's and 4 if you include addons. But apart from those 4 the map is survivor sided. Yeah pallets on it are trash but the amount of vault locations make up for it. And don't get me started about the distance between the gates. Patrolling them is near impossible
---
Yeah suiciding on hook is basically a longer and unpunished DC so the issue is unsolved completely for survivors. 
---
As for camping / BM play, It’ll be more prevalent in the low ranks where players are generally a lot lower in skill and they unironically camp cause it’s all they know but that’s the current case. Camping does happen at high ranks but it’s much rarer to see it there whereas in low ranks you get it quite often. I feel like it would happen more because they will be otherwise punished but honestly I feel like it would normalise after a while. Like people will just want the opportunity to say “Haha you can’t DC” but it’ll get old and they’ll move on
---
One other point I neglected to mention in my post is crashing. I don’t know how many others experience this but my PS4 is a rather old model and many games often crash. Crashing happens frequently after installing new updates or games and is usually fixed by rebuilding the database. But often I’ll be in a game then be bluescreened out. Now if there was a ban system in I would be timed out from playing for something out of my fault. Nobody can do anything about it cause BHVR’s system is black and white. You see the game to its end or you get timer’d.

It's the third most deadly map for survivors.

Agree, it works for apex I dont see why we cant have this either

Ah, is that how you call your dungeon? Kibda lame, if you ask me
---
Bro it’s how the game was meant to be played. Even when I play as killer I don’t care if I run into them.
---
A haddonfield rework could be saved for the latter half of 2020 to coincide with the new Halloween movie.
---
the game isn't fine though...
---
You are getting downvoted for bragging.*
---
it’s all good
---
Now if you're running it you still get the effect when someone else is on hook even if they don't have it.
---
Nemesis is golden for her. traps tick when in a chase.
---
Oni is good, if I weren't on console I'd definitely play him more.
---
Yeah from what I have heard doctor will be stronger, and just as annoying to face right?
---
JOJO! DIO!
---
There are some serious bots downvoting you
---
 For most survivors, playing against her feels like a gamble because you don't really have an information to make moves. You drop a pallet hoping she went to the other side of the pallet isn't really a competitive thing. I would enjoy going against her if my teammates didn't give uo the time they saw tge spirit.
---
If it works for you then it's a good strategy imo.
---
No, he’s saying that he doesent think the pig is as bad as people say they are which I would agree with
---
Did a swf where I was jeff. Got downed first so crew all went for the save.  Ended up human centipede. Friend told killer how they worshipped jeff. Was so funny killer let three of us go. Had dark sense so sneaky me got 4 gens. Praise Jeff.
---
You didn't say anything factual so school is out.  You did very effectively demonstrate how toxic, and full of anger some of you are though.  I suggest a sensual massage, or a nice relaxing spa treatment to relieve all that anger, frustration, and bias you're holding inside.
---
That was beautiful
---
Yeah 77% is definitely solid. I would like like to know what causes the other 23% of matchmaking mishaps like this one.
---
Unpopular opinion- toxicity is bad
---
No he really isn't. At best he's mid-tier but tbh he isnt even that. Hes an M1 killer with extra mobility but only after hes already got a few hits. His power does not help him get hits at all anymore.
---
I love this game
---
This is dope! 😂😂😂
---
Did they confirm cross progression? I know they talked about it, and threw it in a survey.
---
Cause I will absolutely get the switch version if cross progression becomes a thing.
---
I've only gotten devour hope to work once in my 30+ tries with it. Even when I put on The Game.
---
I was rank 11, the killer was rank 13.
---
Then explain Red Dead Redemption 2
---
I tend to use dark sense a lot. Knowing killer's movements is big part of my gameplay as I'm better at working objectives than wasting killer's time.
---
As a killer I use monitor and abuse a lot just to get closer to the survivors before the chase.
---
Personally, if Babysitter made the unhooked survivor leave no scratch marks, blood trails, or make grunts of pain, I think it would be good. 
---
Babysitter has a niche, and it’s usefulness is different from BT. BT is used for securing relatively unsafe unhooks safely. Babysitter should only be used for a safe unhook, because the unhooked should get away and the unhooked should loop for the survivor. They’re both unhook perks, but they are meant to be used very differently.
---
They stated on the live stream they're working on Doc purely for the reason that survivors find him annoying to go against. Seems like a backwards way to go about balancing a low tier killer to me.  From what they've described so far his anti-stealth capabilties and gen defense will be knee capped. But like I said I'm willing to wait and see
---
But This Isn't Happening increases the great skill check zone while injured, not while healthy.... Do you not have to have the perk active for the checks to count? I swear to god if I never had to actually have it active and only had to have it in my HUD, I'm yeeting my mouse because I thought I had to have it actively working for it to count.
---
On PC there have been a lot of issues recently where people randomly get kicked mid game and they were getting punished even though it wasn't their fault. Same with some bugs where the killer couldn't pick someone up and they wouldn't bleed out and even end game wouldn't kill them so someone is forced to DC just to end the game.
---
Lol that actually scared the shit out of me!
---
Given this, if I was that survivor I’d likely have died irl!
---
Oh maybe that’s why I’m kinda bad so I just drop it and sprint away lol
---
Imagine having this thing coming through window at 12:00 at night

Does anyone have the link to that video? I haven't seen it, I'm new to the dbd community so I'm a bit curious :3

Why i'm making this? His power is VERY boring and VERY basic. I tried to give him more variety to his power. I really hope you guys like it! Please give your opinion

Red Dead Redemption 2[a] is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. The game is the third entry in the Red Dead series and is a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption. The story is set in 1899 in a fictionalized representation of the Western, Midwestern and Southern United States and follows outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang. Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The story also follows fellow gang member John Marston, the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption.
---
The game is presented through both first and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive open world. Gameplay elements include shootouts, heists, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters (NPCs), and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system similar to the "wanted" system from the Grand Theft Auto franchise governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player. Red Dead Redemption 2 was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2018, and for Microsoft Windows and Stadia in November 2019. Red Dead Online, the online multiplayer mode of the game, was released as a beta version in November 2018 before a full release in May 2019.
---
The game's development began soon after Red Dead Redemption's release and was shared between all of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from real locations as opposed to film or art, focused on creating an accurate reflection of the time with the game's characters and world. The game was Rockstar's first built specifically for eighth generation consoles, having tested their technical capabilities while porting Grand Theft Auto V to the platforms. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by Woody Jackson and several vocal tracks produced by Daniel Lanois.
---
Broadly anticipated and marketed before release, Red Dead Redemption 2 broke several records and had the second-biggest launch in the history of entertainment, generating $725 million in sales from its opening weekend and exceeding the lifetime sales of Red Dead Redemption in two weeks. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed at its story, characters, open world, graphics, and considerable level of detail. Considered as an example of video games as an art form, it won year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. It is among the best-selling video games of all time with over 26.5 million copies shipped.

Honestly the blink recharge is way more crippling. You can get away from a nurse by running in a straight line now...

I haven’t earned any 100% cross progression from BHVR but I feel like it will eventually come cause they know it’s something that the community wants. If they decided to allow cross progression they’ll probably do it after they decide how they are going to handle how it’ll work for people who play on multiple platforms already.
---
Is the disk in your drive?
---
Even I have it but I gave up on tome 3, I never finished 2
---
I wouldn’t call the job the devs have done, “their best”. Considering how they fucking bungled some shit like Legion, Pig, and Nurse
---
Yeah it's very risk vs reward but I still run it pretty regularly. It's nice that it counters the speed buff of noed if the killer has it and also if it's a 110 speed killer it can come in even more helpful.
---
Love it as a Kate main. Awesome doodle
---
Just you, the whole team only see it if you're on the hook, just like before.
---
That’s includes hitting skill checks properly and timing the off time correctly if you don’t hit the check.
---
So ima stick with my taps because my skill checks are trash.
---
How do I get those teammates? There's usually 1 guy that suicides on hook or DC's when he's the first to go down.
---
Dailies are a way to encourage people to play regularly. Some games have daily sign-in bonuses, some games have first win of the day bonuses, some games have daily challenges that you'll either miss or max out on if you don't complete them quickly.
---
That’s right now you’re quiet. I win bye bye

---
Lol! I was like WTF? Didn't expect that at all.
---
I find farming boring. One time I got a Ghostface who was farming with everyone but anytime he approached me I ran and played normally. When he caught me, I got hooked, farmed, hooked, farmed and hooked again. I got singled out and eliminated with no recourse just because I didn't sit there and fucking farm with them like a bunch of jokers. 
---
It's stupid and needs to be considered "working with the opposition" and be a bannable offense.
---
Mostly SWF with unevenly ranked friends. Time of the day is a big factor aswell. You get more uneven ranks in the morning and during the day.
---
But it's so helpful to know what your team is up to when someone is on hook, plus the killer aura to know if they are still around or even to find out if they start heading your way.
---
Those 4 incredibly broad statistics they released are literally less than useless without waaaaaay more data to help correlate.
---
Detective's Hunch. The info is invaluable, especially if you run it with a map and the add on that shares auras with your team.
---
Hee hee!
---
That's not bad at all.
---
LOS breaks are the best way to fuck with Nurse.
---
That makes sense to me. Thanks for the info!
---
There was another video where 5 skillchecks appeared and none were hit. It was still faster than gentapping. There's another one where he didn't hit 8 skillchecks and the time was close, its RNG but it was still around the same time. If he had hit at least one of thise skillchecks it wouldve been faster.
---
"im not talking about good streamers like tru"

"FOOKIN DEAD HAR! STREAM SNIPER! TOXIC SWF! ITS THE GAMES FAULT" ect
---
That's not true. Even if it was, there are new add ons that increase blink recharge speed.
---
Weak bait
---
I like how there’s a counter to it (just cleanse) but I agree, the concept of the perk itself is crutch as hell. It rewards failing your objective and can *easily* turn a 0 or 1K game into a 3 or even 4, depending on the totem spawn you get and/or how potato survivors are. 
---
I don’t mind if you bring an Endgame build. But if you’re actively trying to prevent the gens being done (Pop, Ruin, and generally any other meta perks) and then slap on NOED as your 4th perk, that’s just crutch as shit. I won’t get like extremely angry, but it’s just annoying. “You failed your objective, here’s a one hit down”. It’s dumb.
---
There's one killer sided meme for this with "Disrespecting all the palates" somewhere XD

Nothing. I'm playing on PS4

Can someone explain why Haddonfield still needs a fix even after the BL nerf? It’s definitely a lot better now than it was before.
---
IMO, I feel energy would be better invested into fixing Coldwind or Autohaven
---
Oh
---
I've made some really good plays with diversion. I remember when the gates were open and it was only me and another survivor left. It was endgame and the other guy was hooked next to the gates and getting camped by the Trapper while I was hiding nearby, injured. I threw my pebble into the map and cause the Trapper saw I was injured he ran over to check it out only to turn around and see the dude get saved and both of us run out of the exit gates. The perk is awesome
---
Just curious what the main issue with Legion is? Is they over powered, just plain annoying, or something else?
---
I’m a Legion main at Rank 7 rn (have been higher/lower (you know what I mean)) and I freaking love the killer.
---
The extend Intoxication is a good idea, or even some hallucination state would be good as hes drugging you. Cause like the gas is basically useless right now. Canister idea seem to be pushing it a bit too far if your previous comments were a thing. Especially on small maps. Cool ideas tho. Clown just gets treated like a clown, which is bad.
---
A nurse on PS4? That's a surprise! I hope you're not being bullied :)
---
Am I the only survivor who likes Hawkins? The pallets aren’t safe but there’s like a trillion of them
---
Oh yeah definitely. I will never understand the “survivor rule book” that just says “let us win because thats fun”
---
DBD has a unique point that both sides can technically win. It’s all what you justify as a win.
---
But people that see everyone else as “do what I want or I’m gone” are the worst people. They don’t adapt to the situation, everyone else must. They ruin the game for everyone and I don’t get how they can play that way and have fun
---
You could at least post a link to the source.

Having a massive power gap in killers was a problem. Low tier killers like Wraith weren't really easier, they just couldn't compete. Meanwhile Nurse was unstoppable in the right hands. Having challenging characters is good, but that doesn't mean the weaker characters shouldn't be able to compete and it definitely doesn't mean the strong killers should be unbeatable.

according to legends, yes.

I aint gonna lie, i only watch his YouTube.  But i enjoy otz stream better. He actually explains what he is doing and what his plan is

It’s not terrible I love it

Yeah with how buggy the game can be sometimes, DCing is sometimes just the only option
---
This was one below the full post from dbdgone wild. I am amused. Why do you do this to me? Why am I admitting to the world I follow dbdgonewild
---
See the thing is, its the most random map in the game.
---
sometimes i have the easiest most safest loops and at that point its GG.
---
but other times there is literally nothing for survivors to use and you just cant do anything.
---
Its one of the most RNG based maps, but indoor maps are almost always the deadliest since you really dont know where the killer is until they are on top of you. And if you get a GF, its gg.
---
Actually, the whole team sees it no matter who is on hook. It’s a really altruistic perk because it affects the whole team no matter who is hooked.
---
Yeah i went against a huntress that i looped for 2 min without a single pallet. I just ran circles around her and she couldn’t hit me. My teammates finished the gens in that time and she had no Ed and got a 2k.
---
I didn't write back because you are desperate.
---
How do you know everyone is ok with it? It's a one side only decision, when the killer start to farm everyone must do it or die! Only swf team can decide to not farm! Solo player that dont cooperate will have 3 teammates that help the killer find and kill you!
---
patience is the key
---
You know what I mean.
---
While RDR2's development was a shitshow, there's a much larger limit to how many programmers you can have on a game than *12*...
---
The actual issue is having money to hire more programmers full-time, and more importantly having leads capable of managing and coordinating that many more employees. I don't know how much revenue DbD makes but I can guess a common issue is smaller studios incapable of growing and managing more employees.
---
And of course, sometimes game developers are legit bad at their job.
---
Their power is really underwhelming, it doesn't accomplish a lot outside of slowing the game down and it doesn't help down survivors all that well. Also for some reason BHVR continues to change them for the worse, reducing their effectiveness.
---
It's what I'm here for c:

As a futa lover, that subreddit dissapoints me. The futa stuff there is just bad.

Why does every online game community do this? People whine about devs being incompetent yet have no clue how to fix the problems and are usually wrong about something being a problem in the first place.

Thank you now we can start having a conversation. I don’t mean to go on a rant, I apologize. You only mentioned the survivor sided maps not one killer, I  don’t see anything about Hawkins in your message. In my opinion, the game and the hawkins lab are the two most killer sided maps in the game. 
---
I’d give haddonfield a complete rework. The infinite basement is horrid. If you remove that, and change windows to balconies, you then have one of the most killer sided map in the game(there’s only like 5 pallets).
---
I honestly think Hawkins lab was designed to be a killer sided map. With the amount of unsafe pallets, and I don’t mean mindgamable, I mean horseshit pallets. There’s like 50 pallets on the map, only like 3 of which are actually worth looping around or dropping. The game needs less Safe pallets and more vaults. I think there is one/two vaults in the entire map. All the pallets get used in 3 minutes and then everything is a deadzone.  But every pallet is safe. Also I believe they should consider a rework to make it a 1 story map. People ignore the fact that it is tiny for traversal compared to every other map. Also remove god loops and mandatory loop spawns, then balance around that. Also balance the rng of tiles so you don’t have games where every damn tile is a jungle gym or a TL wall.
---
I absolutely LOVE farming games now and then to take a break from regular intense games but I just don’t ever fully trust the killer OR my team mates in that situation
---
Yeah, I get told to get over it too. Like I know I can still play, but it’s just unnecessary stress and toxicity lol
---
I understand what you are trying to say, but highlighting one loop in a map as a reason for a possible DC doesn't really help your case.
---
As for camping and such, I don't know if there ever will be a solution for that. Devs say it's a legit tactic and I have to agree that some games staying close to the hook is the winning play.
---
It feels to me that you are trying to say that the players often make the game unfun, which I agree with you on, thus I think DCing is something that should be dealt with.
---
It's the fucking entity that's what it is
---
Nurse is better then every killer with there best addons when she has no perks or offerings.
---
Exactly the reason why I won't be buying the next battle pass...
---
I know i shouldn't but ill just leave anyways cause it makes me feel so bad. 
---
Now for the challenge i camped someone from first hook to death during egc.
---
You clearly are refusing to accept what I’m saying. You see low Rank and assume it’s a bad player.
---
Mending simulator is not fun. How often do you play against legion? How do you feel in comparison to playing against other killers?
---
Actually, SB is on the rise. Also, Resilience has started to garner some praise. Though Hope and Poised are still not the most cherished perks..,
---
I can see you point with how you believe oni is easier than billy I think they’re probably around the same right now. I don’t really agree in saying the nurse got nerfed, really it just separates the people who relied on addons and the ones who are actually good at nurse. She is as scary as she always has been.
---
Sometimes I wonder why people play this game without watching any videos or streams about it. You'll just be unaware of so many things
---
What the fuck is that
---
Why do some (keyword: some) Memes make it through hex: memeless mode on this subreddit?  They appear to be properly labeled as "shitpost/meme" but they still show up for some reason.

aefiahgka. Thank you for sparing me future hours of frustration! I swear I hate the phrasing of the archive sometimes (I read "using" to mean active not just while equipped).
---
I literally stopped reading at that point in OPs post. Most DCs I encounter are the first downed scenario. And it’s usually because the survivor was cocky and t-bagging at a pallet. Those people deserve a punishment for screwing over the rest of their team.
---
I am a rank 1 killer and survivor for so long.
---
League community is the worst
---
When I do play survivor, I am definitely disappointed when playing against a legion. Not necessarily because she is bad or anything but more because they aren’t as interesting. It’s a similar reaction to the bear-trap dude
---
Omg!! I want the pattern! This is so neat and I don’t know how to do freehand cross stitch yet
---
Who is Ghost face supposed to be? What are you talking about?
---
Everyone calls him ghostface because it's an icon in horror and that's what it's most famously called. What point are you trying to make here?
---
I'm not really sure what they have in mind for the rework but basically all of the indoor maps feel like garbage to play on as either survivor or killer. Taking the time to do some quality of life updates on one of my least favorite maps is much appreciated, hopefully they do something to make the place more navigable, open it up and make it less claustrophobic.
---
You can tell by the fact he watermarks all his stuff on the Twitter page. He watermarks stuff that isn't his, that anyone who can open the game folder can find. It's kind of pathetic.
---
you spelt 20 wrong baby survivor 👶👶👶👶👶👶👶
---
i felt the same way, thought it was pretty funny until that dropped and i'm like 'oh.'
---
I really like it!
---
While shuffling through items/abilities/etc isn't something I think devs will ever do, I think the idea is great. I especially like the embracing tonic which could be used to seal off a larger area which would make it easier for the clown to herd survivor to one direction.
---
The Claudette thought the yui was gonna take the hit for her hilarious.
---
Yes, but I think you must have the add on "Torn Bookmark" which is ultra rare and prevents you from blinking through objects.  Your best best is to get a pull on an injured survivor that is either vaulting a window or a pallet.
---
This achievement got way harder with the nurse change. :/
---
Absolutely not.
---
It isn't a very good perk and you can get it for free by leveling up Claudette.
---
You know how hard it is to float? I can barely float 2 inches. Impressive, but its hardly efficient
---
I feel this with league
---
Yeah I don't get salty over it, it's more like "of course, noed." With an eye roll. It's just disappointing more than anything else like, "Hey I was the better player this game but guess I'll just be punished anyway." Which is boring. I played 4 games last night and the killer had noed in every game and it was 2 Billy's and 2 Ghostface's. Killers with a built in instadown (although GF is obviously not as powerful with his as Billy usually) and still needing noed. And this is red ranks!
---
It also leads to the problem of killers relying to heavily on it and never improving. I
---
“That’s Mettle”
---
I agree with you. The only thing that seems positive about the doc rework is that he won't have to switch modes, but having a 60 second cooldown on his new blast is INSANE.
---
I'm not saying that fun shouldn't be accounted for, but it's not good that they openly stated that this low-tier killer is being reworked for survivors. 
---
I'm not optimistic, but I hope I'm wrong.
---
Yeah sure, can't reson with stupid so sure I'm toxic ;)
---
stinky poop in pant you have 💩💩💩💩💩👶👶👶👶👶👶💩💩💩💩💩💩💩 👳🏾‍♂️✈️🏬🔥🔥🔥
---
I think they said that Page 1 loses its rift bonuses, but you can still get Blood Points from it.
---
The power is not consistent, everything you do, you get a 4 second stun when you stop using it, you literally can't do anything to survivors that are already injured, it's only useful to get a first hit but you'll get looped to hell because you become a normal M1 killer after you've used it
---
Really? It's never effect ed the whole team when I use it unless I'm the one on hook

Nope it's a boosted ass Nea

Tbh it’s really easy to rank up as survivor but there’s no reward anyway. I get rank 1 survivor and killer every season for no reason but longer queue times.

At least there are trade-offs to using the basement. Sometimes you just don't have the time to make it all the way down there, it's not located on the correct side of the map, or there's enough pressure that you flat out can't stand around it waiting for the unhook.
---
The challenges kick it into overdrive forcing you to commit to the Basement when it's not always the best choice.
---
You have to be very dumb if you think that new objetives are gona be a thing if you make it obligatory the survivors are gona cry and they are gona be removed,if the devs do totems 2 nothing is gona a change and if you have something like the nectar of the last halloween the survs are gona cry because nobody is doing gens.

If they DCed on death hook and I'm gonna pip or at least lose nothing, hatch.  
---
If they DCed on stupid shit, sorry friend. Would at least try to give them what they need to pip.
---
Yup, that's what I did when I was doing this ''challenge''. If I start a game and the killer finds me first, and on the off chance 2 generators pop couple of minutes later, I'm 100% dying on the first hook.
---
A lot of these challenges felt like, I'm playing 1v1v1v1v1. The unhook and heals werent bad, but the ''dark sense'', ''noed'' and ''basement'' builds are straight up garbage. And they 100% promote the worst way to play this game. It's just a complete fucking shitshow, because everyone is doing it at the same time.

 You wouldn’t understand
---
Wow thx this community is really nice
---
It says there all installed 😭😭😭
---
Haha no worries. It's still a top tier perk 😁
---
It also immediately breaks pallets when you vault them
---
Yeah, thought I'd try and keep the perks based on their original ones at the moment but yeah, mindbreaker sucks rn
---
Yup 😔
---
Hate is a big word. I love the clown and would consider multiple killers as worse than him
---
There's a pretty big difference between "You must run a healing build with Botany Knowledge and Empathy" and "Kill all four people in the basement."
---
One gives you two perks you have to use and it's up to you to use them effectively. The other forces you into a toxic playstyle.
---
I don't think they're gonna be a thing, but I sure hope they will do something about it
---
I want my David jacket back...
---
agreed.  You have to commit to using it, which encourages survivors to use strategies that work against camping.
---
Great guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goi0knDvpGI). The video is dated, but the spreadsheet is always kept fresh.
---
Be careful about Decisive Strike - it's wholly reliant on you getting caught during its active window *and* hitting a skillcheck. If you can *consistently* hit the DS skill check test [here](https://breakmedown.github.io/dbs-release/) then definitely consider it, but if you find yourself constantly missing it then I'd slot something else instead.
---
How I play Legion is I use the ability it track the survivors after the first hit and I attempt to hit all 4 survivors in one frenzy.
---
I feel the loading time, and  it's even worse for killers.
---
I hate their phrasing too. Some of the missions can be quite literal, like NOED and hooking survivors during the EGC to sacrifice them. However, the ones like TINH, all you need is to bring it into a game and succeed getting those greats. So, I hope you can get them! ^.^ &lt;3
---
Cool, go call someone who's handicapped that and let me know how they feel about it
---
You are correct in assessing me as an emotional, reactionary person.  That is true.
---
But I know I’m this case I’m in the right because I’ve got the upvotes of the hive mind behind me whereas you are being panned.
---
&gt;almost 2020
---
&gt;still thinking The Game is survivor-sided 
---
Pahaha accurate
---
Cruel Limits 1 is a lot worse Bamboozle and Bamboozle sees very little play.
---
Cruel Limit 2 while more interesting is still very bad considering adrenaline boost from being hit gives you enough distance to leave the blocked area. Also 180 second cooldown means you will get to use it only twice or thrice in the trial.
---
Mindbreaker 1 while improving the original one is still something no one would ever use.
---
Mindbreaker 2 just seems like sticking all status effects a perk hoping something gives you an advantage.
---
Sorry, mate. 
---
I agree though that the perks need a buff.
---
Any map is killer sided if you're playing with potatoes.
---
Badham is a very strong survivor map.
---
Nobody is going to pay 7000 BP for an animation
---
Yeah I agree tbh
---
Hitting them is far too delaying, it's totally ridiculous we were able to get away with this
---
Spiderus?
---
Ghost face mains have smol pp
---
When you start from the disk, it doesn't bring up the queue showing all the installed content?
---
These were just initial ideas, plan on doing an updated version soon
---
Yeah, shit like this is why I lost interest a few weeks ago after only starting to play four months ago. Incredibly silly and makes you feel like an absolute pool for playing killer. There's no reason that should be possible, they should be able to just walk right through them pushing them out of the way but I know the devs have said it's an intended part of the gameplay. So it's obviously never going to change.
---
I hover around red ranks and seems to me like only maybe one game out of four has some annoyance.
---
It seriously isn't, go into a kyf and try it.
---
Nurse double blinks and gets a hit on you, then you run in a straight line as far as you can. It takes two more double blinks for her to catch up, and that's best case scenario where her blinks are perfect.
---
That challenge isnt hard
---
But her putrid skin is just. So. Coooooooooooooool.
---
And happy to hear me going for Monitor and Abuse was a good move, I've already got a pretty high-level doctor (much to the chagrin of 1/3 of the survivors I face).
---
If the challenges were written by someone who actually plays the game oci8do bows to their toxic greatness.

Is this only a PC thing? I've only gotten completely invisible pallets one game in my over 1500 hours playing as killer on console
---
Hm, i played a few matches on UL tonight and never found more than 1 safe pallet. Maybe a second if you count the weird middle room where 2 pallets spawn next to each other.
---
The only benefit UL has is that it's easy to break LoS, so against sone of the stronger killers it can be quite good.
---
But if we are counting good loops aside from pallets, then lerys also has some nice spots, like the double vault in the office, or the center part with the windows on top.
---
I'd still take lerys over hawkings every day of the week.
---
&gt;Well well well, if it ain't the invisible cunt
---
cruel limits 2 the fuck is a loop lol
---
Glad my Doctor's already well on his way to 30, in that case.
---
Yeah at that point, that’s 100% their fault
---
Spine chill is great, but I prefer premonition.
---
It's calculated based on a few things, how well you defend gens, how quickly you win chases, how many hooks etc. 
---
For example if you kill everyone with an ebony you ain't getting any pips that game despite killing everyone. Best games are the ones you can try to make last. Try and hook everyone at least a couple of times before they die. As in don't camp someone on their first hook because you'll lose out and better teams will just do gens and you'll be left with a 1k.
---
Quit the game if you don’t like how they are running it. Rate it 1 star everywhere you can. If you think they are handling the game wrong, make them notice.
---
No. It is not a terrible perk for sure, but it is too weak compared to the meta perks, relies on you being able to find teammates to heal, and you can get it from leveling Claudette, who is a free character.
---
You don't need to get all the hooks in the base, just the killing hook.
---
You can get bad spawns or maps, but it can just come naturally if you bring carry perks and let the survivors feel like they have a chance.
---
No need to camp. Just keep track of hooks.
