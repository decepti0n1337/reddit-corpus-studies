With his toxic behavior, he ain't giving u tips.

---
True but dance with me naturally combos with lithe both having the same duration IIRC.
---
Lmao he‚Äôs so broken he can hit a survivor while breaking a pallet. Can hillbilly do that? nope
---
As killer allow the survivors to all hatch escape. It gives the trophy to the killer also. Source, how I got mine on Ps4.
---
Omg I'm using the exact same laptop rn
---
Why?
---
it happens every single time, him and nurse lunge. so stupid.
---
BBQ and chili from leatherface is a must have for killers. Don't count on it coming up in the shrine because I think it appeared on the shrine one time ever and that was very recently so it won't be back for a while most likely. Besides that leather face is on of the worst killers in the game. I would only recommend getting him for the BBQ and chili perk.
---

---
Freddy's perks are whatever but Freddy himself is very very fun and is not add-on reliant like some killers. So you don't have to pour points into him to be able to keep playing him.
---
Amanda is ok. Decent killer killer decently fun. Add-ons don't really change they way you play, except for the ultra rare letter add-on, but they will more so do something to the survivors with traps. like status effects while trapped or more jigsaw boxes or harder skill checks. "Surveillance" and "make your choice" are both great perks for almost any killer.
---
When I'm rocking premonition I'll often point to where the killer is because why not, may as well let them know too, right? After a few guys ran in that direction, I realized I should probably just stop.
---
I mean, it doesn't get you that far, and it's a bit inconsistent (not as bad as before though)
---
It just doesn't come close to the others imo
---
But not too much time
---
Nice
---
I don‚Äôt use noed but I don‚Äôt have a problem with the perk or adrenaline. I think both are fine and people complain about both too much
---
I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because their not enough red rank people on ps4 so their transfer to the green to purple ranks or swf
---
Ez 360 lmao what a guy
---
I can definitely say it's better than Sprint Burst, but Lithe forces you out of your first loop. Sometimes that's good, sometimes it's bad.
---
#bunnyfengwhen
---
Lolololol
---
I feel like instaheals and instadowns can't really be held to the same standard.
---
An instaheal is a way of directly taking away progress on a killer's objective with little effort.
---
An instant down is more of directly adding to progress on a killer's objective, with an amount of effort that varies based on killers/perks.
---
But if we really are just looking at them as opposites in such a way where one quickly adds a health state, and the other quickly removes another health state, then they still can't be held to the same standard. Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical game, thus the abilities of survivors and killers should not and cannot be equal.
---
I get I'm taking a shitpost a little too seriously, but the arguments between things available to survivors and killers comes from a very poor mindset around balancing an asymmetrical game.
---
SHUT THE FUCK UP. I WILL NOT DEAL WITH ANYMORE TRAPPERS THAN I HAVE TO.
---
This happens with every killer, yet people still downvote you on here unless you are a youtuber or streamer. In which case, they suck your dick and suddenly all rally behind you to complain about the broken lunges in the game.
---
Iremind me 1 hour
---
HOW COME WHENEVER THERES A TRAPPER I CAN STRUGGLE 27 TIMES AND STILL NOT BE FREE? EVEN THE KILLER MESSAGED ME SAYING THAT WAS ROUGH. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.
---
exhaustion add ons for killer in my opinion are bullshit
---
No I mean ‚Äúcurving‚Äù as in cutting loops short by using his high sensitivity at the start of his sprint around the long side of a loop
---
Never gonna happen. They are not going to add an underaged survivor.
---
Thank you. Apology accepted

CLAUDETTES HEALING ALL GAME INSTEAD OF DOING GENS
---
This game already -is- casual... ranking up doesn't mean much of anything like it can in other games. You don't get unique cosmetics or bloodpoint boosts or etc. That being said, yeah, removing SWF isn't the right option, but maybe instead of averaging it out it takes the best of the ranks in the SWF and matches them with a killer of that tier.
---
I actually love this meme format so much
---
Nice build, swap in prove thyself every once in a while, im sure you'll like it
---
Nice head on play!
---
Ha! For real.
---
Okay, but this perk would take it all the way to 30%. It would make medium vaults happen at fast vault speeds, and not even take a token away because you don‚Äôt have the right angle.
---
I mean realistically, all that's left to nerf is SWF, an that will just plain never happen.
---
So what if it is?
---
Dont play ps4 then. Sorry but the matchmaking is bad on pc, but its so much worse on ps4
---
Made with m**good heavens**
---
Remove the  "Play as Survivor" and "Survive with Friends" options or I'm uninstalling.
---
We all know the best addon is VHS porn
---
Haha üòÅ
---
The best imo with monitor and abuse is the Pig in combination with whispers. It allows for you to when whispers goes off crouch and sneak up on the survivors completely undetected due to monitors reduction of terror radius. In general most killers will benefit from monitor and abuse but for Pig it is a must use perk
---
I made it neutral.
---
pig,huntress,nurse if you don't need the fov. but monitor is never a bad perk on any killer
---
This Perk build should be a good start - thanataphobia bbq stbtl ruin
---
Any killers that you can really take advantage of being closer than survivors think you actually are.
---
**Nurse** is fairly strong with M&amp;A, new **Huntress** now that her Lullaby is no longer directional. **Plague** against survivors that don't cleanse or **Legion** against survivors that don't heal. You can use M&amp;A to walk around the map as **Pig** without being crouched and paired up with Whispers only enter stealth when the perk lights up (like t.tv/Scorpionz does).
---
I know your weakness... like your trick knee!
---
But. .....I just bought leatherface lol
---
Nah nah nah here are some reasons that 
---
No Mither is the most op perk 
---
-No blood pools for ez get aways
---
-Has a built in Iron will (saves a slot)
---
-Works well with Dead hard, (don‚Äôt need to get hit for it to be active) Resilience, and TINH (So those pesky friends don‚Äôt keep healing you from these great perks)
---
-Deliverance has no drawbacks 
---
-Friends with Empathy can always see you
---
-Can get up from dying more than once (Take take Unbreakable!)
---
-A counter to slug build
---
-Works well with Tenacity and FlipFlop
---
-Counters Plag‚Äôs normal spit 
---
-Doesn‚Äôt need to worry about Hex:Haunted grounds
---
-Stalking killer‚Äôs expose effects have no effect 
---
-Nurses Calling would be useless (unless some loser tries to get you up but you can do that by yourself)
---
-Can immediately know if Thanaophobia is in play
---
-And is just an ultimate flex
---
Thanks for reading this important message by me
---
Clown: *screams in porn addiction*
---
Wish his gameplay was as good as your drawing
---
I think the overall point there is:  balance.  Killers have more consistent access to instant downs than Survivors do with instant heals because the Killer is squaring off with 4 survivors every trial, and arguably needs that extra strength to compete.  The problem, however, is when players don't see that as balance.  Killers don't see how strong they are compared to survivors, because they are facing 4 survivors, but that is the WHOLE POINT.  Just like survivors alone aren't shit to a Killer, which is the WHOLE POINT.
---
Is it because you want to play tougher killers? Load up DBD on PC and use your Xbox/ps controller
---
Oh yea that's kinda rough I haven't gone against it a whole lot so I can't really give a good opinion about that
---
My dad always said, the mark of a truly good player is when they screenshot their rank 1 because it's that big of a deal to hit it once
---
Yeah and for noed you have to get 85/8075% of the maximum hooks. Sound good? No.
---
No but I do care if they see my drug trafficking and human slave trade transactions.
---
I know I know, "just close your laptop" but hey, Bjorn likes his synthwave junk pumping while he splits the coke.
---

---
Im with ya
---
I just checked, you right chief
---
Take spine chill over resilience, dont take hope
---
Never saw them either but they are cannibals and were always locked inside their house.
---
Yes they did, lmao
---
Facts
---
What ones?
---
Yeeep. Also if memory serves discordance is the one perk in the game that actually gets worse the more ranks you get of it.
---
Yes it does. Might run that with Hag.
---
I use Hag with Monitor. Turns your 24 meter TR into 16 meters not in a chase, same as a base EW2 Myers. You can use this for getting closer before survivors decide to run when moving to a gen, or combo it with Nurse's Calling to even further throw off savvy survivors doing the "If you hear the TR stop healing since they might have Nurse's Calling" technique. (Nurse's Calling tier 3 is 28 meters. Base killer TR is 32 meters. 16 meter TR allows you to get close and they'll have no idea you're nearby or can see them)
---
New killer?
---
When Blendettes become one with the terror radius instead of the surroundings
---
True tho I hate playing against him lol

---
&gt;or you can bring unbreakable? how many times is the killer gonna fall for it?
---
With Unbreakable he will down you a second time and a teammate will have to drop whatever he is doing to pick you up. With No Mither that doesn't happen. 
---
You would be surprised how many times killers try this before they realize they can't unhook you.
---
it doesn‚Äôt need a full rework though, just make recovery 5-10 seconds so killers can‚Äôt even leave you on ground for a second. wouldn‚Äôt stack with flip flop obviously

If this is on console, well, there you go.

---
I don't know.  I'm P3 Jake, and I'd estimate I've completed around 260 - 300 bloodweb pages, and have only ever had something like 6 syringes.  Honestly I highly doubt you get one in every other bloodweb.  The ultra rares I see the most are keys and maps.
---
What are pastel perks?
---
but no mither on its own is generally unfun. seeing it in the meta, it‚Äôs the worst, i‚Äôm just saying that a buff would be great. has potential to be a game bending perk.
---
My farming (Dwight) build is usually:
---
Prove Thyself (bonus for teamwork makes sure you get the max objective + helps get altruism points faster if healing with someone else)
---
We're Going to Live Forever (for the obvious stacks).
---
Deliverance (+1000 survival for unhook, if SWF, makes it easier to get to max survival without wiggling out a bunch of times).
---
Borrowed Time (to give killer extra points for hits, and to ensure WGLF stacks and Deliverance).
---
I fucking hate the meme subs
---
That was lag, you can tell by the teleport back that you got, unlucky.
---
J jonah jameson
---
Its a p good generalization imo I personally have always felt that Pig and Plag are hella slept on (personal bias sure) but after all the whack nerfs to Pig it‚Äôs understandable
---
who in their right minds slugs a no mither??? never in my entire 400 hours have i ever been slugged as a no mither ( i don‚Äôt use it much though) i‚Äôm saying it should be buffed, i don‚Äôt know why you got all riled up
---
Definitely didn't but ok.
---
Yes!
---
Legion is fun but I only ever black pip (Thanks blood warden) or double pip (Thanks ruin). There is no in between. Single pips and down pips just cease existing with them.
---

---
Can you read my dude?
---
With coordination and experience it can easily let you escape a chase, plus it allows for mindgames when you hop in a locker. The killer tends to spent alot of time trying to bait you out. Also with dance with me it works amazingly
---
Yes a perfect game, where ruin gets found before any gens are done
---
she jumped out of the 4th story and landed on concrete eagle eye view
---
I thought the Smiley pin inflicts Mangled on Survivors on their first hit..
---
I know that but thanks.

How do band work on ps4?

He is the chosen one our savior has arisen rejoice in his almight presence. For jeff formaly know as jesus has come to shred and bring us to the chosen land.
---
F
---
I guarantee you can buy and level bubba before it shows up in the shrine again
---
I personally think it doesn‚Äôt need to be game bending and i feel that they should work on reworking meta/ op perks first ie adrenaline and NOED before buffing more under used/ meme perks
---
i was genuinely confused why you were asking if i could read something called my dude. hahaha i was staring at it for like 40 seconds.
---
Indeed
---
it has so much potential though. also, adrenaline and noed don‚Äôt need changes. for noed, do the fucking bones, for adrenaline, once all gems are powered you shouldn‚Äôt suddenly get a 4k. you already failed as a killer if you didn‚Äôt get a single kill in 5 gens.
---
Get a load of that big lad
---
I'M SAD THAT A LOT OF STREAMERS ARE HAVING NO FUN PLAYING DBD. ANGRY :(
---
Not even the killer is safe out in these woods folks...
---
Thanks, now I have to watch all of the videos yet again, and enjoy them as always.
---
Brb in an hour.

 I got a pig head and a good time. YOU‚ÄôRE NOT TAKING IT AWAY FROM ME JEFF.
---

---
They‚Äôre definitely not slept on because there‚Äôs nothing to sleep on. Look at all of the killers above them. With the exception of ghostface and myers, they all have some sort of antiloop/force loop to end. Plague gets hard looped. Pig gets pretty hard looped too. Trying to use her ability to antiloop?... guess I‚Äôll just run to a different pallet while you waste time to stand back up
---
In their defense.... If the survivors does not dies on the second hook, you are quite likely doing something wrong... And mori just speeds-up the process
---
For the past month or so, every match I have been part of as killer or survivor has had teabaggers in it.
---
So rude.
---
Can't imagine how it can be buffed. Should remove the injured music and maybe give a BP bonus. If it started you healthy and only prevented you from healing after the first hit it'd make it harder to get use out of when the match starts. (Injured build would require you to throw yourself at the killer and somehow get away after being hit once.
---
Maybe if you still started injured, but attacks first inflict deep wound on you if you're not already deep wounded, and THEN the next hit downs you, effectively still giving you two health states. 
---
My only issue is since mending is only 15 seconds (Compared to Self Care taking like 30) it may result in a "No Mither Meta" where everyone will run it as it'd effectively give you immunity to insta-downs (You'd just go into deep wound) and you can get your "health" state back faster with mending compared to Self-Caring.
---
She was likely using her power, which leaves a husk standing still. Why do y'all instantly assume a SPIRIT is camping when that's how her power works?
---
[removed]
---
That‚Äôs usually what happens here unfortunately
---
... but you‚Äôre not complaining about the hag traps?
---
That sounds really funny and could lead to some really great meme set ups lol
---
Change the button inputs so the R1 buttons are different, that way you can heal yourself or others under pallets.
---
I see way more insta downs than insta heals tbh
---
Oh I had this once! It‚Äôs funny
---
As a feng main, i need a bunny feng lol

The downside is they don‚Äôt work at all if your awake.

---
Ah the age old dillemma.
---
Do you let people on the internet have an opinion or do you ask for their rank and get it over with?
---
There's a reason a lot of top players use Dead Hard. It's not only considered an Exhaustion Perk but a Second Chance perm
---
That is... so far from correct
---
This is the only good comment on this post. Everyone else go home
---
I believe it‚Äôs meant to be an upcoming area or interface in the game that allows players to view survivors lore (it may also be for killers I‚Äôm not sure) For example on the 3rd Year Anniversary stream they showed images of Claudette as a young girl. I believe there was also going to be challenges or something like rituals in Archives but once again I‚Äôm unsure.
---
Wait wtf is this confirmed? Please be joking
---
Both perks activate if you are not exhausted. Head on activates when you sprint out of a locker, so they both activate at the same time.
---
Brother, I'm going to need that clip.
---
i never understood some survivors' logic, you got so much distance between you 2 there and you decide to camp the next pallet you find?
---
But I see Kate denson every day.
---
4 totems in one corner would be great
---
Yeah some of the streamers said it was, they got to see it early
---
Every time I get sandbagged its by a Feng, or a Jeff. Never anyone else.
---
Yah it‚Äôs normally those special types who think they are hot shit at the game when they get someone finally and then camp them while waiting for the others to show up to get extra kills, then you have the assholes who send messages after wiping your team out saying we sucked and that my SWF team needs to get good, when we all were random solo players and he was on a McDonald‚Äôs WiFi connection and the game lagged the hole time which gave him a advantage over us! 
---
I so can‚Äôt wait for dedicated servers to come online and the killers who rely on their trash internet for kills will finally see at how bad they truly are at playing killer and will remain in the 18-20 ranks...
---
That‚Äôs happened to me too, it was pretty helpful during swf.
---
Your 1st comment was better

Rank literally means nothing. You are even playing Nurse and complaining? get out of here

---
SHITTY GHOSTFACE.
---
Yeah just looked it up and the streamer was wrong. Its a lore thing
---
It‚Äôs absolutely possible to lag switch, so yes.
---
Well I was doing a daily anyways with nurse, rank does mean a lot especially the skill cap with different players and players, and I was mostly complaining about rank not me doing horrible in the round which I did
---
You're mad enough to suggest something that doesn't need to be added because you don't like it when people tbag. Tbagging isn't always toxic in this game. Sometimes tbagging and pointing can be used as laughter. It can be used as a hello to a survivor. IF YOU HATE TBAGGING SO MUCH THAT YOU WANT IT TO BE PUNISHABLE, PLAY CHECKERS.
---
I told the killer that and I sacrificed
---
TBH I believe instaheals are much more powerful than instadowns (except for that aberration called Iridescent Head, or how I call them: "Flying NOEDs"). An instaheal can fuck up the whole trial for a killer while an instadown usually means survivors will have a harder trial, also many instadowns can be countered in multiple ways.
---
On a related topic, Moris are undeniably the strongest Addon/Item in this game. I strongly believe both Moris and Instaheals should be waaay rarer. Also, Cyperss moris are useless, Ivory moris are balanced, Ebony moris are nearly cheating.
---

---
I see a lot of drawings on this subreddit but this one actually impressed me.
---
One of my favorite "I'm angry, I fucking hate the survivors and want them to suffer as much as possible" builds is Doctor with Unnerving, Distressing, Overcharge, and a fourth perk (Normally BBQ but for extra misery maybe Sloppy Butcher, Dying Light, Thanatophobia, Franklin's Demise, NOED, Infectious Fright, etc.) combined with double calm addons and a jigsaw piece and 3-gen from the start.

Level hag or LF 1st if you want perks for BBQ/Ruin
---
Hag is the stronger killer of the two if you know what youre doing
---
Spirit is pretty good and has an enjoyable power. Her perk haunted ground pairs perfectly with ruin, and her perk spirit fury is great for chases.
---
Haha funny 2012 meme
---
This is fake, no killer would ever slug a No Mither!
---
Jokes aside, nice job on the escape.
---
I genuinely do not see how Lithe can extend a chase more than Dead Hard
---
You see i already thought about this, but given that totems are still cleansed without interruption and that totem cleansing is pretty damn easy, plus it is a limited range in which only one or two of these interactables are affected plus the fact that the magician has to manually place and pick up marks and swf being an ultimate counter to the gen issue. They also can't place the marks mid chase which makes it a prep perk for pallets, also when you run out of totems the power is gone, his power is basically an extended ruin, as it slows the game down a little bit. The most broken perk combo is likely going to be Hex: Thrill of the Hunt, Hex: Haunted Ground, Bamboozle and BBQ'n'chili.
---
Bubba may be bottom tier but he is simple and mindless fun if you don't take the game too seriously
---
I think where onto them
---
Why were you playing with a controller?
---
he‚Äôs planning on sandbagging Quentin later
---
?
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main I will say I‚Äôm not a bad killer I just prestiged my billy so he‚Äôs level ~20
---
Rank literally means everything. The difference in difficulty between a green rank and red rank nurse is abysmal.
---
Sneaky fellows they are
---
I, for one, welcome our new unreachable overlords
---
Ah got it. Also I'm joking btw we all have bad games
---
No need to be an ass. He simply got better survivors
---
Honestly, will never know seeing as the clip cut to the hook about to stab her right after the spirit sat there.
---
Bro thank you, that means a lot
---
A good example of this would be :You and a survivor are fleeing from a killer towards a pallet, they get past the pallet first and drop it before you can get to the other side so you're cut off and the killer then catches you, the intention is to fuck you over so the killer gets you and they escape, sandbagging is basically fucking over a teammate in a way that shifts the killers focus onto you instead of them.
---
Had it happen twice today, they need to rework it along with some other perks that need some changes.
---
Lol it looked like a clean hit to me
---
Yeah..
---
I'm rank 3 survivor and i face spirit nurse and Billy. I run DS/q&amp;q, iron will, dead hard/balanced, unbreakable/adrenaline. I change my build depending the situation. If i play with friends i swap iron will for borrowed. When i was purple rank I'd play against noed so my build was DS,DH, adrenaline and hope. Purple/green ranks, self care was a must.
---
Ah huntress lullaby, the version of ruin that takes hooks to proc and gets cleared before you can even use it.

Preach

Honestly I‚Äôd buy him they are doing a rework possibly in the next chapter or patch and looking at the past couple shrines it‚Äôll be a bit before u get bbq
---
Quick and simple ghostface tips:
---
ALWAYS lean to stalk people. Every. Single. Time. It reduces your hitbox, making you harder to spot, and it stalks them way faster.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to use crouch, a lot of new ghostfaces neglect it and get spotted because of it.
---
You talking mad shit for someone in iridescent head distance
---
I really wanna see the spirit before she was brutally murdered, I wonder if we'll see their relationships too.
---
I look at their faces all the time? I love doing close ups for fun on gens or on doors.
---
I got it early with bill. Got lucky but besides him yes I've leveld prolly around the same amount of bloodwebs on other characters but nothing.
---
Dwight &gt;&gt;&gt; Blendete
---
How?
---
That would be sick. Sell them for half the price or something. I have an absurd amount of stuff on characters I don't use, or stuff that I don't want to use like bloodpoint offerings outside of Survivor Pudding/Escape Cake/Bloody Party Streamers. I have way too many common offerings that I have no desire to use ever
---
I really want it because I‚Äôm usually a solo player and sometimes can get paired up with some ‚Äúquestionable survivors‚Äù who don‚Äôt save.
---
Still not sure on gf/myres personally but yeah I agree with the other two
---
Because it‚Äôs the only killer perk capable of stalling gen progression in an actually meaningful way?
---
*ahem* ***left behind***
---
That would be funny. Or 5? Ruin, blocked by Devour hope. Blocked by haunted ground, blocked by thrill of the hunt?

Quentin imo

They said they wanna do Doctor and Nurse first, then the chainsaw guys, and then Pig and Legion in terms of addons.
---
That's a long time away and very unlikely they're going to do it "in the next patch".
---
I watched that movie the other day, I loved the reference, thank you.
---
Maybe bad on Doctor but I use it on every killer but him and Nurse.
---
I virtually never see map offerings outside of farm offerings. I think out of the total of about 150 levels on my Ghostface, I got two Lery's offerings. That's more than 3.5mil. The map offerings are way too rare
---
Well the percentages allow me to be a closer or farther for varrying aura reading perks. If im "Tryharding" Im not gonna be very altruistic and it was distortion before distortion.
---
I've tried using DH, and I don't like it. Switched back to Lithe. Now this may be me sucking with DH or not using it enough to really appreciate it enough, but I find Lithe plus BL (for reduced stagger, not the speed burst) allows me to extend loops a lot more, but it's very map specific.
---
Usually it's a well timed vault (speed burst) to get me to high ground where I can then take the killer on an up and down loop (like on Ormond). This obviously doesn't work very well on maps like Coldwind or Autohaven.
---
This combined with the speed burst from the first killer hit allows me to loop way longer, and a lot of the time a killer will bail on the chase if I get up high again. I'm only rank 8, btw.
---
With DH I'm sure I have a lot to learn, but the little nudge forward and dodging one hit doesn't seem to benefit me that much, because it doesn't give me enough distance. I am open to being educated on the advantages of DH.
---
Honestly I feel like rarity is a big problem with toxicity and general screams of "OP".
---
Moris aren't OP, but they are kind of frustrating to go up against. Nothing game breaking, but usually you can just go about the next game and move on. They're rare, right?
---
Notta. Just because one Killer only has one, doesn't mean that the next two to three killers don't decide to use one either. Rarity only affects how much you, the player, can enjoy using that item, not how many times you run into that item on the other side. I remember playing 7 games in a row where there were three Insta-heals on the Survivor side prior to MoM being nerfed.
---
What's worse, the rarity of add-ons locks the Killers out of specific build styles (Jumpscare Myers, as the big example). If I like to play Trapper but only when I have Iri Stone, I'm SOL for 90% of the time on if I want to play Trapper or not. Alternatively, Ninja or Bodyblock Hag is entirely dependent on if you throw enough BP into it or not.
---
Out of everything that holds this game back, I feel like Rarity is definitely one of them. At least tying into the Bloodweb, since you can go 30+ blood webs without getting the item you want.
---
Gives you time to go to another loop. I play killer a lot and 8/10 times they use dh it doesnt work and its very obvious when a surv has dh
---
DID YOU REPORT LAURIE FOR WORKING WITH THE KILLER
---
I think BBQ has only appeared on the shrine 2 times in 2 years? Correct me if I'm wrong! You're probably better off buying him and getting BBQ. A really great investment to help ease the game grind! Franklin's also isn't too bad.
---
Not if he's the killers
---
It's not fair that killers have unique skills, they should all be tier 1 Michael Myers.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, the game shouldn't end until all four survivors are hooked at once.
---
And, you should always be able to Kobe off your first hook.
---
And second.
---
Just wait, restart the app. It may need to be confirmed. If it goes through and you don't get them, chargeback on the card
---
Ahhh, yes, I remember when I was messing around with Plunderer's, got an Engineers Toolbox (I already had a pink map, so I didn't want to take it), and I motioned for a Meg to follow me to it in the basement. She went down there, and I think assumed I was going to loot it, so she ran. Really could have helped get the last gen done faster, then she would have lived :(
---
I'm a survivor main. I would **HAVE** camped you for that bullshit.
---
All the exhaustion times with Vigil are wrong. It increases recovery by 20%, not reduces the overall time.
---
So it's 60/1.2 = 50 seconds, and etc. 
---
This is assuming you're recovering 1 charge of exhaustion per second, which means vigil makes it 1.2/1.15/1.2
---
Aye nearly 3 years ago. I highly doubted we would regress that much.
---
You're attempting to tunnel people on the hook back down before they even count as being unhooked.  The devs added invisibility frames during the unhook process to basically punish players like you.  My advice.  Hit the unhooker as they approach the hook, they'll unhook, then hit the unhooker again (they won't make it 2 steps from the hook).  This way you aren't trash tunneling players while also not having to deal with borrowed time or decisive.
---
There‚Äôs not actual incest in the movie itself but leatherface is a product of incest yes.

Here's the definition. "A lag switch is a piece of equipment installed on a¬†home network¬†that temporarily delays the flow of traffic to the internet. In an online gaming context, the physical toggle can be switched on to delay gameplay to give the lag switcher the upper hand."
---
I hate playing bubba so much but I need muh bbq
---
NO BECAUSE THE LAURIE WAS PROBABLY PISSED THAT I DIDNT HEAL HER BECAUSE I DIDNT WANNA FALL FOR THE SLUG BAIT OR SHE THOUGHT THE KILLER WANTED TO FARM
---
Exactly why i got when it was on the shrine like 2 weeks ago lol
---
Or just T3'ing as Myers on EVERY healthy survivor when there was old MoM. Good times, well worth the stalk
---
im way too high for this pic rn
---
Survivor: OoO, Adrenaline, BL and DS with insta heal and Strode's key offering
---
Killer: depends who am I playing 'cause i always use the most broken add-ons if i wanna sweat my ass off
---
Yeah but its a perk suggestion so i was thinking ruin/devour, haunted, thrill and the totem moving perk
---
This is literally only useful againt bbq on its last use...
---
Same bruh
---
Omg thanks i reset my Xbox and it worked thank you.
---
I don't recall if it was said in the movies but it is generally assumed that it was an inbred family. Leatherface himself is loosely based off of the famous serial killer Ed Gein. The original 1974 movie was very disturbing. I strongly recommend it if you are into slashers like Halloween and Friday the 13th.
---
I've waded through cesspools loke this on the internet, and this by far is one of the more enjoyable ones.
---
Yeah, about that isn't it useless since the EGC
---
Wait really? I was told it reduced the overall time? Where did fact check this I'm very confused now
---
Basically play him exactly like you would play Myers. Stalk from mid range, from a bit away while survs are unhooking, during chases like when a pallet is dropped in front of you, just make sure to only 95% his expose on survivors though, don't fully pop it until you're in a situation where you can for sure hit them while they're exposed. Too many people that are new to him just fill the meter up all the way entirely too early and it gets wasted. Plus remember to use his power instantly at the start of trials, there's no reason not to. Most times survivors aren't paying enough attention to their surroundings so you can easily just walk up on someone's blind spot from behind a tree or something and get your stalk off if you're sneaky enough.
---
Use stealth to sneak up, lean so you don't get exposed, 99 then pop when close
---
This is me when i have time
---
This, but you can achieve it artificially with no physical hardware as well. Forcing your internet bandwidth to prioritize over the game is one easier way.

How do you do that, in Controls it says "action" wouldn't mean heal and drop pallet are both actions?
---
Well camping is good with him in some situations but I don't recommend it I'd say sneak up to gens if you can, the reason I'm saying if you can is 1, Ghostface gets countered hard by spine chill, premonition and OoO and 2, Ghostface is just naturally loud with his footsteps also if it's a open map stealth is even harder. Basically what I'm saying is hope the survivors don't have anti stealth perks,get a decent map with some cover(or get bad survivors) learn the best hiding spots near generators for easy stalks and camp if the teams rush hooks

Oh I didn't know that that, thanks for adding on to what I said hopefully it helps the guy understand it.

Trap all totems teleport for yoinks and insta down unhooking survivors and rotate survivors on and off the hook until devour hope gets up then Mori them all

Speaking of Moris I also play the Trapper.  Almost every 4th bloodweb has had an Ebony Mori for me.  I'm only level 34, and I've already used two, have 4 more in inventory, and two in my current bloodweb.

Curious, what would your solution be?
---
You want to know why you see Dead Hard on all the top streamers and what not? Because it makes for amazing content creation. They certainly don't run it for it's reliability or sheer strength. They run it because it makes the killer look foolish and makes them look like gods.
---
It's still a useful perk but it's not amazing. It's like 360'ing. Extremely good against unskilled killers but you'll probably only get to do it once, maybe twice against someone who knows  that's your plan.

They could make Coraline older like as if she has grown past what happened  and then gets sucked back into the problem.

Only activated by the time the last gen is done?  I had a match a while back (my first encounter with Tombstone) where Myers killed me roughly 5 minutes in.  We had only completed 3 gens.
---
YesüëçOr Trapper could put his totems at the back of the basement then load the place with traps

There are multiple interaction kind of controls, whatever is the button for gen repair is the same as self care. Whatever is for pallets is for windows and lockers too. Make it so that these 2 buttons are different.

Shouldnt feel like that, i mean we win some and we also lose some.. oh yeah im a killer main so i undestand
---
It's usually means just slowing your team down in some way like hiding in lockers or not knowing what your supposed to be doing. 
---
Fucking over your teammates is just toxic.
---
I like "The Legion Pin," it's the addon I use every game if I have it.
---
i swear every time a bill unhooked me today which was like 8 games in a row, and when they don't have borrowed time I'm like HOW
---
I down them once and let them crawl away, If they're stupid enough to tempt fate twice that's when i hook them. If for whatever reason they get out and come back a third time, that's what the mori is for.
---
its a retcon
---
For some reason I thought I would open to Nea with entity claws coming out of her back, that'd be pretty sick. This is a fun piece of art though!
---
I died lol.
---
If you are in 15-20 ranks as survivor you are going to see this. Killers are rewarded for face camping in these ranks (inexperienced survivors) and punished for it starting at the 10ish ranks. If it makes you feel better, killers that are face camping are only making their life harder for when they eventually reach rank 10ish. They will hate their lives sooner or later.
---
You would though, because you‚Äôre a cunt too
---
I would switch make your choice for dying light

I didn‚Äôt realize 70% of the internet were clown mains.

You know, yeah, the frame rate is a pretty big giveaway, huh ... 
---
Not gonna lie, saw the button prompt and assumed. That said, I still think Boil Over is way better on console. 
---
I haven't played on console much since 2.0, but wiggle effects were severely more of an issue that required creative movement to avoid. On PC, mouse control allows for significantly easier directional corrections, while it's much harder with a controller. IMO, anyway.
---
They dissed my perks üòÇ

ty!! This was definitely self-indulgence art of him so I‚Äôm glad others like it too haha

If you haven't seen it yet you should check out the DBD Parody series on youtube by Samination. That was what gave me the idea (though the nea=killer/entity meme has been around a lot longer as far as I know).
---
I HATE HUNTRESS, STOP SINGING YOU PIECE OF SHHHHHH
---
I was expecting "NOED bad"
---
I seriously dislike the ranking system. I'd call myself a rank 5, but I don't play often enough to keep myself at that rank, so whenever I do decide to play, I find the matches way too easy/boring/frustrating.
---
I mean yeah, I'm used to losing and I'm okay with it. But for some reason multiple gens being done at once just feels like a punch in the gut. I don't think the game is unfair or unbalanced or anything, it's just that when I see two or three gens pop in a short amount of time I feel like a fucked up way worse than I do when the gens are done steadily over time, even if there's really no difference in the amount of time it takes survivors to do the generators.
---
Lmao you didn't know you have to run no mither, self care, unbreakable, adrenaline, and a purple medkit with two insta heals. You know so you can have fun

seems like a really low rank issue then

I have 178 red but for some reason I only have 39 green and 80 yellow be nice if the red were was more rare then the green and yellow

Wait, that might be a little to op man. That might be the new meta

Seeing this makes me wish for a ‚Äúbasic info‚Äù post to be pinned on this sub, or regularly reposted, idk.

Recently I‚Äôve been experimenting with my perks

I run boil over, Dark sense, DS and the Jeff perk where you break the hook. Just haven‚Äôt found the right set up for me yet.

denying ghostfaces stalk is not easy

I personally run balanced landing, self care, adrenaline, bond (if I'm playing solo)

If not solo I run everything just stated except for bond, I usually put what ever perk there I want to at the time but I plan on putting ds there.
---
No, you can't prestige past p350
---
Hahaha what a scrub streamer. I love tossing streamers on those hooks :)
---
Hopefully.
---
As a billy main l saw it , its a bug were you hit a survivor with a chainsaw and it would break the pallet and down the survivor
---
ok so it is funny because samination made it and if you actually took the time to watch it you would know that it is a running gag
---
Oh shit good to know
---
Thanks man, it does look pretty cool
---
Everyone knows where it comes from but that doesn‚Äôt mean the gag is funny. 
---
It‚Äôd be like if everyone spammed ‚Äújust a little bit‚Äù every time anyone ever said the word Ruin.

You can do it to Spirit too

artist credit please
---
People have been saying this for years, buckle up
---
Damn ur so good pls teach me ur ways
---
Honestly I just use them to get the trophy on ps4. Too bad I'm never gonna run into a team of 4 survivors what won't have atleast one d/c.
---
Yea it use to be faster
---
Good to know that you think not getting what you want in a video game is the equivalent of a little girl having her family taken from her by ICE.
---
How dare you suggest that I've ever been bad!!!  Yeah I still make dumb choices now and again.
---
You can still level, just not prestige.
---
Oh, I see I don‚Äôt like how they changed mettle of man but I could see why they did it.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Careful you don't get friction burn, jacking yourself off that hard

Thanks didn't know about this

Yea it was pretty op but they nerfed it into the grave

It does and I hate it. Damn kids on my lawn fucking with my traps with their whosawhatsit

Oh god please no roleplay

No

I bought it and it came out 3 weeks later.

I love builds like this

I get lots of protection hits but it seems they really only happen when I don‚Äôt run the perk smh
---
When did I say I was a man you stupid chauvinist virgin üòÇ
---
Fact is you are coming here throwing shade because you're worthless as a human, you don't see me coming to your posts and talking shit because unlike you I'm not a incel who lives to irritate others.
---
It definitely is if he is leaning get behind cover forcing him to move out giving you a chance to spot him or if he is in the open easy detection. If he 99% you make force a hit to reset it denying him his one shot
---
It always happens like that. Just read what he had said lmao he was so angry for literally no reason
---
I drew it! @naughtyknifey is my twitter but this is my sfw reddit account
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, if I survived I could‚Äôve understood but like you killed me, wasn‚Äôt that the goal???
---
ah never knew! just wanted to make sure everyone knew who the artist of this glorious piece was.
---
I appreciate it greatly!!
---
Even if you survived he shouldn't have been salty it's not like you were running op perks
---
What he's saying is since the guy who had the rights to Jason no longer has them, and he was the guy who signed for the game, DBD could get the guy who now has the rights (who btw was the person who created Jason and his mother and finally rightfully got them back) to give them permission to have him
---
It‚Äôs a rarity for people to work together? I don‚Äôt order anyone around, but I help if they ask.
---
What is his problem! Lmao, who cares what you use, that‚Äôs your business.
---
Meanwhile every time I run Deliverance it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve got a neon beacon on my head telling the killer to find me first, feels bad.
---
Link to the fan-made?
---
From the brief time I have been on Reddit I have come to the conclusion that it's controlled by those who see things in black and white. If everyone was silent on toxicity in the game then the decent human beings would eventually leave the game.
---
I LOVE IT WHEN MY TEAMMATES JUST FARM ME FOR BLOOD POINTS BY JUST  UNHOOKING ME RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE KILLER

Small Story on PS4
---
So I played some games a week after the Freddy rework. I was checking my survivors for Badham offerings so I could see the new maps. One of the survivors I checked was Laurie. I didn't have an offering on her, so I checked Quentin, who did. The killer decided to message me, so i checked what's up, and he told me he wasn't going to kill me. I asked why, but then he said he was gonna tunnel me because I didn't choose Laurie. I didn't make the connection as to why he wanted me to play Laurie, as his name was the Ghostfase. I later found out he was playing Michael, and he actually ended up letting me go during endgame. I played with him later, and he actually turned out to be pretty chill, and just wanted me to play Laurie because of Michael's enemy being Laurie.
---
Because this game has the same effect league of legends does, it's frustrating as shit lmao. Very few games have that effect where they're just outright frustrating but you've put so much time into it or generally enjoy it so much that you deal with it. That's why so many people have a love/hate relationship with DBD, it's fun as shit, but frustrates people a good amount of time.
---
It‚Äôs getting to the point where I‚Äôm starting to downvote these post. I‚Äôm sorry but I literally don‚Äôt give a single fuck that you had the ranking system mess up one game. I‚Äôm tired of seeing this these type of post, I just hit a breaking point for these type of post.
---
You're not bad! Dont worry, I think you may get a lot of hate cause of your rank and you might be playing with new people who dont understand the game and are just out for drama. Try not to let them discourage you. I'm sure you're doing all that you can, even if you play great and do everything you can still get salt. Im not sure what you play on. But maybe you can disable messages?
---
I mean clearly there's a reason they're attacking you if a lot of games have people complaining about you but you didn't say what people are complaining about you so nobody can really help you
---
Survivor: Either 
---
We'll Make it, Bond, DS, and Dead Hard

Or

Sabo, Breakdown, Borrowed time, and UE with a sabo toolbox.

For killer it really depends on who I'm playing an what items are in play.
---
But usually something with Dying light, Moniter and Abuse, and StBfL, with a 4th utility kicker.
---
Oh silly you.. you forgot rule #612,342 of dead by daylight killer etiquette, no using your power!

Yea

I‚Äôd like it if he threw his weapon out and took his target‚Äôs spine as a new one

I think I saw the leak too, this biker? Kate makes up for that glitter and gold one, that outfit was horrible.
---
I like Quentin‚Äôs the most, the blood works really well with the color and style of his base clothing. 
---
I also like Kate‚Äôs a lot more now that they changed the hair to make it bloodier.
---
I think it was a skater
---
Very true.. I love those when i play trapper lol.. The sound of that trap when is down to that last gen is a great sound indeed...
---
Eh but it also just varies, some nights a lot of salty people are out
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
Did they all dc at exactly the same time?  I've seen that that happen sometimes if you lag out as killer.
---
What the hell, I main Jeff an never get dailies for him.
---
Suspect behavior.
---
Damn I'm sorry about that
---
To OP pls nerf
---
That's good too
---
One time a killer let me escape cause he hated Claudette‚Äôs cause they use self care (Was three Claudette‚Äôs and me (Kate) the ironic thing was I was using self care at the time üòÇ.
---
And that makes sense, I usually get targeted by the clowns lol
---
Yes
---
Highest rank in group = rank used for matchmaking
---
Problem solved
---
Sure,the low rank might have a rough time of it, but he's got geared out,high rank friends there to help him. 
---
This would kill the whole de-ranking 1 member of the group just to shit on low rank killers thing as well.
---
The thing is, he WASN'T gonna target me, he said he would mess around with me, but not actually kill me when he thought I was playing Laurie.
---
I think so.
---
This is incredible
---
You weren't that important but I simply adore how you replied to me almost instantly you big flirt ‚ù§Ô∏è

Kate‚Äôs P3 before they ruined her p3 head

Well had fun talking later man
---
See ya, thanks for the perk tips.
---
Aah cool. What about the person doing the unhooking? I think the same thing is happpenibg with them.
---
Damn lol
---
No problem
---
Sorry for the website at the top, this was on my Xbox, screen recorded on my iPhone, and idk how to crop it out.
---
Yeah that was my WIP, finished it now. I haven't really practiced drawing in a couple months.
---
NOED on Billy is relatively common on console (or at least it is in my experience on xbox), especially at green/yellow ranks.
---
Are you thanking him for letting you go?  I can't really tell what your point is.
---
sorry bro i don‚Äôt participate and the console wars.
---
op name doesn‚Äôt match. didn‚Äôt know this was their SFW account. i know the artist, i enjoy her art. didn‚Äôt recognize the name so i commented. is that an issue?
---
Add me: redchainsaaw
---
I use hope if idk what else to use or don‚Äôt have perks available I want
---
Same. I also play super silly and memey to let the low ranks have fun and give the game its scariness back by trying new things to scare them.
---
Then I get that red rank queueing with the 20 who loops like a pro and I make sure to massacre them and demoralize them in front of their 20 friend as they try to bully me not realizing Im no baby killer.
---
yep
---
Cool, thanks! Any reason you prefer to go for the savior instead of the person being unhooked?
---
It's not just one game. Even when I play killer (purple ranks) I never play against survivors also on purple ranks. I always play against some red ranks survivors and what's the logic on that? Downvote me if you want, I'm just stating the truth and for some people the truth hurts.
---
Lol
---
Not what he said
---
Yep and tier 1 myers is already immune to detection perks
---
I do it because I feel like it draws the game out longer, and if the game is drawn out I'm more likely to get a 4k. Where as if I was to go after a survivor until they die I feel like I'm wasting time because I'm only focused on 1 out of 4 people. Try it out on different games and see what works best for you though :) in the end its just a game and everyone is different
---
Matchmaking is basically an impatient child. It will wait about 15-20 seconds to find an 'even-ish' match, but if that doesn't happen then that's when you see the big fucking travesties.
---
done
---
I guess you should just try to ignore the stuff that piss you off. The main problem with killers and survivors is probably bad match making in medium ranks and toxicity in high ranks. I think

So learn how to short range saw. Every map is bad for some and good for others.

Technically no but.... Maps are a variety for a reason. Some are more challenging for one side than the other and also its about learning the map. Its not like the only thing is chainsaw down with Billy.
---
SHIT LIKE THIS IS HOW TRULY EVIL KILLERS ARE BORN!
---
According to you "this map shouldnt be available to billy" = "remove this map from the game"

I hope you did your stretches before making that leap.
---
Ahh I see. I usually just swing and hope it hits someone lol.
---
What did you take from it? Just curious
---
Yikes. I'm a red rank Billy main who plays on Xbone and I never play NOED on ANY killer, let alone a killer whose power is a literal instadown
---
I feel so bad for survivors when I'm at getting my final levels on a killer b4 prestiging and burning all my pinks/purples. But at the same time, I love all the death.
---
How did I not know this? I have so much time on this game but had no clue burning the traps gave the Hag a notification. I feel so dumb rn, oof.
---
That the map shouldnt be available to lobbies where billy is the killer? Just removed from his random pool of maps. I disagree with op but i also disagree with people purposely misconstruing any message.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs annoying but I personally just found it humorous that this is the current state of the game lol
---
I mean potato Billy is a potato, and the real winner here was Boil Over.
---
Or like.. just spam crouch, either way they understandüòÅ
---
YES! FUCKING YES!
---
ALSO THERE IS A LITERAL TARGET ON YOUR BACK. YOU PICKED A COSMETIC WITH A TARGET ON YOUR BACK! YOU CLEARLY WANTED THIS.
---
OR
---
ALL 4 OF YOU ARE GODDAM CLAUDETTES. I'M NOT TUNNELING IF I CAN'T TELL WHO IS WHO.
---
I‚Äôm the only one who runs into zero issues apparently.
---
Sure, if you could bring an ‚Äúinstantly doen one person of your choice any time you want‚Äù addon as killer
---
I LIKE THIS BETTER
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMS4ESFlfDk
---
SERIOUSLY? WHO THINKS THIS IS A GOOD PLAN!?
---
I personally the he should put the bell next to the survivors head and lift his mallet and then utter the words ‚Äúring a ding bitch‚Äù and slam the mallet into the bell causing a chain reaction from the bell into the survivors head killing them instantly.
---
I was about to screech about this in the comments, and then you mentioned my two favorite things, bunny feng and lithe being better than sb
---
No new content? Have you not noticed the Freddy rework with reworks to the school map?
---
Rise!
---
*angrily hides in a locker*
---
You mean IH?
---
Just take a look at their official forums for their roadmap. It will let you know what is up and coming.  They are working on dedicated servers now and will continue to update and add content for the next 5 years.
---
They have a guide map for the year of what they‚Äôll work on. New killer should be soon.
---
Okay so off topic: I just had a game as Freddy against a 4 man streaming SWF. I went to check the Streamer's VOD after the match and his SWF was complaining about everything under the sun: Pop Goes the Weasel, my snares, my teleport, the gen pressure I was applying, "camping" (read: using my teleport while standing beside a hook), and in particular "tunnelling" when one of the SWF players unhooked someone right in front of me without Borrowed Time. (Twitch Chat even agreed that I tunnelled!)
---
Here's the thing: two of them had medkits with anti-hemorrhage syringes and gel dressings. I called out the "toxic instaheals" as a joke and they bitched about it for like 5 minutes after the match because "apparently items are toxic."
---
Well apparently playing Killer and using your power is toxic too. Would you have preferred if I took Franklin's for the two instaheals and green toolbox?
---
People can be such babies.
---
I like it but I feel like it should only apply to Ghostface and Haunted Grounds. It's really obnoxious when someone gets stabbed in the endgame and you hear a loud "DWOOSH." And I don't even think I need to mention how hard it fucks with the immersion of Myers and his classic theme.
---
To be fair, I should probably change my name/move accounts to keep the names knife-related so these problems dont happen  -- This account was made 2 years before my nsfw one, but that one has gotten so popular now that it may as well be my main! But I know nsfw art isnt everyones thing so that's why I have this one to try and keep them separate. You arent in the wrong for keeping an eye out!
---
Yeah I figured that out today when I played while tipsy lol. Thank you!
---
FUCK YOU ASSHOLES ON MY LAST GAME. I HAD 6 DC'S IN THE 2 GAMES BEFORE AND I WANTED TO GO 3 FOR 3 AND ONLY ONE OF YOU CUNTS QUIT. I  SUPPOSE I CAN GIVE PARTIAL CREDIT TO THE FUCKER THAT OFFED THEMSELVES ON THE HOOK BUT IT ISN'T THE SAME YOU PIECE OF SHIT.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the right way of looking at it
---
no it‚Äôs fine lmao. i enjoy the sfw as much as the nsfw, i just don‚Äôt understand why i‚Äôm being argued with over a mistake i realized i had made and corrected myself for.
---
Fire crotch
---
Good use of time
---
It‚Äôs on their plans . https://ibb.co/9pBf8xX their dev roadmap I took picture of during their dev stream. Sorry it‚Äôs sideways
---
ace is the only survivor with a good looking face
---
I get why it feels unfair, I'm mostly just saying it's not unfair.
---
"We did all five generators" is not a high bar or something to aspire to beyond needing to open the exit gate itself, it's not indicative of skill or even difficult to repair three or four in a single chase.
---
This in turn means that Adrenaline is not an achievement. People consider it a reward for doing generators, but consider that objective time is actually unfair to most Killers (read: all except Nurse), and that because of this, Adrenaline is unfair by proxy.
---
If your average Killer could get 2.4 hooks per generator, then Adrenaline would be balanced - meaning that in two generators a Killer should have four hooks, this would reward being good at looping (if the average was two per generator then a good looper could still deny the Killer more than two kills or save themselves, but ten hooks would let the Killer **average two kills** without having to tunnel anyone, **two-hooking every survivor first and having two survivors escape**).
---
This would be ideal, it fits into BVHR's desire for Killers (to get two kills) and provide more interactions between Survivors and Killers than "gen jockey"; the increased amount of hook rescues and heals would increase survivor BP gains.
---
**Also in such a system, I would have no problem with NOED being removed - or otherwise reworked entirely to not include the Exposed effect and give a different benefit instead, possibly not even an endgame benefit, such as a benefit that ends when either one gate or the hatch is open - but activates again when the hatch is closed.**
---
Maybe if NOED let you see the auras of injured survivors, for example, or even prevented injured survivors from opening the exit gate unless they were the last alive, instead of applying exposed, I don't know.
---
What in the fuck did you just say about Best Boy‚Ñ¢ ?
---
Did not expect that DH play. Nice job
---
Someone explain
---
Now someone should make one with **The Leg** at the center of an ion.
---
Introducing: **The Leg Ion**.
---
I have the regular ps4 and it seems fine for me
---
Jake looks like his spine caved in on itself lol
---
I haven‚Äôt played wraith yet, I‚Äôm new to the game and really only play trapper. His base perks aren‚Äôt good but his play style always looks fun
---
Perfect opportunity to superimpose the Huntress‚Äôs head in the last frame.
---
I got a rank 19 game with one red rank. Thanks devs 
---
(Got a 2k though)
---
This was like a one in a million chance.
---
Being the one left alone when slugged is already 50/50 and requires losing a chase you really don't want to lose, and if you're running Unbreakable instead you can pick yourself up before the Killer comes back for you with only one perk (allowing you to hide) instead of relying on two to possibly hop off their shoulder right by them.
---
Then there was the Killer using too many hooks nearby, most Killers spread out consumed hooks.
---
And of course being carried towards the hatch on a large map.
---
You just created this post to float the idea of the term ‚Äúantimate‚Äù.
---
My Xbox gamertag is RotBb :)
---
Could've just been the connection or something.
---
Ooh. Sounds foun
---
Awww smol wraith
---
that‚Äôs what I was going for so yeehaw
---
Doctor with the right perks on the Game is ridiculous for survivors (and a much bigger problem). Maybe a map rework will happen eventually.
---
Actually I don't know where it comes from I'm new to the game I've seen the Sam animations but still no clue
---
Wallhacks, lazy mechanic
---
The leg on
---
please add huntress :(
---
I mean without the flip-flop he would have gotten her to that first hook.  Both together though is what got him the escape.  That, and probably Billy's greed in wanting to be close to the hatch to be able to close it right after the hook.
---
Depends on rank, time of day, and other factors.
---
I use hope. it's alright.
---
Except it was on PC
---
Don‚Äôt talk to me or my son ever again?
---
I thought of pinhead being "The Priest"
---
Or the survivor may be waiting to just make sure the ping is stable for them?   Until we finally get servers, ping is very inconsistent.
---
Archives is lore, rift is battlepass
---
Im on xbox, how do i get my perks to look like that?
---
He let you go on purpose, just decided to troll a bit. And got a lil bit more points. He's definetly looking at the trap on the ground that he steps on it.
---
I think it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs more choices. It‚Äôs not as simple as you lost because your team had worse aim. You might‚Äôve lost the game because the Nea didn‚Äôt feel safe saving you, or because the killer was camping, or someone failed a skill check. Every loss can be blamed on someone else so easily. Even your shitty actions can be blamed on them. If you teabag it‚Äôs because they camped, you used noed but they used adrenaline. The interactions between players is cranked up to 11 in this game, so if your taking the game seriously it‚Äôs really hard to take responsibly when your supposed to rely on your teammates
---
lol thats funny af. "FaCeCaMpEr!!!" like duh imma camp you. it's end game and you actin a fool!
---
You probably stopped playing due to the toxicity, you‚Äôll see
---
Yeah, I got completely outplayed on this one
---
Probably the sheer amount of toxic dicks in this game. Yesterday I got teabag bullied by like 5 SWF in a row. And yes they were SWF unless its normal for red ranks to get paired with rank 10 killers. 
---
Then I switched to survivor today and got face camped by two huntresses and needlessly slugged by a pig and trapper who just shut the hatch in front of me then crouched/set traps for the entire collapse. This community is toxic as fuck and it always reminds me why I take breaks. Its honestly strange theres so many exploitable mechanics that can be used for trolling still in this game. Like how hard is it to put something in to prevent end game slugging? Just give me a suicide channel so I can get my bloodpoints and peace out.
---
Except that it isn't, and when multiple, if not all, of the survivors are bringing pink items/add-ons into a match, I'd hardly say it's rare (much less ultra-rare). The killer is supposed to be the strong one. A lone survivor shouldn't be able to remove a down (and by extension a hook and even a possible death) just by running up and one-tapping someone.
---
Laughed so hard. Greato daze
---
I've found some killers don't need Ruin, such as Legion, Nurse, Billy or even some Spirit builds. For Legion you definetely depend on a small map to some degree.
---
And you sat there teabagging me. I got him to admit that he purposely plays with low ranked players to get low ranked killers. What a douche
---
Why gen tap when you can just hit great skill checks like a gamer
---
Ya. No. No more than when an M-F couple kisses.
---
VERY likely swf, though even at rank 1 I sometimes match against green rank killer when solo queueing. 
---
I usually let them sacrifice me if I know I'll black pip.. :/
---
Interesting
---
That‚Äôs what I mean, you‚Äôd just be disembodied and fly around with the main ceiling and walls invisible to you and perhaps see the auras of the killer/survivors
---
What @18whyte said. I edited it to get rid of the text and make this
---
Sometimes I wonder if anyone I stab in almost the same spot is having the same issues actually, it'd feel completely unfair... Though nobody has ever said a word so guess not
---
It's a great piece, but my god does the mouth look like a butthole.
---
Unfulfilled closeted desire, Obviously.  But he will never admit to it.
---
This. I want to judge if I'm getting any better as killer, but it's hard when I'm either completely wiping the board or get one to no kills because the ranking system decided to put me against a group that had people who are high above my skill level.
---
Yea the swf did pretty well doing their best doing generators but still a green rank with red ranks is crazy
---
I had a toxic Claudette tbag all game. I hit her while she was tbagging and then she got this but. She finally bled out on the opposite side of the door lol
---
I'm too ashamed to admit that this sounds exactly like something that once happened to me, from the perspective of the other person... oh well :D I was a newbie though!

Its reportable behavior.  But thats about all we can do. Report and hope that the devs actually do something about it.
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
Yes but its not very noticeable
---
This has happened to be before and its so frustrating. It also happened to this one guy who for majority of the game avoided me, i let him get the hatch. Its a horrid feeling
---
I don't think its worth it really.
---
That said i do it anyway just for completion sake... :/ I play too much so no reason not to. Don't if you don't main game DbD imo.
---
well... thanks I guess LMAO
---
I can't answer this question because I can't fucking find a match as a solo survivor on PS4 with this latest update...
---
To answer your question though, I mostly lose because I don't SWF. I play solo and I have to end up doing most of the work because the team mates I get (who are probably SWF) are altruistic af amongst themselves that they end up fucking everything up or they're self caring / allergic to gens.

Had us at the first half not gonna lie.
---
Fuck you cunt
---
Those were protesters against immigrants at a city council... they were the personification of Pro-Trump trash. That man just couldn't take them seriously and laughed his ass off. Perfect meme
---
ofc you sometimes lose if not that would mean that survivors never escape , it is perfectly fine to lose sometimes
---
They will not appear until you level up Bill for his teachables.
---
I'm playing on PC. 
---
I deserve all the hate!
---
Ima be honest meg scares me more than nea
---
&gt;What I believe is the most reasonable step to take would be to let all survivors show one of their perks to other survivors in the lobby.
---
I, for one, wouldn't remember who had what perk after loading into a match. 
---
&gt;To actually close the gap to virtually nothing would be preposterous, you would have to share auras and found items to the degree Deathgarden does, and that is a drastically different game.
---
This. This right here. This is what is causing this game to be forever in a hole in regards to SWF. In order to truly balance SWF, the devs would have to scrap SWF; that's how broken SWF being able to communicate is in this game. It's just how this game works. Or, the devs would have to essentially completely redo a huge chunk if not all of this game from the ground up. It's that bad. 
---
A hide-and-seek/tag hybrid survival game cannot co-exist with being able to instantaneously give anyone information at anytime. It would have to be a completely different game with SWF in mind, and DBD already exists so it's not going anywhere. SWF should've never been added in the first place, and now that it's in there's pretty much no true way to fix it, only band-aids. I don't envy the position the devs have put themselves in. 
---
&gt;However, narrowing it just a bit could convince the dev team to rebalance the game around more coordinated survivors, and therefore make the game healthier overall.
---
This seems like more of a request to get ideas to convince the devs to *begin* working on the rebalancing, rather than actually suggesting ideas to rebalance it in the first place.
---
The Wraith killers I've come across with in red ranks are super deadly. Props to those killers because most of the time it's a bloodbath lol.
---
He's gonna kick your ass.
---
DBD is just full of angry people looking to hurt other people. Maybe a few flat out sadists. Though I guess the theme of the game would kind of draw them. Doesn't help that theres still a good number of ways to hold the game hostage and be obnoxious. Thank god they added the collapse so SWF bullies can't fart around a map for literally 40 minutes like I experienced before.
---
You don‚Äôt need to play bubba for bbq
---
The thing with Ghostface, is that it's Ghostface because of the mask. Even if the devs could make such changes, which they can't. the essence of the character is the peanut eyed screaming ghost.
---
Now Quetzalcoatl more than being related to snakes is known for being related to Aztecs, so something it should have something more aztec related, for example a feathered headdress, which would make him a lousy stealth killer or an obsidian knife. and finally, even if he was a snake, he was the main god in some mesoamerican religions, also he was the god of light among other stuff, so the whole ninja thing doesn't seems fitting.
---
Guess who does
---
Why should there be one? Killers should be able to dodge when they see 4 flashlights or toolboxes.
---
oh believe me i know
---
not intended
---
*but i knowüëÄ*
---
I used to escape constantly but then in the midst of my bordem of escaping too easily, the game got popular was even free on my platform. So now all these new players are potato amd it became harder to escape, so now Im bored cause my teamates are potato and its a 4v2 game that i cant 1v1 in. So i grit my teeth and play anyway cause despite the salt and crappy matchmaking, its really an awesome game
---
Speaking of which, when do they announce the next one?
---
5 times today
---
I swear PTB Ghost Face used to give you the oblivious status effect because he would expose me even though I'd be staring right at him and then it'd finally reveal him but even though he had a red stain I couldn't hear the terror radius or any chase music. Not to mention in the description it says survivors become oblivious when "affected" meaning not simply when ghost face activates night shroud but rather when he exposes them
---
I think the game was unplayable for like a year. Can‚Äôt find a match and all that. I had like a hundred hours in this and stopped. Then like 6 months later I was sure it was dead and couldn‚Äôt find a lobby. Few days later I tried a final time before uninstalling and BOOM. Had no problem with matches and decked 500 more hours in. This game is so unique, and it‚Äôs great that it‚Äôs finally picking up steam
---
I mean, yeah. Nobody wants to go against 4 toolboxes. My friends and I almost never bring anything, so the one random will have an item. I don‚Äôt see a reason to dodge there.
---
Echoing everyone else - buy him now, if you don't feel like playing him just rank him up with the BP you earn as you get a handle on the killer you want to play.
---
Alternatively, you can run survivor and rank up David for We're Going to Live Forever to get faster BP stacks.
---
I find genuine joy when the killer goes balls deep on a scumbag survivor.
---
In fact there are games where I know the last piece of shit survivor left is searching for the hatch whilst I'm on my first hook.  Said survivor didn't do shit all game except run the killer to his teammates, and now he's dipping out to save himself.  What do I do in this situation?  Suicide.  And then I spectate as the killer goes straight to the hatch and closes it and hunts down the scrub sneaking towards the exit gate.  Sweet sweet Justice.  And then I thank that killer for their service.
---
Why would there be a penalty for dodging?
---
Its useful i swear i used it one time
---
Yeah, also I don't feel like playing against people from Mars
---
You.. drop the pallet?
---
If you get hit use the speed boost to go to a different tile or loop again instead of dropping, if they swing too early you keep running so they miss.
---
I never get slugged so I never run it. :c Borrowed Time is great though.
---
Who isnt
---
Any thing that makes her purge more effective, breaks the survivors quicker. They stack too so even better, they cant deprive you of your power totally.
---
That sucks. I have people dc right before they are sacrificed pretty frequently. Disconnect by Daylight
---
My two brothers.
---
That ain‚Äôt photoshop, chief. I know photoshop when I see it. That is one very sad cat.
---
I run BT, Unbreakable, Poised and Kindred. Usefull perks that dont seem broken or toxic imo
---
:( 
---
Lets find them some partners
---
When I want to be a friendly killer i just pick ghost face and spam tbag till they spam it back, it works most the time lol
---
Only reason Ill ever dodge is if I have red ping as survivor. Swfs arent always the funnest to play against, but they'll help you get better, so Ill stick against them usually.  And flashlights are fun to go against :D
---
Oh really? What do you have your actions set as? What feels natural to u
---
In the meantime if you want to tell me why you love me and inflate my ego I'd be happy as a clam.
---
Oh boy, I have two clips of my legion going from either a quad or triple escapes to a 4k thanks to Bloodwarden EXCLUSIVELY.   
---
I love the look on their face as they turn around after tea bagging in the exit zone.
---
Both of them are dogshit
---
If you‚Äôre a casual player I don‚Äôt recommend prestiging, unless you enjoy grinding. If you do, you get a bloodied cosmetic for each prestige(3 prestiges). You should get a good amount of blood points before prestiging so you can get some levels back immediately.
---
Baby Dwight doesn't deserve this. ;(
---
I know, stop the Dwight bullying :(
---
I think they should nerf self care next again. Make healing last a whole minute. After all getting ine health level back is a crutch!
---
Which instant downs are you talking about specifically.
---
I win maybe every 9 games I usually end up getting 2 hooked or one hooked
---
I'd love nothing more than to face Billy every game, so much more fun than Ghostface, Myers, Trapper, Hag, Spirit and Nurse
---
Even as a survivor main, i still really enjoy seeing rank 10 megs Adrenaline pop just to get hit by some rank 19 trapper using NOED.
---
 He used the toxic to destroy the toxic
---
Nerf him at launch and rename him The Feet.
---
Plan out what perks you want. If you reach lvl.50 and don't have the build you're going for, then use up all of the add-ons you got and prestige. The blood web is cheaper per level when it's lower.
---
If you have the build you want at lvl.50, don't prestige. Perks are random so there's a chance you can get back up to 50 again without even seeing the perks you want. I found that out the hard way.
---
The only thing that transfers are the orange perks you can buy in a bloodweb at level 30, 35, and 40.  Nothing else transfers.
---
I wish my killer games queued that quirky
---
 Wake up bug was OP. I tried it in kyf and it was OP. I played against a full premade abusing wake up and I got destroyed in chases because they were really optimised. Also I got the worst genrush in my dbd life but that's another thing...
---
The sfx when you get caught in a locker is horrendous too.
---
Scares the crap out of me and frustrates me at the same time because of how loud it is lol
---
Worst off is when you‚Äôve been looping the killer around for the entire game and when you finally get hooked, they just escape or wait for you to die on hook before leaving.
---
Nothing "transfers"
---
When you buy something on a characters blood web a perk or item or map offering it stays with that character only.
---
If you buy a lerys map offering on doctor you can't switch to another killer or survivor and use that same offering. Example: doctor has 3 lerys map offerings in his inventory, you switch to say trapper who you never found a lerys offering for him he won't have one to use.
---
All inventories are separate.
---
That being said all characters have teachable perks. At character levels 30, 35, 40 a perk will show up on the bloodweb when you you purchase it you then have a chance to find that perk on other characters blood web.
---
Nah man cause I always get stuck with survive with your friends try hards
---
Get the Xbox App, then next time just double tap the Xbox button and hit X.
---
Captures are uploaded to the app, which then you can save to iPhone.
---
As survivor I either win every game I play that night, or none.  In general though probably about 65% loss rate.  That said, I usually pip, so I guess kinda win?
---
Nice dead hard
---
To be fair what isn‚Äôt stronger than legion atm, at least buba can stop swf rushing hooks
---
r/thanksihateit
---
I can feel the love tonight.

See if the other role works any faster

If it does its a population issue one side has too many.

Honestly same af

---
I'll send you a "love you bruh" bracelet
---
Tbh same basic power and couldn't be any worse than the legion
---
this is the next one, it‚Äôs stated right in the title
---
That‚Äôs like what I did a couple games ago this meg was sandbagging and tbaging and I ended up killing a random Claudette because the meg sandbagged her then after that she started sandbagging the jake so at that point I realised she was a troll and then when she died i let the other 2 go then got a message from the jake saying thanks lol
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was that easy, thanks!
---
Ok but still. If you‚Äôre dominating you could be pipping up twice per game. Again sorry if I sound rude
---
I lose ever survivor game but can get kills on killer
---
Killer bad survivor good circlejerk

Screenshot of incredibly mild insults in post game chat

And let‚Äôs not forget the absolute epitome of comedy... ‚ÄúOink oink‚Äù 
---
Repeat any of these in any kind of shit meme format and you‚Äôre guaranteed upvotes.
---
Nah. Most people agree that survivors don't need nerfs. However more than half the killers need buffs to some degree
---
The only instant down I see a problem with is IH. All of the other ones are justified in my opinion.
---
üò± after reading this I searched some more gods and now I have another idea. Thank you for indirectly helping me :)
---
Catharsis, thy name is NOED.
---
Bloody skeleton may be too much... put i like the idea of rings bell with survivors head both vanishing then horrible screaming and panic... another ding they reapear and the survivor is laying on the ground dead.
---
I know they wont go too graphic which is a shame because my idea would have been knocks down survivor pulls them close holds bell close over head and rings it fast and hard and the sound causes their head to explode... however maybe just bleed from their ears profusely as they squirm and maybe holding their head trying to fight the agony the bells ring is causing until they finially die.
---
Oh I take them right to the killer and then slam a pallet in their face. Seems to keep them off my ass for the rest of the match.
---
happy cake day

Y‚Äôall are telling me you don‚Äôt have bees in you juul?

Yay!! Uh I mean oh no!!!

Disappointed to find this isn't a real @ :(

Tbh I don't really mind Infinite Tier 3 (maybe because I almost never run into it, after 1500+ hours I've been against maybe 15 Infinite Tier 3, compared to like 200 Iridescent head huntress)
---
But 100 % agree on dying light. Whoever is the obsession is always in for a shitty 5 minute game of getting tunneled and usually moried.
---
I don't see any hate here.
---
i used to play him when i got the game like a month ago, but now when i try playing him in rank 10 or higher generators just pop immediately i don't know why he feels so bad

No, MY dad works at BHVR.

How bad do you have to be to blame insta heals.
---
Red rank bubba mains rise up!
---
Hitting a little too close to home
---
Seems like one of those people who plays a game and can't understand any reason why someone would run anything that's not meta and has to educated that person on how and why what they are doing is dumb and wrong....
---
Hey Plague's the only adept I have!
---
You want AT LEAST one apple, as people may not be willing to cleanse. Going for Adept an apple addon and Black Incense will pair well. Effectiveness is useless as it doesn't take long enough to break someone to need to use over a more valuable addon.
---
When you start, head towards one of the gens blocked from CI, survivors usually spawn there. If you can find and down one person while getting another sick before CI wears off you can start the needed snowball off well. Infectious Fright I use to know where to AVOID. In order to ensure no one dies so early that you can't get Merciless, I would deliberately go AWAY from where you heard someone scream if you did.
---
this game needs more options overall. resolution and better input management would go a long way
---
I find it cute
---
I main him, but I dont play a lot of killer
---
I fucking love him especially for his power. Although he could use a bit off a buff to make him have some more power instead of being reliant on add-ons
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Wraith op
---
Wow that hillbilly was an idiot.
---
I just got Flip-Flop today so with that particular build maybe 5 or 6 if I remember correctly. Most games are duds for sure.
---
So close
---
problem with Lithe: Easily gets wasted. sometimes you have to vault the window when ahead and you'll get the speed boost even tho the right play now is to stand still and wait for the killer's decision.
---
DH and BL don't have this problem. you always have them when you need them as they won't "just activate"
---
and it only triggers once
---
You're entitled to an opinion.
---
Why dodge when you can Mori?
---
Exactly.
---
Is that Nea?
---
doesnt matter, it disables her mobility.
---
No he wants you to be trapper (no offence trapper mains)
---
Bond or Adrenaline and you'll have pain reliever's favorite perks to run
---
Damn you must really hate the smell of other people having fun
---
Actually it kinda depends on the day and time
---
What do you want to say with this
---
i really like new DS, i dont use it but its a good anti tunnel perk for those people who are into that. its fine as it is C:
---
hag mains unite
---
Lullaby, Franklins (only if they have items. You can play some solid mind games with stealth Killers with it) Make Your Choice, and Whispers. You should really work your way up to the standard perks such as Monitor and Abuse and Ruin. Your current build will only get you so far
---
Honestly, if they bring a Mori instead of dodging, I could atleast play lmao
---
Jokes on you, I'm poor so I don't have any dlc at all
---
How can you not love ol coochie-kun
---
he can still do some stealthy stuff tho. removing your red light on command and crouching is helpful in mind-games
---
ya i watch every episode that comes out it‚Äôs prob one of my favorite youtube series‚Äôs.
---
Nothing too harsh, like consecutive dodging lobbies you won‚Äôt be able to que instantly after until a few minutes
---
Looks like the Cult of Amanda has splintered into 2 factions. Let the Holy Wars commence.
---
so backstory..
---
map was coal tower, sacrificed one of the survivors before the other 3 3-genned themselves (and the gens were legit no more than maybe 20-30 meters from each other, mind you). Note, they didn‚Äôt focus on any other gens but one that was near completion, which i capitalized on. So this girl gets unhooked, I slug her because I thought she had DS (she was the obsession), and go to check the gen. I see the other two (both injured) urbaning away out of my web. I down the meg, hook her, she dies, then go for the dwight who was dumb enough to stay in the area and heal.. sacrificed him. After that I found hatch, this girl didn‚Äôt have adrenaline, I hook her and she dies, then she sends me this,
---
Bear in mind, I was using yellow addons and capitalized off of their mistakes. She complained about how ‚Äúcrouchwalking the entire game‚Äù isn‚Äôt fun and I simply told her to get over it instead of being a sore sport about it. Needless to say, she said she‚Äôd rather go against any of the listed killer builds i said instead of a yellow addon hag.
---
Oh, and she said hag and LEGION, yes, reworked Legion, are the most unfun to play against... this is high purple ranks.
---
console is a strange place
---
YOU THINK YOU DO, BUT YOU DON'T.
---
He may not do toxic things in his game, but I feel that he invites toxicity into the community by attempting to bring attention to it, it makes people want to troll him and be toxic in his games simply because its him.
---
Replace the last one with **"Get grabbed off a gen by Prayer beads Spirit"**
---
My rebuttal is simply that insta heals are one use, whereas Moris last the entire trial
---
they can't punish in-game DC's yet (they need dedicated servers for that) so they also won't be able to make those a thing.
---
I personally don't see a point in such penalty
---
I THINK THE ONLY WAY I CAN CONTINUE PLAYING THIS GAME IS IF I HAVE A SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS GROUP. NOT BECAUSE I NEED IT EASIER BUT BECAUSE I NEED A TEAM THAT I KNOW WON'T DISCONNECT LIKE A GARBAGE MAN AFTER BEING PLACED ON THE HOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME. I CANNOT HANDLE DISCONNECTING PLAYERS ANYMORE. I PLAY ON PS4 IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO LET ME JOIN A GROUP I'M ALL ABOUT TEAMWORK AND NEVER DISCONNECTING.
---
you don't camp the pallet
---
If someone dies on second hook and there are still 4 survivor alive that means that you are camping or the team is particularly bad. A survivor can get 6 hits before he dies (2 for the first hook, 2 for the second and 2 for the last), a Mori makes these 6 hits become 3. But as I always see on this subreddit killers are ready to start the war for the single extra hit that the insta-heal gives, but when someone talks about a Mori they start with "it's part of the game, get good, noob etc, here's another cry baby survivor, etc...".
---
So 3 less hits are fine 1 extra hit is overpowered?
---
Agree like I ran thantophobia and sloppy butcher on Billy for the longest because it just helped me snowball so hard. That part of my builds is my guilty pleasure  because it promotes  you to waste time or suffer the consequences
---
Does he go in the locker first
---
Or just use one of the 4 killers with that built into their base power
---
Yeah. Some times of day I get instant ques on killer on pc
---
What a fucking broken game.
---
Hate it when people do that. It's worse when if they actually helped you might actually do something.
---
You really think ghost face is op and needs a nerf?!
---
Interesting I didn‚Äôt know that last part I‚Äôve only been above rank 12-15 consistently for a couple weeks now. All good points, thanks for the glass half full side of things hahaha
---
Probably will be, I hope.
---
Normal people: Smol wraith
---
Internet deviants: tHiS iS pOrN
---
Literally every time
---
Yea, while I‚Äôm over here with my DS, Ded Ard, Borrowed Time, Adrena-win, and insta heal. 
---
Obviously you just need to git gud
---
L
---
And people say chucks can‚Äôt be a killer because he‚Äôs too small smh
---
Yea as long as you aren‚Äôt a potato survivor and the killer doesn‚Äôt face camp you, you will pip no matter what
---
This bug has happened to my friends and I so many times recently. Always starts with not being able to heal myself (whether it be by a medkit or self care) and having the progress bar visually not move when someone is healing me or I‚Äôm healing them. The second I see that I know the exit gate bug is coming. Only way I‚Äôve been able to live is by finding the hatch before the EGC tuner runs out. Super frustrating.
---
That's why I have a feeling that servers won't be live this summer. It wouldn't be the first time they don't respect the schedule.
---
Everyone makes fanart of my boy Jake but non of them have him breaking shit
---
See you in hot. And how did this happen? Is this a kyf game or a normal match?
---
Is it really worth the purchase/grind?
---
This is really cute! I love the style of it.
---
On PS4. I'm in red ranks on both sides.
---
Solo survivor I think my escape rate is around 25-30%. Certainly die a lot more than escape.
---
In swf(usually not even mics, just random good players I met), escape rate shoots drastically up. Don't even need mics, just people who do gens and aren't hiding all game. Mics usually hurts more, because people screaming in your ear lowers my ability to track the killer.
---
As a killer, if I play spirit or hag, at least 3k 95% of the time, it's super rare for more than 2 people to escape. Trapper and doctor people escape more, but it's still I would say it's around 60-70% win rate. With doctor it's always 4k, it's easy to find a person who is hiding.
---
Lol this happened in my hometown (Tucson , AZ) and I‚Äôm glad to see this format get some use
---
You are saying a sequence of things that doesn't even make sense with each other.
---
1) somebody can die when there are 4 survivor alive if for example he gets camped. 
---
2) no good killer would allow for survivor to be saved immediately? Have you ever played this game? Have you ever get farmed? If your team farm each other how can the killer not allow that? Personally when I play killer and I see someone farmed under my face I go for the farmer and not for the farmed, but that's not what every killer does. But from the other side, if I play survivor with a friend and I know that my teammate has decisive or I have borrowed, I'm going to try to save before he dies.
---
Death on second hook is more realistic only if you are playing at rank 20! You said that too "how can somebody die when there are still 4 survivor alive?" The things you are saying doesn't even make sense with each other. Death on secondo hook is common if there are 2 survivors alive, but with 3 or 4, if the killer is not facecamping hard, survivors does not die on second hook. Move from that rank 20!
---
this build makes him slow
---
he ate so many burgers he got fat
---
Ok
---
You want people to stop playing what they want?
---
Hundreds is my mummy killer that can dominate me anytime in her red forest ;)
---
Kinda creepy
---
That's just a side effect of how the Bloodwebs weight rarity.
---
Depending on what Killer you play an Ebony Mori may be the only Ultra-Rare node you can purchase; so even though you only get 1-2 Ultra-Rare nodes in any given Bloodweb you're always getting an Ebony Mori because it's literally the only Ultra Rare you can get.
---
Ivory Moris are Rare nodes, but because they compete for a spot on the Bloodweb with at least 5 add-ons, 5 Bloodpoint offerings, AND the ever-growing number of map offerings you may only see one Ivory Mori every 3-5 Bloodwebs.
---
Insta-down add-ons are more powerful than insta-heals, and theres not an argument to be had here. 
---
Insta-down add-ons last the entire game, and while they are skill based, so is the instaheal, and its only useable once. There is no counter to any insta-downs other than ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get hit.‚Äù
---
Need proof that insta-downs are more powerful than insta-heals? Whens the last time you‚Äôve seen a killer DC because an insta-heal was used? Maybe if it directly lead to the survivor leaving through the exit gate, but otherwise its exceedingly rare. When‚Äôs the last time you‚Äôve seen someone DC after an insta-down hatchet? Probably within the last week. Granted, you encounter 3x the amount of survivors than killers, but i cannot remember a single time an insta-heal has resulted in a DC from the killer.
---
When I'm far away trying to get my Make your Choice to activate and my trap gets broken... Sad hag times.
---
And then he comes around through the door and opens the last locker too haha
---
dude listen i'd LIKE to have faith and say "oh this is just some cuteish/weird art of two characters with varying sizes" but i've experienced that, i know better
---
In practice too. As I did use ‚ÄúI‚Äù words
---
Survivor: Dead Hard, DS, WGLF, We‚Äôll Make It OR Adrenaline in place of WMI.
---
Killer: Hag. Dried Cicada + Green turtle egg addon. Hex: Ruin, Franklin‚Äôs, STBFL, then either NOED or Haunted Grounds.
---
Can't we just have miniature sized things without shoving them into uncomfortable places?
---
Well MY dad works at nintendo and he says they're replacing him with Sonic.
---
Sometimes this snowballs sometimes it lowballs
---
Bullshit, I ditched ruin for thrilling tremors and got instantly better results! Ruin is a hit or miss.
---
THe only instant downs that feel cheap are ultra rare addons, rancor and noed (both of which I don't like)
---
If you go down to billy saw,  stalk, devour hope or Make your choice or haunted grounds those are usually earned from work or you're not counterplaying them properly
---
lol people are actually down voting you. How sad

In all honesty I lived one match against NOED because of hope I had enough speed to get to a pallet then out the exit
---
Aww poor baby Wraith; Spirit must protect him from the toxicity of this Foggy world.
---
&gt;Useless on shelter woods
---
Hey don't knock the tree!
---
I play on Xbox
---
A lot of people really like wraith. It's just that he's an absolute pain to play in anything above green ranks.
---
That‚Äôs not true, killer takes 5x longer for me on console
---
Oink
---
How do i play as nurse in lery's? An swf team with their 'main' looper kept going in and out of the locker when i chased the other survivors, but when i tried going for him he just kept juking me. I often lose them during my fatigue as well. I even tried using add-ons to decrease fatigue time but they often just disappear. I have no idea how I'm supposed to play in maps with tight spaces like lery's at all. It would be great if there are some videos for me to watch and learn as well. Thanks in advance!
---
You can tell that pretty quickly
---
What's wrong with Freddy though? He's not nearly as strong as those 2.
---
Devs have said in the past that it's going to be one of their priorities to add with dedicated servers.
---
I see spirit often
---
All the above
---
B button
---
Ruin and Pop goes will slow the game down as well as sloppy butcher. Whispers and BBQ&amp;C will help you keep momentum.
---
This must be a news articles taken from some dark time line
---
I see Sprint burst all the times at red ranks in my games and watching streamers play alike. I honestly hate it as a killer and sometimes in frustration I won't even chase them .
---
or just a limit, huntress you can insta down the first x times she throw an hatchet
---
i use mori only if i see that i stand against 3/4 swf.
---
Its big brain time
---
Apparently killers just can't feel fulfilled unless they kill all 4 survivors every game. That's why hatch had to be nerfed! Can't have that pesky last survivor getting away.
---
ok ill try to make something put of it
---
The Pixar pounce
---
Like the most part of people on this subreddit he is a rank 1 X main where X can be survivor or killer, depending on what you are talking about. Lol
---
Not ganna lie bro, this is edgy as fuck, but also kinda sick
---
They are both fine so stop bitching about them  and move! Jeez!
---
Huntress' only very strong build was machine gun huntress and now it's gone. IH are easy to deal with because of how slow the wind up is.
---
I‚Äôm about to sprint burst, dance with me, head on some people. Max power.
---
There‚Äôs a few kind of memey more cutesy fanart pieces of him trying to sabo hooks
---
‚ÄúDamn, can‚Äôt believe I lost to a coordinated team of good survivors running strong perks.‚Äù
---
thank you!!
---
I feel so called out.
---
I switched from PS4 to an Inspiron gaming dell laptop. My game has lower graphics (like it drops below low lol) but the frame rate is way better. 
---
It‚Äôs a gamble with both, PS4 imo feels more fun because everyone is playing on crap frames (although the graphics are locked at a higher setting so it‚Äôs pretty) but PC feels way smoother and better for when I‚Äôm sweatin‚Äô on dbd
---
you need to end your chases quickly. use your chainsaw a lot to practice with it.
---
whenever you're not chasing anyone and the map's open-enough, you should be sprinting around the map with your chainsaw between gens
---
if you down someone and you see someone else close by, sometimes it's a good idea to leave the downed person and go for another down (or at least a hit) if you think you'll be able to smack them before they pick up your previous victim
---
Mood
---
Literally always man, when hes doesnt use ruin he states it like 50 times each time a generator is done. He salty AF person but he tries to hide it alot thats why it comes out funny like this.
---
Which one is supposed to be the power role again?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cnzwa8/exit_gate_bug_on_xbox/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Those ranks
---
Guess I just have to practice being stealthy or being good at kiting. Thanks, hope I don‚Äôt have to see an Ebony Mori too often
---
dude. My god, we are not talking about fucking skill here. If a rank 1 mobile player goes against a rank 1 pc player, the pc player will still have an advantage despite them having the same skills. The platform matters. Controlling characters isn't easy on console or mobile. Nurse wouldn't be the weakest killer on mobile if it depended on skill like you said. Once again, pc players have a big advantage because of fast screen turning.
---
Typical Reddit loving people that break the law
---
Lol I wish mate, it‚Äôs a guaranteed death for me when I notice a Mori but I can do that only so many time before the guilt catches up, might as well try to learn how to play against it
---
Guess I just have to practice and be better than the killer
---
I have the pallets/windows/lockers set to Square and gen interactions ect set to R1.
---
Survivor perks: *computer from DHMIS*
---
Killer perks: who would win 4 people with toolboxes and perks to break them hooks or, 1 stabby Lad who can't see blood
---
Bbq, enduring,  ruin and spirit fury / whspers. Once you feel like you can play without ruin then switch it out with one of the two i mentioned last.
---
You may wanna slug sometimes as billy,  but only if you are falling behind or see the opportunity to get down multiple players in the same area. 
---
Keep practising!
---
I believe it has around 5-6 god pallets with 0 bloodlust potential. You can easily cut down loops by fake respecting so the surv runs through, then backrev them.
---
Not yet. We had our mid chapter patch already so I‚Äôd say next week or so we should be seeing hints and the PTB again so hang tight.
---
Soon^TM
---
the only way i can read this is like a monster truck announcer on tv and it kills me every time
---
Borrowed Time helps others off the hook. Maybe they can escape and lose the killer and avoid the mori. 
---
I like to combine dead hard and lightweight. I can make it to the pallet with dead hard if I am close and run over trapper traps. Lightweight they lose my tracks faster.
---
It's a normal match, I  didn't  pay attention in the lobby and I was afk  during the loading screen when I got to my PC I was surprised when I saw two killers in my match.
---
is it me or lag switchers tent be always playing Myers or the doctor
---
it's not a fun build since most of your games it would have been a waste of perk slots.
---
Doesn't the progression system try to get you to get every survivor to at least lvl 40 tho? I mean technically you can do that without ever playing said survivor but it still seems like thats what the game want's you to do so you gain all the unique perks
---
when you want that chest BUT the entity said not today &lt;/3 sacrifice 10 baby dweight and you might get it next time
---
It‚Äôs just bloodlust.
---
Killers come out every 3 months, new one will be in September plus we just got the freddy rework.
---
I play both sides (a bit more killer because of BP) and I honestly think that the game (core gameplay) is really well balanced right now. However, there are certain perks, addons and maps that need to be looked into.
---
Make sure you return it
---
3 times but it didn‚Äôt come at all last year but twice the year before
---
im pretty sure this game isn't even on mobile so i dunno why u keep bringing mobile up... Plus even if there were crossplay, they would never include mobile lol. Mobile is obviously trash and could never compete with any other platform.
---
The ONLY reason console players like yourself don't want crossplay: Because your afraid of running from a good nurse. guess what, pc survivors play against nurses all the time, and running from a nurse with a mouse and keyboard is NOT any easier than running from a Nurse with a Controller.
---
When I was playing Myers I once was called a "one-button motherfucker". Guess I was not allowed to use m1. Luckily the rest of the survivors laughed at it with me.
---
Is this some console meme that I‚Äôm too PC to understand?
---
Thank you I'll keep that in mind
---
I once played with a streamer who got harassed, sandbagged, bodyblocked etc. by a toxic as fuck Jake, I ended up camping the streamers hook as wraith and when the jake came up to save her I just mori'd the shit outta him right there on twitch. It was glorious
---
**god said no**
---
 I'm not a console player, I play on mobile. What I'm trying to say is that nurse is weaker in Console, the weakest on mobile and the best on PC. And why do you think she is bad and good. Because of the goddamn platform. And IT IS easier for pc survivors to go against good nurses because, saying it again. Faster screen turning for better and more jukes. This idea has been said before and its never coming in the game.
---
Yeah, it was nerfed into the ground.
---
Just don't go in lockers lol
---
Nah, report that guy for holding the game hostage
---
Ugly quentin looks better
---
Why not **BOTH**
---
It‚Äôs nerfed because people abused the old timer
---
Already did that. Guys like these are scum. He DC'd after he got hooked lmao
---
I didnt watch the dev stream is he getting nerfed or something ?
---
I like to imagine if this was a movie or something you basically slid right off his shoulder into the hatch, musta been a bit scary!
---
Survivors are trying to hide evidence.
---
I think I'd still say that instadowns are less offensive since you get the benefits so much more directly from the insta heal med kits. You get to choose exactly when to use it, who you wish to use it on and on any part of the map.  
---
When it comes to insta downs you most often need to fulfil special demands through perks or silly add-ons, but even with something like Michaels Tier 3 you still have to carry the survivor to the hook or slug and risk them getting up without hooking anyone at all even after getting a successful hit on one of the four survivors.
---
this is an old bug that they claimed to have fixed
---
I play in group of 4 people and we are in between rank 8-18 there is almost never a 4 man so I could invite you I‚Äôm you want.
---
Oiink
---
Yep, that's the point. As a survivor I spend around 200000 bloodpoints, it's around 10-12 games, around 3-4 hours of gameplay to get one syringe. And I use it in one game, it doesn't even guarantee an escape, if you get potato teammates what game, you just straight up wasted it and it's another grind to get one more syringe.
---
Such a game changing bug where you cant use perks recover wiggle or even escape through exit gates. Yet the dev's just wanna add new cosmetics and continues to watch their game crash due to new bugs that they are too lazy to fix like. If they could make their game right for once
---
I feel boil over needs a little buff
---
Hit me up, I and the boys can help you.
---
THOSE ARE THE BEST KINDS OF MATCHES AS TRAPPER! THE SURVIVORS HAVE TO TAKE A GAMBLE USUALLY LOSE SAID GAMBLE
---
I went in with a match of 3 flashlighters, i was using casual perks for farming, and no hillbilly anti-flashlight perk cause i didn't have it. I didn't camp you. Even if you t-bagged, blocked the hooks and pathways and tried to get a rise out of me by click clicking, i just chilled and hooked you and your clan members 5 times total, and in the end two survivors would have been one hook away from getting sacrificed. Naturally you get to leave the match without losing anyone, no biggie. I even went to the first gate to send you guys off. Didn't really bother coming to the second gate cause i knew how you would have welcome me there. Waste your time if you like, i don't mind. I'm not really even mad. Not really. I just want you to understand this: You were a fucking asshole towards me, and i could have been a fucking asshole back to you, but i wasn't. The least you could do is not throw an "ez" in the after game chat. You look fucking ridiculous.
---
He kicks people back to the lobby
---
Baby dweets will always be protected. You cannot attack a baby dweet, it‚Äôs a crime. Fool
---
God I feel so awkward. Like, do I take up juggling or some shit to keep people entertained while I wait 15 minutes for a game? üò®
---
Sounds about right tbh
---
its random when it shows if you just happen to have on gaming headsets you'll hear wind sound coming from it and fyi if you close it endgame will begin and you can strategically make the last person go unlock the gate but never the less the catch closes and they have to go then unlock the gate but if you just happen to be there when they jump wait a lil while like a sec or so and press the attack button to grab them and one last thing be aware of players who have keys regardless if you close the hatch or not they just can jump right in and these people can escape with someone else ending the game early and you loose potential kills as well
---
I know right  some people it was kind of funny though
---
Thanks for the information, didn't know you cant grab now
---
Tbh it‚Äôs also time played, what I mean is how it usually goes for me is down pip against a Mori, safety against a good player with red or purple add ons and then up pip against every thing else . So the more I play the closer I get to rank 1 if don‚Äôt play as much dbd my swr would stay at a high rank for that month but that doesn‚Äôt make me bad unless I have played a lot. Personally I think there should be a pip per game average each month a bit like a K/D from cod so it would be easier to see the players skill.
---
I‚Äôve actively tipped off the killer to useless teammates like this. I don‚Äôt do it often but if me and two others are working our asses off and that fourth teammate is literally no where to be found until after I die and spectate and see they‚Äôre hiding somewhere, I get pissed and message the killer telling them where the idiot is hiding. I‚Äôve also had a clown follow me to a locker and I pointed at it to get that fucker hooked, who immediately DC‚Äôed after first hook.
---
Thanks for the info my dudes.
---
I believe it's a visual glitch. Otherwise, some people claim that it happened to them and it wasn't a visual glitch, but it never happened to me, if you're sure it's not a visual glitch, send a ticket to the support.
---
Yup.
---
And now people abuse the new timer.
---
Yeah a separate 2v8 or 2v10 casual mode would be nice to have. It would bring some much needed variety into the game.
---
#DwightLivesMatter
---
KingDeDeDeputy
---
Yeah but it is still hard to get to red rank and be bad at the game plus what about the times you de pip due to total bull shit like dying first hook 2 minuets in because you spawned basically beside a billy
---
It's supposed to be fixed since last hotfix.
---
And then Claudette gets onetapped by MYC
---
2v8 will never happen, doubling both killers and survivor by itself doesnt balance it the game, 4 more survivors worth more than 1 more killer. In proportion, games will just end at a faster rate cuz you have more people working on gens, its way easier to gen rush cuz its way harder to alply presure on bigger maps, u will make just a couple killers wven worth playing there (nurse, hillbilly huntress and maybe spirit and hag)
---
When I use Unbreakable, the killer doesn't slug.
---
When I don't use Unbreakable, the killer is running all slugging perks.
---
I swear, it happens too often!
---
Doc has the weird build of no shock doc where you use the add-ons that shrink your TR and monitor to have  0 tr
---
What‚Äôs OoO
---
Beard david though
---
Don‚Äôt you get the perk when you start Adam Francis?
---
I think the difference is that In this game a lot is completely out of your control unless you 4 man swfs. Like you can't control that your teammate is stupid(or malicious) enough to unhook you in front of killer mid chase. You can't help that your teammate is dumb enough to lead killer to the Gen you're working on. You just can't do anything about stupid teammates but deal with their stupid.
---
That and nothing is worse than a bad killer having a great game because your teammates were just that extra special level of stupid.
---
Id take variety though there might be a problem with op killer combos which might be why its not been implemented yet since the killers would then have to be balanced with interaction with other killers in mind
---
Yet i wasn't useless and actually doing gens. Spine Chill went off and that was my first instinct. I was gonna come out when he left and continued the gen. Always done that and it never fails me.
---
Sadly not, I unsubbed a while ago because I stopped enjoying his videos, that went from tricks when chasing to crying whenever survs wouldn't make blatant mistakes.
---
I'll check it out, though. Got link?
---
Bro! That traumatized me at the theater. Didn't see a home release though. Creepy asf mansion
---
Not true, hatch was nerfed because of boring  standoffs which could last for hours sometimes and were really stupid. Also end game collapse was introduced because some survivors would just never leave your game and keep it hostage
---
Staying near hooks is a stratergy and is not toxic. If i dont stay near the hook another survivor saves them. If i guard it for a bit before leaving the nearby survivor would risk damage. Teabagging on the otherhand really should stop and is a sign of toxicity
---
Difference is there is one killer and four survivors.
---
Imagine comparing needing to actually hit a chainsaw or stalk for a long time and then get looped to pressing M1
---
It's a useless perk
---
This will make other survivors come to help and end up getting downed in the process.
---
People saying that are the most inside-the-box thinkers I've ever heard  
---
"He doesn't align enough with the current mechanics in the game, and thereby would be a detriment to game-health!"  
---
bEhaviour are doing a pretty good job so far, they've got 1 or 2 smart guys in there. I'm sure if they put enough effort in they could make a fire Chucky killer with an all new and interesting playstyle
---
Cleanse the DAMN TOTEMS
---
Don't forget that when the obsession gets unhooked, the rescuer becomes the new obsession.
---
This can lead to some insane tactics.
---
&gt;Wraith is good. There‚Äôs nothing they can tweak or change without making his power lame or OP.  
---
  
---
Buffing Swift Hunt so that you don't have to use the green and purple rarities in order to cut off a whole six tenths of a second from his 3 second uncloak, or simply reducing uncloak time? Removing the unnecessary penalty of Windstorm? Adding more Ghost rarities? Making Serpent not the second worst killer add-on in the game? Increasing his base cloaked movement speed to a higher amount so that he isn't slower than a max stack Tier 3 PWYF? Lightburn? There are changes that Wraith needs in order to be considered a viable killer, the mobile version of DbD even removed his shimmer (possibly due to graphical restraints, but I have yet to see a single person complain about that), that alone would be a buff that prevents him from getting crippled on most outdoor maps while also keeping him vunerable to detection abilities.  
---
&gt;Before any more killers get changed I think the base chase mechanics need an overhaul.  
---
That's actually an interesting idea, do you have any ideas as to how chase mechanics should be revamped/overhauled or is it something you'd trust BHVR creating providing it doesn't make things worse?  
---
&gt;Also, if you think Wraith is first in line you‚Äôve got it all the way twisted. Doctor has BEEN waiting.  
---
I'd honestly prefer if Wraith was low priority when it comes to tweaks and changes considering I'm mostly content with his changes that came with Spirit, but killers like Legion, Doctor, Bubba, or even Clown should receive substantial changes before Wraith and Plague do.
---
It's actually the best perk if you're going sabo squad. Doesn't matter if you get knocked down because there's nowhere to hook you. Killer can't just slug you because you can get up every single time.
---
It's useful for mindgaming them, same as with monitor and abuse that increases your terror radius. If you get to a building or walls where they can't see you directly, you could trick them into thinking you're further away than you actually are.
---
But this requires a lot of mindgames. If you're not that good at mindgames then it's best to use a better perk instead
---
You forgot the doctor tier up noise.
---
Better than her coming back with a teleport.
---
That what I mean tho, it's really a one trick pony, not really worth it compared to other perks. I find more use out of urban evasion.
---
I guess to me it's just not worth adding to my perks, there is just more useful ones xD
---
They did that intentionally because vaulting a pallet used to make you unchainsawable because  your chainsaw hits the pallet hit box before the survivors once they've started a vault.
---
Little story I was playing as David on ormond and there was another David in the lobby. I was hooked and when he saved me I ran into the middle house for the pallet because I was getting kind of tunnelled. I drop the pallet and turn my camera to see how close I was to hitting him. It turns out I accidentally sandbagged the living hell out of David the killer hit him but kept chasing me before I eventually lost him.
---
Rarity doesn't contribute much because you're not quite aware of the level of tryhard people go into a match with
---
Especially killers; we enjoy not going overkill because it's just not fun.
---
Thanks!
---
This brainlet Claudette picture is amazing, and I think it represents a lot of Claudettes out there
---
Prove thy self q
---
Exactly, its feels so clunky and fov is so bad. And it takes so long that the survivor has enough time to make it to a other loop
---
I love this sharpline style with the gritty textures.   
---
Absolutely awesome piece &lt;3
---
&gt;That would be a lot easier to penalise cause the individual is using an extra program to basically cheat by matching him with another player repeatedly.
---
That is not how MLGA work but this "problem" should be solved when dedicated servers go live (MLGA won't work anymore). After that, all tru3 has to do is hide his screen when creating the lobby.
---
"Fuckin' kids... Always making too much noise."
---
Once I was in a match with Tombstone Myers.  We had a toxic Nea running Bond.  She got my friend killed.  We didn't think too much of it, until she found me and wouldn't leave me alone.  She kept bobbing her head up and down.
---
When we came across my friend's body, she took his item and repeatedly teabagged him.  He was pissed.  So to get revenge, because I figured I'd die anyways, I took her to a generator and purposely failed the skill check, making Michael come to us. 
---
I urban evasioned away while he killed her, grabbed my friend's item, and sneaked around the ambulance while our other friends dragged Michael away enough for me to get the hatch when she died.
---
I wish I'd recorded it. üò•
---
maybe new killer causes ‚Äúwhen m2 on survivor, cause the undetectable debuff unless ______ happens‚Äù it‚Äôs kinda weird since a lot of stealth killers can already accomplish this but maybe it only affects a few survivors at a time? maybe it‚Äôs even a perk
---
No, feral frenzy still works. Ambush doesn't however.
---
You left out the fact that the green one requires the person of your choice to be hooked once before you can kill them, everything else was fine :)
---
Same I posted it on here tho ppl got real salty about it
---
&gt;dying light should be fixed though
---
Agreed. It promotes nothing but tunneling and some times it even comes with an Ivory Mori.
---
Yeah I figured that would happen so I don‚Äôt post about it lol.
---
Seems like upvote bait to me; smh killer mains want survivors to not even run and they hate fun challenging chases they all want us to be awful nerfed killers will HATE this post  /s
---
It's the same on ps4 sometimes. Pc too
---
This is so accurate. So many braindead survivor mains say shit like this because theyve never played a killer match in their lives and have no idea what theyre talking about or how ridiculous it sounds.

Bro, that scared me

apply directly to kneecaps!

All that time spent opening his locker to just get downed lol.
---
I posted a video like this the day. She can also throw them at generators to make this happen and it allows her to control a side of a generator that way.
---
Never have, the only time I'm on the street on this map is when I'm actively being chased
---
Fair maybe its just me. I feel like in a chase it is easier for him to stalk you than it is to reveal him. But outside of his power he doesnt have much else going for him.
---
If you could tell no one was coming you should have tried to escape yourself

If you ever wanna play on PC hit me up - Rank 11

I‚Äôll be playing tonight from 6PM - 11PM EST

The frequency of Moris is typically more leaned in the ebony favor, mainly because events give them out like candy and survivors end up with either party starters or cake, I literally have not - in my entire DbD career, went against a killer with a mori that wasn‚Äôt ebony. Moving forward, the insta heal is a add on that gives survivors one extra shot. One. While killers paint the picture of having a group of survivors all with insta heals - it just does not happen that often, at least not uncoordinated, and even then it is still one use each, uses the entire fucking Med kit in one go, and honestly is kinda fair when it comes to game lore since Vigo is a thing.
---
Also Noed sorta voids this entire argument off rip, game is still very much asymmetrical because you literally disable the use of an item entirely - and totems are not as easy to find as people make them out to be, let alone cleanse when the thing is patrolled by a hawk.
---
Sounds like we're gonna need the Ninja Turtles.
---
I rarely see Ghostface players playing as Myers. I'm a rank 1 killer every season and there isn't a game where I stand in the middle of a field and stalk a survivor. I don't think  Yosh1kage_k1ra or any serious player would do such a foolish thing either. All Ghostface players try to get an angle on an unsuspecting survivor and stalk them until being broken out.
---
The problem is that he is the only stealth killer who can be broken out by looking at him - the single most ridiculous and easiest counter for any killer bar none in the history of video games probably. And it can be done by any survivor at any point, downed or hooked, or just glancing at a distance. No other stealth killer or one-shot killer has such a disadvantage so giving him that long of cooldown is.. well it's absurd.
---
Leatherface/Billy has a cooldown of a few seconds and they are one shot-killers. There is no cooldown for Myers's stalking and you cannot do anything to break him out of it but hide. You cannot break Pig's crouch nor break Wraith's cloaking except by flashlight or by pallet stunning. Again no stealth killer is at more of a disadvantage than Ghostface, nor any one-shot killer.
---
- The distance a hooked/downed survivor should be able to break him out of stealth should be a max of 16 meters - that takes care of the "built in Insidious/camping" worry from the devs. Anything more than that and it's no longer about camping fears, it's about screwing over the killer on purpose.
---
- The cooldown of his power should be, at max, 15 seconds.
---
- As for non-hooked/survivors: Either 1. Only the survivor he is stalking should be able to snap him out of stealth or.. 2. Just like hooked/downed survivors.. non-hooked survivors can only break him out of stealth if they are within 16 meters of Ghostface. None of this being halfway across the map and breaking him out of it nonsense.
---
Yea, while I‚Äôm over here with my 5-blink noed p3 ebony mori and bbq &amp; chili nurse.
---
R1 Wraith here... I use "The Ghost" - Soot and Bone Clapper (seriously he doesn't need to rely on the higher tier add ons, these are more than fine). Sure pressure is very important, as with all killers, but people dont understand how important body blocking is for wraith. It is so insanely easy to get people stuck when they can't see exactly where you are in space or where your hit box is. With the add ons no one ever knows if they are the one getting uncloaked on. He has incredible ability to pressure, you really do just need to learn to play him.
---
Well, trapper/hag/Freddy also have a perk that cownter them
---
you need to do something to gain instadowns and in the case of NOED, do the motherfuking bones. instaheals aren‚Äôt counterable. MYC, just run away, the killer is far away, Devour Hope, just break the totem, probably breaks in the first 10 seconds anyway.etc.

---
Thanks
---
Well yeah, but the main problem is at least one person will have Spine Chill, its more of an urgent issue imo
---
M1 killers can get insta downs to, there's like half a dozen perks around it, with a couple of them being a part of the meta.
---
You see I want the perk to be useful, it's function is adding that extra hit of endurance and by the sounds of it, you are saying that extra hit is too OP already no matter what, so I can see I can't convince you to even make the perk useful because for some reason your main issue with the perk is the actual activation of it, my main argument was that there are several mechanics that already do this, so they should be OP too, but you're saying they aren't considering the hoops you got to go through to activate them, I'm just pointing out that you have to do so with MoM as well, just different requirements.
---
If you want to force the stacks, you're still benefiting the killer, having everybody divebomb the killer to get their free protection hits, or hypothetically if they were to divebomb the hook for safe unhooks if they were proposed to come back like people have been suggesting including me in my original post, this will make other perks such as Mad Grit or Make Your Choice more popular to even counter MoM harder, which I can only see as a good thing for better perk diversity. As well as the aforementioned exposed perks for the latter function of MoM.
---
I want the perk to be good, as well as the 100+ other perks that range from dogshit tier to meme tier, and having them play off each other as hard and soft counters as well as being good on their own is a way to do that.
---
r/Egg_irl ?
---
I do understand what you mean, maybe I should have clarified what I meantt better, but english isn't my main language, so I guess I fucked that up. What I meant by that is, if you look at surv perks, they drastically change the way they play, for example Balanced landing will let you use nearly infinites, which straight up don't exist without it or burrowed time will allow you to disregard a killer who's standing next to you, as long as you are full health and get a save unhook. It just feels like Killers have to counteract survivor perks with their perks instead of having the survivors react to theirs, for example you only really use ruin because you lose in 4 minutes if you don't with most killers against good survivors, and yes, survivors need to counter hex perks, but they're not that hard to counter and if you manage to cleanse them they're just a dead perk slot. You just can't be creative as killer if you want to ''win'', you really need top tier perks or you'll just lose, survs on the other hand can choose between so many different perks which define their playstyle, you can go urban and sprintburst or something, just make sure to get adrenalin and you're all set, maybe DS since DS is just a really good fuck you to getting hooked again.
---
Maybe ping. Lag spikes. I'll close app if I noticed something wrong with my movement.
---
You sure all killers are good enough?
---
Why are you in the locker though?
---
No I fully understand what you're saying, but I also understand you are wrong. With a team you can do this every game if the killer has noed. If you are soloquing, you can still get it at a 1/5 time if you have good game sense
---
pretty-good-job-so-far guy :)
---
Salt build finds salt, news at 11
---
Yeah but if you have windstorm you can cloak walk past someone and body block. Of course you can body block when you sneak up to someone, they dont know you're there so the speed doesnt matter
---
Spine Chill went off, decided to hide till he was gone, work back on the gen. I always do it and it never has been a problem
---
idk homie more like fuckin cioccolatta
---
One day you'll go against maiden and you'll curse getting into lockers forever lmao
---
And then they Mori you once the 3rd Survivor is sacrificed.
---
September killer is Spirit/Wraith hybrid after Spirit vores the shit out of Wraith
---
Been there, done that. Didn't use the lockers during those matches
---
When playing killer I am perfectly happy to meet anyone's vengeful needs if they lead me to That One Survivor.
---
Probably kill you afterwards too, but at least you'll have some satisfaction in the process.
---
And you sound like a basement dwelling Leatherface who gets sad that his insidious camp didn't work
---
I get th all the time I mained hag so I never have to camp ever and still get hate mail lol. Funniest  one was when I got called a teleporting whore
---
If you get hit by DS, you're most likely playing wrong and only applying pressure to one survivor and letting the rest roam free. I stand by my point that DS, as an anti-tunnel perk is weak af
---
Yeah most of the times when I run boil over, I sabotage hooks and even then that perk is really good when it makes them run into stuff. That is funny though and that‚Äôs good that he let y‚Äôall out.
---
Do you stream with people able to see your ruin within the first seconds of the match?
---
I was just reading about how useless Furtive Chase is as a perk. Could it have some potential on Legion?
---
I have over 3500 hours and i had no idea it alarms the hag.
---
i feel your flesh
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Bc in this scenario, we didn't deserve the 1 hit down. We failed our objective. And if anyone is gonna tell me that if 4/5 totems get cleansed but one slips through the cracks that Surviviors deserve to get hit with Noed, I'mma guess that those guys burn Ebony Moris on the first day of rank reset so they can bully low Rank Surviviors
---
I mean he constantly says he doesn‚Äôt tunnel but tunnels all the time. Granted, it‚Äôs almost always justified, but I mean, practice what you preach.
---
Oh really? All I hear from him is ''that was good'' if he gets outplayed, bbut maybe I'm just missing the hateboner
---
&gt;I do that to, especially because it is more points.
---
Is what Mightybeard said, in reference to waiting until after 2nd hook to mori.
---
By 'MORE' he is saying 'MORE THAN hooking once and then moring'.
---
This is the conversation as it was intended, with all ambiguity removed:
---
Person 1 (rkx koops): I prefer to only mori when I'm sure that they've been hooked twice, instead of moriing them when they've only been hooked once. I think this is fairer and makes the mori not too overpowered. I'm giving them more of a chance.
---
Person 2 (mightybeard): Yes, I do that too. Not only that, but by hooking them twice and then using the mori, I actually get more bloodpoints than the alternative of only hooking once and then using the mori. As you have quite rightly pointed out sir, it is fairer to the survivor, isn't as cheap, and of the two different options, I then get more bloodpoints by having an additional hook.
---
NOBODY: I like to hook twice and then mori BECAUSE that is more points than 3 hooks.
---
Nobody said that last part, whether it is true or not. The confusion was that masterbungle assumed that's what Person 2 meant when he said 'it is more points.'
---
Here are three options:
---
* hook once and mori = A
---
* hook twice and mori = B
---
* hook three times = C
---
Persons 1 and 2 were agreeing that B earns more points than A. Person 3 waded into the conversation talking about C, but nobody was initially talking about that at all.
---
Me: ''Wait. Its a clown, why do they have sleep timer? That doesn-... Oh well nevermind.''
---
^oh
---
One Myers creeps me out enough. I would uninstall the game if two or more would stalk me at once
---
Disturbed Ward main building and Ironworks broken infinite is just painful to play as killer. Whenever survivors go to those 2 places I immediately ignore them. 
---
Lery's is indeed very boring to play but it's clearly killer sided. When I play survivor on Lery's feels like a challenge to find a generator in the middle of those stupid rooms.
---
Why about scary terry? ^Bitch
---
True but the bonus bloodpoints you get from bbq help the grind
---
I never understand people complaining about Make Your Choice. Unless the killer is already at the edge of the radius waiting to come back it's really easy just walk away slowly and hide if you see them coming. Sure, it makes you play immersed for a bit but it's better then getting one-shot.
---
Tier 3 bloodlust with NOED and three tokens of play with your food.
---
Haha, I'm in danger.
---
Don't run, only when chased.
---
&gt;NOED rewards you for protecting bones and applying enough pressure that survivors decided to Gen rush.
---
Where in your directive from the entity was protecting dull totems part of your job? 
---
Also, genrushing does not exist. Surviviors have one objective. Do you want them to go around with their thumb up their ass while you get looped? How entitled are you?
---
Noed is the "I'm entitled to these kills even if you beat me" perk. You get a free Bloodlust and perma-injure every Survivior. And all you have to do is pray to God 1 dull totem slips through the cracks. Adrenaline is Surviviors getting rewarded for making it to the endgame and doing their objective.
---
So does crouching tho
---
Bro thats Pocho from Brawl Stars lmao
---
Both of them are toxic XD
---
Because its unfun, and no I'd show you my survivor rank levels and prestiges compared to my shit killer levels.
---
Off the hook and into the hatch. If I was killer that game, I'd be crying
---
New hatch make it so a survivor can escape no matter the state of the game, 0 or 5 gens done. What are you talking about.
---
Probably 10 times whenever I'm on that map lol
---
I think the spirit needs no collision during her phase, and her vault animation should be changed. I don‚Äôt like how she can mind game by just standing still, but that won‚Äôt change
---
Nurse is great, but great nurses make me wanna kms
---
Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure.
---
Lery‚Äôs is easy for a survivor windows everywhere, the exit gates aren‚Äôt ever close, generators are difficult to 3 gen 
---
Tbh the only downside is if you get middle basement or totems.
---
Message them that you‚Äôre going to fuck them in the ass. Ultimate power move.
---
But what if copycatting would block aura reading for impersonated survivor.
---
Swf ruins that anyway.
---
it already is
---
slightly tunnelling? lmao she is clearly delusional...
---
and he/she whatever said proud moment? haha üòÇ
---
Nope. 
---
Max reduction is 16m, legion has a 32m radius. You can't chase someone while being 16m away
---
He wasn't camping the hook, he was camping the chest.
---
That's not the "salt" build.
---
Look at it from killer side: gens are done too fast.
---
Ruin extends time for a solo gen by about 15 seconds (assuming there are 3 skill checks and none of them are hit).
---
And extends duo gen to the normal 80 secs (assuming 3 skill checks for both sides).
---
Its either that or get silver In gatekeeper every match.
---
Maybe give out some gameplay tips or fun facts. Talk about something you like/dislike in the game, I don‚Äôt know..
---
EVERYTHING HRRRGHHAAAAGRH
---
Yeah, i get a bit depressed when such a thing happens to me as well, but hey, comebacks exist, and there are killers whose power increases exponentially with the amount of gens popped (Trapper and Doctor for example are extremely powerful in 3-gen situations).
---
Scary
---
oh what?
---
Your camera control and movement suggests that while that account has 30 hours... you have hundreds on another.
---
This video is literally him making 50 different excuses üòÇ
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
I main Hag too, she is ridiculously fun to play. Dunno why people are pissed with her, she is pretty low tier. As a survivor  i'd much rather verse a Hag than a Shitbilly/Nurse/Spirit.
---
Should be the noise of a totem being destroyed. One moment it‚Äôs relatively quiet and then BOOOOOOOOM! It never fails to get me to jump.
---
On console? That's an EZ communication ban my man, do not do this.
---
And that's exclusively because of lack of mobility and map pressure on certain killers. But that's always gonna be like that, I mean you can't give teleports and blinks to everyone. Bubba will always Bubba, there's no way to make him S tier. But they can improve his performance with tweaking addons and QoL changes.
---
Show more cleavage.
---
The Tenno use the keys but they are mere trespassers

Thank you for the compliment! But I don't, I just play a lot of video games. I only started playing DbD when it came to Game Pass.

You KILLed as a KILLer?!? How dare you!!
---
And then they dc or complain when you play the actually good killers
---
Fair.
---
You mean stupid survivors fall for a camping LF, then get mad when they are the dumbasses who fell for it?
---
Ultimate flex tho.

Don‚Äôt do this.

I hate this twat

This is old news... This killer was introduced ever since the game released.

The worst jumpscare for me is getting hit by the pigs ability while she has the power drill cosmetic on. That noise is so loud.

Yes, but not that much better. He will still get genrushed unless he is given the opportunity to teleport or run with a saw, like a hillbilly (which will never happen). Maybe I'm wrong, but that's my opinion.

Did you not pay attention when I pointed out that there are 4 killers with base instadown abilities? The cost of a insta heal is that you lose the medkit in its entirety, not charges, the entire thing.

This is an awful idea. Just don't get hooked and you can't get mori'd.

thanks for addressing 2 points out of all that.

I really really love these perks, and also your other icons. But could it be that you forgot about killer perk Whispers? It really looks awful to have one perk that is normal in the middle of dozens of cool ones

Yeah I regret it

My understanding is you could grab before the EGC starts, but not during.

This post makes no sense and you are plain idiot

It‚Äôs sad that he uses Freddy enough for it to be level 14 lol
---
Eh mori's are a rare annoyance. Been climbing with survivor and its been awhile since someone even brought a mori.
---
So instants on both sides. I can certainly understand that.
---
its not about rank, its about how many players are in your region, if  there is none, use a VPN or proxy to set yourself to a new region, changing it in steam doesn't work anymore.
---
I think that‚Äôs a great way to put it. With your idea for the new Mori and how you have to perform 4 or 6 hook actions to kill obsession is a good idea. I just think it would be overshadowed by the perk Rancor. But nonetheless good idea

I mean, even in the "Salty Tru ragequit" video posted down below he was congratulating people who outplayed him on each pallet. He only lost his shit when the survivors were trolling him and started making some pretty terrible plays because of that.
---
It's pretty widely known that most killers can't hack it at higher ranks. Ruin doesn't do anything if Survivors can hit skill checks consistently. Adrenaline is the worst "Win More" perk the Survivors have. Stating "I lost because of good survivors powering through Ruin" isn't an excuse, just like saying "I lost because the other team outplayed me" isn't an excuse. 
---
I'm not saying Tru doesn't get a bit preachy at times, and I'm not saying he isn't salty on occasion. But I really don't understand where the hate-boner for him comes from.

Yeah the amount of times i could have escaped but the killer had noed is crazy, it makes the game so much more unfun, and the insta heals are just so toxic because its usually followed by teabagging behind a pallet
---
Pair it with distressing for great range on your frenzy aura,comes out to something like 50 meter TR or so
---
Yes pls to Scary Terry and Dream Hipster
---
No fucking shit, really?
---
The first one with Arnold?
---
They‚Äôre just mad at those big brain moves.
---
LOL If that's all it took for you to stop playing a Killer, you're probably not playing them correctly. Since it is so easy to get STBFL Tokens with Feral Frenzy, I wouldn't be surprised if the Devs decide to make it only trigger on *basic* &amp; *Ambush attacks*.
---
To add to this, sure there are people who are assholes and get upset if they lose, but who cares? If you act like an asshole because those people exist, that makes you....an asshole (which is slightly different from dealing with someone who directly did something shitty to you in the game you are currently playing. Punishing someone for being an asshole is pretty reasonable, punishing everyone always because assholes exist makes you an asshole).
---
Yep.
---
Usually takes 5-10 mins to get a lobby as a survivor duo on Xbone for me sadly
---
That‚Äôs a good tactic actually... (and I‚Äôm a survivor main)
---
If his ability is good enough he wont get genrushed.
---
Adrenaline/BBQ+C.
---
Okay then
---
Yeah. Luckily with new freddy people like this will start learning you shouldn't camp and waste pallets. So many people are going to get downed because their precious pallets were fake.
---
I think they are just as annoying as survivors bringing a key and losing the game because of it. They are pretty damn equivalent IMO.
---
Other than when I‚Äôm forced to use a Mori (daily), I don‚Äôt use either keys or Moris. I think they are pointless. I didn‚Äôt wait in que forever leave the game early and lose out on BPs.
---
yes it's a beam that your teammates should only see if the killer can see it too then it's a bug
---
He lost my sub after many games of him making stupid, incredibly greedy plays that don't pan out and THEN blaming x,y and z for losing.
---
If a killer can't use Mori, survivors shouldn't use 4 toolboxes with brand new part too
---
&gt; Looks like you lost a bunch of chases 
---
No this is not how it works. Losing a chase gives less points than winning one. But if OP had a very short game where that was very few chases, it doesn't matter if he won all of them, he will get a poor score since he didn't win many chases.
---
His "poor gen defense" is mainly explained by not having ruins...
---
That guy is simply wrong, i replied to him.
---
*Laughs in asmathic clown*
---
So yesterday was the first day I played killer in one game that NO ONE disconnected and it was amazing. I killed everyone. I haven‚Äôt played killer much maybe 10 games or so and that‚Äôs the first time people didn‚Äôt DC on me.
---
No this is not how it works. Losing a chase gives less points than winning one. But if OP had a very short game where there was very few chases, it doesn't matter if he won all of them, he will get a poor score since he didn't win many chases.
---
I think this is a horrible idea thats what I think
---
Nah I‚Äôm in high school.
---
terrifying
---
It‚Äôs hard when playing solo survivor. But it feels so good when a team of randoms denies a noed.
---
Beast of prey is wonderful for bloodpoints, you'll Max out hinting just about every game with it.
---
I'm not so.  Much salty but rather frustrated with no feedback grabs
---
Man it ruins the game the most, yeah moris, Insta heals, and NOED are bad but they don't ruin it for everyone
---
I believe forcing Killers to leave 2 players alive at the end and "troll chase" them for 10 minutes is a silly system. If the killer dominated the game just end the fucking game so everyone can move on.
---
Specific offering/addon for legion that lets you pick between Frank and Joey/Susie and Julie
---
Also, gives the exposed effect to people when they use wrong pronouns
---
Ps: Trans rights!
---
Side note it's "You're not just wrong you're stupid."
---
I thought this was troll bait for a second. You must be new around here. Camping isn‚Äôt a crowd favorite.
---
Its from the map and its an addon to leave a beam. Also what do you mean "Confused the killer" they cant see it.
---
Has your opinion changed?
---
Oh man i agree, this is the worst from both sides for sure.
---
We have the lag and the leg, whats next
---
I can't wait for the archives to come out.
---
They messaged me and asked what the beam was. Think it may be a glitch because no one had a map on them either...
---
I am more annoyed by keys than insta heals.
---
If it's an Insidious LF and he got someone hooked, you can find me on the other side of the map cause I ain't going near that shit
---
What on earth does communication have to do with survivor perspective? Anyways, the original intent the devs had was that the survivors couldn't communicate, but the game was taken into a different direction as people kept playing and getting better and the addition of SWF which was requested by players. Now, SWF is being complained about as the game was never balanced around 4 survivors all having good communication. So, this creates an issue of how the game should be balanced. Removing SWF isn't an option as players enjoy being able to play with friends and other people, so that's not a viable solution. Only other solutions I can think of are what I mentioned above, or separating the current queue between casual and ranked, where ranked is solo queue only and you're of course ranked and casual is both solo and SWF.
---
Could of got it out a chest with an addon by utilising a perk which gives you addons to chest items. I can‚Äôt remember the name of it
---
level 14 really isn't a lot. You can play other killers casually even if they're not the best in the game lol
---
Leg

Doctor: REDDO HOT CHIRI PEPPA! -Sick guitar solo-
---
It makes the game scarier, which is the entire point of the game. Get over it.

Ace
---
Imagine getting shit for using your killer‚Äôs power this game sometimes
---
just level bubba, i did it and found my main, i love playing bubba
---
Is this from the journal you can buy?
---
Or have it be Glenda Tilly wearing a Chucky mask.
---
Imo survivors has too many perks that give them a second chance(borrowed time, unbreakable, Mettle of man, Decisive strike,etc), during the MoM meta it was nearly impossible to kill survivors during a game.
---
Anyway I don't see the issue in tunnelling a survivor, if you are good at looping you shouldn't have any problems. Tunnelling is the fastest way to kill a surv achieving the killer main objective. Many times a killer needs to sweat a lot in a chase and if he is able enough to down the survivor all of his work will be nullified.
---
Stay in the terror radius and your timer doesn't go down, you can easily do different stuff while the killer isn't even on you.
---
I don‚Äôt care. Let‚Äôs just see some cleavage.
---
You never really see her played at all in high ranks tho. I do agree that she can be very powerful, but people will flock to the same aforementioned trio of killers and won't even try something different for the most part.
---
HeRe CoMeS tHe TrApPeR

The speed you have to press the buttons for maximum toxicity is more prominent than one would think (at least on console) plus you have to hope you don‚Äôt, ya know, get a skill check that you miss in the midst of speedily using it and end up losing the insta and your medkit for no reason. Survivors have to manage their resources and environmental assets, that‚Äôs all they have, thus making the instakit a very sensible thing for them to have. Killers have the skill ceiling (which isn‚Äôt really all that high, let‚Äôs be honest, considering many people like pointing out, killers are supposed to be (AND ARE most of the time) op.) and gain the exposed as a result. Again, this can be used for the ENITRE trial(not referencing Noed but at that you get a significant speed boost AND the instadown? One perk can turn the entire game around for a killer, you can not compare something with that kind of power to Insta heals.),  whereas these survivors all have an extra shot, one each, to get a little closer to their objective which you just as quickly can thwart again at the expense of what? A little more effort?

Oh you meant it like this, yeah I didn't even realise, thanks lad
---
As a Freddy main, Freddy seriously needs new cosmetics.
---
Sounds like a lag switch
---
Wait does it not tell you lmao
---
The bad windows like grim pantry or iron works, and for killer side I would ban spirit fury
---
Don‚Äôt forget class photo Freddy! It rarely works, though...
---
Now THAT'S a knee slapper!
---
Is this Desperate Housewives?!
---
So the answer is no.
---
Im always connected to a router and all but one of the survivors pings were in the green and the other was yellow. So idk lol
---
The only DbD-only language to know is hook aerobics; waving your arms by spamming the beginning of the escape hook animation is means the killer is nearby and unhooks are unsafe, and is usually a sign of camping. This is especially important when it's a stealth camper, such as the wraith or insidious leatherface. However, players who don't know aerobics will often get impatient and wave their arms with the most widely understood meaning, so when dealing with the assorted antics of weaker players prepare for a lot of miscommunication.
---
The rest is fairly obvious to anyone who at all understands multiplayer games. Teabagging is naturally used as a greeting and a taunt (when in doubt assume the latter), the possible applications and meanings of the pointing and beckoning gestures are obvious, and the possible applications and meanings of the killer nodding and shaking their head and using with their weapon and powers is also quite obvious.
---
Don't lie, your mind was somewhere when you made it.  You regret nothing.
---
*laughs in Urban Evasion*
---
Beautiful
---
Ahhhhhh... a fellow intellectual I see. : &gt;)
---
Why thank u been working on it for a long time now
---
Oh man, don't give me these ideas, I'm a person of weak willpower :D
---
Yeah, just tested it. Hatch grabbing is totally gone.
---
I was that survivor yesterday and then I got fucking facecamped do not attempt survivor mains
---
BHVR make this a skin now idc abt the law do it
---
Mmm nah, they are definitely around the same. I‚Äôve recently lost a match because 2 survivors left as soon as the hatch spawned from a key they found in a chest.
---
Then her sign makes sense "respect our laws or we deport you" so i doubt she is talking about the ones that follow the law and apply for asylum. More likely she is targeting the ones that skip the asylum bit and find some low end job that brings in some money and skips taxes.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to remove the ability to fix generators.
---
Exactly my inspiration
---
Literally all income gets taxed, you moron
---
Early camping/tunneling and comms.
---
I mean i've sometimes literally had people die on hook because they did that. Fuck them lol
---
Survivor: The Ninja Turtles
---
Well the journal also contains it I believe
---
Disclaimer: this is suppose to be a shitpost for laughs, don‚Äôt take the suggestions too seriously
---
Lol I would love to see a LeJund with Scott's face on there, preferably from someone more talented than me
---
we dont hate survivors doing gens, we hate that a gen gets done solo in less time than the average m1 killer can patrol all 7
---
I didn‚Äôt say they shouldn‚Äôt be changed. For the time being we are stuck with them and you have to do your best to play around them.
---
I started running Deliverance and Decisive Strike just for the sheer meme value of being left and forgotten on the hook in solo queues.
---
I want to play as Jotaro in DBD now
---
This post was made by someone who cant play wraith apparently.
---
It happened to me today.
---
food at the store? sure, but thats still a very small amount of money compared to what average person is paying in taxes. Rent? no way, when you go to your landlord, who has not set up that he is for example renting out a room, but takes cash straight in hand from you? the government will eventually see that money thro being used elsewhere, but not nearly as much as they should, thats whats called tax evasion.
---
Imagine a perk where your obsession suffers from Oblivious for the whole game ;)
---
There‚Äôs more to it than that which you know so stop arguing. The asylum process isn‚Äôt hopping a barrier. You still need to explain the tax evasion they commit and learn about how to actually seek asylum in America.
---
most people just buy a custom made mask and then pair it with their big brothers hoodie, it's almost as bad as the plethora of dwights who just buy a dress shirt, smear it with dirt, and then put on some glasses.
---
Such toxicity on both sides
---
Im to poor to know thatüòÇ
---
yea this is how my last 4 or 5 games went with nurse.   im sitting here going "man apparently i really didnt get as godo with her as i thought"  and its still true, i'm not that good with her yet.  but yea i end up looking at the end screen and i'm playing against a bunch of single digits (i'm a lvl 14) and like 1 lvl 15 or something.
---
DC annoy me way more then Lag. Is also more common
---
Bubba op plzz nerf
---
around 700-600k
---
Still a better killer than legion
---
I low-key want Claire instead of Leon or Jill
---
theyre bs when you dont have an insta down :P
---
&gt;The Game is definitely not survivor sided though. That map is shit.
---
The map is a 100% RNG clusterfuck I'll give you that, but dude most of the pallets are unmindgamable chase breaking safe loops since the killer is forced to kick the pallet. And if a survivor brings balanced forget about it. I mean, there are like 5 safe pallets alone that spawn near the bathroom, how is that map not survivor sided?
---
WHEN I MAKE THE RIGHT PLAYS BUT STILL GET PUNISHED BECAUSE GOD FORBID A KILLER MISSES AN ATTACK STARTED AFTER THE VAULT IS COMPLETE. [UGHHHH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hM-1sOCwVw)
---
I like pop goes the weasel on spirit. Shes fast enough and lethal enough that she can find a worked on gen chase down the survivor (or even yoink them) hook, and bash the gen for easy regression.
---
have posted this on r/LeaksByDaylight ?
---
Except...most not applying.  They're just walking in intentionally flying under the radar.
---
Because they know asylum =/= "i want a better job"
---
The killer usually either has to work for for the instant down, has downsides, or it can somehow be prevented by survivors through normal gameplay.  
---
There's nothing the killer can do to prevent an instant heal. Franklin's can prevent self heals, but not off the hook instant heals.  
---
Rarity doesn't mean shit when people play way too much and only invest in one survivor/killer, since you are bound to get an ultra rare for every few games you play.
---
Leg so hot
---
Hot hot leg

Leg so hot you fry an egg
---
"Are generators completed too fast?"  
---
"No, it's the Killers who are to blame, just git gud."
---
RIP all M1 Killers, frankly even Spirit has this problem to some degree since she can't just teleport around strong loops - it lets her mindgame them a bit more than most, but generators still go faster than she does.
---
Oh this whole time I thought pip meant maxxing out a "unhook" "heal" etc. Thanks for clearing that up!
---
LMAO that Meg. Wastes an eternity self caring, gets downed anyway, dcs. Classic solo queue.
---
For killers, Ebony Mori. No question about it. Literally cuts the killers work in half, plus it usually means the first person hooked will be tunnelled when they are rescued. 
---
For survivors, probably the full insta-heals (but keys might be a close second). Nothing hurts more as a killer than finally downing a strong-loop survivor, only to have their friend run up and instantly heal them back to full health. 
---
As far as perks, they basically all have counter-play. Noed is annoying but can technically be countered and also stopped if the totem is found quick. Borrowed Time/Adren can be frustrating to deal with as killer, but they do still serve a purpose and have weaknesses to them. If I had to pick a perk to be ban, it would be Dying Light, because it encourages tunnelling.
---
A out time we get a criminal organization that are all highly trained ninjas!
---
That would be awful imagine tuft of hair and tombstone.
---
*you are a plain idiot (:
---
Dude I've had survivors DC because I downed them normally fair and square with Huntress, and another who DCed because I hooked them in the basement. DCs are not a measure of fair.
---
Lol.. Thanks..
---
I was thinking about a new killer and Hannibal Lector came to mind. His sleek psychotic persona would be such a nice addition. His weapon would be a steak knife or a kitchen knife but personally I think a steak knife would fit better after hitting a survivor he would then stick the knife in his mouth and clean it. His look would be a white T-shirt with the brown leather muzzle from the airport scene.
---
His ability would be centred around the fact he was an amazing doctor and a cannibal. I was thinking of something like he gains bloodlust 100% faster and for each tier of bloodlust all of he‚Äôs action speeds are increased by 20%. The second part is if he gets the survivor into bloodlust tier 3 then they either get put in the broken state for 2 minutes or they get exposed. His ability would be very good at high ranks making insta-heals useless and ending chases fast but not stupidly fast like nurse.
---
The names of his abilities would be (Clarice), (favs beans and a nice chianti) or a big amarone but I think chianti because it‚Äôs better known and finally (It‚Äôs always very important to try new things)
---
 
---
Clarice: you gain bloodlust tier 2 for 16/20/24 seconds after putting your obsession into the dying state. It will automatically go into tier 3 if chasing a survivor when the time runs out. After putting your obsession into the dying state the obsession is changed to the furthest survivor from you because Lector likes a challenge.
---
I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti: The hindered status affect is given to a survivor for 6/7/8 seconds after being hit because DR.Lector knows where it hurts.(this goes along with the name because the liver is associated with smoking which would lower you stamina and in hand speed).
---
It always important to try new things: having 1 survivor injured gives you a 2/3/4% speed boost. Having 2 survivor injured grants the killer 6/7/8% decreased cool-down on successful attacks. Having 3 injured gives the exposed affect to all survivor for and it lasts for 20/25/30 seconds if the survivors all heal while this timer is going down it is disabled, if 1 survivor is still injured the exposed effect will last till the time runs out. Having 4 injured will reveals survivors locations this effect lasts 30 seconds and is disabled if all survivors heal.
---
I think he would either have put them into the broken state and move at 115% speed or he would put them in the exposed state and move at 110% speed at tier 3 bloodlust.
---
For anyone that doesn‚Äôt know each tier of bloodlust gives every killer a 5% speed boost and it would take Hannibal Lector 7.5 seconds to go up each tier so 22.5 seconds to get to tier 3.
---
His add-ons could be gain bloodlust from the obsession faster, attacks cause Haemorrhage, mangled, exhaustion, blindness and deep wound. Survivors he hits gets the broken effect in tier 2 and a purple ass-on for tier 1 . If getting the exposed effect at tier 3 bloodlust was OP then it could become a purple add-on. Finally an crazy OP add on that lowers you movement speed to 90% and each tier of bloodlust takes the normal amount of speed to get(15 seconds to get each tier) you Mori people you catch at tier 3 which means you moving at 105% like tombstone Myers.
---
The perfect Mori would be scalping them and eating there brain or tearing out there throat with his teeth but it would probably be him cutting there throat with a knife. Just look at the animation of the saw traps. 
---
Jodie foster would be a great survivor but she hated doing the movie and I feel like whoever has the right would just use Edward Norton instead from Red Dragon but I can dream so I went with Jodie Foster.
---
I would like to here everyone‚Äôs opinion because I put a lot of effort into this and I‚Äôm genuinely interested on what you have to say. Please judge the killer and the add-ons separately, I don‚Äôt want someone screaming it‚Äôs OPPPPPPP in the comments just because 1 add-on or perk is to strong.
---
I did this because I really like the idea of bloodlust and I think they should capitalise on it by adding a killer with it. 
---
I‚Äôm done no more promise. Plz say what changes you would make to. 
---
Height: tall
---
Lunge: long because it just needs to be 
---
Speed: 110% or 115% unsure.
---
Terror radius: 32 meters 
---
He is stealthy in some movies like Hannibal but I‚Äôm a bit sick of stealthy killers so I decided to not make him stealthy and because I liked the bloodlust idea so much.
---
This is the Antony Hopkins Hannibal Lector.
---
                                      Clarice starling
---
Constantly pushing though hard battle and risking her life FBI.
---
She would were a grey FBI tracksuit that she was wearing while running in the forest.
---
Her perks would be 
---
Closer: while standing in the killers terror radius all survivors on the map are highlighted this effect persists for 6/7/8 seconds after leaving the killers terror radius or starting a chase.
---
6th sense: the killer is highlighted for 5 seconds after damaging a generator and the generators aura is revealed for 8/10/12 seconds.
---
Butterfly effect: failing a skill check will have a 12/14/16 second delay and will not cause any pause of progress this also applies to the pause for hitting a good on a generator with hex ruin.(this does not change the amount the generator is set back by just the pause).
---
(There could also be some backstory about the lambs)
---
The map is a very difficult one to pick the options are a bungalow with a well, house in a big garden, a map like strode‚Äôs, a insane asylum, a airplane hangar, a pig farm or what I think is the best two are a 2 tiered cathedral with a unique basement that is actually an attic with a generator a bit like a tower or a building that he brakes out of in silence of the lambs(it‚Äôs like the prison, hotel, restaurant, asylum thing). There could be a original map that was like, the ambulance went off-road and hit a tree Hannibal was never scene again, maybe it was the mist maybe he is living in 
---
Zihuatanejo, no body knows.
---
The killer would be strong to matter the skill but never crazy but could definitely beat an amazing player after wasting time getting bloodlust 3. He would also make instant heals useless and would slow the game down JUST A LITTLE BIT by stopping people heal. He also gets stronger as the chase progresses.
---
The survivor would be a new type of survivor by distracting the killer without getting in a chase or having to hide as quickly as possible and risk getting caught, or running urban evasion and it has an added bonus.
---
With a new map that could involve a attic basement or a highway or a elevator and I new play style. 
---
Criticise all you want and please do if you have any questions or opinions on anything mentioned.
---
We hold these truths to be evident, that all survivors were created equal and that we will use lethal force to take their right to bear flashlights. God bless Franklin‚Äôs
---
JAKE WILL BE MIIINE
---
Matt from BHVR tweeted about thinking up bird based perks last week. It might have been because calm spirit was on the shrine and he was making a joke about what HybridPanda had said on his shrine watch. So they could be working on a killer that uses the crows on the map in some way. I feel that we need a killer who's power is passive like an ability to follow scent trails or maybe would pick up blood from injured survivors that allow it to build up a power that lets them insta down a survivor.
---
That was exactly how I felt when that happened.
---
Ruh roh Raggy I don‚Äôt think this is just a mystery anymore...
---
Funny that I get that "exceptional performance" when I completely stop some clueless team, or in occasional random farming sessions. When you work hard and put all you got into it, you usually get only safety pip.
---
*laughs in Flip-Flop*
---
Me either, except for what they give you on console.
---
Also BhVR interactive has stated many times now that camping and tunneling is perfectly fine, so if you don‚Äôt like it then take it up with them and also ready up if you don‚Äôt wanna be that guy....
---
At an exit gate*
---
Go get em buster :3
---
When you can tell your partner "hey he is right around the corner dont come unhook or hey he left the hook he is headed straight to your generator. Yea that's not something that should happen like I said if they make it that way survivors  would need to see 1st person . Cuz if a killer is crouched behind you like scream an you all can talk no matter how far away, you dont need to be able to look around  360 degrees of your character.
---
Free pallet break. Most Hillbillys straight up will try to get the pallet broken by swinging so far away it would never hit the survivor, or they don't even attempt to hit you then when the pallet is dropped they use instasaw to down you.
---
It's especially noticable on the Badham Preschool map. The survivor could play all those pallets patiently and if the killer is impatient or too predictable they can easily get outplayed by those pallets against smart survivors. Spirit Fury just eliminates all that and on Hillbilly literally waiting to get stunned then chainsaw.
---
I can appreciate Hillbillys that can curve and play pallets and tiles smartly but Spirit Fury Hillbillys just make me want to move on to the next match as fast as possible.
---
That sounds fun. I like the stealth killers best. Myers is main.

Looking for a group to do SWF. Sitting in a lobby now but won't be on much longer. I'll be back on later tonight around 11pm EST
---
Ma boy Frip Frop! Yea that was just an edit
---
This sort of thing is how I found out Bunna has an animation for getting out of a bear trap
---
"Underpowered" basically read as "loopable".
---
All killer mains are the worst? Really?
---
survivors will scream that you camped no matter what you do
---
A killer to surpass The Bee!
---
so there's a penalty to it I guess
---
it also makes sense. after a burst of adrenaline, you feel exhausted
---
I get that addressing the effects of DCs mid game is not a black and white solution but the fact that survivors depip when the killer DCs 10 seconds into the trial is mind boggling.
---
I love how Scooby Doo that was for two survivors to run by with the killer.
---
That's what Dwight wears, idk what else you want them to do
---
Brung? great grammar.
---
Yeah, i tried playing with swf on the dbd discord but my voice makes people disrespectful for some reason.
---
Also the hooked guy wasn't even in the basement, he was in clear sight and the Claudette next to me saw him camping and still went for it.
---
STOMP
---
It's become 2nd nature now to just leave people slugged if they make  little or no attempt to hide after being unhooked. At first it was only the people who would literally run at me like a failed Dead Hard play.
---
But eventually you get a game where you ask yourself "Surely, all 4 of them don't have DS". And you're wrong.
---
No.
---
The log, this killer stands next to a loop to create a space that looks like you can walk through, but this is just an illusion and this killer stops you dead in your tracks
---
It's a strange build but it got a nice add with the ghostface perk to have 0 tr at all times
---
Spirit Fury is pretty much the pallet version of bamboozle.
---
It amuses me to see so many so called "good" billy's that are known in the community that pride themselves on not using bamboozle but then they use sf
---
&gt; Yeah, i tried playing with swf on the dbd discord but my voice makes people disrespectful for some reason. 
---
Huh? I played there a lot and didn't find many people to be disrespectful. What's wrong with your voice?
---
Sadly doctor has a plague doctor skin :(
---
I wish the HillBillies I play against would use the speed limiter!
---
Sounds like he had a rough early game and had to camp/tunnel at end game to secure a kill.
---
I think the second and third perks are actually pretty good concepts
---
It said anonymous, that really sucks if people want to let them know
---
They're actually called 'rank diamonds' :)
---
He's middle tier. Definetly worth playing and spending bloodpoints on
---
Wonderful post. Sick of this as well.
---
Worst hive mind on the internet, honestly, which is saying a lot because Reddit can be an absolute cess pool of circle jerking.
---
Since the exit gates were powered, he was smart to camp &amp; tunnel you down. Maybe you should have ‚Äúbrung‚Äù Decisive Strike.
---
Which is why they are changing it to make DCs more punishing and that survivors will get a "quitter bonus" much like the killer does when someone DCs... There's no way you can avoid the killer having an advantage in a 3v1 5 gens match unfortunately outside of the killer playing nicer.
---
I know how it is now, read what I said; BHVR is already making steps towards DCs being punished and others being compensated for the ragequit.
---
Ah that's interesting. You really know your points haha. I'm still fairly new so not sure what optimal gameplay is for max bloodpoints or points for pips. Thanks!
---
&gt; Anyway I don't see the issue in tunnelling a survivor
---
Like.. if you want to tunnel then fine, you're allowed to do that, but to say that you don't even see the issue in it? The issue is obvious, its not fun. 
---
The reason all these "second chance perks" exist is to help survivors actually enjoy the game. 
---
DS is almost a must have when playing solo especially during rank reset when you're playing against killers who heavily rely on tunneling or get survivors who unhook you in front of the killer. 
---
BT is the only perk that gives you a real shot at saving someone who is being hard camped. 
---
Unbreakable is rarely worth using in my experience as its fairly uncommon to get slugged (though it can be super clutch when it happens).
---
MoM is worthless now so idk why you're even mentioning it.
---
When i'm playing killer its very rare that I get screwed over by any of these perks. That's because my play style counters every one of them by simply not camping, not tunneling, and not slugging.
---
"That was weird... I'll just let you lie there and think about what you've just done".

Stop spamming this everywhere. You made a post which is fine, but dont spam it in every comment section.

Top 10 moments taken before disaster
---
good things it‚Äôs tagged as Salt/Rant..
---
Then you have the killer‚Äôs surprise factor ruined by SWF simply asking ‚Äúhey are you running up to my gen?‚Äù That‚Äôs the ultimate problem, even if you could disguise the killer and hide them, that immersion is lost on asking the most simple of questions or players would simply avoid each other for anything beyond hooks and post hook heals until a different killer became confirmed. 
---
SWF by means of simple voice communication breaks this killer concept.
---
As a result of lack of funding that Democrates refuse to vote in favor of?
---
Ruin on Spirit lmao
---
Balanced landing

Rip the moment I left home for a few days there's a sale. At least its long enough for me to take advantage of when I get home

Nice you even reposted with the same title almost.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
i bought him, got him to lvl 11 and then it dropped in the shrine.   i was soooo happy.   bought it and started dumping bp into the hag for ruin &amp; devour.   i got very lucky with that timing.  
---
now i'm working on clown for pop
---
That mechanic may be annoying for those who hide all match and can loop the killer
---
No one said bad, just that Killers have more of them while survivors have very few.  The whole point of this meme is that many players think it's totally unfair for one side to have an instant heal, whilst they see no problem in having more than triple the amount of sources of instant downs.  It's hypocritical.
---
I'd argue he's far more consistent then myers. Slap on double power recovery add-ons, you have the stealthiest killer, who can with solid routing insta mark a survivor, or gen grab, or win a chase with power at almost any loop.
---
Then it's not recognizably Dwight.
---
At high ranks, all it takes is 1 chase where you have to break 6-7 pallets in a row and you lose. The gens are done, because no matter how good you are at getting those pallets broken, it takes time to do so. 
---
Even if you start the match chasing a potato that drops every pallet in the trial, and you literally have 0 pallets left, it takes too much time. There is no reason the believe that "all the pallets are gone" is a good thing. It means you got ran all match and its over.
---
BBQ is great, promotes anti tunneling and actual application of map pressure, while every average to bad killer runs ruin because they fail at map pressure then complain when they get rolled by good survivors that know how to play against killers that suck at pressuring them
---
Its already survivor sided but with balance landing its borderline broken
---
He's worse than most if not all the killers below him in that case.
---
He has 0 map pressure, and his power takes way too long (without double reload add-ons) to make him a fast chaser. Obviously, he forces pallets early but at rank 1 survivors are relatively confident in their looping to make average chases last too long to be rated highly IMO.
---
It really doesn't matter because rank 1s just DC until they're rank 20. Now the game thinks they're actually rank 20 and pairs them up with actual new people.
---
On top of that, rank 1s also usually just make another Steam/PS4/Xbox account and just host their SWF as a literally brand new survivor with their actual rank 1 friends.
---
Bullies will always find and abuse methods to be bullies. Dedicated servers will help with lag, but not smurfs.
---
Absolutely agreed!
---
at high ranks, you should know not to chase a survivor the whole game
---
It's sorta of a squeaker voice. But only some of them found it annoying, some don't comment on it and one of them outright told me that iam not playing with them lol.
---
The others were either bad or unfunny and try to be funny.
---
I don't have a problem if you are just normally bad but one of them went to look for the ruin totem while one of us got chased for litterly 300 secs, and refused to work on gens.
---
Some of them are streamers and say unfunny stuff like "please don't kill me mr. Myers" and are toxic and teabag the killer, and when asked why they say they deserve it.
---
Overall my experience is mixed with it. Some of them were pretty cool.
---
Damn so many downvotes in an opinion thread. People on this subreddit really don't know how to use them lol
---
Poor clown never seems to get the respect he deserves :(
---
You mean the Democrats that constantly support funding.
---
Also, no, jackass, the money is going to concentration camps and not helping asylees in any way at all.
---
28 stab wounds
---
Instant heals are counterable--grab the survivor instead of hitting them.
---
If you're implying that it is incredibly easy to go search and break all 5 totems as a counter to NoED then isn't it equally as easy to force a survivor through a window or over a pallet so you can grab them?
---
I'm not sure if you really understand the purpouse of ruin, but again, to clarify who in the bloody hell asked you about your opinion on ruin? Have a good day lad
---
*golf clap*
---
Nothing borderline about it.
---
Yeah that's true, meep meep
---
Entity says trans rights
---
Garbage teammates= hating killer mains? Solid logic
---
I play Wraith at higher ranks and cannot for the life of me find Ruin in the bloodwebs. MYC and PWYF are staples in my opinion. Brutal and Pop are a good pairing as well. 
---
Nothing wrong with falling back on NOED either.
---
Gen grab? Really? That won't work at all against decent survivors, he may have zero TR but he is still very easy to hear
---
Myers power can't be taken from him, and his snowballing potential is very large, especially with plague's perk
---
Instant heals can be countered--grab the survivor instead of hitting them.
---
I just find the map so boring, I main survivors but I'd do anything not to play on this map. Although I feel like my last games on it were not the worst actually
---
One of my favorite moments playing DBD involved destroying Hag traps with a flashlight.
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/bic/video/67755956
---
Pretty old clip and super laggy game but it was hilarious.  I also enjoyed my injured friend just standing up in the harvester thing watching it all unfold.
---
Gonna be honest I was kind of toxic by sandbagging Myers but only 1 person died because he raged quit
---
I average one-two gen grabs per game with Ghostface, and I don't disagree that you can hear him, but I'm playing at Rank 1 vs red rank survivors, so Idk the possibility is there if I'm doing it.
---
As much as I agree I do got to ask what could they do to make it even with all the survivor and killer perks and all the killers powers and future new killers powers I don‚Äôt see how they could make it balanced for both sides equally
---
I think the title of rank 1 Killer tier list actually makes this tier list less valuable. 
---
How is Bubba better than four other killers? Why is Ghostface better than Myers?
---
Bruh...

"oh for god's sake, I'm not Miss Piggy!" - The Pig, probably.

And yes in the bottom left corner that is a figet spinner and figet cube which I got 4 years ago lol
---
So the killer managed to catch you. Your teammates tried saving you. And somehow everyone is trash except you? Grow a pair
---
Alt/Tab over to Tetris or Zuma. Lol
---
That's good list. Main part i'm not sure i agree with is your D tier. I believe Legion &gt; Trapper &gt; LF.
---
I want Legion to just constantly play a loop of ‚ÄúGo crazy abalblblbl, Go Stupid alalalaaahahababl‚Äù while using their power. I‚Äôd instantly buy all their cosmetics.
---
Well, at least I don't regret my username‚Ä¶ right?  I don't, do I?
---
I just got a 2 pip at rank 1 with the pig and a purple rank Ace DC‚Äôd on his death hook. Win win.
---
Mikie Myers.
---
One thing is it depends on if you consider "pipping" a win, or 4K a win. Legion is decent at pipping up, definitely better than LF. But you could argue LF is better at getting a 4K. And for trapper he is very addon dependant. He is much better than other 2 with the right addons imo.
---
I do that motion back to back 20 times in a row, so they know I'm reallllly thankful.
---
Same! 3 Dwights huh *winks*
---
Yeah maybe some weirdos do but 99% of people don't call them by their in game name.
---
I would really, really love to play against the people you are playing against, who gets gen grabbed by ghostface lol
---
Yeah, I'm 100% in the 4K = Win for the killer. My ultimate goal is to stop survivors from escaping via the exit gates.
---
The Hill
---
Reposttt
---
Get to rank 1 then ;)
---
 In a 4v1 where one side is naturally stronger they are supposed to balance out to be the same strength, and that is done pretty well, in my experience.
---
&gt; one of them went to look for the ruin totem while one of us got chased for litterly 300 secs, and refused to work on gens.
---
Tbh if someone is hitting less than 50% great skill checks i think its not a terrible idea to look for ruins instead of wasting time getting no progress.
---
I would change LF to F tier, Huntress to A Tier, Pig to D tier and Trapper to C tier.
---
Best cosplays so far
---
It's the games subreddit, you're kind of meant to share your opinion on here. And the point of Ruin is to slow game, so it takes more time for survs to do gens, meaning the killer doesn't have to doesn't have to be good in chase, or have to efficiently gen patrol. If you weren't a fuckwit u would know this.
---
You even got the right map
---
"tueur nul hackeur" = killer bad hacker. Hackeur is basically hacker with the french pronounciation.
---
As a french, I'm embarrassed of people like that.
---
Eww, Snapchat?
---
Literally never
---
I have a hard time against Hag. The change up in playstyle throws me off.
---
Though I have started playing killer lately and I have been having a pretty good time with her. Her add-ons can drastically change how to play the game.
---
Don‚Äôt have PS4
---
I feel like you care about graphics to much. They aren't that important
---
Do low quality. Its better.
---
The myth
---
I was hitting only good skill checks and was able to finish a gen. Problem was..he didn't even find it.
---
Ace in the hole I think
---
Is that u/withaknife ?
---
Already am. However I'm not getting the same deaf potatoes who gets gen grabbed by ghostface lmao
---
Because Amanda isn't the main character of the Saw franchise, while Michael and Freddy are.
---
If it was John Cramer as the Saw Killer, I guarantee you everyone would call him "John" rather than Pig. It's just that they didn't think a cancerous old man who never canonically lost would make for a very interesting character, so they used one of his (many, many) apprentices instead.
---
Think that‚Äôs the one
---
Guess you're playing ghost face wrong :shrug:
---
Only when you stop sandbagging tour teammates
---
How does one do this lmao
---
Yeah idk... Aparentlly a 4k on a Low Tier killer makes me a noob too?
---
Weird troll team.
---
‚ÄúHello, Kermit, I want to play a game‚Äù
---
That was very rude to people that just call killers a different name
---
if i cared about graphics too much i wouldnt be playing dead by daylight.  The problem is, it used to be detailed and now it looks like im trying to play it with my eyes open underwater.  I dont expect brand new graphics, but they arent even as "good" as they were last time i got on to play.  The ps4 looks better than the default ultra settings do on my pc.  So whatever is wrong, i am just trying to fix.
---
If it ain't Dwight, it ain't right!
---
Mom come pick me up I'm scared
---
Some of them are cool, and if they use the more interesting looking masks it's usually really cool, but more than half of them are just big circle eyes and a mouth on the back of a styrofoam/paper plate.
---
And I main him he‚Äôs a hard killer to master but a beast when you finally do my build currently is haunted, ruin, pop, and brutal but sometimes I like to put on stbfl.
---
I support this 100%.
---
Dwight = Fred, Meg = Daphne, Jake = Shaggy, Claudette = Velma?
---
I get your point but your examples are bad. Both of these will get crushed by a good red rank SWF team.
---
instead, think of corn maps with Billy hehe
---
Completely agree, I mean there are times in your professional life when you actually do have to put your hobbies on hold but it should never have to be for more than a few weeks
---
basicly
---
&gt;  Decisive,Dead Hard,Borrowed Time,Adrenaline.
---
So this tier list is made according to rank 1 survivors, so you made it thinking survivors make very few mistakes I believe. But at the same time, you put LF here because of the chainsaw, when realistically he will almost never use it against good survivors. Any failed attempt on LF's part to try and chainsaw result in a huge drawback, the slowdown is usually enough for the survivor to make another loop easily.
---
Clown can't really be punished for his mistakes (maybe missing the bottle), and his gameplay is pretty basic, drop a bottle, force the loop to end earlier and that's it. So in my opinion, Clown is a way safer bet than LF who will only use his chainsaw 1 or 2 times a game.
---
Can't even argue against me, that's how you know you are a ascended
---
Same as always. Dead Hard/Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, Borrowed time and Decisive strike.
---
If you play killer, anything you do will make you a noob.
---
ghost face in the movies is just a persona that killers use as its a different killer everytime. the 1st, 2nd, and 4th movies had 2 killers and 3 had 1, but the ghost face in dbd isn't from the movies. it's like an original character that uses the ghost face persona, which is why he doesn't come with a stage or survivor.
---
My point is that if for any reasons let's say you are working 2 jobs and you have kids to take care of and you have 0 free time, you are the one with "no life", not the people who are enjoying their lives lol
---
Ah Ok, yea I'm not sure, as a kid when I saw it we all just called him Scream
---
the killer shadows are weird, especially michaels he has a broken hand
---
Oh so nothing really changed. What about killers.
---
BBQ,Ruin were good back then.
---
Alright I don't know what's your point but first you said that people who use it don't have any map pressure now you're saying people who are bad in chases use it
---
I also just switched to PC. I do ultra because I didn‚Äôt know low was better. Is there any downsides to running low?
---
Hey and that's a fair argument, and I reckon most people could make a decent argument for why any killer in D/E tier should be higher or lower.
---
I do know that I get a decent amount of chainsaw downs with LF at rank 1, enduring/spiritfury, disrespect every pallet, catch survivors in dead zones it's possible!
---
Ah Ok, that makes sense. Thanks for the info, I only saw the first one a looong time ago
---
No there is not, actually if you play killer its an advantage as you get more vision.
---
Some survivors are just plain stupid.
---
is borrowed time really meta tho? One member of the SWF having it on is good, but not the whole team imo.
---
My last name btw
---
You struggled to get out of yellow ranks lmao, why are you even stating ur opinion when u are so fucking boosted
---
Yeah but on the Jigsaw side of things, she's still like Jigsaw's right hand person isn't she,
---
yes BBQ Ruins is still very very meta. People not running ruins are mostly purposely handicapping themselves for fun.
---
This reminds me of a game I had recently. 
---
    
---
Down to the last 3 gens, 2 of which were right next to each other. Caught a Dwight on one of them, downed and hooked him in-between the 2 gens. This bright colored Nea is trying to get me to follow her, making it obvious she wants me to chase.
---
     
---
What ended up happening was that another survivor was in the corner trying to sneak off the unhook, so I had 3 survivors and 2 of the last 3 gens right infront of me. I pretended to chase the Nea, the other survivor went for the unhook, got downed instead, the Nea ran a full circle around the loop right back into me, got downed. And the last survivor who finished 2 of the last 3 gens while this shitshow was happening took the hatch out.
---
I was abused post game for "camping". Sorry, I saw you and wasn't gonna let 3 of u play me like that. The smart one got away.
---
Damn i wish this was real lol
---
‚ÄûwHeN yOu'Re So FuCkInG bOoStEd‚Äù meanwhile i play this game for over a year
---
Good point.
---
Change screams image to ‚ÄúThe Mask‚Äù with Jim Carrey
---
JUST DO IT
---
How was self care nerfed? Longer timer? Still a god send for solo.
---
They came to my steam profile writing "inbred baby killer again -_-..." as if they're getting anywhere telling all my friends I'm a "hacker"
---
‚ÄúMEDIOCRE!‚Äù
---
Kermit come here i'm going to kill you
---
You're a damn good artist, great drawing!
---
Imma do it now...
---
It's more annoying because hitboxes can be questionable and being able to be one shot at at range is incredibly strong. Huntress streamers say that irri head should only one shot beyond a certain range.
---
I can taste the toxicity
---
Shiiii i forgot about that :((
---
Did someone post it before me? Link?
---
Many people
---
BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel, Enduring + Spirit Fury combo, Whispers, Noed
---
A mori is like if the survivors had an item that let them escape through a hole in the ground after only completing half the work. Oh wait.
---
Because even if you haven't watched any of the movies, you know who Freddie and Michael are. I know that the pig is a part of Saw but I couldn't tell you who it was. She's not as iconic as the others.
---
I agree, really depends on what you base the survivors' skill and it's something that changes every game so it's always pretty hard to judge. I don't think LF is as bad as people think, but I just think Clown is better than that.
---
Honestly I'm a killer main and I never camp so any survivor I face doesn't get any use out of it. With SWF I get beat up more by Deliverance because they can 3 man gens while they unhook themselves. Save a ton of time and wastes mine but it doesn't work well with solos because survivors will waste time going for saves they don't need to.
---
When was it nerfed?
---
Lad, you're just wasting my time, I already said have a nice day, so please have and bugger off, I never asked your opinion on ruin, if you can't read, that's not really my problem, I won't let such a moron waste my time, if you'd at least shared your opinion in a somewhat polite way, well see ya mate
---
Thanks for letting me know! I‚Äôm pretty new, but I won‚Äôt make that mistake again now.
---
Oh wow I've never seen this post before. Next thing you'll tell me is that Nea is secretly the Entity!
---
I hate that :( it's like how do they know I'm inbred. Can they tell by the way my killer moves? :/ ^btw^im^joking
---
Yep! this is my sfw reddit account!
---
What do you do next? Run or bow?
---
Thank you!!
---
Not really. He just offered her a chance but didnt trust her, in fact he knew she was going to fail and betray him. Mark Hoffman ended up being a much more capable "sidekick".
---
With sounds from the show!
---
I would if I had friends like that too, I can barely get my friends to play Dbd when it was free on ps4 -___-
---
I bowed up to the point he tried to sacrifice me.
---
Its literally says I know this isn't a bug
---
Mate I understand, pussying off the second you start to lose and argument, but then again I can't expect much from someone that wants to run Ruin on a killer than has exceptional map pressure, cya around mate
---
All offerings need to be reworked...
---
Switch to no skillcheck doc with ebony mori. That'll teach em
---
Do you know how cosplay works? FFS man.
---
Lmaooo deadass
---
Sounds like a survivor to me.
---
&gt;frankly even Spirit has this problem to some degree since she can't just teleport around strong loops - it lets her mindgame them a bit more than most, but generators still go faster than she does. 
---
No offense but if you can't catch Survivors without Iron Will at a loop as spirit with your power off cooldown you're a bad spirit.
---
Thx! It worked
---
The Friday the 13th ones weren't too bad. Some of them were kind of terrible but for the most part they were good. I agree with the other examples though. Chucky getting a wife and a kid  is what pushed me away from it.
---
Yeah , the game looks very blurry on any other setting than low because the game uses FXAA.
---
I said have a good day in my 3rd comment, you're hilarious üòÇüòÇ
---
PFFFFFFFFFFTTTTT LMAO
---
It‚Äôs probably in the way you lunge with your hip movements.
---
There was an attempt
---
The L
---
shame the actual prices of cells remain the same so you're going to have not enough left overs
---
Try restarting your game
---
No survivor left behind :)
---
lightweight wants a word
---
It really doesn't have changed since the old days. Adrenaline, BL/SB/DH, SC, DS
---
And this is exactly why I just switch to killer or play another game if none of my friends are online. I used to only play Solo survivor back when i didn't have any friends playing DBD, never again.
---
Okay but to be fair this friend probably won't play much either since they bearly play with me anyways but it's fine maybe they're busy who knows
---
I'm a survivor main, and when I play killer I play as Legion because they give me "Sunny Family Cult" vibes, and nearly every game I get a message saying "Legion is the most broken killer" or "You only play Legion becuase they're OP"
---
And sometimes I get 2/3 DCs. Legion is Mid-Tier at best.
---
Why are you getting downvoted? Do survivors want leatherface to be bullied forever?
---
Scary Terry would be hilarious . Especially if it was extremely cartoony and if he said bitch every time he did anything
---
I see people are running lightweight again. Is it really that good?
---
Unlucky man. Part of being a good survivor is adjusting your playstyle to the killer you‚Äôre playing.
---
He...is a good boy. Must be in some kind of trouble...
---
*cut to killer chasing that specific player.*
---
This is why you're supposed to make your username **post** fap.
---
I'm kind of interested on how their going to implement the bugs ü§ì
---
logically wouldn‚Äôt that make dr Gordon the best choice, as he‚Äôs the only one canonically that didn‚Äôt betray jigsaws plans? I mean, mark killed jigsaws wife when she was supposed to kill him.
---
SB isnt meta
---
Not actually true. Some trash talking is allowed.
---
Sodium is salt I think
---
NSFW aside, I love your style. Keep up the good work. Look foward to seeing more on this account!
---
Perfection, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm looking at a screenshot of the game
---
I do agree actually that swift hunt should be baseline, but yellow over green as I think that‚Äôs good enough without making new swift hunt OP or obsolete, I guess that‚Äôs where my head was when I said that.
---
And no I do NOT at all trust BHVR to come up with a new chase mechanic/jungle gym. For a while I‚Äôve had ideas, but I can‚Äôt find ways to include them in game without messing with the order. That‚Äôs why instead of tweaks I said overhaul, tbh it‚Äôs time for a big change.
---
Also I‚Äôm very happy you agree with me on the last part. But plz Legion last I don‚Äôt want anymore people playing that uninteractive character.
---
We should actually be hopeful since it's an entirely new team but idk we can't judge it yet if it's not even out
---
I agree with that nothing is as painful as drift king billy on rotten fields.

I'd love that but as long as the copy right holder still holds it I don't think anyone will want to go into business with him. Its sad because it would be a fun killer. Maybe go into the body part replacement from the movies and have him have different weapons based on what limbs he had. Create a mechanic of having to go to certain locations to switch body parts to do different things. Another idea i had for him a long time ago was a jump stun power where he could soar into the air and land in another area causing all survivors in the area to be stunned for a certain amount of time.
---
I didn't know it was a different team! Now I am actually interested... Do you know what team is working on it?
---
Don‚Äôt worry, reports do literally nothing.
---
No, it's just another fuck you to players who prefer hiding over looping. Legion, Doctor, BBQ and Infectious Fright are other examples for this.
---
When I started to play this game my playstyle was more like hide and seek as well (Claudette with Urban Evasion). But the more you play the more you realize this is somehow not the intended way to play this game. So you start to pick Adrenaline and Exhaustion perks and instead run the Killer around tiles for eternity. And the cycle continues.
---
Pop is one of the best perks in the game right now, however, so is discordance. I‚Äôd personally say POP because it‚Äôs actually amazing how much that 25% regression matters.

When you're healing or getting healed your hitbox actually gets bigger so it's a good idea not to heal in the huntresses radius
---
it looks like photoshoped, because its impossible to get 32k while u died, and its impossible to get a 32k while 2 people escaped
---
doesn't matter devs won't do shit. They explained before on stream they use judgement for these kind of reports. If you say "Haha i got you", that's fine. If you say "i hope you die from torture", that is not.
---
Thanks for your opinion lad

Why are you getting downvoted
---
Glad someone gets it, given up on making genuine threads about anything, I just feel like trolling this community, they have the short fuse of a 5 year old dropping their ice cream xD
---
First ones just unnerving presence mixed with distressing but the rest are cool
---
Classic.
---
the killer let me farm with him at the end of a game, then closed hatch in my face and teabagged me and the dude was like REPORTED FOR WORKING WITH KILLER TRASH im like !? have you never been farmed with !!?
---
Prepare for the survivor salt. "I didn't adapt at all to the Hag and got killed. I'm mad at you."
---
I guess they are very bad survivor or weekend swf players. Ghostface is loud AF when he's near and it's a very distinctive sound. In an average game in rank 1 with swf woth perfect coordination and game sense, GF isn't at his best shape. He will be destroyed by low pressure and no chase potential like nurse or huntress.
---
Thank you.
---
Oh man I play on PS4, I had no idea of players had to buy hag.
---
That's what you get tea bagger
---
Also how common is this?
---
Terror radius stomp boots.
---
You said it lmao. If I look in a hooked survivors direction from literally two areas away "fucking camper. Go chase someone else. Baby killer ". Or if I bump into a silly Claudette that came off hook and decided to self heal literally two feet away from the hook behind a rock "fucking tunneling POS. Kys". God forbid I'm nice and let someone escape "ggez. Trash killer."
---
remember when 9gag was good eons ago
---
Finally in not being yelled at for my choices

I'm glad Killer Mains don't see Survivor Mains like thatü•∫
---
Jesus...You are a litteral genius sir.
---
Just d/c and make them waste the offering. Nobody is using that offering unless they intend to abuse the shit out of the map.
---
I had a game where 2 people rage quitted and the other 2 died on first hook in the first 5 minutes of the match... And I still got a pip. That win felt dirty as fuck.
---
wait why? it doesnt give you any sort of advantage
---
Instant karma :D
---
HybridPanda said on his shrine watch that he had info on the new killer but couldn't talk about it yet.
---
*Sad bear trap noises‚Äù
---
That usually happens when a survivor rescues a teammate before I even leave and call me a camper and they also accused me of cheating because their borrowed Time didn't work this happens when I play out Wraith and Ghostface since they couter that perk
---
I agree - there needs to be a time limit as to how long the sombreros stay on, or a way for the survivors to remove them
---
Besides it being a faked win screen because you can't reach 32 thousand points as killer with even a single escape, your math is wrong on how many blood points you would have earned for the match if it had actually happened.
---
They need to make DS deactivate if the killer can hook someone else, because I can let them go, hook 2 other people, and still get hit with DS for "Tunneling".
---
It can still be used as a bully mechanic, because the killer is going to go for that locker grab instead of waiting to get hit with head on, or hit the person that body blocked someone else.
---
With DS, you can take 2 body blocks and go down, with no worry, so long as you were just saved.
---
I mean, he had a reason to lol, that probably was not the most fun game he‚Äôs had lmao
---
Ghostface in the game is a man named Danny Johnson.
---
Probably emojis idk. I get downvoted for shitposting sometimes because people take this website too seriously lol
---
It‚Äôs really useful for finding that last survivor crouching around somewhere
---
I'll be there! LightSkinWasp
---
Sometimes it says you lose a chase, when you actually don't. That can be abused for tokens.
---
Ah Ok, I'm getting it now, I think:P
---
"Blood on your face" In a public match, kill 4 survivors in a single game.
---
I guess, it is to mori all 4 players in one match :)
---
But they said yes homo already...
---
I say Springtrap from fnaf there are a few concepts done by other people here on the sub Reddit I'll look for a link to them
---
Oh my god I didn‚Äôt realize how much I needed this!
---
That's rich, I guess TOTH, hag, spirit do not exist. Hey everyone if you see a Survivor doing totems make sure you don't protect your totems, just let them do it as they are wasting time.
---
They don't have one objective, there is multiple. That's why you can double pip without even escaping. Can killers double pip without killing? No they can't. You feign ignorance for the sake of your argument. At the end of the day, the goal is to pip, double pip and gain BP. That's it. Some argue rank is meaningless, so just gaining BP is the real goal.
---
You call NOED entitled but nothing is more entitled than saying you're entitled to ignore totems, clear them if you want and the killer is not supposed to protect them. If you're praying for survivors to not clear totems then you're garbage, you need to protect and apply pressure. If you're Gen rushing without securing your win, your garbage too. If the killer is mysteriously not running ruin, then I would instantly assume noed or blood warden but I guess strategy is too much for you. This isn't even just a "me" thing, red/purple ranks if you aren't protecting bones they are going to get cleared.

Yeah literally nothing changed because BHVR hasn't released a single good survivor-perk in 2 years, except the one they made pay2win and nerfed 2 months later, LOL pay2winplayers getting shafted is always a good thing.
---
I'm still waiting for pharmacy to replace my self-care with, but that's also a "pay2medkit"-perk so for "ToTaLly RaNdOm" reasons it obviously hasn't showed up in the shrine except for once when I wasn't playing, probably during the old legion-era.

I will definitely make more!

That's kind of expensive to go for too, since you need an ebony.  Hopefully itll get easier with dedicateds.

Lmao that‚Äôs amazing
---
He's not so good. At least in rank 1. He has no ability to help him in chases and no map pressure. His only good asset is stealth and detection. So you gotta learn all killers weaknesses and play by that. GF is loopable, very easy. Nurse isn't loopable, hide. That's it. The killer decides how you play, not you. So if a killer has no chase potential just loop and make them lose time.
---
First time it happened to me so i guess not that often
---
Sounds like a classic group of brain dead sjw

Hopefully they never infect dbd

---
Yeah keep saying that as all 3 of you non self-care trashplayers get downed while I'm on my first hook, so sick of noobs who meme this "selfcare bad, me useless good" at least bring a medkit if you're doing this shit.
---
i love the map as a survivor. i hate the map as a killer.

More like "When a Claudette joins the lobby"

Unless you burnt the item before the DC

Have an attention to detail and not wear any basic button up
---
Oh, I was thinking that the blindness effect only lasted while they were on the hook and not after
---
Why would he bring you next to the hatch hook. Rookie mistakes
---
I'm not changing the perk, just the description. This is literally how it works in-game.
---
That feeling when the last two survivors are two claudettes and you KNOW they are going full immersion now and its going to be two hours before you find one and down them.
---
10/10 game
---
Oh, thanks for clarifying.
---
X-files episode Brand-X begs to differ. Bonus! the episodes antagonist was the guy who started the Saw Games, bathroom floor brain splatter, Tobin Bell.
---
Same happened to me but I had deliverance and ds
---
As a killer I've seen it work a bunch, as far as borrowed time, I never camp so I can't even remember the last time I saw a bleed out timer. Just sharing some of my experiences facing SWF groups. I never said it was good, just saying I get beat up more by it as a killer. You need to read a little better and not assume :P and I ain't your buddy, guy.
---
Yea like Ruins and BBQ
---
Creative crossover. Now we need a venom killer. The power could be to stick to buildings and tree etc. Imagine a vemon just dropping on you from no where
---
yea, she forces survivors to play defensively which practically no other killer besides possibly nurse forces (hell not even her weaker counterpart trapper forces it), which is why she has such great map pressure without having to actually interact with survivors.
---
I got "Play a real killer" and "Sweaty killer" a lot. Thought it was cute, coming from a rank 15 who was swf with a 5 and 2.
---
Late game hooks and sacrifices get you more BP. We waited untill after they opened the gates to hook everyone twice and get 2 sacrifices, late game hooks are worth an extra 700 BP per, so 700 times 10 plus 2 sacrifices plus summon entity is way more then 8000
---
Hi there, here is the link to where they announced the cosmetic contest winner: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/76245/third-anniversary-contest-winners/p1
---
May sound silly but i often actually do that (in a not so obvious way). It helps my totem survive at least 2 minutes most games.
---
Welcome to the entity  ^bitch
---
It's a flavor text thingy. You go to the main page, hit the three dots button at the top right and hit change user flair
---
I don‚Äôt play a ton of doctor but enough to make that dope cosmetic worth it!
---
And?  That's only two of four perks, you could then put in spirit fury and enduring for a loop stopper who disrespects pallets or overcharge and pop goes the weasel for strong gen defense.
---
The problem about Lithe is that is super situational, usually you end up using it in a garbage place where you don't actually want to use it(like jungle gym).
---
Yep-
---
I haven't seen this before, sorry. Can you link me then?
---
Late game hooks and sacrifices are worth more. Just gotta wait till the gates are open
---
The hatch must have glitched to generate early and another survivor found a key in a box. You get 5000 for escaping so only two of them did anything of value like gens,
---
Same! Meme is on point with info and facial expressions.
---
I play Billy, Hag, Freddy, and Wraith and that's literally it
---
Yeah, I call them "Daddy" and "Sharp Hand Joe", some people just can't get it right, god! :V
---
He actually doesn't, there's one animation for freeing yourself from the trap as killer and it's just applied to the model of the killer that stepped into it. 
---
It just looks okay on Bubba because his build is similar to the trapper, a tall human male.
---
If you step into a bear trap as Hag it stretches her model to match the bone locations of the Trapper and it looks absolutely mortifying.
---
Bro same i cant play at all it just crashes
---
Have you watched Otz‚Äôs video where he used Michael and furtive chase? Shit was crazy
---
We Stan the bing bong boi
---
Finally, A good cosplay of legion
---
The in game ghost face character is unrelated to the movies though... It's just the mask that they have licensed lol.
---
He's fun to play against Rank 15's
---
Okay so how did they all achieve maximum points?  I've never seen a survivor get a perfect game, ever.  Even with farming.
---
I am going to be honest the mariachi music getting faster and faster actually is scary.
---
Calling us killer main the worst shows how salty a survivor can be. I can get that sometimes you get facecamping bubba or a tunneler piggy but try to understand that the team you have also have an impact. You said that your teammate literalky used all the pallets right? And they tried to save without BT and the didn' open the gates. Now all you did was to call the killer trash but you didn't realize that if your fellow team used all the pallets against a speed limiter billy then it's none but their fault. Or maybe not. But you called that killer trash so he must be not so good at controlling his chainsaw. So now, how did he ruined the game? When it's endgame, we all killer mains prefer to get at least one kill instead of getting none, and we don't know if the gates are 99% or not. The other thing is that he used speed limiter as an excuse. And so? Why would you cry on this? Get better because part of the billy strenght is on the one shot potential (second to the map pressure).
---
His terror radius is just Markiplier saying EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Check their status, they're healthy. They don't have the escape symbol, nor the death symbol. The game ended as soon as i started chainsawing a Bill.
---
I just want a Joey cosplay with effort to pop up, now that would be cool
---
And it's not like this was a fast game this took like 25 minutes.

i mean body blocking on the run. But yea its always valid. A good wraith can do it literally anywhere

You must be rank 20 killer. In actual rank 1 there are swf perfectly organized who genrush like crazy. Without ruin you're lucky to get at least 5 minutes of game. Apparently you don't play on higher ranks as ruin is a must for m1 killers. The only ones who doesn't need ruin are nurse, billy and spirit. I bet you're saying this to avoid ruin.

what pallet bug
---
This is the best use of it I have ever seen.
---
Yeah, those were the days‚Ä¶
---
It's a map add on called glass bead. It allows the user to mark anything with it by pressing the map button and action button. I use it all the time to mark objectives for the team. For example, marking where a hex might be, a gen that's almost completed, marking an exit gate when all the gens are powered, etc.
---
do i have to do that on pc?
---
It‚Äôs a valid perk tho
---
I have dc‚Äôd but only on super tunnelers. I cant deal with those. THERE ARE 3 OTHER SURVIVORS!
---
He gets gen rushed and I die. All three other people escape. Its as if he doesnt want to be the only one to depip.
---
Many killers do that but big brain killers can predict where survivors have spawned and start chases that way
---
A bug where you could get stuck inside a pallet when stunned, making it literally impossible to get out.
---
I don't think I you can use any items ad long as you are in the dying state
---
Ay I'm right here dude. Glad people are having a good ol time looking at my flair

Toxicity has always been around. If anything it‚Äôs only going to get worse. It‚Äôs disappointing and a shame, but that‚Äôs what happens when you combine faulty mechanics, asymmetry, and douchebags.

Nightmare is a fuckin joke m8
---
And he will continue to play that way as long as survivors reward him for doing it.
---
I can see that yeah. 
---
I'm fine with multiple people getting slugged close to the end as the killer is just under a lot of pressure as the game is close to being over, but if someone is just slugging me for 2 minutes to look for the last guy for the 4K then I'll just go.
---
I often have a medkit, but running self care really makes you too used to being healed up. you really don't need to be healthy all the time

Some of her addons feel pretty overtuned ngl. The haunting power duration ones should prob get knocked down a tad bit. as well as some of the movement speed. Not even gonna talk about prayer beads because that's obvious.

I love shutting down BT by moving away from the hook and being called a cheater. I just say "Read the perk buddy"

You're welcome!

As long as we remove keys as well.
---
Like I want to support cosplayers and its really great but that's the biggest bummer about Legion. Everyone wants to throw on a hoodie and buy a mask from Etsy and be the next stand in for the 9th The Purge movie.
---
So when this happens, are there 2 killers watching the same lobby fill up with survivors?
---
You can't use items in dying state
---
Can't use it if there's no terror radius they didn't read the fine print
---
Prior to the game releasing for free,  console versions were more expensive to make up for this discrepancy.
---
*"Oh Im dying I need someone to touch me so I can get up. My medkit? Idk how use it now"* \- **dbd logic**
---
Nea is nowhere to be found
---
Killer main here: survivors REALLY should be able to use their items in the dying state. Like, c'mon devs.
---
This has been a problem lately, the survivors actually have more than enough time to belt out 5 gens by the time the face camped person dies (180 seconds on hook, gens take 80 without bonuses, assuming they got caught almost immediately (unlikely but for the sake of argument) the survivors could do 3 gens separately (80 seconds) , have 2 work on 1 and the other start the last, once the 2nd to last one is done (~140 seconds) they all hop on the last one (170-180 seconds). The issue comes down to people wasting time and going for saves when they really should just belt out the gens and punish the killer by giving them ~6k bloodpoints at most.
---
Also if you don't play in low you can't see the killer's stain through walls
---
Implying that survivors actually spin their cameras around...
---
Oh no trust me, he was crouching a lot of the time because of the traps and even said ‚Äúcrouchwalking around all match isn‚Äôt fun.‚Äù
---
Yes, you are still the obsession with it.
---
Yes Officer, this man fo culture right here.
---
Lol you don't like people taking your items, but it's totally intended when you steal other people's. Alright.
---
I mean you can play it right now, I have it on my phone
---
You're literally being the definition of inconsiderate lol. Killers are sitting there for twenty minutes sometimes. I'm not impatient cause normally I'm on my phone anyway
---
Holy fuck easy 10/10
---
What part of DYING is not clear?
---
You proved that I was right, but what you don't realize is that I never use ruin. 
---
Look back at my comment history if you want. I always argue how unnecessary ruin is, and how Pop is better. 
---
But, I can actually hit skillchecks. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Played against a Freddy a few minutes ago and this happened in the post game chat. Figured I'd share since this was surprisingly wholesome considering how the majority of post game chats go.
---
Freddy, I already told you this in the chat, but good luck on your next games. You deserve it.
---
Only the most entitled of survivors have the balls to complain about an end game camp.  There's no gens to patrol dude.  You are the objective at that point.
---
Stealing? Where did that come from.
---
I dont know whats more anoying, no one coming for you for no reason, or the killer camping you when there are 4 gens left and all survivors just crouch around the place doing nothing and as soon as you end up dying one of them goes down
---
I mean you're being really literal about it.
---
Then we agree.
---
Ty so much!
---
I can't though! I've tried tapp tapp and other sites to download it but it won't work also I don't know how to change my country in Google play
---
As long as it‚Äôs free I don‚Äôt really care but maybe we‚Äôll get to make ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù accounts like how epic and hi-res do it whenever the servers come. That would be badass but tbf I have zero high hopes for dedicated servers and if it fixes anything or makes it better I‚Äôll be happily surprised. Gotta keep expectations low you know? Lol
---
Needs more team perks. Borrowed time. Adrenaline. D strike. Anything that will either extend a chase, waste a killers time, or turn a loss or dead teammate into a surviving one instead is worth it. Fuck spine chill, lightweight is meh. It‚Äôll work on deaf and or blind killers but higher ranks people focus passed the scratches and use their ears.
---
It's bad, i haven't used it ever since the nerf.
---
You can't always reliably hide your stain. Good survivors will look through the cracks in walls for it.
---
I'm just saying, it's a little obvious why they can't.
---
I could do that for you, but then you'd turn into the Plague.
---
I got called garbage the other night after I got 3 survivors, first time playing with that killer. I guess that's my fault for trying to get better with more killers.
---
*titty falls out* 
---
Sorry I was doing my hag cosplay again
---
100% with you when i play billy it is what i am doing every time to get at least +1 pips just farming survs because other vise almost for sure its gonna be 0 pips
---
But there's usually plenty to do near a hook, anyway. Kick gens, set up any slow powers you may have, and VERY often someone comes back anyway.
---
Killers have PLENTY of challenge unless they're an addon-loaded master Nurse, so it doesn't make sense to just get amnesia about a hook and commit fully to wandering off in a random direction when the hooked person creates a lead about where players are likely to move. You seem to be thinking of Proxy camping as walking in a visible circle around a hook, instead of patrolling the nearest gens.
---
I want teleporting whore as a flair lmao

I literally don't gen tap u assumed that, the skill checks aren't that hard, but I'm simply saying that ruin isn't a healthy perk for the game, it doesn't promote and enjoyable game nor does it help the killers that use it to improve as they rely on the perk to slow the game
---
Yeah, she could have easily saved me while the killer was hooking the claudette
---
A few months ago, its now so slow its not worth the time it takes

Corvus needs to call it in already.

They didn‚Äôt directly change self care they just increased the amount of time it took to heal

How do you avoid getting hit by noed when the killer is moving 5% faster when it's active lmao?
---
What?
---
&gt;game-stalling camper 
---
Camping is explicitly not against the rules, while stalling the game is against the rules.
---
 However, if somebody is currently on the hook dying, there's no fucking way that guarding them is stalling. Calling somebody a "game-stalling camper" is the ultimate example of twisting reality to justify your shitty butthurt behavior.
---
I like it.
---
Shouldn't the flair be Shitpost?
---
I would prefer literally any other exaustion perk for a save
---
A Nea speed hacked on PS4. I was joyous when I camped her. Playing as clown and hearing the laugh never felt so good. 
---
Just wanted to add that.
---
"Bloodweb changes" I cummed.
---
I wouldn't say winning is a must. It just feels kind of bad when you can't even secure a single kill. I'll be searching for survivors and 1 of them takes my attention and loop spams me into the mid game. After the unsuccessful chase, they got 3-4 gens down. Then the survivors are crouch spamming at the gates letting me know they destroyed me. I actually thought about trying out nurse. However, all the information I've seen about her suggests to stay away from her. Apparently shes pretty high skill ceiling and not very beginner friendly. I'm really bad and new to this game. I do really enjoy it though and would like to get better at it. It just sucks that you cant practice with bots.
---
Not sure why people like this dude, just a reaction queen whose annoying as shit.

If you're bad at pallet looping and get downed within 10 seconds of getting hit then self care is 100% the perk for you.

I'm pretty much just looking for anyone to play with at all, I'm doing my best to get good at survivor, only rank 14 so far while collecting teachables but it'd be nice to have people to play with.

You better buy spirit bro

Killers accomplishing something? Yeah, that's a huge bug.

Is the Doctor even worth playing at this point?  I hate to be a tier list snob, but he's def not near the top.
---
I just put in 40 in DBD and the spirit and Hag are going to be who I play
---
I'd buy this killer. Vision would sure be wonky though.
---
Yeah, they don't seem to like things like fun. Can't sell that as DLC.
---
Sweet revenge
---
I have been everywhere and everything in DBD, gotta say the current draught of the piss color players is worse than piss itself.

And as I am currently a Red Rank killer, players in upper rank do DC but a lot of them still believe in a fair game.

‚ÄúBloodweb changes‚Äù
---
Bless these patch notes and bless my 1500 hours spent grinding just to get (and maintain) every perk on ONE character.

thats actually lit

Now if you would have worn a stuffed bra this would be 10/10.
---
Do Pig players actually have to look through a pig mask or something?
---
Too bad you made your username 8 months ago :/
---
As a survivor main, i think survivors shouldn't be able to bring items to the trial, it doesn't make any sense to appear fully armed with a flashlight with more things attached to it, it kinda ruins the experience of the killers as well fun-breaking for them.
---
Lol well then wtf why does he have on urban if he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fun?
---
And they mentioned bloodweb changes just to say they‚Äôll talk about it later. 
---
They literally brought it up to say why they‚Äôre not talking about it. 
---
I can‚Äôt wait to see what they have in store for us!
---
Iv never been one for the "low" settings. Looks too visibly awful to me. Medium seems to be a good spot for good skill checks.
---
What do you mean "lately?"
---
man with billy i some times get +1 pip instead of 2 just because i didn't get red chaser and why i didn't get it? because i use chainsaw to insta down so its me the stupid which uses chainsaw instead of regular attacks or the killer pip system is sh*t??? that gives you - pips for actually wining the game. sry me but when the main goal of killer turned from killing survs to kicking gens that have like 1% progression? as killer you need to do stupid sh*t which doesn't help you to win at all just to get at least 0 pips when survs just need to fix 1 gen and done they already have +1 pip
---
I consider dc the best win. Makes me laugh every time.
---
Repeepeepost
---
why survs doesn't get - pips for gen rushing?
---
Honestly most surviviors I run into feel this way, it's when people completely make the game unenjoyable that the toxic behavior comes out.
---
my friend said killer should get tp choose where the totems placed since the game has shit spots
---
It was my turn to repost this today! üò°
---
Do you have a video on this? I'm curious lol
---
Ahhh, thanks
---
I'm sure that Egg is a very nice person. I just don't want you spending all your money getting her all glittered up for Easter.
---
Exactly,  completely agrees.
---
Np :D
---
i think if two survivors are in dying state they should be able to heal eachother but it takes like a minute
---
Give me that but with Susie
---
Sheva Alomar or Chris Redfield from Resident Evil 5
---
The bloodweb change sounds like they'll increase the number of perks that appear in each bloodweb, thereby making it easier to get the perks you want over time.
---
I dont think it was that bad of a spot, just really bad luck with where we spawned.
---
That sounds like a nice idea but i already see the impossible totem locations killers will find. But assuming there is set positions and killers all pick the best one all i would do is check those places first. Like the hatch spawn on the badham preschool map.
---
I just looked on the steam store, so many dlcs any you‚Äôd recommend?
---
Was hoping for details on the progression changes sooner than later but it's good to know when we can expect hearing about it
---
Leatherface for killer (you should try to main him for bbq) and Laurie for survivor (for ooo and ds)
---
This has zero counterplay, no good
---
for me theyll be in the middle of the map and yeah i thought that too. i think they just need to hide stuff better
---
As an EU player, I have to on average waddle through 4 lobbies before I find one with a stable connection, which in turn just makes me not want to play the game.
---
A lot of this is due to the distribution of killer and survivor players. In some regions, the number of killers outnumber survivors, leaving not enough survivors to fill their lobbies. This increases queue times for everyone. Moreover, as you wait, the game will gradually expand the acceptable range for ranks and distance until you get a lobby (so you don't wait forever for the perfect match).
---
In other regions, like Japan, it's the opposite. There's far more survivors than killers, which leads to there not being enough lobbies for everyone. Survivor queue times are longer than killer queue times in Japan.
---
The changes we've mentioned should decrease queue times across the board, nonetheless.
---
Why have you bought all these licenced killers but barely played with them?
---
I don't regret mine.
---
XD KEK !!!!
---
So there isn't anyone exactly like the nurse. The closest to a combination of the two is the Hag, who gives you traps that allow you to teleport around the map. Just trapper though new Freddy has traps as well. My personal opinion though would be to get the Spark of Madness chapter//DLC. Doctor is a more difficult killer but once you get the hang of him, will be a bloodpoint generator. The survivor that he comes with Feng Min has two of the coolest perks for new players Technician and Lithe, Lithe is Sprint Burst after quick jumping through the windows or over palets( IIRC also doesn't show the scratches after the vault for a few seconds), and Technician gives you a chance on when you miss a skill check on a generator for it to not explode.
---
It's just to let everyone know that things *are* coming. We've mentioned it a couple times in the past (like in the AMA last week), but not everyone is going to see it. Once the details are finalized, we'll make sure to share.
---
Go read 8 U.S code 1325
---
You mean the Meg that DC'd?
---
Yeah
---
I had a match where the totem spawned dead in the middle of backwater swamps by the rocks and pallets. We couldn't find the totem for the life of us and when i finally saw it the game was pretty much over. It was very well hidden, even once i knew where it was i lost it again when I went back for it.
---
Hag is ranked too low
---
When I first started playing I thought killer would be more fun, but no one is as groovy as Ash.
---
Lol I know I just thought it was funny. Thank you for the clarification!
---
nah the guy in the basement was hooked and doc was chasing someone else
---
&gt;Rest assured, we are still on track for the originally planned Summer 2019 release date
---
&gt;Google: "Summer 2019 in Northern Hemisphere began on Friday, June 21 and ends on Monday, September 23"
---
Devs using the full extent of the term "summer" I see.
---
best boy
---
We're still nailing down the fine details before showing it all off. We figured it would be better to mention it now than saying nothing at all for the next couple weeks. Glad to hear that you're looking forward to it!
---
Think this is the most likely route.
---
It may be bannable if it is set to over 5000 clicks per second since it was lagging the game and I was actually teleporting behind the killer mid chase while using it. Anyway, under 100 clicks per second should be safe.
---
God I want to know what the bloodweb changes are. I'm a little worried that we didn't even get a hint of what it's going to be in this update. Makes me wonder if they know it's going to be poorly received.
---
pop will get them once but they wont fail it again unless theyre low rank
---
I hate the new system. As killer you have to wait to go to the campfire. It's basically 2 lobbies. Just put me in the campfire from the beginning.
---
Spirit has an amazing ass but she's so mutilated and cut up that she would likely just fall apart
---
well you can self care inside a locker so.. not that good of a start
---
\&gt;Trapper
---
\&gt; C Tier
---
How *dare* you do this to him.
---
We'll probably get dedicated servers when we get the next chapter in September.
---
You make an excellent point! We better call it fall or winter just to really add to the confusion. Make people really question what season it is.
---
What could those cut up pieces do... reach wise...
---
I feel like sprint burst wastes a lot more time. Players walking and crouching every where waste a lot more time. Going across the map crouching or walking wastes a lot more time then self care.
---
 I decided to use self care, but I also run prove thyself. I constantly check and communicate to know if someone is getting chased and repair the generator with that time spent.
---
I'm in purple with killer, don't play him that much, but yeah, overcharge is the only perk I'd change for something, but it could work in my favor with pop like someone said
---
Upvotes
---
and on the other hand on the game the totem was like just on a wall upstairs. i think swamp has good totem spots, some maps just need totem adjusting
---
Not at all! The changes are coming directly from community feedback. We need to iron out the fine details first, but when we're ready, we'll share the final version. It's just a little too soon to say just yet. We'd rather not show off an early version and have to go, "Yeah, no, we're not doing it that way anymore." later on.
---
The downvote was from him lmao. I want to play against this "GOD GHOSTFACE" i haven't got a good scare in a while.

When is the "stay together" feature being added?

I‚Äôm straight and even I think Doctor and Wraith should be B tier
---
Where's your corpsepaint, Jeff?
---
That list is for homosexuals with Myers as #1
---
depends, do you wanna buy them for the perks or power? if perks, then go with Clown, Plague and Pig. if power, go with Pig, Plague and Ghostface
---
No i regret mine more
---
You can chamge it
---
I love mah boy Beav Casablancas!
---
Low effort, lots of attention.
---
If three-genning is thing then gen-rushing is a thing. And it doesn‚Äôt matter which perk you bring, the killer is practically forced to bring a perk that slows gens down so they don‚Äôt get obliterated by survivors. And your also saying killers should all run bamboozle. That‚Äôs half the killers perk slots just to stop stupid survivor crap. Stop complaining about having to bring small game when your telling killers to bring two perks (one of which you have to either buy, grind, or wait to appear in shrine) to play successfully.
---
Freddy over Hag.. no. Hag completely forces survivors to play defensively which in turn creates map pressure. Freddy has no map pressure until his teleport is up or until the survivors land in the dream world.. and even then they can just use the clocks or have each other wake up. He has NOTHING to help him in a chase until they‚Äôre asleep, so when they‚Äôre not in the dream he becomes an M1 killer with no power. He gets looped easily unless you spam snares around the loop which takes longer than the hag placing one trap, and even then he relies on the survivor being in the dream.
---
Meanwhile, Hag can pretty much have an entire section of a map on lockdown and can be in multiple places at once, landing hits on anyone that sets off a trap. She‚Äôll constantly have people injured, and if people enter her web, she‚Äôs guaranteed a hit/down if she plays her cards right. Not to mention she passively makes survivors waste time by having to crouch everywhere. Also, as I said earlier, she only has to place one trap at a loop if there isn‚Äôt one already there, forcing the survivor to either abandon the loop or to run through it and pray they don‚Äôt fall for a trap mindgame.
---
Not to mention she has the strongest hook pressure out of any killer in the game.
---
It doesn't matter what exhaustion perk you use as they are situational. Dead hard is good but once the killer knows they will bait it out. Balanced landing is the current best exhaustion in my opinion as it reverts the falling down a death sentence to a lifesaver but you need to reach high places first. Lithe is not so good as if you vault a relatively safe window, like jungle gym or shack, you wasted you exhaustion. So I do think the first three perks are good but situational and lithe is just a no.
---
Perhaps
---
Whenever a survivor cleanses themselves at a fountain is the scariest thing to me when I play the plague
---
But please don't buff it to hard. Some people enjoy the grind.
---
I‚Äôm fucking nutting
---
It would reward playing well. Devs do need to buff huntress with less shit map design though.
---
Well, they are too occupied lying on the ground, bleeding out. Can't blame them honestly
---
Oh. I thought the Claudette was looping around the killer shack and wouldn't move away so I didn't bother.
---
Oh. What is the before time and after time?
---
I want Kermit The Frog as a Survivor now if we could get Mrs. Piggy as a skin and then also the voice! Would be dope! But then I want Oscar the Grouch as a killer next!
---
Definitely not, the dream projection is god tier with you being able to intercept any objective on the map
---
THE CALLOUT POST I DIDNT KNOW I NEEDED

Hag and doc are free idk why they arent on your list.

i want the game and haddonfeild..
---
My knowledge of the Internet won't allow me to see this as cute or wholesome. I look at it and I know some panels were cut out and I'm damn grateful they were but it still makes me uneasy.

Instead of BM maybe break the chase off and find someone he can actually get.

&gt;NEW FRIENDS LIST 
---
I know better than to hold my breath, but if there was ever any reason to believe in the possibility of cross-platform play, I think this is it. Creating a rocket-league specific friend's list that persisted across platforms was the key component to Rocket League's cross-platform playability success. I look forward to the day when I can invite my (PC) friends (Xbox) to play cross-play and they say "nah" and I play alone anyways.
---
Leatherface and Ash
---
i wonder if phone flashlights work on this things
---
Finally a useful tier list
---
You'd be surprised by how many people in this "team game" run perks that are for themselves.
---
Look at my post history and see what you think.
---
I was telling him that mid game, but he was dedicated.
---
His pride will always be his downfall in life
---
that was before the rework. remember how old legion almost literally killed the game
---
Then you can mix and match. Survivors have not known fear until they are ambushed by Miss Piggy with a fucking power drill on her wrist.
---
Aww sheeit son I always wanted Monitor

How am I supposed to play laying facedown? Bhvr pls nerf Myers

Not a bad idea considering people might already do it manually.

I mean, if I had to say a good thing about this, it's that the flair is spot-on.

Are you sure?? Do you play console???

Would you say the clown or nurse (since they both have range attacks) need a buff like this as well?

Leatherface is one of the best starter killers IMO. He‚Äôs not a great overall killer, but you will really learn your shit playing him. And BBQ is a mandatory perk (for BPs)

i've accidentally run through her traps while running from her and it's managed to flip the camera to completely different directions when I was trying to go to a pallet, it made it so i completely turned and run into a wall instead of the pallet and I've gotten downed for it. I kind of wish it didn't do that because that's really my only complaint about Hag.
---
Thats some quality bait.
---
Will that please the majority of survivors so we don‚Äôt have to hear the massive QQs? If so, give them an infinite amount of these offerings
---
Can we get any news on actually getting rank rewards for seasons that has been hinted and discussed for over a year but nothing ever gets mentioned of it again? What‚Äôs the point of reaching rank 1 survivor or killer? Longer wait ques? More stressful games? There should be an auric cell or shrine or cosmetic reward for reaching rank 1. At least make the whole rank reset love hate relationship worth it please?

I'm sorry, but when you say "have no time management", it sounds like you're giving people shit for something that might be entirely out of their control. There are extremely many situations where someone could find themselves stuck in a loop with no rest and no time for fun despite their best efforts, and it's not an enviable position to be in.

As you just said, maps don't allow to hit more than 5 to 10 meters away most of the times, this would just let the very few pro main huntress to use the addons, and I don't think they are the one in needs of good addons.

I mean he also started the VOD by calling one of his SWF ally's girlfriend a bitch so... very kind individual.
---
I am not a high rank killer but this sub has me convinced that nurse is the best killer in the game right now. Dunno why she‚Äôd need a buff to make her even better.
---
Wow ! someone who actually remember how to use a meme.  It's been a fucking while

You can literally play as the scooby gang in L4D but it only affects your game.
---
you get a double de pip when you dc, but maybe it was a visual bug since you got bp from that match
---
&gt;There's no way you can avoid the killer having an advantage in a 3v1 5 gens match unfortunately outside of the killer playing nicer.
---
You could make it so the number of gens goes down when someone DCs, make the gen speed higher if someone is disconnects, etc. 
---
I don't really think dc punishment will do much, people who would insta dc will just suicide on hooks and the change will only hurt those who disconnect for legitimate reasons.
---
I don't know what's funnier. Miss Piggy as The Pig, or that this was posted by someone called LesbianFurryHentai
---
They already have passives in how they look, 
---
Covered in blood: killers know you‚Äôve played a lot (for better or worse)
---
Default skin: killers cannot differentiate you from others as easily (stacks)
---
Height: self explanatory 
---
Clothing options: can dress for stealth or dress for distraction 
---
Player bias: randomly you will get tumbled because you‚Äôre Claudette or given hatch because you‚Äôre Dwight/Quentin
---
Movie meta: randomly when playing a licensed survivor against their licensed killer the killer will become more aggressive/entirely indifferent or passive/ change their play style drastically (for better or worse)
---
Pretty girl: killers will randomly become friendly/tunnel you because you‚Äôre easy to spot
---
Laurie: randomly ‚Äúshe probably has decisive so I‚Äôll leave her on the ground‚Äù
---
Bill: randomly ‚Äúhe probably has BT so I‚Äôll chase him when he unhooks instead of the person he saved‚Äù
---
Everything happened so fast, first a DC from a guy that just got rescued from a hook, then another survivor killed themselves in the hook while I was carrying another one to a hook, then the dude who rescued the first survivor quits right after my BBQ&amp;C activated, and finally the last guy I hooked tried to escape, failed and struggled a bit before dying.

Hey Marble.

---
Okay real talk tho. I watched Clash of the Titans last night and I think it would be badass to have medusa as a killer. Her mori could be turning people to stone and that would be awesome having statues of survivors chillin around the map.
---
I've never ever D/C'd from a match before. I guess it could be visual. I don't remember how many pips I had before that match so I can't check
---
He had like 5 viewers and I'm fairly certain 3 of them were his SWF allies.
---
Watch out for the Trapper
---
lmfaooooooooooooo
---
Don‚Äôt talk about my dad that way
---
Don‚Äôt think is true for ghost face as far as I can tell.
---
Seriously, you are taking some huge leaps with your argument now.
---
\- Yes, Billy has an insta-down. Thus, he has the potential for shorter chases. Thus, he will not do as well in the Chaser categoy. If only he also had the ability to M1...  
---
\- While kicking a gen at 1% instead of chasing a survivor is generally not a good idea, there are many times you do want to kick gens, especially if you have perks like Pop, Overcharge or Brutal Strength. Plus it adds to your gatekeeper emblem and gets you points.
---
\- "Winning" doesn't mean 4k. I've seen games where killers pip after getting only 1 kill, but they played well all game, and earned more bloodpoints, too.
---
\- No survivor has ever done 1 gen and pipped entirely from that alone. Just stop.
---
\- 2 Pip games are not supposed to be easy or common. You can 4k plenty of games but may still safety pip, depending on how you play. So maybe instead of focusing on getting a 4k, focus on having fun and earning bloodpoints.
---
Weird way to spell adrenaline
---
Survivors earn adrenaline by surviving all match and getting the objective done. Killers just get outplayed and are handed free kills.
---
They had us in the first half, lying is a sin.
---
You can get Huntress and David King for free if you download their DLC.
---
YES!!!!! That's my homie Ryan!!!!!!! This is the best thing that's ever been on the news in Tucson!!!!! LOL!
---
I've been accused of "hacking" two times this week...
---
The first: "no cooldown while you were carrying me" so a 2 man swf quit and spectated recorded it so they could report me. It's called MAD GRIT. IT IS A PERK. THANK YOU.
---
The second was when I was playing hag and used disfigured ear with rusty shackles..."what's wrong with your pc? The sound kept cutting out and you were teleporting" I told them it was add-ons and they didn't believe me.
---
My eyes are now permanently rolled back into my head
---
Okay real talk tho. I played Clash of Clans last night and I think it would be badass to have Barbarian King as a killer. His mori could be turning people into gamers and that would be awesome having a bunch of fengs chillin around the map.
---
There have been many instances where I got full BPs but the game counted it as a DC. Alternatively, there are instances where I escaped, the game showed me escaping, and I got 0 BPs because disconnect.
---
This game fucked yo.
---
So they don‚Äôt get fucked completely and anyways the perks easily counter-able at the cost of how long the Match‚Äôll be
---
I don‚Äôt want to play against PC players though
---
Getting P3 is easy. Getting good perks on a P3 is the hard part. I'm about 200 Bloodwebs into my Trapper and still only have Corrupt Intervention 2, and no sign of Ruin anywhere.
---
The whole point is the 1 guy on the hook depips.
---
Also I could be wrong but gen rushing doesn‚Äôt always guarantee you a rank up at red rank. You lose all the altruism and boldness points. And if the person getting face camped dies (second phase struggle camp) then there‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôre making it out alive.
---
TUTUTU TUTUTU TUTU TUTUTU TUTUTU TUTU tututu tu tu tuu...

Urban evasion
---
They actually made a thicc skin? Was this intentional? Have they said anything about it?
---
No it‚Äôs not worth it
---
Secret strength of Laurie is that Killers automatically assume you have Decisive Strike, so you gain the effect of DS even if you don't run it.
---
People may not think they enjoy the grind, but take away the grind aspect from the game and let's see how well it holds up
---
I feel an emotional connection to this.
---
No, that would never work

Wait, this isn‚Äôt the legion...

**Witch time**
---
*The power that the Entity gives you strengthens the power of the Dark Arts. Pressing the Power button will trigger* ***Witch Time*** *for 5 seconds. While Witch time is active, the action and movement speed of survivors in your terror radius will be slown down by 60%. Witch time has a cooldown of 45 seconds.*
---
*You can also trigger Witch Time at any time by pressing the secondary ability button just before you get stunned by a pallet. You wont get stunned by the pallet, but you still have to destroy it.*
---
*Survivors within your terror radius will hear a clock ticking instead of a heartbeat, with it ticking faster the closer you are. Their action speed will also be 10% slower within your terror radius.*

Increase the Pallet Dodge window Considerably.
---
It‚Äôs not bad you they sit on pallets throw a bottle on them then break the pallet and they shouldn‚Äôt be able to reach another loop
---
I'm actually 100% fine with Unbreakable because in most cases it's used as intended and I only have myself to blame.
---
It's when these "defensive" perks get turned into offensive tools that make me realize why we can't have nice things.
---
at P3, its like an extra 3% chance to get an ultra rare un the bloodweb.  
---
The only reason to prestige is if you want the cosmetics
---
haha real funny but we all know this is a screenshot from the game.
---
Pretty good servers so far
---
perfect
---
finally, good content
---
So all the cosmetics I already have? Neat.
---
Eh there are some that I was thinking about buying. But most of these are sets that people already have. :/
---
Oh wow that's dumb
---
Gonna release something that actually works?  Or something broken that will need rolled back within 48 hours, but the first release technically happened in summer so you can claim you didn't technically lie again.....like optimization PATCH.
---
only do it if you really have a main you almost exclusively play and really want his p3 skins. It takes forever to unlock all perks on a killer.
---
Sounds like something might be bugged then. Right now you go from your intial 3 starting tier 1 perks to max everything on a killer in 177 bloodwebs.
---
...or achievements
---
No sir! Not getting out of this chair!
---
I think you‚Äôre correct about this being addressed with dedicated servers. Seems like a lag issue currently where you‚Äôre still at the vault on the killer‚Äôs screen.
---
Fair enough but it's not my fault they were playing the wraith
---
Lol there are no servers.
---
Damn, these arw pretty intense
---
200 Bloowebs considering the 100 from the two first prestiges? That's the only way it makes sense
---
I think this is the first time I saw them attempt to stab.
---
I mean, you were also just playing survivor as any other :/ It‚Äôs like the game is designed to make one side always annoyed.

Hope to see you in the fog!
---
Keys aren‚Äôt one game use. Even if the killer DC‚Äôd it should have you ‚Äòsurvive‚Äô and thus keep whatever item you had. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre leaving out that you died and then they dc‚Äôd. Or that you dropped/used the item then they dc‚Äôd.
---
Maybe they‚Äôll take the Fortnite route? Idk. I would still prefer forced cross play over no cross play personally, but I already play on both Xbox and PC anyway.
---
I'm saying this as a survivor main. And yeah, that'd make you think twice before searching the chests.
---
This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve been accused of hacking. A player accused me of hacking PGTW as Wraith since she tapped a generator, I hooked a player and popped the generator, and then she went back, tapped it and I used PGTW again after hooking another survivor. She got downed after faking a window vault, and I sacrificed her and completed the match. Post Game she proceeded to call me a hacker and kept saying I wouldn‚Äôt have caught her if I didn‚Äôt hack. The funny thing was the player had just accused another killer of hacking through steam screenshots.
---
Protip: if you Google Lenny face you can get a whole library full of wacky faces
---
/rLeaksByDaylight may be of interest to you
---
Yeah she‚Äôs fine the way she is but some survivor mains are salt when it comes to playing against her. I barley made it to p1 with her and it‚Äôs been a long and challenging journey to get up there and have at least a 3 stack by the end of every other match
---
I don't like where this is going.
---
well that's your opinion! and i asked for constructive criticism. So if u dont have anything usefull to say then why even reply?
---
There‚Äôs a post on their site about how the ranking system is sometimes bugged. I believe they mentioned it should be addressed within the next big update.
---
Then there's dashboarding, which they cant do anything about.
---
Thank you for being helpful, polite, and informative as always Peanits!
---
(-_-)7
---
If you‚Äôre level 50 and aren‚Äôt fully satisfied with your perks or add one and don‚Äôt mind ‚Äústarting over‚Äù I‚Äôd prestige or if you just want the cosmetics
---
that really be how it do sometime
---
I literally bought some of these like 3 hours before the sale started... Oof unlucky
---
That was your connection
---
I'll be honest and I say I completely slipped over the part of what triggers the effect LOL but I mean, it would hurt the game tbh searching chests is one of the few things survivors can do other than gens and that can slow the game down, even if just a bit. With that perk in the game people would p much never do it anymore, making chests and the perk useless. It'd be a meme perk I guess
---
Barely isn't good enough :P you still saw it and still dropped it in the beginning of the game. Nowadays if I can get 1 hook before it gets found then I'm happy
---
So Jake, Claud, Dwight, and Meg? 
---
While i agree that a speed increase for Meg may be bad, hence why i aslo suggested the exhasution tiner decrease. And Dwights would cause Gen rushing to be slightly faster. I wouldn't say all the buffs would be bad just from being speed increases to niche actions. Though I would like to hear more of your thoughts on the suggestions. Like which ones exactly are the issue
---
You called?
---
woah I think you're too close man be careful next time
---
The nostalgia just punched me in the face
---
Yes, it's dressing up as a character from something, usually fictional. Have you seen Puppers' Dwight cosplay? It isn't default Dwight, its Dweard Dwight. You can still recognize that it is Dwight, however.
---
He‚Äôs a pretty good player all things considered, but he thinks anyone who doesn‚Äôt play like he does is toxic.
---
He also cries the game is unfair for killers when he loses.
---
You misunderstood me, I meant that you weren‚Äôt doing anything wrong and you were playing survivor just like anyone else would. I wasn‚Äôt calling you a cheater lol.
---
zoopals masks
---
The increase in chance of getting rare items is negligible . Really you only want to prestige if you want the bloody cosmetics. Keep in mind if you think you might purchase other skins its probably not worth it for all the grind you will have to do to get all the perks again. It used to be it was only really worth it on licensed killers but some of them are starting to get cosmetics.
---
You‚Äôve become the very thing you hated
---
It's his cousin Juan Myers
---
I‚Äôm talking accessories and tony details like rips and stains on clothes. Dirtying a dress shirt is not cosplay, it‚Äôs a waste of a dress shirt.
---
&gt;You could've said "just cleanse totems" but instead chose to go with "just don't get hit".. Your (lack of) intelligence level is showing
---
why do you have to speak like that? it's obnoxious
---
Is there more info concerning the bloodweb rework?
---
You need a perk for stabbing them. Crawling is one thing, recovery is another assuming you don't bleed out. The hatch is kinda wonky, but I can see from a balance standpoint why it's there. Point is using the items just seems like a stupid idea to me unless it's a perk. You can disagree, that's fine.
---
I really like the Saw movies but the reverse bear traps in DBD suck.
---
Some players can't separate the chest protector meme build from your garden variety insidious camper.  You'll get salt from those players who don't recognize the meme or still won't care.  I personally think it's hilarious
---
I wanna see a big dick clownerino cosplay or shirtless david.
---
Especially when 2 of the 3 exits in killer shack are trapped.
---
Or all the exits
---
The glorious day when console players have to face the terror that is PC Nurse
---
I like them because I don‚Äôt have to use Ruin when I play pig
---
Lmao I had just popped the gen and was about to go search for it. I was glad I found it but it was a really good spawn :)
---
David riot for 720? Frick
---
sigh ***unzips***
---
Exactly now get out there and fix some gens you lazy tar tar‚Äôs! Nothing in this world comes free!
---
He'd better be wearing a slingshot bikini or I'll riot.
---
One of the main motivators to prestige is because any point spent after level 50 is effectively lost if you change your mind at any point in the future.
---
These dudes are living in the 35th century. Actually I used this very same tactic in Socom Confrontation to no scope with snipers. Kinda mad I haven‚Äôt thought of that yet I do tend to miss some of my further throws because of a wide screen confusing my field of view.
---
Heya add me my psn is Nemisis666 :)
---
This whole post is a bunch of people complaining over nothing. Insta downs and insta heals both exist deal with it. Oh youre mad NOED activated and you got one hit and hooked well maybe that killers mad someone he hit hopped a window healed then extended the chase and now it gives the three others time to do gens and what not. And yes I find both in the moment annoying but I'll also use both whenever I want to and this goes for alot of people actually. And if you can't live with that at the end of the day it is just a game where winning and losing don't even matter so it's whatever just die or lose the survivors then move on to the next match.
---
PS am a salty legion and clown main

Right, but that‚Äôs just what I want her to be *called*

‚ÄúCloaking Mode Activated‚Äù
---
Heya my psn is Nemisis666 add me if you wanna play :)
---
Can I jump on this? I‚Äôm a killer main and just want to get better at both sides of the game.
---
Increases chances of client crashing for 1 or more players.
---
idea: icy shroud, chrome face, and any knife (preferably Damascus steel clip point knife)
---
I want to have every killer prestiged so take this with a grain of salt. I don‚Äôt see a bloodweb difference. I have a p3-50 hag and a 50 ghostface and I get very similar blood webs. Prestigeing is basically just bragging right and cosmetics.
---
Sure thing give me an add and shoot me a message when you wanna play and I‚Äôll happily Mister Miyagi you Daniel San.
---
CLEANSE DEM TOTEMS BOYS &amp; GIRLS! 1k for Dull and 1,500 for glowing ones! Small game helps allot!
---
As long as I can learn to crane kick those cobra ki survivors and killers! I‚Äôll add you now when I‚Äôm off duty I‚Äôll be on and message you!
---
Omg I‚Äôve gotten that to work before and it doesn‚Äôt even look like you are walking as Myers, more as if you are flying!
---
The only problem is Frank hasn't taken off his jacket yet
---
I had a Myers afk once and everyone was buttdancing in front of him when they finished all the generators. After about 20 seconds of buttdancing he went P3 and Everyone freaked out and ran for the exit lul
---
yikes another totem spot i wouldnt want to get caught in
---
The Leg
---
Sounds good I‚Äôm off work today and tomorrow! And as long as you can handle shattering your tibia in the tournament you‚Äôll do fine.
---
Yeah, I don't know what the fuck causes it, go into task manager, more details, and scroll down background processes until you find Dead by Daylight.
---
I've watched him recently and I only see him complain about SWF or the bad perks his viewers give him.
---
I think it was a joke my dude.....
---
Btw as a secondary questions, whats the time it takes to self mend, and to get mended by someone else? It always feels like the time gained by getting someone else to do it is very small.
---
No they just need to trashtalk killers and tru3 from time to time.
---
&gt;Why would Myers have NOED
---
And that‚Äôs why I use it on him :D
---
Get that shit away from me.  I prefer being able to play the game instead of getting hit no matter what
---
Still better than most of them.
---
ITS YOU AGAIN AHA
---
I know your pain
---
ive already been waiting for shirtless legion :( we dont deserve him
---
Personally I think only headpiece is great in it, but the sale is for whole outfit only...
---
Myers mains are just... Evil Within
---
I have 400/30mbps.. it's not my connection.
---
Looks kind of like peter Griffin
---
Commection fan spike dumb shit
---
im lazy
---
Maybe not but, no one can stop me from dreaming about it with this Frank pillow (;
---
That‚Äôs actually a really good tip. I‚Äôve never thought of that honestly. So thanks :)
---
"They were doing gens too well with ruin" he literally just says that they played well how the hell is that being salty ?
---
when i tell you im genuinely thinking about ordering a custom body pillow with this picture im not kidding
---
I was hoping the killer didn‚Äôt head that was cause it would‚Äôve sucked lol
---
Not my fault when they're running into me after being unhooked :/
---
Not gonna let them just run away when i can hit them
---
yeh dude its me
---
This shit really grinds my gears. Dumbass feeds his stalk and it gets popped on me -.-
---
If you want it go for it. I'd definitely love to just have a Frank pillow just for the hell of it
---
I can't imagine it cut. I've never had that happen before, but I guess who knows, It looked like a normal ending to me
---
Of course it is, With the correct perks you can meander around the map and the killer will never see you because you know exactly when he' coming... I played killer main for about a year now thought let's see if this Survivor gig is really as hard as they pretend it to be and from my first 15 games as a survivor I escaped 13 times and 9 of the games I had top points in the end game list. If you tackle it correctly the killer has nothing. This has always been a game where the killer can only cash in on survivors making a mistake, knowing that and knowing how you get wins as a killer all you need to do is not what those dumb ass survivors did.
---
Being a killer main actually teaches you more about playing a good survivor then being a survivor main... because as a killer main you know what prompts you to get in a hit or how they screw up and get downed. Survivors mains never learn that POV.
---
Hopefully
---
I swear I thought i was looking at a risk of rain 2 post when i was scrolling through my feed.
---
No it really wasn‚Äôt...
---
This is a bannable offense lol but still cool to see!!! Would be funny if the two started to fight over who got the pickup and you slowly heal up with unbreakable
---
Heard it before
---
I bet it‚Äôll come out around September 21st cuz its ‚Äústill technically summer‚Äù
---
Played him some more and definitely wasn't as bad as light last night but there are still some instances here and there of it slowing the game a bit. But like you said, it'll probably go unnoticed, especially when the game has more issues to worry about
---
I had the item in my hand. the killer DCed. I lost it. In that order, within 2 seconds of each other. This is my point
---
it wouldnt make any sense but i love this idea
---
I would be a mariachi main if this were real. Does it play the mexican hat dance?
---
Hope they just remove perk tiers
---
So you want to be 100% invis with almost no way to tell if killer is nearby?
---
there were a few with decent masks too, but most were bought online. bragging with something you got for money, instead of crafting it yourself is a joke.
---
**ROYALTY FREE UKUELELE AND PERIOD JOKES IN FIRST 5 SECONDS, WE HAVE REACHED THE HEIGHT OF COMEDY BOYS!**

He looks like a mix between Mike and the Legion
---
Why I like playing Myers when survivors get cocky I run unrelenting
---
not the place for this
---
Let me touch your butt dude!
---
Beautiful, what material are you using?
---
Is there a bundle with him? Cause all i see is that you have to buy him straight up.
---
If people are calling seasons by months, then the end of August is fair game.
---
But sir the lawsuits
---
No. I genuinely enjoyed what I saw and wanted to share.
---
You need to be more specific. Killer or survivor?
---
Survivor
---
The way the devs treat this game they do not deserve gravity falls.  That was a special type of show and should be done by special devs not these imbalanced jokers.
---
Wake me up when September ends.
---
On topic: Nothing new except for the Bloodweb thing - which I, a Patrician who already possesses all perks I want on all characters I play, have no real interest in. No word on optimisation anymore, either. And it always makes me nervous how little confidence their words on dedicated servers hold: *should* lead to more fair-*feeling* hits?...

I made those posts because *I* made them. Frip Frop is a dope youtuber. Go on that video comment section. I have several comments posted. Then click my name and tell me why would I ever lie. Mr. internet detective sir.
---
no its never worth it
---
I've literally only heard the term gen rushing in the context of people being pissed at survivors for doing it, esp mentioning taking toolboxes or prove thyself.
---
If you mean it in the way that survivors are being really efficient with their time and still managing to escape despite hexes and injuries AND you think it's acceptable for them to do so then we're in agreement. I totally fine with people wanting more incentives to do other objectives or even slowing down the game more as a general killer buff, but being mad at survivors for trying to get gens done as fast as they can is about as dumb as getting mad at killers for trying to get a 4k as fast as they can
---
I saw that spot in a game the other day while I was running small game and I swear it about drove me crazy trying to find it. Add in the fact that it was a trapper game and I kept coming to the area assuming it was one of his traps.
---
But you‚Äôre wrong. This doesn‚Äôt happen outside of a bug.
---
Ghost Face or Plague.
---
Pig was the first one i bought and i played her a lot but she got worse as i went up in rank and the people were better. It was worth it though just because of Make your choice and Surveillance which i use both of on Freddy
---
Legion really sucks and Clown's tonics are a lot harder to use for me than they're made out to be, I personally don't recommend them, that being said I've had my team get easily 4k'd by the low tier killers
---
If you want to play him, if you enjoy playing him, then play him. At low ranks he's as good as anyone else, you'll only start to see problems as you get to the top - and by then you should have access to multiple instadown perks to cover for his lack of threat.
---
I mean, you're not wrong about his ranking, but if you care about that then really you may as well go for Nurse, Billy, or Spirit and say no more about it.
---
Not even Julie smh
---
I am not focusing on 4k... I am focusing on geting at least 1 pip and its too hard and when i talk about 2 pips i didnt say it should be easy but when you get every time 1pip with 99% to 2 pips becouse the chaser didnt had his 1 more % you are going mad
---
For me on steam its just "-rep noob" etc. Its just silly.
---
As a Jake main I can confirm I dont mind dying for the team... if it was a good one
---
Maybe if you weren't an ignorant twat you would know that even legal citizens have been getting raided by ICE. They don't care if you're legal or not, but I wouldn't expect someone like you to actually pay attention to what's going on.
---
if it Robert Englund Freddy it would be SSS+
---
Ok, uh wow. Lots of words, but lots of very HELPFUL words. Thankyou for the advice and I'll def try feng and doc.
---
PERIODT!!!!!
---
Lol I didnt.
---
sounds like Dwight
---
Jakes usually are people that just do gens, do safe unhooks and (despite their sizes) are pretty good at hiding/juking
---
URBAN EVASION
---
Hmmm interesting. Well at least that would make sense, as opposed to the otherwise completely random decision it appears to be.
---
Ouchie, my feewings.
---
No, survivors don‚Äôt need nerfs, most of the killers need to be buffed to have better mobility, make them walk slightly faster, make their ability slow them less, small things
---
So when killer depip every single game unless he have huge luck becouse ALL survs gen rush its OK but when 1 salty surv get depip its not ok 
---
Iron logic
---
Probably another reason why they gave Bill to consoles.
---
David King has a perk (We're Gonna Live Forever) that double the amount of points you gain each game if you do enough saving and protecting. This will help you a lot if you get it really quickly. Also, watch OhTofu's guides on youtube.
---
Unlikely* i screwed up the tile
---
If he doesn't play often it's totally possible, especially if he's playing at non-peak times for his region when matchmaking is more imbalanced.
---
Tbf most of the killers/survivors featured are available in the base game for console players.
---
That's kinda what I'm going for. Though i want the passives to be minor incentives to play the character. Make em unique you know?
---

You can't derank past 15 and anyone who deranks that much will get the unsportsmanlike autoban

You do know what the punishment is right? You're given longer queue times the more you DC, i.e. you will be able to play less until you start finishing games, they also stated nothing will happen if you DC once or twice in a blue moon, hell the only reason they are holding off on implementing the punishment is for dedicated servers so they can cut down DCs at the fault of the server side.
---
BHVR already covered these points, no idea why people like to ignore that
---
I meant that the outfits almost all don't have a grind option, since they don't do that for anything remotely nice looking. Then their discount is like $1 off a $10 set that you still need to buy a $10 bundle of cells for.
---
I never said you Gen tap
---
Smh
---
thats what i mean, the pacing of the game needs a huge change. it should not solely rely on a single perk which may be null a few seconds into the match
---
Love Franklin‚Äôs
---
Peppa...
---
But what if they sell out people who are not contributing
---
-*smoking for 15 consecutive years*- sorry just working on my Nurse cosplay
---
Its mandatory according to the surviviors rulebook for killers so I have to...
---
ahhh you mad
---
In a case like that I'd have run to the other gate. Even still, as you said you were lucky!
---
Double depip is ONLY for DCs. You couldn't possibly kill someone without getting a few emblems, at the very least any kill will get you bronze devout.
---
Hag und Plague should be B Tier.
---
I laughed out loud first time I saw that in his bloodweb
---
*Phineas and Ferb are trying to corrupt orphans into killing an old janitor!*
---
Yes you can derank to 20 if you DC
---
Can you tell me the dance? I wanna dance on graves today! While breathing intensely?!
---
Basically you want offerings to make the game into a casual match rather than a ranked match. No, just give us the damn button.
---
idc i want miss piggy and i want her **NOW**
---
This is a really bad shitpost
---
Am I \*Micheal Myers\* to you?
---
Sounds good I can play a quick game of killer
---
Hillbilly definitely. His chainsaw is easy to dodge if you got half a brain and dont panic drop pallets when he raises his chainsaw and when he does raise it you can just get a extra loop because he slows down and if you do those 2 things he is a M1 killer in a Chase unless he has curve add-ons but if we are just talking about base chainsaw it's not good although he does have lots of mobility and if there isn't any pallets around you can get a easy chainsaw.
---
Freddy is my least favourite too, he just annoys me
---
OINK OINK!!!
---
You might have time for two! The place I‚Äôm at is slow üòÖ
---
Sorry, there aren't any, but thanks for the compliment üòÅ
---
I switch off shadowborn and deerstalker sometimes because i like how bright the map gets
---
I don‚Äôt think so, I‚Äôve seen people on YouTube and Twitch with it.
---
??? im trying to ask for help are there better perks?
---
To pip as a killer it‚Äôs actually better to focus on chasing survivors. Not instant killing them or camping.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why no one ever cosplays as haggy bb
---
Not yet, they said we'll know about it by the end of the month.
---
I just hate seeing ‚Äòentity displeased‚Äô makes me feel like shit :(
---
And for some reason all Freddies hard tunnel and slug.
---
cuz its ez to re-create, me on the other hand wants to cosplay as the plague, bug i dont wanna cut my toe off and ill also need to grow like 3 feet taller, also ill need to makeup everywhere which would be so expensive, so i see why ppl cosplay as legion
---
For me even though I‚Äôve closed the game the menu music will keep playing for like a minute.
---
I lost a ranked game last night because of the enemy Sombra. Fuck her. Fucking annoying little insecct.
---
Disable the chat box, and set your profile to private.
---
Because Snares have more depth, pallets are just very spamable in general
---
Gonna have to disagree on this, politely of course
---
Yes I know that in most cases pallets will be more effective and better since atleast 1 out of the 4 surviviors is usually either dumb or lazy (hey I dont judge) but the long term value of snares can actually be incredible
---
Starts humming all star, oh just working on my huntress impression what about you?
---
People quitting needs to be looked at, especially when it's a SWF and they all quit because they aren't happy with the killer.
---
It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs your job to kill them üòÇ
---
I don't think the decision is up to BHVR, I think they have to get explicit permission from the people that gave them the Freddy license.
---
How long have you been playing? And how much did you spend? 
---
I got the game for 8$ due to the dyling light discounts that‚Äôs why i don‚Äôt really mind spending 10$ worth.
---
Ik what you mean
---
In my experience games just seem so sluggish against him
---
100% the Spirit, no fun to go up against.
---
Which I don't even understand. He's one of the few streamers who plays both sides pretty much 50/50 making him one of the most reasonable voices.
---
I didn't downvote you first of all nor gave you an attitude but proceed to get defensive and bring up your alleged amount of hours to prove a point in your opinion towards perks and builds.
---
Nah haven't had a problem with this just with high ping. Have to keep rejoining matches and it's at about the same ratio as what you're experiencing with dodging
---
No as a survivor. Maybe alot of people do swf on PS4
---
I need this type of help
---
Getting good perks on all survivors is a huge wsste imo
---
1400 hrs in i have 90% of killers with good perks and 5 survivors with all perks
---
Its honestly impressive that they managed to do an actual in game friend list by itself i HIGHLY doubt it will be advanced enough to have all platforms connected
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt such a love hate relationship with a killer before. As a killer I LOVE to play as Spirit she feels very rewarding when you down someone and then on the other hand as a survivor it‚Äôs like someone rubbing sandpaper into your open wound every time I see that sexy ass school girl rofl stomp my team man it hurts. But she‚Äôs so adorable üò≠
---
Since the dawn of time if you are considered a main killer and/or you want some killer buffs, most survivors will hate you, and since there are more survivors than killers, easy maths.
---
I‚Äôve had time for 3 but I got adept plague WOOOOO
---
This has to be troll bait.  You're not even a mediocre Nurse let alone the #1 of anything running NOED.  This looks like hard bait.
---
Unfortunately the other gate was very close by, and hadn't been started yet, so I didn't want to chance him coming for me after he pushed them out the exit.  I just clenched my jaw and ran at him. lol  Definitely got lucky.
---
I love the random downvotes and no responses. Keep it up, guys.
---
It would need some upside, though, like increasing flashlight resistance.
---
Its a LOT easier to prestige someone than it is farming all perks mate.
---
spirit and ghostface just boring gameplay
---
Ok I know this ain‚Äôt about you playing or whatever but I have advice.
---
Look behind you whilst running, it can help alot
---
Xbox is the worst. Anything you do is toxic and you‚Äôre always bad. If they run into your face you‚Äôre tunneling, if you‚Äôre within 40 meters of them you‚Äôre camping.
---
moderately increases chances of dying on first hook
---
No I didnt
---
It's not just that, it also increases the barrier of entrance for new players. I know this from real life experience when I showed the game off to a friend and explained how it worked. He was interested till I told him how long it would take for him to get all perks for one single character. It was just too much of a time investment for him before he could get to play with the full game as essentially the full mechanics of the game is locked behind that time investment.
---
Outside of glitches, the other points aren't legitimate reasons to DC though...
---
easy and people see susie as cute so-
---
For the start it's not so much about perks or item.
---
I advise you to focus on understanding the chase mechanics. What is a loop point / How to optimize the use of different loop points / How to act in chase regarding the killer you're facing‚Ä¶
---
Don't hesitate to watch some streamers like Noob, True and compagnie to get this.
---
What's the problem?
---
You're either lying or hacking. Either way.
---
Rip
---
As a Legion main I can confirm
---
Oh my god let people enjoy things
---
Said it before I‚Äôll say it again. BP bonus for specific actions for each survivor is the way to go, you can‚Äôt give buffs even if they are small amounts.
---
Nope
---
she looks like a pregnant teen yall have a weird fetish
---
He saw my outline through the building due to him also being down
---
If you enjoy sitting in an hour long match where the doctor is making it a point to keep you in there for as long as possible &amp; never interacting with you, you getting bled out coz the killer feels like it and other such amazing events, that's good for you. 
---
I'd definitely wouldn't stick around, that's an awful experience and that's not something I'd want to endure.
---
There's not much to improve, though. Killers implicitly have a low skill ceiling. Nurse can blink away and back later, and Huntress can proxy from much farther, but in a lot of cases, returning to patrolling distant gens is just giving a free unhook for only a vague potential of finding someone else. You make it sound like there's any guarantee of even slowing gen progress by immediately leaving the hook and everything should be measured against that.
---
Pipping is almost undesirable, too. Toxicity generally scales with rank.
---
I think they meant rank 1 maybe ? Doesn‚Äôt seem like English is their mother tongue. Or it‚Äôs a shitpost
---
Don't let this toxicity get to you. Move on and forget it, it will only cause more chaos if you respond to them. It's how this game is. Win a game, get poop talked on and move on. 
---
Their loss your win. Noed is obviously going to start a rustle.
---
what audio files?
---
i have my profile open for pinned messages so i can collectall the sweet sweet -rep and wear them as kind of medals each saying "you just owned a toxic kid"
---
Probly trapper not cuz he's op I just get extreme paranoia cuz ya know I gotta watch out for his traps
---
ok
---
Difference is that nurse requires skill. Legion did not
---
Increases chances of being tunneled and camped
---
You don't have to, it still applies.  If a bad killer can 4k an entire team of bad survivors, then that is fairly balanced because it doesn't happen consistently.  If a group of good survivors can all escape a bad killer then that is fairly balanced because those survivors know how to use their tools and wits to be a strong team.  If a group of good survivors can escape with 2 alive against a good killer consistently that is pretty well balanced because the killer matches them in wit and plays the game of cat and mouse to see who comes out on top.  He is evenly matched with a team of 4 survivors in strength.  He gets kills, some of them survive.  Balance is achieved.
---
However, if a good killer is able to consistently 4k a good team of survivors then there is probably an imbalance there.  Reason would show that good players don't make many mistakes, but if it still costs them the game over and over again then there is an imbalance.  Same to be said on the flip side.  If a really good killer can't consistently kill at least 2 survivors nearly every round then there is an imbalance.
---
It's all stats.  Sprinkle in some 4ks, sprinkle in some 2ks, and some 0 ks, and you have an average that is consistent and balanced.  No killer should ever 4k 50% of the time, just like no group of survivors should ever all-escape 50% of the time.  Those are wild swings of imbalance of power.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0cOyEDm02Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0cOyEDm02Q) these, really weird ones

My dbd froze because someone tried calling me on steam as I was loading and now I have been siting here for \~30 minutes just staring at a frozen loading screen. alt+f4 doesnt work, task manager doesnt, and I dont want to restart my pc...
---
Wait, there are ‚Äòreal‚Äô builds? I just use the perks that I like that help my play style.
---
okay. my one recomendation that doesnt require bloodpoints for perks or anything. turn the camera around and look behind you in a chase to see where killer is and possibly dodge his hits. trust me it helps SO much. id also suggest starting witg claudette because empathy and self care are great. empathy lets you see peoples auras/outlines when theyre injured. empathy 3 is best because you can see them basically across the whole map. this is nice cause you can go and heal those people or of you see someone running around injured you can see the killers over there and work on a gen knowing your safe. OR if theyre close youll know to GTFO. some people say self care isnt the best cause your teamates can heal you but if youre the last person it could be life or death. i also think healing yourself is just good to do when youre first starting because it helps you practice skill checks. good luck :))
---
If the picture I saw was correct (it's been right so far), Ace is coming out on the 21st. 
---
The picture went Claudette &amp; Jane &gt; Ghostface &gt; Meg &gt; Ace &amp; Hag &gt; Nea &gt; Jeff &amp; Kate
---
25% is huntress
---
Calling somebody trash is actually an example they give of what they ban for. Go read Xbox rules sometimes, they're insane.
---
You can also get muted for telling somebody to learn English lol.
---
according to the road map you are right chapter 13 dedicated servers
---
I hope you have better look than I did at getting the Beyond Two Souls app to work.  It would never connect to my PS4.  *grumble grumble*
---
Really? I heard that Xbox was allowing a little more trash talking. Guess that wasn't true then.
---
Considering you've essentially ignored my entire comment and have pettily referred to my downvotes (as if those mean anything), I don't think you have any further argument. My opinion is founded on what the devs have said and information about this game. I believe your opinion is founded on confusion, and, quite frankly, stubbornness and salt.
---
You could use it on the hatch
---
You're scorpion? Didn't I tell you months ago that you aren't the best nurse? The best nurse doesn't use ruin at all let alone ruin+pgtw. You aren't that good my man.
---
Let me ask you something, Carl, and I hope this gets the point across because nothing else has worked.  How often do you 4k?  How often do all the survivors live?
---
Plague cosplay when
---
lithe is a really good exhaustion perk, i main feng, but i dont think the other perks are very good. alert means whenever the killer breaks a pallet or gen you can see an aura of them for a few seconds. if you hear a pallet breaking or a gen breaking youll know where they are anyways, if not, theyre not super close. (i think good headphones is the BEST thing to start with). technician means that if you mess up a skill check you have a chance that it wont blow up the gen. i wouldnt use this because you want to be getting BETTER at skill checks, not being safe when you mess them up. bond is dwights good perk that actually works for you (the others are for teamates around you). bond is when survivors are close enough to you you can see their auras, but empathy is this same thing just with injured survivors but at way longer distances. fhis is just my opinion but yeah
---
imma ask how dem exit gates even got opened with Iridescent Head
---
*Sad Ace sounds*
---
A little bit off topic but I love the way Michael walks after a match like he really needs to go to the bathroom.
---
The show that's from is actually brilliant 100% recommend it
---
I dig Legion. Play style is very aggressive and way different than other killers. He wants to find everyone early, injure, slow pace and start wearing teams down with Thanat and Sloppy. Many good perks are viable with him and Discordance is a quality teachable. If you like run at you in your face killers I would go with Legion. If you prefer killers who are stealthier or prefer more tactics I‚Äôd go with Ghostface.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve met anyone who thinks clown and trapper are good
---
i also wouldnt suggest starting with an exhaustion perk until you understand the game more
---
Tru3tal3nt a.k.a. the biggest manchild in the world
---
What about being downed and having a random teammate instantly bring you to your feet required you at all? In that scenario, you did nothing but recieve the heal.
---
If I give a child money on their birthday, that child and I didn't demonstrate any teamwork. They got money that I gave them. I gave up money to a child. We didn't need to coordinate that interaction or plan it. They either accept the money or refuse it. The same goes with an insta-heal. The only difference is that the downed survivor can't refuse the heal. 
---
You are right that there are literally no rules saying survivors *can't* pick each other up instantly without reaction. But that doesn't mean that they *should* get to, or that the interaction even remotely resembles teamwork. At best, it resembles charity. 
---
Is the game about playing as a team of 4 vs a singular threat? It is. Do people always play it that way? No. As a result, the team of 4 is unknowingly crippling themselves by playing selfishly vs a much stronger threat. 4 seperate arms and legs aren't nearly as coordinated as an actual human being. 
---
That being said, solo survivor feels unfair vs any competent or well-equipped killer. The 1 becomes much stronger than the 4. It is easy to win against 4 small threats, 1 at a time. But when the 4 small threats work together, it is becomes more balanced. Unfortunately, BHVR added things to the game that allowed solo survivors a fighting chance in much smaller, specified, scenarios. 
---
Information that SWF gets can be somewhat simulated using maps. The safety of SWF put into instaheals. The efficiency of SWF put into toolboxes. But these things aren't exclusive to solo queue. So when SWF gets items meant for isolated 1v1 interactions, and uses them as a team, it becomes a nightmare for the killer.
---
YES !! this is how it‚Äôs DONE. I never stop genning until the killer is coming right for me.
---
I laughed way to hard at this
---
Need a ghost face one
---
I did this earlier today and it felt really bad. The last living survivor was one that had me chase her all game, and wiggled free from me far to often. When I downed her I expected it to be a nice easy walk to the hook, but she started wiggling.... So I dropped her and let her bleed out. The time waste sucked, but not as much as seeing her go free would've sucked.
---
During a game I played today, I spawned in the killer's shack, so I went downstairs, stole his stuff, and scoot my butt on his floor.
---
Well the second I get upstairs **BING BONG** and I'm on the hook in less than a minute from the game starting
---
And now considering you've succumbed to your salt, started spewing jokes like misnaming me "Carl" and calling me a fool, I don't believe talking to your further wields any benefit to me. Unless you have something of substance to add to the discussion, goodbye.
---
If you are brand new, Wraith is where you should start, but as you improve he won‚Äôt scale as well into higher rank matches, so I might recommend Legion who can excel until about red ranks. Myers is the other starter killer I would recommend as he is good against all skill levels with multiple play styles and you will learn a lot with him. He‚Äôs simple but requires some strategy.
---
That was me too!  Well, the camping part, as I was like, look, I'm securing a death, yay me!" Then I joined this subreddit and finally clicked a topic with the word "campers" in it and realized I was the worst.  Now I hook mostly in the basement as I learned that no one tries to save someone in the basement.  I've stopped myself after also dying in the basement or being killed on my way to the basement.
---
The four person d/c. Im trying to get blood points and they all choose to d/c after they get downed.
---
Dead Hard is one of the strongest perk and We're gonna live forever is very good when you start the game. Just because you might have or had trouble with DH doesn't mean he will.
---
Wheres the disconnecting punishments?
---
They are still free bro
---
I heard this comment

C-can I be the one who whips you

I don‚Äôt, some perks have slightly different uses and allow a little bit of customization at lower tiers.

Not worth it, unless you want the cosmetics.

Why does this not have 3k upvotes

How so? Can you give an example.

Sorry, it‚Äôs a toxic community
---
What cosmetics are my fellow ace mains rocking?
---
True, but there‚Äôs gotta be a way to make him viable without besides just pure skill because sadly I‚Äôm not very good with him.
---
Still gonna cosplay as him XD at least my mask is made from clay. But it's easier to shit on people. Think I've seen like four or five of these sort of post. More than I've seen of cosplay.
---
Honestly, I feel they don't really matter or make a difference, but I could be wrong.
---
Only the suit I‚Äôm a broke boy :(
---
Uhhh possibl√©? What‚Äôs your survivor rank?
---
Maybe go for a lethal/slug build since ideally you should be downing people a lot as Ghostface. Idk all the perks you have but his perk Trilling Tremors is pretty good and should help slow down game somewhat.
---
I'm sorry but can you educate me on the hatch spawn on the bedham preschool map? This is something I'm unaware of?
---
In my opinion if you do I would use all of your moris, bloodpoint offereings, and addons you use first til you run out of reach a million blood points then prestige.
---
Well if you don't get potatos(like I do) or are godly with him then you kinda need a gen stopping perk like ruin or you can use thrilling tremors which has saved me multiple times but that's involves downing people so yeah.
---
I mean if you just d/c constantly regardless of your rank you should get a 1 day - 1 week - 2 week ban kinda thing. It's not something that should be acceptable.
---
Myers. Too many playstyles that are all bullshit in their own way. Infinite T3, I saw you once the entire game and MORI, Jumpscare... its all fucking annoying regardless of what perks he's actually got.
---
Trapper is kind of in a weird spot. His ability is actually good at fucking with the ingrained loop like crazy survivor meta but its also rather slow to set up and almost REQUIRES an add on to feel more bearable. Maybe if they baked in the extra starting trap he would be better?
---
I don‚Äôt either, I just care about bloodpoints and having fun. It also helps that I never really rage.
---
No, I didn‚Äôt want the reader to read a pause there, so no comma was put. But I love me some good ol fashioned 2010 grammer nazi that somehow knows exactly what OP is trying to convey better than himself, here‚Äôs some internet points.

Because that's just what heroes do...

Funny enough, I‚Äôve recently had longer queue times with survivor than killer. Both rank 5. I just want to play survivor...
---
There can‚Äôt be two
---
*Just grab the survivor.*
---
This is how I know your arguments are invalid. What kind of bottom-tier, worse than rank 20, deafer than deaf, blinder than blind, survivors do you have on your team that makes you think killers *just* get grabs? There's terror radius, there's the fact that every killer except Hag is taller than survivors, and then there's just plain looking around. If even after all of that, you still get grabbed, then *you* are the problem. 
---
Of course you think instadowns are broken. Your teammates are worse than braindead. They're catatonic. Anything that lets the killer oneshot *you* is gonna feel like a death sentence. Your teammates couldn't even find the brightly colored, global aura of the hook you're on.
---
Any chance you can train another Mr Miyagi

Did you.... did you read the flair?

I tend to play survivor cause I just wanna play and not wait forever. So it frustrates me when I have games like this. I feel you though.

That's an ideal time for a release!  I'll have to keep it on my radar so I can snatch it up too.
---
I guess it is then, but there was no way for me to know this without the feedback others, so I assumed with such specific circumstances that this was how it was if you got a reasonable way into a trial.
---
Tell that to Rainbow Six Siege
---
The entire point of cosplay, why we call it cosplay instead of wearing a costume, is because YOUR SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT. That‚Äôs literally the only goddamn thing that separates the two, the fact that you don‚Äôt even know what the hell cosplay means but your defending it to death is sadder my fellow neckbeard.

---
they'll get generators done without ruin but yeah you can do just fine. depending if you're in a chase for a long time or not....if you're like spirit, nurse, hillbilly, or hag running ruin maybe even comboed with other hex ruins, you can most times kill them all before they even get 1 or 2 gens done (of course depending on totem's spawn)

Wraith from Apex is played by [Shantel VanSanten](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1416900/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t12) where DBD's Wraith is credited as [Filip Ivanovic](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4270226/) so that's not really a fact as so much being a pretty broad connection.

He definitely doesn't run like hillbilly in the film. Leatherface's current animation represents the film adequately.

True. I was just thinking it would be easier to redo Billy than Leatherface but like another guy said it wouldn't be fair for people that don't want to buy Leatherface and have Billy perked out.

Or maybe you get perk tokens from a web and can trade those in for the perk of your choice.

Same except DH,MYC,nurses,sloppy 
---
I may run ruin if I've had a bad game or two, but I've found devour hope /make your choice + making sure to patrol gens has really made me better overall, ruin only seems to lead to longer chases earlier or worse being taken out immediately

Rank6/5 killer
---
lmfao if that was me I'd be big mad
---
This woman‚Äôs hair has never been normal, I remember her helicopter days.
---
I actually practiced it a bit
---
Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Balanced landing. Decisive strike if you feel like tunneling is a big problem. Spine chill if you want to avoid stealthy killers or hide from the nurse before she teleports on top of you.
---
I personally like distortion. It gives me a "free" gen or two if I'm soloing a gen when an aura reading perk kicks in and its a great way to figure out what aura reading perk the killer has. Do I lose a token when theres a hook? BBQ and chili, do I lose a token at generator completion? Rancor. Etc. 
---
Aftercare isn't terrible either if you get it running and you are doing solo survivor. Seeing other survivor auras can make some pubs actually feel coordinated.

PS4
---
I really want that perk
---
Well at least they had a plan lol...
---
Just a question but dosent Myers tier up theme get louder the closer you are to him meaning they should have realized they were being stalked when he got to tier 2?
---
Nope. I feel dumb
---
I like Hag for that reason. This is a horror game, after all.
---
It sounded like he was the killer honestly
---
Cya in hot
---
Sorry I hurted your feelings.
---
you didnt.
---
I changed the inverted shit to left on the dpad so I never click the shit
---
If your just now recruiting for a team the day before the tournament using Reddit with people you don‚Äôt know, you would be better off not wasting your money.
---
"Tenno, there is a new mission available."
---
Then no need to get all sassy when I give an advice.
---
Gonna need to bring in Glue man to deal with this
---
Yea... just realized that. Changed the dates around to make it work.
---
Literally not related to DBD
---
im saying youre suggestomg a handicap for a new player. not getting sassy bud
---
This is a common complaint, and what I've heard here a couple times is that if the killer dc's their internet / tcp disconnects then everyone loses everything, but if the killer closes their game or leaves the game, you keep your stuff.
---
I don't think doubling your points when the grind is real is a handicap but alright.
---
I go for saves when I'm not in a chase or when the killer isn't camping so I at least try instead of leaving someone to die on hook. If your in a chase and you have a key and I don't know where you are, sure leave me behind, but if you ran around map to look for hatch because you have a key and you didn't bother telling me, that's different.
---
he literally has no mither hes got bad perks. double points is great but you need to start out with a better survivor. double points mean nothing when you cant get any to begin with
---
Forced crossplay is just a no-no. Forcing console survivors vs PC Nurses, and potentially way worse, forcing PC survivors vs console killers (!!!) would be terrible. Poor console killers would struggle to connect hits lol
---
Can you cosplay as yourself?
---
and if you dont know how to use dead hard its a handicqp
---
She hooked me.
---
feelsragequit
---
It help me * f o c u s*
---
I assume because it‚Äôs really difficult. You‚Äôd probably have to use a lot of body paint or something.
---
8/10 times it‚Äôs teabag &gt; point
---
Yes, no shit.
---
me tbh
---
You do now.
---
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
---
That's rarted
---
I would drop so much money if they really put the bee out
---
You're saying this as if killers are pros, killers are as bad as survivors when you start so it's not harder to get points. And he won't know how to use Sprint Burst, he won't know when to use Urban Evasion, or most perks because it's new, that's the point, he's supposed to learn. And tbh, when I start a new game, I'm usually trying to challenge myself rather then to try the easy mode.
---
Pls someone explain
