This guy really thinks he’s the shit because he can DDOS people, I’ve come into contact with him too. If only Sony banned this cunt.
---
---
---
How is it not, I never specified what percentage. U did
---
You I was asking why you felt the need to jump into a civil discussion and be hostile. We are literally just bickering. I'm not replying because it's unproductive to continue arguing with you.
---
I think the Clown wants to be rid of his sins. Everything has a message.  
---
Remember Christian folk, play Doom and kill demons for Jesus, Play DBD and uh tea bag killers for jesus? Does Jeff count? FOR JEFF!
---
Discordance, Monitor and Abuse, Surveillance, and Hex: Ruin.
---
The "percentage" is irrelevant.
---
I don't see why they don't.
---
If freddy doesnt look down when placeing his traps he can use them to force survivors to abandon loop without needing to guess like trapper and can also more reluably catch them inbetween loops. Its a big deal.
---
What do you mean, prayer beads are balanced.
---
It's a good tracking perk but the 60-second cooldown really harms its uses in my opinion. If it was reduced to 30 or 20 seconds then it wouldnt be too bad but 60 is taking it to far.
---
I am looking at the animation correctly. People are acting like they shouldn't be able to be hit anywhere in the pallet animation, despite if the pallet has actually hit the killer yet or not.
---
I suspect that since the leak they’ve been advised to change certain things in order to not get in trouble with the holders of the Scream license.
---
oh yeah, i forgot about that. Thanks mate!
---
Grindy grind
---
How do I use a macro on Xbox?
---
If you see him while 360ing your **3rd person camera** then you can just focus on him and counter his ability by looking at him for the amount of time required, therefore, rendering his power unusable.
---
They still fixed spirit though. It took a while, yeah, but now she's top tier.
---
Yep. That's bannable. And extremely assholeish.
---
Franklin's tear gas
---
I mean that basically never happened before the change and even now end game collapse keeps you from being there too long.
---
I got called a shitty killer last night cuz I ran exhaustion add-ons on Huntress and sac'd a guy... he was running dead hard lmao
---
OP asked for people's spirit builds, so this dude commenting with his spirit build is of course valid.
---
Just cleanse totems then
---
SAMF Jeff, Dead Meat reference ?
---
r/suspiciouslyspecific
---
Mike manages to stalk players just fine already and he has to stalk longer than 4 fucking seconds. You're exaggerating...
---
Well if it does hit the killer obviously they shouldn't get hit, common sense. If it doesn't hit the killer then idc about that.
---
Not on the PTB they didn't.
---
Is his name actually Carl?
---
Give it a rest, babbys first gatekeeping.
---
Maybe not on the ptb, but it still happened.
---
No it's not, u said 100% guaranteed safe as I just said safe which could imply any percentage.
---
To be fair the perk will barely ever activate anyway so it's not like your losing anything for having such a massive cooldown.
---
Just Messing around
---
Hey Mom can I have **The Ghost**
---

---
No we have **The Ghost** at home
---
**The Ghost** at home: tHe GhOsT fAcE!
---
Eh, I mean I won't hardcore "camp".
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'll proxy around the two hooked survivors checking generators and seeing if I can catch a third survivor trying to hide nearby for the survive, then I'll start wandering in wider circles - I might rush to a far generator and check, then pop back over to the 30\~ meters around the hooks.
---
They'll pop one of the survivors off the hooks and if I see it happen, I'll go chase. If I don't see it happen, I'll slide over to the other hook and see if the rescuer is going for a double-unhook.
---
If they're not, I'll probably go back in the direction of the first unhook and see where they ran.
---
But I'll not actually camp to the point where it's absolutely impossible to unhook them or I'm not doing anything besides camping.
---
That would be why I tagged it as salty
---
BBQ for the points, Ruin, Haunted Grounds and then rotate between Stridor, Discordance, Surveillance.
---
Ghostface: "time to stealth"  
---
\*Loud ass noise notification indicating he has entered stealth\*
---
I'd love a link to where anyone said this. People keep reporting this as the intended mechanic, but I haven't been able to find any communication from BHVR or anyone affiliated with them that even implies this.
---
They’re not gonna release ghostface as is because he’s BUGGED
---
Well, people should learn. Else, all survivors first view, which would be undisputedly a good idea for the game, but hated by the survivors mains
---
how many killers can down a survivor every 20 seconds?
---
You're just arguing semantics now. I'm done here.
---
And yes, I'm aware of the standard "get gud" response.
---
I'm just at a loss how all 5 gens we're done within minutes of the match beginning.
---
That's what pisses me off about Ghostface. Myers already proves there's a counter to stalking Killers: it's called *running the fuck away and hiding behind a tree.* If Ghostface just moved at 110% (or even 100%) while using his power then there would be a tangible downside to make him stop using it. But instead he has to have his power canceled by a light breeze.
---
Camera on both sides of the phone bud
---
You absolutely can.  A streamer was banned for it.
---
https://gyazo.com/a966c19654c95c68fb9ed6e09a49015a
---
This is the best i can find on it. 
---
The same person also said this on a fourm:
---
They'll have to be within 32m and looking fairly close to you. We're going to be keeping an eye out for this specifically (among other things) during the PTB. The goal is to make sure that it's forgiving enough that it'll work as long as you know they're there, but strict enough that it won't detect them if you don't know they're there.
---
Something like that, although we can control how big that "spotted" area is. We can always make adjustments if it doesn't feel right.
---
I’m not sure if you are serious or not, ^but ^I ^think ^that’s ^a ^pretty ^good ^idea
---
i can't believe there are great perks on the shrine (except OP)
---
Yup, 3 was the only one that was solo.  The Scream movies basically always operate the same way, with one being the stooge who gets convinced it's all about mimicking horror movies, and the mastermind who always has an ulterior motive related to Sidney's family.  They are literally *all* like that, with the only exception being 3, and even that the only variation was that they got rid of the stooge and kept the mastermind with a Prescott-related ulterior motive, so unfortunately, about the only thing Ghostface is really known for outside of the mask is being multiple killers a la Legion
---
And I think part of the reason they didn't do that is because, story-wise, a true to form Ghostface would basically be Legion, just what people initially thought Legion was going to be originally
---
Agreed. Killers already get the stunned motion and the stun sound the killers make. They do not need any extra indication that they have gotten stunned.
---
Beware of getting trapped in arguments with people I capable of hearing input and outputting anything meaningful based on information intake.
---
Gonna leave us hanging on the other 3 perks??
---
BBQ was in within the last month or 2 if I’m correct, and Ruin was in in February im pretty sure
---
Movement makes you easier to spot I've learned even just crouching in the open is better than trying to find cover.
---
As long as everyone is dead and you used only Leatherface's 3 personal perks, you should have gotten the achievement. This works even if there are disconnects.
---
Not really. Mind gaming is not that hard. Second hit is garaunteed if the survivor is not running iron will. Most spirits I play against run nurses to make sure you don't heal, and phase shift to a hook after unhook. Many streamers are also complaining that her output is too high for her low entry level.
---
Having comms is even better than godly. It gives you such a massive advantage against every killer in every situation. All survs know where the killer is/what they're doing, they can coordinate to always have 2 ppl minimum repairing, not waste time by deciding who's going for the unhooks, etc.; strategic slugging becomes useless too. And to be honest I don't think that's a bad thing. I truly believe most of the balancing issues of this game would be fixed if survivors got comms by default and THEN they balanced killers taking into account EVERY survivor team has comms.
---
Why would it get a buff? JW
---
That’s just how some games go, Sometimes everyone spawns at a generator and you’re distracted by someone “over there”, Generators completed* but they’re too far in comparison to this other guy you see. 
---
From what I noticed you should watch them, Some people clearly bait you into chasing, Others literally jump in the way and try to pull your attention. This is usually for a reason, Try to stay on the guy you’re chasing while hitting them away occasionally. You just need to try and keep up the pressure! Damage generators and if a chase is going on a bit longer than it should, Break off and check some generators.
---
Luck currently only impacts the chances of you escaping a bear trap or unhooking yourself from a hook. 
---
The luck increase is negligible though. For the highest rarity of luck offering, I believe it only increases all your chances by 3%. 
---
Base chance to escape a bear trap is 25%. It is now 28%
---
Base chance to unhook yourself is 4%. It is now 7%
---
Devs plan on expanding on luck and making it impact item chances from chests at one point. This was mentioned during a dev stream.
---
Any Shrine with PGTW is an okay Shrine
---
It's getting buffed, per the PTB:
---
&gt; Pop Goes The Weasel: Changed Regression values from 15%/20%/25% to a flat 25% across all tiers. Changed window of activation from 30 seconds to 40/50/60 seconds

---
Not really.........
---
I personally thing the survivor should have to look at ghost face as long as (maybe a bit less idk) he has to look at you.
---
This chapter having no survivor is... weird.
---
It's been changed from a flip phone to a Polaroid Camera.
---
Hes bugged right now. His power isnt working as its supposed to be. Its supposed to only take you out of it if a survivor turns their character to face you, not the camara, but its not working that way.
---
Yes he could even be called The Stalker
---
Legion was buffed for his full release
---
Lmfao!! Where’s all those memes about Ghostface being the better Legion at now? All this hype for a M1 killer with no actual power. They would of been better off just making him a new cosmetic for Legion lmao.
---
That guy don’t eat doughnuts, maybe a protein shake?
---
I understand this, but his current state is just so incredibly abysmal it hurts.
---
7 sEcONdS fEDoRa MaN bAd
---
They mentioned it during the anniversary stream
---
I would wait until they at least bug fix him and until live. Like both Spirt and Plague hes liekly going to be differet
---
Yes, they'll completely change how placing traps work for one Killer they're already stealing a ton of stuff for.
---
That will happen.
---
This is art
---
On a friggin' flip phone?
---
He's referring to the fact that, in your original comment, you said that the survivor's *head* needs to be facing towards the killer, which seems to imply that the character *model* needs to face him, when really you just need to rest your camera on him.
---
I heard that survivors need to look at him , and in this patch survivors head always look at the direction they're looking at . So in that sense moonwalking isn't needed
---
To be fair they might be quick to change Ghostface because he is a licensed killer and they do not want to disappoint the License owners by not making any sales with him. 
---
I suppose parallels can be thrown with Freddy but Freddy was somewhat decent with his original iteration so players bought him then they nerfed him. In this situation, its unlikely anyone will buy Ghostface because of how poor he is as a killer.
---
Might as well get Clown with shards. Bamboozle is a great perk in it's own way and even though I have major trouble playing as Clown I find his sound effects funny especially if I'm eating pallets.
---
Facts i'm disappointed with the camera
---
I mean...its supposed to be based if they look directly at  him with their character, not the camara. They can also change the range. 
---
Maybe even make it go away if you get withen like 5-10 meters or some other way for it to deplete, though it does have one cool thing where it shows someone who looks at you to you.
---
true xD
---
It will take less work for them to be places by his already existing left hand power thing.
---
Flip phones can have back and front camera it’s not mind blowing technology
---
I can quit crushing on Dwight now that there's a thick boy.
---
Yeah it's very difficult as killer if survivors play optimally. You have to hope they make mistakes and play stupid. If they don't there isn't much you can do honestly.
---
Konami is full of shit so no but BOY would I want it.
---
Nope.  No trophy.  I hate that about this game.  Get my hopes up only for them to be cruelly taken away.  🙁
---
There is no more scream either Neve Campbell said there won't be a 5th movie and that's it done especially with wes craven dead, Yet they got the license for ghostface (the TV series doesn't tie in with the movies.
---
Nurse hands down, very hard to play as, but when she's mastered she os by far the strongest killer.
---
Perks are kinda subjective, but there's a good all around build for nurse
---
BBQ&amp;Chilli (100% must use)
---
Hex: Ruin (not as needed as Nurse but very good standard killer perk)
---
A Nurse's Calling
---
The Fourth one is up to you (Good choices: Sloppy Butcher, Make Your Choice, NOED)
---
Yes and they know its not working properly. So we should wait to see what the bug fixes acaullty do to fix him. 
---
For all we know the entire thing is bugged. Maybe they arent supposed to hear his cloak sounds, maybe they need to stare at him for more then a second, maybe its supposed to last a short time after being seen. 
---
We dont know what the intent is compared to how buggy he is.
---
Dbd isn't that complex of a game. It's easy to tell what's strong or not very early.
---
And Pop can be better and more useful then Ruin.
---
The noob3 video makes it look like the duration you need to stare is pretty short and the distance you can be from him is pretty long. 
---
Would be funnier if you had to point emote at Ghostface to get him out of stalk
---
Nurse(PC), Spirit, Billy, Huntress, Hag.  
---
**Nurse build:**  
---
BBQ &amp; Chil, Whispers/Nurse's Calling,  Infectious Fright/Nurse's Calling, Shadowborn/Nurse's Calling.  
---
**Spirit build:**  
---
BBQ &amp; Chili, Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Ruin/Whispers.  
---
**Billy build:**  
---
BBQ &amp; Chili, Enduring, Whispers, Spirit Fury/Utility perk(like Agitation or Brutal Strength).  
---
**Huntress build:**  
---
BBQ &amp; Chili, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, Whispers.  
---
**Hag build:**  
---
BBQ &amp; Chili(mainly for BP)/Whispers, Haunted Ground/M&amp;A, Ruin/Corrupt Intervention, Make Your Choice/M&amp;A.  
---
Those are pretty general meta builds for the killers, but you need to experience them for yourself to make a personalized build.
---
I even had a DC in my match and I still got the Adept Freddy achievement. Are you sure you were using only Leatherface's three unique perks?
---
Yeah, it was just frustrating cause I clearly surprised the first guy I found on a gen and had him on the ground quick. 
---
Just a bad bit of luck I suppose with everyone being on a gen immediately, but me finding the loner on the other side of the map.
---
 Imagine doing a PTB for a new killer and his main way of activating his ability is majorly broken as if no one even tested it.
---
*Just BHVR stuff*  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
The gen z
---
Billy has a higher map pressure potential, but Spirit has a better pallet game if played correctly.
---
NOED already has plenty of counters.
---
Lmaoooooo
---
Yep. This is my reason behind understanding survivor perk nerfs over killer perk nerfs. Killers have a statistical disadvantage from the get go for the most part.
---
Because it fits his character more (the DBD Ghostface) as he is a journalist. Also phones in the 90s didn’t have front cameras... or cameras at all (idk I’m not an old man)
---
Spirit can’t be looped. 4 good survivors will have an easier time beating billy than spirit.
---
Camera is lame
---
I said it before I’ll say it again. 
---
Legion is a group of sadistic teenagers who just like hurting and killing people because it’s fun for them. 
---
Ghostface was some loser, sad because mommy and daddy got divorced and Sydney wouldn’t fuck him. 
---
Even if Ghostface wasnt completely useless in the game he’d still be the second rate Legion.
---
Are people really exaggerating this much? Literally no one uses it and there's a set min/max distance. It also, y'know, let's the killer see you too
---
Not to mention that even if you get a stalk off it only lasts for 20 seconds which is like, a window and a pallet. So you're not gonna be able to insta down very often unless you're really close to them when you stalk, in which case they'll definitely see you.
---
Currently the best killer in the entire game who is also the hardest to play is the Nurse. Her blinks give her massive mobility and allow her to totally remove loops from the game. 
---
Nurse best build; BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel &amp; Nurses Calling
---
Different builds for different people. BBQ is the best perk on Nurse or at least one of them. The other 3 perks work well on her. 
---
Could use other perks like Shadowborn for extra FOV, Infectious Freight for slugging survivors, Surveillance to have gen monitoring etc.
---
Merciless killer got reworked, it now requires a double pip to get a merciless killer, so you need to double pip using the 3 teachable perks of a killer.
---
Wait so what's his name in game ghost face?
---
I’ve had those looping games. Ugh. Nothing makes you feel worse about yourself than realizing you’ve been chasing the same survivor for 4 gens.
---
That really sucks, in all honesty. Survivor should have to look at the killer for at least a few seconds.
---
Well that’s the bug isn’t it? you can rest the camera on him regardless of your character’s eyes physically looking at him. You can spin the camera around the stationary model to trip his power when your supposed to stare at him, as in focus the survivors towards him. 
---
Am I interpreting this wrong? Because if so that’s ideally how he should work.
---
Also, another thing, I heard on the forums that the through walls thing is definitely not intended, but apparently the downed/on hook thing *is* intended.
---
Yup and I hope they punish you for it
---
Wes Craven was doing the Scream series. 
---
That’s a whole different matter then the legal actions with Silent Hill as well!
---
Hag also has a big learning curve but is very strong if you know what you're doing
---
As the survivor or the spirit? Because some people are just too dumb for that.
---
Exactly but we should still speak up just in case that is what’s supposed to happen but they found out when it’s used in real game it’s a mess.
---
Can you imagine being this entitled as a survivor holy shit? 😂😂😂
---
F
---
Spirit can be looped, she is fully reliant on making the correct play, which doesn't always result in the spirit winning, Billy can 1 shot, Spirit can't. Billy has map pressure, Spirit has to choose between chase or map pressure with her power.
---
Well thats true i guess. I would still wait until they fix it to work how its meant to
---
Oof, I only started playing again ~3 weeks ago.
---
I don’t think you understand. 
---
Against a good spirit there is nothing you can do. And ending chases faster &gt; map pressure. Good survivors don’t let you one shot lmao.
---
Wasn't the shape a great killer too because he is my main killer
---
The only special thing about this is that you're doing it with a control
---
I put him at 6 on my tier list. 
---
He’s balanced. Not top, not bottom. Higher mid tier.
---
Good day to be an OoO main.
---
I mean, it's gonna get changed of course, but until them.
---
Though I can see it receiving a buff, I'm sure the devs didn't intend for killers to use it EVERY time they downed a survivor, otherwise it may have as great of a snowball effect for fast killers as BBQ and Chili 2.0
---
You want to make it so that ghostface can stare at you and down you in one hit without anything the survivors can do about it. Correct me if I misunderstood.
---
They also said that it was outdated and they would look into changing it.
---
Not when ghostface was popular. Or at least when the first scream came out. But sure whatever. I do like the phone better than the camera.
---
This would match the change for character heads to now face the same direction as the camera. It's plausible considering how buggy new killers are known to be on release.
---
Spirit, Nurse, and Billy. Hands down and I. That order. Nurse WOULD be in first slot but since so many people don’t know how to play her properly she’s second slot. I’m just glad she has so many power add on Debuffs because otherwise she would be a damn god. 
---
I’ve been saying since Spirit came out that the game has changed and that she’s a little too OP, in my opinion. And just fuck Billy.
---
I'd be inclined to say Ghostface.
---
The idea of someone watching you for weeks, meticulously noting your behavioural patterns, and attacking you at your weakest, in your own home is an eerie concept.
---
Sm$?qm_$'120
---
The Doctor. 
---
If he caught you you would be in a nightmare of a time feeling the electricity going through your body. Also since he liked to torture his victims rather then kill right away.
---
Just feeling that every inch of electricity going through your body and not knowing whether you will live or die.
---
Luckily yes you can be banned
---
What??
---
Oh nvm your trying to advertise your shitty stream
---
Could you risk deranking like this though?
---
Because I said Nurse and Billy, then you come along and correct me with a damn (*) and seem to not even accept the IDEA that billy could be better than the spirit.
---
Because he’s not
---
?????
---
Millennial spotted
---
99%?
---
I don't understand what happens in 1 can someone explain
---
You can't hide Monto!
---
How so? This is were you post clips lmao. Did I kill you in a game or something and your mad about it?
---
Even with that fixed, he's still god awful - he needs a huge buff or a rework, it would be so much more exciting if such an iconic character could turn out to be on the same level as nurse/Billy, would make the meta more interesting as well
---
edit: oh my god nevermind he's so bad
---
You feel Myers Evil Within to 99% so that way you can tier up very quickly.
---
No, the survivor who actually spotted ghost face should be immune to stalking for an extended period of time.
---
now that looks interesting
---
Jesus that’s terrifying:’D
---
I prefer the camera. It also has a flash that creates a cool effect in dark areas.
---
And he had 2000+ hours??????? Has he never played a myers with at least 2 iq?
---
theres only 1 killer too
---
Is this guy for real?  He seems kind of OP.
---
Supposedly he is a myers main.
---
Noed,  deerstalker, Nurse's Calling... Why would they dc against a fun killer like you? A complete shocker. /s
---
The problem is that if we have two other killers that share a similar name, Wraith and Spirit. Add the Ghost into the mix and translations would be a total pain in the ass. 
---
“Who’s the killer?”
---
“Ghost”
---
“Which one?”
---
“Yknow, the Ghost.”
---
“No, which one? The one with bells, the one that sounds like Waluigi blowing his load, or the one with the mask?”
---
“Mask.”
---
Thank goodness. Kate main here and the sunglasses head was one I was never sold on because the hair just looked so disgustingly greasy, but in the ptb it looked amazing.
---
Not real i'm afraid.
---
I still believe he should have been able to hide in closets instead. Jump out with a burst of speed to injure survivors. If someone tries to open the one he’s in, they’re instantly caught. A much more unique and in-character ability that forces players to adapt in new ways.
---
Poor Sharp Hand Joe :’P
---
That's pretty neat.
---
yeah I feel it in my brain.. “camp them camp them “ came to mind like orders from god himself
---
This looks like a circle jerk to me.
---
Why you posting this clip??
---
It contributed nothinf to this community
---
How did you do it?
---
That and I miss his simple black outfit.
---
Shouldn't it be 2.8.0?
---
MoM is not gone in fact it was buffed. you were probably going to go for unhooks anyways since if you get found on the way to the killer you got stacks anyways. now you can just unhook and unless the killer tunnels which you can easily avoid by running BT and then you get stacks it's disgusting that the devs think this is how you balance a perk
---
no idea, my friend did it
---
A merciful soul
---
;-;
---
Yeah, Furtive Chase would be very interesting if it simply reduced the terror radius and would be fun to pair with M&amp;A.
---
So Ghostface comes with no survivor? Not even a Sydney? Halloween gets Laurie, but Scream doesn't get Sydney TF? At the very least this guy deserves to be added as part of the package, just out of fan demand. If he requires time to be added/worked on I'm hoping the community is almost as patient as it is loud.
---
This actually makes sense based on what I know of the games equations for creating matches, I just didn’t know it could go above what we thought was the limit
---
I like Ash, but I've had a bunch of Ash players DC after I've gotten a quick two hit in on them.
---
Just look at the fucking toaster of flip phone he has in the picture. As someone else already said, back in the days (of the movies) there were no front cameras  in those phones.
---
Yep! It's nice.
---
Maybe your chases don’t take that long. I spend 90% of my time playing survivor so I’m pretty garbage at ending chases
---
Aura reading perks do the same thing as seeing him.
---
The camera is lore friendly and looks good.
---
nice been wanting that perk for a while
---
Fun. Is. Fun.
---
wait really!?!?!? Dam.
---
Looks like The Shape and Pig failed as parents.
---
He was still pretty shitty and only dominated when sweaty exploits were employed. He sucked at doing his job of chaining hits on multiple survivors if they all spread out and looped his ass and his only advantage was tunneling behavior. BHVR was told this during the PTB and they tweaked his kit slightly but they did not overhaul him till much later.
---
I think we all knew he wasn’t gonna be that good, just not this bad
---
I'd be ok with the Ghostface I guess. The space between Ghost and Face really bugs me though lol
---
Are you kidding me? 1 chase for me = 3 gens for the survivor.
---
Just watched a ton of SAW kill counts last night lol
---
2 weeks is nothing in dev time. 
---
Maybe they can tweak it a bit, but remember how long it's taken them to fix freddy.
---
He is bugged btw, not sure if this perk is on the list of his buggs, but he has some major ones so i wouldnt be surprised if it was.
---
Yes
---
yes, you opt into the steam beta for the game once you have it in your library
---
Dang that’s 20 big ones 😢
---
Im still chuckling about it. I really wish i had screenshoted it. There was a long conversation of me explaining how the 99% works, and he did not beleive me.
---
I'd pay for him in an instance.
---
I always give a hatch when I play killer to assert my dominance.
---
Darn, i wanna try ghost face so bad!
---
Who is this guy seems like a cunt
---
The best part was i only tiered up twice that match.
---
u/brokeazzkid
---
What kind of stupid quedtion is this??
---
This is like asking if you can try the ptb in overwatch or for literally any other game
---
Lol aren’t you the guy that whines about a twitch chat being toxic
---
Actually it does a ton against normal killers, knowing that the killer is looking towards you is a ton of info. You may be in his terror radius but if he is not looking towards you chances are you can stick to the genny or totem
---
I heard he's broken atm so probably for the better
---
Spirit I'm. Or Freddy, since I enjoy sleeping.
---
You contribute nothing to the community, the dev stream was literally full of funny bug moments and other funny moments clipped by people lmao. Do you even play DBD? Ask most huge twitch streamers how they got big, yeah most of them got big because of clips from their stream, hoe else would they be discovered by people lmfao?...
---
Nvm just found out you are joking, your whole reddit feed is being toxic even saying "get outa here with this postivity rofl" yeah you are either joking or a really toxic person that no one likes. I hope you are joking, for your sake of having a friend one day.
---
That's actually hardwired into humans as a fear. That's why we're afraid of spiders lol
---
They make majority of their money from cosmetics, they’d never go first person. I’d hate playing that way anyways
---
it’s a video game, selfies weren’t even a thing from the timeline ghostface comes from, so the fact he’s doing it it’s pretty weird in the first place
---
Ya, they need to make his being looked at mechanic less OP.  
---
  
---
Like have it more like a meter, and the closer he is to the middle of of the screen, the faster the meter rises, when the meter is full the skill is canceled.  
---
The point is that they have to actually look at you directly to cancel it fast, otherwise it will take a while and he might get his ability off.  
---
Otherwise can't you completely cancel is ability by just spinning the camera? GJ BHVR you invented a completely useless power...
---
It does that for a while until you can establish a lobby. Maybe your ping is really bad?
---
From the minute I heard what his power was I knew he wouldn't add much to the game but he seemed like he would be fun to play :/
---
His Power gets cancelled as soon as someones cameras hovers over him
---
Yea, the Public/Player Test Build. The devs should still be testing out their changes in house before releasing them. However with Ghost Face it’s pretty clear they did little to no testing whatsoever and just released him out of development blindly.
---
Head on works in a strange way but it's consistent, it doesn't actually matter where the killer is when you do the jump animation, if the killer is in front of the locker when you press the button they're "marked" for the stun, after the animation ends they are stunned, and they get stunned no matter where they are or ran to, and the killer can still do actions before the stun happens, so they can swing at the closet and hit you as you come out, the animation finishes, and then they get stunned
---
I have the game in my library from the free weekend, so i thought i could try the beta for free. Really sucks, i just wanna try ghost but I really don’t wanna spend 20 bucks just for the ptb
---
Hopefully it will take a sudden turn for the awesome after the PTB
---
Bad would be an understatement. Freddy in his current state is stronger than Ghostface.
---
Okay, who is Carl the cashier?
---
They got famous for beeing a good person or funny, and sharing funny clips, but this clip doesnt have anything funny and if you think it does you have to revaluate whats funny to tou
---
Also stalking my profile is hilarious, you cant come with a good comeback soo you rely on that rofl thats sad, no wonder no one watches your streams
---
If it was a flat terror radius reduction, it would pair horribly with M&amp;A since Monitor decreases it outside of a chase and **Increases** it in one. Pairing it with a perk that does nothing but decrease TR in a chase is a waste of a perk slot.
---
and they were correct.
---
True. But considering what’s happened with the last two.....
---
But is that the right option?
---
I think so. Not everyone can get 3, and if you think about it each player can get 6 max unhooks if and only if they are the only person saving. Protective hits are also pretty difficult to get. This seems like a fair trade off instead of automatically getting it at a certain point for no reason. Also survivors now have the benefit of Adrenaline + MoM if a killer is running NOED so it’s a win for survivors too.
---
exactly that
---
No worries mate lol. It's a new addition with this PTB. We couldn't do it before
---
Both!
---
Yes.
---
I don't know. I didn't study for this. I feel overwhelmed
---
.........damn.
---
Ah so that might be it,  I also  believe it should get bumped up to 4 so you can't just farm a single teammate to get MOM.
---
and they were correct
---
This makes me happy. Much needed buff 🤠
---
Whenever an unneeded change is added the answer 9 times out of 10 is always "to aid survivors". Killers for sure didn't ask for this nonsense. The devs are low skilled rank 15 survivor mains, so always keep in mind that how they view the game is now how any skilled player views the game. In their minds, getting stunned at the pallet wasn't enough to aid survivors in a chase, the killer also needs to see a flash of red.
---
Ik but i’m the asshole who has a console and just wants to try GF. 😖
---
Survivor red stain lol
---
Thrilling Terrors is a decent perk in concept I believe it should have longer active time shorter cooldown otherwise being able to see gens currently being worked on is useful.
---
This is a fair point; I havent given it much thought in the grand scope of the whole team except what I put in the OP. But it makes sense, now survivors almost have to fight and earn the ability to use it at all.
---
I think this means they can balance ds and others to give less stun time because the stuns are consistent to all killers now... at least I hope
---
Spirit. That's how ez it is to mind game. Stand still, people will think you are phasing and jump to you.
---
The problem with spirit is that the way you "out play" her is by walking away while she phases. Usually that means there won't be enough distance between you and the killer when the spirit gets to where you last seen her, for you to get to a loop, so that first hit will be very fast, unless you are already in a loop. The second hit doesn't matter if you are in a loop or not. If the spirit has headphones, the second hit is free.
---
Imo nurse is high risk, high reward.  If she messes up her blink, she will have a delay, cool down, and low visibility. Spirit has a similar high reward, but if she messes up or gets outplayed, there is not really must punishment other than having to m1 the nearby survivor.
---
We already have no blink Nurse though :P
---
At first people joked about how he was more underpowered than Freddy. They nerfed him into the dirt a few weeks later because people complained that he was broken. They weren't correct.
---
Reading the notes, it looks like it's just the camera, although it had to be for a second and you also have to be actually looking at him.
---
This addon does NOT reduce the distance at which survivors can spot you. 
---
If you are far away enough from a survivor that spots you, you will gain direction indicators telling you where that survivor is.
---
This addon merely reduces the minimum distance you have to be from survivors to get that distance indicator.
---
Unfortunately, only the drivers license addon reduces the distance in which survivors can spot you.
---
Just wish he was properly licensed. :( They won't use Sidney, any maps from Scream, the backstory, or even a power reminescent of the movie. It'll just be a skin.
---
Stealth killers hook camping is a dbd tradition, we can't take that away smh
---
so fucking hot
---
As someone who got DDOS'd today i personally have no issue with showing people these sort of cunts' names but i'd take a look at rule number 3 :)
---
They said Ghostface is only spotted if within a certain radius of the survivor.
---
I think you should get the PC, that seems to be the best choice.
---
Not when you have wall hacks as wraith or myers uwu
---
Ow. My pride...
---
You're being downvoted for speaking the truth. Legion for LIFE!
---
Fight survive the trial...
---
LOL did you forget the part where he was the only killer you saw and everyone was screaming for a nerf?
---
I mean, you CAN, but you need to give extra advantages to the killer top make him stealthier.  
---
EX: make him harder to see the further he is. Make the fog worse for the survivors than for the killer, so the killer can see, but it's harder for the survivors to see. give the survivors more realistic movements, have turning around not be an instant thing. Have limited camera turning based on the direction the body is facing.  
---
There's plenty of things they can do to make stealth more viable, but they don't want to, because the engine probably wasn't designed with it in mind, so it might not even be possible to do.
---
I'm aware of that rule and in any other circumstance I would 100% agree but the fact is that if he was here before bragging about it, thr Devs did nothing. This shit is not fucking ok.
---
Wow. I don't have enough shards to get all of these lol. Guess its decision time (but prob BBQ and DS)
---
By not posting useless clips of yourself
---
Just stick with fortnite, at least you get some views that way
---
Nothing, you just have to use the perk by hitting the killer in the forehead.
---
HEAD ON! APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD!
---
thats how I felt after finding out his best Power is the insta teabag
---
I highly recommend a body pillow if you sleep on your side. It's really comfortable! Been using one bought from IKEA for years now :)
---
Also no cellphone.
---
It's a shitty 35mm camera.
---
Carl had so much potential. Unlike Ghost Face.
---
Conveniently this just happened to me for the first time. Has BHVR said anything about the issue?
---
Are they really going with the name "The Ghost Face"?
---
Given the mechanics (or at least how they're supposed to work) wouldn't "The Stalker" be more appropriate?
---
Sandbagging already barely happens.  I really couldn't see a group of random people who don't know each other unanimously agreeing to fuck with someone. The fact that SWF can already do this really means there's no problem with adding it in.
---
This is gonna be the first dlc I will not be buying.
---
Shit killer, shit perks. Waste of money if they don't reworked everything majorly before release.
---
Stabby McStabberton.
---
What in the hell just happened? I had Cannibal selected as my killer. It throws me in a game as Freddie and says I'm playing the Trapper.
---
I'm not sure where I can address this. While most of the hair changes they've made (Feng, Kate, Nea) are good, Claudette's are not good at all. The texture changes make her purple, red, and black hair with glasses bobs too flat and thin, looking nowhere near as good as how they are now. I don't think they should make this change. It doesn't frame her face well and looks awful. When I spend money on something I expect it to stay at least roughly the same even if textures are updated. It looks completely different.
---
*the
---
I just want pinhead to be in the game lol
---
Neither if you want to be liked
---
Clown playing as Leatherface Playing as Freddy playing as The Trapper
---
But can we go deeper..
---
It's because of the splinter offering you played. There are a ton of different ones for DLC killers. You play the splinter and you can play the next round as the killer it's for. It's a way for people to test killers out before they buy them.
---
*The Ghost Face.
---
Quick Note: The Priestess is a plague barren character which spews vile fluids from her mouth.
---
The plague in this case represents religion.
---
Perfect. So no need to level a character after all teachables earned if I don't play them and no risk getting to level 50 before getting all other teachables.
---
..... Smh
---
Vs Ghosty aka Ghostfaces offbrand cousin. And no not you Frank!
---
It will start on June 18th &amp; last until July 2nd.
---
This is pretty good. I'm honestly kinda jealous. I dont play DBD on PS4 but I would totally use this
---
 
---
* Fixed an issue that caused the Entity gargle noises to remain on the hooks when a Survivor was unhooked.
---
This is the real winner here. I'd take this over any killer release. As someone who turns there headphones up loud to hear survivors... thank the Entity.
---
nah nah nah, we should have to emote at him, by pointing.
---
Yeah, your right, sorry.
---
It's kinda bugged rn tho
---
Someone hasn’t been watching actual gameplay of the PTB.
---
[Like this?](https://i.redd.it/4kx89gvtm0131.jpg)
---
Wow just as I was planning to buy clown, thanks for saving me 7 bucks
---
It's also kinda annoying that you have to be in the killers terror radius and not in a chase
---
nah, that guy eats nothing but fucking steak and pork
---
“It’s only game, why you have to be mad?”
---
Your gatekeeping of 'appropriate' perks might have been relevant if they hadn't all DCed the moment they heard the nurse's teleporting sound. And are you suggesting it's ok to DC if you get butthurt about peoples' perk choices?
---
I agree. Having someone run you away from the gens as an M1 killer is shitty, and you have to choose between a down and protected gens
---
With the teleport, you can go for the down, and then teleport back to the gens. You can also use the gen and hook placement to snowball pressure. Not as good as hag, but not as bad as half the killers. 
---
It also helps with make your choice, surveillance, and discordance.
---
Are you aware of how old millenials are?
---
Technically doing a daily with a killer I rarely play with shitty perks
---
Enduring nerf honestly pisses me off
---
Also I know someone already made a meme in this format with Leatherface a few months back, but fuck it, I'm still gonna make this meme.
---
But yeah, Ghostface is unfortunately kinda crappy so once he comes out I'll probably just get the Thrilling Tremors teachable and be done with him.
---
You just repeated what he said.
---
the ptb is what prospectively the beginning of it, and desync has LONG been an issue for the game
---
The first sign that they fucked up was replacing the CELL PHONE mori with a damn disposable camera. His entire gimmick had to do with phones and they completely scrapped it for.. reasons I guess
---
Salty lad, probably a survivor main that complains if you die
---
It's not useless, but yes Ghost Face's stalking ability should've been more functional before PTB
---
Thanks. Had no clue what was going on.
---
I mean, the point of testing is to find bugs, but I agree that this seems like something they should have caught even before the PTB release.
---
No problem. I have no idea why it says Trapper though off to the side. That one's probably just a bug.
---
Pig, Doctor and Legion are still the worst killers, it's all good.
---
that is NOT a gamer build
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
&gt; far from guaranteed to even activate
---
If you're an M1 Killer without an instadown it is 100% guaranteed to activate. Even if you tunnel off the hook every time it'll still activate on their second unhook. The only counter was to camp one hook state or tunnel with a Mori. Or Rancor.
---
And both of them aren't even the original character designs
---
K.i.s.s
---
Legion for example.
---
He has increased speed &amp; agility. Can chase down survivors quicker while using his power, and also vault quicker. Plus he can track with his power and also wastes survivors time by making them mend. 
---
So much going on with his power...yet hes not that strong. Just imagine if the devs focused on just 1 or 2 of the four attributes I mentioned....instead of all 4. Legion could have been a simpler and strong killer. Rather than a mediocre killer who was annoying to play against.
---
...Wow. You know what? I love that. I'm a killer main and I seriously adore the idea. Applause for your creativity as well
---
If you really don't want VC, disable it.
---
I also don't see why pausing midgame is so bad. It would take maybe a couple seconds max. It's not like survivors are the ones pressured for time.
---
and thats when they announce theyre dropping dbd to fully focus on deathgarden
---
The more complicated the power and harder to use well, the higher the skill ceiling will be. Additionally, dumbed down powers get boring over time but content like this will stay fresh longer.
---
I'd definitely would wear this awesome concept!
---
u/ZombieHuggerr have you done this template yet?
---
What does that even mean
---
it means its not a gamer build bro
---
People arguing over whether or not a flip phone in a video game can have a camera? Alright. Phone makes more sense for the mori and looks better to me.
---
&gt;OoO will become meta until Ghost fades from popularity
---
So 3 days to a week?
---
thanks genius, Most of these issues people are mocking should have been caught before it was rolled out to the PTB. PTB is for collecting data to make tweaks and adjustments before release or to catch hard to find issues. PTB means it's nearly ready for release, you telling me this is nearly ready for release? PTB is not for finding out basic core game play mechanics of the character are broken. That's tests job, I mean.. unless you enjoy paying BVHR for the privileged of testing and finding their broken shit. I guess you can add game tester to your resume now since feel like they fired their test team or just have their devs "test it" with a "works on my machine" as a Ship it criteria. 
---
 It shows you how little time or care they actually put into this shit and why some bugs have been around for years and new ones consistently pop up. More concerned with rolling out a switch port nobody asked for, cosmetics and DLC to sell then making sure they're shipping quality to their customers. This low effort failure is pretty much par for the course for BVHR.
---
I 100% agree. Her new hair looks so thin and looks bad from the front. Just doesn't make sense to me why they would change that hairstyle out of all of her hair.
---
Legion was bottom tier that didn't stop them from basically nerfing him Into a M1 killer
---
so I don't think BHVR cares all that much about tierlists
---
 But that doesn’t tie in with the lore. Plus, the mask is what they have the license for. They want to use it.
---
Bubba - BBQ &amp; Chili.  
---
Spirit - Spirit Fury +  she's fun to play.  
---
Hag - great hex perks + fun to play.  
---
Myres - the most fun M1 killer.  
---
For survivor, you only need David - WGLF.
---
Myers’s EW ain’t simple, yet Myers is the best designed killer this game has to offer
---
If you're on PC (can't speak for console) prepare for a lot of random disconnects *just* when you start having fun in a match.
---
Yeah it was the wrong thing to say. Edited it. My apologies.
---
Spirit was bottom of the barrel too on her PTB. That's literally why they do a PTB. People are overreacting ffs.
---
Absolute legend.
---
Tweet this at the developers or something right now
---
that's actually carl in disguise
---
I want to like Ghostface so bad
---
They should provide a fucking cinematic replay camera in the top right corner of the screen, detailing the intricate play by play of the stun. Would be great.
---
Thanks again
---
Can someone tell me what BHVR means... Probably a dumb question.
---
not a rework, an update
---
the power remained the same they just changed a few aspects about it
---
What's "fun"?
---
&gt;h direction they are looking now? A killer will now be able to tell where someone's camera is and be able to ambush  or mind game better.ReplyshareSaveedit  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;level 5typervader2Original Poster5 points · 7 hours agoYes. Survivors have to be looking directly at him with their camara.
---
Haha, I tried OOO on him and it disables his power the whole time, I think.
---
I never get tired of Billy or Huntress. Two of the simplest and most effective powers in the game. Same for Spirit. What's refreshing is a decently strong killer, thats fun to play as and fun to play against.
---
I dont see how a rehashed Myers with more restrictions and complications to his power is going to "stay fresh longer". Esp when its easy to beat and boring to play against.
---
I dont see what they can do to GhostFace current power without making him more of a Myers copy.
---
It's still pretty long I think.
---
If you don't mind playing with just friends (or people you meet), you can have fun and use whatever perk or item or add on you want in Kill Your Friends mode.
---
cool idea but its basically as viable as camping, staying in one spot is never a good idea for killer
---
The best thing about this killer is this trash perk :/
---
Jazz Hands
---
Does ghost face have a cute stun noise? Didn't think so
---
*its
---
"If you were from where I'm from, you'd be \*BEEP\* dead!"
---
Min's hair as well.
---
Right
---
Id say its pretty simple. Tier up...get stronger and faster. Thats as simple as it gets in my book. 
---
GhostFace adds in conditions with getting detected....only have specific survivors exposed...more audio cues...etc. Theres more going on that doesnt help the killer.
---
Some wear jumpsuits.
---
Do you have any pics of Nea’s green hair?
---
He'll be great when he's no longer bugged. Right now he's the worst killer in the game.
---
Ebony mori is overpowered and has no place in this game.
---
I dunno, that seems like a you kinda deal. Are you into asymmetrical game play? Hide and seek, or chase games? 
---
If you didn't like it much last time, I'm not sure if you'll like it any better. Maybe see if anyone has it so you can play it and see how you like it?
---
If you're on Xbone, I believe it's on GamePass.
---
Ok. So purchasing things with IS does nothing?
---
Splitting the community is a big reason lots of games go into decline. So, yeah, bad fix.
---
There are actually 2 clown mains,  they found your pathetic attempt at an insult absolutely hilarious.   Yankee doodle....
---
Mike's arms look really short lol
---
Nah. Frame rate is too high.
---
I can't seem to tally how many hours I have on the game (PS4), but I know I'm about 50 hours in, and I'm just passed half way to Lvl 40.  Not only does it take a while to actually connect to a match, but I seem to get wrecked when I'm playing against a killer with all purple perks, and survive when I face a killer without any. I regularly earn over 6k as survivor if I'm not the first one dead.
---
I've had mixed results with killers, sometimes dominating, sometimes getting trounced, but I regularly get over 12k.
---
From what I'm hearing those aren't terrible earnings... but I'm still suck trudging through a terribly designed progression system that mixes disposable items and perks? Cuts you off from earning perks if the black sludge decides to start at that end of the web?
---
And some of the teachable perks are so good I'm seeing people almost universally use them when they get them... but won't have access to them myself until I put in another 200 hours?
---
it should be
---
wraith
---
myers
---
pig
---
ghostface
---
cause ghostface has elements of all the prior
---
Myers stalking and instadown capability
---
Pig's crouching
---
Wraith's alerting of survivors when he goes stealth
---
How is adding voice chat splitting the community?
---
sounds about right
---
It's the average 12 seconds
---
This is oddly specific OP
---
We are getting maps according to the dev stream. They are just not going to have any new assets for it. They are going to be new variations of the School map.
---
You actually didn't give any tips on how the game would be balanced around people being able to communicate, so... did you read your own post?
---
I like how you made a post complaining about how he is when numerous people have said it's bugged. I mean, why waste your time? All you do is froth up the reeeee-ers and clog up the subreddit.
---
yeah
---
it was funny. Cause he does the selfie on his mori. You guys can't take a joke.
---
Yeah they did
---
Laurie’s hair is the result of 2016 modelling.  Her hair is the worst by far, she can probably stab the killer with it for DS with how stiff it is
---
Post all the hair ones ?
---
Meg's loose hair also looks a lot better, she's got some individual strands going on as well
---
When you’re literally rude for no reason, I hope this made you feel better because I’m sure I’m not the only one who doesn’t bother to read it. &gt;:(
---
I've always wanted a killer that could travel from locker to locker.
---
Myers exposed effect lasts much longer and effects the entire team, sure it takes longer but its way more effective a master myers can do a much better job than a master ghostface can do
---
I agree for the most part. When it takes a short essay to describe a power, it is too complicated. I am not saying there can’t be elements or some complexity, but when you need to scroll down twice to read how the power works, it’s too much.
---
And how would that work with looping? Either broken or they'll have no power in chases.
---
Or jeepers creepers guy..
---
&gt;One time the only offering was a shroud of binding and the survivors still left because they thought it was a spooky scary mori.
---
I just had the mental image of a killer dodging out of muscle memory because he thought a survivor brought a Mori. My sides hurt.
---
Just saw the trailer. I imagine it's not his worst experiance working retail. I mean sure he died, but at least he got off work early.
---
Possibly let him teleport from locker to locker? Just spitballing here.
---
Oof what a long post. If you look at my previous reply, you'll see I said they should've fixed that before the PTB. Yes, they are obviously probably rushing the release of this killer due to it's hype. That is all.
---
Sorry I deleted/edited my response because I realized you said either all SWF or all soloQ.
---
Someone show bhvr immediately
---
For map movement. Landing back on the ground would stun then for around 3 seconds or so?
---
Yeah no. People are still going to be playing Nurse and no one in their right mind is going to run OoO against Nurse. OoO becoming meta is about as likely as the Crapper getting added to the game.
---
No you need to double pip now to get the achievements, so you NEED merciless. Trust me, I’ve been doing the killer adept achievements recently and they’re a pain in the ass. Got 5 4ks with Myers before getting the achievement on him because I didn’t have enough points in other categories.
---
The counter you just mentioned is like someone telling  you that the way to counter the hillbilly is moving to the side
---
Lmao this is my PS background too, got it off this sub a couple months ago.
---
Not a huge fan of this meme, but I gotta say these are some legitimately great perks and I would hands down become a Carl main.
---
Bruh he's been out for less than a day, and he's nearly fatally bugged. Don't try to say that with assuredness yet lmfao
---
Making separate posts.  Sorry.
---
At least he can tbag better than Amanda
---
As Ginger Minj as Danny Devito as Michelle Visage
---
*...crap wrong sub*
---
Nice to know.
---
Devs are fucking terrible at their own game as can be easily proven by footage, so they design every new killer/perk assuming everyone else is too. CMV.
---
God this sub really is shit
---
Wait the min the one on the left can't be right!!! The survivor is already looking at him with it's 3d camera angle!!!
---
So they have no power in chases.  
---
The only good killers have power in chases - Billy, Nurse, Spirit, Huntress, and Hag all have a great chasing ability.
---
What’s couple of others are saying is wrong. You need a double pip (merciless victory). It doesn’t matter if you kill all four, you still need to double pip. I hope they rework the killer achieves because they’re very unfair right now. Good luck with it though.

You could make the case that Hag traps don't really put it in your face to crouch or flashlight them though
---
Clown is simple, bad and boring all in one. 
---
Same with LF
---
I think he gets covered in an Aura of Darkness making it very hard to see him even if he wears brightly lit cosmetics
---
Agree. Ignoring discord in SWF just puts solo players at a disadvantage and prevents proper balance for both killers and survivors. 
---
This is the reason why killers say survivors are OP and solo survivors say killers are OP
---
First off, I just can't comprehend what "Because people will just use discord to get around the balance" would even mean. My whole point was to add voice chat, so that you don't need discord.
---
Second, If i really wanted to, i might be able to conceptualize some balances that could be added afterwards, but the point of the post is voice chat, not the balance afterwards. If I had to think of some ideas, just balance the killer as if every group of players is SWF. Make certain perks stronger, make powers stronger. What these changes are I will leave to the professional game developers.
---
Thought about it, but my 3 year old LOVES Trapper. She saw the Tattoo and started singing his theme.
---
Is no one gonna mention the comment about waluigi blowing his load?
---
All are worth getting.  And if you’re on gamepass you already have spark of madness and flesh of mud
---
So basically Nurse
---
You can look it up as well... Find us a single flip phone from 1990 that has a front-facing camera.
---
Honestly that's how I feel. Ever since the Freddy review bomb debacle the dev's have been afraid of kicking the survivor main hornet's nest so we end up with subpar killer powers and shitty perks as a result.
---
You're gonna have to explain that. Also, do teachable versions of perks level up to higher tiers, or are they limited?
---
I think the only  lisenced killer that was even decent in release was pretty much Myers if I remember. Everyone else got buffed and and nerfs overtime. Though for freddy on the other hand, well he is going to be the next tier.
---
As a huge Evil Dead fan this change really makes me happy as it's now more inline with Ash's character. MoM user will now have to take risks to get it.
---
mom said it's my turn to get in the locker
---
As someone who works in the fast food industry...I relate to Carl on a spiritual level
---
Why not make those in one post?
---
They talked about this in a dev stream. One that could fly or climb walls. They said they tried it out but it did my work with the game mechanics. 
---
But then they made Nurse...
---
I just got into the series, Season 2 and I love every moment XD
---
But I agree, it does require the survivor to actually DO something now.
---
DS was changed so it’s not as effective, feelsbadman
---
Shame on me!
---
Probably came too close to Scream copyrights by involving a phone with Ghostface.
---
Because I made this post before BHVR said anything about it being a bug? And honestly like I’ve said even though the 360 spinning isn’t intended, which is great, being able to cancel his power by “staring at him for a second” will still be pretty damn weak.
---
Oh I see. Since he has to use these photos in his articles, he’s using something more powerful and high quality since phones at the time were like potatoes.
---
No, he really doesn’t. He needs the bugs he has fixed and the shroud to act like tier 1 Myers and then he’s golden. The only problem that he has with his power that is intended is that survivors can run certain perks that basically neuter him. It’s a simple buff. The man doesn’t need a complete rework, his power just revolves around getting the scoop on survivors but at the moment there’s too many factors that make this too difficult.
---
Real talk though this perk is old surveillance levels of uselessness
---
Its cool. I'd agree with you if I was saying to balance SWF and solo differently.
---
I’m really, really inefficient.
---
Yea decently sure, never tried tho
---
Remapped crouch to “v”. 
---
No longer press control. 
---
Problem solved.
---
Ok.
---
Oh really? That's cool! Yeah the gamepass list it as the special edition but didn't really say what extra stuff was included so good to know.
---
Oh. Thanks. :)
---
It probably will
---
Lvl 40 is the level where you get all teachable. It’s best to just main 1 character and level others for perks. 
---
All perks only can go to T3 (tier 3) T3 is showed by 3 Lines.
---
I mean that is literally how you counter Myers. If you see him go behind cover and then stealth away. It applies to Ghostface even more because his stalk will gradually go away if he's not staring at you.
---
It does take a bit longer to connect to PS4 matches from experience. Having good perks definitely matters, but so does the player behind them. The rank you're matching against can sometimes be a good measurement of skill if the ranks haven't been reset recently.
---
I consider myself an average player, maintaining around rank 10 as a survivor. As a survivor, I'm generally earning around 11-15K bloodpoints a match, 19-20+ if I had a good game and escaped. As a killer, I was getting 18-20Kish a match on PS4, and closer to my surivor BP on PC. I'm also completing the daily challenges, which give a nice chunk of bloodpoints.
---
I like the bloodweb. If there's a perk I want, I grab it first so it doesn't get locked. Then I go for items/offerings I want. I get and use a lot of bonus bloodpoint offerings to help boost the earn rate.
---
I don't mean to be rude and judge your skill level in the game (since you said you're new in your post), so my suggestions would be: try to learn better strategies, make sure you're doing dailies, always take items, addons, and offerings. Personally, I think it's easier to get more bloodpoints as a killer, but you also have to spend bloodpoints on the ones you play to unlock items and perk slots as well.
---
Hey it counters Big Brain Quick and Quiet Meg mains :^)
---
Ghostface is G tier
---
Thank you! Said it more concise than I could.
---
How do you fix this on ps4? It doesn’t happen as often as it used to when it DOES happen, it’s always when I’m being chased. TIA
---
You can only get 3 teachable unlocks a killer, but once you've unlocked them, they act as if they were just another "normal" perk.  
---
People who are completionists want to get all characters to prestige 3 level 50(P3-50), so they take the time to level all characters to max level and get all perks on them. Others don't care about that and only get the characters they want to play to max level with all perks and the other characters to level 40 for the teachables.
---
Actually I think it was said somewhere that survivors have to have their heads looking in ghost direction to cancel his power so they can't just have their camera look at him to counter it
---
It's getting spammy .-.
---
It inverts the camera controls to be more specific
---
Using a Mori is a great way to get survivors to get gens done quickly (and usually ignore totems). 
---
Great for when you need a fast game or for getting NOED to pop.
---
I'm christian too, this game is freaking awesome
---
Come on man, Scream does not suck. It was far ahead of it's time and still continues to inspire horror films now.
---
Tbh the pamela reveal is more terrifying now, because everyone thinks Jason is the killer so when Pamela rolls up in her jeep and is all sweet ooh it’s so good
---
Here comes the trapper~
---
Sorry...  I wish I wasn’t spamming, I just suck at my job.
---
Pig would still be op camper, make her not able to crouch if someone is alive
---
The players that keep games alive are the casuals. If you balance/release things only for high level players it will drive the casuals away. Consideration for high level play is fantastic, but making a killer people are getting excited for and will spend money on is more important.
---
Reddit is a very small portion of any games playerbase. Plenty of people will buy him and enjoy him because he's ghostface and they can sneak around.
---
Yeah except thrilling tremors got nerfed in the ptb, 60 second cooldown, pretty worthless now tbh
---
See: my other comment, but also...
---
I had a lot of fun on PS4 when the game was originally released on the console. I've since stopped playing for a while and recently started again on PC. It did take longer to find matches, and I would assume the playbase has since shrunk on consoles (which I have no source data to back up the claim with), so it might be longer to find good matches.
---
[removed]
---
The fuck did my hag do to deserve that? :(
---
Yeah let’s just say the 1/10 not cancelled game where I brought the shroud of separation ended really quickly
---
The realism really sells the game based on a homicidal spider god from another dimension
---
Well shit guess I could say it's the silliest Mori then.
---
I get that. I was just telling you it's a little much imo.  
---
Maybe try getting a link containing all of them and put that into 1 post.
---
agreed
---
Console or PC?
---
These are great. Keep spamming, maybe the devs will see and know what actual people look like lol
---
This
---
True, they can have an opinion. If someone says something sucks they should at least followup with why it sucks. Anything less sounds lazy and/or edgy.
---
Fair point. But even then, I’d assume you’d want to move around. Camping is always an “option” but not the preferable one.
---
Wait really?
---
lol weenies, thats all i can say.
---
Console
---
But Laurie has to keep her ugly stiff haircut. Rip.
---
Would be too supernatural for someone expected to be “grounded”, but I thought about that too. He isn’t the “Scream” ghostface anyway so thy could take whatever liberties they wanted.
---
ezpz
---
oh lord help me
---
Hardware limitations are fun.  
---
Nurse is much weaker on console.
---
Yessss. Hype!
---
Just like reaper
---
Oh damn, I forgot about that. I heard it a while ago, but still believed she was the best. What's different?
---
Not yet because the game doesn’t have servers to allow it, this will be a thing when dedicated servers go on live
---
Disagree, to a degree. 
---
Think of this perk in the hands of ghost himself or a M&amp;A Myers with a rabbit. Terror radius so all that it will proc during chase which can be extremely good as you can read survivors super easy after they vault. Again especially like ghost face if he shuts off his TR right before they vault
---
Me: *Posts 1 clip of my stream*
---
You:  “stop spamming”  *cries and complains because you are going know where in life*
---
Iron will maybe.. but it would just help as it would going against any other killer
---
Ruin, Sloppy/STBFL, Remember Me/NOED, Blood Warden.
---
I got all of them already.  I am really sorry about the spam...  I didn’t realize it’d get plastered everywhere
---
This is plain wrong. There have been plenty of thought provoking horror films that have released and even pushed boundaries all due to Screams massive influence in the genre. Horror heads would all agree.
---
I really qant to see that now
---
If I see him in my lobby, to mori or to dodge, that is the question
---
that would be better now your camera just needs to be in his direction and boom useless
---
When will this be?
---
Even The Face would be better
---
I am SO sorry about the spam.  I didn’t realize that this would get plastered all over the place, but I hope the poof claudette hair gets a remodel
---
I don't think you're judging me, and I appreciate the advice. I'm still playing the game, just get really frustrated with how slow progression is.  I also don't like playing the meta, even though that seems to be the best way to progress. Hence my calling it a pretty crap system.
---
It's edgy when there's no basis as to why it sucks.
---
he the guy that we sadly didn't get
---
Yep, ever single issue is definitely a bug. 100%.
---
&gt;Myself and a few friends just got the game on Xbox and after each game, we have to re-invite each other. Is there any way to stay in the lobby with each other? It's kinda annoying and off-putting
---
Unfortunately this feature doesn't exist yet and you won't see it added to the game before the Dedicated Servers go live. 
---
The [roadmap](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D77W0S2WsAEkudU.jpg:large) suggests it will be added with the next chapter (Chapter 13), which should happen around September.
---
Seems like you should have to focus on the killer dead center versus what it seems to people just sweeping the camera constantly. Even in doing that you may miss Myers stalking you but the Ghost gets caught anyway?
---
It's kinda weird because Myers noise notification happens when he's leaving stealth.
---
I'm not complaining, I really do enjoy seeing them, I find it funny how fans of the game can make the characters look better than the people who are paid to do so haha
---
That may be an issue with where you are in ranking. In the 10-14 range, you don’t get many DCs before matches. 
---
That rank range seems to actually care about playing the game and don’t dc before matches too badly. Plus the queue time is pretty good. Seems to be where a lot of the common casual players are. 
---
Lower than that or higher than that and I get a bunch of SWF teams that all DC together when anything doesn’t go their way. (Both when playing survivor or killer)
---
You're limited by hardware; lower FPS and control over your characters PoV.  
---
On PC, you can just look around mid-blink and change the direction of your blink quickly before blinking. You can't do that on console.
---
No worries :)
---
Awesome. Most of her hairstyles actually look pretty good now.
---
Well it’s not too far off now, they are/were on the PTB at least but I haven’t been keeping up, you can probably expect it sometime during the summer or near fall I suppose. They’re working hard on it and from what I know and what I recall it’s only 5 people working on it (I believe) just, luckily, it’s not too far off anymore
---
Pretty decent build, would definitely go sloppy over STBFL  tho
---
Lmao never thought we would have a g teir and a killer worse than Freddy. Idk why my hopes were up that ghostface would be a good killer
---
From my experience hags tend to camp heavily on a survivor, She’s very effective at it as well
---
Neither have a complete effect. I can't remember which one it is, but one will make you only cough and not puke but you still make the noise. I think it's iron will but can't remember
---
Eh?
---
Knowing exactly what generators to go to after picking someone up is ass?
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
You don't have to face him, but you need to actively look at him for 1+ seconds, and have actual LoS on him, and probably should be within a 32M radius at least, but 24 wouldn't be too bad balance wise either.   All the through wall rapid spins turning his power off are obviously making him WAY worse than he should be.
---
Oh my god this is great.
---
her controls are garbage on console and your movements are harder to execute compared to pc. Console nurse is litterally the only F tier killer. If you want to get more kills, either never blink or play someone else. Though you can also keep playing her and getting rekt if you enjoy it.
---
It's fine, really. It's great you're bringing these to the public; those who can't play the PTB can just look here instead.  
---
I'm just trying to say, maybe try giving a link instead of posting all these pictures in plenty of posts.
---
Scp 173 is way more deadly than ghostface, he can move across the room within the blink of an eye and break your neck, and destroy solid steel doors, ghostface is just one masky boi
---
You can't break a chase against good killers. The only way that happens is juking them, which is really only a result from the ability to look behind you. If you don't know where the killer is, they can mind game you but you can't them.
---
nah fam it is the the opposite
---
I actually have never seen ezpz in chat yet. 
---
I have seen ez pip, ggez, noob killer, baby killer, looser, camper, try hard, and many racial comments (which I report). Never seen ezpz
---
You’d better watch out for his traps!
---
I would think it is just one more line of code...use the same coding as now but add "IF survivor hits point button THEN pop killer out of stalk"...but you know...in modern coding haha
---
Okay.  Thanks for the tip
---
better watch out for his traps
---
No, this is in the PTB
---
STBFL would be pretty good if it weren't rank 1 imo
---
That sucks. You do have a week to figure it out though. Also, if you have a friend with an Xbox, you can log in from their as well! Good luck.
---
I mean, pretty much. Survivors aren’t supposed to be able to see him unless the character is literally facing in his direction and looking at him. They’re also not supposed to see him through walls, or corn or anything like that. One of the devs said you basically have to be super close to him for his stalk to cancel, even moreso with add-ons, and they have to be physically facing him with him in their line of sight to end the ability.
---
No. Nothing warrants a face camp.
---
i'd get wraith
---
rip in rip
---
This killer is JUST pandering, plain and simple. We love ghost face because of the characters it represented, not the mask itself. The fact they bought license to just the mask is a huge oof.
---
Or you could just run bbq and see them on the gens.
---
Check out seems like a bit mich
---
same
---
You forgot that they tweak him before sending him to Live Servers?  
---
You forgot the part where he wasnt OP/Screamed for Nerf, but for REWORK, because even as he was VERY weak, his fundamental mechanics where Broken? No Broken in a "Oh my god this is OP", but Broken un Literally "This doesnt work in this Game."
---
Watch out, you've been affected by [HEMORRHAGE!!!!](/intensifies) You leave behind a few more pools of blood that are dark red on a ground that is 95% of the time dark brown/green/black. But keep in mind that if the killer is running Blood Hound, you're in for a slightly less good time....
---
Hooked and downed survivors can detect you to cancel your stealth :)
---
That's the point, it's now arguable the most powerful perk in game, which can give 2-3 sometimes 4 kills from 0.
---
This is actual art
---
So how op would it be if they just got rid of this part? Haven’t been able to see anyone play him just seen the horror text on reddit
---
You a real one for this 💃🏻
---
At first people did when he was on the PTB, he had changed before going to Life.
---
(Use of this format sparks joy in me)
---
Should’ve gotten Nea.
---
Now ya’ll are really just complaining about everything
---
Thanks for your honest.
---
I'd like OoO to be reworked. I don't think one perk should hold perfect information on a killer's everything. It guts a quarter of the cast from it sucks to kill me now. This was the 3rd released dlc and it's never been touched. It's too much for what it brings today.
---
grandpa got no emotion in his face
---
True he seems pretty lacklustre
---
just do it, it is your choice
---
Oof
---
leak had him called "The Ghost"
---
bet the ghostface mask ip owners made them change it for their brand or whatever
---
I don't know how you say it in your county. Between 60 and 70 kilograms.
---
So I’m the bloodweb as you’re going through it you’ll find the same perk but instead have 2 lines which indicates T2. You level up perks through finding them in the bloodweb. You will also have to choose between 1 perk or another later on. 
---
Eventually if you grind and level up long enough you can have all perks T3
---
And what about degrees, if your laser pointer 1 degree off, you fucked??
---
You should do some JoJo templates as JoJo has the best memes
---
Ok good, I thought you meant pounds, which would be freakishly underweight
---
If only every survivor team at red ranks wasn’t a swf 😔
---
The perk is good for slugging builds. It would be great on billy or nurse as they can slug someone and be at the worked on gen in seconds. Could be deadly with Hag on Mint Rag (instantly teleporting to gens being worked on) or the new Freddy.
---
Most Scariest to me would probably be plague due to the Fact I get sick Really easy Freddy only comes in nightmares If I remember correctly Michael only scares me in game irl aside him being 6:8 I’m not too worried Huntress Debatable the rest of them fuck off
---
When you get detected, you get some small pings like the red arrow for a bit, but they're white.
---
[Look in the bottom left side of the screen when his stealth breaks](https://youtu.be/MjEXr06pyrE?t=349)
---
I assume it would be a large rectangle or a cone. I don't expect it to be a 1 pixel wide 32 meter line.
---
This isn’t lagswitching lmao this bugs been in the game for awhile gotta love it when people jump to conclusions.
---
Why do you offend me?
---
problem with bamboozle is that in its role as crutch for M1 killers, it's WAY outclassed by Spirit Fury-Enduring.
---
A good few of them have been suggested, and this one is on my to-do list, but I haven't watched any of the episodes, so it's tough for me to get into them. x/
---
I'm playin a dude, disguised as a dude, disguised as anotha dude.
---
I feel I understand why they did that because ghost face could just camp stalk then down the unhooker for downed survivors I have no clue why they thought it'd be ok. Still stupid though
---
I can't imagine actually thinking this. Ghostface is simply a worse Shape.
---
Cool, let the character struggle, mashing buttons is dumb. I can't play the game, why can't I send a text or drink some water? I've died a couple times because I fucked my struggle rhythm.
---
Completely stupid.
---
She's not overweight. Not even a little. She's heavier set. 
---
Look at her waist; she still curves into an hour glass figure. If her stomach was out past her boobs, she'd be fat.
---
U blind he’s saying they should not be able to we clearly know they can.
---
Name 3 counters to noed as it have plenty.
---
Yeah I know, I'm just acknowledging that it'd be great to have the full package
---
It’s SWF. They get paired with the lowest player rank so that person is not overwhelmed. 
---
I think the idea was that the lowest person would be at a disadvantage and would need to be carried by the higher rank player, producing balance. 
---
Doesn’t really work out most of the time.
---
That's where my friends and I sit and I dont think one of us has every DCed outside of special circumstances such as being stuck and the killer wont do anything to help, such as hit mew.
---
We tend to just want to play, and that seems to be how other people around there are too. It's rare to see super try hard players or incredibly salty players, though they do exist.
---
It’s definitely not what I would’ve gone with for Ghostface that’s for sure. I wouldn’t say it’s terrible though, if it actually worked correctly it’d be super fun and good for mind games.
---
Other survivors must really wreck Freddy, and maybe I should watch a video. Even as a Rank 1 survivor I have only escaped Freddy a handful of times, maybe. But I've never faired well against him.
---
On the other hand, I've played him using an offering twice and as a Rank 15 killer I crushed some survivors. Can't wait to play against his reworked form.
---
Dude, voice chat would make survivors undoubtedly much stronger.
---
The ability for a player to tell everyone else where the killer is at any given time is insanely powerful.
---
It doesn’t even depend on how good the survivors are, you only need ONE good survivors, and they become FAR more likely to survive.
---
Survivors really don’t need any more advantages, so I fail to see how this would help the balance in any way.
---
I spent way too much progress already. I can’t start over, even though i have a PC that can somewhat run dbd
---
Lmao
---
Moris are almost fun to me. While I do see the Ebony as unfair, it's still an extra challenge to deal with and that can be cool. I'm the only one in my friend group that thinks that way though. They wont DC, but they complain when the final offering doesnt flip
---
If you want to play the ptb play on your laptop it’s not that hard ??
---
I am blind. I got the wrong post, my bad.
---
Here comes the Trapper, don't step into his traps...wait...do,do step into his traps.

Camera looks better
---
I mean, they didn't push him out yet. Since he's still in the PTB (this is the whole reason they use it), I can almost guarantee most of these issues are going to be fixed before release.
---
Maybe he meant he mains Mike Myers, the guy who voices Shrek. May have been playing Shrek racer all this time. I can see the confusion. He was in a movie called “So I married an axe murderer”
---
I like them
---
No, i don't like underweight. I like healthy women without make up wearing comfortably clothes and sneakers. 
---
Over and underweight are not ok. That's all. We can act that is is ok. It is unhealthy. If you eat too much of if you don't want eat, that is all bad.
---
I kinda brain dead so can someone tell me what DDoS Means
---
I don't think you know what lagswitching is. But this is a funny bug though.
---
I feel Freddy would at least be sympathetic for Ghostface as he experienced what he's going through. Sad Ghostface sucks but I'll still main him
---
Going with remake freddy was bad. It was just simply bad
---
as a former child, I'd like to see father removed
---
It always messes me up when a killer other than leatherface brings franklins, cause i never notice until I run up to a gen and my tool box is gone.
---
I was just explaining my situation. My question was answered in the first thread so don’t think you’re helping anyone with your pretentious sarcasm.
---
I’m not tryna help you I’m just telling you how it is man
---
Getting grabbed is incredibly easy. If you've ever gone against a tombstone Myres, you probably noticed you can just stick to gens when he's close to getting you, or just slow-vault a window or pallet.  
---
Just a Bite rewards tunneling, as the survivors can't heal for 90 seconds, which gives you benefits if you go after the same survivor after they're unhooked.  
---
Misanthropy is a little meh for how selfish it is. Autodidact gives you a penalty at the start of the game, but if you can get the stacks for it, Autodidact can help your teammates a lot by almost insta-healing them. Maybe try going off something similar to that.
---
Thanks dad, Can I get my weekly rations now?
---
Keep your agenda out of videogames pls. Also what one person does with their body shouldn't be any of your business.
---
I won’t say he isn’t worse than Myers but I do like the gameplay he provides. The only problem is that it doesn’t work in its current state. Being able to individually stalk survivors for 3 seconds and then instadown them is awesome. The problem is it’s current state
---
You can't cleanse totems against good killers. Try it against good spirit or billy, tell me how it goes. Even against average killer, every second counts. You counter a perk which might not even exist.
---
After it lights up, at least one person getting fucked, as when 1 gen is left, killer usually chases someone, gen is done you get face full of noed. And to find, it takes times, so when it's cleansed, person on a hook have no time left, you have to rush the hook, and someone is dying anyway.
---
Don't get hit? You mean hide like a little bitch when 1 gen is left and let my team sacrifice themselves, while I do nothing? In endgame most pallets are gone, you getting hit.
---
You mean hatch escape? Yea, I have infinite amount of keys in my disposal, let me get right to it.
---
This scene is a panel from the manga and is probably the most recognized panel in manga to my knowledge.
---
Regarding Enduring, the previous increased recovery time at 75% would reduce a pallet stun (2 seconds) to 1.14 seconds. The flat reduction will reduce a 2 second pallet stun to 1 second. Even though the numbers would suggest that 75% faster recovery is better, halving the stun time of 2 seconds to 1 second is actually an improvement, and much clearer to understand. As more stun effects have made their way into the game, we decided to make it only effective against pallet stuns to reduce confusion and maintain consistency with varying stun times.
---
Did you read that?
---
And they wonder why so many players dislike them.
---
Ik how it is. So thanks and mind your business
---
For future reference, you might wanna put a watermark on it somewhere if you plan on submitting it so that people don’t steal it from you
---
Probably too close to Myers
---
Did but didn’t really understand it
---
Not gonna lie, nerf the range on *Security* to 6 meters and make it level seeing reveal bubbles/skill checks/auras, and we have a pretty cool perk on our hands.
---
Guess my response shows how little I know, lol
---

---
Oh I didn't know if so?
---
Thought it was Okay since there was a "Screenshot" tag.
---
According to the rules this could maybe fit into the "Oversaturated content"? But it's not focusing on 1 emblem or anything like that, Just a 4k as a new killer.
---
Right. (And not just because you quoted me)
---
This is the same feeling I have for Nurse and Billy. They are too powerful and are holding back good game balance like ignoring SWF is. 
---
In order for the balance to be better, the devs have to have a more level playing field. More predictable. That is hard for an RNG game like this, but is near impossible when a common 3rd party app like Discord basically lets you cheat.
---
A lot of people have been saying this, even Monto suggested this and i agree that it would work better. It would force you to get off your gen to break his stealth.
---
You are justifying your taste and you don’t like it just say the fucking truth. 
---
Also what someone does with there body shouldn’t be of your concern. It’s not you and who knows maybe they like how they are and there lifestyle. It doesn’t matter as long as they aren’t being harmful. 
---
Don’t be a shit and being overweight doesn’t always have to do with being unhealthy.
---
Monto just suggested this, maybe he got it from this post. Hopefully they tweak it a bit.
---
It's because he's the Ghost Face Killah
---
Springwood is my favorite map you jerk
---
havent played the ptb but apparently you can stalk while in a chase upclose. 
---
which would be pretty powerful
---
correct me if im wrong
---
Only the spotting being instant and happening through walls... it taking a second or two and being fixed won't change anything. Looking at him will still counter him.
---
He still has a notification saying he's gping into stealth. He still will sound like an airplane while stalking.
---
The bug fixes won't fix Ghost's issues at all!
---
The intent is need to face ghostface for one second I heard. This is a bug.
---
I think I got lucky actually haha. 
---
The first game was actually quite close. The last guy (Who DC'd) I caught trying to open the door after I closed the hatch. Quite sad that I didn't get to hook him but, Meh. What ya gonna do?
---
Yeah. Look at the 4gamers YouTube channel. Half of the content is glitches like this caused by lag at weird times. That is when you get the floating T-poses and teleports to outside the map walls.
---
A pose
---
Exactly! Sometimes I just want to upfront call people fucking stupid.
---
Yup
---
Saw a guy recommending him for new players and decided, Why not?
---
It still wouldn't happen. When Doctor first came out, Calm Spirit wasn't suddenly the meta until Doctor faded.
---
what does the p3 head look like?
---
I mean those are the counters. If you don't play well enough to use them that's on you. The killer plays the whole game without a perk it needs to be a good buff. The perk isn't overpowered at all.
---
Need to next get his cousin the crapper
---
At least we can always go back to watching the pretty good job so far guy get dunked on by Korean survs.
---
I am in red ranks and am a solo survivor.
---
I mean, it also grants the Killer perfect information of the Survivor :b
---
Nah, he’s a good family man. He’s always trying to unite ppl down at the basement
---
And then cry because they removed insta blinds and some pallets because of that game...
---
It’s so satisfying.
---
So stupid. 
---
Can't use his flip phone, can't use any map akin to the movie, can't have shirtless Myers (I don't really give a shit about that but still). Why are companies being such dicks about such an innocuous thing?
---
Yikes.
---
Front cameras got big in the early 2000's B.
---
I guess you can “technically” stalk in a chase if you’re against a rank 20 survivor who doesn’t look behind them but as soon as a survivor looks at you it drains your power and takes you out of that mode, so there’s no point.
---
Its like people forget that people ran Small Game before it was absolutely gutted when trapper was the most popular.
---
Lmaoooo I always get called toxic
---
Dumb question but you're tried verifying the game files and just uninstalling and reinstalling, right? If so... fack thats the best i can think of.
---
True I mean Freddy did diddle kids and play scratchy back with them.
---
That's probably bugged and isn't meant to work that way in the first place.
---
Plus they are going to make changes, they confirmed it on the forums
---
It’s literally impossible for him to be stealthy. All survivors have to do is spin the camera angle and happen to point it in his direction.
---
To be fair, I don’t think lessening the cool down on a given killer ability will do a whole lot more than adding in a completely new one when it comes to counterbalancing VC. You still have the same problem of either not having them strong enough, or having them so strong that the survivors are underpowered.
---
The ability to communicate is massive, is my main point, and if they manage to balance the game around that, then that’s great, problem solved. I just don’t think that could feasibly happen.
---
I wouldn’t say that solo survivors are particularly weak, either. Maybe in low ranks, but if all survivors know what they’re doing, then even if they’re all solo, I’d still say they’re stronger than most killers.
---
On an unrelated note, thanks for keeping your cool and being civil throughout this debate, you’re awesome.
---
the killer is good yeah but apparently his ability is terrible after seeing gameplay
---
I highly recommend having a watch/read, honestly JoJo is the best thing I’ve ever watched/read
---
That sounds like a complaint against straight up camping instead of a specific killer though. You can just crouch or use a flashlight otherwise.
---
Interesting idea... but I think killers shouldn’t be able to see the names of the survivors while in the lobby only during the match and post game screen? Since survivors can’t see the killers perks especially in solo q matches
---
He put some make-up on his hands for christmas dinner so that grann wouldn't get on his ass for having a tattoo and being a "devil worshipper".
---
They have the license to the mask only.
---
Here comes the crapper and his craps...
---
We were until we had gameplay and realized how flawed he is
---
Ok. Do you think it's repairable
---
I am not much of a FPS online shooter person. Gave Deathgarden a try, but really didn’t like it. Might try again later, but likely a bit too frantic for me. I would rather play The Last Year than that
---
I think its jojo? idk tbh
---
Camping can be dealt with via borrowed time (most of the time) but the times it completely fair are when there’s an actively camping hag, All that power with no set backs
---
DbD and DGarden have different development teams (it's not impossible that there's overlap but likely not a lot) so odds are that no, they won't favor on or the other, they'll put time into both in order to dominate the asymmetric horror game market by having both a slow and fast game that are updated regularly.
---
Kate on the other hand
---
The fact that this comes from a pig flair seals it.
---
Oh no way. If they get locked with them they’ll remove survivors to make it fair.
---
If they swapped out the camera for the phone it almost feels like the whole leak was almost intentional to build hype...
---
Not to mention you can hear his loud ass from miles away.
---
His power is completely shit and borders on useless even without the current bugs.
---
Woah Split screen mode would be cool af for DBD
---
You're fine, I'm not accusing you of anything. I remember one of my posts getting taken down for something about it being too boring or not being discussion worthy. Though, I didn't really look at the rules beforehand, so probably my fault.
---
wait a minute ain't it supposed to be detective's hunch
---
PTB =/= Current Game Build
---
&gt; We should wait until they fix it just in case he's really good after
---
This is precisely the kind of comment i was talking about. The PTB is literally for that reason. So survivors can give them things to fix. If no survivor complained then the state of GF wouldn't be changed to reflect our wishes.
---
Its ok, but thanks?
---
It would be tough but it could be possible. It's kind of light getting a t1 Myers stalking you for a minute. Youre not gonna let it happen again. That, ontop of anyone being able to see you, you're kind of a powerless m1 killer.
---
Decreased volume in Chase music on PTB = Decreased volume in Chase music on Live
---
Nah, that's the one that shows auras on generator completion
---
Twitch btw
---
What about jakes long hair? They screwed it up a few chapters ago.
---
Do you disagree or are you being snarky and condescending for no reason other than stroking your own ego and feeling clever?
---
guy or girl?
---
Awesome tattoo!
---
What did they exactly do to freddy? Personally I’ve liked him ever since the clown came out. Which is roughly when I started dbd.
---
That's actually an a-pose
---
PTB saves only saves stuff you've done on there not on the actual game. So no progress will be given if you buy Ghostfaces when he releases he will be level 1
---
Bro why
---
No
---
i looked it up to see if i wasn't bamboozling myself
---
It’s more that I disagree and I’m making fun of your reaction. You’re speaking like a god damn super villain
---
Hope you guys are right. Ty for the opinions
---
That's a new one.
---
Would be incredibly broken or pretty much useless for chases
---
Sure but I just feel like it’s too situational and every benefit it has is outclasses by other perks. Survivor aura reading? Empathy/bond. Killer position/interactions? Alert, premonition, spine chill. 
---
If the killer has no aura reading perks then the teammate element is wasted. And while I agree that it can help you figure out some of the killers perks which is nice, I don’t know if that justifies the perk slot. Except maybe in SWF where you can inform your entire team of his loadout and movements to a degree. 
---
But I see what you’re going for an it’s an interesting idea and theory. I’d just rather see new mechanics rather than a mashup of existing perks like we’ve seen with a lot of new perks lately. Maybe they’re just running out of ideas that work within the current limitations of the game.
---
Yeah, but only the information that the survivor wants the killer to know. I use OoO to manipulate the killer. Giving them information to mislead them in order to waste their time, save a teammate, etc. OoO only benefits the killer if you don't know how to use it.
---
I had that glitch happen to me once too but I had the Chinese New Year dress on so I really looked like the Nurse.
---
Oh he definitely is.
---
Pig had Tapp
---
[wait like this](https://imgur.com/a/RCtu9Wq)
---
Yes, a survivor’s camera (not their body) can deactivate his power if it is oriented towards Ghostface. A slow 360 will stop him
---
Maybe people ran it because of monto but regardless it became a small meta for a week or 2. I can guarantee in the launch of legion you'd see more no-mither than the month before.
---
Lol alrighty fair enough.
---
Can’t you report this guy to your ISP?
---
*continues to smash pallets and pick people up with one hand*
---
They were originally dreads, but it looked like hair.
---
Yeah, if you set off her traps. Why are you setting off her traps when  there is a clear counter to it? Also, your changes don't actually even address this complaint. If anything, the changes would ruin her in a chase.
---
Bhvr plz
---
Well apparently you don't even know what a PTB is for so I'm guessing you have no idea what Quality Assurance is supposed to be for either.
---
sTeAlTh GoOd PlEaSe NeRf
---
Clarification: It's a BUG. The survivors are supposed to actually spot him and stare at him for awhile. Before it cancels, and I think it's only supposed to cancel one part of his power. But instead all you need to do is wiggle your camera everywhere and eventually you will just spot him and cancel both parts.
---
Every stealth killer in this game is about as goddamn loud as my PS4 when I open the game.
---
Trappers one of my favorite killers, my 3 year old loves the Samination cartoons and her favorite character...Trapper.
---
CHUCKY WE WANT CHUCKY
---
These look so good!
---
Just ghosty
---
Are rhetorical questions really synonymous with super villains? Or maybe it was because I dared to use an "!" somewhere in there who knows.
---
But how about rather than making fun of me for the way I write, how about you explain why my point is wrong because frankly I really want it to be.
---
Yes bitch! 😭👋👌
---
Just make it do secret offerings don't appear on the offering screen.
---
Not really a secret when you know it's most likely a Mori or you're starting alone/2+ Survivors are starting together.
---
He's thick, man.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
The game is trying its best to find 4 survivors for you before starting the lobby.
---
This looks so good! Hopefully they redo her base model hair!
---
**The** Yeet McDabbington Nae Nae IV
---
Makes perfect sense.
---
I’m 50/50 with Ashs. Often times they’re cocky SOBs but other times they’re genuinely nice and good players.
---
Yep. I couldn’t do gens at all because it blocked the skill checks.
---
Idk what that is.
---
Some murder all your friends and then spare you on a whim.
---
Where else could he store those sweet tasty survivors?
---
Well first of all it’s the theatrics of it all you’re just being overly dramatic. Second of all you’re making the comparison that “they shouldn’t be celebrating their 3rd anniversary party because this killer they released was bad”. Third of all, while spirit and legion weren’t completely “fixed” in the PTB, they were improved. The reason Legion took so long to fix was because their power was fundamentally abusable and they had to figure out a way to circumvent that. With ghost face, the problem is much simpler: Ghost Face is being detected in situations where he shouldn’t be. The devs have acknowledged that this is a bug within hours of release and I expect a fix before it goes live. Detection from downed and hooked survivors will probably be gone by launch . As for detection via OoO and Spine chill,  we will simply have to wait and see if that was just a balance issue on behaviors part.
---
I think talking 2 seconds to knock him out would be fine. If you saw him stalking you, it's a guessing game: Do you have time to knock him out of stealth, or is he already almost done and you're exposing yourself by staying in LOS?
---
That would make my day if Monto saw this haha
---
How? Knowing who’s on gens and slowing the match even more? Are you dumb?
---
go complain on the official forums
---
Ghostface never was great
---
It's PTB. Pretty hard to always find a match around your rank when not too many people wanna go text out the PTB. It's either you get matches like this or none at all or wait like an HR for one match that's around you rank.
---
Pig, the thought of being in any SAW styled trap is fucking petrifying. There's bound to be some kind of sacrifice intense pain or hard choice to fuck you up for life, if you survived.
---
I was the killer...
---
His power is he looks cool and can teabag
---
I was thinking that they could remove the possibility to remove Ghostface from his stalk all together, and limit him to just exposing one survivor at a time. Thus making him more of a hybrid of Pig and Meyers without buffing or nerfing him too hard.
---
Everything’s shiny capt’n!
---
His biker jacket has tattoos, but that's a reference to Francis from Left 4 Dead.
---
Would actually be super easy to code. Its just basic trigonometry.
---
Has it been proven? I might as well take your word considering it's been so long.
---
Leatherface is not bad, he’s not amazing, but you can definitely do good with him if you get a decent build.
---
**F i n g e r   G u n s**
---
Yep u agree I don't get how people think he'll be good even after the bug fixes you just need to look at him for a second to negate it even though it's the PTB it most likely won't get changed as changing it could make him OP. He is just a balancing nightmare.
---
Just some guy in a costume with a knife somehow outrunning a athlete runner and a Cop that probably knows how to disarm a person from his Police training. Yea makes sense.
---
ehhhhhh.....
---
Also object of obsession can body him since you can tell when he’s looking at you if you’re the obsession
---
Idk man Scary Movie night have it beat
---
IIRC Wes Craven did not create Ghostface, he directed the movies. Whereas he wrote and directed Nightmare.
---
Hey man freddy can actually use his power. Dont even play.
---
This is so perfect.
---
Try using Bloodhound on Wraith, you'll enjoy it a lot more, especially if you just started playing killer, when I first started, it helped me a lot.
---
Try that on nurse
---
BPs or shards would be perfect. And yeah dc'ing is lame in general but especially lame when you get that far into the match! It only gives killer 650 points too. Should be alot more than that imo.
---
Did you just quote dead meat?😂😂
---
I was literary thinking about this the moment I played him lol.
---
Nuclear hot take
---
It is a jojo reference, I do like yu yu hakusho tho classic
---
Is there a problem with that?
---
There are better perks for both. It doesn't slow the game down since it only blocks gens people aren't working on.
---
As a Myers main....I know how this feels....
---
I only recently joined reddit, so idk what it was like when legion was in PTB, but it seems like the sub just exploded, and took a break from the Carl Crusade (Karl or Carl?) to talk about this, so they should definitely see it.
---
#WeNeedCarl
---
Because Ghost face is bad there is no point to play as a killer with a broken ability. Once they fix it I could see people start to play the PTB
---
you sound like you are already doing pretty good, a 4k means you did exceptionally well, getting 1-2 kills with everyone hooked a couple times is definitely a win
---
pls lemme use 2 perks for a concept art of Danny DeVito I'm doing xD
---
i have a bfa in game design thanks, i just dont think its worth throwing a fit over a bug on a Public *Test Beta*. QA testing doesnt solve 100% of all bugs or issues in games. it's why patches still exist. pushing builds to different servers can cause unexpected issues. this literally seems like a minor error in code/unchecked box that is causing the issue. 
---
you didnt pay for ghost face yet. hes not in the main server yet. is it disappointing that he didnt come out perfectly fine? yes. but like, bugs happen! mistakes happen! itll be fixed before hes pushed to being able to buy or on the main servers. its a game. theres no point having your underwear in a wad over an issue on a PTB that will probably (assuming here) will be fixed before the PTB is over.
---
Oh you're right, I meant no disrespect to Freddy...the same can't be said for that spooky boy \*eyeroll\*
---
Very epic fellow survivor main (50/50 chance he actually is a survivor main)
---
I don't know for sure but it's been long enough
---
Oh boy wait until rank 12 you'll be in for a world of bronze tokend.
---
“I’m the ghost”
---
“Or ghostie for short.”
---
well this guy got downvoted to shit but now that hes out, ghostface is shit.
---
saves me from buying Laurie for DS
---
He can’t stalk through corn or low grass.
---
I like to walk, to walk on cats
---
Poor Carl. The only survivor that never respected the Camera mechanic when Ghostface was stalking him....
---
Ya I bet lol, most games I don’t even get tokens in some categories so I can’t even imagine rank 10
---
Oh fuck, now THIS is a reference I wasn't expecting to see on here.
---
Spinechiller is pretty much going to be a nightmare for Ghostface.
---
hoho~ then come as close as you'd like.
---
EW1 Myers is IMMUNE to detection perks. That means no Aura reading, or Spine Chill, or even Premonition. (Even though the description says it "Trumps all killer stealth abilities. I assume this means stuff like Insidious or other TR/Red Stain reducing perks) 
---
Given Ghostface seems to be a dedicated "Stealth/Ambusher" killer, and how fast his ability can be deleted (and how long it takes to fill back up) I think giving him the same EW1 Myers treatment when he's in stealth mode would be a massive improvement.
---
also the swinging sound is really cliche, a lot of the killers swings sound really powerful and heavy. But ghost face just sounds like he’s slapping around a wet noodle with those weak ass sounding swings
---
Plus alot of bad players usually play the PTB so in the actual game it will be painful. But I'll still main him when he releases
---
Honestly if BHVR doesn't fix up Ghostface then there's basically no point to buy him unless you want the memes.   Like compared to the other standalone Killer DLC, Leatherface, his power basically does nothing and his perks are niche at absolute best, and that's stretching it.
---
Someone made a post saying that Carl is already drained of hope since he worked retail.
---
yikes
---
It does slow the game down? It blocks it for a considerable amount of time. So any survivors that were about to work on a gen any time soon can’t. Is that really a hard concept to grasp?
---
Since we're throwing around credentials, I worked at Electronic Arts Tiburon for 6 years.  Helped ship Madden and Tiger Woods franchises.  I know how builds work and QA are consistently testing on newer builds as they are pushed.  Usually before a build gets pushed for public testing like in this case, it goes through a series of test cases and validations.  Both black box testing and white box testing.  I find it hard to believe that QA didn't notice that the power was useless just by playing it and bringing it up to the design team.  If they did any unit testing post build, they would have caught a simple check issue like this even without a QA doing black box testing.  I mean it doesn't surprise me coming from these devs cause they never seem to have their shit together, but yeah everywhere else in the software development world does check before they release a new feature.
---
You’re doing great sweetie keep on doing It :)
---
You’re right but I don’t want you to be
---
Ya I will definitely main him! Even if it means getting bronze after bronze lol.
---
Idk what an incel is and I don't really care but he definitely is a giant piece of shit. Back when the prestige glitch was around he posted about making everyone out to p3 and then on top of that there was another exploit with the items in the bloodweb that worked the exact same way as the prestige glitch. He posted screenshots kf his several hundreds of items from doing it and was mocking the devs saying they can't do shit about it because he's on console. 
---
He needs to have his shit removed from the game, purchases locked and then the next day permanently banned from accessing the game. Why the next day? So he can see all his shit gone before being automatically banned the next time he logs back in just to rub it in a little harder.
---
Survivors should not have any capability of interacting with a killers power in any way. Change my mind.
---
Are you dumb? It doesn't slow the game down (what made you think that?). The only thing that it's better at than BBQ is that it can reveal survivors on gens who are close by, but BBQ does that too if you have common sense seeing how if no one shows up that means they're close by. BBQ doesn't have a CD, and it doesn't only work on survivors close to gens. Plus it gives BPs, so overall BBQ is the better perk.
---
Freddy the Nightmare giving Ghostface a Nightmare of his Life.
---
Or they could've just not been money hungry and took whatever they got?  Instead they could've released normal DLC.
---
I mean losing isnt really fun and for someone that manages to do decent at Freddy I'll think I'll be fine. I just think it may be enjoyable now because he just released but later he could be miserable to play and I play around rank 5s or so
---
Someone asked for a screenshot on your other post. Do you have a screenshot or like a video or something?
---
I swear I thought of the same thing
---
That’s some efficient photoshop my man
---
Incel = involuntary celibate
---
And I wholeheartedly support your idea
---
Someone probably realized that camera phones didn’t exist when the movie was released. I think a disposable camera that you have to crank turn would have been funnier.
---
I’m happy with ghost face, Iv been running around as a survivor for the PTB and Iv been up against some poorly played ghost face but I also went up against some crazy good ones who used his powers and 4K us. There is some minor stuff that needs work but in all people just need to learn him more
---
16 seconds is a really short amount of time. Even if it stopped gens people were working on it'd still be weak. Why would I ever run this perk over something better?
---
I saw the wrath when I got -1 points
---
“Please for the love of god don’t unhook me”
---
*lens flare red eyes*
---
“GOTTA GET THAT STACK FOR MY TANK BUILD YEEEHAWWW”
---
So if they have to look at you with their very own face not just with the camera, that would change a lot. You could stalk in a chase and the survivor would have to turn around so you stop stalking. Moonwalk Op?

---
The only reason why you're saying this perk is good is because "it slows the game down". Only in rare situations does it slow the game down by only up to 16 seconds. In order for that you happen to have to pray that no survivors are currently working on gens (which is literally their main objective), and are instead on their way to a gen as you're picking up a survivor.
---
This is what I thought about when I learned about his useless power.
---
They’re bringing what people have wanted since the launch of the game, licensed killers. Don’t like it, don’t buy it
---
How can I get the full set? Its awesome
---
Honestly who the fuck at BHVR thought this was a good concept?
---
Let's compare:
---
**Hag**: Has her power greatly negated by crouching, and sometimes flashlights
---
**Doctor**: Has his power heavily negated by Calm Spirit and not trying to hide
---
**Myers**: Has his power negated a bit by breaking line of sight rapidly
---
**Fucking Ghost Face**: Has his power 100% shut off and gone on cool-down, and his stealth completely destroyed, and his stalking completely stopped, essentially making him an uncloaked wraith for the entire cooldown....by fucking LOOKING AT HIM
---
Honestly what the fuck kind of design is that?!
---
/rant
---
i submitted it before posting! all good, but thanks for looking out!
---
Ghostface isn't that interesting even if he works he's just another myers/pig.
---
He needs to look nice for the holidays
---
cool! thats interesting to know im always interested in hearing things from the industry. i only "threw" around credentials because you implied i don't know anything about game design (i will also say mine is 75% art and 25% programming). im just saying, with how the devs have apparently reacted to this, it seems like they didn't know about it until the PTB went live. which is why im saying i imagine its something really simple that got typo'd or unchecked or whatever. i dont think their reaction would be "what the hell that shouldnt be happening" if they expected his power to be working on PTB today. again i dont know where you're like...not getting this. yes people check before they release new features, but that doesn't stop every single bug/glitch/etc to exist. thats why games have PTBs/PTRs to test things out and see how it functions on a mass scale. i didnt mean in my first reply to imply they have no QA's b/c they have a PTB, but that like; they have a PTB to triple check things.
---
i get i was semi hostile in my first reply but i dont really get why you're so worked up over this. i agree this shouldnt be a bug that came to light, but i also don't like the entitlement that comes with being a consumer of video games. mistakes happen and they will get fixed. i would only imagine they'd push his release back until it works, because i dont think they could ever recover from the PR nightmare of shipping a broken ass character and expecting money for it.
---
It’s a different person though. It’s not billy lookism or stu. It’s Danny or something. BHVR got the rights to the mask but not the characters behind them.
---
Now some of them look gorgeous  :)
---
Absolutely nothing worse than survivors who like to turn around and try to dead hard through you. Ez face camp
---

I always do it on Stealin‘ Steve though. And they always come back for their precious green key.

I just posted them in comments.
---
Lol, perfect
---
Nice to see some decent and different stuff this week. 
---
I’ll definitely pick up Bond that I’m missing but DS and PgtW are both worth grabbing if you can spare the shards imo.
---
Black mirror episodes aren’t directly connected though, just referenced. Speaking of which new season let’s go!!!
---
No I took this screenshot yesterday, it's the full game. I blocked out all the perks because some people like to shit on others for the perks they use, and I didn't want to give them any ammunition.
---
Your Nea SB is only t2.......
---
I feel like the Legion is DBD’s knockoff Ghostface that they made before they could get him. Just like Trapper is a knockoff Jason and Billy is a knockoff Leatherface. The Legion chases quickly, stabs multiple times, has multiple identities, and a white mask beneath a dark hood.
---
That looks really nice actually :)
---
And your Spine Chill is also only T2
---
I was debating on if I should buy Laurie or not just for Decisive, luckily I don't need to. This week's Shrine is actually great, especially for Survivor. I bet Killer mains are kinda annoyed, though. Bond is gonna be brutal if someone needs healing or if they wanna double up on a gen. And Decisive is, well, Decisive
---
Yep I don't get how people just say "oh you are playing him wrong I 4ked with him so you must be playing him wrong" got the exact same shit when I played Freddy like how am I supposed to play him then tunnel and camp? Then once people get put against semi decent survivors they lose. I'm not calling people who say that bad it's just annoying he is a M1 killer not a stealth Killer. This is coming from someone who plays low tier killers.
---
It can be used for multiple things.
---
Good meme
---
yeah that's basically it.
---
Couple thousand? Aren't tattoo removal like a few hundred at best?
---
The noise he makes when in stealth needs to be quieter too imo, it's so loud its pretty much impossible to sneak up on someone
---
I've missed more skill checks than I care to admit thanks to Claudettes disabling their camo and jump scaring me from behind.
---
He came out on the PTB this morning
---
Representing the Hookers Club I see.
---
You literally can remove his power by spinning your camera and you tell me he isn't so bad ?
---
Hag is top half of killers.
---
Freddy has the argument for him. He can use dream transition mindgames so its an advantage for him that the survivor he intends to down is awake. He also has aura reading so he can afford to break chase for applying pressure. If you comvine the 2 you realise your better off not chaseing with him but instead pressureing other survivors and useing the dream transitiom to down.

---
splinter machine broke
---
This is the fastest way to put off new players, having low rank killers matched against veteran survivors. 
---
This is also how we get terrible players at higher ranks because they get carried by high rank team mates. 
---
Seems at the very least the killer rank should be somewhere in the middle of all the ranks. 
---
Makes no sense that they don’t want low rank survivors struggling against a high rank killer, but it’s fine for low rank killers to get abused and made fun of by high rank survivors. 
---
I’d say the devs are mostly low rank survivors and that’s why they make some ridiculous ‘design choices’ when they make changes sometimes.
---
Top half of rank 20 maybe lmfaooo no one plays her trash ass for a reason
---
Nothing compares to hani's hair
---
Shhhhh, it’s a secret
---
Yeah i agree. As a survivor main this was very underwhelming and i'd like to have killers that are a challenge to go up against and not EZ wins. There's tons of feedback going on though so hopefuly they get his shit together before the DLC drops
---
Yeah size and color definitely matter, this isn't that big and has dark colors (easier for light lasers to remove) but I've never heard of someone getting one removed in one session or paying less than a couple hundred in total (you're not just paying for the laser but the expertise) but I could be wrong, I'm not an expert either lol
---
No need to be an asshole bro
---
Yes but it will be painful. Will play him until prestige 3
---
Nah the devs said they were wicked horny for Bloodwarden interactions with the Endgame so I think it's safe. Biggest change I can see them possibly making is to open up the Bloodwarden gate during the last few seconds of Endgame but I doubt that, it's too funny to change.
---
Freddy isn’t bad...

So many places. Pig ringtone, boop the snoot, many more.

You know what would be super cool? If you let your daughter color in his mask with washable markers
---
That would be awesome lol
---
I'm no programmer, but considering you have to specify how accurate the point has to be and what distance it's effective at, it has to be way more than one line.
---
BLESS YOUR SOUL
---
“Shat my dick off” fpmsl :’D
---
Probably never considering that you can get unlock all non-licensed characters with shards now.
---
I figured that 99% of the shit that was leaked was gonna be changed
---
You took me there.
---
I do agree that you could use mindgames and some other stuff but that isn't a full change of playstyle. I just don't get it it honestly plus it doesn't make him good
---
Definitely gonna add up to a couple hundred in total. The guy who originally commented said he checked and it was 200-500. I've checked in the past out of curiosity and seen 600 I believe. 
---
I'm sure the area you're in will impact pricing as well. Couple hundred total seems reasonable, couple hundred per session sounds insane to me.
---
I would beg to differ, not needing to actualy chase is huge. Each to their own though.
---
maybe it's alex's toolbox and thats where he hides them so the entitty cant find them
---
I get the feeling you didn't read how his power actually works.
---
After the reveal that it'd only be Ghostface and not the actual Scream franchise, the only hope he had left was a fun/meta power, which it isn't. Therefore we get a killer for a license that not many people care about (realistically, who cares about the Ghostface mask if it's not the Scream iteration of it?) with a power that nobody wants to play.
---
You can pip with only 3 kills, giving one up won’t necessarily make you lose rank.
---
Normal? No. Something that has happened a few times? Ye. Never to me but I've seen it. I cant imagine playing at night and having your TV bathe you in a blood red glow. Must be spoopy af
---
Completely agree!
---
Man you shouldnt let your 3 year old watch anything related to such a violent game
---
Would be a fun little sound queue.
---
Licensed*
---
He’s not wounded though
---
Yeah I was like “um so can I leave now?” and the game was like “nope welcome to the entity’s realm “
---
I feel like he should be able to stalk while being looked at, but increase the timer to stalk and maybe make it go down faster when not being stalked.
---
I thought the timer was fine strict but fine. I already use it on any killer I can when its at tier 3 but now I see no reason to not use it even on tier 1
---
Severely underrated comment right here.
---
She literally traps and patrols, getting easy hooks. I don't think she is fun, but she is definitely up there with huntress in plague in the 4-6 range.
---
Bubbas instadown will come into play more than ghostfaces, plus faster pallet break.
---
His power will be fine once it's not glitched.
---
 They need to get rid of the stupid-ass little wing things that flap off his side. Makes him so fucking obvious when you see a floating piece of black fabric behind a wall
---
Just please dont buff him, then he will make Mikey and Amanda obsolete.
---
A whole second ? Wow, that's clearly powerful ...
---
Come on a 6ft or a small Chucky killer would be awesome.
---
What a fucking amazing tattoo! And I read your reasoning behind it - that’s cute. You should send to Samination on his social media. His videos are seriously one of my favorite videos ever. 
---
I’ll get a matching Crapper tattoo, but it’s going on my bum.
---
I am known as the pig guy here, I wont let by queen be insulted.
---
I initially thought this to myself as a joke, but it seems like quite a lot of people are on board with this idea
---
Sweet tat, it’s a piece of you. Enjoy it
---
At least scratchy back is more fun to play than hide the soul. Smh that game is so boring and repetitive.
---
people who get mad that their streamers were wasted
---
There's no duration on his stealth, you can activate his stealth at the first possible opportunity instead of waiting until you find a survivor, the only way to lose stealth is by making an attack or being spotted by a survivor (Spotting mechanic is glitched currently btw). The reason for that sound effect is to make his stealth power a non-combat stealth. That's Pig's job.
---
Well friend, that "Pathetic cartoon character" is my sona. Yes, I have red and blue dyed hair. No, I didn't just use it for no reason.
---
Since it was extremely early on into the PTB's release, I thought I would choose my own sona instead of any character from Dead by Daylight to show that this was my opinion at the time of the post being made. I didn't want people to think that I was trying to make a statement (as some people do) about a character that's not even been out for longer than 2 hours.
---
Instead of trying to make it generic, I thought it would also be better if it was more personalized so if someone thought of going on a "Grand Meme Heist", I can easily point it out as my own character used but that last point is probably the least important.
---
Also, he didn't come with a survivor.
---
So there's the reason.
---
I wish i knew the answer. I even had a teammate rage at me earlier because they didn't like the way i was playing. Called me all types of dumbass lol.
---
Don't let it get to you though, it's entitlement i guess. They want you to play by their rulebook.
---
I just move on and have a quick laugh about the sad people that get that upset over a videogame and take the time out of their day to leave messages like those.
---
Stalking only halts for the person who sees him. That’s the easiest way to fix him imo.
---
That’s what rank 1 p3 Claudettes mean when they say “GG EZ baby Myers”
---
I cant upvote this whole thread enough!
---
thx dude.
---
Well I mean his ability is a bit lackluster so I kind of see why now a lil bit
---
Who were you using that's apparently pay to win?
---
Anyone who thinks hag is bad doesn't know how to play her. The type who commits to chases with 1 trap placed and only ever traps loops lmao
---
Finding the distance between two points is one line of code so I can't imagine lining up an angle to be too much more complicated.
---
I mean, the parodies are about as violent and serious as a Tom and Jerry cartoon.
---
Listen any killer that cant use his power is bad. It doesnt matter if they are a M1 killer. What Bhvr did was just not planned right. People who dont keep a critical eye are the reason legion was poorly recieved on launch. All bhvr really needs to do is just make him a 110 killee and buff the power significantly.
---
Jesus christ OP I think water came out of my nose from laughing. Fucking gj man. GJ
---
Yeah I playing back in 2016 but stopped for well over a year, came back and I'm loving him
---
I really enjoy sneaking up on people or even better, a group of people and watching them scatter. And me hunting 1 of them down.
---
Not sure how you're blind, but clearly coolknives is the asshole in this thread.
---
My heart is still broken.
---
If other killers could do as well and be as unstressful to play at high ranks, I’m sure people would love to play more varied killers. 
---
On console we don’t even get to play Nurse so we get even less variety than PC does. 
---
Spirit used to be played a lot more but the sounds have been messed up since they started the Unreal Engine update months ago so she’s not being played as much as she’s highly reliant on sounds of injured survivors etc.
---
Oh come on. You can’t leave a Killer piss-weak in order to ‘better’ other characters. He’s not in a great place at the moment, so he needs to be tweaked/buffed. 
---
If you’re worried about him making the other Killers obsolete, why not rally for Myers/Piggy buffs/changes? Don’t dumpster a new Killer just to protect others.
---
This is actually a perfect suggestion lmao
---
/u/peanits please forward this to the team
---
He doesn't feel any different. Why not just play Myers or pig
---
I feel attacked
---
Well not really, he isn't stumbling and falling on his face like an idiot every 5 seconds. I want that authentic Scream 1 Ghostface.
---
Like: 
---
Freddy, during the PTB. 
---
Spirit after her buff. 
---
Nurse, always. 
---
Billy, always. 
---
Plague, during the PTB. 
---
Legion, during and after the PTB. 
---
It’s extremely commonplace to see players screaming for nerfs, don’t just pretend it was Legion.
---
I love Drake and Josh memes
---
Exactly why I play him, getting right behind someone that doesn't even know I'm there and giving them the good old Bing Bong Bonk
---
Please don't hate my editting skills, I have nothing but paint and word to make my memes speak.
---
Leatherface.
---
I know it's a day light but i'm hoping someone sees this. 
---
Does The Plague swing her weapon differently? I don't know to explain it because she's the only one i've encountered this with. 
---
Every weapon has a swing feel like a wide Link-like swing, however since her weapon is a thurible it acts sort of like a realistic flail swing in that you'd swing it close to the base as to not lose control of it. 
---
So I guess what i'm asking is does she have the same length of M1 as every other killer or is it different?
---
Freddy probably ^^
---
Nah, he'll keep it as a memory.
---
They said it's not supposed to shut him down instantly the moment your camera swivels and somehow spots him. Your supposed to SEE him and hold contact for a few seconds. It isnt how it should be rn where you magically fuckin swivel and bup your donezo
---
I feel like this wasn't unintentional on Legion's side
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah, I normally just leave it alone but this was the third one tonight. I'm new but I've watch a ton of how to videos so I know my basics and strats for the killers I play.
---
I feel like I'm missing something, cause LF is always able to catch up to me. Is there some sort of trick to get away from him?
---
Why every licensed killer (not Michael) is shit?
---
pretty sure this ghostface is from the early 90s
---
if you cant get it on pc then ya its worth it, i play it on console and enjoy it a lot
---
YES! WE SHALL KEEP FIGHTING!!
---
Find literally any small object and loop him around it. His chainsaw hitbox is large and most players know it so they make it a huge point to avoid touching the tree, essentially making it impossible to catch up to you.
---
You’re right I just read the backstory and it said 60s yikes.
---
He can move at 115% speed during stealth for one, neither Myers or Pig can do that. Not only that but his stealth doesn't have a limiter on it aside from being visually spotted (ignoring the fact that it's glitched on the ptb currently). Pig's camera gets realllllly low to the ground and has delayed attacks during her stealth, Myers has a severely limited lunge and loses his stealth as he becomes stronger. I would argue that Ghostface will be a truly honest and brutal stealth killer in his final release, and different enough from Pig and Myers.
---
Kinda sad that the community went from loving that ghostface is in the game too utterly loathing that he offers nothing to the game besides the fact that hes just a licensed character.
---
I love the bell concept =)
---
Where is the contest info at? I'd be interested in reading about it.
---
I like the camera better
---
yup, retail steals your soul so the entity doesn't have to.
---
Can't wait
---
Whose side are you on OP?
---
Damn, I knew I shouldn't have posted this here :D.
---
The first scream was in the 90s so maybe they wanted ghostface to be from the 90s and cell phones didn't have cameras.
---
It was just in the shrine of secrets and I missed it. Feelsbadman
---
Scream is my favorite movie series, so I was beyond hyped to see he was coming, but I don't think many people (myself included) thought it would be anything but a fully licensed Scream chapter back when he was just an idea. Finding out it's only half licensed, with no survivor or map, doesn't even have his iconic robes, and is just another underwhelming killer (possibly the worst so far) is immensely disappointing.
---
For me, the theme of this chapter so far is disappointment.
---
Scuse me, what about Furtive Chase to have a 0-8m terror radius for Tier 2 Myers in a chase. (Depending on whether you put M&amp;A on or not.)
---
~~or a 4m huntress heartbeat while chasing~~
---
Yup. His stealth power can instantly be rendered useless if you look his way. I've played like 50 matches against him and saw his power work only a few times.
---
As of now he's just a basic M1 killer.
---
Pig=upvote.
---
He's cool, but they way overdid it with the "don't look at him!" limiter on his power. I don't see why it's even especially necessary since he  plays a louder than Spirit Whoosh obvious audio cue whenever he moves with the power on.
---
Yes, but the context matters. If she doesn't watch him play the game or sees scenes from the actual game all she knows is some goofy parodies that are very child friendly.
---
It's not a Polaroid. Polaroids are bigger and print out pictures. It's just a plain point and shoot.
---
Great line. Makes me sad the killer isn't licensed, but oh well.
---
Assuming the killer is good                         best killers(S teir) nurse,spirit 
---
Can be better than S if played right(A teir) Hilbilly,huntress,shape(this is including perks if not b teir)
---
Almost A teir just need some working on (B teir)trapper(if used good),clown,LF(if used good and gave us barbecue and chilli that earns good boy points)
---
(C teir),doctor,Ghostface, hag,pig
---
Almost the worst killers                              (D teir)legion,plague,wraith 
---
Shit just shit(F teir)Freddy or legion can switch
---
This is my opinion but if you can convince that some killers are better than others I might switch it up
---
That’s kind of a valid anger though. That’s not even comparable to being mad people who DC.
---
Dude, calm down. This game can be stressful, but you shouldn't be seeing Red like that
---
I mean every killer has a good specific counter. And I wouldn’t be surprised if they changed Object now because of it or his power to compensate. Like I said, all killers have a counter (for the most part). FE: The best counter to a Spirit is Iron Will. 
---
Don’t why I’m downvoted to all shit for speaking truth and logic. I love how this subreddit thinks everything should be cake and easy. 
---
That’s not how balance works. But ok, freak out out because “KiLlEr Is ToO hArD!”
---
Any possible pig buff means I am onboard.
---
Throw a fucking phone at them  
---
After they are hit, they are slowed down for a sec and exposed
---
Yeah, his title should've been something different. Like The Stalker or whatever
---
Old joke and meme is old
---
Plague isn't too bad in my opinion.
---
What the fuck do you do at grocery stores?
---
It's cool but whack how survivors can stop his power, from a survivor &amp; killer stand point. But I know they have to have something in place, otherwise he'd have the same power as Micheal pretty much. i know the dev's will definitly listen to what all the PC players have to say about his power from the PTB, so lets hope console players will get a better version. (I'm console) regardless, I'm still pretty excited to get chased &amp; killed by Ghosface. The Scream franchise is one of my fav movies ever. 
---
.
---
I agree that survivors should have to look directly at the killer like, their character itself not the camera. The way they have it now just defeats the purpose of him having a power i feel.
---
You lost me at Huntress being in Meta. 
---
Spirit. I think you meant Spirit.
---
And what will you do with it in 10 Yeats?
---
See perks like noed or ruin don’t actually synergize that well with any killer’s power. They instead just make the role of killer easier all around regardless of who they are. 
---
Like enduring+spirit fury is good on wraith, but it doesn’t really synergize well w his cloaking ability. On ghostface there really isn’t much in the way of perks that make his ability stronger or are strengthened by his ability.
---
I’m not saying there are no good perks on him, just that they aren’t particularly good because of his weird ass power
---
Yeah, after a while, you really start to understand why killers are such assholes in the game...
---
I had this happen yesterday.  
---
I was planning on giving the hatch, I dropped the survivor with that intention. 
---
*BAM* closes hatch. 
---
Chuckled to myself and tried to pick up the survivor and give her the gate and exit.  
---
... she DCed.
---
Huntress is still good but I wouldn't say she's top 3 killers. Nurse and Hilbilly will probably always be top tier killers regardless of what killers are introduced but the thing about those two killers is that it takes skill to play them. I'd die if my life depended on me getting one sacrifice as the nurse.
---
That's so stupid. The minute a killer starts acting suspicious, I know they just tryna farm and/or mess around which I'm here for lol. It's cool to get players that just don't care or just wanna have a funny game.
---
That's sad but I guess I'll have to get use to it since I'm a killer main.
---
He’s bugged, on test servers, and is subject to change.
---
Even after the Freddy rework I have my doubts that he'll even be close to Myers.
---
Changes are necessary but I don't think pointing should be a part of it, it just seems too memey for this game
---
&gt;Billy taking a ton of skill
---
Nurse definitely but Billy?  Nah, man.
---
How?
---
lol, sure... *bugged* not poorly designed.
---
It's **them**  
---
We have a list of like 3 years of reasons why that probably WONT happen  
---
(I still am hopeful, but c'mon)
---
Ok..good to know.
---
I agree that people discussing how to possibly fix his weaknesses is the point of the PTB, my main beef with the complainers is that BHVR openly acknowledged that he is bugged right now and people I guess don't know yet or are ignoring that and continuing to bitch about the bug... :(
---
New meta, every survivor runs OoO to try and counter the new killer. New new meta arises where killers run obsession destroying perks in response
---
The Dream Demon iirc
---
It's so funny. I was following ghost face and I kept taking his power away and hed stop and look around like where the f is that surv!!
---
 How do you release a killer before making sure his power actually works in ptb?  How embarrassing but they keep getting away with this non sense.
---
I didn't say it takes *a ton* of skill to play Billy but it does take more skill than a killer like Doctor.
---
*coughcough* https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bwzgpy/managed_to_get_it_perfectly/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Totally agree. How are you supposed to play stealthy, if survivors are playing with 3rd person and you only with 1st? This is a killer with power to teabag and that's all.
---
Normal Billy does take skill. Instasaw Billy can be used by a monkey.
---
Every ash player I’ve gone versus is a cocky looping SOB maybe I’m just unlucky though
---
That's so sad
---
yeah cause others are actual killers and not jokes
---
Yeah, it's bad enough right now, I had two different lobbies in a row that were claudettes and megs
---
This is gold. I expect to see 1000 plus upvotes when I wake up tomorrow.
---
You didn't actually explain *how* his power is broken, what's the issue exactly?
---
Idk high quality shit posting is when I read the post and don't realize it was satire until I think about it more. This post is just to easy.
---
It's currently on the Public Test Build, he's not been officially released yet, that's on June 18th.
---
Dark Devotion
---
pardon?
---
this meme supposed to mean a person on lower left corner is fuck ugly.
---
did you just call default Dwight fuck ugly??
---
So low-rank survivors needs DS, yet you're repeatedly hit with DS... So you're a low-rank killer?
---
sounds fun to me. I'm new to this game, but coming from years of DOTA, the developers seem REALLY timid with their balancing. The game, as it stands, feels balanced. However, it is only balanced among the killers and perks that are good. There's too much stuff that is flat out "trash tier" and releasing new stuff that is trash tier is pretty lame. By trying to hybridize new killers and even with the Freddy rework, they seem afraid to upset the existing balance to keep killers and survivors happy. But upsetting that balance is what is needed to push the game towards more diverse and ultimately more balanced gameplay. There are so many minor balance things I'd love to see implemented that could really make the game shine, but I get the impression there's more work to be done than resources to handle it all.
---
It only spawns when you do a certain amount of generators, or when you are the last one
---
Excuse me wtf
---
He literally says "Yeah my Buddy cute man"
---
I often find its the people who use streamers that tend to DC the most. I don't know why.
---
Pretty sure after three generators or if their are only two survivors left the hatch finally spawns
---
Top parenting letting a 9 year old play an 18+ game...
---
Next they’ll censor and make all the female survivors wear jumpers so they can protect the kids who shouldn’t be playing the game from the horrors of vest tops.
---
I think the survivors need to do MORE to stop ghostie and ghostie has no sounds or notifications that he is going in stealth mode. It makes it where, shockingly, you need to use STEALTH as ghostie to assure a good survivor cant see you and survivors need to be vigilant to stop instantly getting destroyed.
---
Yet one completely shuts down his whole power, Spirit has a harder time with IW, but can still use her power.
---
I don't know what you're talking about there's no one there who are they talking too?
---
\*NOTE\* Im sorry but I could not find the artist
---
*don't play the thing literally designed to give us info on the killer and how we can improve or fix said killer*
---
We have a genius here ladies and gentlemen.
---
Understandable. People can be such assholes
---
You know, I had a dream last night where I watched a YouTube video of someone playing the Ghost and saying he was bad.
---
Am I a prophet?
---
Oh yeah haha how could they release it to the PUBLIC TEST BUILD without TESTING his power beforehand
---
I get his power sucks but that’s the reason we have the path and not just the live build
---
The bug also allows you to cancel through walls and vision obstruction iirc :(
---
if they make the power actually very usable, imagine how every survivor will rage of how it's same as Beads on Spirit lol.
---
Its fine they just need to adjust the times, the look at mechanics need to be fixed
---
Joke is on all of us. We thought we were getting actual Ghost Face. But they were actually making the Ghost Face from Scary Movie (which infinitely better anyway).
---
Shes has a bit more use of her power...
---
Every other killer : Seen as dangerous, usually respected as being dangerous people who could kill us irl in only a couple seconds.  
---
Pig : Oink
---
I completely agree that Pinhead and Jeepers should've been in the game but many people wanted GhostFace more then them from what I seen so that's what we got also believe the guy that made Jeepers Creepers was harasser or something to that manner
---
Keep practicing op :) once you get better at looping, bubba won’t be able to chainsaw you and will be forced to smack you instead
---
Youjo Senki (aka "Saga of Tanya the Evil")
---
Maybe it would be interesting to have the skill checks fixed on the generator.  
---
So you wouldn’t see them if you are looking behind.  
---
You would have to rotate your camera back on the generator to see them.
---
That is adorable, well done OP  
---
Fun addition to the community and welcoming new people &lt;3
---
Solution - Wait until bugs are fixed and assess him then :)
---
I mean, running Plague with Boozle, spirit fury and Enduring, plus thana.  That hard counters teams who dont like to cleanse.  And those matches are fun.  They all have their merits in different contexts.
---
Pig is the deadliast, my spelling sucks, you cannot run away from her cuteness.
---
Will the collapse trigger if killer is standing still with survivor(s) stuck in basement?
---
Behavior,  the game's developer company.
---
At least one of them plays killer at mid-ranks. Not much, I know.
---
Let me speak to your manager...
---
I can't lie about the camping part haha most Leatherfaces seem to fit the stereotype.  I assume they want someone to come for the save so they can try for a double down or something. 
---
But like the other fella said, Leatherface is easily loopable.  He only becomes threatening when he's playing the basement properly.
---
The big oink energy from commenting on your grammar IN the original text post is compelling
---
For the hatch to be visible you have to complete a gen for each person who is alive +1. So for four people the hatch will only become visible after all the gens are done.
---
Which is why they’re testing it in the PTB before they release it.
---
Yeah I'd definitely hope so, but that's rarely if ever been the case for other Killers on the PTB.  It'll be minor adjustments at best.
---
It's not the greatest test build when his ability just doesn't work. The developers couldn't have played a few matches beforehand and realised how broken he is?
---
Really? I must've lost track of my dates then, I thought he ghostface was released when his nice trailer hit.
---
I don’t know what a silver coin is but I’ll take it as a good thing lol, thanks kitty :) 
---
So far tonight, I’ve had a lot of positive comments from other players having a fun time, hopefully I can get some more epic ones like I did with this kid :D
---
10/10 survivor, will carry that twinkish ass to the hatch every game.
---
'All four toxic players died a good death.'
---
Need I say more?
---
No prob dude, this is a very emotional game for a lot of ppl xd
---
Oh fuck the PTSD is back. Where’s Reznov?
---
Peanits confirmed he's bugged, so he'll be better by launch.
---
Beyond that, it only took 5 months for Legion to be reworked.
---
lmao
---
ghostface ayyy
---
Dead realm Poggers
---
My oinkgirl is equal to an upvote.
---
I wondered this too! So I asked. Turns out Ghostface and the Scream franchise are owned by different people. Who knew right? So they’d have to get two different licenses. Unlike the Halloween chapter where all characters are owned by the same people.
---
I cannot unsee this now
---
I remember once I was playing against The Spirit &amp; the person had that one add-on for her phasing where the noise is silent when she's phasing. She came up right behind me &amp; grabbed me. I love moments like that tho. It really gives the horror factor to the game i feel. Micheal always scares me when the person is just far away stalking &amp; you shiftinf your camera &amp; you go back to one spot you were previously looming at &amp; ge just so happens to have been there ALL OF A SUDDEN. Lmao. There have been some moments where The Pig has scared me. The Hag's phantasm traps DEFINITLY always make me startled for sure bc i feel the trap trigger noise is just fucken ear rape or my headset i use for playing is just good.
---
We need more secret offerings.
---
uuugh, imagine red rank plays, man. those who have enough situational awareness to counter Beads Spirit and Scratched Mirror Myers.
---
It's ghost face though. Definitely fits his theme. Plus I definitely think making the emotes more viable is a good idea.
---
10/10 lad, would buy pizza from again
---
Samination's humour is just very bland and obvious, but the tattoo looks cool.
---
Nah that is not true, not all survivors are the same, just because some surv likes easy wins doesn’t mean everyone do.
---
I find ez win pretty boring
---
Hole life
---
Kill your friends
---
Its kill ya friends
---
So annoying. Sadly, it's inevitable to get away from these types of players.

My sweet summer child, you will wait much more.
---
ThAnk you for the vAluAble informAtion
---
What do you mean by "old small game"? I stopped playing for 3 months sometime last year &amp; it was during the time when I guess a bunch of perks got buffed. So i'm not even sure of the full list of perks that were changed.
---
Sorry, Myers. I think I found my snoot girl
---
That would be awesome!
---
I realize that. But again, like I said PTB will most likely cause them to change something. Like giving him the immunity that Freddy has against Alert when in stalk unless you’re looking DIRECTLY at him. Or making it range based. Like if you’re too far away, object won’t detect him. They already cater to Killers a lot to begin with, and rework stuff to do so as well. Give it time. They’ll “fix” it. 
---
And with that, IM OUT.
---
&gt; Well Amanda was always failure until she came to DBD
---
Damn. Delete this because if she reads it she might self harm again :(
---
"Good" is an incredibly subjective definition when it comes to Killers because there can be quite a bit of bias + unrealistic expectations when considering a Killer "good".
---
Sole survivor effects bbq once 2 people are dead, it lets you be 8 meters farther without being seen.
---
Why are you showing pictures of my girlfriends family?
---
Ugh...the bait is lazy.
---
One question:
---
Did. You. Learn. Anything. From. The. Legion. PTB?
---
Yass Bing Bong Boi is #1
---
Also when levelling your bloodweb focus on "Swift Hunt" and "Windstorm" add ons, theyre the key to really being effective in game, keep slaying dude
---
Is there anything about Jakes long hair?
---
You really think the phone fits with the DbD universe? The camera change was great, and makes a lot of sense with his lore.
---
I mean 2016 small game that literally just made the traps visible.
---
Have fun losing the game then, coming from a killer main
---
Why not
---
&gt; I believe pig is Available with shards 
---
I don't think you can unlock any licensed character with shards. Only with Auric cells.
---
Does it really tho? I doubt "doing selfies with a phone that shouldn't exist at that time" is a part of Scream's copyright
---
&gt; It cost them only a couple of hundred hours in working time. Which is nothing, sure dude.
---
Pretty sure OP was referring to the cost of the player. Meaning they didn't have to pay extra for the rework.
---
Yeah, your right ;-;
---
I read this as “when you a boof generator”
---
No Sidney was a MAJOR disappointment.
---
You just can't have Ghostface without Sidney. That said, I don't consider this floozy as the real Ghostface.
---
&gt; Furtive Chase is a fucking worthless meme. Why would you need a reduced terror radius while in a chase? Literally what Killer cares about their Terror Radius while in a chase?
---
Pre-rework Freddy?
---
This is like when people try to compare Laurie (2018) to Ash (in AVED) like she is awesome and I do love her character!!! But his kill count is... way higher.  &gt;!She doesn’t even have confirmation on her one 1 kill!&lt;
---
Hope they won't. DBD really is a somewhat special game for me. Would be pissed seeing it abandoned
---
Nobody makes memes because he is a meme by itself at this point.
---
Grass grows, birds fly’s, sun shines, and brother I repair gens.
---
You reading the post title: I'm about to end this mans whole career
---
I mean you’re not wrong. Devs really dropped the ball so far. Hopefully they’ll figure some shit out.
---
When is the rework? It’s not in the PTB right?
---
Yes bullying killers IS fun!
---
He wasn't OP in release. He was slightly better than this current freddy but it was because No one knew how to play him at all because he was probably the second killer where you cannot see him. So everyone complained about him. But the nerfs that impacted him was the movement and the dream state nerfs that was needed for Freddy.
---
F tier lul
---
Doesn't make it any less bullshit
---
Yeah his power just shouldn’t be affected by survivors. It’s fucking stupid.
---
Same here, only seen streams as I’m away from my ps4 til August when I get back stateside. Definitely agree on tracking perks. His power seems to shine in and around the tougher structures like jungle gyms or the building on swamp maps. Any structure where line of sight can be regularly broken really.
---
Also thinking about addons. Personal hypothesis is that recovery speed addons are the way to go but haven’t had any opportunity to confirm it.
---
Don’t bully my boy plz, he has a rough childhood
---
Calm Spirit didn't prevent screaming when Doctor was released
---
Pretty much pig but with no reverse bear traps to slow the game down.
---
I have no clue where you got the idea that you can with every killer by simply being good but ok.
---
I heard that weird flappy noise before I saw him, went to crawl away, crouched still for a moment realising he's right in front of me, jumped out of my boots. Scared me shitless.
---
I would assume people do the most important thing which is to check the controls for the game before playing.
---
I suppose now though we're in an age where we can put the users own key combo onto a loading screen tip. So lets do that.
---
other mechanics you either learn from doing, seeing others do, or from reading in-game text. 
---
and last i saw you can't read up what a killer is capable of without owning that character or going to out-of-game resources... which sucks.
---
You touch the Pig you die.
---
Well it is also nice if a game, which you paid money for, has developers that at least seem to try and release new content that is acceptable by the community. GF in this state is a joke, it’s release in this manner either tells us they didn’t even play a game with him themselfs or they would have noticed half the feedback the community is giving. We are all inclined with the production and functioning of dead by daylight but when people do bad things, don’t expect supoirtive reactions. If my brother suddenly started doing drugs I would be mad and not giving him credit because drugs are so addictive and he is trying to fix it.
---
Because this game has to be balanced around survivors. If they release a killer that’s actually strong the babies start to “REEEEEEEE MUH COUNTERPLAY”
---
Seems balanced
---
"Paragraph" is a term referred to by fans. Leatherface's DLC was just called "Dead By Daylight - Leatherface"
---
switch to PC masterrace
---
Better he is weak in the ptb so they tweak him to make him better rather than bringing him out too powerful and nerfing him to the ground
---
Staring directly at him, for a full second, will not be super weak. If the rumors are true and it is based solely on the actual body position then if you come up from behind they would have to get off to look at you.
---
I don't see what this has to do with his power being absurdly situational to the point of it being almost useless.
---
Guess I’ll just down the unhooked and count to 60 then. Fuck it.
---
Yeah I feel that, it’s all based on community response. It’s kinda weird to see that Freddy’s gonna be getting a buff this season. It may be just me but I feel like he’s overpowered when I play as him.
---
Streamer privilege
---
I'm doubtful the killer would win. A high tier killer means if you can play killer well you should be able to take this killer into higher ranks. Of course we arent seeing a lot of freddy mains at rank 1 even though I've seen a guy that mained freddy into rank 1 before the plague update and midchapter patch. It's not common for average players to learn a weak killer in and out and then still not have issue from lack of ability. I keep hearing ghostface is bugged so I'm going to assume some of his issues have to do with that but if you can cancel his ability by looking at him that is kind of useless. I have played a few stealth killers and sometimes it's useless. You can be in a perfect spot stalking with micheal and they will see you just about everytime unless they just arent looking which isnt often. When I'm survivor I use spinechill and I have never had issues with stealth killers being sneaky.
---
I faced him and now he’s crying, hugging the frank. He just wanted to be a good killer(
---
deathgarden is still a good game lol
---
Was just thinking the same damn thing.
---
Like three killers have a one shot. The rest are ehh.
---
True, but it's easier to make the point by calling her a priestess.
---
Ability: can crouch
---
The whole point of ghost face is it can be any asshole with a mall, though.
---
Disagree. Yeah Nurse is really powerful but that doesnt mean that you cant counter her. No perks no add ons or item, 4 good swf on coordination and she would probally end up with 2 kills, maybe 3. And thats just nurse. Every other killer would end up with 0 if they dont hardcore tunnel wich is the most fun thing in the world
---
Noone cares, because a lower terror radius in a chase is basically worthless, even if you didn't lose all your tokens every time you kill an obsession. You're not going to run it instead of M&amp;A, and running it with M&amp;A is a meme build.
---
That was a complaint a friend of mine had. I remember him yelling "How the fuck does this 19 year old edgelord pick up this 200 pound middle aged man with one goddamn hand?"
---
Wish i would be the air between them..
---
I like Nurse's Calling and BBQ icons the most probably.
---
And... wtf is deathgarden and why is everybody talking about it right now?
---
The plague is pretty good.
---
:{
---
abbacchio joins the kicking
---
From what I've read from other people, part of the issues with GF is that he's bugged so he's not meant to be as weak as the bug is making him. Bugs happen especially when you're putting out a test version of your new content before an official release.
---
I would also argue that the whole point of a PTB is to help make sure the new content IS acceptable by the community before you start charging people for it.
---
I never said you have to be purely supportive of what they put out. The first sentence of my post is literally  
---
    I have no problem with people complaining about whats not working with him.
---
I only said that the people getting all worked up like they committed some great offense against us need to tone it down a little and give them time to fix the bugs and adjust some of the numbers on his ability if need be before they decide to boycott the new DLC.
---
Wraith
---
Not really, Jaime sort of forgot about this knight.
---
I don't think his weapon helps, seems like he would need to beat you a lot to do it.
---
This cutie deserve the hatch
---
That wasn’t the question though? You asked who’d be the nicest and wouldn’t enjoy my pain
---
Michael. He takes no sympathy, no last words or dialogue. Slash and dash
---
Just don’t Mori the default Dwight
---
No I asked who would end you the quickest, Wraith might want to do it the quickest but cannot do it given his weapon.
---
Id say Leatherface, but I think he did try to keep his prey alive for his family at first in the Original movie.
---
Is this meme, or actual big dumb?

Ghostface: \*goes into stealth\*  
---
Also Ghostface:  
---
#"BEEN HERE ALL ALONG!"

If I remember the movies correct, if you fight back enough he might just kill you, if you are to weak he keeps you.
---
excuse me sir, im kinda new and butt stallion is also my queen, milord. could you tell me, how to insert such a quote next to my name? 
---
greetings
---
I think everything Freddy related will be in the halfway update or whatever it’s called
---
Maybe we could wait until the looping gets nerfed before knowing this.
---
It does spark joy for me.
---
Maybe the whole world didn’t grow, maybe you shrunk.
---
I love that the title reads exactly like the principal skinner meme.
---
Combine both of those with pharmacy and you have a good chance at an instaheal on first chest
---
The fuck? Pig is actually underrated
---
I don't think Kevin Williamson ever had a vision of what the killer would look like when he was writing Scream. Just that it be something anyone could buy.
---
Why you dont ignore them?
---
Why wasting time with such garbage?
---
I cant dead hard into a wall without getting closer￼
---
Tbf that IS how you counter him.
---
Nobody cleanses if they know what they're doing.
---
The result is that you have an M1 killer who is great at keeping people injured, but has no way of downing people outside of running them down.
---
That's all Plague has, since the devs balance her around corrupt purge, an ability you just don't get to use.
---
Legion has that, and additionally he can slow the game, track survivors, and cover long distances with his power.
---
I mean I could still kill with him because hes a 4.6ms killer who can hide his red stain. 
---
That dosnt mean that stalking isnt pointless.
---
i'm glad i'm often the only Jane !
---
^i ^kill ^every ^other ^Jane ^player ^i ^meet ^so...
---
Make your choice
---
Welcome to the club, pal.
---
I'm sorry, where is the F tier of "I literally have to swap killers to leave the menu open because this goddamn hoover of death won't shut her noise hole?"
---
I can understand people getting upset about the lack of content due to licensing but honestly I side more with the devs for this
---
It would probably be extremely expensive for them to use the full scream licence so it's no wonder they compromised to bring at least the iconic character to the game
---
As a killer though he's disappointing
---
AMEN!
---
I mean you can use several of the addons to start with some corrupted pools. But I understand where you're coming from. Thank you for explaining your point of view.
---
Thats adorable, but remember that this game is 18+, its easy to forget it sometimes :p
---
#WAAAAAHHHH!!!
---
Why would you disrespect a veteran christian from 1478! You should be ashamed of yourself!
---
It’s a bug lol
---
Yeah, but now you can have the knowledge the Legion is having just as little fun.
---
^smol ^oink
---
Sprint burst is the worst exhaustion perk imo.
---
It forces you to walk everywhere or else you'll waste it. And at lower ranks, every second counts. 
---
With Lithe, most of the time you're never too far away from a vault to get the speed boost, and with Balanced Landing you can run some good loops/infinites. Dead Hard grants you a second chance if you mess up when in a chase, and it can close distance between yourself and a pallet or vault.
---
It means only one at a time. DS already switches the obsession
---
Thank god
---
Why would you care if they got rid of moonwalking? It’s dumb tbh.
---
Probably part of the licensing
---
#Yeats
---
They need to copy everyone's save, so they do it two days in advance
---
He’ll sure as shit be better than he is now
---
I just hope that Freddy is actually scary again and that'll the do Ghost Face justice
---
A whole map that's just one corridor long with gens inbetween and the exit gates on both ends.
---
Imagine thinking Doctor is a weakest killer, lmao
---
Then why post it here??
---
Infectious Fright.
---
*i didnt bother searching who the artist is
---
Great, now people will say I'm just joining the bandwagon if I do it too.
---
What do you mean? As in motivation or kills? Because boy do I have some great ideas for kills.
---
Nothing set in stone yet, but he's becoming a high-mobility killer. He can teleport to gens (after a four second SFX of the gen spitting out oil). Survivors fall asleep semi-randomly, they don't have to get hit by his power. They're also playing with the ability to either plant hag-style "slow" traps, and/or fake pallets.
---
Good good... let the hate flow through you!
---
It is definitely harder for me to moonwalk on the PTB but it might be just because I get only laggy killers
---
damn, this is a nice idea I do not see anything wrong with it. although I guess we would be seeing a lot of points in all caps saying THIS SWF IS TOXIC lol
---
What if the survivor stops repairing after they get downed? The gen they were on gets blocked and the killer decides to not check it.
---
Or if it isn't blocked but the survivor leaves the gen immediately? The killer checks a gen long abandoned.
---
Nothig tremors does that makes it worth running over BBQ
---
Meh, I think ghostface is equal to the pig. Pig can rush, and once the instant power removal is fixed, ghostface can stalk properly.
---
Devour soap or Iron maiden
---
Besides LOS no heartbeat during a chase he's i need of some work. Survivors literally just swivel camera and counter your power.
---
This can have a double meaning.
---
1. Now Ghosty is the F Killer, not Freddy
---
2. Freddy gives him an F to pay respect to his uselessness
---
the kind of design which comes from people who want to tell you how you should play
---
Okay, I reaaaally want these perks
---
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA! Za Warudo! Toki wo tomare!
---
“Some would be nice and do it quick”
---
I wouldnt really put this "Ghostface" in the same category as other licensed killers, they only got the rights for the mask but not the character. I'm willing to bet this killer would have turned out different if they got rights to both

---
I’d like this a lot because it would let us know if it was just our overall performance or if they were just a really well coordinated team when we get wrecked.
---
Can't confirm. Plague is awesome. You don't even need the blood vomit to down people. It sure helps a lot but just hitting with your normal puke and than give them a slap with the censer is good too because vomiting doesn't slow you down as much as a hit. Also, most if the survivors I come across do cleanse themselfs
---
I have Feng P3 all perks, Nea, Claudette &amp; Ace P3 all perks minus Ash plus Dwight, Laurie &amp; David with perks upto ANOEs DLC. 
---
My point is just having one perk reduces a grind, makes balancing easier as ultimately you are not trying to scale three different versions of it &amp; with upcoming stuff can enable to make more content towards that whilst making leveling mutliple survivors/killers at same time.
---
for this game to survive, you need a healthy influx of new players, with more DLCs that grind ain’t getting shorter.

Myself and my horrible juking skills.
---
Yes and??? We don't know the numbers, but we know how this devs make killers.

" Its like those little mechanics in games that make it so much better. (like bunnyhopping for example) "

---
They could also fix his add-ons that do absolutely nothing(chili) and fix the under tuning on his knife scratches and the beast's marks add-ons.
---
Ive done some more testing and I agree. Its still very possible to moonwalk and do it for a long time but you cant with bad latency.
---
you'll miss her haircut tho
---
Where my trapper mains??
---
Honestly, I’m convinced David could body most of the killers. Maybe not the bigger ones like Trapper and Meyers, but  the female killers couldn’t stand a chance if he could disarm them. 
---
A 4-man SWF David squad would be the killer.
---
well… Ruin is supposed to only offer you a breath during the early game. If it does more there is an issue with survivors.
---
Lithe is probably the worst exhaustion perk lol. Doesn't help you get to a loop. Once you're at a loop a random 3 second Sprint burst on the first vault of three is completely worthless. So many monto videos with lithe users straight just leaving a good loop on the first lap because lithe kicks in lmao. 
---
Sprint burst is only good against stealth killers and only if you literally don't look around you. 
---
Dead hard is really good. If you mess up a mind game you get a second chance. Not gonna lie though 90% of the time it does nothing, exhausts you and then you seizure on the ground. Kinda unusable for close calls due to lag. 
---
BL is the best hands down. Literally two perks in one with stun reduction and a Sprint burst. Makes swamp playable. Haddonfield is god mode. The game McMillan and red forest have very strong loops with BL. Yeah rotten fields and shelter woods it's wasted but 2 out of 15ish is a dam good ratio.
---
Never said bhvr made good choices.
---
What changed?
---
you can pick the 3 of them with Ruin. Which is a very common build so...
---
I should just become a survivor.. I dont think I could do generators doe..
---
You're probably better off on /r/writing...
---
but you'll miss his thiccness...
---
Cosplayers wet dream
---
Console nurse is trash compared to PC, it wont look like much for People who play on pc, but it is a rare sight to see this
---
There's about a 0.00000000000000001% chance that a toddler is going to connect any dots - subconsciously or otherwise - from a goofy animated show with cartoon violence, to anything of consequence.
---
Think back to your life prior to age 5 and tell me what you were shown that's shocked you so deeply and utterly that you're here talking this nonsense.
---
This would make lesser perks viable too! And more dangerous, like hex lullaby and unnerving presence. I would love this
---
That’s true! I really hope Ghostface will be the same way and Spirit won’t seem like the exception to the rule. I’m so excited for this killer to be added to the roster that I just hate the idea of him being the new Legion or Freddy.
---
Isn’t that the entire purpose of the PTB? So they can recognize when things are too strong and they can adjust accordingly. 
---
I guess the same logic applies for things that are too weak
---
Wtf is a "sona"? Is it short for persona? And if it is, what does it mean? Is it like a fursona but not furry? I am confused.
---
Jazzy, that is not a steampunk suit, thats a P.I.M.P.
---
Idiots apparently, I still get routine disconnects every bloody match. I run nurse's with thanatophobia because why not and they DC right off.
---
Not really. Her power comes from the corrupted purge but any survivor worth their salt won't cleanse unless the doors are opened, so you'll play as a m1 killer most of the time.
---
Any killer can be played the same and just M1 everyone even nurse, doesn’t mean they should be, it means they have no choice because their power sucks.
---
Didn’t mettle get a huge buff in the ptb ?
---
I would say that's a bad excuse because releasing it to the public without testing it in-house is dumb, but the devs are well known for being really bad at their own game so they probably did try.

Thats fair enough but its kind of hard who you would consider giving the cosmetics to. For example on my dwight meg claud and nea i have everything except ashs perks tier, would that mean i dont get the cosmetics? also my laurie has 3 pages of perks tier 3 but after that it is tier one to two but i was still a long grind getting that many perks tier 3 so would that be elligible? This is probably one of the main reasons the devs wouldn’t do this
---
Got tier two to exactly 99%
---
To be honest, going againts him is also boring af so he definitely needs a buff
---
Happy pride
---
The perks aren't even good like who the fuck fast vaults out of terror radius without Quick &amp; Quiet unless they're intentionally trying to get the killers attention which is basically doing what the survivor wants
---
Maybe he needs to be in roughly the center of a survivor’s vision and for it to be couple of seconds as well? Idk clunky but might work
---
Wait ? It’s not a flip phone anymore ? It’s now a camera ?
---
Eat a dick
---
They know, but they also know that if they don't complain, BHVR will just let it slide because they think people like the new killers.
---
If it's that inconsequential then you don't need it at all, so the whole complaint is pointless, no?
---
GoDD DAMMIT BOY YAH RUINED THE DOOR!
---
Whats ghostfaces abilities?
---
"Should I perform a mori on him?"
---
It's funny how object of Obsession literally destroys his power the entire match. Why the fuck do aura reading perks even WORK on him and why do they disable his power? He should be fucking immune to detection perks like Myers in tier 1.
---
Oh shit, I missed that. I love Wraith, that could be fun to play around with.
---
# *INTENSE WIND SOUNDS*
---
^(Ghostface: steathy :))
---
Signed
---
There would ultimately have to be some form of cut off,  My say would be anyone who has all t3 perks (exluding current DLC release) would be eligible. 
---
With the date announcement of the changes anyone who wants to grind characters for this could then get grinding it. 
---
For killers I would say a cosmetic weapon of some form.
---
Doesn’t mirror just increase score in-game AKA does nothing at all to your points?
---
Gotcha. I’m on console, so wasn’t quite sure, but thought I saw something like that.
---
I love dark devotion
---
Haha thanks dude. Yeah, there's a lot of toxic survivor behaviour that people conveniently forget to be honest. I never forget. :D
---
Legion isn't that bad imo. I double pip with him a lot. That's not me saying I'm a good killer because if I play killers like trapper, wraith or plague I'm more likely to saftey pip than actually pip.
---
Signed!
---
Also sounds like my coworker who keeps getting caught on his phone.
---
*laughs in Huntress, Hillbilly, and Trapper*
---
WAIT WHAT?!  HOLY FUCK
---
wait hold on, do you still get faster movement speed while downed when you vault a window while using lithe.
---
Just have faith! :l
---
probably standing still XD
---
Still doesn't give you the haste though, so it's not perfect.
---
Haha, yeah. But you have to have playtesters, even if it's just your own staff, to test for balance, bugs, glitches, etc.
---
Seriously it was OK trash at 16 but now its 8...its useless. Maybe when it was 30 to begin with it was a little much...but comeon...way to make a perk useless.
---
I'm betting history will repeat itself and they'll rework him in like a year because everyone agrees he's trash.
---
finally an appropriate use of your vomit
---
do it again
---
I mean, *it's not wrong*...
---
~~In fact, it encourages players to go above and beyond by actually looking at Ghost Face instead of just having him in the camera.~~
---
~~Yes, I know that's a bug, but still.~~
---
Seems fair but alot of the community aswell would not enjoy this
---
I suppose a GPU that doesn't support DX 11 won't be able to launch the game. On the other hand, I plat on a GT 610 which is a really bad GPU yet it supports up to DX 12. After some tweaks in the config file. It runs at 30+ FPS. Though the graphics are really bad. So maybe you'll need a new GPU.
---
His points directly counter yours and explain why they're not good but sure.
---
I remembered you guys have to buy huntress but not that you get hag and doc free
---
Ghostface is not F-Tier. He is G(ostface)-Tier
---
I don’t get it why don’t they just make new killers OP
---
I wouldn’t really use build 1 because you could just mind game the survivors by standing still.
---
I gues that they're trying to tell that it doesn't have to be op to be fun
---
Uhhh the one you are seeing is level 1 that means its 8 meeters, level 2 is 12, level 3 is 16....
---
He’s pretty bad compared to other killers. Only killers I’d say he’s better than are bubba, wraith, and current freddy
---
Son thats the level one perk.
---
Like I said, I like variety and this perk appeals to me.
---
Besides, how could I possibly argue for a perk I've only used in 3 games?
---
Survivors didn't instantly Wake Up when healed from the dying state or when Adrenaline activated and Freddy wasn't slowed down while putting Survivors to sleep.
---
I've heard the latter was a bug, but the former two combined with his built in aura-reading made Freddy the Slug Master. He could see as soon as someone was picked up and then just return to slug them again and sleep their healer.
---
I really really love the concept of Security!. A perk that let's you somehow benefit off of the killers perks and powers has some really interesting mind game and depth potential
---
I cuddle it.
---
Jed Olson leaked character model?!
---
Because even if I use moris and map offerings the game still ends. I just tested with the shroud
---
Based on some other reports, you don’t need to actually see him, your camera just needs to cover his portion of the screen he’s in (I.e, works through walls). So if anyone just spins their camera around every 3 seconds, you’re screwed.
---
And here we witness a man's spirit and hope being devoured by game bugs and underpowered design.  
---
Truly, BHVR is the entity IRL.
---
“But who would do it the quickest”
---
Love a good rick &amp; Morty reference
---
The instant cancel is a confirmed bug.
---
Here comes the trapper
---
Have you seen a Nurse nod furiously? I think it's on par with tbagging.
---
I mean the devs are bad at their own game so they probably didn’t realise how bad he was which is fine really, because after working on a game for x hours do you want to go home and play even more every day?
---
Perfectly.
---
Triganomanomaticatry.
---
How is he so stupid RLY?!?
---
You predicted the inevitable.
---
imo he's good, not the best killer, but not the worst.
---
Legion is ok now not overly op or garbage just ok. For perks I have no fucking clue besides maybe a anti healing build?
---
You're sick of people complaining about complaining so you are complaining about complaining about complaining
---
That's some complain-ception
---
Lockers. So many survivors will work on agen until a few seconds before someone gets hooked and hide in a locker. The perk isn't ass like you make it out to be. Not BBQ good, but it definitely is interesting.
---
A lot of people don’t like him bc he’s kind of a nuisance (the game really turns into a m1 simulator with him)
---
Thanatophobia works well with him because survivors don’t heal against him and thanat forces them to heal, SB works too with thanat so if they do decide to heal it takes longer.
---
Survivors shouldn’t even be able to take him out of shroud by looking at him at all.  It should function just like Myers stalk.
---
Love all these ideas, great job.
---
when a boof you generator
---
I mean it's not super recent but within the last 3 months that it's been like that. It's not an argument or anything my dude, it's just how it is now. You can go and check for yourself. It used to be the way you're describing but for the last 3 months it's been this way. You need to double pip. 
---
So what you said might have been correct like 3 months ago, yes. But for someone asking the question about getting the achieve NOW, it would not be correct. 
---
Just had a look. Seems like it's been this way since April:

---
Again, I'm not chatting out my ass, I was going through this pain last night trying to get another adept achievement. It's very irritating to get right now for killers :(
---
When I saw this I screamed, that’s way better than a new killer omg
---
Fresh meat should be decreased to 2/4/8  meters, imagine being able to see a survivor healing from 48 meters away with nurses. Paired with monitor &amp; abuse would be great for stealth killers like pig
---
It's absolutely more than a line.
---
What's the range of the point?
---
What's the acceptable degree it can be off to work?
---
How would it interact with terrain, especially with Ghost Face being able to learn? What about if he's crouched behind a low wall, should the point work just because the camera can see him, even though his body is blocked by the wall?
---
Does it check for ghost face on the first point of the finger? Is it channeling the entire animation? How long does GF need to be visible for?
---
What if part of GF's body is revealed but not the mask?
---
 What happens if GF reveals himself mid point animation?  
---
Different characters also have different animations for full health and injured.
---
Since the year 1478 didn't tip you off the first read?
---
Lol I have trust issues in game as I get a 3 man swf a lot and the problem is that they Sabo your hooks and disrespect you but the other player if they using a toolbox medkit or flashlight the. I will they branch bnp or insta heal
---
They always do this.  They test their stuff with Rank 20 potatoes in mind, they fail to apply any common sense to what they are releasing, and then they are surprised when the reaction to the new content is overwhelmingly negative.  You would think that after so many things like Spirit, Legion, Hallowed Blight, etc. that they would start *at least trying*; but apparently they are fine with ruining their anniversary event rather than effecting the game's meta in any way, shape, or form.
---
I will very disappointed if we do not get rewards or anything
---
Exactly how many layers would it remove other than grind and frustration due to unlocking a perk only to find it borderline useless at level 1? The tier system adds nothing to the game other than unnecessary padding. You having spent bloodpoints unlocking everything shouldn't be a justification for keeping a flawed system.
---
Tapp, David, Kate and Quentin
---
That’s a gay marty
---
Question: I know you get blindness while in a locker, but does being in a locker and looking at him will in stealth mode deplete the power as well?
---
You refer to wraith and spirit as ghost? It’s spooky bitch and bing bong come on!
---
Hah no more room.
---
My worst nightmare
---
The thing about this is that it's not exactly exclusive to the game even if you've lost taste of the game in the future. Theres no "dead by daylight" written there and can still remain relevant as an awesome figure doodle !
---
Jazz... jazz hands
---
Detected.
---
Plague should be higher. She is lore friendly and also talks.
---
thanks
---
The $1,000,000 question: Are people upset with this PTB still going to buy the dlc?  I would love to see people actually refuse to purchase it until they fix the guy; but I feel like people are actually just going to buy the thing regardless of how bad it is on release.
---
I was thinking maybe put a distance on the cancellation? Like ghostface has to be X meters away and the survivor has to turn their body and look DIRECTLY at the killer at Y meters to cancel it. 
---
Also maybe when ghost face is in Stalking mode, OoO doesn’t work against him
---
hes total trash...survivor GLANCES at you for 1 millisecond and your power is gone...they could just be looking around not knowing you are there and BOOM...gone...so damn dumb. and the lean mechanic is trash...
---
Mettle got a huge nerf, it was broken beforehand.
---
I had a game yesterday where I burned a survivor pudding and two survivors brought BPS, first time ever my game has crashed while loading :(
---
Pair it with BS and Shadow dance and you can catch survivors after breaking pallets.  This is baller
---
How so ? You get get two stacks from one unhook now ?
---
I think it adds bonus deviousness and brutality to your hits to make up for not getting points through stalking and potentially not getting as many hits because of slower movement speed and low lunge range.  It only makes it easier to hit the 8k cap.
---
At least you saw one in your life. On a screen, but let's say it counts.
---
I mean, Myers has to stalk you longer because he gets a lot more out of it, and he can do while your staring directly at him. Personally, I think ghostface should at least keep stalking progress between stalks, you know, if it's gonna stay this strict. If it doesn't, I still think he should get some partial reward for getting most of a stalk, like myers does. Now, If I had my way, I'd rework the power. I'd make it so Ghostface gets slowed in his power to 110%, but it's a toggle, and getting spotted doesn't end the power, it just makes it so the exposed status doesn't fill while he's being observed during stalking.
---
Am I the only one who does a hatch fakeout?
---
Take the survivor close to the hatch to give them false hope then turn around and hook them.
---
Oh I believe it. The past few SWF I got paired with would leave the gen if I didn’t make room for the third and go do another one across the map. They would body block and everything. I just ran around cleansing totems while they disconnected after pissing the killer off with their antics.
---
I think once Ghostface is fixed properly, then we can judge, but miss piggy is above him as of right now.
---
When I camp as Leatherface, I’m just cosplaying him like he was in the original movie.  If they don’t come into my basement, they don’t get chainsawed.  Simple as that.
---
Phillip isn’t going to be happy when he comes back to the hookers.
---
bitch you blind
---
Im the only one who thinks that this looks terrbile? Dont get me wrong,i like tattoos and the most important thing is that HE likes it but IMHO making a tattoo with a cartoon character is laughable and cringy.
---
I think the big dumb is here to stay
---
Nah fam, I'm broke and I can't just burn 8€ on something that I won't enjoy
---
*luaghs in dream demon*
---
What the fuck?!
---
Who is the girl in first scream that you are referring to? They were two guys, from what I remember
---
I'm not sick of complaining at all, my post is a reason for why telling people to wait until release to complain is unjustified and baseless.
---
Sorry, but Ghostface isn't the real Ghostface with just the mask. Could have gotten a map or a proper outfit instead of just a licensed mask :&lt;
---
The most interesting killers are the ones that can interacte with the power: Pig, Plague, Doctor etc
---
They don't want every killer to compete with nurse/billy but they don't want to release broken killers. Nobody would buy the new killers if they would be garbage from the getgo.
---
"The Ghost Face" is trash right now and we have all right to be afraid of his release after that whole Legion debacle.
---
Nurses Calling and Thantaphobia
---
Would be painful in a chase
---
There's nothing wrong with liking or disliking certain aspects of the horror genre, but that's not what OP said. They're out here making false statements, so that's kind of problem. Scream is one of Craven's best. It's been noted as such in horror history for quite a while now. Saying it, "sucks" is not only disrespectful, it's wrong. OP could have simply said, "I didn't enjoy the film."
---
Sole Survivor? Funny of you to assume people run that, or I’m incredibly out of the loop
---
Gonna hazard a guess that op is only apart of 2 gaming communities one being this one and the other being league of legends.
---
Or survivors can point at the ghost, making it depleted instantly. This opens up potential for choice making. Stare at him for 5 seconds maybe, or stop what you’re doing and point. And if you’re on a totem, you have to choose to stop and reset the progress, or continue and get marked.
---
As a can of soup, I'd like to see Campbell's removed.
---
The Doctors laugh kills me instandly
---
10 mins playtime at best
---
As someone that is going to buy Ghostface on release day like all the other killers I know what I'm getting into and I also don't care if he is bad(I really like everything about him even if he is bad) but if you are going to buy him on release PLEASE THINK OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACTIONS. Like please don't buy him just because he looks cool because I know for a fact you won't use him at all and he'll just sit there unplayed.
---
Laughs in bubba.
---
Samination is gonna have a field day making the Killers meeting in the next parody
---
Oh man can't wait to get a perk to use on a bottom tier Killer for the entirety of 3 months! :D
---
No it wont be unless it's changed. 
---
The bug right now is that any time spent in the survivors camera pulls him out of his stealth.
---
If that's fixed they'll need to look at him for one second to cancel it.
---
One. Second.
---
Survivors have a 180 degree field of view and motion. Survivors also spend 90% of the game at a gen freely looking around. Yeah they'll no longer be able to just instant tag GF and stop his power but it's still way too quick considering they just have to look in his general direction for a second.
---
Well I’m not saying that you shouldn’t provide feedback, this community just does it in a less than constructive manner.
---
he cant stalk because they looked at him for .000000001 secs and wiped his power...prob didnt even know they looked at him either..just was moving their camera around casually.
---
If you actually had to face Ghost face and "LOOK" at him...then he might be decent.
---
go to the community page, settings community flair (for mobile) on pc, go to community, community settings (on the right) change user flair.
---
It is better than what it currently is, but I don't think Ghostface's balance should be exclusively determined by counting on survivors bringing the same item (&amp; not sucking with it.) Though he wouldn't be the first to be vulnerable, he would be the first where that was the only counter -- even Hag let's you crouch walk over traps.
---
Supposedly, it's hard to design a hoodie like that because in the game head and torso are separate
---
**\*Autistic Screeching about how water is not wet and how you big stupid\***
---
Or they just shoot them.
---
So I get the MoM nerfs but what is up with the Enduring BUFFS?
---
Enduring is already a meta perk in combination with spirit fury, who thought it needs buffs? It doesn't work against DS anymore but seeing as how DS has become such a rare occurence it doesn't matter.
---
Just asking as a killer main for gods sake.
---
i don't play league. and it is best out of 3.
---
I feel like even though this is a public beta it still shouldn't be acceptable. This shows that they do NO in house testing before opening up to the public. If they played a single game in house they would see this issue immediately.
---
Circular argument
---
I think you meant"Hex: The Killer is Blind"
---
I wish I wasn't right
---
It’s the complete opposite man.
---
That is amazing. And I think you made the right choice. Samination's characterization of the Trapper is too precious IMO. The bitchy effeminate "ding ding diiing" Wraith is a close second. 
---
The tattoo really looks great. I can't wait til the animator himself sees this and responds. Please come back and share his reaction!
---
One stack
---
I use bbq for points not the aura reading personally
---
I can vault pallets 
---
Excuse me, wHatS a PaLLeT?;
---
Shoulda got the piano from Amazon prime too :)
---
So, little nea?
---
He already retweeted on Twitter and said it was awesome. My little girl LOVES it, she keeps showing my wife and singing the jingle/theme.
---
Im a betting man. Whenever I feel lucky I slap on those hemorrhage addons and try to get as many hemophiliacs on the survivor side as possible. 
---
I like to believe that all the DCs are because of people who can't stand all the blood...
---
"I survivor now...I quit the hookers"
---
One from protection, one from a safe un/hook.
---
What rank are you? Between 20 and 15 I'd guess.
---
And the bangs on her ponytail
---
Now it has hair physics
---
Same. I actually play killers that I like for who they are, like Myers or Legion, not for whether they’re buffed or not. It’s all about having fun, and I surely will have more fun maining one of my favorite Slasher killers than playing op killers I don’t really like/care about!
---
Monto had the same idea in his ghostface vid
---
Still no change for sloppy butcher applying the healing speed debuff indefinitely until healed? Several killers have addons that does the same effect for 30s up to 2mn, and requires a hit with on their power attack, not basic M1.
---
Its clearly a meta perk and it cant even be mitigated with vigil.
---
Any opinion on this?
---
Rank one, and i get constant 4k's when i play doctor, if you know what your doing then he's nowhere near as hard ton play or weak as you like to make it seem.
---
Ghostface without Brenda Meeks is the real joke.
---
Losing does not matter when dealing with such filth
---
Had it before end game collapse was introduced.
---
You’d 4/5 gen a team and the last person would quite happily waste there entire day hiding if it means you lose a few points on a “game”.
---
Dude he's terrible. I played against him as survivor and trust me he's wayyyy too punished for trying to use his power. Hopefully they'll revert some of it and make some serious changes, but it's definitely early enough to tell he's not very good.
---
garbage has to be taken out
---
It’s ok, you’ll be fine
---
Yeah I getcha, I was just trying really hard to make that ception joke
---
I kinda like the camera more; I think it fits his character and his lore better. That being said I do wish there was an option for a skin or something to get the flip phone back.
---
 #StopLegionAbuse
---
As I said in one of my salty post, at this point I spect that they will fix it but he will still be a B tier with shit perks.
---
The first scene where Ghostface does his trivia murder game.
---
I like the look of the camera and I feel like it makes more sense
---
:(
---
Billy takes a lot of skill to play against skilled survivors, against inexperienced survivors he’s very easy to use.  He has a high skill ceiling but gives a lot of power for free to baby Billy’s or just bad ones.
---
Is this your first time on this sub? Lol
---
Imagine him getting stronger when survivors face him directly while stalking.
---
How about he doesn’t have his base power nullified by survivors, and instead he’s brought on equal footing to Myers where you hide behind something then stealth away or run?
---
There could be other methods of countering his power, flashlights were just what came to mind. Stuns could work too, any action that stuns him could remove his power (I’m not 100% if it doesn’t already), so things like pallet drops, Head On, etc. 
---
I’ve also seen people suggest that survivors use the pointing emote while facing Ghostface to cancel his power. While I personally don’t think it’s perfect, it’s much better than what we have now, and unlike flashlights, everyone can point.
---
Got blinded by a winter cracker last game but it didn't stop Bubba's chainsaw from'a swingin'
---
They could make all his perks great/good with some simple changes:
---
IAE: show it inside the radius and reduce cooldown.
---
TT: Gens will start regressing when blocked
---
FC: at 4 tokens remove the red stain in a chase as well.
---
Was wanted. Not anymore though because he is bad
---
It'll be bad, but remember, he's otherwise a standard Killer.
---
Spirit moves at 4.4 m/s and Scratched Mirror Myers moves at 4.2 m/s with a reduced lunge.
---
Legion "main" here: surprisingly a lot of people. On average I get at least one DC per match, usually from some big brain cucklord running a no-skill second-chance bullshit build like Mettle + Adren + Dead Hard + Self Care.
---
I ran a test the other day where I equipped an Ivory mori instead of an Ebony to see how people would react. I didn't even play that scummy and didn't camp or tunnel or anything of the sort; had some low tier addons too. Sure enough I had one person who suicided on the hook and one person who DCed on first down after I Moried the first person I downed twice.
---
That's Legion's true power: saving you 2000 Bloodpoints, since an Ivory Mori is as effective as an Ebony on this Killer. :)
---
But seriously how trash do you have to be to DC against essentially worse Doctor.
---
Ghost Face is wanted by the community, THIS GF is not wanted but the character is.
---
Objectively speaking "Default Killer with an instadown and fast pallet break" is better than "Default Killer whos power is to give the Survivors free Boldness points."
---
DS is like that handgun you buy and keep in your house for when stuff get dangerous in your house.
---
r/birdsarentreal
---
I imagine BHVR copied the code from Small Game.
---
That said, most won't do that and I think you'll be able to get the occasional mark.
---
The character  was the mask basically as all the killers died that wore it. (I still like  the ghostface we got just not his ability)
---
Tea!!!! I’m so excited for these changes
---
r/moontruthers
---
Except one is a human. Rin and Spirit are ghosts. There's nothing in common with this picture of Xxxtentacion and Ghostface..
---
This would be hell in a chase. You'd have to regularly turn around, point and run away again
---
You better watch out for his traps
---
It can always change. Like Freddy is getting a rework maybe they'll rework him before he goes fully live.
---
I’ve used new DS more than old DS tbh. It punishes tunneling, so if you get tunneled a lot I guess it would be worth it?
---
I dont know about G tier. At least mew can hit people without waiting 7 seconds, even if it is only a basic attack
---
Neither Plague or Hag is "up there", especially not at rank 4 to 6.
---
Peanits talked about a viewing angle, similar to Small Game. So you won't be taken out of stealth just for being on the edge of a Survivor's screen.
---
Remember, GF can mark in just a couple of seconds when leaning. He can't be too hard to counter, or we'll end up in another Legion situation.
---
Mh I mean I think it’s most important they just push him up to something like B tier, but at the end of the day at least he’ll still be playable. And Idk again the same applies I think a couple small fixes to them but the perks aren’t the worst, I mean they’re not on a killer level of pharmacy.
---
This is how the devs show their support during pride
---
Anywhere else would be a crime
---
How does it work? Does every survivor on the map hear the notification, or only those close to Ghostface? If it's the latter, that's really silly.
---
Dude since when do people follow the esrb ratings, my brother and cousin both play and their 12/13 and it's not hurting them any, I could see if it had sexual content but senseless violence is senseless violence, if the smash characters died bloody deaths and screamed their esrb rating would probably go up and if killers had sqeaky toys and lifted survs up into hammocks the esrb would probably go down
---
Imo its a flawed system
---
Nice
---
Are people surprised? I was saying this over a week ago based off the leaked videos and got flamed. It was very obvious he was going to be shit.
---
You're never going to see people play Ghostface seriously after the first week in his current form. He's not free, so people will have to pay for a shitty Killer.
---
Why is deathgarden so hyped now? Didnt really play it since it came out
---
Both survivor and ghostface should shout "wazzup" when hes detected!
---
I think new DS is amazing if you play solo, it stops you getting tunnelled off hook.
---
I'd recommend putting bloodpoints into Laurie. 
---
For one thing, getting more bloodpoints is easier than getting more shards and for another (unless he gets a major buff) GF is going to be weak to Object of Obsession; so if you unlock it on Laurie with DS you'll be a bit more prepared to hard counter his stealth ability.
---
What's wrong with making a special animation when they're looking backwards? Oh, yeah, devs are too lazy, sorry.
---
yep. it just helps you to get to Max. points faster
---
No its because they only have the license for the mask, not the phone.
---
Also would promote hook saves in that 16 sec block...they dont know how to be creative...dev team is questionable.
---

---
I made no mention of christianity.
---
Well now somebody has to draw it
---
Yeah, I like that idea with the pointing.
---
I've also heard people suggest that Ghostface by default is granted an obsession, and that only the obsession can cancel his power, which is great until you realize that's basically encouraging tunneling the obsession to death from the jump as a basic part of killer power.. unless the obsession changes on every death, and then you might as well just have 4 people that can do it.
---
So it's literally irelevant to the OPs post, lol
---
15%*
---
Legion was weak, they were just also extremely unfun to play against.
---
Spirit had major issues in the PTB, they took the issues raised, made some changes, and now she's great
---
lol no
---
So weak his counters don’t even have to be explained
---
No but you think you'd have a basic understanding of the game you created. Unless they are completely clueless as to what a real match of their game looks like, they should have known that they absolutely missed the mark with Ghostface. I'm sure at least someone working on this isn't half bad. I just see how this happened unless something is actually bugged with him atm
---
I like the idea, but in this case I’d make the recharge time for his power much longer (at least a minute, less with add ons), otherwise Ghostface can just use his power every few seconds to get a free exposed effect.
---
Carlsade rise up
---
Sometimes the tunneling hag is just a not a very experienced player trying to get kills in the game... I don’t think  every tunnel / camper in the game is behind the screen evilly laugh at the survivors.. the matchmaking in this game is already broken and I bet how many new people just stay away from playing killer if not the game at all.  When you have survivors DCing so much that their rank is high enough just to play against less experience killer.  And sometimes is the other way around. I feel bad when the matchmaking is so shit that is get newbie survivors matched with one red rank and still becomes a bloodbath or I get matched with survivors way out of my league and after they defeat me they also have to bully and also wait to the very last second to leave the game...  all we can do is try not to be cunts to each other.  I play on PS4 and I’ve been happier since I got all communication blocked... 
---
League of legends : I got the most toxic community 
---
Dead by daylight : Hold my beer
---
That's smart, sounds fair, maybe only add that recharge timer to discovery stalks and not successful stalks?
---
And they said that they’d adjust the angle and distance based on feedback in the ptb, they know of the bug and the criticism of that one specific part of his power so he most likely will release in a better state.
---
Original screenshots from [Dead By Daylight Animated Parody 5](https://youtu.be/Vd_3JmDoKNc), made by Samination if that wasn't obvious.
---
Just find it a little ironic that the guy who came in dressed as Ghostface was marked as the worst Killer. Little did we know that the real worst Killer would be the one to keep the mask...
---
But his sweater has a fucking skull in it
---
No he's right, she went WAH just before she slashed me with a Kitana blade I just have laying around my house. Just yesterday she placed bear traps all over the house and yard. My poor wife stepped in one, my toddler picked her up, but gave my wife the hatch. 
---
Anyway, let him/her be a backseat parent. My wife and I have raised a sweet and loving girl who isn't affected by a hilarious, kid friendly parody of a violent video game I don't play around her or let her watch.
---
People have said this elsewhere but I'll say it here; Hillbilly wouldn't have the power we know and love if he were released today. It'd either apply Deep Wounds, or have a recharge bar, or it'd only let him sprint a limited distance.
---
Thankfully however, he was released during a time where being able to quickly sprint across the map and instantly down people was largely considered to be the weakest Killer power.
---
Dwight please stop eating your tie
---
I don’t understand the point of it. What good does seeing other survivors/missed skill checks/rushed actions do for me? Why wouldn’t I just run bond and not have to be near the killer for it to work?
---
Think about this. Youre a tier 1 myers, stalking someone, they don't notice you for a bit because you don't have a terror radius. They notice and start running and fast vault a window, now you have sight of them so you can get easier stalk maybe even mindgame them for a hit. That's all it's worth. Ghostface can use it the same
---
Hm... the obsession idea isn’t bad. Even if it jumps from one survivor to the next upon death, that’s still three less survivors that can yank your power away from you at the start. The only problem I can think of is how that would affect certain perks.
---
I. Eat. Your. Pallets. I EAT 'EM UP.
---
Ah sorry, I have misread your comment like the original killer in scream was a girl. My bad
---
&gt;Why do the devs have this mentality of “release it now, fix it... eventually”?
---
It might have to do with their obligation to release a killer every 3 months regardless of the state of previous killers. A lot of people are aware of how they're pursuing more content over pefecting gameplay fixes. The other killers had decent releases despite their need for post-release tweaks, but I'm worried they're biting off more than they can chew and are going to be spending much more time with post-release fixes vs pre-release fine tuning.
---
Jazz Hands!
---
How do you think BHVR will react this time to the major backlash?
---
Do you think they will do a opposite Freddy where they buff him significantly as a knee jerk reaction or do you think they will apply some minor band-aid fixes and leave him as a poor killer?
---
We probably won't notice the change much
---
How dare you spell it "Kitana"? Don't you know that's a character from Mortal Kombat? An ultra-bloody violent game that shouldn't even be known by the parents of toddlers in case babies are attuned to our brainwaves! &gt;:V  
---
I like to walk on top of cats.
---
The ranking in this game wasn't actually bad, (2 green ranks and 3 yellows) and I generally try not to bully or even stomp baby killers, but the way she would spawn from a trap, walk around me standing very purposefully in front of her, and go for the survivor I unhooked instead doesn't lend credibility to it just being inexperience. 
---
:( she deserved the kill but that doesnt mean I have to be happy she got it lol
---
Carl = Upvote

I mean doughnuts are still definitely a think in Manchester UK, but that as big of a thing as they are in Canada/USA... so... Gregg’s Steak Bake probably!

---
It really does seem like we got the Scary Movie version of Ghostface
---
Good on you for limiting what media your child does see, but there's also the fact that there's no definitive studies directly linking violent video games to violence in children. So even if your daughter was watching, people have no right to try and backseat parent when they have no idea what they're talking about.
---
I went to make the same comment but deleted it for being a bummer, but hey, gopd for OP.
---
Rusahed actions are any actions that require a survivor to use spacebar + holding shift.
---
This includes;
---
- Fast Vaulting
---
- Medium vaulting
---
- Fast Vaulting a Pallet
---
- Fast Entering a Locker - Useless as aura reading disabled inside the locker
---
- Fast Exiting a Locker 
---
That's all rushed actions in the game. Perk is still pointless as the noise notification already tells you where a survivor is.
---
And imagine getting thrown to corn fields. So. Much. Corn. Vision.
---
it works with slug builds, pick a survivor up then drop them.
---
This is what I came to say &lt;3
---
Love Spirit, but damn girl keep it down will ya!
---
Judging by the state Legion was released in probably the latter, but I think especially for a liscensed character they'll listen to feedback and release a strong character that'll fuck up the meta as opposed to a weak character that'll have no impact on the meta.
---
Honestly I'd be okay with Ghostface being overpowered because I'd much rather face against "Amanda Myers" then Billy or Nurse. I still stand by my opinion that a Stalking Killer has inherent counterplay built into their kit by running away when you see them stalking you. He doesn't need the reveal mechanic as well since you can just use common sense to react to him once you see him, though I do like the concept people have suggested of requiring a Survivor to point at him to reveal him.
---
This so much! The PTB is for testing, but they seem so afraid to use it to test what the community asks for.
---
Legion's problems could have been isolated and fixed a lot more quickly if the devs had let the community test 115% ms on them during the PTB. Instead they buffed Frank's Mixtape in the *next* PTB and then spent several months trying to figure out the issues people were having with them.
---
Spirit wasn't tested that long ago, but she was turned from a trash Killer into one of the top 3 Killers because the devs listened to PTB feedback and responded accordingly.
---
Just don't buy it, let's vote with our wallets, there is nothing better to make a company get their shit together.
---
OP against all survivors is more accurate.  Lining up to use point and the effective slow of using that point command would fuck you up bad.  Free hits for days.
---
Why didnt we get a grocery store map and him as a survivor....geez...DBD needs new devs and ppl who actually know how to make creative decisions and not shit F tier killers 24/7
---
I might have a minority opinion but i don't think survivors should have ANY aura reading capabilities when it comes to killers.
---
17th my dude
---
What does PTB mean?
---
I agree, thats 200-500 ON TOP OF the 200 or so for the tattoo, all to end up with an arm lol.
---
We are not talking about Freddy hes getting reworked...
---
You mean like moonwalking? That'd look damn stupid.
---
But if that was the requirement for F tier previously, and ghostface at least isnt that bad. He cant be lower than f tier
---
It is a good perk. I'd recommend it.
---
so, choose ghostface while looking for a lobby and then change killer... perfection
---
Don't talk too soon
---
You should fear all killers not be able to fully them
---
But see, there's this thing called internal testing, which they could and should have done before the public testing to quickly catch onto obvious faults like the fact that the killer isn't even able to use his power.
---
Thank you!
---
Someone who can do some research.
---
 Wrong, his purpose is to tebag survivors
---
Give us his original classic outfit from the movie and I'll be looking fashionably cool as heck.
---
And probably going to do Scary movie references.
---
Especially TT. Something I realized is that ghostface (or any killer for that matter) cannot kick a blocked gen.
---
The Download isnt working please fix i need that :o
---
Public Test Build. It is basically a beta for the next patch. After the whole Freddy thing the Devs decided to let the players test it to check it was balanced. Then after the ptb the Devs take players feedback and tweak the killer a little to fit what the community are saying about the patch. For example in last PTB the Devs tested a large buff to Thanatophobia which never made it to actual build although a nerf (not really but it was to stop hook farming) for WGLF so it only applies on safe hooks. All the emblems were tweaked slightly after the PTB too. If you go on the forums it explains how to download it but nothing is saved in the ptb so you lose all progress you made while playing in the ptb.
---
Any M1 killer is a jester ready to entertain. I'm supposed to get spooked or at least feel some form of unease. Instead, we get a comedy show. Getting emblem points for hitting killers with pallets is hilarious (on PTB).
---
Idk what youre saying did you forget ghostface can... #t-bag????#
---
 That's awesome.
---
The thing is ,in my opinion,all he needs are minor adjusments. Things to not make his ability so counterable and he can be mid-tier
---
This TBH. Spirit doesn’t need to eat pallets like most killers since she can just mindgame them or whose over to the other side rapidly.
---
He has all the tools to be a great killer, so.  Mobility to reach the most important objectives a killer has, Gens?     Check.
---
   Chasing/anti-Looping power with Dream Snares/Dream Pallets?  Check.
---
Time wasting components on his power that make survivors have to do something other than gens after they get out of a chase?  Check.
---
A degree of stealth making him harder to see in the distance?  Check.
---
Unrealistic, NEXT
---
Now I want Cindy in the game fully voiced by Anna Faris  and she just says stupid shit all match.
---
Definitely, especially if you play solo
---
But you still made a claim, claim something without proper evidence when someone has a valid counterclaim and you look foolish especially when you say something along the lines of "well I didn't expect to actually have to prove myself so I guess I'm done here"
---
I... I wish we had curtains in DbD. Heck I wish we had a mansion with two or three floors map.
---
And you can only dream Ghostface looking good.
---
Ok thanks for the answer, but i assume its for pc only and i'm sadly a console player.
---
True, which is probably a big part of why he's here.
---
This is broken, doesn't show where 90% of the time.
---
We need Brenda Meeks and her “that is some scurry shit!” line
---
You might want to add Rancor to the mori section

That came off wrong. I too was questioning bhvr's decision and not your statement.

What exactly was wrong with mettle of man that they needed to Nerf it?

Man that spiderman cartoon is old.
---
"Only us survivors getting nerfs"
---
The Legion would like to have a word with you 👀
---
It just had a free weekend on Steam and a bunch of streamers were contracted out to play it and give away free games.
---
"Welcome to the club..bitch"
---
"Play testing" it's fairly obvious nobody at BHVR has ever played a single game of Dead by Daylight, or watched streamers.
---
They go by loose descriptions.
---
Oh no
---
Waiting 3 minutes is holding the game hostage
---
Please don't be an afk killer...
---
How is he worse than Freddy. Freddy litterally cant do anything until he follows a survivor around for 7 seconds. They just miss a skill check or find another survivor and mew have to do it all over again. Yes ghostfaces power is absolutely horrid right now, but at least mew can still attack survivors whenever mew want
---
You booofed a generator? THAT'S A GAZONKO!!!..
---
Please no mister clown, no more punch and judy.
---
"You're behind the pallet I can see your feet" *Ghostface prower deactivated*
---
#GREY SUIT IS WACK
---
I think you missed the point of the post
---
Don't bother arguing on this sub. It's heavily survivor sided and will downvote people asking for buffs for weak killers but immediately cry for nerfs on an older killer that has been fine for years.   
---
Yeah, see, I can make completely unfounded statements too. I'm not gonna say this reddit is either sided, and I'm not gonna say there aren't killers that need nerfs(looking at you Nurse), but I can say I've been browsing this reddit for 2 and a half years, and one of the most common constants is that "survivor-esque" redditors tend to say a killer is fine or "needs more time for people to learn how to use them" when a character is clearly, and blatantly weak. But I guess it doesn't impact survivors huh? Who cares, as long as it doesn't affect your easy wins.
---
When is the Fking game pass gonna happen
---
Ghostface is a high risk high reward killer.  You actually need to plan ahead and if you do it right you get rewarded with an almost certain insta down. The concept is actually fairly decent, you can't just get into a game, hold a button and boom free insta down. You actually need to work for it.
---
While I agree that he needs some buffs as his power can be stopped way too easily, he shouldn't turn into a no risk high reward killer.
---
We'll see how he turns out after the bugs have been fixed.
---
It'll be interesting to see if many people run DS after it being on the shrine. I used to rarely get through a game without someone DSing me as killer, but I've had it done maybe twice since the nerf
---
No i didnt
---
You complaining that the killer slugged everyone and waited doe them to die
---
There is nothing wrong with this
---
Where do you get the keys? Just watching streamers? Or is it too late now?
---
So his new perk counters q&amp;q?
---
Not even. They were just there and now I have two free keys
---
I like your ideas and someone else mentioned it if someone is chasing ghost face around trying to loop him and ruin his power, the next time he “spots” ghost face I think should hit him with exposed. So it’s high risk high reward. Your buddies on a genie? Good I’ll risk getting hooked so you guys can continue
---
Her perk only works for a while at the begining of the match. Wouldn't "Pop goes the weasel" be better?
---
No. Survivors don’t deserve a free unhook. Be careful how you play, and do gens if the killer is camping. Survivors already have the means to punish camping killers. Being able to just walk up and take a friend off the hook would just be crap.
---
Yeah remove that trash ass map I hate it. That and the CORRRRRRRN
---
What do you mean abuse potential. If he slugs everyone he can let them bleed out, with or without egc.
---
Being toxic is essentially just doing whatever you can to piss off the killer or survivors, depending on which role you play. 
---
As a survivor you can for example piss off killers by making them chase you then just pallet loop them and 360 them, flashlight them and stun them constantly just being a dick. It's quite fun to be toxic at times but you aren't exactly contributing to the game other than keeping the killer focused on you. There are many survivors who piss off the killer so much he/she stops chasing you all together and you start chasing them to piss them off even more.
---
Check out Noob3 on Youtube, he has a great toxic series where he plays as a specific killer/survivor each video and goea as toxic as possible.
---
I don't have it but I heard its in the shrine. Its why Im asking
---
Can you imagine yourself running and looking back? Same here
---
*Step 4 survivors DC
---
You want them? I would like to try the game out to see all the new stuff  but I understand if no.
---
They will.........I hope
---
Pill bottle freddy is like a better legion. ^still ^bad ^though
---
Ruin, Pop, Intervention, then Thanat because people don’t wanna heal against you! Plague matches make that perk a lot more consistent
---
dude samination is awesome
---
Actually no, she did slug them, but then initiated endgame and pulled the survivors away from the only open door to still get the three sacrifices and doing away with the punishment for bleed outs. Which is where the abuse potential comes from, because the devs have tried to reduce the full team slugging with the loss of the bp for bleedouts
---
You should add "shack" to the list. When I was new, I never knew what that meant.
---
...Is that Ben 10?
---
I found thanatophobia at higher ranks works wonders since they don't want to cleanse and stay injured.
---
Yes, yes it is
---
Did they actually go through with this change? If so RIP
---
Let killers have some fun
---
Fair enough.
---
Spirit was released on live with adjustments from PTB. 
---
I’m 99% certain Ghostface will receive a few adjustments prior to official release.
---
#IT'S BEEN TOO LONG SO BRING IT RIGHT BACK
---
Well yes it’s on the PTB. You still need 3 stacks but now they have to be safe hook rescues or protection hits. It also now stops you going into the dying state if you’re full health so it counters Devour, Noed, Chainsaws etc...
---
Once a survivor is found, our main defence is looping. 
---
For M1 killers, loops need to be mind gamed &amp; survivors forced to drop them as soon as possible, also knowing safe &amp; unsafe loops will help a killer, a good survivor on a extremely safe loop and running it flawlessly? It may be best to drop chase, the loop unsafe? Mindgame them in it.
---
Stan Twitter has leaked into the sub sksksk
---
No, not camp and tunnel, lurk and pounce. Rather than search and destroy, you search and destroy once you've been seen but even then you don't need to search you get a directional ping so all you gotta do is destroy.
---
Oh, you remember my post 😂.
---
I never said that I was unhappy with the changes, I think MoM is more fair. Probably it will be stronger at times, because now MoM can ignore instant downs, but it will be more situational, especially for solo survivors. You will literally need to combine it with Borrowed Time and fight with other survivors for your stacks. 
---
But some people seems to think that MoM is stronger than the current version, because now it can counter NOED, so I give them a counter play to this perk : slugging Nurse completely counters now MoM for all who don't know 😄.
---
As of this post, I've decided that Ben 10 is an excellent show that I never gave enough credot for reasons.
---
&gt;false sense of oppression

Here we go.. biased killers vs biased survivors: round 1 million

The fact that a spotting mechanic is available for the people with THIRD PERSON CAMERAS is mind boggling.
---
If you can jugle survivors with it its decent.
---
I personally hate this, just do your job and kill me already. Don't feed the pity, lol. I mean your never going to see me feel bad for the killer and just go out in the open to let him filet me. Finish it already!
---
Lucky, the devs are reworking the maps so that there are more mindgamable/unsafe loops and less safe loops.

---
Also go ahead and - me bcs i said something that you dont like.
---
The game is too fast paced for trap killers, they waste too much time setting up while survivors are free to gen rush.  Shes just a shitty version of nurse
---
Unlucky chief, but the new mettle of man is way better than the old
---
To be fair at least with bleeding out the killer loses a lot of points for it. The end game they really do not lose anything cause it counts as a normal sacrifice hook
---
Interesting I didn’t know this!
---
What’s your favourite template you’ve made?
---
Bot gonna lie, they had us in the first half
---
Usually when a killer is released and people say it's bad, I think... well, there's some depth to the character and how to play them that we haven't entirely learned.
---
Ghostface doesn't seem to have that depth at all.  This is just bad.
---
The only counter would be to “Avoid them” which usually works up until she cycles back (from camping) which usually has you retreat out only to step on one, Or Someone else tries to help but activates one. If you read it Destroying a totem would remove up to three of her most recent ones and displace her, There aren’t too many totems on the map so they would have to be used effectively and if this is over used, The last totem that is destroyed will bring her to that player. This easily creates an opening in her routine to allow players to grab their friend/random and make a break for it. Additionally it only Destroys her 3 recent traps so it doesn’t totally counter her (which would be stupid) But may place her far enough to deactivate her ability to teleport onto her clones
---
Honestly I think to prevent this they should just make it count as a bleed out if a survivor is crawling when the in game collapse ends so it won’t count as a full sacrifice just like if the killer lets a survivor bleed out. Would it stop it completely no but at least they sorta get punished by it
---
Very true, good survivors will still be able to do serious work with more unsafe pallets though, mind gaming will be something to master for both sides.
---
Honestly new maps and new killers is enough to keep me interested
---
I really hope they have it save a screenshot every time you mori someone with ghost face.
---
Sadly, ghodtie, like plague, is always going to be mediocre.  Survivors control the true pace of the match, giving them control over the killer's power as well is just a disaster.
---
I think it will be fine without gamemodes but it would be cool
---
Survivors keep forgetting they're not supposed to win every time, same goes for Killers feeling entitled to a 4K because they did good. I'm getting really tired of this sub full of tears every time the devs do something for one side.
---
IKR it's supposed to be blood?
---
&gt; Like a zombie mode 
---
This just isn't dead by daylight, Dead by daylight is not a zombie game, it's not a hoard mode always knowing survivors locations and 'moving slow' is really unfun in every single way.
---
The game is not in dire need of a new game mode, i have been playing since Beta and new maps, survivors, killers are more than enough to keep the game fresh, plus all the extra content coming in year 3 is far more than enough.
---
Freddy gives him the F so now he is reddy, reddy for a change.
---
On xbox I see looking for groups that say ages 0-9. Pretty good job so far.
---
ZA WARUDO!!! Toki wo tomare
---
You know me so well.
---
This is a killer problem in general for why loops work so well.
---
Killers need a separate collision box for geometry all the time or only during chases.
---
I didn't know Rev. Chris played dead by daylight
---
“I think we did a pretty good job so far.”
---
I hate those other, less attractive, people who don't recognize their own bias. Why can't they be enlightened like me?
---
You can play other games...
---
Adding more gamemodes will split the playerbase and increase waiting times.
---
truth

Hopefully the skybox returns
---
BBQ + triple hex is my go to and i’ve only ever lost 1 game with it.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/59249/bans-for-the-double-killer-glitch-are-happening-now
---
There should be a new game mode where the survivors hunt down and beat up the killer.
---
Nah, I just didn’t notice the year on my first read.
---
Except Plague isn't even remotely decent as a killer.
---
Regular hits no longer proc the perk. You need to take protection hits, or get safe unhooks to get your three stacks. I believe the healing bit where your aura is revealed is gone, but I could be wrong about that.
---
The perk can also help you take an extra hit when you're healthy too, so it now protects against Myers Tier 3, NOED, other one shot downs.
---
Ghostface owns a mall?
---
Imagine your Grandpa has a video game character tatoo...
---
Honestly, people just aren't playing him correctly. They're going into stalk and running toward every player they see. He's a camping killer, and at a distance, on top of that. If you take your time, stay low, and then peek around objects, you can excel. You can't be spotted if you're peeking around objects, as far as I can tell.
---
I’m fine with how he is now. There’s no need to slow down his base movement speed
---
catching sight of him should just pause the person who caught sights timer instead of completely vanquishing his power.
---
Yea, you're right. Let me get it removed right away. I mean, it's not like it has a special meaning to me or anything. Wait it does.
---
Putting an RBT on a survivor gives you 500 points on all platforms. Maybe you have Distressing in your PS4 build?
---
I know legion gets a lot of hate, but I love how all 4 of them have their own unique idle animations.
---
Honestly, I think it'd be more balanced if they just had to point their bodies in his direction. That way, he could still sneak up on generators, and it'd work on people who are running away, plus unhooking survs.
---
Downvote for the term "guppie guard" what kind of cringe ass term is that, dont speak like a toddler
---
All hail the great Silly Hat Vendor
---
Agreed! Each killer has their own unique play style and requires different tactics to go against. That’s what I love about the game is that it’s not repetitive with its colorful choice of who I want to murder you with.
---
Yeah, but funny emote. Maybe they would have to either point their body at him for a few seconds or they could point and it would have a bonus effect for pointing at him, like maybe a notification to the other survivors, extra blood points, stunning ghost face, etc.
---
SAY IT AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK!
---
Yeah but everyone said that legion was really weak and disappointing at first. Billy and nurse were always strong.
---
Is this patch already out for consoles?
---
Now that I'd still like to see changed
---
Billy and Huntress are both really fun to play against killers &amp; are both high tier killers.
---
Youre actually right! They should make it so that ghostface just cant stalk the person who looked at him with their character! For like 7 seconds or so he wouldnt be able to stalk that one person.
---
They need to add a yuge speed boost to Ghostface if he gets spotted by a survivor while in stealth.
---
Near guarantees a hit. But hey, better than an instadown right? And he can actually have a power.
---
They are annoying to play against. I don't blame them.
---
absolutly macfucking agreed
---
“Morrons”

No, next weekend.

But thrillijg tremors.is garbage...
---
honestly the only problem is that hooked survivors and downed ones can deactivate it
---
Tbh he still kinda is a Myers rehash

~~F Tier - Freddy~~
---
G Tier - Ghostface
---
It's just so fitting.
---
Bugs can appear out of no where even if thru fixes it. We also have no idea if they will fix it before the ptb ends or keep it up longer
---
Freddy came out and was average, survivors complained and within the week they were nerfing him.
---
Good one...?
---
God yes it helps with tunnelling even if you still get chased after atleast you stunned the fucker
---
So can Pig, another better killer
---
I have the same question
---
No. He's bad because he's bugged and not even working as he's supposed to
---
Feel like this picture needs more motion blurr.
---
You're a moron or a troll or a moronic Troll.
---
Doctor is the king of Tracking, a good doctor will always know where the survivors are on the map regardless of their madness level.
---
OVercharge, Unnerving presence, BBQ and NOED, High stimulus electrode and the Addon that makes illusionary doctors appear at lvl 2 (i think it's calm) Mean that you have map wide tracking. Overcharge and UP combined with said map tracking mean that as long as you make sure to defend 3 gens you will control how the others play.
---
Calling doctor a man with a stick shows how little you know about the nuances of the game.
---
OP talked trash on his For Honor post, ‘s bout it
---
I feel that. Yesterday I play a game where I didnt get hit once, all gens were done with little problems and exit gate was opened. Killer had NOED and I didnt notice the exposed status. So I ran towards the exit gate with the killer standing next to it and was utterly surprised when I sad downed with one hit.
---
But... Faster
---
The amount of killers crying about not being able to get a 4K every game is unbelievable, it’s shocking how the killers are the ones with the victim complex
---
Oh Shit
---
I'm curious how she actually pulled this off. If you have a survivor crawling for the exit, pick them up and move them away, then drop them, their wiggle bar would be close to full (if they were wiggling). Then they would start crawling back to the exit and you'd have to pick them up and move them again, and they'd likely still have a decent amount of wiggle progress, even with the decay. I can't say for sure exactly how it would go, but i feel like you'd be able to wiggle or crawl out before your 5 minute bleedout or the 4 minute end game occurs. Now throw in the fact that she has to juggle 3 people like this, I feel like there's no way she could do it without someone getting out.
---
Honestly if you play both survivor and killer, you will quickly get a feel for what type of play is enjoyable for both sides. 
---
It’s also really good at improving your play on the opposite side as you know what they are thinking, what they might think you’re doing, and it can lead to some cool mindgames on both sides.
---
Doc and LF are both worse than Legion.
---
He's pretty decent after the change.
---
He’d be ass if they did that. He’s only good because both his map pressure and that he can end loops quicker because of the combo between 115% and chainsaw pressure. If he was 110%, he’d be worse at loop and it’d make very hard to use his chainsaw at all in them.
---
He's bugged so it will work much better when it's fixed. See the problem is, in order to make good killers they have to be stronger then nurse or Billy which would just make them op
---
Like you said though, player feedback is an important part of this so it's a good thing that ghostfaces weakness is being meme'd on because it helps present the communities feelings.
---
i wasnt saying it was fake im saying the photo is fake but all these idiots are fucking braindead
---
I regret that this took so long to make
---
Metal, Medal and Mettle - all three in just one tiny post. Congratulations!
---
I just woke up so im kinda brain dead lmao
---
Lore friendly but talks which breaks the rule of no one speaking in the realm
---
Mhm. He also said they can adjust the spotting range and timer to cancel itt. Personally I think immuty dection is better on the crouch
---
The New MOM is way better then before! Iv been running it with borrowed time and it’s worked out so well. I thought they were gonna destroy the perk but nope even better!
---
Amanda after I try flirting with her.
---
Fire is burnt?
---
What are you talking about? Hag’s power is amazing - you just need to learn to use it well. Don’t just trap gens, hooked survivors, and totems - trap windows and pallets and anywhere else there’s a good loop. You’ll be knocking everyone down in no time!
---
Also, although not the strongest killer by any means, I think playing as the Plague is so much fun. Her power is useful if you are able to use it correctly and with good add-ons (though good add-ons shouldn’t be a necessity to use a killer’s power).
---
He's like Michael, but way worse! :D
---
Nothing is more fun than just barely dodging a chainsaw.
---
Yea same, i thought it would have been reduced to a husk of its former glory but its even better.
---
Well, they said that stats will change
---
Unless they m1 only
---
Ducking just in time to dodge that long range hatchet is pretty great too.
---
Nothing special,he said ,, Laughable and cringy. Don't like it ,,  under a custom emblem in a game.
---
I mean sure can say that and idc i just wanted to point out that this is a bit childish.
---
Combat Straps addon?
---
Gotta be done
---
If you unhook someone take a hit and they get away it counts for 2 instead of 1
---
Imagine a horror movie but the survivor runs the killer around in a circle for about 20 minutes run time
---
Still faster, it only takes off like .1 of a second
---
Knockout freddy was pretty awful to go against, to be fair.
---
Therefore Wraith is Nurse tier because he can use his power all game 😎
---
You can spam it as fast as a survivor
---
She was the first.
---
They also said they can adjust the distance, the timing to break it which I'm sure they will. It's probably supposed to be like a second or two if not more.
---
But yes, we also don't know the full extent of his bugs. For all we know it's its supposed to be like 4 seconds
---
He needs Meyer's T1 stealth ability when stalking....at the very least.
---
haha not.
---
I think the formula is making killers with hard-ish to use rewarding powers,and making survivors to be able to counter those powers(billy's chainsaw,hatchets,plague's corrupt purge for example)
---
I don't care how bad a killee is, I'm still playing him.
---
also once you have been hit 3 times you are safe no matter what even if fully healed if the killer has NOED or is a one hit down
---
Didn't talk trash. Just said it was laughable and cringy.
---
Yeah, it'd be way too OP on basically any killer during a chase. The perk as it is now is going to really shine on Myers with dead rabbit and ghost face's terror radius reducing perk
---
They will have to stop working on a Gen to turn around
---
Oh you count your multiple DCs as winning?, nice. Keep defending those 3 gens. When survivors decide not to DC you will see what it's getting stomped.
---
Thats usually what the final girl does but atleast the killer gets some kills along the way
---
When his bugs get fixed he will be better
---
Ghostface: Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
---
The Entity: Pretty much yeah.
---
How do you excel with Trapper? Surely you can't place traps in every loopable area in the game, what do you do to win chases when you're being run in an area you don't have traps? Apply those practices to the other killers with the exception of the Huntress.
---
I really don't think they're that annoying now. Just stay in TR or mend, its not that hard.
---
And then there are people like me who want to keep 100% achievements, so we're forced to buy the new killer, since one achievement is always linked to the killer's power
---
My friend, who can 4K with every killer at every rank easily
---
getting pretty sick of reddits initial reactions. they said legion was bad then he bacame a tunneling monster.
---
The new DS introduced the ability for the obsession to change midmatch, which is further expanded upon by furtive chase. There's still only ever one obsession at a time- it just switches around due to Furtive chase. If anything the two synergize well.
---
No lol. This was in response the a meme that said Behavior is too afraid to make menacing Killers cause Survivors have a false sense of oppression.
---
&gt; Wait the min the one on the left can't be right!!!
---
Of course not, he's on the left not the right.
---
My little ones favorite holiday is Halloween. She's addicted to Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline right now. Also loves Alice In Wonderland
---
Except not nearly as effective as either even with the bugs fixed lol
---
Shouldn’t there be redness from trauma to the dermis lol
---
Did they already release the feedback survey? Or is this just a random poll?
---
And David makes more sense as the Rhino
---
I mean, DS changes the obsession now, and it has for a while, so if this works with the journal then furtive chase should work too. I've never tested the journal and ds though, so idk
---
5% pleasure, 10% pain
---
Where are you seeing these ''killers crying about not being able to get a 4K every game''? Please point me in the general direction
---
I’m sorry.
---
Trust me, provided the map isn't bad, if you're good enough you can 4K with any killer at any rank
---
Why are you wrong?
---
When I play trapper, I guess I just get lucky or face potatoes. Important to note, my trapper is only a lvl 7, so I have no add ons or anything other than trapper perks for him.
---
I start off putting traps at the infinites or the killer shack. I might chase/whack a survivor or 2 on the way there. After that, I’ll start patrolling the gens and putting traps at various locations such as pallets and/or windows. Usually when I get into a chase with a survivor, I’ll just heard them over the area of the trap and they eventually run into it. If they know the trap is there, then they will usually just try to out run me which fails 90% of the time.
---
Ash: am I a joke to you
---
Oof, looks like regret
---
&gt;You dial one of the survivors and they have to answer a horror trivia question (do a skill check). If they mess up it exposes them for a few seconds.
---
I like this, there was some fan-created content that had the horror trivia idea. The same content also included giving one of the survivors a temporary terror radius (in keeping with the way the suspicion regarding the killer's identity kept switching in the films) and honestly this sounds like a great idea. Imagine one of your friends just suddenly going 'DUN DUN DUN' and everyone bricking themselves. It would have been way more inventive than what we got.
---
I think the fan content ideas were better. Scream was my horror growing up and I can't understand how the gens not working for 16 seconds after a hook, or the fast actions revealing the location relates to Scream's Ghostface at all. I also don't understand any of the quotes they have under his perks - 
---
&gt; "There is no need to worry. I've been preparing my whole life for this." 
---
&gt;"The night assists me and it's endless here." 
---
I don't remember these being said in any of the movies. Is it from the Netflix show? Or just made up?
---
IMO, they should just increase the duration you need to have the camera pointed in his direction, maybe also make it so that the survivor has to face him.
---
Carl is a better killer than Ghostface
---
Thank god, cause he fucking needs it
---
I think it helps if people play both sides. When someone mains one side they lack perspective and are more likely to hate the other side. With the game being designed how it is the killer has the power but their is only 1 of them whereas survivors lack power but their are 4 so they get a group mentality, it just all breeds hate.   
---
Just now I played killer and I got hate mail telling me to kill myself which is vile and shouldn't happen in most circumstances let alone over a game but people get butt hurt and annoyed because of the way the game is. People end up feeling very strongly clearly about the side they play and if they only main one side they won't understand why the nerf happened to the perk they love because they don't see how it affects the other, case in point DS when it was nerfed.
---
Wow the Plague's is amazing.
---
This entire list is irrelevant my dude.
---
either way unless the survivor has to turn and look at him its a waste...you are always looking at the killer...always...unless you are not rank 1
---
Always get our way yet always getting our best perks nerfed
---
In all honesty I just  think the developers lack vision. They came into success by mistake and have trouble consistently coming up with good design.
---
Again, if you peek, they can't spot you. You shouldn't be wandering around in your stalk, you should be crouching and moving to spots where you think survivors are. It's genuinely not hard to understand the meta they're hoping to see with GF. He's meant to be a camper, not a stealth killer. Keep your distance, set up the one hit drop, and move in.
---
I mean it makes sense for him because he got into the realm using a spell or some shit meanwhile Adiris got here like other characters, taken by the entity itself.
---
Only if you have full health?
---
I feel the same ;) but that will certainly change with the incoming 3.0 patch. they will add more piping reward when you are in chase.
---
well alot of the devs dont even play the game they make...that goes for alot of devs studios were the game is unbalanced and lacks creativity...its blatantly obvious
---
I saw that meme somewhere I believe. You got a good post with a good view. Hopefully it’ll be able to sway a few people. 
---
It’s rare, but my most enjoyable games is where the survivors is a good match for the killer and vice versa. If you get into a game and 3 gens pop off immediately or spawn in only to get downed by a roaming billy, these experiences repeatedly are bound to get on your nerves. 
---
Of course there are the people who say “Git gud” or some shit like that, but that in itself is toxic.
---
Nah b. If slenderman gets in Jeff The Killer or Freddy Fazbear become actually realistic and If either one of those gets added I'm throwing away dead by Daylight forever or accessing the files and deleting them so I can pretend they don't exist.
---
I fucking love this meme omg
---
plague was a HUGE let down, not phone boi too :(
---
That's not 99%, that's 99.9%
---
Can confirm, am old. Definitely no front-facing cameras on a flip phone.
---
true, but you're also playing with many more survivors than killers. 3 survivors per each killer you're matched with.
---
I’m a simple man. I see people reference Dead Meat, I upvote.
---
The devs have admitted that there are bugs right now. Being able to spin the camera to cancel the power is a bug and I think they said the model should have to face him to cancel it
---
I'm a huge Scream and DBD, but if they release him like this, I can't make myself buy it.
---
Yea but now people will just farm the hooked person for MoM.
---
If they DC, you've done well
---
There's a first time for everything
---
Literally everyone is better than Ghostface in his current state. Ghostfaces power is the ability to hold a knife. That’s it.
---
The issue with Ghostface is that his power is entirely reliant on survivors not seeing him. This presents an issue of survivors being able to fully deactivate his power and defang him, turning him into a powerless killer.
---
What makes matters worse is that fundamentally the killer suffers from a massive disadvantage in that survivors have a third person perspective whereas the killer is stuck in a first-person perspective. 
---
The biggest kicker is that he is not immune to detection perks. His entire power can be shut-down by a survivor following him and while using Object to track his movement. One survivor alone can deny Ghostface of his power while the other survivors work on gens. 
---
He makes a lot of noise despite being a stealth killer. Survivors actually get a notification when he is close by and potentially stalking them. 
---
Even in the magical situation where his power does work, the survivor is left exposed only for 20 seconds. If a survivor has Sprint Burst or a pallet loop nearby then you have just wasted all the time you could have spent chasing the survivor and applying pressure for nothing. 
---
BHVR have literally created a killer that can have his power deactivated by survivors with no effort and a power that broadcasts to survivors when he is in stealth. 
---
Legion is significantly better as Legions power can atleast stall survivors and not be deactivated by a survivor looking at them.
---
now imagine the benny hill theme playing during that and we're good
---
Thanks for the support. I'll try my best to keep posting!
---
The amount of survivors saying a killer is OP because they cannot escape from them every match is unbelievable.
---
I think there is a point at which a character existing in the game is worse than not, even if you love the character, just because he's terribly represented. I can imagine plenty of fun ways to experience Ghostface in DbD, and the design that's there is just not one of them and doesn't do him any justice.
---
Michael will gain evil much faster from the current Obsession, if your obsession changes Michael will not get faster progress on his Evil Within power.
---
Sure is, but not here.
---
So you're a Troll? or have very bad reading comprehension considering i already said in this comment chain that i am Rank 1.
---
You are not playing Freddy right...you go around and put them to sleep and dont follow unless you know you can get a quick hit...freddy can see everyone outside his radius...ppl go to their friends and you put them to sleep...he is def better than a simple M1 killer which is what Ghost Face is right now...wtf is mew
---
Lets play
---
Us VS Them Mentality
---
I tried deathgarden again as the hunter and got the same treatment a killer does against a premade anyways. The thing is **they dont even need to do the objective to win**, Once the timer hits 0 they can escape for free and crouch spam at the gates, sounds familiar? Also complete invincibility is so fun when multiple use it
---
It gave you advantage for playing poorly? Getting hit = one more chance to escape?
---
Not yet
---
where did you hear this because it doesnt sound like they would have done that even tho its the way it should be
---
Any comparison? I haven't seen the new one
---
If they are really scared of losing the player base, all they need to do is make the game free to play and remove nurse and huntress as free dlc and make them 5 bucks each.
---
Survivors are the radical feminists of DBD
---
I think its white robes and a different knife.
---
Slenderman is far too overrated, he isn't scary, he is just a silly internet meme at this point and he really wouldn't work as a killer.
---
i remember when i posted about slenderman before, someone said that all he does is stare at you. but it would be nice to finally have a possession power where the killer controls a survivor. whatever that encompasses. it's an idea i had a while back that seems like it'd be really great and different
---
Okay, this is the funniest version of this joke. 
---
At least the Memes are stronger than Ghostface's ability.
---
Then get good as killer? Killer always has the advantage
---
Behaviour need to go back to their roots and design a few more original idea killers. For licensed killers they're better of sticking to movie/tv show killers. I think Hellraiser and Pennywise (Clown form) are more likely to be next in line for licensed killers before a game killer.
---
Oh boy
---
Sounds like he's heavily reliant on infectious fright and BBQ.
---
Plunderers won't upgrade the first medkit you find, though.
---
I hope so too, I guess that's the whole point of public testing - they'll hopefully look at the reaction and at least fix the dodgy stealth mechanic.
---
*This right here* is the epitome of one-sided thinking that ruins the game and causes a large amount of the toxicity present in the community.
---
BUT BUT BUT MUH INFINITES
---
Not if they need to get a safe hook rescue.
---
I might

---
This is the most recent post about it, though I have seen a couple.
---
Or just don't get triggered by teabagging and go for the 4k?
---
I was thinking something similar.
---
I think it would be cool to have and bring a lot to the game
---
Its almost like it's required due to current Event scoring for emblems to be a group.  Incoming emblem buffs will make solo survivor more viable for ranking up.  Just the fact that Evader instantly gets halfway to max from a single pallet stun is huge, and Lightbringer filling from gens/totems done while you are chased.
---
Add in more aggressive anti-DC policies punishing people who just DC a lot (Ruining the other 3 survivor's game).   Solo survivor is looking hot for getting into red ranks.  If you're good at running the killer around, you should easily be able to get 2-3 iridescent emblems while your team of brainless monkeys gets the gens done.
---
Playing the game is toxic, got it
---
Completely agree with this and most of the comments so far. 
---
It’s really easy to tell when someone doesn’t play the other side as they have no empathy for them at all and treat the players like shit. 
---
Playing both sides not only makes you better at playing your role but also you quickly understand what feels really shitty to have done to you by the other side; letting you avoid playing like it. 
---
Thing is you’ll almost never be thanked for playing in a fun and fair way, you’ll often be taunted and insulted regardless. 
---
It’s nice to see some wholesome chat logs being posted on Reddit recently, showing that there are some really nice people playing this game too :)
---
I believe Peanits said it should be 1 second, but numbers are always subject to change
---
In many other games you see this beta and think "oh ok they'll listen and fix" but you just don't get a good history of that with BHVR. The best they did recently is only somewhat nerfing pig, arguably the weakest killer in the game, instead of extremely nerfing pig.
---
The text is left over from before the DS change when nothing changed the obsession. That said, it is still accurate. You can never have more than one obsession in a match, but who that is can change now.
---
He's telling someone they are garbage, but he is acting like a shitty person? Very ironic.
---
I am just tired of survivors getting second chance perks tbh. Same with killers getting exposed effects. 
---
I wish some perks cant mix with others to maintain a fair balance. Like MoM and dead hard for example. It's just annoying.
---
Man, you're the one saying that Doctor is decent, uses NOED and is rank 1. If you got there because of the DCs is understadable, but because of ability? I don't think so you must be rank 10 at least. So good luck getting there.
---
Right right. Imagine playing as Wraith, who has no other chance but to hit you with M1. He hits you two times to down you. You get back up and fully healed. The next time he hits you, you have MoM ready. What should be the hit to down you becomes the hit to proc MoM. So basically you´re rewarded with free chance because you as a survivor played poorly and got hit. That´s not really how it should be, is it?
---
Yeah, well Furtive Chase changes the obsession on unhooks, my theory is that you can get the considerable stalk rate increase on potentially every survivor this way. Is this untrue?
---
Whats wrong with the Dragon Ball Z community?
---
It is just a new born baby of them.
---
Pretty much.
---
They literally sent Ben B Singer death threats because Goku lost to Superman in Death Battle. One guy actually assaulted him at a convenient.
---
I love how this always goes one way. 
---
Rancor, NOED... killers have over powered perks that are free as well and reward them for being bad. 
---
Should selfcare only work if the survivor is in the terror radius?!? 🥴
---
I can see that point of view. Just don't agree with it. Ghostface is a part of a story, the killers were all interconnected and a big part of the cool factor was the story and how twisted it got. This doesn't have anything about that in it at all. It's something completely unrelated, except for a mask. Why not make it a new character? The original characters are awesome on their own without needing a half-ass attempt at hooking them to something well-known.
---
I totally agree but real talk, are people claiming they are oppressed? In a videogame? They voluntarily bought and play? Like I agree with people saying play both sides but if a game gets you THAT riled up, go outside man, read a book, take a break it's just a video game at the end of the day, the devs are just people, everyone that sends and receives hate mail is human, idk man
---
Yea, we don't need true first person, the third person camera we have is just too generous.   Pull it a bit closer to the survivor and cut out some of the extraneous field of view we have.
---
Myer's house in Haddon Field would be a lot riskier a gen if you couldn't just look down the stairs while working on the gen at 2 of it's 3 spawn points, with the third having an easy window to jump for a lot of distance instead.

---
but if you can know he position of the survivor with sound instead of visual, what's the concrete difference for the surv ? he still can't escape you.
---
Oh I know, and I can’t wait for the new fun Freddy rework to come out so they can nerf him into the dust and remove half of what he can do. Mark my words, he’ll be back in the dumpster in about 2 months...
---
Slenderman himself wasn’t scary at all, the game was scary because of the jumpscares, you know the cheapest way to scare people.
---
And slenderman doesn’t fit through any normal doorway so they would have to change all maps with doorways just for 1 character.
---
Just 360 ur cam irl lmao
---
There’s literally been nothing but original killers for a while now.....
---
basically
---
Oh I forgot about that lol.
---
Maybe the entity can work a deal with Apple.
---
I don’t think they will add Pennywise, we already have clown and yes they are different but still they look a lot like eachother
---
ai play both survivor and killer and I mainly see killers bitching... ._.
---
No, that’s how you 4K, survivors are just entitled. Also holding the game hostage means making the game last a long time and the survivor can’t do anything about it.
---
{-}7
---
WAAAAH 
---
translation: looks great! Your work is awesome
---
Yeah... because he's a ***JOKE***
---
(I'm sorry if I offended anyone, I just want Ghostface to be good).
---
I wouldn’t spend shards to unlock this loser.
---
This defeating the purpose of testing him
---
Huntress has been getting kind of shafted with maps and tiles that aren’t hatchet friendly. It’s been awhile since I’ve seen my usual streamers  play her so maybe it’s better?
---
Why would you need NOED if you're a good Doctor? haha. I wouldn't use NOED if i 3 or 4 k constantly. Unless you really want that last survivor haha.
---
Incase you didn’t notice, spirit had noed anyway, haunted grounds didn’t matter in this case.
---
Yeah! And lets add Jeff the Killer and all other not scary creepy pasta characters.
---
I play about 50/50 and have never had the issues you complain about. If a survivor is looping so badly that you absolutely can’t get them why would you waste time chasing them still? 
---
I love your statistic at the end there. You seem to forget that games consist of 1 killer and 4 survivors, so yeah, “statistically” at any given time there are more survivors. The only reason I might play survivor more is because the killer wait time is so damn long. 
---
And I normally have far less stress playing the killer. I also tend to enjoy it more. I can certainly say that I am good enough as killer to actually hit my target based on my own skill rather than the mistake of a survivor. Let’s be honest here. If you see a survivor and run him down as a killer, it’s not because the survivor made a mistake, it’s because the killer is designed to catch up to and KILL the survivor. Again, this speaks volumes about your play style.
---
The ending of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
---
I liked the perspective in this meme. Nice meme!
---
I love this song with morden remix
---
she's the entity tho
---
The plague was really scary when she was announced, even look quite overpowered being able to "block" gens, but turns out you can counter her by completly ignoring his power...
---
I dont think you should be told how yo play the game by the people against you. As long as you're having fun and not being toxic, nothing matters.
---
They're just salty and stupid af. You are at no fault. I'm a survivor main and I can clearly tell when a killer is being scum or just playing for fun. Sounds like you were just looking to have a good time, and things made an unfortunate turn for them.
---
Can I be featured too if I play Freddy against inbreeds?
---
Not really anymore. The devs are aware of his problems. I made a post about it just now.
---
Yeah and he is useless when you play against survivors who look around (so all survivors)
---
BHVR: \*makes legion and Ghostface shit\*
---
Also BHVR: \*reworks Freddy\*
---
Freddy: peace out shitty killers as I join the superior race.
---
Nurse does not need any perk that is about windows or pallets. Its all about field of view, detection and deadly exposed effects.
---
&gt; So is it a shitty thing to do to slug second last survivor to find the last one without allowing hatch escape?
---
no thats called playing to win
---
I’m guessing the fixes will happen over a period of time. Hopefully won’t take nearly as long as Legion took.
---
I can see that with base nurse. But then you throw in the extra range/speed/extra blinks and it just becomes frustrating.
---
That's quite a long list.
---
The Flo Rida version? That one is great, I like it too.
---
The only thing you'll get is your post being deleted.
---
It got a relaunch where they changed a lot of things from the original its pretty good imo
---
Well, the PTB is already on, so yo can spend them now, the cash you have in the ptb should stay the same.
---
I frequent this sub often and rarely see survivors claiming this. The majority of posts I see complaining about OP killers is Legion, and that’s mainly because he’s just boring and one dimensional. 
---
I very rarely see a survivor complain about not being able to escape every game, and if I do it gets a downvote.
---
You dont buy the halloween chapter for laurie, you buy it for scary pants myers.
---
Hag- Body camp with hex traps 
---
Leather face- face camp with no remorse
---
Myers- actually pretty fun for the most part
---
Pig- Proxy camp with stupid ass face trap things
---
Trapper- traps at every pallet so looping is a hassle 
---
Nurse- DC
---
Wraith- WTF why is this guy always right behind me
---
Doc- lol this is pathetic
---
Freddy- lol even more pathetic
---
Clown- Can you stop fucking throwing those fucking bottles at my damn head pleaseeee
---
That was the right play actually, A lot of the time they find the hatch and leave their teammate to die for an easy escape which is an annoying mechanic tbh. The extremely long bleed out times assist you with the risk of them being able to revive themselves from that state, But the risk beats the hatch escape imo
---
The story of 99% of players who play Hag on PS4. They just sit on your body at the hook and place hex traps at the hook so they can teleport whenever someone tries to unhook you.
---
Just a little bit more... just a little bit more...
---
DANGIT I OVER DID IT!
---
This rarely works against more experienced survivors because they're able to predict this mindgame and avoid it easily.
---
Ya like I said this extreme is really rare. It's actually the first I've seen in 70 hours. Most of the end game chats is usually the "baby killer" "tunnelling" ect. which I feel is really more to try to get a reaction than be actually toxic at this point
---
Im going hard with mad grit.
---
He's like a challenged child of Pig and Myers that has to wear waterwings when he eats soup
---
I mean... his power is negated by just looking at him so hes basically just an M1
---
I feel that on a personal level. It hurts.
---
It’s supposed to be like after looking at him for a second I think, not instantly, but it’s still garbage even then and you can get detected when the survivor didn’t even see you or know you were there. It’s dumb as shit. Watched Farmer go into a kill with friends and test it out and it wasn’t consistent in the slightest so if they don’t fix it, hes definitely gonna be current Freddy tier lmao
---
The beta isn’t meant to replace an alpha test or quality assurance team which would have detected this massive issue immediately
---
Dammit squidward.
---
Just like I said. I dont care. This person deserves some negative attention, and a big fat ban.
---
Post "nerf" Legion is actually fine. I have no problems playing as them and getting kills.
---
I personally didnt get to enjoy much of anything. As soon as I got DS, they nerfed it. Just got MoM and already nerfing it. Yet so many killer perks need to be nerfed, like Dying Light and NOED.
---
Yeah but then she would be to slow and they’d have to up her speed making her have a lower skill cap and (still one of) the best power(s) in the game
---
I don’t know if my terminology is right but hopefully you get the idea
---
Just ignore them. People are really poor sports in this game and if they lose it can't possibly be because they were legitimately outplayed, you had to have cheated. 
---
This is why I'm glad there's no post game chat on PS4 and I don't want any.
---
Maybe I'm being too optimistic and naive, but I think most of the reason he's weak is because of the bugs. At least one of the things I assumed with him when they spoke about him before was that your character had to PHYSICALLY look at him to cancel stalk. The fact that downed and hooked survivors can cancel it too is crazy. 
---
I was so excited to play as and against a good stealth killer, I hope they fix him soon.
---
Hopefully someone with experience on the PS4 version can chime in. They'll know way better than I ever could.
---
That said, just know that the PS4 version is not nearly as optimized as the PC version. There will be a lot of times where latency and bugs can make your efforts to play effectively difficult, even at a relatively casual pace.
---
I'd say try it out first of all before even considering DLC. Some players can get annoying, regardless of if they on your team or not, and that rubs quite a few players the wrong way.
---
I've had plenty fun with the PC version, but my opinions on the game can only go so far in that regard.
---
The devs gave 2 free keys to anyone who already owned the game before the new update
---
I was going to give the clauds on the ground the hatch, because from how she was playing I felt she must've been new, but she crawled out of sight ):
---
Ehh, I’d reset your router, It could just be the game server but I’ve played a few games where i get a laggy killer, It doesn’t feel good.
---
 1. Right-Click the Dead by Daylight Application in your Steam Library  
---
2. Access Properties  
---
3. Access the "Beta" Tab  
---
4. Enter the password "DbdPublicTest" (without quotes) in the Text Field  
---
5. Click Check Code  
---
6. Select "public-test" from the dropdown
---
I loved this meme.
---
You SHOULD be fine, I doubt they actually have evidence of you doing these things if you didn't do them. Is weirdly accurate chainsaws  even something that's reportable?
---
In any case, I've barely seen the support team react to real reports, so you should be fine.
---
He stares at you and you start back at him.
---
Ready for the iasip memes with Charlie and Mac dining out.
---
Exactly, they really should look at billy and spirit when designing new killers
---
I get downvoted every time I speak this truth, but new DS allows you to pop off a hook and get right back on a gen without healing. If the killer stumbles accross you and downs you, all they've done is waste time and you get a free escape. If the killer doesn't come, you can do the gen in absolute safety. It's very strong.
---
&gt;  It could just be the game server
---
There is no game server, the killer is the Host
---
Spaghetty, I've played this game a fair while and I agree with you. The chase for releasing "balanced" characters is a tricky one and I find that when the new Killer just ends up having to chase survivors in the exact same way, just with an added gimmick, I wonder why I even play this game.
---
Licensed killer can't be sold with shard.
---
alright, ill do that even though they all had yellow/green pings on the pre-game lobby
---
No. The other side is trash.
---
Then resetting your router if you get different randoms with the same complaints would be wise
---
Don’t need to be sorry, but thanks anyways
---
yea i decided to bust her out the other day cause i'm awful with her but i'm trying to learn.
---
 i also somehow have some sweet cosmetics for her.  the ww2 nurse outfit with the gas mask.
---
i wonder how confused those survivors were when they watched me blink everywhere but near them.   i did manage to get 2 hits tho so the game wasnt a complete waste, but man idk how people use her well.
---
Idk, if he works as the devs are saying he's supposed to work he won't seem that bad. It's basically having EW3 ready to pop on single survivors within a couple seconds with the only caveat being they can't spot you.
---
If anything I would buff his perks, and idk his add-ons but give him a way to have no TR in some form consistently throughout the match (after setup) and he could be really good.
---
I was hoping for more synergy with I'm All Ears and Furtive Chase. I was hoping for Furtive Chase to be 4 tokens and 4/5/6 meters meaning at max tokens you reduce TR by 24 meters 24 meters being the default TR of low TR killers.
---
If you can get that you will have godly tracking in a chase since you'd have 0 TR and everytime they vault the survivor will highlight themselves for you.
---
Thank you to everyone who replied to my post, I have decided to buy it.
---
Nobody is going to do anything about the fact that you got trolled. Just move on.
---
His power shouldn't be able to be canceled at all. Looking at ghostface should hinder the stalk, not the stealth.
---
The only way to get him out of stealth should be for him to swing, or get stunned.
---
One survivor looking at you should protect them alone from your stalking ability, but not break your stealth.
---
The noises he makes should also just not exist. All the wooshes and noises he makes stealth should go.
---
It's not legimate feedback if it isn't constructive . Although I'm pretty sure they'll buff him spirit style
---
You don’t have to yet, You can wait until you get different randoms with the same complaints, I’d wait until you get pings below 100 though, If they were yellow it could just be them matching a distant killer
---
Haha thanks. Luckily it’s just importing the image so the machine does all the work, I just have to pull up the vinyl in the other spots. It’s pretty neat though
---
As a survivor main, I personally love playing against tough and “OP” killers, obviously this isn’t a real life situation, but I couldn’t imagine that if it was a real life situation that it would be something easy to escape
---
I mean what do you expect there are two sides to play and each one has its own struggle so it’s always gonna be an us vs them mentality
---
Everyone’s naming killer perks but imo Deliverance looks dope.
---
BHVR has dissapointed me
---
Potentially unpopular opinion from someone who hasn't tried ghostface yet: 
---
I would much rather have killers be dogshit weak on release and get buffed into relevance than super strong on release, requiring nerfs later. 
---
You can always just not play GF, but if he was too strong, you couldn't ban him from your surv games, you'd just be stuck dealing with it
---
Spirit was good on the start of ptb, then they nerfed her then buffed back to what she was on ptb
---
"weirdly accurate chainsaws" as in "you knew where we were bc you wall-hacked"
---
...but it isnt fake
---
Genuine question: Do you get any rewards for achievements, I see many people doing adept achievements etc and I cannot quite understand why. Is it just a feel good thing or is there a reward that I don't know about.
---
Technically not an iconic part of ghostface.
---
they only have the license to the mask. Not the movie character, so whatever lore they decide and whatever they decide is iconic to him is now iconic.
---
I feel like giving him the ability to find every survivor he wants, whenever would be to strong. How can you even hide then? Imagine you combine that with dying light to kill your obsession straight away
---
It is true that opinions vary ofcourse. I myself dont like billy that much when i do play survivor but i enjoy facing trappers.
---
This sub has a rule in place to protect hackers and cheaters and other shitheads from having their screennames shared after they ruin our games. A lot of people like 7amamShud get weirdly defensive about it. Possibly because they think the rule is a genuinely good idea and they're stupid, possibly because "it's against the rules" and they're autistic.
---
If they gave the nurse blink charges, they would have to up her movement speed to 110. Her base speed is so slow that if they changed her blinks to work more like spirit's power, nurse would be F tier. I am all about making choices with my power. I'm not about giving survivors a free escape. Especially with how many large maps this game has.
---
Because why would the killer care about WGLF? And not that many people run deliverance so the killer may not even think about that. Those perks are nothing like MoM.
---
[BHVR right now](https://imgur.com/gallery/DflFN)
---
Anytime I see that in a name. I want to ruin the game for there 0-4 viewers. People with ttv in there name never have viewers.
---
Just takes practice. Once you get the muscle memory down for blink ranges,  you'll be fine.
---
Doc - I’m gonna make you scream every 3 seconds
---
Nurse - Fuck your pallets
---
I know a lot of people consider things like camping and tunneling to be toxic, but as annoying as they are, they are legitimate strategies. For me it's more the behaviours that are on par with bullying, like waiting at the exit gates just to start t-bagging the killer. Or when the killer pretends to take you to the hatch only to grab you again and hook you. Just my opinion.
---
Just comparing the live/PTB versions of certain cosmetics.
---
Format is before and after, live vs PTB.
---
The PTB wouldn't render in anything other than ultra for some reason unfortunately. I might update later (probably not tho).
---
Surely that'd come under wall hacking? In any case I don't think you've got an issue. People salt report all the time, I hugely doubt they'd go the whole way as to fill out the report form for it. I'm guessing this was PC
---
Sounds really cool. I've always thought a skinwalker type killer would be really awesome. I'd suggest that they be primarily a stealth killer. They can turn into any replica of a survivor on the map and they CAN interact with gens/ totems and heal survivors. Their primary power would be "transformation" where they slowly reveal their real skin, which would have sound effects. Any survivor who doesn't catch on fast enough and is in the transformation radius becomes exposed.
---
It would be terrifying to play against and put survivors on edge, but would also require pre planning from the killer. Being able to interact with objects would be essential for a doppelganger or skinwalker killer in order to "blend in". Being able to cleanse totems would work incredibly well for something like haunted grounds (one interaction). There could be addons like when you begin to start a generator with another survivor you're actually regressing it, not repairing it. Or if healing if you "heal" them enough they become broken. You would be able to transform while doing these things.
---
Sorry I think about a concept for this killer a lot. I think stealth killers are the most fun to play against.
---
Yea what the fuck is up with their design process recently? None of these killers are new or fresh. It’s just rehashed shit over and over again
---
I watched tru3talent use her. He does 2 blinks. One to get close, and the second to adjust to the juke. That alone was a big help, then it’s just getting used to timing and distance
---
I always get wierd looks when I say that, as a survivor main, the killers are supposed to be stronger than me. I'm playing a survival horror game, not a fucken engine repair sim.
---
No he is complete shit, even if they fix the OoO bug he will still be shit because there is basically no way to see if you are looking at you, that’s why I think they need to have the character themselves look at him
---
yep ..PC
---
Yeah I could see her becoming 110%, or at least something above 100%
---
Just wait for the teletubby skins
---
Survivors have been receiving nerf after nerf since like spring last year, what are you talking about? The recent nerfs aren't the only nerfs BHVR have done to them in the recent years.
---
"trolled"? Does that text look like "trolling"?
---
oh thats so sad. yah barely gets played anymore since people can just ignore her power.
---
I feel like legion needs something extra for basically having four different idle animations.
---
Nooo, Kate’s dark hair and Nea’s look a lot worse imo, I use those ones all the time. Guess I’ll have to see how they look when I actually get the update on console :(
---
I always thought Megs was just a head scarf, it actually looks like hair now.
---
Yeah they'd have to make her faster, something above 100%. Maybe 110%.
---
still waiting on that painters skin for jane.
---
Just spam the attack button lol
---
It couldn’t it’s a dumb idea, as a survivor they could you know, just drop the phone on the ground.
---
Him being looked at to remove his power isn't accurate to his lore. He literally poses for the camera and takes pictures of his own murders to get a good pic for the newspaper. Realistically, he'd WANT survivors to look at him
---
ty

The Ghost &gt; The Ghost Face
---
GHOSTFACE? MORE LIKE THIS KIKLER SUCKS ASSFACE.
---
I would like two classes. Myers, billy, huntress in heavy because of the utility of their power. Hag, legion and freddy as lighter killers because there power is useful in circumstance, but not as supressing as high geir killers. 
---
Although I dissagree with 100% movement speed for some killers. Killers need to be faster than survivors, thats just how a lot of killers do chases. 100% speed would severely limit killers. Huntress is 110% rather than 115% and it really does hurt her in loops where she cant hatchet over walls or pallets. Mabey a new killer with an actually good power could come out but be pushed down to say 105%. (Killers character models are larger than survivors, meaning that they need to take larger turns on loops. 105% might still be too slow to combat this, mabey an oddball number like 107%).
---
I like the idea of classes, not in a literal sense as in heavy should be played like this and light needs to be played like this, but in a figurative way that kinda describes how their powers work.
---
“Or annoying to play against”  and I do believe the commenter you’re responding to was only talking about the survivors experiences against various killers.
---
Lmao, jumping straight to insults when you have no argument? First of all, hag doesn't HAVE to use totems. Hag is my main and the only totem perk I use for her is ruin. You are the one not capable of looking at this game objectively. Look at this thread and see everyone telling you how dumb your ideas are. I have many hours on both survivor and killer, but can understand where changes need to be made and where things are fine as is. You played, what? 30 hours and you think you know what balance is? 
---
Also, I believe something should be done about camping but your idea is idiotic and doesn't even address it. I'm just going to block you so I don't have to look at your idiotic posts anymore. You are literally braindead.
---
No idea why Hags lay all 10 on one hook, one does the job.
---
GHOSTFACE WAS JUST A HUGE BUILD UP TO A GIANT DISAPPOINTMENT BUT I SHOULDN’T BE SURPRISED TBH
---
Maybe it could simply lose lose effectiveness while being stared at and give him the ability to silently blink from cover to cover to allow him to get out of the players line of sight due to their fov being “All seeing” 
---
(disabling his ability to attack and lowering his movement speed for 4 seconds after blinking)
---
If it was a real life situation most people would have a heart attack and the others would get slaughtered...
---
You lost all credibility the moment you used autism as a way to try and insult me.
---
Yeah, different tastes! I know that a lot of people dislike billy for how often they see him. He can definitely get old.
---
I absolutely D E S P I S E trapper for how non-interactive he is sometimes. I think iridescent stone is the most stupid add on created.
---
I WANTED BILLY LOOMIS AND SIDNEY NOT BEHAVIORS GHOSTFACE OC
---
It's so bad cause you can just play shape and stalk without getting ripped out if looked at and if you have right add ons you can put ALL survivors in the exposed status forever. Thus making ghostface the dollar store worse version of Micheal
---
I only ever had that problem once playing killer, and it was entirely my own fault. There are other ways to play mind games on a more long term level than just with loops. If a survivor thinks they’re so great at looping that you won’t even bother chasing them, they’ll usually slip up somewhere else down the line. And then usually DC (lol) but you still get the satisfaction of nabbing them (seriously, I switch between survivor and killer and I still do not understand people who’ll actually play the game, earn bp, and then DC once there’s even a slight chance of not surviving. Like you still get points my dude)
---
Idunno about Hibly. But Hunny absolutely is fun.
---
I wouldnt remove it, but id make him way faster
---
Both of them should take lesson from Daddy Myers, a fellow killer experienced in knifing survivors to death.
---
Its the latter. Despite the fact that survivors have a 3rd person camera the dev's feel the need to give survivors extreme advanced warning of all of the stealth killers in the game.
---
When you have a game that depends on a ton of licenses with multiple entities, the last thing you want to do is push the line on what you are legally allowed to include. The possible backlash from current and future IP holders wouldn't be worth pleasing the few players that actually care that much about Ghostface.
---
I think %70 is a fair estimate.
---
You know what i'm gonna miss most about Freddy? Survivors teabagging before running away.
---
Much rather they start out weak and then get buffed before official release. Cuz if a killer is too strong and gets released, the matches become oppressive. If the killer is too weak, you just play someone else and wait for them to buff him when they realize the chapter isn't selling, whereas everyone will buy an OP killer, so there's far less incentive to adjust him quickly then. 
---
Also if they go too nuts with the kit, you get killers like Spirit. I like her, don't get me wrong. But her kit is so fucking bloated. Her lack of window animation coupled with passive phasing is so unnecessary with how good her power alone is, let alone her add-ons. But I digress.
---
just like my ideia, and the more he stalk more time you stay exposed, so a simple loop cannot negate his power.
---
Happy Pride month to those who celebrate it!
---
It clearly is. Welcome to the Internet.
---
Uh that's not what iconic means. It just means Ghostface won't be an iconic killer. It's a costume.
---
I WANTED STU MACHER NOT BHVRS OC. WHY IS HE SO FUCKING SHIT? BEHAVIOR IF YOU COULDN'T GET STU/BILLY AND SIDNEY AS THE SURVIVOR JUST DON'T PUT GHOSTFACE IN THE GAME AT ALL. BUT YOU GOTTA GET THAT GHOSTFACE MONEY HUH?
---
Its still not enough for a strong killer
---
I dont like that though. It makes skill a lot less necessary because you will now eventually catch up.
---
This does not mean much. People are apparently interpreting this to mean you actually have to turn your character model toward Ghostface, but I can't see how that could be the conclusion from any of this. This just seems to mean you have to keep your camera on Ghostface for a second, rather than being able to rotate your camera without stopping. I'm pretty sure this is even working as intended already, and it still means you can break him out of his ability without actually spotting him, by turning your camera in 1-second intervals.
---
The thing also is that, no matter what adjustments they could apply to the "break Ghostface out of his ability" mechanic - and even if they were to remove that mechanic completely - he will still be a relatively weak, and relatively boring and uninspired design. Best case scenario, he can apply the Exposed status effect to survivors before starting a chase. Other than that, and apart from being able to sneak up on survivors to an extent, he has no further utility whatsoever. And crucially, no utility as far as mobility, chase tools, and means of wasting time go. He would still strictly be an underwhelming Myers. Legion, Plague and Ghostface have all been rather underwhelming (post-rework Legion, that is - original Legion was just downright awful): all they do with their ability is injure survivors (or apply the Exposed status effect, in Ghostface's case, which is functionally the same thing, both having upsides and downsides). Then they have to chase completely vanilla. Plague does have Corrupt Purge, but most even only somewhat-competent survivors will regularly not cleanse against her.
---
That also sounds cool i think the best part with this kimd of killer would actually be the scary suprising effect : D dbd used to be a scary game years ago when noone had an idea how to play nowadays is just some headbanging weird killers and survivors bouncing like the are rubber balls
---
And pointing would make sense like
---
“Hey guys he’s watching us”
---
“Stop repairing the generator”
---
Nope
---
I like the camera, personally. I love the little animation where the lens retracts. lol
---
FOREVER!  The whole reason I bought DBD was Freddy.
---
see folks, this is why we have a ptb
---
Just stop.
---
Seeing Feng Min as a stand in for Marie Kondo put the biggest smile on my face
---
No it’s not that you’ll be queuing a lot, it’s just that in my opinion I tend to have a lot more fun when I’m playing in a party.
---
Farming for blood points isn’t too bad it’s just trying to get enough so you can max out your survivor. You get blood points for everything you do like building generators, escaping, healing teammates, and running from the killer.
---
It’s not bad to farm points. Skills are usually around 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000 in the beginning. In a game you’ll roughly get around 6,000 to 20,000 depending on how well you do and know what to go for. The only problem is one you try to level up multiple survivors and/or killers it becomes a lot of blood points spent.
---
Wow, it looks like they decided to release these earlier. Nice way to celebrate the start of Pride month.
---
To a killer, that means you spend 2-3 minutes not on a gen due to the long self heal.
---
Except those survivors are so rare that you'd only match with them every few days, (Unless you're rank 1).
---
Anyway, point is, skill goes a long, LONG way
---
The stun at the end of frenzy, when the character orgasms and the screen goes black, it shaves time off that, it’s 4 second by default.
---
&gt;  reference to the original movie
---
Which they don't have the license to.  I wouldn't be surprised if the movie license holders specifically asked them to remove it.
---
The stun after the Feral Frenzy ability ends where the legion can't move fast or attack is the cooldown, its 4 seconds by default and with the Cold Dirt and the Joey's Mixtape it becomes 3 seconds.
---
Yes! For a new Pig main I love this so much!
---
Hahah yes. Maybe the Entity will decide it needs to do its business by itself this time, then throw a survivor onto a hook out of mercy for GF while at it.
---
When Legion comes out of Frenzy, he is fatigued for around 4 seconds. During this period he has a dark VFX and is slowed down significantly.
---
Cooldown reduction reduces the time he spends in this state after Finishing his Frenzy by a solid amount of time. I believe the cold dirt reduces this 4 second stun down to 3.4 or so seconds.
---
Says you. Lots of us like the camera. Plus, honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the movie license holders specifically asked them to remove it.
---
yeah i jumped the window and sand bagged someone else
---
I think there should be an overhual on that screen. It should show swf, what charicters played who, and the chat should tell who left and when(as well as show messages from before the match ended).
---
Yeah I think I plan to focus on one survivor to max them then move on so I’m not passing Bp around to 3 or more at various levels.
---
But I’m still torn on buying it
---
I think maybe it should just reduce the exposure rate instead of breaking it. that way survivors can't just ruin his ability outright.
---
No, you’re not a horrible or toxic killer. This a common tactic to getting 4ks and many killlers do it. It’s completely fair since the game still ends. The End Game Collapse is in place now as well to prevent games from dragging on in the end.
---
The only way to really hold the game hostage now as killer is to bodyblock a survivor somewhere and refuse to hit them so they’re stuck. That is bad behavior and IS bannable. Just don’t do that and you’re fine.
---
I honestly thought that David skin was a recreation of what Brad Pitt looked like in inglorious basterds
---
Bugged or not he would still be a horrible killer as his design is fundamentally flawed and just doesn't work with both the games design and map design.
---
BHVR WHY COULDNT YOU PUT SIDNEY IN BECAUSE NOW I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO UNTIL GHOSTFACE IS FIXED
---
Where did I insult you? No one said she “had” to use her totems, You are the first. And Wow, What a surprise, a camping hag defending her ability to camp, plot twist. Who knew that person lived in the end? I mean he has a movie coming up so... 
---
And No shit, You’re not one of them though. 
---
Most are like you if i had to guess, Keep the game as it is, If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. That kind of mindset is why dead by daylight isn’t as big as it should be. It’s essentially a Friday the 13th with much more variety. 
---
You have more hours? And the best you can do is defend the hags ability to hard camp? Lol Probably sounds silly when it’s said. 
---
What an idiot, Then again I guess your character is fitting? I wonder
---
I just wanted Sidney and a woodsboro map too bro like I get it we only got the license for the mask but come on man. Can’t the universe just align itself to work out this one time for this one thing?
---
i do hope that they fix it while the PTB is still up so we can properly test him and have him be the way he was supposed to be
---
Am I the only one that chases flashlight users who think their Jedi by running at an angle so they can't blind me and only turning towards them fully mid swing? Makes em mad.
---
I think Nea's has the potential to look great on a better quality setting, but yeah Kate's is a little too dark for my tastes.
---
I think Claudette got a minor downgrade. It seems her hair has no bulk anymore. A darn shame since it's the only one I own in this image set haha.
---
Not to be rude, but if you think the current issues with Ghostface are "mildly inconveniencing", you clearly haven't tried playing him.
---
It was for kyf also, but you dont have to believe me. Do so at your own risk.
---
Scary Movie sucks balls
---
Fffs, what kind of logic is that? Overpowered characters are no better than underpowered ones. Survivors don't have to suffer for Killers because BHVR cannot create a BALANCED character.
---
I thought an emoji and calling Wraith, Nurse tier would be enough of an indicator for it to be sarcasm but I guess not. Sorry, my bad.
---
just use knife scratches with beast marks
---
No rewards, some people are just completionists.
---
Survivors should have built in self care and the ability to get back up once downed. I think if survivors had more survivability it wouldn't matter as much how powerful the killers are.
---
It's Jake and Dave, right...?
---
Ahahahahahahaha
---
Imagine thinking the report system does anything
---
That’s the greatness of having this game be run by an omnipotent Entity. They can explain it away by saying that the survivors physically cannot drop the phone, or that if they tried the Entity would just make it reappear on their person.
---
A stealth killer, that gives you a warning when he's in stealth and close to you. Fuckin hell, who comes up with this stuff?
---
Mask, oops
---
Ouch this hurts to hear
---
The bottom one for glasses Kate looks worse hair wise
---
Idk man I call shenanigans
---
I mean I’d definitely go for it. I absolutely love it.
---
Exactly--tell us something we don't know.
---
What’s the point of any game? People like meeting goals and completing challenges, achievements are an avenue to that
---
You can buy them, but not licensed killers.
---
You can save up
---
That would just be pay to win.
---
You forgot to mention the "both sides" assholes that flock to these topics like flies to shit.
---
Like, really? You're gonna complain on REDDIT of a places? People on Reddit are the definition of "I don't give a fuck!"
---
I don't think that's true once you get to red rank. As i said above, I did two gens and unhooked two people and saftey pipped. I'm rank 3.
---
It's not his release form, you are supposed to have to look directly at him for a second or so, not a 360 camera spin, it's a bug, that's what the PTB is for
---
FREDDY &gt; GHOSTFACE
---
Straight nerf to the perk though.   They didn't touch stun times, despite saying they would.  Releasing it as is without the counter-balance may as well be a giant FUCK YOU to anyone running the perk.
---
hm. i used cold dirt and didnt notice that much of a difference so i thought it did something else. i guess i just hadnt played him in a while and wasnt used to it
---
Survivors physically facing him doesn’t seem to be the intended counter (since the survivor’s head turns with the camera now). 
---
From what they’ve said so far it seems like he is supposed be tripped by the camera, but the time needed to break his stealth is too short and the section of your FOV he occupies to be considered seen is too wide (supposed to only be tripped if he’s in your center screen, right now he apparently can be tripped from the corner of it).
---
People need to stop treating him like he's a killer meant to chase survivors. He isn't. His ability is a detection ability... he's best played as a proxy camper.
---
They need to get rid of the survivors looking at him stops his power, that's just dumb. No killers power should be cancelled by being looked at.
---
I still think being able to cancel his power with just the camera alone is stupid either way. Survivors have a 3rd person 180 degree FOV, the fact they can sit still and just constantly be looking around and find GF that way is stupid.
---
I 100% agree they should revamp it. But turns out you can at least see who plays who, by going to the settings screen in the lobby, at the top theres a tab.
---
I love OhTofu's benny's hill moments.
---
Footsteps have been silent for over a year.   Will be a good buff to killers should they be able to fix it for more than 1 day before it breaks again.
---
Why?
---
Clown
---
Depends how you see countering. Its like being against infinite tier 3 Myers. She can still do well, she just loses a part of her power
---
I'm rather new to the game but pig seems pretty balanced to me. (She's my main)
---
Nice thanks for the detailed info !
---
Yeah, but in his current state hes shit which is the point
---
I am not sure the Entity can afford those monitor stands...
---
But his current state isn't his intended state it's a bug state which is MY point
---
Although I don't think you did, anyone could take 15 minutes to photoshop a chat session to include hate speech and upload it, claiming it was real and demanding that people 'do something about it'. Next thing you know, innocent people are getting doxxed. 
---
While I'm sure you and /u/deserterkalak have good intentions, allowing screen names in posts like these leads to abuse.
---
The equal speed was simply a way to balance out the one hit down of a proposed 'heavy killer' lighter killers like freddy or legion would still be the mutli-hit killers. I just need an injection of killer fear in this game basically. I'm not scared by killers I can take multiple hits from.
---
Same on PS4 for me, crazy the lengths some will go to to send hateful messages.
---
June 18
---
Isn't it a 60 second cooldown at level 3?
---
It’s just a game, that you payed to play, if you are having fun and enjoying yourself so be it, don’t let other people dictate how you play, or dictate to you what fun should be. 
---
You are the killer, your job is to kill the survivors, your not throwing a fucking birthday party, where you have to make sure everyone’s having a good time,
---
Is object of obsession stopping his power from across the map intended?
---
And deaf
---
No. Michael isn't OP and he can wipe a whole team out in one EW3.
---
That’s what I’d like to know too, cause that would be broken as fuck.
---
YES! They need to do this more!
---
What's jungle?
---
Some of these are good changes. I like Meg's hair change especially! Feels less like a cheap wig now, maybe I'll finally get it. Feng's is nice too, the bangs are a huge improvement.  
---
But Nea's green hair in particular makes me nervous? I've been running that hair since they messed with her pixie cut ^((which they kinda fixed, but I got too attached to the green one to change back)). It seemed like one that just didn't need to be touched. Idk, maybe it'll look better in live, but the less waves and stuff bothers me. I thought the wavy look was a huge part of its appeal &amp; now it looks pretty straightened. :((

---
I posted this on another comment but I agree...in a chase you wouldn't want to point...in those cases you just RUN and hope your chase/loop skills can outlast the 20 second Exposed status
---
BHVR needs to stop giving survivors control over killers powers.
---
So you agree with me right? If so yay.
---
Aye I agree.
---
Wait, what did f13 and last year do
---
claudette is a better stealth killer than ghostface, and she’s not even a killer
---
Then ghostface will get buffed three time and be high tier as well, how are you sure that won't happen? You have no need to be rude
---
it’s like bbq except you only see gens and you get less BP
---
*woooooosh*
---
It's what we deserve after waiting for so long.
---
IDC IF THEY WON'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHTS TO MAKE COSMETICS FOR MM AND LAURIE, I WANT OLD ASS LAURIE STRODE AND I WANT HER NOW
---
Yes, it's the same dilemma as always. Experienced survivors could easily deal with it, it would be challenging but definitely possible, the matches would be intense. But beginners would be absolutely demolished. Most can't last 20 seconds without getting hit, no way. I think the devs always think of the beginners first, experienced players second.
---
So sad
---
Yes it's camping, no it's not a bad thing because fuck else are you gonna do.
---
The killer mains are the oppressed, all we ask for is another top tier killer other than nurse and billy.
---
Citation required
---
Too be honest I don't know what to do with Leatherface to be a buff other than to improve his movement speed and probably throw his chainsaw like in the movies. Would be pretty cool if it happened.....
---
You can say same about Plague. People think that her Red Vomit is op, but they can circle her around walls and she won't be able to hit you.
---
&gt;so I just stand there and wait for them to die
---
That's the definition of camping, so yes.
---
I would be fine with ranking by time played too :)
---
Tbh I wish they had an unranked mode where people could play more casually and just earn bloodpoints. 
---
How can they fairly rank people who have access to such a varied amount of perks/items etc. 
---
Surely it would be better to be able to play unranked to earn enough bloodpoints to make the build you want to take into ranked. 
---
It would also mean the people playing ranked are actually playing for rank rather than bloodpoints and casual fun. 
---
Makes even more sense to me with them adding ranked rewards soon as it answers the argument of people wouldn’t play ranked if there was a casual mode. 
---
What do you think?
---
I mean, personally I'd be looking for a generator to kick or a pallet to break for points, or see if I can find the hatch and close it for points. At the very least I'd move far enough away from the hooks that they can't hear my heartbeat and they can die in peace. But is it camping? If every living person is on a hook in the basement I'd say no (but the game will consider that it is if you're too close, so move away so you don't lose any... I think its chaser emblem).
---
Myers with no scratched, vanity mirror or his Mori add-ons. The thrill of Myers is running away from somebody who can snap at any moment, sometimes you can’t avoid him but when you can is it satisfying. You gotta be on your toes, if you are you can make his T3 basically useless. With the mirrors, Myers doesn’t feel like a Myers to play against and his Mori add-ons, while cool, are super dumb.     
---
Billy without charge add-ons is a close second for me
---
Bunny Feng pls
---
When you're wife tells you to go get the Groceries but instead you were playing ghostface.
---
Can you buy them with Shards? Or do we spend €10 :/
---
Peanuts, a developer, said on the forums that's not the way it's supposed to work and that it's a bug, I have hope for Ghostface!
---
Actually she stops singing while in a chase,to stop survivors from pinpointing her
---
when i saw the mori yesterday, i was thinking that i swore it was a phone
---
Unfortunately I think there wre a lot of survivors who do enjoy beating a trash killer. They just meme around forever, heck I think that's one of the main reasons that endgame exists now
---
I play on PS4 and on average play 2-3 hours every day. 100% worth it but keep in mind this game is all about the grind. And there is a double bloodpoint weekend coming up pretty soon.
---
You're still talking rumors. Sources or it's just nonsense.
---
Man, I am all about Claudette's new do. Her hair looks way better.
---
I wish she had different steppy noises. By default she's bare foot so you get that sort of pitter patter noise of bare feet on the ground even if you have one of her skins were she has shoes on. Mildly annoying.
---
Myers.
---
I'M REALLY MAD AT THE FACT THAT MANY PLAYERS WANT GHOSTFACE TO GET BUFFED, YET AMANDA IT'S THE WAY SHE IS IN HER TERRIBLE STATE. THEY REWORKED FREDDY, BUFFED SPIRIT, WRAITH, HAG, BALANCED LEGION AND IT SEEMS THAT AMANDA IT'S STILL NON-EXISTENT
---
Wait, Ben 10? What do you mean?
---
Thx
---
Robert Scott Bean
---
I think both sides do it. I only really say something when someone face camps me, and even then it’s more passive aggressive than anything.
---
I play both sides very equally, and this is what i have to say: Each side creates a mindset.
---
For survivors it creates a “survivor mindset” in some things. A survivor mindset makes you think you should survive, and that feels a given.
---
For killers it creates a “killer mindset” in some things. A killer mindset is on the basis that you should get kills, and that feels a given. 
---
The problem is: nothing is given. You don’t DESERVE the ability to take an extra hit from MoM. You don’t DESERVE to down survives with one hit from NOED. When people think they DESERVE these perks, they don’t. And the opposing side will always say what the other side thinks is deserved is ridiculous. We are polarized from our want to win.
---
Toxicity only comes from our hate of what the other side is. Some of it is natural, you see basic toxicity in other communities, but the extra toxicity is the difference in mindset. The survivors will be toxic if they think the killer shouldn’t have something like NOED and the killers will be toxic if they think the survivors shouldn’t have something like balanced landing. The problem is, when you main a side, it is very difficult to be in someone else’s shoes.
---
I can't tell if me staring at him cross map all get with ooo and open handed denies his power or if other survivors are just easily denying him. I only know that you can wall hack him with ooo if he is chasing you crouched around a pallet.
---
I like that idea, I just see a lot of people exploiting that by just farming with killers. Maybe if they gave everyone a cap as to how many bloodpoints you can earn a match?
---
You don’t have taste in horror, and don’t belong on this sub, this game, or this planet.
---
Ok
---
Unrelated, but do you know if quick and quiet triggers I'm all ears? It is a rushed action... technically.
---
I'd have to say, I have played for a very long time, and ranked up to the more advanced stuff.  I've faced tough survivors, but I've never lost a single round since I learned everything.  I have faced every survivor they have ever released, at least a hundred times.  No one has ever beat my tactics, not even once.  I've had a few ties, as I put my phone down to get the pizza at the door, but no one has ever beat my iron-clad camping / tunnelling mundane strategy.  It's a shame, really.
---
I don't remember if I said that's why I like or play the game, but this sure-win strategy is actually why I quit.  It was no challenge, so I started watching \*REAL\* DBD players, on stream.  There was SO much more tactics involved.
---
Also, speaking to the Chinese researchers made me realize that there's no way that I should have ever played this game-- it gave way too much attention to a rip-off that tried to pay a real game dev for their silence.
---
He can tbag
---
He can enter stealth, making him have 0 TR and no red stain if he's crouched at the same time. While stealthed he can stalk, which works identical to Myers, but it's one person at a time, they each have their own bar of stalk (like sickness from the plague). If you stalk someone for 4 seconds, they become exposed for 20. However if you aren't stalking, their stalk depletes very fast, so you basically have to get it all at once.
---
Oh yeah, if any survivor at all (even dying/hooked) looks at you for 1 second, your TR comes back, as does the stain, and you can't stealth or stalk for the entire cooldown. 
---
He's much worse than Myers, tremendously worse. You can't save your stalk and suddenly pop it like Myers. You can't stalk in a chase, you can't stalk from far away.
---
He also makes a loud noise when stalking, it's directional. Like last night he was stalking me but I heard it so I just looked around until I saw him, then the stalk he did on me becomes completely worthless.
---
**Frenzy:**
---
* When activated, allows you to run faster, vault over pallets and jump through windows. 
---
* If you hit a survivor while activated, will trigger deep wound status. What this means is that they have a timer that only activates and runs when they are **outside your terror radius**. They have to mend the would before they heal. If you hit a survivor that already has the deep wound status, then it will end your power. 
---
* If you hit a survivor and trigger the deep wound status, the heartbeats of other survivors within a certain distance will pop up, allowing you to see them through walls. Each hit that triggers the deep wound status will also reset the timer of frenzy.
---
That... would still be really bad either way.
---
wow even the controller kit is low poly! /s
---
They shit on killers, its fucking clear to everyone with a functioning brain, they dont bring out anything remotly good, because freaking claudette toxic mindless p3 REEEEEEEEEEEEE at reddit and twitter 24/7 !
---
Plague: survivors can u cleanse I want to use my powers
---
Survivors: no, I don't think I will
---
I'm not trying to be a sarcastic cunt, here, but I'm honestly not familiar with the English side of the I.V. community.  That said, what do people consider "toxic survivor" behavior to be?  I'm asking as an honest, educational inquiry.
---
Legion is actually pretty effective at getting points. He is main farming killer for that reason.
---
I was wrong with everything :D Oh my God, they are to hot to resist...
---
They seem like good devs with a great game at its core, so I hope they'll pull through.
---
The real problem is that the devs are afraid to anger either side. They dont want to make another billy or nurse, but they also dont want to make super strong perks for survivors. Bhvr is more afraid of outcrys from either side. Tbh i want another nurse tier killer and i eant another old school DS. I want both sides to have a challenge.
---
Thnx
---
Wait... They out today?
---
Feng’s hair looks great! I liked it before but it’s even better now
---
And when they jump through a window they pull out a torch, shine it in the Killer's face, then make rude gestures and call them mean names.
---
Even the entity pities Carl to where it had to end his suffering.
---
Neizt thank you i will try to keep my hype low when they introduce new killers.
---
That's why it's on a PTB.
---
Ah i see. I don’t Farm tbh. I had one dude try to farm once but he was playing Doc.
---
Myers tier 3 lasts longer, he has longer lunge and vaults faster. It destroys Pig's ambush but her ambish is crap anyway. You can use it on some loops tho and then Meg doesn't have Sprint Burst. With Wraith you bai the SB. And tbh Wraith and Pig are bad. But Pig can at least trap you.
---
He can t-bag and is the only killer who's power doesnt work.
---
Age old saying: If you try to please everyone, no one will like you.
---
Thing is you heal yourself run back unhook, and if they tunnel the same person, then you take a hit again, insta-heal and then take another hit. And if you need to then you use mettle if man. But that entire time the killer has been trying to knock down that one survivor who is body blocking the downed should wiggle of and that wastes more time for the other two survivors to be doing gens (hopefully)
---
The Trapper for me, He can counter loops via beat traps but the player can see this and run further away which breaks the loop, He can leave his traps around the map but they can be easily spotted and disabled.
---
Epic
---
Not that it matters, but The Stalker is a lady.
---
Except Myers already does that and it's not a problem?
---
Plag: "I've poisoned you and you haven't cleansed yourself, you're now broken and can't heal"
---
Me, a No Mither David: "k"
---
Mad grit counters mettle now, just realised that
---
My bike be straight piped so i dont know about this one.
---
That thing didn had a froncam, he did a selfie for no dam reason ! that pycho !
---
Simpson’s Myers Meme
---
Or there's the ever popular scream 4 which is weirdly self aware and there's like Twitter in it I think. Movies are weird. (I am an old man)
---
I main hag on ps4 and notice a lot of people who play her actually do this. It's incredibly frustrating especially when they put like 5 traps at the hook and don't even leave. Like, why did you even bother if you were just going to camp??
---
I always put one trap down and leave to just go put more traps at loops and gens. Luckily all the bad hags are in low ranks so usually I see less of them after rank reset when I'm back in purple-red ranks.
---
Wat
---
True,you just have to enter from the correct side to make them drop the pallet ASAP
---
Aw man
---
I try to be a good sport butif you are toxic i will go full sb adren meg with a toolbox and fuck you up.
---
Oh oof my b
---
How about survivors just start the game on hooks?
---
*Killers*: omg still op 
---
The game is never going to be balanced, one side is always going to be stronger.
---
I'm gonna go be killer main until I get better at looping the air 😭 killers easy
---
Tbh I'm surprised there aren't separate subreddits for killers and survivors at this point
---
True, this is so OP
---
Idk how, I was trying to get it to tier 3 put the turned around a corner and that happened
---
I'd think we also need to **not allow or make it harder for Survivors on the hook to deplete Ghost's power.** Killer's almost useless (no M2) with someone on the hook for like 1/4 of the map.
---
Either "I don't give a fuck" or "You're opinion is wrong and you should feel bad"
---
They should just make him immune to any position revealing perk while he is crushing. Just like tier 1 Myers
---
yeah? what stops you from looking around and then leave a gen for a second to stare or point at the killer?
---
A bunch of these should be able to rectified with a simple value change, not sure how long the survivor camera related issues would take though.
---
I haven't seen that happen once. Maybe though!
---
What I said wasn't that she was weak lmao I was saying she isn't fun too play against she is fun too play.
---
My point wasn't whether the killers are fun too play but whether they are fun too play against.
---
No.
---
Leatherface already gets punished too hard for missing his hard to hit chainsaw.
---
He doesn't need any nerfs, he needs some buffs.
---
Probably worst killer in the game right now.
---
Anyone else noticed that in the screenshot on top his power is evil within instead?
---
He's bugged right now. Takes .3 to stop the stalk when it's suppose to take 3 seconds and he isn't suppose to be broken out of it unless you can see his body so he can still peek at you(from what i've heard)
---
Again, that was just a publicity stunt.  They didn't actually "help" make the game.  They were paid to make that video, long after the Chinese had already made a 1-for-1 copy of the game.
---
The devs are the problem, they freaking pander to only one side, guess what ? Thos who complain about loosing there power and demanding more, even tho they have enough !
---
Yes it is, but it comes as strategy. Camping can be used well to weaken survivors. However, it can also bite you in the ass if I'll timed.
---
If you feel this removal was in error, or if you have further questions, [feel free to contact the mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight&amp;message=[does anyone religiously play every killer with shadowborn because the default FOV is so bad like me?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bx4ojw/does_anyone_religiously_play_every_killer_with/))
---
I have.Especially in streamers/videos.Obly nagedbto play him onceband got 3 dcs so...
---
*But they*
---
Also
---
&gt;not promised to be fixed when released
---
&gt;good news!
---
Yeah, that’s a no from me dog
---
You also should be able to have some sort of skill in a chase that allows you to defend yourself (for a time) against a killer and chases should be able to be optimized for both sides. Balancing the game around looping pallets and the occasional window (although some safe windows are boring) is the best way to add this to a cat and mouse chase game.
---
Stealth is fucking boring and some killers just want survivors to run in a straight line for an easy down every game.
---
Ghostface's theme is dark comedy, not this lol. Seems more like Scary Movie or Scream 3
---
I know lol. It's annoying when it happens though with the .3 sec but the whole camera thing is idk why they added that feature to be ghostfaces weakness regardless.
---
 [https://twitter.com/watchdogsgame/status/1136057718471516160](https://twitter.com/watchdogsgame/status/1136057718471516160)  Ubisoft announced Watch Dogs Legion, and the first thing to go through my mind, is give the legion mask to the main character of Watch Dogs, is a very bad joke
---
I heard about the meta thing. There are people that I heard arguing if Scream was to be considered a proper horror movie or a parody. And now I discovered why.
---
Thanks for answering, fam!
---
Myers still gets looped in tier 3 though. Longer lunge or not. Pig's Ambush does have uses outside of a chase. But yes i aghree wraith is bad
---
On PC, Killer queues do take longer. That guy is probably on console.
---
No, not actually.  We're just informing blind sheep who would believe publicity stunts.  We're letting you know that the truth really is out there, but it's up to you to open your eyes and look for it.
---
It’s chill, like I said it doesn’t matter much at all.

---
Legion &gt;:)
---
WHEN?
---
LET'S MAKE A PETITION RIGHT NOW THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
---
This doesn't make sense.
---
If we're being strict, it's camping..  but, if you have no other survivors to go after, it's perfectly fine. What else are you supposed to do?
---
Sure, but people still stayed in the game more often than with Freddy.
---
What's more challenging than a map without windows and pallets? Apparently 50% action speed debuff.
---
Not accurate his power should have immediately shut off the second they turned around
---
When you make a game and have 2 completely different sides that each other’s goal is to beat the other side, unfortunately there will be conflict
---
AMANDA DOESNT LOSE STEALTH WHEN SHES LOOKED AT, CAN USE HER STEALTH AT WILL, HAS A DASH THAT CAN BE USED FOR MINDGAMES, AND THE RBT HELPS SLOW THE GAME DOWN (JUST A LITTLE BIT)! GHOSTFACE IS LIKE MYERS IF HE LOST TIER 3 WHEN YOU LOOKED AT HIM AND HAD A NORMAL TERROR RADIUS
---
Eh. It really is. No good killer will let you cleanse totems like that. Plus some maps are absolute hell to find totems at, like lerys. A whole end game should not revolve around a single perk. The perk also takes no skill to use AT ALL. It has no conditions from killer to activate, except punish the survivors for doing their job good. 
---
Countless times terrible killers get 2-3 kills just cuz of noed.
---
Thanks! And yeah I think it ends on the 21st!
---
WHAT A START TO YEAR 3 GHOSTFACE, AN ICONIC KILLER SUCKS. THE DEVELOPERS SHOULD PUT JUST AS MUCH EFFORT INTO HIM AND EVERY KILLER AS THEY ARE DOING WITH FREDDY.
---
GHOSTFACE IS WORSE THAN FREDDY AND IF HE DOESNT GET SOME SERRIOUS BUFFS I WILL NOT BUY HIM
---
It's more that survivors just don't play killer and have no idea about their struggles. They made up stupid rules so they have easier time escaping and bitch like little children if you don't follow them. And I'm saying all that as mostly survivor main. 
---
The most frustrating thing is that survivors don't understand that playing killer makes you a lot better survivor, when you know exactly what killer knows. Like i catch a lot of survivors just sprinting next to a wall. You leaving the most obvious scratch marks ever genius. Killer can see them from across the map. A lot even don't know how basic perks works, like nurses calling. I with a hag and monitor and abuse pretty much feed of survivors who just brakes the chase and starts healing immediately. Also you pretty much know  huntress will have nurses and stop healing immediately if you hear her singing. I get you don't know I have nurses first time, but second and third? The only perk they know is BBQ, and oh boi do they know it good. Some people spend good 30 seconds in lockers after someone gets hooked. Knowing weaknesses of killer perk is winning half the battle. Like if you see wraith with enduring, drop those pallets early, or get smacked with spirit fury.
---
His intended state is still going to be weak.
---
It's only been out for a year
---
I can explain it to you. It's not easy, so be careful when reading!  
---
Okay, so first of all, when you're doing a gen... Look around, like with every fcking killer and he can't use his power.   
---
I still can't believe they made him so trash.
---
I completely agree. It and other info perks should work the same way as BBQ. 
---
If it was changed to no CD I would be very scared of a good Nurse’s running it with Infectious Fright.
---
All I'm saying is, I was really into Naruto and got the Sharingan tatted on my arm when I was 19. I'm now 32 and not really into Naruto anymore.
---
The three real stealth killers vs the false hope
---
Fair enough - I've just played in my share of games against him where we're almost done 3 gens by time his Tier 3 procs, and I feel kind of bad. Good Shape players can definitely catch up if the circumstances are right.
---
I've also been in games with him where people play aggressively against him in the first couple minutes and all of a sudden there are a bunch of slugs on the ground, so make of that what you will. :)
---
Its a fun game to play. Queue times aren't terrible depending on the time of day you play. Just be ready to get beat a lot for a while
---
Wanna hear a secret? *It probably didnt happen during internal testing*
---
Bully is pretty much as high a high tier killer can get without being OP imo. He has the increased chase potentional, map pressure almost on par with the Nurse, but he's not completely uncountable, at least at base. Instasaw and engravings feel garbage to go against, but at base a lot of high tier Billy chases feel fair and exciting.
---
Yeah, and there are no good examples either.. or a horror character as a good guy killing only bad people.. it's almost like having a Jason but who only kills bad people as he has a deep rooted hatred for.. people who get away with doing bad things to innocent people.. with the moral code of not killing innocent people..
---
I have got 2 stalks out of prob 15...2 days of playing...its sad
---
This.
---
Psst. Then they didn't test very well, did they?
---
That's not what he is saying at all. He is saying you must have the camera pointed towards him longer, not the actual player model.
---
It's almost like 80% of players need to be kept happy over the 20%....
---
GHOST FACE SUCKS WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS THINKING. HIS POWER IS USELESS SURVIVORS CAN JUST MOVE THEIR CAMERA ANYWHERE AND THEY'LL SPOT HIM. CHANGE UT WHERE THE DIRECTION OF THE CHARACTERS FACE SHOULD SEE HIM NOT THE CAMERA. DEVS LOST THEIR MOJO WHAT A FUCKING JOKE THIS IS THE THIRD KILLER NOW THAT IS UNDERWHELMING.
---
Yeah was just curious.
---
This perk is bad. Explain to me, how is it good...
---
Thank you
---
I don’t mind it, but the effect should definitely be toned down to just be a red blur on the borders of your screen instead.
---
I think that's what they're planning, unless I understood the devstream wrong
---
It's a bug you fuck, EVERY game has them. Are you ganna say they didnt test well too?
---
SHE RELIES WAY TOO MUCH ON RNG, SHE CAN'T MINDGAME WITH HER DASH AT STRONG LOOPS + HER BREATHING IS SO FREAKIN' LOUD YOU CAN HEAR HER ACROSS THE MAP. I NEVER SAID GF DOESN'T NEED BUFFS BUT AMANDA DOES DESERVE THE SAME ATTENTION
---
It's not a matter of not knowing the strategy against her, it's just a matter of being stealthy isn't that fun for me. And please don't take this as I feel like she needs a nerf. She's fine the way she is, I just don't have fun against her and nor do I need to.
---
Who the fuck is ghost face
---
Majority of the time.
---
Like across all works in the same vein as people see Goku and Superman? Wtf?
---
"I'm not 4king every single game with the new killer,  this is survivor's fault somehow"
---
every map is smaller than 200m.
---
Thanks,  I could barely beat the tutorial lol.  I'm thinking I'm going to really suck.
---
Been done 1,000,000 times with myers. Dead meme at tgis point.
---
SWF ON PS4 IS AS EASY AS OPENING THE COMMUNITIES APP, CLICKING ON NOW PLAYING AND JOINING ANY RANDOM GROUP. BAM, INSTANT EDGE OVER THE KILLER.
---
I must not have caught that. Very excited for it if that's the case.
---
By farming, I mean just playing for bloodpoints, not for fun. I'll playing legion like any normal game, but he just gets a lot of BP with bbq and you don't even have to do well.
---
I HONESTLY THINK SHES MID TIER AND DOESNT NEED AS MUCH ATTENTION AS KILLERS LIKE GF, LF, AMD MAYBE EVEN TRAPPER, BUT I FEEL YOU MAN
---
Don’t forget one of aces cosmetics (black suit jacket with a red undershirt) got changed
---
It’s grey now and the shirt is kinda pink looking now.
---
Even though it is still called “black” by the game
---
Still ignoring all the changes that have happened in the past year I see. And you expect people to take you seriously lol.
---
Honestly, I feel like having a 1st person POV for survivor would be cool when playing against Ghostface.
---
Peanits is just a mod and not a dev right?
---
Hope their faces changed too, and it’s not just bcz of the Low settings. Feng looks much prettier.
---
He has literal wipe potential with a single attack. Buffing instadown killers is a terrible idea. Considering he doesn't always get knocked out of it colliding with objects. Hes shitty but a buff to his chainsaw isnt the answer, not unless you want insta- dcs if they do buff that. Bc a lot of survivors just d/c against killers they dont want to play against
---
Keep crying. That's all you're good at.
---
Yes that's a great idea! Or maybe and built in adrenaline and a borrowed timed because it's clearly not enough. On top of that you should be able to run 4 other perks and have an item. You know what fuck that, they should just give the killers a pink dildo to chase people with it (obviously doing no damage) and watch you do generators until it's time to queue again.
---
This is the game I want to play.
---
it would literally take 1 game of internal testing to catch this....
---
This is so accurate in so many levels.
---
Then yeah you are completely fine especially when it’s 3 gens strat with whispers. 
---
Survivors either A. Are mad and don’t understand your side of the story 
---
Or B. Don’t care to understand and are mad. 
---
Usually when I play survivor and this happens I blame my team lol
---
I dont enjoy it but I'm newish and dont have perks that help me defend/find others when I get good perks for trapper I stopped proxying entirely but I was playing as a lvl 15 huntress with whispers 1,sloppy butcher1,iron grasp1,and unrelenting.
---
I liked Pig before the RBT nerf. Playing against her now feels a lot easier
---
I have been looking everwear for these, thank you! They look so pretty overall
---
well right now it's just because of how the system works. Once the SWF team connects to the killer host, as far as the game is concerned, they are solo players. This is also why SWF teams can't stay together after a match.
---
This will change with dedicated servers though!
---
You need the 1-shot capability to be an oppressive killer, or a sprint/teleportation. Whispers won't do it.
---
Don't hurt those poor Dwights bubbafue
---
I usually tell them its just a game and to move on
---
Retail workers embrace the entity with open arms  praying for death tbh
---
True. I do feel like the devs are balancing their killers based off the opinion of survivors and making it easy for them since they make up  majority of the player base.
---
What was the nerf, I'm rather new.
---
I understand you're new, what I'm getting at is in this scenario where the survivor was able to unhook himself it would be camping. But you couldn't have known that, which is why I said I don't fault you. Regardless of the scenario though you shouldn't need to stay near a hook and watch, learn your abilities as a killer. Not the character powers but your capabilities. I tend to make a point of not pursuing survivors that get unhooked because I can gauge whether or not I can actually get the kill. And yes there are salty s.o.b's on this game that will find anything to snarl at you for, you can avoid being called a camper by full yeeting away from hooks no matter what.
---
Ok, keep on complaining about NOED. Maybe someday the devs will listen. In the meantime, I'll be cleansing totems and having little trouble ever dealing with NOED, as it's meant to be countered.
---
Lol free kills, that's funny.
---
ITS NOT CAMPING IF THE HAG TRAPS A HOOK AND YOU TRIP IT EVERY TIME.  THATS HOW HER GOD DAMN POWER IS SUPPOSSED TO WORK
---
It was on the stream. One of subscribers is known dev tester or something. Well, Atleast streamer trust him. He said thet they fucked up and dropped broken Ghostface version.
---
RBT’s are inactivated until a generator is completed while the trap is on their head
---
Its pretty natural, I think as people put more hours in and play both sides you chill out a bit. When I first started playing I only played killer for the first 200 hours or so. I never even touched a game of survivor and I hot caught up in the toxicity a little, but then you make friends in the community and get to 1500 hours or more and realise that it's just a game, relax a bit.
---
CLOWN IS SO FUCKING OVERPOWERED WITH THAT DUMBASS “SLOW YOU DOWN TO A FUCKING CRAWL” POTION
---
I FEEL LIKE I CAN NEVER COMPLAIN ABOUT KILLERS BECAUSE PEOPLE ON THIS SUB WILL DOWNVOTE ME TO OBLIVION SO I JUST BOTTLE IT UP INSIDE AND I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE I COULD CRY SOMETIMES.
---
I say like 5 seconds would be alright seeing as that’s how long he has to stalk you.
---
Slug Myers is so fun to play as
---
Alright I don't care anymore, be as negative as you want I'm done
---
Spirit is a top tier killer. She’s second best or third best depending on how you feel. 
---
Flashlights still good but more hard. 
---
The rest of the new killers seem to be okay but good enough if you’re skilled. 
---
Ghostface is a really bad killer though so kind of hoped up on him. 
---
New Freddy rework might be good we’ll see. 
---
And I think that’s about it
---
I've run it on spirit, quite nice when combined with Bbq, but even with a fast phase walk, I still don't get to the gen fast enough sometimes. This should help write a bit.
---
Though making it a token perk would be infinitely better.
---
I play both, and yeah this is pretty much the case
---
I will keep complaining and I will keep doing totems. And yes I do hope one day they will listen. All the perk needs is a condition based on the killer. NOT the survivor. BBQ is a fantastic perk, but not OP because the killer needs to hook. Simple. But still a condition. 
---
What about if you are the one getting chased like the whole game? And your teammates just rushed gens, and boom, all 5 gens are doom. Boom noed activated, because you had no chance of finding totems? It is very unfair.
---
I literally dread playing against both of them. Huntress, Billy and Nurse are the most annoying killers to play against.
---
They did Claudette dirty with that new weave. It used to be so voluminous, now it’s a rag. The head with that hair in purple was my fav too, rip
---
Well hopefully they buff him so camping isn’t the only option. I doubt they would release a killer who’s only option to get kills is to camp 🧐
---
Wait... really? This is insanely stupid if true...
---
All these Dead By Daylight tattoos inspire me to get my own one day. All of them look super cool!
---
a person with priorities, lul
---
Oh Mettle of Man is good but getting nerfed so I don’t know how good it will be. 
---
It’s about same meta it’s always been. Sc takes way too long it’s better ditching it and getting better at the game. 
---
Jeff has Aftercare which is nice and I use it. 
---
BT is different but in a better way. 
---
That’s about all I can think of right now.
---
Shhh, don't go against the bandwagon. Wait three days for the survivor-centric post and then say that there. Killers are having fun believing this game isn't completely tailored towards them having it easy.
---
Staring directly at GF with the survivor and not just the camera (small angle of effect, not really direct) for a few seconds should break him out of stealth.  While being stared at and for a few seconds after being stared at, GF cannot leave stealth and as such, cannot attack.
---
I wanna cry bro. I've requested ghostface for 2 and a half years and he gets leaked and I'm so happy but then BHVR releases the details and power and its a complete dickslap in the face. He's weak as shit, not actually ghostface, and has no horror references at all.
---
Do it. And don't listen to the trolls/naysayers/morons who say it's "cringy", or you'll "regret" it.
---
...You want MORE of them? Jesus christ, I know this subreddit is full of killer mains but thats how you destroy the game. Most survivors dread playing against Billy and Nurse, and you want MORE killers like them? This game would be dead in a month.
---
"Hey someone's cleaning my ruin!"
---
    -dream transition-
---
"Alright, you're so dead in a bout 7 seconds"
---
"I'm going to pull you off this totem so hard..."
---
    -thunder noises-
---
I wanna main him so bad but until he gets fixed and isn't torture to play I'll just continue to play pig lol
---
With instasaw and an aggressive playstyle of spirit fury + enduring he is actually not bad at all. A lot of people see him as weak because 90% of tum tum players use him for a few rounds then give up so they never learn how to properly use him. Now of course he is still lacking in map pressure just like most low-mid tier killers but he is definitely just as strong as wraith or clown.
---
God forbid the killer have to actually make smart use of their tools instead of click M2 and get downs lmao.
---
So he won’t be fixed by release but they are “fixing” him.  Welp Ghostface getting buffed to be as good as legion confirmed.
---
In that situation I'd be annoyed my teammates didn't get the totems. 
---
You aren't entitled to freedom just because the gens are done. If the killer downs you with NOED then he earned that hook. Survivors have a flat out method of turning NOED off before it ever hurts anyone, if they fail to then there's potential consequences. NOED is fine as it is. When it wasn't a totem perk then it was OP.
---
New killer, and fairly famous from the scream franchise
---
Oh I didn't know it was different before.
---
They should just have a tuba follow all stealth killers around and call it a day.
---
Cringe means second hand embarrassment. You feel embarrassed to look at some head turns by wraith?
---
So you admit that there is a problem with loops, because there are some loops that are going to be nearly endless and they're not worth wasting your time on?
---
Also fuck no I'm not going to waste my time on a survivor I'm not going to catch. I'm out here on the streets preaching this fucking wisdom. DON'T CHASE SURVIVORS YOU'RE NOT GONNA CATCH. I don't care if you're getting t bagged, flashlighted, hated on, or if that person is the best player on their team. Don't waste your time. 
---
Find the weakest link, take him down first, they're going to easier because you know why. BECAUSE THEY MAKE MORE MISTAKES.
---
I'm calling out your bullshit that you're a killer main, because for one, playing killer has a faaaar shorter queue time than survivor, unless you're in the ptb. For all my time I've played DBD, I've always found games faster when I played killer, it's the sole reason I became a killer main. Faster games.
---
Objectively playing killer IS more stressful, ask any person with more than 5iq and who doesn't play killer for 1-4 games and then goes back to survivor. When you play survivor most of the time you are working on a gen, or you're hooked. And if you like getting chased, it's not because of the thrills because let's face it DbD is not a scary game. It's because you have control over the situation and love the action and have the smarts to loop. You have your map knowledge, your skills, and you know your available resources, so you're straight chilling.
---
As killer you're chasing someone and you have to be focused on everything. You have to constantly be looking out for any fuck ups they might do, you are constantly worried about how many gens have been completed, how every survivor still has x amount of time on hook.
---
Survivors put hella pressure on the killer from the beginning of the game. It's up to the killer to exploit your mistakes, getting spotted, creating scratch marks, missing a skill check, over using their resources, lack of map knowledge.
---
You want to win as a survivor, learn your loops, learn every map to its smallest detail, the best survivors see a map and already know what pallets and windows they have available to them, and which ones are the most important ones to keep alive. Looking at you god pallet. You keep your mistakes to a minimum and the killer will have an extremely hard time catching you
---
I feel so relieved when people use the god pallets, like that was a mistake and now your whole team is going to pay the price for your mistake.
---
Hard to believe that two core set survivor perks, no teachables and generally considered meh, REALLY messes him up ESPECIALLY spine chill.
---
Totes will someday. I've always wanted to get tattoos and piercings because they're totally bad ass. I hope I won't have to deal with the naysayers though. But who knows, or cares. I just want to look totally awesome :3
---
Thank you !
---
But your mom is beautiful!
---
It happened to me lol
---
Not everyone cares about the BP. Also if it's a bad game like nurse slugging everyone what are you gonna double your 3k BP?
---
No problem :3
---
Doesn't do jack. Not on Xbox either.
---
Welcome to playing as survivor. While a good team of survivors is very hard to beat, most teammates sandbag or hide the entire game or you get camped which destroys gameplay.
---
As someone who loves Freddy in his current state, what was nerfed?
---
Yes its a reportable offense griefing and teaming with the killer. If you have footage along with the report it would be even better.
---
Ive seen a wierd sense of entitlement from both sides that is rare to see in other games. People being as nasty as possible for using perks or killers they dont like, or playing a way they dont like, its rediculous. 
---
I understand not liking noed or MoM, or that a looping survivor/tunneling killer can be maddening but that doesnt mean you get to ridicule and screech at the other player because they are playing in a way you dont like. Its a versus game, if your playing for wins (which many are for ranks) anything that isn't a flat out exploit goes. 
---
Its like playing overwatch as mercy then screaming about people "tunneling" you when you get your ass targeted first, they arent doing it to BM you they are just playing the best way there is to play.
---
He doesn't want to admit he ate nine cans of ravioli
---
Before, the traps would be active instantly. If you tried to escape out the exit gate with a trap on your head, you would die instantly. Escapes from the trap door were the only way to avoid taking the trap off. 
---
It gave her a lot more ability to keep survivors off gens and it made her a pretty solid end-game killer.
---
I would absolutely love this like for real.
---
This sounds far more reasonable, hopefully they will give a quick bug fix for this.
---

If you feel this removal was in error, or if you have further questions, [feel free to contact the mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight&amp;message=[Ghostface needs a complete rework, even after the bug fixes happen he will always just mostly be an M1 killer, besides his lackluster stalk, which can give you a chance to M1 survivors down in one less hit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bx58l9/ghostface_needs_a_complete_rework_even_after_the/))
---
Well I mean Legions rework was for the greater good. But Ghostface is extremely bad. Cool power yes but does it work no even if it’s not bugged I still think he’s weak. 
---
Change the 20 seconds to 30 or 40 seconds then yeah I think he may be better. But it’s more then that.
---
Also I disagree with the whole releasing him at a bad state is bad. No it’s not because this is the ptb the devs try to make a killer viable but not op and then they give it to people to test so they can tweak around to make it better. They don’t want to run into another Freddy situation because if you take a look at past Characters it takes them awhile to fix a character. 
---
Also legion was pretty bad in the ptb and got tweaked sure he became this broken unfun killer to play against but that’s what the ptb is for.
---
So they can tweak and release it to the public officially. It does make the Dlc seem very lack luster and not much people will buy it. But if they want people to buy it they will be buffing him soon because that’s there goal. 
---
Idk about plague but Spirit and Clown aren’t bad. Legion I have no clue I think he’s okay and requires more skill to use.
---
I have footage but the in game report didn’t ask for it
---
Why didnt internal testing catch this? Also downed or hooked players shouldnt be able to spot and they should have to look at your face...not be able to stare at your ass and wipe your power.
---
They look worse 😂
---
I've seen so many ppl on this sub saying "Hurr, killers think the game should be survs running in a straight line, hurr." But I've yet to see a killer say anything even close to those lines. Stop demonizing killer ideology, regardless of what side your shitty opinion is coming from.
---
I mean technically yes. You outplayed the killer and did YOUR JOB as a survivor. And the survivor are seriously getting punished by completing their objectives, how nice. 
---
So the killer deserves the kill just because he had the perk on? If that is the case then they shouldnt have reworked DS. Since if I had DS on i deserved the escape no matter what. 
---
What you are not understanding is that we dont know when the killer has noed. If the killer doesnt have it, survivor wasted their whole time cleansing totems giving the killer a lot more time to get hooks. Now if they do have it, you still have to find all 5, then hope that your other survivors are on the same page, which rarely happens. Again, the perk rewards killers just because survivors did their job. No other perk does that. Very unfair.
---
His powers were nerfed to the ground where if he puts someone in the Dream state it would not him slow him down, also Perks like adreninline wouldn't wake them also picking up the survivors in the dream state doesn't make them wake them up. Those things are the major nerfs.
---
If the trap is active I believe it still kills you at gate but after the fifth gen unused rbts are useless
---
He's the new killer
---
Look for gameplay on YouTube
---
Just wait this is exactly what the ptb is for. I expect everyone to be looking into what to change at the studios because what they want is a product to sell to there fans. If they make a product not worth selling then it was a waste.
---
You are correct
---
not to mention her vomit is incredibly buggy. I stopped playing her the 4th time the blood vomit went right through someone and did no damage
---
i tested this with a friend and yeah a slow 360 can deactivate his power, but slow enough to where if he started stalking you right after you looked in his direction, you'd be exposed before you got back to him.
---
However, it really does just need to be insanely lucky timing from him, and also most generators only require the survivor to look like 2-3 directions
---
In what universe do they have map pressure? It’s like a trapper with no traps? He’s just an m1 killer, the whole mend ability does nothing for the legion. He gets looped like a bitch now. He has the most useless power in the game
---
Hmm entity, I’m trying to sneak around, but I’m dummy thick and my chunkyness keeps getting the survivors to look at me
---
Also downed and hooked survivors can cancel his power 
---
I wish whispers didnt light up from downed or hooked survivors either.  That makes the perk so bad.
---
Hi Monto
---
Honestly just increase his movement speed in general. He could use his chainsaw more often and get to gens quicker
---
TOPICAL HUNOUR MA DUDE!
---
Nope every game has toxic assholes
---
Never thought I hear the sentence “just as strong as wraith”
---
i think they should go somewhat in the way deathgarden has the hunter (aka the killer) is actually gets my blood pumping and is scary when you encounter them in dbd its the opposite you can troll the killer and get away with it and never really feel in danger
---
Shush potato
---
finally you can be stealthy and *not* get fucked by noed at the very end and die on first hook
---
It really is just a scream OC, huh?
---
Would that allow him to get exposed everytime unless the person was already looking?
---
the whole point of the game is for them to be oppressed. they're literally playing as helpless beings in the realm of an invincible torture god.
---
and you know what? if they dont quit playing the game when they get slaughtered by Hillbilly and Nurse, they aren't going to quit against another killer as good as those two. so BHVR needs to just pull the trigger on a top tier killer, let them squeal for a week or two, then watch as they go back to normal.
---
You make it sound like it was this widespread phenomenon, when you're describing like, 2 Reddit posts and Steam reviews from people with -100 hours in the game. They complained loud, but widespread? That's ridiculous. BHVR responded to a handful of loud complainers (as they often do, because again, they cater to the *new* player base in general, new Survivors and new Killers) and somehow that got interpreted as the entire Survivor base collectively lobbying against Freddy, which it straight up didn't. Anyone above rank 12 saw Freddy as Doctor tier, which he was at release.
---
It's this exaggerated nonsense that perpetuates the "rivalry" between Killers and Survivors. Fucking childish.
---
Damn these tips are so useful
---
Well for one any given beta test tends to be several days long at a minimum, while this could've been caught in a 10 minute alpha test. It actually takes more time and resources to not do an alpha test.
---
My idea is that if you want to break him out of his stealth you have to click a key - when you click the key he gets a notification as to where you are, kinda like what happens when you fast vault or fail a skill check. Then it becomes a game of are you gonna sacrifice yourself for your friend or save yourself
---
I had a complete brain fart when typing that I meant like 2.5 seconds so it’s half the time
---
they hated jesus because he told them the truth
---
Well yeah if you make mistakes as killer that is a huge oops and they're going to exploit the fuck out of it, and the survivors are going to laugh and point at your sorry ass for fucking up.
---
Ex fucking actly
---
You're looking for mistakes the survivors make, if you see they're not going to make any, you stop and go and find someone else.
---
Take out the weakes link first because they make more MISTAKES than a good survivor.
---
It's as Truetalent has said (not quote but similar along the lines of), The truth is you can do everything right as the killer and do your absolute best. But the survivors don't make mistakes, none of that will matter.
---
I wonder if they’re allowed to change the hair of licensed characters aswell. My girl Laurie needs a better cut asap cause it looks like it’s made out of hay.
---
Cause your killer main friends are bad at the game, lol.
---
If we don't complain about how broken and bad the killer is, they WONT change anything. Because if they don't see that people are unhappy they will go "oh this is fine" and not change anything
---
New killer. He's the villain from Scream.
---
These are not what we paid for.
---
Why do new survivor's have to ruin everything? Why can't people just learn and stop being potatoes, it's not fair that the devs are more concerned with the potatoes that will only play about 3-6 matches then never play again
---
I mean this is what would happen to begin withbif those two ever got face to face hahhaha
---
Maybe because you posted it on reddit a place where you are suppose to discuss things. Anyways it’s still in the game so whatever buddy
---

---
Major improvements everywhere.
---
If they ever make a DBD movie, I hope this is how it ends. Just the entity resetting the survivors in his game so many times they learn they can bully the shit out of the killer and the entity eventually gets bored and they survive
---
He is part of the Behavior team so he might tell them. He posts alot on the fourms.
---
His power still sucks rn either way so...
---
I kinda think Billy is OP. All top tier killers have some sort of drawback that keeps them in check (Nurse’s fatigue/very slow movement speed, Huntress’ 110%/reload, Spirit’s inability to see survivors in Phase/110%, etc.) except for Billy. He’s incredibly simple to play yet he’s the strongest killer in the game that follows the usual sense of gameplay.
---
Releasing a broken killer you admit to being unable to fix before release though...
---
Low poly is like when a game renders incorrectly and doesn’t show all the details. Another example is when a game doesn’t use a large number of sides to an object such as Super Mario 64(pretty sure that’s the 3d one that was on the ds)
---
Ayy, spaghetti sauce!
---
Menacing != overpowered. Meyers is menacing but not overpowered. Huntress is menacing, but not overpowered. Ghostface is a meme. His power is completely useless right now. He's about as threatening as a trapless trappper. Yes he can kill but he's just an M1 killer who can crouch.
---
Yeah, I kinda agree here because everything can be changed. If a killer really is too OP, they can be patched down.
---
Can't wait for Ms. Fowl to be the next killer!
---
Only a bad hag player puts more than one trap at a hook
---
I was underneath the impression the plague got here after praying to the entity to keep her from dying
---
I just want other killers to be fun to play as and bring something interesting to the table while being functional. We don’t need Nurse 2.0, lord knows people are still crying for Nurse Nerfs, but I just want to have a killer who is fun and allows me to do something beyond the typical “get fucked at long loops and run the M1 Special build every game”
---
Posting a comment without giving any kind of source to your claims though...
---
Ds got nerfed
---
AND I WILL OINK ON ALRIGHT?
---
That line was refering to endgame collapse with the killer closing the hatch and 1 survivor having to open the gate.
---
In that situation you'll get as good of a result with just whispers, they'll never open a door if you have it.
---
Why in the actual fuck do you think his shitty power justifies 110 movement speed
---
Different tastes.
---
Yet the Nurse remains extremely OP whilst Billy is only *arguably* OP.
---
It’s in testing. The T of PTB.
---
Even if the sevond thing mages to come in its enough to make him much better
---
The point I was making was that the game could have the exact same type of gameplay elements, with slight changes to aesthetics, to completely alter their esrb ratings.
---
You don't have to agree with me, but don't pretend thats not a valid reason to believe a system is flawed
---
Legion would rather get nerfed than to have Ghostface near them-
---
I think a nice buff would be if his chainsaw was silent when it's off. Why do we even have to charge it if it's idling the whole time? I hate when people are sneaking around me and I can't hear them because my chainsaw is running constantly
---
You CAN 4k with a powerless killer, it's true, doesn't make the killer not shit though
---
What if they made it so that whenever a hooked survivor looks at it doubles the speed of their death? Of course it will also increase Ghostface's BP. Same goes with a survivor in a dying state. And maybe add a spooked debuff that would blind survivors who looks at him while he is stalking.
---
To be fair, there's a difference between body camping and teleporting to the trap when someone activates it at hook. I've noticed at lower ranks (between 12-14) they always claim I'm camping when I'm not. I just tele'd back or you couldn't wait 3 seconds till I was gone to go for the unhook.
---
It does feel like killers are getting made worse and worse in the name of "balance". But you know. Nurse and hillbilly are untouched. They should just make killers with powers first. And think about balance after ptb. If they just ingnored the thought process of "how can survivors counterplay ghostface" he'd actually just be a good killer.
---
No i said buff the power. To make him more viable. Im trying to reach a compromise.
---
Nah it doesn't do anything. I reported a killer who had good ping in the lobby then all of a sudden during the match he's teleporting, we're going down when we're not even in his range, stuff like that and I don't think anything ever came of it or at least I didn't get a follow up
---
I agree that people are overreacting (like always) but I guess it is better to voice your complaints than be silent and allow them to release a killer without tweaking.
---
With this being said, people that say nothing but "*this killer is trash*" "*bhvr shouldn't released this*" and such, aren't doing any good. If you are going to complain, at least point out the flaws you found so they can acknowledge it and work on it.
---
well i dont see how this passed internal testing...and is it face to face looking? or can the survivor face their model to his ass and wipe his power?
---
3 seconds to 0.3 seconds lmao, this reminds me of the Haddonfield intro bug, they fudged the number's with that too
---
Hex: No One Cares When You Put “Hex:” In Front Of Your Statements
---
Your not really thinking this through , the hood would clip through most headwear
---
It doesn’t work against any other stuns besides pallets now. So DS and Head On have their full effects now, which are simple enough to counter. 
---
Overall it is a buff and the perk works in a very specific sense now which is overall a positive game health change. You may see more Head On and DS now that people can use their full effect.
---
Lmfao best one yet IMO.
---
Even Wraith, Trapper, Plague, Doctor, Freddy can still down normally. Legion is the same except he gets that 1st hit better than any of the other killers mentioned. 
---
Not to mention I think people are still getting use to him. I think every one you see under rank 10 who does bad was a guy who relied too much on Franks+Stab Wounds, and since the change they don't know how to do shit. People who didn't play scummy didn't down with FF were using Purple Blade+Cold dirt, hit you once, catch up to you, cancel FF, and just hit you normally. Those people do really well with Legion now. There is a skill gap knowing when to use frenzy and when not too as well.
---
MORE LEMON PLEDGE?
---
Plauge definitely had potential
---
We don't need to do anything
---
Who said it's only killers saying this?
---
If the killer has the perk on and the survivors don't break the dulls then yea the killer earns the down/hook/kill if the killer hits someone with NOED active.
---
Survivor perks will always need to function differently since this is an asymmetrical game. I don't see much point at all in comparing NOED with DS unless you're just looking for a full on salty killer mains vs survivor mains kind of argument.
---
I mostly play survivor, imo NOED is fair.
---
Alright bud. Later, have a good day man.
---
Is that even bannable? It seems so ambiguous what teaming is that I doubt they'd get banned.
---
Have they said they can't fix GhostFace?
---
Implying that anybody at BHVR that isn't Not_Queen has an ounce of awareness.
---
I DC whenever I see someone cleanse and wait for the end-game chat to tell them how stupid they are.
---
Just the camera from what I’ve seen.
---
Yea the thematic was cool, a disease spreading killer. But somewhere along the line they decided "hey, you know what's cool? A killer that relies on survivors and has to constantly run to strange areas of the map"
---
Hey! When they get that sweet, sweet battlepass revenue, then they'll be able to hire some playtesters, OK?
---
I HEARD THRU THE GRAPE VINE THAT JAMIE LEE CURTIS WOULDN’T SIGN OFF ON THEM USING HER LIKENESS FOR STRODE, SO WE GOT WHAT WE GOT AND I DONT THINK BHVR CARES AND WONT CHNAGE ANYTHING, HELL WE CANT GET THE SOUNDS CORRECTED.
---
#FREEBUNNYFENG
---
Yeah except like I Said, the survivor doesn’t even have to visually see the killer but only be looking in their direction. It’s even worse on cornfield maps cause they can still see right through the field when you can’t. Legit go watch Monto’s latest video and tell me he’s anywhere near playable, the fact the he says “I just want to use his power”  dozens of times over a good amount of games and never gets to is ridiculous.
---
You can make a ticket with the footage
---
Not quite. We mentioned that *Night Shroud* wouldn't decrease movement speed, not crouching. They're two completely different things.
---
Community manager, so somewhere in between. That's the feedback we've been seeing from the community and brought to the team, basically.
---
Everything is. No matter how you look at it, whether good or bad in one person's eyes, to another person or group it's toxic.
---
Walk past a hooked survivor? Toxic. Dropped a pallet on a killer? Toxic. Unhooked a teammate? Double toxic. Genuinely complement someone? Toxic. Play as Killer? Toxic. Main a survivor? Toxic. Play the game? You reek of toxicity.
---
NOED doesn't need a nerf. All you have to do is cleanse totems. thats it. There is nothing else you need to do to completely destroy that perk. And now you get lightbringer points for breaking dull totems, so you actually have a reason to do it.
---
And why does Dying Light need to be nerfed? It requires the killer to actually not only find the obessession but also kill them before the majority of gens are done to have any effect. Most of the time Dying Light only affects the last 1-2 gens
---
Why not just play it out if you're going to wait anyways?
---
JAMIE LEE CURTIS IS SUSPECT FOR THIS
---
Which is what you do?????? Lmao??? That works??
---
"burn this mother down"  haha
---
Reality is often disappointing.
---
So walking side by side with the killer with killer not even attempting to attack the survivor isn’t bannable? Leading the killer to other survivors and farming them by hooking and rescuing repeatedly isn’t bannable? Blocking a fellow survivor intentionally mid chase to ensure the killer catches us isn’t bannable? He was teabagging us whilst doing all of this so yeah I’d say if anyone actually reviewed it, it would be bannable...
---
Spirit isn't good?
---
You make it sound like it's bad to cleanse yourself at the first opportunity?
---
People should also stop pointing fingers at certain sides of the player base for the devs' mistakes (like the current top post on this sub for example)
---
Can you do that on console? The footage is saved to my PS4
---
Its not that serious, sis.
---
To be fair, the Entity made that for him. and the hand make-up is just constructed from a past memory where he happened to be wearing *a* sweater during a christmas dinner. At least I think the devs confirmed that the Entity knit all those sweaters, my memory is imperfect.
---
So you always escape when you are playing against him?
---
I already watch’ed Noob3’s video, CLEARLY it’s bugged. This is what PTB is for, no sense in everyone losing their shit when it will all clearly be changed/fixed. Everyone likes to bitch at survivors for complaining about bugs, but the MOMENT someone criticizes those complaining about new killers in PTB you all lose your shit. 
---
Take your own advice. “Trust the Devs.”
---
The only one I understand is adrenaline. Not sure what you mean about "not him slow him down" and the thing about picking up survivors.
---
Legion wasn't intended to moonwalk but that didn't matter. We can only judge by current state.
---
No there are plenty of survivors that love these no skill perks
---
Yeah, but EVERY killer is worse than Freddy
---
He aint even out fully and he already needs to be changed
---
Medium, get over yourself !
---
I can understand that. I think survivors have to adjust their strategies depending on the killer. You can’t play against every killer the same way.
---
It’s useless really. Unless you’re up against a blind/deaf killer like the above.
---
I'd say your buff idea is a good one as long as he can only down one person at a time. Hell be way too strong if its powered up any further
---
When you use you're powers you know the moment where you slow down for a sec when you put him to asleep. That wasn't a thing. There were other nerfs but I barely remember it anymore at this point.
---
I think immunity to detection perks on crouch like T1 Myers is would be pretty nifty but if the survivor can see you then they should be able to spot you by staring at you, no matter what.
---
I didn't know his grandma's name was entity
---
Oh ok. I can see her not being fun to play against since she’s brutal if the player is good.
---
Now I can truly not counter this perk
---
You mean my complaint that a weak perk got nerfed? Good job just giving up on your argument, you can just admit I’m right now
---
The &gt; The Ghost
---
Why give him a name if he has no power?
---
Does anyone know if this was actually intentional or not? The hair was the first thing I noticed when starting up the PTB. Second thing was that head turning animations on survivors are very messed up in game. It looks like something is wrong with the hair physics maybe? A lot of the hair just kinda drooped or "fell out" of it's style. Part of me wondered if they accidentally messed up the hair when coding the way ghostface's robe strand things move around.
---
About OoO. They did the same with Plague. No mither completely negates her power. No mither is a handicap, yes, but it also makes her power completely pointless. This shouldn't be a thing, devs, please.
---
I mean Legion IS Ghostface. Even the mori is HEAVILY inspired by Drew Barrymore being gutted in the first scream. The weapon. The chase powers, attacking and leaving. Multiple people picking up the mantle. We've had Ghostface this whole time. I think making the costume they licensed a costume would be dope.
---
Only bad killers camp - all killers. All platforms. A good player will always be dangerous and not worry about getting that one kill bc spreading damage is more important and sustainable to them. That said I hate playing against the trapper and nurse simply bc I don't find this game fun as survivor anymore unless I'm being chased.
---
It was. Now it's a griefing simulator that wants to be an eSport.
---
listen? that sounds risky :S
---
I thought his updated ability allowed him to sprint further in one go, making him able to get across most maps?
---
I mean, the movies are actually pretty bad though. The first one is the only one that sort of scrapes by with a pass, but the others are hot garbage. They are mostly cringe-inducing celebrity reference humor, and feel like they were written by 12 year olds from the early 2000's
---
BHVR said that they don't want to make strong killers anymore like Nurse or Billy, so they practically make weak killers purposely. And that's true, after Huntress release, we had : Cannibal ( meme killer ), Freddy ( meme killer again ), Pig ( she was decent and she still is, but she received a nerf she didn't deserve ), Clown ( killer with a very basic and most of the time ineficient power ), Spirit ( she's a exception ), Legion ( before broken killer, now a killer with a very basic power ), Plague ( power reliant on survivors ) and now Ghostface ( another meme killer ).
---
Lmao trust the devs when freddy has been dookie for how long again? People have a right to be upset of a new killer that everyone has been looking forward to and especially one that is classic slasher when they come to the testing phase and already worse than all the other killers. Literally The Shape, The Wraith, and The Pig all have stealth abilities that don’t have anything happen to them when they use their ability from a survivor that could emote a point and render that killer useless.
---
Honestly, I think literally everyone who has had a single experience with Ghostface would agree that they would be a million times better without the detection aspect.
---
It’s very similar to The Sims 4 if you’ve played that.
---
&gt;spending money on battlepass in any game let alone one with absolutely no tournament potential
---
I mean, was outlast really scary after 6 hours?
---
Was Halloween a scary movie the 8th time?
---
Things get less scary over time, and this game is pretty repetitive. Its still a horror game, but it just becomes more pop focused at some point.
---
Lol pretty accurate
---
If you're not gonna put up a feedback sticky, you can't really complain about people posting multiple feedback threads.  Just sayin'.
---
That said, it seems like they've got most of the major issues on their radar.  No word about making Ghostface's perks more useful/interesting though I see, assuming that'll come later.
---
Remember when people thought that 4 seconds of stalking for 20 seconds of exposed was OP?
---
Still better than “The Ghost Face”
---
true
---
How will it be easier to find survivors with a larger TR? Is this something to do with his detection thing?
---
As awful as Lery's and The Game are, that sounds awful. No thanks.
---
It can but if you want to report for something like working with killer you need to not only report in the after game report but save the recording then send it to the devs. It is a massive pain in the ass to do but supposedly it will do something and I have had devs email me back for a similar report.   
---
I think if your friend is so easily put off games though DBD is not for them. Their are a lot of toxic things people can do in game that aren't reportable and their are a lot of people who do the things you can report because they don't care. It's like Marmite either you love the buggy toxic mes this game can be or you don't lol.
---
Would appreciate any opinions on the editing as well. 
---
:)
---
Whoa dude that’s so a very clever argument 
---
Except when you reread what I said and realize I’m expressing confusion on why a weak perk gets nerfed
---
Can u upload the template aswell? It looks so awesome, I want to use it across all my perks and powers
---
Except Ash did it
---
remember that ratings are advisories not requirements. Many people don't know the difference.
---
At least Plague's power isn't denied by survivors looking directly at her, so she's at least ... something.
---
I was like...I'm not sure that math checks out.
---
I don't understand the down vote, but okay.
---
IMO It really isn’t strong enough to be considered if you take away its detection abilities. I asked because I’ve been running it none stop the past few weeks and found it to be a waste of a perk unless I’m against a stealth killer. Against a normal terror radius killer you get a second of extra time to hide or make a move that you don’t really need because you hear their heartbeat anyway. Against a stealth killer it takes away that element of surprise. You’re still likely to be in a chase, but it’s not a guaranteed first hit anymore.
---
the Frenzy allows for you to chain between the survivors rather easily and then follow up on 1 with a down. Getting from point A to B, then C and D rather quickly all while injuring the survivors in the process. Sure they can choose to not heal to make the impact of the power less potent, but at that point you just simply down them.
---
I don't know where down the line of, "you need to be 115ms to effectively chase a survivor in an efficient matter." turned into "lol 115ms is trash in chases and you get looped infinitely."
---
The power also shines when survivors are cluttered together, for example when going for saves or working on a gen together, stealth won't work since frenzy will give you away.
---
Not to mention frenzy is easy Remember Me and STBFL stacks. I would also argue Enduring +Spirit Fury is amazing on Legion if you force a pallet stun on yourself while chasing an injured person in frenzy, you will get the pallet stun not the power stun, meaning you can easily and instantly follow up with the 2nd hit after effortlessly getting the first hit.
---
The biggest downside is that messing up is TOO damaging, a missed attack stuns and drains your power. the stun duration is rather long, killer instinct doesn't actually seem to match your TR anymore, and the actual DW health state isn't TOO deadly either. If the penalties with frenzy were softened up in some aspects, they could be really solid otherwise they are meh at best and probably around low mid tier, but definitely not at the bottom.
---
Legion's power fundamentally works similar to Plague where it is virtually worthless if survivors choose to forego healing so they both become standard M1 killers who can just 1-hit all of you, though Plague's power is a bit more potent otherwise making her several notches better at base I would say.
---
Bonus points in that they counter a few meta perks with DW as well but people like to ignore that.
---
He is cute. And David is hot.   
---
I want those skins now.
---
I like they build but I ended up removing quick and quiet. I felt like it wasn’t helpful in chases. Lithe and Dance With Me are enough when the killer is on my tail. I can still lose them and have 2 other slots for other helpful perks for non-chase situation.
---
This would be the right thing to do. Obviously Ghost face is not ready. Which means I'm also not "ready" to hand them over my money.
---
-flashbacks to release 115 nurse-
---
I honestly dont know anything about that
---
If these changes go live then I wanna be able to refund cosmetics I bought with auric cells.
---
I mean if you have ever watched the shit show that was Ochido, or any DBD streamers vods, or any video of DBD EVER, you will see it's not both sides. It's the survivors. All the freaking toxicity (outside of the once in a blue moon speedhacking killer) is entirely the survivors. The survivors have the inordinate amount of power in the game to oppress the killer. The survivors talk shit in the chat regardless if the killer was obnoxious or not. The survivors are the only ones besides a single speedhacking Leatherface that use exploits and lagswitches. I play both sides- actually I play more survivor than killer because playing killer means a 35% chance every single game I have to deal with one of the above issues, if not multiple. Its not all survivor players, but the way that survivors can literally just choose based on map offering / perk choice / sfw que to annihilate killers has fostered this culture of bullying the killer out of game along with inside of it. There's no real argument here, it is simply the state the game is in, and has always been in.
---
Well, first off he probably just said it to get a reaction or, he actually believes he's that good. 
---
For the victory it depends if you're trying to rank up look at the piping system. Down pip is a lost safety pip is a draw, up pip is a win and, Double pip is a massive victory but, in a game by game basis you would be correct. However if you have fun without intending of ruining the experience of other through exploits, ect. I would say you won in general.
---
Though my view may be skewed as a survivor main.
---
Thrilling tremors isn't even good. This DLC isn't worth any money.
---
Too bad pop goes the weasel sucks, it's not meta, the only people who use it don't know that it only regresses 25 percent of the generators CURRENT progression, it doesn't regress the equivalent of 25 percent of a completed gen, the perk is literally a placebo effect and people only run it because they misunderstand what it does.
---
I would rather a killer fucking function on release.
---
So legion finally got their power remaked. Good for them.
---
I can see the Tapp in Rhino, but I think David makes sense in body.
---
50/50 imo.
---
The system is perfectly fine, what's flawed is people's understanding of it. The rating system does not mean "people under the age of X **must not** play this game". What the ratings mean is that " *it may not be appropriate for* people under the age of X to play this game, parents are advised to *exercise discretion* ".
---
The idea behind ratings isn't to prohibit content, but to give the people buying it a better idea of what is being bought. Especially for parents who want to know what sort of game/movie/etc they're kid is watching without having to go do a bunch of research. They can just glance at the rating and have a general idea of what's involved.
---
I don't want to sound like a douche or want to lie but...This is true.
---
I completely agree I play both sides frequently and I feel pipping is a win and getting 3/4 is basically its 2 wins
---
PTB =/= release
---
Should we delay the update to make sure the killer works and can be somewhat viable?
---
"No, I don't think we will."
---
Yesterday i went against a swf group all with flashlights with pink addons... Guess who had lightborn... Well... They all dc'd on last hook... Good to know they'd rather get any points instead of loosing their precious addons
---
okay, and y tho?
---
In my experience most from the Killer side are much more chill. Although they are bummed by BHVR refusing to make good killers anyway.
---
Reporting on console used to not do anything, but console now has a fully functional banning system
---
Yeah that's why I'm not too happy with the idea of increasing her ms.
---
LOL granny Entity is serving up pudding, cake and sweaters this holiday season.
---
Entity is like "Want to play a game?"
---
because when you hit someone in Frenzy, you can see where the other survivors are while they're in your TR, so that's why it's great having a bigger TR on Legion
---
It's because they balance the game based on "fun." 🤦
---
BBQ&amp;C
---
Despite his powers current state, this just feels so good lol
---
1.) This shit has been posted dozens of times, you’re not creative
---
2.) There is a known bug which is making GhostFace weak, it is not intended
---
3.) This is a test server, not the live patch, this isn’t the finalized product and it is meant to balance new content and won’t be perfect
---
They havent made any annoments yet so saying they wont dealy it is a lie. They might. Maybe they want to see how much they can fix before his release.
---
They havent really changed killer perks much.
---
... said which killers?  Cause man that makes the game so dull when a survivor doesn't give me the ol dodge, there's no fun in hunting prey that doesn't run \ (•◡•) /
---
It’s a horror-themed action strategy game
---
That i have no idea.
---
Right, but if they go to the opposite exit portal (?) I have to get to them before they enter, but even then Ive run into just literal troll groups that just hide in bushes all round "UsE tHe DrOnEs ThOuGh", yeah let me waste the tin amount of time I have setting all of them up. I meant that cloak ability is so fucking annoying, there's a reason ever scavenger ive faced have been overwhelmingly him.
---
The counter is to not cleanse yourself giving plague her ability.

---
Hallowed Blight was great, it made playing killer actually fun
---
Then fuck off and don't read it.
---
Ah thanks
---
Outside of the original 3, some of the newer killers are really  powerful and fun.
---
That was funny.
---
It depends on the perspective on the survivor entirely. I am not defending killers in regards because I am sure there are toxic Killer mains but out of proportion majority  is the survivors because they lose so much self control not knowing what exactly the killers intentions are. Pretty much kill the survivors.
---
There was also another instance where I just wanted to do my Legion daily to use my powers and leave everyone alive. That 1 person was bad mouthing so hard on stream because he thought I was a dumb animal so I camped him. Really it's just the community feels so split on these things where they just express their anger in this game.
---
The knee jerk, vitriolic posts saying the devs are trash etc are really counterproductive and make the DBD community look like a bunch of entitled, whiny bitches. Feedback is important but screeching at the devs with emotion-fueled rants helps no one.
---
I guess that's what happens when developers have to make new killers in order to increase revenue.
---
Did they ... Did they just not test his gameplay at all?
---
They finna hack your flashlight
---
I don't think so. Are you sure? Because i remember breaking 1 fully working piston, when generator was at 27-30%
---
Also the description:  After hooking a Survivor, the next [Generator](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Generator) 📷 you break is instantly regressed by **15**/**20**/**25** % of its total progression.
---
Jump scare Myers or Amanda's letter pig or Prayer beads Spirit are all pretty jump scary at times. Also depends what you class as horror and how sensitive you are to it. Not all horror films are scary, I don't find the Saw series scary more gory. This game can be gory or gruesome to some, I know I have seen someone cringe at the hooking process or some of the mori's.
---
Yeah I don't really understand this...they know it's broken, and they're going to release him broken and fix him later.  They have to be aware that that means reduced sales and bad reviews affecting the DLC, right?
---
Even if it the bug is fix he’s still going to be bad.
---
I like how his points went from negative -10 to being Positive 11 after he noticed the truth. Being that there are people that defend ghostface even I was, But after playing him for a few games, Oh my god I was so wrong in so many levels.
---
And where are the good killers? Rank 1.
---
Yes, this is indeed Dwight
---
Death is not an escape
---
Did they test him???? At all???????
---
Imagine a horror movie but the killer throws one victim on a meat hook and just stares at him while he lets his 3 other victims escape unharmed.
---
I agree it has potential, but TR doesn't work like that. 16 meter TR doesn't mean you hear the 32-meter TR at 16 meters, it mean you don't hear the 17 meter TR. The TR still sounds the same relative to the killer's distance if you hear it.
---
Yea they should balance it around competitiveness because we are all pros and most of the playerbase is casual as f :p
---
You must be new here. This is the same subreddit where people complained about hair not being fluffy enough.
---
me whenever I see a Jake in my lobby
---
SAME! LIKE I HATE IT BECAUSE I LOOP THE KILLER ALL GAME AND HE DOWNS ME ONCE AND I GET TO DEPOP BECAUSE BHVR THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO MATCH ME (RANK 4) WITH RANK 12 KILLERS AND RANK 16 SURVIVORS BUT THE KILLER DOESN'T DOWN ANYONE BUT ME SO NO BENEVOLENT AND NO GENS BECAUSE I LOOPED ALL GAME.
---
Spirit is way better than Billy. And that's probably the best designed killer in the whole game.   
---
1. Nurse(she is kinda boring tho)  
---
2.  Spirit  
---
3. Billy/Hag  
---
4. Huntress????  
---
.  
---
Hell: LF/Doctor  
---
Sad memes tier: ghostface
---
Plague is fun vs low ranks. The meta vs the plague is to never cleanse making her an m1 killer.
---
I haven't played against the plague yet, could you explain what you mean by ignoring her powers?
---
Doesn't her power make you puke/get revealed and cause broken?
---
How do you ignore that, if you don't mind me asking?
---
Why is this comment downvoted? It’s the most true statement I’ve seen on this thread.
---
I had a camera flip phone. Front facing cameras didn't exist until "smart" phones.
---
Still!! Those changes won't make him good.
---
To me personally the last 3 killers (GF included) are super lackluster. 
---
I didn't like how Legion plays even when people were crying that he's super strong and I don't like him now, Plague again plays like an M1 killer and 90% of the time people don't even bother healing or purge the ebola, the other 10% is someone who either tries to have fun or just doesn't know the ''meta'' and now Ghostface, who's  arguably the worst so far. They all just fall into the same old traps, ''we don't want him to be oppressive'' and it ends up being something that can be completely ignored or straight up not work with the game's formula (I am talking about stealth).
---
It's whatever really, I cannot be forced to pay for something that I don't like and will just move on like any sane person. Maybe the next chapter will be better?
---
Many people already have an unplayable game with P2P. I'm sorry but the growing pains of this are going to be worth it in the long run.
---
I see way more killer mains whining here and on the steam discussion forums
---
Yeah, this game is hugely anti-killer. If you do good you're made fun of for being try hard, or you get accused of toxic behavior. If you do bad you get "gg ez, git to
---
Lmao the Claudettes
---
Huh, I'll have to pay attention next time to check if there's a notable difference in sound when she throws it.  I suppose she might make the 'urgh/rhaa' sound when she does?  Is that when you duck?
---
LF absolutely does not need buffs, especially for the chainsaw which is already ridiculously fast and has a gigantic hitbox
---
I totally get that, just based on having fun and not caring about winning.
---
I picture Stewie Griffin following the Clown around
---
Because legion worked out so well.
---
So no stealth killers huh? Just make the game super one track and not have any variety? I’m not saying that Ghost Face is gonna be super great. The meta will probably always be dominated by killers with chase potential and map control like billy and nurse. I’m not looking for another high tier killer in ghostface. I’m looking for a killer that can be fun and interesting to play and add variety to the game. If killers that weren’t based around stealth didn’t belong in the game, killers like wraith or pig wouldn’t exist.
---
✌️😳
---
Huh. I didn't know I wanted it, but now I do.
---
I will sandbag a survivor who cleanses Haunted Ground when it's painfully obvious.
---
This isnt the only issue
---
He's "easy to play" but not all billys are equal, he has a higher skill gap than you think, there are a lot of things that you can do with billy that make him stronger than he already is but require skill.
---
Anyways don't blame the players blame bhvr for only letting a minority of killers be viable at high ranks
---
Literally I'm not even joking I was playing with some friends and I wanted to leave him in stealth so we could see how his power would work but I'd lightly breath and reveal him.
---
Yah that is, but what I'm saying is if a killer sees a survivor pointing to another and the killer kills them, whose fault is that?
---
Same
---
How do they think this is good for the long term health of the game? Playing killer shouldn't be get bullied simulator but it is as the killer is easy to abuse through loops and pallets.
---
Except not really, you are the one making the argument it was a publicity stunt, therefore you are the one that needs to prove it.
---
This made me laugh more than it should've.
---
The game is only scary when you are new, it has nothing to do with the killers being released or balance issues. In no time your feelings change from one of horror, to one of being competitive where you just see the killer as being a player on the other end that you want to beat. That takes away all fear.  I actually get pretty damn scared playing stuff like Outlast or RE, with this game I feel none of that whatsoever. For me it has everything to do with the killer being human controlled, it’s just a totally different mindset.

---
I'm not buying it since its just a killer and a shitty killer at that.
---
That's the case most of the time though, as long as you get one kill it isn't a total loss.
---
When shes pulling her hatchet back to throw she makes a grunt, a few of the killers make noises before they hit with certain attacks or when they dissapear and reappear. Theres no guarantee when she'll throw, but you'll know shes aiming!
---
That's a question of my own tbh
---
That just isnt true and its been specified before that that isnt true. I have no idea where you got that info. Its 25% of the gen’s total progression. Not what has been done so far on it.
---
Wait which is before and which is after, cuz in my head it always goes before-after but the ones on the right look worse quality?
---
I feel that way about nurse on console... I cant stand to play her since her base movement speed is so slow and there are *zero* addons to reduce her stun time, only increase it.
---
You won't pip though, and I would consider that "winning".
---
&gt; I barely got two survivors
---
As in "sacrificed 2"? Then you did very good. Devs balancing goal is 2 sacrifices on average, so with purple ranks in your lobby you succeeded.
---
...and rank 15 is pretty close to 17, so this will happen a lot.
---
Have you heard of our lord and savior crouch walking?
---
I've almost given up on all totem perks. I love devour but half the time I cant even reach the instant down phase
---
WELL IT'S ABOUT TIME THIS WAS POSTED. IT'S RAGE DAY AND I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NOON TO FUCKING RAGE.
---
I THINK I'VE REALISED THE REAL POINT OF THIS GAME. IT EXISTS SOLELY TO PUNISH NEW PLAYERS.
---
4 CLAUDETTES WITH TOOLBOXES GEN RUSH. THEIR POPPING SO FAST THERE ISN'T A CLEAR GOOD DIRECTION TO GO. T BAG WHEN THEY FORCE YOU TO THE GATE NOT EVEN FOR FUCKING CHASE POINTS. GET TO THE SCOREBOARD AT THE END ALL ULTRA RARE PERKS AND GOOD ITEMS AND THEY HAVE TO SHIT ON A KILLER WITH ONE PERK SLOT. I'M NOT OFFENDED PERSONALLY I JUST THINK THEIR FUCKIN MORONS. THAT'S THE KIND OF SHIT THAT WILL KEEP PEOPLE FROM EMBRACING THE GAME. IT'S LIKE THEY WANT IT TO DIE. 
---
WE SERIOUSLY NEED A WAY TO BLOCK THOSE CUNTS FROM JOINING OR AT LEAST A GOD DAMN WARNING IF WE COULD FLAG THEM PERSONALLY SO WE KNOW THERE IS AN ABUSIVE SELF RIGHTEOUS PIECE OF SHIT TOXIC PLAYER WE WOULD BE HAPPIER TO AVOID. BEING ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME SO EASILY MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL IF IT'S THE SAME ASSHOLE AS BEFORE OR IF THEY JUST CHANGED THE NUMBER ON THE END OF THEIR NAME FOR EXAMPLE. 
---
CAN'T JUST SAY GOOD GAME TO SOMEONE WITHOUT EVEN THE CHANCE TO GET DECENT PERKS THEY HAVE TO PUT SALTY BLEACH IN YOUR WOUNDS. I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE HOW THOSE DICKS ACT WHEN YOUR NOT ON A NEWER KILLER AND YOU 4K.
---
I'VE NEVER WISHED FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE BEEN ABUSED AS CHILDREN UNTIL PLAYING THIS GAME BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO TRY TO JUSTIFY SUCH BEHAVIOR. 
---
THEY SHOULDN'T ALLOW PRESTIGING ON THE PTB VERSION AND SHOULD GIVE EVERYONE A BALANCED STATIC INVENTORY. 2 SINGLE DIGIT REDS WHO'RE EQUIPPED AS YOU WOULD EXPECT WITH A PURPLE AND ONE NEWB LIKE ME ISN'T GOING TO BE FUN OR A DECENT WAY TO GET AN AT ALL ACCURATE IDEA OF HOW GHOSTY IS. PTB HAS MORE LIMITED PLAYER COUNT SURE BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING TO LEVEL IT OUT. 
---
A TEST SHOULD BE CONSISTENT TO SOME DEGREE. 
---
ANOTHER THING I'M TIRED OF IT'S THE GUYS THAT GO EZ AND GET GOOD TO A NEW KILLER WHEN I'M A SURVIVOR AS WELL. I'LL JUMP ON THEIR CASE FOR BEING DICKS BECAUSE SOMEONE SHOULD SHOW THE NEW PEOPLE WE AREN'T ALL JUST TOXIC ASSHOLES AND THAT WE CAN APPRECIATE THE TROUBLE THEIR HAVING. 
---
AGAIN I HOPE THEIR BRAIN DAMAGED FROM AN ABUSIVE CHILDHOOD OR THEY SHOULD BE ON THE HOOK.
---
DCing deletes the items and add ons as well. mew can be happy that they literally lost everything
---
Same ..... I was thinking the after’s were first.
---
You're making the assumption that "winning =fun" in this game, which is unfortunatly what some of the BHVR devs do as well.
---
If someone is completely outclassed and feels like they are out of their league and just being stomped into the ground all game long, that doesn't mean they suddenly had fun for the past 10 minutes because in the last 30 seconds some cocky players did something stupid to try and flaunt their superiority, or even worse, gave up pity kills.
---
People don't need to win to have fun, they just want the feeling of being matched with players of a similar skill level.
---
"Only other F tier killer"
---
*Cough* Leatherface *Cough*
---
I hope you get it soon. 
---
So few people play Jake (at least on PS4), ot took me **for*ever* to get Survivorface.
---
So civilised
---
yeee nah thats not how it works
---
Dwight and Jake. I will get you. Someday if anyone ever plays you.
---
In a relatively recent PTB a few months ago the devs buffed Thanatophobia to reach a max debuff of around 26%. 
---
This buff was shortlived as people playing Legion would utilise this perk to its full effect and pissed people off. This was during the time of pre-rework Legion so that combined with longer games because of Thanatophobia likely resulted in the Devs scaping the Thanatophobia buff.
---
A lot of people are starting to use Thanatophobia because of the meta change with self-care into Adrenaline instead meaning survivors are less likely to heal themselves after being injured. That combined with how Legion and the Plague are both killers based on maintaining survivors in the injured state has caused this perk to have some actual use. 
---
Despite the popularity of it increasing its still a horrible perk that barely impacts the game. The effect of using it is very much a placebo in my opinion. It adds 12.8 seconds to a gen for 16% at max stacks at tier 3.
---
Wouldn't the Wraith and the Spirit would already constitute that issue?
---
Yeh im just confused, cuz it seems to be after-before
---
For some of them, yes. But they're in minority.
---
Woosh?
---
Leatherbilly worst? I dont know if I agree with that. But at the same time, I dont know who would be worse.
---
You don't get revealed however it is a little easier to find you cause of the green vomit on you. Her true power is the red vomit and to obtain it is if you drink the water where the survivor cleaned themselves on. But if they dont clean themselves then you cant get the red vomit. The red vomit does actual damage it can down a survivor or multiple survivors if they are grouped up.
---
IM TIRED OF SPENDING MY ENTIRE LIFETIME TO FIND A LOBBY FOR SOMEONE TO DISCONNECT OR LOSE CONNECTION IN THE LOADING SCREEN. JUST LEMME PLAY A FUCKING THREE MAN GAME SO I CAN GET THE BP AND RANK UP
---
Not at all
---
Hooked survivors break his shroud. How can he even camp hooks lol
---
The idea is that by cleansing, she gets her ranged damage. I guess what you're supposed to do is not cleanse so you only have to deal with the exposed status instead of both.
---
I still think being perma-exposed is strong but killers apparently don't.
---
That's understandable.  Fact of the matter is, I can't really get my bookmarks to properly load, and I have nfi how to search for the Chinese words.  I can't help anyone who really wants to know, because the bookmark has disappeared into my black abyss.  I've already read it, so I cba to search.
---
Horror is already incredibly difficult to do in general anymore. People, especially gamers, are desensitized to that kind of thing. Not only will it barely affect most players at the beginning, but you'll become entirely desensitized to it as mew play. The entire game would need remade to strike fear in players again. The only things really scary are jumpscare builds and as mew said, spirit can be at times.
---
Exactly that. It makes absolutely no sense. just release oatch 2.9.9 without GF.
---
Yes, but if she uses her purge correctly, everyone will be a one hit down by the end of the match.
---
Memes were supposed to save us! You were my brother!
---
Even without the bug, his whole idea is just bad.
---
To be honest I prefer Nurse and Huntress to Billy's chainsaw at this point. I can dodge and play ring around the rosey with a Nurse unless like you said, they are a god. But with Billy, it is usually map and add-on dependent. Is the Billy going to just hump you with a revved chainsaw? Welp, unless you have a nearby window vault, you are going down. They have instasaw add-ons? You are going down.
---
At least with Nurse I still have to be hit twice. Same goes for Huntress really. I love having to dodge hatchets.
---
first and third perk are extremely op
---
It's only been a day. Spirit underwent tons of changes. And look at the monstrosity she is now.
---
Idk.  From what I can recall, I made it to the top and never lost.  It got boring as hell to have a 100% win rate.
---
I played, for a time, just because I was winning 100% of the time.  After a while, it became nothing.  DBD became my next source of entertainment because NetEase wasn't doing it right.
---
You k now that bugs can apper even after you fix them right?
---
&gt; You're making the assumption that "winning =fun" in this game
---
Not at all. From my first killer game until now I play to have fun chases and gain (a lot) of bloodpoints. My "win" is 4 bbq stacks and 25k+ BP.
---
As for being outclassed. Well, you can get that feeling at any rank. You just need to face way better opposition.
---
Clearer quality ones are the before.
---
So if he's not going to be fixed on release...why the fuck would I buy him?
---
GlenOck with the good ideas damn, now might as well give us some ideas about pig as well.
---
let's be honest, having all 4 survivors broken sounds cool, but it's almost exactly what Legion could easily do because most people don't heal when facing Legion (same with plague) as it's a waste in time. but you know why neither both legion or plague are top tier? because their ability can only be used when the survivors are fully heal, if you never cleanse yourself from the plague's puke she is  basically a M1 killer, where Legion at least can run and get closer to use M1 in you. if you ignore the plague's effect she will never be able to get his really dangerous power that is the blood puke, that thing is what makes her powerful, but getting it depends on the survivors themselves ~~(also i'm pretty sure the aura reveal while puking is a pink or purple addon)~~
---
Passive aggressive behavior 101, too. 95% of the time when I say something people don't like it's all downvotes without replies. People think you're opinion is wrong but lack the balls to logically refute you. 
---
That's not even scratching the surface. On this sub especially some people just go through and downvote any opinion or expression, regardless of whether or not it's actually worth a downvote. I remember once I got like -4 simply because I said I liked playing music from Halo while playing DBD. 
---
You know what the saddest part is? It's actually an accurate representation of this community at large. There's some good, but a whole lotta bad, too. It's frankly a little discouraging even if it's a fundamental problem with the game itself that's lead to such a massive rift in between this community's individual cultures.
---
*stalks to EW3*
---
"Iiiiiiit's **HIGH NOOOOON**."
---
Binding of Isaac effect
---
it's not even that their poorly hidden, it's that experienced survivors know the spawns
---
Gotta say as a new player to DBD2 I fucking hate the doctor regardless of where he is on the killer tier list he’s just fucking annoying
---
Mecha Hitler?
---
Nurse is suuuper rare to come up against on console - like maybe 1 in 300 games will be a nurse - but she is super fun to play against because she is HOT GARBAGE on console and it's basically us survivors cyber-bullying her the whole time.
---
It's a bug that's pretty easy to trigger which should have been noticed during testing. It's not like the survivor has to do some elaborate camera movement to get it to trigger, it's just looking in the killer's direction. So yes, I think I will say they didn't test well.
---
Add-ons reworked
---
Crouch speed increased
---
Traps can kill again at gates.
---
BOOM that is how you fix Pig.
---
It is not that hard to snowball with her power. It takes a tiny bit of setup compared to most other killers and her sickness can literally spread from survivor to survivor or map to survivor.
---
Everyone single one of them looks significantly worse and low quality. If these changes go through and I'm unable to refund my purchases I'm going to be really annoyed.
---
[Playing Ghostface like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdJg6Duzzf4)
---
When playing against the plague, i never cleanse myself. i won't give her the red vomit, whatever that's called (i don't own that dlc).
---
Cheers for clearing that up bud. in that case, i cant say im a fan tbh.
---
Gonna stalk till I can't no more.
---
Meta is exhaustion perk, mom, adrenaline, and DS/BT 
---
But tbh, running meta perks won’t make you good. Best thing you can do is focus on improving your game, such as hugging walls while looping, understanding how to loop, such as shack, jungle Jim’s, etc. 
---
Practice op:)
---
Fire, right?
---
We know that it burns things, right?
---
But it's not IN and OF ITSELF *burnt*, right?
---
Excellent ideas m8, hope she gets fixed soemtimes soon.
---
PIG IS FINE SHE JUST NEEDS ADDON REWORKS.
---
does being sick do anything other than offer you to cleanse yourself and make other survivors sick or nah
---
And they're autistic...?
---
That's not a word that is remotely acceptable to use as an insult. Screw you.
---
I mean...i like it. Lol
---
Ignore plague's power. pig runs out of traps eventually. just go ahead and take the trap off
---
Why not...hold off on releasing? Why release a broken product? What is this Arkham origins?
---
How many traps does pig get?
---
Alright, if I remember when I get a new computer I'll see if I csn figure it out.
---
Wtf is M1 I’m new in this game/sub and see this everywhere ?
---
LIKE HOW EVERY REPLY TO THIS THREAD IS ABOUT GHOSTFACE.
---
I JUST WANT TO PUT REGULAR SALT DOWN ABOUT THIS FUCKING IMMERSED-ASS NEA RUNNING METTLE OF MAN. SHE'D NEVER TANK HITS FOR ANYONE AND BECAUSE I'M A COOL DUDE I'D TAKE AGRO EVERY TIME. EVERYONE DIED AND NEA DIDN'T EVEN GET TO USE METTLE OF MAN BECAUSE SHE NEVER GOT HIT AND SPENT THE WHOLE GAME "DOING GENS, YOU?" INSTEAD OF BEING A FUCKING USEFUL PLAYER.
---
Hey I’ve been trying to find this movie! What’s the title?
---
Seriously, I am already sick of these memes when we know the Killer is bugged and on a test build.
---
Max is 16%, which is 12.8 seconds
---
This is a online game. True blance doesnt exist. People will be shitty players and they will get wiped up by a good killer and they scream nerf at the top of their lungs then vice versa a crappy killer will get defeated easily then they scream nerf decisive nerf MoM one extra hit makes me lose the game. The only way to achieve something that resembles balance is to make people with equal skill play against each other.
---
And I'm saying that mistakes are the ONLY way a killer is going to win
---
You tell me, how are you going to win loops if they don't make mistakes?
---
The truth is the only way to win loops when they don't make mistakes is to not engage
---
Truetalent said it himself, that you could do everything right as a killer, but if the survivors don't make any mistakes, none of that matters.
---
Yeah, the perks aren't very good, so the only people that'd want to buy him at this point are the fans
---
This is how they're going to make the switch port work lmao
---
Bwahahahahahahahahaha
---
BTW Maddie on Twitter made it, she's a kind soul please go on her Twitter and show her some love.
---
only works in KYF, left down corner. there's a button to switch between Spectator, Survivor and the Killer
---
Won't be fixed before he comes out?  
---
Then what the hell is the purpose of the PTB?  
---
How did all of these glaring issues slip past all of you in development and internal testing?  
---
Like what is even going on at BHVR?
---
(I know someone posted it already, but this is for the peeps who weren’t up at midnight when the original post was thrown up.)
---
They limited their ability to make good killers when they started making maps with no outs for survivors. If you want a killer to have a strong core design and a good kit, you need to give survivors more options against it.
---
I want a banshee so bad! Original killers are fun and creative, licensed killers are poo.
---
It looks good but it does look low poly to me.
---
I actually really like the new David cosmetic
---
It's.. honestly not that hard. Look, let's say you briefly manage to get the killer to lose line of sight, maybe he's breaking a pallet you stunned him with. He's still on you, but a bit behind. You have two options, go left, or go right. So you briefly sprint left, so the scratch marks lead that way, but instead you turn around and, without sprinting, go right instead. Does that sound like rocket science and something only the elite can pull off?
---
Yeah... You shouldn't cleanse against Plague tho.
---
That absolutely not happen lmao. Meme builds aren't meta.
---
No, wait DO... DO step into his traps
---
Fun fact- The actor who portrayed Leatherface in Texas Chainsaw Massacre actually had to slow down while chasing the lead actress during her chase sequences because he kept easily outrunning her.  it's built-in immersion from the first movie lol
---
I mean, it is a tactic to not cleanse when against a plague as you can still mind game and loop if broken but there isn't a lot you can do when she has corruption. Lets put it like this though, you cleansed for a pretty good reason. Most don't enjoy saving when they are broken, its way too risky most of the time.
---
Overall I'd say they were just salty they died and you tried your best to save them, do don't let them discourage you from cleansing in an attempt to make a safe save. Just try to cleanse far away so they have to run a good distance.
---
I love it too, it's just the hair quality that's bad
---
Well excuse me, I thought you meant that BHVR needs to create stronger Killers, because too strong ones can be nerfed later. From what I see the developers don't really play their game or just suck at predicting how different gameplay mechanics work out. So it's like a lottery.
---
Ash has head and torso as single cosmetoc slot.
---
Check out the endgame collapse
---
I approve this decision! *repeated oinks*
---
Nah I’ve been here for at least 8 months but I like the point out some of the dumber things ya’ll complain about
---
I know this is a joke but having a large tr can be a great counter to mom , having a map wide tr like doctor or Myers with the rabbit addon in chases means less safe unhooks
---
what are you talking about ? that was 2 days ago
---
I’ve been here for 8 months
---
Thanks for your input!
---
I have a couple different takes on this. First, it's always better to be in a healthy state than an injured one.
---
That said, personally I don't cleanse against the Plague unless I'm on death hook, I have to make a risky save, or we're far behind on gens. Sometimes I'll cleanse if everyone else is, because if she's always got her power, I don't want to go down in one shot. It should be noted that I play most games without healing unless I have to though.
---
(In Schwarzenegger voice) COOL OFF
---
Yo Imma get pop goes the weasel I am so happy.
---
I mean yeah, you right. Wetness is about adhesion of a liquid to another substance, which sadly does not include cohesion to itself.
---
Yes I am stoopid main
---
The bloodpoints you can gain are capped at 8000 in each emblem catagory, 32000 bp is a perfect game with bp offerings adding to that after the match. 
---
I might be misunderstanding you though?
---
Exactly! Some people don't get that being constructive and encouraging is the best way to criticize.
---
Imagine someone pulls down your pants from behind and they see the Crapper staring back at them from your right butt cheek.
---
I agree on the first part completely. Hovewer, I feel like he can be fixed if a lots of tweaks done. Imagine making it so:
---
1. 3 seconds instead of 1 of looking at him is needed to break his power
---
2. Hooked and downed survivors don't break it at all
---
3. He doesn't make sounds in stealth, at all
---
4. Exposed timer increases significantly
---
Now he's almost OP if only not for grass and corn. Easier access to stealth than Myers and Pig and easier access to instadowns too.
---
I believe sneaky boi can be fixed. But yeah he already needs some sort of rework.
---
It's not a flawed system. The problem is some kids are mature enough to handle violence and some arent. So they try to bar all the kids from playing m rated games because of the immature ones. It's not flawed because you are allowed to go buy your kid whatever games they want.
---
No I don't. To be honest I don't see anything good about this power yet and now he can't  mindgame survivors falling asleep. If he doesn't get anything that really helps him in a chase, he's gonna be trash again. So lets wait before making opinion on it.
---
I think they changed the long hair on Jake as well it looks different.
---
Mmm yes please more David skins
---
Nerfing Decisive Strike... Shittiest move ever...
---
&gt; but instead you turn around and, without sprinting, go right instead
---
that takes a huge load of time to perform. Running far enough to have the marks visibly indicating a direction then walking in the opposite direction looks like the perfect way to give a free hit to the killer.
---
I'm sure some of them are going to be fixed. plauge was
---
Plague got fixed on release, so did spirit. Legion was changed to.
---
Because they might be able to fix it?
---
You know you can just follow scratchmarks, right? This perk is garbage.
---
You know you can just follow scratchmarks?
---
Woah, thank you!
---
And agreed, the improvement is insane lmao
---
&gt; Heal against legion.
---
Why would you, he gets a guaranteed free hit unless your willing to waste a pallet which he can break.
---
He has nothing to catch up in the chase, all he has is that 115% speed which doesn't really stop you from pallet looping him if you have Dead Hard.
---
I think The Ghost is gonna have a good balance between killer and survivor. He’s gonna scare the shit out of me but not destroy me (if I play right)
---
He was right though...
---
Good killers don't do that, just insecure ones
---
i love this
---
Hell, it's tempting when I throw a streamer in and get tunneled immediately
---
It's the same reason you'd heal against any other 115 killer. mew wouldn't stay injured after stepping in one of trappers traps, would you?
---
Curious, why not heal? Isn’t it better to be able to take 2 hits rather than 1?
---
Yea, sure
---
You're an idiot.
---
....b- but you can teleport....
---
Oh yeah. A new player would be trying to learn the game, and here comes a counselor opening the door for his buddy Jason. It happened constantly, 1 out of 5 matches at least. Since I had a good group of friends to play with, no problem, we'd usually kill the traitor and then Jason himself. But I can only imagine how many new potential players this pushed away.  
---
And you're right, competition is great, it would encourage all of the companies to do better. But it is what it is.
---
&gt;(Since I couldn't find any good pictures of it anywhere)

His beard cosmetic will always be the best.
---
If everyone is on the same page (aka 4 man swf) u either all cleanse or don't cleanse so not a 4 man they're just salty
---
Np!
---
Yeahhh.. she continued to say should would have rather died on the hook. Lol. I tried, idk what else to say.
---
If you’re that averse to him, I’d suggest asking people to boycott the entire game all together, not just ghostface. That’d be the more likely option to get a response. 
---
Personally though, no I wouldn’t boycott anything at the moment. Things can change quite a bit before  Ghostface goes live.
---
I can't stand anyone who calls her traps hexes
---
Im gonna give the devs a chance to fix him after launch. I still find some use out of his perks so thats something.
---
I love it when survivors stay sick! Thanatophobia adds 10 seconds to gen repair when the whole team is sick, and Black Incense makes it so that I know where they are at all times. If I don't have Black Incense, I bring in Iridescent Seal for uncontrollable corrupt purges, or the Apples for a mid-game slugfest once I use a corrupted fountain (usually resulting in lots of salty-rage-quit DC's). I honestly have no problem with survivors using this "Tactic" for facing Plague.
---
when broken and throwing up you can still loop the plague. 
---
but once you cleanse you cant loop her anymore cause her puke is pretty much impossible to avoid so she will down the first survivor she sees much faster then she would if they were just broken and looping her,
---
she is at her most powerful when you cleanse so you should try to hold off on cleansing for as long as possible and if you do cleanse try to do it in a spot far away from any gens so she has to waste most of her corrupted purge time just getting to the nearest gen
---
Hes still ptb
---
Trapper can't run at me at with 125% speed, vault over pallets and windows at a similar speed as me though and land a very easy hit by using his power.
---
Thanks a lot for the explanation ! Like Trapper when people avoid or sabotage all your traps then :p
---
Even if his power works as intended im still not buying him. The perks are meh and I was never really a fan of scream anyway.
---
this is a shitpost, why is everyone taking this so seriously, damn
---
It’s still a great perk and is in a much healthier state. Def not a shitty move
---
That's the thing, I don't want to boycott the game, I love DbD, I want it to be a successful game.  And I do hope that they take the PTB info and tweak Ghostface into a decent killer because I will be the first person to buy him if he's at least decently good!
---
But I don't want them ignoring us, our complains and our voices because they feel he's in a good place because when they play tested he did well.  People of every skill level go into the PTB and we're all kinda in the same boat here; he needs some buffs.  Whether its numbers or getting rid of sounds/model design, something needs to be fixed.
---
HAHAHA
---
To little effect though. She moves pretty quickly while charging her corrupt and doesn't need much time seeing you to hit you with it given it's range. Not only that but it lasts a good amount of time and doesn't deplete unless you hit her with a pallet. You'd be better off trying to blend in than use corners.
---
You could barely mindgame his power to begin with without pills. Now he has his traps which can help in chase and also the teleport which gives him a great way to pressure.
---
Will he be top tier? I don't think so, but he's so much better than current Freddy.
---
I wouldnt cleanse unless my team is and then use fountains way out of the way. So no I wouldnt cleanse most of the time it just gives the plague her power
---
Theyve buffed a lot of totem locations, there isnt much more to be done with them
---
A second of extra time against the huntress to prepare and get distance is 10 seconds of chase. Thats a huge benefit especially if it lets you burn an inconvenient pallet early in the chase instead of one that is more valuable.
---
Yeah I was gonna say that DS was still good
---
Exactly. So something even easier at winning a chase should probably be someone mew heal against. Legion can cancel his power before hitting mew, effectively leaving mew against a 115 killer with 125 capabilities
---
Not much else to say, you can't please everyone.
---
Then why did you bring it up in reference to good survivors?
---
Indeed. I didn’t get it before because I didn’t support the perk, but now it is to prevent tunneling, and can be countered, so I will now go ahead and get it for myself. I’m sure a lot of others feel that way too
---
Have you ever tried it on Freddy?
---
Freddy works well with a Hit &amp; Run kind of playstyle and it seems like it would have some kind of synergy with him. 
---
Yeah, I get what you mean though. Dark Devotion seems like such a fun perk but the Devs have added a way too many restrictions which have kind of ruined any fun you can have with it. I wish they could just have a patch where they worked on all the perks in the game that are pointless or have little to no use.
---
The black and white people were meg and claudette, but their skin color was switched(claud was white and meg was black in alpha. and beta I think). Idk who the other dude on the left is. But plz Carl the Cashier :)
---
The corrupt purge? Is that worse than running around broken, vomiting and infecting other survivors and the environment? I'm genuinely curious because i haven't had much experience against her so far.
---
I mean, that particular add-on for Plague is ultra-rare, so it's not super common, but in most cases, yes. Ultra rare add-ons usually mean that people are really taking the game seriously.
---
You don't have to run far at all. The way scratch marks work, they'll be all over the walls, and generally pointing in that direction if you just turn that way for a split second. It's risky but it pays off a lot of the time. And it is not a mechanically difficult move. But the issue we are discussing is sound. So let's say it works, the killer takes the bait and goes left, when the survivor went right. So now, the survivor has to quietly move away, or stay hidden. If they make a mistake and sprint, the killer could hear the footsteps and correct their own mistake. You believe that should not be the case, and sprinting should be silent to the killer?
---
titties
---
It’s just extremely inconsistent and isn’t worth using outside of memes
---
Yeah, but the real power of Evil Within 3 comes from that crazy lunge. It saves so much time on a loop. Plague isn't bad, it's just boring to not have a power because nobody wants to cleanse.
---
I'll give them the whole PTB and sometime after, even if they announce "Yeah we know, we're working on something and we'll have it out" I'll take it.  I know he's bugged ATM but they can easily fix that and should be able to do SOMETHING about his power.
---
Jane is so thick. You already know David king is at the campfire hitting it from the back with his bruised ass knuckles and fire haircut
---
Her corrupt purge imo is more powerful than Nurse blinks, since it can hit multiple people in one shot and takes little to no skill and is almost impossible to dodge if they are smart.  I’d rather be injured 24/7 than have to face her corrupt purge.
---
Takes 4 seconds. Not 5. And you're supposed to stalk from a short distance away.
---
It's a free down, it's SUPPOSED to be easily counterable. You NEED to be good at stealth.
---
Agree with the rest though
---
And i'm not happy playing against the same 4 killers all the time because the other ones are not viable in higher ranks. I am always happy to face a trapper or wraith because its something different than the Billy/Nurse/Spirit/Huntress spam. We need more killers that are actually threatening.   
---
I do like going against nurse because she takes a lot more skill to both play and play against. She is pure mind game, and you have to learn how that particular nurse blinks, how to counter it, and know where your LOS breakers are and how to juke her with those LOS breaks. But someone like Ghostface? Just being casually aware of your surroundings will break him out of his stealth. He's just an M1 killer who can crouch for most games.
---
On my better days I kind of view the killer as the GM of the game, and it's their job to provide a fun match for the survivors.
---
I'll judge perks on whether they are fun to play against on both sides, and avoid behavior that makes me annoyed to have done to me, such as tunneling or camping.
---
I don't think some of my opinions are shared by the community though. When I play as survivor, I find NOED to be exciting. It changes the dynamic and keeps the stakes high even as victory is near.
---
DS: Good
---
Bond: Useful in solo
---
PGTW: Mediocre
---
OP: Bad
---
I really like your idea of a spotting system, and that would basically eliminate the bug that eliminates his power. Such a thing could also be added to a perk like Object of Obsession to ensure that the killer has to be in view of the survivor in order for it to activate and not just in the general direction from across the map.
---
The additional changes I would add is this:
---
1. Survivors who are hooked or in the dying state can't disable Ghostface's ability at any point.
---
2. **Only the survivor being stalked** can disable it by looking at him (otherwise SWFs would again have an advantage over solos).
---
3. 2.5 seconds to disable his power after the killer is in the viewing box (about the same time as disabling a bear trap), and 5 seconds needed for Ghostface to successfully stalk a survivor into the exposed state.
---
4. Obviously when he goes in or out of his stalk a sound alert can be played for all survivors, but other than that there shouldn't be any sound heard from him unless he's really near a survivor.
---
With these four changes along with the viewing box Ghostface would be alright at base. His perks are another issue.
---
Everything can get old, obviously. 
---
If you keep only getting Billy you're gonna get sick of him. Same thing with any other map/killer.
---
Billy and Huntress are fun to play against in healthy doses, as they are strong killers that have counterplay.
---
accurate, I never see Jeff’s
---
WHY IS BEHAVIOUR SO INCOMPETENT AT MAKING GAMES
---
I think ghostface could've been fresh. Yeah people say he's just Myers + pig, but he's the fun parts. He was slow and scary, sneaking up, hiding and looking at you.  Yeah slow is bad but they gave him speed back by rewarding the stalk with instadown. Then they fucked it all up by making him useless
---
&gt;Play as Killer? Toxic
---
I lul'd
---
YOU WANT SOME FUCKING RAGE DEVS??? ILL GIVE YOU SOME FUCKING RAGE. YESTERDAY ON PS4 I PLAYED SOME ASSHAT IN A MATCH. RIGHT WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO WIN THIS INCEL POS DDOS/PUSHED ME OFF THE GAME. THEN THIS ARROGANT POS TOLD ME HOW LONG THE ATTACK WAS AND THAT I NEEDED TO "COUNT TO 2700". THIS IS A FUCKING CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS GUY, THIS INCEL POS, IS DOING THIS TO PLAYERS OF YOUR GAME!!! COULDN'T USE MY OWN INTERNET FOR ABOUT A FUCKING HOUR BECAUSE THIS NUTLESS FUCKTARD COULDN'T HANDLE LOSING A MATCH. I WENT EVERYWHERE I COULD TO REPORT THIS GUY BY NAME AND NOT EVEN HINT OF A REPLY. NOTHING. SO WHAT DEVS? YOU JUST COOL WITH THIS? I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS RAN INTO THIS BOIPUSSY-LOVING TWATOSAURUS AND YOU ALL SHOULD HAVE BANNED HIM FROM THE GET GO. NOT LET HIM ROME FREE. CAN'T POST HIS NAME HERE RIGHT? BUT I CAN'T FUCKING REPORT HIM EITHER APPARENTLY. WHAT THE FUCK DEVS? JUST GONNA AID THIS RECTAL WART OF A CRIMINAL? IN YOUR OWN GAME??? FUCKING DO SOMETHING TO THIS POS DDOS-ER'S WHO THINK THEY ARE UNTOUCHABLE. GET THIS ASSHOLE OFF PS4. CAN'T BE THAT FUCKING HARD, I CAN GIVE YOU HIS PSN NAME FUCKING EASY.
---
Yeah exactly im not gonna freak out. Im just gonna give the devs a chance to fix whats wfong we owe them this.
---
I wonder if Demi's video will change that. Panda is a faithful Jeff main too.
---
Agreed
---
This is BhVR
---
Wow, it's almost like when you sell people terrible shit three times in a row at $7 a pop with no way to refund it, they're going to get progressively more and more pissed off each time.
---
lol no worries! If you remember in the first movie, Laurie stabbed him in the eye with a hanger. They gave him a blind eye in the new movie so I just drew it here for the hell of it
---
Woah take it easy dude
---
Honestly. There’s no way in hell (I pray) that BHVR will release him in the state that he is now, they’ll definitely buff him. What I got a problem with the most though is BHVR being scared of adding a very strong killer just because of entitled survivors.
---
Indeed, the PTB is a test. Which means it's open to constructive criticism.  
---
Calling him bad and saying he needs buffing is constructive, even if it doesn't directly point to solutions. It's useful feedback for the developers and will play a part in his eventual buff.  
---
Calling the devs dumb is not constructive. It's just pointless insults. Luckily, only a loud minority is getting personal about this Ghostface fiasco, and people seem to be doing a good job at ignoring these angry infants.
---
We've been waiting for a Freddy rework for 2 years. What makes you think we're getting this one soon?
---
You have it, it's spirit, hag and Huntress (although she is map dependant).
---
All three of them are better than billy against competent survivors.
---
They need to let him get Fengs face too so I can play her on both sides :)
---
If your complaint is them not listening to feedback, I'm totally on your side. Plague launch was super disappointing. 
---
I guess my point was that we should be pressuring BHVR to listen to feedback during the PTB this time instead of talking about the PTB product being shitty, if that makes more sense
---
It looks so bad seeing a cartoon character try to sneak up on people with a mask and knife.
---
Most killers in the game are M1 killers, only a couple have damaging abilities, BHVR seems to be really shy about making damaging abilities even though huntress was a good one. (Not counting iridecent head with carry count add-ons)
---
Where the hell did you get 100% from
---
yikes I bought auric cells for my Meg hair cosmetic and now it looks like pixelated YARN, revert these changes BHVR
---
I play him sometimes in high ranks without Ruin, and I don't think he needs any buff. You just need to know when to rew his chainsaw and when not, and it's definitely not a secret knowledge.
---
am i the only one that does worse as the plague when survivors cleanse
---
Excuse me? Spirit is absolutely great an she's strong.
---
Yeah, but people aren't likely to farm with a killer, which is what I originally said lol
---
See the thing is people need ot buy him first to wear them in the first place, and I dont see many people buying him
---
Just use a cypress, why waste the green?
---
* nice
---
Then I have absolutely no idea what rank you're playing at, but I refuse to believe it's anywhere above 20.
---
Oh yeah, no. I am fine with all of the constructive criticism. I was just flabbergasted at some of the comments haha, especially the "did they even test him?" remark that I found on the first day of the PTB. It begged the question: "you do know that the PTB is a test, right?" I am starting to see a lot of these kinds of comments and rage posts gaining traction to the point it is a little silly, and lot of people still refuse to acknowledge that Ghostface is bugged and not working as intended.
---
They don't lose add ons and items only if the killer DCs at the beginning, I believe.
---
True
---
&gt; What makes you think we're getting this one soon?
---
Freddy was released before the PTB....
---
This PTB they have **Literally said some buffs they are giving him**
---
But because Freddy is bad we just ignore those now don't we?
---
The next killer needs to be able to do the point and beckon emotes :D
---
I mean, personally I feel like leatherface is too fast when chainsawing. Whenever he gets close enough to chainsaw you, you're basically going to go down unless you're in the middle of a loop and he fucks up into the wall which almost NEVER happens to me. Buff his base movement speed and nerf his movement speed when using his chainsaw so he can catch up to survivors better but easier to dodge when using his instadown.
---
Why yikes?
---
How would that be balanced in any way though? Killers could just abuse that like they abused moonwalking on Legion.
---
what if they ecscape
---
I have never really gotten that sense tbh. Plague is a decently strong killer with a lot of potential, especially in the right hands. I have tons of friends who dominate with her, but all I see is people complain that "all survivors have to do is not cleanse and she's useless". Really? Cause that is exactly what my Plague main friends want you to do: not cleanse. Free instadowns all the way.
---
I think Thrilling Tremors could be good. Do you know if the cooldown is ever less than 100 seconds?
---
Shh, this subreddit is for killer mains my dude. "Can't get a 4k instadown in the first 10 seconds of a chase? Killer needs a buff."
---
Tbh if I had to choose for one to be erased it would be Dead by Daylight because they haven’t been able to create a balance between Fun to play and fun to play against since Spirit. At least the Deathgarden Devs know how to balance and if you don’t find it interesting that is a alright opinion but games tend to get boring when they devs fail to fix their mistakes.
---
I’ve just been ‘disconnected from host’ about 5 times in a row. Currently in a lobby now though. Hopefully is solved
---
His ability in my opinion is completely trash tier, even with "not being able to break him out of stealth". Look at the Plague. She's just trash, nobody cleanses and then loops her for 5 gens.
---
Two Words 
---
Endgame. Collapse.
---
I mean if they escape what is a green one going to do?
---
Chill tf out PTB is a thing for a reason
---
Because after the gates are powered she can just tunnel people to death? That's the big thing. Hell she can still do that, provided she put a trap on someone's head BEFORE the last gen is powered. It's honestly perfectly fine
---
Why can't players of this game just try and enjoy both roles? I started enjoying the game as a whole much more when I started playing Survivor as well as killer, and now actually find myself enjoying the survivor perspective a bit more than the killer one, though I still alternate playing as either regularly. It really gives me a much broader understanding of the game's mechanics in general and has made me a better player as well I'd like to think.
---
The game isn't that hard to get into, trust me, you'll only get paired with other noobies, normal players can't derank past rank 15 and no one really makes new accounts to smurf rank 20s
---
Love the Baywatch ending lol :)
---
Might have to try that combo &lt;3
---
This sounds legit as a good plan but they might have their hands tied due to legal stuff so the release date may be impossible to move.
---
Stop making it a "_________ mains are a bunch of babies and cry over everything" each side has their own shitty people. You're complaining right now about survivors
---
I unfortunately just usually get a ton of stabs a mostly 2Ks or so haha
---
Because all the REALLY good survivors stay at rank 1.
---
Truly the most oppressed minority
---
He doesn’t need a buff he’s strong af already. 
---
Don’t get it with ppl saying he’s bad he literally just runs behind ppl then instadowns them.
---
I’ve gotten a splinter for him before and I got a 4K easy... with no perks. He doesn’t need a buff.
---
If you know the killers are shit... why are you buying them?
---
That's without add ons. And a good killer will block off the nearest pallet during the stun. mew may have healed, but at least mew arent a one hit. By your logic, mew shouldn't heal against any killers because mew just wasted your time healing
---
Lmao nice! Why didn’t she just close it though.
---
Why didn't he just close the hatch xd
---
Thing is, no matter how good you are with ghostface, if all survivors has passed a certain low skill bar, ghostface will never 4k or win in matter of fact, with no matter of how good he plays.
---
Bitch I play with the game muted
---
Oh.. I couldn't pick... they're all my fav--[this](https://i.imgur.com/2XLBjL7.png) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/T2vypp4.png)
---
I dont think you can copyright a phone
---
Thanks for the visual. Tbh you know David hit and quit every female around that camp fire.. probably even a few of the dudes 🍆🍑
---
My point is, BHVR will say something will happen *cough* Freddy rework *cough* for a long time. I won't be surprised if they sell Ghost Face still and then wait to fix him, depending on how many people buy him. It doesn't matter that Freddy is bad, it matters that they take so long to deliver.
---
While I agree it's a bad idea, it doesn't make survivors invincible. You still have bleedout timers, you still only have 3 hooks per survivor and nurses calling is a thing.
---
It's mostly a bad idea because it would really fuck with new killers and make SWF lobbies even worse for killers.
---
Plus they'd have to do something with the old perks if they decided every survivor passively has them.
---
Would anyone honestly give a shit if they just took Ghostface back to the drawing board with a different approach?
---
There’s no shame in it, you just made a bad killer.
---
*Every comment defending the old DS be like
---
-9999*
---
How exactly can you tunnel or face camp the last survivor? There's no other survivors to go after, and after you get hooked there's no one to save you so it's not really face camping
---
r/TIHI
---
That's my go to hair always haha
---
 Bhvr is getting too big for it britches, allocating resources to projects to bring micro transaction  money( i.e. battle pass, mobile game) into the company’s drying up economy. Honestly dbd is their only game floating the boat, deathgarden though fun and hopefully super successful for them has a hard road ahead of it to turn profit. I fear that bhvr put itself in a corner, no better example than a schedule that is too short of time to properly create a character for a game that is 3 YEARS OLD and is willing to continually sell us incomplete content over and over
---
Totally agree - I can't help but be annoyed myself when people complain about a loss or gloat when they beat me.
---
IMO, the best way to deal with is to respond with kindness.  If they're just toxic assholes it drives them nuts, if they're decent people who just got a little angry it helps them realize they're being assholes.  And if you can't muster kindness, just ignore them, take a deep breath, and move on.
---
Tell me about it.
---
the one that's more fast-paced and has more action is the boring one
---
okay
---
You tend to scroll past those comments you agree with but get hung up on those you strongly disagree with.
---
Seeing as how 80% of the community are survivors, I don't think you actually have more killers complaining.
---
Because it's a terrible idea.
---
Now you're going to get downvoted for mentioning downvotes.
---
I work with a guy who only games on console I and tell him that he needs better friends.  Also I f you’re playing games online you’re never really alone.
---
I can see that, yeah. Different tastes.
---
&gt; The others are just Julie pretending to be other people!
---
#Juliemain4life!
---
in one side we have the oppressed class of workers called killers in the other side we have the class of rich people who have everything easy to win called survivors
---
the killer has to be in front of the locker the moment you PRESS A BUTTON to get out. (not when you actually get out)
---
I’m not very good, but never have I felt that the game is unbalanced, I just suck
---
Cause he can multi instadown, billy only gets the 1 and is harder to control
---
I played this game on day 1. It was fun, incredibly unbalanced, but fun.
---
It really hasn't changed that much since then and I feel like the people who laid the foundation might be gone at this point.
---
I agree NOED does nothing but award the killers for doing bad and punish the survivors for doing good. People like to use the argument that since you can destroy totems to take down NOED that it’s balanced but in reality if you don’t play swf how will you know how many totems are left. I think they should put a totem number in the game so survivors can see how many are left.
---
Joke: ruin
---
I got them tombstones in the back
---
&gt;Just had 4 swf run out the same gate all with reverse bear traps on their head
---
Put them on before last gen is repaired
---

---
You need fake animated cleavage that bad?
---
I don’t doubt that *you* have, but if I have the numbers right, Ghostface’s power applies Exposed for 20 (?) seconds. If a survivor is sitting at his feet and uses the 4 seconds he spends stalking to sprint away from him in a straight line, by the time Ghostface can catch up to them the status will have worn off. 
---
Obviously you want to use his stalk stealthily so you can creep up for the one-hit-down, but it’s so hard to get it off when all a survivor has to do is turn their camera towards you for 1 second. If the survivor had to actually face their character towards Ghostface and either stare at him or point at him, I think it would be a much more fair state of balance for his power instead of being able to just do what you’re doing (repair, heal, loop, cleanse) uninterrupted and stop his power.
---
He literally has no power. Even if he did, 20 seconds of exposed is like one loop.
---
He's really awful.
---
In a high ranked game you will NEVER get multi instadowns (unless youre basement camping or something)
---
Should just be Carl and the bee.
---
I'm aware I'm simply pointing out that bubba doesn't need a buff.
---
You like technician?
---
Totally agree, thats a needed change
---
If that’s how the mother and child wants to bond, so be it. I do agree that it is odd that it’s Dbd, but hey, everyone is different and responds differently to different things :p
---
I have read *reduced crouching speed* as *reduced speed*, so I'm dumb
---
Not every killer needs to be 100% viable at red ranks, if you’re good with the killer you’ll do fine.
---
&gt;awesome game
---
citation needed
---
Yeah, there kind of is, because I never lost a single match after getting to know the game's full features.
---
It's really not, at all, that unique.  It's a complete rip-off, and has nothing interesting to offer.
---
yes
---
Again, it’s just an idea that I personally thought would’ve been cool. I didn’t expect it to actually be implemented into the game.
---
Its all subjective.
---
One good straw man deserves another.
---
But good points in your actual explanation.
---
Killers like Pig, Wraith, Legion, Cannibal, and Freddy(hopefully for not much longer) are so easy to counter. They are in turn aren’t fun to play and fun to play against in that they are easy to bully because they under perform.
---
I think woman get perved on enough in gaming, it’s time for the men, string hard men, in thongs....
---
Translation: I'm a bad killer who gets mad when survivors don't automatically fear me even though I do the same thing every other killer does, tunnels, camps, doesn't try to pressure survivors or act menacing at all :c
---
A vocal minority is when a small group of people in a larger group is so "vocal/loud" that they suppress the majority and are therefore percieved as the majority by people outside the group. Think the toxic fnaf fandom, the toxic people are a minority, just they are seen more than the non-toxic majority so people assume the majority of the fandom is toxic.
---
but then everyone using it would get facecamped bc breasts
---
don't do that.
---
It's 21
---
It shouldn't even be called a chapter imo
---
Oh look downvoted by petty survs that don't like hearing the truth \^\_\^
---
exit the game and restart it.  for xbox go into the app control
---
The green one lets you tunnel them. The yellow one can't be used unless you leave the player for last. Green is for one person you've hooked. Yellow is for the last survivor. Green guarantees as long as you tunnel.
---
It's not about wanting to see cleavage, it's about equality.
---
love having a hillbilly who does nothing but get 2 inches from your back and insta-saw you.  insanely fun and engaging gameplay.  extra fun when they push you into corners you can't run out of and trap you then facecamp you in the basement :)
---
I won’t lie, noed is ass annoying, but at least we have counter play, such as doing the totems. Sadly at higher ranks ppl rush gens too fast hahahaha
---
Shut up killer main reeeeeee
---
Were you working there ? You cant tell, bugs are bugs and some of them make no sense. They built a lot of hype for this, theres no way they didn’t test it
---
THIS IS SURPRISINGLY WHOLESOME AND MUCH NEEDED. THOUGH THERE ARE THINGS TO RAGE ABOUT IN THE GAME, PEOPLE TEND TO OVERREACT AND BLAME "THE DEVS" CONSTANTLY. JUST STOP PLAYING BEFORE Y'ALL HAVE A HEART ATTACK, MY GOD!
---
Satisfying to watch
---
It’s a trade of power. Pallets Stuns &gt; Any other stuns. 
---
Despite the main use of the perk, the fact that it reduced DS and Head On was apparently unintended (tbh that’s good cause Head On was not worth it before this) and this makes those perks better now. It’s a buff but also a transition of power for the perk. If people don’t take Head On or DS then it’ll never fully click why but if then games like this are t predictable.
---
Hey at least you owned it instead of arguing a moot point, and you didn't even get salty, good on ya mate.
---
Does this mean doctor is D tier?
---
How is changing a single perk supposed going to make them lose a bunch of money? Just don't go straight to the gates and stay hidden until you can find the totem. Usually, killers will run around the 2 gates when NOED is active so they can actually use it, so you can take advantage of this and destroy their lifeline. Sure this is inconvenient, but it's only a minor one. Just try this and maybe it will be a little less of an issue.
---
Quick and Quiet is so damn fun, especially when you make the godly locker plays❤️
---
Legion didn't get reworked, he got nerfed so far into the ground that people make daily pilgrimages to piss on it's grave, ala Postal 2 style.
---
My man, switch it empathy for Bond. So much more useful than empathy.
---
One year playing this game and I didnt know anything about that sales
---
His pallet stun noise sounds like a deep sigh of frustration.
---
I HATE THAT IF YOU'RE A KILLER RUNNING META PERKS AND PLAYING NURSE/BILLY YOU ARE CONSIDERED A TRY HARD AND SWEATY. 
---
BUT IF YOU'RE A SURVIVOR RUNNING IN A SWF GROUP, META PERKS, INSTANT HEAL MEDKIT/FLASHLIGHTS; YOU ARE JUST PLAYING THE GAME TO SURVIVE.
---
LIKE WHY IS ONE SIDE DEMONIZED FOR PLAYING TO WIN BUT THEY OTHER SIDE IS JUSTIFIED FOR PLAYING TO WIN?!?!
---
I'm glad they're working on fixing him.
---
It's weird that such glaring issues made it to the PTB, but oh well.
---
Unfortunately these issues turned him from and instant buy to a "probably going to wait a while to buy."
---
Big sad.
---
Did you just completely change your comment? lol.
---
Hag is the most boring killer to face against IMO. If its a bad hag, all she does is trap the hook and proxy camp it so whoever gets downed first doesnt get to play. And if its a good hag then the game turns into crawling simulator because you cant walk or run anywhere without walking into a trap. The only killer that rivals the power of Hag is Nurse obviously but Hag is not that far behind.
---
Tbh, once you learn the spawns, they are pretty easy to find for the most part. Some maps can be odd, but a lot are quite easy.
---
In regards to killers not applying enough pressure, some survivors are great at looping, and pallets can be very generous at times 
---
To the ppl that don’t use meta killers, it’s to keep the game fresh. Not using ruin is odd, but the reasoning is due to good survivors finding it within the first 30 seconds
---
I personally have no issue with NOED. I'm at rank 3 as a survivor now and honestly, at least half of my games are BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury killers. Not a lot rely on NOED anymore.
---
from what i've heard that's totally acceptable now i guess during egc
---
That’s the state they nerfed it from but usable by all 4 people, so there is no chance of it happening.
---
Her TR change is a bigger deal.
---
\&gt; Just comparing the live/PTB versions of certain cosmetics.
---
The PTB wouldn't render in anything other than "low" for some reason unfortunately. I might update later (probably not tho).
---
Must be on your end then because i'm on Ultra on the PTB.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
---
This is really bad comparaison.
---
cant say anything because this game aint on console
---
How did you achieve this? I would love to know
---
Let em cleanse, never get swallow the juice. Now survivors will run around infecting everything without fountains to cleanse on, turning all 4 of them into No Mithers.
---
People need to realize that yes, while the PTB is absolutely for testing things, it should not be the end all be all of testing phases. I look at the PTB as a public beta, however Ghost Face feels like he has only just stepped into Alpha. 
---
In house testing is just as important as public testing, and with regard to Ghost Face it is almost certain that no in house testing was conducted at all. It’s almost as if no one even played the character before releasing him to beta.
---
If this is how production is to be conducted then the developers should absolutely be lambasted and their shoddy work insulted. We are only two weeks out from Ghost Face’s release and he is nowhere near ready for it. 
---
TL;DR: Devs should have done their own testing, they deserve the hate they’re receiving.
---
It removes the spike in Kate’s hair at least, when she did other actions sometimes a spike would appear.
---
I’m gay, so that’s very likely to happen. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
So you want old DS.  No thanks.
---
I think they should lower the timer to 25/35/45 and make it stop when you are slugged. That way if you are truly tunneled and slugged the killer gets punished and your perk is used.
---
Yeah right haha
---
Yea, plague is a one trick killer. I main her and try to spend all my bps on her so I can play every game with the red addon for the wallhack and the apple for at leas 1 corrupt purge.
---
\*feels sad man console doesnt have old man bill\*
---
So it would be an even bigger immunity perk than it is now? I’ve had too many instances of a DS user being unhooked and me downing and hooking 1-2 different survivors just to get hit with DS when I happen to run into them again. How would this not exacerbate this issue? It’s fine as it is now, honestly it could use a slight decrease to the window of activation.
---
Rip indeed.... Rip the ultimate warrior too
---
Other then the phasing sound in terror radius being removed after the ptb, what other changes did they make?
---
Yes but the matchmaking would need to work for that, and right now its completly random.
---
I'd rather the killers start out strong and get nerfed if needed than having more Legion-tier trash killers released.
---
Yup. Right after pizza boi got his salad tossed.
---
Yeah, but the trade off is you can charge it fast so it shouldn't last that long. Myers has to get to tier 3 which is more than 5 seconds.
---
There is no proof that it didn't have something to do with it. I just said there was a reason for removing it. That's one possible reason. You're the one saying your opinion is fact and that everyone else is wrong if they disagree. Personally, I think the idea of an early flip phone having a selfie camera is stupid (hat is making shit up to fit a narrative,) but I'm not going to attack people online that thought otherwise.
---
I'm curious: why do you think killers give devs more money?
---
If the killer was camping or on a hard patrol, there's not much you can do since the endgame implementation. The door is open, the timer is counting down (albeit more slowly since someone is hooked), but you probably didn't have time to run across the map, cleanse far away, and get back to the hooked survivor in time. Good chance if both of you were in an injured (or broken) state that she could have gotten both of you. You can't save everyone. If you got her off the hook and she was still downed, she at least got some extra points in boldness and chase than she would have had you left her to die on the hook.
---
THIS GAME ON GAMEPASS FOR XBOX IS A NIGHTMARE. TEAMMATES SUICIDING ON HOOKS, DROPPING PALLETS WHEN THE KILLER ISNT EVEN AROUND, MISSING SKILLCHECKS, AND NOT HEALING. 
---
I GET BEING NEW, BUT WITH THE CLUSTERFUCK MATCH MAKING LATELY ITS EVERY ROUND.
---
78 is the original...
---
I know this is anecdotal, but I play both sides and it's only ever the survivors which drop the n word and tell me to kill myself. I think the group mentality and the gameplay of being chased by the killer breeds animosity towards the killer, even though that's what your signing up for when you decide to play survivor.
---
Just my 2 cents!
---
THANK YOU&lt;3
---
See  i like Urban evasion, Alert, and Poised. the 3rd one depends on the mood im in right now its Live forever cause im farming BP. But no i do not go out of my wy for ranks in it.
---
Perfectly described!
---
Where'd you get these custom perk icons?
---
Huntress would shit on him. Not only does she hunt big ass animals and humans on the daily, but she also was able to dismantle entire squadrons of german troops invading Russia.
---
Its so boring tho
---
Almost every new player uses NOED and gets alot of kills with it at trash ranks. Since  almost every babykiller has it, nerfing it  (to a degree so its no longer freekills) noobs will have much less fun moments and wont play the game as much.

Why tf would you stop the timer? You know how many times ive had captain jackass jump off the hook and run into me anyway 20s later? I feel like it should only activate in the killers tr similar to bt. Too many bs perks can be stacked together and ds is in a decent spot. So no, the timer should keep going. Go ahead and downvote.
---
I'd say just buy them.
---
Thats like saying the killer can still use noed even if all the totems have been broken.
---
Still haven't seen no short shorts on any dudes yet either.
---
Maybe wait. I think psn has a summer sale.  Unless your in a rush
---
Legion was changed though.
---
Spirit didn't need any changes other than the phasing sound being removed inside of terror radius to improve mindgames.
---
Plague doesn't need changes...
---
What did/does Clown need changed?
---
She followed you for a heal and you act like a dick towards her? Why? She deserved it? My man, this is a team game. You help each other to survive, not act like a douche.
---
Yup, also waiting for this
---
He briefly appears in the original intro to dbd stuck in a bear trap.
---
I think it's more '4x the amount of playerbase would hate it than if it was weak'
---
Yeah, it was close for a second
---
I'd agree with this if not for the fact that the changes "may or may not be made before release."
---
Don't really see a point of testing something if you don't fix it before you make people pay money for it.
---
But I'll keep my fingers crossed.
---
Aye, everyone enjoys different things! I was just giving my own opinion &lt;:
---
It’s so fluffy
---
Hopefully, we haven’t heard from him in awhile.
---
I'm one of the few that actually uses Nurse on console (XB1) and despite everyone saying she's nearly impossible, it really isn't that hard. Sure, some buildings and the tractors on certain maps are hard as hell to effectively chase a survivor through. But if you practice playing with medium to high sensitivity, it's easy to blink adjacent to a juking survivor and almost completely turn around as you lunge attack. I've never played the PC version, but I wouldn't say she isn't that far below her keyboard and mouse version.
---
this community is toxic...i write one word and i get downvoted
---
Not stop, maybe extended from 60 seconds.
---
&gt; By your logic, mew shouldn't heal against any killers because mew just wasted your time healing
---
How exactly, my point is that against a killer who can injure you easily but not down you, why heal?
---
you are just healing to feel safe, not for a tactical reason
---
it makes me feel icky
---
No need to be salty. Theres a reason I names it unpopular opinion. I knew almost no one would agree. So no, you're comment is not liked, go ahead and downvote.
---
Endgame collapse is already killer sided, and pig players are obsessed with patrolling their boxes.
---
He uses the camera to get high quality pictures for his articles and a flip phone from the 1800s would not look very good.
---
Also idiots care
---
Also it's hard to define what a truly 'balanced' killer is.  Most of the higher tier killers are ones who can consistently 4K yet that's not BHVR's definition of a successful/good Killer.
---
I guess it’s because I started on console playing COD I never really expected to end up playing a game like DBD.
---
it is rather fluffy like he is taming a white mans afro
---
The PTB isnt a test, its just a free advertisement for the DLC so streamers can show it off before it releases. They almost never make significant changes before release (Spirit was the exception, they actually changed a lot of the things that made her bad and made her extremely powerful). Its just a PAB - Public Advertising Build at this point. 
---
How are they going to change the numerous problems with ghostface before the DLC releases? They themselves even said that all of the changes they’re looking into arent guarenteed to come out with the patch that releases Ghostface. So they are going to release a half baked boring killer and then fix him in two months with the Mid chapter patch. Lol what a joke
---
The hatch "literally" (not figuratively) wins games for survivors who can do all tge work, or none and it's not reliant on a perk and a totem. If NOED gets changed then survivors should need a perk to use the hatch.
---
Simple change, make it so it's already lit at the beginning
---
How so?
---
How about the person/s your stalking lose Fov (to a certain extent) depending on the severity of the stalk?
---
The killer is from the 90s though
---
Strange that something as simple as aesthetics can make young people feel gross
---
Plag tho...
---
The problem with trying to balance a game that's asymmetrical to be competitive is that whenever one side gets nerfed or buffed the opposing side seems to think they're getting a bad deal for example killers moaning about MOM while survivors may complain about NOED, the devs would need to find a way balance every perk in the game somewhat equally because in order to have a functioning competitive game you need a good state of balance, which like it or not DBD isn't in a good state of balance at the moment therefore not allowing it to be truly competitive because in order for a game to effectively be competitive it needs to function mainly on skill and if they add in rewards for ranking up, that's good, hiwever in it's current state a system for ranking up hasn't been added in therefore we can't judge it yet but right now it's pointless.
---
Perks are the bain of balance in DBD, in my opinion DS wasn't unfair and tgat same opinion is shared by a lot of people and vice versa, so how are you meant to balance a game like DBD when much of the opinions based around balance are different and varied, one group of people may think a perk is useless while others think it's OP, Nurse is terrible on console but is S tier on PC so how would they be able to balance the game so that everyone is happy, for example Overwatch has it's issues but they solve the issue of balance by constant updates and the characters themselves are designed to fill a certain role and in the occasion that they are too strong or weak they can manipulate their abilities in a way which can enable them to become more balanced while still being useful to a degree, which enables them to create a competitive game. But due to how DBD functions as a game they are unable to balance it in such a way, thus not allowing DBD to be a truly competitive game.
---
And just to clarify when I said I play for fun it doesn't mean I don't play to win, I just disregard the ranking system as a whole because it gives me no reason to care about it, if I play a game and get one kill I don't care because I don't lose anything worthwhile and as while if I do bad then that's my fault, but I don't play DBD competitively because there's no reason to get competitive,it's one of the reason why for honor failed at establishing a form of competitive play, because the gameplay wasn't balanced and someone found a way to cheese their way to victory.
---
What can you define as winning in DBD?, getting one kill?, two kills?, three kills?, or do you only think killing all four is the only way to "win" the game there's no defeat or victory notification saying you won or lost, your only objective as killer is to stop survivors from escaping, if you stop even one survivor then technically you fulfilled your role as killer getting more then one is  bonus.
---
That's how arguments work, I make a point, you chose to argue your view and I chose to argue mine and it's a constant back and forth until one person can no longer argue their point, there's no "cherry picking" It's just when someone spots a key point in your argument they tend to make counter arguments based around what you said that's how most arguments go.
---
Disclaimer: I play console so I'm reliant on streamers for footage, audio quality varies.
---
Not every killer should be Hag/Billy/Spirit tier though.
---
Pig is mid tier though, which is a reasonable place for all things to be. The whole point of balance is to be in the middle, not so strong you invalidate most of everyone else.
---
I don't understand why everyone thinks that perks should be Borrowed Time or Adrenaline Tier, or that Killers should all be Billy or Nurse.
---
except they released the test build knowing it was heavily bugged in ways that wont make it into the final release, making all the test results worthless, since we arent able to test under the correct conditions anyway.
---
yeah i know its a weird reaction but yeah i dont know if its the hair alone of the stash

---
Ah, but that's when I say that you're a good killer. And I'm mostly referring to the bad killers and the bad survives of the rank 15. But actually tho, how is it and immunity perk, the way I see, it either prevents you from being farmed or let's you not get farmed.
---
On the one hand, I understand people are tired of the response to everything being more hysteria.  On the other hand, Ghostface is *that* bad.
---
Spirit maybe she is in third place after billy but everyone else is mid year so no survivor main! We need another powerful killer to put things right! Survivors should fear the killer not try to be hot shots.
---
I'm sorry, that's just not true.
---
I reached Rank 1 reset after reset with Legion without any bullshit addons or moonwalking.
---
They were more annoying than powerful, but stating that they were flat out weak is just wrong.
---
The ability to keep an entire SWF injured is an incredibly valuable tool.
---
*Now*, of course, they are entirely useless.
---
Id like it if they give him more than just exposed like what myers has.
---
From a series of horror movies that continued to have sequels until...2011
---
The hair goes with the stash because it’s a Victorian era hairstyle and facial hair
---
I don't think they knew about all of the bugs. That seems a bit presumptuous.
---
Yeah I thought of something like that where the screen fogs around the edges or something but at the same time, it would tell the person getting stalked that they are being stalked which kinda nerfs the ability in a way.
---
If your tired of her perks just us Small Game
---
How about a non ranked mode with different variations of powers for the try hards and the target audience?
---
The problem is BHVR has a pretty poor tract record with fixing Killer out of the PTB, see Legion.
---
Okay good to know. Is every killer viable? I feel like if I played a lot I'd get decently high ranked (I'm high elo in OW and LoL currently). I know Freddy is trash and is getting a rework, but besides him can every killer be played at a decent level?
---
But I can't not run DS when I'm constantly tunneled off the hook. The only other counter I see is BT, but I cant force the other survs to bring it so that's no help.
---
Real talk, can we get shaggy as a survivor?
---
I thought that was why the endgame was added so that the killer can stop an easy win. I agree it shouldn’t be as easy as that but the hatch can be prevented whereas noed cant unless all totems are gone which is very unfun to do.
---
Plague is still unplayable on PS4, because corrupt purge often slows the game down to under 5fps. especially if several gens have been fixed and/or youre near a hooked survivor.
---
Also Killers complaining that Survivors "bully" them while simultaneously Survivors complain about Killers doing the same.  Though I find it extra humorous/sad when it's Killers playing victim when Killers have all the power and Survivors just have the ability to make things more annoying/less easy.
---
It is tactical. It is considered smart play to take the first hit so mew can make it to a pallet/window quickly. mew can't exactly take that hit if mew dont heal
---
When you use things like *trash*, *babykiller*, *cry and quit* it kinda just kicks the legs out from beneath your argument and makes it look like just another post from someone who died to NOED and chose to rant about it on the forums 
---
Not trying to start an argument, just sayin’
---
nope ill just take the shirt and run LOL. I do actually like the shirt
---
One could argue that killers had that same attitude, hence the DS nerf. But knowing Behavior, they probably got a nice killer nerf in the works.
---
Pretty sure Vigo actually was the hooded figure in the Hallowed Blight cutscenes.
---
Best perk in the game lol
---
You can run better perks honestly, but i think Empathy is better because if your not on SWF it lets you see who the killer is chasing as when an injured survivor is running you can sort of know if they are running from killer or not. Running both is kinda not worth it though
---
Looks good to me.
---
They are working on the bugs
---
I'm not saying the old DS. Honestly the old one was way more OP. I'm just saying that at the state it is now. The killer was an easy way to literally just negate the perk and still tunnel the survivor
---
When you're on the hook staring at Ghost Face tryin to be sneaky
---
Baby killer complaining about his queues have no idea how bad survivor ques are. /s
---
YES but DBD's killer isn't from the horror movies though, he's from the 90s where Twitter didn't exist
---
&gt; It is tactical. It is considered smart play to take the first hit so mew can make it to a pallet/window quickly. mew can't exactly take that hit if mew dont heal
---
You can though, frenzy does no damage to injured survivors other than inflicting the Deep Wound Status effect
---
If the Legion is not using his ability, then you should be running to pallets instead and only a unprepared player would get caught at a window like that.
---
OP says he's new but you say acronyms like he knows them already. And OP may think that "exhaustion perk" is an actual perk rather than a category of perks.
---
A lot of it comes down to personal pref, however I see much more usage of Bond at higher ranks as opposed to Empathy
---
Maybe, but that just seems kinda unfair because like, what if its 90 seconds and now the killer pulls off 2 hooks and stumbles onto you and you now have that extra 30 seconds with Ds to be able to stun
---
In my experience, Empathy has longer range but Bond is a lot more useful overall. You no longer need Self Care because you can find teammates to heal you, you can find people on Gens to work with them for free Co-Op points, you can keep track of the exact position of the killer by monitoring the survivor they are chasing. And yes, you can find injured survivors to heal them, you just need to move a little more to get in that 32-meter range, though 32 meters is a lot more generous than it sounds.
---
If you are solo que, Bond is actually one of the most useful perks in the game.
---
NOED punishes survivors that don't cleanse dull totems.  Usually just one at best before the totem is found, or everyone leaves the survivor that got hooked.  
---
Now if you are the one that got caught, RIP.  If you are going to be altruistic and try and save before dealing with the totem, you got outplayed.  
---
PS.  Not a killer main.
---
got a post to confirm?
---
Never said that, only said that the timer should be stopped, not extended.
---
I didn't realize that something called "Public Test Build" wasn't a test. Truly I have been enlightened.
---
Aside from Legion, when did they need to make major changes to a killer before release?
---
Yes, there are a lot of problems. But instead of demanding that major changes be made in impossibly small amounts of time, maybe we can not purchase the DLC to incentivize them to prioritize his changes over other things on his roadmap and then wait patiently.
---
If legion isnt using his ability, it's like playing against a normal m1 killer. It still fits under the same thing as I might as well not heal against trapper. If I'm on a gen injured with no immediate pallets, and legion isnt using his ability, I'm forced to 360 and juke until either he uses his ability or I can somehow make it to a pallet, and a good killer wont let mew 360 them.
---
WHY THE FUCK IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT HOW THE SPIRIT’S VACUUM NOISE JUST SOMETIMES DOESN’T FUCKING PLAY? IT FEELS LIKE HALF THE TIME SHE JUST HAS PRAYER BEADS WITHOUT EVEN HAVING THEM
---
Disgusting, i love it
---
If this aint the truth. It seriously does seem like theyre scared to just make a strong killer because survivors will jist review bomb the game and shit like they have in the passed.
---
The plague is annoying asf. She’s nowhere near as great as spirit.
---
Google flip phone with self facing camera. It’s not some magical invention. Also, it’s not 90s Scream ghostface you said so yourself, why does it have to be an early flip phone at all? You’re cherry picking situations from the Scream franchise to fit your weird scenario where the camera works. Maybe they can’t do the 90s because the 90s is a hard limit from the Scream creators /s
---
The low tier is trash, mid tier is bad but can be good depending of the map/ situation,  the high tier is the balanced tier, and we have the nurse tier.
---
...OK you didn't say that but alright
---
Plague isn't top tier but she's definitely good. Also how is she annoying?
---
Well, I mostly want to use the combo for basement plays. Camping Leatherface, ect.
---
But also, you can mind fuck the killer. I played a game not long ago where I slugged a survivor near a locker. When I picked them up, they just immediately broke free from my grasp. It wasn't until after the game when I realized what perks were in play. Talk about epic.
---
The survivors OP mentioned that make up their own rules and bitch if you don’t follow them definitely don’t make up a small portion of players. I’d say more often than not after I have a good killer match there’s survivors bitching about however I played or what killer I used.
---
That is just one killer. I remember Spirit being bad in the PTB and fixed before release into being an incredibly strong killer. I remember Plague being fine. I remember Clown being fine, and only months later did people realize he has poor map pressure. People need to take a chill pill or speak with their wallets and not buy the DLC.
---
because people want what they cant have.
---
I’m not talking about tier. She’s just annoying to play against.
---
This if my favorite Ted talk so far
---
Uh...you mean other than the fact he sucks Dwight’s left nut?
---
Sure it's unfun, but as a killer so are most perks, survivors taking hits, jumping off hooks, yanking them down with them. I feel you, but it does have plenty of counter play, and even after the survivors learn about it, they can find the lit totem. Also while you say it's helping bad killers, it's better than each survivor being tunneled and camped. If they need NOED they are probably doing very fair rotations which is more fun all game. Also the survivors can bring a key and hop in the hatch early to counter NOED. It's not consistent and it's risky, but it's there. Survivors have more free chance perks than killers. Let them have one or two :)
---
Training at the gym, just wanted a quick post before it’s lost from all the current spam :)
---
I had no idea there's a consistent pattern, that's pretty cool, I wish I'd known that.
---
I still disagree with your second point though, but we may have different definitions of viable. I think most killers should be balanced to be around Myers Huntress, and I don't think just changing selfcare would do that.
---
As a trapper main, it ruins me :(
---
I’m just trying to say it’s very unfun to go against almost every game. I play both sides but coming back to the game after a while noed is in almost all of my games after endgame was added.
---
TERRITORIAL IMPERATIVE IS DYSFUNCTIONAL AT THE MOMENT
---
Rough times bro :(
---
Why’d they have to go and make these look like shit after I already bought half of these when they looked good. Wtf.
---
It’s the Sky Pack.
---
u/MegapellicanOne
---
Spirit is this guys main so I’m sure he’ll have good stuff for you!
---
The killers objective is to win or score as many points as possible.
---
If the survivors are stupid that's not the killers fault. Take advantage as much as you'd like. The survivors fucked up, GG.
---
There's really no argument. Camping a hook makes you lose as a killer unless the survivors are dumb and waits all game to rescue instead of rushing gens.
---
it's not burnt it's burning
---
The reason I mentioned tier was because Spirit being great means shes top tier. Again, how is Plague annoying?
---
No real punishment? mew lose two pips, same as killer. Get 0 bloodpoints, and lose everything mew took in. Items, offerings, and add ons.
---
It's pronounced Lok'tar Ogar.
---
I really have free real estate in your head, don’t I?
---
Same to be honest. I have all of these cosmetics and the only ones that are nice changes are Meg's and Kate's. The blonde Feng one looks so thin on the bangs and wtf did they do to Claudette and Nea?
---
Pig is the most fun killer to go up with and against
---
While I'm not a fan of the killer idea, I absolutely love those perk ideas!
---
Happy Cake Day.
---
There’s not even 100 tiers, from the leaks there’s only 50 or so
---
It is the final exam, not the test. This abilty is too easily countered, any competent game tester would find that out before. His ability is so bad it need lots and lots of work and they want to release that in 2 weeks. It is imposible to fix him in that short amount of time, they need to delay the DLC and make patch 2.9.9 with bug fixes.
---
More power to you! Good job. I couldn't do it.
---
Not every killer does need to be that strong, but killers need to be threatening to be good.  
---
I know I can use most killers even Legion and get 4ks. But when you run into a team that knows what they are doing, Legion has nothing that can stop them, if you play Legion and go against a team that knows what they are doing, you stand no chance and no killer should be put into that situation. Mid-tier killers have very little hope against those teams unless they make some major mistakes. Billy/Spirit/Hag has the ability to capitalize on smaller mistakes, they still have to be some pretty good mistakes but they have the ability to better handle a good team.
---
No other killer will ever be nurse tier. I would say omega blink nurse is overpowered. But using omega blink verse a good team is an even fight.   
---
If you define balance has a killer and a team of survivors having an equal chance to win. Then nurse is where the mid-ground is (without add ons)  
---
Now I can go on for a long time about balance and how crap BHVR is at doing that, but my main point is that there is no way that in 2 weeks Ghost face will be in mid-tier. So people should stop using it as an excuse for BHVR for putting out a killer in this bad of a state.
---
Didn't need to know that but k lol.  Could've just  said you were busy.
---
I think it's because the killer is the host disconnects will usually be their fault, where as survivors could be dced for any number of reasons.
---
That being said, I hate the practice of dcing to save valuable items. Just suck up the loss.
---
It used to be that way but it was a one time use
---
I mean, can’t hurt to do a shot out. Idk many spirit mains, but you claim they’re one of the best, so I figure you could help this guy out.
---
Poor new man, she's my favorite pokemon!
---
Yeah I like the outfit as a whole, hair aside
---
The hair would be fine if the texturing on it didn’t look so weird and blocky
---
Why does nea look so cute in this picture?
---
When they use all the fountains you get Corrupt Purge automatically
---
Explain to me how trapper can injure me 5-10 seconds into a chase though? Only way he can do this is with a preset trap, which get disarmed and aren't really reliable
---
Otherwise do not compare not healing against Legion for not healing against Trapper
---
Nah. a great deal of people would, but some would survive. Especially people with training and experience in that sort of field.
---
Because Carl is a precious man and I need to protect him.
---
Public TEST Build/Beta
---
So they DO lose their item and add ons? With how often that it happens, you wouldn’t have guessed that they do.
---
Mew, excuse mew. And I changed all of my autocorrect to cat puns. So you is mew. Person is purrson, things like that.
---
No one cares. 
---
Don’t be a dick.
---
No, it isn't. He's pretty fucking awful.
---
That was still only when unhooking someone else
---
I should've predicted the ending sooner. This is definitely a sound and accurate documentary.
---
I’d understand fair rotations but for most of the time it’s ruin alongside it which while it’s unfun it is needed due to gens going too fast. I guess the point I’m trying to make is yes it does have counterplay but most of the time you don’t know the killer even has it until you’re already downed and on hook most of the time.
---
Very cool.
---
I'm laughing so hard haha
---
Plunderers plus ace in the hole makes it super easy to get items and add ons. Killers dont have anything like that so they have to rely on the bloodweb
---
It was a different time.
---
No it isn't? Just don't down that survivor for 45 seconds.
---
Until I get my hands on the data I do not trust the numbers the developers provide. 
---
They have proven in the past to give misleading numbers with poor explanations in an attempt to make things look better for themselves.
---
They actually are rank 20s players. Not even one side or another but in general.. I mean, one of the level designer was a waiter before that job.. (his words not mine)
---
At that point won't surprise me if someone on this sub itself would make a better job (you know.. knowing the game and actually caring)
---
Luckily we can all play Civilization V in the spare time if something goes wrong
---
Well that kinda depends on the game and the person. Personally I don't care for achievements with no reward afterwards (no I don't count bragging rights as a true reward because who really cares?). But if I got an achievement and unlocked something for it (like an item, ability, or anything special/new) then I'd feel like my hard work actually paid off.
---
I read it wrong, sorry. I was thinking mew were saying that the purrson unhooking should be affected as well
---
Preach!
---
The way I can view it as an immunity perk is a situation like this. I was playing on Crotus Prenn as Billy, 
---
I hooked an Ash and moved to the other side of the map. I proceeded to chase and down a Claudette and hook her. Naturally during this time Ash was unhooked and I saw him heading towards the Claudette he just hooked. Now, for this next portion I am fully accepting responsibility for not recognizing an obvious bait at the time. Ash proceeds to lose a loop and get downed, I pick him up, DS procs, he unhooks Claudette, and they proceed to beeline for the exit gates. 
---
In its current state it is a very effective anti-tunneling perk. When used in a manner like what was described, it becomes an immunity perk which can reward incredibly sloppy plays that would not work otherwise. I’ve had this situation play multiple times over because I don’t want to slug people and count to 60. That is unsatisfying gameplay for myself and the survivor. I’d rather just eat the DS and keep going with the match even if it has cost me kills/downs in doing so.
---
You ok bud?
---
If mew dont heal against a trapper, hell quickly down mew. If mew dont heal against a legion, hell quickly down mew. mew clearly haven't played against any good legions
---
I like the idea of stopping the timer while you're on the ground. If that's your idea I agree with it, I'm not sure why the comments don't.
---
I always feel like it's cooler to name them as bad movie one-liners
---
I'll be completely honest. I really don't want to continue arguing. It stresses me out and neither of us will change. But anyways..
---
You're 100% right. DbD has gotta be one of the hardest games to balance for all the reasons you listed. Still think that they should try their best, there is no other game as asymmetrical and successful as DbD right now. They're treading new ground and it's still a fun game that usually isn't entirely unbalanced so they're doing something right.
---
Your overwatch paragraph is silly. Yes overwatch is balanced differently, and you even explained why DbD isn't balanced the same way, so I don't know why you brought it up. CSGO is constantly balanced and isn't like OW but that works for that game. BHVR is working the best they can and will only get better with time, the game is fairly balanced as is, but some things need to change and I believe they can do it.
---
I define winning as pipping or getting a fuckton of Blood Points. But that doesn't mean I want them to balance around BP. The devs have decided that pipping is a very important part of the game, so they should focus on that. And there is a win/lose screen. Entity Disappointed/Ruthless Killer, also the game literally tells you if you did good enough to pip every round, so if that isn't a win/lose screen I don't know what you want.
---
And I still won't say that killing one person is fulfilling your role since you can kill them all, a d the goal is to kill the survivors, not survivor.
---
And I know argument work like that. That's why I tried to stop it like an hour ago.
---
Also you didnt responded to one thing. I said that the Ranking system exists to play people around the same skill level, the very first thing you commented.
---
A bug huh? I'll bet money that it was an actual feature, but after being called out on how stupid it is now they wanna call it a bug.
---
I'll level my Quentin for this I got lots of teachables
---
No I'm just checking if I can post on reddit that's it
---
Betting my Jerma bucks on that. I think it'll be Yikes.
---
That's hella aggressive, David's Russian cousin.
---
Proof that they don't test their shit properly.
---
Thaanks me too
---
Having met the developers of Last Year I can't say they're good devs. 
---
They seems completely unable to take criticism or think about obvious problems their game clearly had at launch.
---
There has been no communication since the only patch they pushed out and the game can be safely assumed to be dead.
---
Personally I disagree with Huntress.  I feel like she's pretty easy to escape from in red ranks with a few people who know what's what.
---
Billy though.  He's always rough
---
Then it sounds like you have a self-fulfilling prophecy to me.
---
THEY COULD'VE HAD ELIGOS OR DEADITE LINDA BE ASHES KILLER. HELL DEADITE LINDA IS THE REASON ASH ENDED UP IN THE ENTITIES REALM IN THE FIRST PLACD
---
So instead of the PTB, there was a 2 year testing period? Or, what?
---
Probably some of the dumbest shit ive heard for ds. Good one.
---
For rock solid, what's the maximum tokens?
---
clearly you have never played legion so...
---
Cute
---
Sad but cute
---
Billy gets looped, you can't loop a good spirit.
---
He almost looks like Jeff in the Rob zombie remakes
---
:D
---
Tattoos are permanent, just throwin that out there.
---
My legions 50... I've played legion, and its incredibly easy to 4k without ever touching your power. It would be a million times easier to 4k if they all did what you're saying and never healed. I'm a rank 8-10 killer on average
---
Bad connection, happens to me all the time.
---
You know i hate to beat a dead horse, but if you cleanse the totem you dont have issues. Or if you just leave not just hang around the map.
---
Go watch a video. In Monto's video he doesn't get his stalk off ONCE.
---
Proof:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMvQQDFN3eU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMvQQDFN3eU)
---
&gt;  I'm a rank 8-10 killer on average
---
Lol, that explains it then
---
I think you wrote in the wrong sub
---
If not I would make a statue for you and ask you trying to be the next Pope
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
That's Gnarly.
---
Sorry I dont want to play against toxic squadette every other game... I've reached rank 1 survivor and killer a few times. The game is nothing but hour long wait times and toxic players there. I'd rather play with the part of the community that wants to just have fun, not be assholes
---
Really? That surprises me.
---
Huntress has a higher skill floor/skill ceiling, not a lot of people play her enough and the newer maps are rough for her. 
---
When played to their full potential, Huntress will outclass him against good survivors.
---
In a hand-to-hand, it might be even.  The only way I can imagine her taking down large predators and soldiers is through ambush tactics.
---
I usually see at least one Ash per game.
---
I guess in that sense you could see it as one but at the same time, is adrenaline and immunity perk? Is dead or other exhaustion perks immunity perks?
---
Just had to post that you are spot on. Any killer can absolutely wreck a bad team. A decent team with or without SWF on the other hands wipes the floor with below mid tier killers. Especially if the killer is running BP perks as most players tend to.
---
YOU MEAN NERF THE FUCK OUT OF THEM, THEN IGNORE IT FOR 2 YEARS, THEN PROMISE A "WE ARE THINKING OF POWER X, Y, AND Z FOR HIM", WHEN ALL HE WILL END UP GETTING IS A SHITTIER VERSION OF ONE OF THEM INSTEAD OF BEING USEFUL.
---
She can puke on generators, kinda forcing you to wait 20 seconds before you can work on it again. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, it’s just annoying. Same for sick survivors, you’re kinda forced to get sick by unhooking them.
---
Is that comment to me? Kinda unclear who that's towards.
---
?
---
It's Jake.
---
Its 25 sacrifices i believe, of the 4 original survivors. Thats how i did it, pretty sure mori don't count.
---
Self Care is ew, really?
---
Sorry for the big file size. I don't usually like Steampunk and sometimes I'm not a big fan of the skins, but these have a lot to them and they kinda fit a cool them of David and Jake from another age (which makes me drool fanfic-wise)! For a moment I thought the second welder on the splash art was a lady but maybe we'll get more of these (we do already kind of have Lady Hag from a similar/the same era of I'm not mistaken). The items also work pretty well on their own (they're not huge changes but they're certainly worth more than some of the simpler taller/less hair skins) . Anyways blah blah blah. Great job, DBD team!
---
Don't forget he made a Scream waaaaay before the speculation stuff even started and it is not too far off.
---
Except Spirit *wasn't* fixed on the PTB, her major changes came right before Legion. She was D tier on the PTB, and only moved up to C with the post-beta changes. She's A tier now because she's been getting buff after buff every patch, though I'm hardly complaining.
---
Plague is an M1 killer since people know the best counter to her power is to just never cleanse. Purge still completely decimates console framerates, though I don't have first hand experience there. She's not terrible, but she's not fun either.
---
Clown was balanced on release; he didn't even need major changes out of the PTB other than bug fixes. Also, people realized he has poor map pressure on release, it was just expected at this point. BHVR will never release another killer like Nurse or Billy that excels in map pressure AND chase.
---
I really do hope they fix Ghostface, but I'm not going to put money on it, especially since the Freddy rework is supposed to be coming.
---
I have DBD for PS4 also, and its so much better on PC...look into one of those programmable controllers like razor or nacon...they may have the ability to add macros for struggle
---
Lucky we have wow classic this summer
---
Such as?
---
I can't find a reason for her to be annoying, to each their own then.
---
Builds for Spirit :
---
Hex:Ruin, Barbecue and Chilli, A Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher.
---
Hex:Ruin, Surveillance, A Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker.
---
Rancor, Save The Best For Last, Hex:Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
A Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker, Hex:The Third Seal, Hex:Haunted Ground.
---
Hex:Devour Hope, Hex:Haunted Ground, Hex:NOED, Make Your Choice.
---
As add-ons, there are some combos :
---
Cheap add-ons combos : try to use just speed or charge time add-ons, like Zori + Gifted Bamboo Comb or Muddy Sports Day Cap + White Hair Ribbon or even stacks speed ( Zori + Muddy Sports Day Cap ) or charge time ( Gifted Bamboo Comb + White Hair Ribbon ).
---
Expensive add-ons combos : again, speed and charge time are very good, like Dirty Uwabaki + Bloody Hair Brooch or even Mother Daughter Ring + Bloody Hair Brooch, then charge time + reappearance duration and speed ( Bloody Hair Brooch + Wakizashi Saya ), "Classic Spirit" is not too bad ( Yakuyoke Amulet + Wakizashi Saya ) or even "invisible Billy" ( Mother Daughter Ring + Yakuyoke Amulet ) can be a good choice. 
---
Try to use more her brown and yellow add-ons in your regular matches and use her green/purple/red add-ons just when you face a SWF team with 4 Toolboxes or if you really want to try hard.
---
The bdud or whatever.
---
NEW TACTIC I FOUND OUT VERY USEFUL FOR GOING AGAINST THOSE PESKY CLAUDETTES! RUN SCRATCH MIRROR MICHAEL WITH LETTER FOR LUNG AND BURN THE COLDWIN MAP OFFERING, THEY WONT KNOW WHAT HIT THEM! I USED BBQ,SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST, RUIN, PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD.
---
How would that solve the problem as you posted it though? What actual differences in the match would there be between the survivor just doing the instant face plant or the entity grabbing the survivor?
---
Maybe you shouldn't.
---
I played against a Wraith who destroyed us in the hospital. Was fun to play against cuz he had the perfect add-on and perks
---
In pasties
---
Wll, I did it in the right sub so...when can I start?
---
Honestly annoys me when they just wait for the timer to run and then just pick you up. Also annoyed me when people would dribble the surv to the hook
---
STEAM AND/OR OFFICIAL FORUMS ARE THAT WAY ---&gt;
---
POST ANYTHING PRO KILLER THERE AND GET TORN TO SHREDS.
---
I kind of like the idea, but it still presents the problem, though it would allow more bloodpoints for killers. I saw this a while bavk(cant remember if it was a comment or a post), but survivors who DC are left in the dying state until they either bleed put or are hooked. Maybe their auras could even be revealed to the killer as if it's a map wide deersralker on that survivor specifically. That means they'd technically still be in the game until they bleed out, and mew could find the hatch or the other survivor first
---
Please message us in 50 years of how badly you regret your decision.  yikes lol
---
You should level up Dwight for Bond, you really shouldn't waste shards for this perk when it's already on a free character. But, Decisive Strike is worth if you don't have Laurie.
---
Thanks!
---
The only time I remember them hotfixing a ptb was the Clown and the Spirit. Odds are they are going to wait until it goes to live to show off their supposed bug fixes, and when most people are ultimately still disappointed they'll take weeks to months more for extra hotfixes.
---
Very select few, if I were to estimate I would assume no more than a few ten thousand would be able to survive, especially if we are to assume they are entering the trial with no knowledge as to what’s going on.
---
idk i mean it gives both the survivor and the killer extra bps if the killer scores a hit at the end and the survivor escapes
---
But they are purposely making a weak killer?
---
It's mediocre because there are better perks, not for that.
---
Well I mean, he ain't wrong. I dont know what you're saying.
---
No survivor or map.
---
It mildly infuriates me how he spells ''sacrifice''.
---
Until you realize that one person cannot physically ambush several people as an ambush is a surprise attack. Kind of hard to ambush soldiers since they usually travel in groups. Also, animals of a larger size require serious brute strength to take down and she's been doing that her while life. She is easily stronger than David, who is a drunk whose rugby career ended almost immediately, regardless of how proficient he may have been at it.
---
Im the 2nd panel guy
---
The DC is not an instant removal from the game anymore, it will actually play a sacrifice animation for a while, THEN the survivor is removed, and the hatch spawns/opens. Just like as if you hooked the survivor, instead of an instant removal.
---
I hope they fix Nea's green hair with the clipping and bald spots.
---
I would argue that they should have known his power was bad from just a few hours of internal testing.
---
What do you mean? There's 4 other survivors in the match, I assume one of them saved this person you could go after them.
---
If you've been downed you're likely going to get hooked, and be able to use your perk. That shouldn't be negated by the killer just wait X amount of seconds.
---
Who even complains about ds anymore? The perk is god awful now
---
I'm a former survivor main, more 50/50 now. I noticed that, for me anyway, the differnt que times fluctuate bassed on time of day. Early mornings are impossible to find a match as killer, but survivor is easy.
---
Afternoons mean each takes about 30 seconds to a minute.
---
Praise Jeff!
---
Ok then
---
I personally believe that the game should not be balanced at all. The killer should always have the advantage. You shouldn't be playing this game as a survivor because you want to gang up on a killer. The point of the game is to "get scared" and escape. Theres a reason in all those movies there's typically 1 maybe 2 survivors. However it being a video game it shouldn't be so heavily 1 sided that survivors never escape. But there should be an average of 1 survivor escaping a match. Every survivor should get bonus bp for spectating to the end of a round and an extra bonus for each survivor that escapes if they spectate. Survivors should also still be able to pip even if they didnt escape. You shouldn't be punished for doing well but still dieing. At the end of the day the survivors dont have a game without killers. Good killers are the only reason survivors come back for more. Killers should be the #1 priority for BHVR and time and time again they have proven to care very little about killers. And continue to cater to the survivors. Killers should be both fun to play and compelling and competative to play against. I wish this game was better but every time try and come back it's the exact same problems.
---
I guess you could say David king is a coolsexhaver
---
Where’s his trashcan and can he sneak in it Solid Snake style or must he drag it next to him to make it harder for him to hide behind things cuz perma-crouch/Oddjob Oddvantage?
---
Same. Not at high ranks though.
---
Also he should be able to eat trash to heal.
---
Ghostface isn't like that in Scream, however r
---
I see so many Lauries and Adams. All the time.
---
You're missing my point then, I compared it to overwatch because it's a competitive game and from the sound if it your trying to argue that it can still be competitive which it could be but it'll take a few more years before it can fit into the competitive genre and while they may be trying their hardest it doesn't help them that they wait until long amounts of time before releasing patches as they make one major update between chapters which isn't good enough when you put into perspective considering some mid season patches don't change a lot.
---
And yes while you're goal is to kill as many survivors as possible it still doesn't mean that getting less then 4 kills is a loss.
---
The ranking system us flawed for many reasons, one being long queue times, if you get to rank 1 what do you get besides a long wait time, when they give players a reason for wanting to get to rank 1 one of two things will happen 1) more people will try to get to rank one therefore minimising queue times and therefore increasing the health of the game or 2) it won't be enough to get people to care and the same problems that occur now will still exist then.
---
If you don't like arguing then why bother responding to my comment, because it's always the person that chooses to reply to comments that instigate these arguments but feel free to stop anytime I don't care, I enjoy discussing game balance.
---
Well let’s see there is billy/leather face chainsaw hits don’t count, the plagues spit, hatchets from huntress, traps from the trapper, tier 3 Myers is only one tocken when exposed. Haunting ground, no Ed, make your choice all one shots. It’s changed now for the better In the PTB im just waiting for killer mains to be mad about it now lol
---
You bet!! Any questions, don’t hesitate to ask—my inbox is always open. 
---
(Side note: the phasing sound outside the TR is why **Prayer Beads** is such an incredible add on—it removes the phasing sound entirely!)
---
As i always say, only the stupid ones teabag.
---
Oh ok thanks a lot I’ll try to level her now, she really OP I’ve been winning all my matches so far
---
I need this and he has to be able to yell: “Charlie!?” “Deandra!?” “Dennis!?” and maybe just frown for Mac. Instead of pointing he has to pull his revolver.
---
You know this might actually be funny if you had instead of survivors it’s the cast in any of the scream movies. I don’t know but there might actually be a movie scene where ghost face runs for any reason. Then you need to show him being consumed by the entity.
---
Kinda wish they where both wearing backless pants.
---
Probably Clown tbh, judging by the stats Bheaviour released a while ago.
---
Just why.
---
When you say “opposite Freddy” wdym? Because if you mean the infamous Freddy “nerf” I want to have a discussion.
---
There are tons of custom ones out there. I specifically have Giestra's, which you can find on their Twitter page.
---
But it is a test.  They only have a handful of people internally able to test stuff before it's released.  It's to test it with a significant number of people for more data.  It's no different than a beta test, it effectively is, just for DLC.
---
Im sorry man. All we do is report them and hope they get banned.
---
And you got your second stack! Noice! 😂
---
it be like that
---
Make this with Jane! Or I will!
---
that's what i dislike about bhvr, they have such a weird way of doing hotfix/patch related stuff.
---
I made this so you guys can get creative with the perks haha, make him do whatever you want him to do!
---
A smaller force can ambush a larger force with no problem. That’s how the Revolutionary War was won. Guerrilla tactics are about invalidating enemy advantages. 
---
If you can get the drop on a bear with a large ax, you just need a good hit or two. Or, you throw axes into it until its too wounded to fight back. 
---
There’s possibilities.
---
I'm confused on the Enduring perk change. Did they make you recover faster? (1.14 seconds to 1) Or not?
---
What kind of?
---
They can't change much (since the release date is set on stone and they have to send the patch a week beforehand for consoles licenses)
---
At least they could if they had a decent amount of man power to make quick changes or decent play testers (inside not ptb) and not apes. So they would change some numbers
---
Change just few numbers won't change much about the whole design of the character, so I don't know. I didn't got much hyper after the leaks came out because we are talking about BHVR, the ones who tucked up the maps, killers, mechanics and the game itself many times
---
Recent history? Look at pig now or the useless vault change as band-aid so they don't had to actually fix the broken structures so better add vault changes instead, it's easier than have a decent level design
---
So idk, we'll see
---
"Look guys, I am an asshole to my team mates, I am so funny XDXDXD"
---
He no longer uses a phone, it's a camera now.
---
In scream 1 the 2 guys are bumbling psychopaths who are constantly tripping, falling, and all around getting their shit rocked by their prey. Watch it again and you’ll see.
---
Of course. Just like everyone wore back then. Obviously cuz it was cheaper and cooler and I was going to say cuz no air conditioning but looks like they had that in 1902: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning
---
True, she didn't do jack shit in the film
---
**Air conditioning**
---
Air conditioning (often referred to as AC, A/C, or air con) is the process of removing heat and moisture from the interior of an occupied space, to improve the comfort of occupants.  Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and other animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool/dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as computer servers, power amplifiers, and even to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork.
---
Air conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an occupied space such as a building or a car to improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality.

Today a well cooperated swf broke my ruin and fixed all gens in less than 10 minutes. Whether you're a killer main or a survivor main doesn't matter. Gen rushing is a problem. Playing without ruin is literally suicide. I play both sides so I'm not really biased but I don't see the point in gens being fixed this fast. Imo, if survivors rush gens, they're asking for noed. Noed usually secures only 1 extra kill though, which could have been prevented if all totems were cleansed. Noed does not have to be changed, the mindset of the survivors has to be changed. And I'm well aware as a survivor that when all gens are fixed at least one more survivors will bite the dust unless I break dull totems.
---
neither has a bra/bro tho so it’s not a total waste...
---
Nurse didn't think she'd even Coby in the first place so she was dumbfounded.
---
Hey, is it possible to do a comparison for Nea’s hair? I don’t have access to the PTB. :(
---
Honestly I sometimes wish this game was structured like a 'killer is a dm' situation.
---
Instead of a pebble play, he can drop a wad of hundreds and a magnum condom for his monster dong to distract the female killers. For the Males he can give them an egg in their trying times when getting looped.
---
Thank youuuu!
---
THE WAY THE FUCKING CHECK MARKS DON'T GO THE WAY YOU EXPECT THEM TO IT SO UNSATISFYING
---
Rank 9
---
Truth be told, the only reason I'm not mad at his chainsaw penalty is because that's how he is in the movie. So points for sticking true to the character.
---
Maybe they should make it so DS deactivates if another survivor gets downed?
---
&gt; not be able to bully them
---
Define bullying.  If it's anything to do with a Survivor purposely making it more difficult for you to kill them (looping, flashlights, sabo'ing hooks, stunning you with pallets, etc.), that's not bullying, that's a Survivor playing smart.  
---
If it's anything to do with a Survivor "BM"'ing by spamming crouch or purposely trying to mess with you in other means, that's not bullying, that's simply a Survivor trying to mentally tilt you so you don't perform as well.  That's something people will do in any PvP game, whether it's spam /laughing at your corpse in WoW or spamming a taunt/joke emote in LoL.  
---
Post-game chat is also easily ignored and a Killer can simply disconnect/quit before even seeing it.  
---
The only way players could truly fear "all killers" is if this became like Friday the 13th where the Killers just get to insta-kill everyone they grab.
---
EXACTLY. That is how ghost face is in the game though; terrible, sloppy, gets looped for a year...
---
We are just a bit more vocal
---
Staying away from you
---
Monstrosity? I thought she was just "balanced?"
---
The force behind the Evil Dead franchise is revealed to be a woman “technically an ancient demon” in the Ash Vs. Evil Dead tv show. So unfortunately no.

Even if you only want the killer it's better to wait for those sales, they make a full chapter purchase cheaper than buying 500 auric cells.

17th tattoo, all mean something to ME. Won't regret/haven't regretted a single one. Go preach your beliefs to someone else who might care.

Spirit fury enduring will like a word with you about billy getting looped.

Thrilling Tremors + Pop Goes The Weasel. Thank me later.

Thanks for the help

oooo touchy touchy.  probably a sign you're gonna care later on.

The campfire is outside the exit gates.
---
Someone posted something similar. I said it there and I'll say it here: 
---
I feel the only people who have a valid, unbiased opinion are those who are well versed in both sides.
---
4D chess
---
I can’t testify to that because i havent played him yet, but lmao yeah it’s kind of shocking how much he sucks in the 1st movie.
---
You also need to realise that these are the same people that thought Freddy and Legion were in a good enough state to release.
---
And with how self congratulatory that 3rd anniversary stream was one hoped they got their shit together.
---
They have not.
---
In the slightest.
---
Some context: Guy was a huntress with major lag the whole time. I got disconnected about 5 mins into game, sent him this message and that was his response.
---
They also view it as some sort of personal attack too. Like damn calm down they realize he is underpowered and even if he comes out still like that, they are going to fix it.
---
Plenty of Killers do the same thing, this is not limited to Survivors only. Just wanted to point that out.
---
One of possibly two?  :-D
---
Why so many downvoted? I was just asking if the ship was confirmed ;-;
---
Easy fix : survivors needs to look more at him to break him out of his stealth, no sounds while he is in Night Shroud, immunity against detection perks in Night Shroud and increases his duration for exposed status to 30 seconds. 
---
Tru3 also had a interesting idea for a buff to Ghostface, but I can't remember it. Right now, Ghostface is, even without bugs, just a discount Myers and Pig. Everything he can do, Myers and Pig will do it much better and more efficient, his stalk is weaker than Myers stalk, his mind game potential with crouching is weaker than Pig's mind game potential with crouching and Ambush attack and his stealth is weaker than both, Myers and Pig's stealth.
---
He’s clearly joking
---
Camping is only infuriating because if you “let” (you have no other choice) the survivor die on hook you lose points; If a survivor gets hooked but doesn’t get unhooked, even if it’s you, you’ll lose points. It’s a load of shit.
---
SOMEDAY THAT'LL BE AN OPTION FOR ME. I'M GOING TO LOVE THAT.    THANK YOU.   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I only want white Claudette, the other 2 originals survivors are ugly in my opinion.
---
Honestly looking at Ghost face should speed up the stalking time
---
I did it once...
---
No judging other redditors.
---
You all queue at the exact same time.
---
Her power is fine, though people complain. That much is balanced. But her passive phasing, lack of window vault animation, and in particular her Prayer Beads add-on are all absolutely awful mechanics that make for extremely unfun games with her. 
---
But outside of those, I personally love her as a killer and think people complaining that her power is 100% a "guessing game" are just overly whining. Killers, Spirits included, move in patternous, "optimal" manners. You can play around that and condition their reactions passed that. Even with just her active power alone however, I admit she's still be super strong.
---
Dc? This isn't about DC punishments, even though they should exist.
---
You all have to play lets que at the same time game. Or do survive with friends.
---
First off block usernames. No name shaming, even if said player is a complete fucking prick. 
---
Second I’m pretty sure you can just send that straight to the devs as he’s pretty much confessed that he’s cheating. Not sure why he would admit to that, what a dumbass.
---
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
---
I just think the texture with the hair looks weird.
---
Would be interesting if his crouch activated a 3rd person perspective for killer that shifted back to first person when he stood back up. The increased field of view would make him a very unique killer in that regard. Don’t think it would offset his other issues though.
---
I’m not trying to cheat or anything, I just want a good competitive game against friends whilst also gaining bloodpoints to level up
---
Yeah...
---
Your suggestion doesn’t make sense bro. I’m not even sure what ur trying to say in this post tbh.
---
DC is way worse dude
---
If you complain about camping in this game you might be around rank 20 to 13 at best. If they camp they lose, if you die but did enough you pip anyway.
---
This isn't cod, camping isn't rewarded at all
---
Then try to all queue at the same time...
---
Preach, past 3 killers have been weak and disappointments. I’ll get Ghostface for the perks but otherwise he ain’t that good.
---
B-b-b-b-but I heard people from Reddit saying that Pig will get rekt from Ghostface when he comes out, what changed your mind :) ?
---
That person can't wiggle for shit
---
How do you report it?
---
&gt; Any M1 killer is a jester ready to entertain.
---
So a majority of them.
---
Instead if this, I suggest adding a new item, a fire starter. And make all bonfires not burning. But when using the item, it lights the bonfire and within it's light you get extra heal speed and you can self heal 50% of the heal bar until it prompts you to get help. I think that would be way more fair and a cool mechanic so the killer has something else to look for other than gens. Also if you stay in the basement for more than 20 seconds you'll get exposed (shortens timer with territorial imperative)
---
HE IS A BHVR ORIGINAL CHARACTER ALL ONLY LICENSED PART IS THE MASK
---
Yeah even if this a joke. If you send this to the devs they probably will ban him for like 1 day.
---
That doesn’t work for me, we ready up and they do not get put into a game for a while, when they do it’s not me(I get randoms). Were the same killer / survivor rank too so idk why it’s not working?
---
That doesn’t seem like a joke to me at all, actually.
---
Bond is one of the best perks in the ga.e if your going solo. Empathy works on a Medic/Bodyguard build.
---
THAT WOULD BE PRETTY AWESOME.  MAYBE WORK SOMETHING IN SO SHE APPEARS TO BE A SURVIVOR FOR A SHORT TIME AS IF SHE WASN'T A DEADITE.  YOU CAN BECOME EACH SURVIVOR ONCE FOR A SHORT TIME TO GET CLOSE TO THEM.
---
Ever hear of shadow play?
---
It is a test but they also have internal testers, and it feels the testers said “he’s good” once they got him and just threw him into the world.
---
Idk. Probably because thats not how it is intended ti be used
---
so you basically want DS to have no counter + i think survivors have enough time to pick you up. the only change i'll like for DS is the time to stop when you are in a chase because sometimes you're forced to play poorly so you can benefit from DS, which it's stupid. but otherwise, DS it's great in its current state, even stronger than before
---
😂😂
---
I NEED TO SEE THIS DO YOU HAVE A LINK AND THEY ARE BUFFING WINDOWS FINALLYYYYY
---
Noed is a punishment for genrushing, not only baby killers but experienced killers like to use it. It is very strong but so are certain survivor perks. People will not leave the game if noed gets nerfed, BHVR does not earn money just because this perk is in the game. It does sound like you just had a very fun noed experience though. Don't worry, you can't always win. As a good killer and survivor you should know that. Don't forget to cleanse totems, you know that cleansing totems is a hard counter for noed and that killers use noed because survivors don't cleanse totems.
---
Impressive Strength would just f\*ck you if the killer is running Enduring.
---
No, plague also get a fix just the next month after the ptb release and the chapter comming live
---
Nah, I even waited on a hill, doing nothing, or I hit the generator to signalise them that they can work on them. No, the killer cannot always end the game. How am I supposed to end the game within three minutes when I am unable to find them? Looking through every single locker? Don't act as though it's possible to always know where the survivors are. So yeah, they were essentially holding the game hostage by refusing to work on a generator. What am I supposed to do? Not monitor the generators? Where else should the survivors be? You are only picking the side of the survivors without considering the point of view of a killer. 
---
At this point, I didn't care if they were to escape, I just wanted the game to end without having to disconnect.
---
For example, when there are two survivors left in the match, one survivor will DC to give the other the hatch, making it open instantly without giving the killer any time to react, especially with swf.
---
This just gives killers time to react to the game changes when one survivor is removed from the match by DC'ing, instead of it being instant. 
---
So that survivors can't exploit DC to instantly open the hatch. 
---
...also the animation is cool, I'd wanna see more of it.
---
His power sucks
---
Well its random so you might get your friends you might not. Just play SWF.
---
I should've, I deserved to get flamed for this
---
Ah okay. Yeah those are all pretty good.
---
I keep trying to pull myself away from Deer Stalker because it honestly only came up once in every three games when I was trying to use it though maybe I was slugging wrong. It's less about being blind (survivors are near enough impossible to see to begin with) and more about putting up your volume and meticulously searching, which is only worth it after there's no-one to chase.
---
I might try Thrill, I just discounted it because it's a detection perk without aura.
---
Yeap.
---
This will probably cause a delay for the live build but if you had to keep him in the center of your screen for a full second then it would be fine, that would eliminate the spinning screen problem and keep him in line with what they are going for.
---
Honestly, I could have slugged one, but I already knew the last person wouldn't have helped them and wasted our time once again.
---
I mean like he isn’t the most powerful but one of the most powerful.
---
I’m not buying ghostface either way
---
What do you mean? Whats affecting BHVRS killer making?
---
I mean, I guess? I don’t really see the explicit need for it personally, but I also don’t feel like it would hurt anything. And I also like the animation so there’s that.
---
I know Bond's better but I just don't care for it tbh
---
I want the original survivors to be skins of what survivor they represent. I demand a Jake gangster skin!
---
HOW DARE YOU PUT THE BEST SURVIVOR F TIER!
---
Pfft, I'd rather have 4 fengs in a match than a single nea. But I guess some people can't stand ultrasound, weaklings
---

I really don't care for NOED, I just felt like putting something
---
Survivors with hex perks? Don't know why but I kinda like the sound of that.
---
The second their camera panned over him
---
Thriving and stable: Have the best perks (not all of them, but most)
---
Slightly at risk: People play them just because they are sexualised
---
Vulnerable: Huge, easy to see (Jake is my main)
---
Endangered: The only "hard" survivors
---
Near Extinct: Useless perks/useless perks and ugly/too loud
---
Gonna be honest, even if the PTB is the test. They should test him themselves some before releasing it to be tested publicly.
---
 But also I guess a shit ton of people are also more likely to break something
---
People are down voting but you're telling the truth.
---
I unironically want that weird "Proto-Meg".
---
https://imgur.com/a/mS5XBkS Another image of Proto-Meg and Proto-Claudette. (Didn't proto-meg have a unique name or something at one point?)
---
I sort of wish they could be added to the game but as original characters. Proto-Meg could be that Nikki mentioned in the Hope perk flavor text, etc.
---
Plague - GREAT idea for a killer.  Execution - meh
---
Ghostface - no thought behind the killer needed.  Execution - god awful
---
At this point, just release new perks.  Screw new killers if they're going to be done this poorly,
---
Does Spirit count?
---
That's not how it works.
---
The killer should be placed on the PTB when the developers have finished with them, to see how they perform in a live environment.
---
They should then make balancing tweaks based on feedback/general consensus from the community.
---
You do not release a completely broken killer on the PTB just 2 weeks before release.
---
I think you're exaggerating the difficulty of cleansing totems. It's not that hard to do if you actually focus on it.
---
Totems are always one of my top priorities in games and I rarely have problems, even against red-rank killers.
---
That being said, NOED is still very powerful, especially on maps like Lery's or The Game where totems are in obscure places.
---
PTB = Public Test Beta
---
Beta, as in not an Alpha.
---
So they tested this in Alpha and said this is okay?
---
I love it
---
Somebody farming by unhooking right in front of killer makes me insecure??
---
Nah bro. Chasing the poor guy getting farmed instead of punishing the douche farmer makes you an insecure killer.  Truth.
---
Why not make it so that the timer stops when downed? I feel like that'd be enough of a buff.
---
Oh gens do go crazy fast I can’t deny that but I was more pointing towards killers that don’t get any downs or hooks all game then slug at the end with the perk and end up with the 4k. Ds used to give players a free escape for doing pretty much nothing and that was very unfair. So why is a free down seen any different?
---
Somehow I feel like this post is about more than just the animation.
---
Nice outfit. Did your husband make it for you?
---
After I get all the teachable perks, you know I’m going back to Bill.
---
That is what I'm saying

Nah, just tired of a handful of you "Tattoos are forever you know? You're gonna regret it". Obviously didn't read WHY I got it. I'll tell you things I have regretted, cutting my long hair, not going Tai Kwon Do when I was a kid, and spending money on some shitty mobile game called Pokemon Go. But getting a tattoo and having a reason to get it that I hold near and dear to my heart. Not going to regret it. I've gotten HUNDREDS of positive and happy responses. Just a handful of lame responses like yours, you just so happened to be the one that annoyed me the most. My feelings don't get hurt by strangers who have NO clue what they're talking about and only make pathetic assumptions.
---
&gt;We'd love to address everything as soon as possible, but sometimes we don't get the chance to squeeze everything in before an update.

they're making excuses for a fumbled release already.

No I want Kate, not Trapper

Only someone who doesn't play DBD wouldn't understand this.

---
Oh don’t worry it won’t be. They just won’t give it to us at all.
---
In a 2 survivor situation, as soon as you try to commit to chasing and downing one (or the other has found the hatch), they will instantly DC, and the other will get the hatch for free. It just doesn't let the survivors get the hatch guarenteed. 
---
Sorry I worded it so weirdly.
---
Install MLGA (Optional)
---
Make a lobby as a killer. Measure the time it takes you to get survivors. Dodge. Start a new lobby and start a timer. tell your friends to queue around 5 seconds before that. Repeat until you land at eachother.
---
(if MLGA was installed and used) then mark eachother as LOVED
---
Body camp?
---
Seems pretty accurate.
---
Welp, since it doesn't appear he is going to help you out, guess I'll try then. Though fair warning, I don't play spirit for a reason and that's because I suck with her. 
---
I don't have much, but I'll share what I got.  
---
There is really 2 ways to play spirit, either gen lock or map pressure. Personally, I like gen lock. 
---
Spirit mainly excels with mind games. If someone is looping you, try to phase and appear where they are going to be. It's also nice to appear on a gen somewhere is working at and then you just pluck them off of it.
---
We need Bill representation. Good.
---
Maybe they should come up with a mode for it to be more horror and scary, and like less looping
---
All of them have physics, including Nea’s dreads
---
I’m on PS4, but I will try that right now, thank you
---
Plague's framerate is still fucked on PS4
---
Tons of times I've played normally, didn't tunnel, still called a tunneler.
---
It's a nice, realistic feature but i'm gonna miss everyone's faces :(
---
I’ve had friends banned for the prestige glitch, never seen another dbd ban. Just the psn ones for those delightful post game messages.
---
That’s her before the green flu
---
It will still have a counter. It's called not tunneling. Also, from what I've seen, I havent seen any surv pick up another until after 2 mins of them being downed.
---
&gt; Last Year - I can't tell you exactly what it was. Maybe lack of balance. Maybe the fact that they launched on Discord. Or lack of a progression system. Maybe all of it combined, but the end result is there is about 5 people playing the game at any given time.
---
Last Year had most of the DBD crowd checking it out during beta or whatever, but yeah... it basically had 0 presence after that.  Maybe if it had launched on Steam it'd be a different story.
---
Lol camping pallets vs spirit
---
it'd serve the same purpose as DS, but with less time and unlimited use ON TOP of being able to use it on others. most people would stop running it with "I might save someone" in mind and start with "It'll save me from being farmed" in mind
---
Why are people saying Claudette is a better stealth killer then ghosty boi? She’s better then pig (ambush) shape (evil within) Fred boi Kruger (catching survivors off guard and pulling them in dream when they don’t expect) and all other killers that can sneak up on people.
---
I find the Stache to be the coolest part, actually
---
These things harden a killer's heart gives them powah to do what must be done+!!
---
BECAUSE YOU KEEP BUYING THEIR SKINS AND DLC THAT THEY HAVE 0 INCENTIVE TO ACTUALLY CARE OR IMPROVE.
---
Front Row center!
---
I love this part of the game.  Sometimes I’m injured and I check the basement for a medkit, and while this happens, the killer is strolling nearby and realizes bloodmarks leading into the basement.  At that point in the game, injured, with the killer knowing he has you cornered with nearby hooks accessible, you have to hatch a mighty fine plan with a hint of luck to get out of that basement alive.
---
Myers mommy uwu
---
"Dream Traps" you say?
---
Have I ever told you about my friend Kieth?
---
The same design dev that also claims to be a pig main
---
Just call him The Ghost damn
---
ended up getting face camped but it was well worth it :-)
---
Breaking into tears every time someone gives actual feedback on "a test" probably isn't very constructive either
---
From what I've seen on ptb you can still moonwalk with it.
---
I dodge lobbies if there's 3 or 4 Claudettes in dark clothing. I don't enjoy trying a find a survivor for 5 minutes.
---
Good point I forgot ds got changed
---
The only adjustement I would do to NOED is showing the exposed status as soon as it activates. It would remove most of the frustration survivors have with it (feeling like they shouldn’t have died there, since most killers will camp once gates are opened)
---
Ohh yeah great, do good having only 3 viable killer in red, ohh wait, not even survivors like that since the complaints like "fifth nurse in a row", every killer should be viable. If you don't think that every character in a game should be viable and balanced, please, don't even think in making games.
---
&gt;(4k) at RANK ONE.
---
In the words of my bootleg queen Yuhua Hamasaki, "Because fuck everybody else right?"
---
That's disheartening to hear, but I wouldn't be surprised as that seems to be their attitude to balancing most of the killers.
---
and this is exactly why gens never get done
---
If he's joking it's his fault for saying that  when he could've said  it's just bad internet
---
I bet it will be ah man
---
Oh my God, that's wonderful
---
I don’t think you even realized what you just said
---
Wow so they gave claudette physics, but chopped half the wig off? Poor clauderre that Mary J. Blige wig was my fave!
---
Yeah but didnt they like....test it at all by themselves?
---
Fuck, you made me laugh, you monster!
---
devs scream ocs' (im 90% sure) (it bothered me)
---
Yikes. Just asked if you had a source. You're not "in court"
---
I don't blame people for those sentiments. Releases like this and the Legion feel like they have no internal testing process whatsoever. The ostensible point of public testing is to catch edge cases and unexpected bugs, not to save a few bucks and skip internal QA entirely.
---
Well I'm sure glad you aren't in charge of game design.
---
Yeah, I also see killers duck a lot of lobbies for no obvious reason.  I’ll be solo queue and a few others trickle in far enough apart that they almost certainly aren’t SWF either (maybe a pair at most) and we get ducked anyway.  Or see entire lobbies ducked because one of them has one piece of prestige clothing.
---
As killer, the only time I’ll duck is if I’ve already played with that SWF that session and they were super shitty.
---
Sadly yeah.  It was a bit much before, but it’s too thin now.
---
Invisible claudettes.
---
Kate and Fengs are better. Megs is a little weird looking. Nea's green has bald patches in game.
---
Side shave Nea and that Claudette hair are my go to hairs for them and they both look hideous in this update. Claudette looks like she has alopecia and Nea looks dragged through a hedge with those gross frizzy dreads. I'd rather they just make it straight and flowy on that side like her green bob...
---
Also Jake's long hairs have been updated too and i much prefer them, although they don't seem to have any movement right now
---
0:18
---
**top 5 photos taken right before disaster**
---
Clown got multiple changes on his way out from PTB, the most significant being no movement speed reduction while charging a bottle toss.
---
Setting up drones really isn't that hard and if the scavs just hide in a bush for too long a drone will appear over their head and reveal them for you like DBD crows. 
---
And considering you have global vision, the supercharge speed and jump ability, and a delay before the exit gates even come down, you should be totally able to reach a survivor in time,
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
Honestly just do a little practicing with her vomit. After 1 day you'll be a pro, and essentially get easy downs all day
---
If they don't patch GF during the PTB, then we will have tested nothing about who we will see released.
---
If they patch him on release, we will have every right to repost everything from this week again, unless he is super strong in comparison.
---
... I very obviously said 100% viable, Nurse can still lose in red ranks, and Freddy (objectively worse killer on the live client) can still win in red ranks. Every killer has a chance some better than others but that’s how it’s going to work, they can’t have every killer be as powerful as Nurse because if they were they’d all just be Nurse. Your tone seemed very pointed and aggressive for no reason other than I didn’t agree with someone.
---
My only thought is that maybe this is percentage based, and so few people actually use her at that rank that when she does show up, survivors just dick around and let her kill them? Idk man, haha
---
Yeah, the graphics options are broken on the PTB for some reason. Even restarting after selecting a higher quality won't change it.
---
Hate to break it to you but the public has always been the internal testing.
---
then that's a good thing, it means your teammates are focusing on gens while the killer waste 1 minute to camp your body
---
I wish they weren’t so scared of making top tier killers, the last good one was spirit, everyone else is meh
---
Nope people just do it to karma farm
---
1. No not all killers need to be that tier. But it would be nice to have some fresh killers that are powerful. A large majority of top killers just want to be able to play something new without being shit on. Because new survivors do not matter, skill-wise. But new killers do. They've released several mid-tier killers. It wouldn't hurt to add a new one that's incredibly strong.
---
Billy and Nurse shouldn't be relics of a time gone by where killers were powerful. 
---
2. How is Pig mid-tier? Other than being 115% movement speed and having cute sounds, she's abysmal. Her dash is mostly worthless. Her party hats are great for slowing down the game sometimes but she only gets four. She's an M1 killer 80-90% of the time.
---
3. Like my first point, having only four or five beastly perks is a huge problem. Having only half of the perks be interesting to use is also a huge problem. I can count more than twelve perks that I never see in-game because they add nothing to the gameplay for winning or for fun. I'm tired of seeing Adrenaline. But you're not going to stop seeing it if better perks aren't implemented. Calm Spirit is the perfect example of a perk that is neither fun nor strong.
---
I rather not pallet stun spirit
---
She can do fine without the corruption, one belch sets them into broken so shes kinda just like a worse lf and an even worse Billy, she's still fine though
---
Yeah I thought so
---
Even if he is lying, send it to the devs and ruin that assholes day
---
Claudette’s new weave looks fucking atrocious
---
It's better for Ghost Face to be pretty bad in Ptb, but better when finally released as if he was way too strong in the ptb which would result in a big nerf ground upon release. We know how long the Freddy Rework took, let's not repeat that again
---
I just wish they wouldn't make worse versions of killers we already have.
---
Look at all those cleansing people.
---
Missing haddonfield prefix
---
I mean I think making a killer that's Nurse tier is the same problem in the opposite direction. You gotta admit a Nurse who knows what she's doing with even somewhat decent add-ons and perks destroys the balance of the game.
---
I would argue whatever the fuck Legion was before changes with they're moonwalking and Frank's mixtape was actually close to that level of power albeit with a massively low power ceiling and it being relegated to purple add-ons only and we saw how that turned out.
---
Ffs seriously! (Was gonna comment that had someone not)
---
Let's see... trust my own eyes and the opinions of plenty of streamers who play both survivor and killer whom all say that she is mid-tier at best..
---
or...
---
Trust the word of people who felt Ghostface was in a good spot, and their made-up stats which aren't visible for anyone in the community.
---
Trust my common sense and experience which say that Nurse, Billy, and Spirit are the best killers in the game bar none..
---
or... trust the Devs who are saying it's The Plague is a top killer.
---
What a difficult decision. I suppose if they said the Doctor is a top killer that we should all believe he shouldn't be buffed as well.
---
Sorry hopefully you get the cleansers next time.
---
The OP said it was because the PTB wouldn't render anything above low.
---
Someone who really wants to protect new players. Why play a stealth killer if everyone knows where you are.
---
3 survivors: I will not cleanse.
---
The last one: Hey the others aren't cleansing. I'm going to cleanse!
---
This happened to me when I was playing survivor or the Plague. I have no idea why there's often someone cleansing themselves when others have been obviously staying sick for minutes on purpose.
---
Yeah, it’s pretty annoying when you’ve waited for ages and then get dodged. It wouldn’t be such an issue if survivor queue times weren’t so terrible on PS4. Killers should be free to dodge bad ping, etc., but it shouldn’t ruin the experience for the rest of the lobby either. 
---
One thing that I find helps: load in with no item, and then equip one in the lobby if you want. If two or three survivors load in with items you’ll probably get dodged.
---
The OP said they look lower quality because the PTB was only rendering the game in low.
---
I mean I’d be flattered to think it was because of me, but I’m average at the best of times! So that just can’t be right... I’d believe it if it wasn’t always the instant the fourth survivor joined or readied up
---
That jiggle
---
The OP said it was because the PTB was rendering everything in low.
---
And if you reread what I said you'd realize I'm saying BHVR doesn't think it's as weak as you do. Under the right circumstances 1 MoM can change any entire game. Multiple MoMs even more so, and more easily.
---
Plague is comfortably upper mid tier, and as opposed to some of the other killers, indeed not in dire need of buffs (although she should definitely still have something innate to her kit that incentivizes survivors to actually cleanse, or at the very least add-on reworks that aim for as much).
---
As for how she possibly ended up being a top killer, statistically... well, for a more general thing, the "at rank one" part is a little deceiving, because that only means the player playing Plague is rank 1. We all know that being rank 1 does not at all mean you only get matched with other rank 1 players. That also makes it likelier for those survivors to cleanse willy-nilly. The other thing is that she is a very effective camper: not only can you potentially down would-be-saviors with a Vile-into-hit combo before they can unhook, but often multiple if not all survivors are already Broken, and thus cannot trade saves - which against a camping Plague regularly just means, they effectively cannot save at all. This forces them to have to cleanse, which enables Plague to protect her next hook with Corrupt. I would think it's along the same reasoning behind why Hag is such a top killer, statistically: she is an effective camper, and her ability more or less automatically makes people play more campy just as a function of how it works. And against most average groups of survivors, camping just works.
---
What did they say originally?
---
Him as a survivor would be hilarious
---
Yeah it’s weird right, could it simply just be a bug and I should make a report about it? 
---
If all four survivors join immediately at the same time, then very very likely SWF, dodge that, but otherwise it just seems weird
---
So play like a rank 20 and waste all the pallets in the game within 1min. Got it. What fun - how interactive.
---
I really don’t like Kate’s new hair. Not that it doesn’t LOOK good - it’s definitely an improvement over the old one - but it seems like it lost all of its physics. She’s basically wearing a hair helmet now. It’s doesn’t sway back and forth anymore as she runs, heals, or gens, which I really liked before.
---
Im in the same boat, I don't really *love* noed, but I don't hate it, and I think it's a perfectly valid perk. 
---
I think a really fair and reasonable way to reduce survivor frustration rests NOT in changing NOED itself.. but in adding other dull totem oriented perks. Giving more reasons to break dull totems aside from NOED and Thrill of the Hunt increases the likihood of it being worth the time to find and do them and thus makes survivors generally more likely to do so.
---
When I play killer, and I see that happen...it's my new goal in life to ruin the farmers game. I will tunnel and prox camp his ass.
---
Because I'm not insecure and dont NEED to get that easy kill.
---
It's OK to be insecure as long as you realize it and don't hide from the truth.
---
Summary of what he says please? Im at work rn.
---
Sucks for the 5 people that still use Vigil.
---
FunGoose - best all around killer in DBD, hands down.  Doesnt use add ons.  Actually thinks and creates builds accordingly.  Must watch
---
Puppers - super chill, fun.  Great all around streamer
---
Hexy - fun if you're in a bitching kind of mood lol
---
Tru3 - good streamer, gets a little too sensitive over "his opinion" - not as great at DBD as he thinks he is (at least on the killer side, plus he uses add ons but only really sticks to the same damn enduring/spirit fury for killers it doesnt make sense on)
---
HybridPanda - fun to watch, funny when he gets ticked off lol
---
Cahlaflour - more of your "watch if you're a casual player."  Not a super strong survivor, but usually easy going (she did ban me from her channel for saying "man, too bad the devs didn't put more thought into this killer" and went on a tirade flaming me.  Haven't watched her sense, but trying to be fair
---
ZubatLEL - he's a good killer (but uses add ons).  A little too dry for my tastes
---
AngryPug - hit and miss.  a little too toxic at times.  If he didn't dc so much I'd say he's a great survivor, but he gets frustrated and gives him too easily (sometimes)
---
We'd have to see the stats he's referring to.
---
But what about the post game chat
---
No, that's not what I mean. I want perks on the shrine for the PTB that I already own, because when you but a perk from the shrine that you already own, you get BP instead. I don't want new perks, I want BP so I can spend them on Ghost Face.
---
That's a strong-ass belt :)
---
Did you make a Reddit to post this twice?
---
This meme would be less tone deaf if it weren't for the fact that the PTB isn't up long enough for the devs to make meaningful changes to the killer before release.  They've straight up admitted Ghostface will be released broken and buggy and will be patched along the way.
---
Is nobody gonna talk about the fact that she has no loincloth on and her coochie is hanging out?
---
His power isn't working properly, devs stated that you are supposed to have your survivor physically turn to look at him, instead of using 3rd person mode.
---
How rude
---
Like most games, Public Test Builds/Realms/etc are mostly used to make sure the patch is ready to go live without any major bugs/issues. Balance isn’t really a priority and you can get a lot more meaningful data from the live servers. They can obviously make some changes based on the feedback but primary purpose of the PTB isn’t to make sure everything is balanced, it’s to make sure the game actually works once it goes to the live servers and thousands of people start to play.
---
are you aware that my first one got deleted instantly?
---
I really don't understand this thinking. Don't cleanse yourself of the sickness. Give me permanent exposed on you. Thanks for the downs my guy.
---
I don't get how you can say forcing the broken status effect on every survivor (permanently) is somehow not a good power for a killer
---
Quentin gang rise up
---
&gt;Translation: I'm a survivor main who thinks that a killer who is a threat at all is unbalanced and should be nerfed to the ground
---
See i can make completely biased and untrue statements as well!
---
Ghostface is an objectively bad killer in his current state. His power is completely reliant on survivors having absolutely zero awareness as it stands right now. His power is also completely negated by multiple perks and an item add-on combo. He's as weak as trapper without his traps. Remember when you could permanently remove trapper's ability with Sabo and/or a toolbox? 
---
Yes a smart ghostface *can* get kills, but it is completely unrelated to his power, but because he is a 115% killer. His ability and add-ons don't give him anything to help him secure kills. 
---
He has the same problem as Plague: His power is reliant on survivors making a mistake. He is a reverse Meyers. Meyers is someone that when you see him you break LOS as soon as you possibly can because otherwise he will power up. GF is a killer that if you see him you want to get into his LOS to break his power. That is not good design for a horror game. 
---
Lets not forget that he is horrendously loud while stealthed, louder than spirits vacuum sounds, and his sound is directional like huntress, so you know where he is coming from.
---
And survivors are supposed to survive. There, we have an impasse.
---
Plague is pretty high on the tier list.
---
And after Billy and Nurse i'm pretty sure NO ONE wants another S tier killer who doesn't havt to work for their kills
---
No. The main bug is with spotting him, particularly the 360 camera spin,but ive heard that you also need to see his body to spot him( not sure about that though). Plus ,not a bug but the fact that the STEALTH killer has both a notif about entering his power and a pseudo tr wehn moving in night shroud is jist stupid.
---
It's really not as strong as you are making it out to be, I've seen countless examples of Billys with SF + Enduring getting looped for the whole match that way.
---
It's less about countering looping and more about pressuring the map, Billy doesn't really counter loops, but he has an insta down and can move across the map quickly.
---
Eh, IMO the only reason Freddy is weak is because of how common self-care is. 
---
Right after the healing nerf when all the survivors stopped using it for a few weeks I was absolutely dominating at r1 with Freddy. It wasn't uncommon for me to kill all 4 with 4-5 gens still up. 
---
I just focus on putting as many people as I can to sleep, he can apply an incredible amount of pressure that way. 
---
I don't even think I'm that great at the game, I just think people dismiss him because they want to play him the same way they play other killers.
---
Only responding to the Pig comment. She is mid-tier. She has gen pressure with her traps, her dash is absolutely not worthless. It is a good tool for mindgaming window and pallet loops, especially ones that are not safe. I have stopped plenty of loops short with it. Her crouch mechanic, while kinda bad, is good for starting the game off finding a survivor to down and get the ball rolling. Saying Pig is garbage shows you don't understand how to play her and as a Pig main, it infuriates me.
---
I love when they just “it’s just the ptb calm down” like are you fucking mental? Do you have a clue what ptb means? 
---
It’s where we voice out our opinions so it doesn’t come out weak and unplayable. Some people are just stupid.
---
... so do the “REALLY good” killers
---
He spoke the truth, and everyone hated him for it
---
Then there is no counterplay, every Huntress will fear you.
---
I want bendy from bendy and the ink machine as a killer, but that seems pretty unlikely
---
Hellpriest (pinhead)
---
Is this from a video, or are there only screenshots of this? I'd love to see some more early DBD.
---
Do you have link for the stats I didn't see them? Thanks
---
Go check the Starcraft Reddit. Hold on to your butts tho because it's fucking crazy over there. A 21 year 3 way divide
---
Mmmm, das some quality content.
---
I got it with the "Me being silly aside...", but to answer your question, they might have dodged for reasons other than a suspected SWF.
---
What buff would Clown even get/deserve? He is already deserving of a nerf to his exhaustion add on, and his power is generally unfun to play against. The killers that are fun to play against like Billy and Wraith have unique and interesting powers, clown just has a boring ass slow that fucks with your vision.
---
I’ve grown up being told the Scream (aka ghost face) is also called the boogeyman...?
---
We all can whip up some stats in Excell for show and tell.
---
But there isn't anyone with a semblance of experience and sobriety playing this game in the red ranks that would say with a straight face that The Plague is a top tier killer.
---
That's a movie character, but he'd still be cool. He's owned by the same company that owns Scream though, so people think they might not be able to get him sadly.
---
*Night Shroud
---
Has to add "or years" due to Freddy xP
---
I wish I had my asshole fisted by all of them at the same time
---
I mean she should of left me alone then lol
---
Yes that's how double blood points works. For a quick breakdown I came up with a little saying:
---
"Take the amount of blood points you would normally make, now double it."
---
It's easier to remember if you sing it to the tune of your favorite song.
---
I never said you were. I just said "don't buy the DLC" because it would then incentivize BHVR to prioritize fixing Ghostface. Not sure what part of that comment was difficult to understand.
---
Yes, it is problem that he is going to be released broken. But there is probably no stopping that, so everyone should voice their point in a more powerful way by not buying the DLC lmao Speak with the wallet and things will probably change.
---
Your comment is ridiculous, now move on
---
Are you aware that you didn't reply to the comment that you meant to.
---
Billy can counter loops much better than you might think
---
No, I know. Boogeyman in closet or under bed (usually it’s told under bed). But I just grew up with the killer / movie character having basically 3 names. Ghost Face, Scream, Boogeyman
---
Who the fuck is Claudette?
---
Nasal duck quack, don't let them even know what hit them. Be merciless.
---
See I get that, but she doesn’t rely on survivors. If they don’t cleanse then they won’t be able to heal sooo her ability is still good and being used. Makes everyone 1 hit and they have green shit and they make more noise.
---
Very cute
---
Yep lol. I would love a cool unique character but...that hope died ages ago
---
oh yes, im sure all the mo capping they did for this game will be screwed up if they add something else to the game... They probably dont wanna bother animating something that isnt a human.
---
Only the 4 original character, you need to sacrifice them 25 times for each face.
---
but... evil :)
---
I meant just in case she has Spirits fury. What are you on about? 
---
If she had Spirits Fury you would’ve died.
---
Angry oink &gt;:(

---
Lol. There is no "high success" way to snipe each other. You asked a question, I answered. Play the game normally. Have a nice day.
---
But it is obvious the kobe was from Deliverance due to the broken status.
---
A insidious leatherface suddenly appears !
---
Haha, nice juke.
---
Yeah. They won't even try and animate a kid too. So killers like Chucky is never gonna happen
---
From what I've seen so far, they aren't trash, but they (very) are far from being the top programmers in the gaming industry.
---
They aren’t talking about the killer being difficult or un fun to play, they are boring to play against. Hag is boring to play against coz you just crouch everywhere and if you don’t then chances are you won’t have an easy time winning. No one thinks hag is hard to play she’s easy but she’s not even fun to play with coz everyone plays immersed. Plague I also think is fun to play against, and leatherface if they aren’t a camper, but hag na. She’s painful and like legion she drags the game out.
---
Implying it takes this much effort to stop Ghostface
---
Last killer was plague, really decent killer. Even when survivors don't clense, she basically has noed.
---
Legion is a good killer after his changes, extra movement speed made a big difference.
---
Spirit is literally the 2nd strongest killer in the game.
---
And I oop-
---
It will not work out “well” in the long run because you just wasted a ton of pallets, and played like a rank 20. So the Billy slowly and slowly gets stronger with less and less pallets on the map as the game progresses. So he can now instadown you easier, which is partly why this build is particularly oppressive on Billy vs. Other killers. You see countless people playing killer saying “lol this guy is new he’s wasting all the pallets early” which is not “looping well” which is exactly what sf + enduring encourages.
---
wow thanks for pointing that out!!!!!!! first day on reddit and getting hate from everyone, what a toxic community 💀
---
On one side yes but on the other they would have to increase the amount of time you have to stalk survivor for
---
Haven't watched him yet, does the survivor have to face him or just their camera?
---
I actually see Jeff all the time, what rank are you in?
---
you can loop the killer while being broken. Your team just get wipe if she gets the red puke.
---
All perfectly reasonable. Besides point one, it’s too frequent for it to be a coincidence of phone call/toilet time every time (I fully accept it could be, just seems very unlikely). 
---
Reason aside, I much prefer it to happen in the lobby than mid-game or during game loading, this issue is more just of a head scratcher than annoying.
---
*kept the hatch open*
---
What a legend
---
The only thing that worries me in Spine Chill. It’s supposed to be an anti-stealth perk. Now, I don’t know exactly how it works with Facey in game right now, but short of making it so that it takes him out of his power when survivors can’t actually see Ghostface, no changes should be make to that perk
---
Pig has a power tho making her better
---
Fair warning, I haven't actually played him yet, but it's all in good fun
---
Uuuuuh yes. Yes I am well aware that Deliverance was used to unhook herself :|
---
Ignoring skill in this statement and she still is boring to play against. By that logic of “if the player is good it won’t be fun” then every killer would have the potential to be un fun which just isn’t true. If there’s a bad legion do you still have fun? No. It’s nothing to do with skill it’s the killers ability dragging the game out longer.
---
I've been playing Feng for a while now, but maybe I should go back to my true main Bill for a bit. He needs to representation.
---
I could have meant joy playing as the SWF I suppose! But definitely sarcasm though.
---
Honestly I've never seen the movies or paid too much attention to the pop culture around him so I didnt know but cool
---
Slenderman would be awesome
---
You can loop the killer while being exposed and yet Myers' power isn't "useless". You can loop the killer who's revving a chainsaw behind you and Billy's power isn't "useless"
---
I understand your point. But I guess if you think about the numbers it can make sense. There are probably 500-1000 killers playing atm. So ten of them dodging for that reason doesn’t seem to unreasonable
---
The last one would be worthless imo. The second one might be op? Idk, guess id have to see that in action. First one should've been a given.
---
His mori would be: 
---
Gordon knocks the survivor on the ground, grabs a fork and knife, says "finally some good fucking good" and stabs the survivor with the fork and eats them
---
Damn is that so? I went back and set my live version to ultra and that seemed to fix the PTB temporarily. Thanks. :)
---
The thing is, a second is still too fast. He’s basically an M1 killer, which sucks man. I few number changes could fix him I think and then we’ll have the memey, yet not terrible killer we will all hopefully love
---
They're ok, but the second one is waaaaaay underpowered. It'd have to be a lot higher percentage before being worth taking as a perk
---
Yeah I so seldom use an item, went through a brief spree of flashlight usage to learn how easy/hard they were actually to use and just don’t anymore. Way too easy, and often just annoys the killer (as when I play Killer it certainly annoys me!)
---
Nea has a bald spot on low setting on the PTB in the back of her hair
---
For alternative styling, I recommend using  Jake's cowboy head with the rest of the 30s outfits. It looks so cool. But then again there are several awesome combinations you can pull off with these outfits.
---
Plag**
---
Idk if I’m more upset they clearly didn’t play test him AT ALL to make sure the baseline mechanics work, or the fact everything about the killer hinders his ability to stealth and he’s unreasonably weak.
---
I wanna know who put bad in quotations... are you implying that "thats... an opinion"
---
I thought Huntress was considered mid-tier? I've only encountered a handfull of Huntresses who demonstrate sniper-level/no-scope skills.
---
This needs more upvotes
---
I actually like all of these changes. Most of the hair looks fuller and Claudette’s looks less bulky
---
It's random spawn and most of them are pretty well hidden. Stop crying
---
Black Incense and Thanatophobia can sort of counter that survivor play style. The real problem is that add on is ultra rare.
---
They're all boring to me except the tattoo girl
---
Killers are supposed to feel powerful, the trials are supposed to be tilted in the killers favor, right?
---
Let's just hope pallet vacuum remains as a myth, no killer wants that hell back.
---
I think Pig would like to get her hands on some full crouched movement speed though.
---
God bless, Florida Man. He tried?
---
Oh no they play the game! They are just very very bad. And they make changes based on their experience, which they truly are the minority (except maybe not_queen) because even people who’ve never played the game before are better than they are.
---
True they’re anti-stereotypes now lol The fatherless girl who could only get into college by being an athlete also seems a little stereotypical for a black person, I think. Same goes for min, a lazy gamer who refused to be academic, ran away from home and became a mess.
---
Yes AFTER it was already used. I'm talking about beforehand.
---
&gt; Against a normal terror radius killer you get a second of extra time to hide or make a move that you don’t really need because you hear their heartbeat anyway
---
Except Spine Chill often tells you if you even need to hide or not.  Running off and hiding the moment you hear a heartbeat isn't very effective lol  
---
And given that Ghostface's only real strength is getting a strong first hit, having a perk that allows you to freely completely negate his power is pretty clearly a bad thing
---
This is TOO perfect
---
I would love Chad Kensington from F13: The Game as a survivor...rocking the tiger striped speedo!!!!!
---
Spirit turned out really good at live though. Legion was definitely dumb, but overall just a wonky killer. Frank's Mixtape Legion was broken, infinite mend Legion was ALT+F4-inducing. Now Legion is just kinda "eh". Clown I only remember his Bottle Throw movement speed being bad, but it has been so long that I have probably forgotten the other issues and now it comes down to bad map/gen pressure.
---
Man it's been about three months since this image was reposted! A new record!
---
The high skill ceiling and map disadvantages is what made me think of her as a lower tier killer, as well as the audible detection range. While I can see what makes her a top tier killer, the game design, for better or worse, seems to really cement her under Billy and Nurse who don't have the same terrain limitations.
---
Please tell me the secret to not getting lost and finding totems effectively on lery’s, because that map is hell for me as survivor.
---
With the new hair update Nea’s green hair has ridiculous bald spots on the back of her head. When she’s moving you can see so much of her scalp and another giant chunk of missing hair appears.
---
Every other hair cosmetic looks amazing with the update .. but Nea got fucked
---
Take my money!!!!!!!!
---
He’s a game designer, he was in the latest dev stream talking about ghostface
---
Chucky/Sam/Leprechaun aren't kids.
---
They probably meant no Kid Survivors.
---
I highly doubt they'd pass up on Chucky when the rest of the well has run dry, and Lep is kind of known for being "So Bad It's still really bad but kind of fun" so I doubt he'll never make it in.
---
Best Killer because she either forces everyone to play with No Mither or she's Tier 3 Myers on crack cocaine.
---
BHVR doesn't need to make anything "menacing" or whatever roleplay some Killer mains want. This is an action game with horror overtones. Past 50 hours no one is going to be scared of the Killer, nor need they be. As far as the strength of the Killers, it makes sense to have a stratified level of good to worse ones. So Ghostface isn't a strong Killer? I honestly don't care. I would love to see more variety in the higher tiers, too, but the type of Killer they were going for here was more fun and niche than high tier. 
---
The irony of saying Survivor mains have a false sense of oppression, then inferring that Ghostface being weak is some choice by BHVR to keep Killers less menacing is honestly amazing. You're acting like BHVR is oppressing you by not giving you a stronger Killer. Jesus Christ.
---
And because people go red faced and cross-eyed when anyone points these things out, I am a *Killer Main* and still see this kind of post for the victim-y bullshit it is. You're not entitled to the newest Killer being strong. BHVR isn't required to make every Killer S tier. "Behaviour needs to stop being 'scared'." Unbelievable lack of self-awareness.
---
That's a really good idea ! I like the sound of that
---
What rank?
---
Is it just me or does david look like a good looking hitler
---
I guess it’s supposed to synergies with his power removing his terror radius. Could work for other killers who can remove terror radius mid chase like Pig or wraith. But I agree, his perks are interesting but seem just ok in application
---
Big dick energy right there
---
I had a feeling, but wasn't sure. Kate Denson is like that too, was playing as her &amp; was being healed &amp; since your head is hanging down, her hair was doing that &amp; it looked like she was wearing a wig lol. Such a bad bald spot.
---
Haha, it always looked kind of weird to me like play-doh. I can see why you don't like it though. It's annoying to pay money for something and they go and fuck it up without warning.
---
I'm not sure you understand what my original point was.
---
What rank am I? Or?
---
That and what you're looking to play around
---
By kids I meant small killers that are shorter than the average killer. Would be funny seeing something that short/small try and pick up a survivor and hook them
---
...They said "didn't think they'd kobe in the first place" meaning **before** they got hooked. The broken status is after you unhook yourself.
---
Yep only person that wants it is the crybaby skilless salty survivor disliking our comments.
---
Two perks of yours were hidden, i know the middle finger is DS but out of curiosity what's the Nicholas Cage - looking one?
---
Well to be fair closed testing is usually done first and this ghostface thing feels like they just didnt do that at all.
---
If she puts the trap on your head AFTER all the gens are done then you can escape. If she puts it on BEFORE the last gen is done then you can't escape. You should know based on if it beeps or not.
---
If you put a trap on after all generators are done, yes.
---
Look at how they massacred my girls
---
What if looking at Ghostface would make your meter go down 1.5 times faster (decreasing while looking at each other) and cancelling it when a stalked survivor's meter reached zero? Unfortunately I didn't have time to test it or against it yet, just came to my mind based on the videos I saw from Monto, King, No0b3. Also somebody may have asked this already, sorry in that case
---
I’m a rank 12, and I don’t mind. Just as long as your rank is near mine.
---
I do understand what the original point was. I am sure the Nurse didn't think the Jane would Kobe, but I don't think she was dumbfounded by it. Deliverance kobes aren't anything special anymore. It is pretty common.
---
A pretty ironic thing to say after showing us that clip.
---
Not really, killers like nurse and Billy the traverse the map quickly and once you hook a survivor it snowballs.
---
That's exactly what killed Deathgarden on its initial release. They have a valid reason to make the game accessible, gaining new players is an extremely important part of an online game. It's really foolish for people to want all perks and new killers to base based around those who have thousands of hours in the game, that's just not good for business. The ideal situation is honestly the middle tier killers.
---
I mean I died later anyways lol
---
So way back in the mine
---
From the thread OP linked i found out why you shouldn't cleanse, i had no idea other players weren't cleansing. TIL!
---
Yes, I know that. But they also expressed that the Nurse was dumbfounded, which I don't think they were.
---
Maybe it's not Plague that's bad, but you. Lol git gud
---
Payday 2 seriously? the characters don’t fit for this game
---
They probably look lower quality because the after is clearly on lower settings
---
Could have been anything from just poorly done testing [plenty of QA test sessions are highly restrictive and don't yield a lot of good results] to none at all.
---
I saw a lot of streams but each one of them says that you don't have to directly look at him but in my games I looked at him all the time while he was stalking and it didn't work and he still got exposed effect on me. Also one thing he was stalking me while on the stairs of the Macmillan estates generator that is in on the 2nd floor his head was the only thing that was in sight and he got the effect on me maybe that have something to do with it
---
Lol well it’s best to assume spirit has Spirits fury so you should throw down pallet early it may help. 
---
Anyways good day!
---
Time to find out how to replicate this while having object of obsession
---
Thank you for your common sense reply. It's nice to see. Balancing cant be easy, and I think the dev's do their best.
---
Shill post
---
Im inclined to believe that behavior probably has an incompetent QA team because if they had a good QA team there would have been changes to the ptb before it was released. I think this “system” of using the ptb as  a replacement for internal testing would be okay if they ever made any actual changes to the ptb before release.
---
Happy Cake Day! Oink oink :3
---
True. But I think it's more psychological. I noticed when I started using Thanato survivors started cleansing more often. I will keep it in her arsenal until I find something better. Obviously smart survivors will continue to power through, but one or two potatoes can keep the blood puke flowing.
---
r/sarcasm
---
Nea's got some weird cosmetics.
---
Oh no. The idea that people consider not cleansing against the Plague a viable strategy is comical to me. Yeah, be one hit from death and approximately twice as noisy as a normal injured survivor. That’ll learn me.
---
Then we’ll call me an uneducated dummy and move on
---
I mean, it's ptb
---
Not really (9), but she's the one I enjoy the most :)
---

Problem is the PTB usually doesn't see _that_ many changes before live.  At least it is confirmed that Ghostface's power isn't working as intended right now and they should hopefully get that resolved before he goes live.
---
Clown received buffs during PTB and seemed fine, when released. People initiatlly put him quite high at tier list at first. It took people much longer to figure out that he is a mediocore killer or easier to counter than first thought.   
---
PTBs did really start to get more frustrating with Spirit, who took until MidChapter patch to become viable, I think. At least one of the devs admitted that one of the intended buffs wasn't ready when she was released.
---
If that was my dog, I would name him "Ghost."
---
9 day respond....lol
---
Probably, aside from Spirit I can't think of too many killers who received swift fixes to ensure they played well. But at the same time, they spent a LOT of money on developing Spirit because of all her animations. She was a very expensive killer compared to others and I imagine that was a huge incentive towards making her function right in the live build haha.
---
No it's not because I am neither us or them, I play both roles and I am telling it EXACTLY like it is. Honestly, both you and the main comment for this thread, you guys just don't understand the game. Your opinion is just plainly wrong, and there is no way to convince you outside of you just sitting down and consuming like 1000s of hours of this game like people like me have. Not only do I play both roles, watch DBD streamers, but I also watch the DBD live streams AND watch stand-alone compilitations and youtube videos. I'm telling you, your opinion is OBJECTIVELY wrong. Some killers are assholes, this is true, but with the removal of being able to straight face camp, I very rarely see salty / obnoxious killers. For survivors its basically every other game.
---
Fair point.
---
Have been playing again with OoO, I must say I agree, I forgot how fun it was. Never knew why it wasnt a more popular perk
---
I just hope devs would look at these memes to realize the mistake they made.
---
He is underwhelmingly weak compared to other killers.
---
Oh most definitely. I am just not gonna buy the DLC more than likely until things get changed. I am not really interested in playing Ghostface as it is after the PTB. We get the maps even without buying the DLC, so no problem here.
---
I liked the sound of it to be honest.  Then again I liked Montos idea of having to have the survivor face Ghostface and point too lol. 
---
Let’s be honest anything is better than what it is now.
---
This. I don't understand why people want this cashier dude so bad, there's nothing special about him. I'm startin to think they do it for the memes and ez karma, like shirtless myers
---
Sorry about that.
---
Maybe it's your skill that is lacking, not the characters.
---
THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN HER TERROR RADIUS, THE VACUUM NOISE IS REMOVED
---
AMEN
---
'Friend'
---
Leatherface is balanced, he has the potential to down an entire team in one use of his power and with that comes the penalty of being slower during the ability. Every killer has something to balance out their power, spirit only seeing scratch marks, legion only seeing survivors, Doctor having to switch between therapy and treatment and being slower during therapy, etc. You take away LF’s downside and then you have a killer with only positives, that’s not good balance when everyone else has at least 1 negative.
---
Are the Bill perks just standard bloodweb perks (similar to spine chill or noed) on console?
---
The Kidnapper from the Welcome to the Game series
---
I've just signed in and out of PSN and reset the game and it's sorted itself out.
---
I think Ghostface was supposed to be a mix of two killers. They might have made him weaker/added the ability to counter his power because of that. It's not necessarily a bad idea imo but it's just poor execution. They made his power useless.
---
They went overboard, ofcourse. Their go-to for making things seems to either make something *really* powerful and nerf it later*, or make something laughably weak and buff it later*
---
Later = several weeks/months
---
Me when I run No Mither to the other survivors: "can you please not cleanse"
---
Other survivors: "I think I will"
---
Doesn't MoM now work against stuff like chainsaws and iridescent hatchets though?
---
I’ve been having luck running thanatophobia + dying light. If I glean get everyone broken and stay in chases people start cleansing just to have a somewhat manageable speed on gens,  which is pretty slow. 
---
Warning this does mean you have to tunnel your obsession and be ready to switch targets if there is multiple DS.  But you don’t have to worry about DS too much if your only tunneling the one obsession and then playing “normally”
---
Fuck yeah. I mean she should of just closed the hatch tho lmao.
---
I think they Made it even a little bit stronger by letting you already use it in the pickup Animation.
---
Tbh 80% of survivors and 38% of killers I play killer a lot and survivor a bit and tbh the survivors are just fucking spoilt but there are the rare occasion of getting back a gg wp in chat
---
The only one i disagree with is plague, cmon she even says like, words kinda
---
If they disconnect via the game's menu, they lose their bloodpoints and items. But if they disconnect by unplugging their ethernet cable, they just keep everything.
---
heavy rank decay does this.... pretty good job so far.
---
You never know, basically. GTA points have gone on sale before.
---
oooooooh this alternate history sure is interesting but I think they wanted more Cary Elwes or Sam Neil from more superior live-action Jungle Book instead of less hairy Stalin and his sidekick young adventurous Mao Ze Dong.
---
Closing off the hatch
---
Wraith also took a year lol. They treat the weakest killers poorly for lengthy amounts of time.
---
I imagine ti would work the same as killer though? That isnt a purposeful thing so it should
---
Pyramid head from silent hill would be sick. 
---
They could do a really really cool Evil Within killer and survivor. 
---
I would welcome anything resident evil. 
---
Slender man could be neat
---
And you talk like doctor was balanced, he one of the low tier. Spirit can ignore her weakness by having a ear,. Also nurse and Billy only have "weakness" if they miss.
---
Ace mains are sadly not common
---
👈😭👉 sad zoop
---
Insidious leatherface with the beartraps addon no less!
---
Factsssss 😂
---
Don’t forget faster vault speed too
---
Plenty of David and Jake lately due to the new outfits.
---
As a killer main... I notice the broken symbol when people use deliverance, and I watch for the kobe every time because 1/5 games with deliverance is enough to be wary.
---
They pay for chapters.
---
Myers mask with ghostface mask in the most cursed thing I’ve ever seen from dbd
---
Should actually be flaired with "Salt", since one could git gud and learn where the totems spawn. But having to learn something might make baby survivors leave I'm droves... or something.
---
Kate's the only one who got decent hair in all of that..
---
He touched the butt
---
Does this mean it's not happening? :(
---
That makes sense
---
I DON’T LIKE THAT TBH
---
there were instances for me on the ptb, that i wasn't able to stalk them through grass, but they could remove my stealth through it. That's what he was refering to i think
---
My bad, the lower quality version is due to my PTB rendering being broke. I fixed it though.
---
[New version.](https://i.imgur.com/kwK7h5D.jpg)
---
Yeah I’m not really interested in building a PC just to play DBD I only recently started playing again anyway not sure if I’m going to stick around.
---
I wanna day it’s hook sacrifices only as well.  Jake, Meg, Claudette, and Dwight. 
---
Plenty of Claudette’s out there.  I actually took the longest to get Jake.  I literally would dodge lobbies until I found a Jake. It was fun.
---
UNDERSTANDABLE
---
Haha garbage asss leatherface
---
Um...good I'm glad you notice when they use it. Looking at symbols is killer gameplay 101. Personally I don't care if someone has deliverance or not because it's never done them any good (not against me anyway). 
---
PS: I play Killer and Survivor respectively
---
What did Fred get himself into now?
---
right 😂😂
---
I didn't even think about Welcome to the Game, that's an interesting choice!
---
The level system is basically a farming simulator, forcing you to do a bit of everything, which is unrealistic. A survivor's objective is to survive. If they avoided the killer, hid successfully, won chases and didn't get hooked once, why should a team who played so efficient be penalised?
---
Same goes for killer. You can 4k people in a few minutes with not a single generator done. That should be a pip, I don't care what you say. This whole notion of having to make sure you get points in all categories is ridiculous for a game like this.
---
Then we should get Sujan as a survivor. Only issue is if Kindred should be one of her teachables (Probably not.)
---
We also have Clyde, Murf, etc. I'd love to see all the "proto-survivors" turn into actual characters.
---
Yeah I don’t know why I typed that glad you caught it so I don’t look like a complete noob.
---
I said it once and I'll say it again, I need to be as high as the rhino
---
Well the former s allegedly based on impersonal facts, and the latter based on personal anecdotes.
---
BHVR said just spinning the camera shouldn't destroy his power. It is impossible that any internal testing whatsoever was conducted as this is a very stupidly large, and extremely obvious error. You cannot test the killer internally, and not catch this bug. Literally playing a single match would of caught it. The PTB is supposed to be larger scale testing to catch things that slip through. Not the only source.
---
That Meg would've made it if she hadn't stopped.
---
Mikan is Ghostface but Exposes herself instead of Survivors
---
I love it!
---
If they were to add a killer for this. I'd nominate evil as with boomstick ( close range insta down) weilding a chainsaw for his Reg attack.
---
IVE ONLY PLAYED AGAINST A GOOD CLOWN ONCE AND PLAYING AS HIM IS UNDERWHELMING SINCE MOST OF THE TIME SURVIVORS PREDICT WHERE ITS THROWING WITH THE ANIMATION AND ARE OUT OF THE RADIUS BY THEN SO IT BECOMES AN ATTEMPT TO JERK YOUR AIM WHICH SUCKS ON CONSOLE
---
Add me and we can party up
---
Name is same as here
---
They could've done this before EGC. There is simply a time limit now.
---
that sloooo mo
---
She's the technical services manager.
---
It happens so much so me and my swf we end up bringing things like adrenaline and wake up for that exact purpose
---
Good Bot
---
Didn't Murf turn out to be Dwight though? Or was he a completely separate character? I'd love a chapter made just to celebrate where they started out, bring out Murf, Sujan and the other OG ones since we've got a couple of "chapters" that are more like paragraphs since they're just the killer.
---
The timelimit is the best part, because you can force them to go trough it till they get sacrificed, and they have no chance of escaping, it's basically forcing them to deal with the unevitable, and it's wonderfull
---
While as I agree with you at the start, the killers should be terrifying, the rest of that is bs. I am a complete killer main, but that should not be the case. The killer will- as long as the game is structured as it is- always have the harder time, and that’s the way it’s supposed to be. The devs try very hard to get the game to be 50/50, and while I’ll respect your opinion that the killer should have an easier time, I think that would be completely stupid. Your ability to do well is based off of your skill, and usually not from outside help (e.g moris) so therefore, your skill should determine how the game turns out. I’m sorry if I lost you along that, it was kind of whatever I thought of, but overall, that’s not how it should be
---
Being brutal and being unfair are two different thing. Being the final survivor during EGC is litterally impossible once hatch is shut. I get if no gens have been completed, the survivor not only doesnt deserve to escape, but they most likely wouldn't. However, imagine mew have 4 gens done but you're the last survivor. Theres a purrty good chance that mew at least deserve a shot at escape, yet EGC makes it litterally impossible against anyone who isnt utter shit st the game
---
No but there is plenty of places to loop unless people are throwing down pallets, and if a killer does kick the gen I doubt they're just gonna leave instantly if they know people are around.
---
It would depend on the map tbh, places that have corn is horrid for Ghostface since you can’t stalk past the corn, but a place like Haddonfield would be great since there’s too many vantage points it would be hard for a survivor too see you.
---
I think you confuse “bully” with “power role”. Just because a killer is the power role doesn’t mean they have to try and ruin someone’s fun to “be a bully”. 
---
You being an asshole on purpose is different than playing a mechanic introduced into the game. EGC favors killers. I don’t know who hurt you for you to need to feel personal power over someone in a game.
---
That’s not a valid method either way. Survivor queue times and killer queue times are miles different, simply queuing at same time will not help get together.
---
Does tabula rasa deny adrenaline? Also love this, most people making fan content don’t know how to balance, this is good
---
Wait do Jane's tits actually bounce that much?
---
It used to be when they were shorter...
---
What’s with “...” every message lol.
---
Idk im edgy today by the looks of it
---
You're contradicting yourself.
---
If he's as strong as Wraith, he **definitely** needs buffs.
---
Well then you get chased? If someone brings the killer over to me I’m not gonna complain I’ll run around with the killer to get those evade points. Do you not like evade points?
---
DON'T FORGET THE PEOPLE WHO UNHOOK WITH THE KILLER NEAR THEN INSTANTLY IMMERSE AND LEAVE THE UNHOOKED PERSON IN THE OPEN BLEEDING EVERYWHERE SO YOU ONLY HAVE ONE TARGET, THANKS FOR THE HELP BLENDETTE
---
Well, sometimes i feel a bit of mercy for the survivors, and do let them escape trough the gate, but really only if i steamrolled the game.
---
Memory might be fuzzy, but I think the line was always "Me and my buddy Keith!"
---
Ghostface’s power is bugged.
---
oMg TrAsH TiEr KiLLeR — hErE’s HoW i WoULd FiX HiM. 
---
Everyone giving their trash 2 cents on an ability that isn’t even working properly yet. Fucking LOL.
---
Then why didn’t you do a proper test of this instead of sticking it in the beta? Beta testing isn’t meant to be a free QA/AT team.
---
Here comes the Trapper\~ You'd better watch out for his traps \*Trap sound\*! Here comes the Trapper\~ You'd better eat some ginger snaps \*Trap sound\*! The Trapperrrrr\~! Jazz, jazz hands (insert Samination reading the superchat here)
---
Yea that’s pretty true, and after Freddy they’d totally rather put a perk or killer on the weaker side than stronger, which I’ll admit is really stupid. They have this thing called the ptb that lets them test the stronger things out and nerf/buff accordingly, but they’re afraid of the outcry. It’d be nice if they got out of their and the community’s comfort zone- at least on the ptb so they could actually make a strong and fun perk/ killer
---
Better to release a killer weak rather than OP
---
