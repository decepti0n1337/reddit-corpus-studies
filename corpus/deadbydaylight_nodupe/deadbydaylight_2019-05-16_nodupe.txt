The reason I have Legion so low is he requires good addons to be semi relevant the bottum 3 killers you will notice tend to take the most amount of time to "build up" to even be able to down a survivor, Legion is in the same boat as Freddy, their power is just straight counter intuitive to what a killer wants to do. Its never a good thing when a killer is literally punished for hitting a survivor.

---
Trapper just need to start with ALL of his traps then place them as he wants rather than having to go get them and boom he is balanced.
---
---
---
Along with what other people said, it has to be one contiguous chase. If the chase breaks at any point, the count will be reset. This usually happens when forcing them onto the chute, and they vault back before being sighted again.
---
Holy fuck I’m stupid we were agreeing the whole time
---
Just wait until the end game screen pops up then click leave game through there. If you hit esc then leave early it counts as DC.
---
LF Is too high, LF should be bottom tier, then Freddy above LF. Freddy is better than LF at the very least.
---
That sucks
---
Goodbye
---
Indeed, glad you're one of the good ones at least from what I gleam from here 💀💜
---
It makes me wonder if they had intentions from the start to troll or jus decided to mid match, like if they intentionally ran the Killer to my and my GF throughout that match.  Matters little, but I'm too damn curious.
---
I try my best to be good/decent as Survivor and try to save as many, on my main Survivor Nea I run We'll Make It and usually Borrowed Time just for those needed saves. Sadly some people grow up into being selfishly rude individuals and often it shows in video game interactions (almost like a social test)
---
Hope the best in the future for ya
---
Best
---
Track survivors, get a first free hit with Feral Frenzy, locate the other survivors and chain as many different Frenzy hits as possible, then chase the last one normally.
---
Now you have 1/2/3 survivors injured AND wasting time mending and you are in a chase with an injured survivor.
---
Use Feral Frenzy tracking wisely.
---
I'm just saying adrenaline is the only one that can be annoying
---
Honestly, now I would just be fine being able to play the damn game.
---
New Survivor: Jotaro Kujo ~~(It doesn't make sense with the Killer but let's be honest he's the most famous JooJ)~~
---
Perks: Za Wardo, Yare Yare, Family Technique
---
New Killer: Yoshikage Kira the Killer Queen
---
Power: Bites Za Dusto
---
Powers: Beautiful Hands, Beautiful Dewang (chew), Hundred Faces
---
What perks did they replace aftercare and wake up for?
---
Ugh, that's dumb. It's 30 seconds from the moment the struggle prompt goes away until it loads the end scene, it's just so boring and unnecessary to sit through over and over again. Should at the very least be a skip-button. Anyway, thanks for the reply.
---
All the addons work very well but you just gotta double stack them unless it’s the buttons
---
Its like 10-15 seconds tho
---
Damn thats spot on. Im jealous.
---
Last night is the most recent. 5 bad games in a row.
---
Game 1: Pro nurse. Downed all three team mates within two minutes. I unhooked one but by that time she was on my ass again, and downed us both. Why even bother?
---
Game 2: Same fucking nurse. Enough said.
---
Game 3: Camping and nodding leatherface. Team mates go in for unhook even though he's clearly camping. Two hooked within the first few minutes, and the third guy is crouching nearby eager to join them. I wanted to ignore them and just work on the gen, but inevitably I have to go over and try to help. I don't need to tell you how it went.
---
Game 4: Another nurse. Different player but same results.
---
The fifth game was the drought breaker, but only because we versed a Myers who didn't know how to tier up and had NOED. Lol'd at that and escaped while he camped one poor team mate to secure a kill.
---
u/Peanits
---
Thank chief. I'll look into that.
---
The flying upgrades for video basically make it infinite as long as you touch the side of a building. I will admit the slow down is really nice but I like invisibility for video better since it can be an instant kill on most enemies besides the heavy guys
---
How so, Freddy is basically an M1 killer who has to wait to M1, LF is an M1 killer who doesnt have to wait and can chainsaw break pallets, and can 1HD a survivor or multiple in the right situations, By no means is LF  a "good" killer but he is far more consistent than the ones below him.
---
I can stand with that
---
Playing as Myers against an obviously deranking Voicecom SWF Squadette.
---
&gt;The perks are basically built in hacks
---
I don't understand what you're even trying to say with this statement. Also, apparently totem spawns are somewhat fixed.
---
Why does it look like she has a tail....
---
I thought Legion was based on ghostface but then he got leaked :s
---
Well this is, odd
---
I saw the scratch marks when you ran in the school. I also know that the hatch almost always spawns down there
---
Sure, but the problem is hitting a survivor then just letting them go so you can go for another survivor is just not good killer gameplay, it might be a good thing to do in some situations but as a core mechanic of a killer its bad. On top of that he gets punished even harder for missing an attack or for hitting the same survivor multiple times. This isnt even counting the fact that top survivors will just split up against a Legion. 
---
So you become an M1 killer who has to 
---
Find Survivor&gt;Frenzy&gt;M1&gt;Can you see another survivor&gt;
---
Yes&gt;Go for that one, let the other one go Try and repeat
---
No&gt;Stick to same survivor, M1&gt;Miss or Hit&gt;Become Stunned&gt;M1 again to down. You have to M1 3 times to down a single survivor in most situations as legion. Thats not even taking into consideration Survivors locker dodging, using deadhard, MoM, and so on. 
---
The amount of times I had a Legion run at me and I SB away right before they hit me just to have them miss and get stunned is stupid. Legion gets punished more than Freddy for using his ability, only bonus Legion has is  that they can still just hit a survivor the moment they are found.
---
Yeah, really the same. Let's see:
---
Ruin is required to win on almost all killers because very few have the map pressure to not have 5 gens pop in 6~ minutes (or less) as generators are done fairly fast even when a killer has optimal chases, essentially leaving three perks for actual gameplay purposes. It can be gone after ten seconds and rarely lasts longer than a minute or two, and can be ignored entirely if survivors can hit skill checks. Against swf, it also is gone as soon as someone spots it because at that point it becomes non-defendable unless you wanna throw the game. 
---
Meanwhile, MoM is one of various second chance perks that are not needed (how many survivors make it to high ranks without perks and add-ons vs. how many killers do? Survivors need extra tools way less than killers do), that require no skill to use (somehow, suddenly old DS seems skillful), furthers the divide between good and bad killers, and has essentially no counterplay depending on killer. It's one tiny downside can be circumvented entirely.
---
Yeah, it's really the same. Totally. You're right on the money there, totally-not-obvious-surv-otp.
---
I mean if you're that good I have no problem getting stomped, but it is curious how these red-purple rank SWFs always have a Rank 18 player that plays like a Rank 1 so they get paired with Rank 15s.
---
You have to sit through the scene
---
Just cause that person is shit at killer and couldn't catch the survivors even when they were "right up in [their] face" doesn't make the survivors "bitches"
---
"Removed an issue that allowed Nurse to teleport"
---
I feel like this must be a bug, but I also feel the need to try it out so brb lol
---
Please stop. This is not funny. I know we are freinds but i just cant upvote this utter shit.
---
That’s racist
---
So they were doing you a favor but you're garbage at the game so you couldn't take advantage of that.
---
How sad.
---
Found this in a particularly painful Nurse match. During the exit gate portion of the EGC you can see I was unable to blink into the area of the exit gate. Thankfully I caught this on my stream but couldn't find any other discussion on it.
---
You could bait the Billy
---
THERE'S A LOT OF SANDBAGGING GOING ON (PS4).
---
yeah i go to school with him he is
---
Hmmmmmm
---
I like this man’s way of thinking
---
You might be hooking the survivor before th gates are open. Was the blood warden icon light up when you hooked the survivor?
---
[deleted]
---
I did in the end. We got the escape, but I still hate reset.
---
I was actually talking to my buddy who plays regularly about how much our mindsets have changed. Used to hate chases and getting found by a killer, now we run carelessly hoping to see a killer to chase us. The being afraid of killers thing is out the window but the game is still my go to no matter what new games I end up buying.
---
Let me know your results. As a console player I avoid the Nurse like the plague (Not the Plague.).
---
Your joking! If that is true I have been waiting for quick and quiet forever !
---
I wonder if paging u/Mcote_bhvr could get the team on it because this art is some of the best stuff and would add some variety
---
the face camping wasnt what was toxic
---
once exit gates are open its in the killers best interest to guarantee his kill so you should expect that 
---
the slashing on hook was toxic though as thats the killers version of teabagging
---
"Best way to fight fire is with fire" ever heard of it?
---
It’s true buddy!
---
Adrenaline, Balance, Lithe, Dead Hard, Iron Will, Urban, Mettle, Spine Chill, We'll Make It, Borrowed Time, Prove Thyself, Leader, and these are just off the top of my head. Assuming you play solo, stuff like Bond, Kindred, and Empathy is great, but I wouldn't count them as inherently powerful.
---
What exactly do killers have? A few totems that are good (with Ruin being required to actually restore the lack of balance on gens) but usually break before much value was gained, Enduring/Spirit Fury, which usually only shit killers run because otherwise they literally cannot end chases due to impotent kits, and then a few actually good perks like Nurse's and BBQ, all of which have counterplay. Like the only actual game changer perk that requires no skill to use is NOED, and while I hate NOED, it can also just not proc at all or at least be cleansed. How can you actually think survivors have worse perks than killers? Outside of Nurse, killers need perks to even be playable. Survivors need perks to win more.
---
Lol..they do not get punished more then Freddy thats complety asbsurd and you dont get the point of the power. 
---
You see a survivor, you use Frenzy and chase and use ti to get past pallets and vaults, and hit them. 
---
From there, you can choose to: Stay in Frenzy to keep up with the survivor until the stun comes in, and keep avoiding loops. 
---
Track survivors and see where everyone is, and from there, choose to go after someone else, end the power to refund the charge, or use it to go somewhere else with hte extra speed. 
---
Then, the survivor will be injured and forced to mend and then heal since they are an M1 killer now. 
---
How the fuck do you have to m1 3 times to down someone where did that even come from. 
---
Every killer has to deal with deadhard Mom and lockers so thats kinda stupid to bring up.
---
I still don’t understand how to get them...?
---
Nice. Yeah, I totally understand.
---
Not dance with me, but Windows is in the shrine, almost
---
Wanted to say this. The camping ain’t toxic, it’s the BM from him that is.
---
they increased how long he is in feral frenzy now so its much easier to put all 4 survivors in deep wound stat 
---
and with his default speed increase there is now a reason to heal against her
---
before when playing against legion there was no reason to heal as healing just lost the game for you since legion could injure everyone instantly anyway making healing redundant since her power couldnt down you in a single hit even when injured. 
---
but now that he has had his speed increased if you dont heal against her she will just normal hit you
---
One that leads too salvation
---
If you got to EGC through hatch, you've already failed your main objective of finishing gens. If you then allow the hatch to be closed, you've failed two objectives. If you then get found while opening a gate, you've failed three objectives.
---
Eventually, survivors have to fail for not doing the thing they're supposed to.
---
I was playing billy on the game and i got looped for 5 gens because i wasnt using any addons and was generally not good at the time. Ever since than ibe set a rule that if im being looped for too long to just leave and go patrol gens.
---
k
---
It’s takes 7 seconds before he can do anything to you.
---
Head On is great. It's very rare people would expect a survivor to be in love with the locker. Just give em a smack and you'll mostly stun the killer. My perks are head on, quick and quiet, borrowed time and self-care and it has been working pretty well.
---
Their quick fix was to remove the perk I wanted. Sweet.
---
Just fun to shit at legion at this point.
---
"That's racist you can't say the n-word!"
---
--The Entity
---
I prefer Joe’s costume ngl
---
I used the perk before but I got sick of the meta perks and its why I change it up and im doing pretty well with it. The perk system is why I love DBD so much. It's creative and uve got no complains of people using certain perks or whatever. It's usually their playstyle thats the problem which is cool af.
---
You are wrong. Both true3 Talent and Monto BOTH say hes useable if you evne bother to watch their videos. 
---
Even ones like TydeTyme, Panda and others agree they arent trash so your point is complety wrong
---
But you may not get a skill check in those 7 seconds. Then it's the easy hit and easy tracking, no?
---
What language uses B as a shortening of thousand? Finnish?
---
I once had a plague that downed me, puked on me for around 90% of my down time(don't know how long it is),Picked me up and dropped me 4 times, and let me leave.
---
This should be part of the base set for the Pig.
---
I hope it does I’m not brave enough to try to get any dev attention
---
“Removed an issue that allowed nurse to blink through objects”
---
Wake Up! is basically the new Left Behind in terms of endgame design. If you don't get the hatch, saving 3 secs off a gate can save you. Imo it should be buffed to 25% gate speed tho.
---
An unhook is registered as Unsafe if the survivor is downed within 10 seconds of being unhooked. This can happen with Borrowed Time, but is unlikely unless the survivor is extremely dumb.
---
(The survivor being dumb is unfortunately quite likely)
---
He doesn't teleport, he just burrows through the ground with the chainsaw
---
I dont know Ive been. Noticing this 60fps
---
It do be like that sometime.
---
I genuinely assumed it was four and had never really paid much attention to the actual length. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Well..Praobly Ghostface when he comes out. 
---
But right now i really have fun with Legion.
---
That's the joke
---
There are so many Claudettes per match it’s the easiest face to get
---
Wake up isn’t really a bad perk, just more of a noob perk cause it shows you exit gate locations if you miss them and don’t know how to find them, which is pretty sad tbh, but left behind has ZERO redeeming quality.
---
Not if the gen is almost complete. I'll gladly take a hit to finish a gen, especially if its the last one and my adrenaline procs (which wakes you up btw).
---
Hes underrated. Freddy isnt as bad as people say. Yes hes bad, but hes not the worst. 
---
His power does give stupidly good tracking, massivly slows the game down, forces survivors to fail skill checks to reveal and hurt them, and late game he is a god. 
---
It also gives him the best stealth. 
---
The biggest issue is the 7 second waiting time when survivors can do things in your face.
---
Thank you. This perk has lost all purpose now, idk why BHVR thought just upping the numbers would fix it. EGC completely nullified this perk.
---
I mean it is. Before you downvote bomb me, let me explain. 
---
The perk punishes you for doing your job. 
---
There is no counterplay. Like, whatsoever. All we can do is not hit that survivor, which is our fucking job. 
---
It has no risk at all. Slap the perk on and let it do it’s job. 
---
If you need more convincing, Ardetha did a video on why it’s bullshit and should be removed. It’s just as bad if not worse than old DS.
---
You could also swap it with Y.
---
The people still disconnecting against Legion are the ones who will DC regardless of which killer it is. They just say Legion bad to "justify" their poor sportsmanship.
---
I agree
---
oink
---
Never heard about the DLC. What where they?
---
Yes! My sandals are in the mail and I have to pick up my long socks still, but I can't rock the shorts without them!
---
Festival of blood is in the ps3 collection and on the ps3 store. First light is on ps4. Super fucking fun. Enjoy
---
I like clown a lot you can cut off sections and the survivor wont go through it anti looper his perks are nice too
---
This is fucking wonderful, thank you
---
Leatherface for BBQ. Everyone else is just personal preference.
---
Ardetha did a video why [here](https://youtu.be/4Rjgda14_u0) 
---
It’s an old video, but it still holds up. All the points he makes are the same now as they were a year ago.
---
That's when I carry them away from the gate, drop them, and let the collapse run its course.
---
Did they change the numbers with the update? I literally never have and never will use or look at this perk cause I play on PS4 so no adept bill. Them upping the numbers honestly upsets me more than them just ignoring it cause that means they saw a problem and instead of trying to fix it, they just changed a little about it. It doesn’t matter if I’m doing gens at even double speed cause the killer will find hatch by that time and the gates will be powered anyway.
---
99% of OoO users fit what I call the "McLoopyPants" Survivor Archetype. They teabag using OoO to annoy you across the map. Flashlight spam. MoM, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Instaheal. 
---
They know ALL the loops and like a cold calculated machine they will go from pallet to pallet and their job is to waste as much of your time as possible while their SWF Lackeys rush the gens. 
---
I try to ignore them. Usually they're in a SWF as a distraction because the gen jockeys are not as good as looping, and McLoopyPant's job is to basically loop you for 5 gens. Again. Ignore them as best as you can. If you can down them great but usually they manage to get hatch. Find the weakest link on the chain. Make McLoopyPants drop all the pallets around your 3-gen as doc so they can't be used later. Don't even respect pallets, eat them and they'll run out.

it takes him 7 seconds to hit you which means which adds up over time giving survivors more time to work on gens and cleanse totems so his map pressure isnt the best. 
---
once you are in the dream world he is a regular killer and easily looped. and if you run self care you can force yourself awake by failing a skill check.
---
Flair checks out.
---
Great cosplay. The fact that you're not wearing any socks was just a bonus
---
You are doing god's work. 
---
Also that is hilarious.
---
ya after 2 1/2 years of playing the game, nobody really cares about bloodpoints anymore
---
players are better at recognizing when they're wasting their time in a match and can use it better in a new game
---
This would further encourage players to hide the whole game as hatch is guaranteed and it cannot be closed on them. Then since the killer does not know their perks they just need to guess if they have it and go check gates as well.
---
If you want less teammates doing gens, than by all means add this change in.
---
By Daylight By, or for short, BDB, has to be one of my favorite games.
---
I still need the new killers and ive been playing since 2017
---
Sorry Kate, BUT WE NEED SIDNEY!
---
7 seconds to hit you without addons. Power doesn't help in chases. Can't really protect hooks and used to be garbage against an awake survivor searching for hatch.
---
Aside from Billy, Nurse, Huntress, Bubba and Clown all of them, just depends on the day
---
Myers is fun!! Have you bought him? Plus ds from laurie.
---
You're set
---
Freddy's a bit meh but they are reworking him.
---
Why not play doc? You should have him on the PS4 version and he's great at farming + simple to pick up and play.
---
Leatherface is not fun unless you want to camp people. BBQ is a great perk all around and his other 2 perks are nice for gimmick / meme builds.
---
Legion is fun the first few times you play him then you realize how bland his power is. Freddy and clown can be fun especially with their good add ons and Freddy has an up coming rework so you have that to look forward too.
---
Trapper should be a tier higher. I understand he is a low tier killer but he isn’t anywhere near comparable to Freddy.
---
nurse, hillybilly and huntress are high tier 
---
spirit, plague, doctor, shape and hag are high mid tier 
---
legion, wraith, trapper and cannibal are low mid tier
---
freddy is low tier
---
Simple and subtle memes like this are what I live for
---
The Entity stole my sandals.
---
...
---
What hath I unleashed?
---
I believe on the PTB it was buffed to 75% max at tier 3. I'm not entirely sure if it's changed on the live patch but even if it did change it's still one of the worst perks to run.
---
The dream transition can fuck him over and he doesn't have anything to help chase or down survivors, or finding them before he gets a chance to pull them into the dream world. There are a  lot of perks he kind of needs but doesn't have enough slots to take all of them, and he's hard countered by some of the most popular survivor perks in the game, such as Self-Care, Adrenaline, and Mettle of Man. To give an example, the dream transition takes seven seconds to complete, and it takes survivors twenty seconds by default to open the exit gates, so if you don't get to them with the first thirteen seconds, you just get to watch them walk out of the game without being able to touch them. Same thing goes for survivors who are trying to unhook, revive, heal, do generators or literally anything else. I wish so badly that I could pull survivors off of gens without having to put them into the dream state, like how he can pull them out of lockers.
---
fantastic perks. i to like  to enter buildings, look at something to my right, stand next to a person, and stand over a person below me
---
Hes add on dependent but agree I play on ps4 and my squad gets demolished by a good freddy! It's about the person playing them.
---
I recommend the ones that recharge frenzy faster
---
I need to play Clown more
---
I THOUGHT LEGION COULDN'T GRAB YOU OUT OF A LOCKER WHILE IN FRENZY ANYMORE. BUT IT STILL HAPPENS. WTF?
---
To be fair, that is mildly horrifying.
---
Probably why, I enjoyed walking around with no terror radius at the start of the game though.
---
Sorry, wasn’t a video. But he has said multiple times on stream why he thinks the perk is OP. I’m sure you can find some clips, but I’ll provide some when I find them.
---
People are always dramatizing like they were on a soap opera whenever they report someone, it's ridiculously funny.
---
Great idea, but make it Mechanic's or Commodious instead of Engineer's, perhaps. Engineer's is a pretty strong item for such a simple thing as searching a chest, guaranteed.
---
A lot of people have been suggesting him, and I might buy him to try him out instead of relying of splinters.
---
Wow, this is beautiful!
---
Survivors jerk off at the shack so often that I would always check there if I havent seen someone for a while. I don't know what he meant by "you always run to the shack" but really did that few times in the match its pretty normal for him to check again.
---
My other replies have explained my feelings about myers, I think he is cool and all, I just don't enjoy him as much.
---
I mean, aside from the cringe and memes, its obvious the person that wrote this article probably played for a week just for the article. I miss supervisors.
---
And misinformation. Legion didn't get a rework and never was supposed to. He just got Feral Frenzy changed here and there. Freddy is the one getting a rework.
---
To be fair, that is kind of horrifying.
---
And hes still devent and works fine without add ons. 
---
Trapper Wraith and LF dont.
---
I really liked playing pig when I used a splinter for her for a few games, but after her recent changes, her beartraps are kinda bad.
---
Was everybody else dead when you checked their loadout?
---
W/e you say man you are right im wrong blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda, I'm gonna move on with my life now, hope you are capable of doing the same
---
And Plague?
---
IM TIRED OF PALLET STUNNING A KILLER AND BEING 5 FEET AWAY FROM THE PALLET AND STILL GETTING HIT THROUGH IT BUT THAT’S “BALANCE” SO FUCK ME RIGHT
---
This is so inaccurate that it’s actually funny.
---
Really Kate’s blonde too feminine, if anyone looks like her it would be Claudette haha no I’m kidding, I’d say none of the characters look like neve campbell unless meg had jet black hair .
---
I am terrible with any killer that requires aiming, thus the killers I don't play.
---
Did you add it to your library when it was availible?
---
If you added it to the library yes, if not why the hell didnt you add it to the library
---
Love me some Englund, don't get me wrong, but Haley's was more sinister, dark, and slasher-y, IMO. That last bit is what makes it make more sense to me in a DbD setting (besides the obvious licensing stuff preventing a classic approach).
---
*nods head* oink
---
Spoopy myers is so fun man.
---
seems legit
---
I can smell the satisfactiom of that Myers
---
Problem is when you have a Legion that runs sloppy butcher and doesn't let himself get looped. Takes ten years to heal and they run around between the generators faster than a normal killer. Its hard to get progress when you are constantly mending and if you don't heal they one shot you next time they catch you working. Not my idea of a good time. 
---
Although honestly I hate Hillbilly even more.... I'm surprised more people don't. I mean he is the fastest killer and can get a one shot down from the very start of the match. He's the only killer that's ever downed me ten seconds into a match lol. Not to mention they didn't balance him for endgame collapse at all... if he shuts that latch there's no escape. 
---
I personally look down on both of them. I play Trapper myself.
---
Because i didnt know it was free at the time..?
---
Stop worrying about what survivors think. Your job is to kill them. Play in whatever way best accomplishes that.
---
t. survivor main
---
if Bite Me is the nick of the killer, your post is against this subreddit's rules and should be taken off
---
Imagine talking as if his terrible community suddenly disappeared with him
---
Can’t relate, maybe I’m just old fashioned but englund IS Freddy in my eyes, it’s not really Freddy if it’s anyone else or a different take, at least to me. Respectable opinion though, I guess the more edgy Freddy makes better sense for dbd but I can’t help but think about what could’ve been.
---
But you had PSPlus. You always add the monthly free games to the library.
---
Thanks i sometimes get mad at killers also so i hate to be toxic but your right.
---
I'm guessing you're not into movies/shows then, especially superhero ones, huh. Also, it's a hobby that many people do, nothing wrong with it. A bit weird, sure, but harmless and fun for them.
---
true, i should put fengs hair on Meg. That should closely resemble her
---
I watch a shit ton of anime lmao
---
I do
---
The game end screen always shows a double depip on a disconnect. The recent issue with not depipping on disconnect was that it would give you those pips back after the next game you played or the next time you logged in.
---
WHO THOUGHT GIVING MYERS THE ABILITY TO INSTA KILL SURVIVORS FROM FULL HEALTH WAS A GOOD IDEA?
---
I’m bite me
---
*nods in agreement*
---
I do occasionally play less serious/whacky/off meta Builds but mostly use the Perks to net me wins so I can continue unlocking stuff a bit faster because of the grind &amp; limited time to,play.  Trust me, I def wanna be less compelled to do so :x
---
Honestly, Plague looks extremely boring and uninteresting.
---
Yeah it probably would except her hair is a little too short as Sidney’s in the movies goes down to her shoulders.
---
P3 Claud’s? Probably
---

this is what we call "not a thing"
---
any prestige character i run. my claudette isn’t even P1
---
I’m the legion and the meg would always run to shack no matter what even if I stop chasing her she will run to shack then leave it
---
I’m posting because the survivors thought I was hacking when I just learned there habit of always running to shack
---
Probably, I think a lot of people or at least people I know assume that if you prestige you’re ‘better’ so at times I would say ya people may gunnel you for prestige if you run the clothes
---
WHEN KILLERS COMPLAIN ABOUT GEN RUSH BUT THEY’RE RUNNING EBONY MORI
---
laurie’s clothes are just so bright by themselves though
---
Well depends, because usually if one person cleans himself, the others tend to do the same, and people have to choose between being broken and trying to repair those gens as quick as possible or risking everyone's life in exchange for full health.
---
i mean.. these ones are gross choices but i think the one we got was fine on its own

It’s only free for a month so you missed out if it’s not in your library, it’s not that expensive though (at least I think)

Yaaaaaaaaas to Claire and the Tyrant! My friend and I were just discussing Resident Evil prospects for DBD! ❤️

---
Man..your taste is completely opposite to mine. Legion and Bubba are boring as hell, Freddy is the worst killer in the game and Clown takes a while to master. Myers is the best fun/quality balance and Plague is very fun to play.
---
Hook camp, he really didn’t like me. I mean I get why he didn’t. Everyone else escaped.
---
Big ha
---
negan one is dumb
---
Honestly I don’t understand why he has a lullaby terror zone in the awake map. 
---
It pretty much a gives away his location, I’ve had survs that I had to chase down just to sleep because they heard my lullaby and ran off before I could even get LOS.
---
Yeah, I couldn't get a clear photo of the original MTV Scream costume but... it looks pretty close xD
---
Ill see what I can do.
---
I'm going to show this to all killer main who complain about nerfed desicive... thank you! 😂
---
Joey: YOU READY TO FUCKIN’ DIE?!
---
Nea: I’m a bad bitch, you can’t kill me!
---
because they're edgy teens and apparently half of the dbd community is angsty teens who are 14 and deep
---
GAUD dammnit why am I not surprised
---
Killing isn't toxic, killing is the killer's job, just don't camp hooks and don't tunnel like crazy please... welcome to the community btw, people here can be dicks, but uh... it's a fun game, just learn to block them out, if you need help getting anythig down, I have roughly 400-500 hours kn the game total, play PS4 and PC. P3 Nea main and P3 Hillbilly main, I can teach ylu a few basics like pallet conservation for survivor and when to break chase as a killer to stop gens, moonwalking as killer, etc... just message me, and if you want even more help, ask for my Steam and we can go into a Kill Your Friends lobby. If not tho, all is good, good luck either way!
---
I try to be friendly to any killers who weren't overly toxic lately.
---
Makes me feel nice inside
---
You get a Swedish Toolbox with a utility flashlight and a defibrillator built into it.
---
Were you sure it was a DC?
---
Lots of kicks going on lately
---
So what’s this trying to prove? If you’re trying a similar thing to what Basically Homeless did and tried his hardest to get banned in Rainbow Six Siege, then go ahead. I’m not even trying to flame you, just genuinely curious.
---
All i know is it definitely isn- *stubs toe* *squeals* isnt me
---
yes you should finish it, game is bomb but really sad
---
Just don't be toxic. If you play fair and someone gets pissed? It's their problem
---

With all the tips about ignoring OoO users my slow vaulting, pallet spamming, killer main ass is about to equip it right meow.

LEGION JUST GOT ONE OF THE COOLER SKINS IN THE GAME, BUT EVER SINCE HIS NERF/REBALANCE (BUT LET'S FACE IT, IT'S A BIG FUCKING NERF) HE IS LITERALLY THE WORST KILLER IN THE GAME. YOU CAN NOT TELL ME HE'S NOT. SURE, AS A LEGION MAIN, HE WAS PROBABLY ANNOYING TO DEAL WITH THE MENDING. BUT THAT IS LITERALLY HIS FUCKING POWER. BEFORE YOU COULD USE A LITTLE BIT OF POWER TO BUST THROUGH A LOOP AND GET A HIT WHICH SLOWLY, BUT SURELY, WILL DOWN THE SURVIVOR. NOW HE CAN'T EVEN DEAL WITH LOOPS. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU HIT A SURVIVOR IN THE FRENZY, THEY DON'T GO DOWN. BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THEM IN LOOPS BECAUSE HIS FUCKING POWER IS LITERALLY TO BUST THROUGH LOOPS LIKE THE COOL AID MAN. BUT NOW HE'S ALMOST LITERALLY USELESS. AS A LEGION MAIN WHO WAS ABOUT TO PRESTIGE HIM BEFORE THE UPDATE, I WOULD RATHER FUCKING PRESTIGE FREDDY AT THIS POINT. AT LEAST HIS POWER CAN SLOW DOWN THE SURVIVORS.  
---
AND BEFORE ANYONE SAYS IT, DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE TO HIT MULTIPLE PEOPLE. THAT IS THE POINT OF HIM, SURE. BUT REALISTICALLY, NO ONE WITH A SINGLE BRAIN CELL WOULD BE DUMB ENOUGH TO GROUP UP LIKE THAT TO GET THEM ALL IN THE MENDING STATE. AND EVEN THEN, ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS LOOP YOU LONG ENOUGH UNTIL YOU GIVE UP THE CHASE.
---
LEGION MAY HAVE BEEN LITERALLY BROKEN, IF YOU ABUSED HIS POWER. BUT NOW HE ALMOST HAS NO POWER. I COULD DO FUCKING BETTER AS THE KILLER WITH A PLASTIC BUTTERKNIFE THAN LEGION NOW. THEY NEED TO ACTUALLY REWORK HIM. EVEN WITH THE HIGHEST ADD-ONS TO LET HIS POWER RECHARGE QUICKER, HE'S USELESS, ESPECIALLY ON A MAP LIKE HADDONFIELD. DEVS, STOP LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY AND TAKING DRASTIC ACTION. ACTUALLY REWORK YOUR KILLERS TO WHERE THEY ARE VIABLE, BUT NOT OVERPOWERED. LET ALONE DON'T COME OUT WITH A NEW LEGION SKIN AND ACT LIKE ALL IS FINE WHEN LITERALLY NO ONE PLAYS LEGION, EXCEPT ME FOR A DAILY. AND EVEN THEN I REGRET IT. IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. OH, AND REWORK YOUR FUCKING PIP SYSTEM TOO. PIPPING SHOULD BE SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO GRIND TO RANK UP IN, BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A PIP MOST GAMES. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEVOTION TO PLAYING AND LITERALLY HAVING TO HAVE A PERFECT GAME, EVERY GAME, TO GET ANYWHERE.
---
TL;DR: THIS GAME HAS HONESTLY BECOME MORE AND MORE UNFUN TO PLAY FOR ME THESE PAST SIX MONTHS. THERE IS NO REASON TO RANK UP, SOME OF THE KILLERS ARE SO BROKEN IN THE OPPOSITE WAY AS BEFORE THAT THEY ARE LITERALLY USELESS. FINDING A MATCH CAN TAKE 20 MINUTES SOMETIMES, EVEN IN PEAK HOURS. YOUR PIP SYSTEM IS SO BUSTED IT'S ALL I EVER HEAR ABOUT. AND DESPITE PLAYING THE GAME SINCE 2017, I FEEL LESS AND LESS COMPELLED TO EVEN PLAY NOWADAYS. THE GAME I LOVED AND SPENT SO MUCH TIME, AND EVEN MONEY, ON IS GONE. NOW IT'S JUST A BROKEN MESS. NOT EVEN FOR THE BUGS AND GLITCHES IT'S KNOWN FOR, BUT BECAUSE THE DEVS KEEP BREAKING THINGS THAT WORKED AND RUINING CHARACTERS ALLTOGEHTER. FIX YOUR PIP SYSTEM, FIX YOUR KILLERS, AND FOR GOD'S SAKE WOULD SOMEONE REVIVE FREDDY? DUDE'S BEEN DEAD FOR OVER A YEAR AND A HALF NOW. TOO BAD LEGION IS LOWER IN THE GROUND THAN HIM NOW TOO.
---
I'm not quite sure this video is the best example. He starts by saying the killer found him quickly and put him to sleep but he ran to a pallet before getting hit (but he somehow still has sprint burst ready?) There are at least 3 instances where he admits he didn't get hit because of a pallet teleportation glitch, and several missed swings "because of the player, not the character." And there seems to be pallets there that don't exist on maps these days. 
---
I think this chase would have been a lot shorter now, and maybe with a more competent player. I see the downside of having a survivor waking up mid-chase but does that really happen a lot? Enough to say Freddy's definitively the worst? 
---
I feel like I am always found and hit quite easily.
---
Probably just $19:99.
---
$29:99 at most
---
The Pig...'s Awkward Cousin
---
Ya I just don’t know if it’s more on PS4 because I got it free
---
the myers walking straight past as she was being mori'd made me facepalm
---
Holy fuck i want Negan in DBD i kinda imagine him huming eeny Miny moe  kinda like the huntress but as for the power dont know but that be amazing :D
---
I'm sure it was. She DC'd after I popped her mettle and immediately hit her again 5 seconds later because I mindgamed her. timing is too perfect to be anything but intentional.
---
Why's that?
---
Can we not admire how the devs killed legion so hard? lmao
---
Been at this for days, nothing. Did this a few weeks ago nothing. Wont matter, its too easy to use another account and start all over. Plus im bored while playing/waiting on lobby of BF1 /Battlefront 2.
---
Btw it was wasn't sarcasm
---
Ok, i have one problem with this, how did you make the puppet spot on!!
---
Hillbilly now cuts through time and space allowing for the entity to transport him far distances. Chainsaw sound will now be distorted may not be in the direction the survivor may think.
---
Wraith. Such a underused killer.
---
First question (although I probably already know the answer):  What colour was the BBQ&amp;C when you bought it?  If it was anything other than orange you'll still have to get him up to 35 before it'll start showing up in other Killers' bloodwebs.
---
It sounds like you just managed to find a stronger version of BBQ&amp;C for Leatherface in the bloodweb.
---
Hatch grab is no longer a thing. They mentioned that its removed in the EGC patch. Its a bug
---
Apparently going after weak prey is toxic and I should have gone after the difficult to catch prey first so the rest could do Gens.
---
Really don't get the logic of these people
---
I didn't make it, the amazingly talented company NECA did! I wish I had that sort of talent... I did make the harness and other things, though!
---
N O U
---
Aftercare better be in the next shrine, I actually wanted the damn perk.
---
Legion pre patch
---
Reason is that I liked the fancy knife they had and the ability to jump over pallets.
---
Really hated the changes wish they could have done something better.
---
Plauge is fun as well love spitting on people.
---
He isn't. People just say he is because they don't understand how to play him.
---
Stealth only matters when it gets you a free hit. But since Freddy has a time limit until he can interact with a survivor before sleeping them good players can avoid that first free hit by scouting out pallets before committing to a gen. Then once they are in Dream you are provided no ability to help you catch the player and you are now a killer with no power to help you catch this person. Even if you pass by other players taging them with your power will slow you down and hurt your current chase so that hurt your ability to try and slow the game down like pig does.
---
Legion sucks ass to play against. His power is just not fun or anything. Yes, what i want to do is hold m1 even more than i need to to do generators. thats very fun. It wouldnt even be that bad in my opinion if his power simply was he could vault a pallet or window a few times a match imo. I would honestly rather that than what he is now
---
Oh really? Well personally I only played the first Infamous, but I really enjoyed Second Son, I loved the different types of powers and the graphics were amazing. Storyline was decent too imo, I do hope they make a second Second Son lol
---
Ngl this is me
---
I am on it, i saw that post already, but in the coments people say its or fake, or he deleted it. And i can't confirm it, but in tweeter it seems he said he wasn't sure if there would be a survivor and a map.
---
There's a special place in hell for survivors who burn game map offerings.
---
Not to mention you can 99 heal yourself, so the downside is nonexistent.
---
thats what im hoping for. I heard he makes a noise when he stalked you similar to Myers tho.
---
I mean... that's literally what legion is supposed to do
---
Even if smart survivors notice a killer B lining for an empty part of the map, you should still do it my ruin lasts 2-3 minutes most games if i haven't gotten 2 hooks by then I lose unless the mess up horribly.
---
The controls felt extremely fluid and responsive and the graphics were Gorgeous. However, almost all of the side activities felt like complete wastes of time and the use of motion controls for gimmicky gameplay bites like spraypainting billboards destroyed the pacing. The story was also pretty nonsensical and some of the characters that the player is clearly intended to like are unlikeable due to poor dialogue and voice acting. I give the graphics, combat and traversal an 8.5 out of 10 and everything else a 4.
---
You clearly don't pay much attention if you don't think NOOB3 is just as cocky as Monto. 
---
But at least you aren't a fan of Tyde Thyme
---
Ah, yes. No Ash cosplay is complete without the Dad Shorts. Gotta show off those sexy leggies.
---
I've had it out of LOS but pretty much 5m away multiple times recently. It's still buggy af.
---
To be honest always be harmed against a 115% move speed killer is pretty bad so I don't think not cleansing is a good idea. Even still if you want you can run, I thinks its apple add ons that spawn a corrupted fountain, and after injuring every grab the corruption and go to town.
---
"Hey Billy, watch ya doing?"  
---
"Just gonna sprint between every gen on the map within 20 seconds, ya know, same ole' same ole'"
---
Like I said, all we can do is speculate. There was a post “proving” the new map would be Sydney’s house but that was debunked as fake, so yeah I don’t know what to expect. My bet is a full chapter.
---
No I do not agree with you. I feel like aside from a couple of perks, the game is pretty damn balanced.
---
Have you seen how long a decent survivor can loop a decent killer for? You have to keep in mind, even if you had one bad chase, the killer still has to catch you two more times. And 9 more times for the other survivors. That’s a lot of looping dude.
---
If you’ve played 1100 hours and you don’t know the power of loops and pallets by now, you may need to focus on improving your skill. I’m sorry but that’s the truth.
---
Same. Whenever I see Claudettes in the distance. They'll disappear into thin air and thought they are behind a tree but aren't. I hate when that happens to me.
---
I personally enjoy facing Hillybilly because you cab practice juking his chainsaw, and making overall cool plays against him.
---
There was no downside to begin with. Seeing your aura means nothing and I’m pretty sure you can avoid that with Distortion. There’s literally no caveat to the perk.
---
Frenzy sole purpose was to waste Survivor's time, not down them. I've been using frenzy mostly for free first hits and to give pressure to a group of survivors. I know their a little weaker and more boring than before, but they had no counterplay and this change was needed
---
&gt; The most obvious is the 7 second window where Freddy cannot hit the survivor, giving them plenty of time to sprint burst away to a pallet or jungle gym. You can reduce this to ~3 seconds but that requires 2 addons.
---
You can just follow right behind them while they are doing that, and mindgame the transition
---
&gt; Secondly, he’s a M1 (mouse 1) killer. He has nothing to help during the chase, so he has to rely on perks like Bamboozle and Enduring.
---
He absolutely does not rely on Bamboozle or Enduring, his shortness, foggy dream world and deceptive lunge range helps him enough with m1 mindgames.
---
&gt; Thirdly, it is so easy to wake up from the dream world. Survivors can fail a healing or generator skill check, and with how popular Self Care is its really easy to wake up.
---
Blowing up a gen regresses it by 8%, so you get that stall plus the wasted time working on the gen at 50% speed. Freddy doesnt give a fuck about Self Care as well, if they want to spend 32+ seconds healing themselves that fine by me lmao
---
&gt; The only other things Freddy is good at are tunneling, tracking (only in dream world, and it doesn’t matter given how easy it is to wake up), and stealth, none of which help during a chase.
---
Forgot the stall, which is a HUGE part of Freddy.
---
&gt; I hope that sums it up fairly well. Also I know what others will tell you, but Freddy is the worst killer in the game. He’s not completely useless, but he’s always been the worst killer.
---
I'm sorry but theres no way that Freddy is worse than some basic m1 killers like LF
---
Nah, Mcote is a pretty cool dude, I think. Makes me happy that I'm so hooked to this game
---
THIS POST ALMOST FEELS LIKE IT SHOULD BE SPONSORED BY MR. TORGUE HIMSELF. FUCKING COOL, ANYWAYS I’M UPSET WITH HOW ESSENTIAL RUIN PRACTICALLY ALWAYS IS BUT I JUST NEEDED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT SOMETHING SO SOMEONE DIDNT TELL ME TO GET THE BORDERLANDS SHIT OUT OF HERE
---
How is Huntress better than Spirit in any way.
---
I've been D/C'ing all week.
---
Nothing (mostly) to do with the killers I'm running from.
---
It's mainly showing up to a match, and finding that someone either is (a) AFK &amp; gets downed or just ain't doing a damn thing while I'm doing a deadly version of a Benny Hill skit or (b) I'm coming across a glitch or lag.
---
Yeah, I just love when someone gets downed and immediately DC's. 
---
Why play the game when you can just give up?
---
Franks mixtape would have sicko mode
---
It should go left to right in the order you put your perks in. So if you have engineer on the farthest left slot, then Light Bearer in the second, you'll find a toolbox first, then a flashlight.
---
How dare you say that name in here? 
---
Dwight. Ewww.
---
Today and everyday I attempt to DC almost every game (20+ today) I pull down ever pallet regardless of killer, and I purposely vault near players working on gens. Untill DBD stops me, I will continue to hold their game hostage.
---
Dude this is like the 15th time I’ve had this argument with you. Neither of us are willing to budge so there’s no point in arguing about it. If you want to argue with other people about it, fine by me, but I’ve made my points multiple times and I’ve debunked yours.
---
i bet you’re fun at parties
---
Had 3 DC in once match after I was about to hook them.
---
Why can't people accept defeat
---
Definitely Freddy :) 
---
He is just so different and awesome to play. He is really powerful if you learn how to use him. If you play him like any other killer though he seems weak so he gets a bad rap.
---
The best way to learn from your mistakes!
---
I expect to be only a killer, that way i won't be dissapointed by the reveal either way. If we get a map and a survivor its mostly a bonus for me.
---
Entity is Displeased and Confused
---
OoO puts the Survivior at insane risk, especially if they spawn near an ally. Since the killer can just go right to them. The sooner Surviviors are spotted the harder their job gets and OoO makes it hard to not get spotted
---
yeah i have my kate P3’d
---
Fair enough. I’m not gonna be let down if it is just ghostface because it’ll be a new killer to play.
---
FunGoose is much better and fun to watch—or even Puppers. They both have really positive and chill attitudes (for the most part!)
---
i’ll never forget the day i sung oh mandy with your name for some cool skins
---
You should be fine then, good luck and have fun my dude.
---
&gt; Go back to many of our conversations and I have debunked it. Multiple times.
---
You're the one making the point that you have debunked my arguments, go find these debunkings yourself mate
---
&gt; It isn’t “going with the hive mind” it’s saying what Freddy is, a shit killer. I would know, I main him. He does not preform well at high rank consistently and is so easy to beat, along with LF. 
---
You say he does not perform well at high ranks, but I could just say right back to you that I do well with him at high ranks. Personal experience doesn't mean jack shit. 
---
&gt; You can scream and yell “git gud” all you want, it doesn’t change anything.
---
Change your damn playstyle. Everyone calls Freddy shit because they play him wrong, some of the best Freddy mains out there have mentioned it countless times. People use double blocks (which you say you use), play him like a basic m1 killer and get triggered that he 'sucks'. Spread the pain.
---
&gt; A full team of good survivors will easily crush Freddy like an insect.
---
A full team of good survivors will crush any killer, Nurse included. Your point?
---
*Devour hope vanishes*
---
OP didn't disrespect anyone AFAIK so I don't see the issue either.
---
i know i’m 163 days late but can you link the video
---
What's the counterplay?
---
kill them all, you can play with as much “sportsmanship” as possible but they’ll still call you toxic. Your the Killer, kill them.
---
FUCKING TRASH FRAME RATE FIX YOUR GAME
---
There's a thread for you to blow off steam in case u didn't notice it. Let people report you, it wont have any effect and there's no point gettin upset with it cuz ppl are jerks. It's inevitable.
---
also when near a hook, i can hear the entity, is that only on xbox?
---
This doesn't make any sense... Beforehand, you had to go through the hurdles of being a 110% movespeed killer that was much easier to loop.
---
I never understood why tyde has a lot of hate on the community, i know he is not vey good playing but thats not an excuse
---
He’s not bad at all. Sure he has his weaknesses but so does everyone. His strengths more then make up for it. He just plays so differently that players who are used to playing the other killers will lose and he will feel weak to them. They focus on his weaknesses and ignore or downplay his strengths.
---
Brother Cope if I may add!
---
Daily: come with me i you want to live
---
First time nurse: gladly
---
Yeah. It's kind of a normal thing to scrutinize people.
---
So does that mean Wednesday is the shrine of Secrets reset day now?
---
He comes at every conversation with the mindset that Surviviors are collectively toxic and abusing how UP killers are and how Surviviors are oh so OP and abuse killers every game. 
---
He also rated Hag D tier and called people who disagreed with him uneducated idiots.
---
You gotta expect that when you have a huge presence online.
---
fucking disgusting
---
Yeah your right, it was purple..fuck me this game is a grind man lol
---
Knowing how to play him is all the difference. 
---
He isn’t really add on dependent but of course they do help as with all killers
---
Na
---
Good question, no matter how much I get mad I still play for BP
---
the orange one looks so damn cool! no joke i's buy my arch enemy just to get that skin
---
It is a stupid perk lol. I don't think even Survivior mains like it, they just run it bc it's basically the new Old DS. 
---
But...are we really gonna argue that it's bullshit that Surviviors have perks that punish us for doing our job when we have perks that punish them for doing theirs?
---
The item is actually criminally underpowered.
---
Same amount of charges as Worn-Out Tools, but repairs 10% faster.
---
Let me say that again, a **VERY RARE** Toolbox is only 10% better than a **COMMON** one.
---
I was running Small Game once and the notification went off as soon as I spawned. Cleansed it then a DC occured.
---
You'll avoid it for at max 30 seconds.
---
I must use this build for the memes.
---
Huntress is so easy to loop though, and her hatchets are so easily avoidable. She has no stealth, no map pressure, and has to abandon chases to reload. She was 3rd best killer, but I honestly think Spirit has taken her place.
---
Of course tier lists are also affected by personal skill, but I would argue that Spirit is tied with Billy in second place. Billy wouldn't be so good if it wasn't for him being braindead easy to play, and have such an overloaded kit.
---
Noob3 videos are funny tho (at least to me).
---
Besides Monto's "just a little bit" sketch, he doesn't have much going for him.
---
Same need as much as possible especially since Ghostface is coming
---
No one gives a shit.
---
This is false advertising. Nea's tits are not this big.
---
Honestly I think that Left Behind should give you extra time in the EGC at least. I mean, if you can't do generators the next best thing is having a little more time to work with aside from the standard two minutes.
---
They do, what I meant is the more people escape the bigger the bonus.
---
dude i swear to god if mr x was added he'd be the scariest killer there had ever been
---
Or at least Uncommon
---
Little unrelated to the main topic of the post but come on, noob3 is way more cocky than monto. Imo ever since the legion outrage, noob3 changed
---
OG GANG
---
There are mystery boxes?
---
Yes, and that’s why Legion is an inherently annoying Killer.
---
i don't understand "read 5:55" could someone explain pls
---
it automatically opens them when you spend the blood points on it.
---
This makes me weirdly happy
---
Yeah i have to agree with you. Legion isn’t necessarily strong just i have no desire to mend for half the game. Not to mention most run thanataphobia so deal with slow generators being injured all game. Loud injured noise is also great. Put simply, i play games to have fun, which I don’t experience against legion so why would i stay?
---
Honestly that’s a good idea, it would give you more time to lose the killer if they catch you opening the gates and stuff. I’ve been thinking of a way to change it all day and while it still won’t be top tier at least it would be useable.
---
They didn’t go far enough really

honestly negan would be cool as shit as a survivor hell if they could get the man himself Jeffery dean Morgan then that'd be perfecto

Doubt they will. Even if they do you’ll just get people who won’t try and will just kill themselves on first hook

FUCK!!! THANK YOU
---
My last two brain cells having a conversation with each other 3 in the morning when I play this game.
---
He bitches a lot and I had to stop watching him for a while too, when he would constantly complain about EU survivors. Although he's still one of my favorites because he isnt toxic or a bully to the other players. Plus he plays survivor and rotating killers.
---
I LOVED the powers but tbh the game was way too short imo, i finished it the day i got it and was even more disappointed that concrete didn’t have an ultimate? No explanation as to why either but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i still enjoyed portions of it and overall i just hope that they expand on it in the future.
---
You forgot to put a last Rancor there, but this still is a great meme.
---
Why is it so hard for some survivors to just.. y'know, leave?
---
I agree 100% it felt incredibly short aswell, honestly i enjoyed first light story wise significantly more than second son. Fetch as a character is just so much deeper and more interesting than delson imo, and her power really reflected that just as Cole’s power reflected his personality.
---
I won’t deny that we have perks that punish survivors for doing their job. Only difference is most to all can be countered/prevented. NOED can be destroyed before it activates, for example. Not saying it’s a balanced perk, but it can be countered and prevented.
---
Disagree. Legion is whatever, strong, weak I don’t care. I just don’t have fun against legion or legions power. And what’s the penalty for dc? Lose a couple of pips? That just means I’m closer to faster lobby times in lower ranks so why wouldn’t I?
---
I'd love to see doofy
---
I barely even noticed that the princess there had Nurse's face until I zoomed in a bit. Nice meme, got some nice details.
---
Well they kind already have that with two chainsaw killers that are practically the same, a nurse and doctor and then Legion and Ghostface
---
I love Frank (Susie is great too), I just can't play them worth a shit. :'(
---
I mean, a survivor escaping doesn't mean they're necessarily good, same goes for a killer getting a kill.
---
it's rough, coarse and it gets everywhere. -anikin skywalker

It still means you're trying to belittle someone that beat you

Okay but can we all talk about how badass a Prototype reboot would be

oh, sorry then. I was sure it's an attempt to shame the killer or something like that. there are many of those posted on this reddit and I always send this kind of message when I see something that might break the rules
---
I really like this idea, not an S tier killer but good job man, it would defiantly be a cool concept and be at least low B if not higher, also if the flash takes like 1 second that would make it viable. Because the lack of map control. 
---
Also, It’s a good concept given how simple it is.
---
Just remember to shop smart
---
well yes but actually no
---
SWF insta flashlight and new moon bouquet before they got retired. I also was playing as a lvl 5 wraith. Worst experience I've had in a game ever but it taught me to actually break pallets more often and bring Franklin's demise if I see more then 2 items.
---
Again, not necessarily if you have to use a one hit down killer/perk/add on or even run an end game build as a red rank killer man I can say you’re trash.
---
I would love to slap people with sex chains.
---
That's literally how most people in PVP react, nothing new there.
---
His Mori would be taking the survivors heads and putting them in his bag
---
I have found my home
---
Oh I thought of a cool concept I’m gonna upload very soon. It’s for pennywise and just as a teaser if any of you are interested,... let’s just say you turn into their greatest fear, changing gameplay for all...
---
Oh, well then where does the stuff inside the box go?
---
They really need to actually do something to prevent dcs.
---
Lol people get triggered over everything nowadays especially in this community. I just hate how hard it is to see auras on killer or survivor.
---
I've also had times where I've seen someone heal fully after it and I still can't see their aura, despite seeing them later far more than 16m away. Only anecdotal, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were bugged.
---
Last i checked rabbit’s don’t have tails that long. Blegh
---
I think the TR starts again when you start stalking, even if you are crouched.
---
You need to remove your blinders.
---
They were not right to post the killer exploit to begin with, and contributed to survivors getting shit on by killers who found out how to work the exploit. I'm glad they got temporarily banned for it. 24 hours wasn't enough, for sure. 
---
They chose NOT to post the survivor exploit because they're biased. Not because they "felt it would be too exploited". 
---
How hard is it for you to understand that? BOTH sides, survivor and killer, had exploits at the same time. They chose to highly advertise ONE, knowing full well it would be exploited, and not the other. They cared more about killers "feelings" than they cared about survivors stuck in a multi killer game. 
---
"What? Survivors are getting shit on by multi killers? I don't care."
---
"What? Killers are having unfair games where survivors only have to complete 2 gens? THIS IS MADNESS!"
---
Hypocrisy at it's finest. 
---
Free free to debate when you know more about logic.
---
Tiers up EW2: *in the distance* Hey Vsauce.
---
Jumpscare pulls you off generator: “HEY VSAUCE, MICHAEL HERE.”
---
I would swap Meg and Laurie, otherwise, accurate.
---
Username checks out
---
It's more of the problem that survivors have full control over whether or not the plague gets to use her power. Otherwise I agree, going no mither against a 115 killer is bad
---
RANK RESET IS FINE, THE PROBLEM IS HOW DAMN FAR HIGH RANKING SURVIVORS FALL DOWN, SHOULD PUT THE RED RANKS DOWN TO 6-5 IMO.
---
Better than DCing most of the time.
---
How so?
---
That means that they saw the text message but did not respond at all.
---
It was kind of a kick in the dick how DS finally got nerfed out of being a get out of jail free perk, then a month later we've got a brand new even shittier get out of jail free perk.
---
I just hate that it punishes weaker killers. Piggie. Wraith. Myers. Etc. 
---
This will force people to play Billy even more.
---
HOLY HANNAH JUST PUT ME IN A MATCH ALREADY! WTF IS THIS 20MIN TO FIND A MATCH THEN THE KILLER DC'S. I ONLY HAVE LIKE 2 HOURS TO PLAY AND I SPEND OVER HALF OF IT WAITING! PS4 DBD IS BOLOGNA!
---
It is! If they just made the auras brighter on even like the gens that'd be perfect.
---
It would be cool but I don't know what they would do for his ability
---
Not in the situation op showed.
---
"talent" lol, "so whats your Talent? I can end chases in dbd. wow...."
---
TBH if you use an Endgame build, it will mostly be for fun. You dont always want to play the same way.
---
And this game isnt easier for Killers lol, its pretty Balanced right now
---
Ps4 is included in this “Optimization”?
---
It's like he could detect your shit
---
Its like a huge combo of them, you can look at r/PerkByDaylight for some of them they have really cool stuff over there. My main one is the galaxy pack, someone combined it with something else here a while ago but I forgot who
---
What's the DPI on your mouse?
---
I mean, it was a quick edit to try to show how some alternatives could have looked so it wasn't intended to turn out great, though I'm personally a fan of the black/red mask lol.
---
So I’m 18 but still, please stop attacking me
---
&gt; what’s your talent
---
I can win chases, get the early kills necessary for map control and I can project gens without needing one hit killers, perks or add ons. But I guess if you pick and choose anyone arguments it won’t paint the full picture.
---
Ha ha ha!
---
there's ports, but i think it'd be better if they went the route if inFamous: Second Son and introduced even more abilities with different characters. i mean, imagine a final fight where we fight Heller and then Mercer jumps out of him and is stronger than ever before
---
...Well now I am...
---
Thanks, it was just a quick edit but I'm glad you liked it!
---
A depip is when you receive negative ranking points.
---
 A safety pip is when it balances out to zero. 
---
A pip is when you get a ranking point
---
Read the exploration logs if you REALLY want hell
---
You’re getting downvoted but this is a genius strategy
---
No, there is also

# Bitter Murmur
---
Why all of  sudden do I want to mori the puppet
---
If they added girls from drag race, who would be the killer?

Oh yeah I've ran that before

---
PS4 , I saw a comment somewhere on this subreddit that they get removed but it looks like that was a lie.
---
Wayyyyy better than a single use dead hard. No need to time anything. The killer will stand in place upon hit, you get a sprint burst upon hit, it takes just about no skill to use. The only penalty is you get revealed if you can heal up after using it. By then you will have sustained so many damn hits though
---
That's actually my fav wraith build. Run Rancor, STBFL, Play with your food (cloaking makes this suuuuuuuuch a good perk) and Barbeque
---
Bring in a speed uncloak and speed vault/pallet/gen break and you're busted
---
D for effort?
---
UH OH YOU JUST GOT WOOSHED XEDDDDDD
---
If you killed them by camping or with noed, YES you are trash
---
I've read somewhere on this subreddit a while back that it does but if it doesn't then it's good. Thanks.
---
I've read somewhere on this subreddit a while back that it does, if it doesn't then that's good. Thx.
---
How is he biring to okay against outside of frenzy he is a trapper or wraith not using their power...
---
Are you arguing that he is better for the survivors now or better as a killer? Because both are different statements that match your "lmao legion's way better now than before"
---
nah same shit
---
Ikr and that's the worst part about DCing
---
I respect a stealth killer because it is more fun. Being chased for the entire game while teammates don't do anything is just soul crushing.
---
Maybe just marking her territory; Just like an animal showing their dominance. More likely wanting deviousness points and being a good sport letting you go.
---
How about don't play the game at all then since you don't give a shit about your teammates and seem to cry a lot
---
Marybeth and Victor Crowley would be cool. 
---
Sebastian Castellanos from The Evil Within would be amazing.  Same with any protagonist from Silent Hill or Resident Evil. 
---
Doug from The Hills Have Eyes remake would work so well. He went through so much shit. 
---
Maybe a character from Until Dawn? Though I suppose the mountain hiker outfit for Kate already has those sort of vibes lol.
---
Young Ash skin when BHVR?
---
Better to just take the L and receive your points. Seriously they need to crack down hard on these kind of people
---
I believe it used too lower your rank but the devs wanted to stop people disconnecting because they wanted to derank.
---
It’s a school night/work weekday, and it’s fairly late.
---
This is disgusting
---
It’s usually at 24ish thousand tho even on a school night
---
To be fair a lot of people who play both killer and survivor do the same stuff as him
---
They only have fun if they're winning and go whining when their toxic plays fail and puss out
---
Said it once I'll say it again everyone
---
DC=Smol pp
---
Extremely dumb but I love it
---
It's the new decisive strike essentially. All the survivors complained that the new ds is trash and so the devs give them this.
---
My conspiracy theory is that it wasn't an accident and it was intentional
---
And the cherry on this dog shit cake is that new DS isn’t even bad. It’s actually pretty good. It’s a solution to tunneling, the thing every survivor seems to complain about.
---
More like mister not-a-garbage-teammate
---
Whatever you play mainly...the other side is better. :D
---
TBH I feel that the game is decently balanced except for full survive with friends groups. They have a huge advantage using communication.
---
So this outfit is for auric only? Well, looks like I saved up shards for nothin'
---
Do plag mains even exist? I swear I run into more freddy's than plags.
---
The meme doesnt work like that
---
I PLAY STALKY BOI WITH SOME RESPECT. I WOULD NEVER CHEESE LIKE THAT.

---
I mean usually it's with a killer I hate playing such as huntress.
---
I think for me personally I would just have the perk be totally reworked than giving the survivors a way to open the hatch again beyond what is already in the game
---
you just gave the reasons why he's boring 
---
&gt; outside of frenzy he is a trapper or wraith not using their power...   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; You can see him running after you in frenzy. Spirit you cant.   
---
&gt; You loop him like any other killer. 
---
he's basically there to get looped. he runs after you and sometimes runs after you faster, and makes you mend...thats fucking boring

---
It really depends on your rank. I've found that in the lower ranks its definitely killer sided but in the higher ranks it tends to flip and the survivors dominate the game. I main survivor and find that right around ranks 12 to 14 it tends to be more even.
---
In my opinion, the game's hierarchy goes: Solo Queue Survivor, Killer, SWF (generally)
---
A good killer will probably at least 3k most matches that feature solo survivors, but most killers (whether they are good or not) will probably only get a 2k or less when facing a well coordinated SWF.
---
I WAS FUCKING PLAYING WITH ENGINEERS TOOLBOX AND BRAND NEW PARTS AND RIGHT WHEN I FINISHED THE FIRST FOOKIN GEN FOOKIN LEATHERFACE CATCHED ME AND CAMPED MEEEE
---
I love this! My wife cosplays and I’m normally the camera man, but this is the only cosplay in which I’m considering reversing the roles with my wife. Great job!
---
IT IS DESIRE THAT CALLS US NOT FLESH
---
I agree. A while ago, I was playing against her with my brother and two randoms. We never even got the chance to cleanse because the randoms would always use the fountains.  
---
For example I was infected and hooked. They’d cleanse before coming to unhook me, becoming infected again. 
---
That plague had an infinite corrupted purge that game.
---
I want bloody young ash. Fking auto mod won’t let me link the pic 😭
---
Who is the worst?
---
Because holding m1 is super fun... Camping is an exploit. You might defend it because it-s the only way you canget a kill but it denies all of the game-s core mechanics. If you camp you-re cheating
---
This made me lol (laugh out loud)
---
AH FUCK THAT EXPLAINS WHY I ALWAYS END UP WITH ONLY TOTEMS WORTH OF BP
---
Hey guys off topic question here
---
I have the choice to either buy spirit or legion dlcs for pc?
---
Which should I choose? 
---
I know obviously spirit is a high tier killer  but I like legion after the update and if any legion mains on pc can give their opinion on the character, that would be helpful too.
---
Plus I play survior a lot less because of dcs and my mates stopped playing the game, so I don't know will Jeff be better or Adam
---
Any tips will be appreciated, thanks guys.
---
*thrill of the hunt intensifies*
---
you need to double pip for the adepts
---
Because you're in a team you selfish moron.
---
Ash mains rise up
---
The best thing you can do AS Freddy is suppress your terror radius. Red Paintbrush is his most powerful addon. It reduces his Terror radius and decreases time to fall asleep by 2 seconds. So basically by the time you detect him? It’s already too late, and you’re asleep faster than anticipated. This is why you see a lot of good ones running Monitor as well. 
---
The second best thing a Freddy can do is bring anything to increases and boosts Aura Reading. Nurses calling is a Freddy’s best friend. And his whole power is a giant BBQ without hooking people. Thats why a smart Freddy makes sure everyone is asleep as much as possible. As a Freddy Main, I will break chase with one survivor if they lead me to a non asleep survivor. Considering I also usually run Thanatophobia on him, I usually keep everyone injured as well. Anyone asleep and not being chased will either be able to be seen at all times (if they are dumb they won’t wake up), or will then be more concerned with WAKING UP. Especially if they are injured. 
---
Now I haven’t tried this next part yet but it was almost always successful before the change because of End Game. 
---
Remember Me used to be one of the most powerful End Game (before collapse) perks. A full 6 stacks of a fully level Remember Me made it take like 20 years for that gate to be opened if it wasn’t the obsession opening it. So the purpose was to spend the whole game beating the obsesson’s ass. Making it look like I wanted to tunnel, but I would only get them to DOH and then slug them from there. Once you have 6 stacks, the obsession can be disposed of because they are no longer needed. It is imperative to make sure to kill AT LEAST the obsession before final Gen is completed. Better if you can eliminate two before then but you get the point. 
---
I don’t run Ruin on Freddy. It’s one of the stupidest things you can’t run as Freddy. They are WILL find that totem 9/10 times, and all you can do is hope it bought you enough time. Remember Me was the back up, if you couldn’t finish everyone before final Gen. (and you’d be surprised because even at purple ranks I often didn’t even need the end game perk) Ruin makes it easier for people to wake up as well. They will prioritize waking up over EVERYTHING most times. 
---
I also refuse to actually tunnel as Freddy because again it solves nothing and doesn’t buy you time. Everyone usually expects a Freddy to tunnel. It’s already a throw off when you see one that doesn’t. But if you can pressure everyone equally enough, and keep them all hurt, asleep, and paranoid? They have virtually no chance. The point is to force them all to trade hooks. No one gets unhooked without someone else getting hooked in return, and it doesn’t always have to be who was doing the saving either because camping isn’t going to help you as Freddy either. 
---
As a Freddy Main, I best find myself countering Freddy by:
---
Trying to stay awake as much as possible. Unfortunately this means staying away from teammates a lot. If I see someone asleep, I will not help them unless they are definitely not in chase. Wakes g them up is fine, but LEAVE that area instantly, especially if they are asking for heals. Freddy likely saw you waking them up across the map and will remember the location. 
---
Make a decision. Are you going to dedicate to that Gen because you know for a fact you can finish it before taking a hit? Is it worth it in that moment? Are you sure he doesn’t have increased dream transition? (Faster fall asleep time) 
---
If you lost him in chase and are asleep, know that he can still see you. If you can’t wake up right away you have to choose. Shadow him terror radius to not be seen and try to wake up. Get as much distance as possible and hope you wake up in time. If he has decreased skill check odds, distance isn’t a good idea unless you’re sure he’s distracted with another survivor. Higher vantage points are always safer, and if you’re sure what direction he’s in sit on the side of the Gen that best hides your aura from him until you wake up. 
---
Again, if you lose him in chase, he’s likely going to  see and find you again instantly. You could be a dick and sandbag your teammates in the hopes he will go for them. (Not likely because most Freddy players are morons and think Tunneling is the best way) but I don’t recommend that, because at the least he will put them to sleep and continue to chase you anyways. And then you’ve screwed the whole team. So basically, stealth is key at first. And then knowing when a place isn’t safe to stay. Spine Chill is GREAT against a Freddy, just make sure you aren’t seen when sneaking away. 
---
Also remember:
---
Freddy is one of the slower killers. Like the Huntress, take him a few times around a loop if you can, THEN smack him with the pallet. His lunge is just as bad as T1 Michael, but realize that with hitboxes being so screwed right now you shouldn’t get cocky against any killer especially if the connection isn’t good. Freddy is a killer that you REALLY have to pay attention to red stain for, because a Freddy that can mind game well, is lethal.
---
Same lol
---
Woah sick art!
---
Agreed. It’s usually just a matter of making sure people are asleep. Putting equal pressure on all survivors, and ramping up paranoia. (The whole point to him)
---
And then all you need is Paintbrush! By the time they detect you as Freddy? It’s already too late!
---
Normally this sub is pretty gay friendly/drag friendly. This is a bit out of the norm...
---
Because he slows the game down too much if played well. A well played Legion can prevent 2-3 survivors from doing anything other than rubbing their abdomen for most of the match. On top of that, if the Legion successfully sets up a 3 gen the match runs on forever.
---
Everyone you listed chases just one person and applies pressure to one person and outside of Nurse, I enjoy playing against all of them.
---
Legion is typically in my experiences more similar to a 3 gen doctor or a freddy who just puts everyone into dream and doesn't chase.
---
Yeah you're not dying, but the game is long and boring.
---
And that's a good thing! All of the past 4-5 killers introduced to this game are horrendous to play against.
---
Played against him several times, almost always ended up face camping someone because they loop too well.  Fucking embarrassing for a low rank.
---
Oh no
---
What'd you make this in?
---
I just had a fellow survivor message me because he was mad I saved him from the hook twice. I believe the word was “bitchassfuckfaggot” -_-
---
_*beep*_
---
Out of the loop, what’s the counterplay?
---
No, that zthat would be your mother, and now hes coming to _*beep*_ us!
---
Balance wise, I think the game is the best it's been in a long time. But i agree that in the lower ranks it's definitely killer sided and in the higher ranks it leans a little toward the survivors.
---
I watches this cinematic again yesterday lmao
---
You-re a moron, camping, especially face camping,  should always be a de pip, and if a camper wins,  he's
---
A) better than you obviously
---
B) being fed into by your dumb team mates cause it's never your fault is it?
---
Survivors: "I'm sick of only seeing Billy and Nurse at high ranks"
---
Also Survivors: *MoM on every single character*
---
I don't think there are any mind games present on finding out which Door is going to be unlocked without clear visual indicators.
---
I don't know maybe crows or something?
---
With the exception of MoM against basic attack killers, I'd say the game is pretty well balanced at the moment.
---
Groovy
---
Trixie is actually who got me into DBD. She used to stream on twitch every now and again! Cool to see she can still get at least 1 kill with huntress lol
---
Very cool! If I tried to draw, he’d look like a blob. Lol.
---
anyone else wants some actually cool cosmetic for Frank?=\ Joe already has pretty cool outfit from start. all Frank has is trash.
---
No
---
Legion was carrying me and when end game collapse triggered, it forced her to drop me and then nothing happened (I was supposed to get sacrificed). We just stood there like this - I couldn't move and she couldn't pick me up - until they alt + f4'd.
---
In which ways? Im curious (no joke)
---
I know, honestly we should be happy that celebrities, whether they’re drag queens or not, are playing this game lmao
---
Oh fuck
---
Okay I’m fine with gay people but why trans? You’re born a certain gender you can’t change that it’s weird and I don’t see why people get hate for not liking transgender people (Im probably gonna get shit for this but oh well it’s the internet get used to hearing people’s opinions)
---
When he gets to ew3 you just hear HEY VSAUCE, MICHAEL HERE
---
What are the differences in mikes stances? Its pretty obvious from that knife that screams murder that he is in tier 3
---
Honestly I'd rather see something for Julie that separates her from Frank.  Frank cosmetics would be nice too though.
---
Not like it matters when I don't play them anyways LUL
---
You should've said "Chillin'... killin'"
---
sorry but you're literally incapable of comprehending the value of seeing whether a match is worth playing or not
---
its ok, there are many of you out there
---
if I've done 3 gens after 10 minutes and there are 2 claudettes who are immersed and hiding, doing nothing, that's the cue to go to a new match
---
nobody cares about winning and losing anymore after 2 years, after all dbd is nothing more than a glorified game of cat and mouse w/ a horror twist.  seriously, none of it matters.  this is not a competitive game and nobody really cares about "winning"
---
but what does matter?  my time and the enjoyment of spending that time in specific matches
---
I know this is hard for you to comprehend.  I know that you have never looked at time as a resource and analyzed whether you're spending it well or not in 15 minute, 30 minute, 1 hr increments.  I know that this is not something that comes naturally to you 
---
but for some of us, we're able to assess whether our time is going to be spent wisely, and if I see a match is going to be a waste of my time, then it's definitely time to gg and go next
---
it's literally that cool and calculated.  sorry it doesn't fit the narrative that you prefer.
---
***I should've known when you said No One Left Behind was a favorite there was something more to this. How blind I was.***
---
You do know huntress has an axe to hit survivors with she doesn’t need to end a chase to reload, you clearly haven’t played huntress
---
that’s it. after watching that video, that’s it. i’m fucking done with this game. fuck mcote and his shitty team of devs.
---
Pig.
---
Someone should tell them that new outfit of hers is basically anti Hag traps. They'll be buying it in droves.
---
well i am becoming a Legion main after their rework. bought Susie from start but eh playing them was unfair and not fun cause people couldn't counter. now it's perfect. and Frank is the type of guy i'd have a crush on in school, so sad i can't play him cause he doesn't have pretty outfit D:
---
read means you got ignored in text messages. Jake and bill for this meme are extraneous
---
I think the devs intentionaly made it so powerful so they make more money with the Ash Dlc
---
This is awesome!
---
I miss the days when adept meant 4k lol
---
Do it! The more Ashes, the better!
---
Thank you for clarifying! Been a while since I've gone for any adept killer achievements, so I wasn't sure what to expect
---
You clearly haven't gone up against rank 1s as a powerless 110 killer.
---
Yeah, I'm in a similar position of having gone ahead and gotten Susie in spite of not really playing them.  The main reason I'm not picking them up after the rework is because I *hate* how slowly they vault now lol.  If they fix that I'll definitely end up with a pocket Legion.
---
People just don't know how to play as him properly, they play him like an M1 killer and focus on one person at a time instead of using his power to pressure all survivors at once
---
I AM RATHER UPSET AT THE GENERATOR REPAIR BUG. I HAVE LOST MANY A BLOODPOINT TO IT. I AM ALSO ANGRY THAT SURVIVORS USE SLURS TO INSULT MY ADMITTEDLY LACKLUSTER KILLER PERFORMANCE. I ALSO GOT FACECAMPED EARLIER THIS WEEK AND THAT REALLY GOT MY GOAT.
---
Add Whispers to the mix &amp; multiple corrupt fountain whispers overlapping.
---
I only cleanse if it's evident to me that the Plageois bad/inexperienced since I know she won't be able to utilise Corrupt Purge properly if I do cleanse.
---
"And so, the wraith begun to fulfill his dream of working as a full time massager, as he had already been experienced with it in his past"
---
Then killers go off like “oh you SFW scum! NOED buff please.”
---
The killer trash talk in this game is probably the funniest thing I’ve ever experienced.
---
?
---
It's also finals season for college
---
Mosr of us like their design and skins. I legit would want to play legion just because of their cosmetics, despite them being a crap killer
---
i think there's something wrong with emblems after latest update. yesterday i got "brutal killer" but going back to killer screen i had -pip. i know that for a fact because i sent screenshots to a friend and had rank 8 with no pips before match and rank 9 with 4 pips after.
---
C) A baby reddit killer AKA YOU
---
Why the fuck... is nurses there?
---
Irked* tho
---
It just be like that sometimes chief
---
He just runs after you though to be honest. No real mindgames involved with Legion unless it’s a better player. Most just mindlessly run after you, unhindered by the standard killer’s lacking mobility...
---
It's also test week for most schools too, like erveryone here has loads of tests this week, or has already had them
---
No, no.... noooooooooooooooo
---
*You hear a chainsaw in the distance*
---
Guess I'll die
---
You're saying that like it was useful before
---
It’s fun breaking all the totems so the killers think they have no Ed
---
I never noticed just how apathetic the mori icon is. "Yep, this is my life."
---
I reposted it to share it, i dont give a single fuk about karma. But ill gladly link the video, once i have enough internet to do so
---
Funny cause 9/10 games they never break all the totems.
---
they're drag queens, not trans, there is a huge difference. either way, it doesn't affect your miserable life, so why do you care?
---
i know right?
---
I hope there is a garage door somewhere that we can get murdered in
---
Except in 2 and 3 lol
---
They aren’t trans they’re fucking drag queens. If you were truly okay with “gay people” you wouldn’t have written this trans/homophobic comment.
---
Jeff's perks are great. If you enjoy Legion, play Legion man.
---
it's really difficult now since you have to stretch the game out for a merciless victory.
---
Don't DC. Just watch some YouTube until you bleed out. Chances are the killer will depip for no hooks
---
Killer was probably trying to just get quitter bonuses without the risk of someone wiggling out/using DS
---
That's assuming they made it that far instead of running a perk like MoM, DS, any exhaustion perk, or some of the stealth ones.
---
20 second cooldown.
---
thus the reason why i said that i know there's an overlap....i've seen so many dbd/rpdr crossover memes on this sub, so i figured it made sense ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
But ehh preferences can change, so would like to know the general skill cap between legion and spirit
---
Special officer doofy
---
Never had a game with all broken totems that i know of.
---
What??
---
If you cheat, you beat your opponent... I don't understand your point at all. You should either learn English to express yourself better or learn to play the game.
---
Or...  Can you?
---
self care.. for when you'd rather waste time healing rather than complete over half a gen
---
Actually when I come to think of it I agree with you about exhaustion perks. In my post I haven’t included/forgot to include other exhaustion perks. I would like to thank you for pointing it out for me.
---
Exactly. No one ever rarely gets them all broken
---
The problem is, if they use MoM, you down them before they heal, and then they are healed out of the dying state or are unhooked and healed, it doesn’t show their aura.  Because it only shows their aura if they healed between taking a hit with MoM and being put into the dying state.  If you continue the chase with the MoM user, for all intents and purposes there are literally no downsides.  The description does mention that, but is really poorly worded so a lot of people miss it (including myself for a long time)
---
Guaranteed hatch in a perk is a horrible idea, it totally ruins the purpose of the killer being able to close it and whoever reaches the hatch first gains control of it.
---
If it's really such a big deal, run Plunderer's and hunt the chests for a key.
---
Adding guaranteed keys into a perk would be a mess - maybe, *maybe* if looting the key caused the killer to be able to permanently see your aura and caused you to be exposed, or perhaps allow the killer to permanently see your aura and be able to Mori you. Ideally you'd have a 3-4 second channel to open the hatch (that you couldn't cancel) and that you could be grabbed out of from any angle.
---
Though I don't think it'd be fair for the killer to close the hatch in a game where no one entered with a key and still have to patrol it because of a 100% key perk, especially since hatch grabs aren't a thing.
---
It was probably fucking Monto lol
---
I mean... if everyone doesn't cleanse that's basically giving plague perma-tier III evil within
---
Sick cosplay!
---
...why do you have hands for feet tho
---
There's a simple fix for that. stick to single player games or just play with people you know rather than being a giant baby who quits because people aren't playing how you want them too. Don't fucking solo queue if you can't take it. Good job being a selfish prick who ruins the game for 4 other players. You're pure class.
---
You're right; they're completely within their rights to run powerful perks. Why wouldn't they? I don't expect people to intentionally gimp themselves and lower their chances of winning/success unless they find that fun in its own right (and even then that could be argued as "winning" in their own way.)  
---
However, the exact same argument can be made for why Billy and Nurse are really the only killers you see at high ranks (minus occasional Spirit, Huntress, or Hag shenanigans,) as those killers really are objectively the best and playing anyone else really is hampering your ability to play the game effectively (honestly Nurse is the best but Billy is much much easier to play which is why he's the most commonly seen especially on console.)
---
That's the point.
---
One side can't complain about the other doing the exact same thing as them.
---
To be fair if your a Facecamper and manage to down a survivor a single time, you will indeed get your kill but you're still trash.  The two concepts are not mutually exclusive.
---
&gt;It still doesn’t lower rank right?
---
They sill haven't changed that. You can DC as much as you want and your rank will be back after a game restart.
---
Lery’s is pretty survivor sided though
---
I saw urban and I decided not to watch it
---
Did Head On work or not?
---
I love how many people are just getting triggered and missing the joke
---
This sub needs more drag queens playing video games
---
&gt;Disconnecting intentionally for a match double depips a survivor.
---
No it doesn't. It shows that you depiped but once you restart your game, the pips are back.
---
&gt; Deep Wound application shouldn't injure!
---
Woooow
---
*Used to be.  It was a great map for survivors, while it never had many pallets it had all those closed off rooms with windows that made it insane for window looping a killer.  Than like 8 months ago Devs reworked the map and opened up the rooms while closing off windows.  Greatly reduced window loop cheese while still having very few pallets.  I honestly can't remember the last time I've lost a killer match post rework.
---
The only counterplay is tunneling non-obsessions. Not perfect, since they can have it too, but it's the best we've got.
---
Knowing that they actually took the time to hunt down every dull totem is worth losing NOED - all that time the survivors lost doing it (unless they're SWF or incredibly lucky) is more than the time NOED saves you; you probably got a couple of hooks out of it, not one surprise instant-down before they all go immersive.
---
Like it really makes that much of a difference. Literally the *only* thing is they have faster movement speed. That’s literally it.
---
Apart from eventually getting banned if you DC too much and too often, there is no punishment for DCing. Not even losing rank, which was something that kept part of the community from DCing.
---
I thought I would never see this god forsaken image again and here I am looking at it
---
I hope Nick fucking dies
---
What makes you think that DCing makes killers run fair builds?
---
There’s not a lot of pallets, I agree. But the windows can still be crazy af
---
Theres so many people who DC but these kinds of posts are usually full of anti-dc sentiment. Glad to see some of the pro-dc people were brought out of the woodworks with this post.
---
Yes it does support it. It wouldn’t be picking up the WASD if it didn’t
---
Ugh. Can I have a TL;DR, please?
---
Nice... Buuuuuut... Ash has cut his own RIGHT Hand, which is the one where ASHLY-SLAHY should be put on
---
Spirit is one of the three strongest killers, in my opinion, and an absolute blast to play once you get into her.  
---
Legion is pretty meh in terms of actual strength, but they're also quite a bit of fun to play, especially since their rework, as now there's actual skill involved.  
---
The skill cap for Legion is noticeably lower than that for Spirit, though, so keep in mind that while they're easier to master, they're not even close to being as powerful.
---
Claire? No we need leon
---
Very few rooms there still have strong windows.  They removed a lot of them and opened up doorways next to them so the killer can simply go through the walkway and not have to even bother with the windows.  That map used to be one of my favorite as survivor and dreaded for killer.  Now it has completely flipped for me.  That map is a shell of what it once was.  I forget the exact patch but it was nerfed hard.  The office loop is still great and there is a nearby room that is also good that's about it.
---
Yeah EGC has been a huge buff to killers thus far.  Closing the hatch is a near guaranteed 4K.  I've found it first every killer game so far lol.
---
They're pretty gorgeous, if you ask me..
---
Almost as annoying as the hatch spawning right in front of the last survivor (when it wasn't spawned before because there weren't enough gens down).
---
Just roll with it, RNG bites killers in a lot of ways; good survivors will pop generators before you can even reach all seven for the first time no matter how hard you try or what speed addons you use, short of chainsaw sprinting on cornfield.
---
Haha thanks man I was in awe when it happened. Got another one like it the other day on doctor and didn't even have blood warden. They just kept trading hooks at the end and tried to run for the gate as a team but it was too late.
---
Anyways, both Legion and Spirit are fairly straightforward killers, and they're both all about mindgames. However, the mindgames they play are wildly different. Legion has no tools for chases after the first hit, so you have to know to chase and mindgame loops properly. On the other hand, Spirit's mindgames generally ignore loop mechanics and it's more about who can predict and react better.
---
For me, Spirit is more fun because your success isn't dependent on a mistake by the survivor. If you're legion and your opponent knows what they're doing you just have to play their game until they mess up or run out of pallets.
---
He's definitely way high mid tier. I've pushed to 6 with him and at least a 3k each game.
---
When will it be out?
---
idk about what the player count is but i thought 10-11k is like the average. I haven't checked but when I do it's usually around those numbers.
---
dead by daylight
---
it's only rightfull to ship dwight and David
---
It should be a dev stream today or tomorrow, where they will talk about Freddy rework and probably even Ghost Face release.
---
Lol, you wrote a lot for my stupid comment which which I only wrote because i just don’t like legion. Tbh it probably sucks to play as legion, but I’ll never enjoy playing against it thats for sure
---
Same, I think both killers and survivors should get some kind of disconnect penalty that blocks them from searching for another match for some about of time maybe 15-20mins and then it goes up if your a repeat offender.
---
I was beginning to suspect that, but if that's the intended interaction that's absolutely ridiculous.
---
Im guessing the PTB will be June 4th.
---
It's annoying when you're a survivor. But when I play killer I have to laugh at the DCers. Most of them even stay around for the whole game just to cry in post game chat about how 'terrible' I am.
---
That's when I thank them for the free quitter points, and they usually rage harder.
---
Yeah, this is why they started sailing:
---
Wraith / Nurse
---
David / Jake
---
Kate / Jeff / Claudette (?)
---
The OP has not yet clarified if they made any attempt at communicating their friendliness. You’re just bringing that up to make an inaccurate blanket statement about survivors.
---
Leads me to wonder who the real dense person is.
---
If you tickle the last survivors fancy teasing you at the exit gate they always slip up for you to get them. Happens all the time for me. Just gotta time everything right and catch them when they think you wont do anything.
---
If you suck like me it's killer sided :D
---
Oh no, no0b3 is cocky as hell definitely as survivor. It's why I don't like watching his survivor games as much cause it does get pretty hypocritical when he makes fun of the killer for fucking up in the same ways he does. Though, they're funny enough that they don't irritate me as much as Monto does.
---
I definitely like watching him be a average killer more than a toxic survivor
---
Survivors that use map offerings deserve the worst kind of death
---
If anything, Plague doesn't need a nerf.
---
You don't scream when you vomit, why Calm Spirit or Iron Will should affect that ?
---
it does show us joe has a great butt
---
i third this
---
big toes + weird angle
---
HAHAHAHAHA! Amazing. I’ve watched Trixie stream DBD for charity.
---
This is amazing
---
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the smartest of them all... not you. (jkjkjk!)
---
Picture was taken in a mirror. He IS on my right hand. 😁
---
I agree that he's really cocky as survivor, that's why I mainly stick to watching his killer videos over the others. Also yeah the hitbox complaints get really annoying after awhile -- it just makes me sad that he doesn't have as much fun as he used to :( I just watch his old videos a lot of the time lmao
---
i had my first disconnect as legion, a claudette was downed ONCE, and just said "fuck this"
---
Then it was followed up by the jake doing the same a little later, and the ashley killing themselves on hook... And then i felt bad and let the last claudette get the hatch
---
Nah they 100% kept those changes man.  There are walkways for killers all over the place now.  Even with those changes they didn't mess with the basement office and reception desk.  That is the lone bright spots on the map at this point.  There's a reason swf don't play Lerys offerings much anymore.  That shit was an epidemic back in the day lol.
---
Same. I just keep burning Strode Real Estate Key and making people play Haddonfield. Dunno why but I seem to magnetise tryhard Michaels so I just automatically assume this and make a joke of it.
---
DO IT! BECOME ONE WITH THE DARK SIDE!!
---
Lagswitching isnt common. Bad lag is quite common on console tho.
---
At least we get a bbq stack
---
I Sometimes want to rage quit, but everytime i remind myself that some bloodpoints is better than no bloodpoints, and that it would put my fellow survivors at a disadvantage having to go 3 against 5 gens
---
The only people I camp or tunnel are the clicky clicky runners for 4 man swf or some one who teabags at every pallet, If some one is good at looping that's my problem to improve and get better at learning to finish a chase faster.
---
Had this with a dwight recently. I go to the first gen I see, there's a dwight. He doesn't run or anything, I'm pretty close. Hatchet him. He stands still for a moment then runs out into the open. Easy second axe. DCs.
---
If you think it's accidental, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.
---
I don't know. The one time I tried to watch a Monto video I was like eff this 2 min in with his style. He's just... Annoying.
---
I find noob3 hilarious though. Much more entertaining to watch.
---
Nurse, Billy and Spirit are the top tier killers.
---
Huntress and Hag are also high mid tier/low top tier, especially when played properly.
---
The meta for what ? Killers or survivors ?
---
For survivors : Mettle Of Man, Dead Hard/Balance Landing, Adrenaline/Self Care and Borrowed Time/Decisive Strike.
---
For killers, it depends, because killers are more versatille than survivors and more builds can be good on them. But Ruin and BBQ are considered meta on almost all killers.
---
Tunneling is the most efficient way to kill people, the quicker you eliminate someone, the slower the game moves, survivors complain about it because it isn't fun for the tunneling victim, and more importantly, because it's effective. Bitching about a tunneling killer is the same as a killer bitching about survivors "gen rushing". Don't be mad that the other side is beating you by playing efficiently, git gud.
---
Anything a survivor does that directly increases their chances of escape is NOT toxic. Pallet stunning, looping, flashlight blinding at pallets, flashlight stunning the killer to save a teammate, these all help survivors win, they might piss you off, but again, that's because it works.
---
Spamming flashlight clicks and buttdancing behind a pallet/window/at an open exit does nothing but piss off the killer, and infact LOWERS your chances of escape because if you have pissed them off, they will likely face camp you, and it'll be exactly what you deserve.
---
An undeserved face camp is just as toxic as the above. Face camping doesn't help you win, instead it allows the rest of the team free reign to smash gens and escape.
---
Yeah. The emblem system has been super weird.  On all honestly I sort of miss the Victory Cube system for killers
---
i freakin love both outfits, the art is awesome.
---
MoM is strong. You can run it
---
Billy is strong. They can run him.
---
If Pyramid Head got in, what would his title be? The Butcher?
---
WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
---
Toxic videos are toxic for a reason. I've never seen Noob3 camp but if he tunnels it's cause he's playing a toxic game for the video. It's a schtick. Also ruin? How is running a legit perk a problem?
---
I read your entire post. Sickness sounds are not grunts of pain or screams, so it doesn't make sense to be affected by Iron Will or Calm Spirit.
---
Idk what going on but I kobe a lot lately. No luck offerings either.
---
I know right, I don't get it.
---
I was asked by this punk last night "are you knew at the game?"
---
I said no, and he replied with "well you're fucking terrible!"
---
This was after a game where he got downed and caught repeatedly. I looped the killer around Ormond building two times, and then healed him from the ground as I was running past. I also saved him from the hook once. He was still first to die, and me last, yet somehow I'm the bad one. Figure that one out.
---
Could be. I would choose The Executioner, The Red Pyramid or The Manifestation. He has a lot of names in Silent Hill xD
---
Self care plus no mither...
---
next to that people are so used to dcing the second it doesn't go their way there is also the fact that legion will always be remembered as the no counterplay killer and therefor people just keep dcing.
---
now to be fair old legion, new legion they both suck big time and I wish I could set the game to opt out to play against at least one killer... or have a fav list with killer, x on top and x on the bottom and the game Wil try to pick matches with that list avoiding the lower ones as much as it can
---
Ah, I forgot NOED. It's pretty popular too, especially on low or mid tier killers.
---
u/SpitsOutCereal
---
I can honestly see Jeff x Kate. 
---
Something along the lines of: 
---
She likes country, he likes metal, but the both find common ground over a love of Hard Rock.
---
Additionally they bond over their love of art, with Kate being a musician and Jeff being a more traditional pen and paint artist.
---
~~and then they go on a double date with Frank and Julie at knifepoint.~~
---
Why did I put effort into this?
---
...but you can do generators in slightly more than 40 seconds. That is so nuttttttttyyyy!
---
Hey, we are here as long there is a tiny chance of shirtless Myers.
---
Love The game btw.
---
In my case it's because when I play with friends we don't care and try to save and farm ourselves, even with campers.
---
So yes, you've killed us but your skill and strategies were petty and won't led you fat.
---
I have the right to call you a noob, you have the right to say "yea, but I killed you".
---
See you in next reset day and that's it.
---
I mean, HUNTress
---
I didn't tunnel or camp the reason the person had 4k BP was because it was a baby Dwight who I pulled of a gen in the first minute of the game and didn't know how to loop the second time I found him but no saved him the a second time. I don't go after the person who just got unhooked either
---
Ayyy now we have them YOU ALWAYS KNEW DIDNT YOU?
---
Lol you really shouldn't be considering Legion.
---
Myers or plague I understand are fun to play
---
This was my immediate impression of him to be honest. I've grown real tired of hypocritical and hypercritical content creators in this game in general. It's become a default response to insult, belittle or call the killer/survivor "boosted" if you ever outplay them, or vice versa. I get why people do it, Youtube/Twitch kids eat it up, but there's only so many times I can stand watching that unsportsmanlike behavior. 
---
On the other hand, lots of content creators seem clearly frustrated and bored with this game because there's only so many constant hours you can stretch out of it, so I get why that frustration seeps through as indiscriminate complaining.
---
Same. I don't BM, but I get camped a lot if I lead them on a multi gen chase. Or at the very least when they finally slap me down they nod furiously, and then smack me on the hook a few times. Talk about angry.
---
&gt; I guess if you're not creative, have no hobbies and zero interest in costume fabrication and sourcing you would see it that way, and that's understandable to a certain degree (especially when it's apparent that you're ignorant to it) but why comment thinking I would care if you think it's "weird"?
---
Just gonna leave that right there
---
That just gave me an idea that survivors don't see the exit gate auras after the generators are done.
---
ahh that explains the death threats
---
Wait, was that in an actual UNHhhh episode? Or did you edit dbd into the video?
---
This game is very toxic, just ignore comments. No matter what you do, on both sides, you'll be trash.
---
Just play and have fun.
---
dead game right?
---
You'd think so because he constantly walked around with ~8 traps unplaced in any Hag games he played, but sadly he was 100% serious.
---
MoM good, use
---
Billy good, use
---
MoM good
---
Billy goood
---
Do you run spine chill? If not, run it and you'll quickly understand
---
This. Just want to add, plague is around mid tier, and legion is a bit lower, but with the recent changes, it’s too hard to assess where he is at. Also for killers, apart from ruin and bbq, enduring and spirit fury is used on a lot of killers too. 
---
But yeah, just follow what he said
---
INCORRECT
---
Jesus, I love Trixie. And I love DBD, never knew she played it!
---
What a disappointment of a perk
---
No need to quote it, it's right above in my comment :)
---
I stand by whay I said. Most people I have spoken to who seek to be "against" or that don't understand cosplay fit into what I said, so I stand by it for the most part, but you can still understand cosplay without liking it - OP's comments kept clarifying that he didn't understand, which is why I've said what I said.
---
No need to blow it up and keep this going.
---
This is 100% facts! You told no lies here. I love it if I escape after this and meet them at the door :) lol
---
Holy shit, you have this down to a science lol
---
Someone send this to Monto NOW
---
I kind of wish none of the killers had terror radius but instead had certain sound cues when some of them got close(such as moving grass etc.)
---
&gt;Restart? As in, alt+F4 from the game after you D/C? I've never really intentionally D/C'd so I have no clue
---
Yes, as in closing the game completely and re-opening it.
---
32 meter STAND!? NO ONE CAN DODGE THE EMERALD SPLASH!
---
They are all your main. A main is someone you play more then 80% of the time generally, but once you have three or four characters you only play, then they are your mains.
---
If you play more then 5 people regularly then you main no one
---
Ah yep very good points. Wish more killers punished sandbagging. Mostly they just down the person who got sandbagged, and the asshole gets away.
---
Those thighs are so thicc this probably belongs in r/dbdgonewild
---
There won't.
---
Peanits said that there was going to be something yesterday, but it was delayed to today or tomorrow.
---
I doubt it'll be a stream, but rather a forum post, like we got last month.
---
It's basically guaranteed to give us info on the Freddy rework, the anniversary event and other details about patch 3.0.0. I'm unsure whether we'll get anything about Ghostface, since the announcement was originally scheduled for the 28th. However; since the leak, no-one has tried to keep it a secret, so you never know.
---
Hey that's legal somewhere
---
I had no idea this subreddit existed, thank you for enlightening me stranger!
---
I just finished watching it. Katya is so into DBD haha.
---
again, none of this is about "losing" or "winning".  do you have difficulty with reading comprehension?  this is about whether the match is worth the extra 10 minutes to complete or not while immersed claudettes hide in bushes
---
I've won hundreds of games on dbd, I've lost a ton of these too.  this is over 2K hours of gameplay.  
---
you're upset that my argument is 100% correct, even if you dislike it.  you want to push some kind of narrative that disconnects are all about emotions and ego and whatnot, but you can quit wasting your time, because it's quite futile
---
and yes, apparently this is brand new to you, but you can have time management skills while playing games.  it doesn't only apply to actual productive, non-recreational activities.  you can thank me for educating you on this new dimension of thought later
---
so no, I'm gonna keep doing what I want, and there's nothing you can do about it.  how mad does that make you?  apparently very mad.  welcome to being incapable of controlling what other people do, and just like in real life, I'm sure you'll find a way to adjust.  or not.  do as you like.
---
Pig=upvote
---
I'm curious as well because when I played back in 2017-2018 (before the huge update) it was always kind of survivor-sided. I watched older videos and they never seem to make me go "wow killer is super duper op."
---
self care, for when you like being able to stealth and take a hit in chase but can't get a teammate to help you out
---
Ok the first one I could understand, but the second one, really doctor? Open your eyes.
---
Fookin love Fungoose watch him all the time!
---
I remember when he played against a Huntress, he stunned her with a pallet, he started to Self Care in front of her, she winded up a hatchet, he missed a skill check, was hit by the hatchet and then DCed. I mean, why you DC ? You were the morron who f*cking Self Care in front of a Huntress, what do you think that was gonna to happen if you do that ? Especially because Self Caring increases your hit box as survivor, so that hit was legit. So he payed like a rank 21 and then he DCed in that match.
---
Spine chill for sure is a good perk against any stealth killers
---
You. You are not worthy of the name ~~Sub-Zero~~ **Ash**.
---
If it's less that 5% it shouldn't penalise at all, at that point it's punishing people who clearly AREN'T camping, just put a threshold so that once it ticks over -5% it starts penalising from there.
---
Edit: Plague was not in this list for some reason, she goes to B aswell.
---
WHY THE FUK DO I GET YAMAOKA ALL THE TIME, I HATE THAT MAP AS KILLER AND AS SURVIVOR.
---
Background:
---
I was playing earlier today on farm with Michael and I ran into a “toxic” swf. All ran adrenaline and another exhaustion perk, mettle of man, and others, you get it. I got really pressured and I lost my Ruin and Haunted Ground right off the bat (I run HG because I have no better perks, just prestiged) and I managed to get everyone single hooked by the final two gens. At the last gen I had two hooked, they got saved. I proceeded to slug them because I had no choice. Three down, and one guy is left injured. Fails the skill check. I go up to his gen and see the fucking jake right there. Two seconds later, four fucking adrenalines. That jake had a key, so he found hatch mid-chase and I got fucked, then the rest left through the gates.
---
You best believe I got hit with “ez” in the postgame chat.
---
If you are looking for other streams my suggests are:
---
Fungoose: he is a DBD educational stream and super good and very positive has like 6000 hours in game?
---
Umbra: she is a huntress main she has like 2000 hours almost all on huntress it’s insane to see some of her hatchet shots
---
Morf_UK: sure weird and funny dude and his voice is awesome. And he is a fog whisper 
---
They are all DBD streamers that are on often!
---
Katya should play the plague 😂
---
Moo.
---
I literally go multiple games in a row in witch I make it clear as hell that I’m “farming” so I can battle this stigma. Not all legions wanna win, I for one just wanna have fun.
---
Imo the Halloween chapter was the best DLC hands down. As someone who had bought the game at launch I honestly never expected DBD to become the crazy collection of licensed characters it’s become, so when Myers and Laurie got announced I was shook. Plus the map was so different from the rest that it was pretty jarring (in a good way) at the time.
---
The spark of madness chapter is a close second, though.
---
I had a game earlier today and first I cleansed haunted grounds, then I did devour hope, my friend got thrill of the the hunt, I got a dull, and THEN found ruin last, of course. The killer dced right after we got them all.
---
Looks like something Shadbase would make. Only with way too much clothing.
---
how does that corner prevent you from hooking them??
---
Spine Chill doesn't trigger on Tier 1 Myers; he's immune to all Survivor detection perks and aura reading.
---
That many toolboxes sound like a genrusher's wet dream.
---
They were at the farthest spot possible from the closest hooks, so I couldn’t hook them. Still don’t know how I was able to hook Nea before she wiggles out.
---
Where's the link?
---
I had a Dwight point at me in the locker to the killer to try and get him to go after me. It didn't work. He got hooked and I ran over, tea bagged him, and ran off. Then him and his friend proceed to chase me around the map blocking me until the killer finds us. They both get downed, DC, and I get the hatch. Ha! God I hate rank reset.
---
&gt;A good killer is in the power role at this point. It takes a depip squad level SWF to challenge that.
---
Not really... I am a solo player and the average killer still struggles to get kills if you have decent teammates.
---
The only time survivors get destroyed is when you have players dumb as a brick who won't work on gens when they can clearly see the killer busy with something else. 
---
It doesn't take a depip squad. You only need two decent loopers, two players **not** idling around the map and unless the killer is nurse, he can only catch survivors so fast when all pallets are still up.
---
Psn itskelvinn
---
I don’t know why but that cosmetic actually creeps me out a lot. Maybe it’s the pale pig head and hair covering the face.
---
You have good taste, OP
---

Why does it matter what transgender people do with their lives? It doesn’t effect you? You’re not trans so you’ll never understand the struggle and the feeling of what it’s like to be trans. This is almost as stupid and ignorant as asking why someone’s gay, why someone’s black, or why someone is the way they are. I’m transgender and we were born this way and we can’t control it. I can’t believe people are actually this fucking dumb. Also, drag queens and transsexuals are two completely different things.
---
I’m only rank 12, so it’s all good. I’m a killer main but I’ll play survivor. I also stream on twitch and have a mic so we can communicate if you want
---
Also, all the guys going out of their way to say how disgusting transgender or how gross gay people are, are the ones who want to suck a dick but are repressing some types of feeling.

DBD matches run the full spectrum from enjoyable to absolutely goddamn miserable. The core gameplay is surprisingly fun for what is essentially competitive ring around the rosie, but a lot of the specific content is either painfully unbalanced (Haddonfield, iridiscent heads) or just asstastically unengaging (old Legion, three-gen doctor).
---
Legion taught people that they could usually identify the miserable matches in the first thirty seconds if they were paying attention and bail on them. I don't see any easy way to reverse that realization. You can't put the mind-genie back in the thought-bottle.
---
DBD needs a massive balance pass to address the underlying issue. Rework Haddonfield, Bedham Preschool, Crotus Prenn, Yamaoka Estate, maybe Lery's. Nerf Nurse. Buff a bunch of the more basic M1 killers. Nerf a bunch of the stupid bullshit that's supposably balanced "because it's rare!" like iridescent heads, mori's, instaheals. Also if DS needed nerfed, and MoM is just DS but better, why the fuck aren't we nerfing MoM? Oh yeah, duh, because BHVR nerfed DS while MoM was in development and they realized they couldn't have two free health state perks. They didn't nerf it to actually balance the game, they nerfed it to sell DLC without completely fucking their game. Jesus, what assholes.
---
Once you have the underlying issue addressed and the game produces less matches which are "absolutely goddamn miserable," implement nontrivial punishments for DCing, or nontrivial rewards for not DC'ing (they're effectively the same, but presentation can affect people's opinion). You can't punish people for DC'ing before you fix the bullshit that makes people want to DC, because then they'll just kill themselves on hook or AFK or stop playing the goddamn game entirely. No one is ever actually going to see iridescent head huntress and think "this is fine." If they stick through that game, it will be with clenched teeth and a heart full of rage.
---
Balance the goddamn game, then offer something like a stacking +15% BP reward up to +45% for consecutive completed matches. Voila. We did it, reddit. We saved Dead By Daylight.
---
No one makes it to EGC for me so I can’t relate
---
Pig = Upvote?
---
Yes, no, yes.
---
I'm making this my computer wallpaper.
---
Eeeh, they'd be pretty screwed on maps like The Game, Lery's or Spirit's map.
---
Urban evasion and playing stealthy to avoid him building up his stalk. Never bodyblock unless he is holding a survivor or try to take a hit for another survivor, builds stalk really quickly. Avoid waiting at pallets for stuns and lose line of sight every chance you get.

Spine chill is a soft counter but it won't detect t1 myers.

---
You played yourself by using all the hooks in that corner (just like how can play themselves by leaving a 3gen). Pay attention to who is on deathook and avoid putting yourself in that situation. Exploiting a bad play on your part does not make them toxic.
---
Allow you to open the Hatch and decrease gate opening time
---
Hex totems almost always spawn in same spots &amp; dulls spawn in a formation.
---
Woah haven't played this game in so long. But how did pig go from an around an A-B killer to the best? Did she get a huge buff?
---
This needs to be added as a cosmetic.
---
Because mending every 30 seconds is not fun.
---
Shit, that's farther than when they usually spawn when I play it.
---
Oh right I forgot.
---
Legion is in no way, a weak killer now. You're not giving the movement speed change enough credit. Legion is now a killer who can get a free first hit and then chase a survivor down and m1 them. A good Legion player is going to be more effective than a trapper at high ranks.
---
I KEEP FORGETTING. Ugh, please fix this already!!!
---
Yes, but this is about the 8th patch in a row where they've promised it 'next patch.'
---
If I had the money I'd buy BHVR and bury this fucking game in the Mexican desert. You cannot expect the devs to fix anything when they can't even keep their updates bug free and then also refuse to fix said bugs. Ranks randomly reset in either direction since Plague's update and we still have infinite loading screens, since 5 months now mind you. They're borderline braindead to not catch onto those things. Either that or they simply don't care and rather tell lies like "oh lol our engineers are onto this pesky problem lol".

you are doing that too much. try again in 4 minutes.

hook* there was only one hook closer that was used. That’s ridiculous to purposely not use hooks by corners.....
---
What rank do you play at? I know for dam well theres no totems at the end for me.
---
Because just like Hotline miami's Jacket, they're easy to cosplay :v
---
Seeing em play dead by daylight was so unexpected and such a delight
---
I didn’t play myself because I didn’t hook the other two survivors by each other in a corner like you assume I did. They decided to prevent me from hooking them instead of actually attempting to escape, which they could’ve done easily if they split up/stopped going to the corner. So, yes, they were being toxic.
---
What the fuck is that thing? Is this the feminist trend
---
I see double gens on that pier often, god help survivors if a 3rd gen is within line of sight.
---
Use Billy's mom
---
As a M1 killer main I don’t see the problem with MoM. If it does get activated I know I will have an advantage into finding them later
---
Legion was changed, but the scars still hirt
---
I didn’t play back in the day, but I’ve heard players like Zubat and Pug reference this many times. They’ve clearly stated survivors use to be OP but good killers “made it work”. They’ve also said this era is the most balanced it’s ever been for killers.
---
Obviously that’s not verbatim, but you get the point.
---
He is definitely better than before but i think he needs some small changes, like not draining your power with an M1 attack. That was relevant back when frenzy could down people, but now it can't
---
Billies mom has got it going on!
---
something something something
---
I'm (not) in love with Billies mom!
---
Spamming vault when they aren’t even being chased so I’ll get spammed with the noise notification. I get they want me to chase them and aren’t necessarily trying to be toxic, but it’s annoying and obnoxious. That’s a first class ticket to tunnel city in my games. Delaying a game just so you can teabag me. Like, I’ll see that the match clearly has ended and I’m nowhere near the exit gate so I sometimes I won’t bother. Then 2 minutes later a survivor still hasn’t left. Thankfully EGC put an end to this. But ya stuff like that.
---
But yea I feel ya. I’ve played games against killers that are just toxic for no reason. Yesterday, I was just playing casual as hell and someone hooked me and M1 spammed me on hook until death for literally no reason. I think some people just want to be dicks and it doesn’t matter if they play killer or survivor.
---
I bet Microsoft doesn't think so
---
Refused to participate in normal gameplay. They weren’t trying to complete any objectives. No gens, no searching for the hatch, no cleansing totems, etc.
---
This Put Me in the Dying State
---
They should make a infamous SS costume for Frank, shave his head and everything. That’s would look nice.
---
i think that they were staying in the corner for a while cuz birds
---
so right when the game started they did what was in the video?
---
dont put that evil on me, ricky bobby
---
Because you screw over your teammates, asshole
---
You, I like you. Fellow seeing matches through until the end player.
---
I saw toxicity with all the hook bm you did to the first survivor lol.
---
run Adrenaline and do gens, self care is just waste time you could have spent doing gens and escaping. The longer you make the game go, the more you increase the odds of the killer winning. 
---
but you do you, boo
---
id not call that toxic honestly only thing I call toxic is teabagging and sandbagging but that is just me
---
&gt; your whole post is totally off-base and assumes that by default I care about other players' experiences in dbd
---
Oh, sweetie, everyone who read your comment could see that your next response would be "I don't care about other people." Well, I mean, they technically couldn't *see* that, since they were rolling their eyes too hard over the amount of smug intellectualism oozing out of your every word. I mean, are you aware of how obvious it is that you're a teenager?
---
Either way, have fun coming up with some blasé comeback to show us how aloof you are, while you keep desperately trying to get a rise out of someone to justify getting downvoted into oblivion.

---
Is that the new killer on the left?
---
The real question is which Pig head should I get, the quandaries of life.
---
Yes 100% the term in regards to DBD would be Line of Sight.  For example to avoid Plagues Vomit simply break line of sight.
---
Farming isn't fun though...
---
It was effective at ending hatch standoffs
---
ok thanks
---
I never knew I could activate Adrenaline whenever I wanted when I was injured.
---
I am between 1-8 everytime. I dont think I've ever had a game were all my totems were cleansed.
---
Ive never heard it used for totems before, but they could be asking if anyone has line of sight active hex totems if you are in coms.
---
What's that icon on the box?
---
&gt; Score 4k for doing all 5 gens, What game are you playing?
---
uh, the current one that's buggy as fuck per usual and doesn't fucking register points which is there's a sticky at the top of the main page telling people to gen tap at 99% to make sure they get their points otherwise you get stuck getting 4k repairing all 5 gens. 
---
That game.
---
Iron will could help you with that
---
I think it's pretty toxic towards their own teammates when they purposely go afk and essentially force the others to play a 2v1. Then they go to the corner to waste as much time as possible and DC in time so the killer doesn't get hooking points.
---
This is absolutely not the place to study my friend but I wish you the best of luck nice meme :3
---
I was assuming they only did that when it was only them honestly
---
Story of my life as a survivor, guaranteed at least one, if not all fellow survivors gon dc on meeee
---
Same I play the matches no matter the killer because it doesn’t matter who they picked.
---
Yeah, might be. I assumed the other way because they already had the circling crows at the start of the video and that takes quite a while of idling.
---
The pink one so terrify.
---
Hm, i was rank 3 survivor and rank 3 killer before rank reset and usually when im playing survivor my team always cleanse totems and when im killer usually survivors cleanse the totems. But again i feel like I usually go against SWF so maybe thats it.
---
I agree that it shouldn't be too easy to re-open the hatch, even with a perk. There should always be more incentive to finish the generators.
---
So maybe a the key only spawns in the basement and die killer gets a noise notification or even a "perk debuff icon" (the red ones like Thanatophobia) so he knows he has to guard die hatch as well. And the channel to open it should stay too I guess.
---
living up to the Kate main name
---
Omg I forgot about him that would be great also with the hotel and his wife :o
---
Thanks I was playing legion (Not in the trash way) but now he's nerfed so I'm gonna try doctor again he was always fun! :3
---
It’s the same person spamming pig threads non stop. No rise in popularity at all.
---
Yea, i felt it probably was a little dark. Thanks.
---
\*shows leg to get upvotes\*
---
Maybe a rework would be best. It would have to be geared towards the endgame, maybe no scratchmarks anymore. Or no light at the exit gates showing the progress of opening anymore
---
It is for me if the lobby is having a good time with it.
---
oops
---
I think they're a lot easier to play now, just on the basis of the 115% movespeed. The problems I have are:
---
1: The power isn't useful mid-late game (unless survivors have healed eachother). I don't find it fast enough to justify the stun for map traversal and there's pretty much no point in hitting an injured survivor. Also the power feels much more clunky with how slow you vault and the long stun time.
---
2: Most add-ons are completely useless. All of the pins are useless aside from the broken one (but even that is very niche) since you could just use sloppy or third seal instead. The iridescent button is better but it's mostly for unnerving builds since the vault speed on pallets is not great. Frank's is utterly useless. Combining cold dirt and Joey's makes your stun the same length as before the changes (3 seconds) so they could be useful. The rulers are good for when you don't get every single survivor in your first frenzy but aside from that aren't the best.
---
Maybe it’s time to upgrade your connection ?
---
all that tea bagging made meg thicc
---
wdym legion is better than before.
---
Like many things in this game it’s just RNG. I’ve had cases where they are on polar opposite sides of the map which makes it really unfair for the killer. An easy fix they could do is to change spawning area distances.
---
I don’t think there’s any increase, just Pig mains are weirdly committed. Oink.
---
I really enjoyed Montos perk build videos but I unsubbed when he started posting the Super Toxic series as I’m dead against influencers glamourising toxicity and using it because it’s popular even if it’s shitty behaviour. 
---
Kind of unrelated but I was really surprised and disappointed to see certain Fog Whisperers still promoting themselves as Toxic in their stream titles and it makes it seem like the devs are fine with toxicity when the people endorsed by Behaviour as representatives of the game. Sad times and doesn’t give me hope that things will ever get much better :’(
---
I like his base movement speed increase and the fact a miss means you lose frenzy.  I just haven't gotten used to him maybe?  Like I feel that deep wounds is just overall weak and he's basically just a basic attack killer with an occasional speed boost.  But before I felt I could pressure people more with the timer.
---
Aaaah. Now I see it. 
---
Thanks.
---
You got a source on that? I‘m curious on when they said that.
---
Me too bröther. Me too

Maybe I’m weird but I don’t consider him one to be one the classic slashers like most. He’s kind of like Pennywise from IT where he’s an adapted character from a novel. Similarly he doesn’t function as a normal slasher (chasing victims with weapons). I’d be interested to see how they could make him fit into their formula but he’s definitely not one I’d say they should prioritize.
---
DC’s bizarre adventure
---
It was never meant to stop tbagging
---
I'd say noeds pretty balanced. Strong effect that has no effect majority of the game and can be destroyed. You run a risk, you get a reward.
---
It's random, just like every other perk.
---
Getting hit with a bottle makes no noise, maybe you didn't notice it? Getting gassed blurs the screen so you may not have noticed the bottle.

---
Use We'll make it folks! Fantastic perk. Love just super speedy heals on not only the dude you rescued, but also like 2 other people afterwards.
---
I'm sure haunted ground purposely spawns in more obvious spots. I've ignored hex totems before because they've been just too easily found...
---
Go commit Reverse Bear Trap.
---
It does. DCing (presuming you go into the menu and click "leave game" Gives you negative 2 pips
---
*shrug* That's why I don't bother watching any gameplay footage from people trying to take it serious. If I want to watch serious high-skill gaming, I'll take to a game that has an actual esport scene.
---
ah maybe that was it. just sucks cause I have like 76k but nothing to spend it on
---
This happened to me too, but I was the killer in that game, I saw the survivor on the ground and rushed over so they wouldn’t die (I got absolutely STOMPED and I got everyone else was already out might as well) so I picked him up, then this happened. I couldn’t open the second gate, couldn’t kick gens (obviously) so I had to close application.
---
I'm guessing you watched scary movie and not scream.
---
Aaaaand it's pretty damn useless against Killers who have 2 different types of attack. Think of Hillbilly who is popular AF.
---
The broken status effect is so crappy though. Like, whats the point of breaking someone for 2 minutes if you should be ignoring them once you hook them anyway? And people would still just complain because no matter WHAT the add on is, if its ultra rare its busted in peoples eyes/ a certain combo thats busted.
---
She'll stab you in the face.
---
AFAIR, they've never said premium:unlockable ratio will always stay at 20:80. I think that was only for an initial store release.
---
This is true. too bad hes boring as fuck and now just wraith. Too bad they nuetared another killer and just made them a boring M1 115 killer as their way of "balancing" them.
---
My boner is very confused.
---
I'm just glad the reason people use the corrupt purge is no longer "Punish those that dare to have Dbd at a somewhat high volume for a more immersive gaming- DUUUUUNNGGGGGGGGGG"
---
So you're surprised I respond with an intelligent and reasonable answer in a debate when you say he needs nerfed harder, joke or not? I can see where your priorities lie. You're probably someone who just waits to be found by the killer in the exit gate or at the hatch just to teabag until you're hit out. If you don't have anything to add, just don't add anything at all. Don't get offended or something when I actually respond like someone having a debate just because you're just out to talk shit about killers.
---
Botany Knowledge, We’ll make it, blue medkit, speed add ons.  xD. Knockoff insta heal
---
No point in prestiging honestly until they implement something other than bloody clothes, the Bloodweb doesn't imporove at all. Stick with it and dont presteige unless of course its something you want to do
---
I rarely camp but I still am a big fan of tunneling. If you're one of these five people, I will tunnel you.
---
One. You farm your team mates. Two. You want me to chase you and try to get my attention the whole time, looking for me etc. Three. You're that rare shiny one of a kind survivor who is super good at everything, I love a good chase and will become obsessed, craving for the chase that most of the community can't give me. Four. If you're that flashlight guy who blinds after every pallet, tbags after every pallet. Enjoy the taunt and points while you can, that light will give out. Five (I'm super toxic here). If I see you play Dwight. I will make sure you die. I Tunnel and camp to get rid of that guy asap
---
In this pip system? Livestream or it didn't happen lol.
---
Of course &lt;3
---
Bloodwebs are random, there's no way to say for certain which way is "cheaper". I feel like if you are using store cosmetics or don't like prestige outfit, then prestiging is not worth it. Especially if you don't play like 30+ hours per week.
---
Not that pipping as killer is impossible, but when you're playing as a killer like Legion, oof, I wouldn't care to.
---
Could also be
---
My teammates looking for hag/trapper traps
---
The survivors looking for *my* traps
---
Just going with level 50 0p is much much more efficient, honestly the slight boost for prestiging your characters is pretty much non existent, only reason to prestige is for the cosmetic
---
It's that long? Holy shit. I just ballparked 15 and assumed it was too much. But damn, that's absurd.
---
There's no way to put him in the game without a big patch that you'll have to download.
---
Okay but iron maiden and make your choice on myers
---
What's the plan here?
---
"Don't DC just sit on the ground for 4 minutes while other people play the game"
---
There was a leak for Ghostface as new killer thats why there are so many memes lately about Ghostface.
---
Under 100 hours
---
Daaang I want to teach xD
---
Let’s sexualise everything yeeeeeah !!!
---
And to perfect them it took about 50 hours
---
Wow! Good job dude.
---
Monto DC's, him and the other youtubers literally caused it. They made it ok.
---
Oh shit oh fuck
---
You accuse them of being incompetent, but I've yet to see that in action. Mistakes, as big as they are, are still mistakes. They are human beings and I'm sure you're no better than them. Come back when you made a game and never made a mistake in your life, then you are allowed to call them incompetent.
---
I mean, ffs, there have been steam games that barely even worked, games way worse than DbD by a million magnitudes higher and they still had the audacity to charge money for their games or didn't even bother updating or fixing anything.
---
It's for the joke.
---
A broken key doesn't unlock the hatch, but he has a hatch addon for it. His other addon is worthless to run on that key with the other addon. This is a joke
---
It's easy points and I'm trying to get his Deranged Pursuit achievement. I never tunnel just because the whole idea of mend is to stall. I use it to stack Thanataphobia to buy myself time. Even if I get trashed, The Chaser, Gatekeeper, and Malevolent emblems are usually gold + due to group and solo pressure.
---
Legion is a high mid tier pick, I'd use him over Trapper and Wraith any day and I just started using Legion again after they fixed him. He requires a more braindead skill set and people don't understand that.
---
Maybe if she wasn't murdered by her own son
---
If they claimed it to just be a massive bug update, it might be plausible. I'm sure some wouldn't fall for it, but it would get others
---
No they shouldn’t be completely safe but when the killer gets stunned no hit should go through. That’s just what I think tho
---
Best comment.
---
I’m sorry but how could you possibly see a problem with this?
---
There is no plan lol. I just prestiged him so that's all I got at the moment
---
&gt;Blue Medkit
---
I mean there were still five gens left
---
I honestly don't watch him, but if he's like that it's pretty stupid. I main killer, I am biased lol. When I play survivor and die I just blame myself
---
I did notice that 2, and I do like the idea, and it is going into the update "script", or whatever you wanna call it, but thinking off making it something like this:
---
Perk #2 Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
---
You become obsessed with one survivor. 
---
When you can move your killer, the obsessions aura is shown to you for 3/4/6 seconds.
---
When you hook the obsession, or the timer runs out, 40/60/75 seconds, a random player will be switched and become the new obsession, and the aura will be shown for 3/4/6 seconds. 
---
After the obsession has been hooked, and a new one is chosen, or if the amount of seconds are up, that survivor will get reduced action speed for 15/20/25 seconds. When getting into a chase with the obsession, you gain a 10% increase for movement speed (if your a 110% movement speed killer) and a 5% increase if your a 115% movement speed killer. Additionally, hurting the survivor in any kind of way during a vault, will always pull them off instead of just doing on state of attack. 
---
(Again, might need some tweaking, didn’t want it to be 2 op, but, since your only getting this effect until the amount of seconds are up, or hooked, I think it’s still fair play)
---
Incompetent was the wrong word to use
---
Apologies, was joking
---
Love the devs a lot, despite the mistakes
---
Not possible.
---
He's a paid DLC, so you would have to actually buy the DLC to play as him, in addition it would require a large update to begin with, if it's a new survivor &amp; map aswell, that would bea  large update to add all of that content.
---
Fair enough :D
---
yes, it does
---
lol yes it was! 
---
no she was a pretty good sport with us after that lol
---
I hope we get a survivor to begin with
---
I mean, if you read "fixed missing bloodpoints for fully repaired gen", and you play a round and get 0 BP... you won't ask a thing?
---
Yeah, there will always be (more) bugs. But to put out a false patch notes and deal with following shitstorm... I'm not sure "surprise Ghostface" is worth it.
---
I mean unlock the teachables
---
Nice knowing ya lol
---
It... doesn’t? My friend is a huge horror fan and she wanted to incorporate some Dbd into her shoots
---
And I thought I may as well post them here
---
Then it would be to powerful as his map pressure would be very good.
---
Even if they didnt include patch notes, do you know how many people wouldn't notice. Yes, big fans or just people who enjoy reading patch notes will, but plenty of others wont. They'll download the update and start playing. Itll fool some people
---
1-2 months dedicated play.
---
You insulted me? I couldn’t tell. I have no idea what “if you are made you didn’t prepare”  not to mention I’m far from upset. I’d say the people who who downvote me are the people who are upset. But hey kiddo nice insult I’m Fucking destroyed
---
That does make the game unfun for killer geting face camped is lame and annoying
---
Im at 83% currently
---
Oh, you mean levelling up other killers until their teachables are unlocked before prestiging Huntress? Yeah, makes sense.
---
I hate it when survivors hold the game when I just want them to leave and continue another one. This has been fixed with End Game Collapse but it still happens. When I’m doing a ritual for Nurse or Huntress it’s extra annoying because I’m worse with those characters.    
---
Like, I know I had a bad game, leave so you can call me bad in game chat, idc once the games over.
---
STORYTIME! A SWF of course. That's how it started.  I get triggered when you show mercy to people and they rage at you still. I was once a very nice killer, I try to be 'fair' to be 'good' to survivors. Salt would worry me and make me feel bad.
---
SO I found a SWF, found a feng min, a good one. She ran me all around the map, because I love a good chase so the whole game til she died, I went for her and nobody else, even when she ran past the others. After the game I wanted to comment Feng Min on her skill as a survivor but I was greeted with 'you suck' 'bad boosted killer'  'that's not what a rank 12 killer would say' etc. A free win for them and yet I got insulted. 
---
How did it affect me? I snapped. But in a good way, I snapped back into reality and came to the realization that this community is just shitty and you can't do right towards toxic players. I don't swear in the chat room ever. I just said 'You best not be in my next trial' and I left. I was mad. I took Hillbilly, took an ebony mori and I went full on Tunnel and Camp, killed them all in the basement on a hook or by a mori. Not one got out. No remorse, just pure hate towards survivors. And so it continued. One trial after another, 4 kills, 4 kills, and occasionally one would escape through the hatch. So much salt went my way, I didn't care, in fact I started smiling. Because of this, I felt free and DBD felt like a whole different games, no rules, nothing holding you back, how it should be. In notime I reached rank 1. And shortly after I prestiged three of my favorite killers one after another. Bad guys shouldn't play nice, it should be common sense. Now I just show mercy when people DC, which seems to be happening a lot lately. These are dark times for Survivors.
---
I've seen this a few times. It's a treat as railgun doc, because you can sit there just zapping all 3 generators.
---
Shes really entertaining to watch and you learn how to loop and run the killer when watching her.
---
Thanks for posting, I was wondering the same!
---
Is it worth it to surprise oblivious players, though? Release hype is real, it'll bring in money.
---
I stopped watching at one of his earlier lists as well, when he put Doc at D tier, saying that his power is completely useless. I commented giving him examples and uses for his power, saying that 3 gen doc is still (at the time) even without addons/perks decently strong. Came back at me with shitstorm of insults for no good reason. For someone so bad at the game he sure is full of himself.
---
it's mostly to slow the game down.
---
Oink
---
Are you the tin man, or do you just not have a brain? It’s RNG/random.
---
Classic Peanits.
---
True
---
Who's gonna tell him
---
I have escaped the new Endgame because of MoM. Myers closed the hatch, and I could withstand 2 hits while opening the gates. It was just enough. I was really lucky he wasn't in the EW3 tho.
---
It makes me angry when I get knocked down by her corrupt purge because I can do is blame my teammates. Because if theyre any good at the plague they can aim that stuff just right. It seems like and all it take is a little drop to hit ya. Lmao
---
"rise"
---
Well done sir, just maybe it fits better on /dbdgonewild though
---
Holy crap, that is big toxic surviving right here. I have never thought of being able to use self care with no mither with the ability to be invisible while staring through the windows of the killer's soul. With a key that doesn't open the hatch for me to moonwalk into
---
This pleases the o i n k
---
true. just wanted to know what was really going on in the video is all.
---
I had one guy in one of my games who had Object of Obsession and I didn’t even notice until they were dead on hook.
---
Not all of them want  to chase, some use it to be sneaky. Stop making assumptions please..
---
Ah, Spirit*
---
Freddy. I want to get Doc at some point.
---
I mean, scream was a legendary movie in the 90’s. Its Iconic till this day and is well established as one of the best slasher films in history. I would say this is a step in the right direction for the game. One step at a time my friend, maybe the devs will add hell-raiser in the game eventually.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN25ghkfgQA
---
i'm referring to the default m1 hits-when you attack with m1, it drains some of ur power
---
Don't use add ons. Blink everywhere. Go for "unsafe" blinks = when you have no LOS on survivor, only way you'll git gud at predicting. If you have trouble with your blink precision just keep blinking (also, some maps have annoying tiles/obstacles you either can't blink through or you have to charge a bit more/aim around it etc).
---
The very unique powers and graphics are what sold it for me, along with other features. I loved how each power had its own meleee style and ranged style. (Smoke ball shots, Neon long beams, Video continuous fire, concrete burst fire). More so each power had its own movement power and all that.
---
The game looks beautiful imo. I've got so many screenshots of Delsin at the pier with the sunset behind him, and him running with neon with the trails thanks to Photo Mode. (Another great feature.) It's art style is highly under rated.
---
The story itself was interesting to say the least, but kinda short and repeated, but I see why they did that. The making use of the motion control with spray painting is cool, since it links to Delsin as a character, and it's fun!
---
Fair enough.
---
As a Freddy main, he’s not as bad as people say he is tbh, but he’s still weak compared to other killers. Freddy has to wait a bit before he can grab and hit survivors, which this alone makes him bad. If the survivor has Lithe or Sprint Burst you pretty much lost your free hit, same if there’s a pallet or window in general.     
---
Even ignoring his power, he’s a typical M1 killer with a weak power. Pig and Myers have better powers and have better results then Freddy
---
I understand, however, I would argue that ghost-face might be the scariest killer to come out yet. With his almost invisible terror radius and his ability to hide behind corners it would make some extremely scary jump scares. Now, for the character load-out factor it might not be the most intimidating, but eventually people will get used to how the killer looks. For example, the doctor looks terrifying yet he just becomes another killer at the end of a day, compare that to a Myers or pig that comes out of nowhere and the adrenaline factor is unmatched. Also, take a look at Freddy, he might seem like a good idea when it comes to how scary he looks, but in game its not nearly the same. Add that to the licensing costs and how long it would take the games to come to agreement license holders and its not even worth it, IMO.
---
&gt; But then again if they got rid of another perk to use it they might have never got to the exit gate in the first place.
---
My eyes roll into the back of my head when I realise a minute later. One day they won't come back down and that concerns me
---
To everyone saying MoM is OP, stop. It isn’t. I main Freddy, and it is a slight hinderance. Micromanage who you hit and remember how many times. When you have a choice, go for the person with less hits. Say an injured survivor you have hit three times and a full health you haven’t hit yet. It might seem counterintuitive, but you go after the survivor that is full health. You don’t want to hit someone with MoM when no one is hooked; it will slow down the process of killing.
---
Recently? If so then file a report. Because it's not supposed to stack.
---
Yes
---
good to know and thank you for explaining it to me
---
It’s not about being legal, she’s a teenager for God’s sake

mine too, but in the end he liked it
---
yeah i know that, its just funny to see in dbd because its not really an fps where the fov matters a lot, it seems like overkill imo.
---
What's the counterplay to plague? I lose almost every time
---
Well the fact the new killer coming out gave her the idea is the connection. It was just a bit of fun and thought I may as well post, sorry you don’t like it my man
---
I have NO idea how to add a nsfw tag 🤭
---
I guess I could, whenever I try to shade things it usually messes them up
---
If you got that with no farming then kudos to you. The hardest one for me was Where did they go?!? since I dont have people to play the game with, but I managed to get it with 3 randoms. Welcome to the 100% club
---
It's all practice. But missing blinks is ok, you can miss most of those and still end up with 4K. If Nurses wouldn't miss their blinks, they would just instakill everybody
---
I love playing him, and i love facing him aswell. Making him miss his swing on feral friendzy is rewarding af for me and it feels good. I think he doasn't need a rework after the last one.
---
Np. The strategy in and of itself isnt toxic, however the way it's employed often is. Doctor, Legion and Freddy all have traits that basically make it impossible to work any of the 3 gens if done right.
---
Tru is literally the only streamer I can’t stand. Oh boy do I dislike him. He straight up just tunnels and camps as killer. And he’s super whiny. Again, I really really don’t like him
---
I don't run into Legions or Distressing Docs every game
---
I did see this long ago
---
It’s just really annoying imo
---
legion uwu
---
Why is this still a thing?
---
I had good momentum at the start and lost because Survivors are impossible to track through corn.
---
BHVR need to remove 2 out of every 5 stalks. Perhaps add some small items to make the area more traditionally safe. This would also stop YouTube videos looking so bad on Coldwind
---
Reverse
---
They’re scary
---
Very funny smartass.
---
Meg is now contaminated. 
---
The ministry of bio-chemical warfare advises her immediate termination.
---
I love P3 Huntress, she is scary in blood. But if you don't like the P3 cosmetic, then it's not worth to prestige her.
---
All you can do with the perk is not hit the survivor, which doesn’t work in the slightest considering it’s your job to kill the survivors.
---
Haddonfield and the resort map they do deserve some pain but other maps even farm maps now are fine.
---
It's even worse on nurse &gt;.&lt;
---
Scary amazing
---
YouTube only content makers are not the best, you know.. He would've learned some humility and modesty if he was also a streamer
---
Perhaps, but I don’t get their culture. Maybe that’s why.
---
Yeah, i dont understand what are you trying to tell me. Explain please
---
Endgame collapse is there to stop people from taking game hostage that`s it.
---
aha, very cool Reddit, very cool.
---
Saving this to send to salty killers
---
Looping and gen rush.
---
God dammit i wasnt going to do anything regretful today
---
You haven‘t seen that movie have you?
---
That's understandable, a lot of people are uncomfortable with what they're not familiar
---
UwU
---
True. but t-bagging falls within the same catagory cause with most survivors they will sit their t-bagging until the killer actually does something about it, which in of itself could be classed as holding the game hostage.
---
While not in a similiar sense as not leaving IE hiding in the map when exit gates are powered and not leaving, yeah its farfetch'd,
---
But most survivors i've seen way before the end game collapse will just sit by the exit gate and t-bag for if i recall from one event t-bagged for nearly 5 to 10 minutes? and before you ask. *why did you not do anything to make them leave* is because i was curious. But inevitably i just slightly moved and they left.
---
Thanks man :)
---
From what I understand, there's a bug related to that outfit that makes Claudette immune to Hag's traps. Literally.
---
Even if some outfits don't match so well with others, I don't see where's the issue and why you write 3 paragraphs to complain about something so stupid.
---
Some people have to be quite naive to think this is accidental.
---
You ever fought about the idea of people staying to save someone in case they go down? Or to just waste your time so you dont get anyone else?
---
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't me.
---
Let them teabag, they are wasting their only resource: time.
---
&gt;yes, it does
---
No it doesn't.
---
It used to, a long time ago. Not anymore. You could stack up to 3x mangled and cause self-caring to take almost a minute to finish.
---
since when did David &amp; Jake be a thing? To my knowledge Wraith and Nurse are literally the only pairing they made "official" in-game.
---
I'm at 83% with platinum
---
If the hand not holding the knife is open in EW3, he has a tombstone addon and can mori healthy/injured survivors. He doesnt have to down you or have hooked you before.
---
Oink!
---
I argue you could say the same thing about the pig
---
it appears i forgot to mention no one was hooked as i failed to maintain pressure around 2 to 3 gens remaining.
---
but props for the bold assumption on your part.
---
Close, you didnt oof a joke. But its the other way around though. Remember it like this: he has his hand open so he can grab you by the throat :)
---
Im not talking about that specific game even, but in general.
---
The Pig always wanted to kill as a punishment and for her own kick of it. That‘s why Kramer tested her as well, as she went a much darker path than what he thought he was doing (his approach was some form of „catharsis“ towards the value of one‘s own life, she was a killer).
---
There is the occasional pig or wraith but those are extremely rare and usually just memers.
---
Yeah i meant it as a wink to the old mechanics, it lets you reopen the hatch only if the team completed 2 gens BEFORE the EGC
---
Oink.
---
WAZZZUUUUUUUUUUP!
---
True, but I'd like to see Walking Dead in some form at least
---
   
---
Hello!! Many know it .. these permanent disconnects &amp; that has a reason! / Bug..
---
If you are invited by a friend while you are in a round &amp; you accept the invitation you will not lose a -Pip. or if you rejoin a friend from your list via Steam .. 
---
 That's the reason for a lot of disconnects ..  
---
So please Dead by Daylight FIX THIS DC BUG It Destroys the Ranking System &amp; The Gameplay ..  #stopthedc #fixthisdcbug
---
Then you'd have a pretty valid point, but at the same time it could be countered in the case of lery's memorial where a hook is by the exit gate? 
---
in anycase all three if them IF they had the right perks could pull that person of the hook and get out safely.
---
But if its a map where hooks can be very far away from an exit gate. lets say coldwin farm. There is at least 3 hooks i know of that can spawn very far away from the exit gates. If a survivor is in struggle. there would be no point in saving them.
---
not gonna lie you just roasted me but i'm still with that fuck urban evasion
---
EXCITED OINK
---
Yeah Huntress' trophies are allot harder than all  of the other killer/survivor trophies. I recommend an all seeing Aura build on cold wind maps to get the 100  24 meter downs. The corn may give you blindness but if you throw in the correct place that's 1 towards your 100
---
I just watched this I need a full DBD stream with Tracy and some big streamers showing her the ropes!
---
You sir must be fun on parties
---
This would probably make more sense if the girl played a survivor, like Laurie or Meg or Nea or even a killer that could be immersively sexualized like Spirit or Huntress, or Susie. This is just a girl in lingerie that looks like it bears resemblance more to Quiet from MGSV if anything than Ghostface. With a $20 mask and called it a cosplay. Girl probably has a premium snapchat too lmao
---
About 6 hrs ago there was a post a few people were saying it was today or tomorrow
---
Im already getting an aneurysm, good job!
---
Just do what i did, prestige your mains and nothing else
---
Probably not a dev stream, but they'll post a developer update today or tomorrow: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bp1vdr/its_delayed_developer_update_may_2019/enngxs9/

i need to get my thot banisher from r/tf2. you may know it as the force a nature if you play tf2. gimmie a sec

I think there's supposed to be a dev update sometime this week, but I'm not sure it's a stream. We're expecting the year 4 roadmap, and possibly some info on a Freddy rework?
---
SEE IVE GOTTEN SOME MORE SYMPATHY FOR MORIS AND ADD-ONS LIKE IRI HEADS AT HIGH RANKS, ESPECIALLY SINCE EVERY OTHER MATCH SEEMS TO BE A SWF TEAM.
---
AT LOW RANKS THOUGH?  DUDE, FUCK THE FUCK OFF. IF YOU NEED THAT SHIT BEFORE RABK 8 OR 9 YOU ARE HOT GARBAGE.
---
USED TO WATCH MONTO A LOT BUT HIS INSISTENCE ON BEING SUPER TRYHARD NO MATTER HOW GARBAGE THE SURVIVORS WERE WAS DUMB.
---
Congrats
---
Don't cleanse until late game. If you do need to, cleanse somewhere that's inconvenient for her to go to, like an area with no gens to protect. Cleansing will only waste your time, and give her corrupt purge (and info). Plus, you'll just end up infected again a minute later anyways.
---
She has the Legion problem, where even if she can (quickly or otherwise) more or less guarantee an injury, she still needs to hit you to down you, and has nothing to help her in chases.
---
So, basically, her counter is good looping and routing. I know "don't get hit" sounds dumb, but good survivors can run you around forever without letting you get a single hit as long as there's pallets or good window setups.
---
Something else that's important against her is to try and waste as much of her time as possible while she's still trying to get you fully infected. She won't M1 you to injure you unless she's dumb or it's a very specific situation, so run erratically if there's no obstacles or use any and all cover possible if there are.
---
Your parents didnt love you or something?
---
why did you comment then you fucking moron
---
That achievement is really easy to get with a sabo and boil over. Just sabo the hooks in one area and stay near there.
---
All survivors could start using a perk called wake up.
---
You know that perk literally designed to make you open the gates faster
---
SERIOUSLY, I HABE ALSO FELT THE SAME WAY ABOUT HATCH STANDOFFS. JUST HIT THEM AND MOVE ON, FUCK. YOU ALREADY WON THE GAME.
---
I had a sad face on when I read this comment thread and saw the skins weren't buyable with iridescents. I was saving up for the nea too. Rip
---
Meme incomplete xD
---
I don't even understand the spoiler rule. Steam has Ghostface in separate articles under the Play button.
---
You're such a big boy I bet mommy is proud
---
This is amazing. Good job
---
Then don't trigger it when there's only one survivor left
---
There's no need for comments like this.
---
SALTY TEAMMATE CALLING ME A GARBAGE TEAMMATE WHEN THE GODDAMN BILLY IS CAMPING THEM AND I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE (AND FAILING, UNFORTUNATELY). NOT FEELING BAD ABOUT NOT SAVING YOU ANYMORE, TWAT.

I don't want to play with Braith anymore, she keeps telling me and Lars what to do.
---
MY MAN HE IS TRASH BUT WHY WOULD YOU ATTEMPT THAT
---
Same
---
Okay. I am solid with this.
---
SLAM 'EM BOTH SHUT
---
What is it with people complaining about others "bringing the killer to them" ?
---
Unless the person has bond, how are they supposed to know you are there?
---
Usually people who complain about this stuff are immersed babys who have no idea how a chase works
---
This ^ plus the comments from Not_Queen on the forums saying it wasn’t ready yesterday and it’ll be ready Thursday or Friday- and it’s not a stream just a forum post.
---
Why are people such tools? As if you’d say that shit in person, fuckin clown.
---
Dude you literally have to wait a couple of seconds stop being so impatient
---
Dude posts in a sub called /r/genjimains. That alone already says something about his personality lol. The best though is the title of his post:
---
&gt; How do I train all the degenerate animals below masters to play tanks properly?
---
He obviously has some issues. Sounds like an edgy teenager.
---
Aw, you can’t go our thicc girl Jane like that 😂
---
wwwwaaaaazzzzzzzzuuuuuuppppppppppppppp
---
*Oh no*
---
Don’t know who you’re playing against but 9/10 times we get rid off all totems
---
Do you play a lot, or plan on playing a lot? Is Huntress your main? If yes to both, sure go ahead and prestigue. If you answered no to either, then its probably not worth it. Prestiging is really just for completionists and those that like to have a dedicated goal while they play. 
---
Fyi, It takes approx. 4.5 million BP to go from p0 lvl 50 -&gt; p3 lvl 50. 
---
Unlike survivors, the only bloody cosmetic you actually see as killer is the weapon.
---
We’re gonna make it forever /s
---
Ummm, no YOU are a mediocre killer
---
Where is the plag dude
---
From the looks of it your connection seems awful. That or DBD is being DBD.
---
Thanks I used some of the mind trick tips and was doing my huntress daily and learned not to aim at survivors but where you predict theybwill juke and boom I was dropping them like flies
---
It's because of people like this that survivors deserve no mercy, should never be given the hatch, never respect the 4%, and will be DC's upon if they use BPS.
---
Well my connection is pretty good I dunno....
---
When I play killer i tend to main Plague now, it's fun just puking on everything lol. And people cleanse surprisingly often as well, to the point where I have snatched people off the fountains multiple times in a match lol. But I dont see her very often when I play survivor even on PS4
---
I mean it also makes you open the exit faster and gives your team information on which exit gate is currently being open I don't know how that qualifies as a noob perk.
---
Good write up, isnt T1 myers slower then survivors tho?
---
Oh you mean that moment with ace? 
---
He tried to dropping the pallet but healed the whole time the Dwight and then dropped the pallet maybe you mean that?
---
I just started playing the game about a month agl and as a Nea and Legion main I'm just happy they both got some awesome new skins. The neon is going to force me to get better at surviving chases rather than just skulking around with Urban Evasion.

They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you are fine when you are not really fine but you just can't get into it because they will never understand.
---
Imagine getting costumes depending on what achievement you get. That would be sick. Specific costumes for the "Adapt" achievements, specific costumes for the "Killer Power Orientated" achievements. It would be really cool and almost flashy even.
---
I was thinking how odd it was that she seemed very hyped before her release. I main her for two reasons. One I  allays love icky sticky gross powers in villains (disease, poison, pestilence). Second I find her extremely fun to play and with the right mind games a DAMN good killer.
---
I'm a killer main and tunneling really hard can actually cost you the game. If the chase goes on for more then a minute and you cant get a hit in a second or two then it's just best to leave them alone. Also some people have builds dedicated to keeping the killer busy so if you see a survivor trying to get your attention then it's best to ignore them because chances are there expecting to get tunneled and that's what they want
---
I think Desicive Strike was worse since you got it totaly for free and wasted way more of the killer's time. Also, mettle of man has this downside where you don't really want to heal up after usig it (unfortunately this does get countered by just 99%ing and then healing right before you enter a chase)
---
For 5-10 minutes?
---
Yeah buddy, that's still a dick movd and borderline to holding the game hostage.
---
I waut at the exit gates to to see if everyone makes it out but not a single time has this taken 5-10 minutes.
---
Have you ever fought about properly reading what the other party is saying?  Makes you less of a cunt you know
---
Aufheben
---
It's to prevent a dead teammate in swf from calling out the killers load out.
---
Still legal somewhere, still cute everywhere
---
As cruel as it's gonna sound I kind of also don't feel bad for the Kate considering she was waiting for her teammates to die.
---
I personally just don't like people who camp the hatch and wait for you to die.
---
thank you
---
It's harsh but I'm agreed here. Sometimes it's either going down, or bringing killer to that loop which ALSO has a gen near it. Nobody would win if I go down unless gen is 90%, but once I hear the gen, killer hears it too.
---
In short, I don't want to switch killer's attention, I'm just running away. And you should too if it's a Myers, you can complete that gen later.
---
wait which scary move was that scene from?
---
im crying all my mains are in C
---
Then by the logic of Tumblr, you are a bigot. In this culture however, you just don't see the enjoyment of us having a joke.
---
"Risk" I always get pissed when people say there is a risk in taking NOED. If survivors spend their time cleansing all totems, NOED already did it's job. Otherwise, if it doesn't activate, it means you won. If it does activate you get free downs, didn't need to do anything to earn it.
---
Just to compare with Mettle of Man, wether the perk activates or not doesn't have anything to do with your own gameplay, instead it is determined by what the enemy team does (survivors cleansing totems and killers not using M1 attacks)
---
I'd also like to quickly say how much I hate adrennaline, comming from someone who regularly plays Freddy. It should not wake survivors up
---
I'm not sure if everything clicks to me.
---
However, I am definitely better today than some months ago.
---
I still do some potato chases (main survivor here), but I am much better at analysing the environment to try and make it as long as possible (tho not suuuper long because, again, potato mode suddenly shows up)
---
However, on the other hand, I think that I perform pretty well on the other categories. More often I get more saves, more gens (and ruin skill checks), hex totens and etc. Also, I do play stealthly relatively well. Some matches I don't even meet the killer at all.
---
I play DBD for almost a year now, and by far today I do much better than I ever expected to. I was rank 7 before the rank reset, but my peak was rank 6. I probably have some hundreds of hours
---
It was less she got delayed a day and more than she accidentally got released on console.
---
THE PALLET VACUUM WAS BROKEN, BUT GETTING HIT THROUGH PALLETS AND WINDOWS 90% OF THE TIME IS JUST AS BUSTED.
---
*secretly hoping they mention Sidney Prescott*
---
They were in immediate vicinity so I figured may as well find the last guy
---
I have about 430 hours and I'm finally getting decent at juking. Watching YouTube videos has helped quite a bit for both my survivor and killer gameplay.
---
Until David farms the obsession guy who miss ds and dies to hook popping dying light.
---
I honestly don't know a way to balance is I heads without making them shit. Iran it could be you can only carry 1, ever but if you miss it's a wasted shot
---
Idk any other effects it could have to make it not OP or bad
---
Agreed
---
Sometimes I’ll try to play someone other than Spirit, or use a new build, but then when I get bullied by survivors it reminds me to not play so they have fun and just put the prayer beads on for the next few rounds
---
Gay people? Eww, i don't like that, because that's Gay.
---
Ah thanks m8
---
IMO, Spark of Madness, Halloween and Shattered bloodline (in no specific order) are the best DLCs
---
IMO the best killers are The Nurse and The Pig.
---
i hate the Doc, Freddy and The Hag the most.
---
Is that tape on his face?
---
There really is no downside to the perk, which wouldn’t be that big of a deal if the main focus of the perk wasn’t so damn broken. Either rework the perk completely and make it do something different or make the downside much better. Maybe slowed repair speed for a minute or 2.
---
Boil Over sucks and Unbreakable only allows you to get up once, making so a teammate needs to pick you up after the second down.
---
Swap Unbreakable for No Mither. Boil Over for an exhaustion perk (SB or DH will allow you to go further into the corner). 
---
Flip Flop is alright but it could be swapped for Breakdown, in case you are unable to sabo a hook in time.
---
I know :)
---
Yes, I was playing as killer and someone went to the corner and sabotaged my hooks. I got so mad I waited for her to bleed out.
---
Like, they should stick with aura reveal if you ask me
---
-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
My SWF refers to it as the Toddler Tantrum build.
---
it \*can\* work, but it makes for long games and everyone has to be keeping up on sabotaging hooks.
---
Scream 4 Sydney’s nephew was Scream.
---
Sydney’s nephew was a girl as well.
---
I’d watch Scream 1,2 and 4
---
Maybe, but I think it should start the aura reveal as soon as you get hit and MoM protects you instead of waiting to heal.
---
Dont worry mate I think we are on the same page here and the harsh words were obviously not directed at you, but at players who always take the easy way out and complain instead of trying to improve.
---
&gt;Honestly, I even find "my noob teammates" thing to be a poor excuse most of the time. Unless they are completely ignoring the hooked guys or DC
---
Fully agree. Sometimes matchmaking fucks you over and you get a pepega team, and I am no stranger to complaining about them, but if every team is the problem, I am the problem
---
I know these comments make me sound like I think I'm hot shit skill wise, but I don't. But if there's one thing this game has taught me it's that I have a healthy attitude when it comes to learning and trying to improve

It's more about people are passionate about the series and there wasn't a lot of effort put into it. Literally the brightest thing is her boobs and she's not in a proper setting or has blood or any indecation that it relates to Dead By Daylight. It looks like she just last minute grabbed a mask and phone. If she wore a see-through black cult robe, threw some blood on and was holding a knife or something people would like it more. I personally don't see a problem with this but at the same time I don't really see it as an appealing thing but that's just me.
---
Yeah, it's totally *astonishing* that people would want to complete partial heals, wake up against Freddy, or be able to tank multiple hits (hi MoM) while mid-chase.
---
Das me!!
---
They also need to add the face from the phone scene.
---
First teachable needs to have the fake gate take the same amount of time as a real gate otherwise survivors might realize by the progress bar. 
---
Third teachable seems kind of pointless. Maybe it could be the Killer version of No Mither? If you're gambling on a perk slot, it should maybe give you a BP boost.
---
they are balanced. you just need practice dodging hatchets and running from the huntress.  
---
and, occasionally, you'll still get nailed in the back with a hatchet.
---
for a scientifically accurate estimate i would need an example pic or know the SO. 
---
without that.. well i'd say it would work on me
---
We had a few photos to pick from, one of her with a knife and the phone but they just didn’t look as good
---
i mean i wouldn't call that toxic but ok.

yeah, referring to this. since you said this is new to you, i highly recommend to watch this series, every episode is just great.
---
Don't ever mention he who shall not be named here again.
---
You deserve that. First kicking the gen there is a horrible play, and it isn't even hard to trace through corn if you actually try to look, you look too far down as well.
---
Sloppy Butcher is not a teachable afaik
---
Distortion still has useful effect on the beginning. Why not replace it with Solidarity, so the build can be much more painful...
---
bloodwarden

Don't ever go Botany + SC for exactly that reason.
---
I sometimes use Botany + a medkit when I'm bored of other items and it's pretty neat but a toolbox saves more time obviously

I just don’t think Shaun fits the game, we basically already have a similar character in Dwight. I’m not terribly against it though. I think a better fit honestly would be Gary King if you wanted a Simon Pegg character. 
---
Pinhead...well...in my opinion (and just my personal opinion) sucks. Hellraiser is such a crappy franchise full of dumb stuff. Again, if you’re itching for Hellraiser, take Frank from Hellraiser 1. He has a better story than the convoluted mess that is Pinhead. Again, just my opinion.
---
No. His stalking, stealth and crouching are all unrelated powers.
---
His TR only comes back if a suvivior spots him.
---
Totally get it, I post cosplay occasionally so I know the struggle, and I don't mean to come out as a dick, you know besides the snapchat joke. Meant it to be more funny than insulting.
---
600 or so hours to start actually getting better since I used to watch certain streamers and youtubers who weren't good at the game and would constantly try to convince everyone that "it's not my fault, it's the imbalance", once I stopped listening to morons improvement became easier.
---
Thank you very much

bing bong pls

All random I have had teachables show up literally the next bloodweb after getting them but i also had one in particular take 70+ levels. Literally an entire prestige plus extra.

You should help me with the All 4 survivors escape through hatch. (Also a trophy hunter).
---
Add incentives to not DC. Currently the only downside to DCing is losing rank. Most people don't care about rank because there's zero rewards to being high rank other than sweaty games.  Give out rewards, maybe a large bonus to iridescent shards based on rank after reset.
---
Don't want to use the rank system due to fear of toxic play to reward players? Fine. Add an "honor system" that tracks how many DCs a player has in a given month. Players with high honor can earn exclusive cosmetics, blood points, shards, etc. That will utterly kill the urge to DC prematurely for both killers and survivors.
---
In addition, add some punishment mechanics. Add a cooldown timer to queueing again at the very minimum. First DC in a 24 hour period, you get a 15 minute wait to requeue. Second DC, one hour. Third DC? 24 hours. More than 5 DCs in a 7 day period? Account lock for the season. Stop giving leniency to bad connections, it's 2019.
---
There will not be any discussion about any of the leaks. We're all under contract and can't speak about anything that has not been officially announced yet.
---
Freddy 100%
---
Ultra is SHIT for gameplay, it makes everything darker and I'm convinced it lowers render distance, I could run the game on Ultra but Low is infinitely superior.
---
I wish BHVR would clarify what is obvious that they only got the rights to the mask , because there are sooooo many people who expect to get sidney and woodsboro so when Ghostface drops and it is revealed they only got the rights to the mask then there is gonna be sooooo much hate being thrown at the devs even though anyone who even remotely knows how licensing works should be able to see that they only got the rights to the mask. None of the add ons have names or descriptions related to any of the movies, the killer is wearing a costume that is nothing like the movies and just so you know License Holders are very stern about their Intellectual Properties to be accurate (case in point Freddy Krueger from 2009 remake) and there is no way if they had the rights to the movie scream or its sequels/tv show that they would allow bhvr to change Ghost Face's Iconic Black Robe Costume let alone allow them to give him a cosmetic like the red devil one  that is even further from the his iconic look in the movies. I would love to be proved wrong and to have sidney as survivor and a Woodsboro map but 99 percent sure that it is just Ghostface and if he isn't a paragraph and is a full chapter then he will come with an original map and original Survivor. And plenty of people have been saying the same thing like Paulie Esther on Youtube/Twitch and plenty of others, so people have been warned so when it is just Ghostface they really have no reason to complain or be disappointed because they are the ones that got their hopes up for a real SCREAM chapter when they have been told by many people that it is probably just the mask and they could have seen all the clues that pointed towards the devs not having the movie license rights. That being said I cannot wait for this killer, the power sounds like a lot of fun and i can't wait to have to adapt my survivor gameplay to hone my skill against Ghostface :) always love a new challenge!
---
Because BHVR sucks at consistency.

Inb4 they start giving stacks for Pig's dash instead of the other way around.

---
I mean I'm just saying for literally 95% of the game noed has no use. If the killer is good noed has no use. The only time noed has use is when the last generator is repaired and survivors are by the exit gates. Noed most of the time maybe gets you one extra kill. If it gets you more the survivors were stupid.
---
Idk why people dont like adrenaline. It's used once. You are playing a 3 perk match and gambling on even getting all gens done to get a one time speed boost and potentially a one time heal. So yea. Both are fine perks
---
I wish more was available for shards, I really wanted the Plague Doctor outfit (as well as the victorian one) but they're cell-only.

Hellraiser is good, Hellraiser II is the best one, after that is a string of possibly the worst horror movies ever made. Its even worse than late Friday the 13th.
---
I think it was V. That has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And not in the sense of so-bad-its-good, like just plain bad. Like being 
---
-angry-at-having-seen-a-movie bad.
---
I would just be ok with a Cenobyte killer. But Frank could have a power were he leeches of survivors and becomes mote powerful, kinda like Myers but without Tiers.
---
i got that one by accident lmao
---
you mean ghostface dlc......if they had the rights to the movies then some of the addons would reference the movies and ghostface would be wearing the iconic black robes from the movies
---
I dislike Licensed killers usually, ghostface seems cool and pig is okay but I really just dont like them.
---
BUT THEY USUALLY ONLY DC BECAUSE THE KILLER STARTED RIGHT BESIDE THEM OR THEY GOT DOWNED BECAUSE OF A GARBAGE HITBOX OR LAG.
---
Leatherface is that high omg that's funny.
---
Doesn't matter how good players are you can't ignore clowns gas because it slows.
---
As much as I like legion they aren't 2. And no way Billy is best.
---
This list is bad
---
Some of this info here is inaccurate. The healing speed buffs/debuffs are applied successively, not cumulatively, so SC + Botany (32 / 1.33 = 24) + Butcher (24 / 0.8) comes out to 30 seconds. Botany with a Med-Kit (16 / 1.33) is a 12-second heal (15 with Butcher). Likewise, charge efficiency is also applied successively: The Emergency Med-Kit equipped with Gel Dressings and Gauze Roll and Botany Knowledge (24 + 16 + 12 charges; 52 * 1.25 innate charge efficiency = 65 * 1.33 Botany charge efficiency) comes out to around 86 charges, or 5.4 heals.
---
Fun fact: If you hit at least 1 great skill check, a vanilla Emergency Med-Kit can also provide you with 2 full heals on its own, and if you hit any more, you even get to keep it!
---
Currently if you don't come off the gen before completed the you get no points for the repair.
---
After a 4k score in a game where I did 3 generators and was chased for a fair while I realised something was buggy so now I pop off it close to completion to grab the points.

Last month, we were happy to release our first Developer Update, a blogpost focusing on some of the most pressing issues and how we are working on solving them.  
---
The last Developer Update was very well received and this time around, we will be revisiting our topics from last month and give you an update on their progress, as well as some new topics, including disconnection handling, hitboxes / hit registration and more. 
---
UPDATE ON PREVIOUS TOPICS 
---
OPTIMIZATION – STILL ON TRACK  
---
Last time we communicated about optimization was in March and we thought it was time to give you an update on our progress. We currently have a team of five people dedicated to optimizing the game and we are still on track with our original plan. For the last update (2.7.0) we introduced some changes that optimized the CPU and GPU usage and brought small visible improvements to the live game, but we are not hitting 60 FPS on every platform yet. Our internal tests are really promising; they are getting us closer to the 60 FPS goal. These changes will be introduced with the next chapter update. After the release of chapter 12, we will attack map specific optimization, perks and powers that cause spikes in FPS and edge cases. To consult our roadmap and learn more about optimization: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49456/optimization-status-update-road-to-60fps#latest

INFINITE LOADING SCREENS - LESS OCCURRENCES 
---
The infinite loading bug causes one or more players’ game to hang as they attempt to load into the match. This, in turn, increases loading times for the rest of the players in the game.  
---
In the 2.7.0 update, we fixed a few instances of this issue and we added new analytics to improve our tracking of the remaining cases. These analytics will help us track, identify, and fix this bug for good. While we are seeing significantly fewer instances of infinite loading screens since the mid-chapter update, we are still focusing our efforts on resolving the remaining problems causing this issue. 
---
LESS THAN FIVE PLAYER GAMES - OUR 2.7.0 CHANGES AND THEIR IMPACT 
---
In 2.7.0, we have added a new feature that automatically cancels matches that start with fewer than five players. When this happens, any player remaining in the match after loading will receive their items, add-ons and offerings returned to them and their rank will be unaffected. Some instances of this fix might not behave as designed and will be fixed. 
---
MATCHMAKING - THE NEW ALGORITHM IS LIVE 
---
The new matchmaking algorithm has been live for a few weeks now and we have been able to reduce edge cases. We have been testing multiple versions of the new matchmaking algorithm to ensure that queue times are more consistent for all players and to be sure that it is ready when we make the switch to dedicated servers. We will continue to improve on it and concentrate on fixing rank disparity and regional issues. 
---
DEDICATED SERVERS - LEARNINGS FROM THE PUBLIC TEST 
---
The first dedicated servers tests on the Player Test Build were a success for us. We prepared a post about our learnings from this test; read it here:  https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/62205/dedicated-servers-2-7-0-ptb-learnings#latest 
---
FREDDY REWORK - GAMEPLAY REVEAL INCOMING
---
In the last update, we promised that information would be released next month about The Nightmare rework. We are still on track for releasing this information in the next 2 weeks. We have been very busy finalizing the Freddy gameplay reveal and we can't wait for the Community to have a look at the changes!  
---
GAME HEALTH 
---
HITBOXES AND HIT REGISTRATION – FIRST STEP 
---
One of the most reported issue on the game now is the way the game handles hit registration and hitboxes. We investigated to find what was the cause of this issue and we found that the main culprit was different instances of desynchronization. Desynchronization can be caused by input lag, animation issues, registration issues as well as user lag. This is the core of this issue and migrating to dedicated servers will give us the tools to handle hit registration better. 
---
Being hit through the window is by design. A window is an opened element and killers should be able to reach through it. Players suffering from desynchronization issues will have the feeling that they are getting hit through the window when they are much further away. 
---
Desynchronization problems are not all that we have found. We also realized that some of our killers hit animations were not matching the attack cone which created the impression that the hit should not have registered when in fact, it did (or vice-versa). We have reviewed most of the animations and the adjustments will be released in the next update. This is the first step of our upcoming work on hit registration.   
---
DISCONNECTION HANDLING - OUR PLAN, OUR ACTIONS 
---
Player disconnection is a rampant issue in Dead by Daylight and causes regular frustrations to players. Migrating to Dedicated Servers will give us the opportunity to manage disconnections better. The design for disconnection handling is currently being worked on and we are aiming to launch this feature at the release of dedicated servers. We will share more information on the design itself over the summer. 
---
Until we migrate on dedicated servers, we are left with the way we have been handling disconnections for over a year; by punishing players that are disconnecting more than a definite threshold (% of the games played). In the last few months, the game has been in a state where we had to be more permissive with that threshold because too many players were experiencing crashes and loading issues and we didn’t want to punish players for issues caused by the game. In the last update, we have fixed most of these issues and our threshold is now back to the initial number. 
---
SOUNDS 
---
Sound is a big part of the Dead by Daylight gameplay; we want the sounds to be as precise and constant as possible. We realize that every time we update the game, we receive multiple reports of emerging sound issues. We investigated and we found that they were mostly caused by the way we integrate sounds to the game.  
---
Sound creation in Dead by Daylight is a lot of work and it’s handled by 4 different teams. Sound designers, gameplay designers, programmers as well as QA testers. In order to improve the quality of our game sounds, and because we know it is crucial for gameplay, we are working on new internal processes that will change the way we do the implementation, design and testing of sounds in the game. This will allow us to track issues better as well as being more efficient in resolving them.  
---
LIVE BALANCE 
---
METTLE OF MAN - UPCOMING CHANGES 
---
Since the release of the Ash vs. Evil Dead DLC, we have been closely monitoring feedback for Mettle of Man. Although the perk was immediately polarizing, we felt it was best to collect more data before making any balance changes. With that in mind, we decided to review Mettle of Man. 
---
We are working on different concepts and designs for this perk. The version we are testing internally at the moment is similar to the current version, however, rather than activating the perk after three basic attacks, the perk now activates after three protection hits. When active, any attack that would put the user into the dying state will be ignored. It is still a one-time use perk. We think these changes will force the user of the perk to make a conscious effort in order to activate it and should offer more counter play to those who come up against it. 
---
For the moment, this is a prototype we are testing and it might not be the final design. We are still working on other different concepts that we have yet tested. The Community will be able to try our final design in the next Player Test Build. 
---
This concludes our May 2019 Developer Update. We hope we were able to address some of your top concerns. In the next update, we will revisit these topics once again and keep you posted on the progress we make. In the meantime, we will continue to work towards fixing all the issues listed above as well as keeping an eye out for any new issues that may arise. Until next time...

They're so incompetent that they've "leaked" like every single new killer they've ever released? As much as I like the image of one earnestly trying employee who keeps uploading the wrong thing, I think it's far more likely they're trying to publicize their upcoming content.
---
I wish I was good at most of the killers or enjoyed their gameplay cuz I would achievement hunt like I do in other games but sadly I'm not the biggest fans of certain killers
---
Healing is not meta. the only healing meta perks is we will make it 'cause it's a fucking +100% boost and you need nothing else to make it works.

Botany is low tier.

True. I never use addons/offerings because I feel base nurse is already way too OP. Every game ends in a 4k or hatch escape.

I'll play entity's advocate here. The spirit's power is the phase walk, not the hit after. The pig's power is to be a quick little oinky oinky girl.

If I get tunneled for more than 2 games I start throwing on MOM and DS. You wanna tunnel me, you're going to throw your game in the process buddy.

I remember getting a 4 man slug in the very beginning of the game just off of pure dumb luck. 1st survivor I hook kills themselves, hook the 2nd, and while Im omw to hook the 3rd the 2nd guy kobes. At that point I just let them have the game, like, you beat the 4%? You've earned it buddy gg.

hah

Looks like they are going to make mettle of man completely useless. It requires 3 protection hits to activate which is way too hard tbh.

&gt;And for real? Adrenaline shouldn't wake you up? You realize what the idea of adrenaline is right? It's like an energy drink. You take it to make yourself stay awake. 
---
By that logic, NOED should prevent survivors from escaping, left behined should not allow you to leave untill all other survivors are gone and wake up should... well, wake you up... the name should not be the determining factor of how a perk works. Adrennaline shouldn't wake you up since it doesn't make sense balance wise.
---
&gt;Sure it hurts an already sucky killer even more but that's more a problem with the killer than the interaction
---
The interaction only affects this killer! There is no other killer that deals with survivors waking up. It's litteraly an effect added to interact with Freddy. Everyone knows freddy is the weakest killer, why is this not removed?
---
You've never been screamed at by a girl for "leaving her on read"? I had to turn off those bloody notifications just to have my life back.
---
Nope.
---
Praise the lord, MoM is getting nerfed sooner than we expected. 
---
What a day to be alive.
---
They made it almost useless for solo survivors but still quite powerful for SWF groups. Another nerf for solo survivors hooray!
---
What's MoM
---
BHVR can rip my Docfeng from my dead fucking hands.
---
Piggy and Myers are my mains, although I've been playing Surv lately (love me some Ash).
---
I hope. I love the pig.....
---
WORK THAT BODY WORK THAT BODY
---
I don't run NOED bc I just don't really like the perk. But I'm not talking about you specifically. 
---
In the instance where Noed gives you an undeserved kill is every time you get one after it triggers. Bc #1, Noed only triggers when the Surviviors do all 5 gens. They could have been going around cleansing dulls and just not found the last one or someone else did the gen while they were looking for them. Yet they all get punished for the actions of one. 
---
#2, the killer knows it's gonna trigger bc Surviviors don't waste time on dulls (which Imo is fine. They shouldn't have to.) 
---
And as for your final comment. Yes altruism kills, I agree that you need to only help others when it's beneficial to you to help them. But that's not what I'm saying or arguing, that's a whole other conversation. What I am saying is that it's absolute bullshit that we as killers get to run a perk that punishes Surviviors for doing Gens (their primary goal to Survive) but then we also turn around and complain when Surviviors run a perk that rewards them for doing Gens. 
---
Honest to God I'm convinced the killer community won't be satisfied until 3 Surviviors spawn on a hook and the hatch doesn't exist anymore.

Ghostface, scream, whatever they call the Dlc I'm ready to take on the challenge of completing the trophies it has to offer :)

---
I dont have legion plague is good but I dont find her very fun
---
THIS WAS AT *RANK 14,* BECAUSE I HADN'T PLAYED AS MUCH THE LAST FEW MONTHS.
---
SO IT WAS LITERALLY 3 INSTA-DOWNS *AT RANK 14.*
---
Hmm, I see. Thanks for the clarification
---
I enjoy plague more. Thats just me though.
---
2019 is the year of the pig (chinese zodiac)
---
Did people seriously not know that getting hit through a window was by-design...?
---
That right there, is the way to go. I've had games where there was one disconnect and suddenly it's a super easy game as killer, but if the player had stayed i would have had a hard time getting even one kill vs the 4 after the DC.
---
Don't ask me, dude. All I know is that Behavior's code is like badly boiled spaghetti.
---
That would suck for a SWF. I'm thinking it could change into animals.
---
So.. right back to square 1 with DS
---
Currently on the grind myself. Only 7 trophies and all adept killers left!!! Only got ash’s crawl to hatch 3 days before EGC went live 😭
---
She came outa fuckin NOWHERE.
---
Shards lol. You get a free skin every year with how slow shards generate.
---
HAD SEVERAL GAMES WHERE I LOAD INTO THE GAME AND THE KILLER DCS AFTER NOT CATCHING SOMEONE IN THE FIRST 2 MINUTES OR THEIR RUIN GOES DOWN AND I DE-PIP. DON'T TELL ME "IT'LL COME BACK" BECAUSE IT FUCKING DOESN'T. EXIT OUT, RELOAD THE GAME-STILL LOST A PIP. FUCK THAT SHIT. 
---
ALSO, TO THE MYERS THAT WE FACED A FULL MATCH AGAINST AND WHEN THE EXIT GATES OPENED YOU PULLED YOUR PLUG-HAVE A BIG FUCK YOU, YOU MASSIVE GUTTER STAIN. NO ONE GOT ANY BP AND YOU'RE A SORE FUCKING LOSER. THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME. 
---
I'M JUST GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO SAYING FUCK THIS GAME, DUDE.
---
Nobody cares who you main when you're stuck at Rank 15
---
I actually really like this idea. It still retains it's power but you have to work for it. You don't just get it.
---
You know nothing about how deployments work if you think there's a way to accidentally do this.
---
Hey guys, the new Susie skin is looking nice.
---
I find legion really fun to play after the update.
---
I'm ready to see everyone be mad
---
Gosh darnit I need a spooky gf
---
So it's gonna get used to bodybock the hook?
---
i think people were just upset that they were getting hit well outside the scope of the open window, probably because of desync/lag or whatever. 
---
which is a reasonable reaction.
---
His Mori should be that he juggles knives and then throws them all into the survivor.
---
Helpful in regards to needing solo survivors, but swf will see the same advantages as usual
---
I like this proposed version better. It applies to all Killers, not just the  (objectively) weaker M1 Killers and makes MoM more niche.
---
I really like that idea for MoM. You'd have to work for it, instead of just.....getting it.
---
It's completely useless imo. It is way too difficult to activate and even if you did activate it, it's not worth it. I literally bought the dlc for the perk and I feel like I wasted my money.
---
So I get punished for NOT farming the unhooked survivor? I'm not sure about this behaviour... 
---
If I go for the unhooked person they will have DS and BT, if I go for the unhooker they get MoM... Good design
---
Turns out there is a dev stream today after all: https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1129034391609589762
---
yes in deed :) i can't wait to play another stalker killer and i can't wait to learn to adapt my survivor techniques to face the new killer, i always love a good challenge
---
Botany is still bad..unless you have a medkit for really fast heals but then you could just use instaheal add-ons.
---
It's a little more complicated than that. There's a team of five people who are *focused only one optimization*, but there's many more here working on new content, balance changes, etc. In the case of optimization, often times other people will jump in and do some work as well. To use examples from the post, level designers are brought in to revisit maps and fix performance issues there, and game designers/programmers are brought in to optimize perks.
---
There's definitely way more than five people overall, it's just that there's five \*only\* on optimization.
---
Even just watching you I was able to keep track of them. It ain't broken. Take a step back. Look at yourself. 3 people running around a gen with some corn in your face and you wanna call broken. My dude. Maybe and dont freak out but maybe, you just aint that good.
---
i've never used MoM, so i don't really have a stake in this, but how often do they think a single survivor takes three protection hits in a single match?
---
fuck I'm a dumbass I meant to put that I've watched woopsie
---
Thats my fear with this change.
---
Hate the idea, not gonna run the perk since I rarely play a 4 SWF.  Still think they should make it that any killers ability (spirits phase walk, wraith uncloak, Tier 3 with doctor, etc) should not count towards MOM.  They should buff it for solo survivor and not make SWF even more powerful
---
I think each dbd content creator has their place. At least for me. I feel as though Monto is the guy who runs the weird builds that I myself would probably not run and he showcases a lot of the killers higher rarity add ons. I feel that noob is the guy I go to for meme dbd videos. Then there's puppers a super chill streamer who I just watch for the chill vibes and the phenomenal looping, funny moments, and interesting cosplays he does (definitely becoming a fave for me). Then there's true talent. I want to say this. I am not a white knight for true in no way. Personally I don't find him to be a toxic killer or survivor player. I enjoy his competitive mentality when I want to watch someone play dbd competitively and I like that he is very good on survivor and killer and rotates them well. Before, I used to think he was a camping tunneling killer from what people said and I watched on YouTube thinking he must be uploading the videos that make him look the best (which is true for almost all content creators). However, 2 months ago I got gifted a sub when I tuned into his stream and I would watch him a few days out of the week during my free time at college. This changed my mind about him. While I do find him whiney and bitchy and it's funny when he goes oh dead hard when he got 360d but I do not see him camping as much as people say and he doesn't tunnel a crazy amount like killers I see in my games. Most games he plays he plays them competitive and yeah if a survivor gets immediately farmed off hook he may capitalize or he may play fair. I think that's okay for someone who plays the game competitively and not casually. I look at him in this way. He strives to be the best because that's what he thrives on with the game. I find him healthier for the game compared to other fog whisperer and streamers because he tries to play fair but sometimes plays lame when the game takes a turn. Personally I agree with some opinions of his such as his take on the pip system, old legion and decisive. Other stuff he bitches about but you should see the crazy survivors he goes against. I never go against anything like it. I do turn off his videos though when I heard whining too much though. Then there's tyde tyme and he is just super unhealthy for the game. Absolutely unhealthy and I would say toxic. A lot of people say him and true are like the same person but I highly disagree
---
Everyone is. Rank no longer matters when you can’t rank up due to ludicrous requirements. 
---
Also, was rank 7 before reset
---
DUde, bUt I WaS oN tHe OtHEr SItE !! - survivor main
---
UNPOPULAR OPINION-GEN-RUSHING ISN'T REALLY A THING ANYMORE. AT LEAST NOT AS MUCH AS KILLERS WANT TO BELIEVE. OLD BNP MEANT MAYBE 2 MINUTE GAMES, YEAH THAT WAS GEN-RUSHING. THAT SHIT SUCKED FOR KILLERS. BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE DOG SHIT AT KEEPING MAP/GEN PRESSURE AND GOT LOOPED FOR ALL 5 GENS INSTEAD OF BREAKING CHASE DOESN'T MEAN YOU WERE GEN-RUSHED. FUCK YOUR CRY BABY, WHINY, "GEN-RUSH" EXCUSE WHEN YOU BRING NOED AND YOUR EBONY MORIES. 
---
(COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO PLAYS BOTH SIDES PRETTY EQUALLY BTW)
---
That's good to hear then. Obviously I don't know the internal workings of BHVR but you all seem dedicated to improving the performance of the game, so I'm excited.
---
If I’m first one found, downed, hooked, and it’s a basement that’s an automatic D/C from me.  Especially if it’s not a good chase.
---
&gt;So I get punished for NOT farming the unhooked survivor? I'm not sure about this behaviour...
---
&gt;If I go for the unhooked person they will have DS and BT, if I go for the unhooker they get MoM... Good design
---
It ain't perfect but still better than what we currently have and they are still working on it.
---
Legion doesn't have good teachables, but they are plenty fun.
---
Plague has very good teachables, but she's quite dull.
---
If you are in search of a new killer to play, or enjoy playing Huntress or Doctor, get Legion.
---
If you are in search of a way to power up your old killers, or enjoy playing Spirit / Nurse / Hag / Trapper, pick Plague.
---
MoM sounds fairly cool; I like that it encourages more altruistic gameplay. 
---
Looking forward to the Freddy rework; nice to hear it’s coming in the next couple of weeks and hasn’t been forgotten about
---
This, getting hit after you’ve fully vaulted and started to run
---
YEAH I AGREE, THERES JUST A LOT IF TIME PLAYING SAYING TO MYSELF. HOW DID THAT HIT ME? OR PLAYING KILLER SAYING HOW DID THAT HIT THEM? IDK MAYBE A HITBOX REDUCTION IS IN ORDER OR MAYBE NOT WHO KNOWS
---
Imagine if you were forced to automatically swing when coming out of Phase. That's what Pig's ambush dash is: the hit is an inherent part of the ability, whereas it is not for Spirit.
---
There is the idea to make such hits (i. e. Wraith's Surprise hits, Hag's Phantasm hits, Spirit's Haunting hits, etc.) not count for MOM, but then it would basically be a dead perk, like too many other perks already are. To balance it, I'd rather see other adjustments, such as making non-Obsession MOM weaker, making MOM in general require protective hits rather than just any hits (but then not only regular M1s), making it so the killer does not go into post-hit/bladewipe cooldown but merely the decidedly shorter missed attack cooldown, or such.
---
couldn't they... idk, nerf it to actually make it so you need 5 hits or smth? that way will force survivors to take hits while the killer is carrying someone to the hook, frustrating the killer even more
---
i think they should make it that you need to take regular 2 hits and 1 protection hit, something like that because i think it's going to be VERY difficult to be able to take that many protection hits
---
I might take a hit near the end of the game but 3? It can happen but it would be so much rarer for solos. You’d have to run a different build with perks like empathy just to be able to use MoM.
---
\+ rep for Cope. I watch him every morning before work. Super chill guy, zero bias, no complaints.
---
Ash will now become a hook goblin. Crouching under hooks to get stacks.
---
MoM, a brand new super situational second chance survivor perk already being reworked and nerfed but NOED is still in its current state when it’s even more of a polarizing perk? Pog
---
What ludicrous requirements? I finished at Rank 2 playing Pig/Wraith/Freddy
---
WGLF, DH/BL, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline
---
It'll probably kill the perk as far as usage across all players. Could be worse though.
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
I assume this is for survivors. Usually you want to gravitate towards a balance in your perks: 1 Exhaustion perk (or 2 in rare cases), 1 or 2 second chance perks and then an altruitic perk of your choice. For example: **Balanced Landing** (Nea Karlsson teachable), **Mettle of Man** (Ash Williams teachable), **Decisive Strike** (Laurie Strode teachable) and **Borrowed Time** (teachable from Bill Overbeck on PC, not a teachable on console). This is just an example of an all rounder build that always works and will give you an edge in most situations, will it be saving someone, getting saved or escaping. I personally enjoy less "meta" perks that I think are still quite good: **Stake Out** (Detective Tapp teachable) is amazing in most situations and a counter to some annoying builds (like global terror radius doctor and pig) and it will help you counter Ruin (to an extent, it's very good when you start out and you don't always hit your great skillchecks); **Aftercare** (Jeff Johansen teachable) is an amazing altruistic perk that not only helps you a lot, but shares a stupid quantity of information; **Deliverance** (Adam Francis teachable) is an amazing second chance perk, especially if paired with Decisive Strike. **Dead Hard**, **Lithe** and **Sprint Burst** (respectively teachables from David King - DH -, Feng Min - L - and Meg Thomas - SB -) are, like Balanced Landing, exhaustion perks, perks with a predetermined cooldown that give you an enormous advantage on the chase, usually by creating a lot of distance between you and the killer. **Empathy** (Claudette Morel teachable) is a very good information perk, just like **Alert** (Feng Min teachable). **We'll make it** (not a teachable) is another very good non-teachable perk, just like **Spine Chill**, **Small Game** and **Premonition**. It's all extra information that is honestly very handy to have. **Plunderer's Instinct** (not a teachable), **Ace in the Hole** (Ace Visconti teachable) and **Pharmacy** (Quentin Smith teachable) are all good perks for looting chests. **Leader** (Dwight Fairfield teachable) and **Prove Thyself** (Dwight Fairfield teachable) are also two good perks for coop play. Honestly, basically anything goes on Survivor, really. You can mix and match whatever, but if you still want to be quite competitive while doing some random janky stuff, always keep a second chance perk and an exhaustion perk with you.
---
&gt;I told everyone they wouldn't have to worry. The devs are basically catering to the killer mains now so I knew it'd get nerfed
---
yeah... totally.
---
Because MoM is totally balanced.
---
Soory, next update we'll be removing all survivor perks and reducing survivors speeds by 10%.
---
We hope the killers enjoy their new game!
---
“Another high rank match, I wonder who the kille-“
---
*chainsaw revving in distance*
---
“Darn.”
---
No one cares whether I like Legion or not except me.  Turns out mine is the vote that counts.
---
Awww Glenn for sure. Steven deserves that much lol
---
I checked and the healing speed I posted is incorrect. However I have used Botany with the green kit, gel dressings, and gauze dressing and it has come out to 5.1 for me. I've also used just the Emergency kit without add-ons and I had about a 4th of a third heal before it depleted. which is the last 3.8 charges. Sadly DBD's numbers are all over the place.
---
Oh what the hell. That's weird I thought it was the overall time of feral frenzy. Alright thanks bro
---
Use your powers/ ensure you only hook people twice. Problem solved
---
33% slower is a little bit slower, sis...
---
Then maybe everyone shouldn't pay 2 win by buying Leatherface for BBQ, Hag for Ruin  etc. Your logic makes no sense
---
The perk helps a lot with tunneling and camping.
---
I don't use MoM so I honestly don't care what they do to it, but people criticized it a lot before and after it came out for the simple fact that it was merely used as a way to sell Ash. Now that the hyped is gone, they're changing it.
---
Was with you until the last bit. Some people can't help bad connections, just cos "it's 2019" doesn't mean everyone lives in an area where good internet is accessible.
---
It's going to be hilarious to start teabagging back.
---
Wow. A whole 3 percent.
---
Yeah, i'm always laughed at when I don't use those. I only use BT, but that's because of all the camping
---
So can Spirit. Her Phase Attack animation is the same as her basic attack, while Pig's Dash Attack is a completely unique animation from her basic attack. Thus her phase attack is a basic attack and Pig's dash isn't. This is probably the reasoning.
---
&gt;Use your powers/ ensure you only hook people twice. Problem solved
---
I haven't played killer since MoM got released but as a survivor, not even Billy and Huntress can consistently avoid giving me MoM stacks.

---
There's a bit of a difference there. You can always cleanse totems if you don't want to go up against NOED, but the killer can't just not hit survivors if they don't want Mettle of Man to activate. Having a powerful effect is okay but it needs to have counterplay, otherwise it feels unfair.
---
They made it very clear this may not be the version that goes live dude. 
---
Can't we appreciate their transparency without trashing them for decisions that may not even make it into the game?
---
Playing killer, sometimes it's the opposite. It's always nice when they break HG after they've already gotten Ruin tho.
---
I love Freddy, I'm nervous...
---
It was kind of cut out of the image, but the details are just one option they are TESTING for MoM. It doesn't mean that it will be the actual update to the perk.
---
...And so can Spirit, as well as Billy and any other character with an ability. The difference is that Spirit is not forced to hit after coming out of Phase, whereas Pig is forced to hit when dashing, going into missed attack cooldown if she can't land it; again, the hit is an inherent part of the ambush dash ability.
---
I really hope it isn't. They usually don't change anything if people don't whine about it.
---
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME AFTERCARE ;)
---
Damn I've used it a bit, and tbh I didn't get the hype for it since I found I'd only get to use it once every few games. But now it's basically once every 20 games. Imo the protection requirement is too much
---
DS is a complete pain the dick now. Someone will get unhooked and be doing a gen right in front of your face before they even heal, and you get punished for smacking them down. At least you could anticipate the old DS.
---
I shoulda put that in the title lol
---
Sick backpedal
---
And this explains why you think MoM is not an issue.
---
At your rank, it is much easier to pip. It sounds like the problems boil down to your own skill level. If you hook a survivor, leave and go right back when unhooked, rinse and repeat, you're probably going to black pip.
---
Try kicking a gen for every hook that you get, and I bet you'll see a big difference.
---
Well aren't you fun

---
You mean getting hit by the killer isn’t an uncommon occurrence for you? Git gud scrub! /s
---
Wait what you serious BBQ has multiple counters
---
I didn't know BBQ and Ruin gave me free kills just by bringing them into the game, I must be using them wrong.
---
Honestly, if your ping is dogshit don't complain about being hit from further away.
---
Its because Spirit doesn't hit during phase walk, she hits after her phase walk ends, phase walk Ots there just to turn invisible and walk fast, all your iterations with the survivor you do outside the phase walk.
---
Fair enough. I'm not the biggest nurse fan and Plauge was very tedious I like to mix and match though I like the diversity of powers so it was fun to get all the trophies :)
---
Opportunity cost is way too high my man.
---
Compare the maybe 30-60 sec you safe to equipping MoM and DS and taking a few minutes of the killer's time. Which is always far (actually four times more) valuable than saving time in what you do.
---
Their will to improve and to communicate with the community.
---
Both sides have their share of terrible players who somehow got into high ranks by some miracle
---
Protection hits feel really bugged to me. I've had many times where I take a hit with the person next to me and I don't get any wglf stacks.
---
I don’t camp or tunnel and I get shit messages from salty survivors.
---
Glad I didnt level Ash like I planned for MoM
---
I mean a lot of killers can counter it. Some can’t but if there’s a meta of it at you’re rank or you’ve faved it a lot and you want to them there’s always Huntress, bubba, Michael, Amanda, hillbilly. Not sure if Hag or Spirit’s post power hits work against it or not tho. Same as totem hunting and maybe even running small game after 3+ Noeds.
---
Freddy
---
I hope they fix the actual protection scoring event. If I take a hit when am injured survivor is in front of me, it’s probably on purpose to protect them.
---
The majority of killers can’t hit with their powers alone. Also do you want people to camp? Because “making sure you only have to hook people twice” involves camping and also results in a lower emblem score.
---
Only hook people twice means no sacrifices and you're facing 4 survivors at all times. How is that a solution?
---
I bought one of the Feng school girl outfits or whatever and everything looks so ugly mixed with it, I agree but it’s really tough to want to make nice cosmetics that are unique and mix them with the other cosmetics
---
Actually not so useless. If you can force the m1 hits anyway, then MoM will activate on anything that would down you while you're injured, which means you can tank things like chainsaws or instadown hatchets. Most killers will still m1 you quite often, just because survivors can find windows and pallets so often and don't have time to use their powers.
---
Because it should be available as an option to counter him. Other characters have options that no one else does that is a direct counter to them specifically. Ie the trapper and his traps. The wraith and a flashlight. Some dont. Which is why they are considered the best killers and these are considered the worst. But that's not a problem with the interaction. That's a problem innately with the killer. If they buffed freddy then this would be an interaction to help deal with it.
---
The point isn't the name it's the idea behind the name. It's called adrenaline because the idea, lore wise would be you stick yourself with a shot of adrenaline. Giving you a kickstart. In real life that would wake you up. Hence why it wakes you up. I'm not just going off the name. It's like the entire gameplay idea. Its named adrenaline because your character is receiving a burst of adrenaline. How would they do that? Stick themselves with a pointy end
---
I like that they are communicating with us, I just really hope it's not the final version, they usually don't change anything unless people constantly whine about it.
---
lol backhanded not so subtle survivor main comment
---
They’ll still find things to complain about! Omg Claudette didn’t spawn on hook!
---
My favorite sub
---
Botany is a great perk, I'll always run we'll make it before I'd run botany though.
---
Imagine playing overwatch in 2019
---
Boil Over is useless, use Tenacity instead.
---
yes you can hide in locker, but here comes Iron Maiden and if the killer is somewhat good they will know that they are hiding to prevent it. and that's where counters ends. and bbq gives you more bloodpoints. survivors We're gonna live forever gives you only points, which definitely is not fair. Have wallhack, or have bonus points. Or make it fair for both sides
---
When they blink, do a 180 and run towards them... unless you’re a crazy person like me and already facing them.
---
By this logic you could say the same for people who bought the Hag DLC, Leatherface DLC, Halloween DLC (pre-DS nerf)? You have to buy like 60% of the perks in the game at this point unless you want to wait forever for them to be in the shrine.
---
WAY TO COMPLETELY MISS THE POINT. PEOPLE DC BECAUSE BEING DOWNED FIRST OFTEN LEADS TO BEING TUNNELED OR CAMPED BECAUSE GETTING ONE SURVIVOR OUT OF THE GAME DRASTICALLY TIPS IT IN THE KILLER'S FAVOR. FIX TUNNELING AND CAMPING, YOU FIX THE PROBLEM AND THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO STILL DC ARE THE CRYBABIES WHO WOULD DO IT NO MATTER WHAT
---
I GUARANTEE YOU YOU PUNISH DCS, PEOPLE WILL TAKE THE NEXT EASIEST OUT, LIKE DYING ON HOOK IMMEDIATELY. IF BHVR KEEPS PUNISHING DCERS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY GIVING THEM INCENTIVE TO STAY IN A GAME THAT'S LIKELY ALREADY OVER FOR THEM, THEY'RE GOING TO GO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE. YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING 'LOL SO WHAT I DON'T WANT THEM IN MY GAME' - NEWS FLASH, BHVR WANTS THEM IN THEIR GAME. LOSING SALES AND PLAYERS ISN'T GOOD NO MATTER HOW YOU SPIN IT. FIX THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM, DON'T PUT A BANDAID ON IT
---
Please stop spamming pig memes and posts
---
We’ll make it. Amazing perk. Not very often you randomly run into someone who needs a heal. However after an unhook you are standing next to them. It also lasts a while! WMI is amazing. Better than all the other healing perks in the game.
---
i love the fact that meme formats about dissapointment in this subreddit are always taken from gordon ramsay
---
Imagine calling a perk you literally just get by existing "super situational"
---
Adrenaline doesn't always need to be a shot. Your body can naturally give yoy adrennaline and while likely, it doesn't always wake you up
---
Really thankful for the level of communication here. I have constantly been on the edge of calling it quits with this game. This update addressed every single one of those issues.
---
Thank you so much!
---
It's okay I can bring the key in I have loads on my Jeff (I'm a Jeff main, he is Jesus) yeah it should be pretty easy :)
---
We all knew this was coming. No surprise here.
---
It'll probably be the same situation as Michael and Freddy, where they get the rights but not the rights to survivor likenesses. So we might see Sidney, just with a face that's butchered to fuck like our boy Quent
---
You know that meme has a fourth picture
---
I don't really get it but if this became a new skin I wouldn't mind.
---
Bold of you to assume I ever got good
---
If you want to learn how to play a good survivor either become a p3 immersed Claudette, or watch videos on how to use windows and mind game the killer
---
You are going to get less kills by not bringing them, so by your logic you are 'paying 2 win'
---
&gt;or be able to tank multiple hits (hi MoM) while mid-chase.
---
Are you really claiming you have the 40s to selfcare MIDCHASE?

I really hope you were either joking or I hella misunderstood, because otherwise I couldn't recall when I last heard something this stupid
---
I'm curious to see how he'll work. I think fundamentally the problem with the Freddy is he's got such a rich unique power and realm and lore of his own that adjusting him to fit and make sense and feel fun to play as and against in a game that his it's own set thing is what made him what he became in the first place.
---
So it'll be really interesting to see if they somehow have finally managed it IMO...

Break the fucking totems
---
&gt; It's so situational that all of us at rank 1 use it.
---
While statistically true, Rank 1 is top tier, and most people who own/play this game will never see that rank.
---
SERIOUSLY
---
Like y’all know that gens are often inside or on the way to jingle gyms/maze tiles.
---
Personally I would have liked to see it protect against M2 hits like Billy. The current MoM is just stale as fuck.
---
Not enough piercings, either
---
i use something similar,  Unbreakable, Tenacity, Flip Flop and Breakdown...  i tried boil over but it was pretty meh i switched to Breakdown so the hook was broken when i was rescued
---
I run a stealth meg build. I’d say I escape 60% of the time. I just find it difficult to find hatch and also have the key at the same time. EGC is also making it harder.
---
You work for it... but then you never get it unless you are playing swf. No one is going to get 3 protection hits in solo survivor
---

they would still need the rights to the movie to even has "sidney" as a survivor at all but if they had rights to the movie there would be references to the movies in the addons that leaked, the killer would have the movie accurate costume and there would have been game files in the dev build that people found ghostface in that showed a map or survivor which the dev build had absolutely zero game files for a map and survivor and with this being announced may 28th there would have been something for the map and survivor if there was one. this will be a paragraph and there are 2 different license holders for the mask and the movies, they only got the rights from the guy who owns the rights for the mask, they did not get the movie rights from the other rights owner or else Ghostface would have the right costume, there would have been a reference in the leaked addons and there woulda been game files for a new map/survivor :(
---
Rank reset and I play allot more survivor than Killer I just go onto killer to do my dailys or if I wanna let off some steam. There is nothing wrong with me but thanks for the concern :)
---
HELL YEAH MY BODY IS READY
---
Leatherface 110%
---
* Freddy has stall, tracking, Stealth and mindgames. 
---
* Leatherface has hook defense. 
---
50% action speed penalty in the dream realm is huge. So is seeing their aura outside your terror radius, which ALSO gives a better built in Whispers. If they're awake, all have is the non-directional Lullaby, and MAYBE grass and crows if he isn't careful to avoid them. His transition is a built in mindgame that can land you a hit. Also, riddle me this; how many killers can CONSISTENTLY land a hit within seven seconds. Nurse..... And that's it. Everyone else is situational on the environment you start the chase in. IE debris cucks Huntress and Billy, not having traps around cucks Hag, Spirit has to have the environment to immediately start a mindgame (which more often than not takes MORE than 7 seconds), making Legion cover a large distance cucks them, ANY window or pallet cucks Wraith, Clown is meant for denying loops, NOT get first hits, Plague needs no debris AND Corrupt Purge, and Myers and Pig need to hide their body. 
---
Leatherface can defend a hook better and punish deadzones harsher. That's IT.
---
She is super fun. Specifically, when you are hunting someone and are puking them at the same time. I don't know why, but that makes me laugh a lot.
---
**EAGLE CRY** 🦅
---
Even with rank reset you must have been rank 11 still before the reset which is still low ranks.
---
Whiny killer. Just deal with the P3 clauddetes.
---
Yeah, the commodious toolbox is better for sabo then the Alex's toolbox (I think they've removed the charge consumption penalty for Alex's now, but commodious is still better). Only toolbox worth having.
---
I totally get you, and I'm thankful that you brought this out. I probably wouldn't have a courage to unless I'm pissed off already
---
I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't participate in this supposed steam page bombing. However, I'm curious to hear what your thoughts are on this nerf. Do you think it is right? Do you think they should've nerfed it in a different way?
---
Ah yes people who play dead by daylight ( I play this game help me)
---
Rip the one meta survivor perk in over a year, while I did not use you MOM, i thought you were the start of the dev team making good survivor perks again
---
Is it often that people get 6+ protection hits in a game? They don't seem that common that it would be OP to be able to use meddle of man multiple times.
---
I'm a 50/50 main. I almost never see NOED at high ranks. Just low and middle ranks. How is NOED *not* a crutch? It requires you to fail at your objective, which is kill survivors and protect gens. I also think that MoM and the old DS were/are crutches. Does that make me a killer main? No.
---
On the other hand I feel like the counterplay needs to be something that is actually worth it in the sake of something like NOED.
---
Basically a counterplay shouldn't be risk for possibly no reward. Sure you can search out all the totems on the map yourself, but then you've just wasted time from your main objectives of rescuing and generator repair. 
---
I've always felt the counter-play to NOED is busted and not guaranteed to have a reward. There's also the basic flaw of ''Well, I found 4. I hope my teammates found the other. Well....shit. They didn't."
---
Don't even get me started on new activitable NOED with Endgame Collapse. 
---
NOED really isn't perfect right now and to think that is flawed thinking IMO.
---
Even without adrenaline, people who selfcare multiple times in a corner for 40s instead of touching a god damn gen are hurting their team so much. They just don't realise, because for some reason people think the world will end if they run around injured for 30s
---
All you have to do is crouch in front of a hook. You're guaranteed to get a stack at that point. It's far from impossible, you actually just have to try instead of just getting it for free.
---
Bye bye 👋 MOM burn in hell
---
For the efficiency, I know that it has to work the way I've described because the Emergency Med-Kit when combined with Gel Dressings and Self Adherent Wrap/Bandages and Botany Knowledge comes out to exactly 5 heals, which is only possible if you apply the efficiency successively. Adding them cumulatively would leave you at around 4.7 heals.
---
Oooo any survivor trophies I can help with? Not allot that can be helped with but I know a few can be helped :) but that's awesome dude I hope you can join me in the 100% club soon! I'm always happy to see a trophy hunter climbing their way to 100% :)
---
Can’t be the only one that noticed this LOL
---
MoM will grant stack by getting ‘protection hit’ which it should be in WGLF benefit, not this perk. Giving permanent aura reading after MoM activated is punishing enough for me. Getting hit to protect other survivors is too risky and I’m not gonna run it since it not worth for just 1 extra hit by that.
---
that looks absolutely brilliant!
---
Even worse than DS. At least DS helps with shitty tunnelers, this is gonna be way worse. Its a shame, i thought we were gonna have a little bit more variety in high tier survivor perks
---
Yeah I really dont like the perk how it is now it just takes a stupid requirement then you just get a free hit I feel like if they made it a better requirement that you had to go out of your way to get but was still possible to get cause even without MoM you get hit so its something thats gonna happen either way
---
oh well, i guess... freddy rework?
---
I agree with you. I ran it until I got Adept Ash, but there are better perks to run for my play style.
---
How is changing your mind based on *new information* backpedaling? I'm not saying I didn't say what I said, I'm saying I understand the situation better now. Do you know what backpedaling is, or do you just like using the word? Because that's not backpedaling.
---
"Use your powers" doesn't apply to Wraith, Nurse, Huntress, Freddy, Doctor, Hag, Spirit or Clown. Other killers also can not avoid it if the survivor in question body blocks and forces the stacks.
---
 That leaves killers with the choice of EW3 only Michael, Billy/Leatherface who only chainsaw, Trapper who only catches via traps, Legion assuming Frenzy every first hit, plague assuming broken first always and Pig assuming only ambush hits. None of which is optimal, all killers need to M1 at times. Also "Only hook twice" implies killers should now officially feel the need to camp on top of that. Combine Mettle with Adren, an insta-heal, DS and Dead Hard and most killers don't stand a chance; which coincidentally is one of the most common survivor builds now.
---
I think he meant you can complete partial heals mid chase. That's how I took it.
---
Yes, the dev's proposed change is a good one. However, for the people who bought Ash or intend to buy him, what good perks would he have now? Flip Flop, Buckle Up, and the new proposed MoM are all kind of subpar or situational. While I think the original MoM is terribly thought out and overpowered when multiple survivors have it in the same trial, this also leaves Ash with some borderline Quentin-level perks.
---
My main build currently is SC, BN, BL, and hope, works very well and is fun to run
---
if you bought the DLC thinking that the perk wasn't getting nerfed you're an idiot tbh.
---
“Get fucked MoM” 
---
-Noed circa 2019
---
Ok first off what killer runs Iron Maiden
---
You are a legend for buying him the dlc
---
The cream went too--- 
---
Nope, nopity nope, nope. I will not write this.
---
Just tired of seeing them every match. Not really whining or anything. Usually I play every match, but trying for my Adept Plague has taken all the wind out of my sails when the Claudettes keep DCing after being downed...
---
Ideally it should be hard to get. The effect of the perk is huge and as we've seen many times, it can very easily make the difference between an escape and a death if used well. Though this is just a sneak peek at this point, we're still experiment and tweaking things. It may not be the same if/when the changes go through.
---
Mhm, and I agree that Mettle of Man should be changed. The way the perk works now it might as well read as: "You can take an extra hit if you are somewhat good at the game." But I think that this nerf that they are bringing is in the wrong direction. 
---
Protection hits rarely occur during chases. The most common place for a protection hit is when you unhook someone. Unless you plan to follow someone around who is in a chase or stray away from objectives to find someone in chase to take a protection hit this perk will see little to no use from the players that have been using it.
---
Only time I have a problem with this is when you know they are doing it on purpose and are running bond and you see it at the end of the match and while the match is going they keep bringing the killer to you and magically getting away because the killer is up your ass and they make it out and you die on the hook. Allot of the time it’s those pesky Claudette’s! Now if I’m with SWF, don’t worry buddy karma is a bitch!
---
Also if your hiding in a locker then they don’t know where you are so perk countered?
---
you can hide your aura behind gens. you can use distortion. you can fake your movement. there are a lot of counters to bbq
---
She actually did, but you couldn't see her because she blended in with the background. Still OP though, right? :)
---
Oof, that's a lot of salt.
---
Thanks :]
---
I don't really know (I was in the closed beta) but this game DEFINITELY used to be more janky, and had more bullshit.
---
Facecamping (standing DIRECTLY in front of the hook pressed up against the survivor) would block the unhook prompt, dooming the person facecamped to die a slow agonizing death while your clueless teammates watch instead of genrushing.
---
Trapper could put the traps directly under the hook, often catching a survivor going for a save and if he DID see and disarm it, the Trapper would know to rush in before the save is made.
---
Sabo'd hooks and traps were gone forever. You'd see sabojake squads all run less hook offerings and sabo every hook (besides basement, basement hooks were indestructible) and you'd be fucked since you can't make it to the basement in time.
---
BNP would insta-fix a generator. Mori's didn't require a hook first. 
---
No Bloodlust. MUCH more open windows and more pallets, nor was there a window blocker. So infinites were a thing + exhaustion wasn't, (they still had their own cooldowns though) so people would combo sprint burst and Balanced landing and just loop you for ages, especially since back then the cooldowns still went down when sprinting so you could chain multiple sprint bursts in one chase by doing a sprint burst, looping, then pulling off a balanced landing, etc. and eventually the cooldown would finish so you can do another sprint burst, and so on.
---
IIRC hatch spawned at the beginning of the match meaning a survivor with a key could result in a 4-man escape before even a single gen was done.
---
I love We'll Make It too. It works wonderful if your team is the one taking the injury.
---
I prefer Botany though because I love to use medkits so I don't use as much time healing and I can rely less on my team. Sometimes unhooks are snatched away by non-WMI survivors and I don't get it to activate. 
---
I'm more of an objective/chaser player so I prefer the ability to heal alone with my medkit saving the rest of my team time or heal mid-chase. I play solo a lot and I'm not very altruistic so if I heal a teammate in a match it's usually once maybe twice so a nice little boost works for me.
---
Some time ago, I saw one of their Q&amp;A videos and they said they had an idea for the hatch standoff saying they could make it work as the following "After the the 3rd survivor died, there would be a countdown of 1 minute (more or less) for the hatch to open, in that time, the killer could see the aura of the survivor".
---
But look where we are now! They made a beautiful new mechanic to change the endgame completely, called endgame collapse &lt;3
---
&gt;It's funny how they nerf survivor perks really fast, but nerfing some killer perks (example - Barbecue &amp; Chili) is not even going to happen. Devs are definitely killer sided.
---
bbq literally got nerfed a while ago what the fuck are you talking about, they made lockers hide auras, that's a huge nerf to the auras, if you want to avoid BBQ you can.
---
I don't think you get 6+ protection hits very often in games unless you actively go for it. I don't think that Mettle of Man should be re-usable though. The perk effect is very strong as it is.
---
I actually do, just not their deployment and neither do you. But you just can't ever believe that they purposefully leaked it considering what files were pushed with the leak.
---
their not wrong. in the data sheets, noed was one of the most used perks in all ranks except red ranks
---
Mettle of Man isn't even that strong. Get any killer besides an M1? Absolutely useless. Plus you only get it once. Like, if anything it needs a fucking buff.
---
First time i tried using dead hard i also had sprint burst equiped, i couldnt understand how to get dead hard to work. After a couple games i thought the perk was broken cause it barely worked. Then i noticed it was an exhaustion perk. O my soul.
---
they probably just didn't have time or didn't think it worth.
---
Spark of madness &amp; lullaby for the dark don't have spotlights either.
---
You mean with those little heals for 2s while the killer breaks a pallet, where you actually hurt yourself because you shorten the distance you gain while the killer is locked in his animation?
---
Yeah right, only need to do that 5 times to complete a heal that was at 75%. And that is if you manage not to die because you lose so much extra distance while healing.
---
I appreciate the explanation, but no thx, that is still a stupid point
---
Yeah, definitely not like most killers don't have a power that stops giving them stacks mid-chase. Wraith, Trapper, Nurse(her blink hits now count for MoM), Hag, Doctor, Freddy, Pig, Clown, and I don't really know about Legion. That's more than half the killers.
---
Who?
---
"I've changed my opinion based on new evidence."
---
"WOW LMAO SICK BACKPEDAL BRO GET REKT"
---
The killer is going to down you in 20 seconds after hooking the survivor.
---
&gt; Use your powers
---
Yeah im gonna hit them with my wailling bell in order to avoid giving them stacks 
---
??
---
&gt;ensure you only hook people twice
---
So basically hard camp one entire hook phase and/or tunnel, gotchu fam.
---
i dont call this as karma, myers just got upset because u loop him so hard hehehe
---
Iron Maiden gives you a notification where someone left locker and one shot for that person
---
We'll see. I've been running Agitation anyway lately on Spirit. May not be such a bad thing.
---
Wouldn't that be a good thing? Different builds. Like say new MoM, Empathy, Borrowed Time und Botany Knowledge with a green medkit?
---
AFAIK there is a small cooldown between WGLF stacks.
---
I think its intentional, not sure tho.
---
sigh...one more reason to give up on this game.  Playing killer has never been easier, but hot damn the lobby wait times kill it for me.  Playing as survivor has never been more unfun than it is currently.  3 years of playing :(  Oh well, was a good run
---
Ha! I knew the MoM nerfs were coming. 3 protection hits aren't simple to get, hell half the time bodyblocking, or taking hits for other survivors doesn't even register as "protection" for me; at least by the looks of it they're changing the way it procs to whatever downs you, instead of going from injured -&gt; downed state.
---
Another dead survivor perk that will barely be useful except for in once in a blue moon.
---
He always passes off his opinions as facts which really annoys me. Especially when he says "Spine Chill is a crutch perk" or "Hag is D tier" with such pretentiousness.
---
Probably an unused icon for a jigsaw box, havent seen it anywhere in game
---
It’s still 2 situational to be any good
---
Yea IDK, some of the decisions they come to seem super arbitrary. They should have never released MoM before testing it. Or giving it 5 minutes of thought.
---
If you had it at 99% you could finish it.
---
who the fuck runs iron maiden
---
you can still see auras behind gens. you can fake movement but if you play at high ranks you will most likely see fast moving killer (nurse or hillbilly) and they will search for you there and find you
---
Did you see freddys hitbox? His arm is not even close to connecting and he still downs. Same  goes to Huntress and those windows.  I hate it so much,when you start running to the window of the L-wall and get down halfway there,because of "design" choices
---
Yeah, it's no wonder that the dbd content creators are sick and tired of it, they all have 3000+ hours on the game. That amount of playtime is enough to make you bored and tired of any game, let alone an asymmetrical one
---
Ready for three more incredibly niche and/or useless perks on the next survivors?
---
I feel like I never got stacks when I used it. Honestly, it feels underpowered to me and I don't understand why everyone thinks it's broken. Any non m1 killer counters it instantly. But maybe it's only broken at red ranks and not broken at rank 6-8 like I play at.
---
I think that certain content creators are partly responsible for the tribalism between killers and survivors.
---
Yah what fucking BULLSHIT! So I will have to drag the killer near my remakes in order to get my stacks which means right next to them. Hell its hard enough now to get the damn thing working if the killer is tunneling someone and they don’t attack you until your leaving the game! If they do this I’m done with the game!
---
I understand that it is difficult to balance these perks. I really hope that the people who are in charge of these balancing changes play the game and have access to additional resources that prove that this is a good perk. As of now, I just don't think that that is true with some of the changes they make.
---
The nerf probably goes too far. I'd change it like so:
---
Whenever you safely unhook or complete a generator, you get a token. At 3 tokens, MoM activates. The next time you are put into the Dying state from the Healthy state, you are Injured instead.
---
Now it needs to be powered up by completing objectives and helping your teammates, there likely won't be enough opportunities for a 4man sweat with friends squad to use all 4, and instead of punishing M1 killers specifically, it protects against NOED/chainsaws/etc.
---
nice meme
---
I really don't think MoM is that powerful. I ran it for a couple weeks but switched it out for better perks because I wasn't activating it enough and was playing against a bunch of killers it doesn't work against (Myers, LF, Billy, Huntress, Plague, Legion).
---
It's interesting because if you are an experienced survivor, you likely can avoid getting hit 4 times in a game. If you are a newer survivor, that free last hit probably won't save you anyway because you aren't familiar with loops and a heal gives your aura away.
---
I didn't think it needed changes so I hope they don't mess with it too much.
---
So 1 out of maybe 10 games it could make a difference, got it
---
It will be used for farming which is worse ... People will unhook you infront of the killet and take a hit and or take a hit before u get hooked then run and someone else will have to come save you. It will mest up the game if its used to farm with LGLF
---
Damn, that kinda ruined the perk in my opinion. Killers will easily know now whether you have MoM or not due to the blatant bodyblocking hits you'll take. They'll actively try not to basic attack you (obviously this will depend on the killer). I hope they do not go through with this change because I don't want teammates wasting time being hit...
---
Plague? Why do you think that? Plague has no counterplay in that you don’t cleanse then she’s basically a trapless trapper in chases.
---
No I’m gonna trash them because there is nothing wrong with the version now! But BhVR takes anything decent and nerfs the fuck out of it or makes it worthless! Them guys could fuck up a wet dream!
---
Yeah on most maps you will generally struggle to find the hatch but I'm sure we will be able to get you it :)
---
The needs of a majority I guess in terms of killers complaining. Personally I dont have a problem with adrenaline. Also I strangely enough dont have a problem with MoM. In fact I've never had a problem with really any perk a survivor runs. At the end of the day either I'm better or they are.
---
Honestly I just dont see a problem with noed. Its effect is strong. Yes. But there are other perks you could also run that are more strong and not tied to the condition of making it to endgame. Running noed eliminates one perk. And doesn't even guarantee itll be used. That's why its balanced to me. It has counters. It is a gamble on even being used. Whereas something like a nurse's calling doesn't really have a counter unless you know they have it so you stop healing inside a terror radius. Feel? Nurses calling will always have a benefit. Through all stages. Noed affects one. Sure it can feel a little unfair but it isn't always going to go off.
---
I'd be okay with this if the Protection event didn't feel so random. At least on PS4 there are plenty of times I should have gotten a Protection event and it just doesn't count.
---
I used the Gauge Roll for the 5.1 heals. When I used the Self Adherent Wrap/Bandages I get the 4.7 heals. 
---
There's a video Pain Reliever on Youtube has that has the Emergency Medkit with Gel Dressings and Gauge Roll heal 5.1 times with Botany.
---
I like that change too. The concept of the perk changes, but in a positive way. It's not so strong that it is automatically included into every build but the activation requirements are easily met by changing your playstyle around this perk.
---
As someone who can't read "MoM" without thinking of "mother", this quote reads a completely different way.
---
Exactly and especially on PS4!
---
Finding reliable heals from your team isn't easy to do, and the less time you spend healing the more time you spend progressing the game. DS is hugely reliant on the killer not knowing how to play around it, and I don't use it anyways so I have no sweat using Botany over it. I would also argue that Botany *reliably* saves far more time than DS ever will, especially if the killer has enduring. If they don't tunnel you, then DS is a dead perk. 
---
My standard build (BL, SC, BK, MoM) really helps me in solo games.  I don't have to skip healing to prioritize gens in most cases, and I don't have to wait until the gens are done for adrenaline to pop. I can safely do generators or take a smack if my teammates aren't doing so hot. 
---
A medkit won't carry the game, since it has limited charges and Franklin's exists. SC + BK does have the possibility to carry a game, though. Bonus points if you do have a medkit with this, but It's better to just bring a toolbox. Don't write off BK so easily, it really is a great perk.
---
That's something I thought of too. When I play killer, I will ignore the players who are actively seeking my attention because it is easier to go for the survivors who are less experienced in chases. If I know you have Mettle of Man, I know that the chance of you doing a generator is lower than if I were to go for someone who is hiding and actually doing generators.
---
some killers do, with bbq. it gives them wallhack or one shot with notification. if they don't run iron maiden, they still have wallhack perk
---
 A lot of them aren't great representatives for the game and breed a lot of the problems in people's mentalities.
---
It sure is but this doesn’t apply to SWF groups. They are able to communicate in order to get MoM stacks easily.
---

This is not possible to occur by accident. Especially considering they had a leak literally two versions prior. No one is that incompetent. It would be orders of magnitude worse if it actually were accidental, because it would mean that not only the devops guy has no idea what he's doing, but NO ONE ELSE does either.
---
If that is indeed the case, something must have changed about how charge efficiency is handled, because I know for a fact that the Emergency/Dressings/Wrap/Botany combo yielded 5 full heals in the past.
---
Yeah same, something I really liked about him was the fact that he would stay away from talking about balance and controversy (not including his past though, Lotta controversy there) and he'd just have fun and mess around in the game. I don't mind people talking about balance (it's important) but it gets annoying when you just keep regurgitating your points over and over again. Honestly I understand why he's sick of the game though, he has 5000+ hours

Mininuke launcher
---
Bottany Knowledge is so under-rated. It's become one of my must have perks in most of my builds tbh.   
---
Also, I'm sure someone else has pointed out but WGLF does not stack. :(
---
I prefer his streams that his youtube videos. He can be a bit killer-biased at times but it isn't that often from my experience.
---
try Autodidact + Stake Out
---
Then maybe don't play ranked online multiplayer games? There's other options available. Hell, to quote a cetain dev, play Civ 5.
---
If you take your shitty Internet over to League of Legends ranked play, you'd run into the same issues.
---
NOED can feel unfair in a lot of solo matches. It isn't simple to cleanse 5 totems around the map before the gens are done while inversely you are slowing gen progress down by doing so all for the idea that MAYBE they're running NOED, it's even worse when they aren't as you wasted so much time for nothing.
---
Not to mention it feels unfair for the initial survivor at the end game to just get instantly downed from full health with no indication on to why until it's to late. Throw in the EGC timer, and looking for the totem at that point + going for saves isn't even feasible.
---
I'm fine with it but there are definitely plenty of circumstances where the killer can make the difference between kills/escapes with a single perk all the time just like survivors can.
---
Like I said I don't play Killer allot it's generally only for trophies/new killers I'll play Killer. Plus killer lobby times are terrible for me at the moment so I play mostly survivor.
---
Leave MoM alone BhVR, you guys have a real bad problem of making perks totally useless after you decide to rework them! Do you even play on PS4? NO YOU DONT YOU ALL SIT ON YOUR FUCKING PC’s, you know how hard it will be to get 3 protection hits playing solo on PS4? It’s hard enough now to get it to work because most of your killers on PS4 camp or tunnel and I quit running it because I was hardly able to use it or it would be gone within the first part of the match!
---
The changes aren’t final. It will go to PTB before being released. The fucking irony in that statement.
---
No matter how much a killer practices mettle of man will still go off, survivors will still bring instant heals. Both sides are fucked by stuff, no matter how hard they try, which isnt good in a game.
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
"After hitting 4 great skill checks, the next great skill check you hit will give an extra 5% progress"
---
Yes. Please teabag me on the other side of the window. It's totally safe.
---
I'm just speaking in terms of context clues. Like the perk art is a shot and a heart. I assume that means something. It always comes out of nowhere. And is reliable.
---
I'm just saying though if saboteur was meta then people would probably be saying the same thing about trapper. It sucks but these things exist for a reason. Hopefully they will get around to reworking sleepyboi and making him actually good
---
I see, I didn't read the last part mentioning that they are pushing it into the PTB before releasing it, my bad.
---

"MoM doesn't work against Leatherface" is my favorite smoothbrain survivor take. Leatherface's chainsaw doesn't gain distance and he gets the slow from charging it up, the only way LF should ever land a saw on you is if you are in a complete and utter dead zone, which shouldn't happen unless you're a bad survivor.
---
And I don't mean dead zone as in no pallets, I mean a COMPLETE dead zone -- no pallets, no vaults, *no lockers*.
---
&gt;The version we are testing internally at the moment is similar to the current version, however, rather than activating the perk after three basic attacks, the perk now activates after three protection hits. When active, any attack that would put the user into the dying state will be ignored. It is still a one-time use perk. We think these changes will force the user of the perk to make a conscious effort in order to activate it and should offer more counter play to those who come up against it.
---
This is good.
---
They specifically said that wasnt the final version, just something they are testing.
---
Calm the pitch forks jeez. Maybe they will make it 2 proctection hits, or something else entirely. Relax.
---
We have multiple devs who play primarily on console. The mechanics for protection hits work the same across all platforms. Technically speaking, if the killer is tunneling the unhooked survivor, you would have better chance of getting a stack since you could jump in the way and force them to hit you.
---
That isnt the fault of BHVR nor anyone. Swf are their own thing.
---
&gt; No I’m gonna trash them because there is nothing wrong with the version now!
---
Other than it being very powerful and another second chance perk.
---
While the MoM nerf seems harsh, there was nothing worse than playing an m1 killer, playing against a good team, and when you think you're finally going to get a down, nope.
---
It’s not that powerful and look at NOED
---
Thank God they're planning on Nerfing Mettle of Man.
---
shit you right. I don't play killers I like that much anymore because a level 3 hillbilly is no comparison to even a level 50 any other killer. So fucking unbalanced it's ridiculous... I still love it though
---
Because the ambush dash is a unique secondary attack. Phase walking is a movement ability that can be linked into a basic attack.
---
In what world is MoM situational? it's literal requirement is being hit by the killer.
---
I think they're full of shit tbh. There have been times when I am in a green ping lobby, all the way through the window starting to sprint away and I get chainsaw'd through the window. You can not tell me that's latency or "by design". Yeah the M1 hit through the window, I get that. But a full fucking chainsaw after I've already started to sprint away? NAH. Fuck that.
---
Yeah I don't use meddle and from what I've read it could use a change. It just seemed like a very hard nerf to me so I think it could be balanced better with a small bonus to the potential new change.
---
I love Halloween so much, I think the hours I play during that time are double what I normally play. I love the Theme's and lets be honest DBD &amp; Halloween = &lt;3
---
I love me My Freddy and wanted to get good with him. Plus I firmly believe that if you’re having a difficult time as a survivor against a certain killer? Play that killer until you get decent with them. You then learn how to effectively counter them at least a little bit. I have a friend who just couldn’t deal with A Spirit ever. And now he’s a Spirit main. He can literally predict almost everything a Spirit has, does, and is about to do because of it and it saves our lives every time.
---
Wait what? How are they catering to killer mains? They reworked Legion from being broken like last month.
---
So because someone isn't lucky enough to be in the same circumstances as you they shouldn't get to enjoy the same things? Dumb argument
---
I consider that as a total win.
---
Idk man my billy might as well be my nurse on console. I don’t loose often to almost at all with billy but I mained him like no other sometime ago
---
so... you don't get hit or go down at all, and you escape, and you are... upset that you didn't get to use one of your perks?
---
The heal is at 1:42
---
https://youtu.be/KjWLd5D5mqE
---
I did this for the numbers:
---
16 charges / 1.58 = 10.12 charges used per heal
---
10.12 charges × 5 heals = 50.6 charges.
---
The Medkit has 52 charges in it so that last 0.1ish heals the the last 1.4 charges roughly.
---
Ok?
---
at no point did i say MOM is balanced. I'm unsure why you are entering this discussion preaching as such.
---
No mention of the generator BP issue? Surprised it wasnt acknowledged
---
stoooop ;-;
---
Wraith = Bell, Clown = Bottles, Hag = Traps, MM = Stalking, Pig = Reverse bear traps/crouching, Plague = vomit. 
---
See where i'm going with this? There are like 3 killers, Billy, Leather billy and Huntress, who's power's focus on direct lethal damage. 
---
Stating "Just use your powers hur dur" is the equivelent of a killer main saying "Salty i killed you? just don't go down"
---
I just watch Farmer Joe. He's funny and a bit less annoying than Monto and Noob3.
---
I would gladly say that straight to your face.
---
auras are revealed from 40 meters for all tiers of the perk instead of 52/46/40 meters. is it that nerf you are talking about?
---
This killer, has a funny face
---
Distraction: OoO, Urban, Exhaustion, Q&amp;Q
---
Standard: DH, DS, BT, Flex (I swap between Adren and Iron Will)
---
Farm: Prove Thyself, WGLF, BT, Exhaust
---
Altruistic: BT, WGLF, Deliverance, SB
---
Mettle of Man rework sounds great. That's much fairer to killers. Ignore the survivor mains that say that the perk is balanced/is fair/isn't that powerful. Every killer knows that's not true. The reason why it's quickly became meta is because it's the opposite of those things.
---
Yeah because theres totally not 3-4 threads a day of survivors whining about a perk they can remove prior to it's activation.
---
This is a known issue. We have a fix internally and plan to hotfix it as soon as we can. We didn't mention it in the post because we tend to focus on big issues that have existed for a while, whereas this bug only recently popped up and is going to be fixed very soon.
---
He has a destiny profile picture, no point trying to make sense with him tbh
---
Pig has a dedicated fanbase, similarly to the Hag before her fixes. You're just noticing it more because she has cosmetics coming and that dedicated fanbase is excited.
---
Also, if you think she's a mediocre killer then you might want to check yourself. She's not.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the response
---
I mean I got 72k of them just nothing to spend them on lol
---
Concerning Panda, it seems that struggling to get rank 1 really changed his attitude towards the game. He still plays fair compared to other killer mains, but some of his opinions changed for the worst.
---
The most shocking change for me is his opinion towards noed and adrenaline. He used to be on neutral grounds for both, but now he's a fervent defender of noed, and absolutely hates adrenaline to the point of wanting a *nerf*. Like sure, nerf one of the few meta perks survivors have lmao.
---
Someone in his chat said survivors earned adrenaline by completing generators and staying alive until the endgame (I agree, it's a gamble, especially if you don't survive often) but Panda completely brushed off their opinion and was very condescending. I was genuinely shocked, because Panda is usually nothing but respectful. I still watch his streams, but if he goes off on a rant like that, I just mute him until he's done lol.
---
I hope they're gonna give us Brenda...
---
I don't want any other Survivor. 
---
Take The Scream and Parody version Brenda from Scary Movie.
---
In a perfect world yes, but if you have devs playing on PS4 they should know how bad this game has gotten with the killers. For the last few weeks it’s been nothing but a camp fest, but you guys state that camping is perfectly fine, and all the little kids along with the regular players have abused this into the ground! I’m not here to play a hook simulator game, I’m here to play the game as you designed it and also you now wait 10-15mins for a match then to be tunneled and camped from the start to then repeat over again for the next few hours.
---
I'd appreciate it if someone can summarize the BHVR/community-wide generally agreed upon motivations behind the Freddy rework, I don't play him exclusively but when I do play him I enjoy his gameplay loop more than a killer like Wraith and I've had success at high ranks/vs SWF groups, I've seen complaints that he sucks to play and that he's unfun to play against, which side holds more weight? Or is it just a mixture?
---
MoM really doesn't need changed. It already doesn't work against half the killers. If they make it any harder it would need to be reuseable at the very least to reward high risk gameplay.
---
i see this all the time. if theres not a wall gen then these two are together. im not sure why but ive started calling them the grandfather gens.
---
Giving it praise doesn't mean it becomes top tier.
---
It's extremely powerful in the hands of good survivors. And Noed can literally be removed from the game prior to it's activation so false equivalence.
---
Three protective hits are too much. Make it two.
---
That's when as Survivor, you complete 1 on the pier and the one between the rocks and do a gen across the map instead. Being conscious of where the gens are that are left is such a big part of playing survivor. Don't 3 gen yourself kiddos.
---
It always doesn’t end that way
---
Agree same here, it does suck almost everything they release now is cell only
---
You know what you don’t have to try for? Ruin. They just give you it. And they even just buffed it to affect all survivors at every level. 
---
You what else you don’t have to try for? BBQ. Not only is the requirement literally the killers whole entire goal, hooking people, but it even shows you auras of survivors and gives you 100% more BP. 
---
You know what they don’t buff? Survivor perks. I don’t even use MoM and I think adding these requirements are bullshit. Is it really so hard to hit someone, one extra time, once per game? Are people really that bad at killing?
---
Look at adrenaline? It was literally made to be the direct opposite of NOED and has huge usage rates according to the stats behavior put out recently
---
When you have borrowed time and unhooking in the basement or in front of the killer this would work out well.
---
But she is. B tier at best, probably even less now with the nerf.
---
&gt;Finding reliable heals from your team isn't easy to do, and the less time you spend healing the more time you spend progressing the game. 
---
My point exactly. So suck it up, stay injured if you have to and go hit a gen. The world is not going to end if you spend a minute injured
---
&gt;DS is hugely reliant on the killer not knowing how to play around it, and I don't use it anyways so I have no sweat using Botany over it. 
---
So you don't use the perk at all
---
&gt;I would also argue that Botany *reliably* saves far more time than DS ever will, especially if the killer has enduring. If they don't tunnel you, then DS is a dead perk. 
---
But you still claim to know how much time it saves and how often you get it off? That alone makes it almost impossible to take you serious at all.
---
If you're not an immersed baby and not afraid of throwing yourself at the killer (and that is without taking into account how most killers come back to the hook and/or tunnel anyways) you almost always can get the perk off. I would claim I successfully use it in AT LEAST two thirds of my games, and again, it wastes the killer's time.
---
You unsurprisingly forgot to adress this point, but there aren't enough medkit charges in the world to make up for the difference between saving time for yourself and wasting the killer's time. If I keep the killer busy, that's three people who can feeely do gens, while in the meantime you are saving your glorious 8 seconds self caring someone else may as well have hit the floor already
---
&gt;A medkit won't carry the game, since it has limited charges and Franklin's exists. SC + BK does have the possibility to carry a game, though. Bonus points if you do have a medkit with this, but It's better to just bring a toolbox.
---
You don't win the game by healing, you win it by completing generators while the killer is being kept busy by one of the four survivor players
---
&gt;Don't write off BK so easily, it really is a great perk.
---
I am not writing it off, hell I even use it sometimes in troll we'll make it builds. You just need to learn what an opportunity cost is. Just because a perk is good on paper doesn't mean there aren't better setups
---
Ok bye
---
im recalling all the hooked idiots who sprint for the one guy doing objectives cause theyre petty af
---
This post didn't get enough love /: you're awesome and i think any instance of positivity in this community should be respected, good on ya mate
---
Plague is more power then the legion. But whatever fits your play style.
---
I am still not a fan of that. Survivors could just spin their camera until they start hearing the terror radius.
---
True. All I truly wanted was 30 fps that never dipped. 
---
But 60 fps will feel so nice.
---
Yah but I play solo 99% of the time and this is on PS4 so most of the player base don’t touch totems unless they are hex, and this was a nice perk to have because most solo players don’t understand anything about teamwork and you are on your own. If anything make it 4 stacks for MoM, problem solved, but if they make it protection stacks, I can already see the nightmare coming on how random survivors are gonna play.
---
Sure. It's a mix of the two, not just one or the other. The three main ones are:
---
* 7 second delay before being able to attack feels bad for the killer. Survivors can unhook and cleanse a totem right in front of you and you can't do anything to stop it.
---
* His power doesn't feel satisfying to use. You don't see the effects of the slower progression, it's just something that happens in the background as you have a regular chase.
---
* Slower interactions aren't fun for the survivors. Staring at a progress bar moving at 50% slower speed just hoping for a skill check to appear so you can fail it isn't very engaging.
---
oh shit then i might try it lmao. that + pocket watch = even more broken nurse
---
enjoy the lobby wait times :D
---
&gt;did you just want the 4K? 
---
Lmao should've replied with, 'no I don't want to kill I play killer to open the exit gates for you all to escape' obviously sucks in egc when killer finds hatch before you do and exit gates aren't open but people need to seriously get off this entitled behavior they exhibit xD
---
PSN is Eazqa, will add you around 3:30EST.
---
Unless you're an emo stabby girl with a broken ruler.
---
Ruin can literally be deleted from the match.
---
BBQ is information, information is strong but it's not just a free down.
---
Anything that has an extremely powerful game changing effect on it should require work to get. Devour Hope is a good example on the killer side. One shots and moris are super powerful, but you need to get 5 unhooks without the totem being destroyed. You have to work for it.
---
That's exactly why I hate noed too. Its just given to the killer for free once all the gens pop. One shots and a speed boost for doing nothing is dumb. Just like getting a free hit for doing nothing is dumb.
---
It *does* need to be changed. In its current state it punishes lower tier M1 killers and completely ignores already strong killers like Hillbilly. It's already not hard to get it to proc, and especially in a organized and coordinated team it can really fuck over the killer.
---
They’ve done this several times in the past, including the last update I believe, as well as several dev streams. I wish I had the specific streams, but I’d recommend checking out the last few Q+A streams in particular.
---
He didn't trash them at all in his statement? He only said that the perk would be useless due to it being too difficult to activate, should that be implemented. They did mention it as a possibility, and transparency is best appreciated with reciprocation, which in this case is his opinion on that potential change.
---
Again play solo on PS4 and I don’t run adrenaline because most of the games don’t end with the gens done it was a wasted perk slot. They people that play on PS4 don’t play like people on PC
---
While I'm glad to see dedicated servers succeeding in the tests, I'm just wondering what will happen to OCE servers? Will we get a dedicated server? If we don't, will we remain P2P or forced to connect to overseas servers? (200 ping + every game if this happens)
---
Except he doesn't because this isn't left for dead.
---
Get em with bloodlust, it's more effective
---
Its very powerful, actually. Not necessarily on NOEDs level, but its sole weakness can be mitigated by 99% healing lol.
---
freddy.
---
That then brings up the question, at what level of player would you rank these perks for? I personally think that it should be ranked based on how they are used at their maximum potential. I think Object of Obsession is only used effectively by very few people because no content creators use it to its full potential, so everyone else considers it meh.
---
"Vsauce, Michael here. How much does getting stabbed... weigh?"
---
MOM was literally made to sell the Ash DLC.
---
Survivors are in the majority, and perhaps don't have the best perspective on how a survivor perk affects killer gameplay.
---
Not to revive this topic, but she just called the next update a chapter, sooo. This confirms it? Or is this poor vocabulary
---
At least use the good movie if you're gonna clip it
---
Yeah you’re the only one leaving XD.
---
He sucks to play. Any killer that requires several seconds before they can hit someone is not a good killer. You are powerless against totem cleansing, gen grabbing, and unhooks until the nonsense activates. He's been a walking meme for years now. One of the greatest horror icons of all time and they made him a joke.
---
The Wraith has his own problems, mainly that he should be able to walk through walls and pallets while cloaked/in his ghost world. That one change would be enough to make him upper mid-tier.
---
Do you guys ever get stuck on a tree? Because it happens all the time to me.
---
The permanent aura reading can be avoided if you heal yourself to 99% then heal when you are about to enter a chase. And that only occurs after your endurance procs.
---
i’ve seen her stream with 8bitdylan!
---
&gt; and this is on PS4 so most of the player base don’t touch totems unless they are hex,
---
Then they pay the price if the killer is using NOED. You have an option to defend yourself against the perk, if you don't take it then that's fine but you don't then get to turn around and claim that perk is bullshit or overpowered. DS was the closest equivalent to NOED pre-nerf, The difference between them though was that DS was blatently overpowered with no way for the killer to remove or negate it. They could lessen the impact with Enduring or they could try to juggle but that opened up many other possibilities for survivors to screw over the killer.
---
and this was a nice perk to have because most solo players don’t understand anything about teamwork.
---
I disagree, anyone who's going to use the perk will read the reqs for it and know they have to play better and more altruistically. Pre nerf MoM was another second chance perk that you could combo with other perks to unfairly punish the killer for doing their objective.
---
MoM into a dead hard into adrenaline or insta heal was bullshittingly OP and needed to be addressed.
---
At very most, it should be changed to need 4 hits to charge. As is, it activates automatically with 2 chases even if you never shake the killer. If it was changed to 4 hits, you'd be forced to shake the killer at least once to activate the perk.
---
Anything more than that is overkill.
---
"to balance this out so it isn't too strong, if you miss a skillcheck it regresses the generator back to 0%."
---
“This can only occur once per match and shows the killer your aura until the generator has been fully repaired”
---
Plague absolutely
---
Nope, purely a visual bug, restard the game and the "lost pips" magically restore themselves. And because of the system all people have to do is wait 3-4 minutes between matches and the system wont ban them for D/cing.
---
just tired of lobby wait times as killer....wtf else am i supposed to do?   yeah thought so, go buy some more and look at myself in the store....BM please
---
Uh...
---
1. You messaged someone telling them not to play someone or something like it's your choice to make
---
2. You preemptively decided you were going to kill everyone but one person because they agreed to your unreasonable demands
---
3. You called his teammates garbage
---
4. You told him he could help you get Devoted Gatekeeping, which can't really mean anyting but "help me find your teammates so I can hook farm them with you", and even if that wasn't the case, his teammates still got fairly fucked over with one teammate less to distract you
---
🤔 Am I missing something here?
---
B I G O I N K
---
i could see alaska or sharon being the model for the killer. the cosmetics could just be sharons runway looks
---
I don't play the game anymore (due too the frame rate on console) but I stayed with this committee too see how things progress and if they will fix the problems in the game.
---
I was losing hope (especially since the console optimization was not in the game in December as promised.) But right now the communication seems pretty solid and I'm glad they are addressing and better yet actually fixing big problems in the game.
---
I think we need the one from Scary Movie
---
Are you on pc or console?
---
I'm admittedly a new player so I don't know what optimal use of time looks like but I've been in the habit of working on the gen rather than self-healing unless I'm quite certain I will be going to save or protect another survivor.
---
I'm really bad at chases so far so most of the time, the first hit from healthy to injured won't save me more than 40 seconds. If I felt really confident that I could use this safety hit to consistently evade the killer, I would value this differently.
---
Successively you'd do 16 / 1.25 = 12.8 / 1.33 = 9.62 charges per heal. It would make sense for efficiency to apply cumulatively, I just always assumed it did not since I got my 5 heals out of the aforementioned combo.
---
I will check stuff in KYF again and report back.
---
This means we can undo the movement speed buff uptate and go back to old legion, right?
---
The problem is that the other half of the killers literally can not do anything about it. Every killer has an m1. Not every killer has a second damaging ability
---
A fellow survivor was on here the other day whining that he wasn't able to escape safely in EGC when he was the last man standing, already injured, and the killer had closed the hatch.
---
Some people just feel entitled to a second chance, and a second second chance, and a third second fourth chance, they feel like they should have a reasonable path to an epic comeback at any point in the game, even when they have arguably already lost the game. What they don't get is these amazing comebacks are only satisfying because of how uncommon and difficult to achieve they are.
---
Last survivor standing in EGC with two locked gates and a closed hatch should only very, very rarely be able to make it out.
---
Opposite for me when I'm killer.
---
Fair point. I was more referencing your attitude shifting from "fuck these devs" to "of course I don't know everything, thanks for the insight Mr Dev!"
---
&gt; it's just so boring and unnecessary to sit through over and over again
---
What? the average game lasts anywhere from 5-10 minutes, even if you're the first survivor found and killed and no one unhooks you you're at least getting 5 minutes between deaths (not including lobby times) having to wait 10 seconds every 5-10 minutes is NOT that repetitive.
---
Sometimes a post like this is either someone replies with “your a killer main you want this perk nerf.It was fine as is but the devs don’t care about survivors they only care about killers”,I mean don’t get me wrong killers do it to.
---
&gt;by the logic of tumblr you are a bigot
---
Mate if you use that as a deflection every-time someone calls you a bigot, you might actually forget the real definition.
---
This is me every time I try to drop a pallet injured. PS4 is just GREAT
---
Lol no. MoM doesn't reset on hooks.
---
Even if I tunnel you off hook every time, MoM is still activating. It takes no less than 4 hits minimum to kill a survivor if they're rescued at each hook state. Healthy&gt;injured&gt;hook1&gt;hook2&gt;hook3. If I'm tunneling you that hard, your team has probably already gotten at least 3 gens done if you're doing anything except  stand still, and they aren't all potatos.
---
MoM is guaranteed to go off if you run it unless you have the misfortune of going against a Huntress, Billy or Bubba. Myers has no counter to it. Clown has no counter to it. Wraith has no counter. Trapper has no counter. Hag has no counter. Ghostface won't have a counter to it.
---
The current MoM makes bad killers worse and buffs chainsaws and Huntress. The only good thing it does is nerf Nurse a little bit
---
Not sure what console you play on, but on xbox one X this games run pretty smooth for the most part. The last few patches have helped a ton.
---
wow thanks devs always showing survivors love :DDDDDD
---
fucking twats
---
At least just let the Killer hook you and then just don't struggle when it comes time. At least that way you still get the BP, the Killer was still dealing with you for a bit, and yeah. That's what I do on the odd match where I just want to go "Oh, fuck this shit".
---
&gt;I'm admittedly a new player so I don't know what optimal use of time looks like 
---
Don't worry, as this comment section proves, neither does 90% of the playerbase
---
&gt;but I've been in the habit of working on the gen rather than self-healing unless I'm quite certain I will be going to save or protect another survivor.
---
Kudos man. That is a healthy attitude to have. Always stay objective focused (if you actually wanna tryhard. This isn't a competitive game)
---
&gt;I'm really bad at chases so far so most of the time, the first hit from healthy to injured won't save me more than 40 seconds. If I felt really confident that I could use this safety hit to consistently evade the killer, I would value this differently.
---
Don't worry, we've all been there. I'd recommend taking things stealthy while slowly trying to improve in chases one step at a time (although I'll have to admit being injured makes stealthy plays hard because of the noise you make)
---
The health state obviously does make a huge difference for an experienced survivor, otherwise people wouldn't be complaining about Mettle of Men so much. My point is how most of the times, finishing another gen is more important.
---
If I'm on death hook and there are still three gens to be done, you can bet I am going to search someone to heal me. Just got unhooked and I know the killer is chasing the obsession? Off to the gen we go
---
And? It's literally a weaker Dead Hard, with it's only advantage being that its immune to lag, but you don't see people complaining about Dead Hard. It only comes in to play if you're letting survivors heal for free, and even then it only protects from one hit.
---
People aren't playing survivor atm because of the genny BP bug. It's extremely frustrating.
---
Dont you love getting obvious meme perks like pebble and head on, while killers get perks like Spirit fury and corrupt intervention in the same update?
---
Hold strong, fellow dream demon.
---
And we're killing mettle of man, nice ... cant we think twice before realeasing op perks and breaking it in to the mud before? (It will be now more useless than before against billy, bubba, huntress, legion etc ...)
---
I hope for a refound in the future for reworked perks that come out live.
---
\-Also nerf billy, he doesn't needs 110% speed or that easy sweet instadown, now we have a bigger killer roster there is no need for an unbalanced redneck-
---
It's a weaker Dead Hard. Run Nurses Calling and it will never affect you.
---
"activates the exposed status effect for the rest of the trial"
---
But the game tells you the killer is coming, why not just hide for 5 seconds when you hear the heartbeat? The killer may take a look at the gen while passing it, but if no one's there, what's he gonna do? Break chase to potentially find someone new who may aswell have already left?
---
Oh absolutely
---
Most people who attack someone with MoM up don’t have a survivor hooked. MoM is just a perk that buys time you get one extra hit to run to a pallet. The time bought doesn’t do as much with only one survivor on a generator compared to three.
---
I figured out why I don’t pip. I just played a game to show you why I don’t pip. I hooked every survivor twice and only got 10% on devout. You don’t get any points in devout if you don’t kill. Even then malicious was only silver despite the eight hooks; only 19% was deducted for heals. Chaser was gold; only 9% off iridescent. Gatekeeper was gold with 75%, so just barely.
---
There was also a MoM which turned a 2 second chase into 20-30. Basically if he had run to a pallet during the sleep transition. Everyone except the survivor with MoM had self care, the direct counter to Freddy. 
---
Maybe I don’t see your problem with MoM because I already have so much stuff to deal with that it doesn’t change anything. I will have skill checks that wake survivors, the sleep transition, the inability to guard generators once they are past a certain point. 
---
The way I see MoM isn’t when you get hit with it, it’s when you choose to activate it.
---
It literally does not. It takes no less than 4 m1 hits to kill a survivor if they're rescued at each yook state. MoM is guaranteed to go off unless your team allows you to die on hook. MoM doesn't reset stacks on hook. You get it by existing in the game
---
SuRvIvOrS ArE ToO OvErPoWeReD!1! We just need to make more of a big deal about things we want changed apparently and they will do it. MoM didn't need a change imo and now it is useless. Awesome that you crybaby killer mains got what you wanted.
---
Damn I just stared using mom. Been a long time since we got a really good perk and now it gets trashed already....
---
More blood for tracking m8
---
every time i try to invite someone
---
changes to tier 1/2 perks are irrelevant, only the tier 3 matters, you have no argument.
---
I played as a perkless freddy and got a 4k with a bunch of rank 9s he's not useless
---
Why is it ok for killers to have so many powerful, second chance perks? The end game change is near impossible to escape unless the hatch spawns right in front of you. The current state of the game isn’t as fun as it was for solo playing survivors. They are literally changing the game to require you to have to swf because so many killers act as though that’s all they encounter. The massive changes still hasn’t changed killers play style when it comes to tunneling and camping, and now they (especially on console) seem to do it more knowing that they can close the hatch and hold the last person hostage to watch the entity kill them when time runs out. I’m all for balance but it needs to be balance that makes you want to play both, not just balance for whichever side complains more on the forums. If they want to continue to make survivor more and more difficult then they need to give us more hiding places, or more resources that might help you survive.
---
MoM allows for so many greedy plays and misplay second chances, plus the perk has no drawback currently. I fucking abused this this as survivor to get free WGLF stacks cause knowing you can make a stupid play and get away with it is just the definition of skilless play.
---
If the one they're currently chasing has been going for too long, yes. Or just to ensure the gen starts regressing and then looking for whoever was there. And depending on where you are, there may not be any decent spots to attempt to hide.
---
Thanks for the response. I appreciate the transparency to the community!
---
My mind went to "Console Billy" as in he's trying to make Kate feel better....because it looks like he's touching her shoulder.
---
I'll have to look up the dev update then. I like that change. Even as a survivor I actually felt bad using MoM. It was such a dumb perk, especially when paired with the other perks like BT and Adrenaline.
---
I admit i have gotten hits through windows and be like thats bullshit but you can chainsaw right after the hop their back basically touching the window still
---
Destiny players tend to be a little more painful to deal with
---
Really? I play on ps4 but last time I played was on the new snow map (I know that thing was pushed out with it being choppy as hell)
---
I'm kinda waiting for dedicated severs since i play mostly killer and don't want people too have too deal with my shit internet. Hopefully that's soon cause I really want too get back into this game.
---
If your feet are on the floor after vaulting, it should DEFINITELY not hit you.
---
Lol that assumes the protection event actually occurs like its programmed to lmao
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49385/fog-whisperers-program-launch
---
&gt; Can't we appreciate their transparency without trashing them for decisions that may not even make it into the game?
---
It's funny you say that, because when it was suggested they were going to make changes to The Pig, people here flipped their fucking shit, and flooded the sub with pro-pig posts, which only stopped when the developers rolled back that suggestion. 
---
perhaps the devs have encouraged this behavior (heh) by catering to the loudest responses.
---
Mettle of man
---
Nurse sucks on console because she prefers mouse controls over gamepads. So the only S tier killer remaining for high rank play is Billy boi.
---
The compromise they have created is actually pretty fair.
---
It should though, remember a weapon has length then add on arms of the killer it definitely has the reach to bap u on the head
---
You mean minority.
---
I feel ya there man. From what I've heard PS4 still has pretty choppy framerates (don't quote me on that tho). Needless to say I think that there is light at the end of the tunnel for all of us console players.
---
what? making the first two tiers the same to the third (talking about wallhack, not percentages) is irrelevant? and you call that "nerf"? you have no argument.
---
Green ping is up to 100ms... And this number is high enough to start noticing "behind the wall" hits
---
STOP DC-ING BECAUSE I HIT YOU, JUST STOP IT STOP. STOP IT STOP NOW STOP IT.
---
DBD is an online only game. If you can't stay online you can't play the game.
---
You can wait before hitting a survivor to avoid Dead Hard. Really easy. The only counter to MOM is not hitting survivors.
---
Do you know how easy it is to get hit three times for the perk to activate now? At least the reworked version has counterplay.
---
Survivors block for other survivors regularly. In basements, after unhooking, while others are being carried to hooks, when found after working on gens together, in general while leaving an area, during gate escapes. It's very easy to get three stacks of it. It's MUCH fairer to killers than what is currently present.
---
I’m a hardcore M1 killer and think that is too much
---
I think a real big problem for ps4 is the fact that you guys didnt allow anyway for people to include text when they report bugs. When I go to report something that happened I can only click a button to say whether it was griefing, exploits, or whatever. I feel like the devs might actually have a clue as to what happens on console if we could give more info.
---
Including doing literally nothing for 4 seconds and forcing the killer to guess where you went.
---
It's counterintuitive to get "protection hits". You're literally just putting your team at a disadvantage by taking unnecessary hits while someone is being carried etc. risking going down faster or having to waste time healing instead of doing generators.
---
Honestly why would you even release a strong perk encouraging people to buy the DLC only to make the perk near useless a few weeks later? This is not ok. What about the people who bought the DLC because they wanted the perk? I feel like I've been scammed honestly.
---
ALL GENS WERE NEAR HIM (BOTH EXIT GATES AND 2 GENS WERE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER &amp; HE WAS BETWEEN THEM) SO I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE. IT WAS EITHER TRY IT OR GET RUN DOWN BY HIS STUPID CHAINSAW. I TOOK MY CHANCES AT THE HATCH. DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD COMPLETELY BODYBLOCK IT
---
This is what I think most people don’t take into account. I play on Xbox. Solo playing survivor isn’t that fun anymore. The community has never played in the matter that’s always stated by pc players. My experience as killer isn’t queuing into a massive amount of swf and the ones I do get I never (especially now) seem to have a problem with. Frame rate is different, movement is different, killer tier list is different. Yet our version of the game continues to be changed as though we play in the same manner.
---
The first 2 tiers mean nothing when it comes to balancing.
---
&gt; Tyde, is this an out of season April Fool's joke?
---
Myers and Spirit release are the absolute best IMO. Two amazing killers. Now that sound is broken, spirit isn’t as effective! And DS is now a proper perk.
---
I noticed that once and stood on top of the hatch waiting to see what the killer would do. I jumped in and he tried to grab me lol
---
because people make ignorant assumptions ;p lowkey that's the reason why i put i think current MoM is fun. I always use it so i'm not biased ;p
---
this, this, this. since DbD's beginnings, new players (even players with a few hundred hours on their belt) will prioritize healing over gens.  
---
I have 4k hours, and after playing with some friends that are new to the game, I realize that healing is prioritized...simply because people dont know how to loop, fundamentally. they fell that, if they are found, its over for them. no speed boost from an m1, just WHACK. so, they panic. self care in the 'least conspicuous place' possible and contribute nothing until maybe gens get done for you.   
---
frustrating, we all deal with it as consequence.
---
It's really tough to find out what's a good fix for strong perks. People are always going to voice out strongly on their feelings towards Mettle of Man. It's really confusing for them to want to nerf it but not so terribly that its useless. People currently are complaining that its DS 2.0 or a super strong perk but when they make changes. It's never gonna be satisfying for either side... DS however, was a good change but I think we need more testing rather than hoping it won't be the final version. Also, I haven't seen it being used all that much compared to DS when it came out, is it really a huge problem? Maybe it's the region I'm playing at which is the main factor of why I haven't encountered alot of survivors using it even though they play Ash.
---
They are just promotional art for cosmetic.
---
Besides the awful tier lists and the cockiness, he also liked a tweet that said if not for Twitch, another streamer would be a cam whore. That isn't a very cool thing to do.
---
Agreed.
---
But if I have control of my character, and am actively running away, my hitbox should not stay in the window.
---
Damn man, can't even be mad at that.
---
How does Nurse's Calling help, exactly? You still have to hit the survivor. They will still get their stack. There's no counterplay.
---
Your not wrong
---
“After being downed while exposed disable 1/2/3 perks for the remainder of the trial”
---
I don't have much opinion on this perk because I am a huntress main and I've never been hit by MoM while playing as her but just about every lobby damn near almost every runs it, average of up to 3 survivors. Huge perk with zero counterplay, it all depends on the killer you are using or if your killer's power benefits them in terms of actually killing, that is completely unhealthy for the game from a balance standpoint. Obviously it is useless against me and laughable when I see it in postgame because in my opinion a waste of perk slot when going against an experienced huntress, but same cannot be said for poor m1 killers. I think it should be changed from it's current state but the state they first mentioned in changing it to makes it a pretty meh perk so I don't know, they need to find a way to make it a good obsession perk like it is now while also making it balanced and having counterplay to it other than chasing them even further for yet another hit, that is NOT a counterplay lmao.
---
the nerf? I mean honestly MoM can stay as is, i think the huge issue with the perk is going agaisnt 4 mans that are all using it. I was able to survive before this perk existed, i will also survive if it gets nerfed a little bit :p
---
in my opinion it makes a difference, maybe not that big as noed being one shot on all tiers, but still these two perks are comparable. there are many killers using noed on tier 1
---
Hasn’t everything else they claimed to be testing been implemented into the game? More than likely it will be. Think about it. All perk reworks that they have tested have ended up exactly how they said that would.!
---
I never said anything in the *slightest* to curse out the devs, and I never said I knew everything about them in the first place. I was more pointing out the fact people might have had a point that BHVR has a lot more artists than people working on optimisation, but then the dev explained that the optimisation team is in a fine position. None of it was backpedaling.
---
Usually after a long chase a lot of loops have been destroyed because of pallets breaking. This means that after every chase the survivors have less at looping and making it easier to secure a kill.
---
That is precious and was worth the wait. Thank you.
---
Thats different than feet planted after the window, they say hitboxes are/seem bigger due to desync which they are going to fix with dedicated servers
---
Both sides bitch and moan about each other
---
I really didn't care if it changed or not but what made me happy is that devs are listening to complaints and a very reasonable nerf such as this SHOULD shut every one up. I mean "every one" is impossible but i think BHVR has done a good job recently of doing reasonable changes that only dummys can hard complain about
---
&gt;Being hit through the window is by design. A window is an opened element and killers should be able to reach through it. 
---
They finally said it. Thank you. Killers have arms. They can reach through windows. Get over yourself
---
Try to get three protection saves in a game.
---
blood doesnt show when phasing tho lmao
---
&gt; Why is it ok for killers to have so many powerful, second chance perks?
---
Like what exactly? Noed and BW? You can't make a statement and not list them off.
---
&gt;The end game change is near impossible to escape unless the hatch spawns right in front of you.
---
The end-game collapse can only be triggered by the door being opened or the hatch being closed. If the doors open than you can stealth and leave through that. If the hatch is closed than you already lost the match because any decent killers not going to leave the area once they found the hatch regardless of the collapse. If you're the last survivor than hide next to the gate and wait for the killer to close the hatch and start opening the door. If you're lucky you can get it open before the killer gets to you. If not than oh well try again next round, when the game gets down to a 1v1 the more powerful side is *supposed* to have the advantage over the weaker side.
---
&gt;The current state of the game isn’t as fun as it was for solo playing survivors.
---
Because solo survivors are *supposed* to have a difficult time. You get the advantage of 3 other players whether you want their help or not. Theres 1 killer, they have to work hard and concentrait to meet their objective, you dont. If you wanted to you could urban immerse yourself and let the other 3 do the gens and then escape without doing any work. The killer dosent get that luxury. 
---
&gt;They are literally changing the game to require you to have to swf because so many killers act as though that’s all they encounter.
---
Except they're not. They're making changes to perks that are clearly stronger than they need to be in order to make it a fairer game for both sides. There are still a myriad of perks suited to solo play, not every single surv perk needs to be powerful or meta.
---
&gt;The massive changes still hasn’t changed killers play style when it comes to tunneling and camping, and now they (especially on console) seem to do it more knowing that they can close the hatch and hold the last person hostage to watch the entity kill them when time runs out.
---
Not going to bother, you seemed to repeat your first topic.
---
&gt;I’m all for balance but it needs to be balance that makes you want to play both, not just balance for whichever side complains more on the forums.
---
This is balance. Just because they nerfed one side dosent instantly mean they need to nerf the other to keep it "fair".
---
&gt;If they want to continue to make survivor more and more difficult then they need to give us more hiding places, or more resources that might help you survive.
---
No, No they don't. There are already sufficient resources and perks available to you that you can use to win and survivor, the average escape rate is 2 survivors per match. If 2 kills and 2 escapes are the average like BHVR said than i think it's pretty balanced don't you.
---
&gt;And depending on where you are, there may not be any decent spots to attempt to hide.
---
That's true, point taken. Even though I've had some extreme cases were the killer was so focused on the chase I was able to just crouch at one side of the generator and hide that way :D
---
But that's obviously a pepega killer and irrelevant to the argument.
---
Maybe I am just lucky, but I rarely fall victim to someone bringing the killer to me, and whenever I do, I usually messed up or went greedy and refused to hide, so the blame's on me
---
That being said, fuck people sideways who actually go out of their way and try to lure the killer to their mates on purpose
---
Indeed. I mean maybe there's a better idea out there but i think this version will pass through especially if they were confident enough to share what they're trying out
---
You're both correct and autistic.
---
I hope they’re willing to refund the money for Ash after they nerf MoM.
---
Wait. Ppl still DC against legion? He sucks now! So easy to play against 😂
---
You're not explaining how she's skilless and cheap. Why is she that?
---
Adrenaline is only reliable in a swf group, with randoms it's more than likely you'll get at least one useless teammate who just urban evades everywhere and never touches a gen. When you've got teammates like that you need self care or some sort of healing because the game will take too long
---
why are there tiers if 1, 2 and 3 gives you almost the same thing? im pointing out that it wasn't nerf at all, you could rather say that it was a buff since all tiers give you the same wallhack
---
The MoM changes are very disappointing, it was already hard to get it to activate and now it's basically impossible.  Extremely limited use.
---
“Omg a purple medkit yaass!! 
---
Gonna heal so fas— oh fuck!!”
---
lmao
---
If everybody brings Mettle of Man, it doesn't matter who the obsession is, they all get one free extra hit.  It's another 'stronger in numbers' perk like Adrenaline and Decisive strike.
---
[Don't waste your money next time.](https://youtu.be/oL2B-AAnsHo)
---
Nah, that's too much. Maybe 4 injured states means you ignore an instance of getting downed, but ignoring an instance of going from full to down is too specific
---
It shouldn't be though. When I encounter NOED as a survivor, my teammates swarm the hook like moths to a lamp and a 1k turns into a 3k. Just leave.
---
true.
---
Legion is super fun now and actually pretty good. Plague is cool, but against good teams you'll never use half your power cause they'll just never cleanse.
---
As mentioned there are some issues with the 5 man starting games. I had a game where I ran around went to a box got and item played the game for a few minutes with everyone in the game was there and then randomly I was taken out of the game and it said the match was canceled because someone DCed while it was loading but I was with SWF and everyone else was still in the game. I just thought this would be a good place to let someone know. Also it let me keep my item and my points that I got that game so idk what happened.
---
The dev updates are nice. Having them kind of address “controversial” issues is really nice. I use to play Battlefront 2 and it always seemed like complaints were falling on deaf ears. It was bad.
---
Sloppy Butcher makes it take a lot longer to heal which is good for you. People will either spend a lot more time healing or they'll stay injured And make you're chases easier too.
---
90% of campers will have Noed too.
---
Oh yeah Breakdown sounds fun, too ! Thanks
---
Meddle shouldnt be nerfed....you need to get hit 3 times to even get it. That's your 2nd down if you can even get used out of it against killers like Billy and such. Oh well.
---
Most killers even when you know how to play them well they can do poorly without addons ... exept billy and nurse ... and they have addons to make their jobs easier.
---
Depends on how much attention the Killer is paying, yeah. I've had times where hiding by the gen itself has worked, and other times where Killers seemed to have this sixth sense that I was behind the tree 20 metres away, lol. 
---
It doesn't happen all the time to me, however there are certainly matches where, like I said, everyone who gets hit seems to immediately gravitate towards me. So it's just that perception, some people have it happen match after match, and it can become infuriating. 
---
As for actually doing it on purpose, I do it once in a blue moon. Like a few days ago I had this team mate who led the Killer to me FOUR damn times. Two on the same freaking item chest I was trying to open, no less. There was no way in hell all of them were by accident, either. 
---
So at one point, when I was getting chased and they were healing, and I saw they were nearby, I was like - PAYBACK TIME, BITCH. 
---
However, as a general rule, I try to actively avoid wherever my team mates might be, and try and keep a mental note of where the gens are, what ones have been done, etc etc, actively lead the Killer away from ones we're trying to get done, stuff like that.
---
My point is said change is completely irrelevant because the tier 3 didnt change. Perks are balanced around their tier 3, not their tier 1 or 2. 
---
The locker-change however was an objective nerf to the perk, if you dont want to get spotted by it you wont, and if being chased *negatively* affects your gaming-experience, well I'd have some other things to say but I don't think we wanna go there.
---
It just increases wiggle movement and obscures hook auras. You can actually use the increased wiggle movement as a killer to get faster to a hook thanks to impulses if you position yourself accordingly, and 10/10 times you are going to see a hook nearby without the need for an aura, and if you have to look harder its not close to enough for the survivor to wiggle out.
---
Boil Over only works in a full Voicecom SWF Sabo Squad, in Solo is completely useless.
---
A fellow P3 Spirit understands the feeling of having multiple perfect phase hits be ignored.
---
Killers would complain about it being to op!! I could see it now lmaoo
---
That is just completely inaccurate. My MoM hardly ever goes over. It’s a clutch perk in certain situation - like running to hatch/door to escape or taking an extra hit while saving a hooked survivor.
---
If you are injured it will work, but if he Tier 3 hits you from the healthy state it's still an instant down.
---
I fucking hate this change. Survivors with WGLF and MoM will have no reason not to storm a picked up survivor and take hits. People won’t be playing the game the way it’s meant to be played, games will get tanked really hard by MoM users if this change goes through.
---
How close do you have to be? I've taken hits when I thought I was close enough with no stack.
---
Uh disagree
---
Botany also gives you 133% when regular healing others which is nice :)
---
Freddy is gona be reworked in a few weeks don’t worry about it
---
bro, can this meme stop? is not funny. its worst than a instagram meme tbh
---
Don’t you get what some people are saying to you. CONSOLE PLAY STYLE AND ISSUES ARE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE ON PC. You keep writing out these long term papers trying to present yourself as smarter but you’re still missing the point. He/I am on console. Meta is different, killers used is different, killers play style/ survivors play style is different, movement is different, frame rate is different, swf issue is different. Instead of trying to pick apart every statement that you don’t agree with how about you actually take into context what’s being written. Is their a dbd reddit for console issues? Since every time one of us tries to explain the issues we are having we are downvoted, told we are wrong or over exaggerating, or ignored because pc issues are more dire.
---
AFAIK, Myers T3 doesn't proc it. At least, that's what my friend said two nights ago when he learned that the hard way.
---
Trapper can just pick survivors up off traps. That doesn't feed a MoM proc. Yeah, that's not very realistic, but realistically, no killer is going to get away with using only their power the whole match, not even Billy.
---
Do you die when it doesnt go off? And are you potatoing and getting pulled out of windows and off gens? Because, again, MoM is guaranteed to go off unless you're up against a Huntress or the chainsaw brothers or you die on an early hook
---
agree
---
This. In more than half of my games with MoM, it's basically just a wasted perk slot.
---
Yeah. I find that fun.
---
Killers also have lots of insta down perks. I dont see why survs shouldn't be allowed to counter that. Noed, make your choice... I usually get at least two downs with haunted grounds.
---
Very true! i feel bad for the m1's another reason why this is a great nerf good point
---
T3 Myers ignores it only if the survivor is at full health. If they're injured, MoM ignores the hit
---
Yeah i see, i was tempted to use No Mither with Unbreakable so i can recover two times haha. I'll go for Tenacity and Breakdown
---
Exactly, PC, PS4, and Xbox are all on there own separate planets, on how the game is played by its players. Each one is different and how this game behaves on different platforms affects us all different. But yet we are forced to play by the PC communities guidelines. I know it would probably be a nightmare to put out a different patch’s for each platform but as the game changes and the player base stays the same on each platform, there should be some compromises for each. But a Dev told me about 30mins ago that they have devs playing on consoles, I just don’t think they really understand how being on consoles vs pc are totally different and how the game reacts. PS4 and I’m sure Xbox has thousands of more younger, to a kids player base than PC does. With that right there playing solo survivor is the difference.
---
A requirement that you meet EVERY match by just getting hit. That's it. Staying injured at 99% is barely a downside. Everyone who bought Ash **just for MoM** is the definition of someone who spent money on p2w. People shouldn't feel forced to buy a perk only because it's a stronger, more consistent perk. I'm fine with them keeping the strong part of the perk, but removing the consistency is definitely needed.
---
If your MoM is used every game, you’re clearly not very good at survivor. There is no guarantee for anything.
---
I get the frustration, but think about it from a dev perspective too. What gameplay is there to survivor? Running and hitting skill checks? Throwing down pallets? The survivor side gameplay is so overly simplistic compared to what goes into playing killer that it surely makes it difficult to design varied and useful perks that also don't break the game when multiple survivors have them in the same trial. That's where MoM failed. It was implemented without context of the other 3 survivors who might also have it, SWF who definitely will have it, and half the killer roster.
---
I'm only 6 months in and I don't want to jump to PC.
---
&gt; Again. I’M A CONSOLE PLAYER. OUR ISSUES AREN’T THE SAME AS PC ISSUES.
---
I'm a console player too how wierd.
---
&gt;But I see you actually don’t take that into account and you like to pick apart and play the semantics game with anyone you don’t agree with. 
---
I literally explained to you in another post how that's not the case, Anyone YOU disagree with you claim to be doing so because they don't "understand your point" maybe you should stop and think for a bit and actually read the arguments made against you instead of just constantly claiming the other people are in the wrong.
---
Yes they have
---
Yup I agree.
---
Dance With Me is fun to use tho
---
AFAIK, as long as you spam space bar in front of the locker, you will always grab the survivor, even if they've timed your tantrum and are exiting.
---
Yeah, I worded it incorrectly, thanks for pointing that out. Let me try again. A requirement that you meet EVERY match against the poorer killers, who don't have a damaging M2 ability. Which isn't a good situation to create, and you certainly don't need me to spell out why.
---
Well its situational in that it doesnt work with every killer. If I get nurse or Billy (half my games) I lose a perk slot.
---
Botany Knowledge takes the selfish out of selfish care. 
---
I wish more potatoes tried it.
---
I mean, Ash is ugly and loud as fuck?  Flip Flop is fun don't @ me.
---
That's crazy, what rank are you playing at?
---
Strong build my man. Im with you
---
https://youtu.be/q-yZ7_enlWA?t=96
---
DS was only really OP for one person, the obsession. MoM is the same for all players, so you can get up to 4 extra hits needed, rather than 1 with a big stun.
---
Fair enough. I'll add an edit.
---
Corrupt intervention is very good on Billy if you know what you are doing
---
Or rape
---
You're definitely not creepy.
---
Nurse: "Here goes nothing..." *blink*  😲
---
Wait until you see the chapter 13 killer: The Diddler.
---
"Nothing else to make it work"
---
Except that whole part where you have to unhook someone. 
---
"Botany is low tier"
---
Not even close.
---
I wish they didn't nerf remember me, the only decent perk that came with freddy
---
If there are devs playing on console then I would like them to do a q&amp;a for console players. I would like to hear about their experience, which console they play on, the amount of hours they do play, ect. You’re right Xbox has a way younger player base I’m not complaining about it since I myself have kids that I play games with ( Overwatch and Fortnite). But that’s what I don’t think they or this forum takes into account. Our experiences are different and these changes are affecting some in a negative way.
---
&gt;Well its situational in that it doesnt work with every killer.
---
There's 3 killers it dosent directly work on / they counter it through power usage. Billy, nurse (which i actually think has been changed so her power affects mom now) and Leather billy.
---
the other 12 killers are m1 killers who's power dosent counter MoM.
---
OH IF YOU DIDNT KNOW THATS OK THEN, NOW YOU KNOW
---
Did they confirm it was almost finished?
---
You want to kill with the phone and fish nets?
---
That's how it works for anyone playing survivor. They buy for the perks. The survivors don't offer anything themselves aside from a new skin. If they each had a base stat buff this would be more of a valid thing to say
---
&gt;DS was only really OP for one person, the obsession.
---
DS was way stronger for non obsessions to be honest. Dribbling didn't work and you wasted more of the killers time when it hit. Yes, you were more likely to not get use out of it, but I think it was worse to get hit by a non obsession than by your obsession
---
Getting major Lovecraftian vibes from this.
---
Nice.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
It's ok, i'm fine with no sleep anyway.
---
Basically every perk is good on Billy if you know what you’re doing, so I’m not sure that’s a good barometer of whether a perk is good or not.
---
Plague. She is stronger and she has Infectious Fright, which is a very good perk for Nurse and Myers.
---
Forgot about that perk, you're right. I only have Kate left to level up so i guess i'll continue
---
Hag is fine as she is.
---
No they haven't.
---
Spark of madness is doctor &amp; Feng and Lullaby is Huntress and David, no spotlights for either.
---
Um as an Ash main I take great offense to this.
---
Wow your way out in left field, 
---
My Shirtless Myers has no problem with MoM, And he has no problems getting 3-4K games. I also main Nurse, He is a P3, and I bounce from rank 2-7 with him, after the rank reset I’m at 10 right now, I work for a living so I play when I can, but I like both sides equally and survivor rank has been from 1-12 normally and I was at 6 before rank reset and now sitting at 13. I’m a devotion 4-78 as of now, and I can tell you this, it doesn’t matter what fucking rank you are on PS4 on DBD, the player base can be really good late at night during the weekend and then a total shit show the rest of the week. I’ve been in the high ranks and most of them guys play like they are rank 18’s, do you know how many skill checks a rank 2 will miss skill checks on a gen with no hex ruin verse a rank 18 player? I play on PS4 99% of the time solo survivor, until I’m done being camped or dealing with shithead random teammates and go play killer to have fun.
---
because thats how life works
---
Dude, just imagine having bloodwarden blocking the gates for the rest of the collapse.  then walking between the survivors tea bag and leave.
---
It’s incredible how quick they are to nerf any good or strong survivor perk. This was active for like a month before it got nerfed to being useless. Thanks for letting me waste my money on this DLC.
---
"Hello? Who are you??"
---
"Hello, Brian. I'm Ghostface. Some call me Scream. Both are due to similar cases..."
---
"What do you want from me?"
---
"*I want you to scream!*"
---
You just want to sit and complain, pick apart, and play semantics on Reddit all day. Which console? send me an invite.
---
DRAG RACE THIS BITCH.
---
I’ll have to see how this change affects Killer behavior. I don’t have Mettle of Man, but I try to take hits for people if they’ve already been on a hook or are getting tunneled to shit. Will Killers think I’m running MoM now?
---
&gt;Killers learn to know when to give up and find someone else...
---
In the long term it's far more viable to just secure kills when you can get them.
---
Swf
---
Honestly all of that sounds pretty damn good. Can't wait till it's in the game.
---
More blood for tracking in general
---
I didn't realize that I had two accounts... This is my main. Please comment under this so it pops for me.
---
EGC was never to stop the toxicity at endgame. It was to stop survivors and killers from needlessly extending the game time.
---
Mr. X would be cool, I can imagine his power being like a charged hit to daze survivors (with CD so they can still run off) but he's really the only one I can "see" in this game rn.
---
Take an eye test
---
Same honestly. I’d be hard to make a kit for him but definitely possible with the right people
---
Wallhacks are so OP, Oh My Gosh, I am so scared by the killer who can see me. Meanwhile, I run Object of Obsession and I give 2 shits is the killer can see me. If the killer isn't a Nurse or a Spirit, I can loop his ass so hard with OoO, but no, wallhacks are OP for killer, REEEE.
---
If a Rank 1 survivor could play in the early versions he would be unbeatable. 
---
Double the pallets, no entity blocker (infinites were a thing), no exhaustion.
---
Gens were faster to repair, you could heal yourself and others faster, We'll make it applied to self healing and it was stupidly fast (watch the video).
---
https://youtu.be/G0K3uvG6b4k
---
Also Brand new part insta repaired gens so if 4 people organized they could repair 4 gens in the first 10~20s of the match (the time it takes for every person to go to a different generator).
---
And also sabotaging broke hooks and trapper traps permanently.
---
Yeah... not OP. Good survivors were literally unbeatable.
---
Only time when killers (only Nurse actually) were stupidly OP was when Nurse had 115% movement speed and 3 blinks by default.
---
She is still OP now but back then it was even worse.
---
If you want to learn more about Freddy, which from the looks of it you are, this guide is awesome.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628612661
---
One thing that definitely needs correcting, Freddy is only a slow killer when you use the Red Paint Brush, every time else he has normal speed, with a very slight slowdown right when he is pulling survivors into the dreamworld. Also, his lunge is the same as with all killers.
---
Thats pretty much the meta these days at the higher ranks.  Can't tell you how many times i've seen the last gen pop and all 4 survs heal to full.  Demoralizing as shit for the killer.
---
Looking at you Harajuku Graffiti Nea
---
I think his M1 could be a good ole tentacle slap lol
---
Bloodwardens actually not bad honestly
---
Downvoted because of the truth, wow
---
I have trouble getting along with Spirit I cant phase very well but she is one of my least played killers so that's the reason lol. She is cute tho
---
Please no more nerfs
---
No. Your survivors that keep killing themselves are either selfish, short on time/patience, or low ranked, because most survivors learn that a camping killer, even if it means they're gonna lose, is an easy victory for the team. Let's assume each survivor has a toolbox: even if they all work on the same gen, or two and one work on gens, regardless of the outcome, 3 gens can be done in the two minutes you're on the hook. The best option, unless you have Borrowed Time, is to go for Option 2. If it's a Leatherface, then skip option 1 entirely and just go to Option 2, there's no point throwing your bodies at a trap.
---
Agreed. I never could use it well.
---
Yah in dev blog
---
And then the survs complain if the killer runs noed as of it. I’m staying well away from the game for now tbh
---
I think MoM needs a change but (as a killer main) I think protection hits is not the way to go... those are way buggy in how they register. I'm not sure which change to make to MoM but maybe make it so that you can't get stacks consecutively in the same chase (but please don't use just the chase, put a CD in it, breaking chase is stupidly easy).  
---
We don't have the need to either have an OP perk or a dog shit one. Unless it also comes with more clarity to what will generate a protection hit and what won't the perk will be pretty useless.
---
Legion, their power was kinda weak but had little counterplay, there wasn't much of a chance to actually escape a Legion, only buy time.
---
*Then, everything changed when the nerf nation attacked.*
---
Their power was made significantly weaker, you were punished a lot more for making mistakes, and tracking while using the power was further reduced.
---
Overall, they're much stronger as a basic killer, but the power doesn't help much without the right circumstances.
---
Laughs in sprint burst
---
Fix people being able to 99% their heals and I'm ok with this.
---
I don't think I've ever noticed "behind the wall" hits unless my ping was 120 and above. 100ms is yellow for me. Dunno if it is for you or not. 
---
Just sharing my experience. I was a little salty when posting this ngl but my sentiment is still the same.
---
Solid play...best dbd player ever...
---
but, well, wallhacks are op in fact. and the thing with object of obsession is that it's your choice to play with and your choice when to look at the killer and when not.
---
It's almost like Survivors aren't allowed to have good perks like Killers can...
---
MoM was in need of a nerf but 3 protection hits is crazy... they will kill the perk for good.
---
I could see that as being a possibility.
---
Who do you play? I think having an expose/insta down is really good for the perk
---
but there are several perks that are instadowns, or a killer at least has an alt. way of damaging survivors. Hillbilly, Trapper, Myers, Huntress, Bubba, Legion, and Plague can all ignore MoM if they use their power effectively. If you throw in add-ons, then so can Clown and arguably Spirit with grabs. If you throw in perks, then every single killer has the potential to counter MoM.
---
Will it still possibly activate? Yes most likely, but when it activates and how dead the survivor is at that point makes a huge difference. To say it's impossible to counter and is a guaranteed auto loss every match for you is a great over exaggeration.
---
Throw in other variables, like getting insta downed from full health, getting grabbed, getting hit to quickly and activating it early game, or not getting hit at all and then end game comes and you die on first hook, etc.
---
The previous thread I had here, with a different person.
---
I just find it so odd that this nerf is being worked on so fast due to complaints and not them realizing its apparently too powerful on their own but people complaining about NOED for years is completely fine.
---
Killer dc
---
Fair point.
---
Killer didn’t DC though. I’m playing the with my brother and he was still in the match after I was DCed.
---
All the complaints in this subreddit about MoM being op is pathetic. It takes 3 hits to activate, doesn't work on half the killers abilities, it's a one time use, and reveals your location if you escape the killers terror radius. It was a useful but situational perk that survivors finally had. This nerf will make it even more useless then decisive strike.
---
Mostly survivor but when I do play killer it's usually hag, Myers, or the wraith
---
Because Spirit gets first hits easier, and the extra time spent healing more than makes up for the time lost phasing across and around the map or mindgaming at stale pallets. It also makes tracking easier, because unless they're running No Mither and Iron Will, you're going to find the massive blood trail, Father's Glasses phasing or even walking around.
---
They did say why Freddy's rework took so long though. They said it was because of the scope of the rework and how much they wanted to change exceeded what they were used to.
---
I hope they change it up and make sleeping a progress as it was in the movie,  and that there are spawned medicine cabinets, similar to the pig and plague, and they have to use the medicine to keep from falling asleep, and there’s a balance between how much medicine they can take, or how long it lasts, and the sleepier you get the more powerful Freddy becomes. They could keep the dream world that’s in the game, but I feel like this would much better represent Freddy as he was in the movies, slowly becoming more powerful as time goes on, and this would also work with his base perks.
---
No keep it as it because an adrenaline shot would do both.
---
That’s how people felt with Laurie’s because of DS.   It’s unfortunate
---
Easiest way to get WGLF stacks too it’s fantastic.
---
Neither is mettle. Just a guarantee chase extender.
---
The dbd subreddit has the worst fucking memes
---
Ngl I wanted Ash for Flip Flop, I need Tenacity if I wanna try and make it work at least
---
Not even. I've gotten slugged and left more than I've been able to use it
---
Respectable myers is pretty clutch for warden, i mostly use clown bubba and legion
---
Can this joke die already?
---
I'm a main killer and this nerf isn't satisfying at all (and my favorite killer is wraith so I do really get fucked by MoM). We can have a nerf that doesn't  automatically destroy the perk and from past experience unless we actively voice our complaints constantly it won't matter at all.
---
Freddy has the average killer lunge range. It's just that his weapon hitbox is a little longer than his visual claws, to be able to match the average killer lunge range.
---
Cool kids on the playground be like:
---
And ? How BBQ stops me from looping the f*ck out of killer ? Lockers exist and Distortion exist, use them if you are not good at looping.
---
In that case it would be a great change (would it also buff WGLF?) but without changes to protection the perk would be dead, the effect should be hard to obtain not almost impossible.
---
Right, I get that the perk is a pain. I play equal amounts of killer and survivor. I used to be scared of only ash and when I saw more than one I would just play as Billy, leather, or my prayer bead spirit (my boo btw) and try to avoid the MOM, but recently I have just accepted dang near everyone runs it on pretty much any character and I just play the game and take the loss with an M1 killer, rather than be a jerk and wait longer for games.
---
I literally can't play rank 1 wraith without seeing this perk extending loops by another 30ish seconds against good players. It's current change coming up will kill it, they said it's a test version, so I'm happy it won't be guttered but not rewarding shit play like it does now
---
She has an addon that does that
---
FUCK THE RANK SYSTEM.
---
According to Google Earth it would only be about an 18 day walk, so yeah I'd assume it's possible.
---
? You were really close to the window because you vaulted and went left, without going away from the window.
---
Looks like MoM is getting thrown in the trash. Now what's the best perk, self-care again? I'm pissed. I was excited about EGC, but as a survivor it's a pain and now MoM being trash is just another blow to the gut.  Looks like I need to main killer to get developer updates that actually benefit me
---
Look at the other comment
---
WE‘D LIKE TO PRETEND, OKAY?!
---
Thank you. I was just asking if you reach level 50 on a character if all 3 perks show up because I was reading a post saying they “skip” certain perks to ensure they don’t get the annoying / bad perks showing up in other blood webs.
---
I know if they kill it they most likely won't change it for months, I rather have it destroyed than letting it be like it is now but I would much rather have them do a proper balance change and not kill it but make it fair.
---
When your ruin and devour hope are gone in the first 10 seconds..... then noed is gone before you can even use it. The hag I vs. Yesterday was not a happy girl in end game chat.
---
Yeah sounds are messed up right now so it feels like everyone has iron will when they don't
---
He started to lag after getting juked really long and everyone of us couldn't move or we ported back to him 
---
I wasn't toxic in the chat just said that it felt like lag switch
---
It will be killed at low level play, but still have value at top level play where survivors know how to use advanced tactics.
---
Good for you for owning up to it. You’ve already made plenty of progress!
---
Doesn't change a think, the weapon clips through the window just visually, it has hit you already look at the health indicator.
---
Not just the men, but the women and children too
---
not trustworthy just like the crappy developers.
---
About two months ago, I had a game as Leatherface on Haddonfield with 2 yellow addons (neither charge time) and perks focused around injuries and slugging.  I think it was Sloppy Butcher, Knockout, Deerstalker, and BBQ.  Against me were either a full SWF team or 3+1 rando, all of whom were running Balanced Landing.  The map had also spawned the two stupid long fences with no openings that made traversing between gens an absolute nightmare.  Not that I actuallt got to patrol my gens, because again, Haddonfield with EVERYONE running Balanced Landing and 3 if not all 4 on comms.  I got 2 hits the entire game.  No downs.  No hooks.  No chance to use chainsaw.  2 hits.
---
I swore off Leatherface for a while after that and I brought out my Amanda’s Letter+Video Tape+Jigsaw Piece next game while running Ruin, Overcharge, Pop Goes the Weasel, and Brutal Strength.  No survivors.  No forgiveness.  No mercy.
---
I play Nurse on PC. She's pretty busted with addons, in my opinion. When you're playing any other killer, you're out to capitalize on survivor mistakes.  When you play Nurse, your results are your personal skill with the blinks. There are some mind games involved, but it's just reading individuals and knowing whether to blink closer, on top of, or further out. If you're playing triple omega blink nurse, that game is tossed out the window. At that point, it's just your skill with where to blink with your third blink being the forgiveness blink. I enjoy playing her, but at some point you're going to 4k every single game no matter what because there is no wasting time against her.
---
This is such a controversial opinion towards a perk that gives a second chance whilst having no counter play. I understand that you personally don't find it frustrating, but the majority of killer players/mains find it annoying as hell to deal with - especially when all four survivors are running it.
---
after watching that video, you really don't think there's an issue with hitboxes in this game? if that's true, there's no hope for you.
---
I agree at red rank those extra 30 secs they buy with that perk makes you have to consider letting them escape thus giving up the pressure added by someone that could have been a hook.
---
How about instead of activated by protection hits, it can only prevent a down with a protection hit. For example, I activate it by getting hit like normal three times, but it will only prevent a down after an unhook or while the killer is carrying a survivor.
---
Oh I know it's controversial because they going to gut the perk, I just wanted to th and make some people aware it wouldn't be a final, done solution
---
But we are also 2 weeks into May, so this isn't really an update. Lol
---
Bruh
---
yeah it really happens often you at least need to finish one of them to avoid three gen strat
---
LOL
---
no it isn't, I've already gone over it extensively on why and how unreliable it is already. Not going to repeat myself again
---
That's not what I said at all... I wanted to tell people that might have thought it was set in stone that it wasn't. The pwek does need a change, but not this bad
---
He's actually not that bad. I just his terror radius huge and constantly throw bottle to bring people out.
---
devs always seem to nerf survivor perks. it's a shame really
---
Thank you everyone, Basically since I’m re-reading my post it does seem confusing. However, I was asking if all three perks end up showing up on the bloodweb eventually. I was reading a post where players skip the reachable perks because they’re bad or not part of their game style so they don’t purchase it in the bloodweb. I was asking for reassurance that eventually all three perks do end up showing up in the bloodweb if you skipped them. I normally buy all teachable perks, I don’t read into them I just know it’d probably be useful later. I’m still new and learning so I’m just doing small research.
---
Yo developers, if you change MoM to this I want my money back for ash and his shitty perks..
---
I mean pretending is ok, but people are saying it like it's an official thing. literally there's only 1 couple that they made official in-game
---
nah i don't really text the only texting i do is discord and thats pretty easy to deal with
---
I never use rare offerings on low ranks because of constant DCs
---
&gt; Thank you sherlock holmes, we wouldn't be able to figure it out without you...
---
There's no reason to be a fucking asshole about it.
---
It's not as hard as you think, just slightly inconvenient at low level play.
---
I mean, that's the benefit of being a 50/50 main.  I see from both angles.  Mettle of Man was the most frustrating shit to deal with as a Killer, and as a Survivor I saw multiple teammates cheat death to body block for me at the gate, or linger around the open doors just to get a second wind and leave, taunting the killer.  It was agitating and not fun, it was bound to get nerfed, I called it the first day it was released, and I was correct.
---
LOL, you're crazy.
---
Thanks for sharing your experience. Maybe I'll give it a try if there's a steam sale. :)
---
Jokes on them. I have played several games where the Ash wasn’t even running MoM and someone else was. Illusion 100
---
Adrenaline needs to be nerfed.
---
Spirit got buffed 3 times after her release, what you talking about ?
---
No it won't because protection is heavily unreliable. Not even with SWF its realiable to get 3 protection hits in a single game...
---
mega nut
---
All it really needs is to be an Exhaustion perk. You can't use Dead Hard, Sprint Burst, Lithe or Balanced landing after MoM (or vice-versa).
---
It's not balanced but they've absolutely destroyed the perk with this. Shit change.
---
Nah its fine.
---
Just use them ... I mean why hold em.
---
Nobody at top level is throwing themselves in to get protection hits.
---
NGL I'm kinda salty about it. It wouldn't be a huge deal if it just happened every once in a while but I feel like it's every single game anymore in my good ping lobbies.
---
There's no reason to be a fucking asshole but you're one. He is poluting the subreddit with useless "discussion".
---
A dude that has a nick name "fuck_you_microsoft" wants to call me an asshole... pathetic.
---
"I am tripping balls though"
---
You must not have played clown enough. He is great at making chases end fast and getting people to go where he wants. His add ons also make him pretty deadly plus he can stop exhaustion perks and slow healing down. He really isn't as bad as you make him seem
---
Exactly and I have thought the same thing, it would be nice to have a focused q&amp;a about console, both PS4 and Xbox, but you know we wouldn’t get any questions we wanted answered or talked about, from the the main q&amp;a post or vids they post, they keep beating around the bush on shit and look totally lost and or scared when doing them.
---
Clearly it's not, if people are making posts about it.
---
You can just @ me next time
---
Feels like the only entertaining non toxic content creator at this point is Farmer John
---
Because it slows down healing and The Spirit isn't one of the killers you shouldn't heal.
---
Nah sure it’s okay. I just wanted to out myself as shipper but I can’t recall an official statement and... tbh I doubt they will ever be official
---
The doctor has one of the worst hit boxes
---
https://imgur.com/a/3iXJExw You getting hit before the weapon clips through something. After getting a hit the weapon will do its animation regardless of hitbox. You posted a shitty quality video so its pretty much distorted but still you're right near the window, you should get hit by that. Next time don't immediately run towards the window's side after vaulting
---
He has those and they do help just as any killers add ons help but they aren’t necessary. I’ve played perkless/addonless freddy at all rank levels and I 4k most of my games. It really is mainly dependent on how you play him. Most people focus on his weaknesses and that’s the end of the story for them, but his strengths more then make up for it.
---
Well people make post about every and any perk. People say nurses is OP or BBQ and chili.
---
Typical survivor "nURsE is OP!!!!1111
---
It was announced today that the gameplay reveal is in two weeks.
---
That doesn't mean Adrenaline doesn't need to be changed.
---
Let's use the David King as the example
---
His perks We're Gonna Live Forever and Dead Hard are good perks, but No Mither isn't a good perk, so if you skip on teaching it, the teachable will always appear in the next level for David. You can ignore one teachable on a character and still get perks for said character, but if you try to ignore two, those two teachables will hog both perk slots.
---
And what I said that even a baby could tell it wasn't set in stone...
---
any news on the rank rewards?
---
Interesting, it did seem pretty dark. I’ll test it out after work, thanks!
---
What are you talking about? 
---
All MoM does is extend a single chase by one hit. This makes that chase last for 3 hits if the survivor is healthy. Nurses Calling reduces every chase after the first one by one hit, completely negating any benefit MoM offers if you play it right. Without that 3-hit chase, MoM offers no benefit to the survivor.
---
I knew something was coming, yet I still jumped a little.
---
solo play it won't be that strong. In a SWF since almost all of them uses voice cons and heal each other. It will still be a relatively strong perk. 
---
Taking that hit to injured is a little scarier now, however looping is still a thing and you can get healed by your teammates. You just can't have all 4 of your party members be tank hero for your team with an insta-heal medkit with no effort at all.
---
You will stop getting new perks at rank 35, when both teachables will constantly appear at the bloodweb. You can still progress the blood web without getting any perks but its not really worth.
---
It doesnt its a one time affect its not that bog of deal. You cant delay it it happens and its over in 15 secs and it heals you one health state. I agree i hate seeing 3 or 4 people pop it, but it doesnt stop me from getting them down again.
---
1,2 Nurse is coming for you
---
Really, it's the issue of the asymmetric design. Any time you create a survivor perk, you have to remind yourself that potentially 4 survivors could be running that one perk. And that's pretty much the issue with MoM. It's not just one free hit, often times, it's four.
---
You're welcome! :)
---
I'm sure it will pop up in the summer sale. I usually see it on sale for 9.99. It's not to steep to buy it and give her a go.
---
I will note, however, dcs seem to be more common than on console.
---
If this even were the case, the killers weapon is so far away that either way its stupid hitboxes.
---
*Cough* Adrenaline, Iron Will, Sprint Burst, Lithe, Quick and Quiet, Prove Thyself, Balanced Landing, Dead Hard *cough*
---
Also applies to when you are sick of being screwed by your teammates so you switch to killer to hopefully punish them later.
---
But phasing around the map isn't a waste of time, it helps The Spirit with map pressure, especially if she has some cooldown add-ons.
---
doesnt matter, if youre hooked when adrenaline activates, then you go to full health when unhooked, plus the speed boost. so adrenaline rewards you more for getting hooked than getting downed.
---
Getting protection hit is not easy and you can't properly farm them... it won't matter if its SWF since you can't realistically constantly get 3 protection hits a game even trying hard to.
---
Fuck those P3 claudettes
---
LOL at people downvoting posts that highlight obvious flaws in the game because it goes against their agenda.
---
If its Ash's I remember who were being dicks, I bring in an Ebony Mori. If not, I won't dodge, I deal with the annoyance. Besides, apparently a change is in the works and I personally think its a lot better. Now players have to take 3 hits protecting a teammate. The next hit putting them in dying state will activate Mettle of Man. Won't matter if its a chainsaw or a hatchet. I love this, now survivors have to actually do something to earn that extra hit.
---
It's a de-sync issue, not a hitbox one
---
I get like 4 per game if I want with WGLF
---
Counter play? They're still usually within your line of sight they're not going anywhere you just need to hit them again so I honestly don't know what you're talking about. 
---
One free hit is nothing, killers getting frustrated by something like that is why the perk works so well not because the perk itself. If someone knows how to utilize their loadout more power to them they paid for their character and put the bloodpoints in etc. It's not their problem if you're frustrated.
---
MoM and DS are/were both one time things and they got changed. Adrenaline being a one time thing does not make it unable to be nerfed.
---
Not a survivor main, so you're dead stop there. Literally only have Feng anywhere near even 50, and Claudette in the twenties.
---
 Otherwise have most killers so far at least at 40, if no 50 or prestige. Nurse is simply broken, and her power shouldn't have ever been *in* a game like this. There's a level of OP I can understand, but when you make a game with all these elements.
---
 And then decide to throw out all that with a character that can teleport? Well hoo boy, there's something wrong with your head. Spirit is a nurse done right.
---
You can whine all you want, you're hugging the window. If you can't see how it is distorted you should go see a doctor.
---
You don't.
---
that's great i like a lot XD
---
Only reveals your location when you fully heal and it works against the Killers who are already weak.
---
MoM alone isn't OP, but it synergises too well with other top-tier Survivor perks.
---
Btw, twice today I escaped matches by just letting the Killer hit me twice while I open a door...
---
Yeah it wouldn't work at all
---
I left 1000 hours behind a while ago, it’s honestly worth it but with these updates waiting is so much easier.
---
It wasn't even situational. Every killer has an M1. Realistically, the only killers that weren't going to proc it are Huntress, Legion, and Plague. Maybe Billy, just a maybe.
---
I sure do, why do you think you know what goes in my game? Just because you play like a rank 20 does not mean everyone else does.
---
Im so excited.
---
Not gonna argue about the MoM change. However i wanna mention how this context reminds me of Super Smash Brawl, and how their meta worked.
---
In Brawl, the character tier was based on how hard it could counter or fight back a single fighter, and that was Meta Knight. It did not matter what kind of recovery they had, or combo mix up in general. Think about it; an entire Meta built around agaisn't a single character because of how much impact his kit had. MoM is similar to this situation in the aspect of how good a killer can do agsisn't it.
---
Low tier Killers were even lower than before because of 1 single perk, and same goes for god tier killers. Basically, this perk turned the killer pick into a Billy / Huntress / Nurse fest. Really makes you think
---
Seriously I’m glad it’s getting nerfed. The amount of times I catch someone who was trying to juke me , just to see them have MoM and dash to the exit gate was so frustrating
---
you're saying a lot but in the end not saying much at all
---
so much so that I don't think you know what you're even trying to say anymore, beside that you're outraged over how I choose to use my time.  but you've also abandoned that platform in favor of attacking me personally, which is quite funny
---
very predictable of you 
---
and it's quite funny that you care about downvotes as well, you know they're just imaginary points, right?
---
I dont know excalty its not done.
---
What are you quoting? That’s not what she says, meg says “But I am tripping balls”
---
Seriously? These devs don't know how to balance shit.
---
From a good perk that's actually worth using MoM is gonna become dead with the change they proposed.
---
Im not hugging the window, I was facing my camera that way so my character turned to the left. I am not even close to the wall in any sort of way.
---
And no the video is not distorted, its just the aspect ratio of my monitor.
---
Honestly for me it’s the fact that they grow, and even though it has ups and downs they push, and constantly try to better hints even if it doesn’t always work out.
---
To be fair i thought old ds was fine. I just ran enduring. MoM is OP and one of the few perks i feel is. Adrenaline isnt bad to the health of the game for it to be nerfed.
---
I don't take it upon myself to memorize every quote from these... I have important things to do.
---
Iri heads are annoying but I agree with your points. The ability to end chase with one hatchet should maybe be balanced a bit more. Tbh I’d rather have exhaustion add ons balanced more then the insta down, but that’s for another day.
---
it's not my fault that I'm able to think pragmatically about how I spend my time
---
apparently being capable of this makes some people very, very angry when they realize they could do this too, but just lack the ability
---
interesting
---
Yet you reply within 10 seconds on Reddit
---
Because I know how protection hits work...but apparently you don't.
---
Yet not everyone saw that.
---
Doesn't matter if it shouldn't be, it is. NOED only used to be an instadown on the 3rd tier, now it's across all of them. I've had games running baby killers around all match/not even seeing them, only to be downed and facecamped. NOED is literally an end of the match punishment to good survivors if the killer gets a lucky hit.
---
Tell me how it works then, cus im pretty sure I know. Since I can get them when I want most of the time..
---
ok cool
---
Yes you are, yes the video is distorted. You're either not recording it properly or you have a 2000's monitor for that kind of distortion.
---
Your opinion isn't everyone's.
---
That still burns more time for their teammates than D/Cing immediately when they go down the first time.
---
Yeah they did.
---
Yes, because as of right now i'm not doing anything, meaning I have some free time to talk to some asshole who got onto me for not remembering a quote from a sub-par animation.
---
Okay no need to get angry
---
I actually went to see that at the royal armoury and I would actually look pretty good on the doctor in my opinion
---
This was my trying to get DS 😭😭😭
---
You sound really arrogant.
---
I am not hugging the wall?? Please take a screenshot and in detail explain to me how I am "hugging the wall"
---
Then why is NOED so easy to get?
---
Thats...actually a pretty good idea. Idk if its perfect or to litle or whatever, but i think this would be a nice change.Maybe it could be all thats needed.
---
no need to be pretentious
---
Play a different killer :0
---
Read what I said, slowly
---
And they left quite a few of their add-ons garbage. I'm punished for hitting survivors twice yet, you still leave add-ons like franks mixtape and stab-wound study the same. And why in the hell was there no change to Fuming mixtape?
---
Yeah keep downvoting me bud that’ll show me not to correct someone
---
what
---
Hold me!
---
Also good.  I just wonder if the matchmaking would be longer in that case.
---
&gt;They're still usually within your line of sight they're not going anywhere you just need to hit them again...
---
This argument can be made towards DS prior to its nerf, and look what happened. 
---
Simply put, second chance perks are frustrating to deal with, and that's why they're addressing it. 
---
&gt;If someone knows how to utilize their loadout more power to them they paid for their character and put the bloodpoints in etc. It's not their problem if you're frustrated.
---
Honestly, this just sounds like you're defending the fact that MoM is an overpowered perk gated behind a paywall, and that you're entitled to having it remain untouched, despite the overwhelming pushback against it.
---
MoM is going to get nerfed, and survivors are going to have to find a better way to survive.
---
Kris are we ok
---
Ya I do like the new change, it will be good for an altruism build with BT, WGLF, and well make it
---
Already did, already explained how and why you hugged the window.
---
Rng can be rough sometimes xD
---
i didn't downvote you, but thanks for the idea
---
Bro you’re being pretentious replying to me
---
F’realllllll. I didn’t get DS before cause it was unbalanced, it got changed and I wanted it. NOW it didn’t want to show
---
Same dude, Freddy is my favorite killer, I can't wait to see the changes
---
too long, didnt read
---
Oh, absolutely. I mean, look at what they did to Thanatophobia. Ideally, any changes they make are perfect and aren't put on the back-burner for months.
---
I laughed out loud at work
---
exactly, clown is all about controlling the chase. Separating survivors to chase one then cut off their routes with estimated throws, leading them right to you. Especially with the End Game Collapse, throwing bottles at each exit gate after closing hatch makes it way easier
---
how is adrenaline a crutch perk? compared to noed and old ds its pretty tame
---
Who knows, cant determine that without some playtesting
---
More like “cant read”
---
No you have not. You said something that was straight up incorrect. That is not explaining.
---
Maybe they're downvoting this post because the issue showcased is not poor hitboxes, as OP is suggesting it is.  
---
It's extremely obvious that the issue here is latency, a.k.a. ping, which is kind of an unsolvable problem in literally all online PvP games, since it's literally impossible to stop latency from existing.  
---
But nah, scratch that, it's all about our "agenda," am I right? Whatever that means.
---
I'm a killer.  When I run Ruin and Haunted Ground, survivors cleanse Ruin first about 50% of the time, which is fucked
---
once again, too long. be more concise please
---
I'm pretty sure the popularity of MoM just exacerbated the killer diversity pool. I don't remember seeing so many Huntresses before MoM because certain maps screw her over too hard. Billy is just the perfect answer to Adrenaline and MoM users.
---
Also, they fixed Nurse's interaction with MoM. Not that it really matters for her.
---
They should release a forest map like this, Red Forest doesn’t feel real enough for me
---
Ok then bye.
---
Can I call the optimization team "Fantastic Five"?

i dont understand what this post is supposed to mean, what is this
---
It's like getting Exodia.  You win once you get every part
---
Don't worry, nobody will use it anymore
---
Nope, also not the moment you got hit. LOL
---
It used to be up for an unlimited amount of time, then two minutes, then made into a counterable hex perk. NOED has been nerfed more than it’s been buffed, chill
---
Dont agree with the MoM changes.
---
I was on 66ms this happends all the time because the hitbox for survivors is dummy thicc
---
sure, it could be latency. But how can you prove that's the case? Are you telling me you've never been downed in a match with low ping when you were outside the scope of the killer's attack range?
---
and please don't act like people on this sub don't have agendas, on BOTH extremes. it's incredibly disingenuous.
---
I'm spookily aroused.
---
Legion was NOT the same thing as MoM. Both are bad design but legion legit broke the game. 
---
MoM needs a slight change but nothing this drastic
---
For me (on PC) 1-99 is green, 100+ is yellow
---
Im sitting here asking you to explain it to me. THEN you say it's like explaining to a brick door before you have even attempted to explain anything? You are pathetic.
---
I see. Thank you. (:
---
Yeah Freddy should get the og Halloween theme since that debuted with him.
---
Of course it's not the moment I got hit. That is not what we are talking about. You bufoon.
---
Edit: You were talking about me hugging the wall, which I clearly from the screenshot am not.
---
I mean i feel the same way about that though? DS was fine the way it was they never got far enough away from me after the stun. I play even sides mostly but I prefer killer so I'm just trying to tell you my POV as someone who also likes to play killer. 
---
I mean I guess so then? I don't own Ash and I only play as Feng and Claudette and only use base game perks, but if someone is willing to use their money that they earned then use their own time to grind bloodpoints for their web and then sit through a bunch of camping killer matches to only get MoM to proc every once in awhile I don't see why that's a problem?
---
Peter Akimoto as new survivor!
---
Except this change, only benefits swf and is another nerf to solo survivor
---
Nope, I'm just done explaining things to you from another thread, you're a door. Maybe if someone else explains it (or says it) you will but I'm pretty sure I'm not good enough to teach doors.
---
Well, 1-99 is green and 100+ is yellow for me, that's why I wrote "up to 100".
---
If the killer know where their NOED totem is it's uncounterable. Been in a game before where I got hooked in the freezer on The Game, with the NOED totem right there. Nobody can do anything to unhook teammates in that situation.
---
You have not explained anything...
---
I also only bought Ash for the perk and it makes me think they planned to nerf it all along since its clearly OP. I'm annoyed they want to nerf it into the ground, taking 3 hits and going and then having to heal is a detriment to the team.
---
"we define oversaturated content as common, old and uninteresting posts that do not add anything of value to the subreddit. examples: salty messages of any kind, screenshots highlighting various iridescent emblems or various disconnects, the **"killer who looks like a survivor" fan concept** etc pp"
---
Meanwhile noed is still the same and can carry noobs to 4k
---
It's easy to track when you're not playing, because there's no pressure on you.
---
Not useless at all. Force an m1 attack while they’re holding a survivor or stay around loops
---
Oh ok bufoon I'll be a little more clear to you. WHEN YOU GOT HIT you were hugging the window.
---
And I'm not going to... already got one useless thread with you, thats more than enough.
---
This is why I usually don’t even bother with the subreddit or look into any changes that are coming. I came only because someone mentioned something about new cosmetics and I wanted to see if anyone had made a post about it. I seen this post and curiosity took over. Personally this Reddit or looking for answers related to anything console from dbd or the community is a waste of time. They only seem to care when you agree with them and act as though every platform has the same issues. I’ll just go back to being a casual player 🤷‍♀️. It doesn’t bother me at all especially since my time of operation seems to leave me with long queue times and dead lobbies. Have a good one.
---
Yeah, sounds AWESOME for killer mains
---
I'm looking down for scratch marks and kicking the gen for Surveillance.
---
Pro tip use no mither with deliverance so the broken status effect doesnt matter when you unhook yourself
---
Should’ve brought small game or a map to cleanse all the totems then lol. Noed can’t proc if you’re proactive :))))
---
Big oof.
---
It’s always Michael instead of billy for me, and it’s annoying because they always bring add ons that let them tier up in nanoseconds
---
When they're wobbling on and off the screen, it's hard to keep and eye on them.
---
Sad ppl paid for that and now it’s being taken away lmao
---
Why is this upvoted?
---
I tried to do a no mither meme build for like 5 rounds. 
---
I got a three blink nurse, iri hatchet huntress (although didn’t affect me looool), and got mori’d by a wraith. 
---
It goes both ways
---
I’m ??? at them saying inaccurate hitboxes are due to desync and input lag but then saying they’ll be changing the animation to fit these hits so they don’t look so inaccurate??? 
---
Which to me sounds like they’re not actually adjusting the hitboxes which are too big in certain cases and not due to lag like the chainsaw for example but will give killers (or survivors) adjusted animations to make them appear to hit?
---
Has over 4,000 auric cells...
---
[Is this me hugging the wall then? No.](https://imgur.com/a/18iQaWO)
---
[THIS is what hugging a wall is.](https://imgur.com/a/f9NBnxM)
---
And what would overcharge achieve? The skillcheck is piss-easy.
---
XDD psssst
---
Looks like normal high-ish latency hit to me. 
---
If weren't for your shitty editing at the end trying to be edgy, you could actually see that your character goes back a few meters. 
---
For the killer, he hit you fair and square. You can also see that the ending of his animation is correctly facing your direction. At first it looks like he was hitting in a total different direction but that's because it takes a few miliseconds to register the animation change in your end due to latency.
---
I honestly feel sorry for DBD devs that need to put up with stupid people complaining about something that they don't understand. 
---
Watching a streamer the other day, that person was purposely playing against a killer with 300ms just for fun and obviously, with such a high ping BS hits are common. People in chat couldn't tell the difference and spammed "LoL hItBoXeS" at every hit. 
---
Get a grip.
---
MOM was the new decisive, glad they took action so quickly this time! Devs really stepping it up
---
You going on my post and not knowing what you are talking about and explaining to someone who is not listening  is not the same thing.
---
With low ping? No, I don't recall that ever happening to me.  
---
With high ping, though? I don't even bother with baiting pallets if the latency is above 150 ms.  
---
I'm not saying bad hitboxes aren't a thing, because I mean, Huntress' hatchets, but this video is not showcasing bad hitboxes. It's showcasing bad ping, which I know, because I have seen this kind of thing before, and I have pair of eyes, as well as an at least somewhat functional brain.
---
I give up, you posted another screenshot that has nothing to do with anything... LOL
---
Small game is a waste of a perk slot if there's no NOED to start with, and requires you to waste time running around the map trying to find dull totems when you should be spending the time doing gems. Even at red ranks people don't do that.
---
And nobody uses a map as a solo surv anyway lol. It's just a crutch perk for bad killers, survivors shouldn't have to spend half their game worrying about it.
---
Most people hate this head cosmetic thing and me and my friend where a shitty head well yeah x'D I dunno
---
Can confirm, had a game go about 20 to 25 minutes when I played as Legion constantly applying pressure and applying hit and run tactics instead of chasing. Ended with 3 kills anyway. I had fun, and the survivors seemes to be in good spirits in the end game chat so it ended well. But thats not everyones cup of tea.
---
Leatherface is weaker. Freddy is very strong if played right. People thing he’s weak because if you play him as you would any other killer then he is, but done right he’s incredible
---
“It can very easily make the difference between an escape and a death”... you think this but NOED is fine? NOED can change a game from a 0K to a 4K in a minute. If you’re going after OP perks you have to be fair and go after both sides. You can say NOED is counterable, but it’s really not counterable to anyone but SWF until a totem counter is added. You want to make Mettle of Man a perk that rewards good behavior, protective hits, right? Okay so be it, but then why does NOED reward bad playing. I just don’t get it, it’s like you devs only read this subreddit and don’t actually play the game.
---
&gt;I was on 66ms this happends all the time because the hitbox for survivors is dummy thicc
---
Anything above 20ms ~ 30ms (at the very best) can generate situations like this.

This screenshot is the frame before I get hit. In the next frame I have taken the hit and im down. How is this screenshot not relevant?
---
I cannot fucking believe this right now dude. You're telling me you are going to nerf Mettle? The only resemblence of a survivor crutch perk which is far from the next decisive strike? What a joke. But don't worry guys, NOED will still be around and kicking because these developers are killer main shills who just don't understand their game.
---
"Work for the perk" Haha what a joke why would I want to work for a perk that is suppose to be actively helping me while I'm suppose to do the real objective? Do you understand how hard it is to get THREE protection hits? Considering how inconsistent they are? 
---
I'm honestly convinced that they just made this perk for the sake of selling Ash, so scummy.
---
I legit just got scammed, so I won't bother spending money on characters with seemingly busted perks since I fucking know from now on that it is bait, as it is just going to get next the following couple of weeks.
---
Bunch of scammers.
---
That’s assuming you get chased and never ever escape even once? Pretty unlikely at all ranks
---
I somewhat agree to this because the low tier killers get the short end of the stick for MoM...

Can confirm, age of consent IS 15 where I live. I'm not sure about the details though... I've heard people claim that as long as there's consent, it's legal no matter the age gap, but I'm not sure if that's true.
---
What I AM sure of is that it's still, hum, "socially questionable" .
---
OMG A DRAG QUEEN SURVIVOR WOULD BE LIFE
---
Please give me the frame in which you got hit. I don't care frames before that bafoon. Also I'm not sure you understand that but you are 1 palm away from the window. Even a kid would reach you.
---
Bond is one of the strongest, most versatile perks in the entire game. Definitely run it over Botany Knowledge.
---
Yep, and this doesn't help either: Devs actually believe in the "cleanse totems" meme
---
At this point I'm not surprised why killers are just getting an advantage now.
---
Niggaface is the best killer in thr game
---
Am I not the only one on console getting a Myers every two matches?
---
I've been having this issue too. I thought it was because of rank reset, but I was being disconnected randomly from the killer and there wasn't an indication that the killer DCd. I would always randomly get disconnected after 3 gens were completed.
---
think they thought they were far enough to not get hooked by the killer.
---
Lowkey tho if you’re running in a chase and desperate and have bond and see someone who could distract the killer...
---
“Accidents” happen
---
Yes but are you going to escape every single time to heal too? Pretty unlikely. It's even out especially for the face you won't get use against billys which is the second most popular killer at all ranks
---
Freddy’s ability only punishes him if you treat it as a normal ability. I look at it as a sort of “opposite” ability. Really one of the main parts of his ability is his invisibility which instead of activating you are turning off. It almost always grants the first hit or at the least a wasted pallet. The second hit comes easily when you ambush the survivor when they don’t expect it using the other part of his ability, the tracking.
---
First perk I've ever heard of that I have to "work for". Because perks are apparently the new objective? What a joke.
---
Me too! When 3-4 gens are completed I’m DCed and I know for sure it’s not thenkiller because my brother is playing with me and he’s still I. The match.
---
Not going into detail?
---
It used to shorten the pallet recovery time to 1.14s. Now it's actually buffed up to 1s. However it has no effect on any other type of stuns.
---
Enduring nerfed, DS buffed
---
lol
---
Lol just go play deceit then, its free
---
NOED killers rejoice as their only crutch has yet to be nerfed.
---
Object of obsession stack with distortion?
---
The ones seen here are primarily from here: https://twitter.com/faery__/status/1119001232356642818
---
Just bringing up the point the hitbox is unfair and big and your going wah wah defending your fave game
---
Fucking horny queer.
---
I mean BBQ showed up 3 bloodwebs into my Billy after I unlocked it, but 20 bloodwebs into my meg still no balanced landing. So best of luck it's all random
---
Why is the trapper bhvr? Now i'm just picturing him working at the office
---
every perk has 3 tiers. most purple perks are just the 3rd tier of perks.
---
naa, freddy is shit, 7 seconds to sleep someone and then being a m1 killer, good loopers can defeat him so easy
---
Focus on one character that's how you get the higher level perks
---
Right? I was getting so annoyed because I kept getting DCed every other match or so and it’s making it impossible to rank up.
---
To highlight stupidity such as yours, asshole.
---
I even consider whether it would be viable to stack it with open handed.
---
Survivors have a smooth experience, killers still suffer from bad frames. Not horrible, but manageable.
---
Leatherface did indeed get a spotlight. Bill also received one as well.
---
&gt;Salt?
---
Yes I am salty. I am tired of seeing people complaining about hitboxes considering 9 out of 10 times they encountered a latency related situation. 
---
People have no idea what they are talking about and just jump in the bandwagon of other people complaining. 
---
Like I said, I feel sorry for the devs.
---
Waaaah please don’t criticise my favourite game :(((
---
Sometimes it’s on purpose, as well as dropping the pallet in front of another survivor
---
All of these insanely great changes for the game and people are getting hung up over a friggin perk getting looked at.
---
Yes, I think this a great way to change it!
---
I cant get it to work.
---
I'm pretty sure he was joking lmao
---
Whatever man. This is real life.
---
Even then my model is not even close to touching the wall.
---
Honestly this is the problem with 60% of the perks in this game. "I'd use this if I had more than 4 perk slots." Add in the fact that (for Survivor) two slots are basically reserved for Self Care and an Exhaustion perk and you have the reason why so many perks aren't used in this game.
---
they're buffing head on. hell yeah
---
Figures, it is Hillbilly
---
Unnerving presence also counter DS, by making it harder for them to hit their skill check.
---
What’s the lesion?
---
I'd rather take the extra .14 seconds from a pallet than a full 5 seconds of DS with Enduring.
---
Bright side, I now have an open perkslot on half my loadouts.
---
The problem is latency for the most part. Try to account for that when using it.
---
Botany is honestly a really good perk that people should use more. It can really speed up the game. Leader is also good because it basically gives all your allies Botany Knowledge while also being useable to cleanse totems and open exit gates.
---
Ds should be a 30 second stun. Fuck tunneling killers
---
LOL dude wtf are you trying to get here? You literally was caught lying your ass off and thats your response?
---
“you just yee’d your last haw, Kate”
---
Never saw this comment sorry but no it’s not a macro it’s on a controller actually
---
Well the thing is I cant let multiple survivors keep escaping, plus I dont know if they have i tor not
---
&gt;Unnerving presence also counter DS, by making it harder for them to hit their skill check.
---
Making it harder is not a counter. It is still up to that survivor to screw up.  
---
I have a recorded video from back in the day, playing DOCTOR with UP and still got hit by 3 DS in the same match. 1 Obsession and 2 Wiggle. 
---
Leaving on the ground until DS deactivates is a counter because the killer is in control.
---
You'd be suprised
---
No not really. If you are playing the loopers game then yes but that’s not how to play Freddy. I play perkless/no add on Freddy all the time and I 4k most of the time
---
It's a reference to the show Ash vs Evil Dead.
---
LOL at people editing videos and getting pictures that distort the reality just to further their "agenda".
---
\^\^\^
---
I saw 5 different posts of this exact image on the front page. I'm just reposting it for my free Reddit Karma.
---
I got her to 50 ... my main addons are still the charge ones because it makes it usable.
---
Discordance is amazing, yes, but that's about it on Legion's truly useful perks. Iron Maiden has some uses on Huntress and mild uses on Doctor, but that's about it. Plague has a variety of fun and strong perks that are all very good. Corrupt Intervention is almost better than Ruin on killers that can find survivors very easily, and works amazingly well with Discordance too. Infectuous Fright is so underrated is unbelivable, it's a surefire way to tell if you are about to get flashlight saved, to catch off unprepared survivors that are healing / mending / snapping out of it / doing gens / doing jigsaw boxes. It's all extra info for something you already do, and it's amazing for slugging builds. Dark Devotion is odd, because it works amazingly on certain killers, but it works against what other killers want to do. It's more on the janky side, but it's not terrible.
---
Im trying to get you to realize that this should not have hit. I was wrong about the frame thing, sorry? What are you trying to get at? You are not even trying to talk about the fact that was a bullshit hit anymore.
---
Thank you! one more question, when did the developers last update this game? matchmaking system really could use some improvement.
---
I’m aware that Paintbrush makes him slower.  Just saying in general when compared to other killers he is on the slower side. And I honestly don’t agree about lunge. Spent some time testing it with friends and at the least his lunge is very inconsistent, so hard to tell.
---
Don’t need to learn him. I main him. I get 4k’s easily, and nearly always double pip. I’m good. Thanks though.
---
so spirit fury and enduring is still a free hit 
---
thats fine then
---
Bubba gets looped pretty hard and his power becomes more of a pallet destroyer instead of actually hitting survivors.
---
It's 15 here too but that doesn't make it less disgusting. Laws don't always fit morals.
---
I just started playing survivor in the last few months and I think I've only gone against 1 or 2 leather faces that didn't camp.
---
I feel bad when people like you lack self awareness :/
---
Indeed.
---
every 6 weeks there's a patch. they're awary of the matchmaking issue and working on it.
---
Not sure if that change will matter really, or how it will function in terms of getting the hits, and how much it's bypassed currently at least.
---
That's an exaggeration. I can already tell you what the build for it is going to be right now:
---
Clutch Save Loadout. Mettle of Man, Borrowed Time, Deliverance, Adrenaline (this one is interchangeable).
---
I have two issues: 1) Wraith is too high up(I play Wraith the most) and 2) Freddy should be in SS tier too. Other than that, it's a perfect tierlist.
---
They got the 1% when you let them go.
---
I thought about that, but then the rest of your build gets kind of limited. You're better off with Aftercare or Empathy if you want long-range auras.
---
With all system's dbd has used it has always been potato ranks till 1 where you have a more balanced mix of potatos and non potatos. But you're a special kind of potato, you're asking for a killer nerf (that btw is one of the most balanced killers in the game) because you're playing at purple ranks and intentionally deranking so you think it should be harder?
---
getting 4k's as a killer wiotuht perks on low ranks doesnt mean the killer is good, freddy doesnt have map control, literally he is trapper withouth traps, his walhack is not that great because they wake up so fast.
---
It'll be even better in that situation although slightly.
---
From 1.14 to 1 second
---
You'll get that recovery hit a bit easier.
---
Tracking with the power was made better not worse. The duration increased the distance you can move with the power pre nerf by a lot
---
Also bigger radius means more tracking range.
---
If you look at Feng’s face you can see that she has become a soulless shell of her former self.
---
Keep in mind that landing the first hit doesn't mean the survivor is also downed. Even injured you can still loop both of them. Also I am 100% sure that what you mean by &lt;&lt;take mechanical skill&gt;&gt; is that you can fuck with them and waste their time so the others can do gens. If people like playing Legion or Plague let them, you can't have everything your way.
---
Yea, it does sound fun, but there is a difference between fun, and good. Not saying meta perks cant be fun, but I still say survivors have not gotten a good perk in over a year
---
Sorry I'm not following what you mean? I don't talk allot I mostly talk when someone in chat asks a question or something interesting happens
---
Are you serious? He is so much better now.
---
Corrupt Intervention is absolutely meta on Hag and Trapper. It's just negligible on any killers that appeal to the standard constant aggression playstyle (Which is the same reason BBQ and Chili is strong on so many killers).
---
Hahahahhahhah omg that sucks XD That was funny though.
---
How so? I haven’t gotten to watch this yet
---
dude at the time it takes for a killer to find a new lobby, if they are THAT desperate then I dont think theres too much to complain about here. It will take you 30 seconds to get into another lobby, it will take him 5+ minutes
---
There's going to be a PTB, so it's a Chapter!
---
Luck is not always on your side in this game lol XD
---
Hard to activate? Vs who? Plague or Legion?
---
Maaan the other day I had in survivor message me with a bunch of salt and I basically told him to fuck off. A few hours later I get a message from PSN because he reported me for abuse in messenger. He messaged me first! So I went and reported him too for sending abusive messages and got a message from PSN telling me not to abuse the report system. Honestly you should just make your settings to where they can't even message you. It's crazy that they can get your PSN account banned because they're salty about losing.
---
And T-bagging assholes should be auto sacrificed to entity.
---
Jesus is supposed to die for the survivors' sins
---
Could be neat if (Besides many other reworks and changes) once gens are done, Freddy enters the "awake world" like in the movies.
---
It doesnt work against Billy and Huntress and its effect is neglible on Nurse, Spirit and Hag. All it does is make trash killers worse. I see no reason to run MoM because you dont need it against the killers it procs against and then against actual good killers with a strong power its a wasted slot of a perk.
---
Given that there is nothing about her in the release, there probably is no survivor. Lines up with LF/bill to.
---
try again but without moving this time. guarantee this doesnt happen.
---
Ok, so a quick question then.
---
If you met a girl who looked 20, body and everything, yet was 15, and another girl, who looked 15 yet was 20, who would you date?
---
Why would it be a paragraph? It may be but what indicates to us its one or the other?
---
if anything it has increased
---
As someone who vehemently plays nurse: No u
---
thats great!
---
No, shit killers do that
---
That sounds like a great way to get 0k at red ranks.
---
Never said I wasn't
---
Thought it was filled with weird homosexuals
---
I said it wasn't bad. Deliberately said it isn't really necessarily good. But it absolutely has application. 
---
"Good" perks are what create the stagnant meta this game falls into over and over.
---
We've not seen re-worked Freddy, so there are clearly multiple dev builds.
---
Iirc, the Ghostface gameplay had some text at the to saying something along the lines of
---
"Internal/Developer_Build_Oman_3.0.0"
---
So it was more specifically the Killer team's dev build.
---
AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS
---
Michael, Pig and especially Plague have direct counters to MoM.
---
Only three killers don't have a counter. Wraith, Freddy and Nurse
---
Huntress, Billy, Leatherface, Myers, Plague, and Legion never proc MoM if they have anything resembling brain cells. Trapper and Pig can also counter it with their power if they play smart. The other killers can counter it with perks like Make Your Choice, Noed, Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Rancor, etc.
---
I do try to make other survivors survive but when they aren't capable to survive what can I do? :(
---
Exactly
---
100% yes
---
The best healing perk is Dead Hard and not healing yourself.
---
As a Legion main, Im going to tell you now. Never ever say that a bigger radius is better. Closing the distance between grouped up survivors was Legions bread and butter, and notifying them earlier sevrely nerfed the work his power put in. You didnt NEED bigger tracking range, theres a reason M&amp;A was meta(it let you close the distance to begin with), and Distressing was dumpstered.
---
Oh and duration being increased doesnt matter when your speed is dropped. No, the difference was negligible, unless you consider add-ons. 
---
Tl;dr Tracking range over actually applying the ability efficiently is not a buff, dont act like it is.
---
That's latency, not the hitbox
---
So this is how a meme is born
---
To everyone asking how they were being toxic: 
---
- All 4 survivors were definitely SWF.
---
- Not a single survivor even touched a generator, cleansed a totem, etc. None of them had any intentions of playing a regular match.
---
- They all T-bagged to start a chase and then led me to that corner.
---
- Their objective was clearly to prevent me from hooking them to get me to DC.
---
If they nerf MoM like that you bet your ass I'm getting a refund.
---
Because Spirit's hit uses a regular M1, while Ambush is a different kind of attack.
---
JESUS UFKC
---
I threw up in my mouth when he did that. It was very unpleasant.
---
Every killer except Freddy, Wraith, and Nurse don't count towards MoM. 
---
Literally test out the others.
---
Due note: Clown has to have the instant down add on I believe
---
THEN THEY ARE JERKS THAT SHOULDVE HELPED! I WOULD HAVE HELPED! MATCHING SWEATERS UNITE
---
after reflecting upon it for a bit, i probably shouldn't have gotten involved. there's just too many variables involved to say with confidence. 
---
anyway, cheers!
---
MoM is 100% situational. It does literally nothing against half the killers and only procs against the other half if you have a good team and the killer isn't running perks to counter it.
---
They can make him able to crate illusions of the survivors randomly appear arround the map so swf are not so op against him but not very viable
---
have you guys thought about just taking away the speedboost from the mom hit? instead of reworking how to build up the perk entirely. 
---
maybe a smaller change would be better so the people that bought the DLC aren't already regretting it.
---
Sure. But we have evidence of Freddy’s rework so it’s safe to say it’ll be coming. I’m arguing against people who say we’re “probably” getting a new survivor and map based on behavior calling ghost face a chapter instead of paragraph.
---
*u got head oned!*
---
Well We got no files or nothing about a survivor. Also Everytime we get a chapter we get a cosmetic for the survivor if we purchased it with money but they switched it and gave the killer the cosmetic and not the survivor this time. Honestly this goes both ways, there is alot of evidence for both but in my opinion we are getting a paragraph.
---
Thank you, devs! These updates are really cool and I love learning about the process you have when it comes to these changes. It's really great to see exactly how things are going. We appreciate the transparency!
---
They moan the loudest
---
How is your FoV so wide without Shadowborn?
---
I play stretched :)
---
... hook twice means to have one person die from two hooks
---
Also, I was unable to hook these two survivors for 10 minutes before I started recording. Still have no idea how I was able to hook Nea after trying so many times.
---
I feel like Doctor and Trapper have the most ridiculous hit boxes. I'll 360 them and be basically on their back and I'll still go down.
---
It's unreliable if you aren't good enough to use it reliably.
---
KILL HER!!!
---
If you are injured...INSTADOWNS ARE STILL COUNTERED. I'm serious. I don't mean it in an ironic No Mither kind of way, but if your MoM is active, and you are injured, and I hit you with NOED, a chainsaw, EW3 Myers, etc. you'll still flash white and not go down.
---
Self care is not a good perk to begin with.
---
Lol. This is on console. Good luck getting anything under 100 most games.
---
Not really. Most people have already used it before getting hit the second time since they'd rather use their cool down perk than their once per game perk.
---
When are you finally going to work on aspect ratio support for 21:9 and other ones? Also anything from graphics settings in menu finally?
---
Man you stole my idea. I was gonna like comment: You forgot the 4th panel where borrowed time reveals itself to be we're gonna live forever and kicks "Me" back into the facecamp tunnel and mori
---
I'm just curious since I have no knowledge of Ghostface whatsoever... I though it may be because there wouldn't be any survivor worth adding.
---
Anyway I'm not sure, we do have more survivors than killers in the game and we just had Ash. Maybe thats why but still without some announcement its possible they just didn't leak it for some weird reason.
---
is "neither" not an acceptable option? wtf is wrong with you
---
2 hooking every survivor means you suck?
---
This is getting old
---
Worth noting that with this change, we can also revisit stun times for perks like decisive strike and make them more reasonable. To give an example: Current decisive strike is 5 seconds. With current enduring, that stun is reduced to \~2.85 seconds. This is largely due to the way enduring reduces stun times. If you had a 4 second stun, you would only have 2.28 seconds to run (and you're locked into the wiggle animation for the first second of that). Since that stun time would be too short, we need to increase the stun times to accommodate enduring.
---
The simpler version is that with this change, we'll be able to better balance perks that cause stuns.
---
Uh oh Kate blew up another gen
---
wait how did they stomp it down exactly?
---
You forgot “DC if first one to be downed.  Or if on death hook.  Or if it’s a Doctor.  Or if-”
---
It may not require 3 stacks since stacks are harder to get. Wait until we at least see the changes.
---
Got gliders on your feet.
---
and if you are fully healed, instadowns will down you. I consider it a fair back and forth, you risk having 3 health states after meeting the requirement, to just get NOED downed instantly instead, or any other exposed perks, and if you're injured then they cancel each other out to you just having the standard 2 hits in said encounter.
---
From my experience thats always been Jake Park.
---
Was this said in the dev stream?  If so, that seems to me to be more than them accidently calling it a chapter once, like Ash.
---
I've never heard it called that. Maw is the same amount of letters.
---
yee haw
---
It's just a really odd leak we got. Alot of stuff hints at ghost face being a paragraph but some supports us getting a survivor. The paragraph side does have alot more evidence though plus someone got the dev build and managed to dig through the files and we only got Ghostfaces animations no files about a map or anything.
---
If you are truly comparing Deceit to Betrayal then you clearly haven't played Betrayal and all you took away from the post is "theres a traitor"
---
They're a part of the game, though.  What's wrong with using game mechanics?
---
level 30!! just for purple shit. this game is a grind and im into it and im not even good yet
---
Sub-par animation? It’s really good
---
yea if you're not good enough to get hit at all then you suck. Or if the killer is to busy tunneling someone else, or if the killer tunnels you and only allows you to activate it right before your death hook at best.
---
Silly me for being avoided all match by the killer
---
Yeah 
---
Almost like people actually want it
---
Just a thought tho
---
The nurse came from directly above (pause when she teleports in and look at the path line).
---
Spine chill probably only does calculations in 2 dimensions so it won't light up if she is looking down at you if you are outside of the projected 2d spine chill path. There is also probably a minimum distance it works in those same 2 dimensions.
---
ok one more question. everyone keeps telling me i need to use lunge. i dont know what lunge is. please help me. i know its for killers but how do i get it
---
I play solo survivor and cleanse 5 totems nearly every game. It's really not that hard.
---
Wait David’s gay?
---
NO ONE:  
---
LITERALLY NO ONE:  
---
DEVS: NERF ENDURING!
---
tbh id probably use this
---
reworked? you mean nerfed
---
Reworked
---
The fact that the new Devloper’s update tried to play them off as “just a desync issue that makes it LOOK like it shouldn’t hit,” pissed me off. This isn’t just a lag issue. It’s clear as fucking day when I get hit around TWO CORNERS and THROUGH a solid wall. (Technically two walls) 
---
Not to mention when the pallet hits the killer, stubs them, and THEN you go down.
---
Lol
---
that’s because noed realistically has a counter (though a totem counter would be wonderful behaviour), whereas for most killers, MoM doesn’t have a counter.  It doesn’t mean it’s the best perk, but it just means that you can’t exactly play around it
---
Not snarky at all, you're right, I misunderstood their wording. Thanks for pointing out.
---
Been on this sub a while and still don’t know what P3 means
---
Did the window close too?
---
Not gonna lie it looks like you are running from a losing argument. :|
---
Dev notes state they are aware of the rampant dc'ing  and once dedicated servers are online they will have the tools to better track and punish players who dc.
---
Really tired of them releasing strong perks to bait purchases and then nerfing them. It's predatory development. I get that MoM is frustrating and I'm not opposed to balance changes but this is 100% something they knew they were going to have to do and they released it as it is anyway to push sales. Them pretending like they were "giving it a chance" is bullshit; they were absolutely always going to change the perk to something weaker. If this change goes through, they'd better improve "protection" hit registration, as it's currently extremely inconsistent.
---
On console, games below 90 ping literally do not exist. And if you find someone below 120 you stay there and hope to god they don’t dc. I guess just fuck console players.
---
Spirit Fury requires enduring to be useful. It's a 2 perk investment.
---
Why are they booing you, you’re right
---
Really, only gens and lockers? So no sabotage, cleansing, jigsaw box etc. grabs?
---
And survivors can generally tell if someone has it by playstyle and will just cleanse totems.
---
Neither means you're a closed minded fuck, usually
---
What is tunneling?
---
I hate face camping the most.
---
I have and I enjoy it. But I don't think it is similar to Betrayal or DBD and I like those games better.
---
That’s a funny argument considering the fact that the devs just said they nerfed MOM because it ”rewards players for doing nothing.” so apparently you need to earn you perk, how does NOED factor in here? 
---
You’re not playing without a perk unless they get all the totems. It will activate end game. It’s not like it cripples killers like you’re trying to imply. It rewards bad choices. You do nothing to earn those kills at the end. All you have to do is hope your totem is still up.
---
He’s the one killer who’s power actively works against him.
---
That dev update was bullshit. People like Noob3 have been making light of this god awful hit boxes for MONTHS. People with damn good connections even get affected by it. Even in dedicated servers it happens. Hitboxes are fucked. To say otherwise makes you blind or ignorant.
---
Lol that would be fun to see! The shortest survivor for sure.
---
&gt;Spine Chill applies regardless of line of sight, or elevation 
---
I read this as "it ignores elevation" just as it "ignores line of sight". So if they are looking in your direction, it will light up regardless of elevation. But it is only using the facing direction, not the camera direction. Thus, while looking down, she can see an aura that is technically behind her.
---
I didn't downvote anything, and I have no idea what you're talking about. Please tell me how I'm being a hypocrite as well.
---
Damn😂😂😂😂 that’s funnier than the meme😂😂😂
---
Buff to pallet stuns, Buff to DS, both teams are better off.
---
I don’t. My good memes get thousands of likes but this only has under a hundred
---
I miss this man, he’s never on stream anymore 😭
---
The issue with that is high windows, where there's literally NOTHING you can do about those types of hits. You can be all the way through, falling down, and you still get hit without you being able to do anything about it which is total BS. They need to make it so that survivors can't get hit once all the way through or make them land further from the window.
---
So... Camp on the second hook?
---
Thanks i really I realize this is a common thing now.  Its just my first time getting hate mail.  I even had an entire group kill themselves for me in one of my first games ever just to be nice.
---
As someone who doesn't play only Billy/Nurse:
---
Good fucking riddance, now I can play a Killer that isn't either of those two to counter all four survivors having that obnoxious fucking perk.
---
It's always better that something is useless than powerful - because then people use a variety of other things, than just THE thing.
---
Rip MoM, a perk that was already just "meh" since it almost never proc'd against a Billy, and barely extended the chase against Nurses, is now going to be downright worthless. Pretty good job so far.
---
Anyone who needs Omega blink nurse (5 blink), Isn't capable of actually blinking. Because of this, They'll miss most if not all their blinks. This will hinder them a lot because the fatigue time is increased enough for a decent survivor to properly juke. Even if they don't escape, The survivor will get a good measurable distance before the nurse has a chance to recover and charge her blink to the max causing the chase to go on longer than a 2 blink nurse. Even if a skilled nurse player were to use it, They'd be hindering themselves by sacrificing less fatigue or greater blink distance. Extra blink isn't too viable. The first part though, is a matter of interpretation. You still have to capitalize on the survivors mistakes, A good survivor knows that the way to counter nurse is to switch up your movement. Because of this, It becomes a game of "Who can read each other better than the other?" It doesn't matter how well your personal skill is with the nurse, If a survivor has good enough movement strat, They can hold off the nurse for a while. Not to mention, The nurses horrible blinking bugs when trying to blink past some textiles. Regardless of how well you do, Survivors still do have a good chance of escaping considering all the second chance perks, items and the broken generator speed and there have been videos live on stream proving this. Former PC Nurse main.

Thank you! ☺
---
Lmao
---
Yeah but their argument for nerfing it is completely bullshit.  And I’m not saying MOM didn’t warrant a change, it just pisses me off that they’re this quick to change it while being stubborn on other long complained perks, counter or not. 
---
IMO the ”you can counter noed” argument is so old and repetitive &amp; completely disregards the fact that it’s a perk designed to reward bad game play.
---
This also feels extremely personal. Do I know you from somewhere or something?

---
Not gonna lie that's a pretty pathetic response to someone that actually managed to take a step back and admit that they can't be 100% sure of something due to there being too many variables.
---
Thank you so much.  This community is great i just got spooked.
---
Even getting tunneled you still get to use it. Maybe if you did gens instead of crouching around to avoid the killer you'd see more use from the perk.
---
I'm sick of bhvr
---
Really? That's some conspiracy level horseshit lol. Like they needed an OP perk to sell ASH.
---
What is sandbagging?
---
Where do we have 16 perks, I have only ever used 4.  I am missing out on playing 12 other perks.  This is sarcasm if you did not know.
---
If it's like the Wraith, you will be really happy.
---
I had 100 of wraith's yellow clapper add ons, which were useless, but they became silent bell ultra rare, and are now his best addon. 
---
If they are redesigning Freddy completely, then get ready for those black boxes to become some kind of exposed effect or game changer.
---
Hmmm that’s actually not a bad idea
---
They just say that so the game is allowed in other countries. Frank Morrison was about 19 when he committed his first murder, and Julie, Joey, and Susie were all younger than him. Even if Frank was 21, the others would still be teens.
---
you can counter noed.
---
The lack of punishment for DC’s made it okay.
---
lol... what? If there were more powerful perks and less pointless/useless perks you would see a more diverse meta and not run into the same OP perks over and over.
---
You need a little speech bubble there. "Lol gg ez."
---
but unplugging your cord saves the pip?
---
Can you, though? Does NOED give any downside? You cleanse all the totems, you waste a ridiculous amount of time. Take into account finding the totem, getting to the totem, cleanse time, another survivor being chased, and other survivors also looking for the totem. That's a lot. If the totems aren't cleansed, it's an easy snowball. Yeah, great counter.
---
WHY DO I STILL NOT GET BLOODPOINTS FOR DOING GENS
---
I'm deranking cuz whenever I touch the red ranks looking for matches takes longer than the matches themselves. I'm asking for nerfs because I know she's unfun to play against because of the screen snap and the other thing is just a suggestion.
---
I feel like I am the only one who preferred 3 over 4.
---
MoM definitely needed a nerf.
---
What about technician and other hearing range perks being the opposite of what they should be?
---
My pharmacy is louder than a sacrifice.
---
At red ranks that is not a viable strategy especially for solo survivors, unless there is a way know how many totems have been done. An extreme waste of time for a chance that the killer has the perk. I’m just saying they keep going after survivor perks that are OP, but do nothing for OP killer perks. Balance comes from evaluating both sides, not just nerfing survivors over and over.
---
Ah, The good Ol' days.
---
I feel like whenever I 3 gen I sacrifice my double pip bc survivors did too many gens, but it's clearly optimal?
---
yet still the fact that she sucks if someone has urban evasion and is god-like when they don't isn't really something I'd call a good game design
---
Maybe I was exaggerated a bit, but I was just a little upset when I wrote this. But like, I just find it awful that they are already doing something to this perk when they know very well that Mettle of Man was good and that some people bought Ash for the perk (I didn't, but still feel pretty cheesed out). They didn't even give it a chance, or even touch NOED (which is the literal definition of a crutch perk that is way worse than Mettle). Combine that with the fact that the "fix" makes the perks useless it honestly seems like I just wasted time putting bloodpoints into Ash.
---
Wait you can prestige? I’m lvl 50 David rn and didn’t know that lmao. Is there anything unique for him?
---
Its worthless if they change it that way
---
It’s not a nerf it’s a earn it perk. Like lullaby and devour hope
---
How is no mither op?
---
How about you remember that games go too quick even with Ruin it you get high enough in rank (Clearly you don't). MoM needed a nerf to help Killers, ESPECIALLY the M1 ones (I hate that this includes The Nurse btw). 
---
If you *really* want to talk Balance, get high enough as a Killer (Not Nurse or Billy) and see how it goes, you'll be fucked.
---
How does she suck? Also I thought you wanted a challenge so why is it a big deal to begin with than?
---
the downside of running noed is PLAYING WITH 3 PERKS THE ENTIRE GAME. you also shouldn't LOOK FOR totems, you should look at the totem spot of every tile you happen to cross and cleanse that. every tile has ONE place where a totem might spawn so it's not really that hard
---
MoM doesn't punish campers, it punish all M1 killers. In fact, in order to counter MoM, you should've camp to death your obsession, so the perk never activates, so this perk just encorages face camping. 
---
And NOED was nerfed 2 times in the past, LUL.
---
You'll have to excuse me as I play the world's smallest violin for everyone who uses MoM. The amount of people whinging their beloved crutch perk was kicked out from under them just proves how widespread it was used. People complaining about its nerf while claiming "but I totally don't use it because it's not that good" aren't fooling anyone. 
---
In all seriousness though, this needed to happen. It didn't effect every Killer, but the Killers it did effect were already very weak, and MoM was just too powerful against them to the point that you couldn't risk playing them over more capable Killers. 
---
Ideally, BHVR would instead buff these weak Killers so MoM isn't as problematic, but that isn't realistic. It's taken two years for a Freddy rework, they're going to take the shortcut 100% of the time. That said, with MoM being marginalised, at least now petiole can safely play the weaker Killers again.
---
I was getting so sick of Spirit/Billy/Nurse just to avoid another four man of MoM users.
---
In that case it'd just be a better Dead hard.
---
You can't miss it/mistime as you can with Dead hard, it will always let you ignore a hit, it will give you more distance than DH would thanks to the speed boost and you cannot bait it/wait it out like you can with Dead hard.
---
My fav. idea to nerf it is to make it so it doesn't give a speed boost, just the weapon whiping animation.
---
Well, if they'll block swf from joining this killer's lobby and They'll make it impossible to change killer in lobby... maybe that'll work. Smh
---
Except wasting two perk slots to able to heal yourself slightly faster is selfish.
---
They might. Maybe not exactly like that, but something as large of a change. 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57097/developer-update-april-2019
---
It was described as a "Full gameplay overhaul" and "The rework is something more complex than anything we've ever done before for any killer" opposed to "Changing or improving existing concepts" implying Freddy is more or less being completely rebuilt. Not something like "His Aura reading works in reverse so he only sees awake survivors auras" or "Self-Care no longer wakes you up." but basically making him an entirely different killer.
---
&gt;  You play the victim 
---
Old habits die hard
---
San Jose sharks jersey underneath?
---
I'm at red ranks. Usually don't even see NOED ran. I only cleanse If I have reason to believe the killer has it.
---
Freddy can be better, so they're reworking him.
---
I am high enough, lol. Killers, on average, get about toe kills every round which IS balance(this is backed up by stats the devs have released). Stop complaining because you can't get 4ks every round, I don't. If I get two, it's a tie and I feel good.
---
Now nerf spirit fury pls
---
M l c r
---
I have tried to shorten it
---
Did he say what rank he is? He didnt. So don't assume he's low rank. Just cause you can't play a killer right, doesn't mean every body plays him wrong or that person's low rank.
---
So Jill wasn't her niecphew?
---
I didn't, i'm a fan of the saga, plus he talks, how wouldn't i love it? But im not talking about a real life compensation.
---
I mean, you don’t have to cleanse dulls. Just focus on cleansing it after gens are powered and before opening a gate so end game collapse won’t start. It may not be convenient, but it works. The problem with MoM is that it didn’t only counter tunneling it also ended up punishing people who played fairly. This nerf was necessary.
---
It does nothing against half the killers (the killers who don't need help because they're strong enough) and the half it does affect are *bottom tier killers who already struggle as is, only to get screwed over by this perk*. Killers like Freddy can't afford to waste time dealing with stupid perks like MoM. Especially if more than 1 survivor has it.

Counter perks are useless if the survivor stays injured once MoM is ready. Basically getting hit twice, hooked, then heal. Now they get hit a third time and their next hit is a free Dead Hard that stuns the killer while they wipe their blade.
---
Killers screwed by MoM: Trapper, Wraith, Leatherface (using the chainsaw against competent survivors is actually hard to do), Myers, Doctor, Freddy, Pig.
---
Killers only partially screwed by MoM: Nurse (she still destroys them but it still extends the chase), Hag (she is strong but it can still mess her up), Billy (he sometimes has to M1 on pallets or windows), Clown and Spirit (both are good at getting hits anyway but it's the Nurse scenario again).
---
Killers hardly ever affected by MoM: Huntress, Legion, Plague.
---
TL;DR MoM screws over the majority of the *already weaker killers* and is only truly negated by, count them, three. That's it, three.
---
Yes, MIGHT spawn. My point still stands. You have to get to the totem and find it, aka check if it's there or not. Still a huge time waster. Noed doesn't have a downside. It's downside still provides an upside which is wasting a huge amount of time.
---
She can teabag me anytime 💜
---
'high enough' isn't Rank 15.
---
As a p3 level 50 meg main I can confirm this is us
---
I agree! But do you mean “This is Not Happening” instead of “Prove Thy Self”?
---
You don't realize how bad MoM is for m1 killers in it's current state do you? Basically trapper,doctor,Clown,Spirit,wraith,Freddy, and Michael(maybe nurse idk) can't or can only slightly counter MoM that's half the characters that can but unlikely to counter it. You basically can't avoid procking MoM with all those killers which forces people to use Hillbilly and other strong killer and doesn't every survivor complain about less diversity in high ranks? With the new MoM it allows people to play their mains and allows survivors to feel satisfied earning the extra hit instead of feeling bad.
---
Eh i never ran it. Always ran tinh, sb, adren, and one other that i can’t check cause i’m out right now. I can tell you once i can get on.
---
Killers: You shouldn't be allowed multiple second chance perks
---
Also Killers: I run Ruin+Enduring+Spirit Fury+BBQ&amp;Chili on Billy [or Nurse, just swap out Enduring+SF for two other perks] to make games go as fast as possible.
---
There are counters to current MOM but they suck. If you go from survivor to survivor (I see it all the time as 3-gen doc) they can often get their MOM off before their first down. In terms of M1 killer counters you have:
---
Facecamping until tier 2 and hitting them once they are unhooked before they can heal so they don't get enough tokens.
---
Bring a Mori every time you see an Ash. Tunnel off the hook and Mori. Since I've been running into MANY non-ash's all with MoM and instaheals the real solution is to bring an Ebony Mori every match, and Mori every single survivor. Checkmate, toxic SWF teams!
---
Hence why I agree there's no counterplay for M1 killers which sucks. The actual "Counterplay" involves doing shitty things to survivors (Nobody likes being tunneled off the hook and Mori'd. I will admit I find it funny how pathetic my survivor is when it happens to me, but most survivors hate it. Facecamping sucks period.) and since you can't predict which survivors are running it, you have to assume all 4 survivors are running it at all times.
---
 Nice
---
Holy crap man! Awesome job. I got the plat and have 92% overall but I haven’t even tried the huntress one since it seems so crazy.
---
WHY THE HELL DOES EVERY CANNIBAL FACECAMP
---
One can be open-minded about it, without wanting to bone a 15 years old or wanting to bone someone that looks like they are 15 years old.
---
You don't even know how killers work Only a braindead Billy M1s a survivor 3 times before landing a chainsaw. If MoM is giving a Billy trouble on a regular basis, that Billy is awful.
---
Everything I have said in this thread is 100% indisputable fact.
---
Okay, so what you're telling me is that you're so bad at mind games and ending chases that you worry about that so much? You do realize you have perks that can elimate pallets AND windows, right? Bamboozle and Spirirt Fury + Enduring AND you still have an extra slot for ruin. When killers can have perks that completely get rid of any defenses a survivor has, taking an extra hit doesn't seem like a problem.
---
They’re looking into it
---
Lmao survivors still complain about ruin... Just hit great skill checks.
---
Worst experience was when I just decided to pick up Huntress (because she's awesome). I've never been good at shooters so of course I hit like 90% of my hatchets into nothing and walls. First map was haddonfield (the myers map) and idk if they were swf but two just kept making fun of me with balanced landing, instaheals and teabagging while the other two rushed gens. One also had Object of Obsession and they enjoyed jumping in and out of lockers across the map because it would make them scream (Iron Maiden). I didnt catch anyone and when they proceeded to make fun of me instead of opening the gates I dced, my one and only time as a killer. Not proud of it. I really wish there were separate ranks for each killer. Had to play a few Spirit games to make up for the frustration.
---
Holy shit thats big
---
I never said bone, I said date
---
I do. They are all common though. Like I've never seen a spirit that didnt tunnel straight off the hook. I only have faced a couple of non hard tunneling wraiths. I meet so many camping bubbas and micheals with crazy add ons. Micheals are the most common though.
---
Amen!!!🙌🙌, right im beyond shocked they're trying to nerf it so quickly. It's been out what 2 months? Ds was out for 2 years or so before it was touched. This will Absolutely hurt sells because ash perks arent worth using.  So what's the point of buying him. I never use his character to play as. Lmaoo
---
i dont mind ruin, just not literally every game with nurse/billy and ruin. it gets so boring.
---
there are 4 survivors. everyone has to cleanse 1 totem and one person has to cleanse an additional one. EVERYONE in red ranks does that. git gut and stop complaining
---
I'm dead XD
---
urban countering her is not my problem. my problem is now fucked survivors are when they don't have it
---
&gt; Ruin.
---
Can be destroyed by breaking the totem.
---
&gt; Enduring 
---
being nerfed to shit.
---
&gt; Spirit fury
---
Still take the pallet stun
---
&gt; bbq
---
if you suspect it hide behind a gen.
---
Exactly. You can tell the Spirit who whiffs all game and is terrible at using her power and who tunnels one person most of the game despite constantly getting juked and failing to down them is going to have NOED. That's when I will go out of my way to find totems.
---
Yup, that four survivors not on gens. That's also only possible on swf. You're kidding yourself if you actually think even most games survivors are all gonna hop on four separate totems at the same time. LOL git gud and stop complaining about MoM when you have perks that can eliminate pallets and windows.
---
Along with what voidpool said, a lot of the complaints about Legion being op was due to Cold Dirt or Stab Wound Study and Frank's Mixtape, 3 rare add-ons for Legion.
---
You're right. If a Billy M1s three times, they're just going to M1 the injured survivor a fourth time. Because it's faster. Because they don't know a survivor is using MoM until they try to M1. You're really oblivious.
---
Idk about you but I didn’t pay for Ash to get his perks, I paid for Ash to play as Ash lmao
---
You probably run the same build too but with different items abd addons.
---
Not sure you realize why it is that there is only nurse and billy at red ranks...
---
Meeee
---
It needed a need but this feels a bit severe. That being said, underpowered perks don't disrupt the balance of the game. Overpowered ones do.
---
You dont need selfcare to survive in this game.. I trashed that perk back in November and havent missed it since.
---
99% of ppl would say otherwise lol
---
I'll be extremely disappointed if that MoM change makes it to live servers as is. I'm totally down for rebalancing MoM, like make it take 4 hits or even make it trigger exhaustion when you get the hit-ignore (and not be able to trigger if you are exhausted).. but tying it to protection hits will make me instantly take it off of any survivor it's currently on and never touch it again.
---
From a survivor's perspective, MoM doesn't work every game because of killer abilities. From a killer's perspective, it's a perk from hell if more than one person runs it, and you're not Huntress/Billy/Plauge/Nurse (before the fix). 
---
A single extra hit is annoying, but fine. Two or more is brutal, and is probably the difference between 0-1 kills and 2-3 kills.
---
I was thinking of buying Ash, but now that they're gonna nerf the living fuck out of MoM i rather pass
---
Ashe is a major character in horror genre, I don't think they needed a strong perk to sell that dlc.
---
Taking an extra hit is a massive problem for M1 killers there is no counter play and you earn by playing badly. Why should you get rewarded for getting hit it makes no sense. Also the perks you mentioned have counter play like ruin is basically useless unless RNG gives it a good spot. Enduring is getting nerfed so it only procks during pallet stuns. Spirit fury can be denied by dropping pallets early. Bamboozled though I admit is kinda uncounterable so you got me there. I'm not really bad at mindgames or chases though it's just so annoying when people get rewarded for playing wrecklessly then helping the team.
---
This was actually really fun to watch! I'd look forward to more of these.
---
no one wants to play as that dusty old man.  Imagine justifying this. I literally don’t use MoM because I knew this would happen. Go somewhere.
---
If they give you nerds canon lore: you’re just gonna spend all those countless hours poking holes in it, bitching about it, and being generally unhappy.
---
Why would BHVR introduce new problem-points without any kind of gain?
---
Or do “gAmErZ” think this is all “ezpz” since they can operate keyboards faster than their brains?
---
A lot of people don't realize how busted mettle of man is. Killers frequently run enduring because saving seconds here and there is massive against good survivors. This perk could increase the duration of chases by minutes similarly to how old DS could. In addition, all 4 survivors can run it. I'm glad it's getting a Nerf since I'm a M1 killer main, but I was sort of hoping for it to not just die like I think this change will do to it.
---
Once and for all lets see if you hear it from a developer you'll realize what I'm saying.
---
https://youtu.be/CSd82gEB9Ls?t=4326
---
At least we wont hear killer mains cry anymore about a survivor spamming the crouch button!
---
I think it makes some sense. The "protection" aspect of survivor play has never really been in the spotlight. People kind of know there are tactical uses of taking hits for other survivors, and WGLF has certainly put some importance on them, but at large, it's an underused and underdeveloped aspect of DbD gameplay. Sure, survivors will regularly take hits when another survivor is being carried to a hook, or in the end game to help another survivor make it to the exit, but other than that, protection hits are not really something that sees regular play. Interfering in a chase for instance is very valuable, taking a hit instead of having the chased survivor go down. Or trading places on hook, giving one of your hook lives for the hooked survivor not to lose a second one. Encouraging such plays and maybe in turn reworking some of the "protective hit" specifics (e. g. making the scoring events more consistent, maybe introducing other scoring events that also fall under protection) could be worthwhile. And getting a quasi-health state back for having given your health state(s) in the process of protecting others seems sensible.
---
Hahahahahaha oh god. Yeah, lets forfeit balance because its a "paid perk"
---
yes, my plan is coming thrue
---
As they should but the distance you get his away from the window sometimes is ridiculous. I’m happy to see they’re looking into the lunge animations because when you have the Legion’s little butter knife reach as far as the Trapper’s giant machete it just feels so bad.
---
Enduring reduces stuns so you swing through pallets like you should as a killer not respecting (getting hit with a pallet isn't a loss). Spirit fury rewards you for kicking pallets, which let's survivors gain distance (and it's the correct thing to do in most cases).
---
Which makes it the first place I check if there's several injured and hiding.
---
&gt;	You can play around spirit fury by dropping the pallet a tiny bit earlier.
---
While true, the counter-play is unrealistic. With a minimum of 8 pallets on the map, you cannot afford to waste pallets early because it literally kills you and your team. It's counter-play still screws over your team and is not skill-oriented in the slightest. You also have *zero* feedback the killer even has  the Spirit Fury perk without the use of voice comms, further weakening solo players. A pallet stun should be rewarded and feel good from the survivor side, hence why you get 1000 points. It's conditions to activate require you to do basic tasks in the game that happen naturally regardless, making it a truly brain-dead perk. 
---
&gt;	For best results, you need to combo spirit fury with enduring. That’s half your build right there.
---
Most skilled killers ran Enduring even before the release of Spirit Fury. Enduring lets you eat the pallet stuns and be more aggressive with all things concerning pallets. Enduring affecting DS was always a bonus, but my primary use for enduring was always to disrespect pallets without any care.
---
And yes, I agree with your statement on Mettle of Man. It needs a change as well and I'm glad the devs are listening to that.
---
My point is that a survivor this bad will probably waste the speed boost dropping a pallette, vaulting a window or getting stuck in a corner so it usually doesn't amount to the 15 seconds
---
Well, but it is desync issue. Every online player has different view on screen and the server receives each of those and try to synchronise it together. Which means there can be slight differences in thing like model position for each player, because server tries to synchronise your game with other person game. And thus, the moment you get hit where you "shouldn't" get hit, you got hit on the screen of another player.  
---
Its not a problem of hitboxes that much, more of like INCREDIBLY high desynchronisation issue comparing to desynchronise in other online games.
---
I do agree that these perks do a massive blow to survivors but survivors are meant to not live alot. Which is why the game is becoming more killer sided. The build you mentioned though only counters  chasing which puts it at a disadvantage of gen rushing. Personally I think this is a discussion that has many sides that you can argue which'll make this thread long. I believe you should be more respectful in these discussions though because the way you type makes you sound unthoughtful I had fun discussing this though just don't want this to be drawn out
---
Idk if this is still too much of a nerf to MoM, but what if they made it so that after you get your free hit, you’re exposed/broken for the rest of the match instead of having your aura shown? Basically giving yourself a 3-hit down now in exchange for a 1-hit down in the future. The biggest issue with this is that it usually activates on a survivor’s 3rd hook anyway, but failure for that to happen would be a big risk on the survivor’s side. I’m also not a game designer though so...
---
&gt; isn't that OP, it just activates too often.
---
Excuse me, WTF? That statement makes absolutely no sense, its either OP or it activates as often as needed therefore its balanced.
---
That “dusty old man” is one of the greatest horror legends of all time.
---
The problem with MoM is the overall affect on the game. There’s just not enough time in the trial to justify a perk like MoM. It doesn’t matter how good of a killer you are, gens get done really, really quick. MoM fucks up this balance by not allowing any real counter play. Especially if 2+ survivors are running this perk, the trial just becomes a shit show.
---
So, yea. That was also the same exact problem with the old DS. Now you can at least potentially avoid it. MoM needs to have the same thing happen to it.
---
Watch the latest stream - re: enduring.
---
The old it was just a joke guys excuse.
---
You hate it because it’s true... it rewards bad play.
---
I know it's a bit off topic, but I was actually thinking of a new add on for toolboxes that is somewhat related to this.
---
It would make it so when you start using the toolbox, it keeps throwing skillchecks at you till you fail one. If you fail it, you have to let go of the button and start repairing with the toolbox again if you want the effect to repeat.
---
It'd be like a weaker, more skill reliant Brand new part. If you are good enough at skillchecks, you can get many greats in a row to speed up the process. If you suck then it just gives you points faster. It'd also get cucked by Ruin.
---
You should be using you powers anyway unless you're forced not to.
---
They're nerfing MoM for the same reason they nerfed Freddy: bad players are complaining.
---
Either I'm right or I'm a killer of unusually high skill. I'll let you guess which one.
---
Tbagging is toxic too but guess what? Ghostface is going to tbag.. you think they will nerf that? Flashlights can be toxic as well. So is camping the hook and tunneling. What’s your point?
---
Not at all, he gets stall, stealth, tracking and good m1 mindgames in exchanges for 'hurr durr 7 seconds'
---
If people are mad about this, it's their fault for buying him for that perk and not waiting until after the (honestly, inevitable) nerf. My only concern is how MoM is getting nerfed after a few months, while DS' nerf took *years*.
---
Getting hit with a pallet is as much as a detriment as getting hit by a killer. Spirit Fury does reward you for getting stunned since it breaks the pallet once you're  stunned.
---
We should be able to unlock multiple perks per level for both survivors and killer. The amount of points you have to grind so you can get a proper build is just too much. Especially for a new player, the progression in this game is a full time job.
---
Weird, I’m pretty high rank and I couldn’t get a chainsaw if my life depended on it.
---
7 seconds fedora man bad lol
---
This is so wholesome!
---
Yea people aren't going to trust their future DLC perks to not change now. It's kinda baity.
---
It definitely won't be as relevant as it is now. Most likely not a meta-perk. Then again, it would still have relatively consistent use, at least if needing only 2 protective hits. For one thing, if you are 1-for-1ing hooks, you regularly do take 2 protective hits right then and there - the first around the hook, the second right after unhooking. This would be a reliable, trade-off way to activate your MOM, giving you a free hit once you are off the hook yourself. Plus now it would also work against ability-hits, as long as they are taken in a protection context.
---
I was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/badslg/its_3_am_and_i_might_know_how_to_fix_freddy/?st=jvr4cm1o&amp;sh=7c3afc36) from /u/AlphButReal
---
Almost nothing in this games has stayed the same because it's an online multi-player game with constant additions. If you haven't realized this by now, then you need to.
---
Was. Like in the second film. They picked the wrong aged ash to put in the game
---
NOT TOO LONG AGO SOME ASSHOLE TEABAGGED ME TO DRAW MY ATTENTION, I DOWNED HER, THEN SHE DC'D.  FIRST DOWN ON HER, MID WAY THROUGH THE GAME, NO ONE ELSE ON HOOK OR SACRIFICED.  IT'S LIKE SHE DELIBERATELY WENT IN PLANNING TO DC.
---
THERE ARE DEFINITELY PEOPLE PLAYING WITH THE SPECIFIC INTENT TO DC.
---
So, you paid real money for the sole purpose of using a very obviously over powered perk? Smart investment.
---
So would you call Spirit fury, Corrupt intervention and Ruin trash perks with trash design?
---
They don't require any skill and you benefit from them by purely existing.
---
The caption at the top ruins this one I think, it would be a lot funnier without it
---
Get good
---
Read the developers update, MoM is going to be changed very soon
---
Hmmm
---
Bet
---
For survivor, what perks are you running? Would definitely recommend Self Care and an Exhaustion perk (Balanced Landing or Lithe, probably, take your pick). Other than that, you just gotta learn the maps and the loops. The more you play, survivor or killer, the better you'll start to learn where pallets and windows are, and even just things like gen spawns so you aren't spending forever running around looking for one. Same thing goes for watching YouTubers! Pay attention to the maps, and pay attention to where they're running to when they start a chase.
---
And the number one thing: practice. Don't be afraid to take on chases, even if you suck at it! Playing super immersed isn't going to help anybody. Get the killer on you and try to loop him, and don't be upset when you go down. You'll start to learn what's working and what's not, and before you know it, you'll be looping like the best of 'em.
---
&gt; they only listen to killer mains.
---
You been here on Freddy release?
---
&gt;  you're so bad at mind games and ending chases that you worry about that so much? 
---
So it's ok for people who use MoM to get essentially a free health state for doing literally nothing outside their normal playstyle, while killers who go against it (especially the m1 killers who literally have no counter to it) have to hope they can trick or chase those people who use MoM (a time waster) in a fast amount of time? Hypocrisy much?
---
then throw on we'll make it and you have big brain
---
Yes he is bad. The worst out of all killers. You can still 4k with him on red ranks no perks no add-ons but he is still the worst.
---
hello this is brain. i am unavailable at the moment. please leave a message after the tone. *beep*
---
Enduring is getting nerfed?
---
You're a kid am I right? Either that or you have an underdeveloped brain if you think its the same kind of "toxic" I'm talking about...
---
Tbagging isn't toxic FOR THE GAME. Flashlights were way more toxic (to both the game and to the killer) before and they adjusted that exactly for that point, so were camping and tunneling and they adjusted that as well.
---
But, as I said, even with all those peeks you still have room for ruin which hinders Gen rushing. And being able to end chases fats also stops Gen rushing. And I am being respectful, they're just making shitty arguments.
---
Thats because if they listened to everything killer mains said, every survivor would start a trial in the dying state 😭😭
---
I’ve been getting fairly low games but that may just be because i’m i nthe us and therefore closer to the most popular servers. If i get a game over 120 i usually just leave the lobby. Getting a game below 60 is lucky but not super rare for me at least.
---
&gt;It’s incredible how quick they are to nerf any good or strong survivor perk.
---
Excuse me? Balanced Landing? Self-Care? Adrenaline? Lithe? DS both new &amp; old? Dead Hard?
---
Survivor perks act as insurance policies for when you fuck up, you have MULTIPLE of them and can stack them. MoM was just another one for the pile and I really don't see how its a loss. I long for the day when survivor perks reward skilled play instead of acting as a buffer to save people from their shitty decisions. Killers have Insurance Policy perks too but there aren't many to begin with and there's this weird stigma about using them despite them being a parallel to Survivor perks. And unlike those perks, the killer perks [Ruin, NOED, to some extent Bitter Murmur] can be countered.
---
EDIT: Also its fucking Ash Vs. Evil Dead! If you're buying him purely for the one perk its on you, not them. The devs owe you _nothing_ when its their job to balance stuff. If you don't wanna 'waste money on DLC' then don't buy it first chance you can.
---
Excuse me... I meant u/ -FL4K-
---
They'll be able to tbag and they'll still complain about survivors tbagging lmaoo.
---
How it doesn't have a down side ? You can literally remove the perk before activates.
---
Giddy up cowboy
---
Wanna talk about hypocrisy? Go read what I said about spirit fury and enduring. A killer also is getting rewarded for doing nothing outside their normal playstyle (you should always be hitting through pallets) and you eseentisly make pallets useless.
---
Canon* omg
---
But it wastes a huge amount of time.
---
Kinda doesn't effect flashlights or wiggle stuns but faster pallet stun recovery.
---
pretending most console killers aren't boosted animals that only know how to tunnel/camp.  The issue is still there even if you aren't the one tunneled, true you may just escape in which the perk was not even used or it won't make a difference against a tunneling killer where you activate it only after your 2nd hook. Which I wouldn't call that instance of it being OP.
---
You have to get chased a decent amount before even being able to use the perk or worry about it as survivor and killer respectively. We all know for a fact that most games that won't happen and the killer is just flatout doing something wrong if they have MoM constantly activate on them 3-4 times a match.
---
Camping and tunneling was adjusted? Lmaooo why because you don’t get as many bp? Y’all hear something? Nah didn’t think so.
---
And it's a pretty insane and borderline opressive combo.
---
It'd be nice if it had any indicator, like the killer's eyes starting to glow, etc.
---
As it is right now it's heavily punishing solo players, as in swf you can call out how many pallets the killer has kicked/whether or not they have SF. When you are solo you can get screwed by your teammate who used 2 pallets and you get to enjoy the surprise.
---
No, BOOM!
---
He found hatch.
---
oof ouch my bones!
---
Except there's a lot more than just one pallet on the map. Survivors *will* be in chases and *will* get hit (unless they're immersed af).
---
He isn't bad, people just play him wrong. People play him as a tunnel killer, putting one guy to sleep with double blocks then chasing him the entire game when he's a stall killer, keeping as many people in dream as possible and switching targets constantly.
---
Botany knowledge also works when healing other people.. And it's less situational to run than We'll Make It. I don't usually run self care because it is a huge time sink, but when I do, I always pair it with Botany Knowledge. Gets me back on the objective sooner.
---
Honestly, it's just better to bring in a med kit and skip SC entirely. Of course, it's best to just let your teammates heal you.
---
&gt;Noed just got buffed a few patches ago
---
Nerfed. NOED got nerfed. The tier 3 version lost power, which is the only version that should be used in nerf/buff discussions. Making Tier 1/2 not hot garbage shouldn't be an issue because past a certain point, you should always expect your opponents to be running the tier 3 version.
---
IDK, I have no sympathy for anyone who bought Ash with the intent of only owning an OP perk. That’s the definition of pay to win. Before Ash was even released, any logical thinking human being should have known something so strong will more than likely be looked at. There was only 5,000 threads on Reddit, DBD forums and steam forums about the new “DS 2.0”. You’re a fool to assume this would never be fixed.
---
Granted, I think it was fucked up for BHVR to release a dumbass perk like MoM without even running it through PTB and happily accept money knowing damn well they’re gonna be nerfing it.
---
no because ranking up means nothing to me, unlike a lot of players. i switch up my build constantly because its a lot of fun to do
---
Yup, there's more than one which is why spirit fury and enduring becomes extremely powerful lol
---
Is there any examples other than Ask? That’s the only one i’ve seen.
---
When were sacrifices made to take longer and generators sped up? I thought we reached the point devs didn't want to make gens take longer and instead made healing (ESPECIALLY Self-Care healing) take longer?
---
Oh. I’m stupid. I never use it so i always forget it.
---
Throwing some Shad there.
---
Dont hold it for too long
---
They seem pretty confident with the change so it only gains stacks with protection hits (though they mentioned they might look into protection hits being buggy af if they go that way)
---
Obviously if the killer has bad connection then everyone us going to lag.  Doesnt mean it's done intentionally or with a lag switch.  Could just mean his internet isnt great.  No need to accuse people of cheating without proof.
---
&gt; Yeah because dream is so hard to wake up from.
---
Its decently easy yeah, but you gotta factor in what 8+ seconds of working on a gen at 50% speed and the 8% regression of the gen that the failed skill check brings. Plus his stall gets even better with dress addons.
---
&gt; Tell me how good he is after you play vs people who will exploit that powers weakness to maximum.
---
Yeah I know you can pop shit in his face. It's one of his weaknesses, which would need to be addressed in a buff, and thats one of the reasons Freddy is mid.
---
It’s a rework
---
Yeah.
---
Using one perk to assist another is just synergy, but I'd probably only set spirit fury. Distortion exists btw
---
Huntress with a huge cock buttfucking Dwight.
---
Sounds like you haven’t been paying attention.
---
Let me help you finish that last part
---
“And.... I deserve to get what I paid for. End of story.”
---
Saying that it felt like lag switch is the same as accusing him of cheating.
---
Survivors survived before MoM release, they will even survive after his nerf.
---
Doing something wrong, you mean like hitting body blockers at hooks or not tunneling the person unhooked and going after the unhooker or a new survivor instead? Playing fair and letting everyone have a chance at some fun ends up screwing you as killer so I guess it is wrong in the current meta.
---
Well there really isn’t another reason to buy a survivor besides the perks
---

I'm not going to go into the whole "NOED can be countered", "New Legion is bad", "Gens are too fast", "Adred OP" etc. etc. etc. arguments. All I'll say is that it's really laughable how fast Survivors will cry about their perks being nerfed while Killers just quietly accept as Survivors get stronger and stronger.
---
Not saying that Killers aren't getting stronger too (less pallets and more forgiving hitboxes allowing hits through pallets/windows) but it seriously makes me roll my eyes that the straw which breaks the camels' back is always the lightest one. Unless you're one of those people who thinks old Decisive was balanced then I think it's easy to understand why getting an extra hit in a chase just for existing is unbalanced.
---
&gt;My only concern is how MoM is getting nerfed after a few months, while DS' nerf took years.
---
Not sure I understand that part, because they fucked up and waited years to fix something they should also take years to fix this one?
---
Are you saying the meta build allows for second chances? Because NOED would be a more accurate comparison.
---
This is everything I like
---
I absolutely love this update.
---
#1 reason to not prestige. It's not worth grinding for this many perks just for bbq then prestigng again. Ik that isn't probably ops situation, but with all the new cosmetics out and how abysmal the red item drop rate is for p3 bloodwebs.. dont bother.
---
But that wouldn't be Lesbian.
---
no, you're not. it's ok for not knowing the abbreviation of some perks lol
---
Looong time ago. It's kinda irrelivant but there were a lot of Killer nerfs in Dead by Daylight's history that most people forget about.
---
The thing about sacrifices taking longer was mainly implemented to counter camping, but it also nerfed Killer as a whole. Typical shotgun approach to balance from good old Behavior.
---
Thank you finally someone who isn’t stuck on stupid
---
Head On and Quick &amp; Quiet most likely.
---
I literally have to run straight to my totem when it spawns at least 40m away because there are always scratch marks next to it by the time i get there.
---
No, I'm just confused as to how this MoM issue is being fixed relatively quickly, while DS was stuck in the state it was for years.
---
You did, you got Ash.
---
So soon, so big? It will be unusable if they do what they're planning. Another trash perk which rarely is useful, like Unbreakable. 
---
Will be useful 1 in 10 matches, which means 9 out of 10 matches you're playing with 3 perks.
---
I’ve adapted to survivors perks, they don’t really give me any issues but mettle of man still triggers me hardcore though.
---
LOL, please read the terms of service. You're not paying for a immutable product.
---
Nah, I just hope they can suck it up...
---
Come to Freddy
---
No i get it. I don’t agree with pig changes at all. The traps should not have been nerfed but you can’t act like we are still in the dark times and you can’t act like MoM is so damn toxic that it takes us to the dark times.
---
Do you know how much healing has been repeatedly nerfed throughout the years? Constantly. The only buff I can think of is when they buffed brown medkits to give you a full heal instead of only a partial heal (brown medkits were useless). 
---
I believe healing started out at 10 seconds (with self-care giving you 150%) then to 12 seconds and now 16 seconds. 
---
It's no wonder Adrenaline grew in popularity over the years as healing became less viable and killers have received nonstop buffs in increased efficiency. 
---
You always hear about these adrenaline plays and how shit it feels, but you never hear about all the hooks killers get when they down a survivor who hasn't been able to heal.
---
Unless you are playing in a SWF, getting 5 totems broken by yourself while playing against a competent killer is pretty unreliable. Plus if you are getting chased for most of the game (which happens often) you physically cannot do anything about NOED yourself, even if you wanted to dedicated time to getting rid of it. Crossing your fingers and hoping your teammates did it for you isn't counterplay.
---
Add the fact that there is no indicator that NOED even is in play, so half of the time you will be wasting your time, sandbagging your team. It really feels bad when you have used up a lot of your time going totem hunting and then you see that it was all for nothing.
---
It really hurts the killer when you're playing a normal m1 killer.
---
And his three perks.
---
Thank you, next.
---
You’re not listening to what he’s saying. It’s because of connection, not hit boxes.
---
If Billy was made a 110 killer, he would be dogshit. His power doesn't help him in a loop 99% of the time, unlike the other 110 killers
---
What the fuck is he /she supposed to do for not letting them activate MOM?  Camp them? Mori them?
---
What about WGLF and how buggy the perk is with not rewarding your tokens?
---
I feel bad, I just switched over to PC from PS4, and I managed to get BBQ on my all killers within 4 webs.
---
Okay, killers also have to do nothing out of the normal, just chase and swing through pallets. Break them like a normal chase and survivors get no warning the first time either. I'd say ignoring a pallet and getting a free hit is a big effect aswell.
---
My problem with it is that both maps for the red forest are so big. RIP to any hag that gets those maps
---
Oh those age common gen spawns on that map. Odd that’s it’s the first time it’s happened for you
---
Man why do people keep belittling Scream to this shitty movie I’m just wondering
---
I miss Insta-Mori. It was bullshit to go against (Ebony: Hit, Hit, Mori, Hit, Hit,  Mori, Hit, Hit, Mori. Last guy escapes through hatch) but I loved Mori-ing a DS user or a survivor I particularly hated without having to hook them first.
---
New legion is good. Hes annoying af to go against. Hes fast af.
---
Because it’s funny..
---
Just proof this system needs to be looked at for both killer and survivor. There’s already enough useless perks in the game and every 3 months they’re adding 3 more to both sides plus the odd solo drop like Ash and Leatherface. There’s already 60+ survivor perks iirc which means at least 180 bloodwebs for fully maxes perks and 50+ killer perks which means 150 bloodwebs. When is it enough?
---
I mean yes, as much as people want to label me as a crybaby survivor main in a discussion like this, I'm not against a killer singling out a certain survivor to kill them early, hell even the reverse of that is possible. If you barely start chasing someone and down them near the end of a match and get them killed on first or 2nd hook they won't have enough stacks to even activate MoM.
---
I'm not against doing what you can to win, I don't care if every killer is running NOED, I don't care if the killer patrols the hook, or if they only focus on 1 survivor. I'll have my opinions on how effective or good that makes you as a killer, but you can still do it and get the reward you deserve if you camped to hard to decay your emblem or let others get away as a result, or maybe on the flip side take advantage of over altruism or snowball from it in some other way.
---
Not sure if you tried a "gotcha!" moment for not following the "fake survivor rules" people make up that I don't care about.
---
Kid STFU talking about dark times, you clearly weren't playing this game back then. You have no right to say anything about it. You literally just said that they only listen to killer mains... You're pathetic. You should visit r/entitledkids/ you'll find many kids like you there.
---
No, no what are you doing? IM SAYING NO!!!
---
Yeah it’s really not when people have posted this same picture/scene 50 times 🙄
---
Can y’all put a totem counter on both sides HUDs so solo survivors have a chance to counterplay?  It’s a small change that would make it a whole lot more fun for me to play against.
---
If it's usable at all tiers it's a buff. It's even listed as a buff in the official wikia.
---
Trapper and Wraith are the best parts of this comment.
---
What about overall brightness and contrast of the game? I play on PS4 and I feel like this is a big issue. Some rooms are way too bright and others too dark and it depends on the map too. For instance some basements are dark on maps and others not so much. It makes things really hard to see especially scratch marks. This wasn’t an issue I was experiencing before they added the Legion chapter back in December
---
whats the ticket about? maybe they're faster or slower depending on the issue
---
I haven’t seen this one posted by anyone else.
---
Awe, I’ll see you there I guess lmao 🤙🏼
---
Well I would like to believe that behaviour is improving as a game developer and reacting more quickly and precisely about issues in this game.
---
Hey, too much blood, not good, please change blood to white color and reupload.
---
If you think nurse isn't broken, you're honestly delusional.
---
honestly Killer Main here (look at Flair) And I dont get the Problem with MoM. So many Killers counter it and its just 1 extra Hit.
---
Yeah, seriously. If you're a decent killer, getting one more hit shouldn't be a huge deal. If killers hit survivors an average of, say, 24 times per match, getting 25 hits shouldn't break the game.
---
But your change just buffed the hell out of Mettle of Man. Your version would activate every time, against any killer and it would lose even his drawback ( the aura reading at full health ). Literally, all you could do against your "MoM" version would be to face camp any survivor on their second hook.
---
I believe the latest dev stream confirmed that Enduring will be getting nerfed when dealing with things like Decisive Strike.  
---
In the words of the developers, it's only going to work when pallet-stunned. In exchange, though, it is also receiving a small buff in this specific situation, so you'll be able to recover 0.14 seconds faster than before.  
---
Spirit Fury + Enduring still means you get a free hit, so nothing of value has really been lost.  
---
Here's a [clip](https://www.twitch.tv/deadbydaylight/clip/SteamyImportantOilPlanking?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) regarding the Enduring nerf.
---
I like how you say, “end of story” and “next” as if legitimately validates your opinion as fact. Meta perks come and go. This is every single online game. This is also well known in the DBD community. If you bought Ash with the intention of owning a meta perk that will never, ever change, then that is truly ignorant on your part.
---
I think it does need an indicator, just guessing isn't good enough of a counterplay.
---
Any killer that has a brain and is playing an m1 killer is running Enduring, and has been using Enduring prior to the release of Spirit fury. The argument that you have to use both perks to use it doesn't have as much power if half of that combo would be meta anyway.
---
If your name is Nurse, Spirit, Hag or Huntress (tho I like it on her), you aren't running Enduring. If you are anyone else, you are using it.
---
Prior to SF release the meta build for m1 killers was BBQ, ruin, enduring and either Nurse's or Brutal strength. Now it's BBQ, Ruin, Enduring &amp; SF because its power trumps both of the previous perks.
---
I don’t mind losing a survivor to DS, DJ, BT because it either requires skill on their part or tunneling on mine. 
---
But Mettle is stupid.
---
It's still not confirmed so I don't think we should be crying rn
---
Hey it’s not that bad
---
my survivor rank is stuck... first it was stuck at rank 13 after the reset, now is stuck at 15 after the reset
---
I said C’mere. Right meow.
---
The Meg's I know are just crouching around and do nothing
---
Not really, he’s still super popular and his show was great.
---
Enduring is still good, even a little better now. You didn't pick up enduring to counter new DS in the first place. You use it to swing through pallets.
---
not "hop on four totems at the same time". are you passing by a place where totem could spawn? if yes, check that spot. is there a totem? if yes, cleanse it. is it so hard?
---
I'm pretty sure it does. Well idk Haven't used enduring in a while
---
MoM was one of the most interesting perks created for a survivor. Why change it? I think this is a big mistake.
---
Literally every killer has the same exact hitbox.
---
I knew this would become the next meme the moment I saw this lol
---
Uh Huh, and that wastes time aswell.
---
Um... What? If the survivor is preventing noed he/she is not helping the team?
---
Bitch please.
---
Without addons she isn't. This isn't 2016 anymore buddy Nurse complaining can go in the trash where it belongs
---
I just wanted to P3 one of my main killers, and I like to have something to finish and grind for.
---
Oh, that radical feminist look.
---
Billy is the most balanced character in the game, even according to the devs. If you think his insta-down is easy, you're playing poorly.
---
oof. have u tried the forums? and reported it as a bug?
---
Doctor lore is more like AVADACADABRA!
---
It really does tbh, there are lot of players who play m1 killers like me who are constantly getting fcked by MOM in the end games, it's a solid perk that doesn't require a change of play style at all
---
It does require a bit of tweaking
---
You can't expect people to change their mains for one perk.
---
It really doesn't. Bring a green map if you're so worried about it. You'll find all the totems in less time than it takes to get a gen done.
---
Sometimes tunneling is a viable play though, like if you have Dying Light or Remember Me (pretty much the only times tbf)
---
The community on Reddit is generally nice, but in game everyone is kind of a jerk...
---
You shouldn’t need to counter any perk specifically! With other perks you can at least get around it with some actual planning, but MoM was just a brain dead perk that you had to deal with if you wanted a 4K.
---
Not two months after release dude. That’s extreme. Nothing has been changed this quick and they are doing it to please one side of players as if killers don’t tunnel after hitting MoM off a survivor and downing them anyway.
---
The MoM changes are rather unfortunate.
---
Protection hits are buggy. Sometimes they don’t register even if you’re standing in front of multiple survivors. 
---
Although it’s a good direction, they might want to consider adding another category to build stacks like “Distraction”. It still has the same concept as building stacks by protecting other survivors, but you have additional options that won’t shift gameplay in a negative way (IE. survivors running in front of killers just to get a stack).
---
Another idea is to make MoM stack faster. A “Protection” hit could grant double stacks of MoM. This would allow killers to get rid of MoM quicker and spend fewer M1 hits to do so. Fewer M1 hits = less speed boosts and shorter chases. If MoM is proc’d in the early to mid game, then it will be harder to heal up and escape because of the aura reveal. 
---
Currently, MoM is being built up in the early and mid game, and proc’d in the late game making the aura reveal a laughable consequence. The aura reveal needs to come into play more to balance MoM.
---
Yeah, that a fair point when it comes to survivors. I am mostly playing killers now and kinda forgot how easy it was to teach stuff on the side. I really hope the developers look into improving the current system.
---
Oh, never played that, sorry... I'm uncultured lol.
---
"it only protects from one hit"
---
WE know bud!
---
And that really really prolongs the chase, which I turn can change the outcome of a match, if it's worse than dead hard then why it's almost immediately become the meta.
---
The perk by itself shouldn't exists
---
He was pointing out that leatherface counters MoM about as well as huntress doesn't - which is to say, LF barely counters it, and huntress mostly counters it
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
That's fair. I did it with my main survivor back in the day when you had nothing else to do and there were a ton less survivors. I could see the argument made for killers more since a lot of killers rely on rarer addons, too. But I personally would rather just level someone until they have all perks. I did both (p3 and all perks level 3) with feng min and it cost sooo many millions of BP lol
---
It's certainly better than old Decisive but I still think it's incredibly broken to get a chase extension just by existing. It's extremely cancerous when multiple Survivors have it as well and it makes me roll my eyes that Behavior thought the same balancing technique they used with Decisive Strike (IE "iF yOu HaVe ThE pErK yOu BeCoMe ThE oBsEsSiOn") would work with Mettle, especially since Mettle has *literally no downside* when being used by a non-Obsession.
---
How would you feel if Dead Hard didn’t work at tier one and two but only at three. Then BHVR decides to adjust it so DH worked at all tiers. It’s the exact same shit, you just don’t have to level it up so you don’t have a useless perk.
---
I need them to remaster this picture
---
It'd be too easy to counter with an indicator. It's not overpowered and is in a good spot.
---
I'm SORRRRRRYYYYYYYYY
---
ye, but its useless against like 50% of the killers
---
Legion included
---
why y'all gotta be nasty tho?
---
&gt; Enduring and spirit fury literally reward you for getting stunned lol.
---
Getting stunned isn't losing. That's delusional survivor main thinking.
---
Shut up
---
It hurts but the perk does need some tweaking.
---
Its just a prototype as mentioned so we shouldn't really think about rn
---
You're trippin... legion is hot garbage.
---
People really think MoM needs a nerf... yikes.
---
If she's the Zoomer, is Ash Williams the Boomer?
---
by this logic, killers shouldn't be allowed perks that allow them to cut chases short, such as any exposed effect, bamboozle, several killer powers, or perks such as enduring and spirit fury that basically negate pallets almost entirely.
---
Mettle of Man only exacerbated the use of Billy and Nurse because the other 2/3 of the killer cast had no way to reliably counter it but go off.
---
Or jump down from a window at Larry’s and just collapse mid air
---
Someone agree with me
---
REDUCE PEBBLE TIME FROM 45 TO 30 GAUD DAMN IT.
---
As it is right now if you are playing solo you never know if the killer has it, you can get screwed over by your teammate who used two pallets and you get to enjoy the surprise.
---
Throwing the pallet early in every chase because you are assuming they have it is not good counterplay.
---
Kinda agree but people will still ship regardless, I think.
---
You should read the ToS before you realize how that’s not gonna happen.
---
Ruin and NoED are 3000% more obnoxious than MoM EVER could be.
---
But it also punishes m1 killers for doing their job, with no counters
---
Yea wtf ... are they gonna bring it back ?
---
i tried the forums, they told me to send the ticket
---
Im prestige 3 lvl 45 still no bbq and chili on the fucking pig.
---
Yeah, I guess. I run MYC Piggy, so I really don't have too many issues with MoM.
---
You can make a good guess. Spirit Fury was literally the exact perk needed for game health. It make basic killers better while not making the top tier killers outside Billy stronger. I hate to say it, but just learn to play around it better.
---
Hey kids, you like violence?
---
No, you just suck.
---
We are literally reading what you're writing bud.
---
Ah, do you hear that? thats the sound of entitlement. : )
---
No, myers has the longest lunge.
---
Make it a 1:30 sec timer without being in terror radius and remove the standing still thing/crouching
---
That nea head is ugly
---
A good nurse wipes the floor with the survivors with no counterplay, regardless of add-ons. If you don't think that's true, you're a bad nurse.
---
well enjoy dying to noed then

I like the change. Maybe they could make it 2 hits instead of 3? Or making it an exhaustion perk.

You can refund something on Xbox, one time, no questions asked.
---
Good tip if youre just starting out, level up characters with teachables youre gonna run most of the time, once you get those it wont feel too much like a grind, and unless youre a completionist, dont prestige. If anything pick your favorite survivor/killer and grind them to p3 to get the outfit and acheivment, other than that youre just prolonging the grind for no reason
---
Nah just got randomly depressed like other teens
---
*Nothing personal kid*
---
And fix head on as most of the time, it gives exhaustion and doesn't stun the killer.
---
I am saying that the meta build with Instasaw Billy or Nurse makes games go so quickly that second chances are pretty much necessary to get anywhere.
---
"Aftercare", huh?
---
I had a Mori daily cucked after survivors would DC on their second down. Now my Mori's gone and I'm down a fuckton of bloodpoints dumped into a killer I hardly play for the daily. 
---
This glitch would have outright *improved my gaming experience* by letting me accomplish my daily even when a group of toxic survivors want to do everything they can to deny it. It could also let you hook them for BBQ stacks.
---
Please don't call MOM super situational... Dont be like that you're a feng main like me...
---
Don't do it.
---
sounds like you let a few comments dictate your entire view on lore

Can we just get 3 new ash perks since they will all be shit tier now?

Clown: So you know I'll set up some hooks and gas bottles and get the survivors down in the shack. And they'll get on the hooks because of the **implication**.
---
Wraith: Wait, I was with you for the first part but you lost me at the end
---
Clown: Well you know, scared and dying survivors, they're not gonna go anywhere. Cause of the **implication**.
---
Yeah. I'm cool with a rebalance for it but if it's only to take a hit for someone else it would be situational and useless. I have to problems with this game. Camping and tunneling straight from the hook. I want something to protect me from being taken advantage of in matches. Which MoM helped with.
---
If you constantly have internet issues, then that is a you problem. You are also hindering other peoples experience because you dc every other game or simply don't play well because you lag too much.
---
Man, you're evil. Every Nurse main is evil
---
Actually, with Spirit Fury, some pallets I'd rather leave alone (ones with very little distance for me to cross from side to side) I kick to work up Spirit Fury. Not to mention that merely ending a chase early isn't as powerful as negating what would have otherwise been a chase/a hook and one less life for the MoM user. Plus, killers should be disrespecting pallets, anyway.
---
Off-topic, but any good fanfictions you can reccomend? lmao
---
Way to be rude. God forbid that MCote be happy and goofy considering all the shit he gets regarding this game...
---
If you “don’t get the problem” with MoM, you’re not a very good/experienced killer.
---
And before you ask, no camping and no end game entity sacrifices either. I didn't even one hit fully sick people that much.
---
Idk about flashlight saves, but Enduring does squat against wiggle escapes (even though it should).
---
Yeah I'll be sure to make random guesses better.
---
Maybe.
---
thats true
---
Imagine comparing these two things. The audacity.
---
You’re entitled to your own opinion, doesn’t mean it’s valid. I don’t run 4 meta perks because i like having fun.
---
because? every Killer with an insta down or ability can easily counter it

They finally added Mccote as occasional pop up on your screen during trials. No it isn't suppost to be a jumpscare or anything, he just wants to say hi

I rarely use self care so I don’t know about Botany Knowledge. I feel like only heal time is kinda meh. Give it an aura or after heal your next heal is faster. Something added

I’m sure your mom did the same when she first saw you
---
Hum hum piggy hum hum wraith
---
I just unmarked it, I don’t know why there was one lol.
---
Wrong but 👌🏻
---
&gt;they deserve to escape if they’ve made it to this situation
---
Survivors don't deserve to escape just because they equipped a perk. 
---
&gt;instead they choose a perk which is a ONE time use perk
---
Old DS was a one time use perk, and even the devs wised up to how frustrating it was for the community.
---
&gt;But people payed actual money for JUST THIS PERK
---
People paid for old DS too. You shelling out money for a perk does not mean it deserves to stay in the state it was originally in forever. Plus, by that logic, none of the perks should have ever been changed in the first place, because they were in the game that we shelled out money for.
---
WMI is strictly altruistic tho. You gotta heal yourself too. Look at those juicy 9.5 seconds to heal yourself with a med-kit, so freakin tempting
---
Nice try Claudette!
---
I want this mask
---
So you ok with survivor going for another loop or two? Fine
---
Yea I think we all know its a good perk but I already have to run "we're going to live forever" "borrowed time" "self-care/or adrenaline" "insert exhaustion perk here". Botany just isnt worth a little faster healing. I run it sometimes cause you feel good healing everyone fast but sometimes its useless or there are better perks to use instead. Maybe if the game becomes less grindy or borrowed time becomes less useful somehow then ill finally be able to use more fun perks but for now... :)
---
AND SERIOUSLY HOW IS KILLER ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY AT HATCH. JUST ONCE SPAWN ON ME PLEASE
---
Enduring currently works against ds, I think that’s why it is getting nerfed
---
It's a parody on I am the model of the modern major general, from The Pirate's of Penzance
---
Love the claudette
---
Just because you paid money for a perk doesn't mean it deserves to stay in the state it's in forever.
---
You just got BHVRed
---
AFAIK, the stun against Enduring was increased. It's already been nerfed and I've heard of no other change to Enduring since then.
---
Whats wrong with haddonfield? Ive never had problems with it
---
Welcome to dead by daylight, how may I take your order?
---
I always wondered why survivor have such a problem with op add-on.  
---
Like just pick up Franklin's and steal killer's power 👌
---
Id say botany is more of a perk for lower ranks since they're always taking the time to heal before they do anything towards the objective imo
---
killer lunges are normalized. they're all identical in speed and range, except for myers in t1 and t3
---
Well no, with spirit fury you have to decide whether you want to kick pallets for a reward later on or just ignore the pallet to keep chasing. Ruin is a totem perk so yes, there is skill in keeping a totem active and patrolling it. Corrupt intervention gives you an idea where survivors have spawned and allow you to guess where they’re going to go.
---
MoM does nothing in terms of skill. It’s a perk that purely gives you a benefit with literally 0 thought process involved.
---
quality art

Hes being sarcastic

If you say something like “fuck off” people can report it for abusive language, which is pretty dumb in my opinion. Because those People will talk crap about you and then you tell them to piss of and then there like “how could you say that!😢”
---
Imagine those juicy 15fps on Switch
---
Imagine being so trash that you _depend_ on a perk like MoM.
---
Said every Pig main in the last patch. 😞
---
No gotcha moment, just pointing out how current MoM is bad for the health of the game and makes being an efficient killer that spreads pressure a bad thing. Spreading damage isn't smart anymore and it's not exactly a fun meta now.
---
Why get better when you can blame the game?
---
I mean all they did was confirm some stuff about original characters they made.
---
Don’t forget: survivors are the entitled cry babies. 
---
The hardcore killer mains are allowed to complain about something until it is either nerfed into the ground, removed or reworked, but survivors are the entitled cry babies.
---
Lol @ using a “nice guy” meme unironically

---
I've actually played against a nurse who didn't blink on ps4....somehow they killed everybody but me. Can't believe they died to them.
---
Yeah, DBD has a huge presence over there...
---
It needed changing, i think this change gimps it but the perk was broken before
---
I really want this mask as a skin
---
They were saying you cant use tombstone piece with tuft of hair, not tombstone piece with judiths tombstone.
---
Alright I am gonna go cry now
---
5 seconds of ds huh?
---
I mean ehhh... Its only if you tunnel or the survior is Dumbo.
---
But why tho?
---
Yeah, DBD exclusively has players from r/deadbydaylight, right?
---
Yea that’s not true. Now I know you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
The three times I played Huntress I can confirm this is not only true, but extends to the single pixel that is the crap in the middle of the autohaven wreckers map
---
Ok good luck in court with that argument to get your $5 back.  You agreed to the terms of the EULA, which legally states they can change what they want.  Not 1 game in this era stays “as it is”  through the life cycle of the game.
---
Has anyone noticed an increase in NOED btw
---
If you ignore the safe pallet then they will just keep looping around it till you're either bloodlust 2/3 or you kick it. 
---
There is nothing really skillful about sitting around one area.
---
Survivors spawn on the opposite side of the map to the killer almost 90% of the time, so the gens being blocked doesn't serve as much info. You already know that they will be on the other side of the map.
---
If you have spawned in the middle of the map then the gens furthest away will be blocked, it doesn't correlate with survivor spawns tho.
---
Woah dere, this is not me.
---
ARE YOUR SERIOUSLY MESSAGING ME TO TELL ME I'M TOXIC BECAUSE I'M *TRYING*!? LOL FUCK OFF KID.
---
When I said tracking I meant with a survivor you actually intended to down, such as through bloodstains and sound since the audio fx from frenzy make hearing more difficult. While yes, increasing the TR *does* give killer instinct better tracking, it makes the task of getting in the very first hit a lot harder. The TR adjustment also grants more survivors leeway with the bleedout mechanic, seeing as how it doesn't tick down in the TR. This buys the survivor more time and distance from the killer to mend themselves, further decreasing the powers potential for actually completing chases/buying time, (which you have to for the sake of getting the proficency trophy/acheivement.)
---
Thats one of the reasons I put, yes. Its been balanced ever since it came out. So far NOT ONE response to this post has had any reasons explaining why its so unbalanced. All I see is IT NEEDS CHANGED. I’ve made good points, and i’ve seen no good reaponse to those yet.
---
The Hag’s lore made me burst out laughing at work.
---
MFW people are still saying Legion got nerfed. If you think Legion got nerfed you probably used Frank’s Mixtape and moonwalked every game.
---
Yeah but with DS you knew it was only once, and you knew exactly when it was coming, Mettle can get used over and over in the right situation.
---
Hell I even come across Myers with noed
---
Go read all my past posts lol, its prbably all me bitching as a killer main.
---
Yes, Clown is pretty bad. I think even the nerfed Pig can do a better job than Clown, and that says a lot.
---
His power only helps him in chases and is very easily to counter. He needs buffs.

While I like new content, every damn patch they add breaks 30 new things. I wish they would just focus on fixing bugs for like a good while.
---
How long do you think it takes for a solo queued survivor to locate and cleans all the totems? Is 3-5 minutes a fair assessment? People spend 5 minutes looking for a ruin totem alone, so I’d say 5 is on the conservative side. That time that could’ve been used for gens or running the killer around. Yes I do believe it’s a complete waste of time and unrealistic for solo survivors, with no way of communicating to their team, to find and cleanse all 5 totems and still serve a useful purpose to the team. 
---
“Bitch please”
---
Thats nothing i played vs huntress with noed for first time in my 600 hours
---
Almost as bad as cry typing, hnggnng..... the perk..... I paid for..... to abuse..... is.... getting nerfed...... god forbid........
---
yea thats true and your lack of examples just proves you want to provoke
---
Baby Dwight or Baby Meg I believe would be my next targets for survivor. Sometimes the things you see them do are just too adorable. Thanks for the feedback and suggestions. ❤️
---
Seriously. The hype when Ash was leaked was all about him and Ashy Slashy. People were super excited to play as Ash.
---
Corrupt intervention is still a very usable perk and some would consider it a good alternative to Ruin.
---
It's ideal for Hag and Trapper, who want to focus on securing a certain area.
---
Deliverance is incredibly situational, it requires you to get a safe unhook and not to be the first person who gets downed. You can go through the whole game without getting to use it. And even if you have it active, it only saves like 20 seconds for one of the survivors/makes you easy to tunnel.
---
I have yet to see someone using Poised, the perk is so situational that it's not really worth the slot.
---
But MoM won't stays as is because it just get nerfed.
---
Just making a point man. It’s getting reworked because won’t stop crying about it.
---
Wait I remember he has a utube channel
---
&gt; just 1 extra Hit.
---
Four extra hits if the survivors all run it, and it can allow survivors to get out for free. A perk shouldn't allow survivors to get out for free.
---
Hitting the survivors makes you bad at the game, 4head
---
Shhh.. don’t be too loud or BHVR will nerf this.
---
One of Sidney's perks will be "leave no scratch marks for 3/4/5 seconds when running up stairs".
---
(For anyone getting excited, Sidney has not been confirmed as part of the Ghostface DLC.)
---
I hope you're talking about both survivors and killers
---
These are the same devs that have been sitting on their ass on the Freddy rework for nearly 3 years and 6 killers now. What do you expect?
---
We exist.  There are dozens of us.
---
I really wish that ghost face gets that cosmetic someday. 😂😂 it would be great
---
just like noed shouldnt allow Killers to down them for free, right? 
---
Or like BT shouldnt allow them to unhook for free
---
Yeah im a little annoyed at this. They are taking good perks and making them garbage. Looks like just like with DS, MoM is a useless perk too. Glad I bought Ash and all of his perks are garbage now, they might at well remove him from the game imo and refund everyone. What a waste of time
---
Then you must be a rank 21 Killer if you think all MoM does is give Survivors an extra 3 seconds.
---
I think the reason why nurse isn’t picked as much on console is because of the frame rates. But, I enjoy a challenge so I tried her and it’s not so bad, (I might be part of the like, 2.5 nurse mains on console)
---
There's literally no counter to it for the absolute majority of killers, since they are M1 killers, so the only thing you can do about it is hope the survivor doesn't have it and that doesn't sounds precisely like a reasonable solution
---
Yeah, I'd probably sniff her crotch.
---
You do realize more then half of the killers can't counter MoM because they can only m1 and not insta down like hillbilly plus it rewarded wrecklessness and terrible play kinda like  NOED. I feel current MoM discourages diversity because it can't be countered by many killers and encourages wrecklessness. The new MoM rewards team play and makes it so all killer have a chance against it. Those are just my thoughts on it though. Just want to have a reasonable discussion.
---
That's okay, I've run into Hillbillys with NOED.
---
It's unfair because it makes the M1 killers even weaker, while the very strong killers like Nurse or Hillbilly don't have a problem with it. Having to hit someone an extra time is extremely powerful, it's similar to pre nerf decisive strike except all you need to do is get hit a few times, getting hit is bad, you should not be rewarded with an extra hitpoint for being hit a few times.
---
*Base billy is most balanced, his add ons are the problem.
---
head onned
---
It's sad how you have to say who you main in order for people to even consider your opinion, and the people who will scream "you're a survivor main trying to act like a killer" will still say you're a survivor main anyway. Much like old ds, I don't think MoM needs a nerf, an extra hit to down someone is not as bad as people make it out to be. Especially when there's no guarentee the perk will even get used as the survivor doesn't know which killer they're going against before putting the perk on, and perks that bring you from healthy state to dying state still bypass MoM's effects.
---
This isn't a Bee
---
At least you’re admitting that multiple second chance perks on Survivors is just as broken as Nurse.
---
Boo hoo.
---
maybe if struggling worked even in high ping I wouldnt die instantly when I have to.
---
Ok and what about those killers who only have their M1?
---
How do you envision them improving 21:9 support without giving people with 21:9 displays a free Monitor &amp; Abuse?
---
One allows you the location of the survivors being views for a few seconds after hooking one survivor (obsession or not and it’s a good perk) and the other adds an optional objective (destroy the hex) that extends the game and prevents gens from getting done as quick. 
---
Both are good perks, and so was mettle of man.

Nope, he is hot garbage. His power is a smaller speed boost with huge drawbacks.

What the fuck OP? Why you gotta clickbait us?

Nice username by the way
---
That dog looks like Claudet.
---
He's not fast af... he is base speed with a smaller boost than before.
---
Look man, due to how toxic this place is I can’t tell if you are genuinely trolling or playing the “I’m a killer main” card. If you aren’t, then I apologize for being a dick.
---
I’ll use a killer like Freddy, Wraith, clown or doc. They are generally low tier and there is nothing they can do about MoM abilities or not.
---
“Why is Entity.”
---
Devs: “uhh you see we know the answer and we would tell you but we actually don’t know the answer.
---
Any Killer, except maybe for Myers since EW is limited, is powerful on 3 gen strats.
---
Claudette looks like a dog.
---
Not killing survivors makes you bad. If you're getting that many hits without getting any kills, that's on you.
---
You can only grab injured survivors out of windows, you can grab healthy survivors out of generators tho
---
What.....the.......hell is that
---
&gt; Clown lore: John Wayne Gacy but with only the implication of rape.
---
What are they going to do? Say no, of course not. Because of the implication
---
Ok dude... so you dont use bbq, ruin, or nurses? Because if you rely on those perks to win your trash! Stupid right?
---
I run it on low level killers and like Freddy and wraith but like Myers and billy don’t really need it, it’s just overkill
---
Who? SHADBASE
---
&gt;Survivors give up a full Perk Slot for this perk which is only useful for ONE SECOND of the match. 
---
One second lmao
---
Pog!
---
His "rework" killed him and he will remain dead until a proper rework is done (or he is buffed and we will see old legion again). Its impossible to properly balance his power as is.
---
Rank20: I WILL SAVE YOU *proceeds to stand in front of the hook and fumble with the whole process until you get sacrificed*
---
Holy fuck one of these has counterplay the other doesn't can we stop with this fucking nonsense comparison.
---
Long live our saviour mcote
---
Nah, perks are totally random what order they come in. After lvl 25 or30 you will always get 2 perks pr web.
---
Well I highly disagree MoM is 'OP' but let's just say it is, then why does it need to become borderline useless now? So you basically need to get 3 hook saves while the killer is camping and take a hit 3 seperate times. Thats fair s/
---
Sloppy Butcher is one of the few perks that you can put on any Killer and it’ll be at least somewhat effective.
---
Mark my words, after his release someone is gonna post a vid of him and 2 Claudettes t-bagging in the exit gate as a Nea just watches from the entrance.
---
&gt; when MoM stays as is.
---
Aw, you really think it's staying?
---
Which is why I believe that MoM should work like old Dstrike, in that the obsession has the full perk and non obsessions have a weaker version... Would be really cool to see with new Dstrike 'ssession swaps, because hyper coordinated teamplays could still have two or three survs proc mettle in a game while being fair
---
This would at least make him somewhat more usable.
---
You were too efficient. The end game messages mean nothing, especially “Merciless Killer”. In order to rank up, you have to give Survivors a chance.
---
Read ahead, I even said it’s being reworked.
---
down them early and fast. The more altruistic a team is the less they're doing gens if you can keep the pressure on them. I'm not saying you'll avoid MoM altogether, but there's definitely ways to play against it. It's a good perk I won't deny that and you should always be aware of good perks like several other perks in this game. That doesn't make it OP or broken, fact of the matter is if the killer is playing well, then a perk like Mettle shouldn't be an issue, ok it way let a survivor escape from you every now and then, but if you're constantly running into 4 man escapes and no kills because of this perk, lemme just say it has more to do with you as the killer.
---
Idk. "KateAndSpiritMainBigBrain" just doesn't have the same ring to it
---
I'd argue that if a game dev (and an actual gameplay programmer dev, at that) repeatedly(?) goes on record stating something that is in contradiction to the self-reported "empirical data" of a user, it more-so inspires disbelief regarding that data. As McLean himself has mentioned, the user that posted it had no proof whatsoever for its accuracy or even just its authenticity. Further, I don't see why McLean would lie about this - it's not like they haven't on numerous occasions admitted to mistakes they'd made.
---
Releasing the stats on this from their side would still very much be welcome. And stats on all kinds of other things as well, for that matter.
---
I loved it all! Claudette won your affections and you got to take her home to entity-senpai! loved the edit with the clicking intensifies screen shaking &lt;3
---
In response to the cannibal lore summary....isn’t that like an unspoken rule?
---
That's the thing tho, it was a fifteen minute match, everybody got hooked at least twice, plenty of unhooks. IDK, maybe my blood puke game was too strong lol
---
Exactly, I don't understand what is so controversial about this.
---
okay, thats a good point. It punishes the weakest Killers. But you would have to redesign the whole perk to Change that
---
I agree with people who think perk tiers should go and just have them be the max level variant by default. There's just so many perks and characters now that the grind is intense even with double bloodpoints.
---
ye, they get countered
---
Saving this post the next time I see someone bitching about Killers getting "all the breaks" to remind them how the fuck this game used to be.
---
If you think the doctor is anyone but reincarnated revolver ocelot, you're wrong
---
I believe he meant DH as in dead hard. Since the J is next to the H on keyboard.
---
Definitely.
---
Crybabies won, again.
---
myers has simultaneously the smallest and biggest lunge
---
They still haven't seen any adjustments despite being here for longer than MoM?
---
&gt; Balanced is so situational that you can't nerf it without making it useless
---
All you need to do is take away the no fall stagger on all falls except the one that procs the movement speed. You'll fix half of haddonfield, mother's dwelling building for the most part, chapel, etc.
---
You can't mindgame the loops that benefit from balanced landing negating the stagger. Chasing the other survivor isn't the counterplay to the ability, it's completely avoiding interaction with it.
---
Yes dad I'm sorry
---
Yeah, to be honest I think it's gonna end like DS in some way
---
Clown actually can, with the right add ons and some aim. But I agree its Bad that the weakest Killers get countered so hard
---
That makes sense lol Thanks
---
calm down Dude. But they all have counterplay, to some degree
---
tier 1 is a flaccid lunge
---
tier 3 is an E R E C T lunge
---
I love this with al my heart and might just make it my new phone background🌻
---
Tbh I don't agree with this, I don't want to deal with a survivor body... its garbage that it doesn't count for mori or bbq but if you want to straight up buff that make it so disconnects counts as hook/mori w/e. I would be just wasting time carrying around a dc survivor, it would also cause confusion.
---
McLean is a treasure. But it makes sense, base Billy is such a good, balanced kit: he's totally counterable and a skilled player can force M1s, but he punishes bad positioning with an insta-down that requires a little bit of skill to not be juked. 
---
By the way, are you the Jasmine I see in Zubat's chat all the time?
---
Gonna sound stupid but how exactly is it being changed?
---
Hearing his voice when he came back with game reviews was such a nostalgia kick. I'm pretty sure this constitutes as the first let's play to exist.
---
which is actually a pretty sick Combo with MoM. and still my favorite perk :D.
---
So I wouldnt mind making it anti tunnel etc. like DS
---
Hmm Freddy has been out since 2016?! Amazing!
---
I haven’t seen a tier list anywhere, that’s just how I feel about the new Legion after playing him exclusively since the rework. I was Rank 1 before the reset and I’m currently rank 4 and dominating with Legion. IMO, there’s almost debate that Legion is a better Killer than
---
-Freddy
---
-Doctor
---
-Wraith
---
-Trapper
---
-Plague
---
-Leatherface
---
-Pig
---
Myers/Clown is debatable and i haven’t played them enough to make my own opinion. I haven’t seen a new tier list but I was watching OhTofu when he was playing he new Legion and even he said something along the lines of “new Legion is better than most Killers in the game”.  He struggles on some maps for sure and can get worked by a strong Survivor team, but he’s not F tier by any means.
---
Although definitely Bond has uses, it definitely does not use less time for an ally to heal than Botany. You heal by yourself which gives your team time to do gens. 
---
Botany Knowledge cuts down several seconds off healing, especially with Self-care (although I use medkits). So unless one of your teammates is running WMI, it's more time efficient to heal yourself, especially when you bring a kit.
---
A medkit heal will be faster and you don't use anyone else's time. I don't heal teammates if I see they have a medkit unless they request for heals as it's better to focus the gens so it's not two people not doing gens.
---
It really just depends on the playstyle of a player. I don't really like to have teammates go out of their way to heal me or I have to find them. It separates survivors which is a good thing against slugging, A Nurse's Calling, or the killer finding you both in a bad spot. 
---
I have tons of medkits laying in my inventory so it's natural I'd use them with perk that compliments them and saves seconds that build up over a match. I have like 35 brown kits + 58 bandages, 36 yellows, and 58 greens.
---
Considering the lore, I was hoping the map would be inside a dark cave. It would be a mesh of her memories of the Temple where she grew up, and the cave where she died.
---
I thought about the Dungeon map from GunZ — natural cavern walls with detailed manmade structures. The contrast creates an eerie effect. You’re in a natural environment which feels good. But it’s dark, and you have no idea what this temple is for, and you certainly don’t want to find out.
---
Even tunneling the survivor would get them 4 hits, so mettle of man is active. Are you saying I should camp now?
---
The true MVP over here
---
What never been to a rave before?
---
Actually, what if it was like borrowed time but for the unhooking survivor?
---
Spirit Fury still requires you to break 2 pallets and requires a stun. It's easy to play around if you're a survivor and it's only effecient with Enduring. And what second chance does it even give, all it does it make it so you break a pallet for free if you're stunned, that's it.
---
It is a habit, NFL. But some people here just piss me off.
---
In any trial, there are 16 survivor perks in play and only 4 killer perks. Killer perks should be allowed to be more powerful.
---
I’d say that most of the people who downvoted didn’t get the reference either. They just saw that the person had been downvoted some and hopped on the bandwagon.
---
I hate this stupid argument. There is something you can do about it. Hit the survivor again. The counterplay is doing the thing you should be doing the most as a killer. Hitting them. 
---
At least the counterplay for it isn’t having to do something completely off from your objective of hitting and hooking them. 
---
If you get salty because the hit you thought would down them actually gives a boost and lets them get to the open gate. Then go be salty. Go soak up the ocean. That perk situationally hard screwed you. Every player in this game gets hard screwed from a situational perk from time to time. 
---
If it were up to the killers every survivor perk would be super situational and when it perks doesn’t hurt their ego or always available but almost if not completely useless.
---
Yea, it is awesome, and it's so rare for some reason. Especially if killer slugs, you can unhook one person, and pick up sluged person so fast. And if you have few people injured... Well it's also awsome. And it last a while. Combined with bottony it saves you so much time. 
---
My build is well make it, self care, bottony and balanced landing. With a medkit you heal yourself so fast and don't waste 40 seconds in a corner being useless.
---
The user has no reason to lie. BHVR has no reason to either, but has a history of doing so anyway.
---
And yes, there's no reason to hide any of the stats in this game
---
The first TCM is the best one!
---
If you pause just as the video is starting you can see actually the trapper is really close but you distorted the video by putting it in slow motion so it would see as a bad hitbox... anyway this has absolutely nothing to do with hitbox. If you want to see bad hitbox go play as killer and you will see moments where you should not have landed a hit. As the killer is the host you're pretty much fucked by latency and (for this situations) he is not.
---
I-it‘s not like I-I want to t-touch you bakaaaaaaa! ;_;
---
Love the MGS
---
What?
---
#I-it‘s not like I-I want to t-touch you bakaaaaaaa! ;_;
---
Ooookaay
---
I stream sometimes, hardly any viewers though
---
When did I say they should be?
---
Wouldn't that give each Survivor 60 second of flat out immunity after each hook?
---
No point in downing someone if it doesn't take away the timer, since they'll just 95 themselves and someone else will pick them up, and it's not like you can rehook them again anyway.
---
Not being able to slug survivors is exactly how you make it where everyone runs a Mori as often as possible.
---
Hahaha - that seems really dark...
---
Nurse does get fucked by MoM but she is so broken that it doesn't really matter if you can properly play her
---
if the killer is Huntress then CFNM.
---
Word. I used it once to see what it was like, but it felt cheap.
---
Would you be willing the share your template for this meme?
---
The fact that it's only active for about a max of 3 minutes means if it even works at all means it's not op.
---
Good job guys, another useless survivor perk incoming. MoM will be a worse perk then DS is now if this change goes live. DS still has its uses to punish killers that tunnel. This change will make MoM useless. Protection hits are extremely buggy, and unreliable to get. The only way to really get them is to sit under a hook and take hits, but then the killer will just down you 30 seconds later. An extra hit will be worthless if this is how you get stacks now since youll already be hurt when you get your third stack which is basically the same thing as just getting downed from healthy with two hits. 
---
I seriously hope the Devs backtrack on this change and think of a better way to balance the perk, like add exhaustion or something of the sort, not 3 protection hits.
---
His mori is just killing a survivor with a pencil.
---
lol @ saying that someone's triggered because they pointed out that you're being an asshole just for the sake of being an asshole
---
This is terrible logic. 
---
If you are a killer who can’t hit survivors I have bad news. You will be terrible even after they Nerf MoM until no one uses it. The killers sole job is hitting survivors. It is you objective. And let’s be real honest here. It isn’t that hard. It’s so not hard that the people complaining about this perk are doing so because they don’t like that they hit survivors 4 TIMES! And one of them doesn’t count. 
---
Now. You wanna turn it into a MoM + Loops argument. Then the problem isn’t really just with MoM. It’s with loops which have always been a problem in this game. So bringing in loops when we’re talking MoM just makes me want to ignore you. 
---
Now you last point. If we are getting rid of perks that keep the other side from doing there objective at their desire, then A LOT of perks have to go. So I’ll just say that and then be done with it. 
---
Personally I think the best way to tune MoM is to change the way it functions a bit with keeping the effects of the perk the same. 
---
Every time you are hit with a basic attack gain a token. After three tokens, the perk activated and the next hit… blah blah blah. Tokens Reset when put on a hook. 
---
Counterplay is making sure you finish and put on a hook. Synergizes with flip flop. That’s my idea.
---
not a bad thing, similar to the old bt
---
Am I the only one thats a killer main that likes when survivors use MoM? I hate when it's the end of the match and the gates open and then they get away and some other specific situations but mid game if it happens I leave the survivor that had it and go look for others and I'll know where they're now and I'll be able to easily chase after them later. And I don't even have ash so I don't have it for my survivors so I'm not trying to just defend it for them. Just because they can survive one extra hit means nothing in my opinion.
---
Seriously it's not that bad lol.
---
He is too busy building in Fortnite
---
As a Hag you usually don't care about the whole map anyway. Focusing your trappy web on three or four gens at a time is far more effective.
---
Legion can also keep all Survivors injured at once. That’s basically the point of his power. I can’t see how you’d think Plague is A tier but Legion is F tier? If Survivors don’t heal against Legion he’s 115% Killer with NOED for the entire game, if they do heal then his power slows the game down to a crawl and just end up getting hit again anyways. I was a Doctor main before playing the new Legion and I don’t see how you can make an argument that Doc is the better of the two. Legion has some pretty amazing tracking too, maybe not as good as Docs but it’s much more consistent. You can’t go into a locker or use Calm Spirit to hide from  Legion. Good Survivors will get into Madness 1 ASAP which severely limits your tracking. Doc’s tracking is only OP when he has Restraint. Trapper might have slightly better map control but everything else is in Legion’s favor. 
---
His bleedout is fine. It’s like Reverse Bear Traps. You’re not meant to get kills with it but use it as a tool to slow the game and also find any nearby Survivors. New Legion is all about momentum. You need to get 3-4 Survivors injured ASAP and keep the ball rolling from there.
---
not every low Tier Killer just the M1 Killers, except Michael
---
Close app!
---
Intense? Nothing is less intense when I outplay a survivor and they get out for free because of a perk.
---
Fair points. I can see why you say these things but for me flip flop is nothing but a meme perk to be ran in a meme build. Getting slugged doesnt happen often enough to use this perk, and even if i were to be slugged I'd prefer tenacity or unbreakable personally. To me DS isnt worth a slot anymore, even if it has its uses, i often run killers around to long for DS to become a useable perk and with Mom it seems like you need to actively take hits for ppl which isn't worth doing and completely defeats the purpose of MoM. Buckle up is really really bad, as i said slugging isnt super common and seeing the survivors recovery aura/killers aura dont warrant a slot
---
Yeah that's what I had in mind. You could have borrowed time like how ot used to work back then but at the cost of two perk slots
---
Camping lol....ye thats actually true what you said
---
Let’s play some lottery with live as a bet
---
Yeah I mean it's fine because she will probably kill them all before it can even activate.
---
Ok, new question.
---
Say the place where you're at has an AOC of 18.
---
Now you meet two girls.
---
Both are attracted to you.
---
One is 18, the other is 17.
---
Who would you date?
---
I had the same dilemma when I started playing aswell. I went for Legion anyways and I absolutely love them, Spirit will get you way more wins though. And Legion isn't all that bad, I am rank 4 killer exclusively playing Legion only and get atleast 2ks most games without being toxic so if you like Legion go for them.
---
I did, I reset the computer, closed the application. I tried everything
---
Basically every low tier Killer is an M1 Killer. The only modestly high tier killers that are countered by MoM are Spirit and Hag, and they can move around so fast it really doesn't matter to them.
---
MoM needs to have a downside to offset how powerful it is. The problem with the downside now is that survivors can easily just 99% their heal and heal up only when the killer gets close, completely negating the downside of MoM.
---
It was a Freddy and the match was a shitshow
---
Good call though, I prefer the Ocelot meme
---
Huntress fanfiction
---
Basically Overwatch.
---
*whyareyoubooingmeimright.png*
---
I decide on a case by case basis, if I lack some of the meta perks for a killer when I reach 50, I'll just prestige after I have used up all the good addons and offerings.
---
Im a rank 8 killer. Right now I am literally at 8. I see more METAL than anyone... And I play a LOT of wraith, and still fuck up good survivors and activate their MOM early on in the match.
---
Well it's a slippery slope. I think if one or two gens are left and all 4 people are up, no one's hooked, it's not worth healing, unless it's your last hook. But in the start of the game, those 40 seconds can save a lot of time later, if you let's say doing gen with another person, he smacks you and goes after another person, it saves time for other people, who have to go and unhook you + heal you. And of course if you confident in your play, one health state can buy team more than 40 seconds.
---
Almost 69 hours 👏
---
agreed
---
The stagger is still partially there, but it's so short that it actually makes a huge difference.
---
Survivors vault windows faster than killers do, so being able to get to the window faster in a loop which involves falling can give you a ton of distance and can basically go on till the windows get entity blocked.
---
I swear, the salt is real.
---
Its worse when you meme out and nobody cares and your teammates get pissed cause "you didn't help"
---
You don't need to camp. Survivors can't unhook other survivors if they're also on a hook.
---
badly written lore is better than no lore at all imo
---
Why don't they make it so once MoM activates then the killer can Mori the survivor?
---
I’m actually red rank (not back yet due to the reset) and I have played perkless/no add on Freddy throughout all the ranks.
---
WHAT IS ADEPT ???
---
I disagree.
---
The problem with MoM isn't that it doesn't have a downside, the problem is that it completely negates the Killer's ability to actually kill the survivor if it's timed right.
---
You could slap "After MoM activates you're Exhausted for the remainder of the Trial" and it wouldn't change the fact that you can have a survivor down, the doors open up, Adrenaline pops, and they just run away because you tried to slap them down again but they were invulnerable and escaped.
---
The thing about MoM is that it activates late in the trial (unless you're tunneling/the Survivor is just bad) and completely destroys the Killer's momentum, not that the aura reading is bad.
---
AHHH HAHAHAHAHAHA. This made me full on belly laugh at work. Thanks. :D
---
Reddit in a nutshell
---
I did, but now I’m in the game and everyone in my lobbies has 1100 ping when I’m the killer
---
implying discussing lore isnt fun? it doesnt make anyone unhappy, they just need to make good lore lol
---
I doubt you will since neither Behaviour or EAC seems to care but I particularly don't think its worth. Some are harder to see as well... I really like them (along with some custom status icons that popped up here not long ago) but I'm not risking my account, even if its a tiny chance.
---
I suspect interest would dwindle down to unsustainable levels. My group of friends played together a lot before The Plague was introduced, but long queue times and buggy games made us split up and go elsewhere. Want to play with your friends? Wait fifteen minutes for a match and only three load in. Ta da!
---
When she was introduced we came back, but we're tired of the game again and are all in Fortnite or are playing solo killer.
---
Doing content and fixes simultaneously is the only option, I suspect. Content makes up for shitty gameplay. Fixes to the game make individual games enjoyable, even if there's no new content.
---
I like your point comparing Noed and MoM. MoM is like the Noed for Survivors. It gives you a second chance if you’ve failed. 
---
M1 killers can handle 1 extra hit honestly. I play wraith a lot, its not a problem. Just stay on them.
---
*acknowlegs
---
MoM is getting nerfed :D
---
I don't teabag or bring flashlight :( Im trying to survive i dont have time to tbag and I dOnt wanna do it. No need to be toxic but still im getting tunneled.
---
lowkey though, high rank killers on console have a lot more variety than on pc, pc is just nurse nurse nurse billy nurse
---
when did I say they should be as strong as killer perks?
---
That’s true
---
The amount of people being toxic here because they just want it nerfed and have no decent reason why.... 
---
Look at this, TRY playing survivor. Try the perk, and if its so fucking OP, then you should be able to escape with no fucking issue. Go try it.
---
Fuck you
---
Nurse, Spirit &amp; Wraith
---
It becomes a problem when that extra hit takes another 30 to 40 seconds of looping to get. Thats half a gen 3 survivors have had the free time to work on. It has the same issues as the old DS for pretty much the same reasons.
---
It does not take the same amount of time to vault as it does to break it. It takes 1.35 seconds to vault, it takes 2.7 seconds to break a pallet.
---
For me, I've always personally put gameplay and story above all else, even content. That's why I would prefer it, but you're probably right for the overall community.
---
I am trying to hunt some peeps but I am dummy thicc and the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the survivors
---
Honestly, I’d be happy with a four months spent purely on the health of the game
---
Most people have seen it at this point so in a little bit it won’t be an issue any more
---
True but if they are great at loops it's pretty hard to down them. Plus I just feel you should have to work for it instead of being careless and getting rewarded for it. Both NOED and MoM are not good for the game in their current state plus there are perks like adrenaline and blood warden making them insanely stronger.
---
I'll go ahead and ignore the first part and say that I would be very much for an option to just "give up" if you're bleeding out as the last survivor.
---
The hatch closing exists to eliminate the ability for a survivor to take a game hostage by not doing Gens and/or going for a door to open. 
---
A killer can't open a gate unless they are powered. So let's have the scenario where no gens are done, it's a swamp map, thick mist, and a p3 Claudette with Urban Evasion is creeping around  the map, never staying in one tile long enough to get crows.
---
If the killer doesn't have Whispers, they are at the whim of the survivor. And if that Claudette is feeling spiteful, they'll just do this long enough to try and force the killer to quit. 
---
Being able to close the hatch avoids this situation and I guarantee you is why the hatch will now always spawn regardless of Generators completed.
---
The whole ass truth
---
So if I get self care from Claudette, I can use it for other characters, right? Been trying to get it to use for David. So if I manage to get it and not prestige Claudette, would I still keep self care?
---
The issue is that three hits is too many. In most games I find that MoM only pops after the last gen is complete, and I feel like there won't be an opportunity for that to happen unless all the Survivor is doing is following their teammates around instead of doing the objective. Two hits, maybe. Not three.
---
True. I'm mostly saying this because I'm sick of having my experience ruined by certain bugs or watching a killer get destroyed because of matchmaking/underpowered killers
---
I'd date whoever I like the most, however, the chances of me finding a 17 year old attractive is very very slim in the first place, and I would most certainly not date nor lay my hands on them if it is illegal.
---
But that's just a one year difference. No parents would object. I'm sure there are laws protecting those circumstances.
---
Dating a child - a 15 year old - is beyond disgusting, predatory and repulsive. It might be legal some places to have sex with them but, depending on their partners age, it is still disgusting, predatory and repulsive. Laws don't always fit morals.
---
Once you learn a teachable perk, even if you prestige it will still show up for other survivors.
---
That does work but its still a pain in the ass to deal with
---
I didn't say that MoM doesn't have a downside, just that the "downside" can be easily taken out completely.
---
Yeah dude. This community is broken as fuck lol. I wreck MoMs with all kinds of killers, sometimes they escape.. its not a fucking big deal. 
---
The response to this looks like 100% crying killer mains that can’t handle it.
---
Survivor Perk: Blast Off
---
Survivors gain the ability to punt the killer once  per trial
---
"To infinity and beyond!" - Buzz Lightyear
---
Generally, I think the body should persist for _all_ purposes, including survivor mechanics like unhooking. The body would just stand there wounded under the hook as if the player were AFK, but this would also allow survivors to do their business, including WGLF stacks and healing dailies.
---
Obviously there'd need to be a notification, and everyone would know that this is a static target that's probably not safe for survivors to swarm, but it does provide opportunities for folks to use mechanics.
---
Mike would still be able to stalk until done with that character. It would still provide perks (e.g. leader) to nearby survivors. It would get birds. Etc.
---
Wow, that is totally presumptuous of you and the mindset of a toxic Survivor that likely caused them to DC.
---
You're looking at the perk in a vacuum and definitely not considering Rank 1 play where survivors and killer's both have 2k+ hours typically. The only way you're gonna down everyone early and fast with any kind of consistency is if you play Nurse, which is another thing in this game I think breaks the entire gameloop and has no place here. Wraith or Freddy at R1 is gonna struggle against 4 MoM, and they already struggle as it is. 4 MoM perks is the same as downing 2 extra full health survivors, and at R1 where everyone hits Greats and doesn't fuck around Self-Caring in a corner that time is massive.
---
Never even heard of that. No wonder I didn’t get it
---
Then how would you feel if the Killer, after not finding the survivor for a while, had the ability to open a gate to start the timer so that the survivor now has a viable way to escape but is still being pressured to leave?
---
Hm. How though? Hold a button I guess.
---
It's okay, Ghostface will release and be able to rapidly teabag the survivor, which I've been told many times make this type of scenario not toxic. 
---
In all seriousness, your definition of "holding the game hostage" doesn't align with what BHVR actually classifies it as.
---
Clown can be good if the map is very open, he actually benefits from swamp, but otherwise it's very easy to avoid his gas.
---
&gt;then that means the survivor outplayed you
---
Or that survivor was immersed af, which happens. 
---
&gt;and you need ti accept that insttad if whining and crying MOM
---
People don't need to "accept" anything. DS got nerfed, and MoM is going to go the same way.
---
&gt;They deserve to escape if they haven’t been hit 3 times yet, yes.
---
No, no they don't. You deserve to escape if you actually earned it, not just because your perk negated what should have been a down (which means by all rights you lost the chase) and a hook.
---
I wouldn’t have thought to check the blood web after I unlocked it, thanks bro
---
try using steam to verify the integrity of the files
---
Well, it's kinda his built in perk
---
because if the collapse didn't start once the hatch is closed you'd be standing there with the killer for hours
---
The prestige cosmetics is not a normal cosmetic with an accesory (blood) applied, is its own cosmetic
---
Ashy Slashy is best
---
What about when the killer closes the hatch, downs the last survivor, and then just waits out the Endgame timer? That sounds a lot like holding the game hostage.
---
The game just randomly crashes sometimes. At least for me. Could be that. Who can say?
---
i think it's actually a better solution in that it would force players to consider which second-chance perk they'd rather equip, rather than just go with the meta. Dead Hard and MoM is pretty overkill.
---
Is that the same way when you get a character to level 35?
---
No prob fam! It’s only a chance to show up though. So if you have a bunch of teachable perks it may be a while before you find what you want.
---
I don’t run distortion particularly often but if you’re using it just to not be seen you’re using it wrong.  It’s better used as a scouting perk so you know what to look out for.
---
For example, if you’re working on a gen and someone gets hooked on the other side of the map, you know the killer has barbecue.  With that knowledge in hand, you can use lockers to your advantage to try and save your stacks for more situations where you otherwise wouldn’t be able to avoid using one.
---
Another example, if you’re healing/being healed in or close to the killers terror radius and see that you’ve lost a stack, you know they have nurses calling and you should be more careful about when/where you heal.
---
Lol i paid for Ash to play as Ash
---
Did he seriously use tape for that mic?
---
I wrote a response about this change not being good and I’m curious as to what killers would think about it. 
---
&gt;Protection hits are buggy. Sometimes they don’t register even if you’re standing in front of multiple survivors.
---
&gt;Although it’s a good direction, they might want to consider adding another category to build stacks like “Distraction”. It still has the same concept as building stacks by protecting other survivors, but you have additional options that won’t shift gameplay in a negative way (IE. survivors running in front of killers just to get a stack).
---
&gt;Another idea is to make MoM stack faster. A “Protection” hit could grant double stacks of MoM. This would allow killers to get rid of MoM quicker and spend fewer M1 hits to do so. Fewer M1 hits = less speed boosts and shorter chases. If MoM is proc’d in the early to mid game, then it will be harder to heal up and escape because of the aura reveal.
---
&gt;MoM should be a perk that allows you to take a hit, at the risk of remaining injured for the rest of the game because healing will reveal you permanently.
---
&gt;Currently, MoM is being built up in the early and mid game, and proc’d in the late game making the aura reveal a laughable consequence. The aura reveal needs to come into play more to balance MoM.
---
Let me know if it addresses any of your gameplay issues, or if you have any suggestions.
---
Welcome to the club, my dude! You did awesome!
---
enduring never actually reduced stun time 75 percent, 2.1 seconds to 1.14 seconds isn't a 75 percent reduction im pretty sure, so are they just changing the description to match the reality? you know, I kind of wish they truly reduced it by 75 percent instead of this, it would make up for enduring no longer effecting non pallet stuns.
---
Thats the entire point of fucking hex perks existing and why they aded them was to slow the game down and waste survivors time.
---
Well if you already have them in the deep wounds status yes it is better to break it. You're not supposed to finish chases using the frenzy, you use it to injure them easily with the first hit and then chase them normally for the last one
---
I mean
---
If you lost, they should win with more grace.
---
If you won, they don't really have a leg to stand on.
---
This is so cool!
---
Sure. Bind it to LCTRL so that you don't accidentally hit it.
---
They said it was an idea not that it will be that
---
you're a little special guy aren't you?
---
doing gens and looping the killer is toxic. you're supposed to let them kill you. 
---
and as killer hooking someone more than 2 times and existing is toxic
---
I play on console. So I guess... hold A. Or hold something on the d-pad.
---
You said that if survivors shouldn't have multiple second chance perks killers shouldn't have powerful perks to cut chase. Thats ocmparing them as equal.
---

It not meg without frown brow
---
... Death is *not* an escape.
---
As survivor I think these changes are making it next to useless. I only needed for camping killers and hard tunnelers. Basically unfair situations. As killer MoM never really bothered me much. People say 1 extra hit is all the difference but it's really not unless its end game. I think the change is kind of redundant on both sides. We dont need a nerf. If they want to rebalance it so it's fair for both sides then okay I guess.
---
whats with this community and drag queens
---
As someone who runs 'Enduring + Spirit Fury' quite regularly on Myers, I actually like this change.
---
I barely ever see DS anymore anyways.
---

Thats not proof that its in the next chapter patch
---
You get 3 ? Protection hits? If its 3 and not one then it's not that bad. 1 protection hit per match is useless though.
---
how dumb are you this perk is worse then DS when it came it all it dose is it punished me for just landing an M1 wow so much counter play its worse when the survivors are running op shit like iron works window or grim pantry window you must not play killer alot because MoM is a huge problem because as an m1 killer u have no counter play and bbq is not the same because bbq is only good for people who leave hooks and playing well as a killer and has counters for survivors in divergence and lockers and geting close to the hook or even hiding behind gens MoM has no counter if you have nothing but m1 like wrath or myers
---
See I have bad matches too with idiot randoms, but calling it unrealistic would be a reach

This is like the backstory to a killer

We can call them "The Salt" lol

Claudette imo
---
Not all theatre folk have mental illnesses, dear. Though, it helps. #deadbydaylightisqueer
---
It's a mix of things I'd say. Despite this seemingly recent resurgence in people saying freddy is underrated, many still see him as one of, if not the weakest killer, due to his power providing almost nothin chase, and some of the most meta perks countering his power. Additionally, Freddy is incredibly unfun to play against. I feel this is why they resorted to a full rework rather then simple number changes
---
Theirs a noise notifaction when they intentionally dc,  but if their is no noise notifaction, that means it wasn't intentional
---
If killers can have Noed, then survivors can have MoM. If they change it, I expect a TON of people to get refunds and never buy DLC again. 
---
Its all up to the DEVS to make the right choice. I can’t expect everyone here to share my decent opinion on this cause most are probably entitled cunts that think they deserve 4 Kills every single match.
---
wait really? is this for both survivors and killers?
---
