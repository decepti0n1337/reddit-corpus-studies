I honestly just hate how some of these challanges are forging you to be a cunt to get it done.

Imagine being a degenerate and not being able to talk

This post was made by almost everyone gang
---
I don't think it would be that bad as mobile and switch run at a good speed where it's about the same as PC is right now
---
As sad as that is to hear at least he's not ruining the game on PC anymore. PC is the biggest playerbase and while my heart goes out to the console players "the biggest cunt in the universe" is just one problem you guys are going to have to deal with, along with "console turning into a jet engine" and "crashing whenever you breathe."
---
Yeah, someone fucked up.
---
The three blendettes meeting up while I‚Äôm on hook
---
It's a nice doodle, nice job.
---
Photoshop? More like MS Paint
---
It‚Äôs pretty hard to argue considering there are so many components in place. You would have to determine if we are taking perks, offerings, survive with friends and maps into consideration and which killers we are looking at, and most importantly, what contributes as a win before you start arguing this. 
---
The game is generally survivor sided if all the survivors are very good at the game and the killer isn‚Äôt using anything special. But this is rarely the case. I‚Äôve never run into an unbeatable squad (I play on ps4 though). 
---
If the survivors and the killer aren‚Äôt that good, then solo survivors are definitely the weakest role in the game in my opinion, and if I recall correctly, most players played as solo according to BHVR‚Äôs stats.
---
he explained it better than i ever could
---
Yeah I‚Äôm never going to do it again next time I will be so fucking toxic
---
The better you are the better you can deal with good survivors.
---
Shut up Meg!
---
Bubba with PWYF as well
---
basement bubba gg ez my man
---
And even if you run the ultra rare add-on, blood is already brighter while phasing anyways.
---
Im in purple ranks where every god damn team has mics and get 2 gens done in 30 fu king seconds and avoids the basement like the god damn plague
---
I‚Äôm a simple man. I see HunterxHunter I up vote.
---
I do agree bone clapper 10-12 is a bit much, I couldn‚Äôt think of a decent replacement for it was kinda thinking on the spot.
---
Pig however even if they re-buffed combat straps I‚Äôd be happy with that
---
Nice! ya I've been doing the nemesis/pwyf combo on Legion. Works great. Seems like it would be really good on LF
---
If you were infinite EW1 then you got lucky and had the perfect counter to OoO which is the undetectable status.
---
Pig Ghostface and EW1 Myers all have the undetectable status effect and they can see the survivor who's using OoO but the survivor can't see the killer while they have that effect. 
---
Undetectable status is ridiculously good, I remember going for adept Laurie and I ran into pre-rework Fredward and it was terrible because I  couldn't see his aura even though he could see mine.
---
Basement bubba only works if the survivors are brain dead. Once they realize you‚Äôre camping near the basement with insidious, your whole build is ruined
---
Well put.
---
damn
---
Chased the first survivor I found around and around the same pallet for two minutes or more earlier to get my 90s chase with Distressing challenge done. Blood lust 3 is super speedy. 
---
Another survivor had the audacity to teabag at the exit gate as if I'd been playing with a mite of sincerity.
---
Call xbox if they ban you. You have screenshots of the convo.
---
Used in a team on coms, Object is devastating.
---
yeah i suppose, only other thing i can think of is use a small map offering, then do slug billy or bubba with enduring agitation
---
Make it at least 2 in the basement that shits do able but 4 in single trial i almost had then 2 people dc cucking me over
---
That's on you m8, it came out in October.
---
oh yeah i would imagine dcs all day, but hey dc punishment coming soon
---
Myers can use Nemesis pretty well since one of his add-ons makes stalking his obsession really fast. Plus the oblivious is really nice when you have a huge TR. Can also combo well into Dark Devotion. Get stunned by obsession, slug him and hunt for other survivors while undetectable in T3.
---
Yeah I have more fun as killer too because at least you won't die on your first hook. Heck you won't die at all.
---
F tho
---
Leorio approves this message
---
Myers with Judith's Journal and PWYF. He gets stunned and can stalk and lose chase for the speed. Tier 3 and faster speed.
---
Nice! I forgot about that Addon! that's sweet. thanks
---
I don't disagree, but the map is really small which favors the killer.
---
Lot of safe pallets though
---
That was my first thought too! Not sure if Fredster is still invisible while carrying survivors though.
---
ok boomer. now shut up girl. Im not here to do what you want or not. To me youre just a random bot with a stupid nickname. Hope one day I dc in your face after burning a escape cake.
---
When does DBP start? I haven‚Äôt seen anything on it
---
Bubba mains are actual sociopaths.
---
What is up with that rank 17 in there? Good matchmaking I would say
---
So, are survivors not supposed to open chests?
---
But my problem isn't with good survivors, or winning for that matter. SWF is unfun. Extra BP will make me have more fun in other games.
---
I'm long past the point of caring about winning in this game.
---
*dramatic music playing* Thrill of the hunt
---
How is extra BP worthless? And if you do not care about it, what harm is brought to you by it's implementation?
---
Buuh fucking huuh. You act like this happens with any sort of regularity. I have had a survivor game that I had to leave because of those kinds of reasons excatly never. At that point you just take the dc and report him.
---
Unless you are a massive cunt the very design of the system prevents it from affecting anybody who doesn't deserve it outside of massive statistical flukes. How is this literally any different from getting a 30 minute penalty every other month in CS:GO because the enemy has a spinbot or because your teammates are non stop griefing.
---
This is like crying about getting a parking ticket because you had a very good reason to park there. So fucking what. The rules are for everybody and just because it MIGHT have been not justified for you doesn't mean it isn't justified to just apply blanket rules agains parking violations. If your reason is so good, the fine just becomes a payment for what you did.
---
If you don't think you can spare five minutes of play every so often because it helps everybody else, I am sorry to tell you that you are an inconsiderate asshole.
---
Because guess what? I have never had a survivor game like the one you described but I have a DC to deny me points, stacks or pips in about ever tenth killer game.
---
Chad Billy vs Basement Dweller Bubba
---
Cool, thanks! I just liked your method better. =)
---
ü•∫
---
Ace
---
Honestly - I appreciate that. When I used ttv in my name I'd get the occasional killer who'd tell me that - I'd thank them and I'd requeue. 
---
One of the best parts of this game that people forget is the atmosphere - you get into a mindset - you stress, you get anxious - you embrace the fear of being hunted by a killer with supernatural powers.  "oh its just memes" ruins the mindset.
---
I JUST BOUGHT THE BASE GAME YESTERDAY AND ITS FUN AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM DOING  
---
ALSO KILLER QUEUES AT RANK 20 SUCKS BALLS
---
Oh, I had no idea "the killer wants to farm" means I must want to farm too.  Get fucked and go play the game, for real this time. Actually play it.
---
I have DBD on steam, xbox and switch (yup, even resorted to that).
---
Than*
---
DBD IS IN A HORRIBLE STATE AND NOT ONLY WONT WE GET AN XMAS EVENT, QUEUES ARE BUGGED WITH FILES GETTING CORRUPTED EVERY DAY, ARCHIVES CHALLENGES ARE DUMB AS SHIT, I WISH THE DBD DEVS CARED MORE BUT THEY DONT LOL GLAD WE GET NEW COSMETICS INSTEAD OF BUG FIXES EVERY 2 WEEKS THOUGH, LOVE IT
---
I feel like survivor mains allow themselves to be toxic and play the game like assholes. If a killer is toxic or just plays to win, it's not okay in their eyes.
---
I agree. I'm not buying the next rift until the DCing is properly addressed (Even with timeouts people still DC. Add DC husks so even if they quit I can still slam their DC'd body onto the basement hook and get my progress done) and the challenges don't require the stars to align.
---
its easier injured or using stake out so good skillchecks counts as greats
---
Wait... Bubba‚Äôs chainsaw can down people? Shit Here I am red rank and my saw seem allergic to survivors!
---
You guys are too kind, but I hope other creators that are way more wholesome than me such as Paulie Esther, StreamDad\_ and such also get recognition.
---
Imagine having to give up chases at Infinites
---
^(This Comment was written by the Trapper Gang)
---
I guess for "playing like a pos".
---
I couldn't imagine playing lobby simulator for 5 minutes only to hook suicide, but I understand your frustration.
---
Right on point in my opinion.
---
How the fuck did you get 6 feet under done
---
In my dictionary, pos means person of success :)
---
Damn that guys sweat is like the damn dead sea, too salty for any life to prosper
---
Smexy
---
I just got dced as the survivor, while the killer was doing 6 for under on me before, I was the last person he needed. I hope bhvr implements something to negate this, I feel really bad for that trapper and he deserved to get his challenge, just as you deserved to get yours done.
---
Can someone explain what being ‚Äúthe obsession‚Äù means. I‚Äôm new to the game
---
Strange that someone crouching can anger people that badly but my point was camping them isn't showing them that you don't suck, you're kinda just proving that you do suck because you had to resort to camping them, all camping does is tell the survivor that they outplayed you
---
Such a humble gentleman, love you man &lt;3
---
Why t1 haunted grounds?
---
I dont camp all the time. Just the serious assholes. And I always leave the 3rd guy down til I find hatch.
---
How nice of them!
---
Yikes, getting angry and downvoting...exactly what I said you were doing in my previous comment. Congrats, you need therapy.
---
Not angry just telling you straight. Grow up kid
---
Boop.
---
was that the bite of 87?????
---
I see what you're saying. I do try and let them unhook em and injure everyone tho
---
I did enjoy my 130,000 bloodpoints though ngl
---
People like that total asshat are the reason I have messages on my PS4 set to ‚ÄòFriends Only‚Äô. Some people seriously need professional help.
---
Sweetheart, you need to calm down. Let's use our big girl voice and talk like adults, okay? You can cry in your journal later, but right now the world needs you to grow up and stop being a little baby. Thanks!
---
"I am displaying a live feed of my game for the world to see, and my opponents are using it to their advantage?? How shocking and unpredictable, what an outrage!"
---
This is the most chaotic comment on reddit I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Ahoy! Steve main here always ready to lead us to victory!
---
Lol. Seriously though, as a Steve main I agree.
---
Fear the stabby stab and don't expect mercy
---
Why y‚Äôall mad
---
OP where did you open these models? What program?
---
Yup now you‚Äôre trolling because you know you made yourself look like an idiot. Go bother someone else bud
---
I feel like so many killers let me go out of pity and I don't even play Dwight q.q
---
dark sense, detectives hunch , dead hard, adrenaline.
---
i ended up actually liking the build, id be using it on tapp from now.
---
steve, adam &amp; dwight get the hatch always.
---
Whys his height got anything to do with his personality?
---
Nothing will happen. Even if they did 'report' you, so long as you haven't done anything nothing will happen. This is just an insecure survivor trying to get into your head. 
---
If they're still messaging you, you can try and bait a cuss word for a fun temp ban. Personally I'd just block em and move on.
---
Sad that we live in a world where people can‚Äôt control themselves?? Lmao
---
Yeah what an outrage that people want to have fun
---
And yet you continue to do it.
---
Shhhh, inside voice. If you can't talk like an adult, you'll be treated like a kid for the rest of your life. Calm down your anger, relax, and talk like a grown adult. Or else people will continue to walk all over you your entire life, like I am now.
---
Idk how to ask my brain that
---
How retarded can you be to not run a double experience event during the holiday weeks like the 21st - 31st? 4 days for a currency that doesn't even exist as a currency is so fucking stupid it makes me not even care compared to other games I play who will be doing it longer, makes me want to play that instead of DBD for this very reason...
---
Supposedly Nemesis can be combo'd with Furtive Chase and Make Your Choice. You hook your obsession (Maybe they're the OG obsession, or someone else stuns you and becomes your obsession, and you down and hook them.) and whoever rescues them becomes the new obsession.
---
Now the guy who rescued you is exposed, oblivious, and has his aura revealed to you for 4 seconds. On someone who can close distance rapidly (Billy, Windstorm Wraith, etc.) this can be brutal as you can cause a nearly endless cycle of insta-downs.
---
You don't look dumb enough to be a meghead.
---
Everyone is. Blood points. What's your damage?
---
Easy double stack to be honest
---
I go to the closest hook and shake a couple of times if they keep wiggling I just toss em on top
---
Omg yesssss girl looks so good
---
No damage. It was just interesting you said It sucks and still do it. Most people don‚Äôt do something when they know it sucks for others. Most people.
---
sometimes you just mindlessly chase when you get close to downing them but they keep just barely getting away.
---
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO PLAY KILLER LITERALLY GET CLAPPED EVERYTIME EVEN WHEN I HAVE LEVEL 3 RUIN ON THEY STILL FLY THROUGH THE GENS.
---
You can still unhook in t3

Nemesis works best with killers that have insta downs like Leatherface or plague.
---
how is this quality content? you took a stock image and pasted it next to a picture of kate
---
Why does this reminds me of Friday the 13th
---
It was confirmed for January 2nd last stream
---
I'll be honest. I enjoy repairing generators on the edge, to a point. I always do my best to prevent a 3 gen, so first chance I get to do a middle gen, safely, I do. However, there are times where the middle gen is incredibly unsafe or safe, which if it's safe, I leave it be. But even still, it's hard to have a cut and dry flowchart, with two options.
---
S- Wraith, Hag, Legion (Joey), Bubba (Smartface), Doctor
---
C- Demogorgon (Is white, but lives in the upside-down where everything is the reverse of what it is in our dimension so technically it can say the n-word while it is going through a portal)
---
F- Everyone else
---
Sadly I don‚Äôt believe so. It‚Äôs supposed to be the battle pass except for a better game, so it has to end. I suggest grinding the challenges whole you can
---
I hate that I know exactly what he said without the audio
---
The makeup is very accurate to Meg. Good job
---
Bill is a Vietnam veteran, I'm not sure every soldier in Vietnam back then had a medkit like that
---
really depends, Long walls can either mean the jungle gym with a window Vault on the long wall, or the single pallet C shaped tile.
---
I have the bad luck to hit them just as they activate it, slowing me down while they zoom
---
The username brings it all together.
---
Oh sorry, are you saying Nemesis/PWYF work great on *Bubba*? 
---
They both just so happen to be perks people thought were going to bring back "Old" Legion but never made it out the PTB so I misunderstood
---
Meh. Just follow an injured survivor around until you get em.
---
The issue is more that BHVR doesn't ban this behavior from the player base. This behavior has been going on for so long that many people think it's acceptable.
---
The challenge design is fine.
---
Seriously, wtf is up with of Meg?
---
Holy fuck this is based
---
Thanks for the input everyone! I managed to get it done like 15 minutes after posting this
---
If you‚Äôre doing LSD maybe
---
I‚Äôll give him the benefit of the doubt and say he‚Äôs doing the 4k in the basement challenge
---
Took me a while to realize is was the other girl's arm. If they had the same skin tone I never would have noticed it was the friend's arm.
---
Someone else posted a video of ds not working against a ghostface
---
Big props, solid meme. Love the inclusion of borrowes time haha
---
I've never seen this most of the time they just say "thx" and leave
---
Are you?
---
But muh wahmen!
---
You know killers can play the game how they want? I would only hate killer if he really tryhards after one survivor dcs but otherwise, no, play how you want
---
It goes both ways.  They need to take the initial hit, then you need to lure the killer away from them, maybe even go down for them.  especially if they're on last hook.
---
Its a garbage algorithm which is even worse than RNG.
---
Okay, i expected everything BUT that
---
Except they don't. And you've got absolutely nothing that proves your point.
---
You don't see hundreds of killers on /new every day complaining about low-rank queue times. You don't see BHVR actively adjusting their matchmaking system to match low-rank killers with mid- to high-rank survivors to alleviate queue times.
---
You do see hundreds of posts of survivors complaining about queue times in /new. BHVR literally adjusted their matchmaking system to match low-rank survivors with mid- to high-rank killers to alleviate queue times.
---
Killers don't have issues with queue times because there are less killers playing.
---
We just took a whole bottle of pills and we were fine!
---
Scratch marks, Blood, and audio cues.
---
Why doesn't Second Wind work with medkits you think? It's already kind of a lackluster perk that nearly forces you to run something that will combo with it, why make it even weaker?
---
Imagine having to pickup your traps this post was made by the hag gang
---
Imagine going more than 10 feet away from a hooked person, bubba mains can‚Äôt
---
Whispers has a lot more utility imo.
---
Oh no yeah one shot down killers I should have specified.
---
I'm a survivor main and I hate going against basement trapper, so I felt like a dick when I had to play like that for the dumb challenges
---
Exactly why this meme makes literally no sense
---
ok boomer
---
I managed to repair all 5 gens somehow thx to my potato team i guess it was one of those lucky games...
---
Try the default shirt with his shorts
---
It's brilliantly cursed :^)
---
&gt;Why survivors shouldn't be upset when they're picked up by the killer?
---
Thanks, I'll post it there too.
---
Why is meg built like a crayon in this
---
[removed]
---
It definitely means "only this console gets it" is invalid.  It's a completely different experience on switch - actually feels like it did in 2017 when the game was new and people actually played it.
---
Imagine having to place traps, this post was made by ghostface gang
---
&gt;You act like this happens with any sort of regularity.
---
It's just an example, I didn't say it's the only reason one would DC. 
---
&gt;the system prevents it from affecting anybody who doesn't deserve it outside of massive statistical flukes.
---
Just today I had a total of 4 people DC-ing because of in-game bugs that got them stuck in objects and 3 that were infinite load screen crash related. This game is too buggy to have this kind of a punishment for leaving, many times you'll be punished for something that wasn't your fault.
---
&gt; How is this literally any different from getting a 30 minute penalty every other month in CS:GO because the enemy has a spinbot
---
You get bugs and things like hostage doc way more than once a month, how's that for a difference? Are you even playing the same game?
---
I hate that map. Takes me half a year to find a gen let alone another person
---
This made me laugh. Idk what it is, but Ive played enough to P3 most killers and I STILL cant help but giggle whenever someone is really struggling with madness effects xD
---
I really hope they tone this challenge down omg
---
I‚Äôm not a new player but honestly I could use this üòÇplease make it more detailed
---
This is the 3rd time tho. 1 was against a nurse, other a gf. The first two I assumed were because there wasn‚Äôt rnough room where I was.  But in the middle of the shack, I still didn‚Äôt hit it
---
Whispers it lets you find people easily
---
What perk pack is that anyways, I kinda want to get them myself.
---
The closest thing to an anti-sabotage is Hangman's Trick, but that only respawns the hook after 30 seconds.
---
I run Dweet all the time, any time there is another in the lobby I spend all game yellnig and talking about my brothers lol
---
Fuck the casuals. Got it. Carry on then.
---
damn, huntress got a nice rack
---
Imagine having to put in effort to win. This post was made by the survivor gang
---
It‚Äôs been broken for me too, that or I‚Äôm just really shit at hitting the skill check lately.
---
I actually hear it confirm with the yes you got it noise.
---
I dont speak japanese and used translate haha my bad
---
There's enough time for them to just run back to it. The stun time is just enough for even if you walk in a straight line away from the locker, if they wiggle they can get back to it.
---
Can't have that problem if you're like me and are stuck in Tier 1 still. (Seriously, I am NOT using Trapper and Agitation when I can play worse killers like...Legion.)
---
"Of course she deserved it, look how she's dressed!"
---
Ikr lmao, I do that with his big coat sometimes. 
---
My go-to rn is his sweater, the pants that go with the coat, and the robot hand.
---
I'm on that now. Entity have mercy in my huntress's soul
---
Honestly ranges from 2-3mins to 15 mins or longer where I just call it a night haha
---
Thank you ill use that next time when I draw Spirit! I dont speak japanese so I appreciate it
---
to be 100% honest, the first 20 seconds i also couldn¬¥t help but laugh at his misery, but then i stopped seeing Bill and instead saw a probably fresh out of the Tutorial Player. Then i just felt bad.
---
You can complete the Tome challenges whenever, they‚Äôll stay open forever. The Rift on the other hand will close I think it was the 8th of January, so any cosmetics or charms you haven‚Äôt earned at that point will be gone.
---
dwight without glasses is very cursed
---
Oh dang son umm yeah it was üòÇ
---
Idk, good lore hunting though. Impressive
---
Of ribs?
---
It kills chat interaction though
---
 I didn‚Äôt buy it because the rewards are garbage. Why are there no iridescent shards in there? Why is it overloaded with charms? Literally the only ultra rare item is a charm that I‚Äôll barely notice when playing. Them giving you the AC back to buy the next one is pretty standard ime so they don‚Äôt get credit for that. 
---
I was more interested in the free pass rewards because that gave you the serums. Crap pass overall imo
---
Not gonna lie I really miss facing the Nurse.. The nerf could've definitely been handled better than this.
---
Yeah, now that I think about it, the hooks are pretty dense. It may be because they‚Äôre all easily accessible due to the hallways being easily navigated
---
Wade plays DbD on his channel I think!
---
I mean, that's literally it. What other advice do you want?
---
Yeah if its lower ranks its not as funny, but I play in red ranks and even the higher ranked survivors will run around screaming all game sometimes. Doctor imo is the funnest killer to play with if you're okay with a 20 minute match
---
Boamrnalalkkk
---
See true talents games
---
Think he has like 7 videos out there of him and his friends but that's about it
---
I like his videos
---
BBQ definitely
---
 
---
**Trapper:50 /100-** He is a force to be wary of as the game progresses, particularly in lower ranks, but as of now, he isn't the best in the red ranks, as he his method of setting traps is not up to par compared to other trap-based killers
---
**Wraith:65 /100**\- I used to main wraith, and as i progressed through the ranks, i've noticed that he just cant keep up. He can become faster via cloaking, but uncloaking takes time- time that a survivor can use to find an escape route.
---
**Hillbilly: 95/100-** Being able to control your speed ability, as well as an instadown ability, is incredibly useful, as most killers have only one or the other. 
---
**Nurse: 90/100 -** Being able to easily circumvent loops, particularly ones that other killers would consider infinites, is a huge bonus, but should a survivor make it to an area where line of sight is negated, she can be juked and tricked. 
---
**Hag: 85/100-** An underrated killer, as she can teleport a fair distance once her traps trigger. The only way to avoid traps are to crawl past, and lowering a survivors speed is crucial in a game like this. The fact that her traps always face the direction a survivor went once triggered is great information as well. Her trap setting is also quick enough to close plenty of loops
---
**Doctor: 70/100-** Don't get me wrong, he can cut loops shorter than they normally would be with his shock, and his madness gives him a decent deal of info on survivors. It's just, at the end of the day, he is still an m1 killer- one that relies on his m1 attack to down survivors, a mode that takes time to switch to, and his Treatment mode slows him down, which is also not great. 
---
**Myers: 60/100-** Having an instadown that you can use to chain on other survivors and can decently control is a good plus, and his tier 1 having a tiny tr is also good, but same with Doctor- he relies on m1 to down. Nothing to close distance, nothing to slow down if you don't bring Ruin
---
**Huntress: 80/100 -** Being able to down survivors from a distance, particularly on short loops or loops with short walls, is very good. However, she has no information abilities outside of perks, and she is slower than other killers, along Hag. I believe she is only as good as the map she's on
---
**Leatherface: 70/100** \- Great for facecamping, but not much else. To use his instadown, he has to be very close to a survivor, which requires distance- distance that good survivors can easily close. 
---
**Freddy:90 /100-** Making survivors doubt which areas are safe can easily zone them to more favorable territory, particularly with fake pallets. Another killer that get's more dangerous the longer a game lasts.
---
**Pig:80/100-** She can close short loops, sneak up on survivors and not give them the chance to run somewhere safer,  distract survivors with her traps, keep tabs on them. Combining certain perk combos, like Spirit Fury and Enduring, can make her dash on loops even more tedious for survivors. It's the fact that she's slower than a running survivor once crouched that lowers her viability, particularly in this game, where the "meta killers" are often the ones that can go to different places fast.  
---
**Clown: 60/100-** Being able to shorten loops is pretty decent, but still an m1 killer. If a survivor is in a safe place with long loops, he may suffer. He has decent information with his bottles, but by the time he's in range to throw them, the survivors will already know he's on his way
---
**Spirit: 89/100-** Although very powerful with her ability, particularly with aura reading perks like Iron Maiden and BBQ, the recent nerfs are a very harsh blow. Though she can still close loops insanely fast, she has to guess even more where exactly the survivors are with no more collision. 
---
**Legion: 85/100-** Depending on the team's altruism. you may have very easy games, as you can stall for plenty of time with your ability, especially with healing-punishing perks, such as Nurse's, Sloppy, and/or Thanatophobia, though he is also an m1 killer.
---
**Plague: 87/100-** Though she doesn't have any travelling abilities, other than PWYF, she can wither down a team one by one, especially should she start with an apple, which isn't hard considering they spawn in yellow rarity last time i checked. Based on the survivors decisions, she can capitalize off them in plenty of ways.
---
**Ghostface: 80/100-** Though True really does bring the best out of him, he can easily get 0k'ed. Again, he's a killer like Huntress- he's only as good as the map he's one. Dark maps with high walls are his forte, but maps with low walls, especially open, wide maps, can be his downfall, though, being able to also gain access to an instadown is great. 
---
**Demogorgon:85/100-** What can't you do with Demogorgon? He can teleport to the other side of the map with unlimited range, his traps stay invisible until he allows them to be visible, and once revealed, they can give information on what a survivor's doing near them, and be stealthy once popping out of his trap. He can also cut down short loops very easily, particularly in the shack, which many survivors consider a very safe mind-game area. The one thing he can't do is instadown, which can bring him down if he doesn't capitalize any Exposing perks, particularly MyC, or Devour Hope.
---
**Oni: 90/100-** Being able to punish survivors for being injured like Legion, able to travel quickly and use it as an instadown like Billy. Extremely rewarding should you play optimally and keep survivors injured. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm open to criticism!! Tell me what you think!
---
Honestly I would do it as Killer, someone like Legion can easily achieve Iridecent in Malicious and Chaser (because mending doesn't get subtracted from Malicious and you're power is able to easily find and hit Survivors counting as a Chase for every hit)
---
I know you said Survivor, but Legion can easily cheese the emblem system if you use nothing but Frenzy and just stab everyone a million times and you're sure to get at least 2 iri emblems even if all 4 survivors escape.

Ayy that was me

[The toxic survivor theme song](https://youtu.be/8KANoVk5CgQ)
---
*loses 2 gens as a result*
---
"Toxic gen rushers"
---
It'd be so cool if there was something like a replay feature added to see the game from everyone's POV
---
The lack of obstacles for the killer to get temporarily trapped against while they struggle also makes L√©ry‚Äôs map impossible to wiggle out on. Hawkins is a little better for that, but still terrible.
---
Why do I like this
---
You can say I "grew up" in twitch watching streamers cover their screens while picking perks or changing names every other games because of stream snipers and I thought that was normal, and it seemed logical to me that the streamers go through the trouble just to protect their games. I found everything seemed reasonable and somehow it still is until I watched Otz.  
---
Whenever someone on chat ask him "why don't you just cover your perks?" or "hide your lobby" etc,   
---
he just says(get this), "No no, no one here will streamsnipe me" and laugh.  
---
At first I didn't get it, specially when he gets obviously sniped but after time I realized, he just trust his chat completely. Everyone. Even the trolls. Something I didn't quite understand was possible until I watched Otz. He doesn't see chat as just chat, he sees them as his friends. In that case, Why would you get upset with a friend with such insignificant thing such as streamsniping?  
---
Holy shit is this dude good.
---
you throw the pallet
---
Oh ok thanks
---
you don't need exhaustion perks to loop...

Devs had stated that cosmetics from rift will eventually be released into the store probably by next year but other than that no

Gg ez

Doc giggles
---
I do
---
blender
---
ye i feel you its SUPER hard and honestly RNG i.e. hatch game, DC etc.
---
I got it after about 8 tries ish and got super lucky or just big brained the game,
---
i played trapper with Agitation, Iron Grip, Make Your Choice, Corrupt Intervention and spawned on Sanctum of Wrath,
---
Basement spawned in the centre and so i trapped various drops, pallets around it and basically ignored gens until i fully prepared my area. I then tried to chase the survivor into the the middle and got them into the basement. 
---
Then hovered around waiting for the unhook to down the rescuer and unhooked ( Nea and Yui) and as i was taking her (Nea)  back to the basement the claudette vaulted a high window and fell into a trap so i downed her on the way, the bill stepped on another trap running to the claudette so now all four were downed and i just had to hook them.
---
Even with this it is still super hard as i had to hope they didn't DC and the timing on the traps had to be just right for me to snowball around the basement and get them all there.
---
If it helps some tips are go on a map with a centralised basement, prepare around the basement so its hard to escape without stepping on a trap and keep your traps close to you and to each other so you can capitalise on them when it matters to get it
---
But ye i totally feel its a bit extreme and this challenge should be at the hardest it ever gets  since lots of BS can happen but hope this helps and GL
---
Vibe check incoming
---
Congrats, that makes you an asshole.
---
"most people" that is a very bold assumption that is almost garunteed to be incorrect. just cuz i know it sucks, doesn't mean I'm not gonna do it. when i see someone do something that sucks to play against, but i know they did it for a mission or daily, its w.e. i understand cuz i know I'd do the same and i just move on with my day. plus most people apologize end game for any toxic behavior the rift missions made them do
---
Enchantments do nothing. Let a blacksmith do the work for ye
---
Surge just needs the "basic attack" condition to be removed to be viable
---
So much this. I'm so sick of seeing this shit, not just in this game but in others. Oh I felt bad for playing the game and killing the enemies. I get sportsmanship n shit, but when did it become not ok to beat your opponents down? Everybody's so soft now a days.
---
Yui‚Äôs face is so cute
---
Yes watching a live feed of someone playing a game while in the same match is the same as forcefully having sex with a woman, you sure hit the nail on the head.
---
What an asshole
---
LOWERCASE BAD
---
You are not supposed to wiggle out. This mechanic exist to encourage killers to hook you, instead of carrying you around the map.
---
That's way too powerful. 15% is huge with no cool down. I agree with removing the basic attack clause because yeah that's frankly stupid. But then just lowering the cooldown or increasing the regression alone would be enough.
---
If the killer is gonna be an asshole i'm gonna be an asshole too. If he goes out of his way to tunnel or camp me i'm gonna be an annoying son of a bitch at the gates.
---
Ghost face coming in for the vibe check

Honestly once I notice a survivor do this I just 180 around a tree and down them cause they don‚Äôt expect it

"I don't want to farm" "I don't care" why am I not surprised

Who gives a shit?
---
Whispers is an amazing perk on Myers imo, one big reason is that it helps you find people to stalk early game, getting you out of your T1 much quicker.
---
and? I'm not responsible for anyones fun but my own and my teammates and i don't expect my opponents to appempt to keep my fun either. also mind gaming someone into rqing in a game like LoL is not an asshole move. the person who rq is the asshole. LoL is actually a competitive fame with a ranked mode that matters. its a bit different in a game like dbd since winning in dbd doesn't matter nearly as much with the shorter queue times, shorter game length, shit ranking, and not a competitive game, but the same concept applies. fuck my opponent. theyre my adversary not my friend

I don't believe you play dead by daylight, show us a five minute clip of you typing your credit card info in to buy auric cells..

---
Why would they be banned? There‚Äôs an easy counter to stream sniping, devs who jerk off streamers and ban people cuz someone is sniping, are fucking retarded.
---
I really don't understand how BHVR think low prio queue for new players is going to make them want to stick around, especially when it just throws new players in way over their heads.
---
You can watch some stuff from Otzdarva when he talks about clown, but yeah you drop the pallet early, by the time you run out of pallets exit gates should be open lol.

They‚Äôre both shit examples but the unlocked car is more similar because there‚Äôs ways to to deal with it. Really no example for this should involve a crime. Because this isn‚Äôt illegal.
---
thatsthejoke.avi
---
No.
---
Even if they fixed the issues where the perk doesn't trigger as often as it needs to, the perk currently does so little on each trigger that it'd still be significantly worse than basically any other option you could run.
---
This is inspiring.
---
It had a hitbox and everything-
---
Ok
---
Have you seen the post long ago from the psychologist who analyzed the game? It's exactly as described above, like it's not just a game of winning/doing objectives, but on a deeper level it's a game of humiliation. How can I humiliate the killer? Dropping pallets, denying the catching/finding/hitting me. How can I humiliate survivors? Hitting them, mind-gaming them, hooking them. The deep psychological fear of humiliation flows right into the power/control and people get emotional quickly
---
Well of course now that I've said that, I just got shat on. There was 1 David who was too good and his friends were following me disabling my traps.
---
Lmao, camping is back strategy, as long as it's not abused lol
---
Man, veggietales was fucking weird lol

---
It doesn't need a cooldown. It's limited enough by the fact you need to down a guy near a gen to trigger it.
---
That's removed because it's just superfluous.
---
The regression needs to be increased, just because the current number is just sad. The perk ends up regressing gens a decent amount if there's nobody there to resume the gen, but if somebody's on the gen when it triggers, it does basically nothing.
---
i think he means dweets
---
You're obviously a troll and this isn't funny
---
Yep!
---
I never bitched about camping and tunneling myself, I find it silly to complain about such things (Not that I do them, but when I am on the receiving end, I just usally let it go and join the next match instead of waiting for the killer to come out of the match just to flame him)
---
If he reports me, well, I don't really care about a ban honestly, I feel like recently this game has been zapping way too much of my time, so hey, it would give me an excuse to do something else, haha. So yeah, beam me up scotty. Plus, don't people usually complain about the grind in the game, and THAT is the reason why survivors hate dying so quickly, because they "wasted"  their time? I dunno, I might be rambling, but some people do appreciate it, what am I supposed to do? Ignore the person who doesn't want to farm? Sure, but then he's gonna get bored and complain about it anyways. He wants to get chased right? I'll chase him alright

Too bad the devs think that mashing a button is immersive and satisfactorily simulates a struggle.
---
I did it fairly easy as the trapper.
---
Run Agitation and Iron Grasp if you have it, setup up three or so traps in around the killer shack (in the grass/plants on the corners and one outside the window) at the start of the game. Knock down a person and throw them into the basement and go check a nearby gen, chances are you'll catch a survivor before they even get the save.
---
Yes dip shit. I don't know if you're new to Reddit or if you made a alt account to troll, but we aren't stupid.
---
It a crappy port.
---
Which is why you should get the Soulja Boy Console version instead.
---
Haha it's okay, that's why I posted it :)
---
this gota be staged
---
I never said that you did, I said don't.
---
I got a Steve Obsession dressed obnoxiously as he played. He was good but I took my stacks of PWYF and fucked off after that first hook lol. 
---
Had a carry build the fucker...could only hold him for MAYBE 15 seconds. Couldnt move for shit either. Didnt realize it until he escaped 2nd hook attempt that he made nearby hook auras invisible to me during the carry. 
---
One of the more unique builds I've seen and I cant imagine what 4 survivors would be like with those perks. God damn infuriating but luckily saved him for the end
---

[The Killer:](https://youtu.be/cOy6hqzfsAs)
---
You gotta love a racist troll. You just fucking posted a pic of an Asian woman and said "getting ready for my Yui cosplay". You're not funny. Do something better with your time.
---
Dude, it doesn't have any racist intentions. It'd be just as racist as using a white blondie and saying I'm cosplaying Kate.
---
This, does put a smile in my face
---
Yea just the way he handled that I‚Äôm probably gonna start watching his stuff. Dude remained calm and was actually polite. At the end he didn‚Äôt take the bait and moved on. That, and the fact that he utterly rekt their butts with some sweet moves.
---
bruh, I bet my kidney that this has 0 to do with racism and is just an obvious troll/joke
---
I no joke shit my pants during this scene
---
Back when my friends started playing, I used OoO. Not to feed information, but because I wanted to run Sole Survivor and have more benefit from playing with my two buddies besides them providing a fun distraction for the first few minutes. 
---
Still my favorite conceptual build, even if it isn't really even good in theory anymore. Wasn't worth running before because everyone thinks you're just giving constant info, not worth running now because end game collapse.
---
To make some of her Add-Ons more appealing, I made the numbers high, meaning stacking them would be OP.
---
I'm glad I can make you smile with my amazing fashion sense.
---
Probably a few hundred milligrams.
---
Yes this would be cool
---
*laughs in Bond*
---
It's not funny and it's unrelated to the game. You're just posting stock images of Asian girls and being a twat.
---
I'm a bit confused, wouldn't there be  proof enough to ban the one guy who literally said he was watching?
---
With quotation marks, do you understand English grammar?
---
You have literally never played killer on in indoor map. The hooks are a nightmare. You get stuck on everything, they‚Äôre actually much farther away than you think because the layout of hooks gets fucked my how indoor maps are laid out, and a lot of times hooks near you are actually unreachable
---
The point is, he's made multiple posts of him just posting stock images of Asian women. It's not funny.
---
I know it's a troll, but he is targetting Asian people with his posts.
---
ye, so they get deleted, no reason to act up
---
As much as I dislike the people who do stream snipe, if it were bannable we'd be seeing streamers report every single person who beat them.
---
 The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
Bubba &gt; Billy
---
I don't see where they did anything toxic (can't see the chat at the end). They didn't flashlight spam or teabag, they were just overly altruistic and it cost them the game. Am I missing something?
---
You got my point, grammar has nothing to do with it..
---
I wouldn't act up if this wasn't his second post in 2 minutes. It's spam.
---
Lmaooo I'm still on level 2, I gave up on that shit long ago
---
this isnt anything targeted....just Report it for Spam and move on
---
I run BBQ, Ruin, Pop, and Thana along with Swing Chains and Jump Rope and it's ridiculously good. I 4k with it 90% of the time.
---
Thanks!

Hitomi is too good for John

And John should not hit on mi

so Report it

If hooked u got tunneled now gimme red arrows
---
When you‚Äôre the only original survivor that doesn‚Äôt have a blighted skin
---
Aww but it's no fun if I can't abuse the hell out of the add ons.
---
In all seriousness yeah that would probably be for the best.
---
Also About her skulk ability I'm a bit confused does it only make her undetectable while switching to it or is she always undetectable?
---
I contacted the Mods. And reported it. :) This subreddit doesn't need trolls.
---
Mask of shame. You have to wear it if you bought Deathgarden. Those are the rules.
---
I like the idea of revealing a survivor's aura to everyone when they get killed by an RBT, but their body shouldn't disappear, bodies remain after Moris I don't see why this should be any different.
---
I don't know about the extent of the changes planned, or necessary, but personally I would like an add-on (probably ultra-rare) that causes one random survivor to start the trial with an RBT.
---
I play survivor and killer equally and still believe this so like. To each their own I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
If the make the shook, they get the hook
---
I like edgy humour, but this is just dumb. I bet if it was a stock photo of a black woman and he said he was gonna Cosplay as Claudette, people would have their panties up in a bunch.
---
Also about that racist stuff, this Post is the same as if I posted a pic of myself and said: Hey look, a Jeff Cosplay.
---
Just cause I have a beard?
---
Think they‚Äôll back down on this one like they did for a bunch of the level three challenges? Nobody wants to try to get four basement sacrifices in one game, nobody wants to play against someone trying to get four basement sacrifices in one game.
---
doubt it.
---
If he was Asian it would be the same, but I highly doubt he's Asian.
---
Alright, then just wait until he does it and the SJWs who cosplay as Susie come crawling in.
---
Why is it every time i get ‚Äúopen exit gates w/ (insert survivor)‚Äù that someone sits there and emotes waving at me to help them help the last person on the hook all the way across the map?? I always apologize in the after game chat lol
---
why does that matter? also you cant tell that shit on the Internet
---
Happens ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I just realize this is probably your alt account. Nice try dip shit. Blocked.
---
She becomes Undetectable while Skulking. It's literally the crouch mechanic, just without the crouching part.
---
ye, honestly you cant take those People seriously
---
I do it to piss crybabies off and then hope they complain about it on reddit.
---
I‚Äôve had three success stories so far!
---
What do you mean by farming cards?
---
dude...way to go discusing lol
---
That works. Haven‚Äôt really seen anyone cry or complain about it though.
---
Stop that fucker, the other totems are watching
---
&gt; Wear that with bride
---
wat
---
Interesting, it‚Äôs not surprising the game files aren‚Äôt organized. Haha

Why do you have to say asian? Wow that's racist....I deleted and did a different post because the one of "Yui" didn't have bad filters and this one looked more like Feng Min.
---
I thought my post was long lol Just teasing. But I totally get you.
---
It's one of those games that is really enjoyable and interesting but there's times you need to take a break for a while when you began noticing a pattern of frustrating aspects woven in itself. Something a streamer I watch mentioned, it's better to take breaks and come back every once and a while because if you just play that you appreciate less of what you enjoy and instead focus more on what you hate. Right now it seems DBD is gonna be a rough time with questionable developer intuition regarding bans during game crashes and the lack of events in the foreseeable future. I do hope the game gets better.
---
Anyway, ignore the rude comments on here and just relax, get your mind on something else and get yourself happy again. It's not worth dealing with the toxicity if it's making you upset.
---
The same thing everyone has already said about dropping pallets early is good, the one thing I would add is that like most low mobility killers, make sure you know where the remaining generators are and if it looks like you're going to lose a chase (i.e. no pallets in an area), run as far away from the remaining generators as possible to prevent Clown from snowballing via proxy camping the hook and remaining generators at once (make him choose - hook or gens).
---
Object of obsession in a SWF is mentally draining to me, as a killer. 
---
Toxicity on top of that would make it unpleasant to play. 
---
Good on OTZ
---
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the same picture ‚Äú

---
this is so good omfg üòÇ
---
Toolboxes for sure. You lose so much breathing room to toolboxes and keys at least you can take kill them before that point in the game gets reached.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs absolutely impossible at rank 1. It‚Äôs driving me insane.
---
Haven‚Äôt watched it yet but wow. If you lose while stream sniping and having SWF you are a whole different level of trash
---
Why did they call Otz toxic?
---
Hes made a lod of accounts and he has done kate too. Dont rellt think its a race thing
---
Oh no, Nancy...

Fucking hell, talk about sensitive. Dude just tried to play Devil's advocate and you flip out and start calling people names. Maybe the internet isn't for you, friend.

Gotta love trolls.
---
Happened to me today as a killer
---
Like hell I'm gonna ignore him and go away
---
The guy died on the hook
---
To be honest love seeing those. They're almost way too cocky and think they're better than they are. They'll give you free hits and waste so much time.
---
Because they‚Äôre trash, but even that feels like an insult to trash.
---
I had a Bill drop EVERYTHING so he could boop my snoot, so I gave him a hat and went about my day. I found him later working on a genny, I think he had given up because a teammate had basically insa finished a genny when I gave him his hat. He let me kick a genny four times, which was very kind. I tried so hard to save his life, but I guess he was depressed because he let the trap murder him. Same match I had a Meg boop the snoot, so I gave her a hat too. Then I found the Nea, SHE DIDN'T BOOP THE SNOOT. So I spent the rest of the match proxy chasing her calling her a "little tartelette" for not booping the snoot.

Her will to live was strong, but Meg was my MVP, finished a genny to start Nea's trap when I meleed it, and then got her up off the ground when she was trying to force chase to avoid the time. Totally not how you are supposed to play, but still the funniest match of my life. I've never had a full on minion before. I gave Meg the hatch no questions.

Meg but smol

I‚Äôve faced him on PS4 once, only got him because he kinda forgot about deep wounds against a legion. He is a good survivor though
---
Just run Tapp's perk that makes good skill checks great if the challenge needs you to hit great skill checks; all that matters is the result and that you're using the perk, it doesn't need you to be injured as far as I remember.
---
Cards..? What, were you playing Last Year?
---
Don't think they called him toxic? Also sounded like the Claudette who was talking in post game only joined the stream after she died and saw who she was playing against?
---
What you said is like saying ‚Äúas a survivor player, I think we shouldn‚Äôt keep our momentum after a fast vault. It‚Äôs too hard for the killer to catch up sometimes‚Äù
---
Would you believe that they play survivor? I wouldn‚Äôt.
---
Regardless, could you counter my points since you say that?

He‚Äôs the best DBD content creator hands down

---
come on thats not really a good insult
---
Holy crap. Cudos! I can't play bubba for shit.
---
He is actually using a new account at the moment. His vids are hil with newer killers. The names are also removed unlike the reuploads.
---
lol hahaha.
---
100% agree, especially since commodious toolbox with both repair speed add-ons is, in my opinion, the most powerful item in the game.
---
I honestly think if you could stack perks, double ruin would be meta. Alternatively, triple Thanatophobia + Pop on Legion and Plague
---
The number of times I have mistaken pustula petals for scratch marks ‚Ä¶ üòû
---
My record is 8 without the perk so it‚Äôs possible even without TINH
---
I've done it like 4 times and people keep disconnecting so I won't get it. It's always the last person right when I'm walking down the stairs.
---
probably nothing
---
I just did it first try using No Mither, don't have to depend on getting chased first. First gen I got one skill check, next one I got about 10 and I got it. Luckily for me, I was going against a terrible camping Trapper so I didn't have to worry about him chasing me. I completed 3 gens on my own.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea actually!! I‚Äôll try that!
---
Huntress
---
 I experience the same, I'm usually the most annoying survivor to chase as killer. They hate me to much to give me hatch. Unless it's a really good killer who respects my skill and has the mindset of "if one deserves the hatch, than its you! I feel sorry about you getting potatoe team mates"
---
sucks to be good lol 
---
And I know, it sounds like flexing. But this is just my experience.
---
Holy shit what
---
She needs a lil bbq sauce on her titties
---
Mhm
---
My gamertag on xbox is Die Terribly. I think its funny.
---
I mean he's a bad killer for sure lol,but he's a god when it comes to defending the basement stairs
---
Ruin, BBQ, STBFL, and personally, even though I have BBQ, I really like discordance
---
I don‚Äôt consider hair and makeup really a cosplay. I mean if she posted it on The Witcher subreddit and said she was cosplaying Triss she would have gotten as much upvotes and praise, if not more. I‚Äôm just saying, her Freddy cosplay was far better and only got 400 upvotes. Says a lot about society üò≥
---
It is
---
What do you mean nothing lol
---
No legs meg, yes it looks good
---
What rank are you at?Purple-green ranks have a higher tendency to DC imo.
---
I am gonna flex a bit here, but I once had a game with a 3 man swf who dc'd after hearing the nurse tele. I ended up running her around for about 3 minutes before she closed hatch and I still ran her around until egc got me. (Before nurse nerf also rank 1.)
---
Good luck, I've realized these challenges are a bit easier to get if you just play for the challenge and not worry about escaping. Doing the 4 gens in a single trial is the only one I'm not looking forward to. I'm confused about that one, do I have to fully do 4 gens? Or just finish 4?
---
*Bubba happy noises*
---
One of my friends sent me a video of me walking right by them and that made me think,' Oh shit, how many survivors have I walked past.' 
---
Thinking of this hurts my brain...
---
Oh damn
---
It‚Äôs like the last one. You just have to be there starting at about 95% and top it off. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve read.
---
And deja vu üòèüòè

üòãüòãüòãüòã

Fucking did it! Fuck you Dark Sense i'm never using you again!! Took over 20 games ffs. Was so close so many times but always slightly short on last gen before i got caught.
---
That‚Äôs actually hilarious. Mine‚Äôs pretty lame compared to that lol
---
is this satire
---
Rank 9, I was rank 1 and derank myself. I regret hahaha
---
Stop being a pussy. It‚Äôs called life. If you haven‚Äôt had one person be ‚Äútoxic‚Äù in the real world then well done. It‚Äôs not the game it‚Äôs the people. If you‚Äôre put in a competitive situation obviously things will get heated
---
Imagine needing a kanabo to OneShot survivors for 45 seconds.
---
This post was made by Myers gang.
---
There many potatoes in red ranks too ngl.The match I posted everyone was rank 2-4 I believe
---
I can't get this challenge lmao
---
The biggest clown are the people like you shaming a swf for having fun tbh I pity you
---
It‚Äôs a joke about this totem being so revealed it‚Äôs naked
---
Rancer?
---
Would you believe me if I said I did the stair technique twice in that match too lol
---
What‚Äôs SWF and why does everyone hate it?  It sounds like it just means outside comms, which should be expected since the game lets you queue with friends
---
That‚Äôs Freeze Mieser god damn it. Know his name!
---
I use xbox not iPhone
---
But most hags at his level run M+A, so that‚Äôs how a Hag sounds like
---
[spooky man](https://imgur.com/a/LbZD1m4)
---
The 4 basement sacrifices one is worse. Salty survivors DC to deny it.
---
Actually I used this perk to rat out my fellow survivors...when I was playing solo...i would find one that does a gen,would sit with him and watch the killer,if the killer would come towards me,I would stop looking at him,fuck up the skill check and leave/hide...every man for himself.
---
&gt;  but personally I would like an add-on (probably ultra-rare) that causes one random survivor to start the trial with an RBT.
---
That would be fire asf
---
I never mentioned his name at all, but yes, that is indeed Freeze Miser from  "The Year Without A Santa Claus". I was just trying to do a funny, **Chill** mate.
---
Sadly progress does not carry over and they didn't add the post game chat. I just switched from the console version to the steam version myself and im having to do the grind all over again, but I got the steam version to gain access to the PTB which the Windows/Gamepass version does not have either.
---
Yeah and no end game chat!
---
They just need to get rid of the complete in one trial thing. I‚Äôm not looking foreword to playing game after game running Dark Sense until I get a team that is somehow bad enough to not do gens but good enough to not get killed
---
&gt;  you know they are a SWF group.
---
How do you know if they are
---
The amount of people I play with that don‚Äôt want to take the hit is just stupid. If you take the hit you get a speed boost and can get away. Meanwhile I will go down as punishment for saving you. The friend group I play with has someone that feels very obligated to be saved with borrowed time but never takes the hits. I don‚Äôt run borrowed time because of her and sometimes just don‚Äôt care to farm her or let her die on the hook. If you‚Äôre an ass, I‚Äôll treat you like an ass.
---
In their defense they weren't exploiting/cheating the game itself. He was being less of a scummy cheater and more of a greedy idiot.

This is the new time wasting strat

hey won't it be mad if we had a mortal kombat killer? heck their moris can just be fatalities

I know it‚Äôs just a joke. Guess I should have made that clear.
---
Deep Wound is like better Soppy Butcher
---
Exhaustion is like a broken huntress add-on, but on every M1 and totally kills Dead Hard
---
Seeing survivor aura at all time when they are running breaks the entire design of the game, killing all mind-games. There‚Äôs a perk ‚ÄúI‚Äôm All Ears‚Äù which lets you see their aura for a moment after a fast vault once every 60 seconds and some people call that broken good
---
It's because you have 150 hours in the game. Try having thousands in. Eventually running into the same shit piles up frustration and it gets old.
---
But you can always get to a hook on any map. The indoor maps are literally harder to hook in than any other map. Like this complaint is *so weird*.
---
If you wanna talk about broken hook placement tho most maps have an area where only one hook is available at all. *That‚Äôs* broken. Being unable to hook no matter what is an issue. Usually getting hooked is **not** an issue.
---
And as literally everyone has pointed out to you, wiggling out is supposed to be difficult. 
---
Once again, you lost the chase. Take your hook and deal with it
---
exactly! Im so tired of this shit and it should honestly be reportable
---
I‚Äôm hoping you are memeing about killing yourself. Definitely not worth doing that ever. Especially for a video game.
---
Hex: Ruin / Surveilance / Pop Goes the Weasel   
---
Then you can choose what ever. I like Save the Best for Last or Discordance
---
What's great about the default shirt is that he tucks it in, but he wears the shorts so high xD
---
Remember, if you're using a perk I don't like, you're being toxic
---
A complete joke.
---
Literally none of that is toxic. Give me a break
---
IF A TRAPPER TRAPS ME IN THE BASEMENT AND DROPS MORE THAN 1 TRAP I TYPICALLY SUICIDE SO MY TEAM DOESN'T THROW THE GAME TRYING TO SAVE ME. JUST SAYIN.
---
I've though about doing that, but I dont play Hag
---
They sniped him which is definitely toxic. The things they did in the match? Definitely not toxic. And they were toxic in chat. But as far as gameplay goes they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. I love playing against fun survivors like that. Much better than immersed nerds
---
I guess it's the same logic behind that old shooter "I could shoot this guy, but I could also knife him to death for extra humiliation" thing.
---
One of those is wrong, actually.
---
My tag is zipperface4343
---
B(L)OOP
---
Sometimes if I have a ttv player in my match I'll go watch their stream afterward, pretty cool to see yourself from a survivors POV
---
Have you ever had your other teammates block you into a corner lol
---
You're taking the game too seriously with perhaps one of the most twisted mindsets I've ever heard. The people you're playing against, your opponents, aren't some enemy who burned down your home. Don't be an asshole to them for no reason, that's psychotic.
---
Toxic has become a generic complaint / insult in most situations. Most of the time I see it used, it's not really used on something toxic / someone being toxic. It's just used as a generalized "fuck you"
---
Survive With Friends.
---
Just imagine getting pallet stunned, then watching the pink haired Nea slow clap..
---
No I'm pretty sure the biggest clown is the Clown.
---
Do like paths or drawn lines for certain citiations
---
Nah, knew it was in jest!
---
its not psychotic to understand people play worse when they are tilted so you attempt to throw them on tilt. its literally why survivors tea bag and flashlight click. they don't do it cuz its more fun. they do it cuz strategically they know it pisses you off and you'll play worse when you're angry
---
Please lol.
---
I'd like to see the same thing but default poses
---
I'd say intentionally trying to infuriate people over a game so you can win is, yeah, pretty psychotic.
---
Check out their profiles while you're in the lobby and see if any of their teammates are on their friends list. Also, some groups make their names look similar or they'll all wear matching skins. Alternatively, after awhile you'll begin to identify certain SWF groups just simply because you play against them.
---
Ahh yes, the ultra toxic strats of taking hits and using perks. 
---
Come on, man. There are genuinely toxic and malicious players in dbd, that deserve the ire of the community, but (outside of possibly stream sniping) these aren't them. They were just playing the game to win, just as Otz did. All that calling players like these "toxic" does is dilute the meaning of the word.
---
You being super competitive has nothing to do with your attempts to tilt people, you being a, let me put it very bluntly, massive asshole does. You can justify your actions with competition as much as you want, but you're just playing like an asshole.
---
So why are you using a third party software. You didn‚Äôt effect others but you broke terms of service
---
Oh sorry, the funny part of my brain got shut off recently.
---
The solo queue experience is something else man, at least kindred is high tier now.
---
I disagree I myself have gotten screwed over a bunch by Huntresses running Monitor her lullaby makes me aware but sometimes I'll keep repairing the gen until I hear her actual heartbeat and by the time that happens it's too late to run she's already on me.
---
Idk that's strange then. Maybe you had some leftover from last year? Lol maybe restarting your game would fix it
---
If it works like that then maybe I have some from last years, the serum has had 9 extra since I got my first cosmetic set so I restarting def won‚Äôt do anything
---
what
---
don't get me wrong. I am a massive asshole. i really don't care. doesn't change the fact that throwing people on tilt is a great tactic and me being an asshole lets me make use of every tactic to gain an advantage that doesn't violate the rules of the game
---
i‚Äôm awful at billy but i‚Äôll try him one day. as for huntress, i have good internet so i honestly have no issues with smoothness. just problems with hitting over objects (which is a pain.) thanks for the good luck.
---
No, they don't.
---
No there's no carrying over
---
They clearly did want to win
---
You are stretching like mister fantastic
---
Do you remember if you redeemed 60 last year for 6 individual cosmetic pieces? I do remember last year we were able to earn serum in odd numbers like that. So that could be it
---
alrighty thanks !
---
thanks!
---
I have the full Dwight and doctor sets from last year, nothing else
---
I mean it was humourous but it was gorey and fucked up enough. Supes just isnt.
---
This is the creepiest post on the entire sub
---
Why don‚Äôt you just hit the other survivor? Or put some pressure on the gens?
---
Here hold up, let me try and make it look less like that because damn you right
---
I think the obvious answer from her perspective would be that you were getting more hatchets and it was a coincidence.
---
We're all here pretending to be killers in a game but what we have here is the real deal
---
You should probably steer away from dbd for a while, it's honestly just re-branded politics at this point lol
---
they aren't doing it this year since they're focusing more on Tome stuff
---
Unpopular Opinion: Tai Lung did nothing wrong.
---
It's nice but that looks like a dude.
---
Politics was always my poorest subject in school
---
Imagine taking the side of stream sniping, rude as fuck SWF survivors purposefully trying to bully killers and gain even more of an advantage over killers.
---
Meanwhile, Otz was extremely nice and even gave tips for how they could make their plays work better, and even told one of his fans not to call the SWF toxic since they weren't actually doing anything toxic in game.
---
You're the fuckin' clown here, bud.
---
I see. Sorry I couldn't be much help. I can't think of anything else it could be unless u paid for one last year with auric cells and just don't remember
---
And releasing more Xmas cosmetics, mui importanto
---
I commented on Otz's video and Otz faved it, He misunderstood what the guy was saying. He tuned in after he died and in the first 15 seconds when he started watching he heard "toxic swf", which is what he wrote. 
---
Im pretty sure they werent stream sniping, they just started watching after they died and heard that
---
Me: When I play killer I don‚Äôt tunnel (or if I hit them by accident I leave them and let their friends get them) or camp! 
---

I‚Äôm only here for DBD &amp; wrestling memes, so this is fantastic.
---
Oh.
---
I'D REALLY LIKE TO FIND OUT WHICH BRAINLET AMONG THOSE AT BHVR DECIDED THAT REQUIRING 4 BASEMENT SACRIFICES IN A SINGLE FUCKING MATCH WAS A GOOD IDEA. WHOEVER YOU ARE, I HOPE YOUR LEGS GET A "DISCONNECTED FROM SERVER" THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE GOING UP SOME STAIRS.
---
IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE, ESPECIALLY FOR ME AT RED RANKS. SURVIVORS AREN'T STUPID, THEY'LL EITHER STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THE BASEMENT WHEN THEY CATCH ON TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING, OR OUTRIGHT DC TO DENY YOU YOUR CHALLENGE. I HAD A FUCKING FENG JUST DC ON MY FACE WHEN I DOWNED HER AS THE LAST ONE LEFT PURELY TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T GET IT, SO OBVIOUSLY YOUR FUCKING DC PENALTIES AREN'T ENOUGH. FUCK THEM, FUCK HER, AND FUCK YOU.
---
No I didnt use a flair. It was taken down automatically. What's your deal? Did someone hurt you?
---
Wow thats bullshit. No wonder putting pressure as a killer can be so hard at times.
---
Literally it's my second-ever silver and it's the first person to see this meme...damn. Thank you so much.
---
Thats a shame, id rather sparklers and fireworks than these shitty little charm things tbh
---
Anyone playing Jeff, I am legally obligated to let you go

That is an absurdly generous reading
---
Lmao no problem ‚ô•Ô∏è. I've never awarded anyone, but Reddit kindly gave me some coins. Good memes deserve to be awarded.
---
How? 
---
He said "in the first 5 seconds I came in", implying that when he begun watching, in the first 5 seconds he heard "toxic swf".
---
how many times will this be posted
---
TRAPPER NEEDS HELP MAN, HE CAN BARELY GET A HOOK UNLESS YOU STEP IN A TRAP EVEN IF RUIN STAYS UP ALL GAME, I'M ALMOST CONVINCED YOU COULD GO TO SLEEP FOR EIGHT HOURS AND COME BACK STILL ALIVE WHEN PLAYING AGAINST HIM IF NOT FOR THE IDLE CROWS.
---
I will be watching for your memes, my fellow memer.

There‚Äôd be an automod message in this thread unless you‚Äôre saying a mod manually removed your post. Lies on lies is weirdo shit
---
It's a version of the story of David killing a dude to steal his wife, except it's a cucumber stealing a rubber duck from an asparagus child.
---
This is the part where a pea sings a song about how it's bad to take sheep from children.
---
Oh yeah, it used to be so bad for killer, survivors could fast vault no matter what, actions took longer in general, shack had only 1 door and 2 windows...
---
Not to mention instablind flashlights and more
---
r/warframe ?
---
after i level huntress to 50 i‚Äôm going to start up on trapper or wraith. hag next, then spirit. those are really the only free killers that i want to play/need to practice.
---
I‚Äôm gonna tell ya right now: I barely read any of this because I‚Äôm so exhausted with people‚Äôs opinions on the rift. What I did see is plenty reasonable, though. 
---
All I‚Äôm gonna say is that it might have been wise to not have purchased this one straight away so you could have gotten a sense of how much you could do
---
What is it?can't turn the audio on rn and probably i'm gonna forget to come and turn it on tomorrow
---
They finally fixed it ?
---
Odd...your anecdotes don't match my gameplay experience whatsoever.
---
That‚Äôs 3 DS 4 self care SWF
---
"iS tHaT tHe BiTe Of 87?!?!"
---
Not at all.  You make survivor comms part of the game.  Solos and SWFs get it.    
---
You then balance for it.
---
Yeah, if G-Sync is actually functioning, it should obviously match refresh rate to framerate. I have no experience with G-Sync monitors, so I can't say why you experience stuttering at 120fps as opposed to 144.
---
I'd say having 3 flashlights is enough to warrant me to use Lightborn, especially as a Wraith. It's enjoyable walking slowly towards a survivor as in their futile attempt try to blind me. Just love slowly kicking in that dread of "Oh fuck, he still can see me!" hehehe But of course when I forget to equip it I dread a Nea appearing out of thin air to rescue my victim, it's the equivalent of stepping on a rake and getting faceplanted.
---
Toolboxes comes a close second for me though, I haven't even bothered to level up Hag for Ruin so I gotta use Franklin's or Overcharge to put in some pressure. I tend to use Franklin's with keys too hoping they lose it since keys can be a game changer if enough gens are completed or EGC happens.
---
HOW THIS FUCKING COMMUNITY ACTS TOWARDS THE DEVS, HAVE THEY DONE DUMB SHIT YES WILL THEY DO DUMB SHIT ALSO YES, BUT THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE THE BEHAVIOR THAT WE SHOW THEM, ALL WE DO IS JUST INSULT THEM, WE NEED TO NOT BE SO THICK THAT WE CAUSE A SINGULARITY, AND ACTUALLY PRACTICE WHAT WE PREACH
---
How do I post a screenshot then? Because I definitely recieved the message. "Friendly reminder this post is temporary taken down but can be put back up by adding a flair". Dont understand what you're on about mate. Did you not get enough hugs as a child?
---
Yes, except survivors will send you messages as a killer ratting out their shitty teammates cause you can see it in game
---
I would also recommend Surveillance instead of Discordance. Both are good on Freddy but Surveillance can come in clutch when there‚Äôs only 3 gens left
---
Casuals do level 4 thome?
---
That's edgy as fuck my dude
---
Nope. That's how lazy they are these days. 
---
But hey, they have sales!! Steam only!!
---
Love the posters. I‚Äôm moving in.
---
JUST PLAY LIKE OTZ DOES. USE INVISIBLE TRAPS AND BE TOXIC TO ALL THE SURVIVORS.
---
/s
---
Otz is currently recovering from his STBFL addiction
---
We need LESS clothing on him, not more
---
When you're finished moving in, could you straighten them for me? Thanks.
---
Funny how you keep saying it's fine but your comment that it's fine is premised on if they banned toxic behavior and you acknowledge they don't.  
---
The challenge IS broke.  Keep trying though.
---
I mean killers whine just as much. You just don't experience toxic killers because you need to play survivor to. 
---
The only times i've ever been hard r'd was from killers, and I'm probably like a 60/40 killer main overall.
---
I see you don't play killer often. DS lasts a whole minute. You will very often run into survivors with DS and never tunnel.
---
 Best killer too
---
me too!
---
Yeah Tru3 none to subtly makes his opinions know about this crap, about how for some reason they elect to not making stream sniping a bannable offense and as he said its not as easy as just delaying his stream because then he looses all real time communication with his community, at that point you may aswell just watch his youtube instead.
---
Honestly though with how generally unstable this game is i would be surprised if they Report features were even connected up to a backend system in the first place.
---
ultimately though they are laying in the bed they made, while you can of course point part of the issues towards the community itself, lets not forget that it was Starbreeze and Behavior who let the game stay in such a state that survivors had such a power role that many gained a inflated sense of ego and pride, lets not forget it was Star breeze and Behavior that continued to pander towards these type of survivors, it was Starbreeze and Behavior that added SWF to push this even further, it was Starbreeze and Behavior who patch after patch for years kept giving those type of survivor more and more power, making it easier and easier for them to win with more safety blankets and perks, it was Starbreeze and Behavior that through this drove killers to equal levels of toxicity just to feel like they can win once in a while, it was Starbreeze and Behavior that even now still have present or promoted toxic mechanics.
---
The community is a rather aggressive and toxic dumping grounds because in its early days the Publishers pushed towards making the game more survivor sided they bolstered this idea of a entitled community, the idea that as a survivor with your pals you run the buttmonkey killer around with your instablinds,D strikes and country worth of pallets. That as killer after your 4th bad game you grab your Mori, your Leatherface and camp that basement hook. The origin of the game was a important time to control and decide how the community should expand and the publishers and devs instead pushed a Us vs Them mentality that bred these Egoistical survivor mains who think they are the greatest thing ever, or these jaded, frustrated killers mains who play just as toxic under a delusion that everyteam they fight will be as bad as that Squadette last match.
---
Things have changed yes, more then i thought, less then i hoped but at the end of the day this community was built on the Old DBD the DBD where survivors where the unmatched power role and killers were less then a AI to be slapped around by high rank survivors and even the devs, and even though stuff has gotten better you still have those people around, like a disease, a culture that was allowed to breed and now is impossible to remove even with cleaning efforts.
---
Cleaning ups this community would require a massive overhaul and improvement to the report system, and considering the devs said they wont even spare a chapter to fix the game that derails every other patch, i have no faith they will fix the report system, Leaver busters took 4 years to be put in and will do nothing, people will just sandbag on the hook instead since the system does not register or define whether a person is intentionally killing themselves on the hook.

So after the earlier feed back catch me on anal beads Moro spirit only and fuck trying new killers. Hope everyone has fun!
---
I read just fine, Come back with the finished cosplay, my cosplay is more epic
---
I'm waiting for the moment killers and survivors branch off into their own respective subs, then legitimately convince themselves the other side chooses that role because they actually hate Dead by Daylight and want it to fail.
---
R/g colorblind fog dweller here, I personally wish Behaviour would just not make ruin change the skill checks from white. I feel like it is an unintended additional detriment  to the survivor that ends up being unfair for a certain population of the game. I'm a decent survivor and I can land my ruin checks, but sometimes the color can be an issue.

What are you even trying to say

Dont mind AustralianDeadMate, he doesnt have much between the ears.

Ah, i see. The more you know.

I can understand that view point but it is a testament to bhvr's incompetence when basically every other company in gaming has figured out how to do a battle pass set up. The rift is not fun or challenging, it's just more grinding.
---
They do have counters tho
---
You can not tunnel and still get DS‚Äôd

Exactly
---
Yes. Literally any amount of time gens are slowed in any way at the start of a game is good.
---
why is this deleted
---
Im horrified for my dear life
---
This is cursed and I absolutely love it
---
*Mario No..
---
[JEWS](/intensifies) (just kidding)
---
Did you miss the part where they called out the invisible trap even though at that time in game no survivors saw it?
---
Imagine having to deal with either issue post made by Oni gang
---
When I play killer I like to consider the fact that there are 4 people on the other time also trying to have fun. Like yeah sure I could enjoy basement camping but that's not fun for the other 4 people in the game trying to have fun too.
---
He running PWYF He ain‚Äôt staring
---
That's what I've been doing. I took a break and have started playing some games that can calm the nerves. Mostly for Honor, Red Dead Redemption 2, and the outer worlds.
---
Thanks. The positive comments are pretty helpful. It gets tiring that I say my thoughts on the game and people still decide to leave shity comments for the sake of being mean
---
even if they power through it gives you an adequate slowdown assuming you are half decent at ending chases
---
Thanks everyone! This has been a good cake day and I appreciate that you up voted my blatant karma whoring, but this has been a meme I've wanted to live since I joined a year ago. üòÅ
---
they should at least reuse assets from last year. maybe they wanted the Oni background to last a bit longer?
---
I've got character portraits and perk/status icons. They're safe so far.
---
MYC isn‚Äôt a good perk. You pretty much have to camp if you want to use it, and that‚Äôs not a good strategy at the red ranks. The only killers MYC is good on are Freddy, Wraith, Hag, and Demogorgon. 
---
As for Ruin, it‚Äôs a bit of a hit or miss. However, it‚Äôs by far still the best perk for delaying gens. And trust me, they fly at the red ranks
---
I thought I was the only one... Drops a pallet crouch walks away.
---
Imagine needing traps to stop survivor actions, post made by doctor gang
---
I just did it, completed 2 solo gens and was able to do half/quarters with others. Ended up being on all 5 gens when they popped to be safe, felt good. Then I see I didn‚Äôt get the challange, apparently that game I was suppose to interrupt and grab 2 survivors, I didn‚Äôt fucking equip the challange. Fucking pissed.
---
MYC literally doesn‚Äôt work if you camp
---
He's not quite as good as zubatlel or scottjund but he makes way better videos than them.
---
I know you have to be a certain distance away. However, you have to be near the area to catch whoever goes for the unhook. You‚Äôre pretty much never going to get your MYC survivor if you‚Äôre across the map. Therefore, you need to stay near the area, which will hurt you more often than not
---
Yeah no. If you choose to give yourself a disadvantage by streaming, deal with the fact that people use what.
---
If it bothers you so much, put enough delay to make sure they won't profit much from it. 
---
If you don't, that's nothing to QQ about.
---
I used it once and I love it idk why
---
I'll fully admit that I shouldn't have purchased it right away. That was 100% a poor decision on my part and I had a fundamental misunderstanding on how it worked.
---
Listen man, I feel your situation as I've been close to the knife as well, but this isn't the right place to look for help. Go onto a subreddit that can actually help because all you'll find here are baby survivors and sweaty clips. I genuinely hope you find help but it's rare to find someone here that knows what it feels like to have lost hope and overcome it. Good luck man.
---
Not if you have decent game sense. And MYC lasts for a full minute. That‚Äôs plenty of time to catch someone out and it also has the added benefit of making that person more wary of engaging in actions that‚Äôll attract your attention.
---
It‚Äôs not an amazing perk but I think you‚Äôre doing it a bit of a disservice
---
Nothing you listed was toxic but someone else explained the toxic parts of after chat and the fact that they sniped him.
---
this is the only community i feel safe :\\  thanks for the advice though.  Maybe I'll join a different community
---
A survivor who has ds and unbreakable is truly untouchable unless you have a mori
---
Astounding work, I know. You're welcome.
---
Got ya, I figured that was it but couldn't read the chat log due to me watching on my phone, thanks.
---
I mean, there‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs not a meta perk. And no, 1 minute really isn‚Äôt a lot. Especially if you don‚Äôt know who your MYC is
---
Its cool that you like this community and its honestly an honor to have someone that's so kind hearted, but it's not pure as you already saw. It has its flaws, and it can be frustrating.
---
Remap it to scroll wheel.
---
Honestly DBD is a pretty hit or miss game most of the time. Don't do anything to harm yourself, please go and find professional help for this kind of stuff and just don't play DBD for some time or never if you want to. Play something that you know you will enjoy then taking a risk of making yourself feel like complete shit without it being your fault. Please go find people who actually want to help you. Hope you get better.
---
Yeah for sure, he's best at making informative videos. I think those 2 just stream themselves playing games right?
---
WHILE YOUR AT IT, GIVE US KEYBOARD AND MOUSE SUPPORT. WHY IS THERE NO KEYBOARD AND MOUSE SUPPORT FOR A GAME THAT RELEASED PC?!?! HOLY SHIT
---
Literally my point. Just reuse from last year. I would be more than happy!
---
probably someone who got to rank one and then decided to try playing nurse
---
or you're just a god of this game, in which case, you don't need the hatch. you'll always loop for 5 gens and escape
---
I mean Tombstone Tuft is probably the most horror movie like build you can get in this game the killer feels like a much bigger threat because you could die if he gets within a yard of you, I find it incredibly fun to play against personally
---
Disagree, just because someone isn‚Äôt amazing at cosplay or special effects makeup, doesn‚Äôt mean they shouldn‚Äôt post their content.  All content creators start somewhere and gatekeeping cosplay makes no sense.
---
OP clearly spent a lot of time contouring her face to match Meg‚Äôs, and it looks really good!  It‚Äôs difficult to appreciate it if you have not done or are not a big fan or that type of content.
---
This is the way.
---
Its funnnn
---
Not a trapper trap but on Lerys, I had a hag place a trap on the grating in the center operating room and it is 100% invisible on the grating.
---
Please, do not let the messages of Dbd's general community get to you... in my experience, this is the worst community ever, even worse than CS, Fortnite or LoL, and I say that even though I really love this game. People will always get pissed off for small things just because they think that they are better, but they usually forget to really relax and have fun. You know that you did nothing to deserve that, and I know that this must be hard, but try to ignore those dumbasses, they don't know a shit about you
---
Watching him predict when they'll fall into a trap is identical to that one scene in Home Alone where Harry is counting down the times for the lights on the houses. It's funny but also kinda shows the absurd skill gap between Otz and the people he plays against.
---
Thank you to the person who gave me Silver!
---
Yes please.
---
DE gave us some free neat treats for our orbiters and other items, BHVR on the other hand decided that a few cosmetics where more important then actual events to spice up the same gamemode we have had for 3+ years.
---
I did not
---
Nice
---
Me: this community is so toxic. Why cant we all be friends?
---
Also me: *telling the survivors who let me die on my first hook that they will rot in hell*
---
Wiggling out isn't something that should happen that often.
---
Kinda, sometimes you have good games, and sometimes there are the games where 4 gems are done and Ruin is still up and u have one hook. Take this from a Rank One killer.
---
Even though you feel like it, even if you think that it was true, you're not summed up to a few words. You're bigger that any definition that someone puts on you, even yourself. I know that this may seem strange to say, as I am a stranger to you, but I have been there once. I had therapy for a long time, and I realized what I had achieved. Even worrying about your own mental health is already a big step. You clearly care about the community and only intends to have fun with it, but some people don't have this kind of empathy. I'm glad to know that, even though you had that experience, you still sees this community as a place to also get help! Really, you need to see that you're a wonderful human being, those little actions do matter
---
Marth88 quit dbd? He was an absolute monster.
---
Go commit no ruin
---
I got told I was being a "scummy killer" for killing 3 people in the basement.
---
By the guy who went to the opposite end of the map and just stood there to prevent me getting it.
---
Yep, of the two of us, I'm clearly scummy.
---
Dude, same! I've been chilling on RDR myself and Fallout 76 (guess I love buggy games). All the while I'm watching survivor vids like Ohmwrecker or Noob3's to learn how to survive before I go back to it since I was getting my ass handed to me.
---
And no problem. It's sadly expected for Dead by Daylight. Happy Holidays! I need sleep lol
---
But what if I run with a full swf squad and none of us know what to do and we are all qtpies? :3
---
Nah 1 minute is significant in this game especially at red ranks
---
They do it on fortnite. Shit, I was even accused of it shortly after they allowed cross play with pc and ps4. Some dude I've never heard of was getting their ass handed to them in a duo's match by me and a friend to the point they busted out some RPGs just to down both of us. My friend knew who he was but I never heard of the dude in my life before that point. It was a sweaty fucking battle. My friend was like oh that's a twitch streamer. I was like "a what?" He said go to twitch and check him out. So I did while we spectated him after they won the fight.
---
I watched the stream and backed up the video to where we crossed each others paths and dude was talking about how we were stream sniping him the whole time. I was gonna day GG good fight until I seen him making wild ass accusations. Called him out on his bs in front of thousands of people and got insta banned from his chat. 
---
Fuckem. Streamers are just regular people with egos the size of oceans cause people just blindly follow them and agree with everything they say like sad, lost, little sheep even if they're completely in the wrong.
---
*I felt that*
---
I don't think survivors would catch on to what is happening for the camera that quickly, they can't tell how stalked they are until full and this would only be able to 99% them, Ghostface would still have to manually expose them.
---
To be fair, where does "bad survivor" end and "asshole who is farming" begin? How would you determine that unless someone goes over every reported case?
---
I'm not sure the first would be too good, I like how it currently is, but the second is amazing. Jumpscare ghostface is a dream of mine.
---
I have yet to do the 4 basement kills and I'm dreading it.....
---
Maybe they'll do it for the bloodhunt on the 2nd till the 6th (i want my party starters!!)
---
Oh man that old BT was so nasty. When I look back at the old game it's a miracle any killer got kills.
---
Context: As soon as the SWF group loaded into game and saw it was a Clown they all immediately DC'd. He was going for Adept achievement hence the loadout and I was going for the "heal 5 injured survivors" challenge (hence MY loadout). 
---
We went around and farmed for a bit, but he refused to kill me even when I pointed at basement hook...so I just left. 
---
When you queue as a non 4-man SWF and do this you are literally ruining the game for the other survivors AND the killer. Have some consideration please.
---
I did need it though, my teammates left, the hatch was shut right in front of me, and she was chasing me the whole time.
---
I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS BASEMENT HOOK CHALLENGE DONE THREE TIMES NOW IF NOT FOR PEOPLE INTENTIONALLY DCING AND HIDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP SPECIFICALLY TO STOP ME FROM GETTING IT. FEELSBADMAN
---
*Checks*
---
Well, quit temporarily rather. There's a bit of a gap in his activity on Youtube but he appears to be back in it now. He also is involving his now wife with his YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxIJOh6VJIBtcWdwBoGChAg/videos
---
My gameplay experience says otherwise.  
---
"Gen at shack is 99, he's chasing me to cow tree.  Just passed by Ruin in the jungle gym."  
---
Gen pops.  
---
"I've looped him twice and gonna pallet next loop."  
---
Get survivor before pallet. Ruin pops.  
---
"He's downed me and is taking me to jungle gym."  
---
Survivor attempts to pallet save.  Hook a jungle gym gets sabo'ed.  
---
Two body blocks later and survivor breaks free.  
---
Note: there is exaggeration in this post.  About as much as the one I'm replying to.
---
I CAN'T SAY I BLAME YOU. BECAUSE IT DEFINITELY THROWS THE GAME TO TRY AND SAVE YOU.
---
Yep. I see someone using it, I tunnel and camp them to death ASAP. It's the most annoying perk in the game to play against.
---
I truly want my party starters I only have 60 left!!
---
The unhooker is supposed to come too. Without head hiding in the basement is suicide, better to all run out even if someone gets downed trying to. All the blame hides in the hider not the runner.
---
Darn, just once would I like to see someone here that I saw in-game, I‚Äôve been playing over a year and haven‚Äôt found anyone
---
Anyway yeah if that were me I‚Äôd probably of been bodyblocking for Mettle of man stacks instead of loop baiting.
---
Okay I'm not going to lie why the hell would you leave when the Killer is not to your liking because you want an easy bully?
---
Hopefully the killer takes mercy on you and thinks you guys are adorable. If not then, well...Good Luck Charlie
---
RIP
---
I love you daddy otz
---
You keep me keeping my head up playing killer, thanks for being a role model
---
And amazing job slapping that stack of children, well deserved.
---
Hey I just messaged you. If you need someone to talk through some stuff with please message me back. I‚Äôm not a licensed counselor or anything but I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm a pretty good listener and I‚Äôve gone through some dark shit before. You‚Äôve already taken a step in the right direction by reaching out, but I don‚Äôt think the majority of this particular community will serve you well for issues like this.
---
God leaves it half finished to stare at the garbage fire.
---
yup
---
Found one of the stream snipers
---
That's all matchmaking could find for you at the time. It sucks.
---
nah dude i'm fuckin dumb ya boi aint know shit other than
---
he's on me
---
is he on you
---
did he leave you on hook
---
ahhhhh
---
aauuaahhauua
---
bruh what the fuck he's tunneling (he's not i'm just dumb)
---
its ghostface bet
---
if he leaves me he's a god (i have unbreakable for memeage)
---
why the fuck would he come back and hook me what a bitch (5% from getting back up)
---
just stunned him hah what a dick ez
---
Yeah now the game is just slightly less broken
---
You'd complain if they bent over and did whatever you asked. Face it, you're an ungrateful prick. UNhappy holidays, asshole.
---
Nah thats just hardcore mode.
---
Pretty gud join so far.
---
I think they are all in a party together and the rank 9 is the host of that party causing everyone to be put in a green ranked system game.
---
I‚Äôd say about 2 times per second. You don‚Äôt have to destroy your keyboard or controller button mashing. Just nice and casual.
---
Buffalo bill skin!
---
Not "says me", says the survivor mains on reddit, and SWF groups.
---
Again, you are just new to this sub, and possible YouTube and twitch.
---
i agree its adorable
---
Perfection
---
You don't lose emblem score for being close to the hook if another survivor is nearby.
---
I've never timed out a reverse bear trap, but I have came very close a few times.
---
If this game is making you that upset I recommend you stop playing it.  No matter what people send cruel messages at times and it‚Äôs not worth upsetting you. I wish you the best but this is probably not the best place for this to be posted.
---
Play several games as or against Legion. Come back if you don't figure it out.
---
This is why you set up the power move:
---
-Close hatch
---
-carry to gate
---
-let them open gate
---
-down them when they open it
---
-let them crawl out while you watch
---
It does a few things...
---
-Gives you more points
---
-gives the survivor more points
---
-and establishes in stone that (THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD HERE AND HE/SHE IS LETTING YOU GO OF THEIR OWN VOLITION) 
---
Besides, survivors can‚Äôt teabag if their stuck on the ground.
---
Can mods add the word "matchmaking" to the spam bot like they did with bugs? I am tired of seeing this posts every 10 minutes. I've replied seriously on a bunch of them but can't be bothered anymore.
---
What did chat me is that this game doesn't feel right with the battle pass and my blood pressure can only go up so high
---
Just so you know this will most likely be removed because you did not blur out names
---
That‚Äôs now how it works. Matchmaking for SWF is based on the highest ranking player
---
It will be removed no matter what because screenshots highlighting matchmaking are against the rules as well.
---
Staks
---
I love amanda
---
I agree his pink addons arent great (especially since I hate leaning from cover) but i feel like he's such a strong killer he shouldn't have super op addons. It's nice to have killers where your playstyle or their strentgh isnt determined by pink addons. Ghosty is great because there are so many ways to play him :)
---
If this was on PS4 that was me. I use those same cosmetics, and did this to myself yesterday with a Dwight.
---
In order to be the obsession, someone needs to be running an obsession perk. 
---
For survivors, decisive strike, sole survivor, and object of obsession are all obsession perks (laurie strodes 3 perks). 
---
For killer, play with your food (myers perk), rancor (spirit perk), and nemesis (oni perk) are all obsession perks. (I might be missing one not sure)
---
If any of these are used there is a guaranteed obsession. If not there wont be one. So if you use any of the killer perks you can guarantee it. If not just wait for a survivor to run one. Decisive strike is one of the  most used perks in the game so it shouldn't take long to find a game with one.
---
You have to commit forgery to complete some of them?
---
Basically it's a waste of time to heal against the legion because he can't down you with his power active.
---
Can never find same ranks as killer.
---
As a Ghost Face main, yes
---
It‚Äôs because there‚Äôs not many killers at high ranks and not many survivors around where you are on PS4
---
Boring. 
---
Literally just harder dailies.
---
Writing is pretty meh too. Lore is typical. Nothing feels inspired. Trapper should have definitely been a stripper at some point.
---
I just played a game of killer, literally the survivors never saw each other lol. Place is a fucking maze
---
It is both a blessing and a curse. The most effective way to level up in the battlepass is by doing challenges, but the tome challenges have made players go from playing normal to focusing only on challenges; sometimes players fuck up entire games just to get challenges done, at the very least it incentivezes killers to play shitty with Six Feet Under being a prime example.
---
The perks didn't get changed. Deep Wounds got changed so that Old Legion would not come back.
---
Not going to lie I hate how I was forced to play trapper. Mostly because smart survivors don't fall for advance to typical trap placements and will try their hardest to keep you I'm getting that stupid thing done
---
you lose the potential for more hook progression when they are dead instantly without the chance to attempt.
---
 Go to 7:55 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtl9orvkDVo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtl9orvkDVo) 
---
I agree with the post, but I saw this video a couple days ago and had to do it.
---
Cant wait for the nurse lore....I play on console....
---
Not to mention that I see a lot of survive with friend groups banding together to get these challenges done. Most of them are damn near impossible to do solo for Survivor
---
which ones?
---
Did this just happen or is it from awhile back?
---
Also add a schematic on how to run the tiles. That would be very helpfull.
---
I think there is because I swear The Hag is a dwarf, not just average height, and The Oni looks taller than all other tall Killers unless I'm imagining things. It stands to reason the Killers wouldn't use the same base models with how they're more removed from each other than male and female Survivors are.
---
Appreciating the J Cole references in this thread.
---
Well I hope you enjoy playing her. I also play on console and PC and I already feel my past sins creeping back
---
Salty messages fall under saturated content.
---
Scoops Ahoy seems to guarantee at least an ivory mori. But when I run his sweater, the killers usually seem to be a lot nicer
---
Our lord and savior
---
Take a key and nope the fuck out asap.
---
Yes. I refuse to fix my typo now because now I commit forgery to get my archives done.
---
:)
---
I assume not but the game is so buggy sometimes it does shit like that, you should download and try it out. 
---
It‚Äôs honestly too similar to the real game it‚Äôs unbelievable that the team was able to do what they did with it. It is somewhat broken in some aspects but it‚Äôs practically still in the beta; which is why I assume it‚Äôs not released in NA yet, but I still had to download to try it out because I‚Äôm a big enthusiast of dbd and just wanted to see what it was all about. 
---
All bugs and glitches aside it‚Äôs pretty fun and I suggest all of you who read this do the same and download it; there‚Äôs daily rewards- which might sound weird but it‚Äôs implemented nicely, there‚Äôs multiple daily and weekly rituals that give you items and bp along with auric cells and iridescents. May sound a little weird for dbd, but I think it was the best way they could‚Äôve went around making a mobile game all things considered.
---
Feel free to ask anymore questions about gameplay mechanics an stuff like that, I play daily for the rewards so I‚Äôve gathered a decent amount of info on it.
---
U killed em too nice
---
Honestly I feel like an idiot for buying this darn battle pass. I honestly should have just waited. When it comes down to it I primarily wanted to play it for the lore. However next time if I don't get every single piece of paper I'm just going to say screw it and just go to YouTube and watch it there.
---
The Clown isn't even a good killer..
---
If it makes you feel any better, you're not the first person I've been an IRL Leon Kennedy to.
---
Teach me your ways lmao this is one of the things I haven't figured out yet, I didn't think it was possible on console due to the super low sensitivity they stuck us with
---
So it's not just me who thought Feng was shorter than everyone else then. Also, Nancy. I thought she was really short as well.  I'm struggling to process that all the female Survivors are the same height.
---
I don't really care for it, I play casually, but competitively. I like pipping, and if I depip I'll eventually pip back up. I stay pretty solid in the green ranks. My point is, I don't care for complexity. Gimmie my bloodpoints and I'm satisfied. I could care less about "exclusive" rewards for cosmetics on characters I don't even use. Everyone will have them eventually and I'm sure they'll become purchasable later down the line anyway. It's what all battle passes are, a cash grab.
---
Fucking beautiful
---
i love the way you draw the legion's expressions changing aha
---
Oooh, okay. Thanks for the info! It's taking me awhile to get back into the swing of things
---
At high ranks it was really just the survivor's own hubris that got them killed. Who cares? they would pip anyway.
---
Ah finally some good ducking memes.
---
Don‚Äôt hit the unhooked person then?
---
No problem. If you got any questions feel free to ask me. Been playing for years haha
---
That's what happens when you give anti-tunnel anti-camp perks to coordinated survivors (SWF or not, since they can state perks in pre-game).
---
Instead of punishing their mistakes and getting to apply pressure since you have one or two hooked, you have 3 of them on generators while you're chasing a 4th that you just gave a massive speed boost to, right back where you started.
---
Had one friend scold a toxic swf group and then got banned even though both sides were calling each other names .-.

Never watched Stranger Things but I can definitely say they nailed the pose of Steve in-game.

It's not really great art, so feel free to critique it if you like

Flair checks out

Someone sent me a clip when I was killer of them trying to hide from me asking why I went for them. I honestly told them that I just caught a quick glimpse of them as they were trying to hide. But in the clip they had a friend near by and they walked RIGHT INTO ME WHILE THEY WERE CROUNCHED and I swear to god I never saw them. Watching the clip back just made me think ‚Äúhow oblivious am I?‚Äù I now lose sleep at night wondering if that‚Äôs the first time it‚Äôs happened, or it‚Äôs happened hundreds of times.
---
This is almost Lynchian.
---
This is very disturbing
---
Imagine being able to stalk at all.
---
This post was made by the dedicated servers gang.
---
Or me, who saw some of the challenges and thought ....no thanks. Also I find playing survivor to be REALLY boring.
---
Read the other comments
---
I always had 4th person dissconnecting on my face when I was takin them to the basement...
---
I have a lot of classic looking outfits combined all together.
---
But I really doubt I'll ever find that one pair that uses the same deal as I do. Unless you know, &gt;!impersonating.!&lt;
---
Fucking for real like I had to turn this shit off outta cringe lol
---
You didn't let them bully you! That's a bannable offense. You must let survivors bully you as killer.
---
I don't think about the rift. I just collect my free rewards.
---
I started checking gens before/after I kick them because of this problem.
---
Is it bad that Meg's mask looks just like Susie ones?
---
This is adorable. I love the Trapper's mask. I
---
Which is even more hilarious because they go out of their way to send you these.
---
Thanks for the help. Will make sure to play Oni when I get their
---
Oh no.. why are you like this
---
Leatherface is the most lazy designed killer in the game.. They literally added him to the game just for the sake of having him instead of creating mechanics for him.
---
I run for a few seconds just so he thinks I'm taking this seriously while I watch to see if he's detected anyone else with the deep wound proc, and then if he's not still standing around or following me, I start to mend.
---
Only once I've established that he's just hitting me to stop me from repairing during his 3-gen do I actually start mending immediately. x:
---
I have yet to encounter nowadays a Laurie doing Adept.
---
No, really. I wouldn't even mind to see one but it's more sad that I see opposite results than the obvious one every. single. **TIME.**
---
Imagine fucking disconnecting vs Clown. They're the entire circus.

Rank 4 isnt considered proper red rank.
---
Find someone to play with youll have much more fun. I would but am in EU
---
I did. If you‚Äôre going after other people, BT is not an issue. DS lasting as long as it does has nothing to do with people unhooking quickly, although I do think if someone works on a gen, the perk should deactivate since they‚Äôre clearly not being tunnelled. But in general DS and BT have 0 effect on my matches other than in end game, if someone is playing with those perks vs me they essentially have 2 perks because I have no interest in going after someone who was just unhooked
---
What having fun as a non-meta killer. How could someone do that. We must tea bag at the exit gates if we win or report him because only meta killers can win matches
---
2nd one is OP. Would be fair if you still lost shroud on hit. Having no terror radius/red stain indefinitely makes chases unfair, and completely turns off Borrowed Time.
---
Thank you for reminding me.
---
No Mither, Stake Out, This is Not Happening and maybe Technician? 
---
It still works like a charm with No Mither as well, if you're used to Unnerving Presence skill checks.
---
One of my favorite moments of me playing bubba is at the beginning of the match (so they didn't know who i was) i went to my ruin and someone was cleansing it and another survivor was bodyblocking to protect him, it was glorious, they didn't even get my ruin. :)
---
You don't play - you farm and you wait for farmers.
---
How does a team fail this bad lol then reported to try to save themselves the embarrassment smh
---
That is amazing I live for those moments
---
You must slow play a lot then, because DS is still very relevant without tunnelling. And the issue with BT isn't just "hit the other person", the problem is survivors no longer give a fuck about hook pressure and can undo a hook very fast with it. They're fully healed so they're not in danger and neither is the person with BT. They get a free save and your pressure is nullified.
---
I'm going to have to disagree with you, I wrote this as a killer main and they made a major mistake doing that.
---
Yes, they escaped. Injured and with only 2 perks (unknown perks) that could still be applied positively.
---
That game ended in a 3k with Jane escaping through the door.
---
The next time those first 2 people go on hooks next and they can't use that combo as effectively, if you know what they're using.
---
I JUST PLAYED A GAME FOR THE 5 TRAP CHALLENGE DOING THIS EXACT STRAT AND GOT ABOUT 8 OR 9 TRAPS BY THE TIME THE GAME WAS OVER. WAS HAPPY, BUT FUCKING SALTY THAT I COULDN‚ÄôT HAVE BEEN DOING THE  6 TRAP CHALLENGE INSTEAD
---
WGLF, No Mither, self care, unbreakable. 
---
Gg.
---
Not having a red stain doesn‚Äôt mean that much, every killer can get rid of there‚Äôs by just turning around.
---
You don't need to be injured for the challenge to be completed. You're best bet would becoming very immersed and waiting to get tokens and working on gens like normal.
---
They all had Toolboxes... I think it's more illegal that they didn't report themselves instead of you.
---
Happy cake day
---
Let me guess, they didn't share any Christmas treats with you? Because they were sour.
---
It's fucking awful. I'm burnt out on it just like you. The challenges are obnoxious and are ruining DBD gameplay. DCs left and right. People going out of their way to deny the challenge (Running cut coin and bodyblocking basement chest, DCing before you can throw them on the basement hook, etc.) and it's just awful since the grind is so goddamn slow.
---
I'm not buying the next rift pass unless they make massive changes to it.
---
Same with the vial it swirls slowly :) awesome small details are the coolest
---
New perk allows you to take 48% of the survivors' annual income. They kill themselves.
---
You mean how you jab your chainsaw right through their back with the final swing, but nothing happens?
---
Loss=Report
---
No red stain means timing Dead Hard and pallet stuns is much harder. And no, killers can't "just turn around" because the time that the stain matters is when you're just about to go for the hit, so you need to aim.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
iirc his movement speed addons make such a small difference its really not worth it
---
No Mither, Self-Care, Solidarity, Inner Strength.
---
OoO, Windows Of Opportunity, Sprint Burst, Diversion.
---
It‚Äôs still kinda annoying to get moried
---
üëç
---
"Wow, nice cosplay! Can I take a pho--"
---
\*SPRINT BURST\*
---
I haven't played hag ever since I got adept what are they?
---
No I know, and I think DS needs changes like I mentioned. Them unhooking quickly is usually a good thing imo because you can get another quick down while the injured person self cares in a corner or goes to look for someone to heal them, and then someone else needs to get off a gen to go unhook the guy who unhooked, or even better if they‚Äôre just waiting nearby doing nothing and waiting for the save. I do agree that the invincibility DS gives you is totally unfair if the killer genuinely isn‚Äôt tunnelling, but I would much rather leave the unhooked person and put pressure on the other survivors anyway.
---
Ewww otz fuckboi
---
But did I really get downvoted for saying I check all 4 sides of a gen after kicking it?
---
The Killer has even simple but doable add-on combo.
---
Although apparently? And apparently folks don't like Clown because he is the same annoying level of Doctor and Legion. But Clown himself uses projectiles and you can simple avoid by looking where he is gonna aim. I have witnessed experienced players who even outclass his tonics.
---
Long story short: SWF can always spoil a single match.
---
Guess, you didn't get downed enough against Kenneth to be convinced he can destroy you in close quarters with or without his tonic. &gt;!Intense coughing!&lt;
---
GG baby killer
---
It can also be really easy depending on what killer they are playing as well considering the noticeable fps drops with certain ones.
---
Exactly what I did. Urban Evaded whenever the killer got near for easy Stake Out stacks which converted into easy Great Skillchecks.
---
Damn good job, any tips? Nearly got this on my first try as peekaboo hag on pale rose, but the third survivor caught on and ran into the far corner of the map then went afk, then dcd when I got them close. Had something similar happen every time I get close.
---
This was from a while ago, yeah.
---
How did they get like no points?
---
This meme is magnifique üëåüëåüëå
---
It's not as hard as you think, I mained this game on PC (3k hours), so I already knew I'd get use to it quickly on ps4. Just takes some practice.
---
Impressive
---
I'm more concerned and still am how you get to rank up without proper rank pools. Just skipping few pips ahead or below makes you regret even daring.
---
Yes and no, I've done it against every killer so far, but the fps on killer pov is insane at times. That I agree with. But still satisfying to do with a controller lol.
---
I mean he wasnt being hostile either.
---
As the other post said I would‚Äôve had it around 5 times by now but they always dc once they figure out what I‚Äôm doing I‚Äôd assume ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Brother its literally some fat sweaty sending you those messages. Who the fuck goes out of their way to get on another account to harass someone. Someone with little promise in life someone sad and lonely. He's probably closer to jumping off a bridge than you. Not that he should but hes not normal
---
I kinda regret buying the premium pass on advance. Now I‚Äôm stressing to complete it.
---
I‚Äòm not a big fan of the challenges but I‚Äôm just trying to get through it to get my money back. 
---
I doubt I‚Äôll be buying it again if they don‚Äôt change things.
---
They did not boop the snoot. They have insulted the snoot.
---
Never said that he was being hostile, unlike him stating that he was being nice soooo
---
Wow you sure showed them
---
I'd like to mention that I personally think it's really odd how well Hillbilly fits into that lobby... The nickname gets shown, he doesn't look bugged add all and even the name of the killer is casually being shown. If I wouldn't know DbD I would think thats a normal part of the game
---
20 times per millisecond or else you die
---
I can't believe what I said got downvoted. He's a bottom 5 killer.
---
Now this is the quality content I come to this sub for.
---
Replace WGLF with Inner Strength and you'll have a true Gg
---
Thank you!
---
You're missing the point, it's not that fast saves are always the play, but BT means survivors no longer have to play carefully around the hook because they know they can get their friend out regardless.
---
I'm aware. But I meant using No Mither for great skill check zones being wider with This is not happening.
---
Regardless, do how you please really.
---
True. But to be fair, i'd take he was being pretty friendly. The tone is pretty clear.
---
Why do that when you can just camp the hook then complain about BT?
---
Cuz hes the one that didnt dc? Idk this whole post is stupid
---
This fucked up my whole childhood.
---
Eh agree to disagree. Imo you can‚Äôt really expect everyone to see that as being friendly
---
Demogorgon being the tallesr if not hunched over? Wow. Bigboi Dart over here.
---
Sometimes when youre performing a hook action rbt doesnt go off
---
I'm stressing getting them all done and there's like 18 days left and I have queue times that are super long, like I could watch whole seasons while waiting.
---
They used a Shroud of Union to blow their BNPs on the same gen so they were all grouped up. Grouped up + Oni = :)
---
I feel like, it's probably a lot if you have to ask that.
---
I've grown to be so incredibly confident with it that unless I know 100% that the killer saw me I'll just crouch behind it and almost every time it ends up paying off.
---
I feel. Especially the ones that will take a few games. Like the basement 4k.
---
I woke up and decided to vent with art.
---
Obviously. But to me tone is clear. See however you like to though.
---
You're mad enough to comment twice on this post. You realise there's a giant list of reasons why a killer would be within 32 meters of a hook.
---
Spoiler alert if I see you sitting 5 meters away in plain sight, I'm probably not gonna go look at gens.

Tbf me and me team do the last second switch of character because we all main claudette and killers always DC when they see us

Entitled piece of shit. Pisses me off yo. You could have said you didnt feel like farming though imo, but hes still the asshole no doubt.
---
I swear this whole thing is just an effort to make people make friends and do swf. I don't need friend Behavior!
---
the things he said were horrible. it also sucks to have multiple party streamers or even an escape cake and get 12,000 bloodpoints while the killer gets 200,000. doesn't give him the right to tell someone those kind of things though.

No a survivor was hooked there and dead but you can still her here on the hook.
---
Or pull the plug. Because they think cutting the cable would do any difference.
---
Good shit lol. I tried to pick up my flashlight the other day and accidentally dropped the pallet it was under, then tried to vault the pallet and picked up the flashlight. Took a hit in the process, then tried to vault the pallet and got grabbed.... so I guess the polar opposite of what happened here
---
yea its my own hair and its to dark

after i was done taking pictures i noticed i have a fitting wig but oh well.. xD

I‚Äôm still kinda pissed that all the good anime get cancelled. Why cant HunterxHunter have hundreds of episodes like One Piece?

Hmm it didn't seem to, but maybe I missed something. I'll do some testing

&gt;!impressive!&lt;

Lmao it scared the shit out of me
---
Don't need to pay child support if you only go for the same sex.
---
As long as the killer isn't Russian I've been getting pretty consistent killers who give me hatch as Elf Dwight. Might just be my new main..
---
Literally me
---
mr 10 below

Do you remember what happened that match? Was the killer the Hillbilly? Was it a 3-man game with 2 killers?

I get that just gonna have to jump on the manga, it is one of my favorite anime‚Äôs of all time though if not my favorite. Jojo is also up there for me. As well as full metal alchemist.
---
I don't mind it, but they need to really reconsider how they handle master challenges. Six Feet Under promotes camping and isn't fun for anyone. It's almost impossible to get without camping basements, even if you're exceptionally good at the game.
---
It sure spooked me lol.
---
I got tunneled by a NOED spirit last game I played, I ran them around for quite a while and they seemed to slug for no apparent reason at the time.
---
Turns out she needed 2 endgame sacrifices for archives
---
HOLY SHIT
---
Do other survivors see you as floating or your regular self?
---
If anyone is wondering, DCs count as kills for the "sacrifice all 4 survivors in one trial" challenge.
---
So if you were to say... go in as instadown huntress. You can finish it really quickly :)
---
No worries. The Archives are not time limited. The only thing that is time limited is The Rift!
---
Spongebozz &amp; patrik bang

His account name is Ochido22 at least it was like that when he started on ps4
---
I once played against him and just tunnel him after he went with his flashlight crazy...
---
SO WAIT, IT IS FIVE HOOKS NOT FIVE DIFFERENT SURVIVORS ?  GREAT
---
Nah my internet conked out at the start of the game, I assume only I can see it.
---
Fair enough lmao. I feel bad when someone calls me a "facecamper" when I just hooked someone and they run up to the hook and wait for me to hit them when I'm just wanting a yoink. But then I remembered, they didn't have the patience to have me leave the area in the first place and wanted to do it infront of me.
---
Would of thought Oni would be taller considered he looked huge in the trailer.

More like when you finally find a gen

Well done to the demo!

I told people that I was playing nurse and got like 2 4ks so if anything this is bragging more than me

Tru3 kept seeing the same people (he checked SteamID),  always with items and builds that countered his killer and perks.

Inorite? This is a guy who only has 245 hours played in DBD too. I checked his profile and he's got Adept achievements for almost every killer. Clown is one of the last ones he needs. Poor dude.

---
This comment was made by the bing-bong gang
---
What I'm saying is that afking and suiciding shouldn't be punished. Forcing survivors to play a match theyt don't want to play will make the game a lot worse. They need to balance the game, address why people are DCing and suiciding on hook, then start implementing punishments for leaving. Do you get what I'm trying to say?
---
I think so.
---
It's a great skill check and you get the 150 points for hitting it.
---
Haven't tested it yet, but I think that should work.
---
5? Trapper, huntress, hillbilly, nurse and demo

You know stream sniping is officially not a banable offence right?

bone slap the beef
---
Try to say the same thing in any other online pvp game in 2019
---
Rainbow six siege just puts you on 30min ban for the first offense alone. Any moba do the same and in fighting games too, some try to be creative but still punish who DC, no matter what
---
Stop crying about a system they are trying to implement that is *A STANDARD FEATURE* in any other game but DbD
---
No, it‚Äôs that no one can be banned for stream sniping. Reported some racist guy a while ago and stream-sniping was in the list of things that are allowed, next to body-blocking and camping.
---
It is on console dunno about pc
---
They count, just wanting to make sure you saw the other reply to this comment.
---
Can confirm myself too, got them on a Ruin match where it was never cleaned.
---
To have an hour ban you have to disconnect 4 times in a row. You totally deserved that if you did
---
Still, the bugs that kick you out of the game are very, very rare tbh. Plus they are testing now and the time probably is gonna be adjusted
---
Anyway you say you don't defend who DC but at the same time criticize a system that's a standard and in any other online game these days. So what? Try to tell **anyone** the same thing in another game, they'll laugh at you
---
There's a problem with queue times? It's not related to DC punishments at all, so why even bring it up? It's like pointing out a buggy vault and point out the movement speed of the hag in DbD terms. Those two things aren't related at all
---
That's what she said!
---
‚ÄúNo, Spirit, your hair does NOT count for height
---
great job Scott
---
If they put lights on the hooks they'd somehow screw up something completely unrelated.
---
&gt; which should be expected since the game lets you queue with friends
---
I agree. The game is not designed to have that kind of information, though. It completely shifts the balance towards the survivor side.
---
LMAO you ain‚Äôt never lied
---
Obsession is the safest person in the game and gets bonus points for it
---
getting tunneled for once is a small price
---
Cool
---
Did she have add-ons to increase the speed? Or was that the last jigsaw box? Either way nice, I thought fs tho you were gonna die last second lol
---
Tbh they should just do what Dota does. After a certain number of reports/DC's you get sent to the low priority queue, and only get matched with other toxic individuals in the same punishment. 
---
How to get out from low prioritywould be different in dbd, but in Dota you have to get 3-5 wins.
---
Poor Wraith is being forgotten...
---
You're talking about a group of people who tryhard a part of the game so simple that chimps could do it.
---
It makes them feel better about themselves when mommy throws their fingerpainting in the trash for being so crappy.
---
On PC you get Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse and huntress. But then with stranger things you get demogorgon so you get 6 overall
---
It hurts me. I know what they said but like, this isn‚Äôt a new event? It‚Äôs not even an event. It‚Äôs lights. It‚Äôs party starters. How wicked hard would that be?? 
---
But yes it was supposed be at the end of fall, well fall is over tomorrow.   So what if they say well here‚Äôs our holiday event and dedicated servers (yeah right)
---
Yep, and you don‚Äôt need to be injured for them to count either.
---
Ah, always..
---
She had the box of crates and the tampered timer addons, and that was the last box. You can literally hear the activation beep the second I pull it off aha
---
Your logic is so flawed I feel embarrassed for you
---
&gt;they made a big mistake calling it punishments. nobody wants to get punished.
---
No shit Sherlock, so what? Also thieves don't wanna get caught but they try to steal for a reason or another thinking to don't be caught
---
&gt;and adding a timer at the bottom causes more negativity towards the game
---
How? Any recent game have that but only here I see people like you defending who DC. Weird huh
---
&gt;They should have call it timeout, and enforced an imaginary timeout timer so the survivor will be unaware if they r timeout or waiting to join a lobby...
---
What? No. They have to understand why and acknowledge the timer exist. If you are unaware of being punished you won't correct your behavior, you learn this shit in middle school
---
It's pointless to make it unaware as well as changing it's name just to appease 12yo kids. This game is 18+ and you should be well aware of the consequences of your actions by then.
---
You'll be laughed at even harder in any other game subreddit, but here people are weirdly defensive towards DC. Maybe because they wanna still abuse a flaw in the system, pike a certain streamer deranked daily from red ranks to rank 12 and endorsed it. That's sad
---
F
---
I tried this...and the add on didn't work???
---
Is it bugged? It still came out as cone, although range extension worked...
---
Literally every killer seem to be bugged in one way or another :/
---
These size comparisons look a bit off...
---
Not only do Hex skill checks count, but so does Stake Out - As it turns the Good skill checks into Great skill checks.
---
I only kill myself on first hook if my teammates are being dickbags. 
---
Were they just upset they got found first? Some people rage quit if they get downed a minute into a match since they think the rest of the trial will go badly.
---
&gt;!Rejoice hxh broke 1k on dbd!&lt;
---
As said as it is, that's what we got.
---
They are being pretty greedy (battle pass, constant cosmetics sales without events etc) but won't bother to even do a little thing to improve their dev team
---
Coders are literally monkeys and now they have the money to hire better people but I guess bananas are cheaper
---
They could easily do a little thing, some lights and take back some old thing but they won't. Like they didn't for this summer
---
That aint him. Those are clips from other people
---
I've done it with Myers and were glad that right in the first game, someone used a "the game" offering ..
---
Hey, just checking your ability to type because nowhere in your original comment did you mention any type of comparison. Go back to kindergarten, sperg.
---
Urgh, I hate players who can't loose for sheit.
---
Yes, I understand one hates certain maps and killers and killer perks (I hate all the indoor maps, for example. Can't navigate them for shit) but duh. If a killer kills me, they have more skill and a bit more luck than I do.
---
You mean Snow Miser?

Or do we have to go through the song again? Please don't make us go through the song again, I can't take it anymore.

So we have to fear going for the unhooked person when the survivors are clearly acting cocky? Sorry to say, but having virtualy no penalty for going for insta saves is bs, the killer can't do anything that rivals this strategy because they don't have the same perks that fix their mistakes like survivors do.
---
This fixes it, surprisingly enough
---
That's because he's ALWAYS at hide.
---
God, I just completed grab levels. I literally went sweaty and struggled with those fake grabs for 4 matches. These servers are better killer than me.
---
You can't try and convince me that Dead by Daylight is a gorey game. There's only a couple of moris and they're on par with the shit done in supernatural easily.
---
Yeah but this game mode is priceless. But I'm not against another, can't imagine what it would entail.
---
stop saying the banning shit is standard, it's not even in 50 games and there's millions of games out there. it's never been standard, but i'm guessing you're some dumb teen who hasn't played a lick of games across other platforms, so that kind of justifies your ignorance
---
You still have to respect a 115% killer with no power to a degree.
---
Legion's problem is he stalls games fairly well, but sucks at closing them out.  And high rank survivors are so good at powering through gens in no time at all that his ability to stall basically can't even kick in in time, and at high ranks, the survivors know not to waste 12-16(24/32 overall impact) seconds healing up when that is 12-16 seconds of 2 people of gen pressure they could apply.
---
Honestly, Legion's power should probably down injured people BUT not if they are Deep Wounded, and Killer Instincts not trigger on injured survivors, only healthy ones.
---
This gets him tools to find healthy survivors and apply pressure to them, but injured survivors couldn't disrespect him because he will down them if they do so.  From here, just take something small away from legion (Killer Instincts working on people in lockers for instance.  Extremely non-intuitive for survivors especially after they specifically made it so lockers blocked aura vision perks/mechanics), and he'd probably be quite healthy overall.
---

My friend with the original Xbox one has this problem.   I have a Xbox one S with a 2 TB SSD and it gets loud and hot when I‚Äôve been playing for a while but not to the point where it shuts off. 
---
The thing my buddy did/does to fix it is stick the vacuum on the exhaust holes and try to suck as much stuff out as he can, it‚Äôs usually good for him for about 2 months after then repeat but we both know he just needs a new Xbox. 
---
Try to maybe get an external attachment to cool it down, or something you stick it on to get better cooling I‚Äôm sure you could pound something for the ps4 like that on Amazon. Hope I helped a lil but there‚Äôs not a whole lot you can do in this situation besides just find ways to keep it as cool as it can be while it‚Äôs running dbd so you can still play. gl
---
Kinda sad when you think about Bill. The level of teamwork and bonding in L4D is much higher than in this game. Both in-universe and in gameplay mechanics.
---
I remember the other day I was playing against a Wraith and while I was running off to another jungle gym I readjusted my grip and accidently clicked the crouch button twice. Looked like I gave him a quick teabag. Felt so bad lol
---
Just adding extra tokens could work also but I think it should be more than 5. Maybe 6
---
I bought deathgarden for the mask
---
Illiteracy and incompetence does that to me.
---
Or you could run whispers and slightly lower that number
---
It made me jump. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that.

Hope you find something that works I assume I‚Äôll eventually have to do the same thing eventually so lmk if you do end up getting something that works. My Xbox has been screaming and gettin real hot but until it completely overheats I‚Äôm not bothering; still got like like 2 months left on my Xbox warranty, dbd just makes my Xbox run sound and give off heat like its overclocked or sum it‚Äôs definitely weird.
---
Ah yes, survivors - the killers nobody see coming.
---
Cringe
---
I would like more original killers but I won't complain if we get Jason, Pennywise, T-800, Jack or any other movie killer. as at the end of the day licence content will bring in the most money.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted to see the other guys point of view to see how well I played on their end but I never get that lucky :(
---
What happened to her legs tho?
---
For those of you struggling with this one, here‚Äôs another strategy you can try. Got the challenge done first try with this (revised version of a comment I made previously):
---
Use Trapper, Agitation, Iron Grasp, Deerstalker, BBQ and Chili.
---
(Optional) Get a trapper bag and coils for setting speed.
---
(Optional) Offer the hazy reagent to make it harder to see traps.
---
Find the basement ASAP, don‚Äôt even start a chase until you find it. Set up traps around the walls and the window and the immediate surrounding area - ESPECIALLY pallets. Don‚Äôt place a trap on the doorways/stairs to the basement.
---
If you can, try to push the survivors to repair all the gens except the 3 closest gens to the basement. If you can 3-gen them, the challenge is basically yours.
---
Once you hook someone in the basement, the rest will follow soon, use BBQ to find where they‚Äôre coming from. Having fast trap-setting speed helps for when someone manages a basement save; just go to the top of the stairs and place a trap and bodyblock for the hit.
---
Once you get 2 people on the hooks, make absolute sure you slug the 3rd survivor, drag them to the basement but don‚Äôt hook them, and then go find the 4th. Last thing you want is to sacrifice 3 survivors in the basement then have the last one escape through hatch.
---
And that‚Äôs it. Keep in mind you can‚Äôt go braindead for this challenge - even though this strategy makes it tremendously easier, you still gotta hustle for the basement hooks.
---
This strategy also works for the ‚Äúhook 6 survivors in the basement in one trial‚Äù challenge.
---
I'll def let ya know but seriously be careful man about the overheating because I'm already afraid my ps4 may have suffered some sort of damage sue to the game heating it up like crazy so often
---
I like it, but at the same time Ghost Face Caught On Tape is my favorite add-on for him and I wouldn't like seeing it changed.
---
Forehead is on point Damn.
---
I like how it kinda implies Claudettes are babies, but Doctors are even bigger babies.
---
&gt; still people who find nothing more enjoyable than ruining the match for others
---
This is very prevalent in EU from a specific eastern area
---
Lets keep making memes about how trash leatherface is so the devs might rework him.
---
Imagine having to walk to generators
---
This post was made by the Nurse gang.
---
Nah it's not nearly as bad as you say it is. Only way I see this being strong is the sloppy thana nurses build, and even then I'd rather have stalk if I'm playing serious.
---
I am in this picture and I don't like it
---
Disagree with your mom makes you top-tier?
---
Let me know if it works my dude
---
Imagine survivors just pip no matter what and killers actually have to earn their shit! this comment made by the killer gang!
---
And this is why I stopped playing DbD. Being in high rank as a killer is no more an horror game but a run in circle simulator. As a survivor, your choice of perk is pretty asepticized around the ¬´¬†I must waste the killer a maximum of time¬†for my team to pop 3 gens while I‚Äôm taking him for a stroll¬†¬ª. Not really fun too for someone who likes to be stealthy and tries to stick the perks to the character description.
---
Some additional advice if the system is a few years old the thermal paste on the processor may need replacing and the fans may need a good deep clean. Plenty of step by steps online.
---
Or if you are not confident enough maybe spend a few bucks at a local repair place.
---
I know this is the only game that gives you the problem but this is also not normal behaviour of a PS4 pro.
---
Wow... is it possible we‚Äôre all the same people
---
You don't speak sarcasm, huh?
---
I love thisüòÇ
---
"supposed to"; yea? Where is the requirement handbook on that kiddo? Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses....your weakness is arrogance; not knowing how to admit when you are wrong...prob the worse weakness of them all. But go ahead and tell me how you consistently hit 75% of your skill checks because I guarantee you that you dont.
---
Similar thing happened to me the other day, two survivors teabagging at an exit gate against me as ghost face, I 99  and turn away waiting for my power to recharge then I just turn around and get one of them down, one gets out and the other goes on a hook right In front of the gate, it felt so good
---
Happy cAke day my dude
---
What about if for each totem you break it adds a token?
---
Crush my Christmas spirit why don‚Äôt you
---
Sorry what does this habe to do with dbd?
---
I did this with Furtive, Make Your Choice, and Nemesis. It was fun to constantly one-shot and hook my obsession who couldn't hear me coming.
---
Nope, you gotta pay for those ones
---
its cool
---
Well that is jobby
---
Look at my awesome Meg cosplay! Give up votes now
---
I can see why they DC. Nobody wants to play against 4 Blendettes. Blendette games are so boring.
---
Thats why im asking. Noed is for punishing gen rushing and ruin is to stop
---
My man Scott. I recently discovered you on YouTube and you are awesome for what you do. Seeing this makes me laugh at their stupidity.
---
Mark needs to be a survivor, it would be my dream to Mori him every chance I got.
---
Yea? Then quote me dumbfuck. Because I guarantee you that is not what was said. Its what YOU WANTED it to say...stupid fucking kid. BTW do you not know what quotations are? Because that second statement didnt come from my writing...lol, pathetic zoomer piece of shit...please go slap your english teacher in the face and tell that bitch to start doing her job better...just pathetic...unless being pathetic is a natural attribute of yours. Lololol. Nah, kid...assholes are little shits like you who have dogshit parents and didnt learn respect.
---
None of us play blendette- i play bright green tshirt and purple trousers and my friends use the blight skin so we are all pretty visible. Just happens we all started as claudette
---
Sometimes, if you‚Äôre really soundwhoring, you can hear them move around and breathe
---
People always go on about stream sniping the killer but is it even possible? Like how do u know who the killer is until the end?
---
We've had entire map and power reworks, constant bug fixes with every patch, the archives (which are entirely possible to access without paying a cent), dedicated servers and so on. These things take a \*lot\* of time, and they warned us beforehand that they wouldn't have time or resources to create events because they're pouring it all into what we've had so far
---
Just because something doesn't work first time (it rarely does) doesn't mean they don't care. If they really didn't care, they would just consider the game finished and focus solely on releasing new content
---
He's a good boy.
---
Good job.
---
The hilarity of having: 
---
1) A full team of SWF 
---
2) Object of obsession
---
3) Stream sniping to know exactly where &amp; what the killer is doing at all times.
---
AND STILL LOSING is 100% perfection. Then to have the audacity to call the killer &amp; random people in chat toxic. What a bunch of losers.
---
Say this on Facebook and I will say this again, you have the Meg's face. Stunning sister!
---
I'm not funny, I'm cynical
---
No mither, this is not happening, resilience, prove thyself. I was zooming through those ruin checks
---
I don‚Äôt do any of these things on either side but I don‚Äôt see the comparison. A tunneling killer ruins the game for one survivor, a teabagging survivor isn‚Äôt preventing a killer from doing anything.
---
I feel like most players wouldn't use that exploit but maybe I'm just being optimistic
---
I feel like that'd be too easy to get tokens back
---

God, this takes me back to the shitfest this sub was a year ago, all the gangs and tiny Billy
---
Mind if I ask what the reason you're not doing that is? You only need one other person to get into a custom game, and you can specify the maps.
---
got a link to the leak?
---
random cosmetics don't count
---
360 should not exist in my opinion. This is supposed to be an horror game not tony hawk pro skater.
---
Bullshit. I use the vasectomy perk.
---
I had a Jeff with Urban Evasion on a corn map this week. I was so confused how that big guy managed to hide from me so often, but he did it and even managed to open the exit as the last one standing. 
---
He also made chases very difficult. The scratch marks would bait me and I just couldn't find him around where they stopped.
---
I really don't like dealing with stealthy survivors, especially if they're Blendettes, but I had some sort of grudge-respect for that Jeff.
---
It would depend on the map and if you could find any or if people broke them already. There's about 5 totems per map and sometimes I go games without seeing more than 2. ü§∑üèª was just a thought.
---
I mean if it works üòÖü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The only god is made of wood and is in the killer shack
---
ok ! good to know
---
Oh I don‚Äôt blame you for using a technique that exists ! I just stated you it should not be possible to do this as it looks very sketchy.
---
Not saying it‚Äôs a good OR bad idea, but how would this balance it, from your perspective?
---
Dull or not. With the recent buff in blood points and a new perk, they are gonna cleanse any Totem regardless.
---
Well either way your input is much appreciated
---
SOMEONE JUST FUCKING STAND STILL AND LET ME BLIND YOU WHILE YOU'RE CARRYI G A SURVIVOR. 8VE BEEN DOING THIS CHALLENEG FOR A FUCKING WEEK JUST LET ME DO IT OH MY HOD
---
Those windows reward anyone with two brain cells by being unchasable because the window sucks.
---
I like the way you see legion, half survivor, half killer
---
imagine getting offended by flashlights so you ruin 3 other people‚Äôs game
---
Man that sounds horrible and I'm sorry you went through that. When I see that kinda stuff as a killer I will tunnel the shit out of the assholes and let the bullied one leave. It's not right to ruin the game for other people, regardless of the reasoning.
---
They could've been farmin rift challenges.
---
Because if you need to open 12 chests, why tf would you stick in a match if all of them are open? 
---
Pips don't matter, so do BPs.
---
BHVR really didn't think this through IMO.
---
How to counter (generel advice): If the unhooker is there, attempt to grab him. If you hit him, just hit him again to get him. Its a 1-1 trade that way. If there are multiples: Do as much damage as you can since they most likely will unhook with borrowed time and have DS (ALWAYS ASSUME THAT).
---
If you have a killer that can enter stealth, do it just before the unhook to prevent borrowed time to activate. 
---
Remember, they still need to heal what you hurt them, so you gain more time if you can injure them. After all, thats fewer people on gens, which is what you want.
---
Pm me if you have a special situation, i can help you.
---
&gt;True. Noed is just annoying as fuck to deal with and feels cheap to use.
---
Not really. At least from my experience. When you are new to the game sure but when you understand how the mechanic works, you breeze through NOED most of the time.
---
Bamboozle, path it to the killers advantage, use a killer that makes it difficult to consistently be uncatchable it just simply move onto a different target and catch then out in the later stages of the game... many ways to counter it
---
Well.... Billy(from stranger things) kinda is the same Billy from Dbd, he sprints with a car instead of a chainsaw
---
my friend did this to me the other night lol. it was bullshit but he literally found the key in a box and found hatch during chase so all i could do was laugh
---
Replace ruin with corrupt intervention.
---
Yeah, he just tried to annoy him as much as he can.
---
They should've made them passive and not require to select specific one.
---
It's not fun and makes people throw games more often than not.
---
After my PC died I‚Äôve been playing on console until I can afford to rebuild. Really missing macros
---
Try to find a smart survivor at the ironworks window with wraith. Doesnt change how bs the window is. Bamboozle should cure bad map design. You hit someone and with the sprint burst from getting hit they can make it to the window.
---
Looks like a driver problem. Try reinstalling, upgrading or downgrading to see if it fixes.
---
I used a green mori for the Unnerving Presence challenge, got Ormond as the Trapper. I didn't have any slowdown perks since I only play killer for a week, gens got done very quickly but I still hooked everyone. When they powered the gates and I saw that I wouldn't get the challenge because three people were alive, I downed and morid David,who tbagged all the game and he still had the audacity to stay till the end of the match and say that I'm a trash killer who depends on noed and moris. Those guys actually let Feng die on second hook while I intentionally was on the other side of the map and I'm still the bad guy in the end.
---
Hayden the DC ‚Äúpunishments‚Äù were tested, failed miserably, caused a matchmaking chaos and will never be adopted. Embarrassed or sad...facts r facts...DCers will always be DCing ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù or not and pausing them from playing the game will never change their character. Did I DC during the trial period? I did not. How? I refused to participate/play the game during this period as I found their approach idiotic (my opinion respected or not). The use of the word ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù satisfied the majority of killers who complained about it and behaviour sugar coated and served it to them :) A DbD community where all players have a pure catholic mentality like urs will never exist. DBD will never be a ‚Äúbuild a wall around it‚Äù game and filter the DCers out from it. 
---
Have a great Christmas Holidays and see you on my next stupid post &lt;3 xoxo
---
Hans
---
Everyone being 1 shot for free isnt a breeze. It's a breeze as killer though. Try some objectivity.
---
This is a horrible idea. Oh, you want BBQ? Better play 100 games with Leatherface. And you better hope you're good with him, or it might take you 300 games instead.
---
Now imagine you want to try a new character, but you're purple ranks. Now you're playing a level 1 character with a bunch of, most likely, level 50s. So you do poorly with your single perk, which means you get little experience, which means it takes longer to level the character up.
---
Does any of that sound fun to you?
---
I'm saying they shouldn't be run. Its bs. But people do that's the problem. But then those same people would complain when they are moried.
---
Windows? You mean those things that keep survivors alive? And not just survivors doing gens the whole game? You mean to tell me they should stand still ***GASP***
---
I can say some windows can be a pain, but I can think of maybe 3. But 2 are nothing now with the balanced landing nerf. 
---
NOED isn‚Äôt broken at all. Do bones. 
---
Mori‚Äôs arent even that common and so what? 
---
I‚Äôve yet to hear that their needs to be be a safe place for survivors? If one person said it, then why make a post about it? I promise not more than 5 people have.  And everywhere is a ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù if you don‚Äôt get caught.   Honestly, there‚Äôs a safe place in Lerys in middle upstairs. And many other places. 
---
This post don‚Äôt make much sense to me, I‚Äôm sorry
---
Sorry man i really hate to see people like this, if you ever wanna play i‚Äôm always down. I would legit save you even if the killer had noed haha. Message me so we can play! but just know things will always get better i promise. Stay strong
---
They did so good with both of them, no wait, all 3.
---
Hex perks are supposed to be high risk high reward if you wanna use it you have to accept the consequences.
---
Don't think so, It also happened to my friend. Plus it's usually around the screen and comes as an effect not rigid spots
---
it's on Xbox
---
We get huntress tho, you guys don't get her do you? She's pretty damn good on pc
---
That's not true. There aren't many, but there are a few broken window loops still around. The slaughterhouse woodwind map is one example. In room with the gen, if the window is open on the side there it's impossible to catch a survivor if they loop that spot. Not to mention its cold wind, so even if you do chase them 3 loops for the block on the window, on the 3rd loop, you can just run to a nearby jungle gym and go right back. Macmillan has a few of these examples as well. It's broken as hell. I've been saying it for years and every time I mention it I get downvoted and flamed to oblivion.
---
Agreed!
---
I think doing (safe) unhooks for tokens is a good idea, it also helps to dissuade from playing just safe/immersed, and you can't get too many that way
---
You're entilted much huh? ''Console players can suck dick and play with him, but not on mine PC yard, that is not okay'' Christ man, what the fuck? He should be banned from both platforms.
---
Got her too lol
---
I mean the maps need a slight overhaul honestly but the community will abuse them till the end of time
---
All we did was say gg :c
---
Until the last panel I was expecting it to say "this meme was brought to you by tru3talent"
---
I'm all for it but it would have to be a paragraph since I don't see them doing a survivor-only chapter since there's no one in Supernatural that would suit the killer role. One could argue in favor of Azazel or Lucifer but I really don't see that happening.
---
Also there's no place in Supernatural that would work as a map. Hell or the Bunker mayyybe but I don't think so.
---
But regardless it would be cool to get a Supernatural paragraph with Sam or Dean as a survivor. My vote would go to Dean.
---
4th or 6th try?
---
Hes talking about the near infinites that are still remaining. Like the slaughterhouse coldwind map. That window that can be open in the slaughterhouse is a near infinite, with jungle gyms guaranteed to spawn near it. It is legitimately impossible to get someone if they play that loop properly. Loop it twice, on the third, run to the nearest jungle gym, go right back. If you actually chase that as killer its 100% a loss. Macmillan has a few of these as well but I think that's the worst one.
---
Right? There is even a really nice looking Spirit doodle on the frontpage, it's only 1 hr older than this post but is sitting at 1/4th the upvotes. Gotta love the internet!
---
But...she actually does look like Meg. What‚Äôs with the salt?
---
Do we have a video of this? I would really love to watch it.
---
u mean poses in main menu?
---
FYI, Decisive Strike and Nemesis require specific actions to occur in order to make someone the Obsession, assuming there's no other Obsession perks in play. PWYF also discourages hooking your Obsession.
---
I've personally been using Plague's Dark Devotion, because it has no requirements, doesn't penalize you for hooking your Obsession, and comes on a pretty easy character to play, as opposed to Meyers and Spirit.
---
Agreed
---
And shame the series is ending since they could've done a crossover episode with the game actually making an appearance in the show.
---
Someone dies after playing the game and the brothers go to investigate. Turns out someone is using magic to make the killers alive and use them in their own ends. Sam and Dean could even end up in a trial by that same magic. Could be a fun episode.
---
Dun like u
---
he must be fun at parties
---
Exactlyüôèüôèüôè
---
I love how he tried to hide. Reminds me of when I just started playing and didn't know what scratch marks were
---
Yet it has 10x more upvotes than her [way more impressive Freddy cosplay had](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e88g4g/freddy_in_christmas_mood_d/). I wonder why.
---
That's not at all what he is saying...
---
That's not at all what hes saying...
---
Fuckin onion chan
---
You even brought your friend.
---
It seems people are confused.
---
Keep everything as it is now..
---
Then add a character ranking system where each one gains levels superficially while also rewarding a little extra everytime.
---
I.e ok just got 64k merciless as Doc. He's full perked so bps used on others... But his gameplay level is now 273. (Shows post game)
---
Next game I play as Bubba, dump BPs into him as usual, he gains inner levels and gets an extra boost to his nodes ontop of bps spent, and Inner level becomes 37.
---
Shows I'm more a veteran Doc than Bubba even though I have good perks on both.
---
I've stopped someone from opening an exit gate over a T and L wall with 4 bottles directly hitting lol. It works wonders on unhooks if you're a little behind.
---
Cake day! Woop, woop!
---
Yeah unfortunately sometimes there's just nothing that can be done for this in games.
---
Like when COD added up to 1000 levels after many were max ranks for 6 months. They would have been 1000 or close on day 1 but had to grind same as rest.
---
Would keep people playing.
---
Some mad players would want all their killers level 1000, some just their mains for badge of honour.
---
Also if you get killed by a 1000 Ghostface then that confirms he knows his shit and has put the work on his GF to be good.
---
Every new character adds longevity to this.
---
How is it even possible that they brought all of these brand new parts and didn't even do 1 gen?? I would expect at least 2... ?!?!?!?
---
lol not a single unbreakable among them... jesus...
---

---
This is 100% the best meme I‚Äôve ever seen in this sub, especially it‚Äôs not tOxIc NeA wITh FlAsHlIgHt
---
Also I'm farming for 1mil to perk up other killers...
---
But I'm playing my 'main' to get the bps.
---
Now my main gains experience levels instead of nothing. The actual reward could be a random rare add-on or whatever.
---
While still getting perks for others.
---
Right now if I play GF to get bps for others, my GF gets nothing.. 
---
This would just keep the progression train running so everything keeps moving forward
---
Yeah I'm a sucker for soft optional grinds like this. It just makes me feel good leveling characters I enjoy, especially when the cap is extremely high.
---
Oink oink?
---
As a rank 1 survivor I can tell you that my teammates and I still can't hit great skill checks reliably, so yes
---
The largest bucket he could.
---
SWF: Why do killers always use ebony moris against us? It so toxic.
---
Also SWF:
---
they also removed the zap range add-ons (they were a trap. they made it worse) and increased the base range. don't know about the zap charge time.
---
We shall see. I'm excited but they might've ninja-nerfed some things and stuff might still change
---
Imagine KNOWING there's somebody here and wasting a minute searching for them, but finding nothing.
---
Map Balance, God Windows and Loop effectiveness consistency (the strength of loops when considering the proximity of loops to each other, which can create strong tiles without counterplay, ex: long walls on haddonfield and badham)
---
Yeah my big point is alot play their main to get bps for others.
---
Those bps aren't getting the main killer anything, so a soft level going up would atleast have some progress while also gaining perks for others.
---
So gameplay level sort of thing. You gain gameplay levels for those you play but you can use your bps on others so they have perks to then increase their gameplay level too.
---
Rn it's gain all or nothing on 1 character. One you play or one you dont
---
I don't think anyone feels he discovered it. Made it widely popular and more well known? Sure.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Lmao that trademark tho
---
Also me: keeping a list of shit teammates to mori them when I get matched against them.
---
people on youtube sure think he did. He for sure made it popular as hell though
---
It depends on what kind of cosmetics you like. I personally love the Trapper and Wraith skins you unlock but the survivor cosmetics not so much. Most of the charms aren't that great either. But I still think it was worth it for me.
---
Or so Dwight thought... DUN DUN DUN
---
I was at 2/3 grabs for ages. I went to play Trapper for a daily and thought, 'Might as well put in the 5 traps challenge on, might get lucky.'
---
Guess who immediately got two grabs that game.
---
Entity bless you, and may you find lots and lots Ebony Moris in your Christmas Basement
---
The thing is: all tier lists about killers talking no add-ons, no offerings and just using perks.
---
I think no bigger group of people ever said that Wraith with add-ons is bad. But I don't know if he is really the 4th when we see at other killers with good add-ons.. Hag ist for me the 4th after the untouchable 3
---
I'm a survivor main myself, but thank you. Perhaps an abundance of bloody party streamers in my blood web. The gift that keeps on giving!
---
shitpost?
---
Not the point, the guy on the hook can‚Äôt play the game just because the killer wants to be a dick, I play the game to play the game, not to look at a killer while sitting on a hook
---
Definitely.
---
I guess you wanted to write Spirit? :D It is spirit but more like the spirit of human, mind etc :D
---
Sure it sucks when it happens to you but the best course of action is for the team is to just win. You'll encounter less campers and tunnelers at higher ranks because it doesn't work at higher ranks
---
Even if I have the time when the next rift pass comes around, I just don‚Äôt want to invest that much time in dbd anymore :D
---
and where's the demongorgon :x
---
(mutters) ^(maybe...)
---
The game is survivor sided, oh yeah the killers have loads of instadown capabilities and survivors can no longer instaheal so definitely fair. Also Mori just after first hook the survivors cant stop that.
---
RAINBOW HAG

---
BOTTOM TEXT
---
that‚Äôs probably just the recording software lol
---
I just wish this sub would stop being so repetitive, every single damn meme is haha survivor bad killer good it haha toxic nea or haha survivor toxic it‚Äôs the same damn thing every damn day but if you post anything about a killer being toxic you get downvoted to hell
---
dbd was never that disturbing
---
what are they? speed limiter and...
---
Timer on the battle pass is what screws it over. If it would be a "pay and do whenever you like" it wouldn't be that bad. But since you're on the clock, everybody is being a dick about it. Also toxic challenges.
---
they were using multiple bnps one the same gen?
---
That's usually because being toxic as a killer is a losing strategy. You can be a toxic survivor and have an easier time winning than a toxic killer. I'm not saying toxic killers aren't as unfun as toxic survivors, but atleast toxic killers don't usually pip
---
You can‚Äôt have stupidly strong perks that last the full game hence hex perks, high risk high reward. You rely on the other 3 for consistency. The reward is whatever it‚Äôs trying to accomplish.
---
Once I finally get rid of this Escape with Spine Chill without being hooked challenge that makes me play like a boosted bushdette at rank 4, maybe then I'll have a good opinion about it.
---
On a serious side note, the only thing I like rn is that plant charm (I think it was a ficus?) but do I look like I'm about to waste 10 dollars just for that? ...Well, maybe.
---
Some survivors don't seem to understand that the obsession in OoO is supposed to be them and that they're not the ones who are supposed to follow you.
---
I missed ten seconds ago when I didn‚Äôt know this existed
---
So make the hex more obvious when it activates?
---
And what if theoretically, the survivors cleanse all 5 before the timer runs out. What happens to the hex perk?
---
&gt; but this is a shitpost. 
---
except the part that said *~~^(nea)~~* is the entity
---
Who... who's gonna tell him...
---
My will to live(and probably the survivors too)
---

Hi german dude!

IF YOU'RE ACCIDENTALLY DISCONNECTING SO MUCH THAT YOU'VE GATHERED A SIGNIFICANT QUEUE PENALTY, YOU DESERVE IT FOR RUINING THAT MANY GAMES, EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO.
---
With this change it would work well with Jeff's Aftercare perk. I like the idea
---
Thanks! That is exciting!
---
Can you even change fps in the game settings??
---
One guy literally mentioned the "invisible trap in the shack" that was remarked by Otz at the beginning of the game. Better remove that idiotic Youtube comment of yours.
---
So if you were on a football team and we're crushing your opponent 42-0 would you intentionally drop the ball and let your opponent score a TD so they can feel good about themselves? There are people that are going to be better than you. Period. If you get out played you get out played. The fun in losing comes from learning from your mistakes and improving. This is a competitive game. Participation trophies just make people weak, because that isn't how the world works.
---
but why??
---
Its an interesting idea
---
Based on that loadout 3 of then were potatoes. Alex with BNP, yellow toolbox (prob doesnt own better), and enginneers with clamp lmao
---
Wouldnt so proud about winning.

Gotta love the "DC tech" lmao

It's reddit, no wonder it's such a meme. It's full of either braindead killer or survivor mains.
---
I saw you got almost 30 downvotes before reading the comment and I guessed you said something racist or homophobic or something
---
My life is a joke. No worries.
---
I'm seriously hoping this post gives me luck, I havent had a fun round within the last 15 I've played. I'm trying to help my rank 20 friend get better but we keep getting killers with 200+ ping, I keep getting tunneled to the point where the killer ignores injured survivors when I'm at full health, oh and don't forget the fact that these exact killers facecamp me until I'm dead, and if it's not that it's an ebony mori with iridescent addons.
---
And for the cherry on top, I went against a face camping, lagswitching bubba a few games ago. It wasn't too bad since I did escape through the hatch, but only because a Claudette suicide saved me and I hit my DS. We love console.
---
That Freddy is blind. I know the killer FOV is awful but he basically bumped into you
---
Yes, tomes 3 and 4 are just encouraging camping, since the challenges say to you kill a lot of people on the basement or using NOED at the endgame, I don't wanna play this way, I feel myself dirty after something like this.
---
Imagine not playing this game anymore and still complaining about it.
---
This is horrifying
---
If hide benig crime then Jeff is arrest.

Indeed, best way to get archives is to not pay attention to them and enjoy matches.

Nah. The hetcha sketch is far better. The flicks you can do on that
---
Whyyyy?
---
That would have fit so well if it was a Legion member since they‚Äôre almost the same size as survivors and dress fairly normal
---
the fuck you mean "why"
---
Thank you so much!
---
Takes me four years just to find a chest
---
And older comment or this one?
---
Pretty sure its both chillis, speed limiter workes just as it says
---
Trying to get the sacrifice during the endgame collapse earlier. 
---
I left 2 of the survivors alive to finish the last 2 gens. Both were on their death hook and I was just gonna wait for noed and hook one when the exit gate opened so I went and hid. 
---
Fast forward about half an hour and they finally finish the last gen. I found one and chased them for a painful amount of time without hitting them. When the gate finally opens, I hit them and find out that they spent that half an hour just cleansing dull totems. 
---
Watched as they ran round the corner to the open gate. Both ran forward ten feet, teabagged, then left. Don't know if they were genuinses or total morons.
---
No, this one
---
Because all good things actually end.
---
I mean, he was standing next to a Japanese chick. Of course he looked gigantic.

&gt;new ultra rare (Iridescent Queen) that makes it so survivors zapped by  you get "charged" and zap others they come in contact with later

What rank are you mate? I‚Äôm on console too
---
What's a party starter?
---
Boo-hoo. Let me press f on the world's smallest keyboard
---
Could be the date the game was announced
---
Same here though. I live in a town with leas than a thousand people and i saw it 3 times in theatres.  About 15-20 minutes from the theatre
---
I thought the exact same thing, standing nurse is a cursed image
---
thank you
---
I stay around rank 4-7, I try to avoid red ranks because all I ever get there is terrible teammates and extremely good killers.
---
Seems like I'm the only one trying to avoid exact same outfits. When someone joins the lobby looking exactly the same, I switch 1 or 2 cosmetics or complete surv.
---
Why? So I don't get tunneled "accidentally" (or actually really by accident). I don't play killer much but when the survs look all the same I go like "well at this point it's your own fault if I go after the same person again and again"... I don't want that to happen to me :/
---
Who said I was proud? I said it made me happy.
---
Team: fails
---
Literally everyone seeing this: ‚Äúoh boo hoo! Let me press F on the worlds smallest keyboard.‚Äù
---
See that's my point you play how you want, good. I like camping tunneling and hitting survivors on hooks, I did not purchase this game to please 4 survivors who are going to whine anyway
---
I second this
---
Add me crowza77

Time travel!

ngl I actually jumped

She has a rare that prevents her from teleporting. Its considered the most useless add on in the game. There was a second that was pretty bad too. It was more forgetable than negative.

You for real? Bodyblocker hag is one of the funniest and suprisingly good build for hag

Just head down to your settings -&gt; controls

There‚Äôs a ‚Äústruggle on hook‚Äù key, which you can bind to scrolling your mouse wheel
---
lmao *mend station*
---
the best stories in this game come from new players.
---
&gt;so don't try to tell me it's a "standard feature", it's legit not
---
Play more online pvp game. I cannot have a serious discussion before you do that

Nope, 26 disagreed with me because I said i look around a generator after kicking it, this subreddit is pretty fucking stupid anyway so im not really thinking much about it

Serious Q: If I wanna bang Spirit, does that mean I'm into necrophilia?
---
Not asking for a friend.
---
Fuckem, kill all of them, and if you have no choice, facecamp survivors. Little bastards.
---
Good luck moonwalking stuff with that head on, tho
---
I suffer from social anxiety also, so I know the feeling. For me, it‚Äôs taking things personally and feeling like I‚Äôm being attacked when in reality, to them I‚Äôm just some faceless killer that they can beat on. Remember that they don‚Äôt really know you.
---
I don't get the hate either, but oh well, I never bring keys anyway
---
I can't loop and can't 360, so I feel your pain. My only usefulness as survivor is do gens or make some unhooks and pray to escape at the end.
---
Uhm... why would someone make a post about having an average game then? Of course the only stuff worth posting is this.
---
I sure can! So first it‚Äôs starts off with: it was a joke you need to learn sarcasm.
---
I'm fine with the perk in theory, I just hate it in execution.
---
If I'm playing and notice a drastic increase in "skill" with how the Survivors are playing except the person with Object though, I'm right furious.
---
That‚Äôs going to be tough for your friend playing against high rank players.  That‚Äôs a shame
---
Well, no one understood your sarcasm nor found it funny, your sarcasm got you nothing but downvotes
---
Happend to me, but the other 3 survivors left instead of the Jake (through the hatch)... I died
---
I see people here saying ooo doesn't bother them then there's me who plays Huntress
---
The only meaningful hex is devour hope,ruin is mandatory for any build
---
Unfortunately that picture is not check-mate, it is a draw.
---
Sorry, couldn‚Äôt resist pointing it out :)
---
Well darn! I hadn‚Äôt realized that just yet! Gosh well it was a good try I guess...
---
It makes me feel a little bit like a real serial killer but I do this too
---
The 2nd one would be amazing to have tbh. First one feels like it could be very hit or miss. It doesn't really powercreep t1 Myers either because his stealth add-on has other benefits that arguably might still make it better than this version of Tape despite moving at 105% movespeed.
---
I would

You still have to sacrifice 4.

Have you seen his recent Dark Devotion video? So many gigabrain predictions like that

Scratched Mirror is still better so idk what you're bitching about.

For the most part i wouldn't say he discovered it, i would say he widely popularized it to the point he may as well of discovered it.
---
The main problem is nobody really said wraith is bad with good addons. Worse then the top 3 still sure, but not bad.
---
Tier lists assumed one of the following : at least decent survivors against baseline killer (aka not dipshits who run away from tiles and immerse) or best possible build vs SWF red ranks with items.
---
Now granted, people may of underestimated wraith by going "lmao hes a m1 killer, once he gets the first hit just go to a pallet and then he's countered" not considering just leaving them and going to someone else with your stealth.
---
I am red ranks too my guy,it's definitely possible.
---
Ruin or corrupt is good but sometimes even knowing when they are working on gens with discordance or surveillance can be useful
---
Oh no Scott! They reported you, what if you get banned! What will you ever do?!
---
Mkay. I like to get healed fast beacuse most of the time some teamate has thrown all of the pallets down and im left with just windows.
---
There are certain controllers that support macros if I'm not mistaken, you could look into that :)
---
no they are fine
---
positivity doesn't spread just look at any media
---
Jesus christ i dropped my phone lol
---
Mhm. Thanks, do you recommend discordance or surveillance more? Or perhaps corrupt. Thing i hate about ruin is that its a gamble.
---
I have no sound and this is so fucking weird without auditory context XD
---
Thank you for your five minutes! Spectacular!
---
How it feels to be lunged through windows on dedicated servers
---
Sounds bad, but in most communities this won't be the case. I just Mori people with cringe names, not a direct tunnel, I just bring an Ivory and hook em.

Holy shit that was amazing

Do people actually think that obedience add-on is good?

How is making skilchecks going counter clockwise hard? It's literally to the left instead of right. Ono, think they buffed is that 60 seconds TR zap.

But we literally hear u, those are just shitters you could of depowered infront of them and still downed them lmao

you can change your name on ps4

I only use a mori if your a problem, if your not just hooks
---
Verified your cache files?
---
That depends on the challenge, to be honest. Some of them (Sacrifice 4 in the basement in a single trial) are very unlikely to be achieved passively.
---
This is really impressive, cause his hitbox is so broken
---
youre actually just the same person but in parallel universes
---
Realistically, it's just things like teabagging or blicking teammates in corners. Logically, It's only things that one would do to insult the killer/survivors.
---
Don't listen to the people who are going to say that pallet looping, using infinites or flashlights is toxic. That's just utilizing what you're given within the game to survive.
---
Was in a game like this got wrecked by a Myers wasn't even mad lol
---
Meanwhile, i tbagged a tbagger with ghostface and afterwards bombarded me with insults and denied collectively they dodnt tbag, that they never tbag, turns out it was a 3 man swf, visited the stream to see whats up and by the time i loaded in the same people were all tbagging a demigorgon. Amazing.
---
*This madlad when they downed the last survivor near basement* 
---
Oh yes, it's all coming together.
---
Watch some guides on how to use Sprint Burst. You certainly should not be walking everywhere while running it, you just need to learn how to manage your exhaustion timer.
---
Now that would be strange
---
Yes
---
GF On Tape really isn't that bad, also pretty sure Security Camera works with Night Shroud. They aren't bad base game.
---
WAZZUP!
---
Oh man I didnt know billy was originally a survivor. Makes sense why he's killer though probably got camped and left on hook 10 to many times and went crazy
---
I did not do it.
---
Survivors rule book is the most stupidnthijg in this game.
---
It's simply because instaheals, bnps and flashlights were nerfed already and people ran out of items to complain about. Watch them complain about maps next year for no reason.
---
"You either die a hero..."
---
Mhm, i do most of the time keep it at 99%. Pretty easy.
---
If a survivor "abuses" strong windows and then complains about NOED, that is indeed a tad hypocritical. Mori - not really. If you bring a Mori, survivors will obviously abuse those windows if possible because you brought a Mori. It would be "hypocritical" of you to be upset about them abusing those windows if you brought a Mori before they did.
---
Also, it's not "always" by much of any stretch, since not only do not too many of those windows exist anymore and even on the maps where they do exist they don't always spawn and survivors cannot always get to them, but the average survivor is not even good enough to know about and be able to "abuse" them well. You don't always have to chase them there either, but can change targets and find someone too far away from the structure to get there, someone that doesn't know where the structure is or even how to use it, someone that won't use it, someone that's already injured or can otherwise be downed before they can get there, and so on. Various of the killers also have abilities that actually do allow for counterplay on these structures.
---
I often intentionally leave strong windows like that as survivor, and killers still regularly camp, tunnel and slug, even hitting me on hook and nodding at me once they do get me. Just like as killer I often intentionally go out of my way to play in a more sportsmanship manner, yet survivors will still not always refrain from using those windows, stalling in the exit gates, even taunting or talking shit. You just have to learn not to let it affect you and play for yourself and your own reasons. I mostly play for chases and the skill in them, so I tend to leave structures like that as survivor because it doesn't take much skill to get value out of them, and I tend not to camp as killer because I want actual chases and not free kills.
---
And if you've read this far, here's my super-secret tip: There exists a perk called "Bamboozle" - I'd suggest you use that rather than Moris. I do think some of those windows should have long been reworked (and some did, but unfortunately not all, and even those that did were not necessarily always reworked in good ways), but so should Moris (and Bamboozle, for that matter - it's a bandaid perk for those window windows, yet takes skill out of playing non-problematic window structures).

The problem is they are still incompetent as fuck but after 3 years you should expect some progress. They removed the only content which makes the game a little bit different(events) and added a lot more microtransactions and other pay bullshit to the game.

It is pretty good. Imo

i mean, you could survive by just being high on pills as long as you don't fuck up so, yeah
---
Finger food.
---
In the jungle gym you forgot where a hook could spawn

I like your name/tag combo ü§ó
---
Is there a reasoning behind this ? I'm pretty new and someone did this to me
---
A bunch of teenagers are taller than Freddy I can't believe this
---
High quality shitpost.
---
It‚Äôs also fun to play against a toxic three man swf and stomp them and let the last random go
---
But not for free. Unlike PC
---
If a loop is so strong that your only option is to leave it, it needs to be changed. That is directly admitting that it is too powerful to face. It's like Old Nurse. The only counter was stealth, because a good Nurse would have no counter play.
---
You can't just say "Oh well" and move on. The devs need to do their jobs.
---
Imagine being able to down only one survivor at a time
---
Wait...is any killer following The survivors rulebook or am I The only one that is not giving A single damn about it XD  I'd like to see Survivor main playing killer without ,,breaking The law" XDD
---
Such an interesting concept, i like the part about more killers and like gaining control of them, could be really cool. I just cant imagine how the sprint works, same as now or like pig or hillbilly?
---
Why do people do this? They have done it to me aswell
---
I think that's the point
---
You should try Dwight next
---
Steve
---
RUNRUNRUNRUNR- oh! Piece of candy!
---
Doc also is only free on console
---
I prefer swf I'm not toxic tho.When me and my friends play we play the best we can but if we get face camped or tunneled and if I die I just message the killer gg had fun.At the end of the day I enjoy every game because that's all it is,a game.

I am a basement dweller I dont camp but I play trepper
---
Any time I use a Mori on a recognized name, it's because they messaged me talking shit, or they were tbagging, clicking their flashlight or doing some other annoying shit. I make sure to get them out of my game quick.
---
I'm surprised there was no dead hard
---
That chest one with plunderer made me hate myself. I played like the kind of survivor I hate having on my team, I just let teammates get hooked and ignored gens while I ran around looking for chests.
---
When the Killer main finally tries Survivor side
---
free for the first time
---
MOST OF THIS SUB'S POPULATION IS LOW RANKING PLAYERS
---
Imagine depipping because the killer is bad..
---
killer queues are awful at low ranks. Most of new players seems to prefer play survivor, I guess
---
You can swap Leatherface for Trapper and just use a Trapper Bag or any colour and Trap Setting Tools of any colour. Use the same perks but bring a murky reagent offering. Trap the basement and loops around it.
---
Ash
---
YES BECAUSE THEY'RE TOTALLY NOT GOING TO LOOK AWAY TO AVOID BEING BLINDED
---
This'll be more terrifying than going up against a good hag. Legion needs things like this, I just hope the devs listen for once.
---
How?

I wish I could upvote this five times. One for playing Oni, and four times for every BNP they wasted.

I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THAT, I WOULD RATHER WAIT
---
And Nintendo switch.....................but the length is limited.

I did, but it doesnt work

Really? I thought them is always plural, like multiple persons.
---
Lmao hey there
---
Kate is so cute and so small, best grill. &lt;3
---
It does seem like a controversial opinion to have but I also think it should never become one... in any game ever.
---
They just wanted an excuse to take his exhaustion debuff away because that's "oppressive". The doc changes are gonna be a net nerf. And I'm pretty sure when huntress gets her add-on pass, she will be losing her exhaustion add-ons too. I don't like the direction this game is taking.
---
how?
---
Legion vs 4 quentin
---
Wait you're not OP
---
You need 2 friends one is killer other is surv both need to be rady then you change fast to killer by ui on left.
---
Claudette is the new nurse now, floating and haunting around.
---
Thess are all great changes, but doesn't legion already deal the equivalent of a damage state while in frenzy ?
---
It still works well vs T1 myers. He can always see you with stalk anyway, but now with OoO you know which direction hes coming from even if you can't see him
---
Never apologize to a claudette.
---
OoO counters scratched mirror myers better than any other perk.
---
Yes, he can see you, but he can always see you anyway. But with OoO you know when you're looking in his direction because it will activate.
---
Yeah but only to healthy survivors. If a survivor is injured they stay injured rather than being put into the dying state.
---
Iirc it's a reward
---
No you just have a character with everything equipped
---
Once the timer hits 6 seconds you switch to that character. When the timer hits 5 seconds it locks in the match.
---
I could see it being useful when it's at an inconsistant percentage.
---
Making it occur 100% of the time would be dumb.
---
Luck
---
Claudette
---
Aye me too man me too
---
holy fuck that fucking scared me
---
This.
---
Oh yeah right, sorry i‚Äôm dumb lol
---
Its Especially annoying when going up against a 4 man Claudette with an Oni map offering
---
Idk how I feel about this cosmetic. It looks sick but that head looks a bit too red ingame. I like how it gives her long hair though. We need more skins with long-haired Anna
---
Play killer vs survivors that know how to abuse god loops and it will make sense to you.
---
Honestly, I would appreciate something along the  lines of making his power weaker but easily applyable eg. Removing a need to snap out of it but making 1 zap to tier you up or such.
---
His current power is, like you say, very oppressive and strong but difficult to apply over and over again.
---
We‚Äôre the wickersham brothers. We know your plot.
---
How is the Mori hate overrated?
---
I get the post but you censored 'level' 'feng min' unready' but not even your own name?
---
Well, they'll consider it when they'll be sick of losing ruin in 30 seconds. Of course, at lower ranks, ruin is much more effective
---
I survivor now...
---
Why would they patch?its a kyf and people be having fun with it
---
I like Oni and Huntress next to each other, this is my new favorite Killer Couple.
---
I know and on the swamp map too god..
---
Because flashlights are rare on the bloodweb. Too rare to actually get a full games worth. Legitimately the only thing I see that would be good about it is lockers to change. Even so BHVR said they don‚Äôt plan on doing transforming killers any time soon. Attacking without being visible and no terror/stain with the only cooldown being a light is not balanced in the slightest.
---
Ps4 version is more expensive than pc though
---
Yeah if it‚Äôs scratched mirror then you basically get infinite premonition and Spine chill in one
---
How did you record it? :)  
---
I would love to get some high res footage of that game but I am too cheap for a Elegato to record my phone üòÜ
---
I would like to add you and play with you, it must be fun, hope you rage sometimes.
---
we're saying we know its shitty to play against the way these challenges sometimes force us to play, but we understand why our opponent did. its the devs fault not theirs.
---
Most good killers knew about it before I assume. He (Tru3ta1ent)  just reached a broader audience.
---
Ah, thank you
---
Thanks :)
---
its one little event, i appreciate all they do its just annoying

Just was 1m away from hook, it was endgame almost there. He fucking wiggled off and ran even tho he was gonna die anyway. Cancerous survivor hope he may die
---
I would facecamp you
---
But you can escape with a dull key, which is a win?
---
They're mainly broken in swf matches.  It sounds like you did soloqueue.  It only takes 3 gens completed to get the final 2 survivors out.  3 gens is nothing at red ranks.  It just becomes too easy for half the team to get out of the map with next to no effort on their part and little you can do to stop it.  Franklin's barely helps.  They pick them back up or assign a swf member to grab it.  You just need to destroy the group and hope you somehow only lose 2 gens in the process in order to counterplay them.  
---
Also on PS4 I see them in roughly 25-30% of my matches.  We get a lot of swf particularly at night and one thing they like to do is last second switch to them in lobby so you can't put on Franklin's.  Not sure how common that douche move is on other platforms but it is extremely commonplace on PS4.
---
It's what they all say
---
Your life must be very intresting then. Congratulations?
---
But not the win you wanted
---
I literally did it earlier today
---
I disagree actually, the entire map can‚Äôt be killer sided otherwise it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúfind survivor, chase a bit and hook them‚Äù, having 1 spot in the map isn‚Äôt terrible.  
---
It‚Äôs not like survivors can camp that spot otherwise no gens get done and if multiple survivors are there they‚Äôll run in each other‚Äôs way. 
---
And a good nurse is still just as powerful now as with an old nurse.
---
I've always wanted John Carpenter the Thing as a disguise killer
---
Don't agree with that at all. Adding a delay takes away the good with streaming. Might as well watch yt at that point
---
Totem perks dont need to exist in my opinion.
---
Every time I‚Äôve successfully hidden from a killer I wonder how many times it has happened to me
---
Once I was doing a swf with strangers. Horrible lagswitching. Someone vaulted but stayed on the same side. A Huntress Yeeted her hatchet up in the air like she had been doing all game and hit a healing Meg
---
I didnt said that it wouldnt have cooldown, but ok you have a point. Also i dont think you are invisible when you morph, you are like one other survivor and still running, if survivors would pay attention they wont let you get close, because you are same speed as them, so the power is useful against dumb survivors or ones with bad memory, i get that you can just walk beside wall to a gen but still thats one hit...
---
I am on pc, I should have put the platform on the post. Lol what platform are you on?
---
You will only get The Oni
---
Lmao I‚Äôm just imagining his voice lines. 
---
‚ÄúzOInKs!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get, like outta here!‚Äù
---
Proceeds to step in a bear trap
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, it just really sucks to go against cause you‚Äôre basically dead on first hook unless the entire team works to get them out
---
More specifically, it often means you will completely ignore other survivors to catch and kill that one survivor, but many use it as an excuse when theygetcaught easily because the rest of the team is inmersed (hiding instead of being useful) and they are running around making themselves obvious
---
What chin?
---
I know this might be a dumb question but is this map on DBD?
---
I ha e always wanted to do an arts of someone being absolutely heinous, getting called into n it and it be like ‚ÄúDoing a daily/challenge‚Äù and everyone be like ‚ÄúOhh makes sense yeah totally okay.‚Äù
---
Honestly?The only hard one is the basement 4k and maybe completing 4 gens but that can be done easily considering how many people farm.I completed all challenges in tome 4 in like 2 days I think?That was the last one I had left
---
As a doc main these are good changes the only problem is now I have like 100 impossible skill check pieces to use before static field is gone
---
Billy or oni seems like a good one for you.
---
very surprising, but what was that looping he was doing?
---
I was doing generators!!
---
Stream sniping isn't a real thing.
---
Mad grit,iron grasp and agitation
---
it seems reasonable. Another thing I would add is: no mither users drop 50% or 75% less blood orbs to Oni, I think 100% is too much cause would nullify completely his power. Anyway 50/75% less I think it is a fair trade for a perma injured/exposed survivor.
---
Definitely seems like a cool concept, not sure how well it would actually work
---
Sabotage hooks, this counts as we‚Äôll as healing and gens. No mither is a risky but viable option. Stake out is very helpful too.
---
This is why I come to this sub. Thanks for the laugh :).
---
People can appreciate while also having criticism.
---
You wait till I Rancor you
---
I wish i could, but aparently rank 12-15 killers are super toxic for me and i get 1 good game then like 2-6 bad ones
---
The reason i dont like killer archives, it makes killer camp or play thrash to complete them... Not entirely killers fault, dont take me wrong, please
---
Classic: Just normal DBD
---
Traitor: Killer messages 1 survivor, then it‚Äôs that‚Äôs survivor‚Äôs objective to assist the killer whilst remaining undetected 
---
VIP: One survivor is picked at random to be the VIP. The killer is not allowed to sacrifice any other survivor until the VIP is dead. Killers only objective is to kill that survivor. Survivors only objective is to protect the VIP until escape 
---
Hardcore: No items, perks, offerings or add ons (Including Killer)
---
Manhunt: Killers seeker, last survivor standing wins, Survivors can sabotage each over
---
For camping, slow down the rate at which they go down to struggle, but this shouldn't apply when there are other survivors nearby the hook
---
As for tunneling, we've already got borrowed time and decisive so I can't think of anything new for that. While it does happen, most killer's (me included) ignore the dude who just got unhooked and go for the saviour
---
So NOED is toxic but ebony moris aren't? 
---
Basement builds are toxic, but not ebonys? I have to disagree there. Using an ebony mori to kill people on their 2nd down is just as toxic, if not more toxic, than using an endgame build, or a basement build.
---
Sarcasm can be hard to convey through text, when using sarcasm it is important to add a /s if it isn't incredibly obvious, as some people will still think you're serious when you're making the dumbest sarcastic statement you can think of
---
Okay now this may sound like a crazy idea but hear me out. They buff the killers and they give survivors especially solo ones a built-in perk to allow everyone to see when the Killer is camping or nearby them.
---
1. The killer should be buffed because if I'm at least powerful and can trust my own ability to not be bullied. I'll keep doing after different targets because there's no need to Camp or tunnel because I know I have to power to hunt down the person I hooked before so why not just switch targets... still don't unhook in front of the killing though that's just stupid
---
Agitation + Iron Grasp time!
---
I have shit eyes and lose survivors/can‚Äôt find them really easy. It sucks. Especially when you know they‚Äôre there, working a gen the second you turn around.
---
And completely justified...perhaps you should stop trying to virtue signal and trying to take on the role of a "victim" and realize that some people wont just step back and let you be a little shit kid. You come at me acting like an asshole...I will rip your ass apart. I dont do shitty little kids politely. YOU get what you ask for.

I got my first save as Quentin not even meaning to save Meg. Just wanted to blind killer 3 more times.
---
I like your thinking on this. However in what ways do you think the killer should be buffed. You mentioned get your power strong enough to not be bullied. What killer do you play? I would say most powers aren‚Äôt weak enough to be bullied unless ur legion

How bhvr stole Christmas.

An Early Christmas Miracle
---
I'm only replying to you once more, and it's to honestly suggest you to just go. Seriously, you are just a complete toxic influence in this subreddit, all you want to do is fight and be spiteful, I don't know why.
---
It's a dead game anyway.
---
Really?
---
There really is no contest. Demo is at least 7 feet tall, and it‚Äôs 7-9 feet tall in the show.
---
What is a "hetcha sketch"?

üò†
---
An iconic callback. Surprised no ones responded yet.
---
You WILL have a bad time if you play anything but SWF with no heals. Anyone advising you different likely plays SWF or gets godlike RNG when it comes to teammates
---
Here we go again. What recently have they changed that has changed the game for the worse? Other than a legion nerf nothing. Stop complaining and appreciate the time and effort put into the game. Genuinely though what doesn‚Äôt work that they‚Äôve changed? I‚Äôd love to know
---
Extended his base range a little. I bet to moldy electrode length. We still get beam doc. I hope we can still do sniper doc.
---
It's actually my favorite thing to do. Been running sprint burst recently, and the funniest thing is to mend literally at their feet, and they choose to end frenzy, and then SB away.
---
Dude if you look at the game files. All the Christmas crap is still in the code. Along with all the other Halloween stuff and even the pustules. They don't have an excuse. Also if their balance are the game was anything worth a damn I would appreciate what they give us. It took them how long now to try to rework the doctor? Still waiting for that pig and Leatherface?
---
But they‚Äôre criticising such unnecessary things, being selfish and acting like the devs do nothing for them. It‚Äôs petty and disrespectful tbh
---
Took me like a whole minute to get it. I am ashamed, and I will leave.
---
Maybe I'm the dick for saying this but... if they released balance changes at the same rate they release new content this game would have gotten an award or best ongoing game but instead they keep pumping out microtransactions instead of fixing the problem.
---
That's enough internet for today and the day just started.
---
They could change ds to focus on just being an anti-tunnel perk. 
---
Camping is hard because you can‚Äôt punish killers who camp when someone‚Äôs close to stage two,death, or when they‚Äôre only there because multiple survivors are running to the hook in front of them.
---
its fun when it works. i play some end game builds and blood warden is a must in those.
---
Why is it draw? White is moving now so black needs to move if black moves he get's taken out by either the knight or the queen, so it's check-mate. Draw would be an endless game no one can win...
---
The wait times have increased with the last few updates, if you have even a single friend in the lobby with you half the time it doesn't carry you both to the same lobby. Hit boxes have gone downhill immensely. The DC punishment was such a great implement but because the game kicks you randomly, the wrong people are being punished. They keep churning out updates and cosmetics asking for more and more money but the QOL on this game isn't showing that. They've given us an amazing game, concept wise. But they're hardly able to keep up. The legion nerf however was amazing, I for one am glad I'm seeing less and less of that killer.
---
This game isn't realistic at all. Back rubs lead to sex. Bhvr, get your shit together
---
She looks so potato how I drew her lmao but I love her so much
---
It's fixated xD
---
It's alright, some synergy and utility, try and replace self care with something else if you can.
---
They said they've spent money on the game in order to support the devs. That's not selfish, and having an opinion/critisism toward something doesn't make it so.
---
In Chess, for you to win, you have the check the enemy king and the king has no valid moves available. In this picture, black king is not being checked however he also doesn‚Äôt have any moves available. This results in a draw. It is a common rookie mistake by many players.
---
So give survivors old kindred
---
You'd think but some insist it's the best slowdown you can possibly get even when destroyed instantly. Because in the time spent destroying the totem they could've got two gens done or something.
---
Yup, inner strenght. A quick 8 sec heal. Fixated is very nice tho. You can see the difference in movement speed definetly.
---
The funny thing is I am a bit of a math nerd so I made a chart to tell me what Killers to play but to be honest I played pretty much all of them but my top three would be the Clown, Wraith, hag.
---
The funny thing is the easiest buff they could do to every killer... is to just flatly increase the movement speed. Especially for slower killers. Now don't get me wrong the nurse is powerful and they still powerful but at least she can keep pace for a bit if she messes up.
---
Basically fix it so the killer can do their own thing in a match instead of having to worry about survivors making a mistake. That's usually has a killer how we keep getting kills. Survivors make mistakes and we have no choice but to capitalize. If survivors never made a mistake in a game and I'm sure you all have noticed this with survive with friends. They can't be stopped...
---

---
Lobby good
---
I have now realised that the white piece that is being moved is a queen. I assumed it was a king as well because there is not other pieces left on the board. It is in fact a check-mate but if it was a king it wouldn‚Äôt be.
---
That'll do it
---
Maybe I am just doing extra shit or actually it may well be how long I spent trying to get that fecking spine chill tome 3 challenge done but none of the tome 4's other than the complete 4 gens which requires a complete swf at least for me which I do not currently have, or a group willing to farm. 
---
The killer ones seem a lot more complex if nothing else imo.
---
Sea of Thieves had such an individual, falsely reported people to a friend at Rare (the devs) and got couple of people banned without proof, devs kept silent about it and tried to sweep it under the rug, cause they suck up a lot to streamers.
---
Fungoose is a great killer and he explains everything he does and why he does. He also plays survivor. 
---
Watch him on twitch.
---
He‚Äôs also super knowledgeable about the game which makes him especially worth watching for new/intermediate players, Hell I‚Äôve played this game at every rank for a couple of years and I still learn from him
---
Sure...you said that a few posts ago but keep coming back like the child you are. "toxic" look in the mirror if you want to see the kid that is truly toxic. Don't dish out something you cant handle boy.
---
now kiss
---
Wow you don't know? It's a drawing pad in which you drew using two nobs on the bottom to create pictures. Then you shook it to rub the picture out. Search one up
---
Idk when I was in lower killer ranks, it actually took forever for matches. Lately they arent as bad. I mean they can still take forever, but now both survivor and killer can take up to like 10 min waiting
---
Well, it's the internet. Let's stalk them and furiously downvote everything they post, that'll teach them !
---
Nah, I rather be up at that level that I can tear your ass down because you are a dumbass little kid who thinks they are special. Like I said, what I stated was true and you cant refute it so you just post some more redundant bullshit, typical.
---
Yeah I don't mention my age. All randoms know about me from my voice is my new York accent. I mean I don't care about how old my teammates are. I don play with kids tho
---
It probably won‚Äôt catch experienced survivors but will mess with a lot of mid level players. Especially if it randomly goes from clockwise to counter clockwise.
---
I wish they made it so you would genuinely earn more blood points per match, especially since the lobby times are like 10 minutes for survivor and yet I get camped/tunneled and earn 10k bloodpoints. Not worth it. If they gave killers and survivors more points for doing the objective instead of being toxic, they might focus on that more. Or at least lower the prices of the items. Like 1k for common, 2k for uncommon, 3k for rare 4K for ultra rare. Because right now it feels like you get more blood points while being toxic as survivor and you get jack sh*t for killer because by the time you hook 1 person 2 gens pop...
---
He's not your friend. No matter how many times you pay him to be. Don't get me wrong, he seems like a genuinely decent human being. But he's also very clever. I don't trust anyone who doesn't rage at this game at least once in a while. Come to think of it...is he even human...?
---
Hybrid Panda is a fun/easy watch. He‚Äôs nice as hell, and often explains WHY he‚Äôs doing things when he does them, which I love.
---
Ok it‚Äôs all my opinion but a really good killer playing is trapper he can make the game last long or short depending how you play put if you have perks such as Hex Ruin which you can trap again and again which can delay the game a lot also if you place smart traps near killer shack or near a over power loop or something that‚Äôs kinda op can end chases pretty fast.
---
Oooh baby killer thinks he‚Äôs good because we let him win oooh he‚Äôs so mad oooh reporting because he sucks ooooh 
---
I laugh so hard whenever i see the survivors crabwalk during flashlight saves.
---
fungoose, otzdarva, scott jund and tru3ta1ent. they have all been helpful to me and many others.
---
Wwhat is object of passion and swf?
---
I think it's funny. On the stream they said that they should just have a built-in ruin in the game since so many killers run it. Same thing with Kindred but they said that wouldn't be a good idea because not every killer runs it.
---
I don't know about any of you but I've been seeing a ruin every four out of five matches and if they don't have that they have NOED because they expect to get gen rushed which is sad.
---
Honestly if they took away that perk and maybe gave us level two ruin every match I would be happy. Also solo survivors should be able to see other people's ranks as well as their perks and should have a built-in kindred.
---
... this game is way to survive with friends Focus on Survivor side
---
It's also a treaty. You boop the snoot 9/10 times you live depending on the game. Your fellow survivors though, they will die. Unless it's a boop circle and that's just heaven.
---
I thought that it would be a net nerf too originally but it has the potential to be a bit stronger now imo. I‚Äôve heard some people say that treatment mode would be gone and shock therapy would be m2 and he would get his whole 60 second blast power. Depending on the recovery of shock therapy, this could make him a lot better at loops. Shocking a survivor when they are close to the pallet/window and then getting the immediate hit due to Doctor not having to change modes could be really good for him. This relies on the scream lasting longer than the recovery of shock therapy though.
---
What build did you use? Tried it yesterday but I could only get 3 kills
---
No! You stand There!
---
you think that face wouldnt look goblin like? I think it would look MORE goblin like
---
Every single one of them
---
I mean, I don't want to say that these 3 aren't idiots. However I do think that they actually didn't missspell "reported" (since all 3 of them wrote it the same way) but instead I guess that these 3 are just germans who got a little bit confused.
---
In german -et is a pretty common ending (for example: "reported" would be translated to "gemeldet") and it does sound exactily like the -ed. So I guess thats their reason to write it as "reportet" they just (kinda) used denglish .
---
That said: These 3 are still idiots, but not because they wrote "reported" as "reportet" but because they wrote it because they lost in a game.

WTF?

Is it possible to learn this power

This sounds like a special hell reminiscent of Titan Fall. In that game being labelled as a hacker/sandbagger/toxic/etc got you sent to the server filled with all the other like minded jerks. So a person's own toxic behaviour is reflected by the same jerks who form their unfun teams.
---
thank you.

I had this issue when RDR2 came out, with a first gen Pro.

Tier list should assume yellow tier items and thats what wraith needs (bell is map wide). Id say so only because you could play every match using browns/yellows for the most part
---
Whether they're different departments or not, it's clear they're putting more money towards one over the other. Queues are still dogshit, as is getting into lobbies with friends, unless there was an update today. Your excuses are used time and time again from anyone who can't accept that the devs have been pretty incompetent lately.
---
Because half the community is awesome people like us and the other half is pieces of shit.

but doesn't keep you injured and only spreads the zap once

I‚Äôm so confused rn. A lot of their recent changes have been improvements. You can‚Äôt claim more money goes into one section. Making skins is easier and likely cheaper than bug fixes. So that‚Äôs a loose argument. Queues have literally just been fixed. They‚Äôre trying to work on them, respect that please. They‚Äôre not ignoring the fans, nor are they going on their own accord. New content is almost required to keep the game fresh, it‚Äôs not like the games unplayable rn and needs an overhaul. They haven‚Äôt been incompetent, they just haven‚Äôt been able to live up to your long lists of difficult demands you seem to apparently have authority over. They‚Äôre only human, they are trying to fix the game. They can‚Äôt always tailor to the critics needs
---
Don't get me wrong I understand that they tried their best. I understand that and every update there is some bug fixes. I would appreciate it if they started hot fixing things so we don't have to wait every 3 months but it is what it is. Yes I understand that accompany can't accommodate every single player but what they can do is take 6 months out of the busy schedule of releasing microtransactions and a new killer that's going to get bullied immediately to just balance change as much as possible and just clean house when it comes to bugs.
---
You‚Äôre right, but I was replying to the comment calling her work ‚Äúlow tier crap‚Äù and saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúlazy and panders to upvotes‚Äù.  OP shouldn‚Äôt be discouraged from posting on reddit because she‚Äôs a girl and people upvote her.
---
There are no god windows or infinite‚Äôs anymore, they‚Äôve all been removed for a very long time now. Noel isn‚Äôt broken, but moris are and yes they need to go.

Fungoose is probably the most talented killer player I have seen. He is a killer main on twitch that has over 9k hours in dbd. He plays both survivor and killer and provides some very good educational content regarding his plays and builds that he uses. He also chooses to not use add-ons when playing killer to make it more difficult for himself.
---
Zubatlel is another killer main who is very talented at both survivor and killer. Very strong Huntress main.
---
Scottjundd is a friend of Zubatlel and also has some educational content regarding killer on his youtube channel. 
---
For survivor content, Ussylis has great tutorials and high level survivor gameplay on youtube which is helpful for understanding loops and flashlighting.
---
Thanks

Why is that so important to you that without it the devs are suddenly useless? Cuz that‚Äôs how the rest of u are treating it. And I don‚Äôt think this change is as simple as you claim for it to be. I‚Äôm no game dev but I‚Äôm sure they made an executive deduction to focus on the games problems than ‚Äòooh. A Christmas tree‚Äô

lol

okay dude

Are they paying you? Can you hook me up? Difficult demands? It's difficult to have a working game? C'mon dude, just stop.
---
OoO = Object of Obsession. A Laurie perk that shows the aura of the survivor and the killer to each other if the survivor looks in the direction of the killer. It is a perk commonly used by either someone in a voice-comm team who's always telling everyone what the killer is doing or someone looking to bait the killer into chasing them.  
---
EW = Evil Within. Michael Myer's power which has 3 tiers gained by stalking survivors. You're not supposed to stay in the 1st tier because you're very slow and you can't gain bloodlust.
---
Mess with Scott, die and rot.
---
We already know it happens. The Fog Whisperer discord? It's little more than a place for streamers to complain to the devs about players who they want banned for various petty reasons.
---
Exactly, I posted my cosplay once thinking it was cool and people would want to see it, it made it to the front page of a popular sub and all of a sudden people were shitting on it, pointing out things that never crossed my mind.  I took it down because I didn‚Äôt care about the upvotes, I just wanted people to stop commenting.  Not everybody does shit for upvotes.
---
Within those 6 months they would lose a lot of money and support. Content is necessary to keep the game going. Without it interest is lost. Don‚Äôt act like they‚Äôre doing nothing cuz that‚Äôs total bs
---
People literally told them to do less events and focus on other things and they did. Now y‚Äôall are screeching
---
I really hope bhvr understands that they cultivated a player base utterly incapable of being pleased
---
Anyway, literally the most recent content release is not paid, but go off I guess.
---
We need to get all of the survivors together...

Trigger this...
---
"Everybody dance now"
---
I would reccomend swapping out self care for bond or iron will.  I did that and I have seen great success.
---
I never said the devs are useless. They have an entire team dedicated to just the creative side of this game. With all the new players in the game now, events are more important than ever because they add something new to the same old game. Running around with party starters is a blast and it‚Äôs nice to see some festivity. Nearly every popular game has holiday events but a HORROR game can‚Äôt even do a Halloween event correctly? That‚Äôs just sad.
---
I feel like Killer is the harder to play role. As a Killer, you have to manage way too many things at the same time in order to win. Not to mention every single killer has a different playstyle and skillcap.
---
The player base is incapable to being pleased and disproportionate responses is essentially a religion practice to a lot of people here
---
Ruining others day, is not having fun. You are sad
---
&gt; fucking no one dodges someone for just being Claudette 
---
Just to be clear here: We are talking about 4 Claudettes in a team and not a single Claudette here?
---
Because if it's a single Claudette: You are right, nearly noone in their right mind would do that (well I mean, I'm pretty sure there are some people, but like I said noone in their right mind...). But thats not what OP is talking about here.
---
OP is talking about killers dodging lobbys where there are 4 Claudettes. And he's right, it isn't uncommon to get dodged if you are a 4x Claudette team, actually it's not uncommon for nearly any team that consists of the the same character 4 times. Some people just assume "Oh yeah, they will be toxic" (regardless if they bring items or not). And I can kinda understand why they think so. About half of these teams I had really are toxic. The other half however is fine and just likes to play the same character. However I don't like to dodge these teams just because they could, potentially, be assholes.
---
He's popular and well known streamer with lots of viewers and lots of detractors, so gets a lot of attention from the community. So even if you are not a fan of Tru3, you'll hear about him as he constantly gets into war of words with other streamers and people who bait him for a response.
---
the shake makes it 10x better, not gonna lie I screamed
---
Best survivor player in my oppinion is ussylis.
---
I don't agree with his perk ratings, but his looping is really impressive.
---
Too bad you're not in PS4. I'd play swf anytime üòÅ
---
Uploads have existed on torrent sites since before the movie even came out.
---
Do nothing
---
If you have a good game sense by example of T walls, infinites or if the killer respects the pallet and you know how to loop then do your magic.
---
But if not, then try to keep your distances but it doesn't mean that you shouldn't help your team or hide when you hear half a heart beat :D
---
Insidious + Agitation + Iron Grasp + Mad Grit or NOED
---
Have fun :)

1000 IQ TRAPPER PLAY
---
This is amazing. Needs more upvotes
---
Dad?
---
Discordance more but pop synergiZes well with surveillance
---
Aight
---
That's actually the default playstyle for every killer that started playing in 2016
---
Play normally, and then basement anyone in death hook. Youre less likely to get DCs, or people running afap
---
Killers aren't hard to learn, they are hard to win as. My point is muscle memory and gaining experience.
---
it is just logic that wasting 30 seconds to heal is a dumb idea when a gen alone takes 80 seconds ur wasting 37% of that time just healing
---
fairly sure that you couldn't change ur name on PS4 at least when I used to own a ps4 like 2 years ago
---
I'm going to say this and leave this here because apparently balance doesn't matter.
---
 dead by daylight release is so much content they can afford for at least a six-month bug fix. Given how many killers and survivors there are this quite a lot of content. The running joke is that Friday 13th had balance but no content and dead by daylight is the opposite.
---
Oh I believe they're doing something. Balance is exceedingly important. Without it it'll just frustrate people even more. Has your game continues to gain more content balance only becomes a problem when it's not maintained.
---
The doctor is finally getting a rework after he was released May 11th 2017... that's way too long for a rework or even a buff to get made.
---
Then you had Freddy. That was a long one.
---
They're doing something but I don't think it's balanced. Making money is one thing but not maintaining maintenance is another.
---
The doctor buff looks interesting
---
I mean... it IS her "weapon", so...
---
But Hybridpanda isn‚Äôt amazing at the game he‚Äôs just alright.
---
I'm on console and these days if often stutters like this, sadly
---
Looook a penny !
---
Fixated is good for survivor mains that barely play killer, so that you get a basic understanding of scratch marks. If you use your sprint bursy correctly you will mostly keep your exhaistion at 99%, so that you can keep running and not waste your sprint burst. Walking 20 percent faster is not that big of a deal, since walking is usually time wasting anyway. Dedicating an entire perk slot for fixated is not worth it in my opinion.
---
myers. he‚Äôs such a cool killer but he‚Äôs just terrifying to go against.. one day i‚Äôll buy him (and his lack of pants) if i get good enough using splinters.
---
Legend
---
the link should take you to the correct time. In case you're on mobile and it doesn't work there, it's at 2:25:15
---
Haha sometimes the same stuff happens to me like, one teammate is recovering under a pallet and i use it instead of healing him xD
---
I'm a Survivor main and it'd have to be Trapper for me as well. He's the only killer that doesn't have to outplay me to catch me. Other than Trapper, it'd be Ghostface. Ghostface is my favourite killer in the game along with Myers but he can mindgame easily because of his short size as well as hide his red stain on demand which adds more mindgame potential when looping him.
---
About the 2 hour and 25 minute-ish mark.
---
Probably there‚Äôs not that many players in Australia
---
Hillbilly his chainsaw gets annoying because it seems like I am the only one who gets hit by it but overall he is a fair character to play against.
---
Paid actors :P

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/edbbok/what_sensitivity_do_you_guys_use_for_both_killer/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I love how Huntress's hatchets ate bigger than Bubba's hammer. Can we agree that Freddy's glove feels as long as Oni's kanobo in game though?
---
What 6 second swap means?
---
I don't really like it. I'm all for diversity in cosmetics and more creative options to customize the world and characters, but the charms themselves are underwhelming and silly. Especially when oftentimes there are four separate recolors of the same charm (e.g. the Trapper head and the Botany charm) which is an overall disappointment.
---
I do like that there is an attempt to provide alternative challenges and diversify gameplay, but the reward system is too grindy for my liking. It also further clutters the GUI; I definitely prefer the old design of DbD's menus being very elegant and simplistic. Now there are multiple values to track and it draws me away from the mood and atmosphere of the game, and instead I feel less of an internal drive to play an inherently interesting game and more an external drive to grind points
---
No, but i dont really care if it spreads or not lol i was just saying my opinion
---
Me. Im the best. Hands down.
---
Great post. I have a question, what if the demogorgon arm was fully extended?
---
I don't think I've laughed like that at a comment in at least a week.
---
He laughed at the idea of you worrying about DC penalties because your house caught fire. Chill. It was funny you entitled manchild.
---
Try verifying the integrity of the game files, that might get rid of them.
---
Yep. Thanks!
---
Your ideas are exactly why I'm extremely skeptical of new game modes
---
&gt; Traitor
---
why would anyone wanna play this? a survivor working with the killer breaks the game and people complain about this all the time in their games
---
&gt; VIP
---
literally a tunneling simulator where the VIP is going to hyper immerse far away from everything else and the killer just loses
---
&gt; Manhunt
---
I actually don't know what this one means. I feel like it's connected to some other game I don't play
---
It‚Äôs usually to be nice, but if survivors wiggle it‚Äôs hard for the killer to find the hatch and let the survivor know that they were given mercy
---
..What?
---
Love it
---
Swapping to toolbox/flashlight last 6 seconds in the lobby.
---
People do this because they think the killer will dodge or prevents the killer from equipping franklins.
---
thank you so much :o
---
Add TptH and totems for max grabbin.
---
love using her for       these reasons.   so much fun to sneak up on people.
---
Pack it up, boys!

You are casted out into the depths of hell

Haha, that was always my thought too, the young steve buschemi. xD

Imagine doing this and still thinking Oni is ‚Äúdead‚Äù after the fixes lul
---
No it isn't. I am just complaining about the diff from the movie to the game.
---
Not the same thing, but okay
---
Yes it is extremely difficult to have a fully working balanced functioning game. Thats why money is required to fuel it
---
Easy way to farm that challenge is just span Pig's headtrap until you get 6 great checks
---
mostly luck tbh
---
Thank you. You can‚Äôt please everyone, but this lot are complaining because they don‚Äôt get some Christmas lights, while major important changes are being worked on
---
These aren‚Äôt for competitive use, just for some fun with friends. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend playing any of these without voice coms as the objective is to have fun and have a laugh with friends. 
---
(And Manhunt is basically like hide and seek, but if you get found you can run away and try to lose the killer, your playing against fellow survivors to see who‚Äôs the last one standing)
---
bruh
---
Basement Bubba is perfect for this.
---
NAH THATS LIGHT WORK HOW ABOUT SACRIFICE ALL 4 SURVIVORS IN THE BASEMENT IN THE SAME GAME LIKE HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE AT ANY RANK ABOVE 15 WHEN SURVIVORS BECOME COMPETENT
---
SOMEONE CUT OFF DEMO HAND
---
 Poor Demodog...
---
Why does the clown love fingers tho
---
yea welcome to this life from all the times I have played Trapper basement is my friend bc easy to trap and easy to keep down maybe 2/5 has everyone died in basement
---
&gt; I love playing against SWF personally. 
---
You say this cause you are an experienced player, but for a baby killer like me it's not that enjoyable.
---
Agreed. Basement 4k took me 5 or 6 tries but even then getting all the killer ones this time only took like 4-5 hrs. The 4 gen one and to a lesser extent the 4 stun one are the 2 survivor ones I see taking the longest
---
I dunno... 5 basement hooks in one game and 4 basement kills in a single game are way too situational.
---
The one time I burned an offering for Sanctum of Wrath, knowing the basement has always appeared in the middle, it appeared in the far corner at killer shack. Needless to say, RNG and where I'm finding survivors has made it too situational.
---
GUESS I WILL CAMP WITH INSIDIOUS AND HOPE THEY AREN'T SWF
---
They‚Äôre focused more on the game and their lore than a few decorations. How does adding a Christmas tree improve the game more than queue time changes? I get why u would want an eventful but I think it‚Äôs down right ungrateful to complain otherwise. + a lot of people on this t read have called the devs useless. Sorry for tying u in with them :)
---
woah, yeah. Degenerates would Intern-kun say..
---
2000+ hours of my own time for this godforsaken challenge
---
Every one is baby
---
i love it, looks great ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
A little bit confused on this one could you explain a little better?
---
1 less hook is somehow the worst thing in the world, yet Survivors bring items and perks that make their objective 50% faster constantly and you don't see Killers complaining. Basically if Survivors are allowed to run Brand New Parts and (nerfed) instaheals and Adrenawin Crutch Strike Free Win Time bullshit then I think it's perfectly fair for a Killer to hook you one less time.
---
It's really not hard to avoid getting hooked twice, yet alone once. There's flat out a rift for it. If you see a Mori try being stealthy for once, instead of teabagging and clicking your flashlight because this game should be renamed to Highschool Bully Simulator: Horror Movie Edition.
---
Name checks out
---
Mm like cleansing demogorgons portals where there‚Äôs no great skill check bit so you can only get good skill checks
---
Oh ok
---
Probably Oni just hit too hard.
---
So you were playing Trapper.
---
Setting traps is toxic my dude.
---
If you set traps, you are:
---
-camper
---
-cheater
---
-tunneler
---
-trashcan
---
-trash
---
-sweaty
---
-n00b
---
-toxic
---
-rat
---
And
---
-Egypter (???)
---
Fascinating, since tier 4 only released Wednesday.
---
Each time I tried this one someone would dc after being hooked in the basement it took a couple tries but I was able to. Just keep trying til u get lucky
---
I actually forgot Iron Grasp was a perk. I was just running Agitation for the 5 in one game
---
When I got it it was an ace vaulting the same unsafe pallet over and over again on hawkins.
---
Yeah, just like every other killer is at the survivor's mercy. Which isn't how it should be. A killer should never be the weak role vs. an individual survivor. And again, her countermeasure is built into her power because there are plenty of pallets and vaults where she HAS to guess which side you'll end up on.

The devs were high on Iron Will when they made Jeff.

I never said "console players can suck dick." I said that unfortunately the console experience is far worse and there's little we can do about it. Honestly in regards to Cuntchido the banning process on PS4 is so piss-poor from what I've heard that trying to get him off the platform would be like *actually* curing cancer.
---
If I had a magical "make the game better for ~20% of the playerbase" wand I'd gladly fix all the issues that the console versions of Dead by Daylight has. But as it is the console experience is objectively worse than the PC version, and everyone except Behaviour knows this. I can complain about it as much as I want and maybe the devs will listen but until I buy stocks in Behaviour Interactive I have no say on their business decisions. And honestly as a business major I completely understand why they're leaving console players out to dry.
---
Range + Beam is a lot of fun actually. You have a 40 meter beam! Make people working on gens go mad while chasing someone else! The ring one is worthless in general and I agree that, for the default shape anyway, range extension is a trap
---
Only one I have been struggling with is the 4 pallets in one game. I keep playing against doctors and nurses

Killers are harder to learn than survivors. A killer has to learn how to loop just as well as a survivor plus knowing when and where to drop chase and when to pressure gens. Also a Killer needs to learn and remember if a specific survivor has some specific perks like dead hard. Plus Killer's have to learn how to use their specific ability to end chases asap or else it's already a loss most of the time. With huntress, If you can't hit your hatchets your gonna lose no matter what.

Max‚Äôs journal day 14: I have successfully infiltrated the survivor‚Äôs ranks and now freely walk amongst them, I don‚Äôt believe any of them suspect a thing.

Just you, I like to see kate, jane and an occasional nea in my games.

Lol yup that's what happened in a match against a Trapper. He messaged us that he needed to complete an archive challenge so we all went in his traps about 30 times each and he let us go. Good times for everyone.
---
Oh, I'm glad someone else posted this! I had the same issues over the last few days.  
---
It happens often, when the killer doesn't ready up and the counter goes down to zero. My screen goes black, the sound is stuck in the "loading screen whoosh" and I have to reboot my PC.  
---
I thought that this were some problems with my new hardware, maybe , but now I know that I'm not the only one. I think technical issues are better discussed at the dev website., but good to ask around whether there are others facing the same problem.
---
What sound affect specifically? I'd have to redo it. And do you want the text at the top?

Changing it to permanently exposed completely cuts out the use of Dead Hard, Resilience, and This Is Not Happening unless your change also has them somehow have access to injured state after... unhooking? So you would have to make yourself get hooked to have access to your perks? Seems like it would make it worse than it is now.
---
The only argument I can see with No Mither getting a change is changing how much of the grunting of pain is reduced per tier or giving a BP bonus. Just slap WGLF into No Mither, just rename No One Left Behind or We'll Make It to the new WGLF and just abolish the old NOLB or We'll Make It.
---
I get that you don't like that it alerts everyone "hey, no mither here", but with the way it is built and how it is supposed to synergize with other perks, the little notification is a small price. 
---
Devs have already said that the point of the perk is to make it harder but more rewarding for certain scenarios. Being able to get up for free instead of relying on allies, constant access to injury-related perks, hiding your tracks while injured, and not needing to waste time on healing at the exchange of OKHO. It's self-imposed hard mode. High risk, high reward. Don't expect it to be buffed into a non-meme perk any time soon.
---
You need to take a break if this is the kinda thing triggering you.
---
Like you honestly just post this? Lol
---
Feng is too adorable to kill.
---
If I get 2nd stage on the first hook and I'm not getting camped 99/100 times I just let myself die. If my teammates aren't going to help me, why should I even try? The game's already over at that point.

If anyone on Xbox wants to help me improve with Billy or Nurse in kyf add my gt tridxnts. I would prefer you to be at least purple ranks as I usually play against purples and reds.

I still get stomped a lot. But having a team that's not dicky about it regardless if you're good or bad is very nice. I've had games where I lost and didn't hook a single person and I've had people actually message me apologizing. Idk. For a community with a lot of toxcitiy.. Its refreshing to have some really nice people. I promise you'll get better and hopefully you'll start running into more nicer players üíú
---
This happened while I was playing Steve.
---
The funny thing is that even in those videos they make it clear it took them multiple attempts to get it done before they were all killed. The latest one I saw said they died 2 - 3 times before they were successful. And they weren‚Äôt salty about it.
---
the wya the jeff looks at you lolll. guy was like "ok ive seen enough"
---
Usually they put in second and third string players, so your analogy doesn‚Äôt work
---
What if he's a second or third string player tho?
---
its her axe not one of her hatchets
---
I can understand your frustration. You were hoping for Bubba but got the wrong chainsaw friend.
---
I say it looks nice, well done.
---
Have to mention that in your first analogy then?
---
This is fake, Freddys gloves are actually two miles long
---
The amount of friendly farming that's been happening on both sides recently has me really pleased. Before, you were lucky for a game to just goof around on, but now it happens a lot more often, and points are shared by all. 
---
Nice game &lt;3
---
No, it wouldn't. And they probably should. I'm just point out why, in general, they cut back *a lot* on events and I feel like people's responses are just incredibly disproportionate. I couldn't care less if we get any sort of Holiday theme in the lobbies and on hooks/generators
---
What *I'm* upset over is how people couldn't handle not winning every game for like a week and a half so we'll never get a fucking awesome Halloween event again

Wish I was on stream for this lol, love you Scott

And then you check their achievements and they don't have the Rank 1 achievement for either side lmao.

AWAY FOR A WHOLE WERK SO NO GAME.
---
You're the one tbagging at a exit gate, but im "entitled"...
---
Exactly, why wouldnt you one shot people. You have the option for both . Use the stick , not the sword.
---
I can choose who I want to kill or not. You nor any survivors don't have any say in who I decide to give the hatch to or not. You made a post complaining about something very stupid.
---
no it has been happening to everyone since Rank Reset me at rank 5 as killer still get rank 20 survivors in all my games
---
Win=report
---
I don't get the point of this post. I'm a Survivor main but whenever I play killer, I'll always try to give Steve, Quentin or Jake the hatch. Let people do what they want dude.
---
How am I contradicting myself? All I mean is those who play casually would never be able to finish the rift.  
---
I would not consider my playtime (when the rift started) as casual and I still think that I won‚Äôt make it.

If you look at Apex‚Äôs battlepass, I finished that one 2 weeks ago and it still runs for another 5 (or 4, don‚Äôt remember). 
---
Having to play an hour (an hour in a match) every day to finish the rift is a lot of time, with wait times being long (getting tunneled as a survivor in between) which can easily run up to 2-2.5 hours on daily basis. 
---
I might make it this rift but I don‚Äôt feel it in me to do this again.
---
I just used this build. I was on the version of Macmillan with the Mine, the basement was in the min. I gave up all early game to set up traps and then when one guy got trapped it was all over. First try!
---
He made a mistake hitting you right? If he didn‚Äôt hit you he could have grabbed you out of the exit?
---
There‚Äôs literally 2 perks to prevent this, use them.
---
It‚Äôs not too difficult to tell if the killer wants something. Whether it‚Äôs traps or pallets, etc. And if you‚Äôve already won or lost, might as well help them finish it.
---
bc a grind is something that requires time but you said the rift does not so which one is it? is the rift not a grind or is it a grind?
---
Ahhhh, the fabled 3 survivor unhook. Almost as bad as a no survivor unhook. Ive had this happen playing Leatherface..... let‚Äôs just say, they didn‚Äôt wait for me to walk very far before they went for the unhook. Post match chat was fill was a lot of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a PoS.‚Äù and ‚ÄúThat killer is OP.‚Äù
---
It's "bEcAuSe He Is ToXiC" and they hate him for that one time when he was a teen and hacked the game to get back the cosmetics BHVR wouldn't return after a glitch removed those cosmetics from a lot of accounts, which he then got banned for (i think he also added some extra skins while he was at it, but still that's what some call him a cheater for)
---
I'm not entirely sure about this but that's what Ive gathered
---
Imagine having a cool and versatile power that lets you travel the map at high speed and instantly down people *and* that doesn't stun you after being used for 10 seconds. :C

How should i do 4 basement kills if i dont go there MEGAN?!
---
Every killer and their mum tunnels Scoops Steve into the ground, I have to show them that someone out there respects the Scoops!
---
Lol nope!
---
Im a rank 16 killer and was paired with 4 red ranks yesterday. It sucked too, I just made the switch from console to PC, so i'm having to start over on collecting perks, etc. and I played my first match as the Spirit on PC.
---
On console i'm not even a bad spirit, i have all of the perks, and stay in purple/green ranks, and there I can even handle a red rank or two if they happen to be there. This match was total destruction though.
---
Sounds about right.. I still love the time they tried to pay someone $100 to cheat and kill him ‚Äúany way possible‚Äù to stop his 50 escapes. He still did it. And he wasn‚Äôt even stopped at 50 he just quit.
---
The mob mentality can be strong.
---
You definitely are
---
Hey yeah! I really fell in love with DBD, it's a piece of shit at times but man is this game awesome at it's best :3
---
r/dbdgonewild would want to have a word with you.
---
Toxic yui
---
Wait, what?
---
Niceee let‚Äôs go üëèüëèüëè
---
‚ÄúYou has ruin‚Äù
---
Scott: Skill checks hard /s
---
Brain dead random not realizing he‚Äôs joking: nO tHeYre nOt.
---
Then why you didn‚Äôt get a gen done. Dumb ass people
---
Lol...it was intended as a joke. I suspect sarcasm and irony are deeply lost on this subreddit.
---
Why would you play a game that is annoying/boring/making you upset? Why would you force yourself through 15 mins of that instead of just moving on another game? Nobody rly cares about other teammates, get over it.
---
I would feel bad for the killer but he used NOED so I mean, this is the best ending for the match possible, assuming you guys all got decent points for the round.
---
I dunno. This has been true for a long time now but it's way wonkier lately than previously
---
I WAS PLAYING AGAINST A FREDDY WHO WAS CLEARLY TRYING TO DO THE SACRIFICE FOUR IN THE BASEMENT OR MAYBE THE FIVE HOOKS IN BASEMENT IDK, DAVID FUCKING DC's JUST AS HES GETTING HOOKED FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THE BASEMENT. SO I RAN DOWN THERE AND JUST WAITED FOR FREDDY TO CATCH THE LAST PERSON AND BRING THEM DOWN AND LET HIM HOOK ME.
---
CHECKED IN THE POST GAME AND HE GOT HIS CHALLENGE DONE, BUT FUCK YOU DAVID IF YOUR OUT THERE  YOU LIL SHIT. 
---
ALSO WHY DO I A RANK 18 KILLER GET MATCHED AGAINST A FULL RANK 8 SWF SQUAD? FKU MATCHMAKING
---
Imagine being able to consistently get 4ks BUBBA GANG BUBBA GANG BUBBA GANG
---
He was very hard tunneling the Quentin. After the blind he tunneled me the rest of the game and I died on first hook
---
Wow that‚Äôs really a whole arm
---
Plunder gang
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
Holy crap..... this post is just getting so popular also thanks for the u p v o t e s 
---
This post was made by a billy main
---
Hag with Agitation, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit, Make Your Choice, and decent addons on Haddonfield.
---
Basement hook one, easier on Haddonfield as the basement is always in the center, and then get out of range for MYC. Make sure to trap outside the little window by the basement entrance if it's open so they can't vault it to safety.
---
It might take a try or two since DCs, but it's very doable.
---
Hes the best in my heart
---
Yeah was pretty upset ngl
---
It is harder to play against a coordinated team using mic communication than it is against 4 randoms with no real social obligation to help one another.
---
But have you seen the christmas dwelves?
---
What kind of monster could kill that? That's kitten-drowning crazy
---
I would instantly buy Ash‚Äôs sweater if it was on the merch store
---
A trap they all saw him put down by sniping and then step in? Ok.
---
hey, it's that Skallagrim dude.
---
Dead by San Andreas
---
Being toxic in reply to a compliment to someone else. Wow
---
Don‚Äôt knock it before you try it. it‚Äôs still in its beta practically as why it hasn‚Äôt been released in NA yet so people so get a bad impression of it but this was the ‚Äúworst‚Äù in terms of broken in any sense I‚Äôve seen the game be so far. Don‚Äôt let my half a min shitpost video deter you from playing it is all I‚Äôm saying.
---
You just summed up my day so far. Tunneled and camped
---
Nah, they need an excuse to play like an ass. That way they can just say ‚Äúmy bad. I needed archives.‚Äù
---
&gt;using object because you just want adapt Laurie but the killer assumes you‚Äôre toxic and tunnels you every time :(
---
Noice
---
That‚Äôs an opinion
---
yes
---
Except I would add, "Go play killer for a little while then. Killer cant spare you if your playing killer.
---
Yea I doubt when survivors are complaining in the chat about the rank 20 in the game they aren't really SWF and if they where they someone is a cunt but from the none private profiles ive seen I can assume they aren't SWF
---
It should because everyone has the same lunge range but Freddy, because his arm is shorter, looks like he‚Äôs going farther.
---
I‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs easier to use Trapper.  As soon as you get one guy in the basement the rest will follow.  I did this in one game.  Use Agitation, Ruin, Iron Grasp, and Nurses calling.  I hooked one guy, set traps around the perimeter of the shack and one entrance. Basically turned the shack to a roach motel. They can get in but the can‚Äôt get out.  I hooked two right away. At one point I had three in the basement and I saw the last one healing himself behind a rock close to the shack.  Downed him, threw him on a hook. Game Over.
---
The flashlight clicking tho :((

I'm pretty sure it's a chance to occur, meaning sometimes you'll get clockwise skillchecks still, or counter-clockwise skillchecks. Add on top of that, it being a madness skillcheck so it can be anywhere on screen, or any other skillcheck related perks Doctor's commonly run and I can see  it being rather confusing.
---
Don't try and pretend you're a god who always hits Great skillchecks 100% of the time, it's a decent change and better than what Obedience notes do now.
---
He used Noed, for me He was a scummy player. Sorry dude
---
Yes. You are the only person on this sub.
---
Yea I just started killer and am rank 20 and getting rank 8-12 constantly
---
I always give hatch to the survivor who did nothing if anything they helped me win
---
Got to love how the absolute unit of the Clown has these itty bitty teensey weensey weapons.
---
Nope just you
---
And that‚Äôs on Dwight
---
I would like them to give better rewards if they‚Äôre going to make it a serious grind.
---
Lol
---
Nobody is saying ace or David has the best cosmetics their cosmetics are doo doo
---
He could use your logic and say you used DS and adrenaline so you‚Äôre scummy as well, and the poor guy only got one hook you don‚Äôt gotta rub it in his face
---
yeah but that was on top of everything else. Someone could run you for 30 seconds on like 2 pallets. And also at one point it was quicker too.
---
What do you think 'meme' means?
---
This has pretty much been my assumption regarding him, doesn't make it feel less like bullshit though when running from him lol
---
They could even do one of the "two week + turn around" or "won't process until a certain number ordered" services so they don't have to hold lots of stock- we wo wait!
---
Did you even read my post?
---
It works very well. Dota actually has 2 systems in place, Behavior Score and Low Priority. Low Priority is as mentioned a punishment for being reported for feeding/ability abuse, and abandons. 
---
Behavior Score however determines who you get matched with in addition to rank, and it is effectively a ranking of toxicity based on being reported for communication abuse and abandons. Much like your actual MMR, behavior score can be raised and lowered over time.
---
While there is a lot of overlap, the key difference is a good, kind player with a high behavior score will get a low priority punishment, finish it, then go back to dota. Having low Behavior Score will match you with equally toxic/non-toxic people.
---
The only real problem is that DbD doesn't have enough players to implement a full system that works like this.
---
Same hitbox for all of them
---
Yeah exactly.  You get that chase where they immediately run to the outskirts of the map with no knowledge of routing or looping etc.  It's also around this time that you noticed that instead of following a trail of blood their characters actually leaving behind a trail of Baby Einstein DVD's.  It's like come on Weird you can't possibly be thinking of killing this lil fella.
---
Plunder &gt; Bond
---
Rocky road is shit my dude. Get some mint chocolate chip instead
---
Lmao why is everyone responding acting like watching a stream of a game you're in is on the same level of committing crimes
---
"I have never gotten tricked by a pattern going out-of-order, in fact I don't even know what pattern recognition is."
---
So guys, every content is on disc! Have demogorgon, clown, spirit and all survivors coming with them :)
---
High possibility
---
Don‚Äôt go near the basement
---
You have to remember it depends on what killer they're playing on console.
---
He was a doc so I assume that's why he struggled more than most people.
---
But that doesn't make it any less satisfying for me, still ways to counter a 360 on console. Same way people do it on pc.
---
The challenges. Basement Trapper is one of the best ways to do them. Blame bhvr for giving us stupid bullshit to do.
---
R
---
You should consider running Small Game.  I run it to hard counter NOED gamers and to find Ruins instataneously.  But when you get a Trapper bonus that perk lights up like a Christmas tree every 15 seconds to confirm this is a safe loop, this is a safe loop, avoid that loop.  It's insanely powerful midchase against Trapper.  Also very good against Pallet Freddy and Hag.
---
This is actually the first time I‚Äôve ever heard of Otz üòÖüòÖ but definitely a fan now and will check out that video
---
never used my ds, If so that would mean He was tunneling. no regrets
---
Because there's a challenge to sacrifice four survivors in the basement in one trial. Trapper with Agi, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit, plus Iri Stone and whatever else you want. Self-resetting traps and trap the hell out of basement and anyone you get down there probably stays.
---
Okay truee
---
unfortunate because your dunce hat is already in the mail
---
L E N G T H
---
I like how there's all these cool weapons and then there's hags and Demogorgon s arms
---
Yes that's right I've heard the story, over and over again
---
I'll give someone the hatch if I stomped their team or if they were the only one who didn't annoy me. You're damn right if someone clearly struggled against me and I beat people who were playing better than them I'm going to go easy if I can.
---
You might not realize how refreshing it is in chat as Killer to get ":D Thanks!" rather than spammed with toxic bullshit for doing your job.
---
If only there was a perk that allowed you to have a free hit state when you come off the hook inside the killer's terror radius.    
---
And then like what if there was this other perk that allowed you to get off the killer's shoulder if they down you again within a minute of coming off the hook.
---
Matchmaking has been a worsening problem for about a year now. It‚Äôs literally driving new players away from the game yet it still hasn‚Äôt been fixed
---
I like to imagine this is the only way the people setting this up could set up a check mate. Its always like "king trapped in a corner by a queen  and a rook". Or something incredibly simple. Like that guy who brags about being great at chess and only wins when they can take literally every other piece the opponent controls
---
i play on console which is definitely different than pc
---
ƒ∞ WANT KQTE DOR SURE!!
---
Because there's nowhere near as much material to work with. The author for One Piece puts out way more chapters per year than the author for Hunter X Hunter. Hunter X Hunter started just one year after One Piece but there's 965 chapters of One Piece and 390 chapters of Hunter X Hunter. Also even with way more content to work with, the One Piece anime is full of filler and it doesn't have great animation so most recommend you read it.
---
Of course not. I mean I hit regular great 70% of a time and doctor ruin counter clockwise could be hard af but then again. Is it really harder than doctors ruin that's appears randomly on a screen?
---
Seem pretty toxic to me
---
Yea 360s are always fun nonetheless
---
Goodnight to everyone except whoever made that bottom picture.
---
A friend of mine does. But oddly enough, it hasn't come up in my bloodweb yet.
---
Oh they do, anything to get a advantage, it‚Äôs petty if you ask me. Just play the game like your suppose to and get some skill... 
---
You won‚Äôt gain anything if you don‚Äôt learn.
---
You say its boring but playing killer normally can get very tiring/dull at times. 
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how many people still fall for insidious bubba/trappers basement and when it all goes to shit it‚Äôs just too funny
---
Super nice streamer I'm subscribed but skill wise he's just meh on both sides.
---
There is no need to insult somebody because he has different opinion. In fact, there is no reason to downvote somebody because he has a different opinion but thats the way Reddit is I guess.
---
I don't say it will be trash mechanic, I just stated my personal opinion on the matter, that's all.
---
Merry Christmas everyone! I've had a blast playing with a lot of you this year!
---
Snag it when it does.  It's so underrated.  It makes me the hero of solo queue because randoms don't cleanse goddamn totems so it's NOED city if I don't bring it because that's how everyone gets down apparently on PS4.
---
Just don't watch him then?
---
I like watching him, he's genuinely great at the game, and backs up all his opinions. He's not sugar coating the game just because he's a fog whisperer. He's realistic in that he knows, like we all do, that a lot of the game can be broken or manipulated and that balance is way off.
---
That being said, the sub has been full of Tru3 stuff before, and no doubt will be again. There's hundreds of DBD streamers - just watch something you like.
---
His level of toxicity surpassed the most toxic asshole streamers in game today.  He makes AngryPug look like a damn saint.  He was the king of derank to bully before it became the popular thing to do.
---
Well Freddy can canonically stretch his arms so clearly they're just trying to be accurate to the lore!
---
Freddy‚Äôs weapon should be first, considering his lunge
---
What's the skull thing next to freddy's glove?
---
I believe the point here is that they are taunting him and do not plan to unhook him because they are still salty over the match they played with him when he was killer.
---
Kolbaser intensifies\*
---
Jeff walks up all casual and is like ‚Äúwhat you doing there David‚Äù
---
David: ‚ÄúJust getting them arm curls in‚Äù
---
just dont step on the traps lmao
---
I know
---
Tru3talent is great at an easy, solved game. 
---
Is that tru3 enough 4 u?
---
They can still somehow reach you even though you are several feet from the ledge
---
i didnt think of trapper, i used invisible bubba. it was obvious where i was and ppl would teabag and flashlight me even while in my predator cloaked status. but i got dem good. i had deerstalker on to find bodies
---
Oh whats this? Franklis demise? Oh ok ill be dead or dc) then!
---
Were you injured
---
This is a good way of putting all this. Puts it in a different mindset. Thanks!
---
I try playing Killer when my SO isn‚Äôt available to do SWF. Things make much more sense when you‚Äôre on the other side as to why you‚Äôre found and hooked.
---
I can never find anyone until 2-3 gens are done. But then I‚Äôm able to kill 2-3 people after that. There‚Äôs just too many gens to patrol at the start and I‚Äôm not good at figuring out where they are.
---
Also, apparently we are supposed to be able to hear people walking and breathing but maybe I‚Äôm tone deaf to those sounds.
---
Literally every suggestion on this sub is ‚Äúhow I‚Äôd fix DBD by adding more survivor nerfs‚Äù
---
The facetious jokes in the past about killers just wanting to press a button for a 4K is sounding like it will become a realistic suggestion from you lot in due time.
---
I think Joey‚Äôs Karambits should take the spot for smallest
---
I honestly think that the problem people really have isn‚Äôt what he says necessarily it‚Äôs how he says it that people don‚Äôt like
---
we have to stop watching streamers. games are for playing. these people are making money off of you suckers
---
Read my post
---
oh look mom i escaped and clicked my flashlight, u proud of me now?
---
Exhaustion perks did get a giant nerf like last year I think?  You used to get back your exhaustion perk at half the speed if you kept running, so if you were good enough you could get multiple sprint bursts or dead hards in a single chase.
---
And they just nerfed the biggest offender, balanced landing, to take away the passive stagger removal.
---
Idk I find some of them entertaining to watch. You also learn new things to help make you better
---
Every patch sounds get worse and worse grass is nearly impossible to hear unless your playing a nearly silent killer with their footsteps or have to bass boost your audio to the point where you might go deaf.
---
That literally sounds like they're gutting everything that makes him somewhat good and replacing it with complete garbage. Sure am glad they're nerfing already garbage killers.
---
It‚Äôs getting boring playing trapper every game but they should have thought ahead and not put a bunch of trapper challenges in.
---
Winning is winning, wether it‚Äôs by a inch or a mile!
---
Check Mate MoFo! 
---
Merry Christmas BTW
---
maps have been complained about since game got released my guy. And there is a very good reason for it, since alot of them are horribly unbalanced towards one side.
---
I love stats so I‚Äôm onboard with this.
---
maybe it's bugged because you should go 30/40/50% faster while crawling?  You still get the ability to recover while you crawl though, right?
---
bad map design is the main issue. the hospital is crazy with vault windows
---
How else would he be crawling?  You might be thinking of the wrong perk man
---
Oh man, poor Grandma.
---
When using tenacity you have to be recovering to go faster ( it allows you to crawl and recover at the same time)
---
Yup. It'll likely never happen if you're just playing normally so people have to do shit like that if they want it done. It's even more fun when you're hooking the last person in the basement and they decide to DC because they know you're going for it and want to deny you, even though all they're doing is ensuring another group of survivors has to deal with the same playstyle for another round.
---
Its hard to notice but it is faster
---
If I saw that I wouldn't blink either.
---
i bet you could also do this as overcharge freddy
---
BBQ and Iron Maiden combo is so good for this reason
---
Many people that you don‚Äôt even know make money off of you. Streamers making money off people isn‚Äôt a problem
---
I don‚Äôt think server is down but I‚Äôve been having the same issue on and off on PS4 too for the past few weeks.
---
This sounds really good
---
Unpopular opinion.  Sex feels good.
---
I think the reason that the Rift might be XP based instead of BP based is due to the discrepancy in BP earned by killers and survivors. If it were BP based, you'd see a lot of people queueing up as killer, resulting in extended matchmaking times.
---
From my perspective, I don't think I'd change the Rift itself that much. The value for money is good. Even if you complete up to the Nurse's weapon, you're still getting at least triple the value you would if you were just buying cosmetics (and that's excluding charms). If anything, I might reduce the amount of required XP slightly, probably 10% or less.
---
I do feel like it's a bit of a grind if I want to complete it, but I may not be one of the players who they expect to complete it. Regardless, I'll get close, so it's been well worth my investment.
---
What I would change is the way that Rift fragments are earned through Tome challenges. The current Tome challenges create farming games, and games where people intentionally ignore the objective to work on something else. This makes the game less fun for the other players.
---
My proposal is that player could equip a number of challenges at one time, and make progress toward all of the equipped challenges at once. This allows for challenges that require more of a grind (complete XX generators), or more difficult challenges (unhook two people during EGC) without impeding someone's progress or making someone feel like they are stuck.
---
More difficult challenges could yield greater rewards. You could ask someone to heal 30 health states of other players, and offer 10 Rift fragments. For killers you could require them to damage 100 gens or pallets, and offer them an adequate amount of fragments.
---
Rather than following the web, a Tome would be completed when the player has amassed a certain amount of fragments (or points) from completing the challenges. This allows the player to play the way they want to while completing the challenges, keeping the game fun. It also reduces the number of farming games, or games where you see everyone fighting over unhooks.
---
I imagined a machine would have a perk that gave them stun resist, or something, to convey their unrelenting nature... But with spirit fury and relentless? Don't know that we need one...
---
God watching someone try to loop and stun me with a dream pallet is so fucking satisfying
---
Big false
---
I actually couldn't blink because of a bug that also caused Bill to freeze like that :D
---
I agree, I was intentionally being over the top
---
&gt; Wasn‚Äôt the hatch already reworked in favor of the killer? 
---
It was re-worked to end hatch stand-offs. There is an aspect that is killer sided: if the survivor and killer are both on it when it opens the killer action takes precedence. Other than that, I think in general it is equal sided.
---
&gt; And now he wants it to be even more in favor of the killer?
---
No, he doesn't want it to be cheese. And it is. The current hatch encourages slugging and hatch camping. And it essentially entitles the last survivor to an escape if the team sucks and gets decimated without getting anything done which I think is wrong. Or if a bunch of people just DC for no reason, the survivor can get hatch and the killer gets further fucked. Not okay.
---
&gt; And no, saying that he wants safe pallets gone is not a lie. In one of his streams I heard him saying how he wants EVERY pallet to be mindgamable (i.e. removal of safe pallets)
---
yeah you're gonna have to back this up. even if true i don't find that very objectionable. survivors complain about killers they perceive as having no counters, but apparently survivors having tools with no counter is fine?
---
&gt; I play both sides evenly, so don‚Äôt take this as me only seeing the game from one side.
---
neat most people do
---
&gt; I also hear him complain at least once a game about SWF. I understand they can be annoying to go against at times, but I feel like he expects to 4K EVERY game, and if he doesn‚Äôt achieve that he always blames something other than himself.
---
This is the one true (heh) point you've made. he does tend to do this and uses SWF as click bait for Youtube
---
&gt; I‚Äôm just not a big fan of his attitude toward the game.
---
then don't watch.
---
and how damn dark it is.  the new map is damn near unplayable because you cant see anything unless you turn your tv brightness up.
---
How much of an arrogant jackass is he to viewers that disagree with him or say slightly inaccurate information?   Many of the top streamers in dbd are little more than arrogant pricks if anyone so much as hints there might be a different viewpoint or way to play the game.
---
Big true what‚Äôs big false is a adept ace‚Äôa biased opinion
---
had to alter for context since in this scenario I‚Äôm prolly gettin chased by the killer
---
they are gutting everything that makes him terrible AND unfun to play against and making it actually good and fun to play against
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eddg4y/can_the_next_killer_run_like_this/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
This tome is about trapper so thats why, future ones will be about other killers
---
Maybe they could make generators more difficult at higher ranks without changing it at lower ranks somehow? Like just afford less progress for great skill checks at purple or red or make the great zone smaller so it's harder to be fast but doesn't punish newbies at the lower ranks.
---
Thrill of the Hunt
---
Just swap out that Self Care and it looks good.  I saw you and others mentioned Inner Strength instead I like that.  But honestly anything in place of Self Care will improve the build.
---
I haven‚Äôt had it at all until about 2 hours ago
---
&gt;The majority of the time when he plays survivor, he brings toolboxes with charge addons, so in my eyes he‚Äôs being a bit of a hypocrite.
---
I see what you coming from but I don't see why not bring toolboxes in this cause?
---
You don't know what killer you up against or what happens. You are free to bring whatever broken shit the game has, use them and still think they are bs. I have seen this across many games. More so in a team based game where someone else can use these tactics on you yourself.
---
Most satisfying game ever
---
Np. As you said because it‚Äôs online until it comes out in your region you might not get periodic updates for it like I do on Apple because I got dbd from the App Store and update from there; but I honestly haven‚Äôt had an Android device in a while so it‚Äôs just a heads up you might have to download updates/patches off websites before it comes out in your country because if your play store doesn‚Äôt have dbd you won‚Äôt get those updates automatically on Android.
---
This happens to me all the time lmaaaao. I always do like a double crouch right in killer's direction before I open an exit and then another one right before I run out, hoping they'll understand it's me trying to show gratitude and not BM lol.
---
I wonder why I chose to have him as one of my mains. Hmmmmm. Fire cosmetics
---
what kind of mad lad amputated demo and hag in the land of the fog??
---
Feng min
---
I understand that I'd be tunneled, but what about the blendettes who aren't me that don't get tunneled
---
Oh no, one of the weakest killers in the game used a perk. What an asshole /s
---
My point was meant as a joke and humor.
---
Niceeeeee I had a pig that I got two stuns on and then called me in the basement because i unbreaked into a pallet stun.
---
Scott came across a 4 man SWF carrying toolboxes with brand new part addons. They did the sneaky switch just before the match started. Not even 1 gen got completed. Imagine the rage in the post chat.
---
while a grab is not possible anymore, as long as you stand on the hatch as a killer when it opens you can close it before the survivor can escape. so yeah trapper should have just moved to the hatch to stand on it when it opens and immediately close it.
---
Sick of It: Anytime you are afflicted by Blind, Hindered, Mangled, Hemorrhage or Oblivious, you are instead afflicted by Exhausted for 60/40/30 seconds instead. Stacks.
---
Schadenfreude: Anytime you are within 16 meters of a survivor affected by a negative condition, dying, or on the hook, you heal yourself 10%/20%/25% faster, and recover from negative status affects 4/5/6 seconds faster.
---
Haze: skillchecks do not appear for you.
---
Frantic: What you lack in bravery, you make up for in speed. When in the dying state, you crawl 5/10/15% faster.
---
"No. No, no no NO...!" Lost Tapes, Hayden
---
Hex: The Pact: Your uniquely close bond to The Entity has paid off. Whenever a survivor stuns you with a pallet, The Entity will pull down a random pallet in the trial. This perk has a cool down of 90/60/40 (?) Seconds. 
---
And this is an aside, but can we change No One Escapes Death to No One Lives Forever, specifically to flip off David?
---
bullshit that everyones complaining rn just because we destroyed a scummy killer. If you dont like it, keep scrolling. its that ez.
---
Can legion noed someone with frenzy?
---
No, I‚Äôm saying if the person has not been saved and they get close to stage 2 the killer should not be punished for coming back and camping for stage 2 at that point. 
---
It‚Äôs not the killers fault the others didn‚Äôt save the hooked person while the killer was away, blame them
---
Haha, you can search through the vod if you want. I couldn't care less if you believe me or not, or your opinions on Tru3 or myself. The fact of the matter is I don't think he's a good streamer. I think he has spent a month passive aggressively trying to prove his point about Wraith, and the more frustrated he gets about it making him sound like an imbecile, the more he starts to defame other killers. Its dumb, boring, and self-absorbed. Its brainless kitsch. 
---
He used to be better, and have more fun.
---
 /opinions
---
&gt;He wants every infinite to be removed, 
---
This is the one major point I disagree with.  If you want to keep them, you can go to hell.  There should be zero infinite loops in this game.
---
you seem way too invested and mad about this
---
It‚Äôs called an analogy bruv ever heard of it? Don‚Äôt get so worked up lol
---
What are the reasons they should fix that are making you DC?
---
&gt;Frantic
---
We already have tenacity
---
At first glance I was like wtf uses a hand as weapon haha. Cool seeing this though
---
dude its been awful since dedicated servers hit. I'm used to playing as a red rank killer, but of course I dont use mains or serious builds till I get back there. Being at rank 10 and running a farming build against a full squad of rank 2s is... brutal...
---
Shirtless David was the first paid cosmetic I've ever bought in a videogame.
---
I still think he is neat
---
Trapper ON the crapper
---
I was able to kill the obsession 3/4 times in one game with Nemesis and an Ebony.  Couldn't get the last one cause he found the damn hatch.  Was nothing an Ivory the next game couldn't fix.
---
Whispers is the perk for you. It saves so much time patrolling gens at the beginning of the game. You can tell if a survivor is near a gen without getting close enough to see it.
---
Ever heard of why you don‚Äôt blow into game cartridges? Because it blows more dust farther in most of the time then out. Same with compressed air and a shit ton of dust in your old Xbox.
---
 I didn‚Äôt say the way my friend cleaned his Xbox was conventional, it was actually a pretty dumb thing to do considering it‚Äôs the original he could just take the top off and not worry about voiding a warranty anyways; but it‚Äôs like 6 years old and he doesn‚Äôt really give a fuck. 
---
Anyways, I have an Xbox one S with a 2 TB SSD that I got only 9 months ago, you want to explain why that is my Xbox is so loud and gets REALLY only while running this game? Go ahead, because I really don‚Äôt think you can.
---
You even said your ‚ÄúPro would get loud running only dbd‚Äù, and that‚Äôs when you knew your console needed some maintenance? It‚Äôs probably just the game not the expensive ass hardware.
---
Regardless of shitty killers 3 gens in under 2 minutes is rushing gens. You dont even pip or get points for speeding gens
---
i clicked 1 time with the flashlight. why are yall so sensitive wtf.
---
That's why I close the hatch with the last guy, whether that means chasing them and killing them then stepping on it or stomping on it then patrol exit gates (remember me can make this stupid easy)
---
This is why I joined the subreddit, guess you could say it's a quality shitpost
---
These are super useful, I'm an experienced player and remember trying to make something like this in the past but not being able to. If you'd like help making these I'd be happy to
---
agreed. in the last month or so, i've slowed down how much i play because i just get so fucking bored sitting in queues, waiting for matches. a few days i just loaded up to get a daily and then stopped.
---
You better have jingled his bells after the match.
---
&gt; zap range add-ons
---
RIP Railgun Doctor
---
It's just the hags arm lmao
---
No
---
This is why the devs don‚Äôt listen to the community most of the time. People on the sub tend to give ridiculous ideas in favor of killers. On the flip side you got the official forums which have ridiculous ideas in favor of survivors. People are just too biased because they ‚Äòmain‚Äô one role hardcore.
---
I like how the yui looks more confused if anything
---
lol my dumba$$ literally thought it let you crawl faster, so you can crawl including recover faster?
---
Still a competitive game. You compete against others. Maybe it's not esports level, but still competitive.
---
Adrenaline time.
---
I know what you mean, that's why I hate the archives. But I gotta get that king of the hooks outfit
---
Never have I been happier to use the "shitpost" flair
---
I'm a low rank survivor but my friends are red ranks and whenever I play with them I end up saving their asses and 99 the gate but the killer, lately just been oni or leatherface, grabs me and instead of doing anything else after hooking me I get face camped now my account is banned until next month I honestly don't know how anybody can make it through toxic sacks of shit these days.
---
Because accepting a loss fair and square and moving on like a mature person people have to be like THIS
---
r/gamersriseup
---
Nea has like 2 good cosmetics. Everything else is ugly cyberpunk crap that doesn't fit the game.
---
What caused the ban?
---
That's what I say about my pp

Not everyone likes to farm. You can just do the challenges by playing the game normally, they not that hard.

Not sure if this is the real Otz or if it's just a fan account but either way, you are the reason I fell in love with trapper

She is learning how to be an salty survivor. Atm she is clueless and watching and learning. Lmao
---
&gt; IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE
---
CONSIDERING PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT, PROBABLY NOT IMPOSSIBLE
---
GIT GUD
---
That is beautiful.
---
Definitely not *every* survivor main, but yeah, some.
---
Kindred is basically neccessary if you solo queue
---
Thx man &lt;3, don‚Äôt worry, that subreddit is extremely cursed and will probably accept anything it gets
---
Pretty much every survivor main I've ran into. But I'm glad there are some that arent toxic shits :(
---
Doin gens... you?
---
We definitely need them in the merch store. I would *kill* for the Joey sweater

Might as well just bust out the jaws of life, pretty sure his cheeks are fused together

"Viable killers after Wraith/Ghostface? I don't even know." - Tru3 30 seconds ago.
---
I mean, holy shit.
---
Maybe he mad a wish to be able to smoke an infinite cigar.
---
Oohhh I am very ignorant, thanks for informing me
---
Ghostface is a great bargain at $2.99.  The Stranger Things and Halloween chapters also have a lot going for them as a far as the complete package goes.
---
You say that until you just get front row seats of seeing how timid your teammates are and let you reach the struggle phase on your first hook when the killer is nowhere near the hook.
---
Still a really solid perk now though.
---
Wait for a sale and get all of them
---
Can confirm, spent an entire match as spirit just chasing 1 survivor without hitting her for the chase a survivor for *** seconds quest.

I'm not gay but a rescue is a rescue

Yeah, his best bet would've been to take a trap and stand on the hatch
---
Instead of being snide jackass... you could provide a link.
---
are you really watching to just rage?
---
stop being a neckbeard
---
That's not her hatchet, it's her main weapon. Her hatchets are way smaller, at the right of Myers' knife.
---
TBF, Scott is a really good killer.
---
Leatherface gives you the best perk in the game, BBQ and chili, basically gives your double BP every game if you hook everyone at least once.
---
Ghostface is my favorite DLC character to play.
---
Myers is super fun as well.
---
Freddy is one of the best killers in the game and is easy to play.
---
Leatherface is awful to play as but 2/3 of his teachable perks are "MUST HAVE."  One of them doubles your blood points for the round every match if you hook (not even kill) each of the survivors.  The other makes it so when you hit a survivor they drop their held item.  
---
Michael Myers is very fun to play as but his teachable perks are kinda meh.  Same goes for Freddy.  
---
Hag has Ruin which is one of the more important killer perks IMO, but favors a defensive trap based playstyle.
---
Why is the wailing bell in there? It's not a weapon.
---
Went from DC master to meme.
---
What is the skull thing?
---
2nd person to comment this. The hammer next to her weapon is Billy's. Her hatchet is next to Myers's knife but to the right of that is Bubba's hammer
---
that is atrocious. i need it
---
Just get good then
---
When survival toxicity backfires... Take it to end game chat lol
---
Thank you, cheers. Ill check this out after work. Hopefully Scott uploads the game to his page
---
Just watching.
---
My friends say it was because I initiated the guy to talk shit that playstation saw it as me being toxic, I was having a bad day and tried to be as calm as possible so like I just messaged the oni and said must hurt getting gen rushed and having to camp a low rank, and I didn't screenshot what the guy said but it was something like "lol the tears of you saltt survivors always make my dick hard enough to pitch a tent" so pretty stupid and I reported what he said and blocked him, 20 minutes later I get kicked out of the party and off the game and get an email telling me that I violated community policies and my account will be suspended for the next 30 days
---
Isn't bubbas hammer to the right of her hatchet? (The ones between Michael and clown's knives)
---
I think the one next to her main weapon is billys club
---
The "telling the killer how to play the game" thing.. dude that hit me in some kinda way. Survivors are some of the biggest cry babies in the world when they lose, but when they all run meta, gen rush and teabag at every pallet its "GG EZ KILLER LMAO" 
---
But gods forbid I tunnel the toxic little fucker.
---
Now I just have this image in my mind that yui is permanently innocent and confused
---
That's why she is there and not Nea. Lmao
---
Get a small map like Lery's and run Iron Grasp + Agitation.
---
Now do all the store bought weapons
---
Don't lie, you're obviously a devil face main

Day 23: the survivor still don't suspect a thing. I'll keep gathering intel until the next meeting. - Hillbilly

Okay?  I don't know what ranks they were, or what he actually had for perks, or the legion's life story.  
---
"the killer had noed but we destroyed it and escaped,"   
---
I watched the clip and I empathize more with the guy who posted it, I think killers that use ruin are generally poor players.  
---
 Just because the guy clicked his flashlight 3 times doesn't make him hitler.
---
Well first thank you!
---
I could use some help to get in a KYF game to see the different tiles but that would need a lot of afk on your part so this might not be interesting for you (and only on PC until crossplay).
---
The growling is great, wish their was an add-on that made it come from different directions.
---
How it feels to be smacked after jumping through a window with a drop
---
RIP üò±üíÄ
---
I‚Äôve had a lot of survivors who‚Äôve ran meta builds and do gens and are usually very good sports about it and wish me the best in my future matches which is a relief to see, shame as you get further in the ranks it seems to become less common then you get the survivors who bitch and moan to protect their pride instead of fessing up to mistakes and learning from them.
---
He never used his noed so
---
I know :( things have been outrageous lately, especially on PS4. I'm about ready to shut my messages off.
---
That would be pretty cool, but he would essentially be an underpowered Freddy that can‚Äôt teleport.
---
Pretty much.
---
Not gonna lie, I think iron grasp is better than agitation, those wiggle movements can be so mildly irritating
---
The Claudouncil will decide your fate
---
You crawl faster while recovering
---
Actually killed 4 people in the basement,but it didnt count.
---
Yes . I started playing the game again about 2-3 weeks ago. I finished tier 4 yesterday. Lmao its not impossible
---
the skull?? is that a totem?
---
AT LEAST YOU KNOW!
---
*after the 5th try*... 4th try? Eh? U alright?
---
Oof I‚Äôve heard ps4 abuse on dbd is more frequent  than pc, hopefully you get some better matches &lt;3 don‚Äôt like seeing fellow killer players suffer.
---
Why is the exit gate alarm SO üî•
---
Beaten by mordecai and rigby tho
---
I know that but I just wanted him to be a little better and reinforce his ability instead of completely flipping it over. Freddy would probably always be better than clown with or without buffing him anyways.
---
Yeah, I'd be happy to. I'm out of town rn, but we could do it next week whenever you're free? If so just dm me
---
That‚Äôs me &lt;3
---
Cancer. All of it.
---
I asked myself the same question,l. Why was this posted?
---
Imagine both killers getting out done by a ghost with daddy issues.
---
I play on PS4 so I didn't get anything like that but I hooked someone and had one ballsy ass yui come straight for the unhook, wish I could've seen the look on her face when I grabbed her off the unhook
---
but the kanobo has a bigger range because it's a power weapon, not the basic m1
---
but the risk/reward needs to be balanced well. and it isn't. especially for hex perks that tale time to activate or become useful the poor spawn points and number of survivors who spawn on it is way too high
---
Touch bubba's chest, you never gonna rest
---
Damn I shouldve thought of that truly wasted
---
I was chasing an Ash for getting a hook rescue like right behind my back. I wanted to punish him for the quick unhook within terror radius. I thought the hooked victim (Claudette) took off away from me, but as I rounded the corner hot on Ash‚Äôs trail the Claudette ran into me so I instinctively quick hit her (no borrowed time) and rehooked. She complains after the game, I say ‚Äúyou literally ran into me when I was chasing Ash‚Äù. She replies ‚Äúwell you didn‚Äôt have to hit me‚Äù. Well fuck me lol
---
He‚Äôs hoping to slip you a present in your chimney.
---
I liked it when you insinuated that Trump is stupid. I mean, if someone that stupid can make making billions and billions of dollars and become President of the United States of America then sign me up for some stupid! I'm not even a fan of Trump (you don't make billions without being a complete dick) but when people say things like that they're either virtue signalling or completely fucking clueless. You can say he's an ass but you can't say he's stupid. Sorry. Nice 4k though.
---
Don't know if I'm getting wooshed for this or not but whatever
---
Basically the clown takes a finger from every one of his victims as a trophy
---
Or a man with anger management issues
---
As a killer you should want to 3 hook your survivors.  You cost yourself so many scoring events and emblem progress by playing that way.  Those are the killers that will 4K but get Brutal Killer.
---
Yes sir
---
Literally no one said they should! You aren't even responding to my point about spawn balance
---
i would buy susie and joey's sweaters in a hot second
---
Imagine not being able to be the entity
---
This post was made by the nea gang
---
No because that means Ruin or something comparable becomes baseline on killer.  No free perks for either side.
---
Nah I ain‚Äôt wooshing you, but why does he keep the finger as a trophy, is it like a fetish or something in his lore?
---
Follow up question: is there side-by-side‚Äôs of the different speeds on YouTube?
---
survivors should not have a base kit function that rewards bad plays
---
Aren‚Äôt some of them cross play? So then there would need to be stats with and without cross play as I assume PC+Console games have different stats just because of the play style.
---
savor every second
---
Dad
---
Probably a fetish
---
OH MY FUCKING GOD YES!! FUCK THIS FUCKING MAP WITH THE DOCTOR'S SPIKED LOVE-STICK!
---
I always love when people bring this up, not only because it‚Äôs funny, but because there is a chemical that was causing frogs to change their sex.
---
You would think so.  My killer rank isn't as high as my survivor so I have gotten games where people in the post game chat didn't even know what challenges or the archive were.
---
Breathe=Report
---
\#truth
---
I wouldnt mind ruin being baseline either. Stops the gen rush a bit and gives survivors an addition objective every round. And slows the game down a bit. Also would help killers who struggles slowing down the game as well as high tier killers who now have a free slot. It would make the game a bit more interesting in my opinion. Also borrow time literally stops swf from farming tue random off the hook just so they can get away as well as helps the random have a fighting chance or "hope" if you will to be able to escape. And since the entity feeds on hope (argument about merciless killer is always entity feeds on hope if you crush survs too fast you wont yet merci).
---
Not that I can find but there's some videos using both perks in a build to vault super fast
---
200 IQ
---
1 less hook and 1 less survivor in the game. " It's really not hard to avoid getting hooked twice, yet alone once. "  If you are playing against decent killers you will be hooked at least once unless you are a god looper and they suck, and if you are just hiding from the killer you are ensuring that somebody is going to die early, plus a moiri so super early. 
---
No item or perk in the game makes the objective 50% faster, and nobody uses them, a health kit and chase perks are much better than gen perks. Those perks aren't even OP they are just annoying, Adrenalin is an endgame perk that heals one health state which is only useful if you are already in a chase other wise it will waste your exhaustion, DS is avoidable, Borrowed Time (if thats what you mean) is a healthy perk. 
---
Moiri's are unavoidable if you get proxie camped and tunneled by the killer (and they will if everybody else is hiding).
---
Imagine needing to be near Survivors 
---
- Iridescent Huntress Gang
---
I wasnt happy at the time of it but it does make me want to try hag im morw of a trapper and huntress kinda guy
---
Fucking hell this is it, this is peak shitposting
---
It was pretty good! I work on giant comics like this. Good job! I'm following you.
---
Please make more.
---
Deep wound is probably the worst power any killer could have, i would argue worse than old freddy but im not sure, both were useless.
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right but there‚Äôs probably still a way to get away with it
---
I would like to see an Ash one
---
I thought it was already live since idk maybe august ish?
---
There are often many times where he does bits tbf. Not the best but he‚Äôs pretty good for learning how to play certain killers really well. Ghostface and wraith mainly atm. People misjudge him apt unfairly
---
Re-read the post. May have the wrong end of the stick. :)
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting popular and/or meme-ish number combinations, e.g. 420, 69, 666, ... (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
&gt; No but it protects the solo survivor when swf decides to fuck them and farm them off the hook
---
the killer should not be punished for this. full stop.
---
&gt; Also helps when the killer tunnels and etc. Which i guess makes me sound entitled but in reality, its a bit of a problem.
---
no, it's not a problem because tunneling is not a problem. killers have no obligation to only chase fully healthy survivors and survivor base kit should not force it. other survivors have a duty to act in a way to protect other survivors. if they don't, then the whole team gets punished and the likelihood of the survivor not playing along surviving also goes down.
---
You are quite literally saying survivors should just be invulnerable from consequences.
---
And if one survivor is being tunneled down and the team doesn't want to help, then they can get significant gen progress done.
---
So, no, survivors should not get this crutch.
---
Also, say hello to no one playing anything other than Ghostface or silent bell Wraith ever again ever 
---
&gt; More often than not first person caught is usually dead 3 min later.
---
3 minutes is a very significant time in this game. that's close to a third of most games
---
&gt; Its less of reward of bad play and more of giving a fair shake to the poor unfortunate soul who has dick teammates
---
1) you do not get "dick teammates" often enough to necessitate this
---
2) you have a chance via the normal channels of survivor tools - pallets and windows
---
&gt; Not to mention the nerfs to the medkits...
---
medkits were literally buffed. there was no medkit nerf.
---
Ok but to be fair you can see NOED coming AND counter it, same with the basement build. Yeah one guy will die but the other 3 CAN have a free escape if they want. 
---
Abusing an ebony is straight up uncounterable and actually OP, where the other 2 are just annoying. 
---
And as far as hating the player or the game, well in this case I think I'm justified to hate both. Ebony Moris are OP bullshit (green and yellow are ok with me) and anyone who abuses them and uses them in a douchey way (tunnel and mori after the first unhook) is also an asshole. I don't see why I cant blame the player and the game.
---
But hey at least you never are that person if someone else gets hooked and your teammates decide to hold m1 for 120 seconds.
---
It‚Äôs funny cause they go and run shit perks like empathy and poised. You‚Äôre a god damn swf you really need aura perks????
---
This sub never fails to let me down in the memes department.
---
who said they should? you are arguing against a strawman. but the remedy to that is already available!
---
&gt; which is 90% common in all games in the current community.
---
utterly false. i don't know why people go along with this talking point. *you* also know it's false. yesterday was my day off. i decided to set aside most of my usual day off stuff i do to just play the game. i played all day, almost only survivor.
---
During that entire time, the killer was only a camper twice. two times out of an entire day of paying survivor, and one time was because my teammate made a bad play
---
FIX THE GODAMN RANK SYSTEM #PLEASE#
---
YEAH IM RANK 10 ITS NOT THAT GOOD BUT I DONT FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE MAYCHED WITH RANK 20 MEGS WHO CROUCH AROUND THE CORNER OF THE MAP AND DONT DO SHIT WHILE I GET CHASED AND DO EVERY SINGLE GEN
---
woah, good job!
---
Mayhaps use ds if you are getting tunneled.
---
All I see is my new main
---
Oh...it looks like you said you liked the one from the movie, then they "massacred him" and now he looks bad. I apologize from reading top to bottom....
---
&gt;There are people that are going to be better than you. Period. If you get out played you get out played. The fun in losing comes from learning from your mistakes and improving.
---
That is true. If I'm playing survivor and lose a pallet mindgame or step in a trap that I wasn't expecting then yeah, then I did get outplayed and the killer did better and there is no issue here. But if I get 'outplayed' by getting facecamped and dying on 1st hook, that is just bullshit.
---
So scoops ahoy Steve!
---
Ah yes a Boob3 fan
---
Run Bamboozle and Brutal Strength for the memes.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
kind of interesting to see how, even though they're supposed to be the exact same weapon just from significantly different time periods, Spirit's and Oni's katana look entirely different. even disregarding the shattered blade, the handle is completely different.
---
Stabby gang is winning
---
/r/The_Donald is that way my friend
---
Idk maybe difference is infact redranks.
---
That's why you pretty much only have 3 perk slots when playing him. Iron will is not optional on him!

I was not prepared for that turn of events
---
I was just watching somebody mori with the clown as I got this notif, they know
---
I like how it gets even louder as you go to exit the game. It is angry.
---
On another note, it reminds me of those leaked audio files (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0cOyEDm02Q) that never led to anything.
---
but like i said, across ranks this is not something i have ever experienced as a consistent issue
---
have you ever considered that poor experiences stick out more in your memory so you have the perception it's more common than it is?
---
any aura reading is helpful, especially nurses calling, im all ears and bbq
---
who has the skull next to Freddy‚Äôs
---
and clowns‚Äôs weapons ?
---
Legion can't fight loops effectively.  Clown can, as his slowdown will shut down most loops after 1 cycle.
---
He's better than Leatherface, but that isn't saying much.
---
he dropped because he didnt do any chases or get aultrism for either healing or unhooks
---
"Yeees, let them come...they'll never suspect"
---
Perhaps. But ive played idk 10 games so far. Got tunneled/camped in 8 of them. Got farmed by my teammates in 3 of them. And for some reason non of them use borrow time.
---
FUCK YOUR MOTHERS DEVS FUCK YOUR DADS TOO. FUCK YOU I FUCKING DESPISE BHVR FAGGETS I WILL FIND THEM AND FUCK THEM UP
---
Yeah, the amount of priority people place on gens is ridiculous most of the time.
---
It's never 3 survivors trying to pop one gen in a 3-gen when they're on their last hook. 
---
It's when there's 4 gens left, only one of them been hooked and Ruin is still up. That's when everyone's a gen-jockey all of a sudden.
---
do two gens then run the killer till you die is always my game plan
---
Literally gave her a heart attack.
---
So is their actual proof some survivors are louder than others?
---
Had something similar happen to me. I forgot to equip dark sense for the 4 gen challenge.
---
removed uncivil
---
can you do scoops Steve ?
---
You probably were watching some Star Wars music in the background
---
I learned recently to play stupid sometimes, it worked here!
---
Yeah I second that bit about Freddy. It‚Äôs too dark. Maybe just have a kid crying in the school instead? Personally I‚Äôd love to hear faint chanting on the temple map and very faint crying sounds on the red forest map in the alcove with the little bones. With the cows if they spawn randomly they could cause problems with running loops/getting in the way for both killers and survivors. I can see someone spawn inside a cow and getting stuck and while hilarious I‚Äôd be pissed as hell after 10 seconds of being stuck in a half decomposed cow.
---
IIRC it's based off someone at BHVR because they couldn't get permission to use his likeness.
---
The actor who actually played Quentin in the movie tweeted about giving his full permission and I think someone from BHVR took it to DM's to work it all out.
---
Poor guy at BHVR gettin ripped on left and right :D
---
Scott you gotta learn how to hook 2 people on the same hook, there‚Äôs enough room
---
That's gold! Lmao dude yeah. They get cocky and then get their feelings hurt; like fuck you. You wanted me, you got me.
---
Thank you! Itll get better. I think the entire community is tired of the toxicity.
---
Shouldn't have got hooked homie. It's in the game so it's viable. Guessing some of you have never been juggled to death in a fighting game.
---
Sadly that seems to be a good way to pip. I do try to throw in a safe unhook at that seems to give the lost progress on a pip that I can tell. 
---
It‚Äôs quite frustrating. Because it means if you get tunneled off the bat and someone farms your unhooks you‚Äôre going to downrank guaranteed.
---
I can‚Äôt really think of a better way to do the ranks though.

Put some jean shorts on the top left one and you'd have yourself a [Tobias Funke](https://www.google.com/search?q=tobias+funke&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS647US647&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjz26nTg8XmAhViAp0JHXn9D4AQ_AUoAXoECBAQAw&amp;biw=1745&amp;bih=852#imgrc=zwpgnnXamYNCzM:)

Not worth my time. Blocked.
---
I love the vest
---
I thought my boy Q had dreads this whole time. mind blown, and I am so blind. Lol
---
You change the challenge that way the killer can at least make progress toward it even if there are more needed.
---
These 1 trial challenges are not even a challenge they are annoying cancer.
---
Freddy is a fun balanced character
---
Well, this escalated quickly.
---
They‚Äôre from the 80s suitcase DLC or already free if you on console
---
You put freddys claws on the wrong end
---
Eh, you kind of have BHVR to blame for this one. This is kinda the only feasible way to get the challenge done.
---
They based it off the 2010 (?) NoES so that's what you would want to watch.
---
&gt; The launch of the Mid-Patch will most likely be on "January 7, 2020" accompanied by Tome II, its official launch will be around January 27, 2020.
---
Them downvotes came in fast
---
The killer found me like 10 seconds after the match started. So I admit I did rage quit.
---
Imagine having to get close to survivors to down them
---
This comment was made by the billy gang
---
Imagine having to walk around the map, find your power, pick up your power, set up your power, wait for people to *possibly* set off your power and then can just get out of it in their first try. What. The. Fuck!
---
1) i never said it didn't happen. i said it isn't consistent enough to warrant making survivors OP
---
2) he left when a gen popped and came back when he couldn't find anyone. this goes to the heart of my earlier point: maybe your team should stop immersing or do something to take aggro rather than bhvr giving you a crutch
---
Demogoron in my opinion  is either balanced or slightly weak
---
It's just facts. Either can't handle the truth or typical day for TotH users.
---
No, Oni's sword is bigger
---
Yeah kinda late for the party i guess :D never really wanted to ‚Äúwaste‚Äù a perk slot for it but after so many insta ruin cleanses i gave it a try. Interesting how much value you can get out of it.
---
My favorite part of the rift. ‚ÄúCongratulations! Come and claim your bag of nothingness‚Äù

Archives for meg leaked and revealed she's been russian all along.

That's why she's so fast, actually, she's just *russian* to the objective
---
üòÇüòÇ ok than
---
You are right, that's the point of having these large map-defining buildings. They are just _too_strong.
---
Steve please
---
I found it funny, getting surprised by the killer and still getting away like that.
---
Name what?
---
The Killers weapons left to right. Forgive me but I'm not devoted enough  to know all of them
---
He isn't dead, but he went from really good to average
---
u/nicolas
---
My threads are war zones
---
I'd say ghostface. His stealth gives him the upper hand in the cat and mouse game, but he can still be looped.
---
His ability allows him to punish survivors if they are not aware of their surroundings.
---
He feels like he is controlling the pace of the match, without making the survivors feel like there is nothing they can do.
---
RANK 9 KILLER GETTING ENTIRE SWF TEAMS OF RANK 1 PLAYERS 
---
YOUR GAME IS AS BALANCED AS A DRUNK DONKEY!
---
"i'm running around doing loud shit and the killer is chasing me? wtf?"
---
it also might be missing pieces as its shattered
---
Or they could release bunny feng from ages ago.
---
God I once glitched out after getting smacked by a GhostFace and got stuck half inside and half on top of the horse. He downed me and couldn‚Äôt pick me up, I couldn‚Äôt crawl away, my teammates couldn‚Äôt heal me and I bled out.
---
I can name killers that own them
---
Which goes to my point the of solo survivors needing something.
---
Killer found me first gotta dc!!!
---
That's what I meant sorry
---
You are absolutely right. For 4 sacrifices I actually used Iron Grasp and Mad Grit and not agitation.
---
I can, but i am lazy to do it
---
Vigos marauder jake
---
You would probably be very quiet after that
---
Iron grasp, mad grit, and agitation, while major overkill, ensures you will get to the basement
---
I just started playing again after not playing for quite a long time and to me a squadette would make me assume they will be really toxic and just want to bully.
---
No there isn‚Äôt
---
but they do have something! You just want *more* so that survivors will not have to face consequences!
---
Bubba get play with your food and nemesis. He needs additional movement speed to be even remotely viable. 
---
Ghostface is my main. He is best at stalking at the very beginning and when there are only two survivors left. Otherwise just use his ability to have no terror radius and red stain and m1. 
---
Freddy has amazing built in map pressure. I use bbq, ruin, thrilling tremors and pop. Whenever you down a survivor, hook them and teleport to a gen that isn‚Äôt being blocked by tremors and use pop on it. Never use dream pallets at red ranks, survivors don‚Äôt fall for that, and his snares locks down almost every loop. 
---
Don‚Äôt have a lot of Myers experience all I can say is don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket with him, if you‚Äôre killing a survivor make sure you sucked out as much stalk as you can from them first.
---
January 27th is a monday so nothing would happen on the 27th.
---
Does launch of mid patch mean PTB January 7th? That's a Tuesday so its in play and you separated it from official launch.
---
If so i'd guess 21st or 28th unless delayed.
---
Right? If they had gone with actually decent perks like DS/BT/Unbreakable, they wouldn't have been 4 man slugged in the first minute.
---
The Wraith uses it to disapear)
---
Do not even think about lobby dodging them.
---
That remake was pretty weak in my opinion. The actor who played Freddy is a solid actor (Jackey something?) but the film as a whole was pretty bad.
---
The best films in the series are NoES 1, 3 and New Nightmare imo.
---
Wraith bell
---
I always check there
---
Its not wrong you have a reward to claim its just in the premium track.
---
Yeah and it's a really bad one, and for the record I am absolutely fuming at this internet discussion
---
It's why egc is stupid tbh, just gives survivors less incentive to work as a team and help everyone escape
---
Lobby dodge them for sure.
---
Just a meme
---
Yeah, which grants a 25% repair to a generator in a span of a few seconds as long as you hit the 2 skill checks. It just makes it even more laughable that they couldn‚Äôt even finish a gen even with multiple BNP.
---
Doea anybody knows when the rework Will come out?
---
After every game, in the chat, ask if anyone is a Spanish speaker
---
Then, if you enjoyed playing with that person, add them (even the killer!)
---
I‚Äôd also be very happy with that
---
Can‚Äôt be mad at a god nurse on console, gotta give it to them
---
Be glad she only a flashlight and not an AK-47
---
 Seriously. your just being a douche
---
Whenever I play as a killer I always get a group of 3 survivors with friends and 1 survivor by himself =( Never thought about lobby dodging lol but maybe I'll try. Hopefully it'll work but like I said 100% of my killer games lately show 3 survivors in a group and 1 solo.  
---
Is there a way to tell if other survivors are ina group when you're playing as a survvor yourself?
---
I got hooked during EGC and a Dwight came to save me. We both ducked into shack and I didn't realize he was behind me, dropped god pallet and got us both killed. üò≠I felt so bad.
---
Daddy Jeff is definitely the best looking survivor.
---
I remember that there was one once Wake Up was broken and worked on everything (including vault speed)

Thanks man. I'm leveling bubba for BBQ. My first two game were ruthless and the third was brutal.

I'm liking him so far.

Thought it was Evan on the can and was thinking i'd let you have that one but trapper on the crapper makes much more sense!

Tbh when somebody teabags I just automatically peg them as a somebody with low self-esteem.

The Oni is pretty balanced I think
---
24th or 28th :)
---
P3 Nancy
---
Nah it‚Äôs a good analogy sorry bud
---
We need to change that basement sacrifice one. It's bull they even linked lore to it and now people DC as soon as they're near a basement.
---
Not to mention just the RNG of the survivors you get, map design and basement location it just becomes unlikely anyway.
---
Actually they have almost nothing. Let me get you a scenario. Im a rando. You and your buddy is working on archives. Your archive is idk survive a trial with out getting hooked while using spine chill. Your  buddy archive is to do 3 gens with dark sense. I get caught and hooked. And camped a bit. Whats the incentive of one of you coming to get me? You get caught and hooked. Boom your challenge failed. If your teammate who is working on a gen stops gets me gets hooked and boom he is at risk of failing his challenge. And third member dcd. Which is why survivors need a little bit of something. Now i saw the argument of rewarding bad gameplay. Isnt that already happening with killers who can get 2-3 killers even 4 kills via camping tunneling? Cause i can tell you how the game i just played can play out. He caught one and slugged and got the other guy before hatch spawned and boom a 4k. (Tech a 3k cause one guy dc).
---
Cries in Bubba...
---
Laughs in billy...
---
When the baby survivor doesn‚Äôt realise why everyone sprinted away from the gen even though there is no terror radius
---
In the lore it's said that the sword was passed down through the generations. Would make sense if it was the same tbh.
---
https://youtu.be/sozivI2VbHoi found this, but we don‚Äôt know survivor perks, so I‚Äôd assume the first survivor had nothing, and the second had everything (res, spine, broken wake up) for a total of 30% increase so it might not be that helpful
---
Hook/gen reskins &gt; bp
---
*gets classic* uhh lets spin again
---
The big brain survivor using a BNP with a sabo toolbox
---
It's shit bud
---
Get a 4 man swf together and have them 99 gens and you can go pop all of them.
---
yeah i know, thats pretty dumb... especially bc bnps are very powerful if youre not using 4 on one gen :')
---
You know, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs not possible, but if you really did just start a few weeks ago it actually might be, since doing stuff in low ranks would be exponentially easier
---
literally none of this rambling hypothetical showed how you have nothing. At all.
---
sorry but you're just peak entitled survivor and nothing more. you're literally whining that sometimes you have bad games and the devs need to intervene to prevent bad games
---
this is like killers whining about SWF
---
That wouldn't explain the hilt. It's just a scaled down version i guess. The one's spirit's using that is.
---
I love that idea! Sadly I mostly play on ps4. Thank you though!
---
They do? They look the same to me. One is just squished.

Yeah not ONE unbreakable which is insane

Play ace then play Jeff.
---
Yes I did it too and I won't receive my christmas gift. But the point is that the game bugged and I saw the killer gameplay for the rest of the match.
---
&gt; Nothing entitled about that
---
saying you think solo sucks? it doesn't at all in my experience, but no that isn't entitled. demanding major, extremely strong base kit changes to survivors to prevent consequences and even the possibility of bad games is
---
&gt; It does suck.
---
nah
---
Killer latency advantage, Moris, certain killer add-ons, hardcamping, ...Spirit - more big issues that ruin games...
---
I think toolboxes shouldn't apply to generators at all. Instead, they should speed up hook-sabotaging much more, to make sabo a viable tactic again. That would both take away the increased gen repair speed itself, as well as encourage survivors to spend time saboing hooks instead. Toolbox add-ons that affect gen repairs could then do things such as reveal hook auras within certain ranges, and their sabo progression, potentially having to manually channel the aura read at a cost of charges. (Bear traps should not be saboable.) In general, I would remove the spotlights from gens, and randomize their spawn locations more, to have survivors spend more time locating them. Stalling perks such as Ruin and Weasel could then be rebalanced, encouraging killers to take other perks.
---
For the map design, the only real issues are quasi-infinite windows for killers, and deadzones for survivors. Problematic windows should be reworked (and then so should Bamboozle), either removing them and replacing them with pallets or new elements such as doors, crawlspaces or collapsing windows, or adding more counterplay opportunities to them, like alternate paths and drop-downs. Deadzones can be gotten rid of by using the same spawn algorithm for pallets that they use for hooks, where there's guaranteed to be a hook within a certain distance from most of any location on the map, but also a guaranteed distance between any 2 hooks (apart from map-specific spawns). The amount of pallets should also follow the hook rule of being in a strict relation to the amount of tiles that make up a given map.
---
Exhaustion perks don't need more nerfs. They are once-per-chase at best, and some of the few things are actually fun to use. I do think perks like Mindbreaker and Blood Echo should be better, to make taking an Exhaustion perk less of a no-brainer. If for example Blood Echo applied to survivors regardless of their health status, or at least to all survivors that had been injured at one point in the match, it could throw a serious spanner into the Exhaustion meta.
---
Myers without a doubt
---
Actually i made the argument that killers should have ruin basekit as well..
---
First of all, it's a pain in the ass to provide a link on a phone. Additionaly, it would have been fairly easy to find the video, since we all knew who we were talking about and the only other thing they needed to do was to read the title. I guess the desire to watch the video wasn't great enough to read the whole post.
---
shorturl.at/JKMZ9
---
And his mori would be popping his head and arms out of the generator before flinging the survivor into the fan blades.
---
*Repair this, bitch!*
---
that's also entitled and would be awful for low rank balancing
---
something tells me that you're not being entirely forthright with us here. 
---
It's experience that tells me that.
---
You mean besides matchmaking already is?
---
But we haven't had *just* cosmetics this year, have we?
---
I spent several hours downranking to rank 16 and played Meyers with iron grasp, agitation, ruin and insidious. I got INCREDIBLY lucky and one by one they dropped into the springfield basement in the school and I dropped right behind them. The last guy tried to DC but it still counted I guess because he was hooked. I thought I'd have to play more than once so I was mad and told the guy who dc'd his dad should have came into an open flame but then I got it and sent him a picture of the challenge being done. Not my proudest moment in life but I'm done with tome shit now.
---
I still don't have Mad Grit. I haven't put BP in Legion and havent seen it in the Shrine while I have been playing, otherwise Mad Grit would be a great choice, and counter against Breakout
---
if you can't even manage to stay on topic at this point, then just stop
---
It was very dumb of them to rush a single gen. They should‚Äôve just spawned regularly and applied pressure to 4 different gens.
---
I was getting so tired of the survivor "omg tunneling" memes. It's nice to see some killer sided shit ü§£
---
**[S N I F F]**
---
Dwights get no sympathy from me. Literally any other character, youre fine. But ive played with too many locker dwights as a survivor to respect them

Everyone covered it already but you only need to hold it for like a quarter of a second to break a pallet. Then you can demon dash at dem hoz

They're changing the doctor?? Fuck. He's my favorite killer. Leave him alone!

More like "cocky little fucker is about to die."

yeah i love playing *Jesus Christ*
---
Most probably in the next midchapter patch, which should be in january 2020
---
so that‚Äôs what happened to the mcdonald‚Äôs clown
---
But there‚Äôs literally a ton of other perks worth bringing too
---
next mid chapter patch?
---
I basically posted the same meme like 6 months ago wtf
---
1. Thats too much for a challenge.
---
2. I already did it, i had to ask the killer to farm with me
---
Something tells me nobody asked you
---
Bamboozle is op on nurse
---
Yeah. I did that challenge because I basically forced the situation to happen and even then it was luck. Ran Prove Theyself with Better Together with the Shroud of Binding.
---
Almost didn't work because I had a potato teammate, like 5 ranks lower than me, missing skill checks. With no Ruin. But luckily it was against a Bubba who wasn't too good.
---
And even then I almost missed getting to a gen before it popped. Fuck that challenge.
---
1. It's not that hard to grab some people to do a challenge. 
---
2. Just keep that group together and keep doing challenges, it's insanely easier to get things done when your team helps you, and you help them.
---
That would mean killer queues are quick if everyone is playing survivor. Must be lots of killers at low ranks and not enough survivors. My killer queues at red ranks are pretty much instant
---
Well when I‚Äôm chillin in a locker in basement after getting unhooked and he comes to search every locker. Super loud
---
For Myers some general tips are to just make your way to a gen and get out of T1 as soon as possible. Don‚Äôt be afraid to stalk instead of just hitting in T2, but try to have T3 ready to get an easy down or two every so often. Basically just use your power.
---
Never said it was hard,just too much for 1 challenge
---
I KNOW IT'S STUPID BUT HOW THE FUCK I AM SUPPOSE TO PALLET STUN A KILLER 4 TIMES , THEY RESPECT PALLES HARDCORE AND JUST DON'T WANT TO TAKE THEM IN THE FACE , COWARDS !
---
"So I messaged the killer to tell him I hope he has a blessed day and he replied saying he was dispatching a horde of 30-50 feral hogs to obliterate my family and PS banned me and sent him 100$!"
---
Why I said keep them together, it's not for 1 challenge it's for as many as you have time for.
---
Im literally answering everything you are saying...but thats not on topic? Okay buddy. On topic. Survivors basekit should change for the simple fact solo survivor experience can be/more often than not terrible. With points i provided above in a scenario. And the video i posted of leatherface camping (which also promotes bad gameplay). Also to compensate i say killers should have basekit ruin. Which gives survivors another side objective. Also killers should have baseline bbq. Every killer runs it. Your arguments so far has been well almost non existant. Then you gave the whole "YoU'rE eNtItLeD" speech. Which really miss the whole point of the "change my mind". Now killer vs swf as you so mentioned. I cant speak on. People wanna play with their friends. It happens. So are you gonna make a good counter argument? Or are we gonna just act immature and go with the whole meme trolling route cause I want to have a serious discussions about it.
---
I run Corrupt Intervention over Ruin on Trapper and Myers and it's worked just fine because it buys me the time I need to set up my traps or get my stalk on. I do agree though for a lot of other killers it's hard to not run it and not get blown out on gens and finding a suitable replacement is difficult.
---
Oh boy another sarcastic little fuck that thinks they know everything.
---
Savage
---
Ye. A spirit with lowest addons, for dailies. Spirit is OP
---
I mean really hillbilly's is still better, cuz his chainsaw is actually easier to hit than lf. imo at least
---
He just plays the game and sometimes he gets matched with bad players because the matchmaking system is fucked and you call him toxic.
---
He even points out assholes like you are going to call him toxic for "bullying baby killers" and feels bad for them because the matchmaking system is horrible
---
Because female make Reddit mad
---
Ask for a refund.

Get as many people injured as possible and wait until close to activate frenzy. With legion you need to be as oppressive as possible.

In the same map another will spawn in a corner close to that one
---
This honestly needs a rework, I don‚Äôt think a buff will fix this to be anything more than a meme Perk
---
My Freddy build is BBQ, Ruin, Pop, and Thana. Leatherface is BBQ, Ruin, Monitor, and Thana. Ghostface I have BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's, and Sloppy. And for Myers I've got BBQ, Monitor, Infectious Fright, and Corrupt Intervention.

gonna downvote you anyway to be fair

Happy Holidays to you as well!!!!!!!!
---
After finally completing them I'll be honest out of all the tomes the flashlight save was the hardest, followed closely by the dark sense one. I prepped by downranking for the basement shit so it wasnt so bad
---
wow you really had to go on an investigative journey lmao my dude are you okay?
---
Extra BP for you, now just do the rest of the gens.
---
Thanks for the advice kind stranger!
---
Dang it I was too late to comment this
---
With Bubba it's all about the saw and knowing when to saw and when to hammer. He's not great on a consistent basis, but I think he's a lot of fun.
---
and then that actor that played tarzan can the survivor. am i thinking about the right movie/guy?
---
thankfully, no.
---
Me too, although the other day I was accused of stream sniping because I caught a dark clothed Claudette in the tall grass on Sanctum lol. Tried telling them I saw them from the white Dream state aura from Freddy but they wouldn't listen
---
this is my favorite meltdown in awhile and you're literally showing everyone what you actually said which is the best part
---
Which seems strange because theres consistently highly voted comments about people making fun of tru3
---
I would buy like 5 of fengs sweater
---
I think the gen issue would be solved if people would stop saying "80 SeConDs" because they arent 80 seconds. Its only 80 seconds if the survivor gets 0 skill checks, works alone and uses no items or perks that increase gen speed
---
Gens in a practical setting are closer to 65-70 seconds at most
---
My two favourite games atm in one game, very nice.
---
I'm sure it's not the first time a bad ban was given; however, we have quite a bit of contrary evidence, thanks to you.
---
In my line of work, we call these "clues"
---
* How defensive you got when questioned
---
* How you conveniently slant your statement versus his
---
* Trying to dismiss the person questioning you
---
* Conveniently mentioning how you didn't have the screenshots, anticipating being questioned about them
---
While they're certainly not guaranteed indicators, they certainly can help paint the broader picture: you weren't honest when speaking of your ban, and I'd almost guess that you weren't honest when speaking of the circumstances leading up to it.
---
Like I said, doesn't take a high level of detective work to spot that you're lying.
---
In that lighting they all look like props from Half Life 2, imagine Gordon Freeman picking up Bubba's chainsaw and yeeting it towards the killers.
---
I don't really care about showing anyone. I don't like letting ugly remarks pass; it leaves their target feeling like everyone agrees.

kindred should be base kit, BT would be broken if it was

Compared to what they were these are a lot better. One of the leaked one's was "get two flashlight saves in one trial" haha ok BHVR sure we can do that

Whatever retard made these basement challenges that involve doing it in 1 trial needs slapped in the face and never to be allowed to design a challenge again.
---
I can't play Jeff when I've got headphones on, it's too much. Just shut up, it's fine. We've been over this, you'll be back at the campfire 5 minutes after the match has finished. Relax buddy
---
That‚Äôs adorable.
---
I loved this quest, was so fun to do. Never thought of it being DBD related
---
&gt;Just because you assert this and have one video of one bad game doesn't make this true lmfao baby surv
---
I have multiple videos.
---
&gt;not my fault you ignored everything to screech about how you want to never face any consequences ever
---
Never once said not to face any conquences. Nor did i imply it. I simply said borrow time should be baseline because it helps solo survivors who gets farmed off hooks because of toxic swf just so they can get away.
---
&gt;no this is the same baby entitlement you apparently have for everything. sad. and again, this would be *so bad * for low ranks. fucking awful. but you want everything catered to you.
---
I played red rank as killer. The only bad thing this would be for low ranks is for them to get used to finding ruin. Which bhvr could add a tutorial about it. 
---
&gt;yeah because it's good and quite strong, and that strength is why it shouldn't be baseline just like BT. you're literally just tossing out utter bullshit now in a desperate attempt to cover up your brain rotted BT idea
---
I should of been clear and mentioned more or less the increase bloodpoint part of it. Not the actual tracking. That one is on me. I also feel "we're gonna live forever" should be base line
---
 too. But thats off topic and a bloodpoint thing.
---
But yes attack the person not the argument!
---
This is too cute üåª
---
Let me just say I wouldn't consider myself a nurse main, but I do have a few hundred hours on her. Probably about 100 post-rework. If I critique anything here it's not meant to put you down or insult you, but help you get better with her. Just a warning: this is going to be a long reply.
---
Based on your perks and the way Claudette played against you, I'm guessing you're newer at the game and not in red or purple ranks. I also see that you're on console which is going to make Nurse much harder.
---
I'll start off with the perks and add-ons that I run, why I run them, and some alternatives and why you might want to run them. I personally run Whispers, Shadowborn, I'm all ears, and BBQ &amp; Chili. Why do I run these? Nurse's biggest challenge is finding people. When "walking" she's slow and when blinking her vision isn't the greatest and has the fatigue which slows you down and limits your vision further. 
---
Whispers helps out with finding that first survivor early game. You don't have to look around trees and rocks wondering if there is someone hiding. You'll know immediately if someone is within 32 meters of you. Getting that first down is important as any killer, but even more so as Nurse since you are so slow when you don't have a set destination/objective in mind.
---
The second perk, shadowborn, helps with Nurse's whole vision problem. You get that extra FoV, which is nice because obviously you can see more of your surroundings. The main reason though is her fatigue. As I'm sure you've noticed, it can be a pain in the ass to track someone after you blink and go through fatigue. Nurse looks at the ground and the edges of the screen go black. The extra FoV can help keep them in view and enable you to follow up much quicker.
---
In my opinion, I'm All Ears can be one of the Nurse's strongest perks. Her biggest hindrance is a survivor breaking line of sight because of her movement speed. You either have to walk to where they broke LoS to see where they went after, or try to predict where they went and potentially guessing wrong. I'm all ears removes that after a vault. You'll know exactly where they are for 6 seconds and can use her ability to ignore every standard game mechanic by going through walls to their exact position. 
---
BBQ and Chili I honestly just use for BP, but it gives me handy info on where to go for my next chase. I rarely go back hook, so seeing a survivor on a gen that I can interrupt is useful. The only time I will pressure hook is if I see someone nearby when I hook someone or no one is on BBQ and Chili. In the first case going after the nearby person creates more map pressure by forcing someone further away to stop what they're doing and go for the save, or risk the hooked person taking another state or dying. It also risks having two people hooked close together, which is obviously really bad for them. At that point, there is no reason to patrol gens because they either unhook or lose.
---
For add-ons I will keep it simple. Two recharge addons are going to be best for starting out. You are going to miss blinks, it's better to get them back quicker than the blinks going further. Fragile Wheeze and Dark Cincture are your best friends. Plaid Flannel to see where your blinks are going is good too for starting out and understanding where your blinks are going to go. Nothing more frustrating than blinking 2 feet into a wall because you didn't charge it quite enough. That or blinking into the basement because you forgot it was there and pointed your blink down to shorten the distance. Don't even bother with other addons until you get a feel for base nurse blinks.
---
I'll give some alternative perk builds if you are struggling to keep up pressure and gens are going to quick. Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling, BBQ &amp; Chili. This allows you some wiggle room in finding and downing the first survivor, it will slow down the game but be aware you will struggle a bit more in chase as a tradeoff. I think Nurse is a bit like Billy in that ruin isn't really needed on her (Not to the extent of Billy. Ruin Billy players are gross.) but it definitely helps new nurse players get a grasp on her without losing 3 gens before the first down. 
---
Surge, Surveillance, BBQ, and I'm All Ears is another build I like. Nurse doesn't have time to kick gens, so the surge/surveillance combo is great information. Be warned though, on bigger maps like Ormond or Rotten fields the combo is going to be extremely weak since all the gens are so spread apart. It's extra bad on rotten fields because of the corn and limited vaults hurting your already limited vision and removing the usefulness of I'm All Ears. They really need to buff the distance surge works at in my opinion. I'm usually not one for saying "buff regression perks" because when you stack them it can get a little ridiculous. I think the sign of a bad killer that refuses to learn how to chase is stacking 3 or 4 slowdowns/regression perks. That said, surge is useless on quite a few maps and needs a bit of a tweak to make it a good perk.
---
It would help knowing what teachable perks you have unlocked, because I don't want to recommend things you have no way of getting. Assuming you have no teachable perks and are just starting out, I'd use Sloppy, Nurse's Calling, Whispers, and Thana.
---
Now to your gameplay if you're still with me here. I noticed you chased after the Claudette on foot and took a swing at her while running. Don't do that. The chase could have been ended 15 seconds earlier if you used a blink immediately when you saw her. All she had around were a few rocks and LT walls. You get that first hit and she had nowhere to hide. Unless you're 100% certain you're going to get the hit, use a quick blink to close the distance. If they run even somewhat straight you will never catch up, and good survivors know that. So until they hear the blink charge they aren't going to do anything crazy to let you catch them. 
---
Next, I see you trying to predict where she's going when she breaks LoS and blink to that position. This is rarely the best play to make. It happened to work out because she wasn't very good and didn't look back, but good survivors will punish you for it by changing their direction as soon as LoS is broken. You'll blink to your predicted spot and see them running in the opposite direction towards a jungle gym where they will extend chase for another minute.
---
Your best option is to either walk to where they broke LoS if it's close, or blink to the spot they broke it, and use a follow-up blink after you regained sight. The few seconds lost here are nothing compared to the potential loss of a bad prediction. The only time a prediction is useful is if you're trying to cut them off from a stronger area. See them running towards the docks on grim pantry but they broke line of sight behind killer's shack? Sure, blink to the predicted spot behind shack to make sure they can't go to the docks and are forced into a weaker area of the map with better sightlines.
---
Another issue is you using your blink before your second one has recharged. You don't keep the progress towards the second blink if you start charging or use the first one. Let the second blink charge up before using your first unless you are positive you will get the down on that blink.
---
Nurse is by far the most mechanically challenging killer on DbD, and probably the hardest to do well with at higher ranks. This rings even more true on console where you're limited by the controller. That said, despite what you might have heard people say on this subreddit, she is still without a doubt the best killer when put in capable hands. Rivaled only by spirit in terms of strength, but actually difficult to play. 
---
Keep practicing with her and don't get discouraged when you get demolished by good survivors. It will happen often early on, especially with the ridiculous matchmaking, but those are the survivors that will make you a better player. Don't get upset when one is dodging every single one of your blinks, pay attention to their movement and the reason your blinks are missing. Learn from it. Hell, when I started out I'd ask the survivors that made me look like an idiot to add me on steam so I could make a KYF lobby and practice with them. Most were happy to do so and were surprised I wasn't just angry at them for making me look silly.
---
I just looked back and realized how long this post was. Hopefully it helps if you don't fall asleep halfway through!
---
TL;DR: Just don't miss blinks 4head
---
Watched the vod. Salty for not hooking cause no hooks and holding the game hostage. The bleed out mechanic is there pretty much to prevent holding a game hostage lmao. The trump-level intelligence comment made me lol
---
Lol a fucking arm
---
Actually i could get behind that idea of kindred over bt.
---
She's not real man.
---
That would be awesome. We have a lot of environments (forest, urban, snow, interior) in game already, but no desert themed map. Imagine a map that takes place in a sweltering desert stuck in the middle of a raging sandstorm ... you can take refuge from the sandstorm inside the cursed egyptian tombs and tunnels nearby. Lockers=sarcophagi. 
---
I'd also like to see a jungle map introduced. Imagine that horribly uncomfortable environment: sweat, mosquitoes, heat, while being chased by a predator. Maybe even ***The Predator*** as a new licensed killer?
---
She's my most hated killer to play against along with doctor xD
---
It‚Äôs not even lit though, no smoke comes off of it and it doesn‚Äôt even look lit I think. He just literally has a cigarette in his mouth that he does nothing with.
---
Just swamp things
---
This map used to be about twice the size it is now. They never changed the spawn locations so it usually spawns there
---
"DUUUUUUUD"
---
The character arcs here are amazing
---
Seems about right
---
With the dark sense challenge, I threw on Bonds as well and just ran around finding people doing gens and leeched. You don't have to do the whole gen, just be on it when it pops.
---
For a good second I thought the pic said mah spaghetti, which was even more confusing given that it's a McDonalds.
---
The dude has spouted: antivax bullshit, claimed climate change is a Chinese hoax, repeatedly made factually wrong comments about American history.

In a very real very regular sense, the guy is fucking stupid.

I KEEP GETTING TTING FUCKING TUNNELED DUE TO BEING A NEON NEA DISPITE IM NOT TOXIC AND KEEP GETTING FUCKING DEPIPPED INTO A NEW COLOUR. WHAT THE SHIT.

Yeah I think the same thing when I see someone run NOED

Hahahahaha. ‚ÄúMindgame‚Äù hahahahaha!

I never saw someone talking about the way that steve screams

---
Yeah I bet he made threats, they usually do. last week a guy told me I had 72 hours before he beats me til I'm brain dead. maybe he's stuck in traffic?
---
Killer is strong. It does not need buffs. If I'm playing matches in the way survivors want me to play, I can get 3ks and 4ks easily. Survivor is the one that is harder because you never know what the killer or (if solo or duo) what your random teammates will do. There's only two or three killers I'd say that are not strong and they are Wraith, Clown and kind of Ghostface. Survivors need buffs right now, not killers.
---
It's not bug. It's new killers buff
---
Yeah. Like I think face camping is toxic (I prefer playing killer btw) but it's not always that way. Maybe it's just a newer player that doesn't know any better. Or could also be that way because the survivor is being annoying.
---
Was that console or pc?
---
doctors suit makes my toes moist
---
RUSH THEM ALL!
---
Console
---
^ this. Your goal is to pressure the entire map and slow down their generator progress, then down them before they have time to heal. If they heal, go zoom zoom stab stab
---
How did you get to tier 70? I'm still all the way at tier 48 :/
---
Post your face on reddit coward.
---
I think a good place to start is by putting caps on repair speeds. If you put 3 survivors on 1 gen with prove thyself and 1 toolbox, the damn thing pops in 30 seconds.
---
Gens shouldn't go faster than 60 seconds, but shouldn't take longer than 100 seconds. That's just my opinion and first thought, and I know those numbers could easily be tweaked to be more fair.
---
Haha you peasant.
---
No it‚Äôs not swamp...
---
No. I wish, though. The devs should make a playground/wild mode specifically for SWF. I mean, if they're a 3 man team, they usually just leave the rando (me) to die anyway. I say, let them play 3 v 1 then. We *should* have a dedicated solo queue.
---
Can confirm as a ps4 player that the people on this console are not joke when it comes to insulting you for now reason. I personally have near 100 if not more messages from people just having a go at me with no rhyme or reason.
---
I've put over 4.9K hours over 3 accounts... DC Punishments were a good change, and you get pissed because a developer laughs at a comment on their off-time.
---
Imagine a werewolf killer that goes in and out of beast form on a timer and in beast form you can one hit survivors and you move faster but with human form you‚Äôre a slower base killer
---
I feel you. Dunno how I got beyond rank 18
---
‚Äú A really big fucking hole coming right up!‚Äù
---
Forgot about it. Oops.
---
I‚Äôll be honest, these are among the most unique perks I‚Äôve seen on this forum. 
---
First perk wouldn‚Äôt be very useful but it is an idea I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever thought about. 
---
Second perk would be useful for survivors to figure out what the killer is running over time in a quite fair way, which again is great.
---
Third perk sounds like a great anti-tunnel perk. This would actually give you a chance to help your mates that are getting focused harder by the killer. I think the downside of the perk should be stronger because of what it gives to you but that can be tweaked. The idea is great!
---
Well done sir. I would love try out all of them.
---
Well they‚Äôre both toxic sooo, but you‚Äôre right they‚Äôre the same thing expect tea bagging doesn‚Äôt affect the killer in any way but NOED can allow a killer to get a 4K when the survivors did good all game and he didn‚Äôt, so yes you are they‚Äôre not the same but one is a lot less toxic than the other.
---
It's funny, I never get hit with DS while "tunneling", it's usually only when I'm doing really well, then I eat like 3 of them. I guess I just need to slug more often.
---
She was a Hungarian countess and serial killer - she's in the Guinness World Records as "the most prolific female murderer."
---
I saw a Deadly Women episode on her. Supposedly, (this is where the vampire stuff came about) she bathed in the blood of her young virginal victims to stay young. 
---
I imagine her something like a bloody version of the Plague. Maybe too similar. I would love a Nosferatu type killer, to be honest. Creepy looking.
---
Yulka
---
&gt; Also hard to say who's the "best" as their playstyle is so different, Otz maining Trapper, Scott maining Huntress and I honestly don't even know what Zubatlel mains lol.
---
This is one of the reasons I like truetalent. He doesn't really main anything and plays them all quite a bit.
---
Punish the t-baggers
---
Not using VPN and play your region?
---
that‚Äôs a good one

Wait for a buff, then try again
---
I didn't need to know that existed

Billy and the huntress are pretty balanced
---
anyone else love it when you‚Äôre about to get the last basement sac and while you‚Äôre carrying the last guy he DCs while you‚Äôre walking down the basement stairs? pretty fun experience i must say

I am sorry for your loss.
---
Psychotron is the first thing that came to mind reading this.
---
Make a Wish kids after the Facebook post gets enough likes, circa 2019
---
Do you play with headphones? I used to play the game through my TVs speakers and it was hard to hear but with headphones it's like the survivors arent even trying to be quiet.
---
Thank you, it means alot. It was hard making perks that I would have if I was a survivor. You think Selfless should have greater negative effects? I wanted the perk to be viable and funny, but still able to make plays, just not plays like swapping heath states with someone only to get healed instantly, nor can you use styptics or syringes, hence the broken status. I figured it would be a meme perk, like no mither though. I made sure not to reveal your aura to the killer since it‚Äôs too close to Babysitter. What other downside would you think work that still makes it fun for both sides?
---
It's not the same thing, actually. Teabagging is being intentionally toxic. Is Noed a crutch perk? Absoloutly. Does that mean whoever's using it is toxic? Not really, no.
---
Also, judging from your post history, you're entirely survivor sided, go figure (literally mocking a dude who got a 4k just because he brought along a ebony mori, lol, some douche you are). And before you go WeLl YoU'rE sUrViOr SiDeD, I'm not, actually. I play both sides pretty equally. Using a perk, even insidious, doesn't mean you're trying to be an ass. Means you're not very good, but unless you're literally striking hooked survivors, it doesn't mean you're toxic. And if you think that way, idk what to tell you other than I feel bad for you.
---
Unfortunately I play with a really good pair of headphones. Perhaps I just need different settings or a quieter room. But it‚Äôs good to hear that you aren‚Äôt having an issue. It could just be my setup then.
---
Im not even that good to be talking about hearing survivors yet though. That is the least of my problems lol.
---
Thought they meant oni?
---

---
this post was made by the myers gang
---
Your proposal to nerf ruin by making gens not blow up makes no sense really? If you blow up the gen that‚Äôs skill based you could have at least hit the grey skill check which would regress if you don‚Äôt want to blow up
---
Dont worry about being good. I'm not either. I hover around 10 for both sides and I like it. No added pressure and people will actually do some fun things with their builds still. Best of luck in the fog! Hope you can get things working for you :)
---
Huh, I didn't know that. I just started playing this year and thought that gen placement was just the weirdest thing. Thanks.
---
Imagine having to stalk multiple survivors to get a 1 shot.
---
This post made by ghostface gang

pig gang would like to ask how you do it so quickly

The plague getting Corruption was on beat too I love it

I assumed he meant oni because people meme him as being better Hillbilly.

Little waist wit a big beeeeehind

Umm... ha?

Yea I know, my point is that even when taking that into account he's still loud af
---
I managed to get a 4k as post-nerf Oni in Lery's and I'm not even good at the game but I felt like an absolute god.
---
A few days ago two survivors on my team were following around a Myers that wasn't hitting anyone and letting him stalk them, while the poor Steve was trying to loop him. I obviously realized that he just has infinite EW3, and we were going to die.
---
I did gens while they screwed around and then I got to a gate. Started opening it while the Steve was crouching around, and the other two were propably at the other one. I saw Myers in the distance closing in on me, and then I heard the tune.
---
I got the gate open just as he grabbed me. At least I got Steve out.
---
Jane makes me feel weird dude
---
Listen for a heartbeat as soon as you hit somebody with frenzy.
---
If you hear one ditch the chase and apply pressure on the person making the noise. Continue until their are no more heartbeats and commit to the last person you hit.
---
If a survivor is at a very good loop location I would suggest deep wounding them and going elsewhere to apply pressure.
---
Legion works really well in smaller areas so I definietly suggest trying to keep 3 or 4 heavy gens safe. 
---
Discordance is absolutely phenomenal for him and other killers, use it.
---
I suggest using either the broken or mangled button with a ruler or note add on.
---
vouch.
---
i had 3 people dying on hooks in basement and the last guy DCed as i was carrying him down the basement stairs. that‚Äôs the closest i‚Äôve ever been. i fought for those hooks too :/
---
I'm not saying it was good, just that the devs based the DbD chapter on the remake (which is pretty obvious because Quentin. But some don't know he is from the remake)
---
Well, MoM is just broken so I wouldn‚Äôt rely too much on that unfortunately... the rest would make a funny build, that‚Äôs for sure!
---
Yui and Fengs would be mine instantly.
---
Yeah the rift is a huge grind, and the XP needed should definitely be decreased. I believe I‚Äôve done 100 hours of matches and all but 3 of the challenges done and I‚Äôve only reached like tier 56. I shouldn‚Äôt have to grind for *that* long, that‚Äôs just silly. 
---
Here‚Äôs an idea. Up the fragments gained by doing challenges a bit. Even upping that shit by a single fragment per challenge could give a more balanced grind.
---
And then we're gonna get shocked when people only play top tier killers and flood forums with calls for spirit to be gutted.
---
yeah and i actually enjoy the lore too :T
---
Practice what you preach.
---
Remember Campers Your The ‚ÄúTrash‚Äù Can 
---
(Also referring to the ones who camp from the start of a match for no reason)
---
Counter whispers... What??
---
I see. I figured since the perk can only be used when healthy, and it gives you broken for a minimum of 20 seconds, the time to heal and the Broken timer would act as a natural cooldown. I also took into account that you could potentially swap states and be put in the dying state, so I didn‚Äôt want to make the broken timer too long just incase you get slugged and you and your team are forced to let you bleed for a full minute, not to mention being in the dying state would require more healing, wasting even more time for the survivors on top of the long Broken Effect timer. I guess I‚Äôd end up using my own perk wrong, since being put into the dying state is not optimal xD
---
But knowing my path of logic, would you still recommend I increase the timer to something like **60/50/40**? Or leave it?
---
Dammit!
---
You caught me red handed
---
I've been able to get it pretty consistently since the new protection hit update.
---
Wow this is incredible, you should be proud!
---
USE THANAPHOBIA
---
That is going to be fucking awesome with bitter murmors
---
Love is love
---
I also watch the sidemen
---
It sucks as a killer when one surv is hiding somewhere tho
---
It does
---
Gonna need Dwelf
---
There's nothing that 'counters' whispers. It tells the killer there's someone in this area. If you're hiding well, killer will either spend a lot of time trying to find you or just go to the next area. It's similar to Spine Chill, there really is no counter play to it [unless you're scratched-mirror Myers]
---
Rip
---
It's only an admittment that you've been an easy distracted killer. Try tunneling at least. Cheap too, yes. Or walk away 2, 3 steps.
---
I'd run Selfless in my kit for sure! Great job!!!
---
What I did was do two strats at once. 
---
I used Trapper with BBQ, Ruin, Agitation, and Iron Grasp or whatever the fuck the second word is. And then I booby trapped the fuck out of the area near the basement. For me it was the church in Crotus Prenn. 
---
Then, I made sure to do heavy patrolling on the three nearest gens. That way, if I wasn‚Äôt doing too well by the endgame, I‚Äôd have a way to turn the tide. 
---
This strategy worked very well, and I did it again by accident with the Agitation challenge on The Game. A trap on the bathroom entrance, a trap under the hallway pallet next to the bathroom, and a trap in the doorway in front of the other pallet. And then a trap on the stairs when I was done hooking someone. 
---
Worked really well. I‚Äôd give that a try.
---
Im not  lying lmao. I can show you. Its not that hard as people make them out to be. I mean i play more then the average player so that also helps me
---
Thank you, I put a lot of thought into these. &lt;3
---
Chonky jesus
---
I got really mad last night cause I'm going for play and I needed blood on your face and the last guy dced while he was on the ground and able to be moried. It's fine cause I got it next game though.
---
So the compressed air can knock loose and push the dust around yes I wouldn't rely on doing it with a closed system obviously. It will also blow a lot of the dust out as well. But I would do it with the case open.
---
Just some advice from someone who works with electronics and conputers
---
As for when my pro got loud after I cleaned it and reapplied thermal paste it no longer gets loud during dbd
---
Im going to make up some numbers to explain it so think of it like this...
---
Most games say heat your system up 70% dbd heats it up lets say 95% but your console isn't cooling 100% its cooling at say only 85% efficiency
---
So when dbd is trying to use the system where other games don't its highlighting the fact the system is not cooling at its full capacity.
---
Most electronics will shut off to save them from damage but repeated shutdowns and repeated exposure can lead to problems such as parts wearing out faster or chip creep from heating and cooling.
---
I dont know what your setup looks like, maybe its bad air flow, maybe the fan isn't working as it should, maybe they didnt put enough thermal paste or it dried up manufacturing screwups happen.
---
Yes dbd should cap the frames as there isn't a need for unlimited in the places it has it.
---
But I was just trying to help offer some advice on some TLC for the system or look at warranty because if its 9 months old and having issue its going to be in rough shape even further out.
---
But hey the logic Im using here is based on the fact only a handful of players have this issue with consoles on dbd the vast majority of us playing on the same systems our systems are not shutting down... its an overheat issue.
---
I don't understand how some streamers can so easily be like "yup i heard someone breathe 20 meters away from me." I have a really nice pair of audiophile headphones and probably a thousand hours as killer, and I'm lucky to hear someone injured in a locker, let alone someone's static *breath*.

smh. the moment when all of the survivors goes to one generator. that is why you don't do that and spread out to more than one gen you morons. geez i am sorry you got so much salt in the end game chat
---
Trapper didn‚Äôt look appealing but Uncle Steve was tasty!
---
I mean... yeah...
---
I can agree on not facecamping, like patrol the area at least, but still, we dont know what rank the killer was, maybe he was new.
---
i stopped using whispers cuz i get the game like every other match and whispers is just permanently active on that map
---
Corrupt Intervention lasts about a minute and a half more than Ruin does in most cases. LOL! I like the way you think, sir!
---
i can't play spirit cuz i have good headphones and unless they are injured, i can't hear any of their movements
---
I am a legion main at rank 1 my favourite build is;
---
Ruin, Pop, Im all ears and BBQ for points really
---
Addons both duration Stolen sketch and Mural
---
If you want slight more tryhard build
---
Ruin, Pop, Im all ears and Thrilling/Enduring
---
Addons Cold dirt or Filthy blade and Stolen Sketch
---
Notable good perks I enjoy running are;
---
Brutal strength is so good on legion
---
Corrupt intervention
---
Shadowborn
---
Weird one but Make your choice
---
I average 2-3 kills per game, do get 4 and can get 1 or 0 in the rare sweaty swf
---
You almost always get brutal killer or higher though even if you get 0 kills because of his power
---
Have fun with it and join the club of telling BHVR to buff legion because more than 70% of his addons are borderline useless and deep wounds atm is weak
---
I think that's not sushi.
---
The purple kinda works like an insta-heal

Yo, not my fault you don't know how to search around

That's a great one! Thanks!
---
So Pig is taller than Ghostface? Who would've thought.
---
Hey, so how do survivors compare to them?
---
Man, it's end game, you know. Really what is he supposed to do, chase everyone and hope he gets more people? Sucks, but it happens. I'm pretty glad I haven't played this title in awhile, it's almost as much of a salt mine as CS:GO. If you can't handle a player fulfilling their objective, albeit in an annoying way, then don't play. He played, he didn't cheat, he got kills. What else is there to say?
---
while i agree camping is awful, console killers that lag switch are much worse. had like six in the past two days
---
Tbag this, bitch
---
Its really just a hit protection item. I like it but wish the needle wasnt ultra rare. Too expensive.
---
I‚Äôm all you have to do is make sure you don‚Äôt hit walls meaning just move your thumb stick away from any objects. you shouldn‚Äôt be using it too close to walls and shit anyway common sense
---
a light-person?
---
Taken. :/
---
I was just saying it to start shit for fun but obviously he got heated
---
rank 10 is a good rank to hover at. I'm pretty shit too, but i hover in purple ranks which sucks cuz every game is either a 4k stomp against yellow and green ranks or a 4 man escape against red ranks
---
I was like 2 seconds from dying to endgame too! Hopefully you'll get it soon

The needle is very underpowered because of the timer
---
Thank u! I am, since its my first time making a scenery :-)
---
Because survivors are overall bad at those ranks, if they are truly that rank, rather than 2k+ hour survivors that derank to bully killers.
---
These survivors gen tap or spend 8 minutes mindlessly searching for ruin. They run and hide at first sound of the heartbeat, and they don't run well. Because they don't run well, chases are over very quickly, and generators aren't getting done. 
---
Both sides take a good amount of effort to do well, but the floor for killers is much higher against more skilled opponents, and survivors quite clearly have it easier in the grand scheme. Survivors have complete control over a match; whether or not they're good enough to utilize that control is a different story.
---
Okay thanks I‚Äôll definitely try the Add ons and the pressure tactic
---
Well you did make a survivor vs killer post so what did you expect?

I main Ghostface, and really like Hex: Ruin, Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher, and A Nurses Calling.
---
Thanks so much for sharing!!!!!!
---
in my experience red rank survivors are much nicer end game than yellow and green ranks. maybe thats just cuz i sit between 10- 7 so they see the rank disparity and feel bad
---
Someone to get triggered by me saying NOED is toxic lmao but he made it personal because it bothered him that bad
---
was this for the basement challenge? if so ouch
---
Twas' merely a meme
---
Yeah, I think 12 seconds is pretty damned balanced. But 16....
---
Daaaaaaaaaaamn!!!!! That's awesome!!!!! I'm not too worried about it, honestly. I just have fun with it!
---
Here's one: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e9jzis/killers_ingame_height/
---
I got accused as being a basement camper with Wraith on the game... Yea totally camping when I can read when survivors are going for the save from A) scratches and B) I've played the game for 3 years now, game sense is pretty much down to a tee for me. It doesn't stop there, the redneck sister-fuckin player who accused me of basement camping also said Wraith is one of the best killers in the game. Better than Nurse. Better than Billy. Even said my T1 MaA and T1 Surveillance are crutch perks.
---
I can hear Bill from other *games* sometimes, bro.
---
the emblems are stupid. I've pip'd with 1 kill and black pip'd with 4
---
You were provoking him for that specific reason, you just said that
---
Someone already did one: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e9jzis/killers_ingame_height/
---
Me too ngl, it'd be nice to get it as killer but I switched from killer main to survivor main and don't really want to go back haha
---
Those are gods.
---
I love Jeff so much, I will play my CorpsePaintBoi till the end of time &lt;3 But holy SHIT I wish he would shut the absolute hell up, he is constantly SHOUTING!
---
Got it.
---
To personally attack me? No lmao
---
Those are his cosmetics, you have to unlock them, they have been in for a while.
---
16 is a little much
---
purple* cuz almost every game as a purple rank killer is against red rank survivors and anything below purple, the survivors refuse to play around your power so you go from stomping to being destroyed and not knowing how you got so far while being so bad
---
can someone link it again the links dont wrk
---
Hm, are there only 4 slots?
---
If so, a Claudette mask, a Meg mask, a Jake Mask, and a Dwight mask. =|
---
I honestly have a different view with STBFL. I actually find it good that you can now hit your obsession in order to chain your frenzy and not lose stacks. But that‚Äôs just me.
---
Since his release date to be precise
---
Myers, Huntress, Oni, Hag, ans Billy are the pinnacles of balance.
---
You unlock them by killing multiple Megs, Claudettes, Jakes, &amp; Neas.
---
Actually luck incarnate and it's beautiful
---
LMAO I HAVENT PLAYED THIS GAME IN MONTHS AND THE SAME SHIT IS HAPPENING. "OHH BUT MUH END GAME COLLAPSE WILL FIX IT!" GOOD JOB BHVR, GLAD THAT DEATHGARDEN DIED FOR THIS
---
Sure. I mean quitting like a little bitch when you get beat is a viable option. Better than a participation prize. They get a cowardice medal instead. 
---
My point is I don't need a pat on the back when I lose. I try to think about why I lost and what mistakes I made to get outplayed and learn from them to improve. Like any rational person should do. If I get face camped so be it. It sucks, but use that time on the hook to think about why you got caught in the first place. Cuz it could have been avoided. 
---
You are not responsible for other people's enjoyment. That's the game and devs responsibility. Don't apologize or feel bad cuz you camped and hooked four in the basement. Celebrate the victory and move on. Own that shit.
---
He's a licenced character so they would have to get confirmation from the creators of Halloween to make cosmetics for him.
---
It's going to be rough to do well in higher ranks without ruin. It's still completely possible to 4k for all day long without it, you just have to make next to no mistakes.
---
Congrats!!
---
Quite literally a Shitpost.
---
he the bottom who ain‚Äôt washin his ass after he preps üò∑
---
That's a bit of a buff to it, but you also half the amount of stacks you get from everyone else no?
---
thumbstick... right... console player telling someone how the game works... sounds about right
---
Oh I see. They should try I think it would be good
---
And yet Freddy, while shorter in height and weapon length, has the same lunge as trapper.
---
So it‚Äôs not a bad hitbox, it‚Äôs just making it even?
---
Remember when Bubba was trash? Pepperidge Farm Remembers...and so does everyone else
---
Camping is a viable strat, prove me wrong
---
also the fuck are you talking about, we are talking about indoors, there is no distance from walls. Even the halls are filled with just random crap
---
Oh... gotcha, alright.
---
Yup , it was ;(
---
I did this with bond/no mither/resilience with one try
---
Just search up for mates working on gens when u finished one
---
I might start doing this too.
---
As a very quick heads up, I'm not an Angry Killer Main‚Ñ¢. Just saw this and it made me laugh.
---
if youre revving up your chainsaw as leather it should be because you're about to get a guaranteed down provided survivor doesn't do any last second fuckery, you rarely have to worry about wanting or needing to stop
---
deathnote! yesss.
---
Yes. However, I recommend you give it a try with a new view. You only go after those who aren‚Äôt the obsession after frenzy. It allows you to keep the obsession busy mending and healing (under overall pressure) than just letting him roam free because you don‚Äôt want to lose stacks.
---
I find dying light never really works well. Even if I took dying light or a different slow down perk, I still would be down a perk slot, which I could be using on a more fun perk.

Ladies and Gents, Backwatter Swamp.
---
Imagine screaming like an animal while wildly swinging your chainsaw back and forth JUST to cut some ass hair off a survivor.
---
I'm the friend in question. I do it when I'm playing killer to because each killer has a distinct personality to them, and their perks are often a reflection of it. 
---
For example, when playing Huntresses, I act more territorial, and focus on a small number of gens(which are most of time around the basement), or when I'm playing Michael, I act obsessive over a certain surviver, but try to "save the best for last".
---
The only reason he has a cosmetic is because the creators agreed that it related to his story. So, they really have no way of making any cosmetics that people request. This is the reason why Laurie doesn't have an Ugly Christmas Sweater.
---
I mean, yeah, survivors can force the killer to tunnel. A DS user trying to repair an important gen directly under their hook 2 seconds after they get off it, while injured. A DS user coming in for the hook rescue on someone else. A DS user following my Hag around, ready to break my web of traps as I place them, then jumping in a locker if I turn around. 
---
Like yeah, DS is an anti-tunneling perk. The problem is that it still allows you to force the killer to tunnel you, as in the "active DS player bodyblocks for teammate" example. Then it punishes the killer for taking the only option on the table.
---
There‚Äôs not much but there is a few things like the gown and the Pipe
---
People are doing that to farm tiers, play as killer and afk in the corner. Survivors run around and do their thing until all gens are done and then if they don't get to leaving you can force a door open. 
---
Not the best but with survivor queue being like 20 minutes for me I'll take the win, let them read a book or something lol.
---
It's cute how emotional they get
---
I imagine the best counter would be to get the Killer within your line of sight in an open area and continually strafe behind obstacles while they look around within the Whispers range.
---
I suppose if you're *really lucky* you can waste their time while they stay in the area so that the others can do generators
---
What's this from?
---
I'd prefer both üëÄ
---
Can't say I blame you! I'm a HORRIBLE killer!!!!!!!
---
Ace looks hotter than shirtless David change my mind
---
Console players play the game too yanno not just pc players lol? I‚Äôm sorry of players know all like calm down bud
---
Yeah but it does nothing to reduce the sounds so like it's not really a point
---
Yeah indoors meaning you should use your power at certain times so maybe using it when a survivor is close to a window isn‚Äôt the best idea just saying
---
Calm Spirit won‚Äôt help with noise levels from getting smacked, it only effects screams like from The Doctor or stepping in a trap. Iron Will is what reduces pain noises...
---
&gt;Freddy's Lunge is exactly the same as all other Killers; it merely looks longer because Freddy's character model / weapon is shorter
---
Sorry I'm just so fucking pissed of r/entitledsurvivors who don't look behind themselves in a chase and then blame hitboxes or some bullshit as to why they lost and start demanding nerfs to shit the devs won't touch instead of actually improving and giving genuine constructive criticism.
---
i have about 100 hours in the game and when i only had about 30, i climbed from rank 20 to rank 8 using only hag double pipd every game and not a single survivor below rank 8 knew you could crouch over her traps. the moment i hit rank 8, i only black pipd cuz the purple and red rank survivors stopped being easy games
---
Wtf
---
Trying to do the do t get hooked challenge. Seriously ive died 3 times right before i could escape and when i give up i manage to not get hooked
---
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because you tried to escape with an active bear trap
---
Seriously!! Playing as the only solo survivor really sucks. The three-person-group will leave you to die, sabotage the game if one of their friends gets killed, ragequit, etc. So annoying.
---
This. Poor map design is the root of almost every single problem with the game‚Äôs balance.
---
Can someone photoshop normal teeth into that so i becomes cursed?
---
You can also in public matches. Of course you risk getting banned though
---
I don‚Äôt know but I think you just need to be there when the generator finishes not the whole thing. I would also run perks to help with it too. The obvious dark sense spinechill prove thyself or immersion perks. I hope that helps
---
Help I dont know how to make perk concepts
---
Survivor mains: *Derank to bully yellow rank Killers and then tell them to kill themselves in post-game chat.*
---
Also Survivor mains: Why are queue times so long? Why is the playerbase dying? Why does no one play Killer?
---
Huh...you cant escape throught the door if your RBT is active...
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be obvious the effect would be extremely subtle. It would just be smoke
---
Moving around the skulls then the smoke would go into the candle then
---
Light the totem. It wouldn‚Äôt be flashy or loud.
---
You can, there's just a different method of doing so. Even Umbra did it and uploaded it.
---
This is too accurate, only because the DS survivor is chubby and will be caught by the fast skinny guy within a few seconds.
---
I'M RAGING ON BEHALF OF MY TEAM:

---
I dunno why people had issues with the Halloween event, it's something  different and cool, some people farming isn't that bad, get over it. If people farming during the event bothers them so much that all events get removed, why not just play something else for literally like a week.
---
Man I feel you. Got to red rank this week and shit is tough, flashlight clicks, tea bags and all, and Im not good enough to catch the fuckers. YET!
---
Better nerf Oni some more amirite ü§î
---
(That post game fiesta was amazing BTW)
---
The challenges were so much easier than I thought and I am being a realist. The only too difficult is six feet under and that is on an optional path.
---
How is grab 2 survivors in any amount of games hard?
---
Hit 25 times in any games really?
---
They are all so easy Dark sense is the difficulty this tome should be but whiney people want what they want.
---
The final part of the tome the hardest bit is this.. and stunning killer 4x in a game is not that deep. Might take a few games but its a CHALLENGE.
---
Now we know why he gets bullied
---
If you put in the bottles and the bell you might've missed the RBT and the Trapper Trap
---
WE CAN'T KNOW THAT YOU FOUND THE HATCH WE STAY SO WE CAN UNHOOK YOU.

Ah yes, she focused her inner blendette power.

Lol I played a game that sounds exactly like this last night. I might have been that nurse. I picked off two but the others escaped after I couldn‚Äôt keep up with the three gen strat
---
They‚Äôre from the South.
---
I like them all but being chased for 60 minutes that‚Äôs way too long but I like the idea of the last one
---
You can run netflix through a VM, I think that works

But I made it my goal to make heavy use of his dash as whip training lmao.
---
I play on Xbox and during the day you get into survivor games so fast but at night killer lobby‚Äôs load like in 1 minute? Is that just me?
---
Yeah that is pretty bad
---
I put that last one up since most of the time killers always respect pallets making it kinda hard; or I just never get found at all for some reason.
---
Six feet under I might never do. Only good thing is the lore. But I‚Äôm not wasting my time for that one.
---
I‚Äôm a gen jockey, but not at all to do 4 gens in one match. I‚Äôm pretty sure my teammates will just do 2 gens leaving me -1.
---
She tried to bait BT or DS. Tough luck to her. Next time she better not play with fire, if she's gonna cry when she gets burnt.
---
They could benefit from the moon in game too
---
Firstly props to you for replying with a good discussion thank you truely.
---
Yeah six feet under is rough I done it with luck the survivor knew what I was doing and gave it but it was luck.
---
The dark sense just takes few tries, I am sure you will get it soon!
---
True, but it's been a rough day and I guess this toxic survivor just gave me a reason to get my anger out
---
Lol I'm stupid didn't know
---
You should work on that.
---
Would love to see Nosferatu climb out of a locker and get a survivor lol.
---
This actual sweater exists my friend has it. I compared it to his and it‚Äôs literally the same pattern. So you can buy the real thing if you snoop the internet.

I'd still like to believe you watch gay porn just for the openings.

It's usually what they do, but he wasn't in the basesment he might have got a little lost

---
It happened to me earlier. Also Feng, no addons though
---
Is it tactical to main the smallest survivor since you're less-likely to be seen by the killer? How much of a difference would it make? Is it more advantageous than Blendette?
---
I don't think I've ever heard him called Leather before. Only Bubba, Leatherface, or trash can
---
How's your ping? This only happens to me when my internet is acting up
---
MaA T1 &amp; T1 Surveillance, Crutches? i don't know if i should laugh or smash my head on my desk.

Someone to not try and "start shit"

Thatd actually be cool, or they can hang on the entities tentacles
---
*spider legs
---
His weapon is really uninspired tbh. Just a normal ass flip knife.
---
Who's does he has? because i can't find any, let alone the specific one i want (Ace's)
---
What's being a garage like?
---
You got vibe checked down to the abyss
---
My only worry is how similar they would likely look to the Plague
---
Pretty interesting tbh, I really hate the whole opening and closing part bit hey, its life man
---
What can I say, they pull you in with the opening, then it just gets... *real interesting*
---
Me neither. Someone explain?
---
Not sure why people are downvoting you, I personally feel that most survivor mains tend to be toxic pos too
---
I'm wondering where else they could hang survivor charms. Currently their waist isn't a bad option it's just that they're really small and are incompatible with certain cosmetics like Adams trench coat. I was thinking maybe on gens? Or perhaps they could hang on the exit gates.
---
Ok ill gona delete the post
---
r/rareinstults
---
I think that everytime a survivor  teabags me
---
Surveillance and PGTW work wonderfully.
---
My default build is:
---
BBQ, for sweet points and info
---
Surveillance for cheeky info
---
PGTW to cash in Surveillance
---
Fourth is killer specific
---
r/rareinsults
---
I generally only do it at pallets because I have good enough timing that I can hit them about 2/3 of the time
---
Imagine being a victim of a ruined game for behaving like an ass and taunting with flashlights and teabags
---
Most likely lag. That's the only reasonable explanation I can think of
---
Same
---
They all have the same range
---
Only if Grandpa does it
---
Looping takes some time to learn and sometimes a bit of luck too. You‚Äôll get the hang of it. üôÉ
---
One thing to consider is if there is 1 gen left, as long as you are working on one when another finishes, all generators become powered once the gates are active so it counts as a gen.
---
HERE COMES THE CRAPPER
---
/r/serialkillerredditnames
---
*extremely sad console noises*
---
Wait, you DC over the fact you couldn‚Äôt find a totem?
---
That‚Äôs okay. (I recently made three survivor perks)[https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/edg4t6/some_personal_survivor_perks_i_came_up_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf] too, and you can use it as an example.
---
Firstly, note that making perks is difficult. You have to have knowledge [(or a way to access the knowledge)](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Perks) of all the perks that exist in the game. This is because the perks you conceptualize have to not be too similar to existing perks, and they have to be viable, meaning they can be used on their own and be complimented by another perk.
---
You also have to be more creative. A perk that only dishes out status effects for very little requirements will always feel uninspired. Try thinking of a way to either spin the mechanics, or create a new one (like how Yui‚Äôs perk, Any Means Necessary, adds the ability to lift pallets). Keep in mind, you don‚Äôt have to make *good* perks, just viable and fun ones for both sides. Meme perks exist for a reason, however shouldn‚Äôt be the primary focus when making a perk. Meme perks exist because the perk is usually only useful in niche situations, or not useful enough and only affect your gameplay, like No Mither, or Sippery Meat.
---
Lastly, **Balancing**. You need to make sure the perks are fun to use and fun to go against. Not to mention, you should be aware of potential mechanics and other perks that can be used to abuse your perks. If a perk is powerful, there should either be drawbacks, a specific requirement to activate the perk, or a timer/cooldown the perk can be used. For example, Object of Obsession, Mettle of Man, and Decisive Strike, are all very powerful perks, but have one or more of these balancing factors. For example:
---
* OoO reveals your aura, which is a drawback, but it doesn‚Äôt limit gameplay if the survivor is very experienced. 
---
* Mettle of Man is a strong perk, but it‚Äôs difficult, yet very possible, to activate. 
---
* DS has a timer set on it once activated, and is then disabled for the rest of the match.
---
Make sure you know how to balance your perks. 
---
Also, Use other perks that exist to word your oerk explanations properly. That way, it feels more canon and proper.
---
does your corpse paint face also have a messed up beard after the stranger things release patch?
---
Yep, I know. And it‚Äôs stupid.
---
I see... Tell me more.
---
I don't mind fuckwads t-bagging at pallets you already wasted the pallet now you're wasting time by t-bagging whats not to like...
---
These days I don't even go near exit gates anymore when they are opened I just scourge the field for leftover pallets and such, stand there doing nothing at least I'm hunting points!
---
Lemme rephrase. I only do it when I‚Äôm waiting for the killer to catch up with me at the pallet rather than wasting my time losing on a loop
---
.... No I DC because it's too dark to see in general
---
I should probably stop now but I liked this one too... https://imgur.com/RxTcgW9.jpg
---
To prevent gen tapping, get rid of ruin
---
You're for sure going to need a full SWF group to make it work. You'll need 4 Vigo's Jars of Salty Lips. This will give you a 12% boost. And 4 Up The Ante's. This will give you a 27% boost. That'll total up to a 43% chance to unhook yourself if you count the base 4% you have. I may have missed something so do let me know
---
Nothing wrong with gen tapping, Killer man by the way
---
I couldn‚Äôt get two because killers are so petrified of being hit by pallets
---
Awe so cute
---
In the mid-game whispers is active the entire time, its main purpose is 2 find the first and last survivor
---
Run a chase but use all the pallets. I prefer window loops normally, but you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
Too much salt is bad for you, you know?
---
Are you holding the button for the full duration? It's not a kick if you don't complete the interaction. Are you also sure you have the challenge active?
---
Failing that, if it's a bug you'll need to contact BHVR's support team.
---
Farm with them. Farming is great when you want bp but no rank down. I‚Äôll go help them find a totem or something and let them stun me along the way, in exchange for damaging stuff and a hit or two
---
Uhh I‚Äôd just run iron will and calm spirit duhh
---
I'm on ethernet cable so I wouldn't know, usually it's between 60 and 80
---
Not enough salt &amp; you die tho so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
It sounds like a win more power, which is usually the worst type of abilities in games and the least enjoyable to play against.  Its also very vague.
---
Additionally, the plague is already something like a high priest, and the entity may get ticked if someone else is stealing his noms.
---
My first thought of something like this could work was a holy/unholy light sort of power (or just light/shadow) with completed gens providing cleansing light, and the killer puts sticky darkness on survivors.  But then thinking about it, thats just the plague again.
---
Thats a yikes from me dawg. Thanks for the info
---
Oh, ok, sorry
---
I get it. Gens go fast and you use a perk and the survivors just negate that too.
---
I fucking hate Ace for this, he is so *fucking* quiet. I wish they'd standardize the sounds survivors make in terms of grunts and moans and shit so players didn't feel so screwed just cause they like Jane or Bill more than Ace or maybe Adam.
---
The overuse of ruin is a symptop of ruin being overpowered.  No other perk changes the game so much, decisive was never this impactful.  Survivors don't get to play the game until they find a randomly generated totem.  There's a reason the game now his a 75-80% lethality rate.  "Killer mains" (people without friends who whine a lot to begin with) whined about every game they didn't get a 4k.  Now they get 4ks in 75% of games and they still whine.
---
Gen tapping at the start of a gen? K you have fun imma go find another.
---
Gen tapping at the last few seconds of a gen? Omg just hold m1, it's not hard
---
Gen tapping *after* ruin is gone? Ohmylawd this dweet so precious &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
---
Yea, I think the killer managed to expose everybody. Because he one shot everybody except for that one girl who he didn‚Äôt get full stalk on. And I think that the killer entering lockers must be the new patch. Also how did you enter the game late? Is that a feature of KYF?
---
Base image at least?
---
I actually did the 4 gens challenge... I took bond and a nice toolbox, it went pretty well. ( No premade)
---
that doesn't really have anything to do with my comment. the point is the on the game, its active the whole match and doesn't help you find anyone. its such a confined map where its depth is from the multiple floors which throws off whispers helping in anyway. sure they might be near, but are they even on your floor?
---
No idea, KYF is weird man.
---
I just delete messages the minute I get them.
---
The one and only time I engaged I was called tunneling, camping trash f*ggot. Then I was "threatened" my gameplay was going to be uploaded to Reddit. Then his personal army would dox me and ruin my life.
---
Never a dull moment in my inbox to say the least.
---
Yes, the developers should definitely listen to the playerbase. The will solve all of our problems.
---
Survivors can take 2 hooks before dying on their 3rd. They're meant to get off the hooks, dude. Just go for the unhooker
---
I counter that gen tapping is slow as fuck and still fulfills ruins purpose.
---
Idk. Legion feels like the most uninspired weapon, just a regular knife. At least Clown has his bottles and that adds a little to his uniqueness. A croquet type mallet might've worked for him, but I can't really think of anything else that'd fit.
---
That's why Kate and Ace are so played
---
Gen tapping is awesome ppl should do it more when I play killer
---
Gen tapping slows gen speed down by at least 50%. By all means please tap the gens, it's faster to just fail every ruin skill check.
---
Thanks, I fucking hate it
---
same
---
16 after a hit is pretty reasonable... Speed boost to a loop then pray. 8 second mend times? Now that's outrageousüòì
---
OH fk, yea fair enough its actually useless on indoor maps
---
Now you have to kill everyone while using 3 of your perk spots to be a beefy delivery guy
---
*Acts like a turkey, is surprised when everyone calls him one*
---
If I see people tapping I purposely miss skill checks to ruin their day
---
Can confirm. Lol
---
Yeah it doesn't in-game, just in the lobby, which is good cause that would be an easy giveaway.
---
*smoke wafts out of locker*
---
I think a lot of killers are starting to take this attitude, I‚Äôve been waiting at the exit gate (not t-bagging) for them to get the traditional last hit a few times and they‚Äôve never came.
---
Damn where'd you get a 4k PNG of Wraith?
---
I glanced at it once and that was enough lol
---
It's because they're all survivor mains, everything is offensive lol
---
YEET
---
Devs said No winter event due to the massive amount of christmas cosmetics, and that they want events to ne more tailored towards the archives. x2 BP is something like January 2nd to January 6th.
---
This guy gets it
---
Someone took she arm
---
No man, Ace-daddy is the slickest senior on this side of the fog and faster than a oni with bloodlust. That's why all the cool cats love Ace
---
If you add something that moderately increases healing speed it isn't too bad, but yeah I remember it used to be 8 seconds, I think 12 was about right.
---
I usually use it after an unhook so I can run the killer away.
---
What rank r u? I‚Äôm at the every rank except 1 and 15 point
---
If is then is a really bad scream
---
3/10
---
Maybe he was just having a bad day or drunk, etc. Not everyone has to do well every single game. Sometimes I play decently. Other times I'm terrible.
---
Ew anime
---
Settle down tiger, it's just a joke. Most people understand that Freddy has the exact same lunge range as the rest.
---
Rank 8 rn
---
I've already made my point dickhead. Billions$$$ + POTUS = not stupid. The other chap said he is stupid because of antivax, climate change and history muck ups.
---
What, are we supposed to go back and forth and waffle on about who has the biggest dick? Well guess what. It seems we have and it turns out to be YOU.
---
Better?
---
Rank 8
---
DUDE FACTS LMAO it‚Äôs so annoying
---
:o same
---
teabagging is just for fun, stop taking the game so seriously, i do it as survivor and have it done as killer, it's just a mechanic, like how survivors point at you, it's all in good fun.
---
Thats how its supposed to work, lol.
---
I basically just flashlight-clicked every killer until someone actually got *a n g e r y*, then proceeded to throw every pallet. I died, but got my challenge and the time it took him to kill me got my team the win, so overall, not too bad.
---
Damn you got me Chum. Lock me up and throw me in prison. Hurry before I stop caring
---
How do I 4k as survivor?
---
I adore Feng's sweater.
---
Glad to see that bug back again lol! BhVR patches it and then it comes back, just like the rest of their bugs...
---
Or be hag and leave everyone confused how such a little tater tot can carry a beefy boi like David
---
Mate you need to chill. This was just a joke.
---
Yellow Qs are instant, green is ok and purple/red are an eternity. Way more baby killers than baby survs. Deranking is pretty hype rn.
---
Tome 1 ends on January 7 so it'd make sense. Bit weird that there's going to be 0 downtime, that's a great way to make players feel like they're burning out, especially since it'll be the last chance rush to get the last levels.
---
Hanukkah pennywise Hanukkah pennywise
---
&gt; Survivors will just bang out Greats once Ruin is gone and complete the gen way faster due to the bonus.
---
That's a fair point I hadn't thought of.  I guess without ruin that skill check would have to be without a great zone, like when sealing a demi portal
---
When I first started playing Jeff I was confused as I thought that a female character had spawned next to me, but I saw no one. Then I realized that the breathing sounds were actually Jeff's.  
---
Goes to show how incompetent these devs can be. There's no reason to pick anyone other than Claudette. They have the opportunity to balance visual and audio elements so that big characters are quieter and shorter characters are louder yet Jeff and Jane are both fat AND loud.
---
Its heen timed and tested. Using only normal success checks the speed is signifficantly slower to tap. It is a strict disadvantage.
---
Its maybe only used in multiman genning, though that then compounds the effective value of ruin by so much its also a strict disadvantage.
---
Map doesn‚Äôt really matter to me unless it‚Äôs lampkin, I got adept billy on lerys
---
This is why DbD is rated 18
---
Yeah, and it will also do the exact opposite. What comes around is all around, as they say
---
**Stop!**
---
Oh that sweet revenge, even as a survivor main I loved this.
---
Recently I read tapping is as fast or slow as landing 3 "good" ruin skill checks.  That isn't very significant, is it?
---
Dark sense challenge just derank to 16 by afking 60 times. No one does gens at 16 so their all yours champ.
---
It's intentional, the tooltips for the Hag note that they "disorient" the survivors. That said, I wouldn't be averse to getting rid of it, but she'd need to have her slow and reduced lunge after teleport removed to compensate - the camera flick is actually a big part of why she can get quick hits after teleporting.
---
Surely you'd be thrown in prison before being locked up? 
---
I don't really want to talk to you. You scare me. How did you know my name is Chum? Stalker.
---
This guy needs an Oscar.
---
look behind you when your being chased psycho
---
It‚Äôs also not fun getting looped :/
