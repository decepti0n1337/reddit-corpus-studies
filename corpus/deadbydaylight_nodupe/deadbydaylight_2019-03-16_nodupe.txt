What is this map rng though? :D

WP anyways\^\^

---
Why don‚Äôt you come on up and ooze in my ass sometime, tutzi luhhaa 
---
If you use the killers, you become a better survivor. Because, you learn all of their tricks :)
---
It's the people who get upset that they aren't overpowered like in the first half of slasher movies and actually have opponents who can do...anything, who then dismiss complaints of camping/tunneling with "well it's in the game," and somehow don't see the irony.
---
Wait really? I thought Adiris was roughly the same height as Michael and Huntress.
---
I wouldn't even really call that a buff, it just made it so you don't need self care and it takes longer.
---
Right after you use half your perks on anti gen stuff like the plague's new stuff and ruin. Then use the other half on perks that slow the game down more or counter looping bc simply finding survivors is the easy part. Downing them in a reasonable time so 3+gens dont pop is the hard part.
---
If you normally kill everyone with 1 gen done at rank 1, then how is that it's GG if the first person is good at looping?
---
**Haddonfield Loads**
---
I‚Äôm Laurie Strode and I‚Äôm here to make it clear,
---
I know you hate me baby, that‚Äôs why I brought you here!
---
Was a bitch from Halloween, I‚Äôm gonna make them rage, give me a flashlight challenge and I‚Äôll give u what u like.
---
I‚Äôm full of perks baby! Just like a P3! A room full of killers and it makes me wanna scream! I‚Äôm gonna get this right, so I can waste your time, not like my small game, I‚Äôm killing with decisive strike!
---
*Iiiiimmmmm gonna show you fireeeecrackers, you‚Äôre goiiinnng crazy and instablind*

dbz(A!) meme, a VERY CRITICAL DISTRINTION.
---
Swf wait time has been phenominal for me on console. Usually with just two people it takes like 20 minutes, now it just takes a few. 
---
Me with my actual love and appreciation for Claudette
---
I style on these hoes pls let me play her at least it's not P3 outfit 
---
Fighting entitlement by not giving them the time of day.
---
Fixed that for you :P
---
I'm more excited for Wraith's new Mummy outfit. It looks pretty sweet!
---
Yeeeeasss that's the type of killer I'm looking for. Mori me daddy üòãüòçüòã
---
I challenged myself to prestige II my David using only No Mither. Let me tell you, the rage quitting and endless DCs made that a very, very tough challenge to accomplish. Hahah.
---
New killer looks dope!
---
I use Iron Will, Lightweight, Quick &amp; Quiet, and either Urban or Calm. I say Quick &amp; Quiet is better than Distortion because lockers and gens hide your aura, so I can quickly dodge BBQ and then get back to work. Lightweight is great because I prefer to run, so killers have a shorter window to spot my scratchmarks. It helps in chases, too.
---
Lol when you have over 2000 hours in the game and don't bother with that whole lobby dodging shit. Sucks for the new players though, before when I saw I went up against a swf team I'd just put on a better build, guess ill just leave it on from now on.
---
That was an extreme amount of jungle gyms right next to each other. I'm assuming all of ya'll got out right?
---
In my PERSONAL experience, at least 60-75% of SWF groups i face end up being entitled, toxic shit fucks.
---
I still play against them but i turned off messaging from randos because it gets annoying listening to their bullshit
---
Let's just be honest- *both* of 'em sound completely bonkers. 
---
Oh ok thank you for the advice !
---
So... one could say Stephan helped make DBD...
---
Mine would definitely be Cardi B yelling OKURRRRTTTT every time I revved Billy's chainsaw. And SHMONEYYY every time I downed someone with my sledgehammer.
---
Once I saw 2 of my teammates on the exact opposite side of the map hiding in lockers while I was hooked on the 3rd side and the killer was hooking someone on the 4th.
---
Which won't really fix anything considering top SWF teams would still be oppressive.
---
It would honour him.
---
Ban evasion is banable. No0b3 got a pass becuase he's liked by the community, and he did not get an explanation to his last ban. 
---
So long partner 
---
Hey man if your looking for people to play with let me know my friends do a kyf everyone once and a while and it‚Äôs all out. No hostility just us trying to get better and use some perks we might not have on our typical load out. Everyone‚Äôs real friendly and no one takes shit seriously lol 
---
Shhhh, don't scare him away, they are easily spooked.
---
Thought this was r/dbdgonewild
---
Yeet
---
Most GAMES I play at even semi-high rank is exactly like you said, people playing extremely coordinated to do gens, or a group that just goes for toxic saves over and over (the latter is MUCH easier to deal with tbh)
---
You sound like a lovely person to be around.
---
Oh wait, I can't you have that thing set up so only friends of your friends can send you a request. My username is matheus26110
---
Why? Not like it'll affect your play style! XD
---
That's obviously Nea
---
Could someone better than me figure out his ability and perks
---
it‚Äôs all good brother 
---
Honestly, I would imagine him as a survivor. Robbie ain't a killer. He may have caused trouble, but he never resorted to that.
---
Not even just killer builds are rendered useless, some entire killer Powers are rendered useless lol, hag, trapper, and any stealth killers like pig or low tier myers 
---
If they're bloody they're not your buddy
---
Danish Myers is clearly too good. 
---
But can we talk about how you uploaded a screenshot of your screenshot edit, instead of just saving the edit?
---
More DC's against people with cosmetics.
---
Any money.
---
Okay but it's literally so close to DBD that's actually kinda spooky asdf;lkjs
---
To be fair, uh, Dende becomes the guardian of Earth. So he could do this.
---
Well, yeah, im lazy
---
Toxic Stephanie with flashlight makes the killer dc
---
Empathy or Bond would be better choices above those other two you listed. Knowing where the Killer is less important than knowing what your teammates are doing, because you want to make sure the entire team isn't crowding the hook as soon as someone is caught.
---
What resolution do you play on? It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre playing DBD on your phone vertically 
---
True. I was just shittalking. I think that scene is from the Namek arc zhough.
---
Please remove this perk from the game.
---
dumb motherfucker isn't even running enduring wtf
---
Don't fall for random thots guys...
---
No way would repeatedly dunking Robbie Rotten while clicking flashlights and teabagging at him be an honour.
---
i dont want it to be removed. Just re worked like DS. I dont run Ds or really any Super toxic Perks. That game i was running Balanced landing, SC, Plunderers, and ace in the hole. Its really annoying to be running a build like that and lose Due to a perk like that. 
---
It's like nobody gets tired of having the same 'conversations' every day. 
---
Claudette is invisible, its a joke.
---
You seem to underestimate his power, his ability is immediately killing anybody within a 60 mile radius thus instantly ending the game
---
Sounds like Reddit to me. ~
---
werk
---
&gt; Me and my friends played a game today
---
Then you done all 5 gens without cleaning totems? Cmon it's not that hard when you're playing with friends to try and track totems. Nowadays I barely ever sprint to exit gates without first seeing if the killer could be running NOED. 
---
Dude if no one talked about DS it would have never been touched. NOED is not fun at all and the counters to it are just horrible 
---
If all 3 of you got downed because of NOED, that's your fault. At some point people need to understand the concept of taking one for the team and being the martyr that everyone needs to open the gates and escape. NOED punishes reckless altruism.
---
You're not wrong, I think that is the only time Dende gets scuffed up. Otherwise he just jacks off in his tower as everybody dies.
---
"females"
---
my older brother is named kyle
---
we had no time to cleanse totems dude. we had 3 teammates getting chased 24/7 
---
You'll be fine so many people report people for stupid shit no one ever actually gets banned anymore 
---
Camping reports are a thing they get every 30 seconds, and they always laugh at it and trash it.
---
They already released a list of things that should not be reported, and camping was number 1 or 2. Tunneling being the other one. 
---
Not that there aren't any but I rarely find Trapper camping.  Due to how fast he is and how survivors always tend to run into his trap, the amount of Trappers that camp or tunnel is actually low.  Of course, this does not include once exit doors are powered or they are entry-level Trappers (level 20-15).
---
im really glad and also really sad i know this song
---
I'd say Larys is pretty good for trapper cause of how many windows there are and cause of how easy it is to force survivors to your traps.
---
#**Not_Queen wants to know your location**
---
Spine chill is great for early warning, but not meta enough.
---
OK I'M GLAD IT WASN'T ME THEN BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE UBER TOXIC. NEXT TIME I'M ON THOUGH I NEED TO GET VIDEO OF MAGIC HATCHETS!
---
Lucky for me I was on crotus prenn asylum disturbed Ward and the basement spawned inside the killer shack. I had boil over and the wraith wouldn't give up on getting me out of there. Team did five gens and I actually managed to escape from wraith after the gates opened.
---
Correcting them? The person you were responding to literally said nothing about why people dislike SWF. 
---
You were correcting them on something they weren't talking about.
---
Too many to count.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Cakes: 200
---
Streamers/Survivor: 250
---
Puddings: 150
---
Streamers/Killer: 150
---
I dont know I think I have reached a point where I get so many points in a killer game, so I can get almost 1 new Pudding/Cake/Streamer for every one I use.
---
I usually play Killer(70%) and Im using a pudding or streamers every game, plus the extra points from BBQ you go easily out of a game with 80k bloodpoints, with that you can almost complete 2 bloodwebs and usualy you get 1 streamer/pudding in 2 webs. 
---
No no, i only ended up on the hook twice lol, mostly for being the poor bastard that finally got downed once the last gen gets fixed. Teammates were getting it every other game. Rank 1 getting reset to rank 10, they're salty as fuck when it takes the whole game to only down you once. 
---
\*claps\* GENIUS!  That'd show 'em survivors!
---
oh yeah I completely forgot that was the point lol. I really like the trapper bags carrying more traps means you have to spend less time placing a trap so you have room to get another. Wraith has an add-on that makes his bell silent. He also has one that keeps his terror radius and red stain suppressed for a few seconds after uncloaking. Put those 2 together and you can uncloak around a corner and pull people off gens if they aren't paying attention.
---
Steam, PC.  
---
Can't invite friends to "Survive with Friends."  
---
They can invite me - I see the green "join game" button.  
---
When I create a SWF game, the steam friends list pops up, shows my friends, I click invite.  
---
Instead of the big notification with a green button, they receive a notification message instead. "XXXXX has invited you to play dead by daylight" or something. In that message, there is a little tiny dead by daylight icon.  
---
Weirdly, any of them can invite me.  
---
This is really sad because my friends only sorta like the game and the fact that it's so hard to get our group into a game every single game is really tiresome and annoying.  
---
2nd bug:  
---
Game fails to load all the fucking time.  
---
Game goes "not responding" all the fucking time. (all my friends, as well, on pc)  
---
Game drops a player after an extremely long load, with my friends all exerting extreme patience to be good sports for a potential lagger - only to see that they never made it. What's the damned lag-out timer in this game... 5 minutes??  
---
Can't add players that you meet in games:  
---
Check "recently played games" button - apparently I have played with nobody.  
---
Check current game: apparently I am not in a game and neither is anyone else.  
---
Search by name: omfg haha fuck you no way.*  
---
Non bugs:
---
Also, you can't leave as a group, you have to reform the group every game. (very annoying considering only my friends can invite and me, the fan of the game, can't bite the bullet and "drive" the gameplay so they can sit back, have a drink and play without navigating menus every single game.)  
---
*for the anti-asshole mechanic, not being to search for the people in your game is probably a help, right? because you don't want trolls stream-cheating survivors or killers. but that's like 1% of assholes. the rest of us who love the game and want to see it grow, continue to get developed (better controls, oh please god/ better graphics, please sweet lord baby jesus - and no not in a sequel because a sequel of this game is going to fail) (phew long digression) want to be able to add players who play THIS game, to grow THIS game, and pull people to THIS game.  
---
Can't add anyone in Dead by Daylight: whoever approved that really buckled to pressure from the wrong source. No disrespect, and I hope you can resolve all of these issues.  
---
I won't give my system specs because no game has the issues this one has for: adding friends, inviting friends to a game, etc. Rest assured, my 1gig up and down and my raging fast system are not the issue, and I have some super highly paid nerd who is an elite pc builder and hosting operations guru with experience that makes him a fortune in any industry - any industry. His blunt opinion is that servers are being underfunded and the game something something networky jargon is also being ignored because you are gathering new purchases through streaming. That's a bad business model, in my shitty, uninformed opinion. The model that works is one where you can add people and build the micro economy (as much as it kills me to say that).
---
I'm literally correcting them as to why people hate SWF, and it's not because people play with their friends. It's not that hard to understand. 
---
They need to put this in BOLD text in the lobby or else some killers won't get this and just dodge every lobby.  Amusing as it sounds, it's not fun for the rest of the players.
---
Why the fuck do shitty, low-effort posts like this get upvotes? I don't get it. 
---
Best I could do without thinking too hard about it.
---
Ability:
---
Straight Razor: Todd‚Äôs ability to cause massive bleeding when coming into contact with a survivor.
---
Survivors cannot repair, search chests, or destroy totems until their wound is healed.
---
Perks:
---
Worst pie in London- Can injure multiple survivors in one attack. 90/ 150/ 180 degree range
---
Close Shave -  Recovery between successful attacks reduced by 1/3 - 1/2 - 2/3 second
---
What‚Äôs that smell? - Missed skill checks when repairing a generator reveal all survivors outside 60 meter range for 3/4/5 seconds
---
I dont mind NOED having the one shot, I think they should remove the movement speed bonus tho.
---
&gt;NOED has counters
---
&gt;&gt;I shouldn't have to run perks(Small Game, Detective's Hunch) just to counter my opponent's, if he doesn't have NOED than it's just a waste.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes you should, that's how balance works and you can't always prepare for every single loadout and circumstance.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But it takes too much time to cleanse totems that could otherwise be spent rushing my opponent out of the match.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, that's the entire point. It's supposed to slow matches down on average without having to keep increasing generator repair times, which nobody likes. Killers who don't even run NOED still benefit from the fact that there's others that do. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Only bad killer use NOED, it's a crutch.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can say that about anything. You know what? Good survivors don't wipe to NOED. The perk is going to activate the same way every single time, whether the killer was trash or whether they're MLG, if you didn't cleanse totems than it's going to proc. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I just think the perk is too powerful.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The killer was playing with a handicap for 95% of the match, only using three perks. You might not have even lived until NOED's activation if the killer had taken a perk that would have been relevant for the whole match. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Look I just think it's an unfun perk.
---
I think that about sums up every post that could be made in this thread, am I leaving any out?
---
I'd say that would be to face them and 4K, but whatever :/
---
A cute screaming corpse
---
You know you can‚Äôt be lazy!
---
Absolute god, thank you sir for your contribution to science
---
It looks like you traced it and then just colored it in, tbh.
---
That‚Äôs the combo I normally use when I‚Äôm playing wraith and it seems like I‚Äôll have to use the bag and the addon that resets traps (also need to grab 10 survivors for another trophy) 
---
You weren't clear if you were talking about disconnecting in the lobby before the match begins (which I assumed).
---
I'm guessing you were talking about disconnecting at the loading screen. Sorry you weren't clear.
---
&gt; Overwhelmingly trapper sided
---
&gt; Haddonfield
---
wat
---
Is this a meme though? Just seems like empirical evidence put into a tier list.
---
I have not played the trapper in a while but I use the bag and the add-on that lets you set traps really fast. When someone is looping me at a jungle gym or one of the insane window loops I drop a trap really quick. If the survivor starts to catch on you can start to fake a trap and then stop and keep chasing.
---
Never mind I get what you mean.
---
It's a matter of pride and satisfaction on the Killer's part. Killing survivors by hand fills us with unabashed delight, particularly when used against toxic survivors. 
---
Besides, I don't tunnel off hook unless the exits are powered, even with an Ebony Memento Mori. It's a mechanism I view as a means to remove a survivor from the trial as quickly as possible, which is particularly important if I lose my Ruin early on. Also, need I mention Dying Light? 
---
The game is bad for the trapper because all locations have a good line of sight, most decent survivors would just disable the trap they saw across 2 tiles. 
---
...Michael's house. Six traps, and it's completely impregnable. 
---
Fam.
---
Wasting 6 traps on one house isnt the best idea. Trapper plays better on it, but its still Haddonfield.
---
If it isn't too much of a hassle, what would his add-ons be
---
It's all good--I understand the need to lobby dodge in some situations. I'm not masochistic enough to deal with an SWF P3 Quadette, either. 
---
Well... unless I'm bringing Franklin's and an Ebony. 
---
Now look at this bear trap, that I just found.
---
They were #1, HEY!
---
Fucking Nea got me u/Siberlily
---
Didn‚Äôt t-bag though.
---
He certainly performs better than anyone else, though. If you don't mind my asking, which map do you think is his best? 
---
Nea stuns hag at badham preshool (2018)
---
I'm hearing so many wild scenarios and complaints on this subreddit that baffle me to listen to, they only crop up when complaining about NOED but for other hex totems the joke is always how quickly totems get taken.
---
I sense some anger behind those words bro typical survivor main üòÇ
---
Facing Trapper on the Swamp is the worst.  JFC,  I can't even see what's in front of me sometimes let alone having to make sure I don't run into a trap.
---
Sit yo ass down, Sportacus!
---
Not everybody need to flip all the damn time.
---
Could you imagine working fast food and turning somersaults while checking the fries?
---
Floor slick as hell, you bust your shit and send hot ass oil cascading down on everybody like they're an invading army of cossacks hellbent on breaching your castle.
---
I look a little like him. And I'm pretty sure in 3 to 5 years, I'll fully look like him
---
I reinstalled steam, reinstalled game and checked game files. 
---
Hillybilly might be a serial killer, but if you farm me for a WGLF stack you are the real monster.
---
Noed is good fun, but it's not even the only perk that exposes Survivors. I seem to get a lot more mileage out of Make Your Choice anyway. 
---
Here's what pisses me off. As a survivor, killers are extremely toxic too. Difference is, we have literally no say in what we play against. Toxicity? It's part of the game if you're a survivor and you gotta deal with it. Why should killers be given a free pass? 
---
I get hard camped and mori'd at least once every 5 games or so and am denied any opportunity to play the game. Killers slug me while shaking their head as they watch me bleed out. I have clowns repeatedly stomp my head in for 5 minutes rather than just letting the mori animation complete. Unless I DC, I have to finish the round anyways. This game in general is about making the other side miserable and if you wanna use the "killers want to have fun" argument, you have to apply it to survivors too. 
---
did you not see where the red stain was?
---
He is upset because he failed to secure a kill. 
---
Simple as that. 
---
I did this and it says that everything is fine. 
---
You can't do that too preemptively in my experience. They really always check for that one because they love to abuse that loop as much as possible. You can, however, run Iridescent Stone and place one there whenever. They'll take that vault, thinking it's disarmed, and boom. 
---
Unhook

Pallet save

---
Thought so too. Its a simple thing but I just noticed that today and laughed so hard. I figured it cant be too wrong to post it 1 more time 
---
Thank you!
---
That was quite the imagery. Thank you very much for taking me on that journey
---
Agreed! I'm a Huntress main as well which is why I chose her mask for the art‚ô°
---
You can do your part and downvote it. Everyone has their own opinion, you know.
---
Doesnt matter, its very easy to find out of you play against a swf even if from now on theyll always appear at the same time. Not that this was very realiable in the first place, ive got plenty of games with the lobby filling up at once but them coordinating so poorly that there was no way they were swf.
---
I originally wanted a hatchet and an ebony mori but my tech told me it'd be too much as to how skinny my nails are
---
Since I loved this show character concepts!
---
Robbie Rotten:
---
*Weapon*: **Broken Saxaphone** - The bell broke off long ago, making it more suitable to bludgeon survivors.
---
**Power**: *Rotten Plan*
---
Years of constructing and perfecting your tubing system has enabled you to traverse the map quickly. On each map, *Rotten Tubes* will appear around the map. Every time your power is charged, you will be able to enter one of these tubes to appear at another location across the map. Tubes that match in color (will also have a symbol for the colorblind), are connected and will always transport to one another when used.
---
*"Yeah, now to put my rotten plan in effect." - Robbie Rotten*
---
*Perk #1*: **Hard Work Does Not Pay** - upon generator completion, if there was more than one survivor working on the generator, those survivors become **Exposed** for *4/8/12* seconds.
---
*"Now why don't you sit quietly and do nothing like a good little girl?" - Robbie Rotten*
---
*Perk #2*: **Life Isn't Fair** - after being in a chase with a survivor for 20/15/10 seconds, when a survivor vaults a window, they are **Exhausted/Injured/Broken** for *3/6/9* seconds.
---
*"This will be as easy as stealing candy from a baby, and I should know." - Robbie Rotten* 
---
*Perk #3*: **We Are Number One** - Upon hooking a survivor, you drop your regular terror radius to a terror radius of *16/8/0* meters. Survivors who are attacked while the reduced terror radius are *Mangled* *until healed/until healed by a teammate/indefinitely.*
---
*"We are number one!" - Robbie Rotten*
---
Also, a single Stephanie perk I came up with:
---
**Flexibility Rules** - Being small and flexible has it's advantages. Every *40/30/20 seconds*, you can move through small gaps across the map. (i.e Fat-shamming rocks/trees, gaps that look like survivors can go through but can't)
---
Ik these perks are busted, it's just for fun!
---
Oh boy, another NOED is bad post. Still need two more to get our daily quota
---
And to play as. Freddy and legion both need reworks.
---
It‚Äôs still going to be there lol, Red Forest just has two variations now. Like Autohaven, MacMillan Estate, and Coldwind all have 5. Simple.
---
ToP is just another variant of Red Forest. 
---
Mothers Dwelling is still there. 
---
They be clickin that mf add friend button like they life on the line üòÇ
---
You lose bloodpoints in your chaser emblem for being in proximity of a hooked survivor

Over here making the REAL charts we needed.
---
Spine chill is 99% useless unless you don‚Äôt have eyes
---
The thing is I‚Äôm not even a killer main. I play both sides equally and have been playing way more survivor lately because I‚Äôm getting tired of playing the moving slideshow that is killer. So like I said I know what it‚Äôs like to be dodged in solo and SWF, but as killer that‚Äôs not my problem. But this game leads both sides to be inherently selfish and as killer your wait times are not my problem. BHVR should fix their shit. On days where I‚Äôm having a longer play session I really won‚Äôt care and I‚Äôll pretty much play whatever, but if I‚Äôm only on for a short period of time I‚Äôm probably going to try and find myself the fairest matches possible. 
---
Believe me if I wanted easier games and didn‚Äôt want a challenge I would derank to 14 constantly and play nothing but instasaw ruin billy to steamroll every survivor I see. But instead I just rank up, play damn near every killer and instead of having a SWF destroy me when I‚Äôm trying to fuck around with trapper I just dodge to get a game I‚Äôll actually have a chance to have fun in. I don‚Äôt necessarily need to ‚Äúwin.‚Äù I don‚Äôt care to slug for a 4K. I just play for the fun and running into a rare sweaty SWF with a killer that‚Äôs not billy, spirit, or nurse (on PC at least) is incredibly unfun and sometimes having to be super sweaty to go against them is also unfun. 
---
Like 90% of the "killer mains" hard arguing survivor opinions. Its honestly pathetic, why would you do that? Do they think BHVR screen this sub and note the number of killers complaining a point and then change that? 
---
Still looks better than remake Freddy.
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt like seeing my boy David get shanked 8 times in the back because he has his shirt off
---
They used too many big brains on nerfing DS
---
Now that they got that flushing down the pipeline maybe they'll him some love

"It's an optimisation pass."
---
A month or so ago the bug was still going around where Wraith with Sloppy Butcher would make you shoot blood like fireworks. Was always fun watching David shoot blood out of his shirtless back and armpits
---
Let's be perfectly honest about the state of Dead By Daylight; it's an unbalanced pile of shit with a bunch of anti-content and toxic shitheads that is occasionally fun when the stars align, and we all stick with it hoping to find the moments when the stars align.

Take Legion, for example. He's a prime example of "anti-content." He counters everything survivors do in a chase. You can't loop him because he's way faster than you and he vaults shit like you do. You can't juke him because he has zero attack recovery and he can just spam it until he hits you. Win or lose, survivors will *not* have fun against Legion. Playing against Legion is just one of the many ways DBD asks you to pay the "shitty game tax" - you do it because DC'ing is rude to the other players and then you hope RNG will be kinder and give you a fun game next time. But so many games are shit, DBD's shitty game tax is way too fucking high, so people just start DC'ing so they can skip the bullshit and get back to rolling the dice for a better game. And I don't really blame them. I blame the devs for not fixing the fucking game.
---
And yeah, green/red mori's are unbalanced as absolute fuck. A green mori skips an entire chase and hook - up to two health states. A red mori skips an entire chase and hook per survivor - up to six health states (skipping the last survivor's extra hook doesn't really matter, if they're the last they're dead anyway). Imagine how bullshit it is when survivors bring two instaheals. That's a green mori. Imagine how bullshit it would be if survivors could bring six instaheals. That's a red mori.

---
&gt; So be sure to make your profiles private!
---
4 private profiles? Dodge.
---
Just wanna say Alert is severely underrated.
---
2 no skill perks that bad killers have to use
---
The same thing that happened to Crotus Prenn Asylum when Father's Campbell's Chapel dropped with Clown? Nothing... 
---
I legit laughed at this shit for like 5 fucking minutes, great work dude 
---
There needs to be more shirtless characters 
---
As a killer, you host the lobby in DBD, so to lobby dodge is to leave the game/lobby and make a new lobby. People usually do this to avoid survivors they don't want to play against, but I was just making a joke.
---
That would be super cool~
---
Alert is a lot better than dark sense. You can also use premonition.
---
If you use Lithe, it is good to combo with "Dance with me". That perk saved me a lot of times.
---
He but he couldn‚Äôt heal. Like the down player stayed down forever
---
Right. 
---
If you‚Äôre on the ground, you can only recover to 95%. You need a perk to fully recover yourself. 
---
So I can just leave people on the ground and run off? 
---
Anecdotally.
---
I've rarely ever seen people run Object of Obsession, let alone more than one a match. I feel it's underrated, personally, but eh, that's just me 
---
It's actually VERY similar, hair with exotic color, "Stunning" the Killer with a pallet... She even has a flashlight!
---
I want the next DLC to be lazy town inspired now.
---
Yeah. 
---
It‚Äôs called slugging. 
---
Their teammates have to come heal them if the downed player doesn‚Äôt have the perk. 
---
Can their teammates see where they are when they are downed?
---
Yep
---
Unless the killer has a certain perk. 
---
Its like a constant Sprint Burst, but if its set too high it can look like teleporting/lagging
---
But its pretty rare and you most likely encountered a lagging person
---
What‚Äôs that perk? 
---
It‚Äôs called Knock Out. 
---
It reduces the range you can see the downed player. Like you have to be within X meters to see them. 
---
Well, do so if you have Scratched Mirror 
---
Technically 2k is a draw. 3-4k would be considered a killer win and 0-1 kills would be a killer loss. Thats what the devs want to achieve in terms of balance and mentioned several times.
---
And thats before factoring BP gain and emblem progress everyone got in the match.
---
Wait, but those perks...
---
It‚Äôs called no perks no add ons /s
---
Just experimenting with perks.
---
Yes, it is a Kate perk. After you perform a fast vault, you leave no scrath marks for 3 seconds.
---
URBAN 'MERSION 
---
Nurse, BBQ, Ruin and Whispers is the standard meta however if you wanna change things up you could swap Nurses Calling and Whispers for Endurance and Spirit Fury. Survivors see a Huntress and often expect her to respect pallets in favor of hatcheting them so it can be a terrible shock when you just bulldogs right through them. 
---
But if he tilts his head to his left, he should be moved into the 'right' category, because the killers' heads in there are bent to their left.
---
Killer: There you are, useless little fish. 
---
Mmm, mm!

It's a joke that since Bill is in DBD, DBD *IS* L4D3

~~But I want L4D3 too~~
---
In the Whitt‚Äôs eyes this was a happy little accident it makes survivors suffer more which is exactly what the entity wants
---
Essentially it‚Äôs attempt to gain another killer to serve it went horribly right just not in the way it was planning 
---
The killer's perks and add ons are revealed at the end of the match. I didn't know that until recently :0
---
[Shame](https://i.imgur.com/ds4Mzis.gif)
---
So 5 gens done, almost every one of the 3 of you hooked twice, nobody tunneled or facecamped, plenty of chasing too.
---
I would imagine you all pipped and got quite a fair amount of points, no?
---
Ever think of cleansing totems or not getting hit?
---
Lmao
---
Here, we see an immersed Claudette in its native environment. Let's hit it with a stick and chase it off. 
---
Exactly right. I know survivors can be toxic little shits when they want, but the majority of face camping incidents I see are simply killers getting mad at survivors who dare to stay alive longer than ten seconds.
---
Just last night I was face camped by a doctor because I dodged his zap then pallet stunned him (he hooked me then nodded up and down furiously in my face). After the match me and my fellow survivors said 'gg' and nothing else. He said: 'toxic piece of shit Gearbuster'. Gee who's toxic now?
---
As a survivor you get morid you go to the next game... When your a killer and survivors are being toxic you either leave and get no point or you deal with the toxicity... Big difference
---
I swear I didn‚Äôt take any of this when writing mine, but I do find it cool that our perks were named the same.
---
Oh shit. For real? Ima have to wait for that to be in the Shrine or just buy Kate.
---
‚ÄúNot getting hit‚Äù
---
Make sure windows is not doing a download.

Go to [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) and make sure your internet speed and ping is acceptable.

Let's go from there!

The hacker known as 4chan??
---
Bing bong my ding dong!
---
Thank you. I'm very sick of it, too. I think my Trapper has a vast assortment of sharp objects stuck into his back because of this perk. Sewing Needles, Shards of glass, bits of iron that he didn't stick in himself, you get the picture. 
---
Can a downed player not a hook actually fully die?
---
You can recover when downed, but someone else has to heal you to get you back up. Unless you have a special perk. 
---
&gt;Gen rushing, sabo hooks, flashlight saves, body blocking hooks, hiding.
---
None of these are toxic. 
---
Chaining builds: If you play survivor, your next game is as killer with the last killer's build. If you play killer, you then play the least competent survivor's build. Should at least keep things different and occasionally make you run something weird.
---
I reinstalled two times and nothing. :C i tried it on different comp and its working fine so its something with comp :/
---
This sub is extra killer sided, you won't find any survivor support here :c
---
It's not about disagreeing.  You're asserting something (the statement I quoted) factually.  
---
Feel free to back up statement because no one gives a flip about your anecdotes.  No one in this thread even understands the topic so I know it's asking a lot.
---
On my end I mostly do no-kill farming games on Huntress (BBQ, Beast of Prey, Distressing, Ruin) and just hooking everyone 2x and letting them leave I get between 30-60k without stressing too much. Combine that with the fact that I actually enjoy her and am okay with not using any addons and I never feel like I NEED to spend the points, though I usually do anyway just because I don't have every teachable unlocked yet. So pretty much just find a killer you like without addons and enjoy some laid back games
---
I‚Äôm begging you please do this.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Also an idea i had but im not sure how well that would work with the games match making system right now. Some people claim lobbies take seconds to fill up while other take up to an hour,by separating a portion, a significant portion at that, how badly would it affect que times.
---
Perhaps if you bothered to 'finish' reading my post before clicking reply the second you saw that line....

Damn dude, he‚Äôs not SHAGGY

&gt; It's not about disagreeing. You're asserting something (the statement I quoted) factually.
---
I asserted it with the most confidence you can have where the only source you'll be able to find is anecdotal. You'll be waiting a long time if you want a definite answer on how many people are toxic, because it's impossible to measure.
---
&gt; Feel free to back up statement because no one gives a flip about your anecdotes.
---
Then stop replying to me.
---
&gt; No one in this thread even understands the topic so I know it's asking a lot.

No one here understands toxicity? Nobody here understands what it's like to play DBD with SWF or against it? No? The forum specifically for talking about the game? None of us know anything compared to you?
---
My bad.
---
Iron Maiden is handy to have    
---
Also if you‚Äôre gonna run a Hex you might as well just run Ruin
---
Dear god this matchmaking is bad, like it was the other week when matchmaking was seemingly removed. Getting awful pings, awful Non-SWF rank variance ranging from legitimate rank 19-20s to red ranks within one match. I know people say they'd rather have shorter waits but I'm feeling legitimately bad bullying all these legitimately new survivors/killers. I doubt they're having a good time either.
---
I know where this is from.
---
Jordan levine is hot
---
Yeah thats true. I dont think it should affect ds or head on. It was a dumb decision because its not a 4 second stun. Its a normal stun for wiggling out. It gives no time to run away. 
---
80% of the lobbies I joined were 150+ ping, prior it was quite rare, most sat around 110. Don't know what happened but it may need tuning
---
Good point
---
Still it would be a fitting punishment and the potential whining they would make on this reddit would be fun to read
---
The only physically active man around who could be twisted by the Entity into doing its dire deeds. Sportacus. With his acrobatic capabilities and unending stamina, he's a perfect being to mold into a killer. Imagine Legion but cooler and also more fun while bringing motion sickness as you flip around fucking everywhere.

As the Spirit, I want to customize my terror radius with the grudge noise.
---
Meh, different things affect people differently. I have a personality disorder and can't help it. Doesn't give you or anyone else good reason to make people feel like shit.
---
The point being made is that you have nothing to prove to them. It's like if a group of kids at school all mock you and bully you and try to get you to do something so they can try and humiliate you by 'beating' you.
---
Instead of giving them what they want and feeding their egos, you simply ignore them and leave.
---
That pisses them off more than anything. 
---
They aren't worth your time.
---
It's the same concept here. Instead of giving toxic survivor groups a chance to be toxic, you simply ignore them and leave and let them fume over it.
---
Who says they're dodging because of you?  People are awfully full of themselves here saying people dodge because of them 
---
Nah man, for special redneck family occasions you got to pull out that homemade Chili. 
---
Scrub at looping here; if I get found first I'm going down in 30 seconds. I rely on you loop gods to keep the killer interested as I gen jockey.
---
Only read the title, didn't have time for the description, but if you're trying to hit on the Nurse then whatever you do don't mention how much she takes your breath away, it seems like a funny joke but she gets kinda bent out of shape about it and really sours the mood. Just treat her nice, keep it clean.
---
Assuming you are suggesting I‚Äôm a survivor main trying to claim ima killer main, I‚Äôll reply. I play about 60/40 with the 60 being killer. I use to play more survivor but that changed around 9 months ago. 
---
Anyways, I‚Äôm merely defending points that I believe are better for the overall health of the game, I don‚Äôt want either side to be stronger than the other to a point it isn‚Äôt healthy and many of the current issues with the game I feel affect survivors more than killer. I defend points from both sides quite often. 
---
I'd say Yamako estate should be moved up to Generally trapper sided, setting up all your traps on the grassy side of the map in pathways can hard shut down a team.
---
Bruh this ain‚Äôt no REPOST. OG meme
---
If you've been playing nurse for over a month and you still didn't get her down completely I would recommend to just stop trying.
---
She takes 30 hours to learn, not 730.

I don‚Äôt see why not the entity detached to reality except collecting people

No one said I exclusively play her or this game but congrats on such a fine comment.
---
I had an idea for a futuristic killer that would be a reference to the predator and t 1000 from terminator essentially it‚Äôs a killer that can disguise themselves as a survivor and can use invisibility so it has something to fall back on should they face a swf
---
Made a backstory for it too
---
I feel like Legacy has become a curse for anyone who was un/fortunate to get it. 
---
On one hand it looks pretty cook, on the other hand you get judged HARD if you aren't playing perfectly/get dodged constantly.
---
I always start my lobbies by ready-ing up instantly and waiting for survivors to come in, it's funny to watch then switch from some no cosmetic meg to legacy n stuff. It's ridiculous that people actually dodge those.
---
I am so tired of this meme over and over again....
---
Just an immature player far too many of those. Luckily I play on console so they have to personally message me and these types don‚Äôt bother manually doing so
---
The devs need to post this on the in game news with this highlighted so all the DC‚Äôing noobs quit dodging lobbies! Had several tonight because they think we are SWF when I‚Äôm running solo...

---

---
Ok. So let's take examples shall we? If I'm on survivor's side and my buddy who is on voice comms with me drops a pallet and it breaks immediately we know the killer is running spirit fury and they will relay it to the rest of the team and assuming they know how to play they will drop pallets early. This makes enduring and spirit fury more or less only good for reducing the time to loop though you never get to use the spirit fury effect ever again nor enduring. 
---
If you run any hex perk and somebody finds the totem you now know where the totem is so ruin will break fast rather than the killer being able to chase away and hook the guy who found ruin and everybody else having to spend time finding it or working through it. This goes for multiple hex perks and counts NOED with groups being able to tell each other how many totems have been cleansed.
---
The whole group knows where generators are because they have 4 people who can tell each other where they are and can avoid 3 Genning themselves.
---
You can tell each group member which pallets have and have not been used. This makes looping more efficient without the guesswork of which pallets have been used and extends chases.
---
Healing is much easier as you dont have to search for other survivors and they can tell you where they are.
---
The whole group knows where the killer is and who it is from the start of the game even though it may not be a killer who makes a ton of noise like Billy or nurse. Additionally knowing when the killer leaves chase or is committing to a chase makes it easy to know when you have to keep working on a gen or when to move. They also know what add ons the killer is using to some extent depending on if the add ons have an effect that's fairly obvious like wraith having no bing bong noise. 
---
Adrenaline becomes far more effective because you can time the last generator complete to save an ally rather than it popping whenever a teammate randomly decides to complete the last gen .
---
And I'm sure there are others but the long and short of it is that survivors get a lot of benefits that you normally would have to perk into in order to receive simply by being on comms.

Thrill working with dull totems might work, but then use that with NOED and you get a very powerful build with only 2 perks

Sometimes it‚Äôs just bad luck. I‚Äôve had games where I spawned about 10 yards from the killer and they spotted me immediately. Not much I can do if I‚Äôm out in the open with no pallets and the killer is on me in 2 seconds.

Its the dying state and you need either no mither or unbreakabill to get up. I'm fairly certain the tutorial covers this. Play the tutorial.

Aw, I'm on PC bb. &lt; / 3 :c 
---
Ty tho.
---
K: Ruin, BBQ, Sloppy, Enduring, Spirit Fury (only with enduring), are the most common picks
---
S: DS is getting changed soon, SB has heavily fallen out of favor due to exhaustion not recovering while running. People instead opt for dead hard usually, sometimes balanced landing and then of course sometimes Lithe. Self Care has also fallen out of meta a bit since healing takes longer now. People either throw on bond and/or adrenaline or just deal with being injured. I personally do the latter and use Iron Will so I'm a bit less vulnerable.
---
Obvi I play more survivor so I have a bit more insight on it vs killer
---
Putting in for not sportsmanship doesn‚Äôt really do anything that I have seen
---
Btw you can report them on the dbd page whit proves and they may be the ones that get reported.
---
I used to care about rank but with this change I'm inclined more than ever to just ignore the ranking system entirely
---
careful with that there common sense 'round these parts, people are afraid of hearing the truth.
---
I can be reported daily and I do not know, it's much healthier for me
---
Not if everyone is rank 15-20! 
---
Ehhh, just my two cents but I don't think it would affect hex perks too much (Except for NO ED, but fck that perk in solo surv). It's not like a totem counter would show people where the totems are, and if somebody sees a lit totem, they gonna get it regardless. 
---
The last guy was adam i guess he was going for the adept trophy just had adam perks

&gt;4/5 of the lobbies is a killer with 300 ms or higher. (This issue can be solved with the dedicated servers).
---
No, it cannot.
---
Ping is the roundtrip travel time between two machines. It is realistically impossible for adding a third machine between the two machines to decrease that travel time. The best case scenario is that the third machine is already on the shortest path between the first and second machines, in which case it has no effect on ping. The worst case scenario is that the third machine isn't on the shortest path between the first and second machines, and you have to add network segments to include it, and it increases ping.
---
As far as I can tell, there are two common misconceptions that make people believe dedicated servers will decrease ping:
---
1) "Lag happens because the killer's computer is a toaster that can't handle running the server."
---
No. That is not where lag comes from. DBD netcode is not CPU bottlenecked. Basically no modern videogame would ever be CPU bottlenecked in a multiplayer context except possibly shit like Minecraft, which has an enormous amount of state. Lag comes from DBD's central matchmaking server deciding that people in Australia (or whatever) should be put in games with people from Brazil (or whatever).
---
The central matchmaking algorithm either estimates ping really poorly, or it puts too much weight on minimizing wait time and not enough on minimizing ping, or it's just really sloppily implemented, and it ends up putting people who have no business playing against one another into the same lobby. And dedicated servers won't fix that, because Brazilians sure as fuck don't want to be playing on Australian dedicated servers or vice versa.
---
2) "My ping is lower in games with dedicated servers, so dedicated servers have to reduce ping."
---
No. If Alice and Bob both have 50 ping to the dedicated server, then the effective ping between Alice and Bob is 100. It would take 100ms for a message to travel Alice&lt;-&gt;Server&lt;-&gt;Bob and back (ping is measured roundtrip). When Alice shoots Bob in the face, Bob learns that he was shot in the face [(1/2)(50)+(1/2)(50)] 50ms later. But DBD doesn't have a dedicated server, Alice is the server, so it just tells Bob that his ping to Alice is 100. And when Alice smacks Bob with her hammer, Bob learns that he was smacked [(1/2)(100)] 50ms later. Same thing.
---
This is why I average ~50 ping in CS:GO and ~100 ping in DBD. Because it's the same damn connection performing equally well, but one is measuring my half of the path to a central node acting as the dedicated server, and one is measuring my full path to another player. Not because my DBD ping is twice as bad as my CSGO ping. DBD measures the full trip to another player, CSGO doesn't, so my DBD ping is a bigger even when the connection is just as good.

Doesn't small game act as a totem counter?
---
Yeah. And I just finished a game where 1 person escaped because I brought NOED as an end game crutch because I'm absolute trash at nurse and learning. They got angry because they knew I had NOED and they just refused to open the other door I wasnt at, and instead saved the dude on the hook right after I hooked him. Instead of 3 getting out, only one did.
---
While I agree with you, my 'favorite' part is on the flipside.  When they crush generators like a beer cans at a BBQ- and then curse out the killer the tunnel/soft camp/bait unsafe unhooks just to get anywhere near breaking even with one gen left/gates powered.  Like, what'd they expect?
---
Lol. I'm good. They'll get what's coming to them eventually.
---
It's more like complaining about mori, camping, tunneling, head nodding, and noed, but yeah. Totally agree.
---
lord have mercy.   sometimes y'all really reaching for any fucking excuse to post.

Yeah, I wanted to have perks that have counterplay, otherwise it's busted just to be busted.

Hard Work is a hard punish for team gen fixing, but can be easily prevented from triggering.

Life Isn't Fair would be king on Lery's, but garbage on maps with less windows like say the game.

We Are Number One is more of a snowball/game stall perk. Countered by opening your eyeballs. (I just realized I don't have a duration for it.)
---
Thats hiding from bbq
---
This kind of shit is what turns away new players. I would've quit the game at about 30ish hours in if I hadn't bought some of the DLC
---
"Third party programs" makes it sound like a big deal, but you can't expect people not to use discord. Everyone uses discord. People didn't recently decide to start using coms just to shit on killers in DBD. Honestly what are they supposed to do, say "hey guys, want to get on DBD. Hold on let me just get off discord so we can't accidentally share any valuable information and put the killer at a disadvantage." My sister and her boyfriend play this game together, often in the same room. What are they supposed to do, put on blinders and construct a sound proof wall between them?
---
  
---
I understand that coms are a huge problem for balance in DBD, but that's something for the devs to address, not the survivor population. The obvious solution is that the game needs to implement some type of information sharing system for survivors and be re-balanced around that, because hell will freeze over before people stop using coms.
---
I found [this](https://isthereanydeal.com/game/deadbydaylight/info/) handy dansy site to search across the web for deals
---
Lucky for you I linked it to someone on discord at some point, sorry I'm not sure who OP was so credits to them https://i.redd.it/37yi87lpwwk21.png
---
I also cannot take credit for this clip, a friend of mine had posted this on Facebook and I just had to share it, I couldn't stop laughing. 
---
I've watched this so many times by now lmao
---
    *literally dying*
---
That will happend often, idk why, but sometimes when you hang a survivors all the rest came running at the same time to unhook him and die 
---
I want one
---
He really honestly does.  I have two reply‚Äôs. 
---
1) what if he is impotent and can‚Äôt understand what jake is doing. 
---
2)Everyone fawns over daddy Michael but he is just confused about what the fuss is about. He doesn‚Äôt understand why some run and hide and others seem like deer froze in headlights as they gaze in lustful wonder. 
---
I got called out for "tunneling" a survivor. Both gates open, 1 dead, 2 healthy, 1 on 2nd hook. They get him off the hook, I meet them halfway between hook and closest gate, hit injured guy, hook him again, other two escape.  
---
"tunneling noob"  
---
Other two survivors didn't block for him either, I would've said something about that before accusing killer of tunneling.  
---
Like, why would I go for the healthy survivors running to the gate over the injured one who is dead on hook? Having 2 dead and two escaped was my better situation, I'm not gonna give you a win because you'll call me out at the post game bitching.
---
You must not have seen the guide. There are certain spots that have NOED pretty much preassigned meaning if a totem spawns in the spot in the guide, the killer has NOED. Now, I don't know the validity of the guide but it's pretty of the guide but it's proven itself. NOED always spawned where it said it would.
---
I used to be angry all the time bc always a bad loser write me bullshit, but not any more.
---
I mean, I'm not a pro, and you have to learn to play and recognize the important of the points, but that require time and practice. It's not the killer fault that the only target practice are real survivors..
---
Any way, the only bad thing is that if you block all communications you also block any communication whit randoms in other games, but can always change it back.
---
Or "I play Leatherface so I must also use Insidious" 
---
Slugging is a viable strategy to slow the game down, it‚Äôs not like facecamping or tunneling because it actually takes skill, when a killer is slugging he needs to constantly apply pressure across the map and find survivors quickly.
---
As long as all survivors are seperated from each other, slugging won‚Äôt work. If you lose to someone who is slugging it‚Äôs your own fault because there are so many counters to it.
---
And about insta chainsaw, if survivors can bring their best loadout every match, why can‚Äôt the killer? It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúWow you didn‚Äôt have to bring 4 decisive strikes‚Äù
---
I can assure you, as someone who has played up to rank 1 as both killer and survivor, it most certainly does counter many setups. Good players will relay tons of useful, game-saving information. One object of obsession player in a SWF can counter the entire killer 'wraith.' How many sneak attacks will you get against a SWF as pig or myers. Once one of them sees you, they all know who you are. It becomes much more difficult to tier up as myers, or get that first down on pig or wraith. Having a way to let your team know that the leatherface is running insidious can save a whole game.  
---
As for perks, it doesn't really have to be a 'hard' counter to throw a game. Losing a single early chase can cost you the game on killer. Knowing that the killer had bamboozle, spirit fury, enduring, or make your choice has saved me from getting downed because of them. 
---
we're all stuck in za warudo lobbies
---
Just check their steam profiles lol
---
Just when I thought tier lists can‚Äôt get any better
---
Can't lie, that letter opener is one of my favorite weapons (referring to Santa clowns knife)
---
100% agree. I don‚Äôt think it should work on a sneaking pig either. 
---
This is where all the reports go [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_container)
---
Sucks to be a dipshit who cares so much about winning.
---
The survivor or killer?
---
Both, both of these people need a fucking life.
---
i second this
---
Balanced landing is the weirdest exhaustion perk. It's sometimes useless(shelter woods) but it's insanely strong on a lot of maps but the best is without a doubt the piece of shit known as Haddonfield. Balanced landing literally gives you infinites in that map
---
He'd have an obsession based perk for sure.
---
For killers: ruin, bbq, enduring, nurse's, sloppy
---
For survivors: ds, sprint burst(or balanced landing), adrenaline and borrowed time
---
[gasp](https://i.redd.it/0i21ur4fl1x11.png)
---
Yes
---
Yeah they'll bleed out, but that's not generally what you're going for. Slugs slow the game down and a 4slug means you can then hook everyone for free.
---
I always wondered how a pallet stun would look like in real life. And now I know because of Lazy Town.
---
Most survivors point against slugging isn't that its jot a viable strategy, (because it is) but that it's a boring playstyle. The game about hiding and running from the killer because a waiting simulator, you sit there, look at your recover bar and wait. Nothing you can do but crawl. Sooo boring. It just ruins the whole game and youre powerless

True that, he would have 105% movement speed but he would only get overcharge sized skillchecks to piss off other survivors üòÇ
---
You are mostly right about that, just smaller chances in my experience due to being only 1 alive vs 4, killer location and urgency. You also didn't have the time to crawl away from a hook cluster. 
---
Maybe other guy was correct and when 4 are slugged it should end the game as well, but i don't think so. It will promote a bad gameplay.
---
From what i understand you want to have a chance at escaping if you are last alive and first time on hook. 
---
I consider it bad gameplay if you haven't been hooked once when all others are dead. 3 lives and you couldn't give one up to at least be 2 alive.
---
Consider it like hearthstone health. Your life is a resource to use.

wow you say gg to that and I get banned for saying cunt?

I hate playing against Leatherface because I‚Äôve seen so many that Insidious basement camp that I always assume it‚Äôs not going to be a fun game when I‚Äôm playing against him. I also don‚Äôt really like Hag because her traps always give me a small heart attack. Although I will admit her lettuce skin is hilarious. 
---
Just move out of the way. What.
---
Nah look at his add-ons and offering. He played Dr on his strongest match, kinda hard not to 4k when you are trying to make the match that one sided.
---
Noed is homosexual ?
---
A prime demonstration of how op tandem LT walls on suffocation pit is OP against first time killers who have no fucking idea how to chase survivors at all

Yaaaaas Claudette motorboat those clown balls. 
---
I like how he thinks flashlights are op, but was fine with sending you to The Game as the Doc with an iri add on. Honestly.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main because of facing too many toxic SWF groups in the past. Call me a pussy or whatever, but it ruins the game completely for me and I want to play games to relax and have fun - not get angry. I recently started playing killer again and was enjoying it because I could tell when all 4 survivors were solo, so I wasn‚Äôt stressed going into the game. This... Well, I guess I won‚Äôt be playing killer anymore again.
---
^ This
---
And yes your life is worth those stacks AND I run borrowed time, so run 
---
It's still the just Doctor though. A low tier Killer as his power doesn't do much against anyone skilled. Besides that, it doesn't change the fact that he still had to do a LOT of chases, hits, hooks, and shocks to earn 27k BP.
---
You can't earn those points if you are stuck in place face camping all game.
---
That is one beautiful camel, aren‚Äôt they usually brown ?
---
Now that‚Äôs a survivor main 
---
I run unbreakable. Slug me and i will just get up when you leave
---
It's true, Freddy may not be able to make a lot of kills but his capacity to slow the game down (even more with perks, just imagine Freddy with Hex: Ruins, Overcharge, the new killer's perk that block 3 random gens on the map plus... I don't know something else like Barbecue and Chili or whatever...) can easily give him enough time to make 1 or 2 kills wich is already a decent amount of blood points if you had the passive farming of looking for survivors, chasing them etc...
---
what is, wrong with it,
---
Mom! He‚Äôs doing it again! 
---
It does interrupt it, but if they were full health the hit just injures them and then they can attempt again while you wipe your blade. You should 100% be able to hit one of them after you wipe and are 100% guarenteed a down if you aim for the unhookER because they cant possibly move in time, dont have I-frames like the hooked person does, and wont have Borrowed Time.
---
Not really.
---
The 1 rule I have: Bad players die. Everyone who has the audacity to camp pallets or drop a god-pallet when not needed to will not leave the trial.

Well for the most part I try to even out the punishment but sometimes I award good players. Like for example if a survivor is of the same chapter I may spare them (doesn‚Äôt apply to Laurie and Myers) or if they are wearing something utterly ridiculous that made me chuckle I‚Äôll let them go (Daddy Ace). I mean I‚Äôm a pretty basic killer main. If I see a good Claudette that somewhat ran me around I kill them but if an Ace or David does it they boosted the shit out of getting the hatch. Also if you point at me or teabag there is no hope, unless I‚Äôm playing Nurse. By then I expect to be made fun of, even if I mange the 4k. Btw I‚Äôm on console.
---
Yeah she came out great. My Frank is still my favourite
---
Me and other two friends had to wait like 20/30 minutes to find a match, yesterday it was less than 5 minutes, let's hope for the best.
---
aaaHhhh
---
I had Mori‚Äôd some female streamer and her 3 friends as Nurse, I got a majority of them in the basement and killed her in front of somebody else dying on the hook.
---
She clipped it and posted the YouTube link on my profile, thought it was pretty nice. I find most Twitch streamers are purposefully toxic/bad mannered because it‚Äôs entertaining for viewers, but they were all pretty good sports.

Okay so maybe it was a glitch but i clear as day hit the unhooker and it didn‚Äôt cancel. But I didn‚Äôt know about the tapping m1 to unhook I‚Äôll try that next time.

Ew. He is wearing the Curse of Michael Myers mask.
---
I know you're pain as a Dwight main with pizza. ;-;

Are you female? Assuming so due to your flair:)
---
I‚Äôm trying out Kate (cowgirl) and people seem to ignore her more than they did Feng. 
---
I couldn‚Äôt handle that! The loud generator sounds and screaming would bother me too much.
---
Being in that situation changes a man. You see a survivor rushing you with the killer on them and all you can think is "NO DON'T LET DAVID GET ME! STOP HIM!"
---
Just down vote, they are tired and some are even bad at making a tier list for the joke they are making. 
---
They are definitely trying to be irritating at that point! It would be bad if that had a body double though (same model, clothes, hair) and you got the wrong one! I played with an identical Kate who was teabagging. Later I got hooked and the killer slashed me repeatedly and watched until I died - I think he thought I was the one who teabagged him? I watched the rest of the trial and the teabagger got away and then did it again at the exit!
---
This is probably exactly what happened. 
---
I remember that hag game and the events that followed..

I edit papers for students at my uni for free for friends, and they just put commas everywhere! I‚Äôve asked why and they usually say: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if it should go there. I did it in case I needed it‚Äù. They rarely try semicolons, colons, or leaving it blank if they‚Äôre unsure.

Interesting, a third idiot has become trapped in the standoff.
---
Gotta love it when people say NOED gives free kills when you've still gotta find and chase people to hit them. NOED can be outright removed before it even has a chance to come into play and there are various things to help you find Totems. Hell, you can even learn the spawn points.
---
DS has absolutely no solid counter play in its current state. It's moronic to think they are on the same level.
---
I think it's a light brown, but it's bright outside.
---
the worst thing is, it was two survivors being chased at the same time. they didnt manage to run in different directions, so that the safe one could rescue me.. rank reset is a wondrous place
---
Because a Perk that has absolutely no solid counters is certainly on the same level as a Perk that can be removed before it even has a chance to trigger, right?
---
It's just too situational to be worth changing.

Uhm...Id like to be a voice of reason here and say PS4 players have a built in voice comm system that comes with the system and isn't 3rd party. So I'm 100% sure BHVR accounts for voice comms.

Eh I would spend $8 dollars if I were you. It‚Äôs rarely cheap for what you get. Cheaper than $10 for each character and no cosmetics.
---
Since The Darkness Among Us the Devs have been able to change the map selection chances. So my guess is that the new map has a very high chance of being selected during the PTB. Seeing as that needs testing alongside the other content of the Chapter.
---
I dont really play killer so i figured i would be fine just getting the survivor
---
Yeah sucks having to spend $3 more but it‚Äôs your call.

I'm inclined to believe this. I vaguely recall another DLC having the release date announced kinda like this before. I think it was the Saw Chapter.

Though now that I got leatherface for $2.50, the time to hunt for new masks has come and the original four will help make fine masks indeed.

Why is there a space between leatherface and hillbilly?? 
---
That's not where a comma should be üòÇ
---
Because now days most survivors with flashlights drop a pallet and then blind you. It's not a very good tactic because you don't get as much of a lead away from the killer, so I just punish them for being toxic.
---
Oh no I meant the last survivor not lady haha silly autocorrect. Nah I hunt both genders equally but I reward people for playing well and punish people for being toxic. I always play as fair as possible. I don't camp hooks and I don't tunnel. I do enjoy playing legion but I never use his exploits, I most run hex the third seal to confuse people.

If I've hooked someone twice in a row and see them again I tend to leave them alone for a while and try to find someone else. I try to make it fun for everyone you know

Prestige 3 Claudette here. I die in most of my games, can't loop for shit, always first one to go down.

I just play alot so I could prestige for the clothes :l
---
You and other four survivors = 5 survivors.
---
1. No. ^_^
---
1.2. They serve the same purpose - helping you to win the game.
---
1. Haven't seen much proof of me being wrong, my friend! Gotta try harder!
---
2. If it helps him, why are you using it against him? Those loops can only be occupied by one survivor at a time. So if you go away and find someone else - and Freddy's tracking is great - you'll find a survivor you can actually catch. Genius, right?
---
8.2. Sound is borked, and gets borked every other patch. I'm not saying Spirit is bad; quite the opposite. But her tracking is not as reliable as people seem to think, and you have to actually get them injured in the first place (which requires you to hit them with a phase walk). And an experienced Huntress would have a good idea on the hitboxes, so getting a hit wouldn't be as hard as one might think.
---
1. No, I'm going to mash E in a chase, because you can rebind the teleportation key. You only need to mash E if you know a survivor is going to run into your trap, which you can see. Hardly wasting time is wasting time, yes, but she hardly wastes any - that was kind of my point. She can force pathing on any map, in (almost) any area (Rotten Fields and Disturbed Ward are annoying as hell, but still doable). Hag is the least map-dependent killer out there. 
---
Against good survivors, no, you'll still have enough time to wait for deadzones. Against perfect survivors? Agreed, Freddy will get stomped. Same as any other killer barring omegablinks Nurse. And hey, if you don't want to play slug Freddy, that's totally fine! I get it's not fun for most people. But then it's a case of "I don't really like how Freddy plays" rather than "Freddy is bad", no? Valid opinion!
---
We have been over this. I did the math! I did MATH! How much more "over this" can we get? Freddy has more time than any other killer, and I proved that with numbers. If they run to a safe pallet and don't drop it, they get hit. Then you can come back later for a down, or go chase someone else who's not near a safe pallet.
---
I didn't say Freddy created deadzones faster than other killers. I said he has more time to create deadzones (and then proved it, so don't go saying he has less time again, okie?)
---
Cheers, yeah couldn‚Äôt agree more.

Sometimes points sometimes to be a asshole
---
Reported him, incl. vids/clips from his own stream, but he's still streaming.
---
When I down a feng it sounds like I just stepped on a squeaky toy so that‚Äôs fun 
---
&gt;Why would I accept a hacker in our community?
---
Is he the actual **cheater** or just someone who paid for all of that in the black market? 
---
&gt;He gets free DLCs, skins , Moris and good addons.
---
How does that affect your gameplay or anyone's gameplay? It only affects your wallet and playtime. 
---
Not saying you should accept, I'm saying you shouldn't care that much unless he is using cheats to obtain in-game advantages. 
---
Both are op, noed is only good vs shit players or cocky players but ds is good no matter what. 
---
Bro ds is a perk that 1/4 survivors can use, they can be dribbled, and they can miss + enduring eats ds.
---
Noed is like a free kill
---
You‚Äôre thinking Shirtless David is mortal. 
---
Your boyfriend is valiant for trying to save you from a beast of the fog. 
---
You Just need to break totems, i always break every single totem i see, and NOED is now a rare problem for me, but the killers can't do anything to avoid the DS.
---
***free Moris and good addons***
---
Oh yes, because NOED hasn't ever been nerfed before...
---
I feel like it could be slightly sarcastic idk. Or they‚Äôre just very new wholesome people who knows 
---
I noticed, they seem to enjoy being passive aggressive with everyone that is not sucking their virtual dick, and if someone happens to agree with them then that's a bonus.
---
Yeah, that seems annoying and not that useful. Before I started, a friend recommended ignoring flashlights. He said they were hard to time to get an advantage.
---
Ah, okay - that‚Äôs makes sense! I‚Äôve typed the wrong word like that often. 
---
I see so many legion memes, but I don‚Äôt get the hate? The bleeding is an annoyance, but letting survivors self heal mitigates the damage.
---
Thanks for that! You‚Äôre probably one of the only ones. Once I get hooked once, it‚Äôs tough getting them away from me. Though I get it - a third hook automatically takes someone out, which is the goal. I wish killers would use their mori on anyone who‚Äôs been hooked twice to avoid the repetition though. I want to die in different ways if I have to die again!
---
No one misses ds, it's not hard to hit, you still get 1.5 seconds away with max enduring and not everyone runs it, noed can be destroyed by destroying the totem, then you can save, it's not hard they are equally bad
---
My ping average has been anything from 250-700.
---
I hope BHVR fix this soon. I‚Äôm in Oceania and play both Killer and survivor and it‚Äôs the same across both.
---
but then your wasting alot of time when you could be doing gens while the killer can just pick up the survivor with ds and like 6 seconds wasted
---
&gt;free Moris and good addons
---
As if add-ons played such a big role in a match if you don't know how to play in the first place. 
---
Anyone with 500 to 1k hours will have a good amount of moris saved up, which makes them exactly the same as your cheater gameplay wise. 
---
No, in fact, I give hatch and special treatment to some specific people. For example: pizza Dwight, Blue hair Feng, default ace and Jeff
---
EU / Germany
---
I will Deliverance right in their face as they run up for the unhook, because sometimes I just feel like teh memez
---
Tbf there is a bunch of things survivors use that are not op at all and killers complain about them all the time. Cough* purple flashlight cough* self care cough* dead hard
---
I mean, it'll take some time before they get to it.
---
Isn't the odd bulb the only one that eats charges?

---
Wasn't this perk nerfed as well before going live? Like why?
---
Yes I can! When I first got them back on it was not easy cause I had to get used to them again. 
---
No problem. None at all
---
Disagree on Julie, she made sure to kill the guy with her stab so that Susie didnt have to get her hands dirty and she had to close her eyes to just get through it.
---
I was so hyped for this perk and its so trash. Please make it increase skill check chances on healing.
---
I always run tinkerer just to scare survivors like this. I feel like jumpscares make it so much more fun to play.
---
Don‚Äôt know. Hope they‚Äôll post a roadmap soon after Chapter 11 release. 
---
Thanks! I haven't drawn anything for almost one year, still need some time to recover :D
---
‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Glad you liked it :D
---
Alright no offense or anything but why do you sound so much like anomaly ?
---
*looks up definition of doodle*
---
Eeew xbox gross
---
Probably fine before right
---
I‚Äôve only ever seen very dark browns ones that‚Äôs all. 
---
Play at low settings, runs smoother and it‚Äôs visually beneficial to see the killers red stain. I played at max settings for the longest time and only recently I found how much easier it is for tracking and evading the killer
---
Clearly someone messed up pick time with this product 
---
Quite a few people use controller on pc, 
---
Thanks mate. Is it the same if you play as killer?
---
Noed would be more fitting 
---
It was in another thread too but maybe that was you as well. Sorry, I‚Äôm not good with names. It‚Äôs a problem for me in the game - I want to give some players thumbs up, but I forget their names almost instantly half the time.
---
Ok
---
I just can‚Äôt do the thumb sticks when mine are long, I‚Äôll keep the rest long but I never have long thumbs 
---
BBQ and chilli dlc* smh 
---
Hitting them too late into their unhook animation will not cancel it since the game registers it as a complete action at that point.
---
I mean it still happens if you don‚Äôt tab out 
---
Okay, so two (I think?) wouldn‚Äôt kill my Feng. Or do you mean the blue hair that‚Äôs NOT pigtails? I don‚Äôt have that version for her right now. 
---
I‚Äôve never seen a Quentin as a fellow survivor. I think I‚Äôve seen everyone else, so that‚Äôs a bit odd. His design isn‚Äôt too appealing and his perks don‚Äôt seem that great, so maybe not many people want to use him.
---
Stephanie's status as a child care professional allow her to encourage others and evade the killer.
---
Difficulty: Intermediate
---
*(based on only using her Unique Perks)*
---
Stephanie was the leader of a small daycare in the small town of L√®z√©ton, were she taught athletics, singing and taught life lessons to her wards. She was known for her positive outlook and friendly rivalry with an opposing daycare ran by a man named Robby. One day, after her class let out, Robby came to visit her and announced he had to unfortunately close his business due to illness, and was wondering if Stephanie could take care of the children who attend his trickery classes. Stephanie accepted, but a few days down the line, her job was a lot more overwhelming than expected and she turned to caffeine to get her through the day. On her last day in our realm, the caffeine caused her to attempt an athletic trick in the rooftop garden she ran to teach the kids about caring, but she flipped off the edge. As all the toddlers ran to the edge to see the aftermath, some of them swear they saw some dark smoke disappear as quickly as they saw it.
---
Cooking By The Book:
---
When repairing a generator with 3/2/1 teammates, you hum to bolster your teammates resolve. Your humming allows your teammates to focus, and you repair 5%/10%/15% faster, BUT when a killer comes within 10/15/20 metres of the generator you are repairing, they will receive a noise notification of you humming.
---
Bing Bang (Time To Dance):
---
When you drop a pallet on a killer, receive the Haste effect, and leave no scratch-marks as you skip away from the scene of the pallet drop.
---
We Will Be Friends:
---
When unhooking a survivor, receive a skill check if the killer is within 10/15/20 metres of you. If you hit this skill check, you and the rescued survivor receive the hardened effect for 5/10/15 seconds. If you fail the skill check, the killer receives the Bloodlust status effect.
---
Just run botany knowledge
---
I love this!
---
Default key is R, be careful though, droping a survivor makes their wiggle bar increase by 33% (you can wait some time for it to go back to 0% if they remain on the floor), if someone struggled for a long time on your back and you try to drop them and the 33% increase brings their bar to 100% will make them escape instead of you droping them.
---
Maybe they‚Äôll do something with it later? If not abused by friends, it could be added to increase blood points after a trial for each thumbs up you get. But then people would probably give everyone thumbs up and expect the same, then whine if they didn‚Äôt get it.  It should eventually have some purpose if only to be a way of saying good game without messaging them.
---
But doesn't that mean you're the prostitute?
---
With billy and that would be perfect right as he chainsaws you 
---
Not every killer on the game is better than a fully coordinated SWF group.
---
And not every killer mains killer to get that good. Some only play killer for Dailies, Achievements or in downtime when their own SWF group isn't on.
---
X3
---
Why only 1,5 ? It would helped so much with leveling some killers 
---
It's been nearly a week, if it matters.
---
The deep wounds by itself is rather shit, i had some killers that know about this strategy just look down when i try to desperately loop them after getting a BT effect. Just make it slow down if the killer is 'X' distance away and make it fully stop if they are 'y' distance away, no not terror radius, actual distance because a terror radius would still make it shit vs Legion since they pretty much run M&amp;A as a staple. A rework to Legion is preferable, but for now we need something, anything at all.
---
Nope, they announced this all the way back in November 2018 [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/31987/new-matchmaking-system-information#Item\_0](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/31987/new-matchmaking-system-information#Item_0)
---
And it was already working for quite the long time, seems like they either copy \`n pasted the entire text, or made a small update
---
What were they thinking when they put totems next to generators? 
---
Barbie creator: "Look hoe they massacred my poor boi
---
So fucking relatable 
---
True. I just went with strike cuz I wanted to go with it instead
---
The Feng with the pigtails and white mask, that one looks awesome so I tend to be nice to fengs who wear that(I think it looks very pretty).
---
Quentins are really rare. Quentins perks are trash and most of the Quentins I encountered are super toxic(no idea why). He also looks super weird and unappealing. Seriously, fuck Quentin. 
---
Of all the docs addons, the Iri Kings not even the worst. Surprised he didn‚Äôt double calm that shit

Same time as the other platforms. Soon

Yea, the PTB already happened. I heard it was supposed to be today, but I'm not too sure about that. 
---
Yeah moonwalking or looking down is uncounterable 
---
:(
---
I'm hoping maybe Tuesday. That's when they usually come out right? 
---
It's still Doctor. He's not very good. Still can be looped for days.
---
I've got my 1 million blood points ready to level up the killer. Then I'm gonna work on Jane after. Maybe by tomorrow or Monday I should have Jane leveled up well too. 
---
That‚Äôs the Feng I have! I‚Äôm so nerdy that I‚Äôm going to do a cosplay of that look plus her starting look (cardigan, striped shirt, black capris). I have a blue wig like that and skirt, sock, mask and shoes already from other outfits. I have stuff close enough to her starting look as well. None of it‚Äôs exactly like hers but it‚Äôs close. I zoomed in on her eye makeup to get that right too. I doubt I‚Äôll where it except for my bf, but I like putting outfits together for fun:)
---
I‚Äôll pay attention if I‚Äôm ever grouped with a Quentin. It‚Äôs hard to tell when other survivors are toxic when you‚Äôre doing your best just to survive, start gens, and help others. I have caught teammates teabagging though, which is so childish. They get in my way at the gate.
---
That‚Äôs funny! I‚Äôd think some would like how silly it looked at least. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they said it is intended at one point 
---
Our ISP has a history of blocking everything, from Skype, Roblox (lol), Discord, heck even Habbo was blocked for years. I'm keeping my tinfoil hat on after the support email said "errors with specific service providers such as yours" - i'm just straight up blaming the ISP at this point.
---
\^
---
I struggle to hurt Jeffs, but other than that I don't discriminate.
---
Laurie, however... as a Mike main, it's like second nature to target them as much as possible.
---
god dangit why is this so painstaking, awfully, just out the park true...
---
Pretty sure they have a anticheat auto detect for altered files. Besides that I dont think they would blindly ban you for cheating without checking. And it hardly does happen but cheaters do get caught time to time. 
---
I‚Äôm a decent Nurse on Xbox, 4k‚Äôd at rank 3 with her before reset.

I wish we had game chat on console
---
Get rekt
---
Nahh Leatherfaces saw me as a sworn enemy lmao
---
Boo hoo üò¢
---
People complain about other people being toxic, but I love it. After almost every game they tell me that my family should die, I camp or/and how bad I am at this game. Since most of these people are like 15 years old, it's really simple to piss them off after the game. Find your joy in that like I did.
---
Next time he run into Legion he will dc ;)
---
19th should be
---
That's insane for two hours worth of work, it looks like a day long project at the least
---
No lie i used to think survivor pudding was pudding they ate around the campfire and the killer stole it. I looked closer at the icon just recently and noticed it was people pudding. 
---
Yea but when you have 5 stacks and you almost instant heal a guy on the ground it's worth running autodidact 
---
I'd rather run it over a more efficient perk because it's so much more awesome when you heal the fuck out of people
---
Most likely he was refunded with bloodpoints when his save file got corrected in the past, that is why he has so much. It happened to me last year and i was refunded with 92 million bp either. 
---
issa smol biwwy
---
Oh, DS was the least of his problems in that match.
---
My meme is making the rounds, I'm so proudüòä

Bloodletting dwight... let me bleed plz

Don‚Äôt worry you have noed as a back up :P

i usually slug one survivor if i have sloppy to add heal pressure so i can go along and patrol gens

lewd!

That's really fucking beautiful dude
---
I don't usually go after them I'm missing 5.

Gotta get that unhooking achievement.

Of course not! He's already *well hung*.

this is the best comment oh my god üíÄ

Laurie because fuck dicisive strike. I personally can't wait for the rework.
---
That was a haphazard spot. I've found a couple of placements, but I mostly agree. I wish I could say to *everyone* on this post that I regret that lol
---
Not on my watch 
---
he should be banned for this offence and its sad hearing nothing is being done
---
Yesterday I played with my sister, the two random teammates brought the mist thiccener and so did I. And the killer we got was fucking piggy :( 
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt even know it was yours. I don‚Äôt want to repost so I‚Äôm deleting 
---
Jane aint a fatty
---
You have to admit, NOED and Blood Warden's a match made... IN HELL. GRAHAHAHA 
---
No no, on my perspective the second i say something in favor of killers i get downvoted to oblivion.
---
Btw. i like Legion.
---
Nice teabags. Really necessary.
---
Build points up for them. 
---
Hmm, probably because she unknowingly infected her followers but still kept a blind faith? Idk
---
Sure! It would be better if you can write something about Wraith and Nurse? It's my OTP lol
---
Same, I only ever reward good players, and the same happens to me. If my potato team dies, sometimes I get the hatch.
---
Just because you don't have to wait 3mins, it doesn't mean the rest of the world is lying my boy
---
People dc on LF quite frequently cos camping is a real strategy u know
---
It makes me irrationally angry
---
They can't take something away from you that you bought, there's legal issues. 
---
It's not them wanting money, it's them not wanting to lose money for some guaranteed law cases.
---
We're you playing against Meyers?
---
Calling it a doodle seems like humblebrag ...
---
It's a really beautiful drawing, it's got the Nurse's right mix of scary and tragic. Folds in clothing is hard to do right too. 
---
FRICKEN AYE! THIS IS STORY MATERIAL
---
Huntress should be in homeschooled. She lived in a cabin in the woods with her mother.
---
Someone rescues you, the killer tunnels you and you can use your ds if he picks you up 60 seconds after someone rescues you (if i still got that right). That‚Äòs a good anti tunneling perk for me 
---
Username checks out
---
Rape does not count fyi
---
Basically, because of their ability you can't outsmart them when using it. Sooner or later they will catch up to you and stab you and there is nothing to counter it and when they decide to stab you until you fall, a chase is basically just waiting for their power meter to come back and that's it. It's boring to go against and probably not like the devs intended it.
---
How old is this pic?
---
How do you have the red tier skills???
---
That's is up to you. Once the perk get changed it won't be as consistent as it is now, but it will still have it's uses.
---
It's gonna be an Anti tunneling perk. So if you have a problem with that,buy it. 
---
There's probably NDA's going on from the discussions where they can't go into details only going with "It's going good" or "It's not happening", so at best all we'll get is a similar response. 
---
Destruction 100
---
He has a ton of stuff built into his Frenzy. And supposedly his addons are wack too though I haven't read up on them.
---
The fact that he's able to cut multiple people at once is probably also a factor.
---
I also hate nurse with a passion if that helps ignoring my opinion.
---
It wasn‚Äôt any perk, it happend in a few different games and nobody had it.
---
Yeah. Rank 20 killers. People at that rank complain about everything. 
---
Why not both? Rambo gets to choose who lives and who dies!
---
It was against Legion and Hillbily (and some other), I didn‚Äôt play against Meyers.
---
Rank 19
---
I get these every now and then.  I just scream at them to FEED ME YOUR SALT!!!!
---
That would be decent for tunneling and camping. As it stands it hasnt served much of a purpose in helping me it just pisses the killer off and they have nothing else to do so they continue to chase me. As a killer it just pisses me off and i have nothing else to do so i continue to chase them. 
---
Unless they left on bad terms with Valve, I imagine it'll be on Steam.
---
*Insert comment about Nea*
---
More like saying that NOED ruins the game and Legion players are Sociopaths. 
---
Idk why all the hate for legion? I guess it‚Äôs sheep mentality, the moment a popular streamer says something everybody agress with him. I don‚Äôt enjoy playing against the legion especially with frank‚Äôs mixtape, however I also don‚Äôt enjoy playing against a doctor or a trapper.
---
Sure legion takes practically no skill, however they remain one of the worst killer in the game because of how long it takes to kill with your power (unless you use mixtape)
---
If THIS is after a 1 year hiatus someone needs to get you publishing book because this is gold!
---
Buy every perk that you don't own from the shrine.
---
Dont use shit like M&amp;A or shadowborn (unless you are very expirianced)
---
Double check before swinging. Missing a blink-swing is a lot more punishing than just taking the fatigue.
---
Also also dont blink without line of sight or unless youre 100% sure where the survivor is. You can always walk up and see what the surv does before pulling the trigger
---
&gt;Excuse you?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*Reads Daddy Myers and David King fanfic*
---
I think Technician would go well with that. If I'm thinking correctly, it's the Feng perk that doesnt make gens blow up when you miss a check. 
---
*Insert comment about insering a comment about Nea*
---
"UgH tHeReS nO cOuNtEr To FlAsHliGhTs"
---
I kinda wish they'd buff "Blindness" to have some sort of disorienting effect like this. 
---
Lol It's like offending a different culture on accident. To survivors t-bag means hello, but to killers it means fuck you
---
Imported Color palette, most likely.
---
I encountered a pretty... Funny set I guess, it's very funny when you think of it but very situationnal at the same time...
---
It was at this exact same spot, same hook, same window, everything...
---
It was a Huntress.
---
With Insidious.
---
And iridescent Hatchet.
---
And the addon that give her 3 more hatchet...
---
Guess what happened to that one unlucky teamates...
---
If you have 9000 bp don't buy, save it for new killer/survivor.
---
Neuroscience, actually. He just applied it with as much brutality as possible and got away with it because of the Red Scare. 
---
Maybe go through some settings and lower volume levels in game, and lower it on your PC for dead by daylight too? (I bet you have, just some people online don‚Äôt think about it so I have to say)
---
Tell that to my post game chat. If I even get a single sacrifice as Nurse I am instantly called a try hard sweaty killer main who should get cancer. I'm of the opinion that people will look for any excuse there is to rage quit or flame someone. So no matter what killer I pick, someone out there is going to tell me to kill myself. So what difference does it make?
---
Just dont get hit 4head
---
There‚Äôs not a lot they can really say. Licensing agreements can be a lot of back and forth for months, and even then it can be pulled last minute. 
---
To be blunt, if you want alternative cosmetics and you want them frequently, then I‚Äôd suggest you pick a non licensed character and go through the grind again. There‚Äôs a high chance Quentin never gets any more cosmetics until the day this game dies. 
---
Because for some reason people view trying to mind game a nurse as a challenge. Even though, at the end if the day, there is no agency against a good nurse. 
---
I'd think that Trapper's parents taught him everything. From Ironworks and hunting all the way down to stitching and embroidery. Dude's a renaissance man, though. 
---
yes it was. In the PTB is was, starting at -20% and gives a +20% progression every token for a max of 80%.
---
We now have -25% start with a +15% progression every token.
---
It depends on my mood but Claudettes and Nea will never get a "free" hatch, because they seem to be often toxic or super immersed.
---
However, if a Claudette or Nea played very well or fair, they might get it.
---
But this means they interacted with the Killer and they did play fair, so they were not your typical Nea/Claudette.
---
They're both incredibly unfun to play against because they ignore anything a survivor can do to escape or defend themselves. It's just that Nurse takes work to get to that point so you MIGHT get slightly more respect, but honestly I'll just respect someone who can play a different killer well rather than practice one that feels like as a survivor, my skill becomes negligible in the match.
---
This is why we have Franklin's.
---
Like you said that can be any killer. Survivors are just salty af sometimes. I was just saying generally people dc on legion and not nurse bc they feel nurse is more fair. Anyone who buys legion dlc and plays it the same day can 4k with no skill, but most people wont even 1k as nurse first time.
---
First of all it is Doctor Herman Carter for a reason. 
---
Also Sally has to have been through some sort of inpatient care classes in her human life to be hired at an asylum for 20 years. 
---
I think Huntress is the embodiment of a grown toddler XD
---
If all the roles were Legion, Frank would be the one the teach Susie the word fuck, Julie would yell at him, and Joey would try to calm her down before she moris him
---
Yeah, they bother me as a survivor even. Teabagging at the exit and blocking hurt teammates is awful. Wasting pallets is only good for one thing: one of my perks allows me to see the killer if they break the pallet, so also bad as far as the killer is concerned.
---
Agreed but just running anything else is basically better this is one of the worst perks in the game.
---
I mean this is your job as killer to apply pressure and keep survivors off gens. 
---
Aw, I couldn‚Äôt do it! If you‚Äôve ever played Walking Dead, Kenny looked like my elderly uncle and it was painful watching anything bad happen to him. 
---
tfw legion bad DC gang le epix
---
RUDE wraith should be before billy tho
---
ACCURATE 
---
This def for higher ranks as nurse and legion on lower ranks are quite ~~bad~~ new.
---
Wave those arms baby!
---
...D A R N
---
We'll never
---
LOL ok.  We got a hot shot here.
---
Enlightening.
---
Thats why tombstone Myers exists.
---
Those are my favorites!  The face drawn on her mask is a bit silly, but wearing a mask on subways makes sense. 
---
You‚Äôre right though - I get tunneled a lot as Feng because she‚Äôs easy to spot.
---
I'm not sure Legion can really be classified as a killer, he's more of a nuisance.
---
It's like, if someone makes a claim they should back it up.  Weird, right?
---
Aw but sweetie you have noed! 
---
Lmao 
---
Funnily enough, the games where people spend all their time trying to break all my totems go a lot better than those where they just ignore them to do gens, because I'm able to reliably find, injure, down, and hook people without any generators popping.
---
Sure all my totems get broken, but if I've gotten a 4k at 5 generators because they were too busy trying to break Devour Hope and Thrill of the Hunt I'm not upset.
---
Someone else said this about her sounds - I need to try her out of curiosity.  I wonder why ridiculous her voice actress felt?
---
This would be me. I‚Äôve only tried killer once but didn‚Äôt even get one hit in:(
---
slugging is fucking boring and borderline abuse because killer can use it to prevent hatch spawn
---
Hillbilly seemed like the kind of character people would hate but I'm actually surprised survivors rather enjoy going against him.
---
noed bad
---
Yeah, Claudette has this one brown recolor outfit and P3. Have fun finding her. Every other outfit is okay for me.
---
Nea is a personal experience tends to use urban evasion and iron will.. If I lose her, she is gone! (Especially in Mount Ormond, where scratch marks are randomly visible)
---
Don't get me wrong, it is okay for me to play this way but I do not think they are Hatchworthy..
---
I give Hatch to the last survivor, if played fair. It is often a David tho.
---
it looks like WGLF picture
---
Seems the ISP is the issue according to today's update to my ticket: https://i.imgur.com/0okC9hy.jpg :\
---
So if someone attempts to unhook themselves you will just stare at them until they reach struggle phase?
---
Dude, you're a piece of shit.
---
That's not weird. Asking for a source on something abstract and anecdotal is super weird and very "stereotypical redditor". Have some common sense. 
---
I suck at using it, so I‚Äôm curious about the rework as well. I‚Äôd rather just wiggle and hope the killer doesn‚Äôt make it to the hook.
---
True
---
Yeah exactly. I can't count how many times i notice someone with a flashlight nearby, fake to take it, free hit ... only to go back, fake it, and another dead body. Gg
---
Is it because Jeff looks so friendly and caring?
---
Wow that seems like a lot! How many hours did it take to get that many? As for me, I bought it. I get tunneled a lot. In its current form, I don‚Äôt like it that well since I still have trouble with that skill check. I think it‚Äôs because I panic when caught and can‚Äôt focus as well.
---
Are we *really* sure Freddy belongs there?
---
Feel like a lot of people are confusing "formal education" with "intelligence," and maybe overestimating the HR standards of Crotus Prenn and \[checks notes\] government black ops.
---
The one who jumps a window or drops a pallet and stands there, maybe teabagging maybe not, but just standing there as I accrue Evil Within, I have the almost fanatical desire to teach them it was all their fault.
---
That‚Äôs bad ass!!
---
No this just lets you be able to acquire teachable perks without putting point into said killer or survivor. This also includes any dlc characters like Laurie‚Äôs Decisive Strike And Devour Hope/Overwhelming Presense if you‚Äôre on pc 
---
Haha well I used to have around 11k but have bought a few recently. I only have around 90 hours in the game but I actually have never spent them until recently so just been stockpiling I guess. Yeah, I definitely see what you mean about being tunneled. Although, I don‚Äôt run into that a lot unless someone unhooks me right in front of the killer. I might just pass though
---
Did they all survive or something? Did you follow his imaginary rules of no tunneling/camping?
---
Sweet. Stick it to those tunneling killers. 
---
Hillbilly is fine where he is right now. He has counters and I think there's way worse things to complain about with DbD at the moment.
---
That doesn't change the fact that she didn't hesitate to kill him, just because Frank said so. She's slightly better than Frank because she's only his follower, not a corruptor like him. 
---
This is the same copy/paste response me and my friends have been given since 2.2.0. No company will admit the issue is from their end.
---
Alright noted, thank you
---
Did you do the prerequisite of safe-unhooking someone before getting hooked?
---
Legion bad gib 3 karma plz 
---
That‚Äôs kinda the point I was making 
---
People get so mad if you camp a hook or tunnel vision one survivor 
---
That‚Äôs part of the game to me and I wish more people just enjoyed surviving OR dying
---
*JAWS theme intensifies while waiting for that one guy who always links the dbdgonewild subreddit*
---
If it doesn't well it should.
---
Joey was the one who didnt hesitate and took the knife from Frank immediately. Julie was protecting Susie. 
---
&gt;things are firing up in the dbd fandom
---
Lol. Its chill if you wanna see her that way I just took it as being highly empathetic which isnt a trait pyschopaths have.
---
God damn your dark and based on the aggression your severely depressed 
---
&lt;3 sorry if I camp your hooked corpse 
---
I usually point at a survivor to say "run that way, I'll take the aggro" but sometimes its understood as "hey killer, kill this lad"
---
Im not saying that bringing strong add ons/ items/ perks is toxic but u just dont do that to survivors who dont know what a pallet is, they just run in straight line in hopes of the killer not catching them 
---
This isn't a meme though? It's not intended to be funny, it's informational.
---
Thanks for playing Legion! *report message*
---
It's in the nature of the Bubba main to wank victoriously after every third hook.
---
Again?
---
well darn, i just had a few ideas to handicap myself when playing legion so that survivors have a chance to run away from me and stuff but darn darn the internet told me to not play legion so i wont play legion
---
"It sounded better in my head..."
---
You didn't need to write "a virgin forever". That's the point of the "100%" joke
---
Spirit is better then myers lol
---
Let‚Äôs not forget the legions who moon walk to continue your bleed out timer while still in ‚Äúchase‚Äù.
---
No
---
Only on the floor
---
Wow, I didn't know people from the Divide were playing DBD. Howdy!
---
Read the tag
---
I have a good pair of headphones and kicking pallets and especially gens truly is tinitus inducing. I have no idea why it has to be THAT loud...

The ultimate regret. While any totem is being cleansed non-hex totems skill checks now appear and at a faster speed. If it's a hex totem skill check spear in great numbers with the same skill zone size as when unnerving presence.If you stop cleansing the hex totem before it's done it injures the survivor if they miss a great skill check and gives a noticeable alert to the killer..... I kinda spit balled this because there really isnt any good perks for defending totems. So it's a rough idea 
---
Credit to **Chattywindow**. They originally posted the shirtless myers thing to Reddit.
---
And the sad part is that when u play killer its the complete opposite, u chase a survivor for one minute ruin destroyed, 5 gens done, all exit gate opened, all totems cleansed rip noed   
---
Keeping with the tradition of avoiding the number 3 too.
---
I base my theory on the fact that every killer since Clown has been released on a Tuesday a week after their PTB closed. The PTB was closed Thursday night, which puts the release most likely next Tuesday the 19th, but it could be the Tuesday afterwards depending on how much they have to change. Considering the feedback, and how well received that went though, they probably won't have to change much.
---

Shhh...let Freddy have this...he doesn't have anything else to brag about at the cool killers club.
---
Do you at least think it's fun at all? Do you like killer or survivor?

I play at ultra, smooth 60fps with a 1060 6gb and i5 7300hq. 
---
Don't need to go too crazy but, that being said, I'd suggest you don't get lower than a 1060 6gb, you might branch out to more demanding games.
---
Thanks for this most posts are "delete legion" "ill dc against legion" or other such not helpful shitposts. This put it all out so clearly and well. I really hope legion gets a rework and makes him fun to use and play against.
---
Dude! I had no Idea legion was a killer! I always thought she was a survivor! Thanks a ton, I was always helping her!
---
I solo que more often than not and have no problem tracking totems without a team or smallgame. You just count. Some tips below.
---
-assume every killer has noed unless you can tell what perks they are runnin.
---
-if you dont have time to pop all totems atleast find them or keep track of where you saw them, return when/if you can. When noed prompts go check the ones you know
---
-dont b-line from gen to gen. Always go through to possible spawn location to check/clense or info for later
---
-count... srsly. Someone popped a hex? Thats 1.. you find one pop it. You see a broken one you didnt pop already count it. I dont assume anyone else cleansed unless a hex broke or I see it broke. Your friends should call out that they did a totem.
---
-after awhile you will learn where they can spawn
---
-load in you should make a habit to pop a totem before touching gens. More often than not the hexs spawn near survivors. Also doing a totem first thing will also help prevent being the first found.
---
-while looking for a hex totem pop the ones that are dull.
---
Try not to focus on the games where it paid off for the killer. In that situtation it worked out but it has so many counters that a killer cant rely on noed alone to 4k at end game. 
---
Hell as killer ive seen bs like nonobbession ds users, dsing me and landing with adrenalin but im not gunna post a "adrenaline after pickup should fk right off" and that is highly fkin crutch combo. 
---
The devs like where noed is and arent going to change it. 
---
when i play killer i try to play fair unless someone else is gonna act like a dick to me. i want to get treated the way i treat others and i find it more skill full to not tunnel and camp and be able to get a 4k. but people still act like this when you play fair, and always when i'm playing as survivor i get toxic killers that think they're the most skilled person in the world for facecamping someone that just tried to play the game rofl
---
legion
---
Yeah I prefer survivor mainly because its less toxic I believe.  I‚Äôm actually decent at this game but when I play killer I come across people show like to bombard me with hate messages.  It‚Äôs fun, but only in a few hours at a time.  It‚Äôs s fun game though and I‚Äôve had some matches that were incredible which is probably what keep bringing me back and and puke.  Of course I‚Äôm interested in the new puke killer lol.
---
Box
---
Hex: Corn vision
---
That is how almost everything competitive players vs casual players are. Bottom 60% don't care,  49%-2% r toxic AF, and 1% hates there life and everything else about the game but has to keep playing because it's what there viewers want to watch so they dont care about literally anything and just a walking shell in the game that u can never touch as a killer 
---
Yeah the incredible matches really can give you a new love of the game. I always hope for those types of matches, and it really does keep me coming back! I can't wait for the puke killer, too!
---
No, don't get me wrong. I know very well that it is strong, as it is one of the few ways Freddy can apply pressure. I just think it's boring to play vs, as you get little interaction with them if they leave you on purpose.
---
I'm not talking about finding several people, sleeping them all and then chasing the last person you sleep. I'm talking about finding a guy, sleeping them and then leaving them to find someone else.
---
How is the nurse in the nurse tier? Switch her with the doctor. 0/10 tier list, downvoted.
---
Psst, Save the Best for Last is really good for Freddy and stops some of that bullshit. 
---
Also, thank God for the upcoming DS nerf. No more free escapes just because of a perk.
---
Plot twist-  Immediately rage quit when the survivors break Hex:  Haunted Grounds
---
FBI , open up !
---
What are you talking about?
---
Ok, well, every killer has some kind of counter play. Moonwalking Legion has NO counter play. There is nothing you can do about it, you are just dead. Furthermore, it requires no skill to do, just follow the blood. There should be some kind of counter play added. I‚Äôm not saying to take it out entirely, just make it fair and fun to play against. 
---
While it's kind of a Dick move, it's securing the kill. If someone has deliverance or Kobe's it turns what should be a finished match into potentially 2 or 3 people escaping.
---
The aids makes the fire burn brighter.
---
The funny part is he‚Äôs getting upvoted for his crazy assumptions üòÇ . No, you don‚Äôt just like playing a murderer in a video game who murdered pixels, but you‚Äôre a budding serial killer torturing bugs! So ironic you called him dark when he was making silly assumptions about how ‚Äúedgy‚Äù you are.
---
Only one I ever use is ; 
---
Hex: Gon‚Äô give it to ya.
---
The map used to give points for walking by generators, exit doors and hooks.
---
No, no they dont, stop restating what everyone is saying and think for yourself for once, there's alot of killer add-ons combos that have no counterplay to them
---
It's because less skilled players don't realise the game can be played where the killer doesnt have to play dirty to get their kills. 
---
Can you give me an example?
---
The first one is always devour hope or ruin to my experience
---
Indeed sir.  It will change a lot of dynamics and personally I do t care how strong or weak she is.  The change will be welcomed.
---
I have never played a game that long! (This is my first online game though, and I know people play them longer than the games I usually play.)
---
Yeah, if you‚Äôre not being tunneled, it may not be worth it. It takes a lot of time to collect shards!
---
All face campers think they are good and that they have a legit good strategy. Then tell you to get good or that u sucked after the game, but what happens when the game just starts you get a P3 Leatherface or billy that insta downs you with there chainsaw and then facecamps you the rest of the match or until dead and is running bbq-chili, bitter murmur, enduring and NOED. When in reality they are terrible at the game and probably are really shallow, selfish people in real life who think everything should be given to them! 
---
Who she marrying
---
I agree with Doctor but Nurse worked in an insane asylum in the 1940s. 
---
The psychiatric care system in the United States in the 40s absolutely sucked (it still does even now tbh), and consisted more of people either being systematically abused and tortured in bizzare attempts to understand their mental issues or being straight up ignored and treated like animals.
---
Wraith I guessüòù
---
Unless they combined that loadout with camping it isn't toxic.  Incredibly crutched out and mindless af, but not toxic.
---
I run empathy quite a bit, but really, it's not changing much. Most maps aren't larger than 128m, and those that are, are *barely* any bigger, so you'll only miss the person if they're all the way across the world. 
---
A hex that injures a survivor every 1-2 mins. Can't apply dying just injured.

What is your rank? I have had to change up my game play a lot and I have seen more success with it. At the beginning, look around your area, but don't touch a generator. Do a totem or search a chest. If you are next to a lit totem, don't touch it yet. Hide for a bit around it or wait for the killer to chase or hit someone else. Killers always check their totem, so they will probably come for your area first. When they leave, do it. Same for the gens - they may come by you. If the generator isn't started, they will leave. Start it once they go. When they hook someone, count to 4 and walk away to either another area or go for the hooked person. With BBQ they will go to where you were. If you were running at the time they were hooked, just change directions after counting to 4. If it's Rancor, this will help too, but don't run so they can't see scratch marks. When you are done with a gen, same thing - count to about 5 and then leave (this will help with bitter murmur). When you unhook someone, crouch (urban evade), walk or follow the unhooked person to help heal them. More than likely, if you don't, they will be found because usually their first instinct is to get away, but the killers is to find someone and scratch marks + blood + moaning gets them found first. Sometimes healing right at the hook works too. 
---
My hardest time is looping the killers depending on the survivor and perks I'm using. Sometimes I can juke really good and sometimes I just can't get away lol Hopefully some of those tips help you last longer and maybe even get to an exit gate!
---
It's hilarious, really.

Ah, immersed in the background. Makes sense now, thanks!

That dude can eat a dick.
---
It's because less skilled players usually don't care if they win or lose, they're just enjoying the game itself. While higher skilled players forget it's a game at all, and want the win or they rage.
---
Insidious is not camping
---
Because he's badly designed and basically take no skill to use, which created a huge circle jerk that basically acts like robots and keep stating the same things over and over and all act the same by dc'ing to Legion.
---
I will still find it funny that people whine that he takes no skill when most killers and survivor gameplay takes none either.
---
My life will never be the same for having read your amazing witty comments on this thread.  I thank you for your tireless effort in making reddit a better place.  You are doing gods work my friend.  Future generations will laud you as a genius.
---
I would like this too, also because sometimes, if one of the SWF's WiFi is slower, they don't all join together so it is hard to tell
---
Rank 1 and camping...killers like you make us all look like dicks man.
---
I've literally never seen Legion threads get downvoted. And ironically the only comments in the thread that get mass downvoted are the ones saying, "the crybabies are going to downvote this cuz Legion!"
---
That was absolutely beautiful. What tier was the NOED? 
---
That's really sad :(
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not much to ask that killers at least know when they have that inherent advantage over the killer. Thanks for sharing your opinion
---
The wild kid.
---
You can just check the profiles 
---
Clown's trailer was trash. 
---
Not on console
---
Only if you have a perk for that or burn an offering!
---
I‚Äôm not entirely sure if I should comment this here, but I‚Äôve had issues on PS4, randomly kicked to the login screen saying no internet connection when trying to start or join a lobby, queue times are non existent even having to restart the system just to get anywhere 
---
Yep that's because it's based off of the bullshit remake trash. 
---
r/AccidentalRenaissance
---
this is beautiful. 
---
Oh come on, Hag is at least Making tier
---
This is amazing! 
---
Props to you ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
---
You could wait until the new killer and survivor come out.
---
straight up facts lmao
---
Can somebody please link the vod of the game you are talking about?)
---
I play legion and i dont care if its unfun for survivors :)
---
Yeah but less often
---
Devs are trash they won't do shit or else we would have had the issue *properly addressed* months ago. 
---
One of the WORST remakes to come out of the 2000s. 
---
What if he just does it again?
---
Spirit, but I'm biased. I'm absolutely in love with that character. Her design, her power, her lore. She's so good once you get the hang of her. 
---
Doesn't matter one bit if they're swf or not prey is prey.  If you are playing the role of killer you kill whoever shows up to the campfire.  
---
That's ridiculous if it's in your line of sight though and it makes absolutely no sense. 
---
Wait to the new ones comig probably next week or so, it's a nice dlc. If you have seen it and do not like it, I really enjoy Spirit and doc and the survs are nice too with decent/fun perks overall
---
I reported this comment for crimes against humanity
---
That makes no sense if they're in your line of sight though. 
---
Exactly, and Pig should be Stop tier. Bad listing overall.
---
Yeah it was so annoying like the biggest part of the game is just not working like without that we won't even be able to play 
---
what's the difference between this and hanging on a hook looking at a red progress bar?
---
Well it's being published by Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment who release their PC games on Steam and I can't see any reason why this one would be any different unless something happens to make WB change their minds (eg: Epic Games money) between now &amp; release.
---
I get average 8fps on low graphics settings with 0% resolution so you could probably play it on the microwave if you wanted to :') 
---
You had me until the final part, how far up your own ass to you have to be to think Legion has counterplay?
---
Well Freddy is strong at Rank20 cuz survivor don¬¥t do gens so games last forever and they dont know how he works. So he is not bad up there \^\^
---
We won't inform you, getgud. 
---
You can only buy the non licensed ones with shards so I would recommend looking at the individual play styles to decide which one you want to play. 
---
No I mean in game AFTER the game has started. It‚Äôs reasonable to at least know that they have communication between themselves. I‚Äôm all against dodging lobbies 
---
This is the whole point of the new system. To avoid the countless lobby dodges. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand the point is that you find out after the game has started
---
No. 
---
Considering matchmaking lately, he very well may have been expecting a seal squad. 
---
Oh really? Because I recall Killer mains crying and crying to DS to get nerfed, and now they‚Äôre getting it. 
---
The only way shit changes is by getting enough people to agree that the change needs to happen, and bring attention to the problem. 
---
Maybe you should consider that before you open your mouth again. Or maybe make your OWN subreddit about how you think this game doesn‚Äôt get changed when people ask for it (spoiler alert: games get changes based on user requests)
---
It‚Äôs substantially harder to kill when everyone knows where you are because one person sees you. At least knowing they have that advantage opens up the potential for mindgames and counter play
---
Yeah. I was a Hag main 3 weeks ago. But there's no way i would be one if that would be the current trap setting time.
---
Yeah the devs don't know what the fuck they're doing. 
---
Yes you can, just click on their names and go to their friends list. 
---
Let's see...
---
L√©ry's is absolutely rife with chokepoints. If you know how and where to put traps, you can shut off loops, prevent Pallet Drops, and easily defend hooks. Some vaults, you can place traps underneath that they will not notice until they're snagged. The library loop is also his bitch given how easily he can make the pallets and windows completely unusable. It takes some preparation, but this map really likes him if he manages that early window effectively. Not to mention, the Iridescent Stone is really useful as it prevents any sort of permanent disarm and means he doesn't have to reset them after a catch. 
---
I agree with your stance on the Game, in retrospect. There are a couple of decent locations for traps here and there but on the whole he doesn't enjoy this map nearly as much as someone like Hag, simply because he still has to navigate. 
---
Haddonfield? Michael's house and the basement. He can make it completely inaccessible and shut off otherwise infinite loops with traps that cannot be disarmed. Simply attempting to vault or ascend stairs is a dangerous gamble for survivors because some placements on this map can cut off entire sections and be hidden so well that Survivors will complain that you're hacking. 
---
Badham, he excels for much the same reason. He can easily cut off entire sections and infinite loops. Survivors who are inattentive while vaulting will easily find themselves on a hook. 
---
However, Trapper struggles most in wide open spaces where traps aren't easily hidden, Shelter Woods being a prime example of that. There is no means by which to preemptively cut off vaults or pallets because unless you're running stealth add-ons, they'll notice your traps and disarm them. 
---
That's unpossible, you have an Alienware! 
---
That‚Äôs okay then I guess, but I can‚Äôt see how will it help killer other than ‚ÄúI can camp this one and others will run to me by themselves‚Äù. I would say just give a killer % bonus bp for every person in swf, so you‚Äôll be more rewarded for harder games.  
---
I can understand wanting to help SWFs not get lobby dodged, but it is their fault it's happening. The game is balanced around not having voice communication, when survivors can ignore a fundamental aspect of the game, killers are being punished without compensation.
---
People are saying that as a killer your job is to kill everyone that shows up, but SWFs is toxic at it's core. Totems aren't safe since their location can be called out. Survivors know when someone is being chased, so they're not worried that the killer could come right up behind them. Survivors can be healed just by saying where they are instead of trying to find someone. BHVR put a band-aid on a severed limb when they hid killer perks until the game is finished, but there is nothing to help with all the other advantages that SWFs get just by being in a group.
---
There will be more killers disconnecting mid game if they even think there it's SWFs instead of doing it before the game starts, which will make survivors lose offerings and items. This change hurts more than it helps.
---
i just got mind mori'd
---
So I have to look through their friends list (Which can be 100 people) just to see if they‚Äôre friends with anyone in the lobby, for three of them, before the match starts? 
---
That's still ridiculous and would encourage insta DCs. What the devs *really* need to do is close the gap between solo and SWF so they can buff killer accordingly. Then there wouldn't be the problem of struggling against SWF. 
---
Why thank you. Not to mention (laughs insidiously) there are places where the traps will actually sink and be partially hidden. 
---
Lol was about to say. This looks like an ochido ‚Äúfunny moments‚Äù montage.
---
They should fix the Reason why Killers dodge and it\`s cuz playing vs SWF is just unbalanced and toxic (the fact that they can share the killers location in real time allows em to freely rush gens and not have to worry about the Killers Location).
---
 And the Fact that these Games are so easy Won means Survivor spend all their spare time BM√¨ng the Killer. I barely got Toxic Random Survivor while most SWF are Toxic af.  Atleast give the Killer more Points and less Penality for running into Games they barely can Win. 
---
I play legion so I can get his teachable perks 
---
I will let any and every Bill that acts like a reasonable human being live, if at all possible. 
---
when i do play killer i never go for dwights oof
---
i just love them and i pick them up and look for the hatch w them whenever there‚Äôs a bad swf and i have the last two survivors downed :‚Äò)
---
I don't expect people not to use Discord, I just want people to stop all the denial about how beneficial it is to use, how it makes your matches easier, and to stop blaming other players for wanting to avoid it. If you want to download apps that give you advantages in multiplayer games, obviously nobody is going to stop you, but it shouldn't be controversial that people don't want to deal with it. 
---
I didn't get to rank 1 just by camping you know, otherwise how the hell would I be rank 1? I'm already efficient with chases and pressure, but if I just want a chill game against rank 1 survivors with Adrenaline and DS, then I want to use Insidious for ambushing. If I find someone who I catch going to the hook, I don't stay at the hook, I go chase them. If someone gets off the hook, I don't tunnel them; I go for the rescuer. Why would you assume I would be Insidious camping the hook the entire time? Stop berating killers who use Insidious. I would be happy that someone is getting use from a perk that is rarely used.
---
Why not? You want the Devs to add an entire feature (I'm sure isn't exactly an easy thing to do) just to appease you.
---
lol I wish
---
Legion is unfun for the survivors and the killer, but his play style works with Russian hardbase weirdly
---
You see, there's toxic survivors and toxic killers in equal proportions. There just statistically four times more survivors than killers.
---
I don't go for specific survivors, but more the people playing them.
---
If someone plays well, goes for saves, but gets farmed by their team, I'm more inclined to ignore then and let them get the hatch at the end.
---
If someone is clearly out of their depth  (thanks matchmaking) they get the hatch.
---
If someone gives me an offering after I've caught them fair and square, I'm inclined to let them go (just don't take the offering back).
---
But if you're toxic and farm your teammates, you're gonna die and everyone else gets to farm just to spite you.
---
Don't farm your teammates.
---
There is no way I could have played killer in 2016... this just looks like a nightmare 
---
ITS NOT A NERF STOP WHINING
---
When you have a typo in your meme and you don't want to risk a repost üôÑ
---
Actually Doctor was a nickname.  No one knows if he even has a medical diploma. 
---
Fine, all the time :)) 
---
I mean for some killers I'm not mad when I get mori-d (especially if they were really good the entire game) so I would love the option to give them a kiss as a sign of respect.
---
Congratulations! Here's to a thousand more.
---
Problem is we both know 90%+ of this would be used to simply dodge them.  Killers need to stop breaking lobbies because they see a challenge.  Those sweaty swf groups are by far my most rewarding killer games.
---
You certainly SOUND like a cartoon villain. 
---
If they were standing still it could have been the insidious perk.
---
If this change did happen, killers would dc upon loading in. This wouldn‚Äôt be better than dodging lobbies because then killers are wasting their offerings and addons and the offerings of the survivors. 
---
From experience, the killer is actually just there to re-hook me and let the other guy get away :(
---
Yeah the devs just don't seem to take too much into consideration anymore. 
---
This sounds stupid but when I am in the blood web there are ‚Äúitems‚Äù as such that I can purchase that are off the screen I can see and then black out after I have made a purchase yet I never knew they were there, ho do I go about seeing these 
---
They changed it because "Unlimited" isnt a value that can be modified for the sake of perks like Open Handed. It is consistent with the new terminology the devs are using on perks to avoid confusion. They are attempting to fade out the use of subjective terms like Moderately, Tremendously etc for raw numbers. 
---
I am playing on xbox. Version 2.5.4. When game into finishes and it says "Press A to continue," pressing A does nothing. My controller works fine and pressing A will allow me to skip the intro as well. 
---
Love the add-ons. As for the perks, am I correct in assuming this is a generator defense build? 
---
Consider throwing in Nurses Calling. Super helpful for finding folks through walls.
---
Maybe replace Overcharge with it. As you climb people will be able to hit that check reliably so it won't be as useful.
---
Ever since devs changed some stuff to have more position checks on the host side, speed hacks from Survivors look a lot like lag teleporting. 
---
It wasn¬¥t terrible at all yeah. I mean, sometimes i waited 5-6 mins, but compare to other guys it was still "good" :)
---
Pig's a killer? Ok, I thought she was just like Claudette, crouching all the time with urban evasion. 
---
Jake. Jake Park keeps me coming back. Love my Korean snack.
---
Any amount of camping at rank 1 is too much camping.  Insidious camping is for players brand new to the game that haven't learned to play yet and trash killers.  You are pathetic for intentionally going into games with the mindset to camp with that perk.  Also who the fuck are you kidding man currently it is stupid easy to pip while camping if you play enough games.  The current pip system is a joke for killers that's why they're changing it next patch.
---
I don‚Äôt have too bad of a time with stake out. But with autodidact I have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting a single skill check. 
---
In the PTB, some players were remarkably good with her. She has a learning curve, but is very strong once you master the "skilled instadown."
---
Sorry for rant, it wasn't directed personally at you
---
I‚Äôm the same way. Everybody could bring thickest mist, purple flashlights, tbag me and slap my balls, but if one person bring BPS, bring on the pain.
---
Yeah, I feel like it'd be more viable with a more defensive build. Playing wraith super aggressive is harder on me, especially I usually play Spirit and especially Huntress. I'm not good at playing Aggro anyways. 
---
What do you suggest if
---
 it is not the best build?
---
Do you use headphones?  Try unplugging them and plugging them back in after 10 seconds.  Windows occasionally loves to let the audio endpoint builder get to massive memory footprints, related to headphones for some reason. 
---
Says the p3 claudette with sprint burst
---
Insert comment about inserting a comment about inserting a comment about inserting a comment about inserting a comment about inserting a comment about Nea .
---
now this is right proper shit posting
---
DC is equivalent to murder, didn't you know?
---
Oh yeah I agree dodging lobbies constantly definitely needs to be punished, it‚Äôs spiting any swf. The issue is that currently killers have a warning when swf load in together, but by taking it away things are only going to get more imbalanced in that you‚Äôll never know they have comms advantage unless they make it obvious. I‚Äôve been convinced this rough idea would cause more harm than anything but something needs to be done because indirectly helping swf (Strategy wise) at this point makes things needlessly more difficult 
---
That may be so, but she was still a nurse. In fact, she may have been better educated than a madman everyone called doctor.
---
Lil' baby survivors ready to whine
---
Oh that makes sense. Didn't think of that. Thanks!
---
Don't insult my favorite character in AHS like that!
---
Sometimes when the killers drops me I'm like "Oh, he doesn't want to hook me maybe he's nice and he wants to farm"... Then I get mori'd.  :( 
---
Good thing if it's Myers. Especially when I'm playing shirtless David - Daddy murders Daddy, perfection. 
---
Jeff
---
Do you hate gens? 
---
Restart app
---
Ouch, yeah, she was pretty cool, but noboby has as much style as *insert any Jessica Lange character*
---
Claudette for next killer confirmed.
---
I thought HL3 was the official sign of Jesus' return? 
---
Mine?
---
But the Spirit never killed anybody is what I‚Äôm saying. Phillip did kill someone, and yes they were a murderer, but Spirit is probably the most innocent of them all
---
To protect the blood point economy, whatever the fuck that means. 
---
Yeah, this pisses me off. I'll be doing a gen and another person runs by me without the killer even chasing them, drops the pallet right next to me, and low and behold the killer runs by because he was alerted.
---
If you're having trouble defending gens, I would suggest to get rid of all those perks and just slug survivors. And get Hex: Ruin. It sucks, but it's better than any of those perks. 
---
Also, I would use Swift Hunt and Windstorm as your add-ons. You probably won't have a lot of time to kick gens honestly. If you're spending time looking and kicking gens, that's more time a surv is repairing another gen. And you put no pressure on them by kicking things. 
---
If you really wanted to keep this build, (which you can), get rid of Surveillance. It's one of the worst perks in the game. At this rank, you can replace it with Discordance and you would get a lot more use out of it. Good luck.
---
Which is an excellent game! 
---
Maybe I'm thinking of the hook timer
---
What is your craziest lag(switch) experience?  I remember getting instadowned from the other side of the suffocation pit by Billy back in the days. I just randomly flopped to the ground :D
---
I like the new Nea skin in the last panel.
---
*Remember to laugh at the originality of said joke*
---
At least you didn't take a big break and wind up stuck in the 20-16.
---
I think it was 2
---
Then punish repeated DCs, there‚Äôs no excuse for ruining the experience of others 
---
I bought it because it will be good against tunneling in the future.
---
Aside from Michael, Laurie, and Leatherface even if BHVR were to somehow get licensing the characters would probably still be limited to what they have in their movies which isn't much. Quentin appears in 1 movie, Tapp appears in a movie and a half, remake Freddy appears in 1 movie, Amanda only has 1 costume and since she's labeled as the pig can't exactly wear much else.
---
Michael and Laurie have dozens of different looks and leatherface has a couple different outfits too at least.
---
Flashlight saves
---
I think he just didn't understand how this format work
---
Hopefully you‚Äôre wearing all the fly skins on him. 
---
You have one, it's called "Small Game" 
---
But legion is a survivor.
---
I got to survivor 2 and killer 5 last time. 
---
Yes I do all this. Doesn't really help most of the time. 
---
Kinda naive summary too, I just hope its a copypaste.
---
Hilarious that you think blood and moaning is used to track survivors too. Its not, at all. Stuff such as nurses and whispers are used.
---
Sucks but at least they‚Äôre not holding the game hostage
---
Because they are too lazy to rework the shitty add-on system, so to prevent everyone from getting a million broken as hell high tier add-ons and realizing just how poorly balanced the game actually is, they have to keep bloodpoint gains low so that everyone is only running around with a few high tier add-ons and a bunch of mid tier add-ons.  That way they can pretend there‚Äôs some kind of balance by saying ‚Äúwell you won‚Äôt see these add-ons all that often so you shouldn‚Äôt complain.
---
Well i mean...if there was a perk that let you set up a tent with a campfire. Even give the killer your playing as a little animation for cooking food i think i'd camp every game. 
---
I agree
---
It's still fairly good for points. Especially with the Red Twine.
---
You... Just don't spend them. 
---
Do people really have that little impulse control? 
---
who is ochido?
---
Make Your Choice 
---
The Entity wants to play a game.
---
They better pick this one.
---
GUYS buff noed. 
---
They never saw it not coming
---
Yes I run this until I get to purple ranks for that reason.  
---
"See! You're all fucking useless!!!"
---
Yea I've made her run around the whole map most of the game. Even tho I wasn't toxic and did not taunt her in front of pallets she had the need to punnish me :(
---
Folks who facecamp for a living could give a flying shit about points, kills, ranks.  That's why camper punishment mechanics and perks don't work. 
---
Hell yea
---
I have almost everything except for the long hair cosmetics, since they rubberband so badly 
---
Wait why do you have a broken key with a weaved ring and milky glass. That key can‚Äôt even open the hatch lol
---
This is "normal" for low ranks
---
Yep! My gt is Oh Hi Dark. Last of us is probably my favorite game of all time. So I loved seeing the name on Xbox! 
---
Also it was already 128m but just said unlimited. So it's more of a tooltip fix than an actual change.
---
Source: from the dev's Twitter
---
When gates are open, it's not like the killer has many goals left beyond "securing a last kill", especially if all 4 Survivors are up.  It's pretty much impossible to keep both doors excluded, and he honestly has a better chance of pulling out a "win" from folks coming to save than he does watching Survivors waggle their dicks at him from the mystery hedge. 
---
LOL the trapper flair just says it all. Are you stupid enough to really believe in the "cleanse totems" meme? 
---
As an Australian you will always be fucked. From you to the next locations with many people its pretty much a certain 300+ ping. The whole Oceanian region barely gets 40 million people. Thats half the population of germany. 
---
Had 7 sec left in the lobby and picked the wrong key lol
---
I am pathetic for wanting to enjoy the game as a stealthy killer without playing Wraith or Pig? Right. Also, I don't go in games with the mindset to camp someone on the hook, I go in with the midset to catch the survivors off guard so I don't have to walk around with my ginormous TR. I already stand at least 16 meters with Insidious behind cover, so it's not like I am tryharding. I've already gotten to rank 1 many times with on average killing 2-3 survivors by controlling chases and pressuring gens and I want to try something new in rank 1.
---
Insidious does always mean the killer is facecamping scumbag, but I guess the meme has been engrained with you.
---
Much appreciated
---
Well I don't have access to most of the teachable perks. I have all of the Nurse's, Huntress', Spirit's, Pig's and Legion's, so some of these perks won't even be viable. 
---
As for Overcharge, that may be the right thing to do, but I don't think I's need Brutal Strength because of my addons, that is why I steered clear of it. When I play Huntress, her Hex usually stays up pretty long, but I've never made it out of green ranks, so I guess that could be a bit of a problem.
---
In the Normal game, I am hoping to use this as my build:
---
‚Ä¢ A Nurse's Calling
---
‚Ä¢ Hex: No One Escapes Death, Hex: Devour Hope or Rancor
---
‚Ä¢ Sloppy Butcher
---
‚Ä¢ Surveillance 
---
But that build above is trying to imitate my defensive-type dreams lol. I've yet to actually test it.
---
I mean, who can leave without them :)
---
Had 7 sec left in the lobby and picked the wrong key like a noob
---
I love Surveillance, especially after it's nice rework, especially since Hex: Ruin is always hunted down and destroyed in the first minute of the game. 
---
And marking them with Surveillance is a good strategy if they just go to work on another because my scree will blaze yellow and my nice candled, fattass will go and wobble to them.   
---
The doctor doesn‚Äôt actually have a PhD, and the nurse was super poor in the 40s so probably wasn‚Äôt educated 
---
Turn the Xbox off. Unplug for about 10 seconds and then restart. If that doesn‚Äôt work uninstall and reinstall. 
---
How? She was a heroin junkie
---
Can't wait for season 2 and Allstars!
---
No look at their profile if they are in a party it‚Äôs swf. 
---
No he didn‚Äôt, his lore literally says he didn‚Äôt have a phd 
---
This is stupid, low effort, and not even funny. Why is this upvoted so much on this sub?
---
I don't use ds in it's current state because I think it's op and unfun to the killer, but I am definitely gonna start using it as soon as this chapter drops
---
&gt;	I guess it‚Äôs sheep mentality, the moment a popular streamer says something everybody agress with him
---
Not just *"a*" streamer. Literally every experienced streamer. Edgar was requiring a $120 donation in order for him to play Legion. I'm pretty sure Zubat only plays legion during his douchebat streams. 
---
Dia is the only streamer I've heard say they liked legion...but he almost never plays the game any more.
---
Everyone I've met that said they were okay with Legion...it turns out that they weren't even very good at the game in the first place. 
---
Yeah, but especially where I am, and my lack of access to Enduring and Bamboozle, I don't think those would be very useful to me, especially in chase, but I could see how those would help.
---
Spirit - schoolgirl outfit
---
&gt; not using bone clapper
---
Hmm
---
I feel this on an emotional level.
---
Console or PC? Because if console then it‚Äôs probably the display size which u can fix in settings
---
See you in top
---
Can people not see my flair?
---
sometimes they're in there for like 20 seconds tho
---
Spirit for two reasons; One: I am terrible at playing Nurse (being on console doesn't help but that's not entirely to blame) and Two: I like mindgames more than I like skipping parts of a chase.
---
It's literally the same distance, just changed the wording.
---
I play both but definitely nurse as she doesn‚Äôt have to deal with pallets and anything pretty much
---
I have no idea how underrated these are, but I always use empathy and dark sense 
---
This is driving me mad, what's FToH? I can't figure it out. 
---
But the game is made so that if you face camp all the time you won‚Äôt level up all that well. Once you realize you‚Äôre getting face camped pretty much all the gens should get rushed down. Holding games hostage as survivor is not something that goes away.
---
Whispers. The people that know how to use it know it's really useful, but there are a lot of people who don't get how whispers is effective. So, if you're not already using it, I'd suggest putting that perk in.
---
I think it has gotten some more use lately but spies from the shadows ids pretty good. Any survivor sprinting within 48 meters of you will almost always give them self away.
---
Fragrant Tuft or Hair. 
---
I love quick and quiet. There is nothing better to me then hopping in a locker and losing the killer instantly lol.
---
Please, he‚Äôd still be weak, just give him an instant Mori following dream transition. Then the survivors game uninstalls itself 
---
Maybe then he‚Äôd be a viable choice 
---
I seem to come across these killers all the time. Do well and STILL say salty/toxic things in chat
---
That would make que times worse. Their current fix is better where everyone spawns into lobby together so you can't tell if they're SWF or not.
---
So your only option for dodging is based on if you see 4 P3 bloody claudettes with flashlights or something. Which is rarer.
---
&gt; especially in Chase
---
That is exactly *when they are useful*
---
Put as many people to sleep as you can and abuse the wallhack+small radius to get hits and push people off gens. He's just an M1 in a chase, but he has decent game slow and stealth potential. Since he has wallhacks, you can drop chase to do things then pick it right back up.
---
I do actually, in my experience the killer doesn't hit the guy getting unhooked but actually are nice enough to get the guy unhooking.
---
I've been playing both and I can't grasp the nurse for the life of me. I do very well with spirit. What mind games do you play? I saw a video on it. 
---
Removed. Rule 1.
---
I would very well agree... minus the fatigue penalty. 
---
Botany Knowledge
---
What are some good tips? I've been back and forth with them all day. I've been failing with the nurse but not with the spirit. 
---
How do you give an offering? I knew you could give offerings to the entity, but the killer? 
---
By farm your team, you mean hide and have them try to do all the work? How can you tell who‚Äôs farming them? Example: I focus on gens unless I see someone hurt. If someone is hooked, I wait until I see the killer, then run over and save them. However, if someone brings the killer with them and they‚Äôre only half-healed, I run and hope we will find a safe place where I can finish healing. So, let‚Äôs say the killer never sees me. Couldn‚Äôt they think I was letting my team take all the risks? Should you aim to help someone within the killers‚Äô view? It seems dangerous.
---
Note: that rarely happens. I have pastel hair and clothes, so usually the killer will see me at gens or with other survivors. There have been cases however where I‚Äôve NEVER seen a particular teammate until gates are open. One guy was near the gate and wouldn‚Äôt even open it because he didn‚Äôt want to come out of hiding (I assume). Also, Claudette can be hard to see. One saved me when I thought for certain I was dead - I couldn‚Äôt see her at all when she got close and was no longer highlighted.
---
I do think it‚Äôs nice that people respect fair gameplay in most answers:)
---
Because tier memes are the hot posts right now. It isn't really that funny, but people must like it if they're upvoting it that much.
---
Cause big bias
---
Make your choice is fun. Equal chance of downing who I see first. 
---
Lobby pings are crazy. As killer it's not too bad, just have to wait for ~6-10 survivors to dodge for the lobby to have green ping people.
---
As survivor, having to constantly dodge people from across the planet is cheeks.
---
This really shows how toxic dbd is sometimes
---
You can use thing like overcharge and huntress lullaby to make the gens regress a ton when the fail a skill check the get out of dream state
---
I‚Äôm down as long as they don‚Äôt bring back the Open 5 gates with whichever survivor. Lot of BP but fuck that way annoying 
---
Pebble although I'm not sure how underrated it is but it definitely has helped me distract the killer so I could bail another direction. Ive had it help once with a camper where I threw it kinda close by and the killer went looking so I was able to actually unhook the person. But over all it makes the game fun again for me 
---
I feel that it is more fair to the survivors because of not they get upset about tunneling. 
---
Well if they want this game to continue to do as good don't you think they should entice the non casual players too? 
---
Well that depends.. Are you a survivor main, or a killer main? LoL
---
&gt;Lery's gives you the ability to completely cut off areas
---
As far as I know most places on Lery's are either too wide to trap or have multiple entrances (not to mention traps in doorways get disarmed instantly)
---
&gt;Did you not consider that one trap could be put on top of the stairs
---
Those are not the only windows in these houses + there are more pallets and windows than just the house ones not to mention nothing hides these traps so they also get disarmed instantly
---
&gt;For the game
---
You cannot cut off areas with one or two traps when the entrances are so wide and there are multiple of them not to mention traps in the open not hidden by anything get disarmed instantly. Not to mention picking up traps on the game is a big fucking hassle
---
&gt;Same with badham
---
Except not really because that boiler room loop isnt the only great loop on that map.
---
&gt;Most of the time 3 generators are an uncomfortable distance away
---
You can apply that to any map. Shelter woods has the advantage of having almost no pallets and being full of grass
---
To speak on what the Dev said - and now this would probably be harder on PC, but at least on PS4 I try and remember the names of players/killers I don't want to play with/against and \*\*I\*\* lobby dodge \*\*THEM\*\*. On PS4, at least if the killer is showing online, you can do a quick check of who you are playing against. If I see a killer name that tunneled or camped, I dodge their lobby. I played a match where I saw a fellow survivor crouched on the other side of the map while I was hooked, didn't come to get me and then waited for the hatch and made it out. They were in my lobby the next game - I left and dodged them. It's easier on console because we don't (usually) change our names. On PC though, can't people leave messages on their game play on their profile?
---
Wait, Trapper went to 1800s Russia to help her!?
---
What else has he done that we don't know about?
---
Still hit that skill check though lol
---
Trapper is a man of many worlds 
---
I have to agree with the camping statement. I was told flat out by a killer that the reason they camped me and another teammate was because we were "SWF and that's your karma".
---
PC
---
Me 
---
you can see task manager when you alt tab and the previews show up. alt tab, don‚Äôt let go of alt, tab over to task manager, remember where DBD task is, use the arrow keys to go down to it, then press tab until ‚Äúend task‚Äù is highlighted. then click space/enter.
---
I play on PC
---
That's why you'll occasionally get a mori daily
---
Well no, not a medical certificate but he had to have at least something to even apple for his job.
---
Okay, I didn't pay close attention. So, "nurse" is a very incorrect designation for her. But "The Orderly" doesn't sound very good.
---
As a nurse main. What I find that helps me get a bit more range is looking up and wiggling my mouse a bit. Idk if it truly does but that is what I do for a far hit and it seems to work 99/100 times for me.
---
My problem with whispers is that it's a tracking perk, but tracking isn't really an issue in the current meta. Nobody playes stealth, so finding people is easy. Survivors don't even try to hide. They just prepare for chases and try to max out their run potential with perks. Nobody builds for stealth. Survivors don't even bother concealing themselfs. Everyone is just sprinting everywhere, and they only leave the generator when I'm already within 5 meters of it. Whispers is great when people are hiding from you, but nobody does that.
---
Family members don't count.
---
Yeah too many killers are paranoid and salty over SWF because you get really toxic ones but that‚Äôs a fault with them and game balance, not some mates trying to have fun. People in general on this game are both the best and worst thing about it and that‚Äôs something no developer can fix, even with bans. Sorry to hear about that
---
There is one exception to this rule: Susie fan-art
---
Intentions of murder = murder
---
how to tell if someone mains survivor.  
---
1. if instead of saying "killers" they use the insult for killers.  
---
2. done.  
---
(**THIS IS A JOKE COMMENT**.)
---
Why can't I have one if I want one though? Why do we owe anything to survivors? I usually let the last one go anyways but I don't owe it to them at all. 
---
Life has many doors, Ed-boy. 
---
Had some toxic messages there too ingame chat would be funny af
---
Seconded for spine chill! Spine chill and urban evasion make it so much easier to effectively hop off a gen and hide before the killer actually gets a line of sight on you
---
Yeah after she married. She still had an education. We don‚Äôt know what Doc has but he had works for gov on top secret stuff. He *has* to have something.
---
My dad beats me is my go to.
---
Fastest uninstall in dbd 
---
Ah, good to know. Doc has a basic but interesting lore.
---
My husband and I play Legion which totally explains why we don't have kids. u/scarslookgood lol?
---
"Occasionally"
---
I love it. When i know i pissed someone off. 
---
Talkin shit is a whole other dynamic to competitive play. 
---
Anyone who cant handle it, should go play minecraft or somethin. 
---
Idk about questionable, there‚Äôs really not much question at this point on the fact he‚Äôs a racist anti-semite 
---
I would love Knock Out, but I allways think that people in a SWF group will just tell eachother where they are and completely negate the perk.
---
For me it‚Äôs about knowing where to not look. For example, on Billy at the beginning of the game. If you zip to a generator first thing and it doesn‚Äôt light up, you know to immediately move on.
---
I don‚Äôt. The only Ace cosmetics you can wear are the mustaches and the leopard print.
---
Lol
---
BBQ is the best for farming.  You get more xp for each unique play hook up to 4 and when you place someone on a hook get a chance to see player auras depending on distance.
---
How‚Äôd you get the color effect? It looks real snazzy
---
You forgot the DC
---
You know you've reached peak DBD reddit when someone tells you to run small game. 
---
Just to prevent a perk that someone might not even have. (Over, you know...much better perks out there).
---
Looks good. However, I‚Äôd recommend swapping overcharge or huntress lullaby for bamboozle. I know window loops can be very difficult for wraith. I usually don‚Äôt play him without it
---
oh, ok
---
BBQ is really good! you not only get knowledge of where people are at when hooking a survivor, you also get bonus bloodpoints for getting a hook on each individual survivor.
---
Franklins is a good counter to survivors with items such as keys, toolboxes, health packs. When your in a  lobby waiting for survivors to fill, evaluate what items if any they are bringing in, if you see a key or if 2-3 of them have toolboxes/health packs it might be worth your while to run Franklins.
---
*^^laughs ^^in ^^marie ^^laveau*
---
Random as hell for the perks. And not really effective. 
---
Wraith is a killer that specializes in stealth as opposed to chases, so frankly you don't need any detection perks on him if you ask me (Sans BBQ since it keeps your momentum strong).
---
Make use of his lack of a terror radius. My favorite build on him is Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling, BBQ, Ruin. Sloppy and Nurses makes it so they either don't bother healing, heal in my radius and I see it and pounce on them, or they flee WAAAY to the other side of the map where they don't think I'm at to heal, which will take even longer because of Sloppy. 
---
All three of those outcomes are beneficial to the killer. 
---
Why do I get downvotes for upvoting something I haven‚Äôt seen yet and enjoy lol
---
Thanks!
---
Coming from a survive only  player turned killer+surv, self-care was OP and too necessary for solo-queu and needed the nerf.  And if you really think the new DS hurts killers now I don‚Äôt get it; just don‚Äôt tunnel people, it‚Äôs really not hard.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll definitely check it out. Anything in particular to give me a definite sign that Franklin‚Äôs in needed? Flashlight maybe?
---
Why do they block skype and discord lol? 
---
Actually, not tunneling is the problem with the new DS and Dying Light. For me to get my Dying Light activated, I'd have to tunnel the current obsession otherwise there is some form of risk that the obsession will change.
---
I'm not dodging at all tbh, but there are too many people who are dodging for the sake of it, I'd prefer not to be matchmaked with them at all
---
Holy shit people upvoted this, yikes
---
I understand the joke as a native French speaker, therefore I don't know what killer "spectre" stands for as I play the game in English.
---
Did you need a reference for all those clothing folds or was that all from your head? Asking as an artist myself. 
---
It‚Äôs only holding the game hostage if she literally didn‚Äôt touch gens. As soon as you start tapping gens it‚Äôs no longer holding it hostage 
---
swap out *overcharge* for *make your choice* or *Barbeque and Chili* and *pop goes* for either *bamboozle*, *save the best*, or *A Nurses' Calling*.
---
 if you have an abundance of Moris, try *Dying light* in place of *Lullaby*.
---
Will smith: ahhhh that's hots

I'm on console. I heard it was harder on console.

1800‚Äôs? Huntress happened in the early 1900‚Äôs.
---
Not really lol. Most experienced players know how hard nurse is to learn. I personally support new nurses, takes a lot more courage than just... billy
---
Devs made a broken character that caters to skillless players. Of course assholes who are terrible at the game will flock to the character.
---
At least mlga is awesome.
---
next week
---
Okay, thanks everyone!
---
Yeah I think it is but there are people who don't think that. Why did I get so many downvotes? I was just saying there are quite a bit of people who think the exploit is intended and is justified
---
I wouldnt call it bad. When I lose a token it would help me know what perks that killer has and then counter it appropriately
---
If nothing else, I'd suggest Ruin instead of Lullaby. It's useful for slowing the game down, and Survivors will react to skill checks more proficiently the higher the rank. Huntress Lullaby is also not only useless if you don't manage to hook someone but also can be cleansed. Ruin can be used to leverage a little more presence in the early game, making finding survivors in the first place a little easier. 
---
But that's my opinion. I can certainly see the effectiveness of the combination with Pop Goes the Weasel and Lullaby. Either way, you do you. 
---
Other than that, Surveillance and Overcharge are absolutely perfect. They're the two best perks for generator defense and mix really well. Given that you're running Windstorm for easier Patrols and Shadow Dance for faster action, you can pretty much maximize both perks *and* Pop Goes the Weasel. So I'd say this build is very solid, at least on Wraith. 
---
The game slow is how you only have 50% repair and heal speed in the Dreamworld. Go ahead and stay in the dream world if you want to never repair a generator. 
---
Spine Chill literally gives you a higher chance of skill checks when the killer looks towards you.
---
You have issues.
---
Yeah and the entire time your repairing it 50% slower.
---
BBQ is basically double BP, and its effect is borderline overpowered on high mobility killers, allowing them for easy information on all survivors and to snowball easily. Franklins is okay, if you see 4 flashlights in lobby and dont have lightborn. Plus players tend to come back for their items, making it easy bait
---
Spine Chill literally does give you a higher chance of getting skill checks when  the killer looks towards you.
---
woah 
---
I mean I like salt in my diet as much as anyone else but come on that's too much. Gonna get hypertension dude.
---
Kinda feel sorry for killers and survivors who are that level of angry. 
---
Doesn't it only trigger on non-dull totems?
---
He didn't apply he was recruited out of high-school.
---
[Just read his lore.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Herman_Carter)
---
And what about the other 4 million people here? Do they apply too?
---
It definitely was a shitpost. Did get a few upvotes though lol
---
Yea, I've been working on both spirit and nurse. I get bullied with nurse. I beat down people with spirit majority of the time. Usually get the disconnects with her. I'm working my way to getting disconnects with the nurse, but I'm struggling on being punished by fatigue. 
---
I like the idea but wouldn't it take too long to write/read and you'd probably get killed in the process.
---
Somente pessoas com qi de 200000 podem entender isso
---
Ou brasileiros em geral
---
Again, not the point of the thread but sure.
---
I'm taking you down with me dude 
---
My guess would be that there is a very limited amount of loops on The Game. You can spend a few traps and basically make half the map unusable for survivors since there is usually only one loop per room on the upper level.
---
What about her being punished for fatigue or missing?
---
Or being slow as syrup?
---
And you'll never get better at the game because Legion doesn't require you to.
---
My main man!
---
Beautiful work, as always &lt;3
---
My opinion is that youre going to get looped to death vs decent survivors
---
That said I don't play Trapper so maybe the map is actually trash for him.
---
lol
---
I‚Äôve done most of my bucket list. I‚Äôll be fine.

Making me feel bad now, here have my like.
---
High School Story is the shit.
---
I played piggy vs them doing this strat on stream. Didn‚Äôt know who any of them were. Got into the game and yeah it was annoying as fuck and really frustrating but I got a 4K before they completed a gen.
---
After the game I said in chat ‚Äúnice toxic bully attempt lul‚Äù and them and half their stream chat proceeded to flame me. Lol yeah. Sure. You guys aren‚Äôt being toxic at all. Right.
---
Or just stop playing due to frustration?
---
Hey I didn‚Äôt downvote you
---
Yep, I just didn't wanted to outright say it. Dude has made so much sexist/racist/anti-semite/homophobic (and more!) stuff it is kinda obvious now.
---
Specifically 1918, the end of her bio mentions German soldiers on their way to attack the collapsing Russian Empire. Operation Faustschlag in 1918 was the last major Offensive against Russia, which met little resistance because Russian forces were preoccupied with internal turmoil.
---
huh
---
No,
---
We had just loaded in an I went to the killer shack to see if survivors spawned there, 3 survivors spawned there so I chased one. I managed to down a p3 claudette who DC'd instantly. I went back to the killer shack as there was a gen there I hit one of the survivors and chased him, he pallet stunned me and then I managed to down him. Instant DC from two survivors (they were the SWF) the last survivor popped a gen. The only reason I didn't let him live is because there was still another gen to do and I wanted at least 1 BBQ stack because I hadn't manage to hook anyone yet and had lost out on so many bloodpoints already. As soon as I saw him he pulled his ethernet and kept running into a wall I downed him and as soon as I picked him up he DC'd.
---
If they do it enough, they're banned, so it hopefully averages out eventually. Just sad you'll never know if it did.
---
I feel like you shouldn't be to upset about this. Once you get into the higher ranks it happens less and less. Just roll with it.
---
i hope they all said no homo afterwards 
---
Well then don't worry, this doesn't happen often (at least on PS4)
---
He missed it, it was just lag so the reaction took longer
---
Let me beat one off in front of you real quick
---
I have played 2 games as doctor so far (he is the best for point farming because shocks give you so many points) and had 7/8 people DC on me. It is literally aggravating.
---
*looks up ‚Äúhow to become your friend‚Äù*
---
hAhA lEgIoN = dC hAhA I‚Äôm So OrIginAl  
---
if you get given BP by the devs then it can be over 1 million.
---
not if you lost all of your progress.
---
well it works every single time for me.
---
I am not upset with the fact that is happened to me, I am upset by the fact that they will keep doing it and get away with it.
---
Mori: DC
---
Killer they don't like: DC
---
Killer has perk they don't like: DC
---
First downed: DC
---
SWF gets downed first: DC
---
Survivor Pudding: DC
---
Like why don't these people get punished. I have never purposefully DC'd on DBD, it ruins the fun for all the people playing. I hate when survivors do it when I am a survivor and I hate when survivors do it to me when playing killer. 
---
...I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre saying the same thing I said. 
---
You can‚Äôt get legacy back if you lost your save. 
---
People are saying his BP might be from a save corruption compensation. 
---
But if his save file got corrupted, he would not have 9 pieces of legacy. 
---
So he hacked one or the other, possibly both. 
---
meant to say SOME, sorry.
---
RIGHT :D Its so BM to look at him and see how he is shaking that old bottle
---
Fuck you for playing the game you paid for how you want. BHVR ban this man!
---
So when Vince does Pallet Peggy, it's reportable?
---
Saying that this is a doodle really grinds my gears.
---
This is not a standard for doodles! A doodlebob is a doodle. Those scribbles from FHIF are doodles. Anything taking less than 1 hour of class is a doodle. This would take me 1 day in the least to produce! 
---
but yeah someone lost 500 hours of progress, but they kept 3000 hours of bloodpoints. the devs gave them way too many bloodpoints (180 million) and they kept 3 full legacies and some other legacies.
---
it looks like her feet are backwards and the skintone is a bit too light imo. but other than that good job :)
---
He wasn‚Äôt a Doctor but comparing those 2 killers in intelligence is dumb. When it says it‚Äôs a front I think it means that the CIA set that up and people majored in that were selected to be put in Lery‚Äôs. Doctor went to Yale, just that it was a part of a CIA program no? I dunno.
---
Tana mongeau be like
---
üëèüëèüëè
---
Also BBQ is kinda overrated, I mean the info is great and all but really the only good use for it is that it doubles your BP-gain.
---
because they don‚Äôt want the grind to be too easy.
---
As a survivor, there is nothing scarier than the last gen poping while the killer gets close to you just to see a dull totem light up at the corner of your eye.
---
He is still smarter than Rin and shouldn‚Äôt even be put in her category. We don‚Äôt know the specifics of Doc‚Äôs education but I‚Äôm almost certain the CIA wouldn‚Äôt force their best college student to drop out. He might have got his degree in neuroscience early or something.
---
Then you are part of the problem. I wasn't even doing a 3 gen strat I was just using one of Docs best builds. I didn't report them I wish I could, that is what this post is about, the fact that people ruin other peoples fun because they can't be bothered to play. If you can't be bothered to play kill yourself on the hook but don't DC to fuck the killer over, the only thing DCing does is encourage more DCing.
---
Yeah saw that after I commented. Explains the exorcist Claudette 
---
Doesn't matter, the meme is great anyway :D
---
thanks lol
---
&gt;Knockout.
---
It's insane on Billy and Nurse especially, I also like it on Huntress.
---
&gt;Whispers.
---
It's not really "underrated" IMO but a lot of people seem to think it's bad 
---
&gt;Shadowborn.
---
FoV is just so nice.
---
&gt;Monitor and Abuse.
---
Helps on some killers, I always run it on Hag, LF and Trapper.
---
&gt;STBFL
---
Fucking disgusting on Hag and Doctor.
---
Woah he actually kinda looks like young Nick Castle. Minus the injured eye and we got an almost perfect match.
---
"Offering" a vague term referencing an old practice from the early days. If a survivor is bold enough, they will sometimes approach the killer, press R to put down their item, and crouch in front of the killer waiting. Some killers may ignore it, but some may see it as a peace offering and let them go. It really depends.
---
Farming generally is obvious if they keep uhooking the person right infront of you. As someone who's been farmed before that boils my blood and immediately makes the unhooker a target.
---
Without going into detail of all of the responses you got, I'm gonna go on a limb and assume people are suggesting meta perks like BBQ or Nurse's
---
Of course, you could go with the tried-and-true meta, but this setup is focused on a specific playstyle, somewhat situational. The thing about situational perks is that they are great for the situations they're for. 
---
This means that as long as you pay a healthy amount of attention to to generators while slowly wittling down survivors, you'll do just as well, maybe better, and you'll have more fun doing it. 
---
Nice repost
---
thanks I try
---
Why not take a pic?
---
What I mean is, I find someone within 30 sec of match starting almost allways, since they just run around. After I hook them I just go to someone I see with BBQ and chili, or very often they are already obviously lurking around the hook and I find them before I can even leave the hook.
---
I'd rather explain DBD than the first season of AHS
---
Hope. No matter what happens in the endgame, you will blue ball the killer. Makes looping super easy, and you will buy enough time for your team to open gates and heal up. Not once did I manage to make it from one gate to the other while being chased.
---
As all playtime should be.
---
2 hours? What are ya;an art major?
---
Wait, can spine chill wake you up from the dream world? 
---
Wraith doesn't need much chase assistance from perks or addons. His ambush potential is great, and with a generator defense build like this, you'll be whittling down survivors as you go anyway. 
---
Bing bong boys a killer? I thought he just played music for survivors while they did gens
---
Yes but no one gets banned for it. Everyone knows that it is based on % so they DC then go "better not DC for the next 3 games to make up for that DC" then as soon as those games are over and they run into something they don't like the instantly DC again.
---
Yeah, and I do use some like A Nurse's Calling, but many of the other perks I have are either locked or I can't get them since I don't have the killer. 
---
That is why I *try* to experiment with builds, but at the same time, I seldom have people to test it against unless I already have the perks
---
Not if noed is in play
---
Spine Chill increases the chance of a skillcheck (also boosts action speeds) while the killer is looking at you. 
---
Happened to me last night. Had a connection with a Dwight. Did gens together but then the killer used a Mori on me and Dwight Tbagged me. Felt so betrayed lmao
---
Spirit 100%. But my favorite combo is Pig and P3 Tapp. 
---
Oh thank god, I always forget to check those.
---
Yup, looks about right.  That shit's cancer lol 
---
I hope you're paying attention to what's happening in this comment section, OP. Survivors are entitled shit brained brats. Never give them a fucking inch
---
ahaaa, rank reset is life, get rekt.
---
I use lightweight a lot. And there have been more than a handful of times when I‚Äôve managed to break line of sight and the Killer just couldn‚Äôt find me, which saved my life. 
---
Premonition plays the sound effect when you're looking at the killer, and has a cooldown. Spine Chill is silent, but lights up when the killer is looking at you. It also increases your action speed, skill check chances, and decreases success zone
---
Wow you must get very nice killers. 90% of killers will tunnel your injured ass.
---
Best advice I can give is don't run from them when they do that, try to force the chase to continue. They're counting on letting your timer tick down, if you prevent that, they need to waste time frenzying you.
---
The chase ends much slower while you're in the terror radius, which is why moon-walking is mostly pointless.
---
If they back away, follow them. If they moonwalk towards you, get in front of them to trigger the chase again. They either need to run away from you to force the chase to end, which can take a while, or they need to give up and just continue the chase, which you should be prepared for, make sure there's a loop nearby.
---
If they run directly away and do manage to end the chase, start mending at the closest safe spot, and force the chase again when they come back. Continue the mend whenever you get the opportunity. If there is a good enough spot nearby, try to start mending right away, you should finish before it gets low enough for them to down you.
---
Legion is incredibly weak at time efficiency, so forcing the chases to be longer, even by one extra hit, will really hurt their pressure.
---
Source: I am one of those legions. I don't moonwalk, but I do back off and then follow the blood (which is 10 times more effective btw). This is how people fuck with me most effectively.
---
Thanks I‚Äôve got whispers one tho so is that a good idea?
---
Wait; what's the point of blurring your name in the menu but not in chat?
---
Jokes on him, aids wouldn't be an issue because she would be dead in a fire.
---
For me its the opposite ive encountered several toxic killers but literally lost count of toxic survs. And my bar for toxic is prettty high i dont even consider purple flashlights or ds toxic.
---
2774 is baby hours for a game released in 2016 so please don't act like it means anything, considering I've played more and don't think it means much. Next you'll say you're rank 1.
---
If you're not prepared to combat decked out SWF, then the build isn't good enough.
---
I knew he was handsome
---
Pallet Peggy?
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Legion = DC for me. On to the next game. Your fault for wasting money/shards on such a crap killer. 
---
If I see art on this subreddit 99% of the time it's stolen art, just report and hope mods will learn how to mod someday
---
Reporting disconnects does nothing, they supposably track disconnects and if your % is high enough you get an autoban
---
Depends what survivors you play against. In red ranks I would recommend one or two chase perks otherwise just go with standard slowdown and tracking combos.
---
Ahhh, okay. Thanks for clearing that up. 
---
I‚Äôm rank 16 I‚Äôm not that good lol
---
Share the link fam
---
Source?
---
Oohhhh, okay. I guess there‚Äôs always new stuff to learn with this game, thanks for clearing that up 
---
I've seen more toxic survivors as survivor, mostly people farming hooks. I really wish they'd make it so if your hook is downed within so and so seconds or so and so meters from the hook, you lose points.
---
Of course the situation is different, I'm a Rank 17 Killer facing Red Rank survivors, and some legitimately feel bad. When I'm a Red Rank survivor with other Red Rank survivors and a Red Rank killer, there's generally a lot more toxicity from campers and hook farmers. When the 2 cross paths, it *really* ruins the game.
---
I didn't save the post officer
---
Based on that response, you seem like the kind of person that believes only Nurse/Billy is viable at red ranks and that NOED/BBQ are mandatory while SWF are OP and need to be nerfed, eh?
---
If you actually have many hours invested, then you'd know that none of what I just wrote in the first half of this comment is the case in-game.
---
(Also, yes, Rank 1)
---
everybody talkin about nea and you left the fuckin plague out what a terrible tier list. Reported
---
Ohgod there's a lot of stuff. Basically, they've been focusing more on the OWL (Some of the teams quit a while ago to go play things like Apex) and have been churning out the same events with nothing new aside from maybe competitive CTF. To attract attention to the game, they're also doing things like throwing in gay characters as a clutch without rhyme or reason. They're also adding more shitty characters to the game (IE Brigitte, who they took their time fixing even when she was released in comp, which lead to a lot of crappy plays) and causing the entire role system to ultimately collapse.
---
Imma have you arrested young man
---
There's almost too much to know in this game, lol. Play around with different perks you wouldn't normally use, you can find some interesting combos, bro
---
Running a full build to get auto didactic to work, including empathy to see hurt people and Sprint burst so you can get to them fast...
---
Sure I got to 5 stacks, but that was while healing in the exit gates, and the killer was nodding at us.
---
5.total.skillchecks. 
---
BEEN HERE ALL ALONG 
---
Ruin, BBQ, Sloppy Butcher and Monitor + Abuse is my tryhard build 
---
Cigar box is the most fun addon btw, makes it ridiculously blurry for survivors 
---
You wanna know satisfaction? Get a game with devour hope going and, beating the odds on a hex here, let that phucc chase you like you dont know. Than the second you hit the 3 stacks, blow his damn mind. Feels *amazing*.
---
xd
---
Anything can sound bad without context
---
Chasing the killer and suicide is the same as dc'ing for the survivor. Only that it takes more time. People won't take in consideration "Oh, let me give points to this killer first", instead will think "Fuck this guy, I'm out"...
---
If your argument was that they had to try anyways to not ruin the fun for 4 people I would agree. But, " if you don't like the game you are in chase the killer down and suicide on the hook if you REALLY don't want to play it, but know that doing that fucks over your entire team " is stupid in my opinion.
---
In the end I never dc, so idc.
---
His weakness is getting around the map to pressure objectives and survivors, so he needs slowdown perks (at least one) and tracking to maintain pressure. Whatever you like. Ruin and Bbq works on every killer and gives you 2 more slots. In purple ranks, Bbq, Overcharge, Pop goes the Weasel and surveillance is a great shutdown gen build for Clown.
---
In red ranks you‚Äôll find people who are better at looping him and on literally 2 maps I would want bamboozle, but it‚Äôs useless otherwise. Go with Brutal strength as only pallet vaults are still fast while survivors are gassed, and good survivors know this and will drop pallets early and use them if you don‚Äôt break them; so BS is my personal first chase perk I pick for Clown (at rank 1).
---
This is fucking great I‚Äôd love to see it on r/perfectlycutscreams
---
Waiting times seem fine for me actually.
---
The legion is the easiest killer to beat. Unless the legion is running, hex ruin, noed,discordance and Thanatophobia you have 0 reason and I repeat 0 reason to lose or DC. I‚Äôm a survivor main and I‚Äôve literally only lost to legions who run that build. 
---
more like THOT  
---
BEGONEEEEEEEE
---
Do you turn down a free meal? Then concept is no different. I at least report them at the end for griefing. 
---
r/thetruth
---
Imma yeet myself out
---
No.
---
Nah, Freddy is its seperate tier "Freddy". I don't accept this.
---
What‚Äôs it like having everyone dc on your unskilled ass?
---
I think it‚Äôd be easier if you did something like FToHair or something like that
---
If you want to upset survivors, using legion along with franklins demise is hilarious. 
---
I swear that is me.
---
Full stacks of Pwyf, Beast marks, and scratch marks.
---
Waiting... 
---
I‚Äôm not betting offended. I‚Äôm trying to have a discussion. I have seen countless videos and none of them say a word about NOED being good on legion. Hell, Bricky did an entire video saying why almost no perks work on him. 
---
You‚Äôre not even a PC player, how would you even begin to disclaim what I said about the steam community? 
---
This meme is saying that they start cleansing the totem and realize the killer has ToTH because the totem cleansing in slowed, so now they are screaming because they don't know what hex totem ToTH is defending.
---
The Japanese PlayStation Twitter account supposedly leaked the date of the 20th. Thanks to timezones, this could mean it releases Tuesday afternoon/evening in the West.
---
Overcharge by itself is terrible.  It needs to be combined with other things like unnerving and a terror radius build or with lullaby and TOTH.
---
Tuesday is when it always releases on consoles and yes its due the 20th
---
Because I can still scroll through them on my phone. There is a steam app after all
---
It is.
---
Rage Quitting comes under "Unsportsmanlike Conduct".
---
Noed hasn't ever helped me either. It gets cleansed so its not even a big deal. 
---
Ok cool hook em
---
Ha..Ha..Funny ps4 is probably the second most salted/toxic out of the platforms
---
After rank reset I was put at rank 19 because I stopped playing killer for a while, and when I hopped on to play this week, a lot of people DC‚Äôd or suicided when played as Hillbilly, The Pig, and Doctor. And along with many messages of misspelled words telling me I sucked and to play better killers. 
---
The theorized date is the 19th due to how fast Spirit/Legion released after their PTBs 
---
The Entity's work
---
All they need to do is take away the "0 cooldown on missed attacks". Outplaying the legion means nothing, because they just jet to start running and stabbing at you again without penalty. 
---
Me when I run aftercare
---
Until the little shits start using it to dump the killer on me instead
---
I read it just fine.
---
Then chances are you either got unlucky with totem spawns or youre not putting pressure where you should. Assuming one is on hook, another goes to save and one to rescue, theres only one to screw around and if you dont spent too much time chasing them you should be good
---
im
---
If you camp or tunnel, you‚Äôre a bitch. It‚Äôs not rules, people who just are not total tossers dont like to be treated like one.
---
That's not even close to a clown inspired map. It's better off as the Plague's map than the Clown.
---
You could just.....adapt better strategies instead of relying on spam drop though.
---
Man you nailed that! I‚Äôve had a legion do that to me! 
---
Detective's hunch 
---
I have gone through the steam forums multiple times and none of them say anything about NOED being good on him. 
---
Ok cool hook em 
---
What? Father Campbell‚Äôs Chapel was released with Clown. 
---
You forgot the Mori on the last pic but everything else is spot on! 
---
Dunno why you say baby survivors use DS as a crutch, the only time DS has been helpful to survivors is when they're good at running the killer around. If they're bad, then DS won't do much.
---
Usually it's t-bagging in general that warrants it, but if the surviviors are generally making my game harder by sabotaging my hook or something, then I'll consider it. It's not common in my games for me to encounter such behavior, so I can't really point out specific things.
---
Does BHVR actually not understand that good ping lobbies are more desirable than instant queue times?
---
We want QUALITY MATCHES, not FASTER (AND LOW QUALITY CONNECTIONS).  
---
Wait that means nurse and spirit are gods? ALL PRAISE OUR GODS NURSE AND SPIRIT
---
"Huur insta down hatchets cause they aim like gods and take me down easily before i attempt a juke". 
---
Seriously, the only ones i can think of are any Nurse blink addons and Clown's insta-down because he can just spam a few botles on you to slow you and make you easier to hit, and as long as he isn't a brainlet he will get a direct hit with one of them, and even that is not too consistent.
---
Yeah, so far that's the issue I have most. I generally lose people pretty fast because I struggle to predict where they're going to go. I suppose that is something I'll end up learning with time though. Thank you! 
---

You can run to a pallet and bait the respect, that's like 15 secs more, if you do that 2 times+ the speed burst from the speed, you can easily get out, you just need to hide
---
Well he *does* have amazing awareness about what survivors are doing when he's played right.. that's something none of the others can really brag about
---
Unpopular opinion .
---
&gt;I don't think BHVR knows how 'geolocation' works if the ENTIRE southern hemisphere is considered a region to them.
---
You must forgive them, they're from Quebec.
---
I would say I don't have this happen to me, but A, I rarely play killer, and when I do I'm usually very fair 
---
And B, when I play survivor I make it a point to not play with more then one random
---
Also, when legion is on feral frenzy he cant see scratch marks and when ure mending you dont do too much noise
---
This is the hardest part of killer! It‚Äôs 4v1 so you need to be aware of where they are and what they‚Äôre doing, and try to force actions from survivors that isn‚Äôt gens.
---
Condoms are not 99% effective
---
Aw Michael my sweetheart 
---
Can you do Spine Chill next? I would love to see more of your work! :D Or We'll make it? 
---
"Yo trust me, i have been rank 1 survivor since day one, figuring out every strategy there is to counter all killers, that includes Legion, and let me tell you there is so much untapped potential when it comes to countering them. What? Want an example!? Well i don't have one, but they totes can be countered."
---
Probably them coming up with an answer.
---
If that privacy thing works woohoo! I hope it doesn't mean I have to make my profile public. But, for the evening of that game that will be fine.

üòÇThis game is such a fuckin troll

Imagine not escaping and missing out on 5000 bp cause you cleansed totems instead of doing gens or distracting the killer for your team
---
I like it too! :D
---
This. Or when you're looping the killer on a window or downed pallet and it activates and the killer thinks you didn't jump.

The op makes a passing joke on what they think the state of Legion posts are like honestly, did not see any hate coming from them, just a shitpost on what gets downvoted. 
---
So it's rather fiting i in turn use this
---
r/woosh
---
There's nothing to argue when all everyone ever says is "no counterplay lol". Yes, counterplay, fucking do gens away from each other. It's a killer where your whole team has to deal with it, not you on your own. 
---
Yall gonna fucking cry with Plague too. Maybe not immediately, but give it a few weeks and yall cry "no counterplay" again just because she can spit over terrain.

u don't get banned for deranking, so long as u play enough games to balance out the ratio of completed matches/dc's

KILL HIM! KILL HIM NOW!! 
---
You just bounce off of that guys comment with no addition. Well done.
---
It's about not wating time on approaching for gens nobody's on. It really lets you save a lot of times, especially for killers like Huntress(super slow and easy to hide from because of humming) and Pig (you don't waste time on crouching to a gen nobody's on).
---
I DON'T SEE NEA!!!  FAKE RANKING!!
---
is it bad if i farm AND deliberately body block as david?
---
If you're at rank 16, then you should use perks that rank 20-13 Survivors can't deal with very well. Like Sloppy (or Sulfuric Acid Vial) or Overcharge. At those ranks, you can use practically anything with a Killer and they'll work fine. It's when you get further down where you'll need to run a more strict build.
---
Trapper is a free character and his power is wayyy simpler and easier, plus he‚Äôs just better than leatherface. You have to pay for leatherface, which most people won‚Äôt do if they‚Äôre just starting to play killer. Leatherface May have some good perks but he‚Äôs not as good as trapper. That instadown is only good if the survivors are caught in the open.

---
Which killer are you currently playing? I would suggest Michael Myers, he isn't to complex or difficult.
---
"Oh please no, why me? I suck at looping on this map! I don't want my team to suffer because of it!'
---
Pretty much my thoughts when back when more Freddy players used to run this combo, always getting the worst maps too.
---
I played all up until the past Chinese New Year, so I did play Bridgette (and I HATE playing against her, I'm a Mercy main \*forever my girl!!!\* and my husband is a Lucio main and he hates going against her as well). That was the first event we missed since it released so it was a little sad but it wasn't pulling us in to play as much as it used to. I also didn't like how the events were the same and some of the skins just aren't as good. You know they have plenty of skin idea's people work on. I wish they would have a contest like best skin will actually be made into the game (and I would love for DBD to do something like that as well!)
---
They need to bring in something other than just golden weapons now, I'm sure there are some people who already have it for all the characters or most of them by now. 
---
Spirit is more user friendly, but Nurse overall is superior when you can actually play her well.
---
Because putting 1 survivor to sleep and then committing to a chase is a waste of your power. A good freddy has multiple people asleep at all times. If he lets 3 people do gens without applying pressure the game is over quickly
---
For the addon. I like do8ng inverse wraith. You have a terror radius when cloaked, but when you uncloak it goes silent.

This is the quality shitposts I come here for.

Wait, so what is fun to you? At least while playing this game?
---
I don't know what's more sad: the amount of memes I don't recognize or the amount of memes I do.
---
It does.
---
i once spawned close to another survivor who when we met up started t bagging together. The pig saw this and creeped up nodded and started teabagging too. A special bond was forged that day. 
---
Offering a daily little meme recreation with DBD characters and models : Outstanding move you wonderful person!
---
It‚Äôs almost as if many killers think survivors just need to run in a straight line from them, and survivors hating killers for actually killing them. The reality is that the game is a 1v4 game, two sides. That said I avoid being outright toxic, that is, doing things to deliberately drain people‚Äôs fun when it isn‚Äôt tactically the best thing to do
---
I wish I loved playing killer more, but it actually gives me a little bit of anxiety, so I am glad there are people who love playing killer as much as you. And I always love seeing different perks other than ruin. Sure it's a nuisance, but when it's not ruin, you always have to wonder.... well what else could it be? There could always be Devour Hope or even Third Seal (which is such a pain!! I know some people say it's not a good perk but if you're not in SWF, you can be easily forgotten about on the hook and left for dead.... which happened to me during a game not too long ago. It was so sad) and of course, NOED. It's almost a given if there is no ruin, there's NOED and NO ONE EVER GETS THE TOTEMS!
---
What do you play on? Maybe I've played against you! (that would be super fun)
---
Well, Huntress was born pre-20th century, as she was killing Germans in WW1 as a woman and not a teenager.  Also since Hag‚Äôs map is a rickety old paddle steamer and we don‚Äôt use rickety old paddle steamers any more outside of tourist novelties, I imagine that she‚Äôs almost certainly from 1840-1880.
---
First of all, it's r/woooosh - You missed two Os.
---
Secondly the entire point of my post was to agree that Legion posts are lazy and made entirely for free karma.  
---
So r/woooosh to you my friend.
---
Yes Spirit and Nurse might be GOD tier however i think Hag is not as good as Billy and Huntress and should swap positions with Myers. He is indeed better than her. Also Trapper and Wraith should be swaped, since Trapper is not as bad as Freddy, Wraith and Legion. Maybe put the Clown higher but overall this is a good, 6/10 tier list.
---
He was fast-tracked, so they probably handed him a degree and a job contract at the same time. 
---
Yea, I'm ways getting juked unless I catch them on a straight away.
---
Great concept, I really like it!
---
People who DC make the game less fun for every person in the match and dare I say it complete assholes.
---
Starting out as killer, unlocking teachable perks is going to be the biggest thing. BBQ and Chili and Discordance are great tracking perks. Hex: Ruin is pretty much mandatory on many killers. 
---
DamnNoHTML has a great video on youtube called "How to run generic tiles" or something to that effect that shows how to deal with various loops as a killer.
---
Killers is all about efficiency and time management. Gens get done extremely fast when survivors actually work on them, and it typically gets faster as you progress in rank. 
---
As for which killer to start with, it really won't matter, in my opinion. That being said, your standard killers like Wraith or Pig are pretty accessible. Nurse, Billy, and Spirit are very technical. Set-up killers like Trapper and Hag have a decent learning curve. 
---
Agreed.
---
Yes...but I play on ps4
---
That's not a cleaver. Nah, that looks like an executioner's axe...
---
Sadly being competitive can optimize the fun out of the game.
---
nice curtains
---
thanks, floral is just that good ‚ú®
---
Didn't even need to go through College, either.
---
You are misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm not saying putting multiple people to sleep and then chasing one of them.
---
I'm talking about finding someone, sleeping them and then going away even tho you can chase them/get a hit/down them. It's only prolonging the game without actually doing anything to burn through the survivors' resources.
---
Jokes on you I leave the gates at 99% if someone‚Äôs about to get hooked :) 
---
It happens to me too and was against Legion as well. 
---
Just like Claudette, Lori, Nea, David....so quit bitching

Me since basically last summer.

Cause this sub is biased toxicity

Uh you okay mate? You look like a spirit who was hung to death with unfinished buisness

Oh, wait. Yeah, it actually is. Because once your aura is hidden, it stays hidden.

Dbd has been glitching out a lot lately and is it me or does it take 10-15 minutes finding a lobby?

THANK YOU FOR THIS BLESSING OF A POST üôèüôèüôè
---
Kinda reminds me of Will Turner. 
---
...what?
---
You're right, but depending on when she was born and how old she was when she was taken by the Entity, she may or may not have been kidnapping kids in the late 1800s.
---
And He's a renaissance man to boot. 
---
You don't need to only tunnel one guy, you can chase different people.
---
There is nothing scary about it. You hear the terror radius, you run to the loop. If he doesn't come around to chase you then you get back on the gen. Tier 1 Myers on Lery's I could call scary, as you get 0 notification for him unless you hear his breathing.
---
Maybe, we don‚Äôt have any time frame before the Germans evaded Russia
---
If more than one player disconnects when I'm Legion I always let the other survivors farm because I feel like it's such a dick move.  DCing is such an obvious cop-out to an otherwise fun game with everyone, it wastes time and puts other players at such a disadvantage. People on this sub eat that shit up because they want to pout over games they haven't bothered trying to even play and its so fucking obnoxious. Way to make it not fun for anyone involved. 
---
Yeah cause y'all use those annoying people the most. Stop using those all the time or stfu
---
She has tons of it and she made me let out a sigh of relief since they did not fuck her up badly. Greatly designed killer imo. Legion, even if they suck at securing multiple kills, are a fucking torture for the one or two blokes that die to them. Who cares if it the team wins if all that is going though ones head is "Please just finish this shitty trial already so i can maybe play a good one". Also on the part of counterplay: Fucking where!? The one stab they miss after they turn the wrong way during an attempted vault juke?Big woop.
---
5min for me as survivor and 1min as a Killer. 
---
Legion is fun. 
---
I love nurse so much I main her so this is amazing thank you so much 
---
For me this was the first time I can remember mistaking Legion for a survivor. For context the game had just started and I spawned with a Jeff. We went separate directions after he didn‚Äôt t-bag hello with me, so when I saw a figure approaching me in the distance later I started t-bagging thinking it was another teammate who had spawned near us.
---
I‚Äôd say it depends on the Legion skin and how close they are. Susie and Joey‚Äôs are pretty recognizable instantly. The default Frank and Julie‚Äôs though under the right circumstances are completely inconspicuous.
---
I main Kate. And I'm a Killer main. There is no difference between survivors anyway, besides cosmetics. The fuck are you talking about?
---
so do I ;)
---
I mainly play nea but I'm planning to switch to Feng and buy the blue hair with the blue striped shirt and shorts with long socks, I think that combo looks awesome! And if you can cosplay it, then lucky you, have fun with it!
---
As for Quentins, I don't actually tunnel or hunt Quentins(I was kidding) but Quentins, for some odd reason, tend to be toxic in my experience. Experiences vary though, so not all Quentins are bad. 
---
Hmph. People say dribbling is a no-skill thing, but I don't even want to count the amount of sharp objects I'd still have lodged in my back otherwise 
---
So i figure you know BBQ is top worth... But FRANKLIN IS CLUTCH if you see 2 people with a tool box, Franklin their game up! I can not tell you how many survivors games I screw over for having Franklin, especially at a higher tier ruining their item after hitting. So many people actually try to go back for their item mid chase, or shortly after such just to waste their teams time or screw it up more. Specially against swf, it's a strong counter. All in all, it gives you the ability to fight back against really strong coop survivors where othefwise you'd probably have no chance on such like gen rushers
---
I faced this issue 5 times. Only restarting the game solved.
---
I played a killer match on my friends profile who happens to be a rank 15. Got a R8,R7, and 2 R1. Matchmaking is so broken
---
Cause everyone uses that as the fuckin toxic surv standard and are anmoying most of the time
---
Yes same but most of the time when I join a lobby the killer leaves or it takes for ever to get 4 players and I didn't feel the need to play killer today because I just don't like it anymore after playing nurse for way to many matches trying to get the trophies
---
Think I misunderstood your original comment slightly. Swf groups are having fun like everyone else but I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too much to ask that the killer at least know they have that advantage so they can counterplay it, tricking them here and there. 
---
Who gives a shit about the whiny mob mentality on this sub. Play who you want. 
---
Dc‚Äôing doesn‚Äôt help anyone. That‚Äôs like dc‚Äôing against every LF because they have the potential to facecamp. If you want killers to be punished more often for lobby dodging and dc‚Äôing in matches and to keep offerings and items, you can‚Äôt dc over a killer. Just suck it up. THERE ARE MUCH BETTER WAYS OF PROTESTING LEGION.
---
i‚Äôm a killer main but decided to play survivor, but i‚Äôm not that good (on R15 or 16). first match of the day was this and i was so done lol
---
Don't worry! I was kidding but on a serious note though, I don't know why but 9/10 Quentins I come across are toxic. 
---
That's very different from playing a killer that automatically wins chases for you with their power.
---
I do have him so I'll give him a go for sure. Currently just been using Trapper and Hag. I would like to get somewhat decent at playing Doctor so any tips there would be welcome :) 
---
4/5 of the lobbies has killers with bad connections.
---
Then i report them right after getting their ip for a gud scare
---
Legion 
---
Pretty much. This sub turns into a circle jerk when it comes to legion so it doesn‚Äôt matter what I say. I‚Äôm still gonna continue to play him so it‚Äôs whatever. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I read somewhere that all killers are from the 1900‚Äôs. My bad.
---
And to be honest, the aesthetic of the game felt dropped a tad to me when we got stuff like Carlton Adam Francis and the new lover wraith skin. It‚Äôs gone from a horror game with terrifying killers and worn down survivors to a bit of a fashion show (not that I mind :D).
---
Not Dead by Daylight?
---
I enjoy memes and shitposts like everyone else. The overuse of the word "literally", usually in a completely incorrect context, ruins the humour for me. If doesn't for other people, that's cool. Just stating an opinion, since you know, that's what a message board is for. 
---
The killer doesn't have the advantage. Against any one survivor, sure, but it's 1 vs 4. The game is pretty balanced IMO, there's quibbles here and there but it's in a good spot in general. 
---
With regards to dodging, I feel like if we're going to use chat programs that give us competive advantages so we can have a good time with our friends, the burden of inconvenience should be on us, not a stranger. They're our friends, not some random player's that's just trying to enjoy their night too. I'd understand it if there were some incentive to face these groups, but there isn't. 
---
Guess I‚Äôll get downvoted to hell and back but legion is okay
---
Cosmetics don‚Äôt come with licensed killers 
---
r/UnexpectedThanos
---
If you're in red ranks normally, then I have probably played against you! My PSN name has food (not cupcake or pie though lol)
---
It‚Äôs only good cuz most people don‚Äôt bother with dull totems. Everyone wants more objectives but then they don‚Äôt wanna protect themselves from noed. I‚Äôve even been playin with small game lately to locate the totems quicker
---
? Everyone has to start somewhere Jesus
---
Let‚Äôs hope that nurse rework is going to be as long as the Freddy one...
---
He WILL live forever, cause the killer will go after the unhooked person and he gets away with +1 stack :(
---
A killer's mechanics are irrelevant to you?  Probably why you think legion is a fair killer.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with the clown
---
Pretty good job so far...
---
What the guy thinks of the legion mechanics are irrelevant to me. My God, how do you live day to day being so dense and stupid? 
---
How did you make this it‚Äôs rlly good 
---
A mask that may rival the Deathgarden mask for my favourite. :0
---
I mean survs never give a shit about the killer's fun so i say fuck em anything goes
---
Licensed DLCs won‚Äôt ever receive cosmetics unfortunately. 
---
How do you live day to day being such an insufferable cunt?
---
Yeah but he‚Äôs not fun to play against so people dc
---
Its hard for me to waste a lot of time if gens are still going to look around for someone who will do a hook save if they are close because i never find them. I feel its better to find the next gen being worked on. I need to try to switch up what im doing somehow because if i get in high rank matches I get crapped on the gens get rushed quickly. I can chase and hook two people while two others go gen to gen. If i abandon the two that keep popping up they go do gens. 
---
See? Crybaby survs coming out the woodwork
---
I can't tell if you're trying to bait me, or you're just illiterate.
---
I‚Äôve jumped a little over urban evading Claudettes during Pig games more times that I‚Äôd have hoped for. 
---
matchmaking is done by a blind monkey, of course it doesn't make sense to us lesser beings
---
 Truly amazing. I don‚Äôt really think this counts as just a ‚Äòdoodle‚Äô when it‚Äôs so much more
---
I‚Äôm a cunt because you‚Äôre dense and can‚Äôt follow along? Makes sense. 
---
Left Behind. I really hate hatch standoffs
---
Small Game.
---
I play on PS4 and I play solo. I also don't get a ton of time to play, so I am usually in the purple or green ranks. My teammates are often potatoes and they have never cleansed a totem in their life. I run Small Game because I haven't memorized all of the totem spawns. If it pops, I cleanse that totem. If we're down to 1-2 gens left (and everybody is alive, etc.), I will probably stop working on gens and go totem hunting to try and avoid getting hit with NOED. I fucking hate NOED.
---
Being able to easily find Ruin and other totems is the other obvious benefit. I hate the Hag most out of any killer in the game (they constantly tunnel and camp on PS4 in my experience), they frequently run multiple hex perks, I take a dump all over those builds.
---
Just the fact that you think legion is balanced shows who is dense in this situation.
---
Can you elaborate on the spawn bit? I've seen this sentiment expressed but never figured it out for myself
---
It‚Äôs not that deep 
---
I've been playing only Legion lately and letting every survivor live. It's pretty funny to see people leave right when someone starts bleeding though. We all have a good laugh at the end of the game when people are just blinding me over and over and others are following me everywhere I go.
---
No need, they exist. Deal with it
---
Oh ok thanks 
---
Never said he was ‚Äúfair‚Äù or ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù you continue to show your ignorance and how truly dense you are every time you reply. I‚Äôm sorry someone along the way failed you and can‚Äôt read. I can‚Äôt help that. 
---
I know, but proves the theory right.
---
[X](https://i.imgur.com/8fJfJmH.png).
---
This use of the word is very well known and clearly not used in the definition's primary sense. Being pedantic like this for no reason helps no one, especially when you'd see how unnecessary it is if you'd just "read a dictionary."
---
I mean that bbq and chilli isn‚Äôt going to be in the shrine anywhere soon. If you want that perk (and that‚Äôs great) I suggest you buy the dlc with bubba. 
---
What happened to the two other people that got trapped?
---
Anyone who would do that would do it with *any* killer. Any killer can use NOED and whack you on the hook. Just like any survivor can be a shitlord.
---
You say you know what ignorance means, and yet you say something very ignorant, doesn't make you look particularly intelligent does it? Ever thought the reason i didn't understand your comments is because they are nonsensical and incoherently written? No, of course not, it's just that I'm special, what an amazing argument.
---
If it is, that means you didn't spawn next to it, so you should have found a survivor by then and downed them shortly after if you're playing well.
---
You only need Ruin long enough to find and nearly finish a chase.
---
Also the way to counter is the easiest way. When he's running at sonic speed 360 him, seems most survivors are no longer good at juking
---
This happens a lot on PS4. I've had invisible skillchecks, I've also had invisible generators and invisible totems. I reported all of them to BHVR (the official way, with videos and everything) and they don't reply or do anything. If I get a game like this, I just DC and restart, and hope it doesn't happen again. Pretty good job so far.
---
I play as Legion all the time, and I actively try not to be toxic. Before reset I was still only Rank 17, but I try and make sure I play as fairly as possible, and I haven't encountered any toxic Legion when I play survivor either. But again, I'm still only (before reset) rank 15, so it could just be a high ranking problem
---
It‚Äôs okay I have over 25 pics of fan art of them
---
Well known does not mean correct, and clearly used incorrectly is still incorrect. It wasn't for "no reason", I personally think it's silly to to have a word with a clear definition, and then use it in the context of the exact opposite of said definition. I stated my opinion without downvoting (downvoting for difference of opinion is also silly). Stating ones opinion about a topic is *literally* what a message board is for. Downvote away. It's your perogative, and I could care less.
---
More like "most of the anti Legion memes are low effort as fuck". But you do you.
---
Weird hex but OK.
---
I usually down the injured person then chase the other survivor. Downing them slows the other survivors because they have to go heal them but I'm not rehooking them when they just got farmed unless they've been annoying.
---
You‚Äôre calling an opinion which is  something based on feelings not facts ignorant. Ignorance means lacking knowledge or information. I know how I feel. In fact I‚Äôm certain I know how I feel. So for you to tell how I personally feel is lacking knowledge is so outlandish because it‚Äôs an opinion not a fact. If I said it‚Äôs a fact that he‚Äôs easy to beat besides not being able to follow along and keep up you‚Äôd have a point but you don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre going on a witch hunt to try to make me look dumb when in reality you couldn‚Äôt comprehend a simple exchange between two people. 
---
My fucking sides.
---
Nah, just kind of a bitch move to do. Regardless of what side you're on.
---
Thanks for giving me this information. When did you made this report?? And I have had multible times that devs don't read or do nothing with some bugs they have in the game. That is the reason I stopped playing bo4 after weeks of talking with an employee and trying to make some deal or refund on some specific items and after proving every single thing they just say it should not be happening again and that they could not do anything else for me
---
Nurse re work... Why ?
---
Nurse and spirit are God tier. Good list.
---
Vega drops all pallets on a map. He'd be banned if it was bannable since he does it once every stream, but instead they just brought him up to Behaviour.
---
Just look up to the sky and see
---
*EXODIA* **OBLITERATE!**
---
I just looked it up, FPS Russia \*the guy used in the meme\* was arrested for having weed oil delivered to his house. Kind of a random thing to bring up on a dbd post about hatchets though. lol 
---
I didn't comprehend the exchange because saying legion is easy to beat makes no sense, he encourages tunneling and is a terrible killer but is basically guaranteed a kill.
---
*laughs because RNG gives me 4 skillchecks in 4 seconds that one time*
---
If that‚Äôs how you feel that‚Äôs how you feel. I disagree but that‚Äôs okay. 
---
The one where I told the other guy not to tell me how to live my life, lol. 
---
Looks great! Super accurate
---
Thanks! My hands were filthy for so long after dirtying up the shirt lmaoo 
---
Which is why you run perks that capitalize on giving you advantage in chase like Enduring and Spirit Fury or Nurse's Calling to spot the survivors when they're vulnerable.
---
Wraith is still a 115% movement speed killer. You can do some shit with him. But none these recommended perks capitalize on his strengths or make up for where he's lacking.
---
You don't have a good grasp on how to build killers.
---
if the garbage tier PTB ranking systems makes it through to live its only going to get so much worse
---
I highly doubt that's possible. 
---
Ha. You sound like a moron. A killers machanics don't matter to survivors? As a killer his chase manchanics are literally not fun as a survivor. 
---
Enjoy being 12 years old 
---
RNG makes fools of us all, friend. 
---
Also, yellow dress addon is better than green
---
I'm not following. Do what with just slugging?
---
My favourite thing to run on huntress whenever I have a spare iridescent. Makes for some fun games
---
I don't know why people think spirit fury/enduring is super powerful. It's basically a skill check for the survivors youre facing. Bad survivors will consistently get burned by it but once a good survivor sees you have it, they will just drop the pallets early and you've just burned 2 perk slots for nothing.
---
I knew both were real, I'm subbed to the letter h and saw the letter d before
---
Huh.
---
It doesn't actually do anything. The perk may as well read "makes the progress bar red on survivor actions" since the slow is so negligible. I'd much rather have Monitor or Bloodhound.
---
the post you just laid out before me shows you know nothing about the game for either side, good day.
---
Who has time to do all 5 totems lol
---
He does that to everyone I noticed

I cannot play killer since legion came out.  
---
When I try to play as killer it will load almost all the way and then ppl disconnect or have to end it with task manager. 
---
This isn‚Äôt Naomi Smalls?
---
Dead by daylight back on it‚Äôs typical bullshit for rank reset season
---
There‚Äôs your counter. Of course, people don‚Äôt want to deal with it.
---
Legion can easily injure all the survivors so that 14% slow is better than nothing. I wish they‚Äôd buff it but oh well. 
---
This is their new matchmaking system in place. Lots of old players love it because it means actual fast lobbies, and they don't care that the resulting game is a stompfest for one side. I've somehow been getting more brown/yellow/green survivor ranks than anything else at red ranks and those utterly easy games are not fun at all for me. 
---
Completely sucks for new players but I guess BHVR doesn't care about this game's dwindling new playerbase.
---
Well it varies map to map, but when you spawn as killer, think where you spawned as survivor (usually) on that map.
---
If you‚Äôre in a corner, someone spawned diagonally opposite you. If you spawn in the middle, they‚Äôre generally spread evenly around you. On suffocation pit/Azarov‚Äôs resting place if you spawn in middle, they‚Äôre all other side, if you spawn at the back, one is one your side, 3 are on the other etc. It comes with experience!
---
You‚Äôre just a bad survivor or trolling. Either way get better 
---
Today I escaped and watched the others still left. One character healed herself, and then went back in the field. I assumed she wanted to help another guy get out. But all she did was run around near the exit teabagging and pointing at the killer. I usually wish the best for my team, but I actually wished he‚Äôd caught her! It was so rude. Plus she was rank 6 and he was rank 15. 
---
I started with doctor and now feel like it hindered me a bit. His ability to expose hidden survivors didn‚Äôt force me to actually learn to find them myself. However if you‚Äôre just wanting to easily kill some survivors I think he‚Äôs the easiest to start with at lower ranks.
---
But I have over 1,000 hours and I've spent HOURS grinding the numbers, I can't be wrong.
---
Trolling, sweet. Have a good one 
---
Funny enough I also watch monto and run basement cannibal 
---
Yep hahahah
---
It comes with the territory of being a doctor. Gotta get used to it. When people scream in my games I always see it as a 50% percent chance of disconnects. 
---
Depends. In order to uncap the fps or make the fps limit higher you'd need to go into the game files. %appdata% &gt; Saved &gt; Config &gt; WindowsNoEditor &gt; GameUserSettings
---
Open that file and change Vsync  to False and Frame rate limit to whatever you'd like it to be. I personally run DBD at 144 hz
---
These AHS memes are gold thank you for making such relatable content
---
Yeah lol
---
Thanks! I don't consider myself anything more than a casual who doodles abit to wind down after a busy day. But hoping to improve with every drawing :) cheers!
---
Jamie Lee Curtis is 60 but doesn‚Äôt look a day over 20.
---
The 14 percent slow (best case scenario) isn't worth not running a better perk though.
---
It can be shitty, but no one's obligated to play in a match they don't want to. People play the game to have fun, and no one is obligated to stay in your game to ensure that you personally have fun at their expense. It leads to shitty situations like this, and if it happens enough they'll get a ban. There's not much you can do, so it is pointless to get too upset about it. Survivor puddings aren't that uncommon, you'll get others and other full games as well. 
---
Can I insert a "man of culture as well" meme here then ?
---
Honestly, way better than how the Legion is now.

You can get as much pressure with slugging as you would with this method, but at least you'd get into normal chases.
---
I guess it's preference, I just find that playstyle really boring.
---
You only get 2k-5k and you get to watch them have the time of their life tunneling you and getting 30k bp. I'll pass on that BS too.
---
&gt; None of these are toxic, it's survivor gameplay.
---
Playing hyper-coordinated because you can use comms to break the game *is* toxic, though. Especially given they teabag and mock the killer the entire way. Literally just came off the most miserable SWF game because of that. 
---
I play legion and i tend to be rather friendly in terms of killers. I also like running bizarre builds with them (iridescent button with all 3 of the terror radius perks, and the pallet eater build) just to surprise survivors

You're missing the locker.

I mean you can also go here to see that there are lobbies do go past the time estimate, although they're pretty close. So it's cleary an estimate, not a maximum. Last night when I checked it it was a roughly 1:2 killer:survivor ratio so there were had to have been survivors waiting that long at some point. Even though the ratio is about 1:3 I still just saw a lobby with 7 minutes, and I stopwatched one way past 3 minutes last night when I was playing. https://dbd.onteh.net.au/

David is my daddy I can‚Äôt betray him

As a Claudette main I have never done that to another survivor, she givin us a bad name.

Why is Freddy on that?

Yeah thats good to know that I wasnt intentionality being an idiot, sucks it happened though. 
---
Imagine dying to NOED because you didn‚Äôt cleanse Dull Totems
---
Yeah that‚Äôs known that one car you can through hatchets through. God only knows when they‚Äôll fix it though.
---
You reckon? I win most games, I don‚Äôt slug, I don‚Äôt tunnel. I hook a survivor and I go check gens, because that‚Äôs where survivors are and guess what? If they‚Äôre on a gen, I kick it first because I‚Äôve just scared them off it.

I wasn‚Äôt being a dick, so you should try not being one pal.

Possibly sounding like an idiot, but why is Dwight easy to kill? Or is it just newer players tend to go for him?

Killers need all the powerful stuff they can get because they are so weak compared to survivors. Killers should be like 100 times as powerful as survivors, minimum.
---
Basement trapper ftw. Although, I‚Äôm partial to body blocker hag when I get the scarred hand add on. 
---
I think this thread is a good time to bring up the elephant in the room, a perk that‚Äôs been too strong for too long, Monstrous Shrine. I don‚Äôt understand why the devs and the community want to evaluate perks like NOED and Adrenaline when instawin garbo like MS is ignored.
---
So it isn‚Äôt just me? Today has been surreal with lag. And it doesn‚Äôt feel like lag switching either :/
---
I'm sorry, I don't understand... There are versions like that? Can you tell me where I'd find one?
---
This leggit happened to me against a clown.. why 
---
Wait spine chill wakes you up? I haven't played in a while and didn't use spine chill that much 
---
I agree that noed is a crutch. It rewards the killer by failing to do their job, which killing survivors and stopping them from doing gens. Adrenaline is earned because it rewards the survivors for doing the objective which is gens. I have used both perks, and noed isn't fun and is very crunchy. Were adrenaline isn't a crutch as it can be countered, and it doesn't punish survivors for doing the objective. Noed is like pre rework ds, ds punishes the killer for getting the survivor down. And rewards the survivor for failing. And noed isn't instant like adrenaline, where as soon as the last gen is done it pops. What i mean is that a killer will as soon as the last gen is done that you adrenaline. Noed you have to be hit, to know if the killer has it.
---
I don‚Äôt rly like the cannibal :/ his ability isnt all that great really
---
It increases the chance of a skillcheck appearing while the killer is looking at you
---
Ok thanks I‚Äôll think about the way I want to play and the way I most enjoy it
---
For you. I will say it‚Äôs more playable then a legion game but if you throw on an ebony then it‚Äôs not a fun game at all.
---
I want legion to be better because I liked the idea. The execution, however, really fucked it up man. I would have enjoyed being able to vault pallets if I didn't need to hit a survivor 5 times to frickin down them lol. 
---
*cough bullshit couch*
---
Killers gotta have fun sometimes too &lt;3
---
Unfortunately most claudettes are like this in high ranks
---
And none of them can loop which is amazing
---
Oh look its this thread again.
---
Ahhh, I haven't played it a while, it was kinda ruined for since my friend's pc stppied working ;(

They're "modded" or "hacked" versions you can find some just by searching for it but be careful on any website that you choose.

how can there be a bot on ps4? i assumed they have a special third party ps4 controller that allows you to select a button to spam. seems like a silly thing to do just to get a few bloodpoints though
---
Dude are you slow? That has nothing to do with what I‚Äôm talking about. They just announced that the new matchmaking system was live yesterday on the forums and on twitter. 
---
Are you talkin the drawing or the Huntress?
---
Did you get out though? 
---
Depends on type of player I guess... 
---
Trump's cousin
---
It really is preference, I understand your viewpoint. From my PoV it's just *different* - played that way he offers a playstyle that no other killer can offer. A very strategic and mindgamey-one, with the added benefit of stalling the game. You feel like you're in control of the match, unless the survivors manage to stealth well while awake (which, granted, is hard but not impossible) or skillchecks are on the survivor's side. In an era of DBD where you can't waste too much time with drawn-out chases or the game ends quickly, killers need to come up with better strategies.
---
So being a good killer is toxic as well then. If you make all of the gameplay toxic then the sheer act of playing the game is toxic.
---
We're all toxic on this blessed day.
---
yeah thats why the killer needs to act fast to benefit or they will allow the survivors to prevail
---
BNP existed, killers didn't wanted to deal with it tho
---
Lol which dbz villian would be the killer 
---
From Asiaüòù
---
Only if you‚Äôre using external-to-game factors that break the game OR being an asshole while playing as a good killer :)
---
Basically, anyone who cheats is toxic (that includes comms in my book, as the game wasn‚Äôt designed for them and they aren‚Äôt part of the game. The devs explicitly said so in a livestream) and anyone who‚Äôs an asshole is toxic. Everyone else is 100% good. 
---
The survivors get plenty of guaranteed wins against me because I‚Äôm playing shit killers like billy and wraith, but sometimes I want a free win as well so I‚Äôll play Freddy or use strong add ons for huntress
---
I'm glad you like itüòù

Overcharge is incredibly bad unless you‚Äôre the Doctor or you‚Äôre running unnerving presence + distressing and even then it‚Äôs just meh.

---

---
Ahh yes a man of culture I see
---
Someone's salty
---
Sometimes you just spawn with killer. I have games where I will loop the killer half the game and finish doing gens, or I‚Äôll have one of those I‚Äôm first seen and I get tunneled/farmed on. Can‚Äôt have 100% all the time 
---
But playing against a Legion is guaranteed to be unfun. Sure DCing is a shitty move but man I don't wanna waste 15 minutes not gaving fun in a video game
---
I 50/50 play killer and survivor (with P3 50 Feng, Meg and Jake) and the only killer I hate playing against is the Doctor lmao but i still dont discconnect because he's not my favorite. It's childish to do so 
---
I got bamboozled
---

---
Killer is still challenging at rank 1, however it‚Äôs much better than before. I‚Äôm happy with the balance for killer right now, just fix NOED and I‚Äôll be happy.
---
All perks are viable, it depends on how you want to play, or the type of killer behavior you hate the most. DS will be a personal anti-tunnel perk, so if you hate being tunneled it's still valuable.
---
Just build your loadout on countering stuff you hate the most.

Thanks!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
---
They got up whenever I moved. 
---
Just smack and let go out the hatch. You only lose points for letting her finish gens
---
Hit her and give her hatch is what I would do. You could fake uncloak but unlikely to work. Nothing you can really do. When a survivor is at the hatch then the killer has no power really over the hatch standoff. The survivor may give in after waiting for too long. 
---
I'd let her go 'cause there was a DC and that will end the game fastest.
---
Or you could waste your time with a standoff trying to get a 3k.
---
I dont think it should be removed but it should be harder open the hatch like you have to find a lever around the map and the killer can also switch it back closed BUT if the killer just keeps camping the lever for minutes he should lose bloodpoints
---
But I want the 3rd kill since the other play left the game.
---
Was it coal tower?
---
Regardless of the amount of time it took, this is a wonderful picture. Also, did you really do it in 2 hours because that is crazy skill!
---
useless
---
It doesn't reward bad players tho. You still have to do good in all the other categories to pip up
---
Okay, or maybe they did test it, and it failed their tests.
---
 I'm that weirdo who believes the only way I'll get better is to play people who are better than I am. Don't see what the issue is here. I've played all week and of the dozens,maybe hundreds, of matches I've had... I think only one was against a team that had 2 lower ranks. 
---
So just because they got a 3k means they should be handed the 4k? 
---
Sure sounds like its the survivors that are the entitled ones here.
---
If you are better at the game then they won't be able to bully you tho, since being able to bully the other person (unless you are the killer) implies that you are worse than them as a player.
---
You won't get bullied if you are better at the game, as those who try to bully you will be too busy trying not to die. That's why the "get good" argument is valid here.
---
Would you make the exact same argument for lobby dodging as survivor? Should the survivors get notified that they are against someone using ebony mori/instasaw/omegablink/irihead so that they can dodge?
---
Good players already know the totem spawns, so if you are against a team without voice comms that is composed of players of the same skill then it won't take any longer for ruin or any other hex to go down.
---
Hell if you want to talk balance we can go to town with moris, instaheals, broken add ons, maps, etc. Removal of swf from the discussion doesn't make the game balanced and it's stupid to think otherwise.
---
And sometimes, when they are tired, the survivors want to have some fun too, and playing with friends and being able to talk with them is much more fun and relaxing, so the same argument is valid for survivors.
---
Both
---
So he whiffs with like 0 repurcusssions for whiffing an attack?
---
Missing an attack while in frenzy should have the same amount of recovery as a normal attack
---
Well.. I hate killers not having a terror radius (Myers, Pig etc) And I'm not great at escaping the killer in a chase. Any suggestions?
---
Thanks! I never thought of that actually, I will give it a shot
---
Is the 3rd kill really that important to you?

What does "killer status" even mean?

Okay for anyone wondering, the game ended. Kate got tired of doing a gen infront of me. So instead they went to go do a gen somewhere else, however I thought she was smart enough to sit around hidden from me and wait for me to go look for her. Then she pops the gen and opens the gates. I waited at hatch because I knew if I got into a chase with gates closed, they‚Äôd have enough time to get to the hatch. Honestly I wish you could close the hatch and leave it closed for one minute until it automatically opens. 
---
It sucks hearing this because I know it happens a lot - but I've never really gotten to Red Ranks as Killer given the exception of the first time (i just wanted the achievement) - and this experience happens like, once a year? It's frustrating but try to remember, they're not EVERY game. 
---
I also find it helps to switch sides of the game when one side gets too stressful :P 
---
But I hear you man, those SWF squads are so frustrating to deal with. As a solo survivor player, I just don't get the big ego'd squads lol
---
I don‚Äôt like it either, but it is what it is. I‚Äôd rather not have the entire ram know exactly what I‚Äôm using than know what the killer is running. But maybe that‚Äôs me as a killer main speaking. 
---
Cloak, then bushwhack her 
---
It‚Äôs literally our main goal, so yeah. It‚Äôs pretty important to us.
---
You can see the kind of crap killers have to deal with in this game. You can kind of get over most things and watching Tru3 you really learn how to play better though Zubatlel is slowly taking over that slot due to how effective his slugging is at slowing the game. 
---
If you have an SWF the best thing you can prey upon is their general zealousness for altruism. Usually, they do not want to abandon their friends so you can take advantage of that. Their need to save survivors will tend to make them save very fast meaning they drain hook states much faster through the game. 
---
For a starting killer, Hag might not be the best. Hag is a killer based around mass trapping of a specific area and herding survivors towards them. She should not chase otherwise you will really suffer from being looped. I would say a good killer to start off with would be something like wraith or hillbilly. These killers have 115% movement speed and can give you the basics to dealing with looping and using mind games against survivors. You can also learn to play without ruin which will allow you to become better as killer overall. It forces you to be more efficient and without relying on ruin which can be destroyed really quickly.
---
Was leaving the game really necessary? I don‚Äôt even know why that person left to be honest with you. I haven‚Äôt even seen them DC infront of me. 
---
Alright but I must warn you that in the shrine bbq and chilli showed up only once (more than one year ago) so it‚Äôs really hard that It‚Äôll show up again since bhvr is making money from people who buy the cannibal dlc
---
Sprint burst and windows of opportunity for chase perks. 
---
Won‚Äôt she jump in the hatch while I‚Äôm cleaning my weapon?
---
Hex: MyRuinGone (if you are a killer main)
---
i play both :-)
---
There are Claudettes who de-rank and do this shit too. Rank 15, and this happened to me. 
---
Hex: The third seal, really underrated, no one really tries to actively destroy it too like ruin of devour hope because everyone thinks it's useless. But the knowledge survivors get is comepletely thrown out the window with this perk.
---
&gt;NOED has no counters
---
I‚Äôm sorry but fucking #WHAT
---
you can literally prevent the perk from being activated before it even activates. 
---
One very important thing for you:
---
Look at Dwights Pointing, Waving and T-Bag Animations. Look at them. Learn them. You want to replicate them as good as you can. I had one Dwight Cosplayer doing them at a Con, it was hilarious af. 
---
ignore the amazing 360 :\^)
---

---
Oh ya I didn‚Äôt think about that but I don‚Äôt wanna waste a lot of time and fun just for two perks counting Franklin‚Äôs 
---
If they're sitting at gate tbagging, just swat them out. I know you probably avoided going there because you didnt want to give her the satisfaction but going there and smacking her so she is forced to leave or else get hook.
---
It prevents them refusing to leave.
---
I get punished for the rest of those assholes, damn it! 
---
GENERAL REPOSTI
---
Where is Nea?
---
‚ÄúGet good to not be bullied‚Äù is basically putting the blame on the victim who‚Äôs being mistreated by assholes and told to kill themselves while being called racial slurs (also, they‚Äôre still assholes post-game and a game with assholes is fundamentally unfun, whether I‚Äôm winning or not). Just saying. Instead of telling the ones being victimized to get better, maybe tell assholes and bullies to not be assholes and bullies?
---
Those are in-game feature, so no. Just like killers shouldn‚Äôt lobby dodge survivors for using DS, having four toolboxes, etc. 
---
I‚Äôve played high-ranking games as and against solo survs where Ruin was not found ever. You‚Äôre reasoning is not accurate and most people do not have every totem spawn memorized exactly. This is disingenuous. Being able to tell people where the totem is = objectively an advantage. Even if it only speeds up ruin‚Äôs demise by ten seconds, thats STILL an advantage. That‚Äôs not up for debate. Likewise, some powers, like Third Seal, are useless. Who cares if they can see a hooked victim‚Äôs aura if the victim can simply tell their friend ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here!‚Äù
---
It doesn‚Äôt make the game balanced which is why perks are still being changed which I 100% support. It does make the game significantly more balanced given it was objectively designed around zero comms. 
---
I never said SWF should be removed or that comms need to be banned. I am in favor of allowing killers to decide whether or not they‚Äôre willing to deal with SWF that day, and I believe giving them extra bloodpoints for facing SWF would be a good way to incentivize it. SWF can still play with comms, killers have a huge motive to go against SWF, and killers who are having a bad day and just want to relax don‚Äôt deal with comms. 
---
I've been using Windows of opportunity, Dance with me, We're gonna live forever and urban evasion. Is that any good or not?
---
Bravo.
---
Hahahahahha this isn't wise at all. 
---
Spine chill will allow you to deal with stealth based killers. Being able to know if they are targetting you helps greatly with knowing when to start running or hiding. 
---
Urban evasion is great if you want to play immersed and avoid the killer. Combo with Spine chill and you can allow youself to be prepared for each killer. 
---
Sprint burst is great to create distance between you and a killer. Real nice perk.
---
Dead hard is still good. Very good for loops were you are injured. Timing it right allows you to narrowly avoid a hit from the killer and potentially stun them with a pallet. The time they take breaking the pallet allows you to create some distance.
---
Lithe instead of sprint burst is great for creating massive distance between yourself and the killer when being chased. 
---
Some survivors use quick and quiet now to help juke killers. Can throw a killer off if they dont hear you vault a window.
---
The point of playing killer is to get the most amount of kills in the game, if you're telling me that playing the game is being a dick then damn this is the icing on the cake.
---
If u want to say Nea is a boi give up vote xD
---
For anyone else wondering, do not follow this video's steps. It doesn't work.

I‚Äôm not calling you a dick directly if you want to slug do it I‚Äôm just saying a lot of people think it‚Äôs a dick move and annoying as hell to play against
---
F my guy
---
I guess it‚Äôs just personal preference. I‚Äôve had better luck with leather. Trapped I usually get stomped.
---
If it works for you then yes it‚Äôs good. If you‚Äôre having trouble with chases though I‚Äôd take out Dance with me for an exhaustion perk, either Sprint burst or Balanced Landing, but any exhaustion perk will do. Otherwise, your build is pretty solid. 
---
I  referred some wedding dress and addedmore details when I drew it :D
---
I hate hatch standoffs too buddy,if the survivor isn't brain dead there's literally nothing you can do as a killer 
---
With your situation I would just let him go as him completing that one gen will reduce your points 
---
I say trapper because he‚Äôs free, good perks, simple and easy to use ability, and he‚Äôs a standard killer. Leatherface is DLC and most people who start playing killer don‚Äôt usually spend money on it. 
---
Looks like she pulled a David on David 
---
What exploit? Moonwalking? If so, then they acknowledged it and said that it was a viable strategy just like gen tapping. 
---
You can literally do nothing all match, be downed just before the last gen gets popped and get away when it does. I don't use NOED, but to say Adrenaline doesn't reward bad play is asinine.
---
I'll try use spine chill more. I didn't know how useful it was. Thanks!
---
This is a skin that is already coming to the game :D
---
Might have been! Are there hills on coal tower? It might have been an auto haven where there is that small little shed that sometimes has a basement in it and sometimes a gen is right outside of it. It was last month sometime.

it was just a meme!  I'm so edgy!  omegalul 4head

&gt; You're about to get clowned on kid and regret the day you were born

Assuming I don't already?

They did not make it, it is already a skin that is coming to the game. These are just pictures of it rendered.

Heres a video showing the other new skins: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LusX\_1PUm0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LusX_1PUm0)

Very true the Canadians forgot how to read a map but I have the same problem get survivors or killers from Japan, Germany, Russia, South America and I‚Äôm in the south east of the USA around Atlanta 
---
You want speed? Play fast blink nurse, leather face, hillbilly, devour hope on any killer. But if that's what you think is fun that's you.
---
I can 4K roughly every other game on Freddy, at least get 2-3 kills. I can‚Äôt get a kill with billy to save my life. He‚Äôs insanely difficult, harder than nurse imo
---
Legion is not the fun to play after a while. You just run at people and ignore pallets and windows. Killers hate it and survivors hate it.
---
Plague is looking like she is going to be good and a fun killer to play if you can hold out I would go for her.
---
Michael is just a basic M1 killer with a little twist and doesn't have much variety in his gameplay. Hes some where in the middle for both tier and fun factor
---
Spirit can be fun to play, is quiet good once you know how to play her so you can still compete in red ranks AND her perks are pretty good. If you cant wait for plague I would choose spirit out of the 4 killers you  gave as options.
---
TL;DR I would pick spirit
---
I‚Äôm gonna say Buu and I have no idea what his power would be but his mori would 100% be turning survivors into candy and eating them
---
You won't keep multiple people asleep at all times. Basically if you sleep one person there isnt a point to leave them because they will just go simply miss a skill check. If you come up on a group sleep them all then try to end the chase before they can wake up. 
---
Spirit because she‚Äôs top tier and has good perks compared too the other three
