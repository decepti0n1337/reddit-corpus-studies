He has to be significantly in view/out of cover to be revealed. Looking at him alone will not stop him from stalking you. Revealing him will. Hope that helps.
---
Yeah, sorry if I come of harsh- it’s pretty frustrating hence my salt tag. But this is the first time it’s happened and I was hoping it would be an issue that wasn’t just my end.
---
bUt ThE BlOoDpOiNt EcOnOmY
---
Kinda like you...
---
im unaware of the problem, i suppose if its just too loud you could turn the volume down in game and then go into the volume mixer to turn it down EVEN MORE
---
People are saying it’s probably because it was bought with auric cells, but it shouldn’t make a difference, lmao. No matter how you purchased a killer, you still have it so no splinters should spawn on the web
---
I get a lot of lag too, even with Ethernet. The issue probably pertains to people on the other end having a bad connection or being very far away from you. Both connections of the players matter, which is why the upcoming dedicated servers are very important to players.
---
Ghostface is for campers. Go with Leatherface, he's at least respectable.
---
do boobs not have physics in real life?
---
tbh i thought that too until i got a red rank nurse then spirit. Im enjoying ghosty boy live or die. i dont enjoy the other 2 :(
---
Kind of the point. They're being put onto meat hooks by their shoulder, I'd cry out too like that. She just ended up getting a better voice actress than some of the other characters.
---
I got fast internet
---
Is there any predicted date for that? Or is it something we’ll hear about later in the year?
---
Who's vigo
---
Hell yeah
---
It would be so hard to see him though...
---
This Summer^Tm
---
I think is the other way around, bud
---
Yeah, this is beyond painful, it does at some humor to it though, it's Scream after all and the movies themselves had some silly stuff in them
---
i have no problems with killer but I've been dropping tons of frames when I play survivor. Do you have the Xbox One X? Playing this game without the X is baaaaad
---
Angel Wraith when
---
I could of swore it was the other way around😂😂
---
exposed small penis wraith when
---
I kinda see this idiots plan *a*, last person standing so might as well try to build BL3 and secure the 4k. But plan *b* seemed to work really well also.
---
bionic arm wraith when
---
He’s my new favourite killer but yeah the toxicity is so bad with him for some reason.
---
I mean, if it works.
---
I just had the same problem. I don't know why you got downvoted for this; this is ridiculous that a core part of the game simply doesn't function. My guess is that they're aware of it already but you may as well wait until the next hotfix to play because getting screwed out of an escape by no fault of your own is horribly unfun.
---
Well it made sense though.
---
They are both popular people during their time.
---
*Roars in Billy*
---
Don't mind me just rubbin some skulls
---
Meanwhile, you have me, who is a damn coward, and will leave teammates to die if all of em are hooked.
---
This happened to me yesterday.... I was playing as plague and chasing a David to the exit gate and as soon as I vomited at the exit gate my game crashed. I said fuck it and went to sleep lmao.
---
I think that if someone were to get tagged a giant entity hand would come from the ground and smoke would cover the survivor turning them into their preferred killer, the person who used to be killer does not have the entity hand coming from the ground but still does have the smoke (smoke will also go around all traps) the survivor getting turned into the killer will take about 10 seconds giving the other survivors to hide.
---
And with shows you mean counts?
---
Which addon???
---
Favorites are Pig when I’m playing to have fun, Billy, Nurse, huntress, and spirit when I’m trying to ruin survivors days and crank out ranks. 
---
Least favorites are Doctor, Plague, and Hag(calm down I know she’s good I just suck with her.
---
Well my ps4 broke so... oof
---
&gt;Well if playing survivor gave BP equal to killer
---
So having free items from box when escaping or keep the items and addons if you survive? Something that killers don't?.. yeah that's the reason
---
&gt;playing survivor was more fun and rewarding, it really wouldn't be an issue. But if you get camped, slugged or tunneled. Why would you not switch to playing killer?
---
To play the game at it's fullest? In the whole event I played survivor only and p3 my favorite survivor taking advantage of the sea of BP since prestige survivors it's useless to my point of view. Except when there are these events. Survivors are fun and enjoyable, slugged and tunneled? Unbreakable and DS, problem solved
---
&gt;I did and it was the best decision i ever did, only downside, I clearly am not the only one who did so. Lobby times for killers have been bad for 4-5 months now.
---
So wasn't the best decision since by the time you do 1 game I've finished 2/3 already. So, yeah.. it's arguable
---
What killer were you? It happened to me three times the other day and I was playing Plague on all of them. I noticed it crashed as I was using Purge right at the end of the game so I stopped and it hasn’t crashed since.
---
Think you forgot Jane's titty physics and Clowns stomach also.
---
I hate that they removed the pigs endgame traps it’s one of the best ways to use her
---
My best advice is to disable the ability to message you after the game. Toxic players get really common after the first few ranks.
---
[I apologise for format, I'm on my phone]Okay his stealth takes away his terror radius and gives a static radius of 8 meters I think (someone correct me if I'm wrong) but the point is it's small. When you press the ability again it stalks, but you have to hold it obviously, he stalks a LOT faster when he's peeking, so ALWAYS stalk from behind cover if you can, 99% stalk works like Myers but you gotta track the gauge around the survivors' status picture to measure. Pressing the active ability button and holding it (pig's crouch button if I'm not mistaken) you can crouch, you won't be able to stalk through grass very well but you'll be safe from detection as long as you're crouched in it. To lean from cover you have to wait for the prompt while approaching the edge of a wall/tree/barricade basically any form of solid object cover, you stalk when you see the prompt and he'll lean out. That is EVERYTHING I know about how to use his ability, playstyle I use is cover to cover, I run discordance so I can passively track generators if more than one person is on it (highly HIGHLY recommend that perk if you have it) and other than that, it's like hide and seek. If a survivor sees you first you loose your power, you see a survivor first, you get them down.
---
as much as i think he needs a buff i really don't know HOW you could buff him that wouldn't trigger survivors into rioting.   
---
all things considered he's not really in a bad spot (aside the infinite mend bug) he's not strong but imo i think he can place some decent pressure. that being said Let legion run at Kenyan murder speeds again, give his speed addons back
---
I love his stoner lookin outfit
---
Trapper be like
---
**Nice upstairs window.**
---
But this is a game, idiot. /s

Thank you for all the replies

This is fucking gnarly. I like it.

His base speed should be increased a little bit you basically have to rely on bloodlust to catch people
---
Uuuuuuuh yes please!
---
Well I'm Hoping for Harry Warden from my bloody valentine and it better not be just some random guy in a Miners outfit like in the movies.
---
Dark Sense, helps me avoid the killer while hen jockeying and helps avoid NOED since I can go where the killer isn’t.
---
Check out Luminosity6 not big, but a great personality and really fun to watch.
---
It is
---
Take the cowards way out
---
Will Infectious Fright actually trigger if you down someone whilst in Night Shroud though? Because technically you don’t have a terror radius.
---
it makes sense that his base, non feral speed is 115, he's literally just another guy. increasing feral frenzy speed is something i'd like but that might be considered a little too powerful for what you get
---
Don’t be toxic it ruins the game for killers/survivors 
---
Don’t listen to toxicity you are learning and you have the right to make mistakes.
---
Used it for a bit, didn’t work or maybe no one was near me.
---
I could see locusts too. Or leeches.
---
I’m not, that could be it. I just wish they’d allow me to play on some old school RuneScape type graphics in return for some extra frames.
---
Make his mend a little more threatening is the only other this I can think of
---
Every single match I've played against Ghostface the player just camps hooks or slugs the entire group. It's incredibly annoying.
---
The game is fun, the idea of it is great. However, the game is just not ready for a competitive stand point. Competitive gamers play hard and fast and I know dbd can’t handle that without the dedicated servers, but they are working on bringing it. I play on Xbox and there is no many issues with hit boxes and looping due to latency issues. What went from a fun creepy game turned into a mass multiplayer competitive game so all the bugs are coming out. Just continue supporting them and u til those dedicated servers are out, just gonna need to deal with those small bugs once in a while
---
Been using the tried and true BBQ &amp; Ruin which has been serving me well (yum Bloodpoints), also running his own perk Thrilling Tremors, which I find very fun/useful tho not super meta defining.  Id use Spirit Fury/Enduring but they're only Rank 1 on my Ghost Face, so not bothering and instead just running Blood Warden to troll people and/or snag a last min Kill/points.
---
Which ones?
---
The vault change? Yeah it's dumb but wasn't a massive loss
---
Pallet numbers? That -1 pallet was such an heavy Nerf!!!
---
DS fixed aswell as MoM even if the latest was a very lazy change? Guess having free escapes for 1+ yr wasn't enough
---
What else? I'm curious since I've read ALL the patch notes few times since the game release and I've seen many fixes for survivors prioritized, killer audios been fucked 24/7 and eventually working for 1 patch then get bugged again. So I'd like to ask you, what nerfs?
---
Since it's release I've seen many nerfs for survivors yeah, still their survival rate is 80%. So why it's unfun compared to killer? Especially when I can literally listen podcast while playing survivors and be super focused while playing killer for the ridiculous FoV it has and the bugged sounds so I cant hear people that are literally touching me
---
&gt;Also, do we know if there is a current consistency with time? Like are they all from around the same era, mid to late 1900s ? Genuinely interested. Maybe they are avoiding making it historical
---
Nah the killers don't have a time consistency. They seem to be from different ages.
---
Wraith, Piggy, Spirit and Legion would be from the modern timeline.
---
Huntress was from WW1/WW2 and Plague is from like waaaaay before that.
---
Nurse, Trapper, Billy and Doc probably is around 1800s to 1950s? With just how their backstories are told it makes me feel around that timeline.
---
Mental asylums still being about church healing, mines are fairly recent but not that recent, something about Billy's story feels early 1900s, could be wrong and Doc is pre modern era imo.
---
The DLC killers Well... Would be based off their release timelines as well.
---
Survivors should just have to hook themselves and let killers win tbh
---
It could be! I like the idea as someone who enjoys both killer and survivor. and I like the idea of other survivors maybe fucking each other over but then you make yourself a target it all sounds hectic and insanely fun to me.
---
Plague is way more fun to play, IMO she's also stronger with a right build. But I still think she needs a solid buff. GF is so boring to play as I don't even bother.
---
It seems like its the add-ons that need fixing, played some KYF to test him out and the base power isn't that hard to counter for me. With some add-ons tho its near impossible 👀
---
Why?
---
In all honesty once you get higher rank they become less and less used. Im usually sitting at rank 5ish and they are pretty rare. At least until ghostface came out and people wanted to see his mori
---
What about puppers
---
mista = upvote
---
Yea, now I know that :D Have only one wake up abuser today tho, but I completely demolished the team with Hag.
---
She is top tier mb. I meant like perma or higher than.
---
Ye but the perk, if it made blood pools visible then Spirit just basically doesn't need to use that add on anymore.
---
Why would you want someone that kills pirates.
---
Happened to me earlier said he let me die cause he wanted the hatch smh
---
Distressing is good for clown because since his bottles can provide a mangled effect and you run it with Unnerving prescence, Coulrophobia, and nurses calling basically making healing long
---
Now make it one with the killer using the gruesome whatever thing and 4 survivors 2 brand be part and 2 instaheals.  I had both experiences.
---
There's a lot of larger maps that can make it hard to get good use out of Infectious Fright and often decent/coordinated Survivor groups will spread out.  It's a great Perk for Michael Myers, esp if you increase his Terror Radius for T3 hits.  But, yeah, may be bad luck on your experiences unless your Exposed Hits don't register your Terror Radius until after?  I'm not sure, don't have it on my Ghost Face and don't have a good way to test it.
---
Blizzard didn't invent a hooking character
---
Did you just compare one of the worst movie ever made with Infinity war ????
---
i got an ebony mori at level 5 on ghostface
---
The problem is experienced killers are gonna know where survivors are going anyway. Also the 60s cooldown absolutely throws this perk to the Monstrous Shrine tier. If the cooldown was like I dunno, 20 seconds it might be maybe useful... Stil meh.
---
[exam](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/dbd_exam)  i found it on there twitter.
---
Respectable list. I love that you use Freddy. He's pretty terrifying and hard to play against. I feel like he should be use more frequently.
---
People are running I'm All Ears??? xP
---
Man, it’s almost like I’ve got a different opinion than you, isn’t it? Damn, you’re right, I’m sorry.
---
We did it boys, we found the fanboy.
---
Legion applys a debuff that stops others from helping you mend deep wounds. Deep wounds can be self healed.
---
Never watched him yet, guess I’ll check him out
---
Tells you that you have 3, when in reality it's four.

---
I don't think he has any match on Ormond recorded actually. Maybe in vods.
---
I’m all ears isn’t even good. It won’t get ran often ,  don’t blame a shitty perk for the reason you can’t run your builds.
---
I think he just means its an unearned victory for the survivor.  They dont have to do the gens they just have to let the last person die on hook and camp hatch.
---
  
---
I play both, so I see how its nice for survivor if your team gets destroyed, but I can also see how it can suck for killer.
---
Gotta love that good ol’ Discordance, am I right?
---
*Chucky
---
Alternatively, rank 20’s with full builds, high-level items, and perfect map knowledge.
---
why is the gen bar red when 2 or more are working ona gen didnt it used to be yellow
---
Favorite:
---
1.) Freduardo Krueger - maximum spook and everyone thinks he's poop... until you run pill bottle and class photo.
---
2.) Bubba - yeet with chainsaw
---
3.) The Plag - vommy mommy
---
Least Favorite
---
1.) Nurse - tilts me when I play as her or against her and super meta.
---
2.) Billy - boring, uninspired Bubba copy that was only made because they thought they wouldn't get the license to put Bubba in the game. Oh and he's braindead to play as.
---
3.) Everyone else is fine. Fix ghostface detect though lul.
---
Go find me a game without any bugs or flaws,dumbass. If you don't like it don't play it, but we don't give a shit.
---
You still get the darkened screen but you have wider FOV. Also I don't think the problem is FOV, he just has problems with tracking survivors after they loose LOS in buildings \^\^ Same as me actually lol.

Nice! I'm not a fan of the hag myself.
---
A made up one
---
Id LOVE to have this in game. I would buy it in a heart beat. Gorgeous work ♥️
---
Texas nea
---
Yeah but there is nothing threatening about it
---
And???? What’s so threatening about it
---
The only swf groups I wanna go against as killer are couples, because it's adorable
---
When you're in lobby click on the survivors name. Check their steam friends list to see if they're SWF. Dodge appropriately. If they're all private, just assume it's SWF.
---
Queue times suck, I'd say play another game for a few months until they get better.
---
Damn Wraiths got a tiny ass dick, I’m disappointed wasn’t he a black guy.
---
Thats my proposed change silly
---
I would assume so.
---
Just play hag she’s super fun!
---
If two people DC I tend to take the last one to hatch if I find it, but most of the time they wiggle out ;(
---
Oh lmao I thought that’s how it was already
---
I like that there are players out there that like Freddy. He gets so much hate for being too hard to use.
---
Is there a very tiny Claudette head photoshopped into this gif somewhere?
---
Can't pick jus one fav, never can or will xD
---
Favorites: Pig, Ghost Face, Myers, Legion, Hag
---
Least Fav: Hillbilly. 
---
Honorable mentions: Spirit, Trapper, Huntress
---
Ones I love but don't play as much because of balance issues and how they fare VS the majority of Survivors I play VS &amp; Maps: Clown, Plague.  Love these two and I have a ton of fun still, but if I go against a SWF voice com group or on the larger maps...its jus not a good time at all :x.
---
LaNdInG gReAtS iSnT ThAt HaRd, JuSt bE GoOd
---
At the moment if you want a debuff on a frenzy stab you gotta equip a pin
---
What do you mean? There are four of them right there.
---
What happened?
---
With how grindy the game is, I never dc, it's just not worth it, I need those bps
---
Rank 6 lol
---
I totally get that. I'm a big fan of Myers, myself.
---
W A T E R M A R K
---
The difference is you can't tombstone all survivors with the tombstone piece. To mori all 4 you need the tombstone. And when you combine it with fragrant tuft you are not kicked out of T3.
---
It is also a soft counter to Object of Obsession. It does not work in your terror radius. A big terror radius means OOO is essentially worthless.
---
Dont you have to be running?
---
Shouldve vaulted a second earlier. Hit did connect you're just salty.
---
Thrill of the hunt and devour hope with ruin and haunted grounds is fun. You patroll totems instead of gens. Get a lot of exposed effects. 
---
If you put on the prayer beads and go to Leary's you have a lot of fun. Nurses 3 is just outside the terror radius so I recommend that for some scares.
---
Yeah if you want to debuff a survivor you gotta hit them with a pon equiped while in frenzy
---
Who’s talking about billy dumb ass.
---
They were trying to make it realistic, you have to already be aprinting to fast vault a window now, can’t stand by it and fast vault, it’ll just be a slow vault instead like here.
---
MoM was uncounterable, ghostface can be countered.
---
I’d remove infectious fright and replace it with discordance. It will help slow down gens on top of ruin. 
---
It will also allow you to stalk multiple survivors
---
If legions worked like that hed definetly be strong but he procs deep wounds very consitantly and it would deffinetly be unfun to play against if during the chase he didnt have to do anything but hit you once and done
---
I dont watch stuff with audio because its kate at night but devour hope has always been buggy. Wasnt there an wcploit a few months ago that cauaed stacks to be acheived with less hooks?
---
I main killer and tbh a 3k is perfectly fine
---
Your a pampas ass and the ad hominem is helpful to your cause nor appreciated.Not getting a pip IS losing in this game whether you want to admit it or not. And yea having fun is the end-game of any game,but see the thing about "FUN" is its subjective it can mean allot of different things for allot of different people.
---
 Know what isn't fun? Not even getting to actually chase people because they leave well before you get near them, forcing you to chase them halfway across the map before you ACTUALLY get in a chase resulting in you losing due to not having map pressure.
---
Not having "FUN" is playing a basic bitch m1 killer who has 0 say in the chase and can't even mind-game a tile because its fucking see through. 
---
If your getting shit on by a freddy at rank 1 either 1 of 2 things has happened. Either your dogshit at this game and have no room to talk at all (Seems to be the more likely option) or your teammates were being extremely immersed/altruistic and don't belong at that rank. Either way if your getting stomped at rank 1 by a freddy your doing it wrong friend. There is a reason he's called the meme killer.
---
On a final note the reason people play high mobility killers is to enable them to actual be COMPETITIVE on a map that is imbalanced. Thats all this game really is though, the maps are fucked, most of the tiles are stupidly safe and over 80% of the killers have no way to actually interact in a chase at all. 
---
Thats why people play Nurse, Billy, Spirit and Huntress, they're all good because they have immense map pressure through direct mobility or ranged attacks. They all also have a varying degree of say when it comes to how a chase will end. They're the only 4 killers that have any kind of skill level at all
---
Still a decent comparison
---
Sad you didn't mention Object of Obsession and he's like 4 meters from you behind a wall.
---
.....and then, the screaming starts from the Doctor's Madness kicking in.
---
Demon mask is OK, would be better in a darker red, maybe crimson or scarlett. I don't like print on clothes, I never have done. That's why I don't like the golden wings printed on the phantom Wraith's cloak. But give me something plain like Ash's standard outfit and I'll play it all day.
---
Nah.
---
No it wont, because unlike window lunge hits everyone complains about being about hitboxes when it's about ping, huntress hatchet's aren't just ping, their hitboxes are actually spheres I'm pretty sure.
---
Faves: Pig, Trapper and Hag (i just like being really strategic with my killers). Least: Wraith (once you're hooked, this piece of shit will make sure you're 100% dead), Clown (he can shove those bottles in his ass) and Plague (i'll prefer facing a prayer beads Spirit rather than knowing this bitch has Corrupt Purge)
---

---
Right he seems like a good killer on paper but actually a huge dumpster fire. A post I found that has good reasoning as why legion is bad 
---
The Logic behind the Deep Wound timer
---
The Borrowed Time timer (now called Deep WOund) no longer goes down during a chase, and the counter balance change to that change is that if the survivor goes down via the timer running out, the killer will see the aura of the now downed survivor. However, now that you no longer need to meet any requirements to heal Deep Wound (have medkit, find a person to heal you, use self care, etc), there is literally no scenario where the survivor will run out of time. Here are some examples of scenarios:
---
A survivor has just been inflicted with deep wound, you chase them for a long time and down them by hitting them, you never used the new aura part of deep wound.
---
A survivor has just been inflicted with deep wound, you stop chasing them after a while, which gives them time to get rid of the wound. The timer never was depleted at all.
---
A survivor has just been inflicted with deep wound, you do not chase them at all, giving them time to get rid of the wound. The timer was never depleted at all.
---
There is LITERALLY no scenario where the timer shall ever deplete again, now that there are both NO requirements needed to be met to get rid of the timer AND the timer does not go down during a chase. Without either of those two things happening, the timer can never go down.
---
I love Spirit and Nurse. I find pretty challenging playing Nurse. I hate Nurse (with range or blink add ons) and Doctor (especially the kind that protects those last three gens). He doesn't win killing, he does boring every one to death.
---
It's always worth the risk if you're fast enough to react.
---
I hate ruin, it’s such a boring perk to run 
---
As for the second part, my feelings about it mirror how I feel about SWF: two is fine, three or four is where you get an unfair advantage
---
First two perks are obviously good, the other two, pretty bad
---
But you instantly lose it on hit
---
Was this supposed to be a terror radius? Or the lobby theme? Because I heard both.
---
Perk viability diversity. Each side has like 10 perks of 60 that work consistently
---
Not all cosmetics are supposed to be "related to the killer," they're just supposed to look cool, and honestly, a lot of Trapper's cosmetics look cool... mostly his new stuff...
---
Pinhead is lame 😎
---
I know I used this pic before, but recently I literally have time to roll up &amp; smoke one before a match starts... stay groovy!
---
Except not for survivors when Ghost Face is running uncounterable addons, despite the survivor being face to face with him.
---
You realize the DbD discord has a voice chat feature, so how is it cheating? Bu those standards, camping is cheating as well. Doing gens might as well also be cheating. You downed that survivor, you're cheating.
---
Urban Evasion, Quick and Quiet, Poised, Spine Chill
---
I know what you did last summer, Trappy Sir.
---
I absolutely guarantee you no one went to your twitch channel
---
How about the lantern event? Through experience of that event, I now have trust issues.
---
Absolutely love the legion but can’t stand instant down killers (Billy leatherface and to an extent trapper) they feel so unrewarding for holding a button and getting a down or hook

How do you get pebbles?

Stacking them up on my spirit
---
Amazing. I really hope she gets a Nordic themed skin eventually.
---
Legion is honestly just a dumpster fire of a character if we're being real. He needs buffs but if you give him an inch he takes a mile
---
A game where hair jiggles a fat clown’s stomach jiggles and if it were aloud I’m 99% sure they’d have jiggle physics on Jane’s ass
---
My brother had one of these lol
---
Preach!
---
This please
---
Noob question: what's poised and spine chill?
---
Well I absolutely guarantee you that they did, I had a couple of VODS on there that barely had any views, but after what went down in his stream I gained like 15 views. His viewers were talking about it as well as if it’s some kind of detective shit.
---
“Based on his vods I can tell you that he’s a minor”
---
“Oh yeah this kid just got REKT, probably why he only gets 2 views on his streams”
---
so yeah... check your facts.
---
"AYYYE, fooking 'ell!"
---
Love it! Lmao
---
Yeah this is big brain time
---
Me heading to the door i'm the Girl cause with out my mates carrying me i'd be nothing

What's premonition?

\-\*ghostface tbagging from behind a tree\*- -\*squeaky leather noises\*-
---
Lol yeah he can’t down people in feral frenzy
---
I ended up getting a game as soon as I posted this comment. And then I went against a 4man SWF and they schooled me so hard as my first game with Ghost Face LOL. my luck... I wish the lean was set to Q and E keys...not having to stop holding right click and then being right next to a tree and THEN being able to lean.
---
Wraith has a scarecrow skin now. It’s pretty rad looking. 
---
Hillbilly also has a scarecrow skin, I believe.
---
I'm definitely thinking of throwing this one on! I do also like his other perk "Thrilling Tremors" and I've been running "Overcharge" as well
---
Meanwhile I leveled Kate from 1-50 and got 4 cakes.

Not even just that deep wounds is as scary as a sleeping baby like if you aren’t paying attention it might scare you
---
I’ve literally only ever used pig legion and ghostface, I really like the feel of pig her RBT are a fun mechanic and her dash is great for tricking people and I like being able to catch survivors basically no matter what with legion I wish I could actually down survivors while in frenzy mode though
---
My eyes. Thats bright.
---
It is possible, but it would be very hard to do and probably would come out to be like pre buff Freddy because he can’t just be the good guy doll, he actually have to be a killer, in size and shape.
---
literally the entity
---
don't go too near of the survivor that you are stalking (usually in a gen), survivors have a audio music when you are near them, stalk from far
---
It’s the actual name of the mask and what it’s most identifiable by past scream since it isn’t the same killer as that series
---
True
---
The problem with GF is, if you try to break him out of stealth he might expose you first. 
---
Pig and Wraith are just M1 killers so it doesn't matter that much if you force them out of their stealth condition. 
---
BT needs to be adjusted and have its effect tied to killer proximity instead of Terror Radius.
---
You can hit her after she’s on the hook
---
Yo I had that shit when I was a little kid. And the giant ass knife with blood inside it. :D
---
What cosmetics?
---
It keeps spawning in the most annoying place ever because you hear  it outside and you're like "oh there it is" then you realize it's inside the building and are like "fuck this shit he probably got to hatch first"
---
I play both survivor and killer and as survivor I think two gens should have to be completed and hatch shouldn't be able to be closed for 30 seconds to a minute
---
Surprisingly alot of peoe don't know this
---
Lmao this guy thinks looping is toxic
---
Can you send this to me but only with ghostface
---
I would sign this faster than a billy sprinting away after hooking someone
---
Never said hatch was cheating. It's just annoying when the last few games survivors have gotten out because I hear the hatch outside the main building but it sapwns inside the building so they escape because they see me outside looking for hatch
---
He’s always toxic and is all around just kind of a douche. Your only mistake was going to his stream in the first place.
---
I dunno if I’m late to the party figuring out this new feature... but I imagine this is going to make the DbD experience so much better for a lot of players.
---
For the anniversary cosmetic contest, so many amazing entries, choosing just two seems impossible.
---
Which one, there’s like 8 or 9
---
Hell yea I did I was a goddamn winner with that mask
---
Peek of elementary for sure
---
Sadly with PS4 you can’t actually send in game reports after the game is closed you can only profile report from that point on Sony is a little behind on their reporting system since it basically equates to “Either they actually hacked or do it in game but here block them cause we’re too lazy”
---
Exactly which actually makes him a great camper surprisingly because hooked survivors can't kick you out if you are really close to them because their body blocks some of the screen I believe. Only reason I know this is because I ran a basement build with him because I had no other perks.

Shit bro, thats all you had to say
---
Yeah, I'm using bbq + ruin (almost taking this off since I'm low ranks, that means matchs takes 30 minutes) + I'm all ears + brutal, is working fine to me, his power can counter loops pretty easy, so bamboozle and spirit fury aren't that obligatory

Apparently it’s coming out sept 13, 2019 on a Friday so it could be Jason but I don’t think it’s reliable
---
Very creative! Great job, I love it!
---
Great skin, bad killer
---
Uncle Robert sounds like a chad
---
Only 1 day and 9 hours played
---
Call them out? OK... Good Job. 
---
Waiting for daddy Myers jiggle physics. Then Great job.
---
I doubt it’s Jason because of the lawsuit so it’s probably a new character that they created.
---
Yeah you could have Charles lee ray be able to posses chuckys scattered around the map with a timer
---
The problem is you are playing Meg.
---
I mean how do you handle Michael Myers then?
---
Dark type isn't necessarily "shadow" type btw, it means more "underhanded, schemey, or otherwise uncouth" It's "evil".
---
That being said, Legion should be Dark/Fighting. They're athletic and use numbers to overwhelm to commit their crimes.
---
After rank reset it happens. Give it time and it'll get better. In the meantime just try to at least 1 pip every game so you can be out of the lower ranks and not get matched up with like rank 16-20 teammates that don't know how to hit skill checks and rarely ever do gens.
---
6,600 perfect games to get all P3 if you get a perfect game every time.
---
Since on average as survivor your points will vary with 10k-25k (Provided you're not tunneled or camped on first hook) as its near impossible to max survival unless the killer lets you escape and you self heal the remaining 3k for survival.
---
In other words, it can take beyond 10-16+ k games just to get all the blood points you need as survivor. 
---
As killer you won't always get perfect games either but if you play predominantly killer you'll average around 17-27k most of the time if you get a decent game, still will take a long ass fucking time.
---
This doesn't even count in the idea of maxing perks on characters either, just the max level, adding even more unnecessary grind to a game where the shit you get in the webs is purely RNG at current.
---
I just hope the supposed "Blood Market" concept reworks the grind if its even official or comes out at all.
---
Right
---
You know my roommate?
---
Jed really has some boring facial features which kinda adds to him just being a regular reporter with a boring life which I like plus he looks exactly like I imagined.
---
I did try to but it didn't update properly I think? I'm using a shitty Dell laptop so I ain't got much faith in this changing
---
Rank 5 not level 5
---
nonono, on the bloodweb i got an ebony mori on ghostface at level 5.
---
Same and i still didn't get it in his bloodweb
---
This^ I absolutely hate farming. I want to kill people, not sit and slash the same person for 20 hours. I will kill you. And if you sit there and lose then that's on you, thanks for the easy pips
---
the addons seems fine to me, but this 8% is kinda scary since by now survivors can spot me from the other side of the map
---
So not useless if you like fun. 
---
It’s like Trapper. Very hit or miss as far as winning goes, but fun to chase people into traps.
---
So, you're obsessed with Amanda too?
---
Yeah I agree. I remember one event (Chinese firecracker event maybe?) where there were like 3 or 4 things in each level of the web, I'm assuming they thought that was a mistake but it does feel a bit low
---
It’s basically a spam box which u can clear without even looking at the messages. This is a major win.
---
Someone did an Oopsi.
---
Summer officially starts tomorrow
---
I haven't played in months and I don't wanna come back until disconnect punishment is live and dedicated servers are the start of disconnecting detection
---
Shorty is me watching from the exit gate
---
I'm starting to think a lot of problems would be solved if they'd just create some kinda gesture mechanic for all killers. The infuriating part of being teabagged is having nothing really you can do back. One teabagger is toxic, two is a party.
---
Right fun but hard to 4K
---
So hard to pick. I usually main a killer after buying them and love them nonstop, but my favorite to play as rn is Ghostface. Mega fun. My least favorite to play against would probably be Doctor, just because all the Doctor players I go against are super obnoxious, and then right next to that would likely be Wraith...for the exact same reason. It's not like the killers are challenging to go against, it's just any time I see one, especially with Frosty Eyes, I know it's gonna be a super easy game or a really bad one.
---
Welcome to the Fog! (: 
---
Tip #1 - The game will frustrate you to no end much of the time. It does get better the more you play and the more confident you become. 
---
Other than that...
---
Play both killer and survivor. Even if you develop a preference for one, knowledge of both will hugely help you strategically. 
---
Play all the killers. More than once. About a hundred tier lists make it to Reddit everyday but ignore them. Play every killer a few times and find one that is really fun for you. Then learn how best to use their power in a way that is successful and fun. 
---
Take time to learn the maps. If you struggle to catch survivors in given areas (killer shack, asylum) make use of those when you play survivor. Kate has a perk (WoO) that can help you learn pallet and vault locations as well. 
---
Experiment with different perks, again, several times. From your experience, you’ll learn not only which perks are mostly useful, but you’ll learn to cater your playstyle around them. 
---
I STRONGLY recommend Bond (a Dwight perk) for new survivors. Even if playing solo, you need to have team synergy or no one will make it. I can’t boast about this perk enough and it gives you so much awareness about what the killer and your teammate are doing. 
---
Learn to look behind you as Survivor. This will come in handy during chases and in mind games especially as you learn the maps more. 
---
In my experience, bold survivors win out over immersed ones. Don’t be afraid to run (crouching everywhere takes forever). If you’re almost done with a gen and you hear a heartbeat, try to commit to the gen. Always try to save a hooked friend before they enter the Struggle phase of the hook. If the killer is nearby all the time, consider getting the “Borrowed Time” perk. 
---
Tackle central gens as early as you can. If left til the end, the killer will have a much easier time patrolling and halting progress. I often try to do it first, as at that point, there are more gens for the killer to patrol and you have a better chance of finishing it before the killer checks on it. The more gens that get done, the less the killer has to patrol. You want to make sure they are not close to each other so spread them out. 
---
Take some time to read up on the emblems for both roles. They will guide you in how you play and give a decent indication of what you want to focus on. 
---
I’m fairly active on PS4 as well and not a pro gamer by any means, but I’d be more than happy to help if you want some practice sometime. (:
---
Idk what happened not sure if it was a bug or something?
---
It’s like Unbreakable. You rarely get the chance to fill up the bar, but when you do, it can be game changing. Won two games today alone by wriggling free.
---
Yeah, if you care about doing that every time. I prefer fun.
---
Idk the birds could still counter sitting still, and your fellow survivors could spot you. I don't really see it as goofy, just a high paced varient. But I see where you are coming from.
---
I would actually be HARD down for this. Naughty Bear was SUCH an underpotentialled game but it was still so damn fun to experiment with.
---
Seems to be a glitch in the Matrix
---
Lol hopefully it gets fixed or something.
---
I’ll have to prepare my eyes for lots of squinting. Seeing tiny details from far away is key in this game and on my tiny ass phone ... not gonna’ happen lmao.
---
An unpopular opinion on your unpopular opinion. Ruin mandatory on not a single killer in the game, even at rank 1 vs swf. Ruin is just a tool that pressures gens for you. Not using ruin simply means a killer has to work harder at pressure and most killers just aren't practiced enough/don't want to bother learning to do that. So ruin gets called "mandatory" all the time, which discourages future killers from breaking the ruin dependancy and learning to pressure gens on their own
---
The little spec in the corner got me. Well played
---
Right that’s why I bought legion
---
I'd like to know this as well
---
This would have more impact without the text, for your future meme strength.
---
I think about this a lot. But I find myself pontificating that extending each match even longer is not a great way to go about it. I'd somewhat rather have more killer potential for high-octane gameplay, snowball moments, or temporary shutdown/counteracting of gens (like Corrupt Intervention &amp; Tremors). But I think it is definitely a hard middle-ground to find. 
---
All I know is that, from playing on both sides, lengthy Doctor or Freddy stall games are tedious for EVERYBODY. And at high ranks as survivor, efficiency on gens is key if even 1 teammate can't hold their own in a chase. Things are better than they used to be, but M1 killers still struggle immensely while the top-tiers can end games before a generator even pops.
---
People have been saying this for a long ass time.
---
Ruin makes skillchecks more difficult and thats it, theres no engagement or enabling of a play style. Its dull to go against and its effectiveness is entirely based on RNG, I'v had gens where I'v only gotten 1 fucking skillcheck, making ruin fucking useless there. It can also be removed entirely by cleansing, making it useless, meaning the killer just wasted a perk once gone.
---
People have suggested other objectives or something else but they don;t agree on it. Higher ranks clearly don't waste time on gens and I'm more surprised they haven't gone towards the deathgarden side of things where you've to actively go about the map and find things while avoiding the killer instead of just prolonging the "Hold m1 to win the game". 
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion but I still think its one of the laziest solutions given to help killers in the current state of the game
---
**Once per match** a killer can change the position of one hex toten that haven't been spoted by any survivor (use the same mechanic of GF), so the killer can change it place to another place (one that he feels be more safe)
---
Small Game. 
---
I don’t run it all the time, but love it when I do squeeze it in.
---
Yeah no if I spend $10 on an outfit bet your fuckin’ ass it’s not coming off lmao. Logically I should spend the money on killers and other survivors but like ... I’ll want outfits for them too ... it’s just a nightmare lol.
---
You’re right, Chucky’s impossible.
---
The doll would just be too small...
---
... SO WE NEED A HUMAN WEARING A CHUCKY COSTUME!
---
That is amazing! She looks like such a badass! Good job on the design! &lt;3

---
I want him in so bad
---
You get points for removing it so why not remove it
---
I managed to uncloak him while I was hooked lmao. Idk if that's intended or not but I definitely got the 500 BP for reveal when I saw him stalking around me and then again while hanging on the hook. Just hanging around doing my part I guess😂
---
I agree people just don't know how to counterplay him
---
Nope. They changed it from the PTB. Just used it. It is now anytime INSIDE of 42 (or whatever) meters. 
---
Actually useful. Would be better with a smaller cooldown, but still good.
---
He still exposes you even though you're looking right at him at point blank range
---
This whole description, what the fuck? This is hilariously bad.
---
In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above? At least it is true that man has no control, even over his own...

Also name checks out,  awesome berserk-esque skin.
---
Then what do you recommend
---
Welcome! I don’t have many tips that haven’t been said already but I’d gladly help you play right now if you want I have the same username on here as there I love helping people out with this game!
---
Let the staring contest begin.
---
huh
---
You mean you don’t like turning and hitting a wall?
---
Fair but I'd be afraid of her coming behind me to oink me. When gates open and my teammates are gone I usually just leave.

---
Myers needs more time to reach tier 3 and I can easily hide from sight, Ghostface can just walk, stalk and get me in 4 seconds
---
No man, I'm a killer main and it's not the same thing. *You don't have to maintain the chase.* If you're being pallet looped, you can stop, break the pallet, and move on to someone else. Go check the gens and if you're any good at the game you can catch someone unawares and avoid that whole mess. Then you can hook the person, break the gen, and play the game in a way that's effective and fun. Jeez. You probably are like ten years old or something. Where's Nancy Reagan?
---
I'm contemplating it! We're broke atm, and I'm waiting to see how my PC will run WoW Classic. If it can't, I'll decide if I want to get a second PS4 or upgrade my PC. 
---
All his DCUO(he's really into that game) stuff is on my PSN(I've had it since 2006-2007, so tons of games) now, and I don't think he'll start over. I'm not sure if linking our Ps4s will solve that problem. The dilemma!
---
I’d love to see more mixes and matches of maps or event game modes like multikillers or a random killer from 5 survivors just some viability for the long run
---
What does it do I hear everyone talking about it
---
Anyday I would prefer an oink over toxic. Amanda is one of the only killers that has actually made me screech with an unexpected encounter and i love it. I am pretty sure that killer got a good laugh when I ran straight into a wall due to the panic lmao
---
What’s up with this. Two years ago when I played a lot killers got games instantly. I got an itch to play again recently and wait like 10 minutes before 1 person joined my lobby so I just closed out and haven’t touched it again since.
---
Tiffany when she is still human of course.
---
Entity help me my dick is DIAMONDS
---
The timer is there so the game cannot be held hostage by either side. Most of the time, a survivor can escape. Yes, the killer can be annoying by chasing them around, but there is a hard 2 minute timer and the game ends.
---
“Boohoo, I got screwed over by randomness.”
---
15/10/5% faster actions overall rather than just the exit gate
---
No, Huntress actually does decent damage.
---
Except this whole underage pics drama never had nor still have any solid proof your grandpa couldn't make up in photoshop with a few friends within 5 minutes, yeah, Ochi pretty chill...dickhead. So, he left DeadbyDaylight after being banned several times.
---
Didn't think I could want something so badly
---
You must be a shitty killer if you can find a survivor who is bad enough to not be able to loop you. As i said above (clearly you didnt read it) i dont condone either of these playstyles.  As i also said you can bitch about one so long as you dont bitch about the other.
---
Yeah, it’s random, occasionally it’ll spawn right next to a survivor, occasionally it’ll spawn right next to you.
---
It doesn’t really matter.
---
And even if you by some miracle have the survivor get to the hatch first EVERY SINGLE GAME, who gives a shit? You got a 3k, which is absolutely a victory.
---
But the cat was let out of the bag, they can't remove SWF or else they'll kill the game. 
---
So balance killers around SWF and make an opt in VC in the actual game for soloq.
---
You misspelled Daylight
---
I'm offended you'd think I was one of you breeders.
---
Maybe Ghost/Psychic? Since most the of the time they aren't gonna be hit by a pallet unless timed exactly right lol.
---
Yes, but I see the killer win because of end game collapse more than I see the surv living. I get what it's for and itll still be good for that, itll just give the surv a higher chance at surviving.
---
I mean I just disagree entirely with the trappers cosmetic art direction. Every other killers cosmetics fit them thematically. I feel like that's not the case for the trapper. His cosmetics are more goofy than anything.
---
His new stuff, the miner cosmetic, is at least inline with the characters theme.
---
What this bug does?
---
Really helpful if no one knows, and it’s hilarious watching him react to getting caught... win win.
---
I agree. Discord exists. Coms is too popular on Streamers and Youtubers. 
---
Either incorporate coms or give survivors better in game (non-voice) com tools (like being able to mark things). Then balance killers around that.
---
yeah before mori's were nerfed, I helped a billy out of a pallet for him to drop me right there and mori me. lmao.
---
Candyman would be cool as fuck to have. No idea for power, not my thing but I'd be down
---
*gets exposed anyway*
---
Lol yeah idk what that is all about I was wondering why I can repair generators faster and stuff in general with that perk even though it wasn’t meant for it.
---
I love the barbarian look to it!
---
Exactly. For the sake of their game living they can't remove SWF, so play the balancing game around it. Make it more accessible but open more windows for killers to secure a foothold with it in mind.
---
I didn’t know that lmao but yeah more points.
---
&gt; Holy shit it sounds like someone actually getting murdered 
---
What else are the survivors supposed to sound like? Like they're having the time of their life?
---
You also forgot the sounds being fucked like the chase music being almost unearrable
---
Afaik it's broken, gives it's bonus to everything, including generators. Making it exploitable. Stack on prove thyaelf and toolboxes with friends and it becomes terrible. 
---
No clue why the devs don't disable it though, it's clearly game-breaking.
---
You can get banned but not for dumb shit like that.
---
Oh...
---
So THATS why I’ve been getting gens done so quickly lately!
---
Damn, should have used a smaller font. XD
---
Then all y'all should get banned lmao
---
My only issue with him is how quickly he can stalk. Otherwise I really like playing against him. One time I spotted him for about 2 seconds (and was staring at him) and I still got exposed. If they lengthen the time he has to stalk by a bit then I will have no complaints.
---
Should've paid attention to what the post was about
---
But they don't look cool. They're goofy if anything. The miner cosmetic is the only good one aside from his default.
---
That's making fun of teenagers... he never saw or heard in person and has no idea of their age, you mean.
---
Nice job bro, defiantly hit me with that good feels.
---
See, needing purple addons to be a mid tier killer is an issue. also, spirit is in the top 3 killers, he's NOWHERE near her level
---
Favorite: Huntress/ Ghost Face
---
Least Favorite: Clown/ Doctor
---
Spoopiest: Myers/ Prayer Bead Spirit
---
Sorry I couldn't decide on all of em. They just so good/annoying/spoopy
---
Sounds are all messed up whenever I break pallets the noise isn’t where it’s supposed to be
---
Ghostface is nowhere near a "clusterfuck". Hes pretty balanced and the only thing thats an issue with him is a bug and its being fixed and getting a little help for survivors by adding 4% on each side of the screen to mark him.
---
also No0b3's video isnt a representation of anything since 
---
1. it was the PTB and nobody played seriously in any of those videos
---
2. He barely plays killer so his rank is super low, making the survivors equally as bad
---
3. It was like the first day of the changes, people were still treating him like an joke
---
A lot of their descriptions are pretty ???????? I personally like "A focused focuser, able to focus on focusing and quickly switch focuses" for feng min
---
I see the opposite most of the time. Usually the last survivor can find the hatch first or the killer checks the wrong gate first. 
---
The issue is how much of a chance should the survivor have of surviving? You are the last person alive against someone who killed 3 others. It should be less than 50%. I would say 30% is fair on average. Otherwise, it is robbing the killer of their hard work in the game.
---
What gets me is that apparently it's only affecting \*some\* players. Makes me wonder if there's something we can do to fix it.
---
Pretty cool concept but the purple-ish skin makes her look a bit 'dead',I guess?Also I would reduce the wings on the head a bit and cover the face more,since she's the huntress(she wears masks you know)
---
Honestly that's the best type of horror, which is why I was so cut about Silent Hills being canned after PT, PT was exactly that in a nut shell. Might have to check that out then.
---
I can understand the chase music, but I can't even hear Myers' music when he tiers up, or even in the killer select menu. Even hillbilly chainsaw sounds a lot more quiet.
---
no don't you dare go near my pig with that bullshit
---
Her traps have limited range. Stay closer to them or use addons
---
Nope not going to get banned for camping a hook that's a playstyle dood they can't ban you for that
---
I absolutely agree. I’ve been dealing with how ridiculous he is ever since his console release.
---
Good for Spirit to mask her phasing sound better
---
This also happened to me while playing against a plague. It was just about the hit the end game screen and the game completely shut down. I was able to send in a bug report so I hope they are looking into it asap.
---
Hi
---
To be honest, loyal wathers of either Noob, Puppers and so on would go on with hunt too, if their love rising cutie stars get joked on streams. I just like how people admit toxicity of toxic youtubers, but refuse to aknowledge they would be exactly the same, if you say any shit word about their love icons.
---
Does he still have the two addons that increase his crouch speed further than his Normal movement speed?
---
But the integral argument is that they're not equal! They're not equal because one is objectively toxic and one is a completely valid option. Oh well.. You're allowed to be the bright little flower you choose to be.
---
Repost?
---
I'd say it ties with wearing David's red Lunar event jacket. 
---
I will never take it off despite making me visible from half the map away.
---
It looks like Mr.Crocker when he says FAIRY GOD PARENTS
---
Its on a timer, not just after an unhook but for i believe 60 or 90 seconds
---
With Nurse, post-blink, you can just hold M1 and wildly flick your mouse, and if a survivor is within range, you will hit them most of the time. Pretty bullshit. This is one of the primary reasons why Nurse is bad on console, I think: you can't flick with a joystick.
---
That said, with console as well as Switch and mobile ports being a thing, I would not count on auto aim ever leaving the game. Those platforms need it, and BHVR for some reason wants to keep the game functionally identical on all platforms.
---
Weirdly enough, with the 3.0.0 update, an "AimAssist=False" variable snuck into the GameUserSettings.ini. Don't think it does anything, though. (There are also these other new entries: "DeviceLoginTokenID=", "HandSide=1", "InteractionButton=1", "SharedLoginInformation (LoginProvider="",AuthToken="")", none of which I'm sure what they are about, as they don't really turn up as standard Unreal Engine stuff).
---
That's almost complete unheard of.
---
It only activates for a certain amount of seconds after being unhooked (40/50/60, depending on which tier of the perk you have).
---
Deadass how it is in them damn cornfields.
---
i got screenshot evidence.
---
They are both inarguably toxic. Why do you think survivors get so much hate for it? And why killers get so much hate for camping? The only difference is looping infinitely takes some time to learn and perfect while camping only requires 2 hits, which anybody can get lucky and accomplish.
---
Never mind the fact that by the time the killer gets to where you were on BBQ ... you could already be on the other side of the map. But that sounds totally accurate for all of my teammates whenever I'm playing solo. I love going against purple or green rank Killers with rank 20 teammates that are playing their first match ever. Meanwhile when I'm killer I always get higher rank survivors that are in a survive with friends group and Bully the fuck out of me
---
I don't find a 3k to be a victory but that probably because I play to win and I don't play to have fun
---
Allow me just to say that leatherface was added after Hillbilly so it is still possible plus alot of people want Harry Warden in the game so he'll probably get added eventually
---
Is there a reason or is because he belongs in a can
---
I feel like Doc should be Electric / Psychic.
---
Oh shit you right chief, my 🅱️
---
They can't ban you for being a bad killer.
---
Tombstone piece does not stack with Tuft of hair
---
Wow, that mask is a real blast from the past
---
yes, he hit the wall, he missed, whats your point?
---
It's bait my dude
---
Stop camping tho.. you'll get better go chase someone off a gen.. let them save then hook them again you get points for everytime you hook someone you wanna hook everyone 3 times for Maximum points. Only way to get better is to try.
---
I went into a game just now, got hooked (also had perks for obsession) and got unhooked. I waited so long he didn’t get to me until everyone else was dead and it was way long than a minute probably 3 or 4 minutes. Idk what the problem is the skill check isn’t showing.
---
Eh, I know. Its still something I've seen people arguing or complaining over tho. I'm not taking it too seriously
---
thank God, I thought that was just me going insane.
---
The survivors were really angry, trust me. I just felt bad that they lagged :(.
---
very nice
---
Getting a step ladder to hook people , lmfao. Chucky's bitch-ass doesn't belong in the game.
---
If you have PS plus you can upload your saves into the cloud and redownload all your games. :)
---
I bought mine refurbished so it was a bit cheaper but yeah, it's still money so I get not being able to get one just yet.
---
I definitely recommend it when you can, especially if you are both gamers! We kind of just chill together but on two different consoles. It's neat.
---
I got shoehorned into this build, but it’s been working pretty well for me: Discordance, Pop Goes the Weasel, Monitor and Abuse, and Nurse’s Calling. While MandA might be a little too much, I don’t have all too much else and it makes me extra sneaky for sneaking. The rest synergize well with being sneaky and giving me a little gen control. I can target a gen that’s being done quickly and sneak on over. Get my stalk on at least one, down them and possibly hit the other. Hook the insta-down, and then regress the gen a ton. Find the dude healing with my Nurses, and go about my way. It’s been solid, overall.
---
Can we report this stuff? Played against a SWF with all 4 wake up and got gen rushed in about 3 1/2 minutes. I'm pretty suspicious when all 4 have it and it's a pain to face.
---
This is why you bring object :)
---
This.
---
Yeah I mean, I get that it’s annoying, but HOW is this the games fault?
---
Lots of people want to play Killer right now, lots of people want to play Ghostface, and lots of people want to practice Ghostface too.
---
But if you play Survivor, you can find and be in a game in 5 minutes easy.
---
the generic enduring spirit fury combo, maybe nurses calling? whispers is probably good on him
---
God man I have a deep hatred for that map. Every time I play killer on that map I lose.
---
When did I ever say it was the games fault?
---
this just bad rng or actually what the devs want?
---
no regerts
---
Ace in the hole. Very situational but damn if it dosent feel good to get a purple item with add ons.
---
Sorry...I was eating a milky way
---
Well from what I know he used to be extremely un fun to play against so they nerfed him and now he’s one of the worst killers. After Freddy, I hope they rework Legion.
---
oh you would hate Texas Chainsaw Massacre
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(not said in a bad way, I love that movie, but not good to watch if you're impatient and not super into horror)
---
Mending is not supposed to down people, just like RBT are not supposed to kill them
---
Yea I'm on the side of saying Ghostface deserves the hotfix instead of not getting one at all because his ability is inconsistent and easily abused by players and after the fix I believe people will understand him more of just abusing his abilities akin to kinda like old legion but less annoying. I believe we need to have reasonable dicussion rather than baiting people or just say oh no he doesn't need a nerf without any evidence same goes for the other side
---
I got ruin but no bbq :((
---
Love that little pause like "ehh let me just give it to her".
---
I actually just noticed that today, in a killer lobby two Fengs loaded in with the default outfit, and then switched to their actual outfits a second later.
---
Sorry for the confusion
---
But it’s supposed to be a problem which it isn’t at the current moment without one of the blade add ons making it as useful as pre buff hex traps
---
 https://imgur.com/3IIRU9N
---
Survivors are all the same lol, you can have "a good Quentin build" with another survivor
---
He is already getting a fix in the hotfix if search the forums. It's more of a fix just for him and making his ability less abusable and more easy to spot by 8%
---
Honestly I play for fun so I'm not ever up to date on what's broken unless it's obvious. Could you explain the exploits he has? And what hotfixes they're doing, or what you'd wanna see?
---
How?
---
If you play at a decent level as survivor you get 50-80k. I only played survivor during this event and honestly is way faster. 
---
I'm not a really good survivor, still able to manage that, so idk dude
---
Not unpopular at all. 2nd and third objections have been suggested countless of times here by myself and others. The devs would rather spend almost 1 year coming up with an elaborate way to close the hatch rather than take the year coding in secondary and third objectives for survivors.
---
Hex: Ruin is indeed a very lazy way to extend the game.
---
I genuinely thought that was intentional and I had to deal with it cus of BHVRs ineptitude.
---
No. Having a Beast of Prey option in a chase when you want it is what makes his power great. You can use it to ambush and then win the loop mindgame. Recovery add ons for his power are best imo as they allow you to do this more often.
---
That sounds fun! Thank you for the information. I have trouble researching things like that and finding out things with any certainity for myself. 
---
So, I can just create a new PSN but still have all my games? There's no way for me to keep my original PSN and him to have his saved characters on DCUO on a new PSN, or is that what you said?
---
I genuinely wonder what ranks these people are to think Ghostface is op
---
Two things wrong here. 
---
“Jason” isn’t a killer in dead by daylight. 
---
It’s your fault this happened. If you don’t like farming, don’t do it. He played the ultimate mindgame.
---
You don't have to change PSN, you can have the same account on multiple devices. I would suggest your husband gets his own user profile if he wants to have his saves seperate from yours. You can also shared games between users by putting your profile in their devices. :)
---
Lame enough to have Jason as a killer I suppose.
---
Ruin is a thing
---
Yep but since alot of GhostFace players are exploiting these bugs they don't really want them removed or easier to spot because well they are strong. but as a Ghostface main(could change down the line) I'm pretty excited as I love playing as difficult killers like Current Freddy. I love these changes as they make him a actual stealth killer unlike oh hurr Durr allow me to stalk in the open.
---
I stand corrected. You won this battle good sir
---
lvl isnt rank.
---
Rank is from 20 to 1
---
It's really only good if you play Billy
---
i was wondering who i didnt hook. thanks for this
---
Yep I'm saving this. And when he comes out I'll sure to remind you to eat a shoe or a fish sandwich whichever or if he doesn't then that will suck but eh.
---
Personally my chase music is usually only 10%  while other people have had their volume twice as loud. I've even had people claim that they could hear my chase music while they were across the map.
---
I feel attacked right now, I'm in this picture and I don't like it
---
Its stupid enough just watching Legion carrying a David...
---
I’m bad at the game and it takes forever to find a match so dbd content it is!
---
oh YEAH
---
Like the pic but those perks arent broken lmao
---
I'm pretty sure the majority agrees with you on Ghostface and his ability and I believe alot of "Ghostface mains" are gonna ditch him immediately after the hotfix
---
Well everyone was rank 20 and I was the only rank 15
---
Hahahaha lol
---
I'd tap that.
---
With a pallet of course
---
Yesss he's the easiest for me to play because I'm a stealth person. Honestly he's a godsend for my killer plays
---
these bugs are totally worth all the benefits and anyone who says else wise is fucking nuts. They are good points, but if we had to choose all or nothing, wed all take the bad with the good
---
thats not that weird at this Time tbh.
---
Rank differences of 5 are fine and at 4am in europe there arent that many People playing
---
🤣
---
I honestly think you're the only one because alot of people think he is either OP and needs a nerf or just balanced the way he is. As a killer main he is okay? He is very inconsistent with the spotting mechanic and can easily abuse his ability in chases so I'm on the needs a nerf side I personally believe you're the only thinking he is weak besides people that can't really get a hang of him
---
I only queue with people who only say oink
---
Nurse should be part flying, and I feel like legion should be part fighting, due to all the vaulting.
---
Nope he is weak in spots such as spine hill and all the other detection perks but then again he has a black robe making it harder too detect him
---
Thought this was an horror game not a walk on the beach simulator. I thought pressure and having anxious moments were the point of it but maybe it's just me
---
r/whoooosh
---
I thought I was just a dumb new player losing survivors in the corn
---
no it was just two matches ago where this guy would just swing and shake his screen and hit me or I'll be behind him completely and he is facing the opposite direction and still hit me it is really annoying and quite confusing
---
It changes to *viking death metal*
---
RIP adept ghostface
---
?
---
This is something you can expect with any character that can 1-shot survivors.
---
What happened to Wake Up?
---
I will eat my current shoe. Mud included.
---
lol that's what I did for the Plague Adept
---
I would say wait for a rank reset; that's what I usually do for adepts :/ but since you got real close...you got this bro
---
Nah man, I love games as much as the next guy, but I wouldn’t want my hobby to be my full time job. Just takes the fun out of it imo. Some people may feel different but that’s how I feel
---
No clue
---
Adrenaline doesn't reward poor play. You have to get every gen done for it to even do anything.
---
Torch the character lol
---
Mrs. Kate and Watch
---
Well we'll see in a year.
---
tru
---
In regards to adrenaline, I’d say to balance it just give it an objective score requirement to activate, boom problem solved 
---
damn is it annoying when the last gen pops and everyone is healed 
---
As for NOED, even as a killer main I agree, no perk should provide an advantage of that level without requiring some form of skilled play to receive it
---
Good luck with getting spirit fury, I'm like 20 webs past 50 and still havent even seen spirit fury ;-;
---
I thougt of a perk i called fuk off when you unhook a suvivor near a killer it will hevly stun them or teleport them to basment
---
Or a couple months. Fingers crossed, eh?
---
the main server is honestly shit to be honest your better off going to certain dbd content creators discords to actually have a conversation about the game
---
Honestly it seems like Leatherface is kinda built for camping. I just CANNOT get any control over his chainsaw swing during a chase.
---
Just 720 them 🧠
---
If you play nurse you already have the nuske memory..
---
It's useless for you but a nice tool for new players especially on console
---
Pretty much impossible on ps4 at least, me and my friend tried it when I first got the game
---
Well (and I know this is dumb) why not have him called the scream? I know non-horror fans who know him as that and hell even samination called him the scream when Wraith introduced him into The Hookers in his scream video from ages ago
---
if he is that close you're getting stabbed either way
---
lil extreme but ok
---
Better perks on new released survivors and killers mainly. The last good perk to come out besides Mettle of Man (which promptly got gutted) was Corrupt Intervention and it's only really good on Trapper/Hag
---
Yeah I hate this game for that. Can only do kill your friends if you want that. Friday the 13th is a random killer in a public lobby so there’s a game for ya
---
That's like 14/20 games for me
---
Its because his stealth break mechanic is broken they think he is OP
---
They cant separate a not working feature from an intended function of a feature and its kind of worrying
---
is infinite fucking mending a thing again?
---
\&gt;makes me walk at you
---
\&gt;leaves
---
just go
---
yes that is 100% correct
---
I disagree kinda because his ability offers alot of pressure if he stalks a survivor and downs them giving hook pressure or if he slugs and managed to get another person down he has alot of pressure because 2 people can't do anything but that mainly depends on how skilled the player is or how inconsistent it is.
---
Unnerving Presence for smaller skillchecks. And it doesn't do anything for the sneaky killers.
---
This cracked me up! 😂
---
Sound sgood
---
i just got home off a 16 hour shift. I am guess I missed the window?
---
I mean “Jason” is semantics at this point - you knew who I was talking about. But I guess it’s a lesson for next time.
---
Eh depends but I believe the next killer is not licensed but we'll wait and see. Good luck on the bet
---
He's literally rank 11 lmao
---
You want him to go against literal baby survivors?
---
That's some bullshit.
---
oh god oh fuck
---
Apparently you have to line up your head with his head... it is still kinda buggy sometimes IMO, but yeah... some of his stuff is stupid. Like... I will be looking at him and he is super close, but I still get exposed, when I should have revealed him... they are hopefully going to hotfix all of the bugs he has, soon....
---
Trapper looks like your Dad?SHOW US!
---
I have a uncle that looks like the clown too
---
I’m gonna guess you meant Michael
---
Accidentally exploited that because I had a gate daily, oops
---
Every Wendsday a new cosmetic set comes out and this week's was Ghostfaces raining blood outfit set. I believe they'll release the licensed sets first before the originals.
---
i'm really targeting the kind of people who hear a heartbeat hide in a corner and waste around 20 second when they know someone else is being chased
---
Don't forget about object lol
---
god damn it I should have spent the fucking blood points. people fear  mongered saying they would disappear
---
You can't pull up to a new stream talking shit. Streamers have to deal with trolls all day and they usually remember the names of regular viewers.
---
A huge part of the problem is that Leatherface's big thing is being able to down multiple people at the same time. Unfortunately, unless survivors are very dumb or quite new, having multiple people clumped together is quite rare, unless everyone is in the basement or otherwise swarming a hook somewhere. I think this is part of the camping Leatherface stereotype, to force that situation to happen, because otherwise it won't happen naturally.
---
So next week she'll get them?
---
Thrilling tremors is so good lmao
---
No matter how fast I run 
---
I can never be worse then Freddy
---
actually put both of them on as a regular build before ghost face 
---
Let’s just say he’s probably not gonna have a good day
---
That was the best line for that episode lol!

&gt;I don't care about ranking up, I just wanted the adept trophy. He's the only killer I have who doesn't have it
---
I am not talking about ranking, I am talking about how Chaser emblem works.
---
You’re a better man than me.😅
---
If I get a stalk off, I get looped til it runs out, or until they are downed and two gens are done. Or they just spot me, and I chase them and get looped for 3 gens.
---
Literally if someone starts crawling in those fields I just go look for someone else lol no way in hell am I about to find them anytime soon
---
Most likely but since the Saw sets are different they'll release them in different weeks. The sets that release are random and I'm just taking a shit in the dark so the max you'll have to wait is 2 weeks then after those they'll release.
---
We have ghostface and they have wake up. Seems they balance eachother out :)
---
Yup. Just like when Tinkerer tier two was bugged. People abuse the hell out of bugs.
---
What gpu do you have? And in game what is an average fps? Like do frames dip below 60?
---
UGH I HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG FOR MY BABY TO BE CUTER
---
I looked at him for such a long time and he wasn’t revealed so yeah that
---
MoM wasn't strong, it was broken. Big difference there.

Anything that is huntress with hair (the almost non existent she has don't count) is a yes please for me
---
throws random hatchet just incase
---
Don't worry soon pig will become beautiful and I mean at least Pig is getting cosmetics while Freddy , Leatherfaces and Micheal mains are crying on the inside while Ghostface and Pig are laughing at them being cosmeticless
---
Literally first leveling Perk for Ghost Face was Monstrous Shrine xD. I then proceeded to fet Territorial Imperative and Underwhelming Presence xD
---
Is that Mel Gibson
---
Every game I've ever played even after the major nerf on him has had dcs. Whether it be my teammates or me playing him. Legion causes people to dc more than any other killer. 
---
I hate it...
---
I really hope they fix his stalking. Getting tired of staring right at him for ages and nothing happens.
---
Well that’s the second embarrassment of the night.
---
You can stalk to replenish the exposed effect currently and plus I've never been looped for more then 1 gen so it must be that the survivors are just really good at looping or you aren't the best at it or maybe I've just been getting lucky who knows.
---
Pretty much.
---
But just think how long the lower tier killers of the game have needed time to freakin breathe in the higher ranks. How long have red rank killers had to have ruin in most of their games out of necessity? How long have survivors complained that sitting at a gen and completing skill checks was boring?
---
People have suggested everything from: 
---
* Needing to poor gas in gens before work can begin on them
---
* Needing to collect wrenches in order to start work on gens (if one doesn't bring in a brand new part)
---
* Repair circuit breakers at exit doors while gens are being completed, so that the exit door handle functions later in the game
---
* Having certain gens be a puzzle to repair instead of just skill checks.
---
* Needing to flip switches in the map's basement in order to power-up certain areas around the map.
---
Not to mention all the cool totem ideas people have suggested.
---
If they did 3 of those 5, gen time can be reduced to 30 seconds without ruin, longer with it. And more survivors would spread out around the map to accomplish one of the 3 tasks needed to allow for escape of a map. And killers wouldn't feel they have to bring in ruin or else get gen rushed.
---
But this is what BhVR sees when people make these suggestions:
---
"Skill checks on 5 gens is difficult enough".
---
Yeah difficult for a 9 year old.
---

Bruce Campbell

It took them 2 weeks to mention they were banning people. This has been 48 hours. Dont be stupid.
---
Only when I am playing bad or the survivors are far too good, which is fine. You lose some, you win most.
---
It’s worse when the hatch appears in the corn too
---
Bum bum dun da da dum da da da dum dam ban ban
---
I mean MoM really needed the nerf. sure it was overkill but it still needed it plus who buys the dlc just for a perk that is obviously getting nerfed. 200 IQ people that's who
---
There's also a bug where being stunned or picking up a Survivor while in Feral Frenzy causes FF's white VFX around the edge of your display to become semi-permanent (it also reverts the female Legionnaire's sounds to being female again because spaghetti code).
---
Poor Jeff. They did him dirty :(
---
I’d say they’re just as easy to beat, because facecamping is a shitty strategy, and if the survivors have half a brain between them all, it’d probably put the killer at a disadvantage.
---
But that doesn’t really matter anyway. My point was really that voice chat isn’t part of the game. I expressed that point very badly, admittedly, but it being in the Discord doesn’t make it a part of the game.
---
Does matter how long it takes them (and I think they'll take their sweet ass time fixing a killer bug), what matters is:
---
Will they put a big ass "you will be banned if you do this" message in the coming weeks. Cause myself nor the OP seem to think that they will. I feel very confident that they won't. Same way they won't punish DCers since they are mostly survivor mains that's doing it. But if mostly killers were DCing I bet they would have came up with a strong ban policy long ago.
---
Anything is possible, nothing is impossible, everything is probable.
---
Ya that's true. It's just strange they're also branching out into the mobile market after helping with that game to me
---
Scream and ghostface aren’t owned by the same people since the mask and costume was made before the movie so Behavior would have had to either get the redesigned show mask which a lot didn’t like or get two sets of licenses which would have put the development way behind schedule
---
Welcome to hell, then.
---
You’re gonna hate it here with that mindset.
---
^Although ^its ^worth ^pointing ^ out ^that ^a ^3k ^is ^still ^a ^victory ^because ^you ^killed ^more ^survivors ^than ^got ^away.
---
Just keep playing, the game has an interesting learning curve and the more you play the more you’ll understand all the killers and how to loop and run them around. Just more hours and you’ll get better
---
Probably bc one Survivior DCing fucks over Surviviors and makes it harder to play the game. Killers DCing makes the game impossible to play. Ever stop to think that? When in an asymmetrical game you have the power position, you have more responsibility for the health of the game.
---
you gotta buy the dlc on steam for the white outfit, comes with a white knife too
---
&gt;Amanda: Is this the one you always talk about?
---
Yes. I'm the leader of the cult, mom
---
Funny enough, I was farming with some survivors as Ghostface earlier and joked that I was Casper.
---
Oh ok. I play ps4 and still see it though
---
Don’t you mean “on a pallet?”
---
Because this is a horror game with iconic slasher characters and people want their favorites? Barely anyone just thinks about killers being balanced or good when they ask for them. It wouldn’t work but don’t act like people are irrational for wanting him.
---
Just have it be Charles Lee Ray and he has some Chucky Dolls he controls with “Voodoo” magic, he can place em around and they attack survivors or harass them or something. 
---
You get Chucky, you get a human sized Killer.
---
Can somebody explain this to me I feel stupid
---
No it's not I'm saying this because i have no friesnda that play dbd and I'm lonlt jeez your soo rude wh
---
I was just in a match where several times the camera would snap turn just to hit a barrel. There is aim assist as killer and it sucks.
---
Jeff’s fucking face though
---
I use Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst, Self Care, and Lightweight.
---
Now that Ghost Face is out, I took off Self Care and added Spine Chill.
---
The other variation I use of this is Urban, Lightweight, Lithe, and Quick and Quiet.
---
I did this exact thing to a Nurse the other day and they also did that 😂
---
You’re not the only one, I think he’s pretty middle of the road.
---
Reworked DS is one of the best perks in the game.
---
The main menu before you click a mode where all the survivors are chilling by a campfire surrounded by trees while the killers looking at them out of sight
---
Best way to learn to play against them is to play as them. You can learn to destroy all her traps by running when she picks someone up. Nothing she can do. You also learn how to trigger the edge of the trap and turn when someone instantly teleports and swings.
---
Honestly this, just keep playing, figure out how each tiles set up and how to run it effectively, but yeah just keep playing
---
But is this supposed to be a meme or a leak
---
Lol
---
Buy the DLC, not spend Auric Cells on the character.
---
I like this one cuz it still goes with her theme of puking and stuff . Also it looks great apart from that too. Good job
---
I’m not sure if ur meming at this point
---
Lol, if only he didnt expose you while you look at him point blank....
---
I’m not I’m just confused
---
Danny leaves incriminating evidence to raise his thrill. It’s his whole thing.
---
Big respect for nurse mains, it's not easy
---
Just a counter to deerstalker ? Or i'm missing something ?
---
What two overpowered perks did they gut in the past 6 months? One is Mettle of Man, but if the other one you're speaking of is that hook-immunity perk called DS then they didn't neuter that at all and it's just as ridiculous as it always was. Only now it forces a killer to leave someone alone for a full minute in a game even when that person is following you around (ya know, because it's totally tunneling when the survivor knows they have DS and taunts you) and in the process they fucked up some killer obsessions (of which they have yet to fix). In fact they even fucking buffed the stun time after just a few weeks and then NERFED our only perk that somewhat helped against it (Enduring). They didn't gut shit about DS.
---
What?

---
That was just a toxic survivor don’t let them being toxic get in your way they probably think they’re amazing at everything and get angry when anything says otherwise
---
Wait, infinite mending legion is back?!
---
Heheh hey you've seen her two outfits yeah? What do you think about using her test subject head and weapon with her leather outfit? I thought itd be cute

---
I haven't played her in months so it was really awkward. Took a long break for personal reasons. Got my stacks at least so that makes me the true winner here.
---
Quick and quiet instead of premonition would be better imo
---
Don't you think licensed  will do?
---
I haven't played in a very long time, this was the setup I've used for this character back when I used to play. Are there any other perks that are now considered meta? Or are just an overall better choice? My playstyle consists of helping other players off of hooks, healing, and repairing; I also like to mess with the killer a bit to distract for teammates. Pretty much helping the team with the best chance to escape
---
This may be just me but I don’t see a point in having Premonition and Spine Chill at the same time as they both have kinda the same purpose. I use Spine Chill though I know a lot of people recommend to not use either.
---
I’m not the best player so I don’t wanna give TOO much advice lol.
---
Sorry I’m stupid and don’t get it why didn’t he run pass after he used decisive
---
They did! I don't understand why tho. I was actually panicking looking around going 'nononono!' I could hear him but not see him. So now i always run Deerstalker now, just incase I run into another Jeff.
---
The male version of Huntress' skin?
---
If you go to the psn store and buy the ghostface dlc there it’ll give you the skin
---
Dude, you aren't focusing enough
---
Right, didn't even notice that haha. Thanks, I'll look into changing one of them for a better perk.
---
I bought with auric dbd is rascist
---
You also forgot about MoM stacks not counting on protection hits and ghost face still being able to 1 shot you after you've exposed him and your exposed status is gone off your screen, unable to mend, heal, wiggle or recover after being stabbed by legions frenzy attack. 
---
Let's not forget the 30 minute queue times for killers right now.
---
Holy I didn’t even hear about the bbq glitch. I’ve been tripping out all day
---
I had one for a few Halloweens but I didn't have fake blood so I smelled like strawberry lemonade
---
I use the AMD A10-5800K. It is a bit old since I got it when it came out.
---
 For DBD, I'm not sure, but I think it's around 30 fps because, in comparison to other videos in the subreddit, it's not that smooth. However in other games like lol, it says I'm at 60 fps, but it dips a lot.
---
Consistency my ass. It's for making the game easier for survivors and just that. I've had plenty of survivors in the red ranks break me out of stealth, and so have plenty of streamers I've watched. The red rank survivor's monitors aren't some special edition from the future, they have the same monitors as every one else. Only they know to aim at Ghostface in the middle of the screen and low rank survivors choose not to then completely that just because they see GF on the side of the screen should mean that he should be broken out of stealth.
---
hmm, i’ll have to try Discordance on him.
---
And then I have moments where I clearly nail someone with a hatchet and they don’t get hit.
---
Yo what's that shard by the mori? The ultra rare one.
---
originally he was and if there were 3 typings, he would have fire. But he mostly uses a psychic like abilities (putting survivors to sleep, and now coming soon teleporting, etc). And well, he's ghost because he's a demon.
---
Need a month to actually know how good/bad he is. Its uh day 2/3 (?) Opinions are fine but the issue is people demanding buffs/nerfs right this instant or as soon as possible
---
because at the end of the day he's still just a dude, im reserving ghost to more spiritual/demon like entities.
---
A splinter, they should up for you to try dlc killers
---
Lemme guess, you came from his stream cause they linked this reddit hah? Yeah I think I’m just gonna stop right there cause your opinion means nothing, go back and watch him play Mario dude.
---
It's okay Susie, the rest of us like you
---
You can only use it when injured
---
When the chase music starts and you don’t see a survivor
---
Go back to watching his stream bud, you’re not wanted here.
---
pretty neat
---
I got all the DLC and havent seen this once that's weird
---
it does though?
---
Either take spine chill or premonition you dont need both. I'd swap sprint burst lithe or balanced.
---
I've been injured,  and it never goes thru. Literally JUST happened to me last match. He still followed and exposed me,  then once he got close I tried to use dead hard but it didn't activate.
---
&gt; Accidentally exploited
---
Wink (*ゝω・)ﾉ
---
He needs to be in the center of the screen for a whole 1.5 seconds. I both break him out of stealth frequently and get broken out of stealth frequently so it’s not an issue with the game.
---
Dead hard is very tricky. Timing is key with it and sometimes you’ll hit the key to activate it and the frames will fuck you. Its all a tossup honestly.
---
Everyone said decisive is going to be useless and look at it now, still one of the best perks
---
He's pretty okay, has the same issue all M1 killers have. Decent pressure but not enough to be consistent at rank 1 like nurse/billy/spirit. I played survivor for about an hour today and had 0 issues getting him out of stealth so making it easier to isnt something that's great. Def a fun killer though cause tbagging toxic survivors at the end is pretty noice
---
I can kinda see The Shape of it
---
Thanks! We've been playing since he bought the game and we suck so much lmao. But hey, practice makes perfect!
---
exactly, its for those who don't have the dlc
---
I'd also recommend playing killer when your on your own aswell, once you play enough killer and learn the basics it will be a lot easier playing survivor aswell as you have to think what the killer would do as a survivor
---
This is the build I wanted to run, but after using Discordance from p1-p3 due to no other options, I think I’ll put it in place of Sloppy Butcher.
---
Will bro, after you idiots learn the difference between Arian and Aryan, maybe going back to finish school will be a good start? Why don’t you pass the information along to pug ha?
---
MoM is still a usable perk, you just have to work for it
---
As a survivor, I am never hidden from the killer
---
As a killer, I can never find a survivor
---
I know. Harassment can mean so many things but the legit psychos need to be watched. Honestly half the insults they come up with are funny anyway like one person told me the hope my demons were exorcised after the game. People just need to move on in video games.
---
Why not just slug the person for 60 seconds or Mori the person so they can’t use it?
---
not true, chase music and the music that plays when the exit gates are powered are also nearly mute. All music levels are nearly mute for me, be it survivor or killer, or even the menu theme.
---
\*finishing school
---
Good lord. I can see why you only have 6 followers on your twitch channel with that attitude.
---
try 99ing the stalk meter and completing it once you're sure you can get them
---
Also cant be used when exhausted. Not sure what other perks your using.
---
Why are you guys defending this it makes sense to revert the change now that it doesn’t affect enduring.
---
deerstalker reveals survivors in the downed state, thats it
---
Ok, but can we talk about how fun it is vaulting 24% faster with the bugged Wake Up + Resilience?
---
Perks can decrease the distance required to disable his Night Shroud.
---
I barely ever stream, having a full ass streaming schedule takes the fun out of it. I don’t wanna end up being another jackass loser on the internet that’s super full of himself and uses his viewers to validate himself as a person. 
---
And hey dude, it’s nice of you to check my channel out! Have you finished your homework on me yet?
---
sounds like the guy was mad, but as everyone said its not optimal
---
Where the devil have I been?!
---
I know what Deerstalker does I'm just trying to understand his question.
---
For survivors it's We'll Make It, Dark Sense, and Deja Vu
---
Oh, don't worry. I wouldn't do myself the disservice of checking out your channel. I used socialblade. 
---
:)
---
&gt;The next time you're put into the dying Health State your aura is no longer revealed to the Killer.
---
this ONLY counters deerstalker and BBQ&amp;C in certain situations where the killer decides to slug you to secure the final kill
---
You mean there is something that drives survivors more mad than the Doctor?
---
Like that makes it any better lmao, you still took your time to search me up, why is that? Is daddy pug gonna give you a spanky if you refuse to cooperate? Awwe poor child.
---
I had to embrace the legion bug to negate the wake up bug so I could get though the last hour or so of the bloodhunt earlier. This better be fixed in the hotfix lol
---
Butchered how?
---
So now that there is egc nerf noed to only last 60 seconds.
---
There are add ons to reduce the distance required to break his stealth.
---
It still does this
---
The worst survivors are the most toxic against a non seasoned Nurse. It’s one of their only chances to actually not get downed within seconds so when the inevitable down comes they get salty.
---
What the...
---
Mother of god. Can't wait until you get banned. :)
---
I wonder why they aren't able to just disable the perk for the time being until they get around to putting out a fix.
---
He's Garbo and nurse is still king
---
nice
---
Send the survivors to Valhalla
---
When the Killer consumes Enduring from Mettle of Man, the Survivors aura is revealed to the Killer when their outside of a 16, 24, or 36 meters until the Survivor is put into the dying Health State. 
---
That line is refuring to the aura revealing aspect of Mettle of Man. That's it.
---
I’ve had someone say I probably look like Quinten and I think that is the only time this game has gotten close to killing me
---
Or better, the BEE
---
Tits man
---
You have to keep in mind how unoriginal you were in making the joke. A lot of people watch him, and a lot of people chat in his channel. That was probably the 9849458495849584958495849584th time he had heard the "joke". Honestly, I don't blame him. I would have just banned you for being about 3 days late to the party.
---
What original post are you talking about? I posted that one on my profile instead of on r/deadbydaylight . So I deleted it MYSELF. you really are making yourself look like an idiot here. Goodbye I’m tired of this.
---
I think the one I got wasn't a mask but instead a skeletal chest piece.  Was really funky and I don't think I ever actually used the blood bit on it.
---
You weren’t even hating on the movie and still got downvoted.. damn
---
Yeah, I would walk away too. There was never any version of this where you came out looking good.
---
And here we see the average MoM abuser, still salty about not being able to bully M1 killers with their survive with friends. Whether they'll actually accomplish anything with their shitty memes, no one knows.
---
Or maybe stop camping??
---
You want them to unhook, just walk away and go check the gens and engage in chases. Getting 1 kill isnt as important as getting several hooks and everyone esaping.
---
Very nice
---
Because it can just be assumed that unless it's explicitly stated "Does not stack" it should stack.
---
Just leave the hook and patrol don't be afraid I nlknow you can do it man
---
winning a game is up to the survivors not the killer so completely disagree
---
I dont buy cosmetics but id buy this one.
---
Sorry I don’t watch his streams everyday. I don’t keep up with his chat, OOH NOO!!! So yeah proceed to ban a viewer that was trying to give his channel another try. What I said wasn’t even that big of a deal, he could’ve obviously handled it in a better way. But no, he proceeded to calling me a racist bc of my name when he doesn’t know the difference between aryan and arian. And so what if I have true before it? Does that make my name racist in any way??! No. It. Does. Not.
---
What's the bug?
---
oh okay, you've just decided to word it in the most confusing way possible  
---
you'd much rather phrase it as "when put into the dying state Mettle of Man no longer reveals your aura" because otherwise the text would imply ANY aura revealing perk is countered
---
Oh my god, you really are an idiot. Holy shit. Makes sense since you came from his stream. I bet you’re getting good energy from arguing with a kid. You really are sick. Since you’re such an adult and seem to know everything, how tf did your kind not know the difference btw aryan and arian. When in fact it’s just a name.
---
I mean, yeah, but there are 4 on the totem :p
---
Cant believe you spent $8 on a single DLC character lul
---
Tis rough, got most of the perks I want except spirit fury and I know I grabbed the teachable lol even checked like 5 times
---
I'm looking below and I'm seeing 3.
---
Just saying.
---
We can have Chucky AFTER Pinhead.
---
They defend it because they don't want their crutch perk touched. I brought up that bullshit perk having the longest stun in the game and that it should be brought back to 3 seconds. The devs, who lied about it going back to 3 seconds, are going to keep it as the longest stun in the game at 5 seconds.
---
Annhilation though...
---
That doesn’t stop ds from being active try harder next time
---
Look at one closely in game, dangling from the little silver chain there is a 4th :)
---
Definitely dealing with a leatherface main
---
It is! I'm gonna use that head with the leather outfit and subject weapon.
---
Noed is different there is a counter that will always work and guess what it’s break the goddamn totems seriously you guys have been complaining about this perk over a year give it a rest
---
/r/Oinkers_
---
I want something like wraith from evolve.  Stupid sexy alien monster!
---
It happened with decisive strike too, Behavior adds a DLC with an overpowered perk and then nerfs it once they're done milking it for money. We're criticizing the business practice, not the nerfs
---
I main everyone besides plag just don’t like her
---
I think I’m gonna use test subject head and outfit with leather piggy weapon, I really like the drill.
---
r/oinkers
---
&gt;Huntress: I'd smash
---
Nice
---
Eh idc. Survivors have a ton of bs to get them through the match.
---
Thank god someone human
---
Man, this is the TRUTH.
---
Every damn time.
---
My hero!
---
3 seconds is barely enough time to get away and makes the perk kinda useless. 5 is a reasonable amount of time.
---
*nods and oinks*
---
Is this bug active on console? Nine of the survivors here on Xbox use it, and I certainly don't want them using it while I'm killer..
---
Don’t forget No one left behind,This is not happening and Premonition
---
*Oinks in fashion*
---
I'm all ears is "within 48 meters of your location" not outside the terror radius
---
Dude, same here.
---
RIGHT?!
---
Yep... Beware.
---
Puppers is great. Monto and noob3 are good friends with him.
---
No one plays with Pug lol
---
I do pretty well on that map as Huntress. Sure, it's hard to spot them initially, but once they get running, they're pretty easy to track through the corn and nail with a hatchet.
---
But they can disable the perk from the shrine when it was bugged smh
---
Wait the Legion bug still hasn't been fixed? Wth Bhvr
---
Wait you misunderstood the stun is active when you hit the ground then the 3 sec stun occurs making it so you have plenty of time to get to a pallet or vault also the perk wasn’t always gonna be a guarantee pallet or escape.
---
Piggy so cute heh I'm still new to her but im doing pretty good with her and I love her! So im happy shes getting cute skins :3
---
A new one got put in this last patch which reduces all action speeds of survivors by 15%, which negates the 15% wake up bug. Its been fixed for a long time now, they just messed it up again
---
I like the pwyf 🤷
---
I’m not the best killer but I play to have fun and yeah I love piggy too. I can’t wait to be in a match looking fabulous.
---
I had no problems chasing down a survivor when I got hit with old ds. 5 seconds actually gives them a reasonable amount of time to escape the chase.
---
Good thing you’re not a streamer
---
Oh lol. A literal perfect counter.
---
Huge fanboy over here
---
What does it matter for a killer though?
---
It’s a different one. Wake Up speeds everything up, Legion’s blade add ons slow everything down. Vaulting, healing, gens, etc.
---
It bothers me that the three in the middle are a different shade than the two outer ones.
---
DS has a counter that will always work. Don't tunnel. Or slug. The amount of times my DS has gone off it is almost useless the only time it's not is when I face a tunneler. m.o.m. is definitely useless though so I'll take the one over the other.
---
That’s fine but with a 60 sec activation timer it makes it so survivors can easily escape even when not being tunneled so if the timer stays at 60 then it needs a 3 sec stun so you can’t  end up with situations where survivors easily escape thanks to a perk.
---
He's $5, thats not that much lol
---
“Imagine having a competitive counterpart into the habit of being useless”-This post was made by the Beast of Prey/Fire Up/Territorial Imperative gang.
---
Yep, one of the most rage inducing feelings in this game is when you're walking along and the chase music starts up.
---
That's just what I pulled off the wiki. I'll check on a sec.
---
I feel bad for Feng, she is not pulling off those bangs.
---
Ds with a 60 second timer will go off even when you don’t tunnel that’s the problem we wanted it to be a anti tunnel perk but it’s really 60 sec immunity
---
If Killers had Pokemon moves, Legion would spam  STAB Beat Up without a doubt
---
I love this, this gave me a good laugh.
---
Truuuee! Speaking of that word. I've learned a lot from him. Hes helped me so much with killer
---
Not sure what that has to do with anything, but kudos for trying. Even if the attempt was poor.
---
He was a very nice Mr. Killer, true :) 
---
I suppose the moment he saw I turned back for him he knew my intention. I, for one, couldn't run away or get the others to teabag him like a bunch of idiots, it's immature and rude considering you pretty much ruined the game for him. I wouldn't mind it actually if he had continued playing the trial as intended. It's a game, he is the killer, he is supposed to kill us and that bug is just unfair.  But you get all kinds of flavors out there in the Fog.
---
Not so much a fanboy as I am someone who looks at things objectively.
---
60 seconds isn't that long my dude. And 8f you are worried about it... SLUG.
---
I think the perk is in a fine spot. The free escape doesn't happen all that often and I think it's in a nice medium for viable but not too strong.
---
Blasphemy
---
When I see him standing still and starting to stalk, I face my character and camera both pointed to him and stand still for 2 sec, that reveals him
---
I don’t see why the entity can’t just boost him into the air or some shit, give him a tiny ladder
---
In games that last 8-10 min that’s a lot of time
---
Yes
---
Every day from 2pm http://www.twitch.tv/greyback90
---
Not every good perk is a crutch. It doesn't even get used in a lot of games and can be played around. It's perfectly fine at 5.
---
While we are on this topic, am I the only person who plays ghostface and runs into people while shrouded and gets just as scared by finding them as they do by seeing me?  
---
Survivors terrify me sometimes that way.
---
i don't really see a down side to that, sure you vault slower but they got an 8 minute mend, sounds like a (balanced) trade off
---
are you fucking kidding me how do they reactivate a bug with extra things added
---
It’s captivating on a bad play I know it sucks to be tunneled just play smart and time your rescues also noed has a fucking easy counter break the totems I know this as a high rank killer when I used to run this perk not anymore on any killers it’s a bad perk I agree but has stupid easy counterplay.
---
Wraith got big peepee you just don’t look hard enough to find out
---
No I mean, the survivors vault slower.
---
The Abra family can float, but you're thinking of Alakazam I believe. Abra's usually seen sitting. They float like Nurse from psychic powers, whereas ghosts levitate and pass through objects because physics doesn't apply to them normally. The only good reason I can think of considering her a ghost-type is being susceptible to flashlights like Wraith, but I'm not sure if that's a strong enough reason to convince me.
---
DC Strike was “nerfed” like two years later, was broken, and got a nice change that majority of players are happy with (killers and survivors).
---
Thanks! My one concern is people playing the killer and camping like a kid guarding the base during hide and seek. Is there anything in place that prevents or discourages this?
---
I prefer pop goes the weasel, it can’t spawn terribly, get instantly drop kicked, then waste a perk slot all game
---
oh... oh dear lord thats unholy
---
So does DS. Either don't down them or down them and slug.
---
Exactly it’s not supposed to always be a free escape it’s a chance at a escape
---
Damn look at that glass shard though
---
You must be playing killer.
---
Not a clue, here's a video I did to show some friends, I said what each clip was in the description, it's so fucking bad:
---
https://youtu.be/u_ruQIfPDSg
---
Oooof
---
What if they have unbreakable and tenacity?
---
And dobble pallets are back! I've gotten 2 of them.
---
Damn tall grass. Plus if they have that perk that lets them crawl super fast, its game over.
---
And you can’t use them anymore
---
Which is what it is. It only lasts 60 seconds.
---
Yup check it out lmao:
---
Never underestimate the spaghetti code.
---
Wait...so where's the fanfics?
---
Curious about what people writes about it lol.
---
No with 60 seconds it’s a min immunity of not being touched or hooked again it’s a badly designed perk.
---
For me it was a let down. The whole power collecting "arc" was rushed as fuck and we just ended up with the protag losing his memories.
---
Then they are using 3 perk slots to gain one extra hit. Instead of being able to escape and get healed for one extra hit.
---
As survivor, time is precious. Think about how you’re using your time and ask yourself if it’s better used somewhere else (Generators, healing, chases, etc.).
---
Oh really? Then get as close as you want.
---
It happens and it's common. If you see it happening your best option is to just do gens, because the killer has to stand there for 2 minutes before the person on the hook dies.
---
Alternatively if you really want to save the person you could play Bill and use one of his perks called Borrowed Time, which would allow you to rescue them safely.
---
By the way, if you're picking a survivor to play first I highly recommend Meg as she has 3 decent to great perks and is easy to grasp as a new player.
---
I’ll also leave a link [here](https://youtu.be/yWnjvqRSlY0) that shows most of the Killer’s Hatch closing animations because I feel it’s important sharing it to you. Also I swear Nurse almost looks like it’s dabbing on the Hatch from Survivor view.
---
You know there's 3 other survivors right? And you can slug them.
---
Right on, ok recognize that survivors are just skins after you get them to level 40.
---
Each survivor has 3 unique perks that you unlock for everyone at levels 30, 35, and 40.
---
This goes for killers as well.
---
So you want to level people up to 40 before you move on to your next, rinse and repeat.
---
The unlocked perks do not appear immediately, but rather can now spawn in other characters bloodwebs. Bloodwebs are where you spend your bloodpoints to level up your characters.
---
I recommend Claudette first for Self care and Empathy, both are beginner friendly perks that will help you as you get adjusted.
---
Their are also neutral perks that can show up in anybody's bloodweb. You'll most likely want Spine Chill so you'll know when the killer is looking in your direction.
---
Besides that, just jump in, do generators, save other survivors, and try to have fun.
---
Please realize that until you level up many characters you are going to be limited to non meta builds and will leave a harder time. DO NOT WORRY about ranking up, you don't get anything special for ranking up.
---
Also make sure you do the tutorials for free bloodpoints.
---
Good luck an have fun, don't get agitated, and don't hide in corners or lockers too long! :)
---
At least that's a lot of time wasted then. Thanks, I'll definitely try her first!
---
Ok fine but admit that noed and ds are badly designed perks that reward stupid plays
---
Thanks for all the helpful information :D
---
Running in a straight line will get you killed, you gotta learn to loop. If you watch some of Noob3 on youtube, you'll see some good survivor gameplay from him, but the premise is you'll want to fine a pallet, then run around that area (like the walls/debris by the pallet) until the killer is close enough where they will swing, then drop the pallet.
---
Don't sprint everywhere. You leave scratch marks, a dead giveaway as to where you went. The killer can also see these from far away if you sprint near a wall in the open, so only sprint if you know the killer is chasing someone else, or you are confident they won't find you.
---
I would recommend starting with Claudette for survivor. The perk Self-Care is great for beginners, as you don't have to worry about trying to stay hidden while healed (though you should still learn how so this doesn't become a crutch perk)
---
Don't be too scared. It's a scary game, and with certain killers, it can be very terrifying, but don't let that get to you. If the killer is chasing someone else, or isn't near you, you should be healing someone who is hurt, cleansing totems, and doing gens. If you aren't doing gens when no one is hurt and the killer is nowhere, you're just giving them more time to find you. 
---
If you're going to save someone off the hook, make sure the killer isn't nearby. If they quickly come back, block the hit so the unhooked survivor doesn't go down again.
---
Don't drop pallets early. Pallets are the best weapon survivors have against killers. Do not waste them. Only drop a pallet if you're sure the killer will get hit by it, or if they are too close where you need to put some space between you.
---
Finally, don't get frustrated. You will die a lot. This game is difficult. 
---
Play both tutorials, and I would start with survivor because it's not as intense as killer. 
---
Any other advice, feel free to ask, go to the discord, or post in the "no stupid questions" threads that come up every week (I think on Tuesdays but I could be wrong)
---
Good Luck
---
That’s just what we call a garbage killer
---
Freak on a Leash sounds like the name of a killer perk. Not sure what it would do though.
---
Yeah that's pretty much the consensus on here. But I don't think either needs changed tbh. As killer I never use noed cause I don't dlrt the game get that far. As survivor it's only come in handy a handfull of times but I solo queue. I can't trust my teammates won't farm me so I run it. The best killers I've come against make it useless
---
wake up and double blade are both bugged crazy how Infinite mending is a thing again
---
Yeah screw that indie company for not patching something day 1, any large nonindie company would have fixed it by now! /s
---
No but really, they have a limited staff they will fix it as soon as they can ship it. They are aware. Least it's not Myers with a chainsaw.
---
You’re right. They were SO bad. It’s so much more fun when you play against bad killers lol
---
D: trapper also
---
lmao
---
I've played someone with this name before!
---
As far as I know, only u/OnlySaysOink and I have the name x3
---
Double Blades are bugged again?
---
Good story
---
Thanks! :D
---
Yeah, I was forced to do that with the plague, I thought I'd get enough two hits for the gold
---
I’d rather play as Tiffany, anyway
---
It's what you have to do for Freddy lol
---
Tatum was so fucking attractive
---
I was running Enduring, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, and Rancor. 
---
Usually I use Spirit Fury over Rancor but I was going for an achievement to sacrifice 30 obsessions. 
---
Her phasewalk is amazing, I love snatching people off of gens!
---
YES GAWD 😍🤤
---
I laughed too hard at this..
---
Indie compnay? Hey buddy I think your watch broke it's not 2016 anymore.
---
Oh I see.
---
Yeah I couldn't tell if smaller bloodwebs had more, it just felt like a 25% chance as survivor to get an event anything.
---
Give it time, with new killers, a lot of players don't know what to do against them so they die often, and start screaming "OP! NERF!"
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c29p7g/ghostface_promo_image_upscaled/
---
yep lol
---
I'd like to think that too.
---
But then I remember we're talking about Bhvr
---
Ok thinks I’ll try that tomorrow when I play. Thanks.
---
Then its gonna be after nerf before nerf
---
Lmao as a killer I want them to unhook just so I can kill them faster
---
Yeah. You can mostly just find them in chests. I don’t think they appear much in bloodwebs; at least not good ones.
---
Patch Notes 
---
\------------------  
---
\-Fixed Ghost Face bug where the killer could stalk people and insta-down them, now he requires to make a 5 minute phone call with the targeted survivor first. If he is spotted at any time he must repeat the stalking process after 5 minute cool down for stalk ability.
---
\-Decreased Ghost Face movement speed to 90% of survivor base movement speed
---
\-Added new survivor ability "Gun" where survivors can shoot the killer and end the game
---
\-Fixed a bug where killers could attack survivors
---
All 3 if Claudette's perks are at least good and empathy is great for a beginner. Not only does it show you where people to heal are but you also get to see where the person the killer is chasing is. If they are running your way, hide or get out of there.
---
I would play as her but put half your bloodpoints in Meg or Feng until you get the sharable version of sprint burst or lithe, respectively. You will know it is sharable because it will be orange on the bloodweb. It will now have a good chance to appear on Claudette's bloodweb. 
---
Until you can get one of these perks on your Claudette, expect to get caught most of the times you get chased. Lucky for you, she is the hardest character to see by far, so hiding is a good option.
---
GhostFace looking at the nerf
---
Had to max them BP.
---
Besides the fact that you're stuck in a locker, aee you serious about playing without a mouse? You most likely will not enjoy yourself...
---
Yes. Don’t play the game correctly. Fuck around. Make the Killer’s day the worst fucking day they’ve ever had.
---
I have seen a Myers with a chainsaw before
---
That excuse gets worse everytime I hear it. Regardless of studio size, game breaking bugs need to be fixed. Stop being a sheep.
---
What's wrong with Wake Up?
---
I have to look for my mouse in a closet stuffed somewhere. But I just need this little bit of help at the moment so I can try again tomorrow.
---
Save up.
---
Haven't seen this tier list before.
---
yes my bad for late response The Hooks would be killer specific as Wraith could be a Car Crusher, Trapper a Makeshift Trap that slowly stabs you with different blades for different tiers and doctor would be an electric chair set with timers
---
Well go to a cliff...
---
If anything it’d probably be Benedict not Vigo
---
I swore I would never buy another killer day 1 after the Freddy fiasco. I honestly felt like I paid for a product that I didn't wind up getting. On PS4 he got nerfed a  few days after release and I wasn't watching their stream to know it was coming.
---
I took a chance on Ghostface though. They have been better lately about not doing this. If he gets a hard nerf I'm probably done buying DLC. The game is fine as is.
---
Now you have. Congratulations.
---
I was on swamp and the meg just disappeared into the fucking void I swear.
---
Throw in spine chill for +30%
---
Nope. Slow action speed
---
perhaps you kicked puppies in a past life, real talk though either you're playing one of the CURSED SURVIVORS "laurie, claudette" im sure you're just having a string of bad luck. you'll get good i believe
---
There’s tutorials under settings for survivors, and it goes over the skill-check/struggle mechanics. 
---
Just keep practicing and you’ll get the hang of it. I started off at survivor and it took me a solid 2 weeks to get the hang of it. It’ll take you even less time since you’re already familiar with the game. 
---
You say you’ve played killer before, so you should know where the loops are. Once you figure out the mechanics, use your experience with killer to figure out how to mindgame, loop, etc.
---
Yikes I did not know it was supposed to be grindy to be purely honest.
---
also use Bbq from LeatherFace(Teachable Perk) that increassee you bloodpoint gain by 100% and use the perk Middle perk on david king ( Teachable perk forgot its name) to increase your bloodpoint gain
---
It’s not a nerf. They’re adjusted some small numbers on his add-ons and slightly widening the detection range for survivors. I don’t think it’s going to affect much.
---
You shouldn't need to run two add-ons to bring your numbers up to something respectable.
---
They should be "pretty alright" by default, and you should be able to run add-ons to make it "damn awesome".
---
What I see when I flick up from a flashlight
---
 WOW kid you just got r/WOOOOOOSHED!!!! 😂😂👀   
---
"Wooosh" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke "woooshes" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! 😤😤😂   
---
My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭   
---
In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as "R/Wooooosh" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as "Schadenfreude," which means "harm-joy" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂
---
I don't have leatherface, but I can try using the perk from david, We are gonna live forever I think it's called.
---
What do you mean summer starts tomorrow? You mean dedicated servers?
---
yeah its not bad if you do KYF or play casually but if you play often and trying to get better you'll have to grind abit to get some of the better addons and perks for your character
---
I think they may yet be saving it for the battle pass, as a incentive to get it (Cus lord do we all want it lmao)
---
Whether that's a good thing or not is up to you, but I think I'll play enough to justify buying it when it comes out
---
We're Gonna Live Forever is the David perk
---
If you miss an attack and lose your power, you've already lost the element of surprise.
---
Being able to go into shroud faster won't make survivors forget you're there once they know.
---
yeah that one is great if you are a saving kind of person as taking hits for people or saving people gets you a stack up to 4 (25% per stack 100% max) more bloodpoints
---
thats how everyone works, you start with a mildly usable power and modify it
---
Lmfaoooooo rofl
---
The play with your food glitch is kinda cool ngl
---
How??!!
---
&gt; Hillbilly: looks like your mother 
---
I burst out laughing. Hahahah
---
Unrelenting used to be great but it’s gone through so many nerfs/reworks, that it’s outclassed by other perks. As it stands, Unrelenting only rewards missed attacks.
---
Originally it gave buffs for hits AND misses, and I can’t remember if STBFL existed before but it’s basically the old Unrelenting with stacks. No reason to run Unrelating if STBFL is available.
---
I didn't even know the tutorial section existed.  
---
I'll have to keep practicing, my problem mostly is trying to interact with my team and the killer without many aura perks.
---
Clara!!!!!! 🥰🥰 
---
Best companion ever, no doubt.
---
You realise it takes time ti fix this stuff, right? Odds are this will be fixed in the upcoming hotfix.
---
Unrelenting is only when you miss and you'd rather not miss lol it's good for recovering if you miss a bit but, if you don't miss often, STBFL applies on hits which means you can down enemies much faster than you would otherwise
---
Summer 2019 in Northern Hemisphere will begin on
---
Friday, June 21
---
If they are your friends they will be totally ok with you not being super helpful. Play to have fun and try to do your best (even if it's not much of a help to your team).
---
Your two favorite perks were the ones that were extremely broken? Ok then...
---
This is precisely what he needs. I assumed most were referring to this?
---
Oh, ok.
---
It's not so much me being helpful, it's more so me enjoying the game and displaying competency. It seems like no matter what people do, either the killer is awful or the survivors have no idea what they're doing.
---
"Oh don't worry about that"
---
Really? People have to private their profiles to avoid getting flamed. That seems super screwed up to me.
---
No, I have a game with a Clown in it that looks like uncle Robert...
---
Aren't we all?
---
Hah, easily my favorite survivor map. I love a good chase through the corn.
---
Amanda best girl.
---
This is a demonstration of what a fact is.
---
Is this what you mean? https://imgur.com/a/WX2gMT3
---
He is. Unless you compare im to a finger eating clown...
---
Same, I was going crazy trying to find the mythical fourth survivor/stack. 
---
*Where are you Claudette?!*
---
Equating a character who is slightly difficult to spot, but can still be looped to high-heaven, with a character who literally ignored everything Survivors could do...
---
K.
---
sure its overrated but is this really the place to bitch about it? like its really not that bad but im not you and everyone has their own opinions
---
My dad has two nipples tho :(
---
Stringing Vipers *who*?
---
You go faster through bloodwebs if you don't aim for the ultra rare stuff.
---
IT'S NOT A PHASE MOM!!!
---
You deserve it if you play nea.
---
Nurse has no cooldown either
---
There should be a feature where you can "trim" the corn to where it's about half it's hight by swinging through it it wouldn't be to OP as it take a long time to cut that much corn but could make it a little more interesting
---
I mean, you can safe pip/depip on a 4k now, so it's pretty logical to see a 4k as the win condition.
---
I dumped my boyfriend and went straight for her/s
---
Red dude is angry pug?
---
Who is this ████ guy Amanda? I'd like to have words with them.
---
I just love the outfit I have for her :(
---
Another fact.
---
Lmao
---
she's hideous and so are her outfits
---
I am not gonna continue this so llts just start and Oink train.
---
OINK
---
True but 3 of the 4 newest killers are like this, spirit, legion and now ghostface. Only one who isnt is plague so maybe the trend stops but who knows
---
No.
---
Maybe play killer for a while to rack up blood points and then spend them on some survivors to get the teachables (the grind is real). 
---
As a new survivor, I recommend self care (ability to heal self without use of item), bond (see teammates within certain range), alert (receive aura notifications when killer breaks pallets or gens), and any exhaust perk (sprint burst, lithe, or balanced landing are good - lithe would help you practice your looping since it activates when you fast vault windows). 
---
For self care, level up claudette. For bond, level up dwight. For alert and lithe, level up feng.
---
This cosmetic alone would make me play Plague haha seriously good work!
---
The giant prompt on your screen
---
Saw 3 is the damned forbidden movie.
---
dc if someone plays like a moron
---
Not for much longer...\*agressive Oink\*
---
But of course yall running Wake Up shouldn't get banned, because it's okay for survivors to abuse bugs but when a killer does it's suddenly bad
---
If that were the case, it'd be fine.
---
Here, you have a killer who is add-on reliant to have his power CD not be stupidly long.
---
A killer being add-on reliant isn't a good thing.
---
My hero &lt;3
---
Love! 🖤
---
im just gunna slide this in here but keep it on the down low. if you die with an item from a chest you keep it. or maybe it just me thats bugged but hope someone can confirm.
---
Yet whenever I play as a survivor I never get rid of the killer during a chase
---
Please don't give me ptsd from that December of 2017
---
It only works now if you camp. Dont camp. Slug them instead and get the unhooker. This is really simple stuff.
---
I swear, just PLEASE remove S.A.M.J from my memeory
---
Thank you! I still haven't bought her dlc because I'm broke but her and the huntress are my favorites. Wish I could land skillshots though 😱
---
Spirit has a 15 second CD on her power, and it's shorter if you use it less. Considering how strong it is, this is reasonable.
---
Legion is a failure and everyone knows it.
---
Plague doesn't have this particular issue, but she has her own pile of issues.
---
Fortnite is fine, its supported and gets fixed up way faster than DbD. Im guessing youre just shitting on it since its popular or you couldnt adjust to the skill curve.
---
Also I love DbD but it is not a good game
---
Fixed? Lol its back already.
---
Well its not infinite but his blade add ons now slow down all survivors actions, mending, healing, vaulting and repairing. You need a toolbox and the wake up perk just to get the repair bar to turn grey from red to counter the penalty you get to repairing
---
Thank you very much
---
We should only remember Amanda
---
And John, Billy and the plot twist.
---
Success!
---
Yeah just Amanda and all of that.
---
I had a clicking Nea who got into my trap 3 seconds later. I rofl'ed
---
deal.
---
Hail Amanda
---
looks sort of Lord of the rings like, neat  
---
(the movies of course)
---
If it gets released at all, in some form or fashion, I will be happy to buy it.
---
This is cool
---
There can only be one
---
STOP! We are not perfect, but we are not FUCKING Furries.
---
where did you get this? i dont know if my player cloud ID is a safe thing to give away
---
“Okay, cut it Casper! That’s a wrap!”
---
Its the big shoulder cape thing. Changes her silhouette too much if your going to give her the helmet with wings too. Also she looks short here.
---
Nea is the real killer confirmed
---
omg i want plz
---
Well that was creepy
---
Until then, ballerina Feng will have to do.
---
That's a pretty damn good compromise in my books though.
---
^^im ^^still^^waiting
---
I've been playing primarily survivor since he came out because Killer queues are too long and he really isnt that bad. Ive been spottibg him fine. People get confused cause the detection music doesn't start to play as soon as you look at him to not give his position away accedently when you're looking around. Your character has to be looking st him. Watch any high rank game and you'll see what I mean. You're complaining withought understanding the basic mechanics of his kit.
---
this is so EPIC
---
Love it ! Would buy for sure!!
---
Personally I feel like Pinhead deserves some love, fits in with the Lovecraftian/Entity lore and could add in a scorpion/roadhog hook mechanic. 
---
Would it be broken? 
---
Depends but any new power would be welcome.
---
Knew about wake uo and legion, but PWUF is broken too? Fuck sake lol
---
Nea looks like she’s become a kung fu grandmaster.
---
I upvoted for Pig.
---
Wake up definitely works in kyf matches. Thats where I tested it out and I had +15 on everything
---
from someone who isn’t exceptional at the game and appreciates modesty... you did good bud
---
Also happens for wglf
---
It's still potentially good if you take a lot of protection hits, but there are better perks to run.
---
Bottom line is that dont buy a DLC just for perks unless it's LF.
---
sometimes I wonder what's going on inside the devs' brains... I know balance is hard to achieve, but cmn this is such an easy fix!!
---
Sir this is the DBD subreddit.
---
Thx, I really don't understand how they fucked up like that, they didn't even added survivor perks but hey, they changed WU somehow
---
I personally only bought the cloak for ghostface to make it feel more like him.
---
Why didn’t you just do a quick google search? Yes, you can team up with friends.
---
Yesterday, looped a Billy for 5 minutes in one Jungle gym without hrowing down the pallet and 0 gens done ,there was no ruin.
---
I'm guessing tunneled is like tunnel vision and I got that in my second game. I've started trying to fake out killers by sprinting one way to leave scratch marks and then walking perpendicular to that
---
People do target certain survivors/cosmetics a lot more though. I've noticed for one if you're playing Jane you will get tunneled 90% of the time (probably because of her booty). Pink hair Nea could be one of these cosmetics.
---
Thanks!
---
I mean, I guess if the survivors had 3-genned themselves already, it might serve a purpose? But it only blocks for 16 seconds, and it has a 60-second cooldown, so it's outclassed in location perks imo.
---
In my first 10 levels for Ghostface I got T3 BBQ&amp;Chilli, so that's nice
---
Be prepared for frustrating matches of survivors not knowing what they're doing or actually working with the killer. Killers camping and or lag switching. And finally toxic messages from both usually. So my suggestion is try to find decent players to be friends with so you can play survive with friends
---
No, it's not worth it. It only procs on protection hits now, so unless you like to run straight at hooks while people are being carried to them, you're not likely to get enough stacks.
---
Nah, unless they change it up it's borderline useless.
---
69 GGs? 
---
*Nice*
---
The first match I escaped on had a guy that dc'd lol
---
I already figured it out, they chose the black ward a lot, I have way less of those because I chose the ebonies, I don’t know what your response is about I just meant I have equally have the cakes and ebonies but I figured it out when I saw the OP had a stack full of the wards when I only have a handful ( those rarely pop up for me anyway and if they do they show up with the ebonies and I have to choose between them)
---
He’s a fun killer but definitely not viable past green.
---
This would make me play plague! Pretty good job so far
---
Not one of. It is THE most satisfying feeling in DBD.
---
I played R6S so toxic messages is nothing new to me lmao
---
You've done well my apprentice.
---
I swear i played the full 12 hours yesterday and went to bed exactly like this
---
Fortnite is hot garbage an if it wasn't free it wouldn't be half as popular.
---
Also, you should keep things related to DbD on the DbD Reddit and take this conversation to the fortnite Reddit.
---
!!!🤡
---
i'm not guilty. when a killer does a good job, doesn't bm or tunnel and can't get kills due to fact the game on high ranks doesn't support fair play i die to those killers. that's my "thank you" for a good game. and if others bmed that killer, i flame them in post chat.
---
also the reason why as killer i literally love when desperate Japanese high rank swf is in my lobby with 250-300 ping(my internet is very stable, they don't get weird lags so even with that ping they are able to play normal). when they play, they play skilled and fair. they don't bm me, they don't farm their mates(cause when you unhook behind killer's back even with BT when it's completely unnecessary i also consider this a disrespect), they just play the damn game. even if i didn't get kills with them i still had a great time, wish EU players were more like Japanese. god i love those guys. it's so nice when they let you leave the hook area before unhooking. really. i want to play fair. i want good chase and mindgames. i don't want to play like an asshole.
---
Or maybe nurse could be part psychic because of her pick up animation where she just floats you up and her hook animation the survivor just floats there for a second. And legion...ya fighting is fine but if that’s the case then huntress should be fighting as well considering she, well, hunts animals and now people. Maybe make Fred boy ghost and fire maybe? Just a thought.
---
I agree with that, these are small corrections.
---
But, that he can no longer extend the "exposed effect" while chasing is killing me.
---
Like, why Plague's "broken effect" is infinite and Ghostface's lasts 45 sec, provided the ghostface is harder to use his ability imo?
---
Sry if it was me but I had to get off my pc
---
Another thing to remember, anytime you see GF stalking someone breaking him out of stalk (staring at him) will give your general position away. 
---
So sometimes it’s better to ignore him.
---
I’ve initiated so many chases this way. I’ll stalk in the open and wait for the indicators to lead me to a survivor.
---
Same, I consistently expose him but also get exposed by him too. He‘s a ton of fun to play against. They just need to make exposing him while he’s stalking you less awkward.
---
so thats why im seeing wake up on survivors these days
---
I don't think he needs a nerf. He's balanced.
---
🤦
---
Gotta tunnel the Janes so i can get a good look at that THICCNESS
---
Maybe there will be variants of some sort, it's been a while since we had any new skins with alt versions
---
I also stated that understand why they needed nerfed infact my suggestion involves making mom balanced and useable right now its too hard to get tokens consitently by adding in unhooks it still takes enough work that it wont proc every game furthermore i actually think DS is fair where its at i personally dont run it since unless i get tunnled its a dead perk slot
---
No, everyone hates the corn
---
COWSIAM
---
Why are wraith and pig better?
---
I understand that but I'd rather them let them leave ghostface as is for a few weeks and then adjust if need be.
---
The jacket itself is called "Toxic GG" or something like that. Has GG on the front of it as you can see in its icon.
---
mettle of man could actually be good if protection hits worked properly
---
that sucks
---
He’s perfectly fine as he is. Stop crying for buffs and git gud survivor mains. OMG U GUYZ WANT ALL KILLERS TO BE WEAK!!! KILLERS ARE ONLY BALANCED WHEN THEY CAN INSTADOWN EVERY SURVIVOR BHVR STOP LISTENING TO SURVIV9RZ UR GONNA KILL THIS GAM3!!!!!!!
---
I'm not nearly enough to be a competent survivor (I think), but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the game. I died first? Well, that sucks, but wait! I was the one to get Ruin totem. Yay for me! I got downed 20 seconds into the chase? Man, I suck! But wait, I got 2 safe unhooks before, I was somewhat helpful! And that's me playing solo. If I were playing with friends I'd enjoy my screw-ups even more, because we'd have a laugh because of me.
---
And comments on profiles? You can disable them, you can delete them and you can "I don't care about what some randoms on interwebs think about me playing video games" them.
---
No I meant Ghostface is better
---
I started a thread earlier about how the devs where discussing unhooks also give tokens which i really think they should have done i understood the nerf but the way thay did it makes it unusable now and thats not how balancing is supposed to work
---
I understand. Not really the point of my post though. I understand bugs happen and no one can make a perfect build every time. Im just saying theres tons of posts like wtf wake up is being allowed because survivors can abuse it while killers got banned. Just trying to point out their track record and usual solution/fix time. I'd expect them to announce its bannable soon and then fix it a bit after that. 
---
What they break during that fix we will have to wait for lol
---
Nothing says fun like not being able to see shit.
---
Actually, can you even imagine how fun it would be if you can combine killer powers in KYF??
---
They ruined it by nerfing it too hard
---
I thought MoM was an awful unfair perk and needed to be nerfed hard. However even I think its gone a bit too far.
---
I mean 3 protections hits alone, fair enough. But I dont feel it needs the permanent aura reveal downside anymore. Its not op to the point that it needs that now.
---
MoM will now just a perk you take with WGLF when you want to farm some BP.
---
Just played a match against Billy and I couldn't hear his chainsaw at all. Then had a bing bong match where I didn't hear a single bing or bong for the entire thing.
---
The super quiet heartbeat and chase music were bad enough but I could get used to those. I can't play if I can't get those other audio cues at all.
---
Dude Richard from Hotline Miami would be sick. 
---
Or also priest killer or something christian related would be cool.
---
Holy moly, this is a bug thats already being fixed in the hotfix. Relax, Ghost face is perfectly fine but just has a bug that made it through
---
Leave for ANOTHER 30 minutes?! No, thank you!
---
If the booty Thicc, you gotta take that pic
---
There's also Scott. I think he put #1 Huntress in his stream titles too. At least sometimes.
---
I run ruin ,thanatophobia, thrilling tremors and switch out the 4th but I'm using bbq and chili mostly. If I see items I can run Franklin's or lightborn if it's just lights. It's been working pretty well. With bbq and tremors you basically will get to see where people are through gens. If they counter bbq their gen gets locked up. If they choose to stay on the gen it wont light up white. It's a okay perk.
---
Does dropping the survivor still cancel out DS?
---
Everything's working as intended!
---
Mettle of Man isn’t going to proc unless you run Empathy and chase the killer, so no.
---
wrong reddit personally i only play with friends and do challenges especially when killer queue is full like both are good games just one devs fix shit semi faster than the other
---
"Oh shit me harrasing a killer got me tunneled and dead because I thought I was better than them and turns out I'm not. Fucking shit killers kys". Mostly jk.
---
It's fine because it encourages me to get even better at nurse so next time I see them they're in for a fun surprise.
---
He was crouched in the grass. He can’t stalk you in the grass and you can’t reveal him.
---
But in case you haven’t noticed, there are a lot of people going apeshit about this hotfix, calling it a nerf and saying the bugs shouldnt be fixed as he is perfectly fine as he is.
---
That only really
---
Happens to be because shitty rank20 teammates can’t help me
---
shit bhvr i’ll give you this one
---
Oh yeah I agree completely. People need to learn how to play against him before complaining about losing because it feels bad.
---
In my opinion MoM in its current state is worse than Deja Vu. It is by far the worst survivor perk. At least DeJa Vu does not force you to run around the map like an idiot trying to get stacks by giving the killer 3 free hits. It promotes inefficient gameplay.
---
havent seen anyone besides very few people that get downvoted instantly say this. pretty much everyone ive seen is fine with the fix and ive been active in every relevant thread
---
Which made up one???
---
thats why i murder them before they get to the gate not my fault they play luke idiots running around a tree
---
When the jake dced and Bubba moved his hand I lost it lmao
---
Huntress should be Normal/Flying type with them hatchet yeets.
---
I'm with you. I've said from the start that MoM was OP, but now it's utter trash. As you said, the requirements are ridiculous, and the reward isn't worth the risk.
---
I really hope they make it so safe unhooks count. Would make the perk much better while not being as simple as it originally was.
---
Pretty much same. I usually keep up a certain strat so they eventually get what I'm doing and if they see it in the future they can combat it more (like running back at the nurse). I wish there were more emotes because when a surv points at me or waves I have absolutely no idea what they want usually.
---
Only real use I've seen for it was in one video where a guy used it on Freddy with the Red Paint Brush to basically get wallhacks during chases. It was pretty nifty
---
Why do you play games you think are bad?
---
People keep saying this but he's seems really easy to reveal as is.
---
Your contribution to the conversation is greatly appreciated.
---
I guarentee you it's just the survivor dumbfounded that starting him straight in the eyes for 5 seconds didn't do shit. The reveal is so buggy it's honestly annoying as fuck playing against him right now.
---
Why was he trying to report you?
---
So you like Pig then
---
You see, really all the killers are doing is acting in self defense.
---
Must be a bug. Same shit happened to me while being grabbed ds didn't work.
---
Hey don’t put Hope in with those perks, y’all sleeping on Hope
---
A game can be fun but bad. This game literally gets a game breaking bug every single update, has some of the worst matchmaking around, can barely balance new perks, takes weeks to get simple fixes out, no punishments for DC, and has a dev team that will make anything players find slightly bad or good OP or garbage at the drop of a hat. It is not a good game, but that doesnt make it not fun.
---
i recommend watching some survivor main youtubers like noob3 he makes some great builds and watch how he plays and how to loop and play mindgames
---
way better
---
My trash internet
---
well that's the thing, you don't play much. 
---
when i bought the game and i did it because someone told me there's Freddy Krueger in it, i naturally started as killer main and i obviously mained Freddy(still do but...). they told me he's terrible as killer cause these people were high rank players. and i was proving them wrong by getting easy 4k up until green ranks(before the Clown chapter when we still had double pallets and vacuum and old bnp that would finish a gen within few seconds). so right after i first time reached upper green ranks i realized how right they were. Freddy and killer overall is so much harder than survivor. you don't feel it on low ranks but the higher you get, the harder it gets. 
---
i'm still a killer main. but i don't play Freddy as much anymore after the engine change - brightness hurts my eyes and triggers migraine on certain maps. it used to be very dark in Dream World and it was a bliss for my chronical migraine ass. now i mostly play Spirit cause as a red rank killer you can't really afford playing Trapper or pretty much anyone but Huntress, Spirit, Billy or Nurse *consistently* just because low mobility gets to you on big maps. 
---
as survivor i hate playing on low ranks(literally anything below upper purple ranks). no one does gens, no one knows what they're doing. it gets really hard with low rank killers cause all they do is tunnel and camp. but on red ranks it is really fun. if you manage to kite the killer who found you first for over 30 seconds - even with ruin a gen pops. then you are getting saved before struggle stage and just go on with objectives. playing on red ranks gets boring because most killers are Billy and Nurse with same build but at least you're getting killed by killers and not your moron teammates. you get challenge instead of carrying your imbecile/newbie teammates. 
---
so, no, i play killer when i'm in a good state. when i know i can handle bm and failure because there's no one to blame there but me. 
---
playing survivor i literally just chill. unless it's Spirit, i turn on the music and relax holding m1 or doing the loops/mindgames. 
---
PC, EU region, red rank killer and survivor, nearly 3k hours on record, almost Devotion 12. 
---
so, please, don't think survivor is hard. it really isn't. it's much easier and less stressful. practice looping, learn maps, do great skill checks, change your struggle to mouse wheel down. survivors really don't need perks or items too.
---
(don't get me wrong. playing instasaw Billy is ez win unless you're complete trash but that's about it. all other killers require actual practice to master to face decent sirvivors. you can't win with Omega blink Nurse unless you're good at blinking on the first place and one shot hatchets/Clown jizz juice still require you to aim so there is that. i've met multiple red rank killers with strongest perks and add-ons and even pink Mori to only see them failing against me and two others cause in reality on red ranks you need only 3 good players to win the game. not even perks or items)
---
I love confusing people with ghostface caught on tape because it's a ridiculously fast stalk
---
Awesome :)
---
When you run Object of Obsession, it is smart to not break him out of stealth. While he'll see your aura, you can see him and seeing as he has no red stain, it is a way to keep track of him. Any mind games will not be possible for him.
---
Oink!
---
Favorites are "tha doktar" cause people hate him, spirit cause she has great mobility and is also pretty viable at high ranks and clown because I love how he looks, I too can't stand ghostface
---
You're right. I misread. I apologize.
---
Just stop giving the devs the money they need to do the work 4head
---
Sorry bro already sent in reviews on my Rank 20 accounts :(
---
How did Moria get nerfed?
---
I dunno, to me her floating always looked more "ghostly" if that even makes sense. There's also the fact that she looks as if she hung herself or was hung as a means of execution. There doesn't seem to be anything in her backstory to imply that, but it just looks a lot like it to me, from the way her neck/head is and the dangling of her feet.
---
I love Nurse. She SLAM DUNKS the hatch.
---
*laughs in franklin's demise*
---
You can. There's a tab for killer controls.
---
I'd run BBQ, Ruin, Spirit Fury and Enduring. Gf is weak against pallets so that helps him out a bit
---
Doesn't everyone.
---
It's so true it hurts 😭 😔 the amount of bm I get for playing clean as killer from survivors is awful.
---
You have to be sprinting for it to work. If you just got unhooked you need at least about 3-4 steps so it can be activated.
---
Ghost Face: "It's just sometimes... \*sniff\* I think I'm a trash tier killer... \*sniff"
---
Dwight: "You're S tier in my book chief"
---
“viable”
---
impossible skill check doc is supposed to make people dc not necessarily to be “viable”
---
Poor Kate :(
---
Didn’t hear they removed safe unhooks. Agreed, literally no reason to ever use now. If they can’t fix it they “break” it by making it so undesirable they people will just give up on it for a while.
---
Its fucking tru3 and his bs. Dudes always complaining and other people mimic him.
---
Dedicated summers
---
Nani?...
---
tbh i bought hag for ruin, but yeah that disapoints me they nerfed it that hard
---
Trappers yellow bag add on is broken. You can use the 2nd trap but won't let you use first.
---
Lettuce skin hag is the alolan form, and is grass type
---
He cant stalk in the grass? did we watch the same vid?
---
Survivors spin their screens and magically avoid hits. It's pretty even to me.
---
why is he wearing it OVER his glove
---
This is awesome! Not a killer main but I’d love to see this plague hurl her guts at me!
---
This needs more upvotes
---
Swiggity swooty, ghost face loves the booty.
---
Yeah I felt pretty bad for her despite me being on the opposite side
---
Good Stuff on the Hundred Stack of Cake My dude!!!
---
I feel like we're all just complaining about it for complainings sake, not for the actual skin...... Or is that just me
---
I love these posts that just cry for acceptance and for people to tell you you’re right. 
---
Welp you’re right. I don’t even know why people post these kind of posts. It’s a game. Play however you want. Humble brag about not getting any hooks and winning but I’ll let it slide. And if you’re going to entertain the people who bitch about your play style by making a post because it bothered you enough to type this out then you’re just letting them win.
---
If the survivors in the grass.
---
distressing is fairly good in spirit
---
your rank 15 chill out.
---
Why would anyone willingly bully a piggy?
---
I genuinely want a proper discussion on the topic. No need to be cynical.
---
Except Hope is incredibly good.  It won't let you outrun a Killer of course, but it makes a significant difference.
---
OMFG I NEED IT !!
---
👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
---
Black Ward is awesome though. Let's you use your best stuff without fear of losing them. I'd choose a Black Ward over an Ebony Mori any day of the week.
---
No, the skillcheck already appears in the pick-up animation. You can‘t drop.
---
Personally i dont think is toxic, but rather boring to play against. And i dont mean your situation in particular.  Just the common/slugging.  Laying on the ground for a couple of min without be able to play the game is just... not  fun. But i understand what you say and often feel the same. 
---
Btw here in latin america sv ve the lenguage barrier and the xenophobic thing too.  Lol
---
And I thought that was me! Couldn't here shit and sounded like the male Legion.
---
Im reinstalling my game right now cause I thought it was messed up. I also get these "Players\_Pip\_Error" after a Survivor game.
---
Most likely.
---
He is getting his rework in the mid-chapter patch most likely which I am really excited for and I do think he needs it, but the Cannibal needs more love in my opinion.
---
Play nice-&gt;they BM
---
Play to win-&gt;they BM
---
play like a cunt-&gt;they BM
---
Get 4 kills with RBT-&gt;They appriciate life.
---
:(
---
Hahaha it's hilarious!
---
It’s. Not. A. Nerf.
---
Vommy Mommy 🙌
---
It's pretty balanced right now. Easy to counter, effective at doing what it does.
---
This is coming from a freddy main.
---
Umbra is more chill to watch tbh 
---
The way I see it each gender gets a #1 spot
---
A lot of survivor stuff seems bugged this patch. DS not working sometimes, same with self care, dead hard (more than usual) and head on. 
---
I also had a game where I used up a med-kit and healed 0%.
---
It’s genuinely a topic that is frequently posted. With almost this exact same back story. 
---
“I camped because this and survivors said that is it okay that I camped?” 
---
Or. 
---
“I slug survivors and they don’t like it” 
---
Like you could literally GIVE them the hatch and they’ll complain because you killed their friend. 
---
Appeasing a person you never met before and never will is odd. Just play the game. Obviously slugging isn’t fun for survivors. Do you have fun in a slug fest? Probably not. But hey it’ll still keep happening and you’ll still keep doing it even if you hate it so I don’t see where a discussion fits in here that hasn’t been beaten like the dead horse at penn asylum already.
---
Just make the perk grind easier, but not the grind for add ons
---
Actually, it doesn't work like that for every streamer. Some streamers don't mind being told what to do whereas others ban people for it. There should be a warning if the streamer dislikes it(that's what moderators are for) but I guess I'm just telling a streamer what to do.
---
Yeah the consensus seems to be that it's boring to go up against, but I've never really seen it as toxic. Certainly not "kill yourself" hatemail worthy. I know someone that hates being slugged and disconnects when they're the second to last survivor if they're slugged.
---
It kinda makes me wonder just how effective slugging only is at red ranks. Might try it soon.
---
Just report them at the match result screen. Although, it doesn't do shit so just move on.
---
Stun noises :)
---
That's fucking annoying
---
omg yes
---
The difference here is: most people are joking but Scott always seems so dead serious about it lol
---
The silent bing-bonging \*may\* have been the use of a coxcombed clapper.
---
it's my cousin
---
You don’t have to walk back from the pallet for that. Just aim straight down
---
hehe
---
Bruh, bring chewed pen. Works how you want it to, trust me
---
Good luck in purple that’s when ghostface starts to struggle hard. Also good job at p3ing!
---
Let me know if reinstalling fixes the player pip error. I get that too on both survivor and killer after every game and I can’t rank up because of it
---
True, trash perks for a trash build
---
hehe thats called the end game collapse, once a door is open or hatch is closed survivors have until the timer runs out to escape or be killed by the entity, dont know the answer for your second question sorry
---
Suggesting I have a god complex is pretty cynical. The slugging being boring part I have no issue with. It's an opinion and a pretty standard one at that.
---
the killer was the better player tbh
---
ah cool, i thought it was when NOED activates.
---
do we know what the reward is yet? my best bet is free ghostface dlc
---
You really shouldn't need an add on to have your power on a reasonable CD.
---
My experience has been pressing triangle to search for a game as killer only to wait for like 8 minutes to search for a game and 4 minutes for survs to join
---
\*laughs in pig\*
---
I find the cloak from his outfit paired with the normal mask to be top tier, closest we can get to the movie
---
I feel like it was designed as another 'anti tunnel' perk along with the new D-Strike. You get hit twice, first hook. knocked straight down after being saved then hooked again, third hit. Killer tries to knock you down after being unhooked again then you would have a chance to escape with the MoM effect. Obviously it didn't work as intended. Its pretty much useless now which is sad.
---
I didnt know anyone actually uses wake up. What's wrong with it and what's wrong with school bus vaults?
---
If you guard the hooked person, 3 people are doing gens.
---
If you run off and find someone else, 1 will be in chase, 1 hooked, 1 will be unhooking and probably healing, that‘s 3 people busy and only 1 on gens. 
---
Also: breaking pallets takes 2.6 seconds. If you can force a stun by swinging through the pallet, you can get rid of it quickly. Never try to catch them with a pallet being down unless the obstacle is really small (like just a tree or whatever). Never be afraid of the stun, Enduring is a great perk to deal with this.
---
Am also ded. OP's dad got me good
---
I noticed the pallet destruction is like 75% louder
---
What’s the point of having addons then? It’s entire purpose is to increase the deadly-ness and useablity of the power.
---
Because shrine for example asks the server what it should display. Perks don’t do that. They don’t have this kind of control
---
doing gens, you?
---
You’re focusing on the wrong things man. You let 4 kids get under your skin in a video game and came here to get validation and acceptance from the community for your play style is essentially what I’m seeing. If you wanted a discussion on the subject you’d of left it at “What are your opinions on slugging?” But instead you went into more length talking about how good you are and how much shit they were talking that I totally tuned out and lost interest.
---
This is BHVR we are talking about. A cosmetic that takes up 2 slots would without a doubt break something major in the game.
---
Holy shit are you me? I feel kinda the same except it started with spirit for me. She is so annoying to go against, and so fucking strong at the same time. I want to play killer to be super good at billy/huntress but killer queues are painful.
---
If you want to spark a discussion on here don’t try to make it one sided in the post body. Or if you’re trying to spark a specific discussion don’t jump all over the place in the post. It was mainly hard to follow what you were exactly trying to talk about. It more looks like you had a discussion with yourself.
---
All Ash wanted to do was chill in Jacksonville in his Hawaiian t-shirt he doesn't deserve this
---
In what way?
---
They have to carefully walk around because they are too scared to do gens because THEY CANT SEE THE KILLER. But when they do! THEY STILL DONT DO GENS BECAUSE THEY SEE THE KILLER!!!
---
Then when they get hooked they instantly kill themselves.
---
when will the event end? i haven't bought the game yet and i wanna make sure that the queues aren't 30 min long since i plan to only play myers. (closest thing i'll get to a halloween game)
---
Generally speaking a good killer has to tunnel at least a little to snowball though, the only time two-hooking everyone before a single death works is if the survivors are far below your skill level, otherwise all five generators are done and boom.
---
The other solutions like slugging still see the survivor get back up faster than your next chase finishes, and aren't decent options.
---
It shouldn't.
---
Honestly it caught me surprise mid game cuz i didn't read the perk so after i realized the nerf was in i had already unhooke 2 ppl and started to question why i didnt have tokens then read it sighed and removed for balanced landing
---
No thats just you. I literally want the skin. I've had my flair saying the same thing since it was originally revealed.
---
Agreed, it’s also pretty impossible to expose him standing next to you in the cornfield.
---
All of the cosmetics up until the mid-chapter patch have already been revealed:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68065/bookmark-cosmetic-reveal-mid-chapter-3-0-0#latest](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68065/bookmark-cosmetic-reveal-mid-chapter-3-0-0#latest) 
---
I imagine what Ghost Face released with is all he will have due to being a (partially) licensed character. So i'd say if you want to buy something for him, do it now.
---
I hid behind cover while a huntress kept trying to get me with a hatchet, refused to unwind to take a regular swing, and had enough and DCed 30 seconds in. We were only in the game for about a minute at the point and I was the first survivor she ran into. 😂
---
or just play Spirit. since they fixed sounds i end chase in under 20 seconds again cause not getting confused. but if more than one person have Iron Will... OOF. that's where they finish gens on my ruinless butt
---
This time he slows your action speeds in general.
---
Gens/healing/vaulting all get slowed
---
*High pitched miep*
---
As if the long killer queue times weren't bad enough, we get this shit when we get a game anyway.
---
Honestly this clip could be out of content we have no idea how close she was to being marked
---
Who cares?
---
It was the most anti-fun perk in the entire game. Now red rank builds will at least have *some* variety.
---
This
---
Is this on PC? becasue I legit just moried her for my daily
---
Same Kate outfit also had party starter
---
Yeah, but the power needs to be OK on all fronts with it's case values. If that's not the case, variety takes a hit  because you need to mitigate that one stat.
---
Case in point, Hag. 
---
Until her update, her setting speed and TP range were too low. You ran a necklet to increase setting speed and you ran an insect to increase TP range (which cost you there setting speed, making the necklet even more necessary).
---
The result is that there was only one viable loadout, and the killer was weak as hell.
---
There are others, but that's probably the worst one.
---
Happened to me too. Tried DS and 3 times out of 3 I hit the skillcheck but it didn't register so I got hooked.
---
I haven't been excited about a killer since Clown (which I didn't like when I actually played him cause of the janky way you throw bottles) but I'm having a blast with Ghostface. If he get's the Frederick treatment I will start farting uncontrollably.
---
I wouldn't use either.
---
Hey! Thats rude leave my boy bubba alone :(
---
Looking at that guy sitting by himself makes me feel sad.
---
It's so great to show off with it. I hope I make newer players wonder and look for it in the cosmetic shop.
---
Working with the killer is reportable if they are working together against you. In addition to reporting the player on the scoreboard (this is a must, but won’t do anything by itself) you have to upload a video somewhere and send BHVR a link to it via support ticket.
---
And I personally don’t give up on hook but let them farm me/hunt me down multiple times, so the evidence is clearer that they are friends cooperating.
---
Somehow he genuinely looks distressed.
---
Ah the Trapper and Clown one cracked me up
---
Because the developers of this game are incompetent fools. Nurse is beyond overpowered.
---
Who cares about survivors as long as killers have it their way?What variety is there?Killers only run 6 perks.Only 3 killers in red ranks.So yeah excuse me but the meta was used to combat the meta.How about we delete bbq because survivors do not like it(more variety amirite)?
---
This is like the third post where I have no clue what's happening on this subreddit
---
Good job on this , i’ll be using her more definitely
---
People with an ego think they are right, and are pissed if it doesn't work in their favor.
---
 I got called all kinds of names by a survivor who was really good at escaping, never caught her, until just at the end of the game, I caught someone else, and she got overconfident, tried to go for the save but got caught finally, and killed.
---
No...They ALL need emotes :(
---
Artist  Scott Straka

 [https://scottstrakaart.storenvy.com/](https://scottstrakaart.storenvy.com/) 
---
Micheal/ghostface lower part of page 1
---
This! This is fucking sick!
---
It's the game's problem
---
This has happened to me as well. A freddy picked me up and hooked me, at which point I noticed I was completely unable to do anything except run. I had a friend open the gates, ran through the escape and kept running until I fell off the map
---
I think they just don't know what to do with Nurse, really. 
---
I assume the problem stems from her being one of the only killers that require any execution. If they nerf her but leave her hard to play then we have a killer that requires execution but with no reward.  If they rework her to be easier to play, but weaker, then you lose everything that makes Nurse fun to play.
---
And then we'd have only Hillbilly at red ranks lol
---
I like the pwyf buff not gonna lie

---
As a semi-experienced nobody I think Ghostface is fine other than the bugs surrounding his power and how you can be standing in front of him touching noses and still can't reveal him, yet he can still stalk and expose you. Other than that, he is great! Don't nerf plz
---
Players said Freddy and Micheal wouldn't work because they would either be OP or survivors would just run making a cool killer concept worthless.
---
They also said jigsaw wouldnt work because if he was accurate to his character he would have to set traps and survivors would just disable all of them and hed just become a weak trapper.
---
Chucky absolutely can work. allow him to crawl under pallets but make it so windows take longer to vault. Give him terror radius hiding perks but make him slow and give him a short sprint charge. I think it would be interesting to see a character who revolves around their small size.
---
They could have just make it an other anti tunnel perk by simply make it that you get stacks by getting hit and/or hook 30s after being unhooking.
---
exemple : 
---
* you get hook the first time -&gt; 0 stacks
---
* someone unhook you and the killer hit you -&gt; 1 stack
---
* the killer hit you again in the 30s countdown (cause you had borrowed for exemple) or hook you again -&gt; one more stack
---
* you get unhooked but hit again by the killer -&gt; 3rd stack
---
* now if you have decisive or borrowed time you can make use of Mettle by getting a free health point.
---
Just print screen paste to mspaint and cut it out lol
---
Pigs nerf was to not make her overpowered at end game. They never changed anything else just stopped something being broken. As for nurse she doesn’t need to be nerfed she’s fine it still takes time to learn her but she will always be hard to face
---
have fun with it
---
You get to keep most (all?) Event offerings I believe. You just can't use them once the event ends. This is a genie answer
---
Accept it or you can’t play
---
Agreed, WGLF gets jack shit while MoM gets gg ez conditions and BBQ gets the best aura reading in the game.
---
Ngl idc how strong he really is he’s just fun. I think that’s enough
---
I don't mean just the red devil cosmetic set, its the rest of his cosmetics. It could be a step in the right direction because the normal cosmetic are split into 3. The hoodie and the  torso and pants are considered the body. So in a way, yeah the cape and head is considered one cosmetic. The mask is separate though.
---
Like if it was just her with no addons and she had to commint to a minimum blink distance she would be better.
---
Check my other reply to another comment.
---
Hitboxes 🙃
---
Kinda think Freddy should be Fire Psychic
---
I enjoy playing nurse on cornfields maps. Yes im a masochist
---
I know what to do with her:
---
1)There is a minimum blink distance of 6 meters. So if you run into her and she blinks she cannot get you.
---
2)Block her addons. She get's no addons. She is the most skill required killer and with no addons you can still win easily.
---
Of course I'm clueless, I'm not even memeing about "best" DbD streamer, how can I possibly know anything about the game.
---
The buffed ghost face quite considerably from the PTR, what’s the nerf you speak of
---
My man!
---
There are like 2 kinds of people.
---
People who can get Ghost face out of stealth, and those for some fudging reason. Cant
---
I do think they could've spread it out over several episodes to kind of highlight more powerful and better abilities, it was way too short for such a huge event. That is certainly the one gripe I had about it.
---
Sad trapper 😢
---
LoL is a ton better in optimization, though.
---
yesterday I had the best game with ghostface ever. I marked them all like 2 times each. I killed 3 of them, found the hatch, closed it, and patrolled the gates. I found the last survivor, a kate, she was close to open the gate, I downed her and as the timer was near to end, I let her on the ground to be killed by the entity. The timer ended and nothing happened. I was stuck in the game, I couldnt do anything. I had to leave the game. There was 3 birthday cakes as offerings and that was a 2 pip match by far... never seen so many glitches since I started to play dbd...
---
Gotta agree, never enjoyed playing killer until Ghostface came out. Still picked him up anyway, because come on it’s ghostface, and have been having a blast.
---
  Sexy, gorgeous, amazing and beautiful.
---
Right, you clearly don't know anything about the game if you think Nurse is balanced. That much is apparent.
---
I’m gonna just put it out there that I’m not an amazing artist but this is also meant to be very cartoony. I’m working on digitally inking a couple more pics that are higher quality.
---
Did you really just use a specific title to a specific moment and show us a 10 fucking minute long video?
---
Yes.
---
This is a cool skin for never missed legday man
---
Dark mode please.
---
I really hope the hotfix doesn't hurt him too much. Overall though, he's definitely my favorite killer and that's saying a lot because I really liked Michael.
---
To anyone saying the corn as killer is too hard: it's arranged in rows. Start walking sideways so you can easily see across the ross. Makes spotting hiding survivors waaaay easier.

(Also RIP me now that y'all can actually see my stealthy ass)
---
well I don't think anyone will watch a 10 minutes long video to LOOK FOR the moment that MIGHT be something interesting.
---
I really cannot understand how looping is bad. Frustrating sure if the surv is good, just like how it's frustrating to play against anyone in a pvp game that's good at what they do. But a "shitty way to play"? Really? The whole point of personal progression as a survivor is becoming better at looping to hold chases for a longer time, allowing teammates to work on the other side of the objective which is doing gens. As a killer this evens out by learning how to effectively end loops.
---
There's literally nothing the survivor can do on hook while being camped other than wait their timer out. There's loads of oppertunities along with exciting chases (which is why you probably play this game to begin with) for the killer when the survivor is a competent looper. If you can just clear your mind and think ahead instead of mudding it with "these nasty, toxic looping survivors ruining my game!!" I'm sure you'll find it's not that bad.
---
Never had this once. It seems as if people are stockpiling these things for a rainy day.
---
Considering the moment is like 80% of the video, it’s hard to miss.
---
Yes and yes. Adrenaline and Hope both work at the same time, so you get your heal, short speed boost and your 120 seconds hope boost. It makes the most difference against 110% movementspeed killers because they only have a 3% speed advantage instead of a 10% without hope. Still works very well against 115% m1 killer though
---
Yeah, if you only play killer you will get pretty quick games. And no I can play with US ppl and I'm in Europe, so literally everyone,but I would recommend not playing with a red ping ^^
---
Killer queues always take a bit longer the higher you get tho. Thats always been normal. 5 -10 minutes on a good day in red ranks,but you wont be in them anytime soon,I guess.
---
I didn't say she is balanced though. I said that nerfing one of the few viable killers is not a way to balance things.
---
I should just limit to 1 hatchet, not allowing +1 or +2 hatchet add ons to negate most of its drawback.
---
Oh damn, then yeah this needs looking into. It's getting annoying dealing with it every game
---
I watched a minute, noticed that you get downed, so that minute was useless and had nothing to do with the title and I quit. I'm quite sure most people would do the same
---
Inb4 no one in the comment section apoarently read Feng’s lore. She used to be a professional gamer before the entity grabbed her. So this is some sort of jab at her lore, maybe Feng used to be toxic?
---
nurse is teh worst and weakest killer due to being very slow and having a boring and somewhat hard power
---
Looks good 👌
---
I agree with OP, it's my favorite mori
---
Thanks dude!
---
No, simply because of the Director
---
Sorry for shit quality
---
Yea, need to throw survivors a bone for point gain. It’s ridiculous that it’s like 10-15k average as survivor while killer is around 50k.
---
I’m hoping the hotfix is a fix to his ability. Ghost face is a good killer but he’ll be better to go against once he gets fixed, and it doesn’t affect people who play him well
---
Used to be that you could kill right away. Didnt have to hook them first

....what
---
Dude they managed to make a claudette head that broke the game if someone can fuck it up, it's them
---
The truth. Thats why I say we, killers, have to play dirty sometimes. Camp and tunnel. Dont show the hatch to anyone. Be MERCILESS. Because we can. Yes, we can!
---
i've still got the firecrackers from the winter and lunar event that i can still use i just can't find anymore in the bloodweb
---
the only time I saw that happen to me tho is vs a huntress that has a fucktone of status effects on her hatchets
---
No sympathy for anybody who DC’s
---
DO
---
NOT
---
NERF
---
Its also the hips and the pose. Huntress doesn't stand like that and she doesnt have much hip she's more muscle than curves.
---
Whoa! Maybe this will make the perk useful?
---
What they should do is get rid of the +blink addons. The nurses thing is that she is strong but hard to play, giving her more blinks makes it way too easy.
---
Omegablink addons should be the rarest ones.
---
Those changes alone would make her fine IMO.
---
Thanks, I may switch out all my perks for end game perk just to switch it up. Will definitely be trying out hope.

---
Hotfix. Some nerfs are fair and some are unneeded.
---
What the fuck you talking about this guy was a sick fuck
---
I’ve never played more dbd in my life. I went to sleep at like 5:00 am the other day because I just kept playing more games of survivor. It was so weirdly addicting, even though I’ve played this game normally for months. Maybe it was the allure of constantly leveling my bloodweb...
---
Devs said no too long ago they want to make changes on her
---
I love the blonde hair. Survivors can swap hair color, so why not killers? I think it would be cool to have a Viking Lagatha inspired cosmetic for the the huntress.
---
BBQ and WGLF stacks only count to 3 now? That explains why I couldn’t figure out who I hadn’t hooked that one game...
---
The devs love to add unnecessary things that contribute nothing to the game and at the same time not fix game-breaking issues.
---
Bad quality image, irrelevant point and a fucked up title
---
Well boy-howdy
---
its worse than a mori, i've been killer-zoned
---
Yeah, sorry but no. Mettle of Man was extremely braindead
---
They changed it. I was so heartbroken when I found out.
---
Lol PLEASE BHVR
---
Oh wait for real? I swore I vaulted at the same speed as legion earlier so I guess I'm not crazy
---
well i just eat up shitty posts and woah nelly is this a stinker, i'll be adding it to my collection
---
You can easily play without perks and items as survior even in red ranks,on the killer side on the other hand, you better play on of the 3 ( nurse,spirit, billy) with some good perks and add ons or you'll have a really bad time. Totally not a survivor sided game lol I mean they allready made the choice to nerf gf again, at this point I lost all my hope in those cunts over at bhvr 😂
---
I think a lot of the weirder descriptions for cosmetics are a result of the mostly French speaking team members messing up little things, giving it an unnatural feel

---
I only care if they stay at the gate waiting for me to get there but leave before I can get some free hit points.
---
Out of all the times it happens, the vast majority is not recorded
---
Whait, isn't Hag free?
---
*Experienced*
---
We aren't all like that, I promise. We seem to be a rare thing, but we are here. I won't save a hooked survivor who bm and bullies a killer. I'll tbag in front of their hooked body for a few seconds then go do a gen. You bm anyone, i'll bm you. Don't bully the opposite team. We are all people behind a screen sharing the same love for a game. How hard is that to understand?!
---
Why does Ghostface have two of the same kind of add on in the same rarity level?
---
Hahah dude yes I almost get more scared as killer when I randomly run into a survivor, it’s cause it’s all silent as killer but as survivor at least you have gen noises to keep you sane
---
Whoa, settle down buddy. What are you even talking about with 'the 3'? Hag and Huntress are perfectly fine (even without addons), Plague/Myers are a little less viable against good survivor teams but still decent unless you're on Game/Haddonfield.
---
Don't make the bush your home.
---
I’ve not seemed to have this problem
---
Yessss
---
Nurse requires a lot of skill to play properly. Lacking that, it's t-bag city.
---
On consoles, she has the lowest kill rate (44%, iirc) and on PC she's only popular at red ranks.
---
Bugged lobby. Atleast if the match starts with such a lobby , someone will definetly dc and you get your offerings vack, so thats pretty nice.
---
Ugh this. It's why i hate rank reset. I don't get to play as often as I used to so i get to around rank 10 which sets me back to rank 15 each month and it's the worst. Never been in red ranks, but i've been in the purple. Honestly my favorite rank to sit at is rank 8-11. I like the way the killers and survivors play.
---
Anyone who uses crosshairs with huntress isn’t #1 period. Sverkeren has that title and I don’t see anyone taking it from him anytime soon.
---
but I'm big scared UwU
---
The message you got in game 3 days ago.
---
Is it a solo bug? The other three were able to get away through the gates
---
that same survivor will t-bag you at the exit gate one day
---
I know, but believe me. When you solo queue 99% of the time you don't even survive wit those teammates.
---
I didn’t say anything about using mori’s? You’re making yourself look like a clown, my point was I’d rather stock on the ebonies than something I don’t use 50% of my matches, take a seat!
---

---
there's really not alot as most are on the website about journals or in-game item descriptions
---
Been waiting for a game for like 30 minutes which is sad because i just bought pig and I was super excited to use her
---
wtf? I only got to play for a day of the extended bloodhunt, but out of all the hours spend that day I only got 4 GG in my bloodweb tops.
---
Nejire as insidious shrine makes the most sense cause she's also completely useless
---
This is actually the first cosmetic I would actually buy. Too bad Plague crashes the game since the update.
---
if you can try Knockdown(Leatherface perk) with Contagious Scream (Plague Perk) really good for stealthy boii
---
This is far too relatable. 
---
Shortly followed by the mad dash in small circles as you try to find the Claudette who inevitably jump scares and blinds you before sprint bursting to the nearest jungle gym where they fumble their loop and go down instantly.
---
I should use spine chill, because of the GF update and lots are playing them. It also looks like your objective is doing gens, where spine chill is very good if the killer comes to the gen
---
Yeah i just bought Ghostface and i havent even played him yet.
---
Thx :)
---
I see what you did there 
---
Lololol
---
I have 3 dailies as killer and can’t even do them because of killer lobbies. 
---
Survivor on the other hand. SO GOOD
---
 A C T I V A T E W I N D O W S P L S
---
1. You took my only perk, now I'm gonna starve. Mettle was broken. You didn't have to do anything to trigger it and could bypass its weakness by 99% healing yourself. Combine it with DS and it was ALWAYS 5 hits for 2 hooks. It took away too much time from the Killer and made matches piss-easy for Survivors!
---
2. Never mind me; casually sitting here with Ruin, Surveillance, PGTW and Thrilling Tremors...
---
3. BBQ is weak as hell! You can hide in a locker, stay within 40m, use Distortion, hide behind a generator  or fake walking one way. People only really run it for the Bloodpoints now.
---
Lmao pick him up by turning around
---
Give survivors a ghostface mask, matchmaking should be based on how many perks you have, and give us more bloodpoints for not DC'ing.
---
You're dads description of the hillbilly LMAO
---
really dont understand this logic, and its all over reddit. 
---
id love to be able to actually talk to these people face to face and ask 'why did you downvote that?' i bet they wouldnt even have an answer
---
Unrelenting and Beast of Prey are literally the worst perks in the game (for survivors its Deja Vu)
---
Unrelenting is valuable only if u miss 80% of your attacks and it reduces miss cooldown by an icredible value of... 30% THIS IS JUST NOT WORTH IT
---
Beast of Prey makes your red stain dissapear when you are affected by Bloodlust
---
1. Its not worth using an entire perk slot for a perk that only makes your stain dissapear
---
2. It works only if your affected by Bloodlust, which is rare situation and this effect usually stays for a very short time
---
Incredibly huge, morbidly obese, addicted to literally every shit possible, psychotic maniac which hobby is cutting people fingers off, tasting them, and adding them into his collection

No respect for the Sprinty Squad. ;-;
---
Well. What. If. I. Told. You. That. I. Am. A. Freddy. Main. And. Enjoy. It. Alot.
---
I watch twitch streams to help me out on being more confident and better overall! It helps to fill you in and watching it you can see more of what’s going on and get a better idea of things than going through the stress of playing. A lot of streamers play killer too so it’ll help you see what you’re up against in terms of abilities and differences between them. 
---
But, really, the best way to learn will be playing. You’ve played every game for the first time at some point, and learned your way through. See how you like to play (stealthy? Do you get downed a lot?) and adapt to your weaknesses. Read through all the perks and see what you feel is best to start with. You can also look up the ‘best’ builds for whatever character you feel drawn to and work from there.
---
Have you cleaned the dust out of you're  console? Overheating can make you're console start shitting out

that's a fairly good point. enjoy life brother

I can definitely understand that
---
Ultra rare wraith add-on makes his bing bong to be silent
---
Ft the old floppy Kate hair :(
---
Its intended, but pretty annoying from the GF’s perspective
---
Yeah I got this one lol, not sure exactly what triggered it but I was corrupt purging as the last survivor was sacrificed and the whole game crashed. Hasn't happened in my other plague matches.
---
I am sitting.
---
The name sounds weird
---
unrelenting is awesome for whiff tech
---
Just make the enitity block that perk out like event items after the event ends in the mean time kinda how rainbow blocked out Clash for her exploit
---
Hope kinda useful tho
---
The stay in lobby with friends is coming in a near patch. As its a heavily requested feature. So hang tight it's happening.
---
The only issue here is the killers taking it as 'toxic behaviour'. It isn't, it is just happy survivors celebrating. 
---
If they follow it up with messages or abuse then sure, fuck them. But acting like you are being abused because survivors are "teabagging" when you haven't chased them out of the map yet. Get a grip...
---
Shut hecc
---
Unlucky. Same thing happened to me too but the timer was low so I just ran straight for the void not knowing what would happen and by some miracle it teleported me right next to the hatch.
---
There isn't much official, there is a lot fan made and god stay away from it.
---
Better make like, some addons will block a randon perk of her, like more blinks and stuff, so at the start of the match one of your perks will be useless
---
Love it this explains so much lol
---
Survivor politics
---
Stupid fat hobbit.
---
Damn wtf else is bugged
---
Buy SOS. YES 100% buy SOS
---
Just giving examples.I dont think bbq is OP or anything.Also most people only use the meta.The exception makes the rule.
---
Hmmm let's see
---
No one escapes death - hex totem, can get countered by simply cleansing totems, mostly clutch perk for most M1 killers. Mettle of man - requires 3 hits to be active, basically a get out of jail card. Can counter almost every killer (except Nurse, Billy, Leatherface, Huntress, sometimes Spirit). Noed required you to fail and unless you had Bloodwarden or Remember Me it's useless in the end, Mettle of Man was a complete monster for high ranks allowing to get to another loop/to the exit gates. MoM got what it deserved
---
Yeah. Most of the time they make YouTube videos but conveniently forget to edit out all signs of rank. It takes true skill to bully somebody half of your rank or who is genuinely new at the game and then shit talk them afterwards. I made a backup account the other day as an experiment. I played rank 20 perkless Freddy and I had one red rank one purple Rank, a 13 and a 20 in a survive with friend group Horizon bowling me the whole match before shit talking after. They defended it by saying survive with friends was balanced and the game is supposed to be challenging.
---
Omg this patch came with a whole hell of a lot things
---
What
---
Don’t try to defend those sick fucks with that bullshit. “He was born into it” is not an excuse when it comes to active predators like him
---
So this is why I didn't get my 4 stacks...Also there was a match where I couldn't wiggle or heal myself. Had to tap out several times to make my character move again. And my bar wasn't progressing at all when my teammate healed me. The audio is now all fucked up too.
---
I'm relatively new so it might be a perk/Add on I'm missing but how come I couldn't preform any actions?
---
omg give Freddy some love. Don't play him with 2 lvl 1 perks with gray add ons and say "he's bad". Freddy needs perks, me myself (a Freddy main, who thinks he could be an E, D or C tier killer depending on skill, think that a perkless Freddy with no add ons, nothin' is lower than F. But slap on NOED, Bloodwarden, Ruin and a perk of choice, and your good to go. I'm doing better with my Freddy than my Pig (and I have more experience with Pig, altough that is changing). And no, he isn't a Nurse or Hillbilly, but at least it's a challenge? A Nurse just blinks, downs, hooks, blinks, hooks, etc. No mindgames, no "serious" patrolling gens etc. And that's not really what DBD is. Mindgames and countering loops is what the game is. The killer who needs a rework the most is Nurse, she's too broken right now. Same can be said about iridenscent head ebony huntress. #SupportFreddyDBD
---
Yup, pretty shit wait time
---
Oh... so it's completely useless?
---
Fortshite i call it
---
You are just unlucky with some dead zones. I think that even range add-ons don't help you there ( I saw even Omega Blink Nurses getting dead zoned ).
---
They’re saying they vaulted at the same speed as legion while as a survivor.
---
Don’t care ‘bout no Jeff, I need to protect that dog at all costs
---
It doesn't work, you can hear GF when he's in stealth cause his wooshing is directional.
---
Honest to God I thought that I am just dumb for losing all these guys in the corn
---
"cooler chainsaw guy" Triggered a few people.
---
rip
---
Sure, lets also make DH starts with 5 stacks by default too!
---
Aren't you a clown.
---
It most certainly is toxic. Waiting in lobby for a match only to be slugged on the ground? Toxic and this playstyle attributes to DC's. Bad all around.
---
What level of cry baby dc's
---
But what *is* the Killer meta?
---
NOED, BBQ, Nurse's and Ruin?
---
Ruin gets cleansed in less than a minute, already explained BBQ and Nurse's is only really good on 4/16 Killers. NOED is the only bullshit perk on there and even it is countered by Small Game/map knowledge.
---
The pre-3.0.0 meta was Adrenaline, MoM, DS and an Exhaustion Perk.
---
Exhaustion perks are very strong and significantly extend chases; DS+MoM punishes you whether or not you tunnel, which costs you loads of time and all of this makes Adrenaline more likely to proc.
---
With the MoM nerf; the Killer spends less time in chases, which makes Adrenaline less prevalent and DS returns to simply being an anti-tunnelling perk.
---
Now Survivor-play is based on skill, not just perks.
---
https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2012/06/15/david_altmejds_the_eye_marks_montreal.html
---
How else do you nerf it, without completely changing what it does?
---
If somebody doesn't know what happened let me explain. I ran out from the exit gates and the victory scene didn't trigger.
---
Here's the latest of my insane killer concepts, featuring the confusing love-child of Ghostface, Freddy, Spirit, and Mordekaiser from LoL.
---
I have no idea how balanced it would actually be, I just like the idea. I wanted a killer that makes the survivors damage each other. I knew it'd need some skill challenge to activate, and that challenge should be easier than an injury. But as Legion has taught us, an easy chase challenge can be really boring. So I tried to make a stealth challenge instead, where you get a chance to hide, then have to stay hidden from a killer that can't be run from.
---
Possible addons include:
---
* Have to do 2 betrayal actions
---
* scream when doing a betrayal action
---
* Can only break gens / can only injure survivors for betrayal actions
---
Let me know what you think and any questions you have about what the hell I was thinking.
---
I saw a trapper do the exact same thing to my friend. like walking to a hook, briefly pausing to think of all the good times they shared while appeasing the entity, and just up’d and dropped him by the hole.
---
The true John Wick of dbd.
---
That's the spirit :D
---
Wrong. Your character doesn’t.
---
Yea I have never seen so much stress on someone's face holy moly
---
Spine chill doesn't and hasn't effected vaults for awhile. unless that's back, which would be sick.
---
What if there are other survivors near the hook? This effect would be canceled right?
---
It helps to play survivor and know what it feels like to have that snatched away from you.
---
His nerfs are fine to mee, 8% is not that much, but he will be the same tier as doctor, so you won't see him in high ranks indeed
---
Imagine

---
Sad that this a-hole pulls the whole franchise down like that. I really liked the movies.
---
If your talking about the Creeper himself, Victor directed the movie, he didn’t play as the Creeper.
---
Even though he is also a creeper.
---
I miss being able to run Wake Up. ):
---
Even if this doesn't win, I really wanna cosplay this outfit of her &lt;3
---
but you bought the dlc from the steam store so you have an extra knife
---
GF got buffed tremendously and now gets some slight adjustments, same was the case with Plague and Pig. Chill your nuts.
---
It's 7 legion,Michael,hillbilly,leather face,trapper,plage,ghostface but if they have no stackes of MoM they get one stack for a full down and that's only from Michael and ghostface while leather face hillbilly and trapper if you get caught in a trap give you no stacks
---
Legion and Plague can’t 1shot, the fuck are you talking about? 
---
Also Trapper has no 1shot just the traps people can disarm or just avoid entirely.
---
They should teabag at pallets instead like a real survivor.
---
That NoEd buff is just rediculous....
---
Also, perfect game.
---
Actually, MoM will let you survive a hit from LF's chainsaw.
---
Didn't know about the changes. I was expecting something more dramatic like the MoM nerf.
---
You make him unable to stalk and also 1-hit marked survivors
---
The way I came up with this perk is that I saw a lot of people getting salty because of pallet stuns. I figured  that with this perk the killer could catch up with the survivor in a pallet loop (without making it all to op) instead of being it a way to taunt the killer. 
---
If you have some ideas on how I can improve or tweak it, I would love to hear it.
---
spine chill is gooooooooooood
---
Yeah but i said in my post that his trap was active and ticking. And then it stopped ticking but a red clock remained around his survivor icon
---
IM GONNA SAY IT

# [ITS HIIIIIIGH NOOON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_Jg2MZexkA)
---
SCP-1155
---
That maybe what happened then
---
So they deactivate in endgame?
---
At this point I started to suspect the devs are doing this on purpose. Why is this game so buggy and why not only they can’t fix them but make them WORSE!?
---
If I read the patches correctly, it was after patch 2.5.0. But I've yet to confirm if it was a bug or not. Because I remember it no longer working, and many streamers stopped running vault build because of it. But I mean, it is BHVR, I wouldn't be surprised if it was bugged and then stealth patched.

*Report This Image*
---
“Why do you want to report this image?”
---
**I’m in this image and I don’t like it**
---
Our guys are just old and from sweden or some shit, memes are hard if you dont tune in every day XD
---
Survivors get the cakes a lot less
---
"buffed".... they maked him playable, before his power never worked.
---
Dude, its even written on the perks
---
When **Spine Chill** is active, Skill Check IconHelp skillChecks.png trigger odds are increased by 10 % with success zones reduced by 10 % and your **Repair, Heal and Sabotage** speeds are increased by 2/4/6 %.
---
**Resilience** Grants 3/6/9 % additional speed when **repairing, sabotaging, healing, unhooking, vaulting, cleansing, opening Exit Gates and searching Chests** while Injured
---
BBQ and Chili is really good if you are learning the game. When you first start you can be kinda reliant on being able to see other survivors after you hook one, plus the extra blood points is nice. I’d also recommend ruin from the hag since you are new as it will give you lore time to find the survivors at the start of the game. Other than that you can pretty much do whatever and should be more or less fine
---
Its not gonna happen.
---
Pinhead would be nuts
---
That made me chuckle.Using MoM is a waste of time now.You see before getting hit was part of the game and inevitable.Now you have to go completely out of your way to activate which in my opinion is less helpful to the team.I feel the perk would either be balanced if it lost the other downsides(obsession and aura reveal) or keep safe unhooks as part of the perk.
---
Yeah but it's always been like that. It's description has never changed but it's always affected vault speed. Look at the wiki.
---
Sad
---
Shes like a congealment of old drying pres school glue that read a book about humans once and tried figure our what they looked like.
---
I really love pinhead. Would have tl make him op tho
---
\[Entity Whispers\]
---
Thats a good idea
---
How did they fuck up and make vaulting slower? Jesus...
---
Jason is posible then
---
I'm friends with one of these people. My name is "Mori her."
---
Hag carrying a juff
---
&gt; sometimes you never even use it cuz you die way to fast
---
I get it, you are not very good at the game or pretty new to it. Mettle of Man was too broken and they nerfed it, don't even start relying on such perks. Learn the core mechanics of the game instead.
---
And yes, I play both sides since I bought the game 2016. A lot more killer than survivor but still both sides.
---
Why can’t you use it? Did they take it out or something? I haven’t played survivor in a hot minute but I love using it on Quentin
---
My mom when dinner is ready ? minus screams of 'DINNER!'
---
I had the same thing happen with dead hard. ;-;
---
Chase is stronger. Definatly stronger when you play against good killers. I would recomend DS, adrenaline, dead hard, balanced landing and borrowed time as the stronger perks for "chase". For stealth i think spine chill and iron will is the 2 strongest. Then theres self care that i dont personaly like but others use alot. So you will have to feel what combination of perks fits you and your playstyle the best :) WGLF should be used if you whant to boost your bloodpoints and dont mind playing with only 3 perks. Feel free to ask if you need more help with this or other!
---
ITS HIGHHHHHH BING BONG
---
Can we officially get behind this dev and make sure they don't get a penalty
---
What's it been like, to accidentally have an effectual perk build?
---
It did work, the only bug in place was that survivors were able to just spin their camera to break him out of it. And he also was "playable", what you mean is "bad". Even when bad he is still "playable". 
---
The new adjustments mainly nerf two of his addons regarding the recovery rate of his power, the detection gets adjusted because it is horribly inconsistent at the moment. The fix the bug that marked survivors cannot get stalked any more. And they increase the killer instinct times.
---
Nothing that makes him any worse. The addon nerf is a slight lose in quality of life but it's only half a second of difference. The crying about these changes is ridiculous.
---
You will run the risk of getting banned for using an exploit/bug.
---
Unless if they change their minds and decide to give Australia/OCE servers too, Dedicated Servers can fuck off.  
---
I and around 20+ Australians I've talked to about this will quit if we're forced to play on European servers.
---
Can confirm
---
I like to crouch once or twice at the end to say 'thanks/bye', but I guess killers might also view that as toxic t-bagging.. But since most killers I play against just quit the game as soon as they get to the results page, I don't really get a second chance at saying it to them.
---
They could disable addons, just like what they did/do to bouquets and event oferrings. They are just extremely incompetent or the only programmer they have doesn't know how to do it
---
MoM was broken as all fuckin hell. It very much deserved the nerf.
---
This is badass looking and I would learn Huntress just for this.  (Considering how bad I am at killers, though, this may just ruin her reputation amongst the player base..)
---
why?
---
I also play both sides and I never had a problem MoM it was easy to beat it just takes a tiny bit of brain power which I don't really think you have, 7 of the 13 killers beat MoM so keep playing your shape and get evil 3 and one shot the person using mettle of man as easy as that my man
---
Survivor queue = a game in 10 seconds.  
---
Killer queue = 1 game per 30 minute tv episode.
---
I can definitely agree that safe unhooks should give stacks, and I'm also willing to agree that it shouldn't be an obsession perk, especially not since it gives no special benefit or lesser penalty as the obsession.  
---
But, and this is a big but(t), for you to call the perk a waste of time or even garbage **when you haven't even used it** makes it extremely hard for me to take you seriously.  
---
It is not a weak perk at all. It can still waste a good portion of the killer's time, especially on certain maps with nigh infinite loops.
---
You mean complaining bitches like you? I agree.
---
IMO this perks is complete garbage. The cooldown makes it completely worthless.
---
yea.
---
Technically BHVR has said nothing about it yet so it's technically not bannable. 
---
Although due to this not being on the same scale as Legions infinite mending bug (and the fact that not even everyone who exploited that bug was banned) I doubt bans will be issued for it
---
She’s my main and I assure you I’d buy this in a heartbeat
---
Reminds me of [this post](https://i.redd.it/cyi1cm77tj121.png) by [/u/therealKx3D](https://www.reddit.com/user/therealKx3D)
---
Well thing is, it was fixed months ago.
---
And you asked
---
&gt;Why would they change it?
---
Well there's your answer
---
people know it's broken and instead of agreeing to play normally they abuse the shit out of it, making the game even more unfun than it already is sometimes
---
When BHVR finally addresses it bans will probably go out, and killers are being whiny about it so Im trying to have less reasons to be tunneled. Of course I play Jake so I get tunneled for just existing
---
What is the exploit?
---
How do you use it?
---
Asking for a friend
---
But Thrilling Tremors blocks gens that are not worked on and it requires a down, just like PGTW requires a hook. Also he cooldown makes this perk completely worthless. It doesn't slow the game down and it's not good for tracking as BBQ or Discordance, mostly because of the cooldown.
---
Can you send me patch notes for them fixing it? They realized it affected it at the same time they realized resilience did too, so why would they only change resilience?
---
Yeah i don't mind grinding at all. Just bugged a bit that i might have to buy the licensed killers twice :/
---
Just warning you.... what a twat
---
Eh IDC Ill teabag at the gate since killers also have perks.
---
Obvious sarcasm is obvious.
---
Chase builds are stronger. But here are a few decent stealth perks (or perks that reward you for being stealthy). 
---
Urban Evasion, Iron will, Calm Spirit, Spine chill, Distortion (it kinda sucks tho), quick and Quiet.
---
Minecraft castle map when? Minecraft king survivor when? Herobrine killer W H E N?
---
Its funny how UE was so incredible when they buffed it and now the only people who ever use it literally crouch around the map and do absolutely nothing.
---
Rank reset is the worst part about being a mainly solo player.
---
That's not a glitch, it's just RNG.
---
I don't have video of it but I have messages after where they admitted to it
---
Every thot needs a hypeman?
---
Imagine one day bhvr buffed these perks
---
True, I trying to think of reasons why I came up with this idea, but i don't have much. 
---
The only thing this perk is, is that it's highly situational (like eliminating key pallets and leaving the more useless ones intact or carrying a survivor but you need to go past numerous pallets).
---
If you have any ideas on how to make this perk better, please tell them. I want this killer to be a interesting one that is fun to go against but still a bit difficult.
---
Didn't you know. 
---
According to the killers rulebook if you play Dwight, Meg, Jake, Claudette, Nea, David, Ace, Tapp, Laurie, Jeff, Ash, Feng, Kate, Quentin, or Adam you're a toxic Survivior and deserve to get tunnelled.
---
Seems they learned from Freddy nerf. They start giving all the new killers a 2 weeks chance before any change.
---
All the ones saying the nerfs are stupid have 0 upvotes and all the ones saying hes balanced but needs the fix at upvoted, are you sure youre reading it? lol
---
I must say that I added decisive strike just to complete the meme, I do not think it got nerfed that hard and do now think that it is one of the most balanced and most fun perks in the game (because somehow I always seem to get tunneled).
---
I also got a bug where I couldn’t use the “party starter” I found in a chest after being downed. Before my chase, I had the prompt but once the killer got stun and dropped me, the prompt wasn’t there anymore and I couldn’t use it.
---
Understandable, then you gotta get sneaky c;
---
Because all it does is help you a little bit if you whiff, good killers will simply try not to whiff instead of running this. Stbfl helps because it's on successful hits, things that killers want to happen
---
Anytime 3 survivors are loaded and a 4th doesn't come for a bit, it's bugged. Leave and re queue.
---
For what it's worth, all of my queues are under 10min.
---
What if they buffed insidious and it gave you immunity to detection perks like tier 1 myers, would be a cool stealth perk
---
That my friend is an unsafe loop. Would not advice.
---
Because the killer is the "Power Role". Accurate.

Once you learn how to play survivor it's quite easy, you don't even need any perks. With killer you just need perks unless you're playing Nurse....
---
Would be interested to know if /u/EpicTaph is on PC or console.
---
I can't believe they followed through with that threat, I never actually seen someone get banned from it till now. AFAIK devs need to go through a process to ban players for certain things on console and I can never imagine Sony/Microsoft allowing bans for just using an in game item.
---
*what am I looking at*
---
It's more that they put out announcements that said "These are bugged together, do not use them or you will be banned" and people still did.
---
How to make me a Plague Main in one easy cosmetic lol
---
Seriously though, this looks absolutely amazing.
---
It's really unprofessional and a bad way to handle the situation.
---
Something messed up with their action speed code i guess?
---
Wake up does the opposite of Legions blades. Makes everything including gens/vaults 15% faster.
---
There's no way to prove intent. Except literally nobody touching Wake Up and then ALL OF A SUDDEN just deciding it should be in their build every match after it's broken.
---
They aren't permabans, they're a slap on the wrist. Point is, you sign a EULA without reading it, then don't expect to cheat in a game consequence-free.
---
Entity headass
---
Consider this my signing.  This community is too talented to have a contest like this lol.
---
"Skill".
---
Half of dbd is just que times so that's what we do while waiting
---
if they are looping a pallet, force them to drop as many as possible.
---
DON'T RESPECT PALLETS. You want them dropped as soon as possible, don't try to avoid it cuz they can just not drop it and force you to waste more time
---
if there are some high walls, try to spin around a bit to confuse them with your red light
---
if your mindgames aren't working, just chase them down
---
if they hare looping some strong windows in a big house, you're better off ignoring them
---
I'm not saying it's good practice to ban over just rushing a fix for the bug. That said I am happy there's at least a tangible consequence to cheating.
---
That hit.
---
Well, if they manage to do it with legion, they could probably do it with this too
---
Who the heck didn't see that nerf coming immediately for that perk, it was literally just DS 2.0
---
You contradicted yourself. I quoted what you said.
---
Exactly. I had 5 games in a row where TWO people didn't ready up. Messaged one about it and they acted like I was the prick for expecting them to
---
No one bitches about self care
---
One thing I don't like about M&amp;A is the DbD "ability" to get you out of/in chase at random moments. You can get several FOV changes in a couple of seconds. A little annoying.
---
Personally, I see M&amp;A as a stealth perk and Shadowborn as information perk. And I feel they both are in a good place right now.
---
Lol lol lol do you need a trophy lol lol lol?
---
And in what world is a team of people going to do the research dedicate man hours to investigating this issue which was inadvertently created by the game team? 
---
And then ban the players who are playing their game thus keeping their company intact ?
---
The games numbers are not “Call of Duty” or League of Legends numbers....
---
They must ensure they justly ban and enforce rules as to keep a reasonable balance and player count.
---
Hence why every ban is a case by case basis.
---
And people are not Auto banned.
---
Exploits developers are worried about consist of.
---
I can blink to the top of the map and then descend on top of survivors and kill them.
---
Rinse / Repeat.
---
Or Mortal Kombat’s Krypt Head glitch.
---
Those are exploits that are investigated and enforced.
---
Not oh shut we fucked up the code and now a perk makes someone move faster in action.
---
We need to roll out a patch to fix this.
---
We are upsetting our community and may loose players due to their unhappiness
---
That is all they are saying.
---
Fact
---
Update: game #6, ONLY ONE GUY READIED UP WITH ME
---
I hate mom and I'm glad it got nerfed into the ground, but no man, lmao, protection hits are a meme that dont actually happen in games, they're like, entirely theoretical.
---
*chuckles in lightborn*
---
I can't believe that shit is 15 bucks, that's 3 times more money than the actual dlc lmaoo
---
Ok I can understand that. I remember I did that the first couple of games I played because I didn’t understand what to do lol
---
If that outfit didn't have the stupid triangle's I'd buy it because it's more faithful to scream
---
So it's not just me. Sounds are really weird. Games are pretty much silent now, except for the excessive asthmatic breathing of most survivors.
---
Why the hell is Meg so asthmatic?! Surely she's supposed to be a runner but she can't breathe quietly?
---
I found myself running away from a survivor with object of obsession instead of the other way around
---
Think he should stalk you in one go rather than doing the noskill no chance 99% shit that people do with Myers. Just makes him into a boring insta-down killer with no counterplay.
---
&gt;Sverkeren
---
Ralph doesn't use a crosshair either lol
---
I can't think of any change that would make this perk usable. As a killer you want as few pallets on the map as possible. And this perk doesn't help with that at all. It's an anti-killer perk I'd say.
---
Healing the fountain is just helping the killer
---
So many blendettes can no longer wear their brown clothes anymore to blend in and are going to the cosmetic store to buy actual clothes for the first time, I see a lot of claudettes with really... experimental outfits now
---
All in the context of the original post. I didn't actually call your friend a thot lmao
---
It’s REALLY good for bodyblocking. You can take one hit heal yourself, go take another hit instaheal take another hit mettle of man and they should wiggle off
---
Question for the cakes, when does the event for them run out? Or do they last forever and you can use them whenever
---
Same with WGLF. 80* of the time protection hits dont count so its exclusively unhooks.
---
The nerf was needed, but for gods sake make sure it functions.
---
Cindy*
---
Damn!
---
I didn't notice that until every match the survivors were burning AutoHaven offerings..
---
420
---
You do get notified about Lullaby before it even gets a single stack.
---
Literslly every player facing killers in the history of dbd XD well, less so since the god patch, but sttill haha.
---
Sure I’ll play whenever I can! My psn is Galllade.
---
I didn’t even notice the hatch. I thought we were talking about the treads.
---
Yup
---
guys guys wait, i really dont know what afk is and i have  been trying to figure it out
---
Personally it's saved me a lot. It's why I run it.
---
I don't want him, he's just a lame doll, prove me wrong
---
Let me guess, especially when survs run iron will and feather?
---
Nurse requires a shit ton of skill to play
---
tell me that you got them
---
If I change it to that the killer protect itself from the pallet and afterwards drop it. Is that a good idea?
---
Another idea could be that if the pallet gets dropped on you, you would still be stunned but if you react quick enough, you could still hit the survivor. Your thoughts?
---
Same. Me and a buddy were seeing why he was doing gens faster than normal and boom: Without a tool box he powered through a gen with ruin. Not hitting great skillchecks either.
---
It increases all actions 15% faster when it should only increase Exit Gate Opening Speeds and show you where the doors are
---
I ALWAYS get found in the corn. 😞
---
afaik they changed their approach with new perks descriptions
---
If it doesnt say anything -&gt; it stacks
---
If it says it doesnt stack -&gt; it doesnt stack
---
Granted they still need to update some addons
---
Utah... what could it mean???
---
It looks worse
---
They don’t deserve a penalty. They deserve the highest position in house. And a raise.
---
I love this!
---
Cool
---
You had to accept one of these when you got your xbox aswell
---
They're flexing shit no one cares about. You're not going to get banned simply on a streamers say so with no proof. This isnt fortnite you're fine
---
Was about to comment this lol
---
No the survivor is being jerk. Whisperers are a program BHVR made to give something to certain streamers and community members for them promoting the game. They get come cells each patch and some dlc codes to give away though they can't get anyone banned. Infact I think a couple lost their status recently for bad behavior on the streams. 
---
Some survivors are just salty jerks who feel try should survive every game and lord help you if they dont. I got message last night during a game that I was camping with Hag. It was a SWF that literally was saving each other 3 seconds after I left the hook. Like am I supposed to just run to the other side of the map just so you can get a safe save. Remember kids it's camping if the killer remains on the map after they hook someone. 
---
In short there are survivor mains out their that will never be happy.
---
We need to make a collective effort to find out how to trigger this bug.
---
it can happen with swf too
---
if it doesn't say "does not stack" it probably stacks
---
Restart your game ,or wait an hour if you read the thing it says “will arrive within 24 hours”
---
Wow, you got a 4k with hillbilly? You must be really good.
---
Just got them thanks anyways
---
I'm not going to count on it but it doesn't hurt to be hopeful.
---
I think saying anything like that with absolute certainty usually leads to sounding fooling when things like that do happen.
---
STOP CATERING TO THE RANK TWENTIES HE IS NOT OVERPOWERED
---
All I want is for him to at least be a solid b-tier killer who is fun to play
---
that one I think I did (Ive had this video for a month), the other survivor let him behind
---
Is this genuine confusion? Are you new to the internet?
---
Both of you have a point. Abusing an exploit is bannable, even if BHVR doesn't explicitly list the exploit and tell you not to use it. But realistically they probably aren't getting banned for abusing before BHVR comes out and tells people to stop it because BHVR just doesn't care that much about the quality of their game.
---
Oh shit dat gat
---
It was originally "away from keyboard", but now refers to any time a player is in the game but not playing at all (can refer to any system, not just pc).
---
Ever though OP is new to the game?
---
I dont really have much trouble downing them in corn. Most survivors juke less or run towards me in corn when blinking, thinking that i cannot see them. Im a legacy 3 nurse though. The only things i cannot see are p3 claudettes and im just blinking around, hoping to bump into one of them lmao.
---
They're working on meaningful ranking. Everyone is playing ghostface since the new chapter just came out. Only thing bhvr could do to make the matchmaking faster rn is push people to play survivor
---
Well if they have bushes as extensions and a pallet in the middle then its all right
---
I love how even if you see 1 pixel of a survivor's elbow from 40 meters away you can still stalk them
---
He is basically about same height as the hag, or could be so that would help a bit.  Even if he was shorter, it’s still should work.  He’s basically as tall as a crouched survivor.  At least in DBD.
---
He can jump vault windows and palettes.
---
Instead of carrying survivors he can drag them by the foot.
---
The entity could add pulleys and chains to the hooks that Chucky could use when hanging people.
---
Or the hooks can start off low and when Chucky hangs someone, the entity can raise the hooks to normal height.
---
I don’t think it would mess with the engine anymore than any other killer.
---
It’s totally possible just how to make it look and feel right.
---
I know, it's so dumb
---
but we don't have Sally as a survivor
---
Right now it's bugged, constantly active. So survivors with it get 15% boost to all action speed, all the time.
---
Well, its pretty obvious the art team is the strongest part of BHVR lol, yeah give em more work, let them show off and apply their skills.
---
Okay thanks
---
I mean... kiiinda?
---
The Plague came out &amp; there didn't seem much to worry about learning to counter. Ghosteface is kickin' my *aaaaass* dude.
---
You mean: Amanda&gt;Rin and Anna
---
have an upvote
---
actual confusion.
---
Their ability is just them running at survivors and hooking them with a hook hand.
---
What I did with it in case was curious. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c39g1o/the_chest_has_wares_if_you_have_coinsome_cat_some/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Hits once in a blue moon, gets accused of aimbotting or something to that effect.
---
Oh no, i buggered that one didnt i?
---
Why does stalking marked survivors have to be a bug? It's a think that creates more depth for him, and gives survivors an insentive to expose him even after exposed
---
Probably a pallet between those tracks
---
Totally understandable but tbh I feel like most killers that chase for long periods of time just get severe tunnel vision
---
There power is just kind of made for this thing. Similar to how leather faces power makes them more likely to face camp
---
That.... actually may work. Is it okay if I think about this for a while. When I think I got I'll send you a DM
---
and it took you 7 minutes to do the gens?
---
Oh, so that makes a sense right now, thank you all two
---
Hey guys,
---
Is this the correct way to refer to ranks in this game? In most games, better ranks are 'high ranks', but they are usually platinum/diamond whatever instead of numbers. And here better ranks are 'low ranks', because, well, number is technically lower? This confuses me.
---
You get notified because the increased regression applies
---
I agree it should be bannable. Exploiting a bug for your own benefit to interfere with the games power dynamic is cheating and I agree that it should be banned. 
---
All I'm saying is that a 15% action speed bonus isn't to scale with 5-10 minute mending times that we saw previously. And considering that they didn't even ban all the people abusing that bug, I doubt we'll see much from BHVR here.
---
Hag has the most fun learning curve
---
Evolve, but I think it's 100% dead now. On Android and iPhone there is identity v, which is like a Tim burtons DbD.
---
Would fix the problem huntress lullaby has at the moment
---
Pig was nerfed because of egc, even though egc was not in any way shape or form a nerf for survivors or buff for killers, the only thing egc did was fuck all end game builds because the Devs think that timer does anything
---
Probably not lol that’s just a rough estimate
---
Usually most people see 20 as low and 1 as high, like in a race.
---
Is prestiging him worth it? Does it make him darker and blend in more?
---
Plague is basically a low tier fusion of Huntress and Freddy. She can hit you from a distance, but she has to stay on you (especially hard for console players). Once hit enough, she gives you status like Freddy, but frankly, the broken state isn't that big of an advantage.
---
Everything plague does at range huntress does better and everything she does with status is done better by literally any other status effect killer. Plague is just garbage.
---
With spirit I like to run surveillance, pop goes the weasel, ruin, and bbq. You can switch bbq out for discordance to make it even more of an anti gen build, but i like the blood points. 
---
For add ons i use any of them that increase her haunting movement speed + increase in the haunting duration/ faster recovery time.
---
I like how you can loop killers forever
---
It hurts his add-ons that he heavily relies on, because he's extremely addon reliant
---
I've just learned of this exploit through this post. Luckily I don't use wake up. But I should imagine other players do. So they may not even notice. This would be a reason bans are unlikey to happen.
---
This sounds like something that should stay in the game if you ask me
---
The 3 guys who can't hit greats:
---
LET'S LOOK FOR THE TOTEM WHERE TOTEMS DON'T EVEN SPAWN!
---
Me, hearing the cleanse sound effect after repairing 3 gens by myself:
---
Cool, they FINALLY found ruin
---
LMAO old but good
---
This again......
---
I haven't played against him yet, I only get to play against Myers and Billy it seems on console, but I play Ghostface regularly since he came out, the only ever losses I've had were at the Myers and Freddy maps, that was because they were way open. Otherwise I haven't had an issue with being detected, I just lurk around the edges where there's basically always trees and rocks. I only get detected when I get greedy and too close as to avoid chase
---
Hey Look it's stalkface, ghostfaces better cousin
---
He means that he was survivor and it felt like he had the same vault speed as the legion he played against
---
"Even with the option to chase the unhooker" is a good disclaimer, it's not the killers fault if the unhooker stealths away and leaves you there with the heartbeat closing in
---
Ah ok
---
he is literally a doll, its not the height as hag, probably smaller than pig crouched
---
Coldwind is actually the most annoying map lol
---
15 bucks? Where do you live lol, i got 2 purple outfits for 6.27 USD
---
literally a post 3 min older than this one

At least Insidious and Unrelenting have an easy use in normal games if you try. Now Territorial Imperative, Beast of Prey, Play With Your Food, and the one that blocks gens that AREN'T being worked on for less than 20 seconds when you pick someone up are real bad.
---
He’s a better Myers with none of Myers’ weaknesses imo. He’s not top tier because he has no movement ability, but he’s definitely stronger than every other non-movement based killer.
---
Then why bother commenting? If you really didn't care you'd just scroll past. But no. You commented. Either you care enough to comment or you just want attention. I'm not gonna give you any more after this so you can just buzz off.
---
It’s a combination of the map, ghost face’s stealth skills and the players knowing how to turn their damn camera. Ghost faces are likely going to scream on coldwind or autohaven maps
---
I know, I try not to, I usually go until a gen pops unless I'm close
---
Truuuee but remember when they said no clown killers and now we got a killer called "The Clown", gives me hope but I agree I don't think we will ever get a monster killer sadly
---
Wow very nice. You are very talented.
---
Only time Premonition is useful is when you face Ghostface.
---
Lol. No just tired of seeing the reddit filled with pointless posts is all.
---
this is amazing! congrats :3
---
A Ghost Face teabagged me for like 5 full seconds last night and I could not stop laughing. Shit looked hilarious! I couldn't even be mad. 
---
Also, I was high. But it truly was funny. I want to see more of it, Ghost Face Mains!
---
That's a different situation. I'll try my best to avoid running strong loops like Suffocation Pit. But if you're just being run around in a normal area by a good survivor you should keep chase and learn how to beat them. You'll probably do worse that game yes, but you won't learn to beat those survivors if you don't bite the bullet and go after them.
---
What are you talking about? It was an ugly mess before.
---
I’m having the same experience, wishing I could find some survivors who don’t kill my stealth in no time flat.
---
i’d pay double for this
---
I’d like a Halloween (2018) Meyers and Laurie or Rob Zombie Meyers.
---
Love how detailed it is. It looks stunning.
---
"you pretty much only need fov when not in chase"
---
False.
---
The reason people run Shadowborn is because killer's FoV is nauseatingly low, hitting backrevs as Billy or looking at survs mid-blink as Nurse is a lot easier with Shadowborn.
---
I wish they increased base FOV to an acceptable degree and reworked Shadowborn to make your screen brighter.
---
Why does Ash look like young Steve Buscemi?
---
Do they really balance around the low end of spectrum?
---
Dude, just actually figure out how it works. It isn't broken. Not hard to break him out once you got it. People keep blaming the game and killer for their inept gameplay.
---
Just remember to stand up for a few seconds if you don’t hit the hex:skill check.  The check can still trigger even if no progress can be made.
---
They're just salty. Although if they were both injured I'd go for girl3 instead of 2 to avoid tunneling while punishing altruism
---
Oink
---
ass, bob and vagin pic
---
My friend’s PS4 constantly shuts down while playing DBD
---
Wow, amazing.
---
Referring to when i dropped them both or...?
---
One thing I hate is scummy killers so i try hard to avoid being scummy myself. At which point did i tunnel? I genuinely didn't realize I did, and still don't quite see it. :(
---
okay, i’ve wanted a perk like that for AGES
---
If I BM they send me salty messages. If I play normally they'll T-bag and send me "gg-ez" messages. (Yes I ACTUALLY got an unironic gg-ez.)
---
Instead cater to this rank 15. Bruh stfu.
---
Yeah had that same thing happen to me on the day of the patch thought I was just committing to the chase too long and that they were using prove they self with toolboxes.to bang out the gens as fast as they were.
---
Thank you! Very kind
---
The problem is the same for Bunny Feng: How do you divide head and body?
---
Aw thanks, I appreciate it! I'm glad you like it
---
can’t wait for glenOck to comment
---
It looks fantastic
---
When you were down, I was your clown oooohoo
---
They had three toolboxes with the same addons, and wake up, and prove thyself. I remember thinking, “Huh... Wake Up... strange..”
---
Welcome to the current state of dbd
---
The reveal mechanic is just super clunky all around. I just don’t like how inconsistent it is. I think because ghost face is first person and survivors are third person, the mechanic just isn’t fluent and doesn’t work well.
---
lmao I knew she was in there but I was blind about her actual position. When I hit her I was like OH SHIT THAT'S A THROW hahah
---
I know I mean they should put her in

cause being toxic is to exhausting broooo. and pfttt it was definitely salt.  ALWAYS PMA
---
"If i could save time in a bottle..."
---
You should already know which generator they are working on. They hear you approaching if they are not on a gen anyways.
---
He's piss easy to play against and i'm in red ranks.
---
What makes Trapper better than Hag? I haven't played either yet, but was planning on trying Hag next.
---
Tremors is actually damn good. Blocks gens if they're not being worked on, and tells you which ones are.
---
They also didn’t do anything about sloppy butcher on wraith. And that made the Game almost unplayable. So I doubt they’re gonna Hand our bans over this
---
OP is just shitposting
---
He really doesn't, everyone knows that Doctor&gt;All
---
gosh, it looks stunning, definitely makes me to give Nurse a try
---
The problem with his small size is that he wouldn't be able to carry survivors and hook them. Maybe they could add some sort of new mechanic for him instead of hooks?
---
Which part of that takes skill again? Oh right you would've told me already if you knew instead u do some dumb quoting thing where other noobkillers with no arguments can reaffirm your ~~great rebuttal~~ saltyness
---
Actually my favorite one of these yet
---
I do enjoy a hag game. For me I just got bored with the setup it takes at the start. But I dabble in her from time to time. I like the invisible triggering trap add on
---
An IG Thot named Belle Delphine made a post where she promised to make a pornhub acc if she gets one million likes (or whatever was the number, big one anyway). So she made it and she's been posting joke videos there or some shit
---
Lol did they really thought she was beeing serious?
---
That's not a ghostface problem, that's a small wall problem. Certain objects are actually taller than they actually seem, back in the day before they fixed Huntress hatchets, maps like Autohaven Junkyard's little 2 foot "walls" could block hatchets like they were 6 foot walls.  
---
It could be the same issue that applies here where, if you're looking at ghostface with your camera, the camera could be blocked by an invisible wall, cause of BHVR's Spaghetti code.
---
People think it would look silly if he just yeeted them onto the hook or used a pulley but they highly exaggerate how many frames/seconds you can animate that within, I'm tired of hearing it.
---
What rank are you at? That hasn't really been my experience. It does happen, but more often than not, nobody writes at all. Now granted, I do have comment on my Steam profile set to "friends only", so they may not be bothering past that.
---
Perhaps
---
He’s honestly not I guess. Depends on how lucky you are. If the survivors bring or find flashlights then hag is punished hard because they destory her traps. Trapper is like hag in the sense that his power is set and forget and if they hit his traps they damage one health state of healthy and snare the survivor so that if you can get there in time it’s a free down. Hag has to teleport to her traps and has a slower movement speed so it takes longer to run down a survivor.
---
I had a match with silent bing bong but I checked add ons and the killer didn’t have it, also I played a match against bubba and couldn’t hear the chainsaw unless I was close
---
Or you can just do a gen, save the person from the hook and win the game.
---
Whatever works.
---
Killer exploit, bans instantly,
---
Survivor exploit, no one cares.
---
Name your daughter and you're in for a treat!
---
Most people call the better ranks the high ranks, don’t know why OP called it low ranks tbh 
---
20 is low, 1 is high. Never heard it any other way until now
---
I knew I wasn't crazy yet. How close is that sound? 8 meters? 16?
---
I don't have 100$ ):
---
I’m new, to bbq perk everyone talks about?
---
Damn, she looks good. I would have a hard time bringing myself to run away from her.
---
Perfect 👌
---
Well positioned arm there...or poorly positioned, depending on your perspective.
---
Pls doggo spare me.
---
I saw the movie like 7 times and I noticed that quite recently too, don't feel ashamed :))
---
Well it gives you better junk
---
Looks like a skin concept for Izanami in Smite
---
It's part of The True Killer Experience (TM)
---
He's actually not all that precise though, all you have to do (unless he is running addons that change this) is get some space, and turn fully around and look at him for a second or two, which can easily be done while he's breaking a pallet. The reason you have to be so close to detect sometimes is probably because you're running sideways with the camera pointed at GF trying to detect him but avoid a hit from being that close. 
---
I've had games where the survivors can instantly detect me and I think "Oh God, did BHVR nerf him already or what?" but I've also had games where people can't seem to be able to detect me even if I blatantly were letting them even without running detection add ons.
---
me: i can hear pictures  
---
teacher: there's no way you can hear pictures!
---
I wonder why.. maybe because you are just being toxic for the sake of being an ass?
---
Urban evasion became urban immersion
---
Dont we all?
---
Yep. Even licensed killers get splinters. I went against a splinter pig and a splinter freddy.
---
Holy shit
---
Oh oh oh. Barbecue and Chili: Basically as killer, once you hook a survivor, you can see survivors more than 40 meters away from the hook for 4 seconds. Also each time that a survivor is hooked, you gain a 25% stack bonus to all bloodpoints up to a max of 50%. The perk is a Leatherface (The Cannibal) teachable so you have to get the teachable in shrine of secrets or buy Leatherface and unlock it through his bloodweb.
---
I think 8? Not entirely sure but it seems close.
---
An ironic name for my part time job lol
---
I think this is a great buff to Wake Up
---
“Looping is toxic!!1!”
---
Still took almost 5 seconds of her staring directly at him dead center
---
I've said this once and I'll say it a million more times if I have to. The devs need to stop releasing broken as shit perks which survivors will abuse to oblivion for a few months until it gets nerfed and no one uses them again. At this point this is a cycle and it's ridiculous (cough cough,remember DS?). Instead,they need to stop turning a blind eye to all the extremely niche, underwhelming and bad survivor base perks and rework them! Some of them should be combined! (Looking at you Resilience and This is not happening). I'd much rather the devs rework all of them than giving us another survivor which has 1 (one) broken or OP perk that everyone will abuse.
---
Reminds me of Oddworld: Strangers Wrath
---
"You've binged your last bong."

It's called "using the advantages you have instead of sucking everyone's dick"

Yes nurse is really hard. Just played a Leary’s memorial map. Was not fun
---
You, the killer?
---
Or you, the survivor?
---
Okay it is working. I am picturing the guy from the profile dying to a RBT over and over again.
---
Ways this game still makes jump and curse under my breath;  
---
1. Hag traps where one isn't expected
---
2. Myers/Spirit with beads coming from outta nowhere
---
3. A survivor slamming a pallet on me as I'm walking to kick the gen(this one gets me the worst)
---
&gt; plunderer's instinct in 2019
---
Nice save tho
---
Good job. Just take deep  breaths.
---
Seek help Lefty..
---
Killer. I'm not sure if it crashes the game for everyone but you get -2 pip :(
---
Me when I'm almost falling asleep and my mom wakes me up to ask if I did my homework
---
reminds me of django unchained ^^
---
you can edit your comment all u want but ill never forget :''')
---
Are you on PC? Me trying nurse in the corn on console is traumatising. I feel like I’m blind
---
M Y E Y E S
---
Now that’s interesting. What system are you on? I’ve played quite a few games as plague and I’ve crashed once. I didn’t think it was a known issue.
---
Deja Vu is actually good though, mostly for a gen rush build
---
"broken state isn't that big of an advantage" oh that's why No Mither is so popular and hated by killers
---
It's not bannable
---
Dude. A guitar
---
I've played 20ish game p3 , results may vary but still roughly the same
---
they hated him, because he was right
---
Stop going around and giving false information... it's not bannable...
---
Big mood. On my drive to work there was a generator with a light over top of it and every time I drove past I wanted to repair it.
---
Imagine complaining about a firecracker in a chest
---
This comment was made by the Pharmacy Gang
---
I'm sure he tried a lot of things while he was stuck in there. The only way to help the killer is to force him/her in another animation.
---
Spirit and huntress. Learning hatchet aim is extremely difficult but really really fun and rewarding. Spirit gets to play mind games for dayyyyys
---
No honestly I just leave immediately
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/the-plague
---
Could be related to puking, now that I think of it I was always puking every time I crashed at the end of games.
---
Whenever I see territorial imperative or beast of prey in the web I regret levelling huntress
---
Until they tunnel you, down you, then wait a minute to pass by so you cant hit your DS
---
I’ve got perks I wanna use instead of Noed, like I unlocked BBQ and chill when spirit was level 17. Put her up to 46 so far without it appearing
---
The one time I crashed I was corrupt puking at a tree. Hmmm.
---
Still never recovered from that Futurama episode...
---
The killer could’ve been using hex: the third seal if it was only in one game
---
Yeah it does but at the end of the day, they could implement such system in the cosmetics. Most killers are split with head and torso+legs and knives. If they are able to do it for killers, I don't see why survivors wont be given that option. Will take a long time tho for them to get a gist of how it works for survs. Give them time. They said a ranged killer would never happen and then you see huntress. Be a little positive that its not impossible for bunny feng to be out.
---
This is nice, shame i cant play nurse

Fresh bait 5 dollars come on down this bait will catch you a shark 100% guarantee!

https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints#Survival
---
We've solved it. Someone tag BHVR devs plz
---
I’m sorry for you. She can be op (if you have the patience) but still is the hardest killer in the game to get good at
---
why is it always Bill's? Why are Bill's the absolute worst teammates? It's not just in Australia right? Because it seems there's not a single Bill who doesn't have Urban evasion, hides in a locker when they hear the heartbeat and ignore gens.
---
I just think it's crazy how few cosmetics there are.  I love the hag and I feel like she has 3 outfits. Normal. praying mantis bug hag. And medusa hag.
---
He even touches the booty when picking up downed survivors
---
Tunnelers aren't usually smart folks. Besides, waiting a minute to pick you up fucks the map pressure.

You've given me some excellent ideas. I was thinking more like Myers when he seems to be more like a Wraith that can stalk. I appreciate your point of view, and I will definitely try your build.
---
Any of you play on ps4? I need a group to play with, it’s horrible playing with randoms.
---
It depends if the people you play with are good as skill checks probably. Lower ranks it might be better to try to cleanse it. Higher ranks it can probably be ignored
---
Lmao. 
---
Where’s Peanits at? I know he’s relaying stuff from Reddit to the devs. He has to be. He’s like the only dev I’ve seen responding to people.
---
damn. i guess i figured if it stunned them it would work, i feel like it happens to me all the time as killer.
---
I only have 89 hours on the game so forgive my ignorance lol. I didn’t realize they were switched till’ now xD
---
Use it.. they arent gonna ban you for using a perk
---
I've only just started playing the game again after buying it and playing it briefly late last year, so I'm still at low ranks. Does the toxicity get less in higher ranks?
---
Well then you can‘t really do much else but to buy a new Pc/Console if you want a better palying experince :/
---
this is exactly what i do, because i run small game it makes it easier for me to locate totems
---
From the people who brought you "Holy Shit there was a Claudette in this game?"
---
Fast entering a locker I believe.  If they have Thrill of the Hunt it will notify them if you're cleansing their totem.  Tinkerer will notify them when a gen is at 80% .  Spies from the Shadows will cause crows to notify them within a certain range.  Throwing pallets down.
---
There are others I'm sure.
---
Yeah was just responding to someone else about that, I play with casual players who don't hit great checks that often, it's definitely best to cleanse.
---
BING BONG INTENSIFIES!
---
but even then you couldn't lost him since he could just quickly stalk to keep track on you. There is nothing else than corns in the very main part of the map.
---
I disagree, because doing that will make playing survivor more boring than it already is. Maybe other objectives to delay the game would be a better idea.
---
/u/Peanits pls &lt;3

keep an eye on the news tab in game. if they announce anything itll be in there.

But the killers are designed around those equip regions while Feng is not. It's not that they don't know how to make multi region equips , it's that they don't want Feng to be a stand out case.
---
SHOOT ME IN THE FACE
---
Chaotic Good
---
The range on that hit box, holy hell

I find games in about 3 minutes as killer.

Nah, they instantly progress to second state because the game tells them to hold M1

---
I still need to get to rank 1 survivor for the achievment, after that I will gladly stay in the purple ranks for the rest of my life
---
It’s because of rank reset. Lower ranks can’t get into the proper games.
---
From LoL i see
---
because of the abundance of killers and less survs people are being forced into lobbies near their rank. and by near i mean they get put into the next lobby probs from the new algorithms wait times. this usually happens with new killer releases, and matchmaking has always been buggy. not to mention killers who smurf for easier games because they feel bad if they cant win em all :(
---
Unable to stalk permanently?
---
Oh shit, I didn't realize there were so many perks that caused notifications as well. Thanks for listing some of them out.  
---
Well now as a survivor I'm just gonna feel mildly stalked at all times. As it should be, I suppose. Lol.
---
Eh, I use it to lose the killer then get back to my gen.
---
He is a M1 killer, survivors are learning to play against him.  The devs have extremely bad judgement if they go through with this.
---
At first I thought it was a typo but then I'd realized what you'd done and....you're alright, buddy. You're alright.
---
No the please dont nerf him posts also directly relate to the reveal, they say hes fine as he is, also you get downvoted massively for pointing out its flawed
---
I stop caring about survivors tears long time ago tbh haha 
---
Love that build
---
It's a visual bug, you still get the bonus from the 4 stacks
---
Since ghostface release, ranks seem broken again. I get paired up with ranks 17, 18, 19 and 20 many, many times
---
It's just a visual bug. You still get points for the 4th stack.
---
Nurse face Nurse Face Nurse Face Nurse Face 😍😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Best comment I've seen today
---
If they've already opened the gate and are waiting to butt dance me, I simply never arrive. I have time to waste fellas
---
Yeah, Tinkerer and Spies don't get run all that often.  But if they have Whispers they will have an audio cue that lets them know if you're within a certain radius and Whispers is still somewhat common.
---
We had one that camped a hook while the survivor had kindred. Naturally we did gens for a while. He then cried about genrush despite the fact that he spent the game sat around hooks.
---
We're not all guilty of it.
---
The Plague: Am I a joke to you?
---
I'll explain with an example. This one match I had I found a hex totem very early on. What I thought was ruin turned out to be Devour Hope. Well, this Legion DID NOT like that. So he'd chase me, down me and hook me, that's normal. But then he started face camping me and I had to have my entire swf team come get me off the hook. The legion ignored my teammates, Including his obsession, to specifically come after me. I ran him the equivalent of 4 gens injured. I had friends body block for me and take hits, they blinded him and pretty much did everything they could to take his attention. But he just wouldn't leave me alone. Eventually my friends gen rushed him and got out but I was left as a sacrifice. I was his only hook, my Boldness was maxed out but I had zero for altruism and objectives.
---
Incredible. Gives me the same vibes as a lot of the "Dont Starve" characters
---
Plunderers gets you some amazing items.
---
🎵*having sex with the bees and the eagles*🎵
---
Nurse on console already looks hard. I dont want to imagine how it feels like trying to blink through corn on console hahaha yeh im on pc
---
Anything other than noed would be perfect. I mean you're playing the spirit she doesnt need noed.. shes a killing machine!! You ran over powered addons and then stuck on noed... it's a bit of an over kill.
---
If they keep nerfing balanced things nobody will ever get good.
---
its trash at high ranks, wake up should be buffed, but totem breaking and repair speeds cannot be with this perk. its too abusable (coming from someone who plays equal amounts surv and killer)
---
I'll leave and find a gen to do by myself if you cant hit the greats
---
But if you can we are now gen-buddies!
---
(And toxic genrushers to the killer)
---
(Also filthy swf)
---
_laughs in restraint class iii_
---
Aren’t low ranks technically the higher numbers?
---
Yeah we've been through this same scenario before. Nerfing already mid-tier killers is a terrible idea. Thought they would know better but than again it's bhvr we are talking about.
---
How in the blue fuck do these weird bugs keep making it through the QA process? Christ. Sometimes this game can be so damned frustrating.
---
But at least this game works, as opposed to *some others*.
---
Thanks to this comment, I finally understand the meme. The high ranks are 1-4, the low ranks are 17-20.
---
The entity just has really bad bm
---
yeah I hate it too when new players discovers the game and stay hidden from the killer cause they are scared
---
problem is that it's too easy to pip as survivor and we have people in green ranks who should stay in yellow ranks, and people in purple who shouldn't be there at all neither.
---
People have to stop asking for easier pips, it just make the game really boring as a solo survivor who has to carry 3 potatoes.
---
So a bunch have been listed already so I’ll avoid those, 
---
Discordance provides a notification if two or more survivors are on a gen, I can confirm the other guy mentioning fast entering lockers, exiting lockers if the killer has iron maiden,  and closing a box mid search 
---
I’m sure there’s more I just can’t remember them right now
---
he’s definitely my second main
---
it’s much different than my obnoxiously loud doctor but he’s the best killer that bhvr added in a while
---
Because wait times are already as long as it is so ready up immediately as your match is done and then mess with your load out in the lobby
---
\*Hears heartbeat for .01 sec.\* OWO
---
Yes they are.
---
I didn’t realize I got them mixed up until now - my bad
---
I normally power through them. Fom my experience, apart from altruism, finding the ruin totem will get you found and hooked more times than not
---
Slower and the players doing it won't learn how to hit ruin skillchecks ever xD
---
EW. BHVR who would approve this???
---
The whataboutism in this community is annoying. Nobody is saying NOED isn't brain dead. But MoM was ridiculous especially if you played one of the many M1 killers against four instances of it. Which before the nerf, happened every game above purple ranks. Get out of here with that.
---
Lmao it’s all good
---
Play killer, ruin found in seconds. Play survivor and whole team spends the game trying to find it.
---
Never really thought it was worth the perk slot. Might try it.
---
Ghostface absolutely does not need a nerf. Good survivors at red ranks are having no trouble breaking him out of Night Shroud. Even with his power, he's still an M1 killer that (in my opinion) has to make use of perks like Enduring and Spirit Fury so he can deal with survivors who know all the loops. 
---
The developers need to balance this game around red ranks and not green/purple ranks.

Survivors gen rush killers kill rush.
---
Whenever people play and there’s a ruin they’d just purposely fail the skill check rather then dealing with the regression
---
I still want carl
---
I just tbag everyone and everything as what's-his-face.
---
Actually had a poor Meghead DC when i was tbagging after hooking her and some survivor joined in to tbag lol. Don't mean it as BM, just having fun :D
---
Stop making Nurse sexy you degenerates
---
Imagine hitting ruin great skillchecks lmao.
---
This post was made by gen tappers
---
I would buy a Halloween II set with bleeding eyes Michael and hospital gown Laurie in a heartbeat. And a Halloween '18 old man Michael and survivalist Laurie.
---
Yeah I was running bitter murmur and noticed the other three finished the first gen really quick and then the second in almost no time after. I assumed at the end of game I was going to see multiple brand new parts. While they had green toolboxes no brand new parts but three of them were running wake up and one of them had prove thyself.
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah, this is my fengs outfit but I put her in the brown ponytail. Still looks weird but it works well for immersion, especially the swamp
---
Thank you for letting me know.
---
It's just like that in NA too. Bills are always missing skill checks on gens and kill themselves on hooks.
---
Naw, we already have resilience for that. 15% is way too strong as well. It's equivalent to having a toolbox with infinite charges, except you can still put on a toolbox as well. Even with just wakeup a gen would go from 80 seconds to 69.6 seconds. You could also take another item like a flashlight/medkit/key/map, since you are already repairing at toolbox speed. Not to mention, you also have the increased action speeds for healing, opening gates, searching chests, or whatever else the bug affects.
---
Thank you, I did do a search before I posted but nothing came up in relevance.

Cocaine is a hell of a drug.
---
I’d try to be a nurse main if I got that
---
it sure is.
---
But the skillcheck is red D:
---
it's been posted on the subreddit 31 times since the last patch
---
Does this happen on the PS4 too?
---
The two L’s my friend, look and loop.
---
Never believed they discourage BM. With a few minor tweaks they could completely eradicate it from the game. They just choose not to.
---
Years ago I had the same thing. Didn’t like to have the blood with it tho because it smelled odd
---
Meanwhile I only got 3 cakes in 41 bloodwebs on Quentin. Feels bad.
---
Nurse is good on any map except like The Game
---
Huh, same thing happened to me and I was also only left with that Billy daily.
---
This drives me insane! It's crazy how many people just can't handle ruin.
---
Psst, I didn't tell you this but kmspico Google it
---
As a Myers main I don't even see it
---
Plague only crashes the killer's game and only if she's puking on object that give her points the moment the last person dies or leaves the game. Sucks for you, but you shouldn't get banned.
---
Watch him get nerfed into uselessness because people have no idea how to play against him right now, then get even worse once people learn how to play against him, while a killer like Nurse will continue to go untouched
---
Not sure if its worth sacrificing feral frenzy duration addons for that tbh
---
He cut one of with a beartrap so he shows the other in pride

Dwight took one of his nipples, so Dwight actually has 3 nipples.
---
Hex: Phantom Griefer- After damaging 6/5/4 generators, you lose your terror radius for 45/50/60 seconds. 
---
Squeaker Slayer- The death of a weakling fills you with energy. After sacrificing a survivor, all remaining survivors gain the exposed effect for 50/55/60 seconds.
---
Omniscient- Every time you hook a survivor, all survivors within 16/17/18 meters of a generator with more than 75/65/55 percent complete are highlighted.
---
Also bhvr: Survivor pudding, heavily salted.
---
Same dude
---
Damn, you didn't need to end this man's career like that
---
In my limited experience I would say survivors are toxic at least 50% of the time. It's the reason I actually stopped playing the game shortly after I bought it late last year. Maybe things have changed now? I've only just picked it up again but so far it's been much the same... Hopefully that changes
---
When I play killer, I always have no idea of the protocol. Do I kill the AFK person to get them out of the match? Or do I just leave them to stand there and chase the people actually playing?
---
Me and my brother both had this when we were kids
---
Jane got a sex change.
---
Play nice = Teabagging + "ggez"   
---
Slug and camp when appropriate to 4K = Salty messages and you're a shit player  
---
Play a weird strategy = Both + Specific messages about why you're a bad player, fucking noob  
---
I'm glad I ran into a unicorn yesterday that was really gracious in defeat and blamed only himself not knowing how to go against Ghostface yet. People like that really do make the game more enjoyable to play
---
Its really worrying to me people cant break him out of stealth and its super easy.
---
Hold up, your saying that everyone isnt supposed to be sitting in a Bush prepared to throw down all the pallets, even if the killer isnt about to hit me, and die because it's too scary to redo the same thing. Pssh that's how your suppose to play.
---
Switch trapper and Freddy and lower doc, alot
---
Maybe i was able to kick it due to freddie being *S H O R T*
---
Spies from the Shadows seems to have been reverted to its old form as well?  I often see it go on cooleown without seeing or hearing any crow indicator
---
Remember that ruin is much more effective the more people share gens. With ruin it’s better to work on 4 gens individually then one collective gen
---
stake out gang
---
I did (probably wasn't you but it happened before
---
All you gotta do is run bbq, shadow bor , predator, and bloodhound. With the two restraint addons on doctor! If the auras dont prop the illusion doctors will narc on them. I mean running an all tracking build on a single killer to counter a few crappy maps isnt that hard. Get gud brah
---

Cornblindness is a real afflictions, suffers have difficulty seeing as huge stocks of corn cover the majority of POV. Other side effects are allergies, or confusing a dull totem or chest with a survivor. Maining doctor is temporary relief from cornblindness, possible side effects may very depending on rank but included: limited map pressure, m1 killer syndrome, fast gen completions, survivor disconnects, getting tbagged, post game abuse, getting called a cheater, and entity displeased. Consult bhvr if Doctor is right for you.
---
Eh the perk is okay,
---
Reverse Bear Trap
---
 B O T T O M
---
 T E X T
---
I feel like the first perk would be very underused. The situations where needing to fix someone in two seconds is favorable over just waiting for the killer to get a safe distance away, will be nigh.
---
The second perk is probably TOO much. A killer against a good survivor team won't stand a CHANCE if he has three more gens to patrol, especially if they keep respawning. Remembering which ones are fake will help for latergame, but this is just asking for genrush bad luck early game.
---
Tough Gut though, I like it. People would be EXPECTING it from Kevin - assuming the perk automatically triggers when the killer leaves - but as a perk on other survivors it would be very bamboozle worthy. Combined with perks that help hide your scratches, Tough Gut could clutch really hard. Hell, if firecrackers were a permanent weapon, they'd be GREAT for this.
---
that explains a little
---
it isn't just for me, it makes it easier for my whole team. additionally, i want to destroy all five totems. Small game just makes it easier.

I'm gonna be honest, I really hope Play With Your Food stays how it is. Mechanically, it makes sense. If you hit the survivor, it's ending the chase. It makes finding your obsession beneficial since if you have no tokens, it'll give you one if you down them. If you do already have some tokens, it just reimburses itself since the hit will cost one token. 
---
This addition is actually making the perk fairly decent when it was only ever a niche pick before. I really, REALLY hope it remains how it currently is. And furthermore, I think it should. It working how it currently does still doesn't make it anywhere near broken or as good as some other select perks.
---
On second thought, Wow you have some major issues.
---
I just looked through your post history and literally every single one of your posts on reddit are about politics. You need help, you have been driven to madness.
---
 Every one of your posts sound like a very insecure political edgelord.
---
Not that anything I say is going to convince you otherwise, you believe that reddit is a left wing conspiracy. Your obsession is sick.
---
Yeah, even with me potatoing on Ruin checks,,I still get it done easily...my GF that occasionally plays... immediately runs all over the map,looking for Ruin....I keep telling her to jus practice the skill checks..but she doesn't...claims her bad internet makes it impossible to hit it... 
---
*sighs*
---
Yes please
---
4/16. MoM countered Spirit 95% of the time.
---
&gt;Honestly surprised that the cancerous impossible skillcheck Doctor isn’t banable. That shit is a disease. ;)
---
It depends how the doctor is playing. If he is actively trying to win while taking advantage of his annoying build, this build isn't bannable.
---
If he is just being an asshole and doing nothing but preventing survivors from doing gens while not even trying to chase someone for over 10 minutes, it is considered "*taking the game hostage*" and bannable. 
---
Community manager Peanits reply on the subject:
---
&gt;If they are making no attempt to down anyone and purely stalling the game by keeping everyone in madness 3, only downing and slugging them if they refuse to move, that would be considered holding the game hostage. We would need to see that they are doing this for a long time, though, not just a couple minutes. The 3 gen strat on its own is not bannable, it only become an issue when it's being used to grief instead of win.
---
honestly reading that the first time made me sad
---
What most people would agree is tunneling is when you go after the same survivor 3 times to make sure they die as fast as possible. I think it used to be a legit strategy before stuff like Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time came around. At this point in the game it is generally considered both a poor strategy to win because like facecamping, it lets other survivors just do gens for free and get out soon, but also it's heavily looked down on by survivor players because when you're the first to die before almost anyone else gets their first hook, it feels pretty bad.  
---
That being said, many dummies out there will call just about anything tunneling, slugging, or camping. I had a game yesterday where 1 person claimed I tunneled him and 1 other survivor, while a separate survivor said I tunneled them. Not sure how you can tunnel 3/4 survivors at once, but that's the vocal minority of this game for you
---
oho thas a spicy

They were supposed to have made that change already. It was to compensate a bit after they increased the duration for the exposed effect from something like 20 or 25 seconds up to \~40 seconds. I don't remember the numbers exactly, but the idea is that you had the ability to expose them to extend the chase a bit if you needed to. Now it's just extend by default, so they figured he didn't need to be able to extend it even further. 40 seconds is a long time to try and run without taking a single hit. If it were even longer there would be little chance of a survivor outlasting the effect, even playing well.
---
the hair of that outfit looks horrible
---
Honestly imagine just the end of the game where as a killer you walk up to the exit gates expecting to see 4 teabagging claudettes instead to see a fucking firing squad that just guns you down
---
So freaking good dude. I don't see enough hag fan art but this one takes the cake. Lovely details and the (her) right arm looks dope af
---
#):
---
yeah. the player switched character and this happened.
---
I'm also having the same issue on the PS4. They run fast, then super slow. I tried remapping and another controller same thing happens. I thought i was alone, only does it on survivor for me, killer is fine.
---
Not everyone! Just most everyone.
---
Hmmmm maybe not splitting hairs. That's a pretty good point. I guess a true teleport would fail if she attempted to go inside somewhere she can't, rather than bringing her to its edge. I thought of it as a channeled, slow teleport, but it might make sense to consider it more of traveling through. Actually I literally just googled it after writing that last sentence. I didn't know it, but the Nurse canonically goes into the Spirit World, the same as Wraith. I'm 100% convinced. Slap the Ghost-type on her. I was wrong. Double pip for you.
---
Out of curiosity, how did you end up using that name? Bless you
---
I was bored last new years
---
It’s bugged currently, but then so are about half the perks in the game.
---
My only problem with that is there would be too many dark types with the killers in this game, that's pretty much why I made it stealth characters only
---
Very detailed, you needed to work on this a lot
---
Didn't see any rules on this fabled "necroposting" so I don't see why that's bad. About getting downed early, it's just one of the 50 things you have to deal with if you play survivor ranks 5 and up. I personally value my bloodpoints too much but I never blame people DCing at all. The game isn't ruined because someone disconnects. Some games are ruined from the start.
---
I'm mainly looking at the powers the killers themselves can do without the help of an weapon
---
Or you could just leave instead of wasting everyone's time. If all 4 survivors are safe and can go whenever they want, staying at that point is BM. Trust me, the killer doesn't care about 200-400 bp from smacking you guys out of the gate
---
&gt; The second perk is probably TOO much. A killer against a good survivor team won't stand a CHANCE if he has three more gens to patrol, especially if they keep respawning. Remembering which ones are fake will help for latergame, but this is just asking for genrush bad luck early game.
---
Additionally, how does it stack? If a coordinated team are all running it, does the killer now have 12 imaginary gen auras?
---
Hell yeah, that's super cool. Just what Hag deserves! Keep it on, man. You're talented!

And in the NEXT CHAPTER : DOG the BOUNTYHOUNTER coming to beat the shit out of every KILLER (just like all the other survs do).
---
Petition to put Jeff’s dog in the game
---
Dear Lord... Please work on gens.
---
They're both very good, but Ralph uses a kitty mask where Umbra has the superior hound mask. Hound masks are key to victory.
---
Lol, people really be bugging about their devour.
---
Only argument I can think of is good perks on Hollywood characters, so you have to buy with real money. But still, I don't own Hag or Leatherface, and I have both Ruin and BBQ from the shrine.
---
Ahahah, I'm not alone.
---
I was thinking about this, probably just the same way they do now, the bone headpiece would be one piece and the hood would be part of the body, that way you can still use the other headpieces to mix and match
---
BHVR won't ban anything of that nature unless there is a pop up warning message when you first enter the game, like how to announced the legion add ons bug being bannable.
---
Ahh for real? I've never seen anything about a cap, and I've seen people test healing speeds with different perks and items but never seen this combo, which I theory crafted as being the maximum possible speed boost.
---
What's the cap?
---
I didn't realize there was a rule against it :|
---
Tbh i didn't even think about the names, I just posted the screenshot...you don't have to be rude.
---
Look at those fucking tits!!!
---
Love it.
---
bills are always the dumbest when i play killer too, they always throw down the god pallet at the killer shack in the first minute of the match, and they hide really poorly
---
Lol myers is better then GF, GF has to stalk seperate survs and gets exposed for 45 seconds, myers can use it at will and with add ons can be infinite
---
It also gives you one stack of if you down them at zero stacks
---
congrats!
---
But ruin. Nurse calling and monitor are characters who come with the game.   Bbq is really for pets not winning. I mean yea it helps but it's used primarily for the bonus to Bps.
---
BBQ 3 is only giving me 3 stacks. Unless something was changed and I missed it. I've had multiple games where I kill all 4 and still only getting 3 stacks. Perhaps a visual bug.
---
Like 16 times where?  
---
Didn’t watch the anniversary stream. 
---
That’s a shame they aren’t accepting it. They’d make a pretty penny in the shop I bet lol
---
I've had my moments of hardcore camping too lol and you're right it isn't fun. Hell I hate reaching endgame and have to resort to camping the last person on the hook so they don't escape. People that know how to loop efficiently I give up chase and find somebody else.
---
Took a while to realize :D wait for your friends to die
---
Thanks for the feedback on the perks it opened my eyes a bit to things like the need for Quick fix being low and AD being a bit too op.
---
Ad could be replaced with a different perk i thought of called Performers Gamble 
---
Basically it just gives everything a delayed notification to the killer so instead of them immediately knowing you used Tough Gut, it would show up maybe 2 seconds late
---
but still in the end I am really happy you gave such a good critique of my work :D Thanks
---
I'm shamefully bad at skill checks and feel like I'm just slowing down the progress of my teammates when I work on a Ruin gen with them, so I'd rather work on one on my own.
---
Edit in your platform
---
How to thank the killer -&gt; Crutch at the exit once -&gt; look at the killer -&gt; nod with your mouse -&gt; leave.
---
Too many killers too little survivors. Simple as that.
---
Same problem as him, PC.
---
Yeah, i mean swf it's a great thing, but the soloQ surv like me, are completely penalised on high ranks, i mean, all the players should have a chance to win and have fun, not only swf players :D but i admit that swf its a fun component, pretty much for every multiplayer game.
---
YES! YES! OH MY GOD YES!
---
I got stuck in a game like this for over an hour. It was unbelievable. Doctor would not hook anyone at all and just kept slugging. We got 3 genned because some people don’t realize when a killer is forcing it to happen, but my buddy found a key in a chest. But all 4 were alive and there was still the one gen to do. Eventually I was able to get the doc’s attention long enough to annoy him, and he put me on my first hook. I killed myself so everyone else could get out. But it was the longest round of my life. 
---
Oh, and the icing on the cake is that one of the randoms went at my friend after the game like, “you had a key the whole time? We could have opened the hatch an hour ago.” They did not understand the hatch spawn rules whatsoever and kept harassing him for “working with the killer” to hold the game hostage.
---
The view count speaks for itself. umbraEZ

---
There is a difference between a character being made that way, in which the head and body take up a single slot, and a character that has the head and body as separate slots.
---
When Legion released people were saying that them having hoods proves that the Bunny Feng can be done. It's the same situation.
---
Well Stevie Handjobs, I suggest you use some deviousness to trick the killers into accepting a handjob.
---
It serves a purpose sometimes, can be used to draw killers away from a hook or buy other survivors time to open a different gate
---
Ghost face was just released so I'm sure many people are queueing up to play him.
---
No that's your teammate being an asshole
---
We won't rest until our Utopia becomes reality
---
Here is a different idea.
---
Add communication for random groups too. Then re balance the game accordingly (probably make gens take a bit longer to repair).
---
I'd say communication enabled by default not only helps balance SWF, but it makes the game more fun.
---
I try to tell my boyfriend this when we play together but he refuses to do a gen with ruin active someone please help me

See, I wasn't sure if you were digging that deep or not with it, because I really had to think about it, "you didn't finish the meme ***generator.***" Nicely done.

Type Of Bug: Sound Issues, FPS after Update
---
Description: Several issues with the music, sounding and chase sounds. The frames have also dropped with some freezes here and there on the menu and in-game. The last update showed better improvement to the frames but this one has slowed it.
---
Hag and doctor weren’t at launch with PC. They were DLC that was already released by the time the game came to console, so they were just included on there.
---
Legion "slightly nerfed"
---
 Dude got obliterated. Literally unplayable killer. Worse than Freddy.
---
At this point I don't know if you genuinely can't tell the difference between tunneling like a clown and survivors farming each other.
---
Shit if fucked yo. Ps4.
---
Hmm, where to start.
---
1. Sound is AGAIN all other the place, heartbeat of killer and mostly everything else is a lot quiter.
---
2. Red loading thingy have black bars around looking cheap.
---
3. White loading circle sometimes stay spinning on the right side for entirety of the match.
---
4. Played few games against t possing killers, best one was against billy, where all his chainsaw sounds where gone and you couldn't tell when he starts his chainsaw.
---
5. Still haven't heard a word about skill check fix, when you leave the generator, or stop healing and you just blow up the gen or stab yourself and give out your position for the sole reason you where unlucky. Just make it like overcharge skill check already.
---
6. People can't heal you/snap you out of dream state from time to time.
---
7. Many perks don't work as they should. I heard few add ons are broken too.
---
8. New loading screen is worse than old one, it leaves just a black screen for few seconds and you think game just straight up crashed.
---
10. Ghostface can just walk right in front of your face, move a bit to the left or right and stalk you to insta down you, and you can't do shit about it.
---
You know as well they’ll ‘hotfix’ ghostface 2 days after launch but leave all the game breaking stuff in until mid chapter patch. 
---
I didn’t need to hear the killers heartbeat as a survivor anyway! :’P
---
Crazy, like ‘must change slightly above average killer immediately’ while leaving an extra 15% bonus to gen speed and other actions, because y’know games didn’t finish quickly enough already.
---
Same problem, PS4.
---
Agrreeeeddd,  especially in this game, where each side is necessary for one another. I'll keep playing respectfully and hope that it changes. ☺
---
No, scratchmarks only appear when you're running. Walking does not trigger them ;-)
---
Probably 99.X and it got rounded up.
---
It was fixed ;) This bug was in the game around Legion release
---
Sorry man, I can't take you seriously when you can't even spell properly. Next time learn your grammar before posting anything if you want people to even comprehend what you're saying. 
---
P.S. I also recommend thinking of proper arguments as well if you want to make a point, just because you said so doesn't mean it's a fact.
---
I 100% agree with this. Oh and revert the stupid change on enduring that makes it not affect ds stuns
---
Wraith rocking the Romero Hatchet
---
No, as you can just use tape on the center of your screen.
---
As a survivor, experience and map knowledge. Streamers loop people around because they literally have thousands of hours in the game and they've done it thousands of times. That's if you're solo, of you can get friends to play with your even better. I've played this game several times with friends new to the game and we won most of our matches. Communication as a survivor puts this game on Very Easy mode. 
---
As a killer, experience, map knowledge and control. You'll learn to dictate where the survivor goes. You'll end up winning more matches that way. For example, when a survivor tries to loop me around the killer shack or jungle gyms, I'll always do double fakes. Fake I'm going one way, see them come back, fake I'm going the other way, and when they back track again, I'm right in front of  them vaulting a window and I've closed the gap considerably.

Bug type: Gameplay
---
Description: Unable to heal, wiggle, or leave through the gates for the entire match (exit hitbox past the gates does not trigger)
---
Steps to reproduce: Honestly, no idea. It happened seemingly completely randomly and it lasted the whole match, so it might have something to do with what happens while loading in. The trial was against a Leatherface at Yamaoka Estate. I had Lithe/Selfcare/Spinechill/Resilience, but I used this exact same build multiple times this update and this bug has only occurred once.
---
Expected result: Being able to heal, wiggle, or escape.
---
Actual result: the prompts for healing (both self and others) do not appear, the wiggle bar does not appear while being carried, and the escape trigger zone does not activate.
---
Reproduction rate: ~20%? It was one match out of five that I have played since the update. I wish I could provide more info but that's all I know as of now.
---
Who uses predator
---
Yeah. Isn't the stun 4 or 5 seconds?
---
And red means scary.
---
I never understand number 3. You're wasting a pallet for literally nothing. I didn't even know you were there and was leaving. Now I see you and you wasted a pallet for a loop.
---
Lmao good meme. I love that video.
---
lol as expected.
---
True,
---
It would get really annoying fast.
---
Im gonna get some better ideas in my noggin before I remake Kevins Perks
---
Still scares the shit out of me regardless
---
I'm glad I can actually hear survivors over chase music/general background music...but I still have to turn it up to hear the survivors....and when I do that breaking generators breaks my ears. For a game so reliant on sound they really manage to fuck it up every time.
---
Exactly, why play by survivor rules?
---
I dunno right now it's so low it's almost non existent
---
I'm fine with all the other perks, but Corrupt Intervention's pretty good atm; there's no reason to change it.
---

Skip to where it talks about rarity, Plunderer's is actually a pretty good perk for chest looting since it makes getting very rare items easier to get than uncommon items.

UNFORTUNATELY yes. I say unfortunately because I'm **total shit** at them. But yes, they are still found in Bloodwebs and chests.

---
it's not just BBQ it's all perks that use a token system. I was using fired up and thought they nerfed it because I only got 3 tokens
---
Fkn wicked

---
i played exclusively survivor for most of my play time and now main killer i must say, damn it does not feel good to be a killer lol..
---
i was playing killer and i got double pallets at the entrance to the asylum, literally the two safest pallets in the game
---
then I played survivor and of course there were 0 pallets there
---
In this game people think something challenging is something impossible.
---
I believe it's back because Resilience was bugged for a while and also did not apply to vaults, despite the text saying it does.
---
I'm guessing they broke Wake Up! when they fixed resilience and spine chill
---
I’m on PS4 I have the same name as I have here on reddit, petycache just make sure to say you’re from here
---
See, the problem is exactly that she is one of the viable Killers. She and Hillbilly are *the* viable Killers.
---
The problem with this is that they can't make other Killers reach Nurse or Billy tier without completely breaking them and still don't rework Billy and Nurse, so Survivors need to be able to compete with both AND the entire Killer roster. This ends up making Survivors overpowered for almost every Killer that isn't Nurse/Billy.
---
If they reworked Nurse and Billy to be closer to other Killers' tiers, we would finally have the chance to rework Survivors to make the game better for every Killer and finally have some actual balancing in the game.
---
Yes, it’s a known bug at the moment.
---
running perks like ruin, bbq and nurses or any "meta" is nice and all but get boring after a few games. it's fun to mix things up and try new things with different perks you know
---
Well they said double blood points ended on the 18th so... also it could be like a blood hunt with more stuff like this!
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/Zq70uL5x-7c), this should help. He is a Tapp main, right?
---
it is purely visual so if you hook all 4 people you still get the 100% bonus
---
I keep reading GF as girlfriend not ghost face 😤
---
That Gamble one actually sounds like it'd be a spicey confusing one. I like it.
---
Only from M1
---
Good thing almost none of these affect me
---
No, but it is kinda useless, since you'll get it in a few games. the hardest part is not aiming, is to know when and where to throw a hatchet.
---
LETTUCE HAG
---
Yeh. I'm legioning as Susie (Frank mask so, it wasn't your game prolly) and it's offputting.
---
nah the basement perk is just universally garbage. They die only a little quicker (not enough to save you time, anyway) when you’d rather them stay alive longer so you can bait other surv’s if you are hook camping
---
I hope
---
UE needs a cooldown because of the behavior it encourages imho.
---
I was thinking this and the plague comment, such a versatile design
---
Dammit philly
---
The next part got me laughing legit the first time I saw it "Is this where I'm supposed to injure myself and fall down?" \*breaks her own leg\* "Oh no, it's hurts so bad Mr. Killer."
---
Indeed! I'm an UE user myself, and I do work on gens if I'm not being chased, but I have seen to many super immersed UE users who does nothing.
---
Probably not lmao, it was on PS4 at the preschool and she just dropped from the hole right in front of me. Also a while back before EGC and all that jazz
---
Could get it faster with the wake up exploit. Assuming your not planning to run it in an actual game
---
I still say Billy is a fire type. But this still makes more sense than it should lol
---
For me, on EU, it's either Meg or Dwight.
---
Originally they never planned swf.
---
Yesterday I got a 4k, but only 80% sacrificed. Like wat?

Bug: Nurse can't apply Dark Devotion with her blink-strikes, it's clearly meant to as it stacked MoM and procced infectious fright.
---
Just got him p1 today and having a blast. I haven't even gotten ruin yet and he's still fun.
---
Not sure about that. Still requires someone to come and still pick you up off the ground,  same as unhooking.
---
The amount of nostalgia this one image brings.
---
You wanna call it cheating? Go for it.
---
It's not cheating though, everyone on has access to it and doesn't directly tamper with the game.
---
New perk: bite the killer’s dick off
---
Good point, im stupid
---
(Ps4) (visual bug) 
---
I Couldn't see any generator auras and I have no idea what caused it
---
I was really interested in purchasing him (I’m just getting back into the game haven’t played much since around the spirit’s release) but since he’s about to be ruined even though I’d say from what I’ve seen he’s pretty well rounded if not weak. I’m not sure if I should purchase him or not now. I may just stick to Spirit,
---
Na its nothing to do with that just fragile killers getting upset.
---
No it doesn't
---
Useful for when you're throwing out attempted hits to see what lands and what doesn't.
---
I have landed pure bullshit because of that mentality. I don't mind Unrelenting for this reason.
---
BRB, equipping wake up
---
Yes.  I'll explain in a second.
---
He’s right Tapp is best survivor don’t @ me
---
[LFG](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdLFG/)
---
ooh, appropriately Pathologic'd
---
these perks have true POWAAAAAAA
---
I think that the game should strive for more killers around Myers' level, and this is coming from a nurse main. Nurse is so prevalent at high ranks because she defeats the number one enemy of all killers: the shitty ass map design.
---
It's the way you said it. Tone doesn't translate well in text. If you'd said "your post will probably get taken down." Or "you need to take it down." Then it would have seemed like a very different tone. But "Hope your post gets taken down." Seems like a very smartass way to say it.
---
And again, I had not thought about the names at all. If I had, I'd have censored them out. As it is, I'll delete the post now. In the future, think about how what you say will seem to the person you're talking to. And I'll keep a closer eye on the rules so I don't accidentally break them again.
---
Oof
---
Should of DC’d. These pricks know they’re exploiting.

Welcome to death by sweatys

She used to be like that.

  Corn blindness is real

This has to be my favourite one of these yet.

Doesn't fit, just some fanservice bullcrap
---
I'm literally dying in laughter from this.
---
PS4, 
---
Played with The ghost (idk if this makes a difference) I was unable to self heal or wiggle when grabbed
---
I think it's safe to assume she was definitely toxic
---
“ChAsEs LoSt”
---
I'm starting to think you need enduring and spirit fury
---
This is awesome!
---
I just hope that all of the people complaining about Nurse actually play her.
---
Plague's animation is a tad bit different, she gracefully steps on it with her toes/front part of her foot.
---
This is fantastic. I love the viking influence and now you got me wondering I'd there's a way to do a viking inspired hag
---
Great work
---
Well winning against good omega blink nurse is impossible
---
So would you d
---
say that it is fair that a character is OP/Broken when played right? You cannot say that because she is hard to play she is balanced.
---
My friends and I played Drunk by Daylight, and I bought the Born in the USA skin for Jake. I decided to be a Jake main then.
---
As far as I know, yes.
---
Yes it does... Text from the perk
---
"Any Survivors that are within the Killer's Terror Radius while another Survivor is put into the Dying State with your basic attack, will yell and reveal their current location to the Killer for 4/5/6 seconds."
---
 Any Survivors that are within the Killer's [Terror Radius](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Terror_Radius) while another Survivor is put into the [Dying State](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dying_State) with your **basic attack**
---
Pretty solid video. Was expecting garbage honestly lmao but this is nice.
---
Only criticism is maybe expand your sound effect library as rn its basically identical to other DBD YTs. Otherwise great job
---
I would normally google before posting to reddit but this seemed like the exact type of search that wouldn't get very good results.
---
You need to read the perk again.
---
the :3 face better be part of the skin when this wins
---
Same options are available on console with the up and down button on the directional pad. I like slapping my teammates faces with the come here when they are afk lol
---
you must have him in the arbitrarily magic detection zone in the center of your screen
---
they're making said zone bigger in a hotfix. Honestly I think it should just be bigger in a chase only
---
Who pissed in your coffee
---
is this image Wallace as a custom skin for Luigi on Brawl
---
&gt;Damn wake up and 4 tool boxes... that's overkill..
---
They also used 2 Shroud of Union and 1 Vigo's Shroud.
---
In theory 2 Union means they will spawn in doubles, to put immediately take advantage of Prove Thyself and Vigo's will make one of these doubles spawn away from the killer.
---
Monto?
---
Your score says yes.
---
I haven't had this issue before at all, but it's been happening to others around this time.
---
why it was a mess tho? (i took a break when that event came out and i heard a lot of people said that it was terrible)
---
Hope is actually really good
---
Ah okay thanks for the help though
---
Blood points is so nice when's Its double
---
\&gt;  It didn’t matter how stupid my blinks were. I could find whoever I wanted  
---
Counter-play is the stun after missed blinks. That's the time to lose the killer by hiding somewhere, juking in corn fields, etc.
---
Wake Up is bugged and grants a 15% action speed bonus.
---
I’m not really sure I’ve liked any of them so far. Hallowed Blight completely ruined the game for 2 weeks as a solo survivor, the Chinese New Year did the opposite and punished killers for trying to play the event, and summer barbecue I was too late in coming in to really get into it though that isn’t the event’s fault.  The winter one was OK, though everyone running around with top level sweat gear was really annoying.  I just don’t think this game does events well in general.
---
You can pretty much infinite a 110 killer around a rock with it and it makes a significant difference even vs 115 killers.
---
Why does every skin art look so, out of place. Can you make it fit with dbd not make it so cute and clean. Seriously it doesn't even look like nurse just your narrow fantasy
---
She and Billy are high tier because they can traverse long distances quickly, and due to how stupid BHVR is, that is the only way to beat SWF on ranks below 10
---
Pig main here. I agree that it's an asswhole move to do this but honestly it's not exploiting anything. They are using perks, items and offering to help them do their objectives to the best of their abilities. Even tho it's a dick move it's just the same as a basement camping Leatherface with insidious, or getting 4k with NoED, they are being sweaty try hards, not exploiting anything.
---
I totally forgot about the winter event. I didn’t really play it for the event though, I wanted the trophies and those were fun to play for.
---
Running Deliverance and unhooking yourself gives you an extra 1500 points. If you escape, that would be 6.500. 
---
The remaining points you would need to get through self-caring 5 times (300 points each time) or any other way the killer might provide.
---
Escaping Bear Traps 3 times would be the best scenario as each escape grants you 500 points.
---
Pretty much need that on every killer who is not Spirit and Nurse though, Maybe Hag and Huntress. 
---
Its just bad map desgin thats the problem.
---
Aside from the bad moments it gave, I liked how they did this lore thing Alot.
---
How is it bugged? Is that what it's supposed to do when they released the patch?
---
4 wake ups? Scumbags.
---
Unrelenting has a niche usage, you can very aggressively swing through pallets and make survivors get hit because your recovery was fast enough to catch up before they make a 2nd loop.
---
But let's just say that you shouldn't be missing swings.
---
They’re exploiting a bugged perk, Wake Up, which is currently giving a 15% boost to all action speeds.
---
So in the survivor perspective, using teamwork to play a team game is rewarding. Got it
---
They are exploiting a bugged perk, bub. No way in hell a full squad of SWF would use a perk that allows survivors to see the exit gates auras when they have coms.
---
Hellno, if you're stupid enough to pick up a survivor after they got unhooked you very much deserve to get stunned for 5 seconds. You did it to yourself, deal with it.
---
How is it bugged? Isn't that what the devs intended for it to do when the patch was released or am I missing something?
---
Yeah. I just had a game with brutal strength and got a 4k. So maybe there was what it was. Thanks for all the advice!
---
Well everyone just did the  Visceral Cankers(the survivor sacks) and just kinda killed themselves and you had to play each side to get the cosmetics instead of just playing one I believe there was alot of bloodpoints though like alot.
---
From how the head and hair look.  I thought it was The Spirit.   Great concept tho.
---
Calling it now, dedicated servers will make the game borderline unplayable.
---
Where can I find all the submissions for the contest?
---
You can add me on PSN: Tikay_The_Kid
---
I will plow through those skillchecks and unhook you with Borrowed! (Online atm)
---
Well i may have did to myself expecting that my perk that is *EXCLUSIVELY” for reducing stuns would do something
---
Cidney
---
The Bamboozling comes later.
---
i just browse this sub while waiting for a match lol
---
Also rip to literally everyone who doesn't live near a server.
---
Have you even READ the perk's description?
---
Yea. Hes just an M1 killer, needing to realy on the general m1 killer perks which kinda sucks we cant have any vairty because of the shitty map desgin and mechacines. 
---
Pretty much need brutal, enduring, fury and ruin all the games, maybe bamboozle instead.
---
It’s all over the sub and happening on all platforms I’m pretty sure
---
Use the search bar bruh
---
This is incredible! Looks like its go well with the plague as well
---
It’s supposed to only open the gates 15% faster but it’s broken so that everything is 15% faster which includes stuff like vaulting
---
I'm also glad Sleepy_Thing explained your comment cause for some reason I thought you were sarcastic.
---
As a main survivor, I do believe the killer is the dominating player, which is why I prefer to play survivor, cause I enjoy being vulnerable, constantly fearing to be caught or seen, hoping at the end, if I'm the last one standing, for some mercy. I absolutely hate survivors who taunt the killer like there's no tomorrow, but I do love watching them getting wrecked afterwards :)
---
So the way to balance the game is to nerf. Killers and then survivors... Ok
---
IIRC they banned some people using the double blade glitch from Legion from a combination of in game reports and taking note of when someone increased their usage of the addons
---
however they had also put out a statement saying they would do so
---
Nah, I'm good. It's your own problem if facts seem to hurt your feelings. Grow up.
---
Especially the cutscenes were great and well animated.
---
FR sent. :)
---
Yeah, stop the crouchspamming I'd say. It just comes off as teabagging annoying cockiness.
---
If the survivors are using wake up then no, otherwise yes.
---
You need broken perks to counter broken perks. Likewise wake up is not allowed, unless you go against a legion using the blade add ons.
---
This new balancing is extreme
---
Yep, basically.  The game doesn't always incentivize it though and it puts you at danger to do so.  Risk / Reward, do you unhook that survivor, potentially get chased and downed, or do you leave them there while you finish a gen?
---
I don't think the internet has anything to do with hitting skill checks
---
Yes. Look at my screenshot above.
---
Buckle Up is the fun perk for me. But why is Prove Thyself useless?
---
Mom says you can’t have any desert until you finish your dinner.    While this hex is active, for every (injured/ injured or dying/ injured,dying, or hooked) survivor, 1 random unfinished generator will be blocked off by the entity.  “How can you have any pudding if you don’t eat your meat?”
---
They’re exploiting and they shit all over you. They walked away from the match with your face in the dirt. That’s why I said you should of DC’d. But your playing tough guy and let them get away with it because “you’re not bitch”.
---
No dude, you have little man syndrome and let them get away with their shit and exploiting. So yea, that makes you a bitch in my book.
---
It’s been happening since the update, no perk to cause blindness in any of my games. 
---
Empathy, bond, downed survivors, hooked survivors hasn’t worked at all.
---
oops!

---
I have to admit, with over 1700 hours in game that this is a fact.
---
same thing happened to me yesterday
---
The legion exploit was around for quite a while before devs made it bannable
---
Play as the killer sometimes, too. Learning how a killer thinks will help you be a better survivor.
---
Countless times he’s been dead-center in my screen and pretty close. Still exposed.
---
\*Pc  
---
\*Audio  
---
When playing as survivor and chased by the killer, the terror radius sound/music is very low for me, almost impossible to hear. (Just to be correct, this sound: [https://youtu.be/W9srEt-OxYs](https://youtu.be/W9srEt-OxYs)) This is the case for every game and killer that I have played against the past 20 games. I am positive that it has nothing to do with perks, since I've played multiple matches and have quite a good understanding of what the different perks do. Besides that, I can also confirm that it has nothing to do with my sounds/headset since I have already tried to maximize all sound settings, including the game itself on my computer, just to be earraped by all the other sounds, except for the one I'm talking about.  As you can imagine, this is pretty frustrating.   
---
I can also tell, that this pretty much started after the Ghostface update when he got added to the game recently. I have already tried to repair the game on steam and deleted the game entirely and tried to reinstall it, but with no luck.  
---
The game is pretty much not playable for me since I have a really hard time knowing when the killer is near/chasing me. The only sound effect that I can go on, to know if the killer is near me, is the heartbeat sound.   
---
Any known solutions? I have already tried different things found on forums regarding audio problems like mine, but none of them have actually worked.
---
Lmao can’t tell if serious.

Iron will doesn't seem to be working for me. I'm running Iron Will III and Feng is still making all kinds of squealing injured sounds. Same with Jane.
---
yea that happens to me all the time and it's  not the killers fault.
---
Not that I know of. But the chances of them winning are pretty much the same. Just bank on them being altruistic and you never know. When I swf when one of us goes we all go.
---
No problem :)
---
yeah exactly, this isn't about him being nerfed it's about fixing something that is broken about him lmao.
---
broken as in not working, not OP
---
let the entity fill you up inside
---
One dude said the game "passed away as I learned Nurse". Then you check his profile and he's got over 600 hours and is currently playing it.
---
Reinstalling the game helped with the Pip-Error. At least I got the end Screen as Survivor without Issues. Sounds are still fucked. No Chase Music and stuff.
---
You don't need the 10% progression when working on a gen with someone, as it's faster to work on different gens.  
---
There are much better perks than Prove Thyself, like Borrowed Time, Dead Hard, Botany Knowledge, Quick and Quiet and Hope; you're better off running a perk that can help you in chases.
---
I got crucified when I told a fb group I didnt respect gen tappers

You don't earn deviousness as a survivor, that's a "killer scoring event."
---
You get survival, Objective, Altruism and Boldness as a survivor.
---
So we need a Grass type killer..
---
Which is retarded that a survivor can kill themselves and YOU get punished for that. The ranking for killers is absurd. Survivors have been fixed a bit with this latest update but man it’s a struggle for killers when they 4K and don’t even get iridescent

i would wait for the numbers like will freddy be strong yes but will he be as strong as nurse no just because you can go from gen to gen instantly doesn't mean much because the survivors have a chance to react to the teleport because it takes like 5 sec they said.

just wait we no little and a lot can change just look at ghostface

I got gifted him, so if her gets nerfed into uselessness i'll be sad but at least i didn't waste money on him. As far as his 'bug' he isn't bugged. if he starts stalking you before you seen him and run, he will probably finish before you can expose him, especially with addons. Its a game of rocket tag; whoever shoot first wins. So keep your eyes and ears open and pay attention. You have to exert some effort against him, unlike with some killers.

SwF abusing a a bug, too bad you didn't report them.  Scummy boosted trash.

lol yeah I'll be back if other wise happens but so far I transitioned from my regular xbox to a one x and this is th e first time other than PC twitch streamers seeing this game run a solid flat out 60 fps so it has potential on mobile just depends on hardware I guess
---
It is. Sometimes the skill checks are like 10fps, making impossible to hit a great skill check with accuracy
---
I have great LTE service on my bus commute. Playing dead by daylight on the go actually sounds fun if the controls are ok.

Its always more efficent to to gens solo with Ruin, (unless you all can hit hex checks 100%) Thats the main reason why Ruin is so effective at Re ranks, it dosnt slow down solo gens much but it stops people doubling up and blowing gens in 30 seconds.
---
Teabagging has some serious double standards on this sub lmao
---
Yes i know,but i wanted to play as the killer,my friend as a survivor and the other 3 survivors be random people.
---
Of course. No Mither can counter every insta-downs in the game AND literally has no counter outside of moris.
---
Apart from if a notification like a hook happens on the map, and the game decides just to freeze for a half second just when the skill check hits.
---

---
No pallet around that tractor tread loop...may be unsafe if Killer is stealthed!
---
You know damn well what you did there and you should fucking be ashamed for not giving her the hatch.
---
Oh damn
---
Gg ez
---
*they’re looking, you’re
---
*you’re selfish
---
also no, you can still finish a gen pretty quickly if you just work through the skill checks. better than someone running around like a dumbass for 5 minutes when you could have done maybe 2 gens.
---
I went back and checked, they showed it before the shop opened because we all thought it would be in a skin pack. It was Dev Stream #72 in October 2017, the same one where they showed shirtless David
---
They're very rare but they do happen. I've seen them on rotten fields and the thompson house.
---
Why should i give someone the hatch? If you can't beat a shitty Legion with an SWF group you don't deserve it.
---
Spent 5 minutes looking for anything that could look like Ghostface peeking around an obstacle before I realized the Hatch lmao
---
Oh! The end game build I started running is the following:
---
* Adrenaline
---
* Wake Up
---
* Spine Chill
---
* Resilience/Hope
---
It is not that great, even now with Wake Up being bugged, but it is a fun build for tackling Exit Gates on your own. Still think that Wake Up should be buffed though.
---
thats a mood, wish i was good at nurse, but every time i try i just get destroyed and tbagged. doesnt feel worth.
---
Leatherface is good? Where'd you get that?  
---
Myres and Ghostface are pretty good.
---
All this shows is you being an ass in a unbalanced game lmfao. Sick post
---
Ass
---
I fuck hard with this, especially bc Huntress
---
Kinda getting sick of people complaining about servers when there is no servers. Its all based on the killer as local host that some terrible system deems acceptable.
---
I'm getting games with people in 8+ time zone differences. I had a 3man join all from turkey only to all dc at the same time (I live in western Europe). Matchmaking doesn't properly account for time zones and distance / connection. its infuriating. But the devs aren't gonna waste time to change it either, they're just gonna focus on dedicated servers while people just hop in and out of lobbies hoping that the system  finds a killer with a decent connection to them just like the infinite mending bug, they didn't hotfix it they just left it in until they reworked legion entirely nearly a month later, I Love the game but i'v next to no faith in the developer's vision for the game or their ability to improve it
---
One thing is trying new perks, other is using perks that are too weak.
---
I like leather face so I geuss ghostie is fine
---
I see wake up all the time now :D
---
I feel like that's counter-intuitive unless you have blood warden though.

I think a lot of people t bag to trigger the killer into tunneling them and wasting time.
---
You can add me: DeathTask011
---
I can loop semi reliably lol
---
Whenever ruin is active, I usually go looking for the totem, unless it's a low tier ruin and I'm not cursed, because then it's not my problem.
---
and same should go for splinters
---
You could just make it yourself
---
What they don’t realize is I’ll down them in .5 seconds and hang their friends next to them.
---
Whenever you down a survivor who just got unhooked, you pretty much have one and one thing only to worry about. That's DS, if you can't even be fucked to play around that ONE perk, you deserve it.
---
Fun fact: While writing this comment I had tru3ta1ent's stream running on my other monitor and he just said "I won't pick him up yet, he has DS 100%". For some reason he knew he had to play around that perk and he did, I'm pretty sure you can too :)
---
Lol I had this last night and thought my comp just bugged out. Missed out on a couple slices of gateau AND have to redo a daily. BHVR plz
---
No I completely agree, It's terrifying because I didn't expect it but I just don't understand the mindset on their part.
---
Well, I don't really want to support that kind of build ;(
---
Whats up with Thanataphobia?
---
My problem with a mobile version of DBD is that having your sound turned on is extremely important in this game and I always play mobile games with the sound off if I'm playing them in a public place.
---
Just make it yourself
---
This. Once one person cleanses things can snowball extremely fast.
---
Ok I sent out friends requests. :)
---
It would be too strong then, so no thank you.

---
Im not i cant play around it but it makes absolutely 0 fucking sense that a perk that stuns you isnt countered by a perk that’s specifically for reducing stuns
---
I've noticed when I tea bag. After I get hit and they are ghost face they tea bag me back. It's hilarious
---
This has been a factor of the game since its released, in my opinion I think the killer should just be rewarded more points if they get matched with an swf. If they remove it, people will just dodge lobbies until they find their friends anyway, it's what people did before SWF was an actual option in the game. If it's an SWF, bank of the fact they're going to be a lot more altruistic than solo survivors would be. People are much more likely to go back for friends than they are strangers. I've seen SWFs throw the entire game and get 4k'd because they tried so hard to save their 1 friend in the basement, it's never a gaurantee that the survivors will win. It's a huge advantage yeah, but it's likely not going away anytime soon so might as well learn how to play around it
---
I honestly don't see any reason they can't make the controls work. There's a similar game on mobile called "Identity V". It plays great and it's basically rip-off of DBD.
---
There's also plenty of 3rd person shooters that play great on mobile, like PUBG.
---
I can hit Ruin skill checks by myself, but I get stage fright if another survivor starts working on the gen with me and I miss every one.
---
Wait what?
---
This is why I dropped $5 on him. Completely worth it.
---
I had a similar event, but in a different game. I was playing Skyrim and when I thought I heard loud, thumping footsteps, my heart sped up and I instinctually started looking for a Wraith, before realizing I was playing a different game.
---
I wanna see ghostface punch a survivor to death
---
He also may havr gone to another gen. 2 people work on a ruin gen, especially at the start of a match, is not very productive unless you know you will both hit greats every time.
---
Leatherface and Freddy (Until rework) suck, but the other Licensed are pretty okay
---
I plan on buying ghostface this coming Tuesday.
---
that's true, but its worth the risk especially if they are trying to get them to chase them and not a teammate.
---
I can feel the Hex: Ruin in this drawing. Nice!
---
sure, Regression is good. puts a bit more Preassure out and buffs remember me a bit
---
***NO!*** This is my favorite Killer one so far! Excellent work! I'm sad to hear this.
---
I see it's on pc. go to your library &gt; games &gt; dead by daylight and see if you have your DLCs enabled
---
it be like that sometimes tho lol
---
Ah okay I thought so. Because for me all the pricing is super reasonable and I’m very glad they don’t have any outfits more than 10$ like most games charges $20+ for cosmetics.
---
Third seal though?
---
Next time you get DSd, I'd suggest opening up reddit and making a "DS IS SO OP" post.
---
Should save this and post it whenever some asks "what's genrushing??"
---
That’s why I love my AirPods (insert other headphones here if you prefer). The idea of not listening to podcasts (or DBD mobile) on the bus...frightens me.
---
I thought Sally was British.
---
Wait so the two winners get their cosmetics put into the game?
---
They can't buff it further. 
---
Making it pause mid chase would just encourage killers to run sloppy Bloodhound and moonwalk to you in order to run down the timer. 
---
Making it pause in terror radius would be broken
---
Either way, this the height is the easiest issue to solve.
---
Without ever reading Jeffs backstory, or knowing about a dog, I was thinking to myself last night (while being saved from a hook by a Jeff) that he kind of looks like Keanu Reeves with a few more pounds on him.
---
He moves at 3.6 whole crouched and around 3.3mps while stalking and crouched.
---
Yeah this one looks like her most recent ornate weapon, love the skin though.
---
You still get stunned, it just breaks the pallet. It’s only worth running with Enduring.
---
I never said I was mad. They just played very bad.
---
You blew through six pallets (and only got one stun?) and spent the majority of that chase not looking behind you or paying attention to where he was looking.  How are you using dead hard and not paying attention to how close the killer is to you?
---
At no point when you broke line of sight did you try to just walk in a direction, instead you just kept running which leaves track marks to where you are.  You had a ton of chances to just walk around a pillar and double back when he couldn't see you.
---
I'm not saying you deserved to get camped, but you made yourself extremely easy and rewarding to chase (you wasted so many good pallets that force the killer to break or change directions) but you're just as bad at survivor as he as at killer.
---
As you see, it was destroyed right at the beginning.
---
And the backstabbing after.
---
Im waiting for polish killer that will scream "KURWAAAA!!!" when stunned.
---
I like how the outline looks like a pot bellied chibi Ghostface running to the left.
---
Run self care or Bond  instead of aftercare
---
I contacted support and sent a ticket for the same problem although the solution would probably be different as I'm on ps4. Something to do with refreshing licenses in my settings. Sorry for being of more help.
---
yes myers hous was on the other side of the street
---
Pc - audio
---
In game the heart beat stutters for all killers. And sometimes have very low terror radius without perks to that do so. 
---
Pc - ghostface mechanic 
---
Even when looking directly at ghostface he doesnt break out of his power as a survivor.
---
Pc- hitboxes
---
Huntress hatchet hitboxes are broken.
---
It was his teachable i was describing, maybe it is. I checked his perk in the store and it said 50% but i think those are just base stats
---
That's not true... They've previously left in bugged things that they decided were bannable.  However, they wouldn't make it bannable without putting it in the announcements on forums and in game.
---
Trapper, Wraith, Billy, Nurse, Clown, Dwight, Meg, Jake all in United States but I don't know where exactly.
---
Myers, Doctor, and Laurie are from Illinois.
---
I don't know where hag is from.
---
Huntress is Russian.
---
Leatherface is from Texas.
---
Freddy and Quinton are from Ohio.
---
Amanda, Tapp, and Jane are from New Jersey.
---
Spirit and Adam are from Japan.
---
 Legion, Jeff, and Claudette are from Canada.
---
Plague doesn't have a country flag i'm assuming since she's from BC.
---
Ghostface has had a huge presence in Utah, Pennsylvania and Florida. Mainly Florida. 
---
Nea is from Sweden.
---
Ace is from Argentina.
---
Bill, Kate, and Ghostface are from Pennsylvania.
---
Feng is from China.
---
David is From the United Kingdom.
---
Adam is also from Jamaica.
---
Ash is from Michigan (apparently, don't know much about him).
---
Ngl don’t even know half these flags
---
Apparently her wiki says anglo-american. I always thought of her as just british too.
---
They’re tweaking him based on the feedback they gathered from the latter part of the PTB, I believe.
---
tfw you actually use Wake Up but now it's bugged so you can't :(
---
Small game is like premonition. 
---
Translation: not great
---
This video explains why it's hard to find matches.
---

To put it simple Mat Accidentally deleted the servers he says he's sorry.
---
Oops
---
It worked! Thanks a lot!
---
Except Wraith mains
---
Plague is Babylonian. Babylon was formerly known as Mesopotamia, and you’ll be wanting the Iraqi flag.
---
I raise you one better: instead of no u, use (no u)^(2)
---
Sometimes changing small little things on killers would make them so much better. It’d sure bring him up from D-tier
---
&gt; I brought up that bullshit perk having the longest stun in the game
---
You're right it's fucking stupid it has the longest stun in the game. We should fix that by making Head On a 6 second stun
---
It's almost always better to work on separate gens, ruin or not.
---
Due to being Headless, maybe have an ability that allows him to hide the Red Stain temporarily?
---
I feel like that could be devastating in creeping up on someone or Loop Fakouts.
---
You've been warned
---
And just how are you seeing skill checks AND scratch marks at the same time?
---
Ruin isn’t really a problem for me because I can hit my great skill checks pretty easy.
---
Deciding whether you want to expose ghostface or not since it’s a little sketchy rn
---
I love this
---
Where my small game mains at?
---
How did it go?
---
Same, it’s really not hard. Especially if you have played the game a lot, you get used to hitting them greats.
---
Entity is even a bigger bitch: "Oh, you got 4k and max points? I guess I'll give you 1 pip..."
---
Yeah. I guess that's a fair point.
---
Nah, Survivors made bad plays, then they punished you for it.
---
Choosing to run the perk meta vs the perks you have more fun with
---
I know it's a joke, but in all seriousness, dedicated servers can wait until they're proper. If they push it out too early, we're gonna have the servers we had on PTB, and for the love of god, I would take the occasional lag-switcher or 250 ping lobby over the serverwide ping and netcode they had on that PTB.
---
That's not how it works. Just because a lot of players are using an exploit doesn't mean it'll be fixed faster. It takes to time fix bugs wether you like it or not, so you're still abusing a bug
---
Maybe its 100% - 3% and you end up with 97% ?
---
I use it all the time
---
Oh ok. I might have joined just before they changed it. (I started playing before Demise of the Faithful released) and I only see purple tier ruin so I never found out it got changed.
---
I play Doctor a lot, and I've p3 him. During this event I've let at least one person get the hatch or door every game.
---
They could have one of the victims playing Dead by Daylight
---
We used to do that in Halo, red dot in the middle of the screen when not ADS
---
No, and they don't even stack together
---
From what I understand yes
---
On Desktop at least, the right hand sidebar has an option to customize, it should be in there. You can use a bunch of predetermined ones, or choose one and just type to edit it to whatever you want.
---
Imagine a killer like the clown teabagging lol
---
People not being able to pay the least attention is why every totem and effect gives Survivors little warning tags for all their I'll effects.  This game was way more fun toe when I had to figure out the killer had devour hope by noticing someone got one shot after 3 hooks or that they had ruin just from seeing sparks. :/

Or you know, instead of taking forever and making little to no progress, you could work through the ruin and complete the generator in a reasonable amount of time, or at the very least get better at actually landing those great skill checks.

Wow

It’s all good, man. I thought the same for a while lmao

Gang gan- yeets off chair
---
Would be better if you put rank 20 in both of these guys faces

But it's ok to use the wake up perk yes?

THANK YOU VERY MUCH
---
You'll know it's active pretty darn quick when that Wraith instadowns people outta nowhere with no warning.
---
with my luck i would get the huntress
---
bhvr nerf everything upset the swf groups
---
Player name is Skillz... uses a perk that has a known bug making it far more powerful than intended.

“normies”
---
Uh.. how do you know who you’re going against exactly?
---
there should be a DLC window in properties of the game
---
Yep that is the only thing I'm good at lol
---
Once I'm seen it is over :(
---
I did put normies, it’s just that the r and m look conjoined to look like rm.
---
Doesn't make it a good perk. There is a whole genre of better perks than slippery meat.
---
I dont have Enduring I need to level up Billy for that.
---
I expect the last killer to be Benedict as "the host" or "the entity."
---
honestly I agree. There's this one mod, Sable I think his name is. SUCH a tool like omg. Almost banned me once because I wouldn't get on my knees and suck his dick.
---
Ended up doing it just so I could stay in veterans chat
---
Seriously, don’t know how to play against him.. I just let him stalk everyone else while I try to avoid him
---
No, it's not okay to use the wake up perk as it's bugged.
---
Gg
---
I mean, I definitely feel that. I’m better at being sneaky than anything, but I can outrun quite a few killers. The game still gives me anxiety sometimes.
---
This is a lesson many mmos and Friday the 13th never learned... If there's even a whiff of exploit potential... It's gonna get exploited into oblivion early and often.  Hell, it's a joke on some games to abuse the hell out of it asap, since it takes companies forever to decide its bannable.
---
Where Kate
---
How badass would it be to close it with telekinetic powers? Also it almost looks like she dabs on the Hatch, much like dabbing on Survivors sometimes.
---
Also using your traps with the Hag is camping /s
---
I'd make something with the cancel stun. Billy can simply stop charging it and hit right away, which can be used for mindgames. LF on the other hand, once you press rightclick you're open for abuse
---
The slow down isn't that bad if you get really close to them before you let it go.  Why would they give him an instant down ability with no wind up?  All of the killers with access to that have to meet some kind of requirement, like stalking or charging their chainsaw.
---
It would make him ridiculously powerful if it was instant.  As it stands now you can stack the green tuning guide add on with the yellow spark plugs for a faster windup, plus you have the option of cancelling out of it if you feel like you won't get to them before they get to a window or pallet.
---
Damn, everyone talking shit about you 'abusing the legion bug !!1!1' but I ran into at least half a dozen SWF squads running Wake Up yesterday. No one cares about that though - it's not the survivors' fault that BHVR hasn't fixed it yet :)
---
Thank you for not willingly using an exploit of a broken perks.  We need more gamers who aren't abusive pieces of shit in the world.
---
"This is why we have PTB :)"
---
Idk why people are downvoting, you are right.
---
He didn't ask what GF was..
---
**MENACINGLY**, that is!
---
Nice work! Those achievements are a serious grind for killer, especially at higher ranks!
---
The exploit is using the bug to your advantage.  That's what an exploit IS.  You're right that it's not bannable yet, but if it isn't fixed in the hot fix, I would be surprised if BHVR didn't put up a notice warning people away from using it like they did with legion.
---
The biggest nerf to Shadowborn was making all of the maps incredibly bright where as they used to be incredibly dark. Shadowborn made those maps basically as bright as they are now.
---
Prove theyself stacks so if all 4 run it. Like my crew does. It's 40% faster for each person. I love this perk
---
I got a 4K with her perks last night but i didn’t get a double pip and I was like “why do the devs hate me”
---
Of course it’s cheating. If bhvr hosted a dbd lan and they saw you playing huntress with a cross hair you would be disqualified. But it’s online and I doubt easy anti cheat will detect it. Plus who really cares, so use it!
---
And a killer with 2 perks that hard counter, not including just looking at him for 2 seconds making him a basic m1 is the most OP thing since the nurse.
---
It says right on the well make it perk about the cap.
---
The achievement really should be changed to a 4K with the killer imo. With the weird emblem system, cough chaser cough, double pipping is extremely tedious.
---
Making sprint burst a decent perk again
---
Looks sick as hell. It looks more like Spirit though.
---
I enjoy telling other survivors off when they start trashing a decent killer postgame. More often than not those same survivors are the type to sandbag or hide around the hatch
---
Spine Chill and Object. Look at his chest for 2 seconds then pallet loop his ass like the shitty m1 killer he is
---
Survivor entitlement..
---
when you use it, instead of playing as legion you will play as whatever killer it says. that might be glass splinter so i guess if it is you would be Pig when you burn it. 
---
its like a free-trial basically. 1 use, no perks/add-ons.
---
Realistically you can simply punt Chucky across the map and be okay.
---
As someone who only plays casually and never plays enough to get past rank 10-12, can confirm its actually ridiculous. I don’t play much but I know how to play properly and it’s mind numbing how bad and thus toxic the rank 20-16 killers are.
---
You lose addons and perks and play as the pig
---
Playing Freddy makes you a tunneler
---
Simply because i didnt trace it. I took the original artwork as a template and drew it in my own style, tracing would mean that i just copy the exact same artwork. If you compare the two you'll see the difference
---
You use transformation jutsu
---
Can every killer obtain them
---
I did just that, sent thru messenger then on the ps app on my phone I zoomed in and screen shot it then cropped my phone details out.
---
but thats the main issue
---
thanks . im on mobile rn but ill check it out
---
I've run into a lot of OoO users, it doesn't.
---
Exactly until theres a statement everyone needs to stop giving out false info.
---
And this is when it’s safe to say that some survivors are complete fucking pricks
---
How tf did it close?
---
Now you're staying in tall grass
---
Killers are just upset they dont get. 4k every game
---
He’s speaking in terms of the licensed killers. Pig is arguably worse than Bubba due to the loss of her end game pressure
---
Seems Ghostface really likes traveling especially if it means he can get a few pictures with the locals.
---
But it's doesn't notify the killer since you never miss
---
* *Description:* You can choose to not use Sprint Burst
---
* *Steps to reproduce:* Have Sprint Burst, Hold Crouch, Hold Sprint, Hold a movement key, Release Crouch
---
* *Expected result:* Sprint Burst being used
---
* *Actual result:* Sprint Burst not being used
---
Yeah that will screw you over real quick.
---
It’s referred to as slugging, while most people hate it, it slows down the game and like most of the hated tactics there is a valid time for it, just not all game every game
---
And shitting in it
---
Aw thanks! &lt;3
---
Honestly, I doubt that would do much.  I'd guess the vast majority of people doing it fully expect their potato to actually leave the area in a timely fashion and be slightly sneaky about it.  I mean, this happens even when I'm like 15 seconds behind getting back there.  Any reasonable person would expect their unhook to have gotten out of the area by then (aside from healing). 
---
That might help with people Unhooking dudes in actual eyeshot of the killer w/o bt, but then again, people who are intentionally assholes usually value assholery over points.
---
Exactly. People get so tilted god i wonder what happens when they get inconvenienced in real life lol. I love playing against someone clearly above my skillset because then i just copy what they do and boom now i’m better and i have to play the other side until i find someone better and it’s a never ending cycle of getting better.
---
I disagree, Pig has better pressure in the early game, and Bubba's power barely does anything.
---
Okay, let's be real here. From a conceptual stand point, there's nothing wrong with Ghost Face or his power. 
---
But I've had games where the two of us were practically playing tongue hockey and it still didn't break him out of stealth. He needs a bit of a fix.
---
Ghostface has 2 hard counters (Spine Chill and Object). Looking at his upper chest with the center of the camera will break him out it in 1.7 seconds and make him an M1 killer, easy pallet bait.
---
Lord forgive me for what I'm about to do
---
If you care for the extra cosmetic, get the DLC, if you don't, get him with auric cells.
---
Shut up I’m rank 16 I got the suggestions from rank 2 streamer

Idk I don't think it will fit Dwight.
---
Thank you
---
It’s good for eating pallets. That’s what I use it for.  Using it during a chase without Award winning Chili and Carburetor Tuning is a shot in the foot though...
---
You're missing out on delicious bloodpoints
---
I see your point
---
You gotta agree that it makes you feel faster when you increase FOV as killer tho
---
It's a perk.. it's been like that since the ptb...  if they were worried about it they would've done something about it then... 
---
You're telling people wrong info by saying they're gonna get banned, until the send out a statement it's fair play.
---
i can say that even if freddy comes out too strong or too week the devs will balance around it the only time they didn't do this was legion but legion was broken at his core so i have hope and when we have the numbers and new add-ons. I can say the devs do know were they are doing and the PTB for it should be real soon and we can give more feedback there
---
Have you tried looking a bit above him? From what I've seen, your camera needs to be fairly close to the ground for him to be properly centered, and it seems like I'm staring at the sky behind him
---
It’s a perk: Hex: Lag
---
New killer recently came out, queues are gonna be a little killer heavy for the next few days
---
The Award Winning Chili does almost nothing; you're better off using The Beast's Marks.  
---
If you use the power to eat pallets, you're hurting yourself by letting survivors get extra loops.
---
Ah I’m so foolish
---
I wonder if it was me... was it on the red forest map?
---
Seriously this is game changing. I always use my SB by mistake might actually start using it over Lithe
---
I meant it’s good for destroying them. Not used to stop a pallet loop
---
You don't notify the killer if you just take the regression. If you miss the skillcheck as a whole sure, but if you're doing that you have much bigger issues
---
How many times will people ask?  Did someone got a counter for that?
---
Oh my goodness. I woulda loved to watch that game just to see how fast it went
---
wait... i think feng is for korea, not china.
---
holy mother of ding dong in my pants! 2 votes from this guy for my sweet main
---
I hope they also keep it for survivors
---
* Ingame
---
* Multiple perks not working correctly: Wake Up always active, Iron Will doesn't work, WGLF and BBQ visually bugged, PWYF doesn't lose stacks when you down survivor, MoM does not receive stacks on protection hits, Vigil does not affect exhaustion rate, Devour Hope doesn't reveal exposed status to certain survivors
---
* Visual Bugs: Legion's FF graphic becomes stuck if a survivor is picked up while in FF, the exposed status will not show for a survivor if the survivor manages to reveal Ghostface but still become exposed
---
* Audio Bugs: Chase Music is either too loud or too quiet at random, Female Legion sounds like Male Legion, Billy's chainsaw will randomly have its audio muted
---
* Game Crash: Playing Plague causes the game to crash after the last survivor leaves.
---
* Game Actions: Stacking Legion blades causes survivors to have severely reduced progression and action speeds for ALL actions, wiggle meter is currently bugged at random, locker sounds are are obnoxiously loud
---
* Map bugs: Select vaults on the swamp maps are permanently slow vaults, double pallet spawns are back, school bus vaults are bugged
---
* Killer bugs: Ghostface's face Night Shroud seems to have huge inconsistencies when it comes to its reveal conditions, leading to situations where survivors can be staring dead center at Ghostface and still be exposed without having any opportunity to reveal him. Ghostface's addons that buff movement speed can be bugged into becoming permanent if interrupted by an action during initial Night Shroud transition. Doc's madness tier 3 can bug and prevent survivors from having the option to snap out, causing them to be stuck for the entire game.
---
This is happening on every console I believe
---
This is cute! uwu
---
Man I love using urban. I find it absolutely hilarious to be in a chase, utilize urban to get out of what the killer expects me to be, get some extra distance back and then pop up and point at the killer. I feel like bugs bunny bamboozling the killer with my shenanigans
---
Thank you!!
---
Just hitting space and breaking the pallet normally is better than waiting for the saw to charge and being stuck in the animation.  
---
The only time his chainsaw's useful is for faking a pallet break or zoning survivors in very particular situations, but Billy does it much better.
---
*go play another game* intensifies

This is happened so many times in the last 2 weeks alone....

wooohoooo love it!!

"After playing this game for a while, I can't recommend it in its current state. Pallets are too broken, killer is just too hard to play as, and the wraith is far too overpowered. If the devs nerf/remove these things I could recommend it but for now I cannot"
---
*0.4 hours on record*
---
Not gonna argue with that last point. Billy gang 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
---
Huh? Dude it’s a meme I don’t need criticism on a meme -_-
---
Oh I just noticed, he wouldn't have seen you either if you didn't just start running when he walked past you.  He turned around and saw the trail you left and then began chasing you.  If you hadn't started running and just paid attention you wouldn't he even gotten chased to begin with Lololololol
---
Believe it's now 80 or around there last time I saw the guy counting it was 75 I believe
---
Actually your game wasn’t ruined for that long apparently.
---
Why? It a good thing to kno!
---
Bigger issues like being and at the game?
---
Yes but still identifies as a woman.
---
This wat happens when the killer falls for your pebble for the 4th time. Diversion goat
---
This literally would turn him into a Freddy repeat and he would be a non viable killer that would almost never be played.
---
Watch out make sure that insidious Myers ain’t anywhere nearby
---
I mean it’s generally SWF which breaks the balance, not those perks. Self Care is redundant and you as a Killer can nullify DS and Adrenaline anyway.
---
Brace yourself. SWFs are gonna downvote the shit outta you. lol
---
On topic: no, sadly.  Its just a matter of being quick to check profiles and friend lists.  It'll make your ping tank and if they all dip, you can at least hold out for a group of randos.
---
Lmao, dude, you're funny. Too bad devs tend to listen to those like you
---
It's a little funny that one of their anniversary mottos is "this year is all about giving back", yet for the anniversary activities, they are what, raffling out a whole of six (6) winners of auric cells, the rest of stuff only going to a very limited subset of the community with the artwork and cosplay contests. Oh, and then there's that "exam" that for some reason only included people that finished it in the first hour in the raffle. What are the other 23 hours for? Just gathering more user data, matching emails with accounts?
---
I mean, it's cool there's stuff at all, I'm not really complaining about that, but with a game that has sold millions of copies and keeps selling countless DLC and cosmetics, giving out like 1000 bucks worth of stuff for the big anniversary, to like 50 people total, is not really a "giving back" spirit.
---
And so yes, why only 2 fan-made cosmetics, as well, rather than an entire, actual Collection?
---
5: remove his knife, knife is bad because it hurts survivor.
---
There's been a lot of these. That's one way to combat the 16k average of recent months...
---
I wish the struggle mechanic was cut from the game. You can still attempt escape on first phase, but 2nd phase you have to wait for rescue or die. No more suiciding.
---
Awesome design!
---
Wake up op needs nerf
---
I remember once I was trashing a team despite my mouse sensitivity throwing me off a lot. I took a bit once most of them were dead to pause and change it and swing until it was better, and that delay gave the one or two guys left the opportunity to escape. I got reamed so hard verbally, you'd think I'd missed every hit and gotten a 0K
---
Nothing quite like playing a game to escape reality and instead do chores or something else.
---
i like it but the skull would prevent shaman from her predator's mercy
---
its just annoying dude, i don't like playing survivor, i either get camped or get a tryhard who tunnels when they see a skilled survivor but overall i dislike playing survivor.
---
killer is more fun.
---
Store why not I mean its the same price and you getting more and in case you have someone else is playing your ps4 on a different account they can have ghost face too
---
Its not killer sided at all. The only people who say so are the ones who play solo and suck.
---
haha and what would that be?
---
Wow a post of you bm'ing a 3 man load in to death.  You're a god man.  Not a dick at all.
---
Yeah sure let’s give him even more nerfs after he just came out. Play with him for more than a couple of days before we start suggesting more nerfs.
---
Yeah I didn’t know if it granted an extra cosmetic
---
It's basically just a better version of lithe and balanced now
---
Let's just hope they fix this quickly, I don't want a sprint burst meta where all the other exhaustion perks are irrelevant. In the meantime I'm gonna abuse the shit out of this tho.
---
Oh hell yes I would have gotten my cheeks clapped without my add ons
---
Sorry, I don’t understand you. Did you mean *Devils lettuce hag?*
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Yeah they need to wait till the killer gets to red ranks to gather information if you start balancing for rank 20s then the game breaks.
---
I liked a lot of the events but I'm going to agree with you and say summer bbq was my favorite. I started playing the game around that time, and it was the most fun I had. I was terrified of the killers and never came across the dlc killers, and thought freddy was OP
---
We're nerds on the internet... weren't we ALL bullied at school?
---
Just got the Ghostface Adept today as well, the only difference is that I did it at rank 1 :)
---
Okay thx
---
I already had sprit fury and haunted ground on my build so when I put rancor on I didn’t move them around
---
People who immediately assume you’re tunneling after an unhook are ignorant af. So picture this, someone unhooks a survivor, the unhooker goes somewhere REALLY safe e.g. killer shaq, and the hooked guy goes out in a dead Zone, logically who would you go for?
---
Someone used a key on it and they only stay open for a certain amount of time when a key is used.
---
u dont lose them just they are not used
---
Not saying much but I agree unless it’s a sweaty SWF, I didn’t depip so I’m not mad but it was rough on the soul
---
Until Bubba’s stop face camping every game they deserve nothing.
---
Congrats. Ghostface is cool just I wish you couldn’t reveal him if your hooked
---
Yes counter adrenaline by winning, DS gets me because I didn’t think they’d all have it on, got stabbed thrice

---
Not doing gens but I'm going to say I'm doing gens, you
---
Someone opened it with a Key which leaves it open for a 30 seconds.
---
Nonexistent. 
---
You’ll very very very rarely see a double pallet. And it’s what it sounds like, two pallets on the same jungle gym.
---
Bottom Text.
---
More than most other things!
---
Spreading exploits that give players advantages is a bad thing to do. It's like if someone posted about double blade legion back when it was broken, assholes will now go and use the exploit against other players. It's better to just submit the bug to bhvr and nothing else
---
Dude if you are on here throwing this type of salt at post rework DS that tells me you regularly get ds'd so often that you raged enough to come on here.  If you are getting ds'd that often it tells us that tunneling off hook is a consistent part of your game.  You wouldn't be on here otherwise if this was a rare occurrence from the specific situation you just put forth.
---
15 surv and 14 killer, and that’s sorta my point, is I just get fucked on by kids boosting or in a 4, not really salty just kinda bummed I got slammed thrice by DS and they were all constantly healing when I didn’t tunnel them and I got stabbed when I did, and adrenaline is just really strong
---
it is literally sickening how salty survivors get when the game didnt go exactly as plan. its so bad.
---
Omg that's a scam!
---
Oh, so that explains why I saw someone using it for the first time ever last night
---
It's kinda sad the perk needs to be blatantly broken for anyone to consider it
---
People don't know how to align there point of view on GF is what's the issue especially on low ranks. It's not about looking directly at him
---
So either I tunnel and get stabbed 3 times like I did or I don’t tunnel and they get away and heal, it was also the map with the circular building in the middle, really hate that building, always double pallets in there I swear, but regardless, reaching end game isn’t hard in a 4 man
---
So many cool possible cosmetics, I'd actually love to see old man Myers in the game, that mask if awesome!
---
Idk why you're downvoted but you're right. Like, would it be cool if i went back a month and posted "hey everyone, make survivor's life a living hell by using both blade addons on legion!" No, just submit your bugs to bhvr and don't spread them
---
Pallet vacuums was where a survivor could press the button to drop a pallet before they should be able to and they would teleport to the other side.
---
I very much see Jane in the face on the far left
---
Unpopular opinion: I actually like this hair change and I will wear it with pride
---
Well video games over here cost 100$ and special editions are 150$ I think its technically around the same price as American because our dollar is worth less
---
The Vaccum doesnt exist anymore? Double pallets is a pallet at multiple L or T wall entrance.
---
Oh, ok. I don't really use it, mostly because it's a massive vulnerability until everyone else is dead.
---
Why is he running Whispers on Billy? I swear some killers run some shit builds then get mad when they can't catch anyone.
---
Lmao stupid camping legion. Probably could have caught you if she wasn't bming.
---
The headdress makes me think of the female Vaal Hazak armor from Monster Hunter: World.
---
Nurses lore sucks biggest entities tentacle evere
---
You sir has my mostly sincere thank you
---
On PS4 there are no Bills! But all the would be Bills play as Jeff and do the same thing.
---
I thought he immigrated to the states?
---
People saying DS is non existent if you don’t tunnel need to stop. People are using DS like a kamikaze mechanic knowing they’ll have to either be picked up or slugged (some even pairing Unbreakable with it). It also rewards just being a shitty survivor and being a 2nd chance perk.
---
Does it punish tunnelers? Yea sure. But it’s also much more than that.
---
Playing killer is frustrating as well
---
Lmao was thinking this today after playing survivor a few days because of the Killer queue times.
---
Quentin has joined the Brotherhood of Assassins...
---
Me and my partner joked about naming it Deaths Stench Haha, we're playing a lot of MHW lately!
---
she's Chinese.
---
They're just sharing 🤡
---
You got dem booty pics now. Your life is now complete.
---
Not a bug, there's just no mask included in the outfit.
---
but whispers is amazing on billy. this killer is just shit at playing killer
---
I mean, it would fit the Plague. She apparently smells like shit according to her lore. Great design btw, Vaal's my favorite monster.
---
I just don't think it's all that strong. I play survivor as often as I play killer and I've yet to even see somebody even use her. I'd be willing to bet she's the least played killer in the game right now.
---
I wish more people ran Kindred so that I'd know if someone else is running for the unhook.
---
So that's why my BBQ keeps stacking at 3. I thought they nerfed that for some reason.
---
He's so annoying to fight if you dont have stuff to counter his stink, but the armor is so worth it.
---
Preach! That gets super annoying, ruin is effective simply because survivors waste so much time trying to find it
---
It should be tho
---
I just played the game normally. Bill commited suicide and they were doing nothing the whole game
---
As a survivor main, Ghostface is extremely balanced.  I can get him out of Night Shroud from over 20 meters away. You just have to center him in the center of the screen.  
---
He brings actual nerves back to the game too. Like i have never had more fun as a survivor.
---
Nothing about tunneling a survivor for multiple minutes and blowing the game will teach you to be better.  Your logic makes no sense.  That's the gameplan for a killer who has no idea what they are doing.
---
If you truly want to get better you'd practice decision making in chases.  It is vital for a successful killer to know and understand when to commit and when to abandon a chase.
---
Down me? 
---
#I AM NEA
---
Lol ... why disconnect though? 
---
In case you haven't heard, killer lobbies are backed up.  /s
---
I'd have done something ...
---
Rip Frank.
---
Definitely the most balanced it's ever been, but regardless, the general hierarchy in this game goes:
---
1.) SWF
---
2.) Killer 
---
3.) Solo queue survivors
---
But is it written by Wes craven?
---
This actually wasn't so bad. Pretty good video honestly.
---
I believe it was Blackwater Swamp? But I did DM the Killer and tell them how great it was, so if you didn't get a DM, then it wasn't me. I think what also makes it so good is his beautiful flowing mermaid ribbons. Just everything about it, I love.
---
No mercy.......
---
Ok I was kind of a dick, I tbagged just for the salt but how many survivors do you see tbagging everytime they feel safe on the exit gates ?
---
it really depends on luck, i once did a whole gen without getting a skill check and i once made a gen go from 25 to 0
---
Ah, no I didn’t get any DMs, I guess it wasn’t me. But yeah, I love that as well, ghostface is great.
---
I have only leveled Claudette right now. Not really into playing survivor much as I always have a bad experience. I used to play the game a lot more and it occurred less but then again we are in free play weekend right now
---
I got a 3K but had to remember where the gens and stuff were, that was hard
---
Not a bug, it just uses the default mask.
---
Makes sence
---
OP? He's a M1 killer lol. His power is the only thing he can rely on to assure some takedowns and it can be countered easily, especially now that they're gonna nerf him by giving survivors a higher radius to take him out of Night Shroud.
---
Yep really changed I mean survivors are even being really kind by taking time out of their day to message me. Isn't that sweet
---
The report goes right into the trash can, reports do absolutely nothing
---
Oh wow, real respect for killer mains for putting up with that crap.
---
I switched to spine chill recently, only to realize it doesn't help if I keep looking the wrong way. I mean, there's a reason I still use premonition/spine chill. It's called "I'm a blind idiot."
---
Whispers is one of the strongest tracking perks in the game.
---
On Billy it's even better because your insane movement speed while chainsawing helps get even better information out of it.
---
I dont understand why people entertain this shit. Just block em and move on.
---
So on the subreddit home page click the three dots in the top right. Choose change flair and click edit in top right. Then change one of the flairs to what you want.
---
Im not? Im asking what the punishments were, thats it.
---
Well until then, you are labeled as trash.
---
If they gave everyone a ban who said something toxic, the game would be dead
---
If you can't handle people calling you names and cussing you out, you shouldn't be on the internet tbh. Just turn your messages off (Console) or ignore the post game chat (PC) if it's that irritating to you.
---
Oh yea killer mains gets insulted alot on PC but its way worse on console because they need to go out of their way to message them and when I see that I get added to a group I always assume it's hatemail or I've been reported for something stupid
---
I hope you’re not serious right now about 1 not insta hatchet
---
You move a little faster when the exit gates are powered
---
This is Chernobyl-level toxic swf. Holy shit.
---
That’s pretty much the only situation where I would suicide for the other person. However, if I’m put on my hook and the other person is hiding in a locker and they immediately just walk to the hatch to wait for my death, I will struggle to the end.
---
Im not saying a complete ban at all? Perhaps a small punishment like not talking post game for 5 games or something
---
Thanks I really appreciate it
---
This has happened to me a few times now as well it’s ass
---
Its the internet. Probably nothing.
---
Its not irritating, im asking what the punishments are??
---
I mean they are low level killers so yeah I would imagine they care more about one kill compared to the objective, that's why they are low level ranks.
---
Just start knocking out totems there's 5 per match. Swf helps.
---
You asking for karma? because that Pig earned you an upvote!
---
Ew wtf is that his actual face in game?
---
My beautiful eyes
---
I'm not saying that does not happen, but it happens much more in "bad" ranks
---
I can feel your hatred, but please don’t be one of them.
---
Bold of you to assume I don't know people who are horny for him.
---
I know many. Too many.
---
NOED only pisses me off when I feel really entitled: but I have to remember that the games not always about escaping, and usually you pip regardless if you do or not if all generators get done and there’s 2 hooks saves. 
---
With that being said, I don’t think a totem tracker is a bad idea, it actually sounds nice! But I don’t know if the Devs would ever include it because they might think that it tells to much: NOEDS whole shtick is you don’t know it’s a hex perk till the end of the game, and if the killers running ruin it might further incentivize survivors to ignore gens (slow down the game) just to clear ALL totems.
---
There are none. For the exact reason I stated. You can easily just ignore it.
---
Lol i made a typo, meant to say “were” as in what were pallet vacuums cus they got removed
---
I've had the game crash immediately after loading in with Plague too.
---
Lol true that is the downside, plus say you're in the game you're near one of the drops from the first floor to the second, itll go off even if they're upstairs. Good positioning in an ever changing world can be hard to find
---
I agree with that, obviously not what I was doing
---
Yeah
---
Even good players miss checks sometimes, but before you worry about ruin/great checks you should worry about hitting regular checks first
---
I'd buy this and I don't even play her lol
---
I can’t break him out. I legit had a game where we were in a chase and I was staring straight at him for 4-5 seconds and I still go exposed
---
Yeah, you were actually trying to help before you got spotted. Sorry the Claudette was salty.
---
Didn't know that BHVR is developing a particle accelerator, too
---
Were they ever thrilling? I mean I always felt like it was more Dawson's Creek than Nightmare on Elm Street.
---
I can for sure see that second name lol
---
Get ready to play against sprint burst on demand a lot more often now that this is being posted online :)
---
I used to run but when I got 1 hook regardless several times I lost hope 
---
But yea ppl who run kindred are angels
---
That's why you just take the regression until you get closer and closer to hitting the great checks. Overshooting is much better than undershooting. These are all lessons people would avoid learning if they gen tap instead.
---
Legit can never break him out. I have stared directly at him, middle of my screen, and he still exposes me. Its very wishy washy, and its too much luck right now.
---
I play mostly survivor but if you want to understand why NOED is almost necessary, play some high rank games as a killer. Those gens pop so fast especially against SWF.
---
The issue, from what I can tell, is that your own character will block line of sight.
---
That is, if you are not crouched, the survivors head swollen by their massive Galaxy brain, blocks line of sight and this prevents breaking him out of his ability. 
---
That's all that needs to be tweaked in my mind, rather than making the area to spot larger enough to spot him around walls (which, based on the patch notes, seems to be what they're intending on doing)
---
You just gotta get the hang of it lol at first I couldn’t but now it’s the easiest thing ... I kept following this one ghostface and kept breaking him out 😂 he kinda just let me follow him since he couldn’t catch me
---
You release she’s a granny and she’s dead right..
---
What rank are you??
---
Hang of what? Putting the camera on him? I did for seconds. I see it happening to me a lot and it won’t break him out
---
You're not wrong / bad for using any of the functions in this game, no matter what anyone else might say.
---
Now, you might not be liked, or might be inviting salty messages, but if you're okay with that, then slug away.
---
Personally, I only slug the 3rd survivor to bait the last survivor after the first two die, just to keep them from getting the hatch. 
---
Otherwise, I hook when I can. You get more points when you hook them multiple times.
---
There is no point in making new cosmetics for Claudette...they all wear the Blendette outfit...
---
What a lovely piece! She's definitely a difficult lass to draw.
---
Like he wasn't already too cute. 😍
---
Your obviously doing something wrong..if I can break him out really easy then you can to you just need to learn how instead of complaining to the devs begging them to change it
---
Doesn’t happen often. I just stated that the change to enduring wasn’t necessary imo
---
Everything is balanced in the game, everything. Ghostface is as good as you play him, same with any other killer, you just need skill with them.
---
That's generally how it goes.
---
It's a small thing but this irks me every time I visit the store. I don't remember ever seeing these items **not** sold at 10% off. This looks like a clear cut case of misleading advertising. I remember there being a controversy in the gaming world surrounding Christmas cosmetics coming out at 50% off. The conclusion was that you can't call it a discount if it never went for more. Anyone remembers the actual case?
---
Basically he’s a little broken
---
"FiX yUr GaMe"
---
-0.03 hours on record.
---
I always thought they'd make him jump to compensate for his lack of size.
---
It's 25% bonus BP per unique survivor hooked, up to 2/3/4 tokens
---
I myself played too little
---
As a matter of fact, yes, I do.
---
It's 10% cheaper buying the full outfit instead of just the pieces.
---
If you buy the pieces individually its more expensive than buying the whole outfit at once, the 10% is the saving you get for buying them together rather then individually
---
So if you buy each piece separately, it’s 400 auric cells. 
---
But if you buy them together, it’s 1080. 
---
Use your math knowledge and you’ll find an answer.
---
this nerf wasn't needed since the time you lost by giving free hit to the killer you don't even win it with mettle if it activates.
---
Maybe Pinhead
---
Jesus respawned remember?
---
Ace mains rise up!
---
I don’t think she’s innocent at all. She’s definitely had the darkness in her for a long time she just needed a frank to direct her violence. I mean Joey seems pretty violent and she was his friend, I don’t think she would have stuck around for lists and lists worth of mischief if she didn’t like it.
---
Wow. They are really failing at communicating that clearly. When I see this screen, the initial reaction is "oh look, it's on sale, or so they would have me believe". Maybe I'm the only one here, I worked in marketing for a decade  before I changed career so I've become very cynical towards that kind of stuff.
---
So truuuuueeee
---
I would delete this because this makes you look like a dumbass
---
Wake up lieutenant
---
That's was actually insane
---
It is definitely not communicated clearly that this is a discount for buying 3 pieces together, the way it's presented leads one to believe the outfit itself is discounted (as compared to the outfit's usual full price, not items sold separately).
---
If I see a pack of 20 batteries at 50% off, I don't assume it means "50% cheaper than buying 20 batteries individually", you know?
---
Except if ur the Hex King
---
Dude how this company hasnt made a hotfix and disabled that perk until it's fixed is so fucking baffling to me
---
So instead of walking around he would be skipping?
---
What kind of insecure twat is scared of looking like a dumbass once in a while?
---
You’re really dense, huh?
---
I would say no but thanks for asking, your concern is appreciated.
---
Unrelenting tech Pog
---
I really don't think you understand. MORE THAN HALF of the games survivors get are camping and tunneling killers. If a killer decides that they're gonna camp and tunnel you, you're screwed. And then you get a depip because of it. Comprende?
---
I said I’m lazy lol
---
I read Nurse but my brain sees Plague
---
I don't play this game nearly enough to hit greats, despite being rank 2 I still just go look for ruin, worst case the killer chases me and I loop him while other people do gens or find ruin.
---
Why the ellipses? Legion is like C tier at best.
---
[Me every match I play](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bhcixh/day_76_confused_oink/)
---
Oh your right. Didn't think about that.
---
Shame
---
bUT iTs rAndOM!~
---
That's why. Quitting vs legion means you really fucking suck
---
I never complained to anyone, never contacted devs, never begged for a change. All I said was that I’ve had games that it didn’t break him out when it should’ve
---
Here you can find all the punishable actions and how severe they are punished:
---
[GAME RULES AND REPORT SYSTEM](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system#latest)
---
Chat harassment / offenses is probably the easiest behavior to ban since it only takes a quick look at chat log. Never forget to report them, no matter how "little" the offense. Worst case scenario, it creates a history for that player and when he does it again, devs will have a different look.
---
FUCK NO. My heart couldn't bear it. Leave the pupper alone!
---
The killer is I'm the power role. They are suppose to make the game go how they want.
---
Ds has the longest stun time in the game, which is no longer reduced by enduring.
---
They just increased bp gain and pip gain by being chased.
---
After you get off the first hook, start looping the killer if you cant get away. Give everyone time to do generators.
---
And I rarely get camping killers. Once I got past grey ranks, they really lessened.
---
Tunneling Is the survivor equivalent to gen rushing.
---
It’s crazy to think that just there, discounting the Jake and David cosmetics as they can be bought  with shards, there’s over £35 worth of cosmetics.
---
Check my edit
---
Thanks for the tip! 🤙
---
Help pls my graphics card kind of just died:c
---
Damn, another bug in this game, haha. Sweet.
---
I agree, however apparently survivors are also supposed to turn their player heads instead of keeping them glued on a generator when they spot him so maybe that’s the case?
---
And easiest issue.  
---
Adding dragging capabilities, and hooks that lower and rise.  Those are harder than just adding a small killer.
---
Check my edit.
---
I don't m8nd and you don't even have to credit me :)
---
And all three other survivors reported both you for working with each other
---
Contact Microsoft
---
That's all they have to do to make him good. Just remove the slow when he charges the chainsaw, if not slow him but not by a large margin
---
No...
---
I think it's more like Assasins Creed DBD edition.
---
I didn't realize it was cheaper buying it all together until I looked at the price of it when you buy it alone. They don't really say what it means so you're like "why is this cheaper than getting it seperately"
---
I did check his add one however there was no indication of him being able to decrease his terror range, in all aspects I think he’s pretty balanced I just don’t understand fully why I can’t detect him as well, someone commented that it’s because you need to have your character physically look at him, which is quite interesting.
---
Wow how good are you
---
I snorted milk when I read the last line.
---
Naw just like just have it as like his power or something. Maybe he can jump onto survivors and start slashing at them but also use his jumps to get ontop of things. Maybe he can also jump from one survivor to another to spread out the pain.
---
hi
---
Thanks for the tip! When you say centre with screen does your character also have to be physically looking at him?
---
RIP Carl
---
I apologize for any damages and/or inconveniences this may have caused.
---
Had someone accuse me of wallhacking when he was injured in a locker on top of concrete and I had Bloodhound on.
---
Your character need to be looking him (the model) and he needs to be focused, which means in the center of your screen
---
#insanely cursed
---
No one mentioned it? Alright
---
Upvote for not using wake up
---
There’s no way Doctor, Plague, and Devour Hope will be bannable. Shocking people as Doctor has a really important use (preventing Survivors from vaulting or dropping pallets), Plague gets points from vomiting on objects, and Devour Hope used to be a game feature at one point and can be discovered using game knowledge.
---
Only a fellow console main would understand. However it seems that the way to properly counter him as mentioned by replies in this thread is to centre him directly on your screen, so I assume that’s how he can be countered.
---
that extra 2 percent speed \*chef's kiss\*
---
Sorry, can't hear you over this gnarly 90s punk-rock soundtrack and sick grinds.
---
Rank 1 plays
---
What’s on sale?
---
Not his terror radio is the telescopic lens and one other lens reduce his detection range from stealth I feel it’s on the level of double blade add ons with legion and aren’t actually supposed to do that since it can make it go from a few meters around him to the equivalent of a hug being necessary
---
Killer is has and is still becoming better and better though. I'd say killer is in a good spot now
---
Looks like a good plague outfit to me, I imagine the nurse as being blonde for some reason 🤔
---
His crouch speed is way too fast. It's too hard to break him out of stalk. Plus when in a chase you can't even focus where you're going because you have the camera aimed behi d trying to break the stalk

I think hes fine now. Not the best not the worst. Feels pretty mid tier atm but can still 4k if played smart.
---
If you think I need one hour to write that comment, maybe I'm not the extra chromie homie here huh?

---
She was friends with Julie before joining the gang, not Joey.
---
Julie also hesitated during their first murder, but Susie was the only one who verbally objected and refused to willingly stab the Janitor. Frank had to physically overpower her and force her to stab the janitor.
---
Susie may or may not have been a delinquent or a bad seed before joining the Legion, but she was definitely the most innocent out of the four.
---
His crouch speed is 3.6 I believe or something like that but besides that I agree.
---
*hiding in locker*
---
#DUH-DUH-DUH DUUUUUUH!
---
Shards for days
---
Honestly, the instaheal wasn't even needed. If the kate would have kept healing, legion wouldn't have been able to pick up the meg.  So when Legion has to attack the kate they both crawl out while she wipes her blade.
---
&gt;Technically BHVR has said nothing about it yet so it's technically not bannable. 
---
Read the ToS
---
I can hear Quintin now being drug off by the huntress screaming nooooooooooooo!
---
Yeah, mobile is not that bad. This will play good enough.
---
As a Noed user I got to say, Noed is fair. You just have to open one of the gates and escape and it does take some stealth and some planning and that’s where most survivors fail.
---
This actually happened to me I played the game too much and started to hear a heartbeat and see red scratches on walls
---
He isn't nearly strong as people say, if you want a medium tier killer, go on, he is a fun killer to play as and against, but don't be super confident in a 4k every match.
---
He did but I think a double flag like Adam would make sense since he also is from Africa. 
---
Also the Hag is from Africa as well, they state that on her wikia page. I don’t know if this is enough evidence to change it but Lisa is likely from West Africa due to her practices of vodun, the use of the terms “rituals” and “village elders” and all of this in relation to the fact that they live in the Forrest which West Africa is densely packed with.
---
lol, of course
---
Imagine a bug where you can't open the exit gate after the hatch get closed 😂
---
I will see survivor get upset cuz they don't get 4 escapes every game
---
Like when Dead hard was bugged and a certain someone showed how to escape without doing gens, was so funny!!!!1!!2!3!432!
---
Your logic is perfect
---
PS: read ToS
---
*Confused pig noises*
---
Checked. I'm on PS4, so it's definitely not a problem with consoles.

---
If a killer that does not have map pressure and as surv you can do all the loops to him needs to be nerfed, then what is left for nurse? should be removed from the game and all the nurse players banned lmao people these days are just beyond my understanding
---
Am i missing something?
---
Dang. Alright thank you for your help!
---
what's this from?
---
Sadly true
---
Infinity war.
---
DBD is half off for the weekend, and is free-to-play for the weekend as well. But on the page advertising this, the comments are toxic as fuck.
---
Hope it wont be Freddy 2.0
---
It is.
---
Read the ToS before saying such things
---
I think we can infer through physically appearance that Hillbilly is from Alabama.
---
I’m confused how mettle of man works now
---
He’s mad he didn’t get all his BBQ stacks lol
---
They’re about to nerf him. The “Slightly” in those patch notes really makes a huge difference. Only perk worth in his teachable pool is Tremors, but you can just use ruin.
---
That’s really cool, I’m so jealous!
---
My idea is this:
---
Make DS only be active for around 20 seconds after being unhooked. If you get downed within those 20 seconds however, DS remains active until picked up or healed up. Stun timer reduced to 3 seconds. Now activates whenever unhooked, meaning up to two times.
---
What markers do you use?
---
Am currently working at walmart to get through college alive. We have so many pallets. Sometimes they put them up like the game. I force myself not to drop it. Maybe on my last day though
---
Ah yes, the classic “Pallet gender swap” stun
---
lowers the chances of it to be the right key
---
In this game it's nothing. Try to pull that out in any other online game
---
For example, league or siege, then tell me how it goes
---
Ah okay that makes sense now
---
IMO a really good Dead By Daylight like game for the phone is Identity V. The game is really good and is what got me into these type of games.
---

**ba dum tss**
---
Seriously though this guy's so salty I thought I was watching a sealife documentary
---
This seems like a normal 1 person left match to me o-o
---
It doesnt.
---
It's been a while since I've seen them. Isnt that the movie where they get a call and have 7 days to live. Maybe she could curse a gen, chest, or totem and if a survivor trips her curse then samara can teleport to the survivor at a time of her choosing
---
I mean, they're nothing compared to tombstone.
---
If you want to have fun, yes, if you want 4k every game then you have billy and nurse in pc
---
Xbox has some... interesting survivors
---
2 isn't bad if you guys at least sometimes got the great skill check. 3 is a nightmare though
---
I've had more fun with him than any other killer so far. No he's not invincible, but he's just great fun to play as and against.
---
Yeah, I like the idea that ghostface have a perk that turn him from medium tier to a top tier, but there's no payoff, with the current addons, ghostface can expose you faster than you can spot him, and the detectiom range makes that you need to be licking his sado-leather boots to spot him
---
This happened to me in a game I played yesterday. I was playing killer and the survivors managed to open the gate so I tried to get one last survivor, but when I got there there was a guy just running around outside the exit gate. Is there a reason why this is happening?
---
They should have prioritized rank rewards over dedicated servers, it'd have encouraged players to stay in ranks they belong it and help with queue times for those ranks

Good points, agreed. I think they should buff a lot of weaker killers like trapper, freddy and leatherface
---
Not exactly , I’ll be running away from him and turn my camera to look at him while running away , and break him out of night shroud
---
you’re abusing a bug, its equally as bad as the wakeup bug and i hope u get banned tbh 🥰
---
I was waiting for the “dooong” disconnect noise lol
---
Programmer? Lmao, it’s a monkey on a type writer
---
So did I. But I bought 5.00 worth of cells then bought him ... It was a mistake
---
OOf madame Blossom. One of my favorite nurse ones.
---
"Sorry sir.."
---
#"IT'S MA'AM"
---
This was purposefully introduced last update. Listen for the heartbeat or move your camera in order to find out if the killer is near you. This does not make the game anywhere near “unplayable” like you say, and in fact adds to the horror and scare factor of the game.
---
Still better the current DS tbh
---
Almost nobody would get to activate it if was just 20s to proc it
---
Can someone catch me up on these abuses?
---
Oof ouch my carbohydrates
---
Pls tell me you t bagged the killer all game
---
I have ruin tier 1 and gens almost never get done

thats hella sexy bro

It'll be taken care of this chapter, like real soon, when they release dedicated servers. Hang in there......unlike your survivors XD
---
Swindled. Fleeced.
---
I had the same healing bug, could only heal after dropping my item (it was a purple med kit).
---
The prison did not check him..btw..and yes after 2 gens because survivors need to learn thats life is tuff
---
I hope so lol. It’s been happening every other game now
---
The healer I believe was still injured from the save. This might have saved up but they might have died instead. Maybe not but it was the guaranteed option
---
Dude no it’s fucking black hole level toxic, that’s some Hawking radiation level asinine
---
Wake up is bugged and it speeds up repairing gens and certain adons for legion make it so you can’t mend it just puts you in an infinite animation until you stop but then you bleed out so it’s easy to just slug everyone down
---
The Hostage taker perk is mostly for maintaining pressure and rotating on survivors if you have to break chase. It basically ensures that you have zero downtime from finding a survivor to downing one. I had considered adding a small exposure effect like on Iron Maiden, but I didn't you to be encouraged to break chase to try and activate that, it seemed like it'd be encouraging some weird gameplay. It's also an anti-stealth perk, so I didn't want to make it too obnoxious.
---
Delusion could have been 1 large time sink, or several small time sinks. I just find that one fake gen that you have to identify is more interesting than having tons of gens that you just have to clear. Even 64 gen charges (80% of a gen) wasted is a huge delay for a perk.
---
As for the tormented survivor healing, I'm not sure what you mean by that. Be my Victim doesn't injure survivors unless they are Blessed, at which point it will injure or down them. 
---
You would use Be my Victim on a healthy survivor, and inflict them with torment if you hit them. Then they'll either Betray, which will stall the game and give you some added pressure. Or they'll become blessed, at which point you can use Be my Victim to injure, and then down them. You should be very powerful in Be my Victim, similar to Legion, the survivor will just have a small chance to hide from you. That's not too bad when you're just tormenting them, but if they become blessed and can be injured by it then it becomes possibly a very easy down.
---
Everybody immune to that shit perk lol
---
I think DS should be more strictly against hard-tunnelling, and the 60 second timer gives it more utility than that. On the other hand, being slugged out of the timer is undesirable, so it's a compromise.
---
I agree it woupd be very cool! I hope this gane keeps going for years and they double the amount of killers :)
---
What movie is this from
---
Wake up is bugged and causes all actions on survivor to be sped up
---
Legion's blade addons are bugged and cause all survivor actions to be slowed down
---
I think that might be either Megs or Aces Lobby pose
---
Banned or suspended?
---
It's edited to look like the Elon Musk meme, or at least that's what I tried to do
---
Before i popped the gen one of the two players had key and escaped after getting the unhook.
---
banned,, from the comments it seems you use it just bc someone is a swf. its kinda shitty
---
Kind of but how many people slug? I rarely do myself if gives me a nice snowball, otherwise I won't.
---
60s are fine since if the killer actually look for new hooks won't get punished but it will if he tunnels someone. It's in a good spot tbh, plus the next time you get unhooked and he tunnel you, you can use it so
---
Well those both sound painful to play against lol
---
That perk was a good idea, sadly it’s broken
---
Well those both sound painful to play against haha.
---
I am not talking about nerfs , ghostface his power is balanced. There just are games  where you are being chased and look directly at him and he does not get detected. No nerfs, just some issues fixed with detecting.
---
You should have just taken a picture of a pallet for easy upvotes instead of whatever this is.
---
I’m actually fairly new to the game so I haven’t personally experienced either of these bugs but I hear from the Reddit that it’s really big right now
---
One of the people had a key and left before I popped the gen. I thought it was obvious, so I didn’t explain it in the title.
---
I actually think it's perfect. Decent counter top hex builds that run thrill of the hunt but not exceedingly good because 16 meters is relatively short. Great perk idea
---
Tell him to git gud
---
Hag is american I think
---
Looks so similar to someone.. I don't know why, duuuuud...
---
Well if behavior is working with Netflix now then it would probably be a Netflix ip such as the demogordon from stranger things.
---
Wasn’t that removed/bannable?
---
I'm level 46 and a circle with an 8 on my screen is that good?
---
*Frank Noises*
---
Yup yup, don’t do it and get caught
---
They’re just those types of killers. Campers, tunnelers etc all seem to have a mental deficiency that effects them so they can’t have fun.
---
Hell, i play nurse and wraith and actively stop myself from camping so others can have fun. Its just common curtsy
---
Haha. I try, but sometimes I cant help but want to keep stalking. I hope it doesnt get nerfed to the ground with the patch. Doesnt sound like it will but mew never know. I want to main him
---
I played as Mettle of Woman for a while and got a lot of shitty comments about feminism
---
which was like, not even the point
---
Babylon was knows as Babylon. Babylon is a country name and Mesopotamia is a region name ;) It literally means "country between rivers" and the rivers are Tigris and Euphrates.
---
Texas Chainsaw Massacre
---
He's.not the best killer but he's still better than most imo. Either way, he's hella fun to play as.
---
Plague already says kurwa
---
Younger than 19 is 18
---
Slippery meat is overshadowed by deliverance in every way.
---
That would reward tunnelers and campers. So no, that's a bad idea.
---
Who you callin pinhead
---
I don't think you quite understand friend. If you have some spare time, take a look at this random clip I found from TODAY. [https://youtu.be/Gfe5aLidk5M?t=219](https://youtu.be/Gfe5aLidk5M?t=219) Listen to the sound. The music/sound of the killer is easily heard in this clip, BOTH the music and the heartbeat. I can't hear this music in-game, I can only hear the heartbeat - so no, this is not a "purposefully update" which got introduced, this is a bug. I don't have a clue what tf you are on about to be real with you.
---
Yep until they patch the glitch that's what is going to happen.
---
Hag is American IMO
---
Oh fuck yeh this is the shit, KILL ME, NOW!!!
---
Its not that its op. Its cuz it would look to much like scream
---
The default FOV is 87 degrees, which is pretty damn good.
---
But you're right about "twitch killers" like Nurse and Billy. I remember now hearing about Shadowborn on Nurse, and how having your FOV change would fuck up your trained hand-eye coordination.
---
Welcome to the club
---
at least they didn't use the sprint burst exploit at the same time
---
Survivors shouldn't be punished thát hard for doing the objective. Noed already does that.
---
PS : has anyone noticed his new title?
---
nah but I admit I am bad, but still happy I got the achievement over and done with

No how is it broken?

Dead Hard could still be used to gain distance to a pallet or a window, prolonging the chase by a very long time.  
---
I agree with Sprint Burst being the best exhaustion perk, but Dead Hard is not even close to being the worst; Lithe and Head On aren't nearly as good as Dead Hard.
---
nah that would make the game ridiculously unfun as killer

Deceptive email with the subject line "Dead by Daylight Vanilla" got me all excited until I open it to find I was not invited.

OP NoeD but can actually be prevented by doing totems, you don't do them and just gen rush? Should be punished. Wake Up is the exploitation of a bug to gain an unfair advantage and everyone I see using it is being reported because that's actually a thing you can be reported for.
---
Sidenote: It should be labelled as Shitpost, but given your name, you're probably too braindead to realize.
---
I dunno. I find Monitor and Abuse way better on Paint Brush Freddy. ZERO TERROR RADIUS outside of a chase turns you into Mirror Myers on crack, and by the time survivors realize you're chasing them you can get the hit in. 
---
Try Red Paint Brush with Z-Block for a 3 second dream transition with a Lery's Offering.
---
While they do know that, he shouldn't have DC'd. Come dedicat d servers, that shit ain't gonna fly
---
hold crouch
---
hold sprint
---
hold w
---
release crouch
---
now you can run around without using sprintburst and have it on command when needed. imagine sprint burst being usable like dead hard, but without the need to be injured
---
Oh right, managed to get both perks out of it on a lvl 50 character. Dance with me and Solidarity
---
Do you need everything spelled out for you? I want discussion about the topic.
---
Myers. Ghostface seems fun but haven't played him yet.
---
She said 16 is her rank
---
It’s not entirely new, [here’s](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/applaudedapollo/video/76252218) a clip from 05-09-19 of it happening
---
Leatherface for BBQ &amp; Chil, the double bloodpoints effect makes the perk worth it.  
---
For me, the most fun DLC killer is the Spirit.
---
It is on pc as well
---
Ahh i see there was a poat earlier aaying his bloodweb was broken and wouldnt level him up when he didnt even buy 1 of the items
---
I just didn’t think you were stupid enough to actually believe this was a discussion. 
---
Appears I was wrong. Reddit surprises me everyday.
---
Now I'm thinking of saminations
---
As cool as this seems, it's going to be absolutely devasting for killers.
---
there's nothing to discuss about wake up its people abusing a bug to thier advantage
---
There's a nice chapter in this bug :)
---
I'm kinda new to the game. Just wanna know if Freddy got buffed since then, or not?
---
I think the pig is a really fun, simple starting killer, and you can t-bag with her
---
I do the same thing except I use it and I start running when it’s 99 percent back up. Does not feel much different than doing it that way
---
Lol OP seems like a troll. Why would rank have anything to do with anything. He’s either a troll or a little kid trying to flex his survivor skills
---
Oh wait, he’s serious, man I’m sorry for your last brain cell, it deserves a better host
---
In rank 12 and it takes not too long to find a lobby it takes me five mins
---
Since when is Rank 12 a 'higher rank?'
---
Idk about cross-platform play, but they have mentioned incorporating cross-platform saves.
---
Oh, I didn't know about Small Game, but yeah, I agree with your suggestion to make Small Game a tracking perk with a longer range but less reliable than Bone Breaker, I think both perks could be good options to a survivor that is trying to break totens and traps, like the same way Balance Landing, Dead Hard and other running perks can be good options to a survivor that is trying to run from the killer. Thank you for your suggestion and for listening to my idea
---
And machine gun build, and machine gun hatchets, and ruin and BBQ but those haven't been touched yet thankfully.
---
I forgot all about Head On; it’s definitely the worst. But saying DH is better than lithe? LMAO
---
Is the blade add-on still around? I thought it was fixed a while ago.
---
wow thanks. Just played Killer and had a Meg that always did that. Thought she had it ready when needed, but apparently she abused the bug.
---
Nope.
---
He's been left in his nerfed state since a week after release and has been more or less unchanged until now, with his rework around the corner.
---
They are doing a battle pass?
---
What is the wakeup thing
---
Spirit if looking for power, leather face if looking for convenience.
---
the exploit
---
Which is?
---
Thank you! I'm not sure if you could tell but I love horns
---
Actually, not right now, it doesn't.  But when it's not bugged, you're right.
---
wake up is bugged, where all action speefs are 25% increased (i believe)
---
Scream movie
---
Yup. Free version and paid version.
---
Dead Hard has a much greater payoff than Lithe if used correctly.  
---
Try using it to gain distance instead of making the killer whiff.
---
Irrelevant, given those were intended effects at the time and we're discussing bugs.
---
How dare you?
---
You won’t be calling me a loser when you’re getting camped in the endgame, and I unhook you so I can Deliverance and DS the motherfucker back to the campfire.
---
Deliverance has allowed me to save scrubs from the basement in the end game where they would normally be left to die, and I will not stand for this disrespect!
---
What advantages does it even give you?
---
In capable hands, dead hard is far better than any other exhaustion perks.
---
My teammates run around like headless chickens even when Ruin isn't up.
---
Yes, I'm talking about using Dead Hard with either or both of them.
---
that's how it's meant to be used
---
honestly glad those aren't the actual add ons seems useless
---
So do I report killers for not dropping me when i hit my DS and it doesn't activate? It’s exploiting a bug.
---
do I have to wait to use the code?
---
I believe it's +15% to like everything, repair speed, healing etc.
---
I mean it would be a separate cosmetic with white instead of red I would wear it with the standard mask
---
Yeah normally she gets them fairly quickly. It seems a recent issue
---
I would if I didn't dump all the bloodpoints I got to prestige 3 my ghostface
---
baity
---
Instead of only letting you open the exit gates 15% faster it lets you do all actions 15% faster
---
Nobody can challenge the ghostface teabag
---
Yea. Aiming a mouse is really hard for disabled people and children I guess?
---
I dunno, I haven't played him much but I think he's like Myers where even with the addons (I tested it with Myers) you still slow down to a crawl once you actually begin stalking a survivor, making the addons a bit pointless unless you want to run around in stalker-mode all the time to find survivors. 
---
I kind of wish we got the older versions. granted you could just use Sloppy but there seems to be other stalking movement speed addons, maybe other addons were also changed.
---
You have pleased the entity
---
True but pig
---
First tbag
---
Dumbass
---
And yet we have no shirtless Myers
---
Yeah, no thanks. I’m not going to waste a perk slot on a useless perk. If there’s no pallets nearby, it’s useless. At least you can use Lithe at the start of a chase, giving you a head start.
---
Wake Up speeds up _everything_ from repairing gens to cleansing totems to healing teammates.
---
Yeah they have the license for the mask thats why they have it. They dont want to take any risks making something that close to the scream robes
---
He's okay but not powerful it's just that most people still can't play against him
---
Badass!! Hag mains are proud!!
---
Had a killer who was tbagging as ghostface and tunneling. Figured he was salty because I looped him for so long. Turns out he remembered me from a game about a week back where I complained about him being useless and not doing gens. The fact that he remembered my name and held such a grudge was hilarious. It took me forever to remember who he was until he referred to that comment. He was shocked that I didn’t remember him.
---
To him the day I criticised his gameplay was the most important day of his life, but for me it was Tuesday.

---
The devs specifically said you can't report someone for dribbling to avoid DS.
---
Once I had a lobby of 4 baby Dwights
---
That switched to their main characters with toolboxes and anti hook offerings as soon as the game started, then it crashed.
---
I think the entity was trying to save me from that game.
---
I got a group of survivors today (Ranks 8-10) that didn't realize you could be hit through windows. That was a doozy.
---
Had that happen to me too, couldn't recover or use Dead hard either AND couldn't escape through the exit gates (I was able to cross the exit gate boarder and was then ultimately sacrificed because of Endgame collapse lol).
---
Is this a reference?
---
Lol I know that survivor he is a wannabe bully.  Super soft too.  He has dc'd against me for getting downed multiple times.
---
Eeek!
---
I refuse to tbag unless it's a scummy killer. Had to deal with one who tunneled me off the hook solely. I smashed that shift button at the gates
---
How would nurse do it though? The woman literally floats
---
When all gens are completed a Dull Totem is lit to become a Hex Totem. This grants a Movement speed bonus to the killer and makes all survivors downable in 1 hit.
---
When you blast someone's grammar but obliterate yours in the process.
---
So you're saying if you're in a dead area, DH is useless? Lithe is pretty useless in that scenario as well.
---
The father death robes are also owned by the same mask company that made the mask so they could just get the license there. But seeing as a tattered raincoat is not father death robes then I see absolutely no reason besides it would be hard to see.
---
Yes....yes....goood.... this is excellent
---
Pretty much. Soon as last gens pops, noed activates and insta downs. As well has i believe u get a boost in speed or haste.
---
So, I was chasing a fully healed Meg. My power was almost filled up, as you can see, but I couldnt drain her aura anymore. Sorry for the title being confusing
---
Lol it doesn’t even activate at all at the moment for me. What an awful update this has been.
---
Shut up
---
I'm looking at the scores here right now and wondering what kind of clown wigs the dipshits who DV'ed you are wearing right now.
---
What a wholesome use for Deerstalker
---
I love The Hag! Awesome work!
---
Nope. I don't go for the unhooks. Too risky
---
It's 5/10/15% depending on the perk's tier.
---
Happens to me every fucking time.
---
Killer leaves me slugged with DS. When I think they’re about to pick me up in time to use it, they break a pallet instead. I’m sitting there screaming “NOOOOO!” as they walk over and DS runs out.
---
Every fucking time. Always a pallet break.
---
If the survivors cleanse the dull totems it doesn't activate though, so whenever you see people complaining about NoeD it's because they don't do totems. 
---
Never listen to these people.
---
But I wouldn't call it bottom tier. When it works it's great
---
No I mean DS doesn’t work at the moment. You hit your skillcheck but.....nothing. No stun, you don’t break free, they just keep carrying you.
---
Isn't it an act of kindness though?
---
You dont.
---
They said in a q&amp;a livestream that this is only the beginning of hair/cosmetic updates. So fingers crossed!
---
I don’t... risky business for my decrepit reactions
---
Cool. But make her blonde pls.
---
I'll defend it's use as a perk day in day out, but maybe people who run NOED shouldn't be the first to call other players shit.
---
Same with ghostface but maybe more cameras or something
---
Now that I have a good computer, I hit great euin skill checks more than regular, at like a 5:1 ratio
---
Have you seen how fucked up the horse is??
---
Only in our dreams
---
For when you really have to 1 hit down survivors
---
For fucks sake yes
---
They'll ban the Legion abusers, but the Wake Up abusers won't even be reprimanded. Calling it now.
---
I see a lot of people try to treat him like myers and try to hide behind stuff to avoid stalk. You need to look at him and cancel not try to avoid the stalk. Even then though if they cancel it they are still looking at you instead of running.
---
You just got whoooooooshed ass fuc if you serious
---
I havent gotten accepted or denied yet and tbh I'm worried
---
As long as they don't camp or tunnel, they'll have nothing to worry about.
---
too right hahaha
---
This, same. I always get great skillchecks on normal ones. But with ruin I sometimes mess it up for whatever reason, and with the way the game has changed lately I greatly prefer to be stealthy. So I gentap so that I can’t possibly mess it up.
---
Dude you’re clearly doing it wrong. Getting Gf in the center of your camera clearly takes fine motor skills and 100 hours against him to get the muscle memory right. You cant expect to be able to do something as complex as centering your camera on him overnight.
---
This was an idea I wanted to get some feedback on, thanks for watching!
---
"it's over Freddy I have the high ground"
---
I was denied too.
---
Hold on doesn’t normal fast vault is 0.7 sec?
---
I love how the Spirit closes the hatch, I feel like she has the best animation for it. The Hag is a close second for me, I always picture it as her grabbing the hatch and closing it instead of smacking it shut
---
Lol its funny to see the babykillers having their ego boosted by NOED.
---
Did someone say....OINK
---
That's not how it works. Tormented and Blessed are conditions that are separate from health states.
---
You use be my victim to make a survivor tormented. They are now healthy and tormented, be my victim won't do anything to them. Attacking them normally will injure them, but not make them blessed.
---
If they stay tormented for 30 seconds, they become blessed. They are now healthy and blessed. They will stay blessed until they betray, or until they are hooked.
---
If you use be my victim on them now, you can damage them, at which point they will be injured and blessed. If you do it again, they go down. If they heal, they'll still be blessed.
---
You're right that a confident survivor doesn't have to betray if they think they can juke the killer during Be my Victim. But it should be very hard to do so, so they'll have to consistently outplay him or he'll have a very easy injury and then down on them. Even if they heal after every be my victim, that's a lot of pressure you're getting for a very easy injury.
---
I love how NOED is OP, but adrenaline, sprint burst, dead hard, and currently Wake Up are all ok.
---
so you just guess, and waste a perk for like a 5%
---
I dont know if youre new to Mike but each survivor only has a limited amount of evil you can stalk off of them before you cant stalk them anymore. Also this image doesnt really tell us anything lol
---
Sorry my editing program doesn’t do that. Sorry I can’t fit your needs.
---
Oh good point I never ever thought about that
---
Imagine if BHVR just decided to go out and ban everyone exploiting the legion infinite mending with no warning. 
---
Imagine the outrage at BHVR
---
“I only use it for the speed dude”
---
Rank 12 isn’t rank 4 swf is though
---
Congratulations, you are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive, but not you. Not anymore. Game over.
---
Had similar the other day. Killer dorsn’t leave the hook then cries about being genrushed and how we’re all cunts.
---
Maybe if he didnt sit around the hook he could have applied pressure.
---
I went against a wraith who accused us of hacking because when all the gens were completed, he was standing next to a gen that no one was working on, and when it turned on when the exit gates were powered he assumed someone was invisible working on that gen.
---
I know how he works. I've been a Michael main since last year.
---
I understood that reference
---
Ash Romero?
---
Using dying light. Brave man
---
\*happy and friendly oinking\*
---
I wouldnt look so seriously into my comment. Was just saying that shit is broken on both sides right now. It’s a royal fuck up.
---
*sexual oinking*
---
You got two kills which is considered a balanced game. What exactly is the problem?
---
You look like an idiot, regardless. Congrats.
---
"Oh hey, look, I can be a total fucking moron, but totes push it off like I'm sooooo cool."
---
Good job.
---
Whats the point of this post? Theres 0 information here lol
---
A really great idea but I can tell a lot of survivors would want this nerfed to high hell.
---
Yea but it did it so that it could see.
---
Yeah, the guy wasn’t running either of those. I remember him running Ghostface Caught on Tape instead.
---
What, nah dude when its disappearing
---
Okay cool, thanks for the help dude!
---
What I saw was she focused on the body and not the mask a lot of players found out you reveal ghostface quicker when you focus your camera on the mask not body
---
P3 Claud, toxic try hard who’s gonna try and make my life miserable, most likely to DC If downed first 
---
Pizza Dwight, chill player who is just here to have fun, most likely to joke around in the match
---
Devs can't even get killers to play as killers.
---
Is she playing as Killer?
---
Which Jane perk is broken?
---
Hope you get permanently banned ^^
---
I’m falling he’s falling I have no way to counter mid air he shouldn’t be having full control of his weapons while falling that makes no sense you’re not going to be falling with a shotgun in hand trying to shoot somebody are you no you’re gonna have the barrel straight up
---
Yeah, Dwight’s are usually the most laid back imo
---
so he's broken in a bad way?
---
It would be a floaty bow
---
Play Huntress for a bit so you learn where the middle of your screen is. Not being a dick, genuinely trying to help.
---
*Insert Pretty good Job so far meme here*
---
And I was just really unlucky to get there just as it closed lol
---
It's insane. Clearing pallets with green ping and I'm being hit. Not sure if it's how they intend but its dang hard to evade him
---
If I see a Tapp I know I am playing against a Saw fan. So I know there will be a BIG plot twist when I catch thm, like they got 15 DS's ready or they have an insta heal. They never do but I always expect it because I am prepared.
---
I usually check to see if they're steaming first, then close stream. I think stream snipping is pretty lame.  I like a challenge, not a free win.
---
Remember-no Quentin’s
---
Because there are four survivors. So when you get a truly powerful perk like old DS or MoM, it breaks the game when all four run them. Also those perks which were clearly broken have set an unrealistic standard for perks.
---
Same applies to killer perks too. Ruin and NOED are still the biggest game changers.
---
Their like: I want to play a game
---
imagine stepping in your own traps.
---
This comment was made by the Oinkers\_
---
yeah i don't understand why people cant do gens and look for the hex at same time.
---
Aight found a new bug that’s pretty weird, if Legion gets pallet stunned while in their power while lunging through said pallet (I got the hit, don’t know if that matters) it keeps the frenzy marks and red marks from the pallet stun on screen until the next time you frenzy. Fun stuff.
---
So far I’ve never seen the clown or leatherface
---
I had two hours this morning before work and legit only got two killer matches in lol. Cleaned up my XBL friends list while I waited.
---
I play Tapp almost always when I go survivor. One time I looped a killer for 5 gens and then dropped a party popper around the corner as the activated the last gens and gave me poised I then ran into a locker with quick and quite and head on. This guy was looking for me for 30seconds before he checked the locker and then I head on him and run out. Always expect a pro move from a Tapp or you got plot twisted (pictures)
---
[Rancor target didn't leave right away and got Mori'd.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/budpyg/one_punch_freddy_in_action_meta_of_man_user_gets/?st=jx6nwb9t&amp;sh=f21be399)
---
I was running the One Punch build during the Mettle Of Man meta. I hated the perk but I realized if you ran this type of build, you can ignore the obsession the entire match (So max save the best for last stacks, free play with your food stacks when you do find him and let him escape) and never have to deal with MoM, Dead Hard, Instaheal, etc. if you simply one-shot them from Healthy, and the Mori means you never have to worry about them being rescued.
---
The day MoM was accidentally revealed I told my friends it would get nerfed, it was a no-brainer for sure lol
---
it was a VERY heated moment
---
If this isn't a skin at some point, i'm burning everything to the ground. Even the ground.
---
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
---
If this post was not made I would have forgotten Wraith was in the game.
---
I like the sound of this
---
Clown plague and Freddy
---
You know the killers are controlled and gave powers by the entity plus is a fantasy/horror game and you wanna apply real world rules into that world which is a videogame on top of that???PLUS using a fire arm as an example when everyone use a melee weapon, like what?
---
Dude, please.. think more than 5s before posting
---
Still only gonna play it if I can transfer my progress. Not spending another 900 hours just to catch up to where I am.
---
If you don't want to be hit in the air then don't be in the air, moron.
---
Ranks 20-5 are killer friendly. Ranks 5-1 are survivor sided purely due to broken map tiles, meta perks, and 4 survivors who can optimise it (even more so with comms).
---
I’m always Wraith! You might be my victim someday 😂
---
Constant updates with game breaking bugs every patch.
---
So you’re going to swing your axe chainsaw mallet etc in the air 🤣🤣🤣 yea fucking right
---
Machine Gun hatchets and the Machine Gun Build were two perks/add ons that intentionally stacked, but when they did stack they were too powerful and the community called for a nerf, and they did it. It wasn't the result of a bug.
---
Not if I oink you first...
---
Boohoo killer main
---
I never thought I would open the post expecting op to follow it with, "Jk I think it's broken and the Devs need to fix this pronto", but no, you're dead serious. That bug is a blight and if you're resorting to that then go play Fortnite and suck there too.
---
I see Freddy, Plague, and Wraith very rarely. I feel like I see Freddy more often than Plague. 
---
I see Doctor extremely rarely too and as a former Doctor main (I still play him sometimes but not obsessively like I used to, where Doctor was pretty much the only killer I played for hundreds of hours) it shocks me (Pun not intended) even at lower ranks I hardly see him given his stereotype of being an excellent noob stomper. 
---
I actually see Clown more often than I see Doctor.
---
I swear I see Clown in at least one match per day
---
Didn’t work for me I went back and forth and nothing
---
I mean, the entity is a hell-of-a drug :p it shaped The trappers mask from bone. I think it can give the killers a little help where they need it. The hag has barely any muscle or skin and she's getting by just fine
---
I like how someone is already dying too lol
---
I mean.. they're kinda right though. Even though I'd say it's more 'copied' than traced it's basically an offical artwork which is re-created with just slighty different details but not in composition at all.
---
Yeah, by the time I thought of doing that I ran the timer out unfortunately.
---
That sound you made at the end was one of pure agony
---
No you're cheating *Kappa*
---
Well then... glad to know this didn't just happen to me
---
I've only seen Plague 3 times overall.
---
Killer mains are triggered
---
yes
---
&gt;yes, they have a black splinter for micheal, bone splinter for the cannibal, and a shock splinter for doctor. There is more but thats all I know.
---
Splinters for original characters have been completely deactivated: Doctor and Hag. 
---
Splinters for Licensed characters can be found in the bloodweb if you don't have said DLCs: Cannibal, Myers, Freddy and Pig.
---
In his corpse paint outfit he’s basically just wearing a wig since so much of his hair lifts up just showing baldness under it
---
It was obnoxiously loud before. I honestly like it the way it is now.
---
Being told your a "dogshit killer" after a 4k..... my brain just cannot compute the logic behind that.
---
I’m assuming he means Head On, which only works 50 percent of the sodding time.
---
Those were killers getting punished, though. Survivors don't get punished.
---
So the DLC splinters are still active?
---
While your at it make there hit boxes even bigger
---
Excuse me but shirtless myers...
---
I played the game back when it first came out, and the music was one of the things that made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. It made the game thrilling. After this patch, that's all different now, and I can barely tell how far away the killer is from me.
---
Leatherface for his perks and spirit for fun/best killer on console
---
Well...keep in mind...those 2 "kills" were people around my rank
---
scooby doo
---
For me they are usually chilled, that sucks
---
Let's start calling a killer Freddied when he gets nerfed immediately
---
Wth is going on with the lobbies? I just started playing again and I only play killer. Was hoping to try ghosgfave but both times I’ve tried I’ve waited half an hour. It’s never been that bad before. 
---
I play survivor sometimes with a buddy and we played 5 or 6 rounds and immediately got a match every time.
---
&gt;So the DLC splinters are still active?
---
Yes but only if you don't own the licensed DLCs up until Pig. 
---
Apparently Ghost Face isn't getting one.
---
You'd be surprised. I had survivors contest that "it's not gonna happen" when I'd bring up the subject of MoM needing Something done to it.
---
A rhetorical one. I was hoping you would realize what I was trying to imply there but oh well.
---
If you looked around a bit, you would have seen , that quite some people asked about killer queues . This has nothing to do with ur ranked 20 surv play . It gets better if you rank up.
---
Dunning Kruger effect at it's finest
---
In my opinion yes, everything takes skill, I mean it does seem unfair at some points, but idk I feel like it is
---
Well a lot of fans like me think it's good..
---
I figured it’s between the blood hunt being over and everyone playing as Ghostface. Too many killers in queue and all the occasional players crawling back under their rocks now that the boost is over.
---
Ugh, I think he is more good looking than David. Such a daddy bear.
---
the first scream lol
---
F13 = Semi-annual updates with game breaking bugs every patch.
---
Exactly! If you're always garanteed a win then there's no risk or excitement!
---
Ah damn I didn’t have time to play during the boost. I just wanted to check him out since I bought him earlier.
---
Just to be clear, I am not flaming you at all, I'm just confused about what you are talking about. Secondly, yes, I see there has been an update on audio adjustments for the chase volume, BUT it still doesn't explain why the chase audio is MUCH LOWER in my game. Here is a clip from TODAY, (specifically 10 minutes ago) from a random streamer on twitch [https://clips.twitch.tv/ScaryThoughtfulAlbatrossKeepo](https://clips.twitch.tv/ScaryThoughtfulAlbatrossKeepo) he is being chased and his chasing sound is MUCH higher than mine.
---
Its currently a big sonetimes re hitting the exit hit detector will let you escape sometimes not
---
My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at meeeee
---
Some maps I can’t see any auras at all.
---
Sadly it's been like this for a long ass time. I usually hit the red ranks in 1 sitting when I actually can get games back to back but then I eat shit from that point on when every human being on the planet mysteriously vanished while steam says 13k playing lol.
---
Going from console to PC feels like taking off weighted training gear when it comes to hitting greats. The needle doesn't skip and it's just much more consistent. Even with only goods though, that's still more gen progress than doing nothing, and it'll still get done.
---
Entity Deceased.
---
WRANG ANSWERS ONLY WHAT MOVIE IS THIS FROM 😂😂
---
It’s on both. I think most console players are just a lot more casual and less likely to hang out on reddit/the forums so they don’t hear about it.
---
Its always one guy that stays on the gen and gets insta downed.
---
Yup.
---
no
---
Pay attention survivors, that is where the middle of your screen is.

I take this opportunity to remind you that there is a subreddit dedicated to the leaks of the game and of which I am admin, if you want to join, this is the link:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/)

I hate it now. It's so quiet it's not fun.
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight.
---
That Happened to me yesterday I put it on my snap and said I was level infinity 😋
---
It's weird because most games past rank 6, I get taken out of my stealth regardless of where I'm hiding. People on hooks can reveal me through small cracks between walls and trees. Also, I sometimes don't even get to see who and where I was revealed.
---
One suggestion I saw was to make it so to disable a hex totoms you have to take a skull from it and take it to an altler to turn it off and the killer id notified when the skull is taken.
---
that's not how you leave constructive feedback
---
Pretty much this. Endgame builds in particular are probably the most confusing thing ever bc you are hedging your bets and getting stronger the worse you perform. It literally crutches out wins when you don't deserve them.
---
I wonder how they all reacted when doctor came out?
---
The Nurse’s true origin revealed
---
I just dislike how ruin is basically a must and it’s found so easily
---
Dwight wants to know your location
---
Except Noed is literally a "I fucked up time to get free downs" perk. How are the SWF players fucking up?
---
From my experience
---
* The games I have won with 3ks no ruin is because people don't look at me, and I'm an aggressive Myers stealth type of guy and some don't even bother to cancel it in chase where I benefit a lot from it. 
---
* People stand on pallets and don't run away.  With some loops you can go stealth mid chase, drop your Terror Radius to nothing and walk around a corner they aren't expecting with no hint and get a hit. 
---
* People suspect I don't have ears and can't hear them doing a Balanced Landing nearby but they still don't run. 
---
* They don't heal or try to go for unsafe unhooks. 
---
The games I've lost Survivors did the following
---
* Looked at me and broke my LOS see often as possible turning me into a basic bitch m1 killer. 
---
* Actually ran instead of standing at downed pallets, giving them more time alive by a CONSIDERABLE amount. 
---
* If slugged would actually heal who I slugged or unhook when I'm evidently killing somebody else. 
---
A lot of it is staying mobile and not letting him mark you, if you get marked and don't find him fast you might as well stand ass up and bend the fuck over, hands on ankles and pray he goes gentle.
---
Or he's just looking around for Survivors
---
Maybe if the post gets enough attention but i wouldnt hold my breath xD
---
Common sense would say yes.
---
Doesn't the entity give the killers powers? im pretty sure Wraith wasn't bing bonging when he killed his boss.
---
It’s always great when someone like Michael with T3, a Spirit (no not phasing I swear) or A Pig (THE MOST COMMON!) suddenly turn into a Nurse, but them sometimes instead of them blinking it’s me that does. It’s me, I’m the Nurse. They just reverse Nursed me. 
---
***table flip***
---
Ok... but it still is the majority.
---
Mom and Ds were reworked. Adrenaline is an earned perk whereas Noed is a free perk. And BT is meant to punish toxic players. 
---
I don't see the comparison
---
You can cleanse 4/5 dull totems and still get hit with Noed. 
---
Killers have to lose the gen game in order for NOED to go off. 
---
Tell me what's more fair here
---
Usually I think it's just someone doing dailies or someone who's new to the game. Camping is incredibly weak and you're essentially throwing away the whole match for 1 kill if survivors know what they're doing and just do generators. The only time you can't win against a camper is if it's Leatherface because... That's all his power is good for.
---
Typically I'll see Killers around rank 20 going against red rank survivors who have low rank friends so they can match against easy killers and Bully them the whole match. Then they send messages or post game chat to insult the Killer.
---
This community: 
---
&gt;NOED is OP because totems are too time consuming to find.
---
Also this community:
---
&gt;Totems are too easy to find. 
---
I am konfusion.
---
Please, don't complain about Ruin and BBQ, you just make fool out of yourself.
---
Playing as: Survivor  
---
Bug found on the Yamaoka Estate map that would trap the survivor and the killer. A certain type of hill with a bamboo shoot would allow the player to get wedged between the hill and bamboo. Killer was able to get stuck as well. Have not retested the consistency, I will get back with that.

It's against the killer rulebook. You can't run exhaustion perks or else ur toxic and deserve to get facecamped.

Yeah but people always end up saying it’s the devs being lazy and just saying “cuz the entity”
---
Got a 4K against a SWF with her today. Beautiful Drawing!
---
Were you playing against a plague or huntress?
---
And you complaining about a perk that literally can be destroyed in the first 30 seconds of the match and another perk who literally has 7 ways to counter it isn't laughable ?
---
It's official. The entity must be destroyed.

---
I agree with what you said, totally. Like when Dead hard exploit gave you the opportunity to run out of the gates without any gen done.
---
I would instantly say, even a banner saying "X is bugged, don't use it" to then avoid punishing innocent players. I knew about wake up here and now I know why I see many of my team mates use it and it's sad
---
Still, there are tons of people in this very subreddit that thinks that's totally ok knowingly abusing a bug until they say so and I would punish them immediately if I worked for BHVR. Even posts about how "it's finally more fair" talking about this
---
People who abuse it knowingly and totally ignore the ToS saying it has no power are laughable and deserves a perma ban, no questions asked since they already stated how they know it's explotive and don't care. I'm against THOSE kind of people, not to the ones who uses it because they like it or trying stuff out and by mistake (maybe not even realizing it) get an advantage
---
That's why I'm pretty rude to many people about this, because many thinks to be entitled to abuse a bug until they don't say so. If I worked on BHVR would have an account just to find out their in-game ID and perma ban them even BEFORE the official statement since they are cancerous for this game and instantly abuse a bug to their advantage as they know how it works
---
I would totally do that. They are lucky there isn't somebody that thinks like me or you as I can see, that works in BHVR or they would've been screwed right now. But knowing BHVR and their mods in the official forum, I know they won't. Especially about the latest ones who deserves to be fired instantly
---
See what? I don’t get it.

---
Going to kill myself over all your mean words😭😭😭😭
---
You only had to say it once bud.
---
Not even julie...
---
&gt;I would instantly say, even a banner saying "X is bugged, don't use it" to then avoid punishing innocent players. I knew about wake up here and now I know why I see many of my team mates use it and it's sad
---
No I understand. The dead hard bug. Infinite mending. All of it is shit and exploiting it does merit a permaban. 
---
The only thing I don't want to happen is for people to innocently use the perks not knowing it's bugged, and get banned bc they just so happened to be in the wrong lobby with 3 other bug abusers. 
---
With infinite mending, I would have banned everyone who even touched the add ons after publishing the statement no questions asked. But I can't say 100% for certain that "XxN00BZTOMPAHxX" is the same "XxN00BZTOMPAHxX" on Reddit that's telling everyone "if you combo filthy and nasty blade you can give Surviviors a potentially 10 minute mending timer."  But if I issue a warning that says "if you use this ur ass is grass" and they use it, I don't need to defend myself against people proclaiming they never knew about the bug exploit and were just innocently playing around with add ons. 
---
It's the same thing here. I don't want people getting banned when they didn't actively try to exploit Wake up. That's why I'd do what BHVR is not fucking doing. 
---
Issue a warning. Tell them "you will be permabanned if you are found running this perk outside KYF until we give the all clear in game, on social media, and on the forums that it's safe", ban everyone who doesn't heed the warning and tell any detractors or banned players to shut the fuck up. They violated the TOS and were even given a clear warning multiple times.
---
Yeah, I hadn't noticed until halfway through posting, but they was salty anyways so it's OK.  LUL
---
Instead of saying it over and over I would love to hear your explanation as to how he endorses camping
---
This post gave me a stroke
---
But they already fixed totems - remember? They were pretty high on themselves about coding totems to spawn in out of the "direct" line of sight of survivors. Problem solved - totems are soooo much more difficult to find now. Said no one fucking ever.
---
This is like me saying that my lawn needs a ton of work, and the lawn guy simply turning on the sprinklers and patting himself on the back. What the fuck does that do. The lawn is still fucked up.
---
Likewise, BHVR, beginning a trial out of sight of survivors doesn't do shit especially when the totems still:
---
1. Spawn next to gens (A guaranteed to-be-seen spot).
---
2. Spawn in front of hooks (Another guaranteed to-be-seen spot).
---
3. Spawn out in the open (Rinse).
---
4. Are lit up like beacons and can be seen from half a map away (Repeat).
---
5. Only take 20 seconds of holding one button to cleanse, no skill required (Re-Wash).
---
3. Are cleansed after 20 seconds, no skill required at all.
---
I'm All Ears : your idea would literally be a nerf at this point, IMO. 
---
Thrilling Tremors : just reduce or remove the cooldown and increases the blocked gens time to 24 seconds.
---
Furtive Chase : it should reduce your terror radius all the time, not just in a chase.
---
XD
---
Yeah to DBD parody 6 by Samination
---
Didn't nea move to America so technically she USA and Sweden flag
---
The killer called them shit while using NOED to kill them when the exit gates are powered NOED boosted the baby killers ego
---
Hes adorable
---
I will say this. 
---
2 blinks is fine. 
---
3-4 blinks is op. 
---
But 5 blinks is actually like... stupidly bad. Like it's Leatherface levels of bad.
---
DS is better now, IMO.
---
Understandable with the names; there's a lot of them to remember in DbD's lore. 
---
However, I disagree that *pre-existing* 'darkness' is a requirement to be a Killer. The Entity chose Rin over her father not because she was more evil or had done worse things than he did, but because it thought she had more potential then he did. 
---
Susie may or may not have always been a bad person, but I don't think that being 'dark' is a requirement to be chosen as a Killer. 
---
&gt; Maybe it’s just another case of the lore and the game telling two stories
---
Almost definitely this. Maybe we'll see some of the gaps filled in by the Archives whenever they arrive.
---
That Ghostface is from Utah.
---
He needs to practice hitting skill checks. Also of you miss with ruin stop repairing the generator until it stops sparking. This stops double skill checks. Also If he hits a skill check rub his chicken
---
I just wish they removed the aura thing now that it's much harder to get.
---
Mostly but I've came across a few kinda douchey Jeff's
---
What is w the equivalent of on console/controller?
---
Please nerf all mid tier killers, op
---
fuck yourself
---
Killer tunnels &gt; omg fucking try hard killer stop being a dick
---
Killer doesn’t tunnel &gt; gg ez bb killer, how do I turn up bot difficulty?
---
Killer tunnels &gt; WTF WHY DONT KILLERS LET US WIN!
---
"I'm Batman."
---
Yea all five of them
---
They increased the window to cancel his stealth and...some other things I can't completely remember
---
Also, please buff Nurse, Billy and Spirit /s.
---
And?
---
I'd love to, but my internet isn't that good so I can hit Great Skill checks constantly and the game loves to throw back to back skill checks at me so I can get on a 95% gen, and have it regressed to 55% in seconds without actually failing a check.
---
Ew, noed. Downvoted.
---
That is pretty strange since it’s almost impossible for rank 4s to get in the same match as rank 20s
---
I’ve had bad Jeff’s before but mostly Jeff’s in my lobbies are altruistic and good at chases.
---
Well I cant agree enough, 80% of survivor perks feel just like meme or fuck around perks with little to no value at high rank especially newer survivors perks, Its quite clear they are afraid of adding stronger meta changing perks. But its a hard game to balance, you add something strong for one side the other will be pissed its just how this community works.
---
Maybe in old update coz i know that nurse wiped her blade then go to fatique
---
But now i go info fatique imiedlelty i cant spell that xd
---
Have you played for the last six months?
---
I'm All Ears is a non-perk at this point. With this change, it would have some neat utility in chases, providing tracking, enabling mindgames and supporting the use of some killer abilities.
---
Thrilling Tremors in its current form is nothing but a tracking perk, and there are clearly better tracking perks in the game. If it were to actually block progress for 16 seconds on the gens that were being worked on, it would be a good alternative to those tracking perks.
---
Furtive Chase: Well, that would not really fit the perk idea, and kind of clash with the utility Monitor &amp; Abuse and Insidious already provide, but I would not be opposed to that. I just think removing terror radius and chase/proximity music in chases would be an interesting new mechanic.
---
I'm all ears is any rushed action within 48 meters, why reduce it?
---
It can, but honestly I don't think it matters too much. Had a match against three Claudettes wearing the dark green clothes and a Meg in the bright ass jacket. The Claudettes kept trying blend in with the surroundings and hide, but I kept spotting them super easily. Meanwhile, the brightly colored Meg stayed out of my sight damn near the entire game and ended up with the most points. Stealth is more about how you play, and while the right cosmetics can help, they aren't needed.
---
prefer it over rank one monstrous shrine, not going to give survivors any more of an advantage lol. i have no perks for him
---
Brughe
---
In our defense (I'm a somewhat new level 16 killer), it took me way too many games to realize hooking and stomping off to get more hooks gets you way more points than hooking and trying to kill 1 survivor at a time. I think this is mostly because I thought survivors getting unhooked was bad for me, but it's really not. 
---
Killer training is literally "here's how you track a survivor" and "here's how you hit a survivor." It doesn't mention being an MC for the survivors or dragging out their deaths as being the best way to get points/advance.
---
Brughe is the British version of bruh
---
I think I've played against a total of 8 Legions, 5 Clowns, and 4 Freddys.
---
That's counting all games I've had on both PC and PS4.
---
That wouldn't be enough to get good perks on a killer
---
Bbq, tuin, enduring, spirit fury is the best build for pretty much any killer that isn't nurse or Huntress or maybe spirit.
---
Instead of Distressing and Unrelenting, I suggest using Enduring and Spirit Fury(or Brutal Strength) to help you during chases.
---
It works on console also sadly, but doesn’t seem as wide spread.
---
The only way anyone will understand the game is if they play both so that makes sense.
---
It was too safe. It was used even more on PTB because you never had to see the killer. They hook, they leave, you get the unhook, stealth away, get a token. All without ever having to confront the killer. Was even better than old MoM because with old MoM, you had to survive to 4 health states, which potentially put you on death hook.
---
Never played a single game of leather-face, just bought it for BBQ and it’s still worth it. Try to get the splinter for any killer you are unsure of
---
Wait, did they actually rework the perk from its PTB version? It used to only work on survivors outside of your terror radius.
---
Exactly my point
---
How is that even possible?
---
You can never play too much DBD :D
---
Spirit, Nurse, Huntress, Hag, and Billy can use a different build more effectively; Billy just doesn't need Ruin, however.
---
Yeah, Enduring might be nice. I have a tendency to drag out matches by protecting Ruin, so they don't gen rush me and I get a few hooks before they get that totem.
---
BBQ and Chilli, Double BP, Four Gruesome Gateaus and one Blood Party Streamer (mine 😔)
---
So what do you want them to do make a killer that has powers and abilitys before they came here I don't understand
---
r/softwaregore
---
Report them. They're getting the axe.
---
Protecting Ruin only hurts so; survivors can work on gens with no pressure on them.
---
Some years from now, when you're done having your ass wiped by your mom and dad, maybe you'll re-read this conversation and cringe.
---
I'll still give as many fucks then comparatively to now. You have yourself a great life memorizing those podcasts.
---
I said limit her to remove the one shot or limit her to 1 axe, not both. Reading comprehension pls.
---
Ah ok I didn’t see it was during double BP, one hell of a match.
---
The addon bug was indeed fixed for legion but wakeup was introduced with this current patch.
---
That looks dope
---
Im a player since first week. 
---
Dont be so proud as the game has gotten much worse in terms of bugs, glirches and loading times. Anyone who played from the beginning will understand.
---
Now you husband
---
I mean I’m being honest I know others feel this way to lmao
---
No, I’m playing the devil’s advocate here and explaining that some players just dismiss every explanation the devs make as them being lazy when in reality it makes perfect sense
---
Yeah, I say protect, but it's loosely protect, especially when they're trying to rush it. I'm not yet at the level where folks can easily do gens with Ruin up, so it's not hurting me YET. 
---
I like the idea of Enduring and Brutal Strength with Ruin and Distressing. Could be real good.
---
That a threat lolololol that mad over a post
---
Why are you upset here? Is this a real post?
---
Loadings been a problem but I haven’t seen any glitches or bugs in a while.
---
Doctor and Hag, i think i see them once a week or maybe two
---
Depends on if you’re killer or survivor
---
O shit nice, where did you start?
---
Wait there’s dbd fanfic? Do I wanna read that?
---
No need for BBQ with screams happening with the Doctor really. I do like the idea of Enduring though.
---
I don't like Distressing on Doctor; it isn't as useful as a perk that helps in chases or BBQ.
---
Why? The double blade glitch was removed.
---
The horse got burnt(for some reason)and got blinded because of it. But Entity granted Maurice that weirdass third eye so he could see
---
you look dope !
---
-Platform: PC
---
-Type of Bug: Visual, Minor
---
-Description: Describe the bug that occured.
---
-Screenshot / Video: I unfortunately didn’t catch one because I was in a rather intense match
---
-Steps to reproduce: Chase a survivor with Legion
---
Go into Feral Frenzy, near the end of the duration
---
Lunge through a pallet
---
Land the hit and get stunned by the pallet being thrown down.
---
-Expected result: The regular stun animation playing out, possibly with some screen dimming.
---
-Actual result: Semi-permanent flashing designs on the screen following the red pallet stun effect, didn’t go away until the next frenzy.
---
-Reproduction rate: Around 30%, it wasn’t a huge deal. 
---
-System Specs (PC only): Intel® Core™ i7 4700HQ Processor
---
16 GB DDR3L 1600 MHz SDRAM
---
NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 780M 4GB GDDR5
---
Platform: PC
---
Bug type: in game 
---
Played a legion where all survivor actions were slowed, including gens, healing, mending, and saving. Red bar, and no perks like thanatophobia that would slow anything. Was running both blade add-ons.
---
Not a massive fan of the skin itself HOWEVER I love that weapon design
---
sorry but this kind of thing pisses a lot of artists off, you copied, studied and recreated ( a less polished ) official artwork...
---
There are artists making things out of thin air with love for this game and it is downright stupid that traced or simply unpolished uninspired copied official artworks get more traction. 
---
Appreciate what you're doing can make a different or add to this sour trade and make something yourself, use references for posing if that helps but make something new please. 
---
Stay away from art theft and unaccredited use of references whilst you're there, that's another gripe.
---
Does anyone remember the old BNPs? You just hopped in a match and lost 4 gens in literally 5 seconds. And then you got infinite vacuum pallet looped. Ah the good old times.
---
To be fair, the free built in roaming insidious sure is helping out those proxy campers at Green ranks.
---
Makes the climb back to purp/red take soooooo much longer, it's frustrating to say the least.
---
1,2 stop1,2 stop 1,2 stop it’s easy
---
I call this one the Narnia juke.
---
i lost all my shit :(
---
I mean in the movie Jason won Freddy got gecking decapitated
---
He’s just not a great killer, gets pallet looped just like every other m1 killer and his power doesn’t help in any important ways such at map pressure and chase potential
---
Maybe you missed kid.   Cause my shit works
---
Hillbilly: 2 human kills and a bunch of farm animals
---
This isn’t symbolizing that Jason won just like in the movie. I’m making a comparison between two games not who wins. But yes spoiler alert Jason wins
---
Plague did nothing wrong.
---
Crypto950&gt;&gt;&gt;Whatzittoya
---
Ran into this swf group with really interesting names
---
Please make my titles
---
Literally everyone does
---
Ghostface isn’t powerful once you understand his ability playing against him just requires keen eyes and teammates that aren’t Potatoes after that it’s fun to play against him cuz you’re always on the lookout for him
---
I got accused of speedhacking for running Hope.
---
So you're saying that (before the Entity stepped in) not only was she not a Killer; she wasn't much of a Survivor either?
---
Move forward
---
This is the entity subtly showing you your place
---
Really? Exact opposite for me.
---
Cry more kid. The devs are doing what they can when they can, they created this game and you would have never played it if it weren’t for them, so leave the game if you don’t respect their process.
---
That's true. The biggest thing for me about him is I just activate shroud and walk around if I dont spot them they spot me and I know where someone hiding is. That alone is incredibly useful. I only get a few instant downs with him per match anyhow.
---
When this noob Claudette thought I was hacking when I downed her with devour hope and said that her and the 3 other guys (even though they didn’t) would report and block me
---
Tell me about that map... aura's are still my biggest problem on that map. Another problem is that the jungle gyms are so different that I just can't run em neither as killer nor survivor
---
