It’s not a cheese strat though. It’s easily punishable by doing generators. They either abandon the strat and chase you or lose the game.
---
---
---
I have no idea, maybe using two exhaustion perks at once disables exhaustion? Probably a bug tho.
---
This could easily be fixed by making the hatch jump range longer so killer can't bodyblock it
---
Smart killers wait for dead hard and swing after the animation and no, it does not refund exhaustion. You mainly want to use it to close distance to a pallet or window, since using it for swings doesnt work against good killers as I pointed out.
---

---
If you time the pallet right, you can still stun LF even after he revved the saw. He might also had Spirit Fury which breaks the pallet after stun, but why you didnt hear the stun sound I actually have no idea.
---
How relevant is Legion now? I remember the hate at the beginning saying he was broken and all, did anything change?
---
The RZA, The GZA, Ghostface Killa, U-God, Raekwon, Old Dirty Bastard, and of course, Method Man
---
Playing survivor solo is challenging because you cant tell what other survivors are up to or how skilled they are. 
---
If all solo survivors played optimally for a solo standard then it would be common to see all survivors escape. 
---
I died five times today while playing solo and survived twice. The point is, you just dont know what other knobheads are up to and it's up to us to be prepared to either rely on others or do our best to be last standing and try to escape.
---
I can see y’all
---
but can they blink?
---
As long as Huntress gets made as one of the first ones, I'm down.
---
I thinks an alternating 3-month cycle would be a better use of everyone's time. Release a new chapter, and then spend the next 3 months working on bug fixes and balances and QoL changes, with the new chapter worked on in the background, and then release that bugfix update, and spend the 3 months after *that* working on the new chapter, with only minor patches and hotfixes in that second 3 months. That way there is still a frequent update cycle, but we're not spending years waiting for fixes while focus is solely on new chapters.
---
yea and a new survivor too, it could be invented, but it will include a new survivor
---
Please think of AUS and NZ players when this happens, we like to join in also
---
The Mask owner Is RJ Torbert. 
---
The Scream Franchise owner Is Dimension Film
---
The Scream Series TV owner Is MTV. 
---
So, at the Moment we have only the Mask and not the dress original.. so we have the rights only of RJ Torbert and not of Scream Franchise..
---
I really couldn't care less about ghostface if we don't get Sidney.
---
Moron
---
so sad, but it will include a survivor, trust me
---
3 emotes?
---
We've got point, come here, and what else?
---
There's people who scrounge around in the game files for cosmetic models, so BHVR know that anything that can be found, will be found. If they had made it any more obvious, they'd just be saying "Oops, we dropped our overpowered perks that we'll use for our sexy new survivor."
---
It’s kind of made it less exciting knowing it’s gonna be the rip off tv show instead of the movie version, I’ll still buy it ofc but still, wanted me some Sydney Prescott
---
yes its entretaining!
---
Yeah, but would they need a licence to literally recolour the current base outfit to full black?
---
I'm on PS4 and it's 19.94GB. It practically re-downloaded the entire game.
---
The developers actually did the unusual step of literally saying they won’t do the Creeper though. 
---
The reason why is because the rights owner is a convicted pedophile and they simply don’t want to give him money. 
---
If he loses the rights to someone else then the Creeper would be a fantastic addition, but out of any and all possible licensed killers, I see him being far and away the least likely sadly :(
---
Was considering returning to this game and this gif just reminded me how un-rewarding it can be as survivor so yeah no thanks
---
She can be best waifu, Next to daddy myers
---
Weird I'm on xbox and I'm actually getting 60 fps....its like they finally followed through on performance promise
---
I would love for the Nun to be a character, but I agree with the other person who says using real life people wouldn’t be in good taste. 
---
That said either the priest, the training nun, or the countryman from The Nun movie would be good choices too.
---
I know :( I’ve reported it as a bug on the DBD forums so hopefully they can replicate it. For now I’ll be dodging queues with that outfit in! :D
---
Lol mass downvoted...It's good to know this sub is still infested with babyraging killer mains
---
Have you tried verifying the files, uninstalling/reinstalling, restarting your PC?
---
It's not guaranteed.
---
The Ghost doesn't stop them from hearing the bell, so they can just get off their generator a second early to get to safety. If they have Sprint Burst you basically can't surprise them like that.
---
If you have a Coxcombed Clapper too, you can do it fairly reliably.
---
they changed her short hair also
---
and added a mustache to Dwight Halloween skin
---
Wasn't there a devil mask in the leaks tho? Looking real quick...
---
Yeah,[ right here](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/188LphajkTOMA62XaV8_5rLXQmqmZxcbPtdkOe9OJ_8/https/media.discordapp.net/attachments/341271245708460033/575346957418233896/chrome_iiWGQmHDY7.png?width=601&amp;height=342)
---
They could just get two licenses. That would drive up dlc prices though
---
But not the people whose favourite characters happen to be meta, cause those people don't exist (apparently)
---
As much as I would love chucky (especially if he can use psychic powers to hook survivors) I’m just not sure how viable he’d be due to size. And if they made that his power I fear it’d either be too weak to be usable or too strong if they over compensate. 
---
I’d love to hear a good concept that could work for him though.
---
I’m a pig main and this puts a smile on my face
---
On xbox1x I get 60 fps on killer I can actually fucking aim with huntress and plague
---
This is glorious.
---
Pig is best girl.
---
O O F
---
it was confirmed by a fog whisper that we would only get a new killer
---
Yea! Drink!!
---
Sam &amp; Dean Winchester as survivors when?! D:
---
Well it seems like a networking bug anyway. 
---
Earlier I also was in a game as killer - farming bc someone dcd - and suddenly all 3 survivors left at once. They were swf and added me on steam, telling me that the game just ended for them, same bug. 
---
I have restarted since the update though.
---
It's hard to not be disappointed when you love Scream and you know Sidney should be coming with Ghostface.
---
are you serious? like did you just forget the /s? the survivors on this game now are complete ASS. they used to be god tier with loops now they just urban evade around and die instantly in chases.
---
you've been incredibly lucky (or unlucky) if you consistently find survivors that aren't completely braindead, because the community of players is now 80% rank 21s that are somehow at red ranks.
---
MM new cosmetics!
---
I am very happy they went back on there changes with Pig. But I still feel iffy on that when they are not active they can now leave via the exit gate. I just feel like that made her useless end game.  I also really don't understand why they just can't fix or find the damn problem on why we have 2 or 3 person games half of the time. I can just imagine being rank 1-7 some people might abuse just dcing the loading screen because someone brings a mori or a certain map offering. But hey I mean, atleast they kind of did something and finally acknowledged it, even though it only took them about a year or hell maybe longer I don't know I only saw it happening since Aug of 2018. Can't wait to try EGC though and see the new legion. I am just gonna hate when I need to level Pig for her perks, which is gonna be soon lol
---
I love the devil outfit, so cute
---
That one second to get off, turn and run isn’t enough to get away from that first hit unless you have sprint burst (As you said) or the Wraith is bad 
---
Believe me Wraith is really good at ambushing gens, it’s a pity so many people use him for camping when he also has mobility too
---
WAAAAAZZZZZUUUUUP
---
no we dont
---
Then again, they also referred to the Ash vs. Evil Dead DLC as a Chapter.
---
I agree that given the separate Mask license, the noticably different and notably non-canon costume(s), the also non-canon sound effects as found in the game files beforehand, and the apparent lack of any hints at a survivor character in the game files, this could very well be a Ghostface-only "Chapter" - maybe not even called "Scream", but literally "Ghostface", given the separate licensing. If Morf outright said there won't be a survivor included with this content, I think it's pretty safe to say that's the case - not only is he a Fog Whisperer, but he appears more-closely involved with BHVR otherwise as well, for one thing having provided the voice work for a Chapter spotlight. People did discover a graduation cap offering icon in the game files prior, which could still reasonably be for a Woodsboro(-like) map, however.
---
one thing i do as killer is imagine if the survivors i was facing were my survivor teammates, its possible to get pissed off at survivors for doing nothing while playing killer, im a master of the art
---
i was literally just sharing them because it's fun to do so, chill mate. if someone wants to steal them feel free lol i couldn't care less, i just made them for myself and decided to share. not a big deal
---
I love this new update finally hatch standoffs are over, the other egc changes.....and some how the mad lads got me 60 fps on xbox1x as killer
---
They really missed an opportunity to add a new Survivior. Kinda reminds me of Leatherface. They could have added Sally, but they just added no one :(
---
PLEASE keep this!
---
Devs: we'll get rid of it in the morning!
---
I don't think it's imbalanced towards a specific side.
---
I think matchmaking is bad, perk balance is still horrid with must haves, some killers are better than others, and some perks need to be turned into mid-match bonuses given if the killer/survivors are steamrolling because it's not fun to stomp or be stomped and who needs NOED on the last survivor or Ruin on rank 15s who aren't doing gens anyway?
---
Yeah I agree
---
You're right, it might be in bad taste. The Nun in training is a splendid idea! I didn't know how much I wanted a Nun survivor. Lol
---
Hence the change to Remember me, 50 seconds to open gates would be too much
---
&gt;meme lingo
---
I bet youre dead right, calls people "normies, autists, thots, beta, soy boy" etc, like, when people unironically use "beta" make me laugh and mourn the human race simultaneously
---
Okay but this was fixed today. No longer shall you suffer. Unless you mean DC in game in which I agree, a punishment for intentional DC needs to be implemented.
---
[removed]
---
Understandable
---
That's true, like the other fellow said, maybe one of the other fictional characters from the movie may be a better pick.
---
Its not too late
---
I love new patches. You see posts saying “better frames” and “worse frames”. Which is it!?!
---
I like the robes though. It's as if the red devil one was the occult leader and the others were his differently ranked acolytes.
---
if it included a survivor Morf probably wouldn’t have said that it won’t
---
Youre right, youre being objective and critical/factual, and youre right. They'll downvote us thiugh because if you dont explicitly say "fuck face campers" you are obviously defending face campers lol. This sub mixes emotions in with their opinions way too severely.
---
i cant tell if this is fake or not
---
There's like two things that come to mind
---
1- Use a key on the hatch.
---
2- If you're using distortion and you notice that you're losing a token when you go into the exit gates, dip. That means the Killer has Blood Warden
---
Mischief List &amp; Friendship Bracelet
---
DH, Spine Chill, Resilience, Hope
---
Yes!
---
definitely. i’d rather have no Ghostface at all than this
---
Sole survivor
---
Dh?
---
On your forearm bro
---
as a killer, just use it to reach a pallet or window, it's easy to counter dead hard if you're trying to dodge swings.
---
Truth is, the match was rigged from the start
---
I have done this twice to survivors. Man it feels so good.
---
Dead Hard/Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, Hope, DS/MoM/OoO.  
---
That's my suggestion for a build to run a killer around with.  
---
As for learning how to run a killer I'd recommend using:  
---
Windows of Opportunity, Dead Hard/Balanced Landing, Hope and Adrenaline/DS.
---
it is full black
---
The killer main society is very strict on acceptance of other killers, theres this strange unspoken law between decent killers where if you dont have respect you are nothing, decent killers would all collectively disown assholes like this lol.
---
Really, I just leveled up Doc to get M&amp;A. 🙃
---
That would be "gotta go fast away from you"
---
exactly :(
---
The deep wounds doesn’t go down when in terror radius anymore. Also yeah, his power is for m1ing or possibly to slap somebody with frenzy whose hard to catch and see if easier targets are nearby.
---
Not the Dweet
---
Windows of opportunity?
---
How has he changed?
---
Nah. Waiting 5-10 mins to find a full lobby is punishment enough
---
you stand.
---
Wait when were there 4 licensed chapters in a row? I remember Leatherface, NOES, and Saw were in succession, but that's all I remember. Am I missing something here?
---
Its so obvious im suprised no one gets this lol, LF is my go to "killer requeue" killer lol.
---
And who cares if it even makes sense!
---
*Halloween theme starts playing.*
---
This has been a fairly long standing problem on PS4.
---
Some things that *sometimes* work:
---
* Cancel searching for a match and start again
---
* Exit to the PS4 home screen, close DBD and restart it
---
More than likely they probably found a purple/pink key in a chest
---
the graduation cap icon has been in the files for a long time. Paulie Esther said that it’s been in the files for a while, got removed and is now back. so it’s most likely not a high school map, unfortunately.
---
Thank god we got Remember me in time for it to be trash.

My PS4 still is at a lower resolution for some reason ever since the Plague came out :(
---
Holy shit, that is REALLY epic
---
Honestly I still think legion over powered with the nerf
---
Haha was just saying this up above, killers have this unspoken secret club kinda thing where if you dont earn respect you are basically invisible to the rest of us lol, the *real* killers in the realm disown cowards like this guy.
---
Yup
---
Took a few hours in the chair to finish
---
He is inevitable
---
Same here! It would have different effects depending on if they hung up or answered, yknow
---
Thank you!
---
SHHHHHH! We do not speak about that in public!
---
I was seriously sat there like wow htf did you get Dorian???
---
Only explanation is they found a key during the match. That doesn't show up on the post match screen.
---
Would buy shirtless Myers for 20 bucks.
---
This is their strategy to keep interest in their 3 year old buggy dying game...
---
Never heard of any fan concepts but i doubt they could be worse than a myers reskin than can do squats.
---
I imagine we'll see Pennywise before the Nun.
---
Pennywise has a movie coming out here pretty quick and IT pt. 1 did a TON better than any Conjuring movie other than the first one. Pennywise is probably coming up here pretty quick, especially if the 4/4 thing holds up.
---
Also, I wouldn't rule out Chucky, Sam (Trick'r'treat) or Leprechaun quite yet. Just because we don't have answers now doesn't mean we won't later, and a lot of money comes from name recognition for this game.
---
Given the choice of "No new Licensed Killers" and "Spend time and Money on how to make Little Killers work", I think the devs will chose the later every time.
---
YAWN
---
You made a mistake there dwight lol, didnt you read the patch notes?
---
This is fair and dwight got outplayed.
---
Honestly, I could never understand the hard assery shown for liscensed characters in any media. I understand basic stuff like "don't make them do anything that betrays their character/makes them look bad." There's also the usual business standard of making money, but as we've seen with Super Smash Bros' cloud strife and the lack of cosmetics for liscensed killers in DBD, it seems a little overkill. Honestly, makes the companies look worse when they do this.
---
&gt;The Ghost has also the ability to crouch freely and lean around corners while stalking
---
I am predicting a lot of teabagging killers lol
---
It was sarcasm
---
Anyone having issues with WGLF not registering some stacks when protecting fellow survivors?
---
Not really
---
Hallowed Bligh honestly sucked, it’s the reason I stopped playing because I was sick of all the farming, cosmetics were pretty good, but it was so god awfully boring, and that break lasted 6 months. Because I never bothered to start playing again and only recently got back in
---
Here, we can see a pack of Dwighs. Oddly, they aren’t in their natural habitat lockers
---
It caused major issues with the new End Game Collapse so they finally did something about it.
---
VR compatibility confirmed?
---
Agreed. At least I think was the original one with the bed death? Haven't watched either in awhile
---
I appreciate the kind words for her,  sadly she's still struggling with her problems but she's better than ever now, I agree living with phobias is an actual mess , hope you will be fine when dlc drops out!
---
Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, Hope, Mettle of Man is my go to build right now.
---
The stagger reduction from BL makes looping multi-height areas really good. Hope is very underrated and gives you a noticeable speed boost at T3. Adrenaline for that heal/speed boost at the end during the chase. Mettle of Man for the inevitable hits you’re going to take. If you heal and save the free hit for the end, you can safely loop longer than usual and take the attention off someone.
---
He can also peak around corners which would be good jumpscare material
---
I do think pig should be able to do that at well
---
I actually use that perk on the regular
---
That's not completely different at all man.  It's essentially the same as Myers only it affects a sole survivor instead of everyone.  Seems more like a minor difference imo.
---
I mean they were datamined but they weren't just 6 random sound files that could as well be place holders. It was all every single sound file related to him. Starting from sounds like his laugh, getting stunned and ending on the Lullaby that's playing when he's around
---
Hatch opens no matter how many gens are done now, when there is one survivor left
---
Ah a fellow xbox legion killer player.....I fucking g love this new legion, it is so much fun and i zoom around maps....i feel they actually buffed them
---
P3 Quentin is lowkey a snacc... that blood covers his old man face rather well. 😎
---
You did this today???
---
Holy shit they're so good
---
Because of the end game collapse, having a RBT on your head when a gate opened would be basically an almost guaranteed death.
---
No surprise that it got nerfed.
---
In my experience they just crash as soon as the game loads so it's a 3 man 5 gens.
---
Doctor being the first killer I picked up made me feel so horrible for my first dozen matches. Skillchecks are arguably one of the bigger hurdles for new players and all my matches were just people constantly screaming and gens blowing up nonstop until I got into a 2 second chase with the survivors and basically insta downed them.
---
Because they’re not good killers. Good killers are always getting consistent 3-4k games in red ranks. Even noob killers in low ranks tend to stomp low ranks survivors.
---
Steam and this sub are just a killer circle jerk tbh.
---
no no no no, you gotta do it with style.
---
#D A R N .
---
That's like saying Huntress and Plague are essentially the same since they have ranged damaging attacks.....
---
I worked at Nintendo. If something accidentally leaked, we just had to tell PR and whatever tech dept involved so they could resolve. Nobody got fired (as it was never malicious, just by overworked staff who slipped up).
---
My god, all of these are rad. These'll make good additions to my wallpaper collection.
---
Lmao
---
You can see what perks you're using during any point in the game by looking at the bottom right of your screen...
---
So this is fine but we’re gonna complain about t bagging?
---
This is clickbait, that wasn't a hatch standoff as for it was a hatch standon. /s
---
Newaii
---
Kate's name was found in the field but nothing more. Considering multiple chapters came out after her discovery I'm pretty sure the devs just reused her name and this Kate isn't the original Kate.
---
No
---
I always message people who DC. I add 'quitter' to their username. You would be QuitterMoepse ☺️
---
Yes
---
This is mine. That is mine too... hey get it back! Now this is also mine...
---
Meh, they’re letting you use a paid dlc character for free. Honestly, I’d say that you’re trying to be a choosing beggar.
---
Leaks are intentional aren’t they?
---
I greatly don't follow your logic on that.  Both killers you referenced have vastly different feels and uses to their abilities. 
---
Myers and Ghost.  Both stealthy killers that stalk survivors for an exposed effect.  One stalks to expose a single survivor for a short duration, the other stalks to expose all survivors for a short duration.  They are practically the same thing dude.
---
I'd really like to see a stealth item. Thinking maybe a smoke bomb or something?
---
No.
---
The other killers probably hate Legion too. Probably think they're way too scrawny to be around these beasts and monsters.
---
his terror radius is 'Its hip to be square' and he dances towards you... MENACINGLY
---
I'm trying to get messages, how do you guys do it?
---
That's exactly what ghostace is, a copycat who learns from horror movies!
---
Not happening.
---
WAAZAAAAAAAAP 😝
---
Why?
---
Actually thats good idea, so you will get f\*\*\*\*\* by your own kind while playing killer. And you will tearfully go back into playing survivor once more xD
---
This is why you should always avoid reading about Killer's abilities at first. It's always fun to have a few surprise games (until you get frustrated and confused)
---
No, killers have 4 perks and survivors have in total 16. Survivors can be way more powerful than a killer. I guess you just have shit teams
---
[Absolutely not the Legion's theme.](https://clips.twitch.tv/ConsiderateMoistMarjoramTwitchRaid)
---
Ive been up to rank 3 as killer and getting 3 kills is easy
---
Remember! Killer will see orange scratch marks when you run for 7 seconds, sprinting into lockers gives them a notification and don't get into a staring contest with the Shape, it ends badly
---
THIS IS ALL I WANTED. Those aren't his clothes from the movies tho.
---
Probably a bug
---
But I still miss old filthy Frank vids..
---
Dude I love fan tattoos! This is an awesome one too, great context and execution of the tattoo. G fucking g.
---
Cool, new cosmetics for a recently gutted killer, I'm sure plenty of people will buy it. /s
---
Ok two favorite killers
---
I imagine many people might complain about his ability being a mix between Myers and pig, but that sounds genuinely scarey.
---
I mean if it's a pattern that makes him come up with this, I think the problem is him, not the teams.
---
Gid
---
Right, who gives a shit?
---
The grammar in that... are we sure that's legit?
---
Because I completely disagree with pretty much everything you've written.  
---
Nearly all killers don't use "OP" stuff like ebony moris with insta-down Huntress, omegablink Nurse or prayer beads Spirit.  
---
Being dicks to everyone is not a solution. It's just your way of complaining because you don't know how to counter perks like Ruin or BBQ, and you even complained about Sloppy Butcher... It's not that good a perk anyways.
---
Butt dance
---
Shirtless Nea
---
Actually the update is already live on Xbox
---
Yes, sorry, I should have explained I meant it as an example that all can be off and still have the hatch
---
Of course you are, like any survivor main before you ;)
---
I was tjinming it wpuld be great if we got this as a skin..
---
Agreed.
---
Oh but pigs rbt is her power not her crouch, wait...
---
John Kramer is never a problem. That dude steals every scene.
---
So usefull to repair gens while the killer will find hatch and close it
---
Pig leak?
---
Because rank matters.
---
I still find it hard to believe they can get Laurie Strode in addition to Halloween, but not Sally to Leatherface, Nancy to Freddy, and maybe now Sidney.
---
Morf\_UK answered a few of the questions (fog whisperer)
---
First off, this is an accidental leak (you don't purposefully leak dev builds). Ghostface isn't supposed to drop for over a month from now.
---
There is no new survivor.
---
You can only see  one of the perks which is called Simple Formula
---
"You become obsessed with one Survivor. When your Obsession is hooked, the Perk receives a Token. Each token decreases your terror radius while in a chase by 4 meters up to a total of 2/3/4 tokens. When a survivor rescues another Survivor from a hook, the rescuer becomes the Obsession. You lose all of your tokens if the Obsession is sacrificed or killed."
---
More than likely not free. It's a licensed killer. I also doubt there will be a new map (it'll basically be the Leatherface DLC).
---
Hard to ignore them when you are randomly put into games with them.
---
Not necessarily, small as the chance of rescue/escape may be.
---
When there is lag its not worth it.
---
0% chance if the other survivor is selfish.
---
&gt;killer chooses to run NOED.
---
"Guys it's balanced bc he is only using 3 perks all game. "
---
&gt;Killer chooses to use a splinter. 
---
"Asking for so much as ONE PERK is so fucking entitled of you how dare you. I bet now ur gonna want all 3 teachables to use? Wow how fucking entitled of you, ur probably a Survivior main who's just pissy that he can't get his free 4ks bc us insidious basement Leatherfaces prey on low rank Surviviors outside of SWF actually take skeelz to play lmaoooooooo gg ez survs OP"
---
The patch notes said the killer can't grab anymore, so you could have easily gotten out there.
---
What the hell is benchod?  Also am I not playing the game right, I've been cleansing the totems?  Should I cook them instead?
---
I hope all the cosmetics for licensed killerd are just those shitty half assed haloween costumes.
---
Benchod is when you look in the mirror
---
It's upsetting because there's nearly no chance for interaction with the killer.  
---
On hook -&gt; Unhooked -&gt; Hit once -&gt; Back on hook and repeat.  
---
It's also frustrating for other survivors because all they get to do is hold M1 on gens while the killer goes after one person and not interacting with any of them.  
---
At that point, go play a singleplayer game.
---
Right. What OP is saying is that it doesn't seem fair that you don't get to use *any* perks or *any* add ons. 
---
It would be nice if, when u use a splinter, u just get to use their 3 teachables
---
The reason I think it’s a chapter because the devs tweet said chapter not paragraph.
---
At the very least they should give Claudette a Brenda-like outfit.
---
That was unintended so it would have been nerfed eventually. Possibly by the time the patch went live. Easiest fix in the world: just show the Killer the timer is active even when it’s paused.
---
QUIT LOOKING AT THE PIGGO'S TITTOS
---
Claud was my first survivor i prestiged. Not my main anymore.
---
Evidence that Amanda is over here innovating the game while legion contributes nothing.
---
Oh nvm just realized it's in your name.  You're doing a bit or something...gotcha.
---
I HOPE THIS ALSO MEANS A SYDNEY PRESCOTT SURVIVOR
---
F13 did something similar with the salt mines. Those lobbies are meant to punish people for bad behavior. If you play normally you wouldn't go there.
---
No you can't. I've used one before and there's no perks displayed. Bc when you use a splinter, it disables all of your perks and add ons so you can play that killer. It treats your killer like a lvl 1 killer that you forgot to put a perk in for the only slot.
---
Then don’t get into games where your ping is spiking or is high you might run into the occasional lag switcher but for the most part it’s on you.
---
I think my stacks are just registering late. Bodyblock tokens have always been really picky.
---
This is glorious. Sure, a bit mean spirited but man is it satisfying. Embrace the entity.
---
My internet is fine. Connection based games have and always will be shit.
---
Nice, i was waiting for M&amp;A after week 06 (?), wanting to put that on Myers
---
wow that looked like so much fun for the survivor!! 😍😍
---
I’d like to believe that as well. I’d love to have Sidney as the survivor. The thing is, the devs are really inconsistent with their wording. They called Ash vs. Evil Dead a chapter on their social media platforms, when it was just a paragraph (a singular survivor/hero without the respective.) 
---
While they have stated the next “chapter” has been leaked, again, they are extremely inconsistent with their wording.
---
Still, I hope a survivor and map would come at some point.
---
I recently had the last gen go off while  I was mending and it meant my adrenaline didn't work. So its still a bit fucked.
---
Welp, pls send me link when he did know ghostface was coming, because fog whispers doesnt know what killer is next, a proof? Paulie esther, he never know what killers are coming, he just speculate and he is a fog whisper
---
Dude... I'm a survivor main, but I have ONE question : WHO THE FUCK CARE ABOUT RANK IN THIS GAME ?  
---
Everybody freely ragequit without bad consequence. Lost two pips ? so what ? Even in rank one you meet dumb survivors who loop killers in front of a hooked survivor or a toxic camp/tunnel killer.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Rank means nothing in this game : no rank reward (bloodpoint/ iridescent shard, ora or even spcial skin), no fair matchmaking (be honest, you already met a rank five or more killer and you were with rank 10 or less survivors) or stuff...
---
When you see this, you understand why devs wont punish ragequit and wont give more chances for survivors to survive or rank up : this game is not fair with survivors. You will have fun only as a killer and you have all reasons to be toxics because this game AND devs said this is how you have to play.... after all "camping and tunneling are viable strats"
---
If there are no perks in the bottom right of your screen, that means you are not running any perks in that game. Which proves my point.
---
They have a full makeover now. There’s so many changes you’re better off just reading the patch notes. In short, they’re a lot better now.
---
It's pretty easy to pip in purples(safety pipping is even easier), I don't know how you managed to get from rank 8 to 13 in such a short time unless you're constantly fucking up in chases, not doing gens and not being altruistic.
---
No bro, Freddy and Legion gang totally hang out.
---
It wouldn’t make sense to release a killer for a chapter without a map or survivor
---
Micheal is immune to all detection perks except Kindred.
---
Because. The. Splinter. Disables. All. Of. Your. Perks. 
---
You said that you can see what perks ur running if you use a splinter. That is only technically true bc you aren't using *any perks*. Bc the splinter is set up so you don't get to use any perks. Which is what I'm saying
---
I wish when you clicked on Min, the Lunar theme played tbh
---
Fun, brutal and scary af
---
That's not a survivor problem though. I would expect most smart survivors to know the good loops and use them whenever necessary.
---
That's just savvy play. Not toxic.
---
Lol
---
Like laggy teleporting or was he just hounding that one really hard?
---
8013?  
---
That's new to me, I've never seen anyone get that error code.  
---
Sure you didn't mean 14?  
---
Maybe try a [support ticket](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us)
---
The major change is that he is 115% but at the cost that he can’t use deep wounds to down anyone at all. Also, the timer for deep wounds no longer ticks down in his radius.
---
In case you haven't seen the Scream movies the 1st and 4th one r on Netflix
---
Great write-up! Review the Plague's addons please &lt;3
---
You're fucking kidding. C'mon, really?!
---
Yeah honestly I don't get it. If the splinters are meant to showcase a DLC killer, not letting you use the perks definitely is a negative aspect. 
---
And it hurts even more if the Surviviors are just a squadette ready to bully you off of any downs you get with their Flashlights
---
100% understand the why care. I care bc #generally in the red ranks players are better. Thus more fun, thus more ability to get bp and new perks for new survs.
---
Absolutely
---
Then don’t fucking play like it’s not that hard. If you end up in a lobby where the killer is on the other side of the world or has shit internet of course it’s gonna be laggy. You’re not worth more time have a good day.
---
Yes, and OP said he didn't know that he wasn't running any perks. I stated that he can look in the bottom right corner of his screen to see that there are no perks being used during the match.
---
Good, because it's falling at the pace of a rock.
---
That red devil face peeking at you from around the corner.. *shudders*
---
I sort of wanna main Ghostface already because I loved scaring the shit out of people as Myers and Ghostface sounds like Myers 2.0
---
Insinuating that he had any perks at all, which is very misleading. That's also not the Crux of OPs argument. 
---
What OP is saying is that the splinters should at least give you access to the teachables, since a killer with no perks against 4 Surviviors with perks is a bad time waiting to happen
---
[Ghostface mains be like...](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DO3f6gTUIAAGXhO.jpg)
---
Final note then. I like dbd and its concept of asymmetrical play. But with so many issues the game is very one sided.
---
I still think that Pinhead would be ea cool addition.  I feel he would have power over hooks in some way.
---
lol ur gay lmao
---
The Plague is a pretty good buy with shards. Interesting ability, decent perks, plus vomiting on people rarely gets old.
---
\*Bringing Lightborn\*  
---
YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE
---
Can someone tell me how the weapon looks? Hard to tell in the pic and the linked imgur pic. Is it any different from the base weapon?
---
Still on about that huh? &lt;3
---
Okay why he look like Squidward tho
---
I found that balanced landing and dead hard can be a good combo
---
i'm about to end this camper's whole carreer
---
Alright then. I don't even want to explain how pathetic this is...
---
What does phishing mean lmao
---
Ah sorry for setereotyping. But I disagree with your point. If you become toxic it just makes more people become toxic causing a never ending cycle. I recommend going about it in a nicer way
---
some of them were invited to BHVR in Montreal or something and was shown/told that Ghostface was on the way.
---
I feel like all these absurd killer mains missed the part where they can also no longer perform hatch grabs.
---
Honestly I'm fairly certain it's gonna be useless. Unless they make your head invisible with an add on or something.
---
At this point, your guess is good as mine. I don't know how his primary activates or what conditions needs to be met, but I'd bet that his two powers can overlap, i.e. stalk with 0 terror radius.
---
 Yes ill fuck up a chase sometime but not then not getting unhooked by anyone even if im not camped.
---
Or ill instanly found and camped while the team does maybe 2 gens.
---
Idk about consoles  but steamdb.info shows that info for PC players. It gets 20,000 players on average daily.
---
have you ever used Bitter Murmur? i guess not cause while in a bubble of a finished gen killer can not see your aura rendering the perk near useless unless survivors run asap. BBQ is solely annoying on opened maps with Billy, Nurse and Huntress. no other killer can get a huge benefit from it apart from pinpointing the location of the survivor. and here comes the guessing game cause survivor can just change direction or get in a locker after 4 seconds. searching lockers does waste time and remove momentum.
---
i'll sound like a record but noed can just be cleansed. every survivor game i load in i cleanse all 5 totems before two gens pop cause it's that easy to prevent noed. sometimes there's one totem you can't find well.. damn you, rng? but this happens like maybe once or twice in a game day for me. and mind you, i am a current rank 1-3 survivor. so killers i get are mostly god damn Billies and Nurses. and even they dare to use noed like 1 out of 10 times.
---
as killer right now i'm rank 4. it's really harsh. it's worse than it used to be before Clown with double pallets and vacuum and infinites. unless team has one or more bnps and managed to not fuck them up you'll be fine. now.. i don't understand what's up but people on red ranks just drill through gens. i do too as survivor. 
---
and mind you, i don't play Billy, Nurse or Huntress. and on other killers i don't use any meta but BBQ but it's for points cause any long time red rank killer doesn't need aura reading to find survivors. that's called map control. i switched to ruin for now cause the current gen progression makes me use it. me and all other killers. they have to. 5 great skill checks = bnp. means as a single survivor with no toolbox or Resilience you potentially can do gen within 60-50 seconds if you're good at hitting skill checks. and if you're not well then you're bad at the game cause it's like the easiest shit ever. i'm killer main and i do it easily.
---
Does that mean with David’s shirtless cosmetic we can get shirtless ace
---
Hi, I'm sorry if this was mentioned recently but I couldn't find it. Is there an eta for dedicated servers?
---
the fact he can 'peek' reminds me so much of the opening scene of scary movie one "...you're...behind the couch...." if we can hide under rugs im 100% game.
---
Maybe they're adding a lot more than just a reskin, voice and couple of perks. Maybe they're adding whole ass game mechanics that'll take weeks to test and balance. Maybe they want to do it right this time.
---
I wouldn't jump to conclusions. I'd wait to see what they do. Maybe it'll be rly cool!
---
Yeah. There's no reason not to close it unless you want the game to take forever.
---
Yeah but only if it's in it's killer radius and yes I know legion got a larger radius but I think it was fine before update
---
Thats a good point not gonna lie
---
Probably because a killer takes a lot more work than a survivor.  
---
They need to work on entirely new mechanics and add-ons, rather than a survivor that's "just" design and perks.
---
Yeah, but that's not really controlling the endgame. That's slowing  1 survivor while the rest play normally
---
It's like how everyone has an old wii, everyone has a scream mask somewhere.
---
I know what tunnelling is. It's just not at all what I was talking about.
---
If the hatch didn't exist players would automatically disconnect and quit knowing they can't do much at that point
---
I was expecting them to use phones like jigsaw boxes or plague shrines
---
For whatever reason the survivors need to go answer ringing phones or something happens, or if they answer a phone then both they and the killer get some sort of benefit
---
Then dont. The edit says it all. I know how ridiculous it is.
---
Did they say they are gonna release the new chapter in a month? I think they're waiting because they just released a dlc. Probably next week or so he'll come out
---
I mean, I use a controller even though I play PC.
---
Agreed. A little too nice as Killer, but he's a lot of fun to watch regardless
---
Well yeah thats fine. You can combo those because you can choose when to use either one.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’d love a little killer if it’s done right, especially for Chucky (and Sam!!!). 
---
And penny wise is definitely an interesting idea, although out of all the Stephen King monsters is it the best one?
---
Well, we still have like 3 months left. We’ll just have to wait and see until then
---
I've noticed safe unhook tokens register a bit late, but yeah bodyblock ones have been non existent for me lately :(
---
Still waiting for the Baraka update.
---
And? That's how it goes sometimes.
---
Halloween too
---
I hope in the final version the go more in depth and that this is an early description of it
---
I hope so.
---
I love puppers so much hes so nice
---
I doubt they are going to take that away. Most of the time "rework" doesn't mean completely scrapping the old kit and making something that is completely new and has nothing to do with the characters old identity. Freddy is a killer who stalls the game and tracks survivors by pulling them into the dream world. I doubt that that is going to change with the rework. If I had to bet, I'd say that the rework in going to focus on the dream transition and how survivors escape the dream world, while keep the core functionality of his original design.
---
They called ash a chapter as well
---
You were saying no survivor should be in a position where they can’t do anything but die. Lol.
---
That’s literally my opinion on why the Pig endgame stuff is unnecessary.
---
SWF makes this impossible
---
Can they be a throuple with Lisa?
---
Poor ghotface guy that wanted to surprise us 
---
Stealth mode makes sense for him at least
---
That’s not a borrowed time buff lol. It’s literally just fixing something that was being abused.
---
Dammit now I gotta grind more iridescent shards for M&amp;A
---
I'd argue that it's even easier now to know when to go for it since if EGC has started a gate is obviously opened. It ain't hard to slug someone near a hook.
---
Shirtless piggy whom'ste"ve' orgasms when hit inbound
---
It sounds as if you're only picking the worst games you've had and using them as an example.  
---
I doubt there aren't any games you escape, and if you find it that hard to escape use second chance perks like MoM, Deliverance and even insta-heals.  
---
While I hate promoting that kind of gameplay, if you need to be that sweaty to win and you care about it, be sweaty.
---
Then why insult an entire sub-community? What... what warrants even *going* to such an extreme?!
---
I wanted to say the most insane or most extreme way of going about this.
---
If the leak was true, he's a combo of Myers and pig. He can crouch around and lean around stuff while stalking to get an insta down.
---
Sorry if this seems dumb but what is the issue surrounding licensed killers that they can't add new cosmetics for them? Is it because you can't alter their image or something?
---
What new kill?
---
No survivor per a fog whisperer who went to Montreal to visit the studio and knew of this killer a few months ago.
---
Move out of the way groovy  WAZUUUP!! Is coming to town!
---
Nothing wrong with that, my friend. Use what you're comfortable with.
---
Leak was confirmed by BHVR. That sounds pretty cool.
---
Their best
---
*"Whatchu doin' son?"*
---
*"Nothin, just chillin'... killin'"*
---
I am ***MORE THAN READY*** to embrace my Scream x Scary Movie memes
---
While also indirectly buffing borrowed time along with the direct buffs it received.
---
Constantly feeling like the devs hate the survs
---
Quinten ingame looks like a crackhead 😭
---
I think the issue is Myers has to really stand out there. Which is true to his character in the movies but in Dead by Daylight he is very visible. Best he can do is like... sorta stand behind something lol.
---
I agree with you 
---
The power too close to Myers ability with Amanda crouch ability 
---
Too early to judge but seems like a crouching Myers to me.
---
Where do you think the clowns VHS porn came from
---
I want their all black robe. These leather outfits make them seem like a totally different character
---
You have the Trapper's weapon but your power is throwing hatches
---

---
XD
---
Count the perks.  
---
Assuming you got a perk per bloodweb, the amount of perks you have is the amount of bloodwebs you've been through.
---
But looks really fun!
---
So you get one perk per bloodweb? Subtract 3 from starting with level 1 of their teachables?
---
having OG freddy would be my dream... instant main there... bonus points if he lets out his iconic laugh when he mori's someone
---
It sounds like they may only have rights to the mask, so we wouldn’t see any movie survivors though. This kinda makes me think they wouldn’t even release a survivor at all, cause it would just be a letdown to anyone hoping for people like Sidney to instead get see a made up survivor. I don’t know...
---
ANOTHER CLAUDETTE IMMERSER 😭
---
Oh jeeze i just had a thought. Easter egg hunts with killers, except the eggs are survivors. 20 of them scattered over the map and you have ten minutes or however long to "find" all of them.
---
Cell phone? There was no mention of a cell phone in the leak.
---
It's gonna be terrifying seeing his face around the corner out of nowhere.
---
Her lategame strength made her unique.  Nobody has the post-gen potential like she did.  Now she's homogenized with the rest of the M1 killers, a conceptual direction I disagree with totally. 
---
Killers need more variety and options to control the pace, flow, and tone of the game - not less!
---
Equally wasted time.
---
 stop with the "KiLlEr BaD" schtick
---
3? 
---
hide behind gens, change direction, be in range, get in a locker, Distortion, Sole Survivor (this one is trash but still somewhat a counter). that'd be 6. i can make it down to 5 cause Sole Survivor is that much of a trash.
---
Still I recommend trying to keep a cool head then being toxic
---
Exactly
---
Halloween was a year before the rest of those.
---
Im personally hoping for evil ash... like the half-skull face look he gets before going full deadite in army of darkness 2 :o
---
When im using Hag. And im running make your choice. Is there a better spot to use the trap to make sure i pop after the survivor is unhooked. Because if i trap the hook it pops before and doesnt count of i port in.  Ive tried using the area away from the hook but it never hits?
---
When the entity kills you, when the end game collapse ends.
---
Because in that situation, the survivor still has a chance to be saved, the other survivor just refuses to do it. 
---
The Pig endgame stuff is necessary.
---
Fuck me that’s work lmao. Thank you for the tip!
---
Ill consider it for future notice. Thanks for being the most respectful reply.
---
The killer was standing on top of the hatch, effectively body-blocking it and preventing him to jump in.
---
It's a reference to his movies :/
---
&gt;The reason Nurse and Billy are high tier is because they have map pressure.
---
Map pressure doesn't mean Jack, Huntress is top tier right alongside nurse and she has next to no map pressure, the tiers are almost entirely based off of how quickly they end chases, Billy and Nurse just have the added benefit of their mobility. 
---
Depending on how quickly the survivors get exposed, he could very easily be an A tier. 1 hit downs=half as long chases. You could also make a case for him being skill based, which already gives him good A/B tier potential, looking at the other skill based killers.
---
If anything, this change now makes legion interesting to me.  
---
I kinda liked the idea of running around with ~~scissors~~  (seriously devs, give us a scissor skin for the knife) and hit multiple survivors to make the waste time, as i do it often with other killers. Problem is, he was bad at doing that.  
---
tl:dr: i dig the new legion.
---
I respectfully disagree and find it to be entirely unnecessary. I personally don’t like the change.
---
Considering he can't pronounce ritual words properly I wouldn't be surprised if that was written like that on purpose
---
Isn't every single iPhone leaked??
---
Survival rate 80% at rank 1, but please keep spinning this "Killarz heav it ez" bullshit.
---
No problem!  
---
I usually use it to see how many bloodwebs I am from finishing the character, then calculating how many bloodpoints I need to get, though.
---
Never actually seen them haha
---
3 people dead at 5 gens left? Yea, I don't think anybody deserves a free escape at that point.
---
Don’t unhook them, hope that buys enough time you can walk out. Course the killer could just start slugging
---
Here’s hoping they’re considering the proposed compromises that have been floating around that would leave her competitive but not broken. I have a feeling, though, that they’ll consider their two minutes of thought on the subject good enough and leave her the way she is until sometime next year.
---
Can't wait to see what the add on do
---
Hope the pink add ons are broken
---
The salt from suvivors would be gun
---
I’m about to hit devotion 1 myself. Been playing ever since the game was free on PS4
---
My claudette and my ash have every perk for survivors and they are p3. I don't think I will do that to anyone else lmao. I will p3 them all at least
---
Great argument.
---
Instead of being sour about NOED you could also just learn how to get rid of totems.
---
He's gonna be really bummed when he finds out there's no Sidney Prescott lmao.
---
BHVR listening to legion mains like
---
We might get a map with him still. 
---
Besides...we all know in the end people care more about the killer in any dlc because surviviors are just skins.
---
To the other person's point tho relating to the Huntress and Plague. They both charge up ranged attacks. They both do damage to survivors. One can hit multiple people. One can damage at all times. Comparing Myers/Ghostface to Huntress/Plague is a pretty valid comparison.
---
I can relate to this strongly
---
That is awesome. Killer, survivor, or prefer both? I like both
---
It looks absolutely NOTHING like this on console :(
---
Yea back them I didn’t even know the songs changed, I thought it was just that one.
---
Run a lerys' offering and you don't even need hits just snatch that sexy dwight from the gen.

It's basically the costume without the dangly arm bits. Also think its mostly based on the Scream 4 version.
---
imagine this dude leaning around a corner looming at you.
---
Its a much better system than before.
---
They did with Cannibal didn't they?
---
Lmfao baby git gud ez
---
Down 25 survivors who have deep wounds applied to them.
---
I'm also like 80 percent sure I heard the scream theme when the streamer selected them so maybe they're just doing their own thing with the robes
---
&gt;hitting a survivor while crouched
---
Wait a minute
---
I guess in case survivor has a key for black locks? But thanks for being a bro!
---
the Servers arent live yet
---
I mean, you can't really disagree when the Devs said on stream that it is going to be a no survivor update.
---
I mean...the thing is Survivors are littrely just skins...so its not like we are missing too much. 
---
And we dont even know if Ghostfaces power was finished since it was leaked early..and it likley isnt comnig this month.
---
Um what the heck did this update do to my Xbox? I cannot play a game without massive lag spikes or just not even being able to move.
---
Not the whole match tho. One person at a time.
---
It's just as good, maybe better, to just get close to a survivor, uncrouch, and then hit them
---
I rarely use Ambush unless it's at a loop or I have a ritual
---
I don’t think you get it. The power, since day 1 has incentivized “hit and runs” DW didn’t go down while in a chase and now while the survivors are in the TR, getting a hit on a non DWed survivor replenishes the gauge and gives you KI, the entire reason Legion was awful to go against was because you were down no matter what if they chose to chase you after getting the first frenzy hit on you, that’s why they got changed and now you’re complaining that the purpose of the power has been ever more incentivized?
---
Who’s your dealer?
---
Worst one we’ve had in a while, in my opinion.
---
Ok I think he has a stand that predicts the future. This is too coincidental
---
screw that, If you're worse than me you need to step your game up, if you better than me you need to calm the fuck down
---
But a 8 sec flash light will turn into 4 seconds. 12 seconds turns in 6 seconds. With Frank's they only lose 10% each hit.
---
Big facts.
---
on switch
---
Start with Claudette and use self care. Start with billy for killer. Level up your blood web as much and as fast as possible using items as you get them.
---
Isn't Ghostface supposed to be a copycat killer and carefully picks his targets? It's been a while since I've seen the first Scream movie but I figured it was Stu fucking up and looking like an idiot meanwhile Billy is the mastermind and knows what he's doing. Feel free to correct me me if I'm wrong.
---
You're right, playing against survivors who don't know how to handle simple perks often results in gg ez.
---
dud.
---
He’s okay, I just would rather use my bloodpoints on a killer I can actually use, like spirit or plag
---
No you are a toxic fan. You find it to be unbalanced because you don't have better perks/skills so you make it out to be the game and not you. Yes there are some parts that need to be worked on, but it doesn't need people like you who actively want to drive the player population towards toxicity. I pray you never have a fucking child, I really do. Because with this type of attitude you have towards A GAME makes me wonder how horrible you'd handle parenthood.
---
Yeah I feel the same tbh
---
you cant see them mend for some reason
---
PC, Claudette is a good survivor to start with IMO. Killers, wraith is easy to use and decent at lower ranjs
---
Yeah, It's been happening since the rank changes I think.
---
Basically, for reasons unbeknownst certain killers will make people unintentionally DC regardless of what you do. You can tell when this happens in your game when your team mate quits with no DC sound.
---
It really only effects killer, survivor games are fine for me so I'm basically forced to play survivor most of the time.
---
This added on with infinite loading screens and freezes makes it so I can't use offerings at all or even play with addons cause it'll be wasted on potentially 2-3 person DCs that you can't predict.
---
Hey at least we get him as a killer which are more intrtesrtying then a new survivor lets be honest.
---
Don't you have to tunnel for dying light to wotk.?
---
Also isn't it smart to go after the weak pretty first?
---
Gonna be honest: I saw “Pretty Lady Leatherface” mentioned in another topic and thought that was the iteration they were referring to.
---
It's for difficulty if you are going for adept. Such as how Laurie is the only hard survivor since all her perks suck
---
I skipped your part about perks, unlikely to go against 2 people with mom let alone 4. I exaggerated but not that heavily. Borrowed time just delays the inevitable and is the only good way to ensure the killer doesnt insta down you. Adrenaline isnt that op. I dont get why killer say it is. If youre chasing them all game its your fault for not killing them sooner
---
It's even more funny because the leather outfit Ghostface is wearing looks like he is copying Pigs coat but adding Michaels colour scheme to it with the mask too
---
That would look fantastic!
---
Pretty decent shrine but we've seen this all recently enough for me to not really care.
---
They also called Ash a Chapter when its not sooo
---
I’d buy the Halloween dlc again for old man Myers.
---
Well, I'll tell ya it works, lol.
---
Just about the time I start getting bored of the game again, some new announcement or hype comes up, and just like that I am back at the grind.
---
There's a reason it has lasted as long as it has thus far.
---
They broke Xbox now so I feel you
---
Which stream was this from?
---
That's real BS, because I basically can't play killer without risking my addons or offerings since the games are unsatisfying with 2-3 person DCs that I have no control over and neither do they.
---
I hope this chapter comes out real soon, it's not for another few weeks if i recall, but I hate farming on survivor for BP :/
---
Yeah that is the best thing, no more farming because of this perk!
---
Oh of course I'm waiting, that's just what I think now.
---
Spoiler: wasn’t he the killer in the movie the whole time though?
---
I agree, just gotta make everything flow nicely.
---
But don't you think I'm doing a pretty good job so far?
---
looks quite different than the ghostface in the movies.
---
It’s not a chapter it’s a paragraph
---
Ehhhh... sometimes it's unavoidable but I rather put pressure on generators and other areas of the map that I know they are working in, plus I run devour a lot. I also run nurses so that provides a decent chance at finding where they all met up to heal and break up their little bandaid party. 
---
All of that typically stops gen production and is more beneficial to me in the long run, instead of wasting time hooking the same dude over and over. 
---
But some people aren't that great at map pressure or tracking so I can see why they do it, not that I agree with it.
---
Well i dont know many horror characters, but i would love to see a child killer of some kind. It would be intresrting.
---
The move was closing it. You can see my medkit disappear when the jump animation begins, and I tried twice. I assume the killer closing it cancelled my attempts.
---
Uhhhh. Watch the last 3 minutes of Halloween 4...
---
You'd think they would've learned from Ash...
---
It's not even from the movies. Don't give me the smart ass face when you're incorrect. Its the TV show, which is different.
---
Pig is also a stalker
---
The amount of First Down DC's are ridiculous. 
---
For a second there I thought the Freddy game was one of my matches, I had a DC on a Coldwind map, and another on Gideon Meat Plant (both AS Freddy. I was laughing my arse off because DCing vs a Freddy?)
---
Haddonfield. 
---
Ormund. 
---
Disturbed Ward. 
---
Sheltered Woods
---
ALL prepatch cornfield maps.
---
true true...
---
Yeah this is going to be super creepy actually
---
Then get the issue where Killers cant do shit and the game isnt fun. 
---
Survivoirs have plenty of tools to me it just sounds like your bad
---
The game is unbalanced and im not saying im the best person. And Id dropkick a toddler if it came down to it.
---
&gt;In lobby non had a key btw which means they found atleast 2 in game / hello luck/ ? I am a bit confused here
---
[Rng is rng.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX5WiWz64hI)
---
WAZZZZZZUUP!
---
Yes, you will get old someday.
---
Laurie also is gone
---
lol nice
---
I can see the killer if the survivor they’re trying to catch ends the loop they’re at
---
Nothing but hate and rage in this sub i see
---
"Noed is a simple perk" lol you are just a main killer that can play without noed, i was just saying that is so stupid that a nurse (best killer in the game) is playing with NOED when a nurse can easily get 4 kills.
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
nice one automod i was just asking a question
---
I mean it is a viable build on him, that's technically what his own perk M&amp;A is intended for along with the calm add-ons. He can literally sneak up on survivors pretty well with a 12m TR in punishment, which is actually low enough to make 0 with this new perk, not to mention whenever he wants to shock people he can just switch that back to a 50m+ TR in treatment mode.
---
Pretty sure the leak was intended to keep us talking and excited for updates
---
Did that on my first game.  Apologized out right but dude totally understood.  He did the same thing on his first game.   Playing later tonight as survivor with counter perks lol.
---
I hate dumbasses that do this and waste everyone's time.
---
I have to have a survivor I like to play though, Sydney or Dewey would definitely make playing survivor way way way more fun than it is already
---
I truly dislike 2 maps in this game and only hate 1. 
---
Both Swamp maps. Just horrendous all around.
---
And my number one hated map, Shelter Woods. Shelter Woods is the most bland, grotesquely boring map in the game. No structures. Giant dead zone right in the middle and its literally just generic tiles and pallets in between rocks. No aesthetic design or flair at all. Literally trees, rocks and one big tree. Just ugh.
---
I like to play both as well. It’s fun to do SWF, but whenever I want more chill games I switch to killer
---
Get this shit out of here
---
This is why I'm worried about the Freddy rework. It's being able to pull shit like this I love as a Doctor main who's now a Freddy semi-main.
---
well deserved, dude!! :)
---
Lets take camping for example. How would you combat that? Borrowed time, delays the inevitable. 2 mando the run and unhook strat? He'll tunnel the hooked. Its very unlikely these daystosee a killer commit to chasing others after the unhook.
---
Stop unhooking and let me walk away
---
I felt like I was having a stroke while reading this comment
---
1 your stupid
---
2 why is this here?
---
Plenty of reason to be against this change, they shouldn't reward sloppy survivor play like this.
---
But it does?
---
So you're saying there's a chance?
---
I am solo for most part but I dabble in swf occasionally
---
Do you mean it was fake?
---
No one will argue you're not the best person. I'm sure we can all agree on that. Worst however, well you're definitely top 3.
---
Yeah, but with this perk, you'll be able to almost finish one before they do close it. Think of the possibilities!
---
Unpopular opinion
---
I hope he's wrong, Sydney would be amazing, so would Dewey, even Randy would be fun, Scream is my favorite film and film franchise and It'd be a shame to only get Ghostface from a Scream chapter
---
Yeah that's what I was saying. It's considered bm by a lot in this community.
---
And?
---
The reason why bright cosmetic loopers are considered toxic is because while not most bright cosmetic loopers are toxic, most toxic people are bright cosmetic loopers. If that makes sense. In my experience it's always either a Jane, P3 Claud, or bright cosmetic. I guess we as killers learned or something.
---
Just don’t kick me for being afk though. There’s no reason to in this game and if I gotta go I gotta go
---
Mending does not count as healing thus Nurse's Calling will not show their auras.
---
you know how in scream 1 dewey says his real name is dwight. hopefully they give dwight a cop cosmetic along with sidney!
---
If adrenaline pops when the killer is mid animation with you, carrying you, or on the hook you get healed and a speed boost the second you are able to move again
---
Im here to discuss a topic. Not throw insults.
---
Of course, you don't want a static tattoo with no follow. Excellent placement by the way.
---
I've noticed the skips in skill checks too. They need to be fixed. All my skillchecks have been laggy
---
If your being picked up it will say its triggering but it wont count its like you never promted it. Thats why if your playing with friends you tell them to either pop it before he picks you up or after he hooks you and youre fully healed.
---
And you don't know the difference between you're and your yet had the nerve to call me stupid. Dipshit.
---
Complaining about something that isn't even live yet... The placebo is strong
---
It needs to be Scary as shit cause his name is littlre 'Scream' Besides what would you give him?
---
is the update out on xbox?
---
It IS a chapter.
---
"your stupid"
---
Fucking lol at the dumb cunt
---
And I've given my opinion while also stating you are what's wrong with this community.
---
I know the difference I just don’t care
---
I didn't get it at all.
---
'leaks'
---
I can't @ this blatant discrimination.
---
You can't see mending just normal healing. It still works because I just played a match of Legion and caught a few people this way.
---
i mean dedicated servers legion changes cool new killer/ survivors. looks like their doing a pretty good job so far
---
Or kinky.
---
Thank ya!
---
True, but still survivors are always overlookedi n new dlc
---
Maybe it doesn't when you're mid being picked up, if that's the case I'm pretty sure it's a bug
---
Devotion 2, player level 84.
---
Not just you. Happens to me every update.
---
Yeah I had no attachment to which side was which when I made this, it could go either way but it definitely goes both ways.
---
no, it's a paragraph, like leatherface.
---
Im tired of dying to killers that get so many opportunities while survivors have 3 strats. One run and 3 gen rush, slowly work on all gens, and sacrifice a player.
---
You counter camping by gen rushing and getting all the gens done in the time it takes for one hook to end, or you rush the hook with 2 suriviors.
---
Sorry, you think I'm a cunt for not doing 5 gens whilst the killer does nothing, to then be solo against a nurse whilst trying to open gates with her blinking?
---
You forgot a period.
---
It would cause a rating issue with the game if they added children as killer or survivor, there’s no way the devs would do that. 
---
A doll like chucky would be more likely.
---
No i meant it was purposefully leaked
---
When did they explain that if its true?
---
Please let it be Skrillex.
---
Owned.
---
I don't really see how its stupid to run a perk that speeds things up in the endgame.
---
Fantastic
---
Now that’s dedication
---
Dont worry, without the signal they cant get any more info lol.
---
Rewards you for sucking as killer
---
Well maybe, but having a child like killer could work to not a litreal child.
---
What kind of sad little man laughs so hard at that?
---
The ash leak was on both xbox and ps4

---
Will they ever do a killer that’s free in-the-game sort of thing, I never have enough for shards and I have no actual money for games lol
---
Vid at the end? Need to know so I can send it to people when I kill them as freddy
---
Yeah that draws the line between common swf and a decent swf.
---
Oh damn, got 'eem.
---
What kind of sad little girl doesn't know the difference between you're and your
---
It does.  I followed this game religiously back then, though I didn’t hav it.  When PS Plus released it for free I no-lifed it so hard I had 137 hours by the end of the year
---
No. It’s a chapter. They didn’t leak the survivor meaning they didn’t make it into the new patch. It was already confirmed by the devs. “Some lucky players got a glimpse of our upcoming **Chapter** release content in today’s mid chapter patch update.
---
It's out so you must have got it without realizing.
---
The only problem I had with it was the possible hour long stand-off. I've never personally gotten into one, even against toxic survivors, I just hit them and let them leave. Don't get me wrong, EGC and the ability to close the hatch is a god send and now that survivors can't get grabbed when diving in, it's good for them too.
---
I was only defending against the "Just go wait at the exit gates." Any killer that wants to use this hatch closing feature can, all they have to do is wait until they see the survivor, and then tunnel them until they die or for the egc to kick in. Sure, they can do gens to counter this, but bhvr doesn't reward stealth very well (for those same try-hards trying to pip) and as soon as a gen pops, the killers knows where they are.
---
All I'm really trying to say is that there can still be a standoff, but it's solely up to the killer to make it one. (Unwillingness to leave hatch/Close it until they know where survivor is - survivor sitting at a gate until egc, or swapping lockers in the basement)
---
(Sorry, I may have been on a bit of a tangent.)
---
Ok.
---
Seems less like BM and more like that's strategy is too effective so stop using it
---
Seems a bit weird to give survivors an easy out when they get sloppy and get themselves cornered.
---
What curse is this referring to?
---
That's probably what they say when they scooping
---
By far.  I love the heavy metal rock and roll vibe.  Fuck the circus theme
---
Gen rushing doesnt let all survive. If im on hook, great im now dead for the game will probably lose a pip. As for2 survivors, That requires swf and borrowed time and afterwards the killer needs to leave them alone or theyll down again.
---
It probably wasn't up long enough for anyone to get it
---
Lucky
---
Devotion 6 level 49
---
I was soloing so sadly I couldn't say anything
---
I’ll say it slower this time. I  know  the  difference  I  just  don’t  care.
---
Dead normie meme
---
Drake.... Where's the killer?
---
He's right there, see I drew him with Object of Obsession
---
Youre probably on yours
---
It's easier if you just play your game instead of trying to guess and play by some garbage ass made up rules players come up with, especially when it's how the other side should play because clearly it's going to be biased in your favor. 
---
I don't seem to get much hate when I play survivor, probably because I don't do things that are consider shitty like "pallet blind" , tea bag, flash light click or run DS .. but as a killer if that shit happens to me.. Pallet blinding is about the only thing that really makes me salty and want to face camp. 
---
As a killer.. i'm so so on salt messages and that's generally because I don't play by some made up rules survivors think killers should play by. If I hook and see you buzzing around or leaving scratch marks.. I'm not going to leave, if you unhook in my face or when i'm 10 feet away, i'm gonna come back and I will try to go after the player doing the unhooking but if I can only find the poor dude that got hooked farmed limping away, i'm gonna down you and hook you again. You're not entitled for a reset and a heal to try again.  Don't get mad at me, get mad at your jackass teammate for hook farming you and not taking a hit so you can get away.
---
 I try not to tunnel, but if there's 3 of you running the same cosmetics.. I'm not going to just give you a pass.. or unfortunately, you're the only one I seem to be finding.. take a note from your other 3 teammates and hide better.  I don't run NOED because I think it's a garbage perk, I try to play pretty fair and also run off meta killers\perks which is probably the reason i'm not higher ranked than I am but I want to have fun and I want other people to have fun as well, but i'm also not going to "go easy" either. 
---
The only time I do is when the game loads in and it's 2 v 1 or 3 v 1.. or some kid with a fragile ego can't take getting down and DC's in the first 2 mins that's not fun, but I also don't wanna just DC myself. I'll chase, break and try to earn enough to safety pip but i'm not going to punish those players for their teammates being shitlords or having McDonalds WIFI on their potato computers.
---
Basically, TL;DR of it is.. I started enjoying this game a lot more when I stopped worrying about adhering to some fake rules that other people made up about how you should play the game.
---
I think I understand now, I’ve played a few games and it’s happened to me twice oddly ended up being against the same killer while working on a gen. Did you get the bp you earned for that match?
---
&gt; The end game has been fundamentally re-designed. As with all changes it will take time for both killers and survivors to adjust their strategies and work out how to use the mechanic to their advantage. 
---
The Nurse stood there on the hatch and just waited for him to show up before closing the hatch for minutes.  
---
What do you mean survivors and killers are gonna have to work out a strategy. There is no strategy to camping.
---
Nah I just don't think survivors deserve an easy out if they get themselves cornered.
---
Confirmed where?
---
7 minutes of staring at a gen, that's if there's no ruin, just to be killed when I touch the gates? Sure, I want to do that, that's fun. I'd sooner DC.
---
Can a person just spam mori on me to cancel my crawl to reach end-game timer limit?
---
Devotion 2 rank 12 for me. Could have possibly been higher by now if I played killer much less overall since it seems like survivors rank up faster.
---
Nea omg
---
I absolutely love the new legion I’m getting constant 4Ks spirit furry with enduring is so evil on him
---
Looks nothing like this on low-end PCs as well. :(
---
What ignorance from the developers. Besides the U.S, U.K and a few other countries, the Oceania region is one of the most popular in the game.
---
In Australia, DBD has a huge following. All you have to do is look at the Australian charts for most popular games, especially MP games.
---
This seems more like a money decision to save for licenses. 
---
I will be the same as the OP. This game is my most played mp game ever from memory, but if they don't give Oceania a server until next year, then there's really no point continuing to play the game when dedicated servers launch. I would get better connection to the connection at the moment with actual Australian players, rather than rely on people using a U.K and U.S server. This will kill of most Australian players, due to how bad Australian connection already is.
---
Very disappointed in the outcome that they said regarding more dedicated servers.
---
Minor issue? Lol this is just as bad as the old system except killer's just get to win now.
---
Did you not see the tons of bugs and issues fixed in this patch?
---
By this logic, “waiting at the exit gate waiting for the killer to close the hatch” is also a cheese strat.
---
After releasing Ash and Jane, there might not be a surv. But one can hope
---
If I’m going against a Freddy, I ain’t trolling or anything. My ass is out of there the second I find the hatch
---
Yea, what about it? I'm not suggesting waiting around at the gate I want to play the fucking game but all of these babies just find new ways to make the game even more boring.
---
 And they said endgame collapse was nothing but killer nerfs.
---
You're looking for /r/unpopularopinion.
---
I didn't really remember what I had beforehand, I'll keep a closer eye out for when it inevitably fucks me up again
---
A wild Dwight appears
---
The one in the 2010 remake is still red and green: [image from the set](https://www.screengeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-nightmare-on-elm-street-remake.jpg)
---
It kinda appears black in certain shots, but still is quite noticeably *not* black. So I'm not sure why they went with that design choice. A cosmetic to fix it would be neat, though I think they should focus on reworking Freddy before doing anything else with him. (which they're doing btw, yay)
---
Earn their worth? The almost minimum wage they make? If you’re serious then you’re the biggest piece of shit ive ever come across
---
twitch.tv/morf_uk
---
Yes and watched a streamer today where old bugs previously "fixed" crop back up, I guess your new here lol
---
Exploiting (looping) excuse me what sir
---
There's a difference between what people want and what can happen. Plus as a solo survivor you can still run 4 incredibly powerful perks that make you, as a single player, a nightmare for killers. Plus if they complain about swfs, let them, it's part of the game and a reason why there is this subreddit with the Salt/Rant flair.
---
Okay. Dlc becomes $25 for a Paragraph and $45 for a chapter
---
I guess it's a consolation for how bad they nerfed her?
---
Probably intentional. Lots of perks don't work with legions ability.
---
Is that a joke or not? There are so many people downvoting you. Are you joking, or fr(you're probably joking, but just making sure) lol
---
You see the screaming aura for few secs thats all
---
Yeah I just don’t play enough to get anything soon, because I ended up getting shrine of secrets (as 9000 shards seems impossibly far away for me lol) but yeah I hope so!!! One day!!!
---
Yes but when swf comes up as an arguement its not valid and theyll base everything around it and no point i make will go through
---
Thank you kind sir
---
And he copied both their skills!
---
WASSSDSSSSSUPPPPPPPPPPP
---
You dont need to move, if you hold the sprint key, you cant get healed.
---
You’re not suggesting it, no, but that’s what OP did, and that’s the context of this entire thread. OP could and should have gone and done generators instead of waited forever at the gate for the killer to close the hatch so he could make a quick getaway despite being far behind in the game.
---
Why is the pig’s power strike move accompanied by an audio cue that sounds like a lion’s roar?  Wouldn’t it be cooler —and a lot less zoologically confusing — if when she activated that power she let out a long shrill pig squeal?
---
It’s ABSTRACT! You uncultured swine!
---
- Jane probably
---
I agree mostly. I don't like the slower vault speed because the purpose was to ignore survivor defense and be able to use your power to down (4 hits mind you) Now survivors can still prolong chase.
---
 I agree with the speed changes, however I was expecting there to still be add ons to increase FF speed. But there isn't, so I disagree with the idea. The purpose of slow base movement speed was to encourage usage of the power. No longer the case.
---
I dislike the power gauge change. I'd much rather have 100% depletion but be able to use the power without the full gauge. An appropriate fix would be to make it so you can use the power at 50% gauge or higher rather than 15% gauge. It would stop the spamming of the power but still make it viable and more readily used in multiple chases
---
With the miss attack taking you out of frenzy. I support the idea. I like how it takes more skill and accuracy to use now. The cool down can still be reduced via add-ons. A better fix in my opinion would be to deplete your gauge a little more each time you miss in FF so you can miss around 3 hits with a full gauge or something like that. 
---
My conclusion, you can still do good with legion and if you do, it is skill. Not cheap tactics like tunneling and spam stabbing until you hit. Legion mains who still do good should get a gg like a decent nurse would. Or at least a sweaty legion insult lmao.
---
I think pizza Dwight already ruins the horror feel of the game. And moonwalking Myers, or Myers falling out of a window. Or the auuughhhhrraa shout from legion. 
---
   
---
But somehow the game manages to recapture the horror as long as the killer plays somewhat well.
---
Except the fact that killers keep getting nerfs while survivors get buffs and the fact that egc only helps survivors with communication, you're right. Egc literally tells survivors when doors are already open, timer doesn't hurt at all because it slows down when it matters. No gens done requirement helps hatch escapes even when not a single gen is being worked on.
---
You are not the only one that go through this. If something like this happens and you get so upset you stop playing then you really don't like this game to begin with. Stop being a crybaby
---
So you started at rank 20 and complain that the rank 20 killer focuses on you only. Don't get caught to begin with, and get better teammates. Welcome to the grind.
---
It's kind of gross that it's really a noed buff.
---
"Hate"? Differences in opinion, which I'm fine with. Downvotes are expected when people disagree. The only one being outwardly hateful toward pretty much everyone who calls you out for your nonsense is you.
---
Quite the obsession you have with me in particular.
---
&gt; You’re not suggesting it, no, but that’s what OP did
---
Okay, and? Still doesn't change how cheesy it is.
---
&gt; OP could and should have gone and done generators instead of waited forever
---
It'a nurse you moron.
---
So they reintroduced an old bug again. Well done Behaviour.
---
I'm trying to learn nurse and I'm a bit confused on when I should be lunging with nurse after blinking. Every time I think I'm close enough I end up missing is there some kind of way to know when I'm close enough?
---
Cool
---
&gt; The killer should have the advantage at this point.
---
that defeats the whole point of hatch... it was always an equalizer for an asymmetrical game.
---
I have played the game for over 300 hours I have been playing for a very long time and I get it some killers have bad games with toxic survivors but I just want a game where I can do more than be chased and hooked
---
I heard the screams, just no aura
---
Legion's ability applies a debuff, not direct damage, so that meakes sense that mettle doesnt work.

---
I just disconnected from a Legion match earlier today.  Still sucks to play against him.  
---
*Mend heal mend heal mend heal yawn mend heal*
---
The killer should be closing the hatch. There should be no body blocking. There should be no camping. End the game. You've won. Bring it to a conclusion. That's the point of the collapse.
---
I don't care if I'm survivor and die or if I'm killer and don't get 4/4. I don't want the killer to let me do gens for 7 minutes, ignoring Ruin, just so they can kill me with NOED, not that they need it against a solo survivor, especially as a Nurse. I'd sooner want to DC and forfeit my points than play a decided game, especially when my friends are dead and waiting for me to join them in a new match.
---
This is just the old system in reverse and with a sure winner each time. The killer could tap you on your arse on the way out before, you can't tap the killer on the arse now, you can't get in that hatch and they have no obligation to close it.
---
Not a bug :( I restarted the game and I’m at 13 still.
---
Really sad the pig doesn't have hello drop as her theme.its so damn epic
---
Ok but that's for them. And sure they'll be upset. What do you think you're doing, the same thing. Except those killers that complain about swfs don't ask others to be toxic with them. And if they do then just like I'm doing here, should be told to fuck off. Voice your opinion in a constructive way, not calling for everyone to be toxic to others. You're literally just advocating the cycle of awfulness that already plagues this community.
---
He’s a fog whisper who was shown ghostface in Montreal
---
In a sense you are correct. But I don't think you fully understand how popular DBD is in Australia. Not sure on PC but I know for a fact DBD is one of the most played games on Xbox and PS4. Australia and Oceania regions seemingly get screwed a lot of times whether it be with releases of games or content and server based issues.
---
I understand that it's cheaper to have a selected amount of servers, but it's not as if the game makes no money. Cosmetics were nearly one of the most bought item on a console game last year. This is just my opinion, but I think the developers are just being ignorant. Maybe Australia, doesn't support them enough with cosmetics or in fact Oceania regions because their economies are not very good. Who knows. I think it's absurd that they plan to monitor it, because all it will do is divide the Oceania/Australia base and make it a lot harder for them to put the servers in at a later time, because there will be less players in that region.
---
Closing the hatch powers up the doors, so they don't need to finish the gens.
---
Yep
---
They should make show more mid section.
---
I’m not being a cry baby I just see this happen to often I will continue to play because I do get those good games with good teammates and very fun killers but you know I got a little salty tonight and I thought I would just quickly deal with it here
---
I mean, they could just open a door and leave if they don't get seen.
---
I doubt that but I understand that’s possible. Unfortunately the devs flat out confirmed it being a chapter in their tweet. I don’t know what else to tell you.
---
how is standing in one spot waiting to do something smart
---
finally
---
This is honestly the cosmetic I've wanted for him since I saw the trailer.
---
didnt only myers have theme music?
---
Second time for me.
---
This post wasnt an actual call to action to be toxic. I framed it look that way but my intention is to spark debate.
---
It worked, gurl
---
Your hostility isn’t necessary.
---
I understand that it’s Nurse, but goddamn if the killer is just gonna sit there and do nothing I’m gonna go repair generators and get more points, possibly rank up/win, instead of walk in front of her and offer myself up as free kill. It’s not a cheese strat if you’re literally just standing there doing nothing and letting the survivor do whatever the hell they want, possibly letting them continue to rack up points/pips, and giving them the chance to maybe win?
---
By this logic killer could have just closed the hatch and warped over to the gates in 2 seconds and murdered the survivor anyway?
---
My point being this whole camping the hatch/body blocking thing doesn’t look like a cheese strat, it looks like a stupid strat and if I was survivor I would take huge advantage of it.
---
Really great points. Especially the fix ideas for the power gauge change and missing attacks taking you out of Frenzy.
---
Not in the short term.  Maybe after the fact.
---
So?
---
No I'm plenty done with disingenuous or ill informed people on this subbreddit. I'd rather shut you down by calling you a moron.

The Nurse, with NOED, mori is camping the new hatch. That is the epitome of cheese in this game and there's nothing you can say to change that.
---
The perk is literally called a ''A Simple Formula."
---
Allow me to quote Randy's speech in the rental store: 
---
"See, the police are off track with this shit. If they'd watch Prom Night, they'd save time. There's a formula to it -- a very simple formula. Everyone's a suspect!"
---
Shouldn't it be the other way around? "How tough am I? I got a 4K with Freddy." "Yeah, so?" "*Without* any addons."
---
oh my lord.. clearly he isnt even done yet, and like you said, the one perk we have so far is a blatant scream reference. we have no reason to think there wont be a survivor, either. this chapter is a long way from finished, so dont get so worked up over what things look like rn
---
You dont get a notification bubble, just an aura for a few secs. Clever survivors have ways of hiding the aura though. (Like hiding behind a generator or other object that has an aura)
---
Well okay then. You have a good day.
---
Trapper tho
---
I don't even mind if I don't escape. I just wanted the collapse to start so I didn't have to spend 7 minutes doing gens to be NOEDed and still depip because benevolent and evader aren't going to happen.
---
not everything that works is smart, that's literally insidious basement LF tier
---
That is awesome
---
That’s why he’s at Wienie hut jr. he’s a true above leather face.
---
Hey it's fine, don't worry about being sorry.
---
5-10 minute live action short films would be great.
---
Be on the other side of the map from him. If you're on The Game, just let him hook you, you're never beating him there
---
Stand by and let him find something to camp you for
---
I liked the hair better before.. :(
---
Is this an RvB reference?
---
Perk: Genre Tropes - You've seen enough slashers to know when the killers is down for the count, and when he's faking it. After stunning the killer, break into a sprint at 150% of your normal running speed for 3 seconds. Causes Exhausted for 60/50/40 seconds. 
---
Perk: Everyone's a suspect! - When further than 36/24/16 meters from another survivor, gain a 9% boost to speed when repairing, sabotaging, vaulting, cleansing, opening Exit Gates, and searching Chests. 
---
Perk: Taped Advice - After being hooked, the killer's Aura is revealed to all other survivors for 5/7/9 seconds. After being sacrificed, the killer's Aura is revealed to all other survivors for 9/12/15 seconds.
---
I’m talking about when he hits me from healthy to injured, he’s doing dmg with a debuff I feel like it should proc mom.
---
Bond
---
The only advice I can offer is to duck into a locker when you see your madness start rising and hope he isn’t running iron maiden, as being in a locker prevents your madness from rising 
---
I agree though, not much fun in playing against the doc, especially when you get screwed over mid chase by an unlucky scream
---
Left behind
---
You are making yourself sound like the biggest douche on the planet with one post. Good job.
---
They called Ash's DLC a chapter in some of their tweets, though.
---
There’s a lot of this in the lower (13-20) ranks. Much higher than that and that gameplay starts to get penalized in the emblem system. Just keep ranking up and you’ll leave them behind :)
---
All of this seems to be pointing to that, but the leaked perk name is throwing me off a bit. Maybe they're trying to get as close to Ghostface as they can without needing permission from the license holders.
---
Im completely with you. If they can close the hatch and activate EGC then survivors should at least be able to open the door faster. 
---
There’s nothing you can do as the last survivor once the hatch is closed and EGC is active. By the time I get to a door and have it almost open, the killer is on me and the timer is running out. Then with noed you’re royally screwed. The amount of people just slugging at that point is absurd. I’ve never been a person who disconnected till today. Call my salty, I am.
---
WaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA#PPPPPPPPPP
---
GG Trapper with doors nearby.
---
I should have DCed. 7 minutes of generators to be NOEDed, to still depip, because two emblems are impossible to make progress in, is pointless let alone not fun when the other team in your team game is doing diddly squat.
---
The default one will always remain my favorite!
---
Yeah thank you means a lot I just didn’t want to take anger out on the actual killers so I threw it here but I’m trying my best:)
---
That’s why you do gens. Killers are normally pieces of shit and will camp hatch no matter what.
---
I'm sorry they did what to my handsome Dwight skin?!
---
missed attacks depleting power is because there was a bug where legion could spam his frenzy and move faster than normal
---
What was she a first in exactly? I seem to remember her being the pretty virgin who was popular &amp; fought back &amp; survived the killer. Which ever other survivor girl has done. Then have it be Tatum or Gale, at least they had a personality
---
No he isn’t, the account Is an hour old, clearly looking to troll of get - karma
---
How, that one looks even less like it imo but I don’t mind the default
---
I've never watched RvB, but I am aware of what it is. So, no ... But I'm definitely not the first to make a "fuck this guy" joke.
---
Its just applying the debuff, which instead of damaging you it *sets* you to injured. In other words if you have 2 hp (healthy, injured) it doesnt deal -1 hp, it sets hp to =1, always setting you to injured even if youre already injured.
---
Another way to see it is that the debuff required you to be injured to apply, so instead of dealing damage as "healthy to injured, injured to down" it sets it as "= injured, timer to down"
---
Its like the plague's purge. If it infects you, you dont take damage, you just gain the broken status, which as a consequence required so you be injured.
---
I would be so fucking pumped for Randy
---
Sydney's perks would allow her to kick the killers ass
---
And neither is RvB lol
---
If you never experienced it, you were lucky. Had several games that went over 20 minutes additional after the 3rd survivor died. One match lasted 40 minutes and 30 of it was looking for that 4th remaining survivor around the map.
---
It’s actually taken from the original Saw film. Whenever a person was being abducted on screen by the person wearing the pig mask, the Pig would ambush them and the audio of a lion’s roar would play.
---
[When a locker appears behind them]
---
Balance and bug fixes can't be sold.
---
IMO this perk seems like little more than a band-aid fix to camping, also the numbers seem a bit too strong, 32m radius covers a pretty big area
---
The Wiki, their Twitter, the blog posts
---
Killer can’t grab from the hatch anymore, that’s the point. That’s why nurse was bodyblocking it and as soon as last surv was there they closed it, activating noed. 
---
I think what might help with this situation is either making hatch unblockable or making closing animation much slower or maybe even both. I mean right now hatch mechanic is easily abusable by killer, if devs implement these changes it’ll give survivor in similar situation an opportunity to jump in while killer closing the hatch.
---
Mad respect for anyone who runs a full altruism build like this. It gets tiring going against the same Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Self Care and (before the nerf) Decisive Strike.
---
And yet you still ask people to do so leaving only a quick one line at the bottom that doesn't verify that's what you were doing.
---
If I get a smart ass comment, I'm not gonna be nice about it when their wrong. Don't be a smart ass with me unless you have a valid argument
---
You reported him for face camping? Just because it’s a dick move doesn’t mean he is breaking the rules.
---
I like the monto quote
---
I don’t want remake Chucky though, I’d rather we get a tie in to the tv series which is continuing the original story
---
7 minutes of gens isn't fun. This killer didn't have Ruin. The next one can.
---
I'd rather DC than do the busywork of 4 players when it's just a NOED Nurse who's going to kill and depip me anyway.
---
If it was blatantly obvious noone would respond and take it as a shitpost
---
Just had a match where trapper closed hatch and then refused to hit me/made me start opening a gate before he grabbed me and left me on the floor till the timer ran out. Endgame is a neat idea but it lets people be really fucking toxic
---
No. Its a paragraph. They said the same with Ash.
---
Don't fixate on the numbers it's the general idea of the perk which is imo very good.
---
It’s a recolor as an alt cosmetic
---
“I think you did a pretty terrible job so far.”
---
how the hell in this scenario do you open a door. She literally can't even start to open it until those gens get finished or that hatch gets closed, the 3rd person was still dying and Hillbilly was already chasing Laurie.
---
I think the biggest issue here is that she clearly started the animation of jumping in and it just canceled when the killer started closing the hatch.
---
Hahaha, that would be an awesome skin. I love the idea of them running with scissors!
---
Yeah its just really frustrating and I’m hoping the tactics change. But since the entity counting as a sacrifice there’s really no harm in it from the killer prospective. I didn’t know it’d be this hard as the final survivor lol.
---
Weapon : cheap plastic fake knife from party city
---
Ability : Runs at normal running speed of a normal human being rather than walking
---
Downside : Only as strong as survivours
---
Yesss H6 and H18 Michael would look fantastic in the game!
---
I fucking feel this one.
---
it's rough being bad :(
---
Yeah
---
Ghostface is iconic
---
Seriously lol you can rank him up pretty fast
---
By the addons leaked, looks like the stealth has a timer. If its just a cool down too crouch again, its fine, but if he only can sneak for a limited time, then Im leaving the game.
---
It should pop up, i dont really use that perk at all but im pretty sure it should show you a pop up like it shows u when you get to tier two on the doctor
---
No that was this same one only the blue parts were black
---
Yes, because save the Chili add-ons we all know that Leatherface is filled with movie references in his add ons as well.
---
You're just reaching and making something out of something that isn't even complete yet.
---
Or for people that can't play right now? Like people who work, maybe?
---
Nope.
---
This right here is the one reason I didn’t want ghost face as a killer because every time I see his face after seeing this I crack up and he instantly isn’t scary. (Granted I’m 100% going to buy him and this face better be a cosmetic)
---
Even the other killers don’t like Legion
---
I’m not a nurse it’s hypothetical
---
DBD is about effective time management. Killers need to keep survivors off gens by hooking or distractions such as healing or totems. Survivors need to keep the killers occupied while they do gens.
---
If a single survivor can keep the killer occupied then the other three can work on gens without being interrupted.
---
Keeping the killer in chase is the best way of doing that and looping is a highly effective method. Hence survivors will attempt to loop the killer.
---
IMHO killers shouldn't be complaining about standard loops. I grant that infinates (loops where the killer can never reach the survivor) are unfair but they are all but gone from the game now.
---
Good killers can shut down or end loops quickly as part of their basic skillset however some killer powers are better than others for doing this.
---
Right. The killer should leave the hook if there are survivors running towards it. Or perhaps the exit gates are powered, the killer should totally leave. 
---
Good thinking.
---
Well that’s good that they’re actively investigating and responding
---
I know I just want to get back into the swing of things not taken off the hook run for a couple second and be knocked back down. I know I’m just being salty I just needed to vent
---
Is imgur a blank blue page for anyone else on mobile right now?
---
Also just because Pig is getting cosmetics doesn't guarantee that the other licensed characters will as well.  I've seen a lot of people getting hype for speculated cosmetics for no reason. **It is not BHVR's decision when it comes to licensed cosmetics it is whoever owns the rights to the character(s)**
---
As a Doc main there's a few things I know survivors can make use of. 
---
 Reaching madness 1 requires MUCH less time than 2 or 3. (Interestingly, going from madness 1 to 2, and 2 to 3 requires the same amount of time. I.E. it doesn't take longer to go from 2 to 3 than it does from 1 to 2.) 
---
Madness 1 pretty much has no effect besides the first scream and occasional random skill check placement, even with addons almost all of them only kick in on madness 2 and 3. 
---
Try and pop madness 1 as early as possible when everyone's screaming as Doc can only really go after one survivor at a time (If you see electricity under your feet you're in his terror radius in treatment mode.) and then hide. As long as you go out of the terror radius (or in a locker, or doc is in punishment mode) the madness meter will deplete so you can prevent it from reaching madness 2. 
---
You can only go from madness 3 (Can't interact with most things, random screams, random skill check location, fake doctor auras, addon effects) to 2 (addon effects, fake doctors WITHOUT auras unless certain addon is used, often random skill check location)
---
You cannot go from 2 to 1 (Rare random skill check placement, nothing else) or from 1 to 0. 
---
By popping madness 1 early, and managing your meter by hiding in lockers, moving out of the terror radius, etc. you can avoid reaching higher madness tiers or a tier up scream when doc is looking for a target.
---
Doc's shock seems to begin a bit in front of him, at least I think so as I've had survivors run TOWARDS me to avoid the shock. 
---
If doc is in treatment mode and you hear him rapidly clicking be careful because he can actually easily get grabs since there's no hit cooldown. AFAIK hatch grabs were removed [but doc used to](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bl7hia/this_guy_seemed_adamant_about_not_letting_me_go/emnbz1c/?context=1&amp;st=jvem08ch&amp;sh=9bf591a0) be great at doing hatch grabs. He can still do unhook and "Injured survivor vaulting" grabs. Which is probably the "Circle the hook holding the maniac button" thing you mentioned. I don't facecamp with doc but I do sometimes return to the hook for a grab or if I'm using a railgun build zap it to hopefully zap another survivor.
---
Being shocked via his zap move stuns you and prevent certain interactions like vaults, unhooks, and pallet drops for 2.5 seconds. I like to chase in treatment mode and only swap to punishment mode  (Hitting mode) right before I hit. 
---
Most importantly 
---
#DO NOT EVER LET A 3-GEN SITUATION OCCUR AGAINST A DOCTOR.
---
Doctor is absolutely *amazing* at 3-genning as a "typical" doctor build (Unnerving, Overcharge, Distressing, perk of your choice (bbq for me)) can result in stalling the game and making progress nearly impossible for survivors. As stupid as this seems Deja Vu can find the closest 3 gens on the map and help you try and prevent a 3-gen before it starts although when I play doc I do my best to ensure the closest 3 gens I can find remain unpowered. 
---
Large, open map offerings can help as Doctor excels in The Game (Gideon Meat Plant) and other small cramped maps where his terror radius (with certain addons and distressing) can pretty much cover the entire map.
---
Y’all know you can just look up actual porn right?
---
How were you compensated ?
---
Even Legion don't like Legion.
---
Excuse me sir, but I miss Filthy Frank and I am not a filthy facecamper
---
yes hide against a BBQ billy as the last survivor so easy. In the old system it would've been a hatch standoff.
---
They're saying the the new system is reward whoever gets there first, my main point is that she WAS there first and Hillbilly's animation canceled Laurie's animation of jumping in, that doesn't exactly seem fair to me.
---
Why they had to change the walls on Coldwind Farms.
---
Wait how? 32k is max how did you get 6k beyond that
---
1m BP
---
Well it’s because they’re all edgy teens. (Which is why I think Legion is dumb as hell to me)
---
What's the right thing to do? Exit gates are whatever. I wont personally camp there but anytime before that do you really need to snipe a rescue? Sounds like someone just wants easy matches at the expense of someone else enjoyment. Good thinking. Genius. You want a medal?
---
Nice
---
I was specifically trying yo avoid bringing that up but thanks for taking the bullet for me.
---
People can be proud without filling up the sub with the same post over and over again. It gets really old.
---
That's literally backwards. You refuse to do anything and then complained that the killer duped you. Aside from your asinine description, the video was enough proof.
---
Just for the convenience of others. Some people don’t play every day; I used to always go here to see the Shrine when I was busy. Now that I play more often, I decided to start posting it myself. If I cared about Karma that much I’d definitely not be on this sub reddit 😂
---
If she wants, she can bring camping to a whole new level. I had a moment where as the plague, I hooked a survivor, grabbed corrupt next to them, and walked away. Well, tried to- an ash came along and tried to grab them off the hook immediately- so I used my corrupt to down both of them at once. Made me realize how hard it could be to counter a camping plague. Two birds, one vomit ;)
---
EaS would be way OP with SWF. One guy loops and 3 gens pop at once in 30 seconds
---
It’s over other survivor mains, they’ve figured out getting looped is actually an exploit. Just gonna uninstall I guess 😔
---
* 3 survivors died, 0 gens were done
---
* 4th went to find hatch
---
* killer on hatch, survivor physically can't jump in
---
* killer closes hatch, survivor physically can't jump in (animation is cancelled)
---
* gates powered, NOED activates, survivor's downed, killer had a cyprus mori, GG, killer wasted my time
---
im really not sure what point your trying to make. I invite you to decode these addons and figure out what the fuck they actually mean for the franchise, because it doesnt mean shit because its not scream.
---
Can’t be. Because if they happen upon it together or in chase, then the survivor auto loses, because they’re either grabbed, or the killer closes instead of swinging.
---
If the collapse is now in the game, why not just get rid of noed?
---
Does nobody remember that the devs actually implemented this into the game before? It really sucked. People who wanted to camp just camped for a longer period of time, and none of the actual problems were solved.
---
You mean like the giant field of corn on Thompson's or the bamboo on Yamaoka, or the walls on Gideon's/Haddonfield/Lerey's or the bushes on Penn or the junk and general debris on every single map?
---
i think that idea would probably only be good for the camping problem, and not general use but most likely whatever they would implement would be attached to a terror radius which would then be countered by insidious or stealthy killers like pig or myers.
---
I would like both nodding and shaking head emotes to communicate with fellow survivors better
---
You need to watch more Evil Dead, my friend.
---
Man when I run these my teammates are just so bad that I never even get to unhook or heal them. Some even proceed to heal THEMSELVES after they see that I have we’ll make it.
---
I've had this happen with generators too. There's an issue with the progress pause after a failed skill check lasting about 45 seconds instead of 1 second like it used to be
---
Can we throw toxic killer mains in there as well?
---
Is Remember Me worth it? Freddy is the only Killer I don’t own.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH MY EYES
---
trappers fingers are A-Okay, it’s the hag that got crusty, beef jerky lookin fingers
---
As a killer main, I can't relate, though I do feel for your suffering. Many a good survivors have died, trying to save their little potato allies.
---
I like how if there's a survivor in it, with a "Tall" killer (AKA almost everyone but Legion, maybe Hag, Freddy, etc.) the animation cuts to a downwards angle the second you check the locker.  You know instantly if there's gonna be a survivor in there or not before the door is even open.
---
I don’t mind whispers but I mind there not being a counter too it. It’s annoying when you see the killer moving in that signature way that screams that they have that perk and you know you can’t do anything about it.
---
its gonna be able to stalk like michael and crouch like the pig
---
Isn’t season 3 of the show rumored to take place in Florida?  Could mean that Ghostface in season 3 will look more like movie Ghostface?
---
Yes but the original question was about T1 Myers but thanks for adding that.
---
I don’t speak for everyone here, but it’s because I prefer fun over what’s meta. I main Freddy ffs, if I cared about the meta I wouldn’t main him. I don’t expect to win so I can just goof around and don’t have to try hard.
---
Honestly, I’m probably gonna buy Freddy in a few weeks once the rework is revealed. I think I’d rather just save my shards so I can buy Susie’s body WOW that seems really bad when I actually read it back.
---
I think that if the end game collapse would count as a point penalty for both survivor and killer there will be a better incentive for the killer to either push you out the gate or hook you. Same for survivor. Ultimately the end goal of EGC shouldn’t be the entity doing your job for you as killer
---
https://www.etsy.com/listing/654939051/dead-by-daylight-huntress-mask-wearable?ref=shop_home_active_7&amp;pro=1
---
Better get it now too, its on sale.
---
They gift you 1 million BP for being wrongly banned for a week?? Damn I hope I get banned too.
---
Neat now i can die to Noed when the killer body block the hatch and close it.
---
I skimmed through your post because it's way too long. My response in dot-points:
---
* The chase is a crucial element of the game and the devs have stated as such. It is not fun for the majority of the player-base to stealth or be evaded all-game.
---
* The Pig's RBT change was a necessary change to ensure that placing an RBT during the end-game wasn't unfair for the survivors especially if the RBT was placed after the halfway point of the EGC.
---
* The visuals of the End Game Collapse are intentionally bright and red to signal the end of the game and to induce a sense of panic. 
---
* &gt;No more ominous atmosphere, no more build-up as the heartbeat does so well during normal gameplay, no survivors feeling helpless and praying not to be found as they make their way to the hatch or the doors, knowing nobody can unhook them this time. No killers roaming the map, scanning the fog for any movement, thrilled to catch the last unfortunate. No more plans, to catch or to evade. No more tension, which the end made so high before
---
 * The EGC literally achieves all of these
---
He was wiggling but the progress bar would reset or just not appear
---
If his power has nothing to do with a phone, imma be very sad, but probably will still get him because it’s fucking ghostface.
---
I wouldn't put it in my main post, because I thought maybe it was just me, but I have never seen a game being taken hostage. Is it a very common problem? I have seen extremely toxic survivors and killers, but everyone seemed eager to complete objectives or at least run around and do things.
---
I posted a question on this sub a few days ago about how fast teachable perks show up in the bloodweb of other characters and I got some good answers but I have a follow up,
---
Is there anyway to check if I have a teachable perk unlocked to find in a bloodweb, if I dont have the character from which the teachable perk comes from unlocked?
---
No more Hatchy Grabby uwu
---
Season 3 of the show is all but confirmed to be using the original movie mask too
---
Since I assume you're new here, instead of belittling you for calling BBQ OP, I'll give you some tips to deal with it:
---
- You can fake going one way, counting to 5 after a player is hooked, then go the other way.
---
- You can get into a locker to hide your aura
---
- If you see someone get downed, you can move towards the killer. If you hear his heartbeat, you are within 32 meters of him. BBQ only shows auras 40 meters away.
---
- You can use it as an opportunity to get better at being chased instead of trying to play immersed.
---
- You can position yourself so a generator is between you and the hook. The generator does a good job at hiding your aura as long as you're on the correct side of it
---
- You can run distortion to hide your aura 3 times in a match.
---
If a perk has THIS many ways to counter it, I wouldn't really consider it over powered. I understand it can be frustrating, but it's not even close to the best killer perk. It doesn't even feel cheesy like some killer perks do (ex Bamboozle, Rancor, NOED). IMO its a pretty balanced perk. It's strong, but has reliable, easy to execute counters
---
Thank you for the repeated insults, you're refusing to add constructive words to this community.
---
I didn't see me doing nothing, I was doing a gen, then there was a hook, then hook diving, then I had to find a locker before the 3rd survivor was sacrificed.
---
What are my options? Oh I already said. 7 minutes of working on gens to be NOEDed at the gates by a Nurse and to depip? You haven't disproven my argument, you're refusing to do anything but pretend doing gens wins me the game. Nice try.
---
the only thing i agree with is the last one because, as a killer main, it makes the game not fun for me or the survivors when you have a douchebag teammate who basically screws you guys over
---
how did it change nothing for the killers taking the game hostage?
---
If youre the last alive you can get the hatch,he cant camp it anymore since you cant grab survivors off the hatch anymore. His only choice is to close it or get you before you reach the hatch
---
if he closes the hatch you have two gates to leave by
---
You are right. I was playing the PRB. Forgot about that reversion. 
---
It is still fast enough that all but Billy and nurse will not likely find you in time
---
I’m sure the tactics from good players will change, but then there will also be your classic salt farmers who abuse this new hatch closing. I think the new end game improves the game in many ways, it needs a little bit of tweaking.
---
Happens to me every time I play the plague, I assumed the camera was in the censor for a second lol
---
Killers can take the game hostage by body blocking certain areas. An example is Badham in the preschool basement. The killer can block the Survivior next to the bed and can even block off the hatch, preventing the Survivior from doing anything
---
Here's the thing.
---
Not as bad as it looked, but still.
---
- 24m terror radius
---
- revert vaulting speed
---
- activate power any time above 50%
---
- still can  do damage to dw bar, and Frank's reverted, but decreases total power duration.
---
- still see blood
---
- 3 sec fatigue
---
Boom. Fine killer. Not entirely m1, not reliant on power. Add-ons change his playstyle.
---
Maybe lacking detail rn, may make a more comprehensive post later.
---
You keep saying your options but you chose the worst one and then complained about it.
---
Banned for 24 hours. And I could of easily made 1m in a day. During the double BP
---
He throws onions now which make glorious green clouds of toxic stink 😫👌
---
* Do totems if you anticipate NOED
---
* Find the hatch first
---
* Do exit gates
---
* Bring or find a key
---
There is so much going on in this image.
---
Whether it’s the show or movie, I’d take Brooke as a survivor and tv series as alternate costume.
---
That happens maybe 5% of the time in my experience--I've maybe had the killer do that like five times ever in my two years of playing. Survivors now have no choice but to leave and it's deserved because as Killer it honestly felt they were the *much* bigger offenders on this front. 
---
That and I got fucking sick of their stupid buttdancing. Games go south--have some humility. And I'll save an Ivory for you when next we meet.
---
Just when I though Pig was my favorite power.
---
Let him camp, what's the problem?
---
&gt;If youre the last alive you can get the hatch,
---
Which he can close
---
&gt;he cant camp it anymore since you cant grab survivors off the hatch anymore.
---
Good. But $20 says that gets patched out in a week bc killer mains complain. 
---
&gt;if he closes the hatch you have two gates to leave by
---
Which require you to take time to open and he can follow you and prevent you from doing anything. He doesn't even have to kill you. He can just follow you and any commitment you make he can just grab you and then drop you, letting you bleed out.
---
Interesting, but could you go in more depth on how this would work?
---
It's been a while since I've seen the original, but doesn't Drayton mention making chili at some point or it's referenced on the gas station he operates?
---
I don't remember
---
Sounds like he won :'(

Well... shit! Not bad!
---
I'm only bummed because it was my favorite killer's [secret weapon](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bl7hia/this_guy_seemed_adamant_about_not_letting_me_go/emnbz1c/?context=1&amp;st=jvem08ch&amp;sh=9bf591a0) to ensure the 4K. 
---
Closing the hatch is probably better, but I'm going to miss doctor shock M1 spamming.
---
Farming karma again, everyone can see the shrine and there are 2-3 more of the exact thing
---
Thanks for reminding me about totems. Gotta run small game to counter-surprise the killer
---
And peek corners!
---
Who cares? Gamers these days are such lil cry babies, crying over dlc being leaked proves you’ll complain about anything. If your ass is getting that hurt over something this small maybe it’s time for a new hobby...
---
&gt;That happens maybe 5% of the time in my experience--I've maybe had the killer do that like five times ever in my two years of playing. Survivors now have no choice but to leave and it's deserved because as Killer it honestly felt they were the much bigger offenders on this front. 
---
That doesn't matter. Killers can take the game hostage and if Surviviors shouldn't be allowed to, neither should killers. 
---
&gt;That and I got fucking sick of their stupid buttdancing. 
---
Oh my god. Wah. They T bag, what the fuck ever. Get over yourself
---
YOU’LL SEE THAT MY MIND IS TOO FAST FOR EYES
---
Sounds good! And wow, I was going to buy Susie’s body as well 😂
---
(A good) Nurse breaks the game anyway. Your team was dead before the match began. 
---
If they were sitting on the hatch, you could report them for holding the game hostage or grieving. 
---
You could purposely mess up a gen to get them away from the hatch, try to juke once, and make it in. They can no longer make a hatch grab, so if they don’t close the hatch, you could jump in.
---
New Legion with Susie’s Mix Tape (the one that increases the range you can see survivor locations after a feral frenzy stab) is awesome. I just dash around the map getting everybody mending and then choose one to down and hook. It’s kind of broken now if you know how to use their power effectively.
---
Take all of my money
---
That's been happening to me for awhiile. It's not because of the ghostface character
---
Then it's not a chapter, it's a paragraph. Do we really need to explain BHVR's own lingo to them? &gt;.&gt;
---
Opinions aren't objective.
---
Yeah, it's the endgame collapse update.
---
Killers can close the hatch and open any gate.
---
When the hatch is closed, or the killer opens a gate, or a survivor opens a gate, what I think is a 3 minute timer starts. It slows down when there are slugged or hooked survivors. Once it ends, well, game over for any survivor who didn't escape to put it lightly.
---
It's to prevent the more common circumstances of the game being taken hostage.
---
How is he a "douchebag" as a survivor when he is never even slightly toxic. He doesn't even tea bag killers that camped and tunneled him all game. 
---
Unless you're a rank 20 killer and think looping is toxic
---
I say it like Larry's because of the accent, but idk what's actually correct.
---
This would be correct if there was only one ghost face. You mention him like he/she is a single entity. There have been 7 or 8 ghostface killers. We dont care who is behind the mask. Ghostface is the mask. Tbh his assassins creed robe looks great. his ability sounds great and I could care less about a map or survivor even though they did say chapter in their tweet and it seems like he would release around when the new chapter is supposed to come so who really knows how the rights are set up.
---
He can be, yeah. Goddamn, I remember his stupid fucking DS build before 2.6 where he "felt bad" and *still* used it.
---
With the slower feral frenzy speed 360 should be a rather rare occurence. 
---
360 are already a bad way to juke a good player.
---
115% ms killer should in generaly always have a 32m terror radius. 
---
Its not fair if a fast killer can sneak up on you and you cant escape because he catches up so easily.
---
There are some exceptions like Myers but thats due to his Kit revolving around stalking ect....
---
Honestly M&amp;A is quite bad on 32m killers,get some other Perk that helps you out with your issue
---
Yea this is pretty much my opinion the community is so oversaturated with survivor mains nobody realizes how different the difficulty is and the worse part is there is just a few small changes not even to killers but to how gens and doors work that would make the game perfectly balanced
---
Yes, this was quite a while before you could unhook from multiple angles
---
&gt;Farming karma again, everyone can see the shrine and there are 2-3 more of the exact thing
---
lol what
---
Yeah I don't see that tweet. There's also a comment with a picture that has a new survivor from the "Moan of the moon" chapter.
---
I'm also going for this. Do you recommend no mither?
---
Holy shit, right?
---
It only took 2 1/2 years.
---
fake screenshot
---
Yea gonna miss the taste of sweet victory pose with a survivor on shoulder.
---
Also thanks for the M1 tip.
---
I will go ahead and mention I got hit by his DS build. I knew it was him. I wasn't happy. But that's my only gripe, honestly, and before 2.6 we all remember being stabbed in the fucking back.
---
Sorry, they all end the same way. Dead, depip, next match. You claim there's a better outcome that doesn't include me waiting for the killer to go to the toilet so I can do a gate? Name it, because if it's not DCing, you're spouting hot air.

---
Not really, they go there at the same time, it wasn't open yet when she got there, there might also be a delay after it opens before it's usable.  
---
  
---
There are probably cut off times when the killer will interrupt the animation, like before the survivor even starts to jump in. If she was halfway in and it interrupted it, then ya, it would pretty stupid, someone needs to test it in KYF.
---
I feel you, on the other hand that sort of things needs a bit of volume to get things across, especially with nuances. Here is how i'd answer your dot-points:   
---
* The chase is a very good element of the game, obviously. Evading all game would be uninteresting. What makes for a fun experience, as far as I'm concerned, is that you alternate often. A sneaking survivor has the upper hand, so does a chasing killer. Needs both. 
---
* I don't play Pig, and I don't have strong feelings against her as a survivor, but lots of people seem very upset about her nerf. 
---
* Turning the whole endgame into a panic is exactly what I disagree with in my post
---
* I'm not sure what you mean about the panicky endgame achieving any of these. Panic does not allow build-up, and constant chases do not allow for planning or seeking. Maybe you care to explain more?
---
That is such a mood
---
What would his power even be?
---
Ah I getcha. That would explain a lot.
---
Because it was just dickish. I'm sorry I made assumptions though. I think we need to keep complaining about it though because it really does drive people away from the game.
---
monto is an idiot
---
No! I like the fact that I can play any survivor I want for cosmetic reasons. I think a lot of people would hate that change
---
except that its still a free hit if someone saves in the basement.
---
It really do be like that
---
I cant buy it for another console until I can move my profile around somehow. No one should need to buy dlc and stuff twice.
---
Very groovy
---
What if cosmetic options were the same for every survivor across the board?
---
Yeah I mean the outfit for Ghostface didn't look like the original movies. Only the mask. It's probably from the upcoming season for the TV seried.
---
agreed
---
Dream warriors!
---
Wow, it literally is just a combination. That’s kinda cool but also kinda lame, it’d be nice to have something a little more unique, though I know that would be harder to develop.
---
Survivor perk: Cleaning Your Room
---
You do your best work when you are not disturbed. Generator repair speed is increased 10% when more than 50/40/30 meters from any other survivor or the killer.
---
Wow no references to the movies. Only references to the original “The Scream” painting. Speaking of which why is the killer called The Ghost rather than The Scream? Were they worried about legal issues with the movie right holders? Should’ve honestly just been a Legion cosmetic if they were only getting the costume rights but it is smart business wise to do it this way.
---
r/yup
---
Still, I like certain survivors better than others. Whether it be for their backstory, looks, etc.
---
He’s possible to play? I thought he was just an option in the killer selection menu. Haven’t been online today
---
...go on
---
But they should have a phone. Like piggie. If you get down ghostface slaps a pager onto you and then can page you.
---
Chapter name seems odd if he’s supposed to go with ghost face
---
The killer killed 3 people before the gens were done, he won, get over it, hope you find the hatch first and get your win, or die trying.  
---
You could do gens, forcing the killer to act.
---
Either Trapper or Myers.
---
Ok, a better idea. "If the killer is with 20 meters of your hooked body for more then 45 seconds, Entity progresson is slowed by 20/40/60%".
---
That way, it won't prevent hook guarding, just camping
---
We spent the weekend farming. What did you expect?
---
Point taken. Though even the most toxic of Neas I played with ended up taking the hatch (after profuse tbaggin lol). But if game hostage issues are a big problem, as I said, it needed to be fixed - I just think it created a bigger problem.   
---
For survivors unable to leave: honestly I want to agree with you. I thought it would be easy for survivors because one gate is opened, but somehow even the most jukelords of my teammates end up dying if the others have been sacrificed. I found myself in that situation once, and I could barely even reach the gates before the timer ran out because they were opened by the killer. So, I'd say that it's probably a bit harsh on the survivors, but that's not even my point, and if I have to git gud so I shall. I simply don't like what the endgame does, not as a killer either mind you.
---
So run unbreakable and flip flop tonight?
---
Sadly, he's still pushing his old solo album.
---
Hopefully one day he'll get back with the band, or at least make some new music, but until then we can only dream.
---
Nah
---
And glasses.
---
I would suggest you get more RAM and turn off any background applications, especially chrome if you use that.
---
Get over what? I don't give a fuck about winning or losing it's considered a win if the killer gets 1 kill LOL.
---
I'm interested in a fun game. Fuck off.
---
Can’t lie, I came really close to uninstalling today when I read that the Pig’s nerf went through with zero revisions. If those notes released this morning I probably would have but I finished reading them right before I needed to go to work. I managed to convince myself to at the very least try the endgame collapse (but looks like I’ll be waiting for that tomorrow since Xbox’s automatic updates are a very fickle thing). Then I saw the leaks. Ghostface looks interesting but the sheer audacity of them releasing Pig cosmetics after nerfing her into the ground … I think I’d like to stick around for awhile just so I can call them lazy incompetent arrogant imbeciles for a bit.
---
While the killer is camping the hatch, the last survivor can easily do gens, forcing the Killer to move. It's still in the Killers favour, but it's better than just getting hit and mori'd
---
It does? Not for me. Oops.
---
I agree if you want the cosmetic buy it, they look great, but just a quick scroll down one of these posts reveal a whole bunch of people already proclaiming ideas for new and interesting cosmetics and its just that I've seen this before where developers were getting shit for not delivering something that they never discussed just because the fanbase had hoped for it. DBD is one of my favorite games and ill support it to the end I just want to express a concern that has risen due to the leaks
---
I like this headcanon cause Pig and Trapper are my mains and I couldn't give a shit about Legion.
---
Nah i think its fine the way it is.
---
"it may sound like bullshit" cause it is
---
Seems like they only got the license for the mask. Must be making an original character.
---
It was a nurse you moron
---
What about all the leaks that mentioned Sidney?
---
I don't think the ghostface on the game will be relatedto either scream or scary movie, because from what it seems they got the license for the mask, not the characters. The mame of the mask is "ghostface" and since there were so many wearers of it, i bet the charcter wearing it will be original aswell. Also thats the reason why his clothes are different from the movies. Something that suports this is his addons that were leaked. There was no referance to characters from the movies on them, only names of people that dont appear on the scream series.
---
yes it is basically a copy

---
It's called client interpolation. It's not a difficult concept
---
BItter murmur? The thing that procs for a few seconds after a gen is done
---
You need to A. Be going TO a gen for it to work
---
B. Be close enough to make the information worth it
---
C. Only have it a few times a match (alert is a better murmur)
---
D. It affects the end game, but how many people actually run it?
---
And what is a "premium" perk? Loads of my matches have that perk now, it doesn't seem premium
---
But he isnt a chapter. If ghostface isnt a chapter then who would the chapter killer be it will launch in like 2 months?
---
This tweet isn't real btw.
---
Each time you hook your obsession, gain a token. For each token, decrease your terror radius by 4 meters, up to a maximum of 4 tokens. When a survivor rescues the obsession from a hook, they become the new obsession. If the obsession dies, you lose all tokens.
---
Basically the main skill is absolutely useless, basically a reverse monitor and abuse with a condition and no FOV increase. You'd use this skill for the obsession swap though nothing really comes to mind that this would be useful for. Ranchor maybe? I dunno
---
nerd
---
Can I get a hell yeah? That’s my new main
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgV-hgprraRb071mumQFw2g they have loads of cool horror songs there
---
He can only expose one person at a time?
---
I haven't seen any of those leaks. They most likely just have the licenses for the mask, since the outfits aren't from the movies or tv show. So an original character would be the way to go.
---
Doctor is great for pick up n' play. Makes it easy to find survivors, and can stall games like crazy to ensure you can kill everyone.
---
Okay, but I doubt people are gonna be able to just not relate this to the scream series and by extension scary movie. Plus it’s more fun if Shaggy Rogers is secretly the new killer.
---
this Sounds pretty bad tbh
---
Was faster to just take a shot and post from my phone as I never use reddit on my computer. Nice unnecessary comment though :D

I had the same issue
---
Except the basement is the best place to get easy hits with no loops, the worst place a survivor could be.
---
Tbh, didn't even realise. you right, you right. But IMO they should keep up the unlicensed killers. They are extremely unique and to me seem so much better having more love and dedication being their own creation ya know?
---

---
Exactly. The survivor can do gens. It is risky. But, you are also the last one in a team against a killer made to take on 4. Getting out should be risky and not easy.
---
Because the nurse wasn't scary enough already. Holy fuck what a play. That's some 999999 level iq play right there. Yikes.
---
With PS5 announced and the next Xbox probably being announced in the near future, could we possibly see an "account" system so console players can transfer their progress to next gen consoles?
---
That sucks. I was really hoping for Sidney. :( Hopefully I’m proven wrong.
---
Let's see all that BHVR has done to tilt things towards killers despite being inconsistent or even specifically designed to shaft Surviviors. 
---
Refusing to nerf NOED despite even killer mains saying it's a stupid perk. But jumping at every opportunity to gut decisive strike, and gutting it so hard it needed a buff the next patch to make it barely useable.
---
Nerfing flashlights on the grounds of Having too little counterplay, yet keeping instasaw Billy and Bubba despite exhibiting the same issues for far longer until the tinkerer rework. 
---
Refusing to make Iridescent head not stack with infantry belt. Yet nerfing DS (if ur giant hitboxes can give you a free down I think they should get a free escape) into the ground. 
---
Shredding stealth as a mechanic so killers naturally weak to stealth get stronger (Spirit, Nurse, etc.) While killers naturally strong against stealth do not serve to benefit. 
---
Nerfing sabotage via hangman's trick even after it was rendered a pretty much useless strategy. 
---
Nerfing lockers even though they were pretty much a useless strategy. 
---
Making Object of Obsession reveal the Survivior to the killer at the opening screen when the Survivior has no control over their camera, shafting them based off of RNG. 
---
Adding EGC to prevent Surviviors from taking the game hostage, but doing jack shit about killers taking the game hostage. 
---
All of this and the only times Surviviors are ever stronger than killers are in tightly coordinated SWF groups and the killer is 60% potato. As it should be.
---
"Moan of The Moon" gives me a werewolf vibe if anything.
---
What makes you think that???
---
That would mean the gates are powered once the last survivor dies? So the last survivor just camps a gate now to get out, no thanks
---
Yes. That was only in the PTB. Enough people complained and they reverted it.
---
Would love to see hard headlights on kate. Wink wink nudge nudge
---
:)
---
It might be. I just remember a news article about MTV working to bring that particular mask in for season 3. Either way I think people are getting their hopes up for Sydney.
---
That's true. Who knows, I guess we'll see soon.
---
His exhaution was still 40 seconds but it sometimes it does get bugged. It will disappear after 40 seconds
---
Gotta love overreactions
---
Seth can join Quentin at the bottom of the toy chest of characters I'll never play as, then...
---
Oof from new beginning? What a bad movie
---
Well something should be done about camping. I'm a killer main and I actively refuse to do it unless I'm desperate for a kill. And even then it feels shitty to do it.
---
&gt; No one has mentioned the Coldwind Farm changes
---
There was literally a post about it a few days ago highlighting that they did, in fact, implement this change in the PTB. People talked about it and mentioned it, lad

---
Shes actually been leaked through some bugs in the character selection screen, that i saw in a reddit post, but take it with a grain of salt bcos it. could be faking
---
Does it really matter much? Either way it's a win win. If ghostface is a actual chapter then will will get a survivor and a map. If not we will get a proper chapter with a additional killer survivor and map. The only bummer would be if he came out alone and we had to wait 3 months for a real chapter.
---
How did you find this anyway?
---
Gives a softcore paperback novel vibe to me...
---
Probably what the hotel employees say when they scrap OP’s shit off the bathroom floor
---
Sorry :c I'd trade for my p3 nea back lol
---
I dunno, he could be abgood character. I guess we'll see when the time comes.
---
I think it hasn’t changed that much, except hitting someone only once. Also as a killer mainly I believe in hunting, the only advantages the survivors have is staying hidden. Even the doctor as to hit with the cone to find them
---
Lose all your tokens if the obsession dies
---
Killer power: phone call
---
Threatens survivors to intimidate them
---
8GB of Ram isn't enough nowadays, specially if you enjoy having other stuff in the background like a browser or something.
---
Get 16GB or more if you can.
---
He looks pretty damn intimidating.
---
I just got a porn bot message me the same thing. I only use the ps messenger app to talk with old friends. Lol
---
If they didn't have that the survivor could just hold the game hostage.
---
Yeah that seems to be popular, even without hatch being closed. I've seen noed more today than I have for a while just because all you have to do is keep them off the gate. Like there was 1i tried to save the other survivor but got hit with that.
---
Tunneling and camping sucks. If really effects some players more than it does others though.
---
Not perks, but a built in ability would be nice. Like 5% increase repair speed for Dwight, 5% increase healing speed for Claudette, etc.
---
Ya in their character portrait it will show their 3 perks and it will have a white check near the bottom if you own the perk already
---
I think the most effective way they could implement something like this would be as its own game mechanic that takes two factors into account 
---
Killer proximity to hook, and the proximity of other survivors to the hooked survivor. The idea being to give the killer reason to leave, however to not punish them in cases such as hook diving survivors in wait nearby. 
---
My concept idea being 
---
If the killer is within 3/2/1* meters apply 1/2/3 tokens, however if 1/2/3 survivors are within X meters of the hook, remove 1/2/3 tokens. Sacrifice progress is slowed by X% multiplied by number of tokens 
---
in addition the sacrifice progress cannot be slowed once all generators have been powered, or if the killer is in a chase 
---
*this tier is marked simply to show a decreasing variable for distance rather than provide a solid number
---
Will ghost face have his regular, black hood or only these leather/cyberpunk looking ones?
---
Plus more true to the movies depiction.
---
But I like Legion.   And only play as Susie.
---
So let me get this straight, you have no solution, my options are DC, run at the killer and die, or *have a game that doesn't take that long* by doing gens for *7 minutes* and die?
---
You're pretty stubborn in not telling me anything of substance. You're complaining that I'm complaining. You're not marking it in the books and moving onto the next complaint.
---
You're just flinging an insult at me in each comment too.
---
Don't camp the basement and it won't go off in the first place :)
---
But, they're Claudette.......I don't understand.
---
If you really wanna screw a flashlight crew bring lightborn and overwhelming and franklins, those flashlights are wasted.
---
And I—oop!
---
Yeah I’m becoming more of a killer main because I’m real tired of bad teammates dragging me down (not saying I’m the greatest but still).
---
The guy on twitter hinting to it and begging for followers tagged his posts with dead by daylight, ghostface, and Sidney Prescott. Trying to not look too into it but I’m hoping!
---
Any dumbass that actually thinks this picture is real needs to get off the internet before they get their credit card number stolen or something.
---
honestly naw, I just read the title and immediately threw my "ACKTUALLY" glasses on. My b lol
---
Even after BHVR fixed the core issue of Legion your still bitching to this degree? I hate to break out ol’ reliable but... 
---
Git gud.
---
Conversely I usually play lazy, sometimes pretty stoned even, and if I 4k while forgetting to turn off messages I tend to get called a sweaty try hard.
---
It's like "buddy, I'm flying pretty high and spent a minute clanging my bell because I liked the noise, tryhard I am not"
---
Yet sweaty try hard I apperently am...
---
Right, yeah pretty much what I say too
---
Gee a killer wanting a survivor to die. Impossible. I thought their job was to warn them about the consequences of smoking.
---
Are the same characters in the 4 movies? Because its the same mask in 4 movies.
---
P3 Nurse... I sleep
---
P3 Bubba and Legacy Nurse... Real shit
---
Okay? It could be a completely original character since they only have rights to the mask.
---
Yes this has been happening to me too!!
---
I can feel the pain behind your facade
---
This is more than likely an original character if it's even for the ghostface chapter.
---
There are valid reasons to camp, like it or not.
---
I'd run msi afterburner just to keep an eye on gpu temps while running dbd and make sure your card isn't throttling. (On my old card I had to set a relatively aggressive fan curve for dbd and it solved all my freezing issues)
---
Imagine if they did this on purpose for real LUL
---
That means the game had already started
---
It's when you send messages or emails to people trying to get private or sensitive information (like credit card info)
---
You need to at least give him the last one. Killing yourself or dcing just ruins the match for everyone, unless it's too give someone hatch.
---
The timer thing was bad but never the meat of the issue. It was also already changed on the PTB so, yeah, zero revisions from the most recent PTB. With no endgame pressure the Pig easily becomes one of the worst Killers in the game. She used to have clutch potential if she fell behind. Now, at best she’s on par with the Wraith having a decent early game and horrible endgame. However, assuming Freddy’s rework actually lifts him up to at least into mid tier, it’s quite arguable that she’s the worst Killer in the game.
---
First couple singles off his debut were alright but at this point I don’t know if he’s dead or if the label would prefer if he’s dead.
---
I dunno, i mean look at Legion. They were a weak and unfun killer at launch as well as being the transmorphers version of Ghostface, And their map is horrible. Plus the licensed killers are horror icons and I'd rather have them in DBD than another game picking up the license like Jason.
---
I feel camped just looking at this
---
Paulie did a video recently on the new killer (ghost face) and he creeps like Micheal AND can crouch like the pig reducing his heartbeat to zero the more he creeps.
---
Reading the backstory, it doesn't sound like he's related to The Ghost or Scream in anyway, but rather a (possibly fanmade?) chapter featuring a werewolf.
---
See the parts: "the two would scare each other with stories of the shapeshifters that lurked in the woods," and, "it wasn't the flames that frightened him that night, but the horrifying beast that lurked behind them, it's eyes red as embers."
---
I personally think this a fanmade chapter rather than a leak of any kind, but I could be wrong.
---
I think some of them carry over, but the original scream is the most memorable and iconic, being the first one and all. Whether it’s cannon or not, Shaggy Rogers is my head cannon for the ghost’s true identity.
---
new d stike logo
---
I don’t see any new patch notes stating that they removed ability to bodyblock the hatch or increased time to close it.
---
Thank you.
---
Also a lot of people are saying they only acquired the rights to the mask and not an actual character? Which would kinda suck honestly
---
I don't know why you're deciding to be an ass about it. This isn't even my picture. I found it on Twitter. And why would Googling moan of the moon or the survivor come up with anything when it's not even out yet, it's just been leaked. Besides, if this is the survivor for the chapter, he's most like an original character due to bhvr only having the rights to the mask.
---
Heck
---
So if you knew it was a reference to the tv show why did you even post this shit?
---
My Trapper dumb ass once chased a Jeff through a singular jungle gym for 5 minutes.  I feel for several 360s, a dead hard and six, I repeat six locker jukes.  My boosted ass deserved that loss.
---
Phishing, if I'm not mistaken, is sending someone to a fake website that keylogs their username and password when you log in to it. I had something like that happen to me years ago when I played Runescape.
---
I think 8gb is still good
---
This is honestly one of the best ideas I've seen on this subreddit.
---
Is it just me, or does it look like it's Ghostface mashed into a Mortal Kombat 3d model?
---
You could be right. It's just something I found on Twitter. While the leaks were circulating.
---
Minus the arm flaps, its basically the movie version. It was probably an engine reason for them not including the Nazgul arms, because those would probably look horrible in the engine.
---
You’re right, I just think some sort of adjustment is needed. I’m not a developer though so I won’t claim to have any ideas on it.
---
I gave my suggestion and you said it's not an option. We seem to be stuck at a wall. To each their own I guess
---
No need to resort to petty insults
---
First of all thx but dbd isn't a very hefty game to run. If u use 8gb for pure gaming which I do and nothing in the background then it's the optimum amount of ram that's why I think 8gb is plenty especially for dbd. I made the thread for if anyone had solutions for me to go into the in game files since I've heard people have tried that
---
Man it isn't about dlc. Think about it like this. If the leaks were known by some of the Whisperers whom stream and got the 'leaked' dev patch the publicity would help both the streamers and the company. So then this thing of 'Oops our bad' is deceitful.
---
What the fuck is going on. I haven't played this game in like 5 months.
---
Really? That's good to hear.
---
Is there a public list of employees? It would be funny to compare and see which names are missing lol
---
Yeah, I still play a lot, half of my friends still play a lot and I've made multiple friends through the game. Why are you even here if the game is "dying"?
---
Hope so! Looks great. I'd love all the looks from MK10 + more.
---
Fuck off and good for you
---
It's a bug
---
I thought you couldn’t wake up from failing healing skill checks? Like, it made self care super broken against Freddy or something.
---
when you have no actual counter-argument so you insult people
---
Still comes back to who cares. It’s not a big deal more dlc great! It was leaked ok. It is what it is and quit worrying and complaining about nonessential things.
---
How's it worse?
---
Fuck off too, there was no need to counter argue with a mindless worm, such as you!
---
r/iamverysmart
---
EGC was made to cut down those unnecessary hatch standoff hours and 4 gen immersed last survivors which is annoying to deal with. I also dont think they would add extra game modes.
---
I don't like the skins for Ghostface, but the design for Ghostface himself looks outstanding imo. Really looking forward to seeing him played on the PTB!
---
Guess you are right. Although, it would be cool if in the future they end up adding game modes.
---
There are a couple of more highlights from this match! Let me know if you'd like part 2 or 3. It was... terrifying, to say the least. She spent the match sniping from unseen distances LOL
---
Heavily depends on the match.
---
Imo, if you take 5 equally skilled players, the killer is somewhat weaker, BUT AGAIN, this all heavily, HEAVILY depends
---
This....and with the update today theres more of them than ever.... I had to uninstall today after dealing with 5 back to back. I'm sure I'll pick it back up but I honestly just couldn't stand to play any longer...
---
r/wooosh?
---
SS and OoO can be a pretty fun combo to be fair.
---
But Billy was the main Ghostface... sorry Shaggy 🧐
---
my man trapper wasnt having none of The Legion
---
Wait, who got a new kill?
---
Do the gens and play it out.
---
I'd absolutely use a knife cosmetic that made it look plastic.
---
no I did it about a month ago! just excited for the ghostface update! :)

I legit got yelled at wheni called him out for being so fake and despreate

??
---
Oh dear, you have opened that question. Brace for the salt.
---
Depends if the platform, but you can see in the game controls
---
They've probably spent too much time designing him to add anything much new at this point unfortunetly
---
He comes
---
WHAT THE FUCK?? I HAVEN'T PLAYED THIS GAME SO LONG I WAS SO SURPRISED
---
True, good point. I guess no one really knows at this point until we get more information. The chapter (or whatever it is) obviously isn’t complete yet.
---
How out of touch do you have to be with the devs to not know about the EGC? Wait, when you log into the game and there’s a new update or whatever, won’t it show you the latest stuff that’s been added to the game or is going on? How can anyone miss that?
---
In the first link:
---
&gt;Please note: The data collected is using your rank after the match, so players who depipped from rank 1 down to rank 2 would appear as rank 2 for our purposes. This is likely the reason why you'll notice a large gap between the survival rate of rank 1 and rank 2: Players who survived were more likely to pip and maintain their rank, while those who died were more likely to depip and lose their rank.
---
This probably means rank 2 has a slightly better survival rate than 60% and rank 1 is worse than 80% but by how much I don't know.
---
I'm glad I don't play killer in red ranks. I get enough 100% survivals in my yellow versus green/purple.
---
They'd have to renegotiate and ask New Line to use the original version. 
---
It all comes down to price. If they ask for a ridiculous amount, I understand walking away. If it's a fair offer, BHVR should jump at it. Classic Freddy would get tons of people to play just for the fact that it's Robert, no matter how shit the killer is. 
---
MKX *mobile* got a classic Freddy skin. It comes down to New Line/WB (I believe they merged years ago, not too sure) and whether or not they'd offer for a reasonable price, not that it outright can't happen.
---
“Cmon babe I wanna do it in the mask”
---
I hope someone here gets this quote.
---
Nah, No Mither
---
Im not saying “just get 4 kill game it’s easy” I’m saying saving the trap is basically shooting yourself in the foot. You WILL get more kills by using the traps and letting them do the time wasting job they can do, instead of trying to get kills with the traps in a game you already lost. For every player with a trap on their head it means one less player available to get hook saves, making it easier to find the people without traps on their head, causing a snowball effect. 
---
The problem with pig is the key box RNG factor, not the lethality of the bear traps in end game. It’s not good to promote saving bear traps to new pig players or even inexperienced pig players, it will just make their experience playing pig worse and probably turn them off from playing pig, and it’s probably why I see 2 or 3 pigs a month.
---
I kind of wish the ghost had a sprinting ability kind of like legion, but without the dumb mending. He runs a lot lol
---
*Shane McMahon intensifies*
---
And now the voyeur club has yet another member.
---
I'd say wraith as it is very simple  to learn and teaches quite a lot about mind games and body blocking but if he wants something more brute force billy
---
His name is Ghostface. Not Scream
---
That's very true, I can always get a touch up down the road. I'm just happy that it came out the way it did. Now gotta go for more Huntress games than normal, lol.
---
yeah but no mither is a lot more fun if you’re good and not a pussy
---
I don't think that's technically holding the game hostage
---
Nah it's still uncalled for
---
The guy is actually talking about himself. Maybe he needs a piece of Jane's booty. Who says teabagging is a scummy move? :)))
---
Literally not that hard to fix. I think they should first though fix this infinite loading stuff. This is like a little band aid with the match just closing and giving you all your items. Now lets say they do fix this bug, then want to punish DC players. I don't think they should copy league, this game doesn't have the player base like league. They should just do what Overwatch does, especially like in normals you get less xp your next few games. Would maybe stop most players from DCing.
---
It doesn't look worse to me, that's why I'm asking you to elaborate.
---
Alright, you do 7 minutes and die to NOED Nurse, I'll do die to NOED Nurse.
---
I've been saying this for a while but people would rather promote toxic gameplay and force players to just play this shit game out.
---
Welcome to the dark side
---
Then don't be this stupid next time.
---
Except its not every game today ruin is down in the first 60 seconds its unacceptable
---
 But if camp it is obviously that you are bad
---
I like it so far. Played 3 matches as survivor. Lost one, had 3 teammates disconnect in less then 5 minutes in another and the killer initiated the end game and I escaped and had a straight up 5 gen escape where I triggered the end game.
---
This really helps to speed things up and should reduce end game griefing from toxic survivors. If this works out, and I hope it does, they should focus next on campers and dealing with players who constantly disconnect.
---
&gt; The Nurse stood on the hatch and waited minutes for him to show up so she could close it. 
---
I'd say just rewatch it till you figure it out.
---
I’ve gone against two Legions so far and one of them I know had Franklin’s Demise, yet on the score screen their perks and add-ons were blank.
---
Good meme but did you mean legacy 3 or 3 blink omegablink ... Because that’s not a thing.
---
I think you mean overwhelming presence?
---
Can't wait for pig cosmetics
---
Not sure *what* you're talking about
---
True everyones talking... about how stupid the dev's are lmao. If that's their intended effect I'm genuinely impressed
---
Yes! I've been playing as a Killer a bit too, pretty much solely the Hillbilly, I'm trying to learn how to other survivors juke out killers.  I definitely play a lot stealthier as a survivor.
---
Where was this OG picture posted :00
---
BILL!
---
Your right salty ace I mean snazzy ace. I tried this killer in his base form and from my experience he was trash with none of his base perks so I'm not going to buy him because I can't trust he'll be good with his teachable perks. Thanks for being constructive here. Obviously the devs WANT people to buy stuff, so the fact that they don't even let you try out the perks you would get on that killer is clearly counter intuitive.
---
they added an all out attack in dbd amazing
---
Ok cool. Thank you.
---
Ty
---
Killer IGN: 'Miranda Cosgrove' btw, lmao.
---
If you played any games as pig with end game collapse then you would know that having her traps not allow survivors to escape after exits are power would just make her wayyy overpowered. Because then every pig would just save all her traps for the end and then open the exits as soon as they were trapped which would only allow 2 minutes for the survivors with traps to get them off.
---
From the nightmare on elm street remake
---
Holy. Some survivors rather play "hold action button for 80 seconds" it seems. I made a joke post about what survivors want for a killer but this is sad.
---
This is incredible
---
Depends if its a paragraph or a full chapter.
---
I think its a full chapter wich means a PTB will happen.
---
I wouldn't hate super Freddy
---
Floor is lava
---
I think we could add some anime blushes. Maybe a flower crown
---
I like it also like the new menu music as survivor
---
Too many things to consider for this, then once you think you’ve got an answer SWF comes in and kicks that answer out the window forcing you to rewrite it all
---
Why perform a hatch grab when you can just walk up and shut it
---
I noticed there were no perks showing but I figured it was just a thing that happened when using a splinter, especially because I had an obsession and was trying Freddy. The point is it makes no sense that they would let you try a killer in hopes of you buying them, but make them as weak as possible and not even let you try out the perks that you would have on that killer.
---
My order is 1, 4, 3, 2. So you're not alone! I was getting ready to defend it 😂
---
Why is Adrenaline considered so good?
---
I mean, it doesnt look bad, I just dont get why it's so big of a thing if it's only relevant during the last minutes of the game (and sometimes not even that)
---
You know, I never thought of it that way. Leaks get WAY more articles written about them than when they just release content
---
[deleted]
---
Downed the last two people near the hatch today. As I hooked the one he DC’d and boom the other guy got away. I would have had that sweet 4K. The best part was that someone popped BPS

---
I mean, I was saying it as a joke but since everyone keeps fighting about what is balanced and what is fair even in posts about unrelated stuff, I saw your question and thought *oh crap*
---
They just stay at the door... why???
---
The issue with Mettle of Man is that it punishes already weak killers and has next to no counters. MoM is basically a free Decisive Strike that everyone in the match can have and can severely impact the killer's time.
---
50 shades of Claudette.
---
Oh shit this is very true omg
---
I like to imagine that the score event "Times Up" would appear in stylish font after the match. No such I'm afraid
---
I hope so. Because I want to play on my switch and sell my ps4.
---
My twitch name is Ddooooffyy. I feel like this is my time to shine.
---
But I love seeing survivors get brutally killed by the entity...
---
Yeah but Legion was just Nurse meets Hillbilly with a snap out of it in different clothes. 
---
Plague was great but essentially huntress meets doctor with a side of trapper. They've been showing signs of crossbreeding lately
---
Myers still has his own music going for him. I play him just for that.
---
I read this in king of the hill voices.
---
YOU’LL NEVER SEE IT COMINGGGGGG
---
YOU’LL SEE THAT MY MIND IS TOO FAST FOR MY EYES

Fuck
---
If you think Puppers is toxic, I strongly suggest you stop playing this game. Any joy you get can not possibly outweigh the psychological damage other players existing must do to you, let alone if you actually have to play with real toxic players.
---
This a thousand times over. So many things are leagues above or below something. A skilled nurse player can make games a no contest, especially with something like an extra blink, Make Your Choice and such. But even the best Doctor will have lots of difficulty catching up to survivors and stopping progress.
---
David is SOOoooOoooo sexyyy
---
Seth Madan is nothing to do with Scream. The main character will be called Deion Elliot. New cast has already been announced for it, no mention of a "Sean Madan"
---
*_inhales_* PIG DLC ASH DLC AAAAAAAAND GHOSTFACE DLC
---
I agree with you on this. Tons of people run it but I never do. It's one of those situational perks that you often never get to use.
---
The two hottest characters in one? Don't mind if I do
---
Yeah it would be cool to have him but I understand not wanting to do it because of that
---
The game, the institute, both swamp maps and spirits map (forgot the name)
---
I like seeing it because I'm at University right now and it is finals week. I play on console which is at my parent's house. I live just off campus in my own apartment and didn't take the console as I don't want any distractions. When I have a couple breaks like now, I can think about if I want to look in the shrine. There is also the reminder that something good may pop up in case I forget to look in the shrine which happens sometimes. So like the other person said before me, anyone that can't play at this moment really appreciates these.
---
i freaking love puppers. and i'll kill everyone who attempts to hurt him.
---
There is no survivor I think because everything leaked but there was no survivor. And I think they would first make the survivor instead of the cosmetics for Ghostface
---
The worst change was that traps doesn't stop survivors from running out.
---
TJ Torbert seems to only have the rights for the Ghostface Mask. So probably different IP for Scream.
---
I dunno man, seems too early to say anything yet. It's entirely possible they named these add ons the way they did to throw off any potential leaks. We'll all know soon enough, anyway.
---
Yeah the game was fun, he was’t toxic he didn’t camp or tunnel so the game was fun
---
Could the killer always body block by standing on the hatch? I've never know it to be the case before.
---
Anyone else having a bad time trying to find a game that isn't 300+ ping after this patch? I'm in NA not Oceania, I don't want to feel their pain. Not sure if dedicated servers are live with this update, but they're f-ing garbage if so.
---
Time for that halloween 2018 skim for myers!
---
This is actually incorrect
---
Survival rate is at 80% at rank one because if you escape you either safety pipped or pipped which means you stayed at rank 1, if you died you probably depipped which means you are at rank 2 now.
---
You listed the most irrelevant stat to try and make a point that survivors are still strong, how about the stat where the *lowest* kill rates on a killer were still 50%, with the only exception being console nurse. Killer is braindead easy now.
---
Depends on the players
---
50% slower. Doesn't scale with multiple downs and or hooks.
---
I’m gonna make a macro so I can put this in all the endgame lobbies when I’m playing him
---
The Huntres did as expected and Fired her Orbital Ion cannon onto the survivors instantly flashing them into non existence with the searing aura of the entity casting down it's disapproving gaze from beyond it's mount Olympus sized mountain of souls.
---
So fucking relatable don’t worry Frank I heard you loud and clear
---
Wake Up got buffed without actually getting buffed. Opening the gates faster with the new endgame collapse is going to be a good advantage for a lone survivor
---
True, but only true with the nurse (possibly Billy). But the nurse also breaks pallets, walls, and floors. Nurse is not a fair 1-v-1 in a chase. 
---
For most of the killers, bopping a gen and then high tailing it out could work. Find the farthest gen and work on it. Gives you time. Even the Nurse Blinks take some time.
---
That perk is going to work wonders on sweaterboi, subject to the rework
---
It's a game changing perk. It's situational, but it can save you in moments where any other perk couldn't save you.
---
alright so clockwise we have a very good perk, a potentially good perk if buffed but now just completely useless, a really good perk aaaand a gutted perk? i don't think new Remember Me is that good but i can understand why they changed it because opening the exit gates with all 6 stacks would be a nightmare worse than self caring a sloppy butcher
---
For me I wait to see if anyone gets hooked Ive always had the mentality to try and save someone who is hooked even if I dont know them  its just me and them left but I still think it is balanced because it was kinda trash before but itll kinda suck to not be able to leave after pulling of a save
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
Feng already has that lmao
---
Sort of is. It is fuzzy. Definitely worth a grievance depending on how long it was. At least it informs the Devs there is an issue if they get multiple reports.
---
And right back to the baseless shit talk. I'd ask you to back that up but i already know your answer. 'LOL everything'
---
It really wasn’t a theoretical, it happened to me, got slugged and stun locked
---
Think weve done a pretty good job so far
---
It's never too late
---
nice, well welcome, hopefully you enjoy it and stick around. It can get frustrating at times but over all it's a pretty fun game and most people are friendly and will throw out a GG. Especially if you don't get caught up in the I'm a X Main and the devs clearly favor Y and balances the game for them" crap.   I'd suggest watching some of the better streamers, and it might help learn the game and some concepts faster. If you'd like a few suggestions i'll send you a PM as not to get into a pissing match about how X sucks and Y is better or blah blah. Some are good, some are good and educational, some are good but their fan\audience is garbage. 
---
Also, a fun little page that will let you practice skill checks: http://www.mistersyms.com/tools/gitgud/
---
Aimed right at the back of my goddamn skull ☠
---
no failing any skill check (even if another survivor does via healing or a generator) can wake you up.
---
darn.
---
It was fun for awhile but I didnt like instantly dying if you get grabbed then waiting 20 minutes to get any points hopefully they can get jason in dbd
---
What were you banned for in the first place
---
I liked this image, then I noticed the dancing Micheal in the corner. Now I love it.
---
This isn't a killer.
---
This is pure ,uncut, Colombian exported, high grade Bitch.
---
I told you I'm not arguing with stupid people.
---
His release release should happen in patch 3.0.0 ( becasue they accidentally leaked even the patch who should have him ), so he probably will come in September.
---
**ENEMY AC-130 ABOVE!**
---
I want to like the endgame collapse but killer closing hatch and then just refusing to down you, letting you open gate till 3rd light before grabbing you and then leaving you on the ground till the timer runs out is so toxic and happened multiple matches in a row
---
My personal top 3 horror heroes are, in no particular order, Laurie, Tommy Jarvis, and Sidney. Nancy and Ripley are *super* close, though.
---
Why isn't Freddy more "visible?"
---
Running blindly from a child's song isn't fun.  None of my killer tracking perks (alert, etc) function when outside of the dream state.  
---
Cloaked Wraith is semi visible. Freddy could have more of a wind/weather presence or something. Sucks.
---
isn't that really situational?
---
1 killer vs 1 killer vs 6 survivors would be great.
---
How about each survivor has a unique ability  dont see it being fair that survivors have a unique perk to them but killers wouldnt unless you left that out also killers have a unique ability yet survivors just have choosable items instead of stuff that fits their character like a healing ability you can trigger as claudette that has a cooldown or a faster vault speed for the next vault for meg cause she did hurdles or something just ideas off the top of my head the only problem is figuring out what would happen to items
---
You dont have to main Nurse to ignore loops. Theres also Spirit and Hag.
---
You know wear smartface?  You no smartface!
---
Will behaviour stick all these different lobby timers in their corn hole? Wait to see ping / Wait to join a new lobby. Do they think wasting people's time is a good idea?
---
I like how you add a spoiler flair but spoils it in the title
---
God forbid someone make a mistake in recollecting something, right.
---
Agreed
---
I was aware about the second part but not the exact percentage. I'm glad the dbd can be helpful instead of just toxic, thank you.
---
I cant believe no one has pointed out that with the old system, the hatch never would have even spawned in the first place with 5 generators undone, and the survivor would have been even more screwed than before end game collapse.
---
Yet half this thread is survivors complaining about end game collapse favoring killers, when this example is a straight up buff to the survivors chances?
---
I did this to a David but let him open the gates because David’s are cuties
---
Don't think you read any other comments. They only have rights to the mask. So they would make an original character. But we'll see what happens.
---
When jesus washed
---
They are
---
I mean, I did read the other comments, but there's absolutely no proof that they only have the mask rights yet.
---
They did, you’re just about 10 hours late.
---
Or maybe... shirtless myers
---
No look I'm toxic...
---
You found my reply first....
---
*D/C noise*
---
He does LOL you arenr imagin things
---
BHVR:  **Remember Me** would be to oppressive with the endgame collapse changes, so we had to literally saw its power in half.
---
Also BHVR:  **Blood Warden**?  I’m sorry, I don’t listen to heavy metal.  What’s that got to do with our video game, anyway?
---
&gt;Except the fact that killers keep getting nerfs while survivors get buffs
---
Delusion at its finest.
---
That's right. Arguing would mean adding something. You're just throwing a tantrum at this point.
---
My point exactly.
---
Wish they would at least use the old [halloween music](https://youtu.be/0m4AVjPt7tU) for him :/
---
he looks like he belongs in mortal kombat imo
---
I don't really think you understand what I'm saying. They have ALREADY announced the cast list for Season 3. There is NO mention of a Sean Madan. The bio also has NO connection to Scream whatsoever.
---
For reasons like this is why I love Reddit.
---
They called the Ash VS Evil dead a chapter on twitter... just search
---
The gate opened just as they died too
---
No that'd be you. I'm telling you I'm not arguing with stupid people, of course I'm not adding anything you moron.
---
Go fish for fights in another thread and fuck off.

David looks like daddy um hello

Oh yeah, kinda dumb to ask cuz you unhook yourself and the next time you get hooked is when you go to struggle
---
Dunno for some reason when I look back at the post I feel like I may of accidentally recreated a older post.
---
I guess it’s some kind of Deja Vu, pun was not intended.
---
^^^(Okay fine it was kind of intended.)
---
Nurse played to full potential &gt; Strong SWF group &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Strong Survivor team &gt; High tier Killers &gt; Good Survivors &gt; Weak Killers &gt; Bas Survivors
---
Nurse mains shaking their head at you..
---
What. About. It? If they only have rights to the mask, they can't use characters from the tv show so they'll have to make an original character.
---
I do suspect that the Ash one was probably a real accidental leak, considering it was tucked away in KYF and everything about it functioned. You dont leak stuff by just putting it into the game early. 
---
Ghost face probably more intentional with all the incomplete art assets.
---
I actually don't mind that is not a known cannon SCREAM killer/character, I just wanted a Ghostface killer
---
So it's Ghostface but not Ghostface
---
Like how Billy is leatherface but not leatherface
---
Honestly best thing ive seen today
---
You mean long dick Johansen
---
We have 
---
Have you been living under a rock?
---
Where is the evidence that they only have the mask rights? How is a chapter called "Moan of the Moon" that alludes to Werewolves related to Scream at all?
---
Jesus Christ, you seem defensive over a leak that has absolutely no credence.
---
You have to play it yourself to understand, it just feel better. Subtle thing.
---
I feel like they are leaking on purpose to build hype. It's working.
---
Did he say that looping is an exploit?
---
OMG I LOVE IT! Love how killers have themes now.
---
For #2 wouldn't the exit be closed already once you hook them? Even if you have distortion the effect of blood warden is instant is it not?
---
*leans past school wall* Pssst, get kid, want some drugs?

Daddy Myers will be watching you ;0
---
Great. My childhood nightmare coming back.
---
I'm a habitual ragequitter. How do I stop myself? Honest question. I want to stop ruining peoples' games.
---
Very probably. 2 leaks in 2 months ? Something is suspicious here.
---
Yea fair enough
---
I'm not getting defensive. The evidence is pretty obvious. They don't use any of the ghostface outfits, only use the mask from the mask creators. The devil mask was made by the creators. They have the rights from the original ghostface mask creators. The dlc is more than likely not scream related. And I was just posting the photo to see what other people thought. You can leave now.

how are they punished by you doing a generator? it doesn't affect the killer at all if you go a gen...
---
The Chainsaw Myers combo from 2016 would like a word
---
Do you think I'm the person you were initially talking to?
---
Smae I came in just as clown was added. I knew about the whole theme but my brother actually thought the clown's theme was the main.
---
urban evasion
---
This is just Myers mixed with Pig...
---
They should have written them in all chapital letters
---
I feel like I'm playing the clown, not a bunch of teenagers hyped up on Adderall and mob mentality. Detective Tapp and Jane look like professional parkour athletes compared to how you trudge along and scoot yourself over pallets. And for what? A quick hit and then you Decisive Strike yourself in order to actually be in a stance that can down them?
---
With old Legion at least if you played "good", you probably caused enough mayhem to earn the points to safety. Now you might as well just play Spirit because she's extremely similar but infinitely better:  
---
Pros:
---
* Spirit's power recharges 5 seconds faster than Legions, along with making you invisible and move faster.
---
* Spirit has a smaller terror radius.
---
* Spirit has a passive ability that makes it hard to tell if she's vaulted a window, or made a slight juke left or right.
---
* Spirit can mindgame like no other.
---
Cons:
---
* Spirit is 110ms, while Legion is now 115ms.
---
* You can't see blood or the Survivors themselves while using your power.  
---
Legions Pro:
---
* If you hit someone with your power, you get reading of where other nearby Survivors are.
---
* You can use your power to jog across the map.
---
* You can annoy and stall Survivors for a few seconds if you hit them with your power then leave the area.
---
* You can vault pallets(and windows).
---
* You can't see blood, scratchmarks, or hear much of anything while using your power.
---
* Any speed you gained from vaulting a pallet is immediately lost as you only saved 1.35 seconds by vaulting it, cost yourself 4 seconds to come out of Feral Frenzy, and assuming you break the pallet later in the game another 2.7 seconds spent breaking it. And don't forget if you vault the pallet after you've already hit them with Deep Wound and they chose to loop instead of break away, congratulations you've accomplished nothing at all and would have been better off just smashing the pallet.
---
* You lose 10 seconds worth of Feral Frenzy for hitting someone with a standard M1, and lose all of it for missing once with a Feral Frenzy stab. Worried about that David dashing forward and denying you a hit, thus dropping you into a 4 second stun? Don't be you weren't going to accomplish *anything* by stabbing an injured survivor anyways you dolt.
---
* Your power does not end chases quicker, a fast-track ticket to the lower tier list.
---
i made this same exact post but ok
---
Nope. You're just here all on your own for no reason expecting a different response.
---
Yea fair enough, simply making it so killer just flat out can't 'body block' the hatch would really help
---
I so understand why the killer was doing that.
---
After YEARS of some asshole survivor deciding to fuck with the killer by just sneaking around the map, crouching from locker to locker, trying to get the killer to just leave the game in frustration and forfeit his/her well earned blood points, Killers now have the ability do give these survivors some of their own medicine.
---
Remember that this is only possible if the Killer already took care all the survivors but one. AND generators are not done yet. AND he needs to find the hatch first.
---
And EVEN THEN, the survivor can at least still has objectives left, repair gens to either get the killer of the hatch, or make him close it and then open the exit gates.   
---
The toxic part of the survivor community that loves bullying Killers every chance they get brought this upon you.
---
Don't you fuckers EVEN DARE to suggest that this is unfair. 
---
I would be surprised this happens in more than 1% of all games played to the extent shown in this video.   
---
Whereas I had 1 in every 10 games over the last week where survivors refused to engage in gameplay and just tried to make me quit the game.
---
Because she got nerfed into the fucking ground #####lmao
---
Yes but when it does happen it can really help you and your team out
---
Not really a point in having the picture be a spoiler if the spoiler is in your title
---
Are you incapable of any reading comprehension?
---
The evidence is circumstancial, is what you meant to say. Yeah, it might be the case, but you're acting as if it's 100% confirmed.
---
"You can leave now"
---
Yeah, you're definitely way too defensive about it. Nobody thinks you're a wise ass who just won the argument, you just look like an infant with the debate skills of a social reject.
---
Yea just here trying to encourage you to not be insulting and name calling. It's unnecessary.
---
no ed
---
Finally we will see blood Wonder again being used
---
Yep thats uh, yeah, thats pretty much it.
---
Not what we need, but what we deserve.
---
I mean it looks like he's drawn to be scared just like the others, chill man xD It's a cute/funny drawing, it doesn't take away from the actual characters, it's just someone's idea.
---
It's cool and all, but I still wish we could just choose one theme and have it applied to everything.
---
God. Will you leave it and me alone. Like I said, I was posting it to see what others thought, not to get into an argument.
---
&gt; After YEARS of some asshole survivor deciding to fuck with the killer by just sneaking around the map, crouching from locker to locker, trying to get the killer to just leave the game in frustration and forfeit his/her well earned blood points, Killers now have the ability do give these survivors some of their own medicine. 
---
killers can trap survivors in the basement. Doctor can have a build that makes generators impossible to do. The trapper used to be able to put 2 traps down and juggle survivors into them getting repeated trapped survivors and pick up points.  
---
STFU toxicity doesn't come from survivors and it doesn't come from killers. It comes from players in general.  
---
2 wrongs make a right to 5 year olds.
---
Well, don't act like a cunt in the responses then. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
---
I’m was a Bubba-main so I guess you can say I’m definitely not smartface.
---
Same with R6, but it punishes you further in hopes that you won’t do it again.
---
Okay 😂
---
Hooking someone just blocks off the exits. You can always see their auras when they're standing in the exit area.
---
Its good, but its 420 upvotes...
---
BHVR has to receive approval and likely even pay *extra* to license owners in order to create cosmetics for licensed characters.
---
Ehm... well i hope youre better now lol
---
Legion got a nerf/buff that makes him less annoying to play against. Lets stop the legion bullying
---
they both (almost) never happen so kinda useless
---
they didn't want it to take forever, they just wanted to mori you. the other survivors weren't mori'd, so the nurse probably only had the "you can kill the last survivor by your hand" mori.
---
I wish that closing the hatch would just insta-kill the last survivor because every hatch game I've played since EGC has resulted in me getting tbagged by the killer while they wait for the grey timer to run out.
---
The perk 'Poised' hides scratch marks up to 12 seconds when a gen finishes and 'Dance With Me' hides scratch marks for 3 seconds after a survivor fast vaults, maybe they were running these perks?
---
Is it bad that I heard Saminations Trapper voice while reading that?
---
&gt;The hatch was never meant to be a free escape to the survivor, just a second chance. It's working as intended now.
---
Did you even read the part?
---
I missed it?
---
It is. But they're licensed movie characters and Ghostface's "thing" is that he's a copycat killer based on horror movies so it makes a bit of sense that he's essentially just mashing together the powers of horror movie characters.
---
If Billy were wearing an authentic Leatherface mask- yes. 👍
---
# *[FETISH UNLOCKED]*
---
Me neither, they have room to make him fit better into the game and the option for cosmetics.
---
Again you try the 'NO U!!!' defense without success. I still have a point standing that you failed to counter. So can you guess who is acting like a sore loser here? I'm betting 5 bucks that you can't
---
Ok yea I realize that now I was thinking of something else for w/e reason. Thx.
---
His normal face already looks that way I thought he had a mask when I first saw him
---
my volume is loud as hell ash does not talk anymore
---
Honestly I just got the fuck over the hatch stand offs and would just go for it to begin with killer or not just to get into another game.
---
But we have kiddies that think this game needs to be try harded.
---
it's a worse stand off because in the previous iteration, both players had the ability to end the stand off with a win, the survivor by risking a jump and the killer by making a grab, whereas in this scenario the killer is blocking the survivor entirely from being able to do anything...
---
Thb, this is a non issue because it’s a dynamic that happens in every game that punishes people who leave early.
---
Your problem is that you feel entitled to still having options when the killer found the hatch first.
---
If a survivor finds the hatch first, there are no options left for the killer, the game just ends. You at least have the chance to camp exit gates or do a gen.
---
You are SUPPOSED to have it rough when the killer finds the hatch first.
---
are you living under a rock
---
Ah wait I almost positive killers could block the hatch like this before, am I remembering that wrong?
---
There is a perk called "Simple Formula" which is a direct nod to the first movie but still we can't be sure of this situation until behaviour clarifies it.
---
They look like George and Lennie from "Of Mice and Men".
---
HATCH STANDOFFS ARE NEVER NECESSARY! Just go do gens until the killer decides to actually try to kill you.
---
Yeah and if you not 4k its not the World
---
Minimum for 1080p 60+ fps gaming for the last few years has been 16gb of ram.  Nothing in the config file is gonna score you extra frames when your choke point is the ram.  I know what the specs on steam say, but trust me on this one, I used to run 8gb in a small travel pc and it was barely enough for DBD.  The price of ram has really come down in the last 6 months too.
---
Poor dude immediately got downed in the shed lol
---
Had they just stayed and healed me they would have been fine lol
---
Now you sound like a broken record.
---
But it is nice to know you're valuing my intelligence, since you don't argue with stupid people while clearly trying to argue with me.
---
It’s sad because they’ll probably never get the rights to him. Those greedy bastards.
---
Maybe at rank 15.
---
Or you could just get over not getting a 4k.
---
Absolutely not. This is a leak. The official announcement isn’t even supposed to come until May 28th. Then he’ll probably release 2-3 weeks after that.
---
I pronounce it learies.
---
Maybe you'll get it through your head eventually ya know
---
They called Ash vs Evil Dead a chapter on Twitter too
---
I would kill to see her in The Billy puppet mask. That shit **menacing**
---
honestly if you are not playing SWF, playing as a survivor is just awful. nobody is even attempting to win anymore, the likelihood of escaping in randoms is so extremely low now that people it's now become a bloodpoint farm game instead.
---
Agreed. Aesthetics alone it's top fuckng notch.
---
Definitely expect nods to the film series but I wouldn’t expect anything they could be sued over.
---
The fact that you're still replying to me says otherwise.
---
What are you playing on?
---
Especially saying well played after he was farmed.
---
OK pc they just have a program run that simulates a pressed key.
---
Remember you'll still get bp at the end of the game if you don't rage quit no matter what the situation. Always better than zero.
---
Trapper can throw hatchets?
---
maps also change everyting. Amanda's letter Piggy on the game is totally different from cold wind farm.
---
Ofcourse, and constantly making that face and noise.
---
An 8 second reduction? That's really not as bad as you make it sound. It's no different than 99% healing yourself and using Resilience.
---
I highly doubt shirtless Myers will ever be a thing lmao. I can’t really see the license holders of Halloween allowing cosmetics that aren’t connected to the lore of the film.
---
The main ones I was referring to were:
---
Chase music being too loud.
---
Being unable to hear hurt Survivors.
---
Footsteps being silent for both sides.
---
And we have a winner!!
---
Best part of Scream is that that was unscripted, he accidentally got hit with the phone and said that and they just kept it cos it fit so well.
---
If you insist, have a good one and I hope you bit a bit less insulting when making your points :)
---
It feels so negligible, though — I've tried using BP as motivation to stay before, but it's just not enough of an incentive.
---
Fuck off :)
---
No need for spoiler tag if the killer is in the title
---
Also possible the survivor/ map could be original, since if the killer's not from the movies, they'd need to make them a backstory anyway.
---
8 seconds per generator, mind you. That's 24 seconds, 40 if the last 2 gens are in good spots, with the last guy at a gate. That's a massive benefit for any good SWF team
---
Sadly the outfit probably backs this up, "Ghostface" has always worn black robes, and this seems like an attempt at similiar-but-legally-distinct.
---
I imagine getting the rights to both the character AND the mask would've been expensive, and difficult, or the TV show would probably have had both.
---
"The Trapper!
---
Jazz, jazz hands!"
---
Nice play. But I can't up vote this if your gonna use insidious.
---
But that was the point of the post wasn’t it? It was off-putting because the response was positive despite the circumstances.
---
I'mma count to 5 and this shit better be deleted
---
why does it look like larry’s getting fucked in the ass and he’s enjoying it
---
Sadly I see blood warden being nerfed soon big time. I'm surprised they didn't nerf it to begin with when the end game ptb was announced.
---
The owners of Scream, Dimension Films, came to an agreement with Fun World. Iirc.
---
It's worth noting that Scream and the Ghostface character are owned by DF, while FW own the mask and general appearance.
---
That's why Ghostface looks different in the Netflix series. But I've heard that there's a 3rd season in the works, and that will feature the classic mask.
---
It's possible this Chapter will be tied into the show, rather than the movies.
---
I play on xbox and i like it. But i play on pc still for the full experience. Xbox is fine. Just remember to turn off messages from not friends.
---
Darn
---
Ah, never really thought of the multiplicative value of team stacking it. That makes is good at best as stacking a gen negates the value, though the 24 seconds definitely makes killer snowball a lot harder early game with reduced time.
---
How do I 360 when close to the killer? (Pc)
---
They also buffed her again
---
If they're gonna do Ghostface, just do the original. The original is the best.
---
LOOKING GOOD CLOWN!
---
You realise it takes a lot more time to make a Killer than a Survivor?
---
They do everything for the Killer, then do the Survivor.
---
It's the general thought process of this sub. Insult the people making this game = easy karma. It's sad.
---
I will definitely get to it at some point in the future, but plague is weird to me as I still can't figuer out what her best playstile is. I also only played her while getting her teachable perks or with daily challenges. I'd also like to redo certain killers as I have more experience with some of them.
---
 There's Margaret Duval (Maggy) in the TV show.
---
The Gainesville Ripper, which inspired the creation of the scream franchise murdered 5 students within 4 days in Gainesville, Florida.
---
Yeah. Ashes death by daylight booth lined up too well.
---
Or just meta perks since flashlights are bad
---
That was perfect. Best rendition yet.
---
I coulda sworn this was a direct interaction between sarge grif and simmons
---
Spoke to him on his streams a few times, genuinely nice guy and an excellent player
---
In a game of cat an mouse, saying a mouse is BM just says worlds about the cat.

do you know da wae to where dead memes go to die
---
If only if only my friend
---
Not yet, sadly
---
*caresses mask longingly*
---
Holy shit. If I use this with my Hag and get 4 tokens I could get a 0m terror radius!
---
It’s possible but I wouldn’t get my hopes up.
---
R.J. Torbert, of Fun World, has written a couple of books featuring GhostFace that are unrelated to the film series. The film character and the mask/character/name are owned by two separate companies. They’re basically two completely dofferent characters. It’s more likely Dead by Daylight’s version is unrelated to Scream outside of appearance and maybe a couple of nods here and there.
---
You're trying to patronize and it doesn't work. I'm fed up with people trying to defend BHVR, which clearly doesn't even know what they're doing. Can't wait for them to get actual concurrence.
---
Its not gonna be for a while id forget about it till they actually announce it
---
"accidentally"
---
I would suggest playing more of survivor. It's really helpful to know how the survivors play, because it will make tracking easier even without good perks. Then, when you'll get some decent perks, it will help you even more and slowly, you'll get better. It's important to note, that it's a completely different game to play against someone, who really knows what he's doing.
---
Remember when self care used to arguably be the all around best survivor perk and sprint burst was best exhaustion? Pepperidge farms remembers.
---
Huntress, Wraith and Feng Min are my 3 favorite survivors
---
Id prefer it be like this rather than they just hide at endgame
---
He has had enough of getting chased
---
This is true art
---
Around 8-15 june, 3 months after Demise of tge Faithful chapter release.
---
Fuck off I told the absolute truth asshole, you are the one full of shit!
---
Fuck yes, Monitor. As a Myers main, this is perfect- Monitor and Abuse plus Dead Rabbit makes it so Tier 2 has a tiny as fuck terror radius.
---
Haven't dealt with it as a survivor.
---
Hey btw all you jerks disliking a legitimate bug I experience, enjoy sucking the devs cocks for new bugged to hell content that you pay for, I for one refuse to put another cent in this broken ass game till they do a major overhaul of all the bugs, have fun being slaves to your blind desires to buy broken merchandise just because you believe the bullshit they feed you with every patch! Oh yeah 1 more thing I experienced a new bug I never have before my first time joining a new lobby after this new patch, the bosses of the devs dont care about you and whitewash every new patch with bullshit bug fixes that only introduce new and old bugs that were fixed in some previous patch! I loved this game and it frankly pisses me off to be treated like shit by bhvr by focusing more on giving us mediocre content rather than do a major fix of the base coding od this 3 year old game!
---
99% the doors until you're sure the team is ready to get out. If the killer opens a door, you absolutely need to GTFO because there's a good chance they're some kind of endgame build you don't want to deal with.
---
One other thing: part of the reason the play in OP worked is because Jane was on death hook. If she was still rescuable, the timer would have gone down much slower and the rest of the team probably still would have gotten out. This means keeping track of when your fellow survivors are on death hook is much more important, which to me is an important skill so I'm glad it's becoming something that really matters
---
Thanks :) sorry for all the questions.. Any addons you recommend on Legion? I totally forgot its cake day for me!
---
For real, I am tired of using meta perks. This would be fun and useful as hell.
---
Considering you only see bubbas once in a blue moon, 1/5 ain't bad overall.
---
I'd say the terror radius should stay considering his standard speed, but otherwise this looks good
---
But they get a dunce trapper.
---
Because everyone has their game open at all times, right?
---
Well played but wtf are you running insidious?
---
“wHo sTiLl uSeS selF cAre”
---
People that play solo survivor. We still exist btw
---
She just gave up lmao.
---
NOED should not activate if you ask me
---
And they're stylish, modern outfits, too! This will be the first time I pay with my own real money for cosmetics.
---
Piggy best girl
---
Was it fun for the person whose game you deliberately ended early?
---
If you can't get a legitimate tombstone kill then you don't deserve the kill.
---
Yesterday I was leveling her up and made her P1 and when I saw the t-shirt i said '' welp this was a waste of time ''
---
I think he gets the exposed status on only the person he stalks and not all 4 survivors, that's my guess
---
Tryh camper
---
I mean, self care cannot proc if you're sprinting. So the fact that you get it at every pallet means you're standing still at them, which, to be honest, wouldn't be shocking
---
Hate that movie, but damn if the reference doesn’t make me laugh.
---
I mean he didnt sound mad more cursing his luck. You came across like a superior dick honestly
---
Don’t mind. 
---
I think good add ons make some killers a little too good. 
---
Cooldown legion is still the best imo so any of his cooldown add ons. 
---
The button that applies the broken status is a great one. 
---
Increasing duration is always a plus. I don’t think any of them are bad.
---
You have to be honest it looks pretty cool
---
Is this some kind of a nerf for she being the entity?
---
Something very similar has happened at least
---
yes the teabag lol but seriously ya I fucked up i was running on no sleep ha
---
luckily no
---
Thanks for all your advice! I got my Susie with BBQ, Discordance, Nurses and Ruin.. but thinking maybe I should do Sloppy.
---
People are saying he's worse...they're completely wrong. Legion is MUCH better than before, and it's all credited to his increased walking speed. I don't get looped anymore nor do people insta DC.
---
Nice cosplay.
---
Then all I see is your room lmao.
---
Oh my no
---
He only has one perk finished and a lot of placeholders are used. I think it will be a while, freddys rework is most likely first.
---
Its gonna be like this for a few weeks. Itl stop after that
---
Becuase she got nerfed into the ground and the cosmetics are most likely auric cells only even after we payed for her in the first place
---
Fuck me, that’s the amount to level someone up to 40. Damn I want to get banned now.
---
That fucking scared me its 2:00 a.m ffs lol
---
Oh my Fucking god she was tea bagging me from the start bruh.....I thought okay I'm gonna do the other way around...
---
&gt;I mean dont tunnel and borrowed time doesnt matter
---
*dOnT tUnNeL*
---
The one of her wearing a red top is from the third movie. She’s literally wearing that outfit throughout whole movie.
---
F
---
I'm a simple man, I see good info I upvote
---
Sloppy is a staple, they have to heal now. 
---
I run M&amp;A with it. Plenty of other valid perks too. 
---
Could always run the enduring/spirit fury route.
---
I'm looking forward to trying him out again later on today :) I personally love playing Susie.
---
Ace gives off such strong "cool uncle" vibes
---
Rage quit your PC/console. Just stand up and leave the room. No incentive but it might be easier to stop doing it that way. I guess you’ll die anyway but that way it’s better overall
---
You also don't have to heal when there's 1-2 gens left
---
In terms of borrowed time yeah thays how you dont get hit by it or DS. Tunneling right now is so risky you must really really wanna ruin a survivors game to do it
---
People are entitled to their opinions, but there's no reason to harass some random dude they don't know. 
---
Some people are just pathetic.
---
Is your licensed killers translated as well?
---
Um read my original comment again; I have been playing this since beginning year 2, watching it on twitch since vanilla days before nurse and this bug was not in the game before they implemented the medium vault, presuming you know how I play this game is bullshit too btw..
---
I did this achievement when Nurse first came out, so it was super easy.
---
Most sutvivors will run away as soon as they hear the heartbeat, especially against a nurse. Try using tinkerer, and grabbing a survivor on a gen on totem outside of line of sight. 
---
If they can't see your blink trail and can't hear your heartbeat, you should be able to get a grab!
---
I honestly think Bubba needs some changes. I BARELY ever see anyone talk about some buffs or anything.
---
I loved that movie (Good job Michael Bay, can't believe I said that) So it's a yes for me.
---
Bills Here.
---
To be fair... if you DC/suicide on hook, you definitely aren't being good sport.
---
Thank you. 
---
I was wondering if someone had checked this but I was too lazy to look for it considering the amount of spam and click bait out there. 
---
I wish someone had also checked the game files for upcoming cosmetics, if Freddy had something changed in his mechanic / add-ons and if they could spot any change in every perk.
---
They are doing good updates its just that they are so slow on most of them PepeHands
---
┬┴┬┴┤ ͜ʖ ͡°) ├┬┴┬┴
---
I stressed me out why you didn’t jump in the hatch so much earlier.  You had so many opportunities lol
---
He does look like an inbred fish person, so I suppose the Speedos would fit with his character.
---
Yeah was kinda wondering about freddy too. They patched it too quick for anyone to check i guess.
---
idk about you but bloodpoint bonus (while useless in game) is ridiculously useful in helping to reduce the bloodweb grind
---
I don't have an issue with looping obviously some loops can be very annoying to deal with but it'd be even more boring for me to chase someone out in the open when I know I'm going to down them any moment. I think the issue with the annoying loops you just have to know when to break a chase against a really good survivor if you haven't injured them within about maybe 30 seconds, cut your losses, that is how you don't get looped for the duration of all gens, it is the difference between an experienced killer and a non experienced one.
---
\*Answers you question in a way that doesn't help your side of the argument\*
---

Yes, the game lost players on steam over it's lifetime, yes I am sure that they are people who have stopped to play the game. Either because they got bored of it or because they couldn't stand all the bugs. Here is a [statistic](https://steamcharts.com/app/381210#All) of the average amount of players in the game, and you can even see that it got a lot of ups and downs over the years but you can also see that the game was above 20k players four times. And the first one of these peaks was in mid 2018, the last one in January this year.  And even now the game got more players than it had in the beginning. And thats only for steam. There are still the console versions of the game and these weren't present when DBD got released. So yes: The last 3 month weren't as good as before but then again this was the time that the shit about Legion started. However that does not mean that the game is dying, it is doing fine. It gained extra players over the years and you usually can pinpoint the reason for these ups and downs on certain DLCs or patches.
---
Bodyblocking; Killer edition
---
Inb4 Clown's skin are Auric Cells only and I won't be able to get it.
---
Just a little heads up; Canon Leatherface doesn’t have a beard nor a nose. Strange, I know.
---
That'd be pretty awesome. 
---
(for non germans = "Der Schrei" would be "The Scream")
---
Hatch is a consolation prize anyway.
---
Also whether you're screwed depends on how close the gates are to each other. Which, I can't say I'm that fond of it, but I'd be lying if I said I'm not a little glad survivors finally get to directly feel the bullshit that happens in map generation. Maybe maps will get fixed now.
---
That would have done nothing. Blood Warden will stay up for the full 60 seconds, no matter if there is anyone hooked or not.
---
I'm sure he'll delete his comments out of downvote-shame shortly. It almost always happens once they reach 0 votes overall ;) strange how that works huh?
---
They already rework Freddy, calm.
---
"ARCHIMEDES?" - Herman Carter
---
He cutie boi
---
RBTs slowing the endgame timer is a great fix. So simple and everyone’s happy. Been saying this for weeks.
---
Does this mean we can get older Laurie Strode???
---
you had no business making leatherface that cute
---
He's actually better to play as, you still get that first nearly easy hit, but the best thing is the 115% movement speed. His power is still obviously on the sort of weak side but the movement speed makes up for it. And he doesn't feel as tunnel-y anymore.
---
So is “The ghost” going to be a license killer?

Don't forget Totem Lighthouse
---
oh my fucking god, this is glorious!
---
this must be an old clip. also, why did you hit her on hook what she do?
---
Low-mid tier at best, in my opinion. 
---
He can get a easy first hit and stall a bit with his power, but after he get that first, he is as loopable as any M1 killer and he also doesn't have map pressure.
---
Those are from the movies though
---
Funny that they add remember me right after it got a nerf.
---
Monitor and Abuse is a must have, viable on almost every killer (not very viable on doctor which is funny since it is his teachable)
---
Bond is a decent survivor perk, might as well get it
---
No idea how strong remember me is at the moment, but I don't think it's very viable at the moment
---
Detectives hunch just isn't worth it in my opinion
---
Even if they have however many different teams the end result is all being put onto the ones who code it into the game. I totally understand why it takes forever. I mean if they have a separate team for bug fixes and a team for coding new mechanics then we should see things sooner. The biggest complaint I can come up with is sometimes we need a nerf or a buff and it takes forever for them to address it and implement a fix that some how maintains gameplay that's as close to balanced as possible.
---
Depends on 3 factors:
---
-general skill of all the players in the lobby
---
-which killer is being played
---
-the map
---
The higher in skill you go the more survivor-sided it becomes, but also with map and the killer taken to account the killer can still have an edge.
---
Except he wasn’t an asshole about it
---
I personally think it has gotten better but not with this patch, from before. Most I might wait for a game is maybe a few minutes. Rarely five minutes. I cannot speak on behalf of swf as I hardly play with friends but for the times I have the longest I have waited for was a few minutes. My killer matches are thankfully pretty quick get survivors in my lobby filled with a minute or less.
---
&gt; Yeah because every single time the hatch spawned before this patch, you found it without fail.
---
no, but i had a much, much, much better shot at it, which is all that matters.
---
&gt; The reason they changed it to spawn at last survivor is also NOT in favor of killers.
---
rofl! this whole update is literally entirely about making it so killers do not have to wait around for longer than 2 minutes at endgame. killers have to wait around for much longer than 2 minutes when survivors have to fix several gens in order to make the hatch spawn, therefore the devs are just making it spawn immediately. you are a halfwit if you think they did it to help out survivors.
---
Uhm... it was a very solid perk before the end gane collapse, but I doubt it's usefulness after it's nerf
---
Yeah, the gen requirement was as much a matter of security for non-partied survivors as it was for killers doing well.
---
So many times I've watched a really, REALLY awful teammate as I die and gone "well at least there's still 4 gens left, you fucked us but you don't get to escape cos you wouldn't contribute." That's a toss up now.
---
I dont care and wont waste my time reading all that, have a nice day 😉
---
pig is getting cosmetics soon
---
My advice is to just stop taking the game so seriously and you'll have a lot more fun. And if certain perks bother you so much just counter them as pretty much every perk not named Mettle of Man has a counter or isn't strong enough to warrant a counter. Hate detection perks? Run Distortion, a highly underrated perk. Not good at looping, run perks that allow you to evade (Spine Chill, Alert, Distortion, Urban). Sloppy is just whatever, so it takes longer to heal, not that big of a deal. Neither survivors or killers are OP. SWF is very strong but not OP. It's just a game, it's a far from perfect game but balance is a tough thing to do and Behavior is doing a decent job at it. You're not gonna win them all you're not gonna lose them all. One killer can ruin a survivors entire game by camping and tunneling. A group of survivors can make the game annoying for killers. It happens. Just move on to the next game.
---
Now I want Smokey as Survivor.  
---
RUN BITCH, RUUUUUUUUUUUUN
---
And, it works.
---
Quick MCote! The Ecuadorians have him!!
---
Slow it down immensely though. Not double the time
---
If so then its kind of weak. Spine chill will fucking destroy him.
---
Bruh have you played this game?
---
Get Unnerving and BECOME ruin
---
Definitely not we want Sidney 🤗
---
It's a legitimate complaint. We don't tell people to unhook us right in front of killers. People just do it then we suffer and get tunneled and loose out on points and even can depip all because of a bad teammate and a killer looking to take advantage. From a strategic stand point yeah hard tunnels are the best option if you see it happen but it's not fun to be on the receiving end. I always punish the farmer and not the farmed. That's fair. If someone gets hooked and rebooked in the first two minutes they stay on thin ice the hole match. I'm not saying this is what you do but it's what happens to me.
---
The shitty TV version one. Season 3.
---
the problem is that the half of the community with a brain want the dlcs and cosmetics put on hold so they can make the actual game fun and enjoyable.
---
He's listed as "The Ghost" in game
---
You do realise none of these accidents are accidents, this shits all on purpose and designed to drag you back into the game by "omg omg its gonna be so cool". They're not the first company to do this either.
---
Ok but Bill Skarsgard is😥😍👅👅
---
I kind of feel like a kid who asked for legos and got like megablox instead
---
/u/VredditDownloader
---
I think Déjà Vu is actually a good and underrated perk. I'll admit that I almost never use the perk, but knowing which 3 generators are closest to each other is super handy, repairing the middle one allows you to spread out the generator progress. And spreading out generators drastically increases your chances of winning
---
It transfers the obsession to whoever unhooks them. Seems like it'll be easy to stack, and combo well with MYC; no more guessing about which survivor did the unhook and potentially going after the wrong person.
---
Do the graphics scale depending on a hardware survey, because it looks like that to me on low.
---
But they reduced the visuals for killers so they can track scratch marks.

working as intended
---
How many Spirit skins, which look all pretty similar anyway, do we need?
---
When you're cleansing a hex and suddenly hear whooshing
---
I'd say its more of a gaggle, a gaggle of dwights.
---
Endgame ingame
---
It took me 113 webs untill I finally got monitor and abuse tier 1 on Freddy, took me 114 to get tier 2 and 115 to get tier 3. If I could have gotten the perk earlier, I would have gotten it.
---
I think it will be like michael tier 1 where he can't be detected with detection perks. If not then he will suffer like no tomorrow against detection perks.
---
I feel very attacked
---
I agree with this. Let's get the campers and disconectors next. Make Dbd great again.
---
God bless murica
---
Bullying.exe
---
Dude if you don't care then why do you still bother to answer my comments?
---
I shouldn't really be judging a killer that isn't out yet but I'm worried he will be incredibly weak.
---
&gt;hidden perk
---
It slows down cleanse speed, it can't be hidden
---
It's likely he'll come someday. People point at the licensing changes stopping the F13th game, but new rights holders means new opportunities. Just gotta wait for things to settle.
---
A lot of survivors do this as killers who run thrill tend to hump there totems. This annoys the killer so he stops checking.
---
Its annoying maybe but its definitly not bannable
---
If theyre spamming the totem. Just go and kill them.
---
There were a handful of noises I noticed playing on the new update tonight.  Definitely something when I hooked people and another sound that seemed to persist at hooks after someone had been unhooked.  Maybe it's something to do with the entity?  I know they added more entity-related audio and whatnot to the killer's basement at some point (I didn't really play from about October-April) so maybe this is more of that.
---
Nurses become more common the higher your rank
---
Are you running a Windows Insider build? I heard that they cause some issues with EAC
---
There are perks that you can buy for 2000 iredescent shards each for killers you haven't bought or whose perks you haven't unlocked. Applies for survivors as well. 2 random perks for survivors,2 for killers,each week it refreshes.
---
&gt; If the killer opens a door, you absolutely need to GTFO  
---
This. The dude that is supposed to kill you opens the door right next to you? He is planning something. Don't stay around. Just get out of there.
---
Ah okok
---
Oh... I genuinely asked what's in the shrine... Like what perks in today's shrine.. Haha
---
&gt;Windows Insider build
---
Nope, haven't had a windows update for at least a week. Was playing yesterday fine with friends.
---
A totem that hasn't got a Hex perk linked to it is called a dull totem and it doesn't notify the killer. The sabotaging does, though.
---
Are you not able to jump in once the prompt shows up? Looks like you had a second.
---
Leatherface Is a PARAGRAPH not a DLC/Chapter.
---
PS4 and PC player checking in: on PC Nurse is the worst IMO...it’s rare to play against a monster Nurse on PS4 because her controls are kinda wonky so I would say old Legion there
---
I mean both are irritating but nurse at least takes some skill to use
---
Should've been more specific... Anyways, you can check the current shrine  on the dbd wiki, it is displayed there everytine it changes.
---
Don't have pc , thats why I asked
---
Yeah. If you get off and run into a trap that really sucks but it's not like you had any control over who stepped in it after you set it.
---
Better grad every Bill I can!
---
&gt;if the killer doesn't move
---
Then you could literally tap your s key lightly every 30 seconds and wait out the full 2 minute timer.
---
Generators still exist. You can pressure gens and force them away from the hatch - obviously it's still in the killer's favour, but so is them taking the opportunity to close the hatch in the first place. It's way better than old hatch standoffs.
---
Nah, this is only the second hook
---
I rarely run into a nurse that isnt a high rank unless they are climbing after a rank reset.
---
It’s what ash calls himself in the show
---
What’s that perk at the bottom?
---
Make a Dunce score. The higher it goes, the worse the loot in the Web is. Also, at some point perk and addon slots start to close up
---
Were you running Dying Light? I noticed a DC, was it the obsession?
---
Probably because the nurse mains all easily make their way to the high ranks
---
imagine being triggered over someone being triggered that is being triggered by sarcasm thinking that its not funny in 2019
---
In most cases clicking your flashlight is to gain the killer's attention and an attempt to keep them on you, off your teammate's backs.
---
Oh ho. Secret Freddy buff. Now that he can close hatch while the survivor isn't in dream state, he's OP. Freddy rework is gonna be a second Freddy nerf. Now it takes 6 generators for a survivor to be pulled into the dream state.
---
Huntress
---
I’m out of the loop, what’s happening to Freddy?
---
You can try reinstalling EAC, that is a pretty simple way to repair issues like this.
---
to do this go to - steam\steamapps\common\Dead by Daylight\EasyAntiCheat
---
Then click easyanticheatsetup.exe
---
select dead by daylight from the dropdown if it is not already chosen and click install.
---
This should fix the issue in addition it's a good shout to run DBD as an admin.
---
Hope that helped!
---
I feel like it should still be that traps automatically activate after all generators are finished. If the hatch closes, the rest of the generators don't finish and you can still escape and if you get a trap in the end game, you should have enough time to get it off, especially if the survivors 99% the gate
---
I can definitely transition from "hating Legion because they're boring and exploitative" to "hating Legion because they're now somehow just even more boring."
---
I don't think many survivors realised they removed the hatch animation grab ability from killers. She was pretty much guaranteed the hatch until she stalled at it thinking it was going to be like na old hatch standoff.
---
Our Granpa, Ashley J. Williams, is Mute! - Lois Griffin
---
I had a problem but with a different message tho. Find the folder where dead by daylight is located and delete the EAC folder in it. Then, open steam, right click dead by daylight in your library and go on properties. Then let it check for missing files, you should find it in the "local files" tab. It should then restore 44 files or so.
---
(sorry for the unclear answer, was typing fast cuz I got no time right now :d )
---
Ladies and gentlemen, a new way for people to be toxic
---
I was all the way on the other side of the map and only heard it once all night long. That, and that I 100% didn't like it.
---
Freddy is like a Chihuahua, small and vicious. Being small, he will find the weakest link and assert his aggression to not be bottom of the food chain. Legion is that link.
---
When crouch
---
I forgot that the killers could open the gates themself
---
It's in the game files
---
Imo legion was really boring to play as and against, since his whole playsyle involved just walking in a straight line and using feral frenzy when ready. You didn't have to mindgame as him and you had no counter against him. He was just going to down you really slowly and there was nothing fun you could do.
---
At least nurse has an interesting playstyle and requires skill. You can also dodge a nurse attack, while you couldn't with old legion. 
---
Nurse is a lot more powerfull than old legion,  but at least you actually played the game against her and it is fun to play as her
---
it only just slows the game down ***a lil bit***
---
I said move a certain distance. As a survivor you need to move about 10 feet or take an action to not get crows. The basement stairs would not be large enough for that.
---
Yeah, someone else is saying it has something to do with hooking. But I only heard it once all night long, and it wasn't even a basement hook, so I'm still confused and concerned. ^Also ^the ^gens ^^sound ^^like ^^poop ^^now.
---
I was a Legion main for about a month after he came out. I always did well, and I _never_ just tunneled one survivor (at least, not once I learned how to use them properly.) Legion was actually really fun before, when played properly, and now it feels really bad honestly. It feels like instead of going in with a scalpel to remove and fix the broken parts they used a shotgun and now it's all "fixed." I get it, they were broken if you used them a certain way before, but I wish they didn't nerf them for the people who played them properly to begin with.
---
why not? i’ve got every unlocked.
---
Swamp is the most bugged.
---
Every update contains several bugfixes for swamp maps.
---
Most unbalanced in favour of survivor are probably: Haddonfield, Torment Creek and Thompson's House.
---
Most unbalanced in favour of a generic killer are: Azarov's resting place and Coal tower.
---
But unlike survivors each killer can have a particular map that's better for them.
---
I firmly believe in seperating art from artist, but if the rights are still owned by _him_ and not a production company or publisher then yeah I can see why they won't use them.
---
It's not bad to play to win, it's bad if you win/lose just to be a dick about it. I mean, yes, you just moved petite asian girl gamer tru the gate and escaped burned guy in a fedora. It's not a life achievement, taking it way too seriously to the point of mocking others is just laughable...
---
Uhh... [stealing isn't cool](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ad0s0j/optimisation_p_a_s_s/).
---
They absolutely could block hatch in the past, yes.
---
True, but Shape takes a bit of time to stalk for his one hit downs to be of use. Plus there is only a limited amount you can drain from any one person. So at the cost of time and a limited amount, Shape gets lasting and shared exposure.
---
Ghost could be MUCH faster at stalking and be able to do it infinitely, at the cost of a more targeted exposure.
---
As always, I need to play him to know anything other than guesses. But if I'm right then Ghost would fit nicely in DbD.
---
30 seconds off the timer without add-ons
---
Hex: Comeback would work better as an add-on instead of a perk.
---
This. Disregarding the fact that OP also had all the time in the world to look for Hex Totems (he could have assumed there is NOED) and just go for the Gens and try to outplay the Nurse.
---
But no, instead we have a thread full of baby whiners that demand their welfare benefits participation trophies back.
---
Shit community.
---
Looks sloppy, did you really pay for this or are you advertising yourself? They didn't even bother to color her right ear.
---
Aren't you a good marine mammal?

---
That had better not be a VERY RARE add on to add fucking HAEMMORHAGE.
---
"Bleeding" status had better mean Deep Wound or a complete rework of haemmorhage.
---
Ok, so:
---
Trapper cleans the blood with his bare tricep;
---
Wraith cleans it off with his own finger;
---
Nurse cleans it off with her own fingers;
---
Huntress cleans it also with his bare forearm;
---
Hag fucking drinks it;
---
Pig cleans it on her shroud;
---
Legion cleans it on their Jacket;
---
If anything this is mild.
---
He is unbearingly fake with his personality and straight up cringy when he becomes upset. Hard to watch someome who straight up flips his bipolar switch anytime he becomes stern with his chat. "Mods ban the idiot" "dont ask stupid questions" "you should know from my YouTube no one gives a shit about" are just a few examples and let's not forget his cringy ass fake smile as he tries to not seem like the dick he really is. Guy seriously hates dbd 90% of the time but isn't even entertaining like no0b3 or angrypug about it.
---
Hey buddy! I saw you commented something in this subreddit! Well, y'see, around here we don't say stuff like that. I'm sorry about all the confusion, though! If you follow me we can get this sorted out post~~mortem~~haste. :)
---
not sure where you’re going with this
---
I'm sorry but all I can see is Ray Gilette from Archer.
---
Good luck finding it before the Nurse who can teleport from one side of the map to the other, or Legion who rans faster then a marathon player, or the Spirit, Hilbilly etc.
---
If somebody read that without knowing this game, they would kind of confused about what phantoms could mean...
---
Nobody claimed it wasn't, and camping is not always face camping. This change removes the danger and reward of the basement. Now there isn't really a point to use it. Yet another shotgun patch by BHVR
---
What was the post-game chat like? This was legendary.
---
Her leather jacket costume looks pretty dope. Shame she's gutted.
---
If they are leaving for important reasons, this minor penalty wont matter at all.
---
I would be happy with old Myers and old Laurie.
---
Wait i already had this happen too. How long it tajes for the survivors to learn...
---
That's illegal.
---
Boy, you are blind. Her ear is coloured, unless you thought the fact her left ear is in the shadow was not coloured. Where is this slop you speak of? Seems pretty clean.
---
I think most of us love Scary Movie Ghostface more, lol.
---
Like, I know Scream is a classic, but it was just so boring to me.
---
Lol making it banable would be sorta stupid
---
Look at how they massacred my boy
---
Oh yeah it is a very unsettling sound. And when I said empty hooks I meant _all_ hooks, regardless of whether someone is on it or not.
---
Absolutely.
---
Amanda has also gone through some serious mental and emotional trauma and survived, so there's that aspect too considering that a good handful of the other survivors have gone through incredible grief, manipulation or abuse. Even though she's not a beefy or supernatural being, she's closer in the "clique" than Legion would be I think.
---
Fucking no lmao? He has one unfinished perk and a shit ton of work that needs to be done. Expect him next month or so
---
Because it was really strong for survivors.
---
Hit me more daddy but not to much
---
Dont forget for those who gentap.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Freddy is getting a complete gameplay rework/overhaul from the ground up. Basically deleting him and making him an entirely different killer. 
---
I'm worried the changes will make certain stuff I like about playing current Freddy not a thing anymore. Red Paint Brush + Monitor and Abuse = Mirror Myers 2.0 (Especially with a thickest mist offering, survivors will have trouble finding you in the fog.) Dream transition mindgames to loop and hit the survivor from the front when they're looking behind wondering where you're at. Abusing survivors trying to complete a gen or get a gen skillcheck in your face and grabbing them the second they're vulnerable, Pill Bottle to remove dream transition glimpses and do gen-grabs (And they usually won't get fooled again, so you can sleep them and watch them run around like a chicken with their head cut off thinking a non-existent freddy is going to grab them off the gen again like last time) etc.
---
I hardly really care about 4King with him every game or think he needs major buffs (Although he has massive flaws survivors can use to absolutely destroy them) because he plays a bit like doctor and I honestly enjoy playing as him.
---
Do these people not read the patch notes after an update?
---
Stealth killers are the most fun for survivors to go against. Myers is also my favourite killer purely for his jumpscare build.
---
On one hand that's a shame because this skin is great and I want it.
---
On the other it means less people have to suffer nightmares from it.
---
It's like a 115% movement speed jumpscare myers
---
The ears have different colors, the right one has the same color as the background
---
[The first outfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObTI_XTeRmQ) is what Amanda wears in the first movie when she's in her own game.
---
[The second,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyJgABoj1pk) as best as I can tell, is based on the fight outside the bathroom where she wears a leather jacket.
---
The masks are a little different because the pig masks weren't exactly unique to the people wearing them, but the second is a bit reminiscent of the one [Rigg wore briefly.](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/editor/tv/m8858uxkdlay.png)
---
Because you're an idiot who hasn't heard of something called a joke.
---
Not quite. She wore a red top, but the top with the detached sleeves is from Saw 1.
---
Can confirm it is a great feeling as killer knowing where the hatch is and being able to close. 1st game as killer since the collapse went live and I found where the hatch had spawned. Soon as the 3rd survivor was dead, you can bet I ran my ass over there to close it as soon as it opened.
---
Ah yes classic DBD subreddit culture...”Don’t agree with their opinion? Better downvote!”
---
Aye, I'm not saying he's going to be weak, I'm just always happy when it's your mistake/your fault when you get punished.
---
It feels really bad when you haven't been clensing vs Plague but your teammate does and screws you over, or when they feed Myers.
---
More like go play games that take days to finish because you're not gonna play on console any time soon!
---
The best part is that the timing was so close they would have been fine if they just left her on hook for a bit.
---
Well at least one of us tries to stay on topic then. Survivors finishing gens as fast as humanly possible is comparable to killer killing survivors as quickly as possible by re-hooking them right after they have been saved. Yes slugging can achieve that effect as well and it can be used on top of tunneling, but it is harder to pull off.
---
I love how nobody cares about Scream so Scary Movie can come tru.

Haven't played the game in a while, can someone explain what's that? And killers can now close the hatches? How?
---
Being a rank 1 survivor and a rank 4 killer (suck ass at killer) this speaks to me
---
30 seconds is still a pretty long time, and the endgame timer isn't slowed down when it's happening.
---
haha funi imag
---
It's drastically reduced for the killer, you may have only seen that version.
---
Oh. I didnt know that lol
---
It's severely reduced for the killer, only survivors see it like this.
---
I'd like it if the in game Quintin didn't look like a drug addict that's had a few close calls with a paper shredder
---
These are some hella good sound effects. Can't wait for them to add bruh sound effect #2.
---
to be fair the devs did have a pop up that said do not use it anymore until it is fixed. but ya it was stupid considering they could have just removed it from the game.
---
You mean of Killers?
---
Tried this, keep saying copyfile failed with 32
---
I knew I couldn't be the only one thinking the same thing.
---
People always try to look at things in a negative way, like it was not intended but happened anyway.
---
If it was intentional - to create hype - they surely achieved that, and the way they responded on twitter about this was IMO like "Some of you did see the 'accidentally' leaked chapter, which we are sure you can look up, btw. :)".
---
The hatch is more likely to spawn in certain areas. I don't remember them all atm but if you google you can find the areas where it's most likely to spawn. You're also faster than the survivor so you should be able to find it faster than them, but it's also reliant on luck.
---
Did this, didn't seem to work, it reinstalled all the files but it's still having the same issues.
---
Here's my guesses:
---
1: Removing you terror radius
---
2: Starting to stalk
---
3: Chase
---
4: ???
---
5: Exposed
---
6: ???
---
It would be funny but last time i checked the game's theme is light horror. so having emotes in the game would take away that aspect for me
---
"When you tell the joke but nobody heard it and your friend tells the same joke again but louder and everyone laughs"
---
Leatherface doesn't have a nose, but otherwise, good stuff (and material) as always.
---
And just as I unlocked all of the docs teachable :(
---
That's the sound that plays when blood warden activates and the killer has noed.
---
It's like they're doing it on purpose.
---
Same with Amanda though, she never used hers and if they brought out Hoffman with this bear trap that would be the pattern :D
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/blzkxi/sorry_to_kill_the_hype/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share I can't confirm they are real tho
---
Aren't the other three basically being manipulated by Frank? I seem to remember something in the lore saying that they're terrified of him.
---
That Saw 3 torn outfit though

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/blzkxi/sorry_to_kill_the_hype/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Here u go, can't conform they are real.
---
a timer on a trap that wouldn't go off doesn't seem particularly helpful for me personally
---
Happy cake day
---
i do see this as a problem but i do think the intent here are for the killers that disconnect when they see certain map offerings being played. as an example, Playing tier 1 myers using the lerys offering and seeing that your opponent used a coldwind offering so you disconnect to refund your lerys and not play coldwind.
---
Boring and not funny I don't get it why does everyone like this guy
---
He ain't my Jason
---
WE NEED TO ANALYSE THEM
---
Mmm, I wish we could use different heads. 
---
I'd use my p3 bloody pighead with this shirt and pants.

That would be horrible
---
I think its fake or is the new chapter called "moan of the moon"?

I'd love either of the masks from TCM the beginning:

Then you need to actually give ranked rewards, since otherwise sweaty mctryshard will just play casual for that sweet sweet reward of escaping or 4K.
---
if he had time to do that then you guys fucked up hardcore
---
You dont have to 4k. If you max deviousness anyway its no problem to let one go and dont get the 700 or what points
---
Amanda was 100% not on purpose. Got leaked by a playtester.
---
I thought it was the main music too at the time.
---
I want this more than anything else in the game.
---
Erm... I'm not downvoting you. Even if it was me, why do you care? Do you get something out of seeing people upvote your comment?
---
I'm still holding out hope that there's a chance of getting the remake's license. I'm pretty sure its not quite as tied up with the whole lawsuit thing, and remake Jason is dam good.
---
Always thought it's really unfair that the stackable BP bonus perk for killers is at the same time one of the best perks in the game, but for survivors it has absolutely no effect. I think it should have had the effect of we'll make it
---
Some of his garments are also floating suggesting he has a supernatural element, which of course Ghostface never had:( 
---
Sigh I guess we aren’t getting Sidney after all
---
Rank 2, let him get it lol, it takes all of 5 seconds of stalking.
---
Yeah but why would they make cosmetics for the killer first?
---
 
---
Yes. Because of shading. Look at her arms. This isn't a case of not being coloured, this is a case of being shaded.
---
Lmao nah
---
I mean, that's the point of downvote, lol
---
Er, I think that’s the shadow cause it’s being slightly covered by the hair.
---
He got it within 60 seconds of the match starting.
---
Thought they made it such that you can escape with inactive bear traps on your head?
---
Does activating EGC power gens and force the traps to activate?
---
Same for Mandy, really. first they nerfed her traps and removed one of the main reasons she was good, and now they introduced someone else who does the same thing as her with crouching and stuff
---
It's neat that Trapper's always thought of as the budget Jason but lorewise he's a total Norman Bates ripoff. Then Huntress has a bit more of the Jason character in her with having lost her mother and being trapped in a child's frame of mind.
---
Oh zip it you all, this was funny
---
And triggerd NOED instant....
---
Well you have the machete and the mask. The comparison is obvious  people read the lore?
---
Also freaking clown bottle breaking across the map.
---
Good observation!
---
You're probably right. I'm not afraid to admit I was wrong.
---
You fucked up hardcore, git gud baby survivor.
---
The best part of playing freddy is the mind games and corner ambushes. Even if I don't 4k you get so much points with him. Freddy is bae, I really hope they don't change him too much.
---
That might be true but its also much harder for the killer to take the game hostage. it actually fixed both issues. now that hatch spawns no matter how many gens are left if you are the last alive. if he closes hatch he starts the endgame collapse which means he no longer holds you hostage. if he finds you before closing the hatch and tries to bleed you out you are still not technically being held hostage forever. if he downs you and pick you up but dont hook you he cant do it forever since you wiggle of and can then jump into the hatch uncontested. so if the killer holds the game hostage its really your own fault. the killer also cant bodyblock the basement
---
It be like that
---
Only T2, Tier 3 takes over 40.
---
Simply because M1 Killers. Enough base movespeed and ya golden.
---
STAND IN AWE OF MY POWER TO PEAK AROUND CORNERS AND DESPAIR!
---
Then everybody would dc to be in those lobby since no one will be left in the normal lobbies lol just like deranking
---
Amanda's leak was the most excited I'd ever been for this game. Something about knowing the power but not the specifics adds a whole 'nother layer to the hype. It wouldv'e been better if we'd seen some ghostface teasers first though, they're gonna be really underwhelming when they happen now. Perhaps the teasers should be released early now.
---
Yeah, no. Locker players were locker players last patch too. If hatch doesn't spawn until at least 2 gens are done, that means all the killer can do is wait for the last survivor to nut up and do a generator, which is the most boring shit possible.
---
If you somehow repeatedly have idiots that wait for hatch, 1. take solace in the fact that they will not be ranking up because doing nothing then getting hatch doesn't get you enough emblem points and 2. rank up yourself by just playing as normal.
---
It's hard for him to get to tier 3 with red addons. That's on you, baby survivor. Gg ez.
---
&gt;the killer also cant bodyblock the basement
---
That's 100% incorrect
---
What perks do you use on her?
---
That was a paragraph, like Ash.
---
This game's truly going all out on becoming a microtransaction riddled cesspool of a mess.
---
&gt; I don't get looped anymore 
---
this would mean you're playing against poor survivors. Legion is still VERY loopable, he can't down you if he's in feral frenzy.
---
Imaging making yourself look this bad.
---
so im just going to dispute the points that you dislike.
---
- missed attacks depleting the legions power gauge. This change was neccesary for two reason. 1 was the bug that made him just swinging in frenzy move faster then just running with frenzy and 2. was that it felt as a survivor you couldnt punish the legion for missing a swing since he could just swing against instantly after missing.
---
 - You can remove the timer with frenzy, the change was made so that the legion wouldnt become a tunneling monster that he was and its a way to tell the legion player that using the power to injure and already injured survivor isnt the way he is designed to play.
---
- The survivor should have an ability to try to shake off the killer, so by making it so he cant see bloodstreams will give the survivor a chance to shake him off before all goes bad.
---
- increasing the terror radius is to balance out his MS, if you havent noticed most killers that are 4.6 m/s have a 32 meter terror radius while most 4.4 m/s killers have a 24 meter terror radius. its a way to give an earlier warning since he cant down you quicker with normal m1s.
---
- increasing the time it takes to fill feral frenzy is again to make it so that ppl use his power only to injure
---
- increased fatigue/cooldown time again to punish for missing a swing and give some wiggle room for survivor to get to a safe location
---
To be Sonic, be passive.
---
Googled it afterwards
---
No Mither
---
Plus he's not tall and doesn't breath loud like myers.
---
I love this so much! I bet you got hate mail from that survivor 😆 they are so salty at times.
---
Laurie should have jumped in when she was dancing by it. She did get there first but chose to twirl around instead.
---
Feels bad, man
---
Solidarity
---
Billy is also far more terrifying.
---
They can only open the gates if all gens are powered
---
It can happen as survivor too. Tbh map offerings should be like shrouds where if your map isn't picked, the offering is refunded.
---
My issue was my game crashed. I never disconnect on loading screen intentionally. I get infinite loading screens every once in a while but it always seems like I'm the unlucky guy who has their game flat out hard-freeze/crash on loading. Not getting my Mori or Bloody Party Streamers back just rubs salt in the wound.
---
I want Deputy Dewey cosmetics for Dwight or a whole new character!
---
His costume could have been more accurate.
---
I think it looks alright. It still has the tassely bits, which are the best part of the original costume.
---
In my opinion, the black cloak is sort of goofy and underwhelming as a costume anyway. It perfectly fit the movies, with the idea being that it's easy to put on and take off, and the flowing robes accentuated ghostface's frantic and sometimes comical movement, the movies were comedic as well after all. For DBD though, I think a redesign into something more imposing works. As long as it still has the mask as the focal point, it still carries the same essence.
---
No, I downvoted you because what you said is incredibly out of context for this game and adds absolutely nothing to the discussion. You can't really say that in a horror videogame where killers mutilate, gut, devour alive, impale, violently kill and puke to death people, when also other killers do this but tenfolds more gross and worse.
---
When I lost my legacy save files had just been switched to save on their servers. The sad thing is that I have like 40+ backups just in case I ever lost my progress but could no longer replace the save file once they saved the files on their servers.
---
As compensation from the Devs I was given 260 mill BP and had to manually spend it all again. Rant over. :/
---
It's so satisfying to watch since it's a CLAUDETTE
---
did you restart the game
---
BBQ is garbage though, just go in a locker when the killer picks someone up
---
Dead meme.fuck off op

Myers isn't trash even without any add-ons, Myers main here

i will qoute the patch notes here for you

Fixes and changes fomr the PTB 2.7.0
---
Balance
---
* reworked the character collision in the basement stairs to prevent hostage situations
---
Uhhh ok? Were you expecting some sort of medal or award? Bye bye sweaty

Same, I'll buy Kate Next monday so It will show in the shrine for you.
---
Nice to see a wholesome post about the devs every now and then. They may have some oopsies but we still love them
---
Legacy three
---
I know. I just needed to vent after that. Things finally go right in solo Que then here comes lag switch Legion. It honestly floored me. Didn't see it coming.
---
Probably he stalked the 3 of them without them be aware of that until it was too late so yeah, it was your teams fault. Is not broken unless your team fucked it up hugely, which is what happened. So bad luck getting into a game with a team who fucked everyone up.
---
GROOVY!
---
Yeah, and Ash was also an April Fool's joke too...
---
I feel like Nurse would have violin, and Doctor would have some crazy synth music.
---
Have truer words ever been spoken?
---
so there seem to be a feature or bug where it wont give you your offering back if you were the one that crashed or disconnected, and it is probably to stop people from dcing from moris and map offerings
---
Thanks :)
---
Wait shouldn't it be the other way around? The Spirit should forgive since she's a vengefull spirit or is the a drawing not related to her lore? Anyways well done, well done.
---
Myers has to stalk 2 and a half survivors fully to achieve Tier 3 with Tuft of hair. Next time, don’t stare at him and wonder why he is just watching you. HE IS NOT FARMING!
---
The face of the shape was the symbol on "The Ghost's" power. Clearly they don't have all the correct labels. It's fine to make your point, and trust me, I think Ghostface is boring as fuck, but you sound like a over confident dumbass with no clear proof, just speculation like everyone else. 
---
However, I respect ghostfaces popularity and am super excited for another big name licensed killer. Plus his power sounds dope and scary as fuck. Can't wait to see what this peaking around the corner looks like. Will be stocking up on my Pampers now I gues.
---
That looks so amazing! ❤
---
i know that its really frustrating and venting is always needed. i played against a lagswitcher during the double bp and vented in someones stream zubSMILE
---
This arguement is so trash it's not even funny. If the game is so un-enjoyable why are every single one of you still here instead of whinign on reddit every single day
---
Bamboozle for loops, BBQ for BP and finding survivors, Hex:Ruin and Overcharge for gen control. Gen rush is real with her because until you get corrupt purge the chases can take a while. I like add ons that increase the vile purge effectiveness to get survivors into broken stahe faster.
---
You just come across as smug imo
---
I’m more annoyed about it than you.
---
The body's still obviously Amanda, but it is neat that we can dress like Hoffman. Because of Legion we know they could make a cosmetic that actually makes her Hoffman or even John himself, but that would need new voices and would probably not work with the current license agreement.
---
Yo this shit right
---
I mean i have been playing from the day 1 and was speaking generally about the game, i feel they are doing that with it and the end game thing feels like that to me, just one step futher away
---
I can confirm that this man is an imposter.
---
That's what I'm hoping, only time will tell :D
---
At least he's good for farming BP and Overcharge can be fun at lower ranks. Still, that sucks though. :/
---
And it's somehow a problem with killer/add-ons design?
---
Victor Salva, Pedophile and Director of Jeepers Creepers...no way BHVR wants any connection to this guy. The fact he isn't rotting away in prison somewhere makes me ill. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Salva
---
**Victor Salva**
---
Victor Ronald Salva (born March 29, 1958) is an American filmmaker and convicted sex offender. He is best known for directing the films Powder (1995) and Jeepers Creepers (2001). The latter of these has been expanded into a franchise with two sequels that he has also directed.
---
His ongoing career in filmmaking became controversial after his conviction in 1988 for charges relating to his sexual abuse of a 12-year-old male actor who was starring in one of his films, Clownhouse, videotaping himself in the act of doing so, and possessing commercial videotapes and magazines containing child pornography.

Here we see a patch of wild Dwight’s
---
We are set to receive a chapter early next month according to the optimization road map and although Ghostface seems to just be a funworld license, there’s every possibility it’s just incomplete at this moment. Then again they could have an entirely different chapter ready and Ghostface is a paragraph for a few weeks after lol. Only time will tell
---
No they earn about vaping now. It’s the new hip thing.
---
It is intended and that’s because some people like inverted controls. You know u can probably just unbind the key in the settings.
---
I was like this guy might be on to something until you reached the part about angrypug lol
---
Talking about toolboxes, wtf is repair efficiency?
---
yes
---
This is art
---
He didn't see me once, idk what to tell ya.
---
2 weeks ago, good luck waiting for it again buddy :(
---
Who's the streamer?
---
Stolen like a piece of candy from a 1950s candy store.
---
Lmfao, you missed the point by a mile.  He's mid tier at best with no/low tier add ons, broken with the best add ons.
---
I remember this happening to me a few times when I first started playing and always thought it was some bug. Used to upset me so bad. Then I found out about the touchpad thing. It can be disabled in the options.
---
I love everything except for the upper body with the large mouth on it. it kills the "Nightmare" part of it and makes it seem silly.
---
So then I auto lose because my team is bad, at least I can rest assured there's nothing I can do.
---
Sweating 4k's like this is so damn boring lol
---
I feel like anyone who plays this game for chases (because they are good at them) doesn't bother sweating shit like this
---
I’m going to buy ash just because he is a character I like
---
Holy shit that was brutal.
---
Well this is fucking stupid. It basically gives the killer more power in the standoff -which still exists. Which is the whole reason for implementing end game collapse.
---
If there is a close mechanic, the killer should not be able to block the hatch without closing it - end of.
---
The map was a the Thompson house btw.
---
Well one of the men at least
---
You know what, I can kind of respect this if they had a daily. Nurse daily for mori; get it over with in one game and then finally switch to a fun killer. Sucks for one guy, win for everyone else.
---
Preach.
---
That one fucking locker next to the window in the Father Campbell's chapel... Grrrr.
---
Like I said not unplayable, but useless. I use him the same way I use the trapper.
---
That's a thing?  I guess I didn't pay attention to the description enough.  😅
---
Failure on the Survs part.
---
Existing
---
Oink!!
---
Survivors are worse trust me.
---
OwO?
---
Enforcing a playstyle is not making a character more viable. It just coerces players into following a meta.
---
He had an unhealthy playstyle before, I agree, but some of the nerfs were over the top. Plus he now feels very underwhelming compared to most killers, on both the killer and survivor side.
---
Does anyone have any idea if I will get banned if I make these my new icons?
---
One day boys. One day.
---
Meg
---
Claudette
---
Jane
---
Jeff.
---
That looks amazing! ❤❤
---
Don't commit to chases for over 15 seconds without a hit.  If you get a pallet or two, that's great.  If you haven't gotten a swing on her by then, rotate off to someone else. Killers win by keeping pressure up.  Letting 3/4 of opponents work on gens with no interruption is the opposite of pressure.
---
"Unusable" depends on how good you are with said killer
---
It will, it said individual survivor
---
No man it's gonna be Dewey
---
This is actually one of the best tips I've gotten, thx.
---
*Laughs in Rainbow 6 and For Honor gamebreaking bugs that take half a year to actually fix*
---
Not on pc nurse is ez. Console though yeah
---
HA HAHAHAHA
---
There's still gonna be 2 gates so I don't think blocking them will be an issue
---
To clarify what happened there, I got a hook, used the mirror to see all 3 survivors coming to the rescue so I decided against going for a lonely, pointless walk.
---
Whats that trapper mask?
---
*hello zepp intensifies*
---
Because of the dev build yesterday, I played with the console a just a little bit
---
At least it's not pay to win microtransactions and their actuall dlc are fairly cheap. It's probobly what has made them able to do dedicated servers aswell.
---
this is a work of art!!! xD
---
I’m a survivor main and barely ever play as killer but I don’t think there’s a reason for Adrenaline anymore. I say get rid of both. Also the hatch should be left until all the gens are done, that way the killer can’t close it and prematurely end the game and survivors can’t hide and wait for teammates to die.
---
Those bastards are up to something
---
I watched it last night to get ready for the killer
---
Now can they just do this with Kates’
---
Kind of kicking myself for not putting in a survivor animation to go with it, probably going to get shit for it lol. But glad you liked it!
---
Doctor earns bloodpoints like crazy, especially with Distressing (Which works great on him) and BBQ and Chili.
---
Meh 🤷🏼‍♂️ By the time we get to the second gate the killer could have downed us all with NOED, which I don’t think is fair.
---
Yes you are
---
I can't discuss yet since I haven't played this patch yet
---
Why did I snicker at this
---
Thank you and are there any addons that you would recommend?
---
Using spine chill for a couple months
---
Killer stays by a hooked survivor when the exit is open = camper!
---
Killer leaves hooked survivor when the exit is open, returns when they are unhooked = tunneller!
---
Killer leaves hook when the exit is open to not be either of those things, the survivor is unhooked and gets to watch butt dancing at the exit before having to walk to the other exit to watch the unhooked and unhooker butt dancing too. 
---
Messages after the game like gg ez noob baby killer. 
---
And people wonder why survivor queue times are long because not many people can put up with playing the more difficult role and taking abuse for it however they play :’)
---
Wait what was the main main menu theme playing before the update? Was that the plague’s?
---
Doctor ♥️
---
I mean, Myers breathes so loud, you can literally hear him through walls, so idk, it's not that hard to hear.
---
What is that one clown perk that would allow you to close the hatch but is useless now?
---
You lost me here chief. At least originally we always looked at the base killer kit. The whole point of the Wraith Cube was because he was add-on dependent and killer mains wanted the power buffed to not require add-ons. Same goes for trap setting buffs w/ Hag &amp; Trapper. You can wreck face with most of the killers without add-ons not just Nurse &amp; Billy. Wraith, Hag, Trapper, Pig, Spirit, Huntress, and Doc all can wreck face without add-ons, even Clown &amp; Plague can hold their own without them as can Myers and the new Legion.
---
what perk is this? it looks sick
---
I appreciate your sacrifice
---
How hard is it to spell Beautiful?
---
That's really annoying if someone does that
---
It's just better than to admit your own mistake. They were actually doing great, Ruin went in 30 seconds, they were popping gens, being aware and not letting me sneak up and yank them off. When I got my first down I was hoping they'd all swarm the hook and let me build some momentum, and they did.
---
I typically use Unnerving Presence, Overcharge, BBQ and Chili, and Distressing. The only teachables (Which you might not have as you mentioned you're new) are BBq and Unnerving. 
---
For addons I use a purple and yellow calm for maximum terror radius or green electrode and the iri king.
---
Woah I want being mean I was just saying who it was
---
He apparently has a red mask cosmetic, so the TV series may be part of the deal as well.
---
Yeah but you can farm bloodpoints then
---
Yeah, I had a pretty weak start on that one, they could've easily finished the gens if they played smarter.
---
He'll hit ptb around may 28th
---
You the real MVP for posting this my man
---
Depends, have they fixed rusty shackles? It was making a heartbeat when you triggered a trap so they knew they set one off anyway.
---
inb4 it doesn't work on him too
---
Yeah, on the plus side. Anyhow thank you kind sir.
---
Like a pig headless Amanda?
---
Is that fucking barefoot contessa in always sunny?
---
I still don’t get it. Please demonstrate.
---
You realize you're just being a hypocrite.
---
Idk why killer IS  the stronger end in every fkin way
---
I like leaks. They’re fun.
---
Then you see ghostface behind you
---
I need a little bit of that vitamin Gay doc.

Lol noed legion

Oh... That makes sense. Now please do Doctor x Clown.

---
Well, Nea was there when I hooked her, I think she would have tried to pull off a fast save in that case and make for the exit. 
---
Meaning that Blood Warden still would have triggered and now all four of them would die together.
---
You are traaaaaaaaaaash
---
Well true, I understand for licenced character's perks, but I don't understand spending shards on the shrine if you can still unlock new characters with shards.
---
There is no way this will happen unfortunately
---
Milk for the Khorne flakes
---
PS4 has endgame and Xbox doesn’t for a few days
---
Skidaddle skidoodle, your dick is now a noodle
---
I think Meg is the Meg of DBD
---
Do you have any idea how long it would have taken to cleanse all totems on the map when you don't even know how many there are left. That's not fun gameplay and definitely needs a change.
---
Is endgame collapse only on ptb or is it out now? Took a break...
---
This I agree with you, but DBD have a really defined line of players, the Inês that plays once a week and the ones that breath that shit, so the ones that barelly play the game Just wants It as fast as possibly, so IMO I understand both sides.
---
What is the cosmetic?
---
"Last Surprise"
---
Nobody is gonna come back to help anyone left behind lol
---
Title.jpg
---
Yes they fixed it finally. And yes you choose which trap to go to by looking at it. When you look at the trap you want it goes from red to white like in your video and you just teleport.
---
Oh my, yes....
---
I doubt they will even nerf Blood Warden, maybe just this trick.
---
 I assume using the perk will pause the EGC. Or slow it down. But they won't try to nerf the perks use directly.
---
Frames still majorly freeze on ps4, but we are on a new update of the unreal engine.
---
I will never understand you guys. T-Bagging isn’t even bad
---
Could it be that they just wanted to generate hype for Ghostface but keep the survivor under wraps by hiding the model?
---
although yes, that may be a bit much
---
Something about DS and how they got hit by his build involving it. You know how stupidly hot that topic is
---
I think it is better now. At least now you have chance for the hatch if your teammates are complete potatoes.
---
What's this? An asymmetrical horror game woefully underpopulated by bees? A large influx of bees ought to put a stop to that!
---
I like that nerve gas house
---
20% does Go down when someone dies/leaves.
---
And tbh the Timer is a Joke. It honestly changes nothing...
---
She didn't get a nerf though, she just didn't get as huge of a buff.
---
The point is you're a team, you're meant to work *as a team*. I understand that sometimes one can be thrown into a group of folks that don't really know what they're doing and that sucks. When the teams overall lack of skill drags your ability as an individual down, it's awful, but that's the risk you have to accept.
---
 You, as an individual survivor, are not meant to be on equal footing against the killer, that's where the whole idea of it being 4v1 comes in, the *team* can hold an advantage against the more powerful solo killer, not the individual.
---
Myers best addons combination is j.myers memorial and memorial flower
---
The pig-change was a placebo-"nerf". EGC buffed her by 10, the "nerf" maybe reduced her power by 5 or 6.
---
I have heard about that, yeah. I think Johnny Depp tagged along with him for the audition if I remember rightly, so it was more of a luck thing for Depp. Though I'm not 100% sure
---
You're right, I have an old 1.9.4 build before dreaded pakchunks became a thing and can see those are existent still. Cheers on the clarification.
---
Yea the only spoiler is in the title... So it's pointless.
---
Nurse, Legion was unfun but at least he wasn't broken-OP.
---
getting her endgame potential removed isn't a buff
---
Level up your Jeff late October and you’ll get the items you want.
---
I had a typo that made it confusing.

I haven’t played in a while
---
The fuck was that
---
Damn straight.
---
i can get behind this tbh. i havent been hugged passionately by a locker when wanting to vault a window yet but ive seen it happen and it looks stupid
---
"look at your add ons" come on claudette look at the patchnotes
---
It's a possibility as I mentioned the same in the video. Though, as a friend and I have talked about, leaking licensed content may cause legal issues. Could be wrong, but this isn't their first rodeo with leaks. Call it development hell maybe?
---
Aura reading, gen stall, several different playstyles backed by cool addons.
---
EGC directly buffs her, if you have your traps set when the last gen completes it's a lot deadlier.
---
It's not but keep telling yourself that if you want
---
I wear her pink reflective-ass jacket and i usually regret it
---
She's top 4. While Nurse, Billy and Spirit are clearly better than her, I don't see what others killers are above Huntress.
---
Hag ? Maybe, in some cases and in some maps she is better than Huntress, but Hag needs set up and her power is reliable on survivors, so she can easily be bullied by gen rushers or SWF teams. Also, big maps sucks even more for Hag than for Huntress, while, yeah, Huntress has bad patrolling on these maps, but she can at least get long range hatchets hits, because of how open these maps are, while Hag has bad patrolling, needs to waste a lot of time placing traps and most of the time she even can't teleport at her traps without add-ons.
---
Shape ? He is an M1 killer out side of Evil Within 3, you can still loop him in Evil Within 3 and you can easily get 3 gens done before he gets to Evil Within 3.
---
Plague ? In some cases, she perform better than Huntress, but her Corrupt Purge is again, reliant on survivors and without it, she is just an M1 killer.
---
Wraith ? He can get a easy first hit and he has some map pressure, but he still lacks in chases.
---
Pig ? She just was gutted, LUL. She can also get a easy firsthit, but she waste a lot of time crouching, help Ambush can be useful at some loops, but it's still too unreliable and her traps can slow down the game, but they are RNG reliant. And her end game potential was destroyed.
---
Doctor ? He somewhat counter stealth, but stealth isn't important in this game, you need to waste a lot of time trying to Madness up every survivor and his anti loop potential is a joke.
---
Clown ? His power literally helps him just in chases and even there he is mediocre, his bottles are useless at safe pallets or windows and he can only punish people who are greedy with loops.
---
Legion ? Please no.
---
Cannibal ? He doesn't have a power against smart survivors.
---
Trapper ? Same with Cannibal.
---
Nightmare ? Isn't obvious already ?
---
I don't usually, but I was particularly baffled by this guy. Good lord it was a frustrating game as well
---
It was inteded. There's no way it was released by accident for the second time in a row.
---
no u.
---
seriously can you give me one example where any devs did that?
---
its like Meg in family guy
---
"shut up, Legion"
---
I know, I just put it on bc it was purple tier, I don't even really know what Frank's does anymore. Cold dirt I get tho
---
Yep. The Entity has a few truckers in his service. The Killers have attempted to sabotage this transport time and again but to no avail.
---
ye...the funny thing is with Max. cool down add ons you get 1 Second more than the base cool down before the Patch...
---
I'm saying Freddy's power isn't a hindrance.
---
All borrowed time users are treasures
---
Its just pretty cool how things come full circle.
---
Love 'em all, but especially Haddonfield Memorial. Really cool atmosphere if they were to do it right.
---
It's the same? It just doesn't activate after all the gens are done like it did before
---
i remember when this sub want notqueens head after the curtain call fiasco
---
Doctors do start out as Nurses. He probably picked up a few tricks from his medical residency.
---
so? he a Basic M1 Killer that has a 7 Second delay before he can do something
---
The crapper
---
The devs tweeted that they fucked up and leaked it. It’s 100% official. Streamers like Morf also showcased it on stream.
---
It happens, unfortunately. All we can do is be the better people and move on to the next :(
---
If someone has an active trap when the collapse starts, chances are they're not getting out.
---
That was before they nerfed them again. Now, with maximum cooldown addons, you get the same effect you used to get while only using the yellow rarity one.
---
Not necessarily. If you plan for it, go immersed until the killer checks the gate you are at for the first time. Then open the gate while they are going to the other one when they leave. 
---
It is not a guaranteed win, but still better than a hatch standoff. Again, it is a situation where a single survivor is against a killer that killed 3 people already. It should not be a guaranteed or easy win.
---
Survivor frames are near perfect now. Killer frames are better but still dip on some maps.
---
He has aura reading and slowdown too, he's actually really fun if you don't overlook his entire power
---
That is actually fucking amazing, it's actually really spooky :D
---
OMEGALUL skillchecks are managed locally.
---
Meaning they can't lag because of connection since they only run on your machine.
---
Even a killer with 2000ms ping will have smooth skillchecks since they run 100% on your PC with the only lag being the input lag from your keyboard and the delay of your monitor.
---
The only thing that can lag due to connection is the explosion if you miss one.
---
She is in top 3 for sure. And in some cases and maps, she is better than Billy. Against really good survivors, I give more chances at winning to a really good Spirit than a really good Billy. But really good Spirits are so rare.
---
Oh boi
---
The killer will likely be the mask itself. However if it’s Stu I’m gonna be so fuckin happy.
---
Quite a few do. I'll go ahead and admit I probably use this mechanic more than I should
---
It won’t always be able to tell an accidental from intentional disconnect. Someone pulling the plug looks the same to the servers as someone losing their connection.
---
Yeah I was reading in another thread that apparently they only got the rights for the mask which is created/owned by Funworld and that the Ghost’s in game add-ons have a shit ton of Florida references which make no sense what so ever. That plus Ghostface doesn’t have the classic appearance with the long cloak etc. 
---
I’m thinking this is some of the Florida stuff is from a new Season 3 of Scream the TV series they got the rights too so a survivor could be from that, that they don’t want to leak out yet? No idea.
---
Apparently I just read that the Florida stuff is from the real “Ghostface” From 1990 where the story of Scream is based upon. Either way its really odd. 
---
Cheers mate for looking up the animations as well. Really appreciate it.
---
Does technician stack (sound reduction) if multiple people on the gen are using it?
---
Also, does it apply to everyone on the gen, or just the people running the perk?
---
Also also....will they ever change no mither so you start healthy, stay broken when injured, and the killer not be able to know you have it?
---
I had no idea they were the same actor. Mind blown.
---
Uh... Not really. The original white mask is infinitely more iconic and recognisable. Not to mention the fact that OP obviously isn't aware that the red mask is one of the Store cosmetics for The Ghost. This whole post is redundant.
---
Shit you right so excited for those
---
This is why you use a commodious toolbox. It can last through multiple gens, as opposed to each of these that can power you through one gen.
---
the bad grammar honestly makes it more legit. Have you read some of the perks?
---
Theoretically, Billy get stuck in loops. But at least he has the best mobility in the game, so he can make out of it.
---
Awesome!!
---
Splinter Cell Myers--the ultimate hard-counter to Urban 'Mersion.
---
Go play poker night at the inventory, you two dimentional rectangular plane loving son of a beach.
---
Clearly it's much easier to give up and complain though lol.
---
YES INDEED
---
Sounds great
---
If the killer is closing the hatch, that means the survivor has the opportunity to go to jigsaw boxes. It’s not possible for the killer to chase you and guard jigsaw boxes AND close the hatch.
---
I mean fortnite isn't the only game with emotes, and this game isn't all too immersive anyway. For Honor also has emotes despite the game being serious.
---
Killers still have the option of slugging the second to last survivor while searching for the last. What's more, as a killer, knowing where the hatch is and having BBQ and chilly make escape for the remaining survivor a much more difficult task.
---
Yeah! it reminds me of the movies without being a copy, my favorite theme so far.
---
Dude, I'm gonna!
---
are you sure? the Patch Notes say they nerfed the add ons and increased the base cool down
---
isnt the Scream Ghost Face?
---
Paging /u/ihybridpanda
---
He would love this.
---
and everyone with Selfcare, a gen or a Med Kit can end that
---
*closes hatch*
---
*people start getting sacrificed by the entity*
---
No, I mean that when you use Cold Dirt and Joey's Mixtape right now you get the same stun you used to have BEFORE the changes while using only Julie's Mixtape.
---
Oh yeah? Then go get the Decisive Strike.
---
Hope they introduce a movie set map like the one with Woodsboro in Scream 3 👀👀👀
---
It's just a worse version of using the traps after the last gen is done
---
The only thing that makes me think it was a screwup is that it ACTUALLY WAS a dev build. Morf was able to get to the console on-screen. So the dev build indicator overlay wasn't just their for cosmetic purposes to hype us up and look like a dev build. It really was a dev build.
---
Being camped and tunneled the whole game does not mean your bad. And if your complaining about swf you are bad. When I’m killer I have no problem with swf
---
im not saying dbd is fortnite im just listing a example of a game that has emotes. and true for honor do have emotes. but i feel like a horror setting is not someplace where emotes should exist
---
So... getting exposed is Shaggy going Ultra Instict... i can dig it
---
WTF
---
That's such a simple-minded viewpoint, have you even played him?
---
How in the literal fuck has this company not secured the license and put Pumpkinhead in the game yet? Ghost face? Seriously?
---
Yes.
---
"Hey old man have this back since I'm no longer the DC king." *hands salt crown to op trapper*
---
Unless, you know... SWF. It's not becoming killer sided, it's becoming more balanced
---
Watch it be loud as shit though
---
I always hatch standoffs as a battle of willpower.
---
I will! *runs into Blood Warden* I see the problem now....
---
I watched this movie last night with my boyfriend cause he had never seen it and now he’s pretty much confirmed as the killer! What are the odds haha
---
What are the pig cosmetics? I've been looking around this subreddit for awhile and can't find them.
---
What about literally every other change they've made to the game. Should people just be able to 'play the old version' as they please? This is the most ridiculous topic I've seen in years.
---
How can you even play the game if you think all that shit is toxic. Have you ever enjoyed a match?
---
What leak?
---
For me, they didn't leak the most important thing about Ghostface: Roger L. Jackson, or nah?
---
Because I'm not trying to look a gift ghost in the mouth, but if there's no Roger L. Jackson involved in at least the reveal it'll instantly be 1000% less hype for me, and I doubt he'd say no to it
---
Also, I mostly run killer, I love running killer, I'm gonna love running Ghostface, but I would have loved if this also stealth confirmed the Prescott, or even the Randy - can't think Jamie Kennedy would turn down a free meal.  Sadly, seems not to be the case :(
---
"But legion is nerfed to the ground he is now fucking useless omg omg (overreaction noises)" /s
---
I love you too
---
go on morf uk last stream or his twitter where he shows ghostface
---
I am just wondering how does the Trapper throw hatchets.
---
That's definitely the scariest leatherface mask imo, I'd love for it to be in the game.
---
Oh, you never *planned* to use your traps at endgame. I honestly think if “Endgame Pig” could be a thing with the EGC it probably would have been viable before the EGC. It’s about clutch potential. If you were getting routed before and managed to get someone down at endgame you could usually convert that into a kill, save some face, maybe even safety pip. Now she can’t do that. In this gen rush meta she’s screwed.
---
Hmm, I forgot she was called that, i was thinking more on how she had died and that was how she became that way
---
He's trying to encourage a chase with the flashlight to take heat off the gens. He needs content in his streams beyond just working gens for one thing. For another, he's wicked strong in the chase. His strategy only works if you're dumb enough to take the bait. But the reality is, if you see a survivor following you around, trying to goad a chase, that's one less survivor working a gen.
---
Ignore em and head to a gen. This type of survivor will take risks trying to goad you into the chase. Let em make their mistakes on the back of weaker survivors and keep your focus. Your first objective as killer should be to keep survivors off of generators. Your second objective is to hook them for their trouble. The third is not to waste time. As long as you stay focused on your objectives in that order, you'll rarely depip, and often enough, manage 3 and 4 hook games as your average.
---
So happy bout the cosmetics. They represent so much to me. If I don't have the shards to purchase them instantly I'm buying the shit out of them.
---
We'll make it perk  doesn't stack with other perks so this meme is already a failure.   [https://i.gyazo.com/e309826f39a0eeaadacf91071097990f.png](https://i.gyazo.com/e309826f39a0eeaadacf91071097990f.png) 
---
Unless you're aiming to also heal outside of unhooking /shrug
---
We put ours on the top of the Christmas tree each year.
---
Yeah someone was telling me that, it's odd, because I don't really recall the BBQ event having music other than the basic Main menu theme. Oh well :/ Yeeet.
---
\*hanging off the hook, dying\*
---
OH, DO YAH!?
---
So cool!
---
The two killer bug with Michael and Ghostface would be nerve wracking.
---
Probably one of the yellow bloodpoint offerings, they grant 75% extra in one category :D
---
So Pinhead?
---
Torment creek really have that many pallets?
---
If HybridPanda acknowledged my post I might die lol, love that guy
---
Oh didnt realize that i play more killer so ill have to see today.
---
oh, ye that makes more sense
---
&gt; You're just being a hypocrite here if you think survivors getting free wins is any different than killers getting free wins.    
---
Then I said
---
&gt;The killer already killed 3 people. That's not a free win.  
---
Because the survivor in this situation could have been AFK the entire match. The killer had to earn the situation he's in if the hatch is open. It's not a free win for the killer to give him the advantage in this situation.
---
You still have hope to escape even if it's less than 50% chance you succeed.
---
Np, Yeah a personal opinion i'm not too much of a fan of this killer. Just seems like a michael Pig power mix which is not very original. But each their own.
---
Counterpoint: yes we do
---
yep. Even got his Adept while in Red ranks...
---
Actually: yes we do
---
Hit animation and Mori animation is also leaked now:  [https://youtu.be/chocvdQY7zQ?t=406](https://youtu.be/chocvdQY7zQ?t=406)
---
I think the only one that would really be able to fit into the game and not be a terribly designed map would be the cemetery,more maps like haddonfield and lerys would be really bad
---
&gt; If you have something other to contribute other than “you must be bad” you can fuck off
---
Why try to start a discussion if you don’t want people to reply?
---
Steam shouldn't put a game ban on you if you got scammed, that would be illogical
---
Lmao the crows would give him away if he were afk
---
The killer has 3 kills. You only need 1 kill for it to be considered a win
---
Do you even play this game?
---
It was before the patch.
---
Haddonfield hospital would be dope. Although I love the game and the concepts of having Two whole floors I feel like the community would not like that
---
professional game developer btw
---
Unless the player is actually decent and can stop the gens from being done so quickly\*
---
I mean they could just drop some tease like they did with Clown and we not only were hyped but had something to speculate about
---
My Friends: 
---
Me: Dead By Daylight is queer.
---
My Friends:
---
Me: Quentin is a gay icon and Dwight/David are totally a thing.
---
What’s next invisible blinking killers, poison hatches, telliportin billys.
---
nothing can detect myers in tier1
---
Pretty sure noed activates soon as the 5th gen is done not when the door opens so noed is working as the same
---
I thought that was neat, aside from killers exploiting it. But I thought it was neat, as it punished survivors for flooding the basement just for a save.
---
Well, Myers Just got a Hell more scary
---
So clearly you must see his potential
---
Lol tf?
---
Has anyone tried playing a match as him?
---
Ok so it is ghostface from scream
---
Wasted my time reading this post just cleanse totems
---
Letherface looks like Jane lol
---
You will be happy to know that it is, I had a look into the files and ported the animations :) 
---
[https://youtu.be/chocvdQY7zQ](https://youtu.be/chocvdQY7zQ)
---
Unrelated but this type of conversation is the reason I stopped giving my opinion on anything. Especially if I was playing league of legends
---
No killer has ever been completely changed like freddy will be. It may as well be a completely different killer.
---
Thanks for the up!
---
Its not the same because the killer can do one of 2 things:
---
1) Force you out of the game before you find the NOED totem by opening the gate
---
2)He is also able to camp the gates with NOED and you only have a couple minutes to leave. Any good nurse can take advantage of this and actually prevent any person from leaving the game if the gates are close enough which happened to me.
---
Why is there a new season? The pretty boy is the killer what else do they want?
---
No problem! :)
---
the hatch will spawn on borders on the swamp maps
---
Idk, another two-level map would be neat.
---
Do Trapper's "lay trap speed increase" add-ons stack? I.e.  if I use the gloves and the setting tools, do I get the bonuses from both?
---
i dont watch horror movies but that is what ppl call the killer so i will kill him that
---
Low IQ gamer
---
What if the hatch was on a timer. It stays open for 180 secs or something then automatically closes.
---
I understand completely but I love Scream and I’ve been hoping for Ghostface for the longest time and I’m so happy theres at least some continuation of the license and the fact that DBD has managed to get 5 licensed killers all in one game which is huge for it.
---
Agreed but they tweeted that The Ash vs Evil dead chapter is now available so I got confused
---
I have 2 builds in mind :
---
Anti loop Legion : Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle with Cold Dirt and Joey's Mix Tape 
---
Stall Legion : Ruin, A Nurse's Calling, Monitor and Abuse, Sloppy Butcher with Filthy Blade and Nasty Blade ( these add-ons aren't bugged anymore ).
---
How do you unbind a key on console?
---
Beads!?
---
 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/) 
---
there ya go
---
surely they'll be able to see a distinction between people that lose connection and people that straight up click "leave match"
---
run Spine Chill. it's a double whammy because it'll also cause more skill checks as to wake yourself up. And just pay attention to the grass.
---
All the collapse does in terms of "Endgame" is killer can force blood warden by opening the gate himself. 
---
The NOED buff involves closing the hatch. Last survivor alive? [Too bad. Eat NOED and a Cypress](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/blv1le/the_new_hatch_standoff/?st=jvf91afb&amp;sh=419bc397)
---
Dear Anon,
---
  No one ever asked for your criticism; what if someone  did the same you you? That wouldn't be nice would it? Of course  not. If you wanted to say something  negative then keep it to yourself,  simple and hard at all, I dont tolerate  negativity  either. Just reflect on on your decisions you make.
---
                                                             Sincerely,
---
                                                  Thelaggywildfengmin
---
Yea I think this would be a reasonable fix. The killer should want to close the hatch immediately.
---
Is that possible for all killers?
---
Endgame is on Xbox already.
---
He just needed to go back, the escape is triggered when you walk through a certain line
---
WAIT A SEC PAUSE RIGHT THERE-Hellraisers coming back???
---
I remember when everyone hated the clown theme when his chapter released but honestly it's probably my favorite theme even though I barely play as clown.

---
It all comes down to who is the best hatch king in the match
---
They literally buffed legion to be more like a normal killer. There is no reason to hate him anymore because there is counterplay and he isn't just run forward until you die simulator.
---
Legion
---
Yeah when I saw this in a post-patch game I was a little giddy.
---
It looks great.
---
Holy fuck this game is so dumb. Forgot about blood warden. Imagine a killer running Blood warden, Insidious, NOED. And now the killer can use NOED before gens are even done. If you actually think NOED doesnt need to bee nerfed you are honestly just dumb.
---
Ahh, I didn't realize you were playing dumb. I thought you were trying to have a discussion in good faith.
---
The crows are irrelevant to the fact that the last survivor doesn't *earn* the hatch. He could literally be AFK and the hatch would still spawn for him. The killer had to kill 3 survivors to get the hatch to spawn. 
---
The player who puts more skillful effort into reaching a game state should have the advantage in that game state.
---
Don't bother replying again. I'm not feeding trolls any more than I already have. I just want to make it perfectly clear what I'm trying to say for anyone else who reads this thread in the future.
---
Pretty sure you're just the one playing dumb here.
---
4 might be when The Ghost is crouching and I have no clue about 6.
---
How does this impact legitimate slugging situations though? I had a game on Trapper where I had two in the basement and the other two rushed down to save and I caught them in the stairs and slugged each one.
---
Can you still do that? Bodyblock all four of them long enough to actually punish them?
---
They should merge it with another perk, but all perks that would profit from that synergy are already good on their own. Mettle of man, well make it, deliverance borrowed time, etc. Quite the predicament. I personally think it should either merge with distortion, or have a passive similar to distortion. This way, it will be almost an exact equal to bbqc.
---
Run corrupt intervention instead... if ruin isnt working for you run something else...
---
I did not know this. I literally just prestige III'd him last night. Now I'm sad.
---
Wording specifically states completed generators, however if BHVR wants to nerf certain killers to keep them in line with EGC, they need to address perks like Rancor and Bitter Murmur to keep things in line.
---
I know they won't, the vast majority are rank 18 survivor mains.
---
He was probably just talking shitt.
---
No not at all.. I dont do window vaults.. they're bad luck for me.
---
While I do like the idea, I feel like they should focus on making the existing maps as balanced as possible before moving on to produce new maps regularly
---
There's 2 gates they can only camp 1 just leave at the other door if u see a door that's already open that u didn't do avoid that door n if other survivors opened that door then they would go down n then u would know about noed u should have plenty enough time to clean 5 totems before all gems are done n most of the time there's ruin in play so u only need 4 totems so stop gen rushing n then getting mad about noed
---
scrapped?
---
well yes... if your team is bad in a team game you will lose.... I cant join a Basketball Game with a team of 5 year olds and expect to win just "i didnt get dunked on"
---
Shaggy as the new killer?
---
The entity has a serious competition now...
---
&gt;Yeah but they filmed (in Atlanta) the third season of the Scream show two years ago or so now, and it's floating around because of everything that happened with Weinstein. I don't think the show has anything to do with it.
---
soon our wishes shall come true
---
we probably won't get Legion levels of different people, but perhaps the different Ghostface cosmetics will at least have different flavor-text or a quote from the respective ghostface it is suppose to be.
---
How does the reworked character collision on the basement stairs work now? If you have multiple people in the basement (eg; one hooked and one going for the save) can you block the stairs and down both of them? What if it's three people, or all four?
---
Not saying the change isn't good for people holding the basement hostage, but they can't just run past you now can they?
---
Also I've noticed that survivors (when trying to bodyblock me) seem to have collision priority - if we're running across a path that can only fit one character, it's the killer who is shoved to the side; it makes it really hard when trying to down someone running to the open gate, is that intended? Is there a specifically way to move that prevents it? Survivors seem to be far more fluid.
---
The pig got cosmetics?
---
Omg right can they fix sheltered woods?? That map is so killer sided. There isnt much to protect ya on that map. Lots and lots of open space.
---
I think a simple deterrent like this coupled with a refining/enforcement of the report system could work well, I worry that a lot of these more complex punishment systems people are proposing would get bypassed by purposely getting downed and intentionally letting themselves die on hook where intentions become more murky.
---
Yeah, no doubt. I'm still thankful for the licensed stuff.
---
Depends if licenced or not, anything licenced I think should have a survivor, killer and map, some new original maps every now and then I would love to see
---
the Blade add ons also dont stack anymore
---
Why would you bring a perk that benefits your team after you die?
---
Did none of these idiots read the patch notes? Exit gates/hatches open = gtfo asap
---
I have heard that some maps need fixes but i dont know exactly what needs to be fixed with those 
---
maps. Could you explain for me please?
---
We need to wait till that total Freddy rework comes around
---
We like presents in our family, but don't do religion, lol. So Ghostface it is!
---
Hooray! Borrowed Time got buffed again!
---
Rofl. It's objectively stupid on every level. If you know exactly where the killer is and have free time to work on gens, but decide to throw that away to play musical chairs on a hook, you deserve the only thing that's going to happen to you. The killer's job is to kill you, not to let you farm WGLF.
---
No, no to all of what you said. Campers are not at all rare, and they hurt everyone in the game. I'd like to play the video game, not hold m1 simulator/hit space while 3 megs crouch around you simulator.
---
BHVR be like : we need to find a solution to killers camping hatch and trying to interrupt.
---
Random BHVR employee : how about we make it so that killer can stand on the hatch so survivors can't jump and unless killer closes the hatch survivors can't open the doors AAAAAANNNNDDD FUCKING END GAME STARTS RIGHT AWAY WHEN KILLER CLOSES THE HATCH SO HE CAN CHASE THE SURVIVOR FOR 2 MIN TILL THEY GET IMPALED FROM GROUND ALL WHILE SURVIVOR CAN'T EVEN TRY TO OPEN THE DOOR.
---
IM THROWING MONEY AT THE SCREEN AND NOTHING IS HAPPENING!
---
HELP
---
in the old system, killing 3 survivors meant 2 pips easy. I would just smack the survivors on the ass on their way out if there was a standoff.
---
He was already confirmed before you watched the movie, oddly enough.
---
Are you getting many disconnections? I'm planning on buying him.
---
Imo there might be something to this flat earth thing.
---
I don't use NOED but Blood Warden is awesome!
---
yes they are rare and they only hurt 2 People at max. they suck, but dont cry about it
---
it's almost as if running up to the killer and farting in their face is a bad idea
---
Do you think no ed is op? It is usually a worthless perk and it is avoidable.
---
This was before that bug. Entity blocker came up, threw down shack pallet and started running the windowless side. He refused to break pallet. Went on long enough that entity blocker went away, and went back to it. 
---
I know the bug youre talking about and its bullshit. If i get my 3rd vault and the entity blocker doesnt pop up, I just leave that loop anyway. I've only really seen it be an issue against Plagues for some reason.
---
I hardly ever do gens in the game I always look for totems and run the killer around loops until they get mad and leave. I doubt you even play survivor. Me on the other hand have played both rank 1 killer and survivor. Look at this clip btw and tell me NOED doesnt need a nerf. [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/blv1le/the\_new\_hatch\_standoff/?st=jvf91afb&amp;sh=419bc397](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/blv1le/the_new_hatch_standoff/?st=jvf91afb&amp;sh=419bc397)
---
I mean, I guess it works.
---
he always was
---
Cemetery= Claudette’s hiding behind tombstones. It would be hell for killers
---
Dewey is who we should get. David Arquette would probably voice himself too.
---
Legion is still fundamentally the same killer, he has a dash can vault stuff and gives people deep wounds. Freddy will be completely different.
---
I mean it has boobs soo
---
What do you mean fun and enjoyable what needs changed right now? They already took my fun away by making me re-learn legion so survivors could have more fun.
---
who knows. we know nothing so far
---
This is the only time I'm not happy for boobies
---
sometimes is hard to do it, but when you do... oh boy
---
I think so buts very hard to do. Has to be frame perfect.  You can do this over the gap inside preschool too.
---
Honestly, NOED actually kinda sucks because any smart survivor WILL cleanse totems.
---
Because in Scream 3 we get a post-mortem tape from Randy that helps the other characters. These are just gimmicky perk ideas based off of Randy's character.
---
"Only hurt 2 pople max" That's far from right. Campers hurt everyone in the game,
---
YOU'RE DONE INNNNN,
---
BY THE, TIME IT HITS YOU,
---
YOUR LAST SURPRISE!
---
Dbd is alot harder to run than you would think. The game uses an insane amount of polygons and has a huge draw distance.
---
We know what they've told us, that it will essentially be a different power, plus look at how long it has taken. They've been saying freddy rework since he came out practically.
---
I don't think it needs a nerf. I agree it's a pain in the ass to deal with but survivors have perks like Mettle Of Man and Adrenaline as well as items like InstaHeals. 
---
In terms of hatch standoffs they were EXTREMELY survivor sided. Survivor finds it first, he jumps in. Killer finds it first, he'll likely wait for the survivor to to go to the hatch, and then survivor waits ontop of the hatch until the killer gets bored and hits him and jumps in.
---
In terms of NOED and Blood Warden, I use that build on my Freddy. I don't have Devour Hope but I'd use that for a "YOU FORGOT THE POWER GLOVE!" build. [Compare the beginning to your Devour Hope being cleansed, and 0:14 onward when you NOED a survivor, open the gate, and hook them to proc blood warden](https://youtu.be/otBNYc0lJ6Y)
---
Really not worth running rabbit amd M&amp;A at the same time si ce rabbit reduces the terror radius in a percentage that applies after monitor and abuse so youre only reducing your radius by less than 2 meters where as if you only use the rabbit youll get pretty much the same result and youll be able to use another perk instead of M&amp;A
---
Haha Mori Selfie!
---
They only removed it for the end game collapse section, didn't they? So only when the gates are already open.
---
I'm really glad to see they used the iconic blade wipe from the movies. Even if this isn't technically Scream (as rumoured) at least this is a pretty on spot Ghostface.
---
That's the point u gotta be 1st to the hatch I play both killer n survivors either way they were died with or without noed once the killer closed the hatch there was no way they were gonna get that door open so noed wasn't really a thing that made a difference
---
Finding totems is to easy n it doesn't sound like u run the killer to good complaining about noed how do u get hit by noed if the killer left? Just clean totems it's that simple literally easier to clean totems then doing gens
---
It is not an awful perk. It is an overpowered perk. I have tested it in rank 1 games as a killer despite how much I hate the perk and 1/5 games they will actually cleanse it the other 4/5 it lets me secure a 4k 100% of the time as a good killer. I always let the survivors during these tests btw so dont give me shit for being a cunt.
---
The devs said the freddy rework will change basically everything about him which is why it takes so long. Legion wasn't changed much besides some values.
---
no. just use Borrow time or do gens and get out
---
One of my least favorite maps... hills don't spawn there iirc so no balanced landing either.
---
Florida.... JACKSONVILLE!!! HE IS ASH's KILLER!!
---
You’re not listening: *it’s not about saving your traps.* I’m pretty sure if the EGC could make “Endgame Pig” a thing I’m pretty sure it would have been viable beforehand. Saving your traps for endgame might convert a single kill but the remaining survivors would be sure to run once they figure out what you’re doing. I mean the door is already open. It’s a losing strategy. No, the best strategy for the Pig has always been to win early and snowball. 
---
This is about clutch potential: when that strategy has failed, you’ve only managed to get three hooks the whole game, and the last generator is completed. The Pig used to be able to get a down use a trap to secure at least one kill, save some face, maybe even safety pip. Never by intent, mind you. You don’t intend to be down by three and throwing a hail mary in the last ten seconds of a football game. But if you’re getting routed and just haven’t been able to use all your traps, stopping at least one survivor from being able to walk out the gates used to be a saving grace. 
---
The Pig has to win early or lose hard in the late game. In this gen rush meta she’s screwed. The riskiness of the Pig’s traps always kept her in C tier. Now that they just go away I can’t see how anyone can’t put her beside the Wraith with a very good argument that she should be just above Freddy. After Freddy’s rework, it’s quite likely she’ll be considered the worst Killer in the game.
---
WOOOOO!
---
I want to start by saying the way hatch works now is a flat improvement over the old mechanic.  Thank you BVHR for changing it, this is a million times better than the way it used to work; but reading the notes before the update went live I just knew this would happen, even if it's probably going to be an edge case.  It's still better than the old system, but there should be a fix to this new type of situation.  For example maybe the hatch should auto close if the killer is within a certain (very close) proximity, or within a certain range of the hatch killer collision detection goes away.
---
At 0 generators completed in this situation I'd just take the sacrifice in the clip so I can go to my next game, but if the killer wanted they could hold the game hostage for up to 5 generator completions (and still get the damn kill), and that's almost as bad as the fixed problem with killers blocking basement stairs.
---
Even more to the point, DCing is/will be punishable, and now you're going to tell me I can't DC if the killer does this?  :(
---
Use adreneline izi
---
i used to defend self care... but now i think is pretty meh
---
Na na na na na na na Trapman, Trap man
---
Yeah trying to see auras is really my only issue with this map.
---
I usually swap between Dark Sense and Alert and yeah it's near impossible to see the killers aura.
---
But like... Why would you have a cemetary on your estate, lol
---
why? Playing games in English improves your English skills and makes it easier for you to communicate with other players.
---
Frist of all,  they NERFED him after his release because he was too strong.
---
Second of all, they just said its the biggest rework yet. But it will still stick to his theme
---
Anyone know the name of the song jendenise plays when she's spectating sometimes? It's that happy little doo dee doo song. lol
---
Her trap isn’t really meant to kill, it’s more to waste time.
---
Since so many of us are into hating Legion, are we not establishing our own anti-Legion Legion?
---
I find it hilarious :D
---
I hoped for that lmao
---
For only 5,000 bloodpoints a day, you can donate an abused Legion member the add-ons they need to fight back against the daily torment..
---
*Insert sad music with a montage of Legions missing their hits, getting pallet stunned and BMed at the gate*
---
only if you put them down after all gens are done
---
Im genuinely curious if you even play the game. I have tested it in rank 1 games as a killer despite how much I hate the perk and 1/5 games they will actually cleanse it the other 4/5 it lets me secure a 4k 100% of the time as a good killer. I always let the survivors go during these tests btw so dont give me shit for being a cunt.
---
thank you :)
---
I think he's implying that you are a "whale" which is slang for someone who spends tons of money on micros in the gaming community.
---
yessir
---
Yep lol that must be what’s going on here, or maybe I was unlucky since I’ve only had this happen to me once so far.
---
fucking hate this map, I cant see any auras and have trouble finding where the others are hooked if its too far away...just a terrible map
---
I would really love a map with an open body of water which would introduce a new mechanic where survivors can hide in the water but have to hold their breath and what not,would be cool!
---
***WAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPP***
---
Yeah, and the survivors are potatoes. If the survivors are competent, however, an average Killer is going to be in hot water. It’s not like the Pig has anything that helps her in a chase or lets her pressure the map.
---
I could get behind a series of comics with this kind of DBD characterization.
---
Underrated comment
---
I’m pretty sure they’d mostly get connected to other people from Europe so English wouldn’t help all that much. Also it would barely improve your English, if I played in Japanese it wouldn’t improve my Japanese skills.
---
what if they made an actual working elevator, that'd be dope
---
Incorrect. If the killer’s purpose was just to kill, there would be no reason not to facecamp the first person downed each match, which AGAIN, limits the points for the killer as well as the survivors. Who said anything about farming or WGLF? No one. Also, if you have to camp to get kills, it means you’re failing. The killers are design to hunt &amp; chase. Any new player can stand in front of someone on the hook, it takes 0 skill. Stop trying to pretend that it’s a strategy.
---
Nerve gas would be awesome but extremely complicated
---
BOI LEMME SEE THAT STEAM PROFILE I AINT SCARED OF SOME SPOILERS
---
haha i cont spel tu
---
Will never happen. Simply put, DBD does not want to support monetizing a pedophile.
---
the Scream Franchise and the costume have 2 different rights holders. Hence the Brandon James mask in the TV Series
---
IDK Man, what do we need any perk for? That’s what they chose. It’s not that big of a deal anyways because whoever finds the hatch first wins endgame. The gates being automatically powered after your team failed the trial is just bonus honestly.
---
Seriously though my guy. Think about that for a minute. Does it really matter if the killer has to hit you once or twice? If he finds you before you powered the gate, there’s not a chance in hell you are opening the gate.
---
how else should Europeans communicate if not through English?
---
Obviously this wont happened 🤣
---
Really? I have 528 hours as a Doctor main. I've dabbled with NOED a few times and most of the time it's just not great. After survivors know you have it they'll likely leave as fast as possible. 
---
I only use it on Freddy because he needs that end-game boost considering how much of a monster he can be in end-game. (Less gens there are, less places to wake up, etc.) 
---
Note I do not play meta killers like Hillbilly, Huntress, or Nurse as I was never good with hatchets, blinking, or the chainsaw.
---
Servers aren't til summer.
---
Oh no, it's definitely Scream. His weapon wipe animation is directly from the movies and so is his mori, where a cell phone is involved.
---
I'd for sure pick up an Old Myers skin, his current one doesn't look too good.
---
Have you tried running away after

---
#FreeThePup
---
The newst patch is live, Ghostface is not in it, he was for a little time before they fixed it. He will probably be the next DLC.
---
This is the Blood Warden content that I've been waiting for.
---
Maybe now Survivors won't sit around anymore.
---
Well I imagine they don’t communicate with other people that don’t speak that specific language. Also it makes no difference as you only talk in end-game chat which is only on PC and most of the time just filled with salt
---
I'm super excited ghostface was in this, it's just a shame he wasn't given original mechanics. I could think of so many things they could have added. Ex a leigon mechanic where the killer under the mask could be Billy, Billy's mom, Sid's brother, and all have slightly different advantages. Or a 'phone call' skill check kind of like the need to rinse the vomit or removing the saw trap. Either way im just happy ghostface is in this, I've been wanting it forever.
---
wait is that jane drawing trapper?
---
Thanks a lot for my first ever Silver!
---
I agree.. when I play Solo I hardly see people doing totems. I do the ones I see. But I'm only one person. I also need to do gens and be chased by the killer and hook saves to gain the right amount of points..  they need a totem counter in the corner of the screen it starts with 0/5 then counts up once totems are done. If they dont wanna mess with noed then the less they could do is that. 
---
End game is now all blood warden and noed.. sucks...
---
Yeah if you are a good killer NOED applies enough pressure that survivors will completely avoid you. On top of that if you are nurse or billy you can rotate between the doors even faster guaranteeing a 4k.
---
Hell yeah.. close the hatch now stoopid killer lmaooo
---
Pharmacy and Botany knowledge are more than enough and provide some nice help for yourself and healing others quickly too.
---
Whatchu talking about ni- (ANormalHuman465 has been banned for Toxic Behavior)
---
It scares me when the bar at the top appears like I’m about to fight a dark souls boss but there’s no winning, only escape
---
ye man xD but usually after doing it I need a bit of time to readjust because I moved my camera so sometimes it's just facing a wall or a tree and once I figure out where I wanna run, I get slashed anyway.
---
....wait he’s British
---
Decisive Strike was in the web the week before the gutted it. At least this time it wasn't bait and switch.
---
it is, its confirmed
---
Those maps are fun in their own ways. Only thing I hate is looking for all 5 totems on that map.
---
Figures people cry about killers being able to do bullshit like basement blocks and have clearly broken mechanics it gets fixed instantly or gets you banned.
---
Then when killers get the ass end of not being able to do anything at all about something, you get salty down votes from people who abuse it because they are bad and people telling you to ignore the fact that a game mechanic is BLATANTLY broken. 
---
Sums up my issue with this community. Very few who care for the game's health and gameplay for both sides.
---
Survivor mains are the type to carry this rule book attitude and justification for shitty behavior and disconnecting constantly.
---
But i guess we're not doing anything about that either.
---
I see the same people disconnect from my games over and over in red ranks when things don't go their way.
---
Could be placeholder names
---
No we need Brenda instead
---
It's not an apt comparison. The player base of F13 is smaller by &gt;an order of magnitude.
---
Ok so we have:
---
Option 1: Use borrowed time, wowee now im down and getting camped because the killer is just hitting me once before the save, and once after the unhook animation. Fun!
---
Option 2: Do gens, see this is where it negatively effects everyone. I'm not playing hold M1 simulator all game, that shits boring, and that's not the point of playing survivor. Not to mention all the bloodpoints everyone is missing out on while the killer is too busy camping.
---
So I can either A save and probably get camped, or B sit and hold down a single button. Need I really explain why that isn't good?
---
I thought there was a counter to him, now I feel powerless.
---
plane map when
---
The blade wipe and the mori have me sold. I don't care if he ends up being "mid tier", I'm going to be maining Ghost.
---
I did ask them If they would do something about in the 'ask you questions about ECG', but no one replied. Clearly killers would do that, closing it when the survivor is nearby.
---
I thought there was a post that said that there wouldn't be a survivor coming with the Ghostface update? o: Either way I hope it's like an improved version of something we have, like Ghostface seems to be an improved Myers. Maybe a spine chill 2.0 to counter the 0 terror radius on Ghostface, or an exhaustion perk that helps you escape when Ghostface suddenly pops up, dead hard 2.0? 🤣
---
They should've made it so you get a 15-25% buff on speed for each survivor that dies. That'd be great for those hopeless games where there's 2 people left.
---
It isn't even that bond or aftercare is 1 million times better than it. Bond to not interrupt a generator that a team mate is on mid chase and to get a heal off a team mate or just work a generator, you don't need to be full health 24/7 even though it's nice to be lol aftercare is miles ahead of self care imo as well as bond. I could write a 50 page essay on how they are better but idk self care is just a perk I hate because it is really selfish
---
The house from saw 2 would be to small of a map. I love saw and saw themed ideas but not this one.... Not for this game. There would never be a time where the killer wasn't more than 20m away from anyone at any time.
---
I don't think so, they would say Stacks I reckon if they did. Feel free to prove me wrong though
---
I'm in in a swf.
---
Me - Repairing shack gen
---
Friend - Oh so this is the killer approaching me pretending to be you then...
---
You see the problem with this yet?
---
“Kiddo” LAD IS IN YOUR NAME
---
It’s alright my nurse is p2 Level 34 no bbq
---
There’s things in the game called “pallet prophets”, which is when one survivor runs loop to loop throwing pallets down. Getting caught in a survivor’s “looping circuit” is probably going to cost you the game.
---
The best advice I can you as a new killer is to not be afraid to give up a chase and go pressure gens. It doesn’t mean they are better than you, it just means they have the advantage. There’s too many pallets on a map to burn through and win the game. You lose if you do this.
---
My parting advice to you: the best looper on the team is just as good as the worst looper on the team when it comes to repairing gens. Holding M1 is not a hard thing to do, so chase the worst survivor on the team. Don’t be a killer that blames survivors for gen rushing, learn to pressure gens now while your still a new killer and forming habits.
---
Nerve Gas House from SAW 2 would be fucking awesome. Some tweeks to make it work within the game but amazing.
---
M O O N O F T H E M O O N= ghostface chapter... thats dumb
---
Hate that feeling when I try to lose the killer in the cornfield and end up being lost myself.
---
You can close hatches now?...
---
Maybe it's time to get back in the game...
---
IM TIRED OF THESE MOTHERFUCKIN' TRAPS
---
**ON THIS MOTHERFUCKIN PLANE**
---
This + endgame + fog would actually make the game scary and fun
---
Wow it looks like I found a survivor that has actually played in high rank games since the patch. Its been the same for me. I have a feeling almost all of the people on this Reddit haven't gotten past rank 10 and havent played against actually good killers who can secure a 4k by rotating gates with nurse/billy and using m1 to get instant downs with NOED. Ive had games where the killer opened the gate himself and forced survivors to come to him for easy NOED kills then just rotate around the map until blood warden expires which is more than enough time for any good killer to find everyone.
---
Imagine how nerve racking it would be, hiding behind one of those beds in the morgue and you’re almost at their 2 madness..
---
In the newest leak w/ Ghost it’s revealed that she got 2 new skins
---
Something needs to be done about haddonfield too, we already know the problem with the windows but some of the fences and bush layouts are ridiculous.  I was playing a match yesterday as legion, and I swear I needed bloodlust 3 to catch this ash who would run around this L shaped fence that was about 20-25 meters long.  And he was able to run from the fence to the house upstairs and vault through the window to put him right back down to this fence.  I would lose bloodlust every time he used the house.
---
Not saying it's real.
---
Next you're gonna have an epic lightbulb moment and say the survivor's job isn't to escape. You say "if you have to camp to get kills, it means you’re failing." The salt-free fact of the matter is that if you're camping and getting kills, it means that you're winning.
---
I'll stop "trying to pretend" when you stop whining because you can't figure out when no to go for the unhook.
---
I do. I'll try changing drives. Thank you!
---
At the end of the day the perk does nothing for players with good awareness. Good players won’t run from one gen to the next closest, and often times will do a gen in the center of the map ASAP to avoid 3 gen either way. For lower ranked players, sure it’s useful, but by the time your green/purple you should know where gens tend to be and how not to 3 gen.
---
you can also combine bt with mom to not Go down.
---
So do you have any suggestions?
---
its probably not real tbh
---
Just get better at killer duh
---
They did so something about it. When they brought it to everyone, they made it so it’s not nearly as bright for the killer, so they’re better able to see scratch marks.
---
Well just have to wait and see. Ghostface has been leaked, might as well just tell us the details.
---
Technically 360’s are used as last resorts. The only way the work is if the killer makes the mistake. I recommend going one way then immediately spinning the other.
---
&gt; Someone found add ons
---
source.
---
One sec
---
They nerfed him because survivors whined too hard, I was playing then. I also remember the devs saying they fucked up when they changed him. 
---
It will stick to the theme but it will likely not function the way it does now.
---
Very cute, I like it! Makes me wish there was some kind of interaction or expanded lore on current killer thoughts for those like Spirit/Wraith who didnt really do much wrong overall.
---
true, probably the new survivor isnt sydney... who knows
---
How is your game nog locked at 60 fps?

25 days later....
---
I was really hoping for a phone call alert check of some sort if you were in Ghostface’s presence he could call you. Like how Doctor’s madness alerts him to where survivors hide. But I’m actually okay with the Amanda/Michael combo since the stalk fits his character still.
---
As HillBilly camp hooked survivor wait for rest of team trying to farm him. Then chainsaw sprint rescuer. So now you have 1 hooked and 1 slug to bait another survivor. GL&amp;HF
---
It all makes sense lmao Ghostface is a confirmed Deadite.
---
fuck no i don't want any more indoor maps ever again
---
I must admit I've seen some people do this when I play killer, I'm just not sure when to turn because usually when I turn I end up getting slashed when I  cross in front of killer, I'll give it a try anyways, thanks!
---
This brings me joy
---
If it’s real I doubt it’s part of the ghostface chapter, that lore isn’t even remotely similar to scream, regardless of rights. The name also suggests maybe a werewolf type killer
---
I’ve seen the hag do this over the gap. And it scares me haha.
---
Yeah, I know it's almost 99% not true. But I was just seeing what others thought.
---
I wouldn't hold my breath on being able to purchase them with shards. Considering the fact that the licensed killers are only available for purchase with auric cells on the ingame store, I'd say their cosmetics would be too.
---
The doctor: Tokyo drift.
---
I still can’t find her.
---
My favorite thing about this thread is all the survivor mains are staying out of it because they know how dumb OP is.
---
I don't see how EGC would change whether you unhook someone.
---
And regardless solo surv got buffed in a way that doesn't buff SWF -- EGC starting with more than 1 alive is a guaranteed signal to everyone that an exit gate is opening. No more desperation running to the other gate, you know what you're working with.
---
You think Ghostface’s map is gonna be Woodsboro Highschool or something else?
---
Yeah. Like if you want to get a 4k that's fine, go ahead. But if you have to slug to get it then that's just boring as fuck and lacks skill.
---
It would be dope but I guess it that it would be difficult if not impossible to use that feature in a chase.
---
Huntress is lowkey kinda hot
---
They must find it painful that they even have to get it, its doing the killers franchise a favour by bringing attention to it. playing this game makes me want to go back and watch the films again lol
---
lerys, lerys, lerys, lerys, and ormond
---
Hit hit animation is literally him wiping the blood off the knife directly referencing how he does it in the garage in scream 1
---
1. The killer is camping... how would he have hit me atleast 2 times before?
---
2. I shouldn't have to change half my build to try and MAKE the killer play the game.
---
3. I don't even have MoM, as I don't even like the perk.
---
Please stop normalizing this garbage.
---
There was a post about there not being a new survivor for the chapter? damn. Anyways that's a really cool idea, maybe make a perk that gives you the dead hard effect for a few seconds after you enter a chase?
---
I think of that and all I can picture is cheesy elevator music.
---
The hospital and the gas house would be so bad ass.
---
 Crystal Lake :(
---
The way the black and gray designs mesh on hag's face kinda give her a goatee.
---
Obviously if the nurse was waiting at hatch she wasn’t really caring about generators. Maybe when he finished one she’d look but that opens the hatch. Or if she stays on hatch, more gens, free points, pips. Not easy but 3 dead survivors and no gens done isn’t supposed to be.
---
Because if they didn’t have some sort of ranks, survivors would be disadvantaged by having some immersed rank 21 Claudette crouching around the edge of he map scared, while a rank 1 triple blink nurse annihilates the green rank survivor in a 10s chase, the purple rank survivor runs the whole map for ruin and finds it where they spawned, and he red rank survivor gets half a gen done before being found. 
---
Is having no ranks really a question? If you don’t want to sweat, then don’t sweat, EVER. If one day you’re going to try, then you’re going to rank up, the next day if you don’t want to try anymore, it’s going to be a bit sweaty, because YOU put yourself there. Have fun or try to win, you make the choice every day and it will effect your games in the future.

"Someone's gonna need these..."
---
ladies and gentlemen, ive done it. ive upvoted to 420
---
Maybe not a post but I recall some people commenting on those "Ghostface leaked" posts saying they're glad Ghostface is finally coming but there seems to be no survivor /: I could be wrong.
---
I might have a new ringtone! I feel he is going to be bringing a new level of fear to the game and can’t wait. I need the peeky memes!!!
---
Obviously some ppl must like it because it’s in most games, but geez, what kind of madman can play like that
---
his perk name is literally named after randy’s line from the movie. that kinda tells me they have the movie license. they probably changed up the robe to allow more variety in the cosmetics as they couldn’t with the solid black robe
---
As a killer, I cant find my totem in this map. LOL!
---
Trap man!
---
*Entity*
---
Trap man! 
---
Ghostface is here 
---
*Ghoooooooooooost*
---
Dude, looping is such an filthy exploit, survivors should just run in a straight line. Otherwise, I’ll camp them.
---
?
---
Because Pumpkin head is no where near as popular or known as killers like Ghost face. I don't live in the Us and i've NEVER heard of Pumpkinhead.
---
Nea, the time's gonna run out. Oh no, she's got airpods in, she can't hear us oh god of fuck
---
oh lol.
---
i mean. i’ve bought auric cells and know plenty of people that have too. i have job and don’t buy many games. i think it’s justifiable.
---
Not a huge fan of the way those ribbons float behind him, it's probably going to make stealth a lot harder.
---
You literally didn’t directly counter any of my points lol. They all still stand.
---
Yeah I actually loved the TV show and its been in production hell ever since for Season 3’s release. I believe with the release of Scream Chapter its possible they’ll release Season 3 this year maybe. 
---
Also a lot of shows/movies are filmed in Atlanta because thats where the major studios are located/cheaper to film. So its highly likely Season 3 wouldn’t take place in Atlanta.
---
Also with an account system it will allow for better Cross Play capabilities if they ever decide to incorporate that. I would very much like to see a BHVR account system implemented.
---
Nice!
---
Im amazed it hasnt broken anything so far.
---
Dont need a pc.
---
I just want more indoor maps, we need to spread the effectiveness of spoopy Myers and not just have him be relegated to 1 map, kinda 2.
---
But it's not overpowered. Just cleanse totems if you're smart.
---
you also have to remember that the chapter is a month and a half away. it’s only halfway through the development time frame. i doubt the pieces of robe will be floating on release, bc think about it, how could he have stealth and stalk when he has those long pieces floating off his back
---
Still no patch for toxic SWF shit bags. They suck for us solo survivors too.
---
" Tell me how the survivor could outplay the killer here. "
---
Do Gens.
---
Let's be honest, how many of you are even going to buy the outfit? Just pigs are so rarely seen in my games
---
How am I supposed to know what's in the shrine if I don't have my pc on which I play dbd?
---
Crazy girls do crazy things:  http://ceoq.l5dusnkq.org/touq282h/
---
Clown has bamboozle, pop goes the weasel and coulrophobia... Those did not close the hatch as far as I know. Bamboozle closes vaults and windows and it is a Godsend.
---
That would work really well I think. 
---
They could even change it up entirely. What if it could reveal the hatch location to you when you're the last person in the game? Would give the last survivor a better chance of finding it before the killer.
---
Naturally rank reset feels good as killer because you don’t have a team. You are the only one you have to rely on. But as survivor when you go from having somewhat competent 6 year olds as teammates to potatoes, suddenly things are very frustrating. 
---
Rank reset gives good killers an easier time and good survivors a much harder time.
---
You can go to dbd wiki like that dude said, you don't need your pc.
---
Probably won't main this killer if he doesn't have a black robe like in the movies. I really don't like the feel of the medieval outfit. Oh well, cool that they were able to add Ghostface anyway!
---
What is this abomination
---
Lol I feel tho
---
Ugggffhh I’d LOVE the Nerve Gas house from Saw 2. Plus you could randomly tie in other movies traps like how the meat plant has multiple. 
---
I know the basement leads to the bathroom trap which is already in the meat plant, so maybe have it lead elsewhere?
---
None of those really help him catch suviviors
---
How does a big chunk of time get cut off? Is it the hooked survivor dying?
---
Heeeeheheheh I know right. Just a placeholder~
---
Thank you!!
---
Need a good lunge distance to pull it off. T1 meyers wont be making this. Also don't think a nurse can make it...but a nurse doesn't have to make this so it doesn't matter. 
---
Actually, I think all killers have the same lunge distance as of patch 2.2....maybe? So only T1 meyers can't make it.
---
Thought read somewhere the devs confirmed it. They said they just had the rights to the mask.
---
Honestly it's just all online games. Csgo, overwatch...
---
*league of legends*...
---
Damn that game is **the** most toxic game I have ever played
---
Business suit Leatherface.
---
Ye
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUP🤪🤪🤪
---
I played him and my god he's even more terrible, but at least he now has counterplay and isn't unfun to play against so hey
---
OMG YES THANK YOU!!! Also add: "jAnE iS tHicC"
---
Ricardo Beelos
---
Explain Freddy.
---
Scratch marks were too hard to see when it was like this, so they reduced it. Actually, it already started off reduced for killer, but the marks were still too hard to see so it's even more reduced.
---
WAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUP
---
Eh, most communities have this kind of stuff. Like the castlevania community went to shit when it became overrun by Ann Rice fans.
---
I would rather just hold down a button, or as you say a one button press for let go.
---
LoL is apparently pretty bad but as someone who played Overwatch for a good while I don't think it's as consistently bad as in DBD.
---
Pretty sure he's the next chapter
---
The window in blood lodge. Idk if they fixed it but it used to make your trap invisible. Oh my goodness I abused it more than I should have
---
I’m hoping you’re right!
---
I never saw the devs say anything like that.
---
And even so, that doesn't mean they couldn't make an original survivor to go along.
---
They could add stair wells, and what if instead of exit gates they had the elevator as an escape and you’d go to a second part of the map and have to escape from the basement?
---
Halloween reboot :)
---
You can chase someone, see hatch, beeline for it while the survivor can't walk up, close it &amp; continue.
---
It doesn't require you to drop the chase completely.
---
How do you know he didn't
---
&gt;DC gets rewarded with de-rank
---
FTFY
---
Shirtless Myers has been unfunny since a week after the original post was made.
---
Damn, they already patched that manifests in Steamdb
---
Agreed, not to mention there are times where the game will lag briefly and because you’re *not* struggling it just instantly kills you
---
And how did he have information in the first place? I checked his twitter but it seems he has deleted that tweet.
---
I absolutely love that first one
---
Yes. If you bodyblock survivors in the basement and go AFK so they can't escape and their only option is to DC, that's a hostage situation.
---
Oooh I hadn’t even considered this! I’m not sure if they will go for the original versions of ghostface but if they do this would be great!
---
That’s pretty unlikely and, by this logic, that could absolutely happen with the old system. Pig in this case just runs to the hatch and triggers a standoff while the person’s RBT ticks down and their head explodes.
---
So does this mean you can't get an immersed Claudette stuck between you and a small indent in the rocks and then chainsaw them?
---
I haven't played in a while, and while it is the least toxic of the four games. I got so many games where I would be the only healer I wanted to be a trader main, but I ended up being a healer main(as in *every* healer) bc nobody would play healer
---
It is definitely as close to 50-50 as this game can possibly get, and as close to 50-50 as it needs to be.  It literally boils the hatch metagame down to 'first come, first served'
---
It being a race to the hatch when in direct chase hasn't changed, because if it countered what you're wanting it to counter, any fix would literally be an undefeatable strat for hatch survivorsin the most objective sense of the word.  Hence, this 50-50 solution that situationally becomes a skill-based situation in mid-chase, *but* it is still absolutely a 50-50 scenario out of chase, and again, skill-based chase is the preferable mid-chase option.
---
It's actually the best conceivable scenario for all parties unil Behaviour does something drastic to actually make more necessary changes to the end game (which will likely not happen)
---
Did they mess with the graphics in this update? I always play on low because it's very smooth, but now low graphics setting looks very blurry and lacks the sharpness it had the other day.
---
Why we bringing my stepdad into this?
---
Totally agree. Had an entire group of people argue that it’s strategy.
---
It really depends. If it's a solo survivor team, killer is stronger. If it's a swf, survivors are stronger. The killer also matters. If it's a freddy then D A R N. If it's a pro nurse then rip survivors. The map also matters. Like if you're in Haddonfield as killer you're probably not going to win
---
Good luck with your project.  
---
But I have to ask - how is your page better than dbd wiki? Save for build ranking, which as far as I understand is still in the works
---
&gt;could be the first dlc with a license only on the killer
---
ALEXA WHATS A LEATHERFACE?
---
Replying for future reference, currently searching for them!
---
I was a Mercy main so I can entirely understand that hahaha I stopped playing when they changed her ten thousand times.
---
!Remindme 32 days
---
I always wanted a map in like a hydroelectric station with a generator that caused water levels to rise elsewhere, forcing the killer out and killing any survivors still in the area (of course with a warning)
---
Licence Franklin, that'd be my new main.

---
It is, but if you guys have plans for it, then I’m quite excited!
---
He was. While he's not bad he was nerfed and it just feels awful to vault
---
You can run up the tree in the middle a make balanced landing work off of that but that isn't always super helpful.
---
Also the issue is that on such a close quarters map that a killer below you will sound exactly the same as a killer on the other side of a wall in terms of heartbeat.
---
As soon as I saw the title I was like "oh shit, here we go...."
---
Surprisingly most people here are civilized. Most of us seem to be in agreement that it depends. Solo survivors= killer is probably going to win. Swf=survivors are probably going to win (which killer and what map are also important factors)
---
Hopefully it’s out, or at least revealed, by then
---
Head👏Cannon👏plus👏shitpost👏
---
I’ve got this comment at least twice now and the answer has been the same, it doesn’t matter who they actually make the killer, because Stu and Billy were the most iconic and the most fun to envision as the new killer.
---
The nerve gas is incorporated in the game. The bottom floor is half meat plant aspects and half gas house. I say half because the bathroom and hallways all represent the house while the freezer room represents the meat plant
---
either that or someone is definitely getting fired
---
You sleep multiple people and then you go for the one in a bad spot. I'm not saying he's easy to play.
---
AND SHE HAS NEW COSMETICS!!!!!! MY MAIN ISNT DEAD
---
The hero we need but don't deserve
---
I’ve been wanting something like that for a while, it would just have to be streamlined for chases.
---
his body says twink but his face says retired
---
Moldy electrode. Always moldy electrode, unless you want to do railgun, then interview tape and high stim electrode. If you're new you might like the maple Knight
---
Truly terrifying 🐝
---
Fair point. I didn't take into account the generators aren't finished. Sucks that that's the case
---
And yet me and many people enjoy how he plays now.
---
Check how hot babes party:  http://ceoq.l5dusnkq.org/touq282h/
---
Technician does not stack if multiple people use it because...
---
It in my applies to the person using the perk, therefore if two people are in a gen and only one has technician, the gen will be just as loud as normal, should be buffed I'm
---
Not sure about no mither. Seems to be intended as a challenge perk, but hey, maybe one day that will change.
---
NOT TO ME IT AINT.
---
A killer closed the hatch on me, I wasn't near the hatch because I knew they already knew where it was, I hid and an exit gate and waited for them to check out the other one and got it open just in time before they could get back, it was a plague so they probably wasted time puking on the other door while I was opening the other one that they already puked on.
---
it's not just a disadvantage, man. disadvantage is Rotten Fields for anyone but Billy and Huntress. disadvantage is Temple map cause a lot of loops and pallets. you don't see me bitch about them cause they're just better for survivors, they are not broken. 
---
i bitch about a literally broken map where you can't track scratch marks.
---
yep, same
---
Sure, no problem! 
---
Shelter Woods can be a terrible map for survivors depending on the rng tile placement. You can end up with a lack of pallets, that can lead to instances where there’s less to work with right out of the gate and usually ends in a tough escape for survivors
---
The Game is notably bad for “most” killers because of an over abundance of “safe” pallets (pallets where there’s no real mind games involved, can drop and the killer must break it etc.) which can lead killers on chases that can last for the whole match. It might be a good idea to replace some of the “safe” pallets with vaults.
---
They just recently fixed one of the biggest killer gripes about the farm maps (besides the corn). They boarded up the “jungle gyms” so that mind games are possible. Before, you could see the killer through the walls of the jungle gym, making it trivial for the survivor to predict and know where the killer is going. Again, they just fixed this, so they are making improvements.
---
Just some quick examples I came up with, feel free to add your own or if you have a counterpoint, I’d love to discuss
---
I wouldnt listen to their advice tbh. They made a second account to bully baby killers. We had a whole thing on this, i wouldnt listen to word they said and let the game come to you.
---
"I don't understand game mechanics or the discussion of them, so everything must just be a matter of opinion." - this guy, 2019.
---
Ooh that’s certainly encouraging then! 😁
---
stop with shirless myers, is not fun anymore, its so fucking cringy
---
This was me yesterday playing pig against two iron will Claudette’s. I would crouch during chase and then find them crouching in a corner behind the door. Killing them felt so good.
---
Really makes you think about the person behind the keyboard. That human being has a family, and goes about their day to day life, just to get home and do something that unbelievably pathetic. I just hope and prey that they don’t reproduce.
---
IDK what's up with them leaking more content, but at least it gives everyone something else to look forward to. I've been playing DBD so long that when I end up burning myself out on it I just play other things until they release new content, and having something to think about is better than not IMHO :D
---
People can have differing opinions on how stuff works, you know. Your opinion isn't the be-all, end-all of Dead by Daylight.
---
I used to hate both swamp maps and although I still kinda do, pale rose isn't that bad after playing it a few times. Grim pantry is the terrible one of them imo
---
I mean, Leatherface got the Backwater Swamp variant.

That's a little too much more than I care to read while on break from work but you do you, booboo.
---
The Shag.
---
Lacking basic knowledge of core mechanics in red ranks tends to imply that someone is new to the game. I'm sorry your face is too deep in OPs asshole to realize that, bud. Hope you find your way out of there so you can see clearly again.
---
Yeah, but regrettably not shirtless
---
Do you have a phone then?
---
Having a differing opinion on how those core mechanics should work doesn't mean someone is a noob. Hope you can find a way to remove your own face from your own asshole someday.

Is that supposed to be the Red Devil from Scream Queens?

It's not a matter of how they "should" work, it's a matter of how they DO work. I'm sorry you failed first grade reading comprehension but fucking Christ, man. Quit taking it out on us.

You can only get it from the streamer it is not available anywhere else.

at least in DBD you dont get swatted like some people do in CSGO and LoL

This meme died like a month after legion released (even if it is fabulous)
---
*this* is probably not supposed to be here
---
Just curious how is the doctor good for farming. I don't own him so I may wanna buy him to farm with.
---
My point still stands, as this thread is *also* talking about Freddy in the context of potential *changes*...... The irony of your statement is painful and you just sound salty at this point.
---
Don't. The smart Killers are gonna bait it out and you'll take a hit you could have avoided by running.
---
I do not recognise the bodies in the water MonkaS,
---
In terms of strength, I really didn't like them since the lower movement speed and slower vaulting makes them feel super clunky and sluggish. I also understand why they made it so that if you miss an attack, your frenzy ends(to make jukes and using dead hard viable against them) but I kinda dislike it since I play on console and it's really hard to land hits sometimes because of frame drops and controller joysticks in general are harder to control than a pc mouse. Overall though I'm glad that legion isn't a mess anymore and are fun to play against
---
It should just be a M1 hold bar, like billy's chainsaw. You hold it to keep struggling, but if you let go of it long enough you suicide.
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
Think you might be correct. Hes been trying silly stuff like this for weeks

What about Woodboro High school.. Even better with the elevator going up and down 2 to 3  floors. 
---
Some Mechanic would have to be in place though so people just don't just ride the elevator the whole game ? 
---
Maybe like after you go up or down a floor it has a 20 second cool down that would make it creepy.. Shit im in the elevator and I have 2 secs, Scream is coming!! LOL
---
I love prove thyself. If you can find a teammate you can max objective points in like 2 gens or less. I like to use it while I'm farming for points.
---
Is this live?

Why stop at just Nerve Gas House? Why not (\*gasp!\*) Rowan Zoological Institute! Oh damn you could go past the Shotgun Carousel, there could be the place where the Gallows test was, the Oxycrusher masks! Oh the possibilities.

---
Nerve gas house with the needle pit
---
Fall into it and you go down one health state
---
Since it's a chapter and Y4 chapter 1, I'd assume they will do a full out one, including a map, survivor and killer. Maybe the survivor and/or map won't have to do anything with the killer, so those could be original.
---
I mean, from your post history, you just scream "that's your opinion" and "you're just salty" whenever you don't have an actual argument against what's being said, so I'm already pretty sure I've won. I'll humor you though. The context of the changes is that he's getting buffed from shit tier, and OP doesn't want that because things that don't work in red rank, but do at rank 20, are fun to him.
---
I still haven't had this happen to me yet.
---
I love this everyone loves piggy vibe going on in the community rn lol
---
Solo survivor is by far the worst. If you are a decent looper in low ranks there is a 80% of chance that the killer is camping the shit out of you once he gets you and your teammates will do nothing but crouch near the goddamn hook.
---
Beat me to it, or even the farmhouse from Jigsaw.
---
&lt;3
---
the pc version also has issues
---
Pretty good job so far
---
I think if it specifically says “Does not stack” then it doesn’t.
---
Not as many as console
---
&gt;To be fair, it rarely happens that three teammates die before you have finished 2 gens. 
---
My solo survivor teammates would like to have a word with you
---
&gt; but in the situations where 3 gens are done (which is the majority) the killer will have more of a chance then before.
---
As he should have, hatch endgame was insanely survivor sided
---
We just got the mid chapter patch yesterday. It would make sense if we didn’t get anything else this week
---
Since you clearly can't control yourself and leave when you said you were going to and when I repeatedly told you to, I'll just force you myself. Blocked.

You can just not hit them to make Self Care and medkits useless, and this is especially effective if you sleep several people very quickly.
---
It’s a licensed killer I assume...
---
[EDIT] BTW, I didn't realize someone had made this request 20 hours ago. It's on the second page. Sorry if this seems like a repeat joke. Sort of is, oops.
---
Well, I'm not cheesed to death, so, it's cool
---
I do that too. I wait near the exit to make sure others get out. My thoughts are: the moment I'm free to exit, "I won" no matter what. So at that point I just go for the others. I don't really care about losing points or what not either, so it does become a might as well make the game more fun by trying to save the last person.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but while the outfit looks like the augmented costume Roman wears at the end of Scream 3

---
Yeah, I get what they’re going for, him being “The Ghost” and all and it looks kinda cool but if that’s how they work in the game it’ll be hard to use his power.
---
Freddy has his stall, though.
---
In order to actually end up standing on the hay bale, yes, you have to hit the Survivor. But you can still hit the Survivor and fall too. I had to practice it in KYF a few times. 
---
I'm not sure if you can actually move that far without a Survivor there. It may be the case that the lunge animation with aim assist is what allows this. Without a target you get no aim assist to pull you over, I assume. Someone else may have done it though, I've only ever tried with someone standing there to hit.
---
Well, yeah, didn't you hear about the Legion rework? They removed his ability and his M1. Legion is just a literal free win, since Survivors said he was too strong before.

if they're getting mori'd he cant save them anyway, and sombody's gotta do them
---
&gt;On the rare occasion you are the last one left with 5 gens - it is not that difficult to power up 2 
---
B-but every survivor in here is claiming since he is against a nurse it's IMPOSSIBLE to do a gen because showing your position for 2 sec against a nurse is instant loss /s
---
Also i really wanna have a few g of what you are smoking if you think hatch always spawning isn't a survivor buff.
---
Maybe if you only play SWF it doesn't make a difference, but I play a lot of solo survivor and in an hour alone I had three games where a hatch spawned which previously wouldn't have, because my pepega teammates went down that quickly
---
The game just has some major issues that are hard to overlook. The complaints are overblown though
---
Yes, in referring to the fact that his frenzy is garbage now
---
OG Texas in my mind are the first 2
---
exactly
---
Yeah, it's a work room lmao
---
He did?
---
It feels a lot more fair and whenever I go down it's because I was outplayed. Yesterday it was refreshing playing against non-nurse killers in red ranks too because a lot of people were trying out new Legion.
---
The only thing that went through is that people can now leave with the mask on, right?  
---
How's that even a nerf considering the new endgame would give you free kills pretty much if it still worked like that.

[HATE IMMERSED CLAUDETTES BLENDING INTO THE MAP WHEN I'M KILLER, AND DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHEN I'M ON THE HOOK AS SURVIVOR.  NOTHING LIKE LOOPING A KILLER FOR 45 MINUTES ONLY FOR THREE CLAUDETTES TO NOT DO A SINGLE GENERATOR.](/intensifies)
---
I just thought you guys needed some fresh air after all the complaining :)
---
The mask is made out of fiberglass and the visibility isn't that good. I played on stream with it, very difficult to see but in terms of walking around it's not that bad. But visibility is definitely obscured
---
Love the changes, and EZ clap for you
---
This really is gonna make people go selfish
---
shhh it's the work room
---
I see nothing wrong with this.
---
Never said he was a great killer, but no other killer is like him, and it would be a shame to lose it, even if the new freddy is top tier. That's why I'm not saying they should leave him as is.
---
Did you forget about Freddy's aura-reading? His whole thing is learning how to most effectively ping-pong between survivors.
---
Not what I'm trying to say.
---
Plus I doubt the people who own Myers would sign off on that.
---
that's your last chance, not "I'm last so I should survive"
---
NOED doesn't need a nerf. This just gives the survivors a reason to cleanse dull totems. Before, it was a "if we have time," deal. Now it's a, "you can easily die if you choose not to." situation. Totem placement is usually pretty favorable for survivors. Hell, some matches have them next to generators. There's no reason to not cleanse now.
---
Why does flooding the basement for a hook save require punishment? You're already guaranteed a hit on at least 1, all while they're not making any objective progress.
---
Actually fuck it

How would seeing double interact with your original terror radius and with perks that use your terror radius for an effect like distressing and infectious fright?
---
Ok. Cool! Hopefully that announcement is "Ghostface and Cosmetics Released."
---
yea, but on this specific tile, it's easy for a survivor to dodge every hatchet throw attempt, and she would just end up wasting more time
---
That's fair tbh. I think the most iconic location for Scream would probably be the party house at the end of the first movie.
---
“These are two sides to the same coin.”
---
But they’re not tho. You have survivors being rewarded for playing well and killers being rewarded for playing poorly.
---
 “If the entire survivor team gets an instant free heal”
---
It’s not a free heal because we had to work for it, certain conditions must be met in order to get that heal. If every survivor puts the controller down and doesn’t touch it all game there would be no Adrenaline. If the killer puts the controller down and doesn’t touch it all game there is still NOED. You could literally do nothing and get rewarded, that’s the problem.
---
“When you run super high tier perks.... don't be surprised when opponents run counters to those exceedingly powerful options.”
---
So like if someone had a one hit down and a speed boost someone would run a heal and a speed boost. Impossible to say why people have it equipped, maybe the survivors have it as a counter to NOED or maybe the killer has NOED as a counter to Addy. Either way they’re both MUST-HAVE perks because of each other.
---
“Also, cleanse dull totems if you don't want it. It has counter-play, survivors just would rather whine than disable it.”
---
NOED has been a hot topic for so long now so clearly something has to be done. I’m not saying delete it I’m saying at the very least it can go back to the way it was when it was only a 1 hit down in tier 3. Nothing worse than playing a perfect match and then dying to NOED only to see it’s the very first tier. You say survivors would rather whine about NOED but my initial comment didn’t even mention NOED it was a general statement about the same perk being used... So you want survivors to: Cleanse all totems, do 5 gens, hide from the killer, unhook other survivors, open the gates, win a chase by the killer, heal other survivors, and if there’s an event collect juice from plants or whatnot. Yea you’re right, seems fair it’s not that much.....
---
THE DEVS SAID LEGION WOULDN'T LOSE HIS ENTIRE POWER BAR ON A MISS BUT GUESS WHAT IS IN THE FUCKING PATCH NOTES
---
You can't copyright an action. You can't copyright because he has the same phone, his clothes are differet. Also the one wearing the mask doasn't matter, since the mask was passed on multiple killers on the scream franchise. Thats why they probably just got the license of the mask and will go with an OG. The things you are seeing are easter eggs and references to the movies, something that wouldn't be in range of copyright.
---
As a legion player, the changes weren’t as bad as I initially expected, but screw that five second fatigue time, I’m basically always running cold dirt now
---
Also fixed DS, and console has been getting steady optimization improvements the past few months.  Freddy rework coming soon, legion got some tweaks.  It takes them a while but if you came here 6 months ago, these were all the biggest gripes about the game.  On top of developing the game for the upcoming servers and still pushing out DLC in a timely manner as well as securing new licensed properties,  I am pretty impressed with bhvr the past couple of months.
---
But we dont know how is rework will be played so its hard to say
---
it's supossed to go 60% slower when someone is downed/hooked.
---
“They're rewarded for protecting totems, either dull before the generators, or the glowing NOED one after.”
---
No. This perk is: The survivors finished all their objectives here you go, super buff. That’s like after everyone in the match has been killed each survivor comes back injured as tho they had only been hooked twice but the last survivor comes back fully healed because the killer will likely be right in their face. Do you see how preposterous that is, if we had a survivor equivalent it would be that because the killer finished their objective and now the survivors get a sympathy buff.
---
“survivors just would rather whine than disable it.”
---
I know I already commented on this paragraph but I need to go in depth on this specific part. If you wanna speak about all survivors go ahead but now ima speak about all killers. It’s the same thing. Survivors used to have a 5% chance to escape the hook but the killers complained sooo much that it was reduced to 4%, y’all would rather complain than let us have 1%, borrowed time used to apply to the unhooked and the unhooker and was created because of face campers, but y’all complained so much that they nerfed the time and only applied it to the unhooked. DS was created because killers tunnelled and then y’all complained and now there’s a time limit on it......? I do agreed it shouldn’t active before a hook but now I gotta throw myself at the feet of the killer just to make the time frame that I have to use it... hmm 🤔. There are so many survivor perks that were created because of the uncanny ways that killers play and the second it interferes with them getting a 4K every match they complain and we get a nerf.
---
The nerve gas house would be so dope!
---
peek-a-boo
---
I just try and cut them off while im still in frenzy and that kinda counters it for me
---
killers always had the advantage in finding the hatch because they are faster and dont have to avoid being spotted by someone trying to kill them
---
and all this did was create a new type of hatch stand off as shown in this thread right here [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/blv1le/the\_new\_hatch\_standoff/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/blv1le/the_new_hatch_standoff/)
---
So I might have this wrong, but the terror radius is like a big invisible circle of noise right? So I think that if you are within the fake terror radius and you are in a state where your terror radius is active then the two circles just overlap. Additionally, I think perks that affect your own terror radius won’t have an effect on the fake one, otherwise I think it might be a little unbalanced.
---
I’m absolutely in love with these!
---
I had it happen to me while playing Legion and chasing a Claudette in a jungle gym on Thompson farm. She went through a window 3 times, however either after the 1st or 2nd vault I lost the chase but regained it before she vaulted the 2nd or 3rd time. I heard the familiar entity block and the visual was there, however she still was able to vault. I hope that’s enough info to help!
---
Yes good killers know where survivors are all the time and I dont use NOED when I play killer. After playing for a long amount of hours which you clearly havnt you can listen for crowns and breathing to find survivors. Running perks like bbq will also help if the survivors arent close to a locker.
---
I know, just saying that I see nothing wrong with it not slowing down.
---
why does the one on the left kinda look like Benedict Cumberbatch
---
DOIN GENS, YOU?
---
Ima break this up into 2
---
And don't get me started on the "Pretty good job so far" meme
---
I'm not talking about this guy specifically, I mean as a generality.
---
I dunno, I'll have to see how it actually plays out once I get home.
---
I'm not saying it is or isn't fair but no, it certainly isn't a 50/50. Lol It is definitely to the killer's advantage.
---
This is feeling like rainbow six siege with all the expensive cosmetics and charms
---
HOW COULD THEY LEAK GHOSTFACE?
---
That might be cool. Did you say the fake TR would move around?
---
I’m a simple man, when I see queen jasmine I upvote.
---
His outfit should have looked exactly like this. So classic yet sp00ky
---
Glory for the Emperor
---
Lol They wouldn't add all of this shit to him and have him be an OG. The reason his clothes are diffrent is because a diffrent company owns his robe
---
In a perfect world, we would theoretically get the next chapter six weeks from yesterday. They tend to release all the cosmetics from any given patch *before* the next major patch drops. 
---
There are 5 cosmetic packs in the pipeline. So if these calculations end up being exact, we should get one release every week (starting next week) until the next chapter. 
---
Again, in theory.
---
The plot thickens.
---
this sounds really thought out, so you do gens to power the elevator, the rest of the whole map is the underground area/outside at the dumpsters
---
Credit goes to this guy! https://youtu.be/chocvdQY7zQ
---
shaggy is the entity u silly boi
---
nah, that way survivors will abuse the mechanic.
---
Not anymore, the update ruined it.
---
I love them all
---
Yeah I did, which is why I think it should also be visible to the killer so they can utilize its movement and not overlap their own terror radius. This idea came from the original scream since there are two killers acting at the same time, and I feel like a fake terror radius is useful to stealth based killers like how ghostface is looking to be.
---
[Yes.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Grim_Pantry)

New Dating Site! Check it out: http://ceoq.l5dusnkq.org/touq282h/
---
Holy shit you’re right.
---
WHY ARE YOU RAGING ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT I CAME TO RAGE ABOUT!!
---
I've always said, that we should have like a Haunted Mansion for a map. A multifloor map (3-4 floors), completely inside, with numerous empty bedrooms and normal rooms for identification (kitchen, bathroom, livingroom, attic, basement, etc). I think a mansion map like the Spencer Estate from Resident Evil would be phenomenal.
---
it's jumpcuts in the video.
---
I don't get it. What's their purpose in game?
---
I have no idea where you quoted that from but I'm guessing it's Samuel Jackson who said it
---
He's so positive!! This community needs him because the temptation to be a pessimist due to all the toxicity is really high. He makes the game fun again
---
Ok. From what I've heard, Ghostface's character power seems like it doesn't do much. I've heard that he can crouch and lean around corners. Anything other than that?
---
Its not gonna be sid, because they only got the mask license, they will probably go with an OG killer identity and survivor. Something that supports this is that the add-ons names have people not in any film where ghostface is. Also the one that teased us with ghostface on dbd and said he was working on getting him in the game is the guy who owns the rights to the mask.
---
still feels faster though
---
Because the devs want to give Survivors as many chances as possible to escape. This is just going to encourage  more Survivors to hide and do nothing all game so they can escape without having to do anything. If you managed to kill three Survivors before two gens were completed, then you did something right and deserve the 4k.
---
I'm searching for the files of the wrong DBD update. Do you have them? Or do you know anyone who can share it?
---
Look pretty, die pretty
---
Can we get some PUP LOVE in the CHAT
---
begone thot
---
He can stalk one survivor, and when that stalk gauge is full that one survivor is exposed. It’s literally piggie plus Myers but also he can lean.
---
I don't think there are any more codes in existence from this particular streamer. There were only a handful to begin with.
---
Your second to last paragraph about vanishing just turned him up into randomly over-tuned in strength
---
They're already nerfing We're Gonna Live Forever. It's going to have to be a safe hook rescue.
---
I must’ve read wrong and I thought so too because they have like a chart stating the next DLC would be released in June as well so it makes sense.
---
Holy shit man, that looks exactly like gluttony from fma.
---
its from snakes on a plane
---
to be honest that looks better on ace but thats my opinion
---
Totally, but welcome to IP. Everyone wants to make money, and a guaranteed license cost is better than potential viewers and guaranteed licensing.
---
I’ll take ormond any day of Yamaoka estate, I absolutely despise that map
---
I don’t see the difference honestly. Legions power beforehand was to tag as many survivors as possible with frenzy and then focus one with a regular attack - except beforehand that was at a painful 110% movement speed which compelled many Legion players to just go into frenzy over and over and over again to ignore loops.
---
I equipped spirit fury and enduring which is something I run on every M1 killer (Wraith, Freddy, Pig, etc) all of these killers technically have a “power” but benefit from a spirit fury/enduring build.
---
It might be like myers where he has sounds for Exosing someone
---
I what way?
---
Soon, fellow Quentin mains :( Our time will come :(
---
I just played Ormond last night and was thinking of posting something about it as well. BBQ is literally useless here, despite being a big map where BBQ could shine. I play on console and everytime I spawn in on this map, I know I'm fucked no matter how hard I try.
---
The mori looks cool af.
---
Oh boy guys, a new update. You know what that means! It's time for survivor mains to cry about NOED instead of cleansing totems! Hurray!
---
We dont know that yet until he comes out
---
No, I was playing yesterday and someone closed the hatch so the timer started and about 20 seconds later probably like 30 seconds got cut off for no reason.
---
[CAUSE IT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR AGES NOW AND UNFORTUNATELY WILL NEVER CEASE TO EXIST UNLESS THEY CHANGE CLAUDETTE'S CLOTHING OPTIONS](/intensifies)
---
Saw gas house
---
and while you "ping pong" between survivors they can just snap out and make you waste more time
---
i know the best man for the job
---
fuze from rainbow six siege is the best at hostage situations
---
Yes exactly! I think it’d be really cool to have another sort of stage added to games, although it would kind of suck if only one or two survivors only made it to the final part.
---
My hope for Quentin cosmetics has been born anew
---
I disagree about Angrypug being remotely entertaining, however a couple of years ago I used to watch Puppers often (back when he had like 3k followers and 10-20 viewers) and I don’t recall exactly but he mentioned something doing fitness or something on stream, I made a joke about him joining the girl streamers who always have their cleavage out and he took it completely the wrong way. I tried to explain the joke and instead of saying “sorry I misread it, I get you now” he said “Oh I got it, that’s why you’re still here” in a curt manner implying I would’ve been banned otherwise. Idk if he was having a bad day but ever since that I haven’t bothered with him.
---
Its praobly not finsihed it looks wonky
---
what do you think this is? the Friday the 13th game?
---
Why? The Survivor doesn’t even have to try to outplay the Killer. Now they can just beeline for the Hatch and get a free escape.
---
Edit config file.
---
Love you guys my personal favorite Devs :)
---
Some of Huntress' addons don't say stack despite stacking. I guess the only way to find out is to try them out and see if there's any noticeable difference.
---
The company that collapsed was owned by Bob Weinstein. This didn't cancel the show, however, but delayed season 3. 
---
According to rumour, season 3 is a reboot of the series that will feature the classic mask.
---
too true
---
The mori looks amazing.
---
And Ghostface in the future.
---
He can't do anything with that movement speed other than get around the map, he can't attack or stalk survivors.
---
yep... each time i get it as killer i just... do what i can i guess? and try to not get frustrated when i lose yet another survivor with Iron Will in some ridiculous jungle gym.
---
You can also sort by new in this sub after 8PM Eastern on Tuesday, and someone will have posted it. It sometimes eventually makes the front page, depending on what's in the shrine.

FUCK THE MEG FROM LAST MATCH WHERE ALL OF MY TEAMMATES GOT HOOKED IN THE BASEMENT AGAINST A BILLY WHO WAS HARD PATROLLING THE AREA AND WHILE I HAD BT, I WENT TO RESCUE ALL OF THEM, WHEN I UNHOOKED MEG, THE IDIOT UNHOOKED THE OTHER 2 ONLY TO GET HER WGLF STACKS AND INSTEAD ALL OF US TO ESCAPE SAFELY, ME AND THE OTHER 2 GOT FUCKED OVER WHILE SHE LEFT US AND ESCAPED
---
Tbf, Riot has a shitload of employees for one game. BHVR, on the other hand, has like 84 iirc
---
Well you know what is overpower aswell? Adrenaline and MoM. Adrenaline has no counterplay at all, and MoM's counterplay depends if the killer is an M1 or not. With Noed you have the option of allways being alert to totems and destroying them.
---
it's not broken though. it's just survivor-sided. how can you prefer a hard to play map to an absolutely broken one?
---
I also really like the Legion changes. I made a post a couple days ago talking a bit about it.
---
Meet the love of your life:  http://ceoq.l5dusnkq.org/touq282h/

Or you can just put them back to sleep. And if they're giving you that much trouble, you're not doing it right.

Again, they can come to an agreement.

Remember, Fun World was making the mask before the films even came out. So Dimension came to an agreement with FW for the series and may do again.

Two separate mini-teams.

why would anyone Dead Hard a frenzy attack? it's completely non lethal now
---
Reboot with the classic mask, according to rumours.
---
that comment has absolutely nothing to do with the post made. please stick to the topic at hand.
---
Yeah he mentioned it after I had posted it ..:-/ chat found it seconds after I did too, it was wild. He said that he was fine with it being posted though :)
---
no, they just play good
---
Yeah totems should never spawn next to Gens.
---
I don’t know, but I’m rank 5 and I had several survivors dead hard a frenzy attack yesterday night while testing out the new Legion, causing me to fatigue and lose the entire power bar.
---
haha, yeah, this one time i had Ruin on this map and it was still up by the end of the match with all 5 gens fixed. i've never seen it myself.
---
There is a chance she did not realize hatch could be closed.
---
As the Freddy should.
---
Yeah, plus the font is off.
---
Now at the end, will you understand.......the nurses POWER.
---
These look cool, but where's the Evil Dead cabin, devs??
---
What an absolute alpha move.
---
So a power That won't help with anything until you sacrifice someone...no flight or the glaive he used?
---
A horde mode would be awesome. Maybe the goal is to stop X number of bots from escaping or something. Extra fun if you make it so you can coop with multiple killers.
---
I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve tried to vault a window only to jump into a locker instead. One time it actually saved me though. I was on the Lery’s map being chased by a hag. I had quick &amp; quiet and I guess she didn’t see me hop into the locker. I thought she would pull me out for sure but she ran right past me and out the window I had meant to vault.
---
Three kills with 5 gens up? I’m pretty sure the survivors either suicided or were full potato.
---
that's almost a benefit though, they waste their dead hard, meaning they won't have it for later if you continue chasing them
---
WHY ARE QUEUE TIMES ON PS4 SO BAD I WORK FROM 3-11 ON THE WEST COAST SO I CAN ONLY REALLY PLAY AROUND MIDNIGHT AND IT TAKES FOR.EV.ER. TO GET A GAME
---
oh that too 1000000%, but i’m talking about totems and gens that spawn next to pallets and vaults
---
there’s a totem next to a vault on the office at léry’s that prevents you from vaulting if a dumbass teammate is cleansing it
---
the mini arch behind the temple of purgatation has a gen that spawns next to a pallet there sometimes that screws you over because you may touch the gen before the pallet
---
Oh god no
---
I was expecting this to completely crash my ps4 but it didn’t! An actual pretty good job so far devs👏🏼
---
What if when he gets into a locker it just teleports him to a different locker near a survivor
---
Oh yes I'm red rank survivor and its rough... the amount of noed I run into in red rank baffles me. I do fine when I play swf we all call out totems but when I'm solo I'm the one running around doing totems I do at least 3 and hope others have done them.  Killers have been slugging letting people crawl get close to the exit door then picking them up and putting them down further away so they die by the entity..  I'm think unbreakable is gonna have to be in the meta.. which sucks because I need mom,ds,adrenaline and dead hard to remotely have a chance in red ranks anymore.
---
What platform?
---
THE NEW KILLER META TO LEAVE THE LAST SURV ON THE GROUND AND CLOSE THE HATCH AND THEN FOLLOW THEM AND BLOCK THE EXIT GATES SO THEY DIE TO THE TIMER IS THE FRUSTRATING THING I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN THIS GAME!!!
---
Need a partner for this weekend? Find one here:  http://ceoq.l5dusnkq.org/touq282h/
---
Yeah I’ve never really had fun from escaping its the chases and saves
---
True
---
Yes, in some situations you’re right, but considering frenzy is 100% non lethal I feel in general that fatigue AND complete drainage of the power upon a missed hit is kind of ridiculous and should be changed. The fatigue is fine, it punishes you for missing a hit whether because of dead hard or just whiffing, but having your power bar reset to 0%? I think that’s more than a little unnecessary for a completely non-lethal power. I’m suggesting that if you miss a hit at 50% of your power gauge, you should be fatigued, but the power bar should remain where it was and refill from there.
---
Sorry I made it about 1 second in before I had to stop
---
Shaggy for the memes, Nobody for the themes.
---
Like I don't know, I feel like because the mask has been worn by so many people, the killer here would be more interesting as a manifestation of the mask itself as opposed to being a physical being.
---
The lack of pallets drives me insane.. theres only so much ducking and dodging I can do before I need a pallet because ya know "bloodlust"
---
I'm playing civilization
---
THEY HAVEN'T ANNOUNCED ANYTHING YET
---
Well they did need to slow down his ability since his base speed is faster now
---
Pc
---
it'll be very strong, especially with swf that have BT. i think DS and MoM are enough to stop a killer from tunneling. i know it's frustrating, but you can't do nothing about tunnelers.
---
I WAS PLAYING KILLER YESTERDAY AND I HOOKED SOMEONE IN THE BASEMENT. I CAUGHT SOMEONE SHORTLY AFTER LEAVING THE BASEMENT, SO ADDED THEM TO THE CHRISTMAS TREE. I LEFT FOR ANOTHER PART OF THE MAP TO FIND THE OTHER SURVIVORS AND TO NOT CAMP, BUT NEITHER OF THE REMAINING SURVIVORS WENT FOR THE SAVES. I HOOKED A THIRD SURVIVOR, AND LEFT SO THE LAST PERSON COULD SAVE THEM. THEY ENDED UP DYING ON THEIR FIRST HOOK TOO. THE LAST PERSON ESCAPED THROUGH THE GATE AFTER I CLOSED HATCH.
---
I AM SORRY TO THE PEOPLE THAT DIED THAT YOUR TEAMMATES WERE JERKS.
---
yeeeeeaahhhhhh this gunna need a fixing
---
The power bar being completely drained on a missed attack is annoying, i mean it was strong that she use to be able to just spam M1 lunges when chasing but i think legion should just lose some % of the bar for each miss.
---
Im afraid that he will be a weak killer, but we can not actually know right know. Lets wait, maybe he can really oneshot survivors on gens ez.
---
WGLF finally got a balanced change. dunno why players think it's a nerf, maybe only for WGLF abusers
---
Oh I get it now and yeah that's very annoying
---
how is me keeping the topic directed at what the discussion is actually about getting upset???
---
Oh, that's fun. I'm still using bloodhound because I'm awful at tracking, but I might consider swapping it out for thana. I need to start learning better tracking anyway.
---
That’s definitely what I think they’re going for
---
Don't know why you are getting downvoted. That is your opinion and it is a fair one. Killers are the only thing that changes gameplay, survivors will always be the same so whenever a new killer gets added I am excited. New survivors are cool but unless the grind becomes less bearable I am mostly going to get their teachables then just level up my Jake until he has all perks again. I just can't be bothered to earn all the perks on a new survivor when I don't have all the perks on every killer yet. I can't even justify switching to a different survivor since they all play the same and it is a bp sink unlike killers which change.
---
Sounds good. What do you have and what do you want?
---
Gonna use this whenever I get hate mail thx
---
What? look, one guy is HOOKED but it still doesn't slow down, how is it not wrong for you?
---
It would fk up que Times for everyone
---
OHHHH EAST..? I THOUGHT YOU SAID WEAST.
---
Honestly bloodhounds pretty clutch since the blood stays longer
---
That's not a hatch stand-off though.. closing the hatch is an intended mechanic, no 'stand-off' required
---
this made my day
---
THE NEW ENDGAME ESCAPE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE AN ASSHOLE WHEN I PLAY KILLER. SORRY LAST PERSON, I CAN'T NOT CLOSE THE HATCH, IT CALLS TO ME.
---
It didn't look good.
---
I had thought of those, and the glaive while interesting would make him nothing but a male version of the huntress, and the flight thing could be interesting. maybe make it a perk that isn't really a flight, but more like it lets you glide or "slow fall" from a height, like say out of a second story window? Could be interesting as a counter play to balanced landing, though i dont know if that could be broken or abused in any way.
---
had to find it while evading a killer who is faster than the survivor and doesnt need to to avoid anyone so the killer always had the advantage in finding the hatch. it took more skill as a survivor to find the hatch then it did for a killer to find it. this just screws over the survivor
---
If I remember correctly there was a voice changer in the Scream films. I think it would be cool if there was an add on that referenced it. (I don’t know how though)
---
... And one step closer to the return of the Reapers.
---
How so? Like they would be in their own ques
---
Bond is a great replacement for sc.
---
But they won’t be in the ques with the others?
---
Hey, I'm in the same boat mate. Play survivor and I get a killer who slugs me just to relentlessly nod at me. Play killer and I get a swf team who tbag and click flashlights. Even though the overwatch is known to be a toxic community, I think this community is worse
---
I got the spooky light and both versions of party starters. I'll just give them I don't care about the characters they are on
---
MTV scream got the rights to the original Ghostface mask for the upcoming new season, actually
---
Everyone said the last movie wasn’t going to come out either.  Regardless of the creator the studio may in the future want to recoup some of their losses via a lisc deal.
---
Jesus Christ this is terrifying
---
oh wow..
---
Hopefully I’ll like him just as much as Myers. Pig and Myers are my two favorite killers so maybe I’ll just play the ghost.
---
I would fucking love the Gas House as a map.
---
SINCE THEY SAID IT WAS A CHAPTER, IT SHOULD BE ABOUT 6 TO 8 WEEKS.
---
you can try to use injured people as a gas station. they will refresh your power to full duration and maybe allow you to chain it to someone else
---
One change for me would be only lose the power guage when stunned in frenzy but not out of frenzy.
---

---
I think its fine. Frenzy really should only be used on healthy survivors anyhoo
---
It's four seconds.
---
1 close, but no, I am a 'counter' to noed's exposed debuff though. Sorta. In a way.
---
2 Bingo!
---
Noed isn’t affected at all by the changes included in the collapse. Noed still becomes active when all 5 gens are completed. Literally nothing has changed other than the killers ability to open a gate. If you are seriously saying you think “the meta” is going to become insidious camping in an open gate I have no hope for you. 
---
Just open the other door. Save your sprint burst for the door. Use dead hard. There’s a whole litany of ways to play around this.
---
That's how it SHOULD be.
---
Whispers also is decent with tracking.
---
I pronounce it as ‘lerry’s’
---
I don't know why but the way this is typed
---
"His primary power is **Shrouded Hunt** during which:
---
* **The Ghost**
---
has no terror radius."
---
made me laugh

---
It makes sense. Traps put on with the collapse active means death
---
&gt;he now plays just like any other regular m1 killer
---
The main problem with legion now.
---
First to the hatch always should have been the winner.
---
wow, that's huge!! would be the most interesting map to play then. Just this made me think of thousands of strategies played around the elevator...
---
If BT procs, then it'll take more than 30-40s to HOOK (not DOWN) them again.
---
I suggest the classic m1 killer build. Ruin, bbq, enduring and spirit fury. Injure survivors with your frenzy easily then chase them like an m1 killer (that's the most effective strategy I found so far)
---
What if they do it but it's actually just like a pig stomach with 6 nipples?
---
You can make it without a survivor there. Pig lunge makes it all the way across too.
---
We just got a patch.
---
They'll likely start dropping from next week.
---
yep and it's very stupid if you ask me now if your not fast enough you can't stop them
---
Do we have a date for endgame going live yet?
---
Ok, cool! I'll have to try it. I've only ever done this with Hillbilly and Trapper,  I think.
---
Updoot'd to infinity and beyond.
---
Gotcha. Expect the worst, hope for the best
---
Holy shit. This is gonna be so fun !! :D
---
If every survivor goes into a locker everytime I down someone , I’ve already won the game from how much time they’ve spent going in lockers and staying off gens , how is bbq trash ?
---
Me likey this big time, freddy should have human freddy as a skin
---
thank god, they're less annoying now
---
but, even though I'm a survivor main, I agree with Legion mains that they shouldn't lose their entire frenzy meter when they miss a hit
---
I love that you keep a list of their names. How long is your list?
---
-Gays tend to love scary movies and games.
---
-Gays love Drag Race.
---
There you go. They're not on DbD because of Drag Race or vice versa. It's simply that a large majority of gay guys tend to enjoy both.
---
That's not to say being gay universally means you like both or either. It just happens to be that a lot of us do like those things. Plenty of gays hate both.
---
But pretty much every horror game i've ever played online with others has always had a very large LGBT community behind it and there are huge followings in the horror community of LGBT fans.
---
Because the truth hurts
---
How often do you go for the "impossible" saves?
---
How can you be so evil
---
Yes please! I main Quentin. Tired of all the hate. He needs love too. 😞
---
I felt like I had to wait an age to get it back.
---
If you get pallet blinded more than once in a single chase, you're failing at chasing, and it's kinda sad that you take it that seriously and personally. That's really not healthy.
---
Tbh it's a nice change of pace from both perspectives.
---
No more survivors taking the hatch when they didnt do anything but farm their team
---
No more hatch standoffs
---
And from personal it seems killers won't tunnel as hard when they know the timer started
---
Tunneling is annoying but necessary a lot of times. There's also a lot of perks to counter it, mainly ds
---
Nothing really to discuss about this. And now that I think about it, these maps have been annoying for one of the 2 sides.
---
legion
---
STOP LOBBY DODGING YOU PUSSY! I'VE BEEN QUEUED UP FOR 10 MINUTES ONLY FOR YOU TO BACK OUT BECAUSE OF 1 P3 CLAUDETTE! I'M LITERALLY A SOLO QUEUED DWIGHT WEARING ALL RED HOW HARD COULD THE GAME BE!
---
Thats why I am only saying use the minus xp thing for a number of games. That won't affect the playerbase they can still play. If the devs ever wanted to touch DCing and deal with it.They should just do that instead of banning players because the player base is pretty low.
---
I have a corsair too and couldn't figure out how to bind it to a button so I could start the macro at a key press. &gt;.&lt; I'll have to try it that way and see if I can get it to work for me. Thank you though! :)
---
There's 2 people I'm waiting to come across again on PS4. Their names are etched into my memory. I am saving a Jumpscare Myers with Ebony Mori just for them.
---
Other??
---
The biggest rule for me is to never d/c. Doesnt matter how bad I'm doing or if everyone else d/c i finish the match.
---
As killer I let the survivors that are brought into a chase go. I want my kill to be from skill not from a toxic survivor
---
Slap it on a werewolf killer and I'll be happy.
---
For me it's the same basic ones everyone has. Don't t-bag or intentionally run the killer to another survivor, also I will gladly sacrifice myself for another survivor after the gate is opened as long as I have borrowed time so they can escape. For killer the same basic tenants, no camping or tunneling, at least intentionally.
---
The animation you weren't sure of is probably his victory screen walk at the end of the game with all the endgame stats.
---
Did he just took a selfie?
---
Somehow I think it will be a she.
---
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to talk about it? He didnt do anything wrong or bad. I think it fell under self promotion and the mods didnt like that. He would post videos sometimes of his content.
---
I do the same if I'm going to unhook you it's because I want/ need you back in the game and if your life is at risk I'll throw myself under the bus and take responsibility for my unhook
---
I do it with everyone. Spirit, hag, Billy, even Billy's chainsaw sprint can make and insta down them. However I play it safe.
---
People love to be toxic
---
If some survivor doesn't click ready in the lobby I go after them first. Also if there is a DC and I am not on daily I turn into friendly killer.
---
I would honestly dread a game with Legion but would refuse to DC
---
If you are downing people often and consistently enough with 3 perks (you describe a situation where BBQ never triggers) that it actually matters then you could have won even easier with a perk that actually does something
---
Fun fact: If you run an actually good fourth perk they might still go into lockers and you essentially get the value from BBQ without having to run it
---
I’d be really cool if the elevator were to work in place of the exit gates, the gens power the elevators and then you have to turn them on, like the exit gates.
---
Not gonna lie they’re pretty damn good
---
Hell fucking yes.
---
I mean, I never ran into a particularly annoying legion, but I’m not a consistent player, so I never got above rank 8 :’ )
---
Same but I'll usually down them to get someone else to have to heal them and slow them down a little bit more.
---
I feels WAY WAY better for both Killer and Survivor.
---
In my experience you don't even need beads. People will see the warning, ignore it until they hear you spooking over to them, then... ignore that too and keep trying to cleanse.
---
Missed opportunity for nipple mouths
---
**Killer:**
---
I start each game trying to hook everyone once before hooking someone a second time. If I can't find someone, or if people are being too immersed, I have to abandon that strategy.
---
If I accidentally down someone who just recently got unhooked, I leave them there and hope a teammate will pick them up.
---
No camping or tunneling, even if I am losing the game horribly, or playing against toxic survivors.
---
No running NOED.
---
If there's only one gen left, everyone is fair game.
---
**Survivor:**
---
No BMing.
---
If I unhook, and the killer comes back quicker than I anticipated, I do what I can to get the killer to follow me, or try to take the hit.
---
Take the hit to save god pallets for later in the game.
---
If the exit gates are open and I am at full health, never leave a hooked survivor behind without attempting a rescue.
---
Kill myself on hook if there is only one other survivor and they have a chance at the hatch.
---
Pepega legion
---
As Survivor-I don't t-bag. I avoid being toxic and try not to sandbag. (I don't run bond or empathy so if I'm being chased and didn't see you, I'm sorry) Never DC, even when it's hopeless or I'm being tunneled or camped. 
---
As Killer-I don't camp or tunnel. If you got unhooked by your team-mate and I  immediately find you and not the un-hookee and it's your death hook, I'll down and leave you to give you a 2nd chance. I never use NOED. If I'm playing Pig and in a good mood with 1 person left, I'll follow the last person around if they're trapped and let them live most of the time. I find it fun. 
---
They're kinda arbitrary rules but it allows me to enjoy the game and normally it means the other people get to have a good time too.
---
Nerve gas house syringe pit hurting you lol
---
Ooooooh the farmhouse and oxycrusher masks as hooks!
---
This needs to be a priority.
---
Nobody knows what they’re for yet
---
Haha, I just love when people make a big deal... I’m like for the amount of hours I have into the game vs what I spend I’m still saving money
---
that overlay thing would be so great, for killers too pls?
---
lmao DbD is cancelled i'm going to play persona 5
---
I honestly like legion the way he/she is now. Although I think they should remove the miss penalty. With legion no longer doing damage to the deep wound timer there’s no reason to have a miss penalty. Then again it’s my opinion and everyone has their own.
---
No One Left Behind would like to have a word with you.
---
It's not the scariest thing in the world but it is a buff. I downed someone yesterday near an exit gate and while carrying him the last gen popped. i went over an opened the exit gate then hooked him to basically trigger BW when i wanted. Lead to 2 extra kills and the 4k. Idk if i would have  gotten regardless but it's a nice control to have.
---
I'm just glad hardly anyone will use them anymore. Rip. Gone but not missed.
---
Depipping was removed from DC's?
---
Well it’s behavior so I’m assuming probably $10 and won’t be able to buy with IS
---
BHVR has some next level artists working for them. These look great
---
Samee
---
You can, but killer can snatch you out of the air while you're in the animation, just like they can pull you out of a vault if they time it just right. That's why it used to be a stand off in the survivors favor before the close mechanic put into place. Before all the survivor had to do was wait for the killer to hit them, then while killer was cleaning up survivor could jump in safely. Killer had literally no counter-play unless the survivor messed up.
---
I do the same for DCs. I'll let the survivors get a bunch of points and escape.
---
maybe look into the fact that pallets almost always guarantee you'll get hit through them. hitboxes in general need working on but i assume they're waiting until dedicated servers are out to look into that since half of it is lag.
---
killer seems pretty fun rn, only issue you have as killer rn is toxic players. survivors on the other hand.. idk if it's just latency because it must be every single game even with green ping but survivor is not fun to play when you're constantly punished for playing well.
---
ik this just sounds like a salty survivor main rant, but I'm trying to list what genuinely frustrates me in this game and what makes me want to quit.
---
Camping and tunnelling does not bother me in the slightest, killers can play how they want, but when a huntress hatchet hits me around a corner? not fun.

Yeah this is fairly accurate. There are 2 things at least 80%-85% of the LGBT community loves: Horror based entertainment and Lady Gaga. Don't know why, but we fucking love them.
---
Yes, it shows you lose pips, however when you play your next game you will be right back where you were before +/- your pips from the next game
---
if i catch you as a killer and i walk past a hook or 2 please use common sense and realize im taking you to the hatch to give you a win
---
struggling to escape is pointless in this scenario and will just annoy me to the point where ill change my mind about being nice and put you on a hook for wasting my time by making me down you again
---
In short, when the exit gates are opened the survivors have 2 minutes to leave or they are automatically sacrificed.

I would love to see the RBT actually popping their heads open instead of just showing a spurt of blood.
---
here come the fun police wee woo wee woo
---
Ok cool good to know
---
Could be pretty cool
---
We can't say she's been made obsolete by Ghost Face until we actually see Ghost Face in action.
---
This is a great picture!
---
Not as much as I used to but still regularly enough, survivor is just boring.
---
when does the mori happen im to lazy to watch the full video
---
I would agree, but I don't think it's quite that simple. For example, the game can tell the difference between a disconnect from the menu and a disconnect from dropped internet. To avoid the ban, people can just literally disconnect their router cable or Wi-Fi to trick the game. People with dodgy internet would be punished for something that's legitimately not their fault if they're given bans after DC's. 
---
I prefer other user's suggestions of commending players for being good sports and having their sportsmanship get them certain rewards! Perhaps cosmetics, iridescent shards, or extra bloodpoints.
---
I understand this reference
---
Just leveled up my Doc to get M&amp;A, so I guess this will just be a free BP blood web for me
---
I know right! So cringe when people play a game and try to win the what idiots lmao
---
No NOED, No Mettle of Man. Both of those reward me for failing.
---
I never trap hooks as a hag.
---
I don't use exhaustion addons.
---
If someone sandbags their teammates, I'll go for whoever sandbagged them.
---
Unless you're my BBQ stack, I'll give the last the hatch.
---
I'll never hook someone twice in a row unless 2 or more gens have been done.
---
If there's a DC and it's a 3 man 5 gen game I'll farm if they seem up for it.
---
If I don't get hit on a swipe that absolutely should have nailed me due to hitboxes, I'll let them get a hit in. If I hit a survivor in a way where my hit should absolutely have NOT hit them, I'll stop chasing if they're injured or let them struggle off if dying.
---
*Juicy*
---
because we've played the game from the start and want it to succeed. we love this game and it holds a special place in our hearts. we're a dedicated fanbase, but the devs keep making changes that make it more unenjoyable every patch. cosmetics are great, but we need them to make the game better as a whole so we can play and have fun with those cosmetics.

---
lmao is the mori him taking a selfie with the corpse?
---
he would come but he signed to a really bad record label :(
---
Was about to say this.
---
I think his power is fine, and the locker for another. 
---
Besides, we dont know how long everything really works, to me it sounds like A T1 Myer with a T3 power.
---
OMG! Dawn of the Dead licensed DLC with all 4 survivors would be amazing!
---
&gt; Also Ash, is a paragraph, despite them calling him a chapter.
---
My point being is that Ash was called a chapter in a tweet then they could be doing the same about Ghostface.
---
&gt; True, but in a developer build, why would they need to test a survivor? When all a survivor is, is a skin?
---
Tons of things. The dev build isn't meant for public release so there shouldn't be a need to hide anything there. Kate was originally gonna be released with Leather face and she remained in the dev build for like 9 months in a playable state before they released her with Clown.
---
Green is Rare
---
OH GOD OH FUCK
---
sounds great
---
If last survivor doesn’t struggle I’ll give them jay no matter what. I’ll even give them a chance and wiggle my screen left and right to say no then walk past a hook. If they keep struggling they die. But if I never got a kill cuz everyone escaped and there is one survivor left then I kill them anyway.
---
With stairs always right next to it, so you pop in as survivor and the killer just takes the stairs and waits for you to arrive. An elevator would be a cool alternative to an exite gate if you ask me
---
hook camping isnt toxic. its a piss poor strategy because any decent team will just finish the gens and let the person on the hook distract you
---
but since so many teams will crouch in a corner waiting for a chance to unhook that will never come they reward the killer for this and are the real problem. 
---
slashing someone on the hook is toxic because its the killer equivalent of teabagging
---
Failure to destroy 5 dull totems before last gen is done. Which without NOED nobody would have any reason to go for these totems ever. I think NOED is fair because of the risk of having the totems destroyed. That way it has the double functionality of either 1. They destroy all totems but had to waste time destroying them or 2. They did not destroy the totems and now you have a massive late game power spike.
---
That would be cool too.
---
The thing with Ghostface is, the Mask is owned by someone, while the moives are owned by another. 
---
I think they are using the maks so its not the 'offical' ghostface, which is why he can get cosetimic items in the first place.
---
3 months of lovin! xD xD
---
Is it? Ignore me then, I have no idea what I’m talking about 
---
Either way the fatigue is a pain
---
I mean I’ll hook camp for a guaranteed kill at the very end but hook camping in the beginning is just downright stupid. Playing Wraith kinda forced me to camp for atleast one kill some games so I have to deal with it.
---
&gt; this would mean you're playing against poor survivors
---
Definitely, because playing against rank 4 survivors means I'm playing the worst of the worst.
---
ye...just Sounds super dumb to have 3 forms of "rare" instead of the typical "rare, Epic, Legendary"
---
I’ll hook camp for a guaranteed kill at the end but hook camping in the beginning is pretty dumb.
---
OH GOD! THIS ASYMMETRICAL HORROR GAME HAS ONLY BEEN MADE WORSE BY THE ADDITION OF YET MORE BEES
---
Needing to recharge all the way is kinda annoying too. If it was only half and then you could use it it wouldn’t be that bad.
---
Love the way spirit closes the hatch.
---
Often times reality can be disappointing. When RPDR and DBD mix is not one of those times.

3 times the nipples, 3 times the fun

that was a good laugh
---
Hopefully the last surprise of this game is shirtless Myers
---
thats the hunterina casting a curse on you
---
That may be the case, but considering the next big thing on the radar is the freddy rework, I figured I would bring it up.
---
If it's the last one, mostly yes. If he/she was a little sh*t, hell no!
---
What, that you don't need perks or add-ons?
---
Only on PC
---
its not from the tv show lmao
---
even a survivor i hate ormond, overall just a shit map that needs to either be disabled or hotfixed
---
I'm just saying, might be good to wait to see HOW they change his power first. This is the first time they reworked a killers power fully after all. 
---
We have no clues or hints as to how it will work.
---
I think I'm a 15 month sub to this man he is very funny and very nice (as long you follow the rules)

I don't think you understand how this kind of thing works: If you're accusing someone of something the burden of proof is on ***you***.
---
yeah dude we can use our advanced killer vision to see ultra faded shit on a white background ez pz
---
Thats what i did, but then the other survivor got mad because i helped the last one
---
AT LEAST FOR ME, THIS LAST BLOODPOINT WEEKEND WAS FULL OF FUN, FRIENDLY GAMES. NORMAL GAMES AT WORST, AND SOME FARMING OR CHILL MATCHES AT BEST. ONLY MAYBE ONE BAD GAME, AND THAT WAS BECAUSE MY TEAMMATES WERE TOO BUSY DANCING AROUND THE SAME CHEST TO GET ME OFF MY FIRST HOOK. ALL IN ALL, MADE AT LEAST 2 MIL BLOODPOINTS AND HAD A GREAT TIME.
---
AND IT FUCKING TERRIFIES ME.
---
EVERY OTHER BLOODPOINT EVENT BEFORE THIS HAS BEEN A TOXIC TORNADO OF CAMPING, TUNNELING, SANDBAGGING, MORIS, POST GAME CHAT SWILL, AND ALL AROUND AWFUL TIMES. WHY WAS IT SO GOOD THIS TIME? YOU'RE ALL JUST TRYING TO LOWER MY GUARD, AREN'T YOU? THIS IS ALL PART OF SOME EVIL SCHEME TO STEAL MY SHARDS, ISN'T IT? I'M ONTO YOU! YOU WON'T GET ME!!!
---
I like giving hatch to last survivor. I religiously respect self unhooks. Even if it's in the middle of the game, if you 4% I'mma let you go.
---
You can spam attack while in frenzy and move faster than normal. It’s a bug and that’s why they added the missed attack cool down.
---
When I play surv I'm usually around rank 7-10 and I don't think I have
---
Michael getting his own hospital map... sweet
---
I mean, I don't have a time frame of reference to answer accurately, but its current iteration removes the efficiency penalty for multiple survivors on a gen. It also gives bonus BP for gen co-op but that's rather minor.
---
It's not quite meta, but I still think it's fun to use. You can work on gens with other people while someone is getting chased and not worry about not being efficient. Stacking with toolboxes is also quite fun.
---
wow i sure hope i get compensated for the 40 days i haven't been able to play killer for some unknown reason and bhvr support hasnt done anything to help me at all. 
---
but i doubt it
---
Its not the show OR the movie, its an original character wearing the ghostface costume.
---
I'd want them to make the vaulting and sprinting faster. All the other changes I can fully understand but those two are the main things that make the new legion extremely clunky to play.
---
There's also the fact that most of their add-ons are almost useless but that's nothing new when it comes to this game *cough* pig *cough*
---
The only time I'm not rank 1 is rank reset so, figures
---
Yeah I’d imagine it’s pretty damn hard to see with that on. Joey’s probably got it the best with visibility. Still though, this is really cool!
---
I've never been a big fan of the scream franchise but this looks amazing, they definitely did a great job and I can't wait to get him! the mori looks very nice too. Thank you so much for this!

---
Bruh your art style you worship is overused and bad
---
how i thought the max was 1M
---
What? How did you take that from what I said? You actually have a chance at a 4k if you play normally. You'll just get 1 or maybe 2 kills by face camping everyone you hook.

Yeah he is but apparently a tv show is in talks with the creeper.
---
Fucking around with the killers can get you FUCKED.

---
It's one of them
---
Nothing in that link indicates it's created for LF
---
I was actually watching tydetime when I clicked this thread.
---
Oooh that's badass. I wish her Mori animation finished with that.
---
I personally haven't tried it, but some people have said they liked running Doctor with BBQ, Ruin, Distressing, and an optional 4th perk that works well on Doc e.g. Unnerving Presence.
---
The idea is to extend the game a little, locate survivors, and milk devious points off of them.
---
For the game in general: No D/C unless there is really bad lag/glitching making the game unplayable. Only happened twice. 
---
As Survivor:
---
-No Unhooking unless the Killer is away or distracted; I hate when people are getting chased by the Killer and then that same person decides to come save me, I always get hit and rehooked and die earlier on. Would rather have a safer escape, and I'm sure others would too.
---
-Not a rule, but something I stick to, if I have been hooked twice already, I make it someone else's job to rescue hooked survivors while I run Gens. I think it's a good strat to utilize everyone's chances instead of ultimately dying and jeopardizing the match for others. I also try to pay attention to who has been hooked twice so I can take the rescuer position if I haven't been hooked. Actually makes everyone last longer in a match too.
---
- No Teabagging Killers, unless attempting to communicate, like if they want to give me the chance to unhook someone before the match ends or similar.
---
- Same as above, no teabagging unless trying to communicate to other survivors. Like with Saying thanks for healing or to express we are glad to have crossed paths.
---
- No escaping unless all others have and there are no hooked survivors, unless blocked by the Killer. I always go back for my teammates, and I wait by the gate to see if they get out or caught. If one gets hooked, I will try my best to save them, even if I get caught in the process. Only time I don't do this is if I'm near the exit and the Killer is blocking my way out.
---
-Don't use Health Kits on other survivors (Unless I have been hooked twice already). I usually try to save them as long as I can, and it's not that I don't want to help, I've just have better experiences and more successes when saving it until the end, healing myself, and then rescuing a hooked survivor and escaping using myself as a shield from one hits. Its basically, I can use this to heal you 2 seconds faster, or I can save this, heal myself, save you, and ensure your escape.
---
- If you miss a skill check more than 3 times, just fucking leave. I mean this to myself.
---
-Walk, don't Run. Unless, obviously, there's the killer.
---
-If injured, hide in those red Closets. They won't hear your cries of pain, and most never look for blood trails.
---
-If not injured, try to blend in with surroundings or hide behind objects instead of hiding in the red closet thing. You have a better chance to escape than if you're found.
---
-Don't do the Gen next to the Exit gate until the end. And if possible, do it with another survivor. One should run to the Gate to unlock it as the other will finishes up the last second of the Gen.
---
-Don't trust Megs or Neas. Work on Gens with Jake's. Stay close to Davids and ALWAYS have their back. Quentin is a death sentence, but use him as bait instead of being bait yourself. If you find one on a Gen, swap places with Claudette. If you see another Dwight, Stay Away, especially if it's not a Bloody Dwight. Anyone else, be Wary.
---
Call me a dick for anything above if you want. Least it gets me to the upper Ranks.
---
As Killer (I'm much Nicer):
---
- If you found the hatch and down the last survivor, bring them to it, even if you have to chase and down them again.
---
- No camping hooks. Patrolling is not camping when you round the hook again. Don't listen to what the butthurt fuckwads say, no matter what.
---
- If one survivor is trying to loop you at any given chance, ignore them for the whole game until the end, and then once hooked, camp their ass and let the others escape.
---
- If a survivor loops you twice, move on. But make sure to turn around when you leave, they might be trying to follow you, and you get an easy hit.
---
-Walk sideways. Faster, better angle to hit at, easier to get those who try to turn around at the last second, and red eyes are less visible sometimes.
---
- If a survivor teabags at you, I have a fun saying: Remember their face. Remember their name. Make their life a disgrace for the rest of the game.
---
- If the survivors make it to the gate, have fun with them. Don't down them. Let them heal each other for extra points.
---
- If one survivor unhooks another while you chase them, continue to chase that person, unless the hooked person was hooked for a good goddamn reason.
---
- If you body block someone accidentally, just let them through, wait a second and continue the chase. I think it's unfair, so I just try to fix the fairness.
---
Mayne i was just seeing things yesterday
---
I am serious you ape
---
Because god forbid 4 survivors join at similar times. Not like coincidence or how matchmaking is supposed to be
---
Because I'm not gonna argue with stupid people that want to argue.
---
Spare only if I know where hatch is and only if they weren’t BMing or using Urban Evasion the whole game
---
'So... you're making me use .002% of my power.'
---
*NOED activates*
---
Well I'm not saying they shouldn't rework him, I just want to make it know that some people like how he is now. I am excited to know how they will change him, but I'm also really worried. I just hope they preserve his current gameplay.
---
First of all, I've been looking forward to this to be honest.
---
Second of all:  Any chance we could get an optional part of builds where we choose Items/Add-Ons?  Sometimes having those can be really important to a build.  A box to describe playstyle would be nice as well.
---
Hopefully if they end up making more Mori animations for killers
---
Hopefully one of the survivors they talk about in the lore we don't play as.
---
Or just keep looking for the survivor to end the game already. Seriously you guys want to play the game in the most boring way for everyone when you can just end it. But nah lets just camp, killers and survivors alike.
---
Not for compensation
---
Hello! Thank you for your message!
---
Yes, I will be adding that in the future. You can find what I have to say to that in the original post, under the "what's coming next". Also I'm going to add offerings/maps if the build is map reliant
---
Myers has a small terror radius without Monitor and Abuse, a survivor will hear the heartbeat before you can pull em off. Its about 8 meter terror radius without Monitor.
---
free advertising
---
Yea it's happened to me before but it also happens without bamboozle sometimes. Survivors will block a window but still vault through it.
---
He has something like 8m terror radius in T1, so you need monitor and abuse to negate it
---
He has a much reduced TR. monitor shrinks it down to next to nothing
---
Ghost face can hide his terror radius to insta down, pig can hide her terror radius to smack a gen
---
I feel you bro.

---
Good points. Makes sense to use him if you already want to camp I guess...But don’t you get more points if you let them go and catch them again? Just a strange strategy to me.
---
Only saw the first 2, but thats semantics,  the point is Legion is basically ghost face. I thought they had licensing issues thats why legion came out.

Ah I see. Thanks!

Yes. The message is killers are OP. lol

Yup, once freddy gets ruined I'll have a new main.

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZUUUUP

I hope clown gets a cool hallowed skin this halloween, it could be sonething like this

If you even DARE to trash talk anything about Pig or her cosmetics you can fuck out off my live.

The issue is international rights. Jason is owned by the screenwriter in na now, while the film dudes got it internationally.

Ok

Rarely do 4 man SWF not tbag, not flashlight click, not BM, not DC when one of them gets caught right away. I honestly can't remember when I've gone against a 4 man SWF who weren't being dicks. I'm all for playing with your friends and having fun, just don't he a dick IF you win.
---
WITH NEW BEW HATCH CLOSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEB DC'ING MORE OFTEN. AS A KILLER I REALLY DISLIKE HOW THE TYPICAL IMMERSRD CLAUDETTE PLAYERS REMAIN THE SAME, WORST PART IS SINCR THEY ARE CROUCH WALKING THROUGH THE MAP I FIND THE HATCH FIRST AND MANAGE TO GET THEM.
---
HELP YOUR TEAMMATES, I'M NOT EVEN LOOKING FOR KILLS, JUST LONGER GAMES. PLEASE
---
We’re in the big leagues now boys
---
GOTY incoming
---
We got good skins for Pig, you just didn't get what you wanted.
---
I always check profiles. until I confirm 100% that they're a full swf group. I grab a mori and some spicy add-ons
---
The nerfed the pig in 2 ways during the PTB. 
---
1 - They made it so that it that survivors can leave through exit gates if the RBT was not active when it was put on the survivor. If you put an RBT on a survivors head during the end-game when all gens are done, the survivor can still leave the trial and was not trapped in the game until the RBT was removed. 
---
2 - They made it so the RBT timer did not go down while in the pig's terror radius. This would effectively make head-pops never happen and make the traps less lethal. The exchange was that if someone with an active RBT when into your terror radius, the timer stopped which you could notice and take advantage of. 
---
With the Live release of the new patch, they removed the whole RBT stopped in the pigs terror radius but kept the first nerf.
---
Anyone else getting free pips outta nowhere? I was playing last night but then depipped to 0 pips rank 8, but got on today and now it says im 3 pips rank 7...what?
---
Thank you all for creating such an amazingly fun game and for all the effort you put into it!
---
I NEED AN OPTION TO KICK TEAMMATES IN THE FACE INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM TAKE ME OFF A HOOK RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE FUCKING KILLER. JESUS H. CHRIST IDIOTS YOU MAY AS WELL KILL ME YOURSELVES!
---
I dont really BM per say. But I sometimes camp a hook, or tunnel. 
---
They are stargiees and complaining about them is just dumb. But I do try to be fair when i camp, and i usally only do it if i KNOW there are others near them or see them.
---
The second one did.
---
Well I mean the way you phrased the question made it sound like it's a valid strategy from the beginning. I don't care about it if the gates are open that's the only time it really makes sense. But if anything it'd still be better to proxy camp instead to bait an unhook and hopefully get someone else.
---
I only use NOED because I have no real perks since im a low level.
---
Youve said that. So dont buy it if you dont like it
---
Look on the bright side. Pig cosmetics being leaked with the potential that it could be purchased with shards.
---
4SWF =/ 4 toxic SWF is all I'm saying.
---
And Billy is basically Leatherface, he was created because they couldn’t get the rights to Leatherface yet. Ghostface and Legion really don’t have much in common aside from the most basic aspects.
---
If you don’t play it, it shows that you don’t have the idea of what it’s meant to actually be like
---
FUCK THE LEAK GOT ME HYPED UP NOW IM SAD
---
Yes, a winner that is supposed to end it.
---
But here instead of closing the hatch and forcing the game to end faster, the killer camps it.
---
Thank Youu~~
---
honestly the killers since this patch, immediately rush the hatches more than prioritizing exit gates being opened. At least from I'm seeing around rank 5-7
---
AS A KILLER I CAN AGREE WITH YOU. I RATHER HOOK SO THEY FIND A GAME FASTER. YET I ADMIT I DID THIS ONCE BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO SEE THE EGC EXECUTION. PLEASE FORGIVE ME
---
No I understand you, sorry for poor phrasing. I main Wraith and I run bbq so I really see no point to hook camping. But if it’s my only way to get a kill I’m gonna do it oof.
---
I understand that's what the power says, but we haven't seen it in action. Best to just wait before freaking out. We don't know how much could change anyway.
---
Finally my Piggy is going to be complete.
---
Anyone noticed that Dwight sandbagged the fuck outta this Jane?
---
Opinions on looks aside, it does show that the devs can now release cosmetics for licensed killers. This is great as we can now see 2018 Myers or potentially a detective Hoffman skin for the pig in the near future if people are buying the licensed skins.
---
It will happen since its new. Give it time.
---
SURVIVING TILL EGC DOESNT MEAN I WILL GIVE UP ON TRYING TO WIN ENTITLED TWATS
---
Its kind of on purpose. So its easier for the survivors
---
Haha
---
As long as you use range extending add-ons, its very easy to shock survivors. You get deviousness points for each shock and each madness tier increase. 
---
Another great thing is that the doctor is entirely anti-stealth. No one in plain sight? Switch to treatment mode and now all survivors in your terror radius will gain madness and eventually scream to reveal their location. 
---
Now of course the doctor is just a plain M1 Killer, so you’re really just playing him to get into chases non-stop.
---
oh look, i got downvoted for no reason
---
You should try to make one of these for each killer. I believe you'd do a great job
---
Its only during ECG
---
I almost always get the rescue unless the killer is facecamping but alit of the time we just trade positions and I end up on hook and they get away. It's the fun of it though!
---
What 'strategy' is that?
---
You're not getting hits, hooks or kills. So your bloodpoint gains are trash.
---
And in the time you wasted waiting for all 4 to d/c, you could have had 3 other matches and gotten multiple hooks, kills and BP.
---
Unless your 'strategy' is to use the LEAST efficient and useful method possible, you're a moron if you are doing it for any reason beyond just trolling like a loser.
---
I'm at work, so I can't play for another 4 hours or so
---
I really like the leather jacket one tho
---
Maybe cause it's 2pm(EST) on a Monday and the majority(99%) of the player base is old enough to have a job and is probably contributing to society instead of just playing dbd all day, wish we could tho, so I'd wait till later when people are off
---
pretty much, looks like an upgraded Michael combined with wraith
---
Mark as spoiler :|
---
It might be timing. To balance the skill levels, the have certain people allowed to be paired with other certain people. I know when I play week days I get long waits as opposed to weekends. It's probably player availability. Whatever rank you are might not have a lot of players in weekdays because not school/work they might have
---
In the build creator section you should add addons for certain builds.
---
I thought they removed that hatch interrupt mechanic due to this kind of situation though
---
I love you for never disappointing me whenever someone makea a pig post
---
thats fuckin nice
---
Marks post as "spoiler" puts Ghostface right in the title. Looks like we are using our big brains here.
---
Then killers would lobby dodge and it’d be really hard to actually get into a match.
---
It's middle of the week and middle of the day in the most populated playerbase (North America) so most people are at school/work.
---
There was just a 2x BP event (which really should have been this weekend) so some people are burned out.
---
And even though the update is small it still is an annoyance to download and install so people are probably waiting.
---
It'll be busier at night and this weekend.
---
Maybe! I might have missed that bit in the notes.
---
Absolutely true, but to be fair, that is not different from dealing with Blood Warden before EGC, which is what I interpreted the question as wondering. You definitely had a good setup for dealing with the survivors even if Jane wasn't on death hook, and I hope my comment didn't take away from that.
---
Someone redownloaded the dev version using the steam database and was able to look into the files. There wasn't anything on Freddy or what most cosmetics look like
---
Oh, oh god
---
I wish they also would've done the same for the hatch. Don't make it so the killer can stand on an open hatch and the survivor can't get in until they feel they want to end the game. I've had too many killers decide to take the game hostage by just standing on hatch instead of just closing it. Like, game is over, you won. Please, close the hatch so we can go.
---
Except most of the time people still manage to escape if you trap them at the end game before the update.  Or they died to hooking and not the trap. 
---
There was multiple ways they could have nerfed it while still keeping the mechanic. Like having the count down slow down if there is a trapped survivor or have the survivor search boxes faster during the EGC.
---
Also due to its current state, it's glitchy as hell. I had a survivor with an active trap yesterday that I was chasing actually managed to leave. And yes I had the trap on them before the last gen was done. I did report the bug.
---
It could be either of the Scream 4 killers, who are a guy and a girl.
---
Uh... Not really. The original white mask is infinitely more iconic and recognisable as Ghostface. Not to mention the fact that OP obviously isn't aware that the red mask is one of the Store cosmetics for The Ghost. This whole post is redundant.
---
No, it does not impact the survivors. If the survivor leaves the area of impact, the gas still lasts for around 2 seconds at base.
---
If you chuck more than one bottle in the same area, it just recreates another gas cloud at the area of impact.
---
Who said that?!
---
And so booooooring to use. Never understand those who start self caring and refuse to receive help from someone nearby
---
(door opens)
---
Hillbilly: revs chainsaw
---
Claudette: OkBye
---
Dang this game is gonna get stale fast
---
When people can count on their team to help them out. So never.
---
Falling off is instant death for both killer and survivor.
---
Surprised you've never played against the worse swf in the world then!
---
Y tho
---
I don't mind all the hiding spots and size, I think it's healthy to have maps that are more survivor sided and maps that are more killer sided. 
---
They definitely need to fix the aura thing though. Hands down. Make the map darker, change the aura intensity for that map, something. Any and all aura perks, no matter killer or survivor, are completely useless on that map.
---
"lovely weather we're having"
---
Oh yeah mr krabs
---
Talking about movement speed, I'm really curious about the normal movement speed of Ghostface. I imagine his crouch speed will be akin to the pig. 
---
They seem to be really committing to his stealth factor but will that mean he will have reduced movement speed? 
---
He has the ability to crouch &amp; stalk survivors to gain individual exposed effects on them, a combination of Myers &amp; Pig but will they allow him to have 115% movement speed or perhaps they might make him a 110% movement speed character.
---
Then there is the issue of whether he is going to be immune to detection perks. Spine chill or premonition will absolutely kill him if he is entirely based on stealth.
---
There should be an increased jump range and have the killer unable to grab if they're not a certain distance from the hatch or something. Way to easy to cheese like what's in the gif. The killer should have to make a choice.
---
Does he stab you with his ass and his power is he puts bee nests everywhere and they follow survivors making them scream
---
Damnnnn, now I'm even happier that I main spirit!
---
And then the survivor can pick it up
---
It was lol.
---
Instead, they just gave it to the killer, though.
---
Someone already posted this, that’s why it’s being downvoted
---
People on reddit act like a hive mind
---
Most of these are pretty cringy if they were actually in game and just a rip from samination videos
---
dunno, i saw some but there were never this practical outfit on it
---
Itl only be like this for a few weeks. People wanna see the animation
---
I actually LOVE this costume design. I really hop he turns out to be a good killer
---
If I had to the chance to choose something, I would pick a graveyard map, something similar to the Old Jewish Graveyards in Germany (the same ones that inspired the graveyard level design in Dark Souls 1). Maybe with a central church or Mausoleum.
---
All you really have to do is hit a Walmart or Lowes after close. Go to the back, they have them piled up and rarely care when they are taken.
---
wait, really? i saw the clip and i just wanted to do a funny meme with it to make other people laugh, this is my first time doing this stuff, anyways.
---
I WAS RUNNING KILLER AROUND FOR A GOOD MINUTE LAST NIGHT, WANDERING WHY GENS AREN'T POPPING. FOUND TWO CLAUDETTES IN A MIDDLE OF NOWHERE PLAYING WITH FLASHLIGHTS. POINTED KILLER AT THEIR DIRECTION, HE NODDED AT DOWNED THEM BOTH IN SECONDS. WE BOTH LAUGHED, WHEN HE KILLED ME. GG.
---
Tbh, thats just a dumb comeback, he cried about NOED in a post without NOED. How much saltier can one get over a perk.
---
even if someone posted this, it wasn't like mine, might have been just the normal clip without edit, i guess
---
I love this meme format
---
Sounds pretty cool, if I could choose one it would maybe be a power plant or an abandoned mine. (I know, it's ridiculous)
---
Rip OP. Fucking died
---
Now that I think about it, this potentially just shifted the hatch standoff, but there still could be one. For instance, if you see the hatch and the killer is waiting on top of it for a gen to pop, you can just wait indefinitely by a very far gate and potentially wait until they're impatient enough to just give you the hatch (which is how the old hatch was). The collapse won't start until the hatch is closed, so you could extend the game indefinitely.
---
This will probably be the meta for the last survivor unless killer has whispers.
---
Rip my ass good ridance
---
MERCY IS NOT AN OPTION
---
It looks like they cut off the head and hold it up next to them for the selfie
---
Damn dude you're the first guy I've met to do something out of pure kindness, I hope you have fun with continuing the website and good luck with it. I'm gonna start using this as my go-to website for anything related to dbd
---
I know it's not a huge deal or anything, but it's annoying that I have to wait for such a long time before I can move on to the next game if the killer chooses to slug me. It makes no sense that the timer should slow down when you get slugged as the last person alive. It's not like you are going to survive anyways so why does the timer not just speed up at that point instead?
---
oh yea, true, but atleast could give some criticism with a downvote? would help alot.
---
Usually spare.
---
Perfection
---
I wish I had your willpower.
---
I wasn't arguing with the person who posted it......
---
Care to go more in detail I'm curious as to why :)
---
GhostFACE. LeatherFACE. Coincidence, I think NOT
---
Honestly not really. If you get caught during endgame before any exit gates are opened you're dead regardless of whether it's one or two hits.
---
I mean, not really. Closing hatch opens the gates so if anything you’re giving them a better chance of survival.
---
Last match I had my slug immediatley DC so last guy could get hatch, and it was ltierally a wall of "GET FUCKED EZ EZ EZ TRASH KILLER". 
---
Hatch was ALWAYS survivor sided tbh. Survivor finds it first, he jumps. Killer finds it first, hatch standoff occurs, etc.
---
it doesn't affect a killer in the least if you do all the generators. why would they leave the hatch because you're doing generators? all it does is power up the gates, which is what the killer was going to do anyway when he closes the hatch...
---
I think Noed should have a condition for it to activate now,like giving the speed boost if the hatch is closed but not the exposed effect,and gaining both if it activates how it should,all gens being done.
---
I guess that makes sense. Not sure if I like endgame yet.
---
When the Trapper started spinning I fucking lost it
---
So ? They can release a another killer before The Ghost. Developers said they work in advance and finish chapters with months before they appear.
---
Thank you
---
I now feel pressure to always ready up fast
---
Exactly. People seem to think somehow that this is a rant about how I get looped. It's not. It's like they're looking for a fight. 
---
I posted an interesting pig bug a while back and the first comment was "hatch camping is dumb" because I happened to be testing it out in front of the hatch. They decided from a 20 second clip that I obviously was camping the hatch. No asking, nothing. Just straight to judgement. 
---
I'm guessing I have another 20 hours in me for this game, max. And then I'll finally be done with it.
---
Face camping and camping aren't the same thing.
---
Good riddance to bad trash.
---
She wouldn’t be a Pig then now would she
---
That’s rough should have been more I grounded out just about 3 million BPs over the event
---
LEGION IS STILL MISRABLE TO PLAY AGAINST
---
I dont think calling a gameplay style is really 'toxic'
---
seriously though, an old airfield could be fun. fix a certain generator, and one broken down plane's engine starts up. killer is a crazed former mechanic or something.
---
To be fair one reason I think people like new survivors is if they are part of a franchise it is nice to see them come with a killer. Like imagine Michael without Laurie. Of course if we got a survivor from a killer series people would be disappointed because new killers are a major thing but survivors also add perks which have the potential to let survivors do new things better.
---
The only real reason I would see people being upset is if they were big fans of the series or if they really just wanted 3 new perks to try out. Since perks are the only thing that influence survivor gameplay unlike killers where killers can change everything.
---
We saw his stats, he has base movespeed and terror radius.
---
Oh, God forbid the survivors face any hardships in their attempt to escape!
---
Maybe wait to see what he actually does....
---
Oh ok! Thanks for the info.
---
Awesome! I appreciate the help.
---
Survivors really like to act like they're entitled the right to survive every match.
---
I'm impressed that you managed to string them along in a somewhat readable form. 
---
Yet grammar and logic are not something you can discuss. They are fact based, and it is also a fact that you failed at both.
---
I can’t wait to see the mori from the survivor perspective
---
You wouldn't know lol
---
the killer shouldn't get an easy 4k either, and yet they are given it. meanwhile the survivor's ability to survive the trial is pretty much removed. how is it fair the game is forced to end early for the last survivor and a free 4k is given to killer while the last survivor isn't even allowed to attempt to finish the game and escape?
---
The only skin I want is swimsuit Jane.
---
F U KILLERS WHO CAMPED ME WHEN I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO BROUGHT BLOODY PARTY STREAMERS DURING BLOODHUNT.
---
you consider scratch marks auras? and how am i supposed to know that? literally no one else does.
---
to Hag, i don't know which ranks you play on but i'm really good at smart trapping and had consistent kills with her even before the rework(when trapping took longer than Trapper and she was really overall low tier killer) on high ranks. and now and before the best map for her was Lery's. i don't understand how can you call it decent if whole map is a choke point. this once on rank one i forgot i created a lobby, went to get some chocolate milk, talked to my husband and came back to a t-bagging flashlighting Bill, gone Ruin and 3 gens fixed. but it was Lery's so whole game turned into Merciless. never have i ever had a bad Hag game on Lery's(mind you i never use noed since Clown update). and i'm asking about rank cause if you play Hag on high ranks and especially don't use noed you will be crashed on any big map unless you got potato survivors.
---
Needs to have long hallway of doors that portal you at random so we can recreate every bad Scooby Doo montage chase ever
---
Surprise, there’s two of them. That’s how he manages to be on two places at once.
---
As a killer main, no. We just get pissed when y'all are so damn fast on them. Why do you think we all run ruin?
---
Is this coming to consoles?
---
Cant wait for ghostface to be my new main killer. Scream is my all time favorite horror movie franchise.
---
Every *good* Scooby Doo montage chase ever
---
And a there for the nusee and clown, you could even go as far as doing a phantom of the Opera type Opera type deal
---
Would you fill in the uninitiated?
---
His power was already leaked but okay
---
I main survivor and I actually get a sick kick out of matches with ruin because they force you to go hex hunting.
---
Some survivors are just ridiculous and expect you to full on ignore them. Just ignore them, if you try your best not to tunnel thats all you can do
---
I wanna see another MacMillian Estate map where it's half underground with sprawling mineshafts, kinda like The Game but half the map is much more open.
---
I mean end game fixes that except now it is the killers court to be the jerk. All i know is when I play killer now if hatch opens Ill just close it and start end game not wait for the survivor to do this.
---
If i want to patrol exits for 2 minutes after hatch closes for the win that is not as bad as sitting at a hatch standoff for 30 minutes like some people willingly do.
---
Oh for sure
---
I think the three original maps (Coldwind, MacMillan, Autohaven) originally had 3 variations and then later on they added the other 2, all before Leatherface came out
---
Nope
---
\&gt;  I mean end game fixes that except now it is the killers court to be the jerk.   
---
As opposed to when both survivor and killer could be jerks at the same time.
---
YES THEY DEFINITELY DO WHEN THEY FUCKING FACE CAMP ME AND THE IMMERSED SURVIVORS WATCH IN STEAD OF DYING A GENERATOR!
---
They're talking about literally taking them hostage, not body blocking to down them
---
Holy shit I legit had no idea there was a Saw video game... I have to look this up.

I've been to rank two, never had much trouble, but try to keep my rank around 10-13 because I don't always enjoy the competitive aspect and don't want to consistently stress and be "try hard" over rank. I enjoy leisure play, not sweaty play. The maps I enjoy as killer are maps I consistently have very good plays on. 
---
And I didn't expect you to just know that, but you shouldn't insult people who do enjoy aura builds. It takes a different type of skill to rely on an aura that lasts for a few seconds and find someone based off that info alone. I enjoy a lot of types of builds for both killer and survivor, and some of those builds do include auras. Sometimes as killer I use aura because it's a different type of challenge with hunting and finding survivors, it's just a different playstyle. It doesn't mean you have less skill or are worse than others necessarily.
---
Not every perk needs to be super viable and it would be a good niche option for a 4th perk if you run 3 meta perks. I think people will agree they don't want perks that incentivize not helping other players though.
---
If I am one of the last 2 survivors I always try to save because that i just how I do it. More fun for me to try to be a savior than escape but that is purely an opinion since I don't mind dying.
---
Ah the classic 'no u' defense again. 
---
Let me try that: i know, do you?
---
There's totally one! Check out r/DeadbyDaylight
---
That was the PTB my dude, it had nothing to do with perks.
---
I'm not gonna argue with stupid people dude. Lol
---
Tunneling is when the killer seeks out one survivor and goes after them all game even if costs them the match.
---
What isn't tunneling is the killer going after an injured survivor after they get unhooked within the killers radius. This is the killer capitalizing on a mistake made by the survivors.
---
Gotta disagree.
---
Yeet, ok.
---
It would be dumb lets be honest. A trap shouldnt mean death. I still think they went overboard with pig but i get why they did it. Game mechanics need counterplay
---
I assumed it was the next one
---
Have you sampled the platter?
---
I’M PANICKING BECAUSE I SWEAR THIS IS TV SHOW GHOSTFACE AND WE’RE NOT GETTING SIDNEY PRESCOTT.

MY DBD LIFE IS OVER IF WE DONT GET SIDNEY.

Thanks man. So you use his power mainly in the early stages of the game? And maybe a bit later if there happens to be alot of healthy survivors near who I'm chasing? Makes sense. That's kind of the biggest question mark I have with him. When to use and when not to use feral frenzy now that it can't be used to down survivors.
---
Never catching another Diglett in my life
---
yOINKing people is the best part of playing pig.
---
Ah right thanks for sharing. That's reassuring then &amp; provides him the potential to actually make use of the exposed status.
---
Thats why i like the “game” map. As you progress, doors keep opening making the killer able to acess areas much faster. Like the more you progress the harder it gets. Though the seem to revert to their basic map layout with the winter map.
---
this is abuse im calling the cops
---
His power and 1 of his perks are already out
---
“Let me start by saying I don’t play DbD”
---
Let me start by saying you have no valid input
---
I got like 7/10 bad ping lobbies but I only play when I got 160ms or below.
---
WAIT I THOUGHT THEY PATCHED COLISION ON BASEMENT STAIRS AND KILLERS COULD NOT BODYBLOCK THERE ANYMORE. DID I MISS SOMETHING?
---
Bait level 1000 :D
---
note: I don't usually bring the mori and the spicy add-ons against 500-hrs players.   
---
if every member of the swf group was more than 500 hrs in DBD. I'll probably take the mori and the spicy add-ons. and if they didn't Teabag. didn't act that much toxic. I won't probably use the mori from the first hook. cuz I'm a survivor main and i know how much it sucks to face these things :D
---
WTF you are saying, these new cosmetics are the best of them all.
---
That’s the point of it anyways..?
---
We dont know his Crouch speed and anything else though
---
Then what are you doing in your crazy view of reality here?
---
And do what with it, tickle the killer or pick their teeth clean?
---
loool
---
Being honest, it looks like his mori is too long, In my opinon. I also think it doesnt fit the atmosphere of the game. Yeah, we have cute piggie, shirtless myers etc, making the community a little lighter. However, this is still a game about a ruthless godlike entity capturing well known or brutal killers along with hopeful survivors and pitting one another, personally a "selfie" doesn't fit the mood. :/
---
&gt;-rep unskilled degenerate that tunnels and camps because is the worst killer I ever seen. l2p moron
---
I always wondered, do they think someone will care if they write this kind of stuff on persons profile?
---
Ooooh, a fellow mid ranker! :')
---
you've been at rank 2 once, well, i mean... some games on red ranks are easy but sometimes you get MLG fukin teams and this is where you see the true balance of the game. or shall i say imbalance? i got literally told that as killer by these MLG parties several times. and, please, green ranks? on green ranks i play sometimes on my husband's account to relax with no perks and add-ons lol. there's no point to talk about map balance when you 90% of time face potatoes. every game i get on green-early purple ranks is fukin easy. 
---
hahaha, okay. so, i started as Freddy main and literally refused to use any aura reading perks cause... Freddy :D now i solely use BBQ for points and rarely to find this one immersed piece of shit Claudette by the wall far fukin far away from the hooked person. but thing is, overall the aura reading perks are created for those who can't track and don't know how survivors behave. with enough experience you just *know* where survivors are. bit harder on new maps but you'll get used to them too. it's not a challenge to find someone after pinpointing their location, what are you saying? depending on rank survivors mostly function according to their ranks. goes from looping points to gen fixing strategy. when you learn that you no longer need aura reading perks.
---
Laughing at you because you think you're getting anywhere
---
IM MORE MAD AT MYSELF ABOUT HOW FEW GEN GRABS IVE BEEN GETTING WITH SPIRIT LATELY!!!! I DONT PLAY AGAINST SPIRIT OFTEN SO IM NOT SURE HOW LOUD PHASING IS SO MAYBE IM NOT RUNNING THE RIGHT ADDONS?
---
In a successful pig game the traps will somewhat counter the “gen rush meta”, that’s the point of the RBT.
---
Your argument is kinda backing up what the devs said on stream about why they are doing the nerf and how pig would be frustrating to play against in EGC. They also said they don’t want people saving the traps for EGC, which isn’t your point but it does explain the nerf more.
---
You keep saying it’s “clutch potential” but getting one free kill isn’t a clutch, it’s a crutch. Getting a bear trap on you end game and having the pig tunnel the living shit out of you is worse than noed, but there are little to no complains about it because of the very low pig pick rate.
---
In theory let’s say pigs pick rate rose with EGC which if Reddit’s a good indicator, it very much was going to without the nerf.
---
In the EGC survivors with traps would be completely FUCKED, 2 minutes (or less) is such minimal time to get a trap off and get out of the gates. The only counter to a pig tunneling in endgame before the update was to  get unhooked and try to hide or hope teammate takes her attention, and bide your time choosing which box is safe to search. It was unlikely you would survive a tunneling pig but it was possible, but with the new EGC the RBT would be a guaranteed death. The only way would be to get the box on the first attempt assuming you were not on the hook for have the EGC timer, yes it slows when someone is hooked or down but it’s not by much. 
---
Pigs would take noed, bitter murmur, bloodwarden, and maybe something like infectious fright to help get more than 1 RBT active.  It would be absolutely broken considering pig could open the door herself to start the 2 minutes. It would take zero skill to just find a dull totem to guard and wait for the gens to get done, then find them with bitter murmur, one hit them, find another with infectious fright, maybe another, put on RBTs and hook them, then open the door and patrol the jigsaw boxes. 
---
This would be the most scumbag tactic that the community would probably call worse than old legion. They complained that legion had no counter play, and neither would this pig strat.
---
The nerf had to happen, and the devs said they are still looking at pig and might nerf something to buff something else, but didn’t say anything specific.
---
I want dnd class skins for all killers and survivors.  Mostly for warlock Jeff.
---
not too much anymore. Haven't played much in the past couple months except for the latest ptb for the dedicated servers. So with rank resets I'm back to 15 :' ) But 8 or so was my highest rank
---
Tunneling is when a killer is within 150 meters of a survivor.
---
it ended right before he escaped so he died
---
it ended right after you escaped so you got out
---
is this so hard?
---
Using the lunge animation to break the lanterns wasn't the problem, that could have easily worked. For me it was the fact that it didn't make you actually hit the lantern.
---
Best is when the game just starts and you yOINK somebody off the gen before they even get a skill check
---
Seems like a fair idea. It might be a tad confusing, but I imagine the 30 seconds comes from the time it takes to progress from stage one to stage two of being hooked. 
---
Here's an idea that could go along with that: you know the bar that starts depleting beneath your icon when you're hooked? It could display ABOVE the survivor's icon, and STAY there after they get unhooked. every player in the match could see the bar regress, as with your idea, all the way to the halfway point, where it would continue regressing when they get hooked again.
---
That way, if a survivor tries farming you IMMEDIATELY after getting hooked and you get downed and hooked again, you're still in phase 1 of the sacrifice process, even after being on the hook a second time!
---
Also it would help the killer know which survivors are dead on hook, which would be pretty neat for killers like piggy
---
Gen rushing ruins my experience and isn’t fun to play against. 
---
See how easy it is for entitled survivor arguments to be flipped on themselves?
---
Op, you are hook someone, and run to the opposite side of the map you are still considered a camper. If you even think about going for someone, you are considered a tunneller. 
---
Good luck
---
😒 I stayed in red rank for the better part of a year (8 months or so) but choose to relax more at green ranks currently. You have nothing of value to say if you're just going to take my rank, which is essentially useless as is, and try to weaponize it as some weak form of insult. Never mind my hours of gameplay, game experiences, what ever. If you're gonna be an ass and avoid a conversation we can just end it here. I'm not wasting my time on someone who values a number- which I purposely effect due to preference, not skill- over actual experience in games which have formed an opinion you may or may not agree with. Have a good day, dude. Work on being less shallow.
---
Ugh I love Puppers so much
---
Probably not until dedicated servers
---
Trapper is *pleased*
---
why are you capslocking at me about it when there's literally a link lower in the thread
---
same i disagree with this meme
---
no such problems on PC
---
I assumed Legion was put into the game to fill the masked stabby stabby teenager trope, but he we are with Ghostface anyway.
---
It used to be, before Brand New Parts got fixed. Now it's just too quick to do gens anyways. Ruin shouldn't be a necessity
---
bill or puppers?
---
You got nice toes
---
Especially with perks like prove thyself and distressing maxing out the category in the first 2-3 minutes of a match.
---
Wow
---
You assume these sorts of people have a day to day life outside of this game?  That assumption is bold.
---
 I'm still new to polymer clay and have been experimenting with different techniques, painting, and sizes of the figures. They're not perfect but they're fun to make!  Thanks to [u/IamPenguin2](https://www.reddit.com/user/IamPenguin2) for inspiring me to finally post these after they posted the Doctor!
---
That episode had the best manga style reactions and I love it, they should do it more often tbh
---
Gen rushing isn't a thing. That's your fault for not putting pressure on survivors. Also are you unaware at how entitled your argument sounds? Lol like the survivors should just not do gens at let themselves die?
---
Wanting more variety means a stale game????? 
---
Is it crack? Is that what you smoke? Do you smoke crack?
---
How the hell else do they get the money to buy two dbd copies? I mean it’s not the most expensive game but you gotta have a decent income to be blowing it on duplicate games right
---
If you didn't give insults when I've given you no reason to insult me maybe id find what you have to say worth hearing. It's what ever, this is a literal opinion over which maps work, which is very killer and player dependant as it is due to varying powers and play styles. It's not that deep, definitely not as deep as you're trying to make it by attempting to make my opinions seem less valuable due to a number. If it's not a valuable opinion I won't continue to explain my thoughts and reasons. That shouldn't be an issue.
---
who says they will make a 2v8?
---
As a famous legionnaire once said "Degenerates like you belong on a cross"
---
Miss and frenzy is over, worst possible change for Legion. The consistent chases and stabby stab is what made them fun to play. Could use him with no addons and no offering, this update will be detrimental.
---
You’re not rude at all, I agree I just don’t like posting people’s names cause of the blowback. Their profile is just sort of unique enough (especially with the bio) that I thought people might recognize it. I reported them for refusing to participate in normal game play (wouldn’t have but they messaged me after) but idk if BHVR really does anything with that on console.
---
You gotta love how survivors may do as they please, but expect killers to adhere to some moral code they came up with that's made to help out the survivors
---
I use those all the time. It's good stuff lol
---
I should tag nsfw
---
I understand! I’ll be on the lookout. I’m sure I’ll have issues with them lol.
---
She’ll be the P3 Nea doing nothing the whole game. 😂
---
Damn, now that’s a face I could sit on.
---
I will have to completely disagree with you on this. This mori looks just like something Ghostface would do. Most (if not all?) of the people who played Ghostface in the films were teen or young adults, so I think this mori animation really fits with the killer's lore.
---

No they were wrong. Active traps still trigger, inactive ones don't.
---
YEET of the year
---
Oh so that’s what they reversed? Cool :)
---
Sounds like a lot of survivors I get paired with 😂😂
---
Legion, I like trying to outsmart nurses and when you do it is satisfying. Legion had barely any counters except just repairing.
---
You don’t have to be an ass about it.

WHY SO MANY FUCKING TRYHARDS DURING THE BLOODHUNT? I KNOW IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS BUT I'M STILL CONFUSED AND SALTY. USUALLY WHEN BLOODHUNTS HAPPEN PEOPLE FARM OR AT LEAST PLAY TO GET THE MOST BLOODPOINTS BUT THIS BLOODHUNT WAS FILLED WITH DCERS, EBONY MORIS, AND BPS. YOU'RE SERIOUSLY SUCH A FUCKING CUNT IF YOU WANT TO TRYHARD DURING A BLOODHUNT.
---
We're in the endgame now
---
Holy hell.
---
we are dropping in numbers we are about to extent.
---
Sometimes people just accuse you of tunneling when you aren't even doing it :// 
---
I only got accused of tunneling once, but that was because there were 3 Claudettes, and one Adam, and Adam's tan coat was like a beacon compared to the Claudette's dark clothes, so I kept finding the Adam.
---
Yeah the grind is excessive at this point. Even spending efficiently, only getting one survivor to P3 and only leveling up survivors or killers whose perks I care for, and only prestiging killers I like... I’ve gotten nowhere after 330 hours in gave as steam has told me. Like holy hell. I get the blood point economy needs to be enticing so that low scores can feel like a punishment for playing in ways that aren’t fun for the other team (Mori, tunnel/camping) but this is beyond reasonable if you haven’t been playing since release
---
Beware, if I remember correctly, if they had adrenaline it would have gotten them up. Prob still would have caught them, but it would take a little while.  
---
Just a warning.
---
Iv seen thia guy before but he always dodged my lobbies lmao
---
They can’t because they didn’t get the ACTUAL Scream License. Only the License for the Mask. Hence why the name is probably “The Ghost” and not “The Scream”
---
TOwO late
---
Didn’t even realize this but they also buffed but what was the point of the buff if it doesn’t even work anymore
---
It’s **your** Internet homie. Did the whole squad DC at the same time randomly?
---
#you'reoverreacting
---
new traps will not work when all gens are done so now pigs have to use them before the last gen is finished. that is it.
---
Yea, I know about the adrenaline. Would not have done much however since she still had to open the gate and thus could just chase and chase
---
Every game

I did this to a Dwight last night, he almost reached the hatch but I downed him and closed it in front of him, but then adrenaline proc’d and I was like “wait. What?” And chased him down again
---
I’m fast as fuck boii
---
Legion is about mobility and information, in addition he enforces new objective on Survivors (mending).
---
* Mobility, vaulting pallets and windows, buffed to 115% speed
---
* Information, hitting a survivor in frenzy entends frenzy and reveals location of other survivors
---
* Additional objective, forcing survivors to do a quick objective, mending
---
Just base kit? I think he's better than most of the other 
---
&gt; shitty M1 killer(s)
---
I JUST STARTED PLAYING THIS GAME ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO, AND I'M NOT SURE IF I'M THE ASSHOLE NOT KNOWING STRATS OR WHAT. I'M MAD I HAVEN'T PLAYED SOONER BECAUSE NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON.
---
hope you have a good. 
---
this conversation was useless though D: we obviously look for different things in the game. i bet if we'd try each other's medicine here we'd see what's up. but unfortunately i hated dbd on ps4. it's so limiting not just cause of fps but because controller is just not a way to play this type of game imo. but i'm overall pc snob so not really my place to say, too biased.
---
HE TAKES A PICTURE IN THE MORI AHHHHH!!!
---
Yellow range addon works better than the green one
---
it still has a long enough range and shorter cast time helps a lot
---
Hate to be that guy, but I'd make sure to block out names in the future. One of the rules of this here.
---
I’m having long lobby wait times on both sides but I think it’s because they implemented a better matchmaking with this patch so that there should be less discrepancies between ranks, which means a longer wait.
---
I might be alone on this but id rather use the 25% cone increase instead of the 75%, it just takes so long to charge the power theres no point to use it in a chase.
---
True. I'm hoping they nerf Ghost a little bit and they probably will, but if not then us Sp00py Myers mains are screwed
---
Almost there!
---
I was so worried because Legion honestly has the Beat Mori and I was hoping so bad that this one would live up to expectations.
---
THEY EXCEEDED THEM. 
---
It’s like freaking D.Va’s Selfie Highlight Intro. 🖤
---
OOOOOOF that was absolutely evil
---
WHAT GAMING SUBREDDIT ISNT
---
I became one after answering questions like that for the thousandth time
---
The thing about the change to Frenzy's speed is that yeah, it's slower, but it also lasts like twice as long, so it's still just as effective of not more so for closing to the distance as the old Frenzy. Deep Wounds isn't really a threat any more, but it never really was. The terror radius change kind of sucks, but it's still manageable.
---
I can not wrap my head around why everyone is acting like the Legion change was a massive nerf. It wasn't. He was nerfed in a bunch of areas that either didn't really do much, still can be dealt with or had buffs to compensate for them, and was buffed in areas that were extremely important.
---
Pretty sure it's a buck 120, like in the movies.
---
you know this has been posted over and over again since endgame collapse was announced, right?
---
Look man, intentionally targeting any single survivor is tunneling. If you’re not, don’t play sub-optimal unless you want to be nice. That’s it.
---
When they said they are going to change it I got happy
---
well they buffed the numbers, but they also made an entire mechanic (killer's ability to close the hatch) to make sure it's never usable.
---
I was hoping to Hope-like Haste or something like that so it COULD be used to find the hatch faster or something... I'm sad now.
---
Why are you even mentioning scary movie??? ITS A PARODY
---
Wrong. Huntress just unlocked her hidden power, the force.
---
Y'all are fuckin thirsty
---
This upsets me, nothing worse than having your team on the other side of the map dying and the only gen being worked on is the one you are on.
---
COLLISION ONLY DISAPPEARS AFTER A HIT, IF YOU GET IN FRONT OF A SURV THEY CANT MOVE PAST UNLESS YOU HIT THEM
---
Anyone abusing a bug will get tunneled till they DC or die, afterwards I'm going afk. People who abuse shit shouldn't be rewarded with anything
---
not toxic at all just how the game is played. i think they need to slow generators a bit so killers don't have to run ruin every single game.
---
...is jesus!
---
oof sorry i didnt know
---
She just stomps on the edge of it and it shuts, super basic, unfortunately :(
---
But we have already had licensed killers/contents in DBD for years now. Your insinuation that things would suddenly go up by over 200% is outlandish and nonsensical, especially when these are all cosmetics. At most, they would be the standard high end cosmetic price: 1080 auric cells.
---
He can stalk like Myers, lean around corners and crouch like the pig whenever he pleases. Sounds pretty OP on paper 🤔
---
ITS A VIABLE TACTIC REGARDLESS, ITS JUST MORE SCUMMY TO USE IT IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. SAME AS CAMPING; WILL GET YOU AN EASY KILL BUT ITS SCUMMY
---
Faking an unhook mostly works well when the killer is baiting for grabs, and has no effect on instadown killers (ahem, leatherface).
---
Trying to get the aggro early in the game implies I need to assume the killer is going to camp, and then I end up sacrificing myself. If I run the killer for too long I'm going to get camped anyway. I can't just take aggro at the start of every game, that also increases the odds of me getting camped.
---
And if I go down and get camped, odds are my teammates aren't going to do gens; they'll instead sit and watch me die on the hook, or just get grabbed. Either way, thats boring.
---
You know I might be exaggerating a little bit, but if you camp you are barely "playing the game". Sure, you have the game on infront of you, but when you're camping you aren't doing anything. 
---
Camping is an ass thing to deal with and is a problem that needs looking into.
---
never DC. no matter what.
---
Some people still dont know cloaked bing bong man does not activate borrowed time although this is mostly from my console pleb experience :3 funny as hell
---
Nah dude. SO pumped for ghostface personally
---
What about end season rewards an incentive to play
---
I understand what the perk does. What I’m saying is that the only times I get 3 genned are when I get chased for 2-3 gens and can’t control it, or on the game/lery’s. I actively make the choice to skip gens, as long as you skip a gen or 2 after completing one, the only way you get 3 genned is by your team.
---
Mods? Mods gay ?
---
My favorite is when the yOinked dies first and stays to tell you post game that you scared the absolute shit outta them. Once this guy said his heart rate was 120 bpm during that match and that made my week.
---
Omg !!
---
Yea, I watched it. But if you ask me. The EGC should be RNG. As soon as the gates are in, the Entity should randomly kill the remaining survivors. And if you set foot in the exit, you have 5 seconds to get out, if not, you're snatched up. This is obviously a bug in the game and I'm sure it'll get patched up soon. Quit your crying already.
---
i saw it yesterday... pretty sick
---
Survivor mains *looping intensifies*
---
lol, dunno if it was her or not and i inderstand she tried to annoy the shit out of me but tbh, i think that at least 2 of them could've escaped if she didn't do that.
---
HOW THE FUCK DID TRAPPER GET NEW BUGS
---
It's Amanda though, not Hoffman and her second set is based on his clothes.
---
I think you're just upset that i don't agree with you. I obviously understand what you meant but i just don't care. I'll correct someone if i want to, you don't get to decide if i should or not. THAT is the end of the discussion.
---
Guy asked a simple question, don’t be an ass. Idc if you answered it for the thousandth time.
---
His hearbeat is actually about 6~ meters in tier 1, so running monitor removes it.
---
I would like to see it
---
My god so many stupid fucking rules. How about we just play the damn game?
---
Having it as "The Scream" wouldn't make any sense anyway. He is not a Banshee.
---
they take a selfie with the person that got moried
---
It doesn’t require it, I just thought it was funny when all the survivors would go down so you slash a bunch lol I mean no ill will
---
Welcome to DBD :)
---
Grimpqntry was leatherface.
---
kate's my fave, but would like to use other girls' items on her. or maybe some guys' items too. like shirtless david, but on kate. for shirtless kate. yes.
---
With the new moris, they need to update the old ones to make them cooler and more smooth.
---
Constantly put in Central to South American lobbies. 200ms+ minimum. Would much rather wait in the "pre-lobby lobby" for a better host than have to repeatedly queue up for a match.
---
can confirm, Tofu did this exact thing during stream yesterday and the dropped survivor popped Adrenaline. didn't matter, as he still downed him a few seconds later, but it's still a factor in case anyone cares.
---
nah you are showing mercy I do the same when i play killer
---
tea
---
It's was spam for a porn site
---
Aw, it's cute. The mini hatchet is adorable. Good job.
---
SOMETHING SONETHING SWEAT CLAUDETTES FARMING ME OFF THE HOOK LETTING ME GET CAMPED SIMPLY BECAUSE I DIDNT PLAY CLAUDETTE WITH THEM. THEY SHOWED MERCY ON MY FRIEND CUZ HE'S A CLAUD MAIN TOO BUT NOOOOOO ACE JUST GOTTA DIE FUCK YOU YOU TANGLED TAINT HAIR
---
With action music!
---
If, as a killer, the only one I can find is the person who was unhooked... it's tough, but I can't just let them go, so I'll hook them again.
---
As a survivor, I don't care. It's killer's job. Yeah, I'll be out of THIS game early, but I still can join next round, right?
---
detective tapp is dead, i don’t see your point
---
But you put Spoiler. If I didn’t know Scream was gonna be added and I see a Spoiler tag on a post it overwrites the flair.
---
They could recycle l4d2 map
---
it’s not a spoiler anymore, everyone knows about it
---
The Entity: "Its *dead* by daylight, what part of that don't you understand?"
---
Yeah I could’ve sacrificed the other two that were left but I let them go since the Nea was being a lil shit. I pulled another Nea trying to unhook off of her and carried her to the gate.  😂
---
Then why did you put a Spoiler tag? Don’t make assumptions like that.
---
because people don't mind standing still for 40 seconds
---
It's better but not by much as you still don't get to play the game until somebody finally comes and picks you up
---
He can also only stalk one single person at a time instead of all 4, the leaning thing praobly wont be too useful, and we dont even know how long his stalk meter takes. 
---
His crotch proaobly wont be as useful as pig either since he has no attack out of it.
---
I actually thought of doing that, ngl
---
T1 Myers has entered the game
---
It also counters the timer!
---
As someone who only plays solo, I like it as I find teammates can be super hit or miss
---
He didn’t take a selfie he took a picture of the dead survivor
---
THANK YOU  tired of being trolled like this 
---
When i’m on a gen (in a cornered spot) a troll will walk up and block me 
---
I’ve also experienced the 99%. Troll 
---
Shove is 100% needed
---
Well thank god you can now get your shirtless david body pillow from the official bhvr shop
---
oh i didn’t even realize the spoiler tag was there, i don’t even know how to add that. i apologize 😂
---
Because
---
1. I use Botany Knowledge with it
---
2. I don't trust the average solo queue Survivor to be more helpful than a brain dead cucumber
---
That's a good point. I forgot he couldnt stalk all four at a time.
---
Omg it's even worse when you're the last one alive. BHVR, HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO OPEN A DOOR WHEN I'M BEING CHASED????????
---
Damn, I feel I would never find anyone to play with then ;p
---
True true but unless he is scratched mirror he will be tier 2 before you know it and theres a 75% chance he will find someone else first
---
I already have one? Have you even *seen* my flair?
---
I would think so considering it's literally the biggest time saving combination. 
---
It's THE only toolbox to use, unless you throw a BNP on place of the Wire Spool.
---
Yep I've been on this subreddit since Myers and he posted under the alias madmaxx14 before he was known as puppers and he posted every so often and people always critiziced him. I had no idea he was banned though.
---
Oh sorry i didn’t mean to make it seem like she didn’t deserve to be in the game because she could possibly be dead. It was just a random question I’ve always thought. I was curious to see if anyone knew
---
Why does this not have more upvotes?
---
We *need* Sidney 😤😤
---
I crave Micheals mïlky
---
You could have a power switch feature tied to it
---
tea but i’d be PERFECTLY okay with kirby or gale
---
It takes about a minute if they're just standing there..
---
Holding up the trend of keeping us informed and explaining themselves, glad to see it
---
I believe Gas Haven also has no hills, and I don't think it has anything to BL off of
---
If this is a “shadow of a game” why play it and go to its reddit, just ignore it then
---
I stop moving for about 10 seconds after hooking somebody with a twitch url in their name.
---
There's about a 50% chance that they instantly dc.
---
Yes and no, it's way easier for the killer to find the hatch. But I guess if no gens get done a chance to escape is nice.
---
no according to some stuff i’ve read, i can’t exactly remember what, but after her fan base grew, wes wanted to make her the main character of scream 5 then he sadly passed
---
DECISIVE KILL
---
That's sad
---
Oh damn....
---
Thank you! Originally I was actually making this to be more of a "Zombie" clown but later as I was shading it decided to go more for a teeth/mouth look that was inspired by a silicone mask made by studio Immortal Masks where the eyes were teeth and would move with the mask like another mouth.
---
*woosh*
---
Yeah and it's really all not that creative imo. I really wish it was more like a shape shifter or like that one Ghost Face concept that was here a long time ago.
---
That's a dumb bug
---
My point is since He's trolling on purpose and we give the attention/salt to it, he did exactly what he was trying to do
---
They generate more revenue for BHVR
---
Add it to the list of Survivior shafting bugs and balance changes that will never get patched
---
Becsuse I actually look around haha
---
I play because I fucking love it, just hate how the devs treat it, as a cash cow
---
Not when he isn't stalking me..
---
In the deleted scenes of Halloween (2018) , there is a scene of shirtless myers in the bathroom but it was the reporter (Aaron) using Myers mask as a prank, and not actually Michael.
---
Then don’t answer asshole, you either explain nicely or you fuck off.
---
/s?
---
Stealth killers are the best. Makes the game much more tense and thrilling. Love it.
---
I myself run bond, and I even use that rarely. I got used to being injured and maybe depending on adrenaline
---
Would be help for for that too. I get blocked in sometimes because I won't heal a teammate right away so they keep me stuck there until the killer comes along. This kind of shit needs to stop, and it should be put in the hands of other survivors.
---
This is the best mori since the clown's finger sucking
---
Making it based off season 3 of the show is stupid and everyone wouls rather them base it off the movies.
---
Most of his ad-ons descriptions confused the crap out of me. His power is more complicated than I thought ...
---
If it takes a Very Rare add-on to be able to ambush one person who is holding still on a gen or totem (and being unable to see the person you are jumping), I don't think it makes her much of a Stealth killer.
---
Camping is camping, face camping is just extremely toxic and I try to avoid doing it:
---
Honestly i  can't wait, hopefully their perks are good
---
You're an idiot and a troll plain and simple fuck off
---
You never experienced the Dark Times then
---
Omfg yessss i was against a nurse 1v1 with 1 gen done and as soon as i complete 1 Gen hatch closes and i got 1 shot to the ground in a span of 20 secs...
---
My god, they actually balanced Dead by Daylight for lean.
---
Yes we would prefer that but if they can't get the rights to it then they're going to do the next best thing.
---
Yes but not close application i think
---
Y`all think the new cosmetics could be hinting at a new saw movie?
---
self care teaches bad habits (like noed)
---
What if they are using Deliverance?
---
It's the Iridescent Stone Add on- a random unarmed trap arms itself every 30 seconds, if i remember correctly.
---
Played game against spirit. She hooked last survivor and walked straight to the hatch. This feels like legion all over again. No counter-play. Before I had the option of taking the hatch or doing gates. This just increased the difficulty to insane.
---
Put Billy in the middle.
---
Ah yes longer ques for everyone totally what the game needs at this point in its life
---
??? Myers get exposed for a full minute with no addons against every survivor, and stalking any survivor potentially means any survivor can be 1hit. Ghostface's power is against solely 1 person meaning you won't be able to do the insta EW3 trick to knock someone else down. The only thing that makes ghostface's power better is how much stealthier he can be with it on certain maps with lean and crouch.
---
under the building in the swamp map isn’t there a chain thingy ? That sorta signifies to lord
---
this should cover it.  [Entity: "Fine. I'll do It myself."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGzYaiiMlY)
---
Since the update, I'm going up against the spirit mainly. Really toxic builds too. There's no counter-play if they find the hatch first.
---
Someone found this one in the data: [https://twitter.com/LainWasTaken/status/1125814529932365825](https://twitter.com/LainWasTaken/status/1125814529932365825)
---
I really wish it worked *outside* a chase as well so it could be stacked with Monitor, but it still sounds interesting and it thankfully doesn't rely on tunneling to work.
---
Very true. So many games in the library not enough time
---
Same I saw her the second time I watched it.
---
Yeah, but you are not negotiating anything here and we already have custom cosmetics for licensed characters like Ash and Pig.
---
I guess, didn't it say though that it was a cannibal village?
---
Yet you could still miss him.
---
And again you are wrong, i have given up the thought of anything productive coming from this as soon as you started the nonesense of trippling down.
---
*RIP Friday the 13th.*
---
\^ This.
---
Then you're at a terrible rank. Because when I play solo people heal me and wake me up and save I'm red rank...
---
Blow off choffer.
---
Also the motivations of one of the killers from Scream 4, which fits this mori pretty well.
---
My first game with this update the other 3 survivors DC (SWF..go figure) within 20 seconds and killer closes hatch and starts the collapse. 1/4 of a gen done. Guess I’m just fucked, get a few BP and lose pip. Awesome.
---
Can't believe you thought what you were doing here was productive in the first place lmao
---
She kinda slams down on it, similar to breaking a pallet iirc
---
M'lampkin lane
---
M'lithe
---
M'lightbringer
---
Idea: cypress mori should be always on, and they should add different mori animations as cosmetics.
---
Then you're are playing at a bad rank..  and I'm not a man fyi..
---
you deserved it tbh lol
---
Yeah I suppose, but Billy was also a launch character and LF came out over a year later with the popularity and success, while the masked teenage slasher came out just about 5 months ago. But I guess the Ghostface guy could have approached them and they were happy to say yes, or maybe BHVR gave up on getting Ghostface and made their own and then Ghostface finally came back and said yes.
---
There is counterplay.
---
Camp a door (Wake Up can help) and get on it as soon as the hatch closes.
---
Unlikely, he would have had to be right on me to stalk me.
---
Scroll past it bud. I feel no sympathy for whiners looking for affirmations.
---
I hope not.
---
Never doubt it.
---
Most of all the DLC maps are realated to a killer though?
---
CAN I GET PLAYERS LIKE THIS WHEN I'M PLAYING AS AMANDA? COS EVERY TIME I QUEUE UP AS HER I SEEM TO RUN INTO 4 OF THE MOST ELITE SURVIVALISTS IN THE FUCKING WORLD! EVERY TIME ITS 4 FUCKING MEGS WHO'VE GOT MORE SELF PRESERVATION TACTICS THAN BEAR FUCKING GRYLLS!
---
*Mori's you instantly*
---
thanks for the extra BP ggez
---
They are, its just it would be nice to have the map where their lore took place.
---
I still think to this day we dont have a true Stealth killer.
---
You're right, I forgot about the multiple people under the Ghostface persona.
---
She just stomps on it :( kinda sucks that only a couple get special animations
---
I love getting called a hook camper when all 3 survivors are literally trying to save them off the hook. Like what the fuck do you want me to do. I’m sorry I’m protecting what you are trying to get.
---
Yes, but it's for sure not about bloodpoints with these people
---
I WAS PLAYING TOMBSTONE MYERS AND THE LAST SURVIVOR KEPT JUMPING IN A LOCKER TO AVOID THE MORI. THIS GOES ON FOR 5 FUCKING MINUTES UNIL I REALIZE IM OUT OF STALK. I WAS SO FUCKING CLOSE TOO.
---
That sucks since she too breaks pallets and gens with her weapon :(
---
I hate claudettes..  I hate having them as teammates.  But yes I do run mom,ds,adrenaline and dH, to help me last to the end game. Without it I'm dead..  I run a medkit.  Not a toolbox.. assume much?  I recently switched mt build because I'm a red rank survivor and i get tunneled and fucked with a lot. I'm trying survive.. all red rank killers run bbq,ruin, nurses and different fourth perks but here lately a lot of noed..
---
Devils advocate, the devs saw all the complaints about legion and saw how pig could end up with similar problems with EGC, which is what they said about the nerf with the RBT stopping in the terror radius (similar to moon walking). They reverted that because that makes the RBT near worthless and was almost immediately noted as a bad change. With how they said they are looking into pig changes and are not done with her, it’s possible this current nerf we got could already be the a proactive nerf for the foreseeable buff. 
---
Remember they said along the lines of “nerf something to buff something. They are looking for a trade off and not just a straight buff, meaning it could be a pretty strong buff.
---
Your point about it never meaning more than one kill is correct pre EGC, but post EGC we won’t know, it’s just my theory of a potential tactic that could have been, so no evidence for that. 
---
Off topic, I don’t get why you’re getting downvoted, this is a pretty good debate and you’re not being toxic at all. I guess that’s just how reddit is.
---
I knowwww, DBD really tends to take over! I just started Bendy and the Ink Machine.
---
Its not really a discussion thread, just you shit talking people that say they use it
---
I would just love an app for my phone that’s like this, my phone is always beside me so it would just be more efficient and less time consuming
---
Stealth killers keeping survivors feeling a little bit anxious and swiveling their camera around is a really good thing.  Especially during this focus on gens and hammer out gens even through ruin meta we find ourselves in.
---
That said, I hope the ghost is different enough from myers that they just dont just feel like re-skins of eachother. And if his obsession based stealth perk is real, I hope dedicated servers and stricter dc punishments come quickly because I notice a much higher rate in dc's from obsessions.
---
I myself have started the original borderlands game with borderlands 3 coming soonish, and the enhanced edition getting to me for free
---
NO, I DIDN'T PLAY AMANDA WRONG IN THAT LAST GAME AND NO, SHE ISN'T "STRONG". SHE IS QUITE FUCKING POSSIBLY THE WORST KILLER AT THE MOMENT, GIVEN HER ENTIRE MO SIMPLY DOESN'T FUCKING ACTIVATE. AND YET YOU, MR WHATEVER-THE-FUCK-YOUR-MOTHER-SPAT-OUT, CALL ME BAD?! YEAH GREAT, FUCKING COME HERE AND TELL ME JUST HOW YOU ENVISION THAT A CHARACTER WHO WAS ALREADY LOW TIER BEFORE BEING FUCKING NERFED IS A STRONG CHARACTER? HMMM?! BECAUSE IT SEEMS REMARKABLY AS IF YOU JUST WANTED TO SAY YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME. BUT GUESS WHAT, SINCE YOU WERE A MEG WITH 4 OF THE MOST TOXIC SURVIVOR PERKS IN THE FUCKING GAME, AND I WAS AMANDA, I THINK THE CONTEST WAS PRETTY FUCKING BIASED!
---
How old did you say your sister was?
---
Beautiful ☺️
---
This not happening is a perk why not run that instead?? Oh because it's useless... I like to play with self confident people who dont rely on selfcare.
---
If you don't like the killer, you hit the bin icon. Their method wasn't getting it over with, given their camping, nor necessary since they'd proven to be fully capable already.
---
Depends but usually some perk that is for the survivor. Like Alert on Feng.
---
It would make his power more intrtresrting as honestly its boring as the entire thing is based on T3. T1 adn T2 dont give much of anything
---
Here they are:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwSzUspp3XI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwSzUspp3XI) 
---
She's wearing a leather jacket on one of them and (I think) the clothes Amanda was wearing in the movie before actually joining Jigsaw.
---
Hey! Yeah I figured so. Unfortunately I didn't bad much programming in the mobile area so hopefully I'm going to get the website to a stage where it's easy to use on the phones.
---
Yeah like temple, ormond, yamoaka. I'm talking about like clown's map, wraith's azarov's resting, hillbilly's map, would be nice to have like a mansion (because his parents were rich),
---
I use Sprint Burst, Empathy, Self Care, and Urban Evasion. I'm trying to get Balanced Landing and I'm going to switch it with Sprint Burst.
---
Anyone want a rooftop lery's map? I was messing around in hammer map maker and thought it was cool having a map on top of mercy hospital.
---
It was a cypress. I waited at the gates and ran around the entire map before I found the hatch. It was taking forever and who knows how much longer if I was a sore loser who wanted to not be seen to make it like the old hatch standoffs.
---
A student film. A very low budget student film.
---
Yeah, I main Michael and I could agree. I’ve had more dynamic plays if I rough it out and try sticking to T1. On certain maps it’s fun like on Lery’s, but others it can be frustrating as heck. I like the idea.
---
Nah i play with the mentality no man left behind. I try my best to save everyone and be an all around decent teammate.  I'm not a selfish player which is why I dont run selfishcare.
---
Thank you so much! That means the world to me, having my work getting recognized.
---
I would drop serious money on the Saw 2 house!
---
Yup. And it it’s the only one closed, that will be the one
---
It is. Just because you choose to ignore common sense doesn't devalue any ideas.
---
I love how you’re bitching that he’s crying...when you’ve cried significantly more. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Dead hard, we'll make it, borrowed time and adrenaline
---
Could be the Ormond mini mall. Fits the Legion as a hangout spot, and a failed mall in a small town is not unheard of.
---
Nah fuck that stalking/leaning animation lol, That shit's gonna get me more than Myers and Pig. Imagine doing a gen, panning the camera, and you just see his head peeking around the wall. Fuck that shit bro lol i'm not ready.
---
DS, MoM, Adrenaline and Self Care or Borrowed Time.
---
Im never going down twice, or in the rare case I do, DS helps me as well as MoM lets me take nearly Endless Hits 
---
Its often super toxic agaibdr M1 Killers, but its super fun
---
Oh hey Jesus, my dad got eaten by le entity.
---
Medkits are finite, self care is infinite. There's also Franklin's.
---
Have had plenty of matches with killers who land first hit but then i loop them until they give up or lose them.
---
And then i take a hit to body block another survivor from getting downed.
---
Then he finds me again and i take another hit.
---
Body block another down. 
---
Etc.
---
I can't medkit through all of that and can't always rely on other survivors to keep healing me endlessly especially if it's not safe to do so.
---
So self healing alone in a corner can keep me topped up to keep taking those hits for the team and waste the killers time and prevent downs.
---
Not saying there isn't a trade off but self care isn't 'useless'.
---
A red count down after leaving a lobby.  Was always frustrating cause it adds up after having to leaving all the bad ping lobbies. Now they've added another, new ping timer that doesn't need to be there. Stop wasting my time behaviour.
---
Besides going in T2 littrely doenst do anything but make ihm a normal killer. He loses his entire Stealth aspect hes supposed to have.
---
Dude chillax, first off who took a dump in your cereal today? And second i don't think self confidence has anything to do with using perks, i mean look at all the situations where your injured and nobody comes to heal you? Now what? Your screwed, like yea skill can help you get out of most situations but not all of them.
---
This excites me.
---
The title has a spoiler in it. It says "Ghostface mori". You read it and now you know he's coming to the fucking game.
---
It should if your account got phished and someone took it for a joyride and got you banned from one or more games before you re-secured it.
---
Nah I think he's sitting on the survivor's back and is just lifting their head
---
Well apparently you are, because healing either right off the hook or out in the open literally puts you and the person you're healing in a position to be caught off guard. 
---
Which is going to waste more "precious time" ya idgit.
---
F selfishcare.. I run adrenaline, mom, ds, and deadhard or switch out one for borrowed time.
---
Yeah if pizza boi dwight doesn't break the mood then this doesnt either.
---
I doubt they will change his visibility in the rework.
---
I thought the cosmetic team made all the game updates /s
---
Nice to see someone on this sub who understands there’s more than one team
---
Lithe, Dance With Me, Poised and Distortion
---
I like leaving no scratch marks, lol.
---
The only thing I've ignored are your arguments.
---
I'm not gonna argue with stupid people.
---
What an icon in horror. We are so lucky to have had someone like Wes
---
Stop running bbq and nurses those are such crutch perks lul
---
That's it. Thanks
---
Oh dang, I didn’t know that. I loved her character in Scream.
---
I don’t think so, it’s probably cause I got max blood points in all the categories and red everything
---
Cats and dogs do cry from their eyes though, you just won't see anything but the wet stains in their fur right under it.
---
My source is a dog I had that had over-watery eyes so we had to clean him up all the time, and the other being my cat when he got scratched on his nose by another cat.  It doesn't look anything like these pictures.
---
DS doesn't work from grabs from 100% of the times I've seen that. Kinda silly, but may be intended. A tip is not to be an idiot and run to work on a gen after getting farmed lol. You also wasted your savior's Borrowed Time.
---
Vault window yOINKs are the goddamn best. I just want Amanda to like turn em round so they look right at her before she shoulders em. Like "Nu-uh-uh bitch!"
---
same but some people were saying they addressed ash as a chapter as well. it lines up with the next full chapter release dates though
---
To be fair, they made her really likable in the movie
---
And cosmetics for Laurie hopefully!!!! &lt;3
---
I hope they also put in hints of the original Freddy because I think the one in game is based off of a 2000’s remake (could be wrong)
---
Shut the fuck up, im just tired hearing people complain all the damn time, grow up already you waste of foreskin
---
Yeah, I’ve found he’s not as fun in higher ranks unless it’s situational, like what I said before with the map. T1 sucks because of the crazy tiny lunge with no add ons, but T2 really should have a smaller terror radius imo
---
Here's to hoping it's actually for people DCing on purpose who get a temp ban. Can't wait til that is implemented, I am so sick and tired of those people. 13 games tonight, 11 of which had DCs, 8 of which had a 3 man SWF DCing. #solosurvivorlife
---
wazzzzzzzzzzzzupppppppppppp
---
It is, he looks like old Freddy had a stroke. Wish the old one was a skin or something.
---
Everyone seems to be calling for a buff. I can't seem to see his grass movements at all and have a tough time tracking him. Hope the rebuild will make him a lil more visible or put him on a timer or something.
---
Thank you! Looks intense lol.
---
Bitch fuck your civilized manner, im gonna talk how i want too
---
No Ash definitely was not a chapter. Remember that there were 4 killers to start and there have been 11 chapters since. Ghostface’s is chapter 12. Chapters are based on killers not survivors p sure.(saying this cause lewrherfwce is an exception due to coming with no survivor)
---
And one liners! They need to add in some Freddy one liners gosh darn it!
---
I agree.. 2 min countdown was dumb they should've stuck with 3 mins or kept the 15 second opening doors thing. One or the other... being a survivor is annoying
---
Tbh, this collapse does give the killer he edge if it finds the hatch as it should be. The survivor should not have the edge when they are the last ones left.
---
Get a grip my dude. No one feels bad for you.
---
You say it like they ruined the sex of your first born or endgame for you.
---
The ghostface leak is majorly public beyond this thread. 
---
It must be hard work trying to make a stink out of absolutely nothing.
---
yes i know what a chapter is. the devs referred to ash as a chapter, not me
---
... Which is something they should do anyway, to be fair.
---
For both him and Ash tbh
---
Imagine every survivor in a game running this build
---
Dead Hard, Mettle of Man, Decisive, WGLF. Too many campers and tunnellers on PS4 so I have to run this or i’m basically dead after the first chase.
---
Endgame Collapse. After either an Exit Gate has been opened or the hatch has been closed, a timer will start that puts pressure on the Survivors and Killer. The timer slows if a survivor is downed or hooked. Once the timer runs out, all survivors still in the trial are instantly sacrificed.
---
STOPPED PLAYING THIS GAME SINCE THEY ADDED MORE LOBBY TIMERS. (NOW YOU WAIT TO SEE THE TRUE PING AND YOU WAIT BEFORE YOU CAN SEARCH FOR ANOTHER LOBBY.)
---
DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO PLAY YOUR GAME BEHAVIOUR?
---
you got your swish
---
Then you are countering your own statement about surviving. MoM is a selfish perk, DH is selfish. Nó one left behind would be things like Bond, Borrowed Time, Pebble und such.
---
Then why don’t you design them for Behaviour and get the license holders to approve them.
---
Just to clarify, the referenced window blocking is meant to occur once a vault is hopped over 3 times in quick succession, right? Are there any vaults where this shouldn't apply? I think this bug happened to me on Coldwind where a Dwight hopped over the right tractor window over and over and I just want to make sure that there is no bug-less situation where hopping over a window 3 times in a short period will result in no entity summoned, in chase or not.
---
I need this in my life so bad. 
---
I'd also love a construction site map.
---
See I'm not afraid of the killer I run everywhere... I'm not no sprint burst gamer thank you next
---
If people are downed the timer speed is cut in half. 4 minutes is soooo much time to do what you need to do. 2 people could fully die on a hook in that time lol
---
Nah give me hot naked zaddy meyers instead🔥
---
Maybe if the forums were flooded around the movie and not this game then the demand would be met.
---
A castle map would be cool also i do have some ideas for outdoor ones, like a carnival map(not like the one at Cambells but a full blown one) I'd also really
---
That you would run to a corner says more about your mindset quite frankly. Urban evasion is a thing. Try using it.
---
Not with borrowed time now.  
---
They can just run out and you can't stop them.
---
Damn, can't believe hook is becomming a killer
---
love it - make it happen!
---
Not bashing stating facts about selfcare and the people who run it. I have countless hours proving that people who run selfcare use it at the worst times.
---
If a Survivor is able to take hits, loosing the killer in a chase coming back with full health states and being able to repeat the cycle then the survivor has distracted the killer long enough for the other 3 to finish Gens.
---
Advising against running to the corner and wasting time is me saying I would run to the corner?
---
You're fucking stupid.
---
Only when it's convenient for them
---
Remember the dev statement when they reverted the new matchmaking in the middle of the ranked season after they also made it more difficult to rank up which made it impossible to play until rank reset if you were highrank
---
Oh wait
---
There wasn't one, because they would have to acknowledge that it was an incredibly dumb thing to do
---
Coldwind Farm has always had 5 variations. None were introduced with Leatherface.
---
Lions, we played on haddonfield against Freddy. I was running behind you for a good minute to get healed before I got downed.
---
They can still bodyblock to protect the person though.
---
You're very annoying my dude
---
Next Tuesday folks. Remember how fast Ash was released after the leak.
---
Ok, Billy and huntress do fine on coldwind. What other maps that I stated are good for killers? Btw, DCing just cause it's a certain map is pathetic, because that's the ONLY killer sided map! Why do you feel so entitled to having 50 safe pallets every game, and when you get only 8, you have to DC?
---
i agree. it's creepy as fuck to look around and see myers standing there, just staring at you. it's fun!
---
Then it's your teammates, and you just gotta live with their incompetence.
---
Jane is thick is so cringe though.
---
Oh really
---
Which means you end up on the hook more often than not and others gave to save your useless ass because you lack stealth.
---
Probably set as a brown perk to make it more common for play testers to find in bloodwebs. Since if they made it green they may not receive it until level 50+ at tier 3
---
Are you the one I spoke to in  private message? If so I explained everything
---
Well that’s what I’ve heard
---
A balanced game right there.
---
yo, that one person was correct about the knife wipe
---
But there's still only two possibilities: She either stays where she is and waits for you to get close, or she jumps to your current position and tries to hit you. Even when mindgaming, you still know if she is trying to use her power (or feint it).

Compare that to Silent Wraith. When his heartbeat disappears out of LoS, there is no way to know if he lost you and went elsewhere, or if he is still on your trail and waiting to strike, or heading you off from a different direction entirely. The warning you have is minimal unless you have very sharp eyes, and even then he is free to move around corners to conceal his uncloak from you.
---
By comparison, Spirit is a LOT more limited in how far she can move and what direction she can hit from since she has a short "sprint" of invisibility, but the duration is finite.
---
I didn't see that this was for dbd at first and I was so confused lol
---
Thanks
---
It's baffling how few survivors use items, you should ALWAYS run one and medkits are generally the best
---
You said running. Just you. I never said a damn thing about doing that, hence YOUR mindset. Choose your words better.
---
I mean I just dont see you doing this every match.. im not buying it.
---
Ooooh a castle map would be so epic! and you'd also really what?
---
It does acaullty, it has a 16 meter TR. But even then, thats ALL he gets out of his power in T2 he has nothing else. 
---
His entire power is based on T3 which sucks
---
How can you laugh at the death of this Dwight?
---
C
---
Piggy, not because she has something special but i've always been a fan of Saw series and Amanda was and still is my favorite character + the Saw chapter was the reason why i got into dbd
---
I keep seeing this suggestion and I truly think it's a awesome idea. The actual ghostface the thing that the mask is made from.
---
My mindset is to heal after unhooking dumb ass.
---
The problem is that it’s not like we have this huge triple A player base with constant new people coming in lie fortnite or something. This would make it harder to find games for everyone and tbh this game has some of the most toxic player base and mean grudge holding people I’ve ever seen and would lead to this feature being spammed every other game.
---
lol
---
I change mine all the time. My go to meta build is self care, BL,mettle of man and adrenaline. The past couple of days its been dead hard, resilience, spine chill and adrenaline( but i switched adrenaline a few times for bond, mettle and self care
---
Which is fucking stupid. Stop doing that.
---
Also End Game Collapse.
---
Fiannlly played some matches with the new mechanic (I'm on PS4).
---
Great change and massive quality of life improvement.
---
Top left
---
My personal favorite is Myers mainly because I was already a huge fan of his before he came into the game, but once he was in the game it became apparent that you could have a standard M1 killer who would be effective at all ranks due to how flexible he can be with add-ons and different perk builds. He’s a perfect blank slate for either a new killer or an experienced one.
---
No longer whitelisted, if EAC starts banning for it you are completely fucked
---
Honestly you just seem like an overly critical bitch that just wants to complain about something. Let people run whatever the hell they want. You have 4 perk slots worry about yourself and not what others are building.
---
Good reason, all of Dead By Daylight exclusive horror movie characters (like SAW) are what makes the game special in my opinion
---
Urban Evasion, Spine Chill, Dark Sense, and then a toss-up between Streetwise, Lightweight, and Hope. Yes, I am a scummy immersed Nea main, why do you ask?
---
I can't believe you used the word kind to describe yourself lmao
---
Literally have played since launch. Try getting lower than rank 10.
---
Shame, but now you can just get the hatch.
---
If only there were 50 safe pallets on each map. If bloodlust wasnt a thing I might be alright with killer sided maps. But man fuck bloodlust gamers.. killers are already faster than survivors then they give something else to make your even faster seems asisine to me.
---
My build is: Adrenaline, Spine Chill, Self-Care and Urban Evasion.
---
I plan to take Self-Care off, but I'm not sure which perk should replace it.
---
Spine Chill + Urban Evasion is a really good combo for my stealth-ish playstyle
---
Yo everybody, pick up the phone!!
---
My friend loves stalking with Michael Myers and pouncing on people and scaring the sh*t outta them its great
---
Poised ia actually pretty good helps you fake the killer out and lose chases
---
Excited to add another jumpscare killer/build to the rotation. Scratched Mirror Myers, Silent Bell/All Seeing Wraith, Prayer Beads Spirit, Mint Rag Hag are my favorite builds to play not because they can be broken but because I love the idea of keeping the survivors on the edge that you could be around the corner.
---
Played since launch but never learn anything. Good for you? Lol
---
You are actually nice compared to the killers I've faced, ever had a Nurse completly destoying your team, knocking you down and just closing the hatch and waiting for the entity kill while they stare you down to make sure you don't get to use Unbreakable or Adrenaline?
---
Yeah and yeah you did, but it’s still one more reason to run self care. Most of my matches at rank 4 and 5 are with potatoes, so I can’t count on them.
---
Playin stealthy or what I like to call it scared isnt for me anymore. It's boring. I do my part best believe
---
More like wondering if the ghostface cosmetics are a precursor for a new Scream movie
---
The little mermaid
---
I usually shit on other people's ideas, but even I have to say that these are awesome map ideas.
---
Cmon! Survivors has been teabagging in the end match for like 3 years and now that the roles have turned, the killer can't have not even a bit of revenge? That's hypocrisy right there.
---
MoM, DH, DS + Hope or DH/BL, Open-Handed, Iron Will, Bond (i also love running DH, Empathy, Botany Knowledge + Solidarity)
---
As stated in another comment if your able to run the killer around, lose them, heal up and grab the killers attention again(and do that as many times as you need) then self care isn't really useless, esepcially since medkits can only be used a certain amount of times while self care can be used as many times as you want(also stated in another comment) plus mettle only works one time and is best used with self care aswell due to the fact you can get the first two, heal up with selfcare, take the third amd if you manage to lose the killer again you can heal up again and now your at full health with mettle ready to go. Simple really.
---
If it makes it to the game, I'm gonna play Leatherface.
---
why are the eyes blocjed on the mori?
---
If you run away from your healer don't get shitty when you don't get healed dumb ass. It's like standing up and leaving half way through a hair cut the stylist isn't gonna waste time chasing you.
---
People like you are the reason generators never get done.
---
Agreed what's the point of buying all those if you arent gonna use them.. I run medkits all the time
---
Reminds me of a time I was playing pig and had killed 3 survivors, and the 4th, a person with TTV in their name, was taking a little bit to find the hatch. I opened up their stream (I was gonna give hatch and was getting impatient) to see this girl is in full terror mode crouching around the garage in Autohaven Wreckers. THATS why I play killer.
---
i havent played the update yet but i cant wait to do that🤣
---
Id also really want a map with some form of water in it, I feel like that would be cool. I accidentally pressed post lol.
---
Yeah, why evade when you can hold up a bright red light and yell "here i am!!"
---
I like the new DS because I can actually hit it
---
#3 sounds like the opening of Intergalactic.
---
would loooove them to use that nerve-gas house from saw 2... that place was awesome
---
Why you gotta call me out my name ? Did I call you names? Grow up little guy
---
I wouldn't be against a perkless mode for beginners, but I don't know if there's numbers for the matchmaking to properly support it.
---
I’m calling it as it is your out here bashing some person for using Botany Knowledge + Self Care calling it “Useless” you’re not here to discuss Self Care you’re here to shit on it and it comes across as bitchy. You’re not even acknowledging other peoples opinions you’re just straight up bashing. FFS what are people supposed to run what is okay on your standards? Crutch perks? Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time? You’re the one that needs to grow up.
---
This killer is the most balanced because he can shift his weight side to side.
---
 I understand I was just giving my opinion on the dbd one. Time will tell about their licensing based on what the lore looks like and if we get a survivor or not.
---
Damn no flash
---
For the first few months of playing this game, I only played survivor. Myers always scared the shit out of me. You’re just chilling on a gen and looking around and all the sudden you see his face stalking you and it’s just an instant “*oh fuck*” moment. The fear factor of this game dies pretty quick imo until eventually you’re experienced and can loop/dodge/etc. There’s few killers who have that scaring ability and I’d say Myers is one of them. He was the first killer I really mastered andnis by far my favorite to play. As you stated, his base kit allows for tons of diversity with builds. Personally I use Monitor and Abuse, BBQ, Enduring, and then Sloppy. M&amp;A is a must on him. You have no terror radius at EW1 and can usually get a grab off of a gen early if you approach the gen correctly. From there you can just delay the game with sloppy. Honestly I don’t go into EW3 all that much, perhaps even to a fault. Making survivors feel like you could be anywhere at any given time is what makes him dominant.
---
The chapter's still scheduled for next month, they can't release an unfinished chapter early just because it's been leaked.
---
BUT THINK OF THE THRILL AS YOU JAM THE DOOR CLOSED BUTTON, all while the killer advances and you are yelling "COME ON FUCKIN' SHUUUUT!!!!"
---
Oh ok. That just seemed a little weird to me and I am quite paranoid.
---
In all seriousness though, we could really use a Brundelfly or similar killer.
---
Maybe a Brundelbee?
---
&gt; Michael was literal called The before this game came out.
---
r/ihadastroke Yeah, Michael was called "The Shape" in the movie credits and is thus called "The Shape" in the game.
---
And yeah, but Ghostface was never called "The Scream", ever. He was called Father Death and "The Icon of Halloween", but never "The Scream". So no, it still wouldn't make any sense. At least "The Ghost" follows with his namesake.
---
Also i agree with you. Rank 1 isnt worth it and it is so salty and sweaty and just shitty overall. Sometimes i dc on my death hook to lose pips but i never really derank past rank 5. I never DC unless its death hook though. My friends nd I play on ps4 and we all agree more killers tunnel and camp at rank 1 than any other rank and we are just fed up so we try to stay out of those ranks. If we had a real reason to be there thayd be a different story
---
ok
---
.....uhhh because it drains his FF and makes him eat 4 seconds of fatigue!?!?
---
Did you read the post?
---
I was carrying last survivor to the hatch today. They didn’t wiggle like a good boi. While I was looking for it, he started to wiggle, so I dropped him and used my yellow mori. 
---
I really only think I was an asshole because it was leatherface, and his mori is brutal.
---
No, they just wanted to make Legion. Ghostface has been in the works since last year.
---
Imo it depends if you're decent looping (and i use it because of Mettle of man).
---
Ok but this game has never had one piece of motion capture animation and ever animation is created frame by frame so that point is completely irrelevant.
---
Same! It has a lot of potential.
---
I would assume their reasoning is all because of 2 perks which aren't used that much : No Mither and Unbreakable..
---
I'll respect that opinion of yours and we will see.
---
try to exhale as you take a picture my dude
---
I dont know hybridpanda... but puppers youtube is just stream highlights, hes really just a twitch streamer, but his streams are very enjoyable to watch and remains very active with his community. Hes just an overall super nice guy would recommend his twitch 100%
---
No one escapes death
---
You don't seem to get the point. 
---
It has matchmaking but not with your rank. There are plenty rank 18 - 20 players that are normally rank 8 or so. When they would be able to match with new players they could just play and play with new players because they dont change the rank. !! That's why it's not rank based matchmaking !! 
---
As I said, there are other statistics to be based on with matchmaking. Like overall ingame hours, how many overall escapes, points etc. but NOT the rank. 
---
Get it.
---
Fuck the reboot
---
set spoiler
---
Yeah I can understand it in that situation but overall I'm really enjoying it so far! It gives a whole new mechanic to the game and makes it intense
---
You know the difference because of the broken status icon when using deliverance
---
Imagine one way, working escalators.  Adds a bit of strategy since running one way would slow you down and going from the other side would speed you up.
---
For solo: Aftercare, DS, MoM, SB
---
Why is the killer unable to move?
---
Super Freddy Suuuuuuuucks.
---
Yep. First two seasons were pretty good. Fuck the reboot exactly.
---
Heresy
---
\*terror radius abruptly cuts off when you reach 85%\*
---
This made me laugh harder than it should of 😂😂
---
That's what the perk was designed to do though,  why should you be able to hold them there while the endurance effect wears off?
---
Jokes on you, I run it anyway.
---
r/timetravel
---
Me too sometimes
---
Billy boi
---
Oh god I’m so tired of these fucking PTB’s
---
Oh fuck. Lol
---
Spinechill/Premonition/Object of Obsession. It is still total bullshit.
---
A lot of of people liked it, but not as many do now. Maybe seeing it in game just makes it a more believaboe concept.
---
Awww that's cute! 😊
---
I do use mori's, but won't until they've been hooked twice, and no DCing. 
---
No tbagging or DC as survivor.
---
I like the idea of a perkless mode. So new players dont get bbq'd, nurses and ruined to death at the start but I think there aren't so much new players. I would play it tho, no perks, items and add ons, just the clean survivor and killer.
---
Why did the timer jump down randomly?

---
I'd argue for something different on the first: You have extensive experience in horror films, and can piece together the secrets of how a killer operates. For each 4/3/2 generators completed, a random, active killer perk is revealed to you for 5/7/10 seconds. When the last generator is repaired, all of the Killer's perks are revealed to you.

And, of course, you need quotes:

---
I hope he is not too add-on reliant. I am fine if he needs just brown/yellow add-ons to be decent, because these add-ons are very easy to get from the blood web. I include brown and yellow add-ons in my killer tier list because I think add-ons shouldn't be completely ignored, because I almost never see a killer playing in red ranks without add-ons. But if a killer already needs green or purple add-ons to be at least playable, then it's a problem with his base kit being too weak. We have so many killers who are crap without their best add-ons, we don't need another one. Please, don't make The Ghost a "why the fuck you play him without his purple add-ons" killer.
---
This person has made some really nice ones - https://twitter.com/faery__
---
He's like Panda in like he's very lighthearted and wholesome, just plays for fun, but unlike Panda he's very chill (Panda makes me nervous some times). His stream is great if you just want to relax.
---
I'd throw my money at that.
---
I was expecting to hate the first season but ended up loving the show, still can’t believe we’ll never see those characters again or get any closure on the cliffhangers
---
I didn't even noticed the Endgame collapse was on lol I am fucking blind...
---
Selfcare is a crutch perk! Are you stupid? Geezz triggered much little guy.  
---
I find it counter productive to run two healing perks such as selfcare and botany... I need things that will help me in chase, help me if i get tunneled or idk something to help get gens done faster. Not 2 perks to heal.. it's a waste in my eyes..
---
I feel like the balance is better on consoles. A better balance between killers and survivors. Not quite sure on that though, so dont take my word on it
---
*Hor diggity damn*

When people can count on their teammates to actually be helpful

*bitches about people bitching*

*bitches when people point out the hypocrisy*

I love the internet.
---
Good to know I wasn't the only kid who was scared AF during that episode.
---
That actually sounds like a lot of fun. Maybe Ill do that actually. I have easily 250 hours on just her, I could do like an analysis of her perks and add ons and then like a list of suggested buffs and replacements kinda like yours. Thanks for the idea! Ill absolutely msg you if I take the time to put this together. I may want to wait to get more time playing her around endgame tho, pretty much every decent build with pig relies HEAVILY on mid to late game, so finding a new sweet spot for her is gonna be rough
---
It juat takes you out of deep wounds

Heals deep wounds but leaves you injured

I can only think of 2 episodes that scared me. This one and the one with the giant black and white floating head
---
This is great
---
I GET IT … MY TEAMMATE IS HOOKED. CAN YOU SPEED UP THE FUCKING DISTORTION ANINMATION SO I CAN SEE IF THE KILLER IS COMING DIRECTLY TOWARDS ME BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
---
we need a “The Shining” chapter with the overlook as the map
---
Thank you, someone with a response that actually references the movies I was talking about. Both excellent choices, and fuck Mrs.Loomis, that bitch only got one kill in Scream 2 and it was the homie Randy
---
Is no one going to mention that the devs said on the official forums that legion won't lose the entire bar of FF on a whiffed attack?
---
It really depends on the killers with DCs I feel. Either they focus one guy too hard for the solid kill or don't enact "Justice". Just today I got farmed by an Adam with the killer dead pan watching him do it, killer hits him, let's him unhook me then doesn't hit him twice and just hits me instead, I could totally see how that would get people to DC.
---
peak player satisfaction
---
Mm tasty salt, keep it coming
---
the killer can be the customers :)
---
It would be fine if people were just joking about it but it sounds like people actually want this stupid skin added to the game. Same with speedo Quentin. It’s so damn annoying. You can’t even bring up Myers skins that we could actually get because all the comments will be ‘blah blah shirtless Myers blah blah’
---
Hag is the most jumpscare. I don't think I have ever managed to not jump when activating her power.
---
She's pretty ugly underneath though isn't she? They didn't make her look anything like Shawnee Smith.
---
I like the idea that you could always do this shove. I know I've raced other survivors to the door to see who could get the points from opening it. If it alerted the killer when it happened it could add a new and interesting mechanic to the game
---
Please please please please!!!!
---
Ok fucked myself thanks, feels good. You probably should too, to shake off the stress a lil bit
---
This is obviously a SWF team judging by the ranks. Seems more like a “our friend didn’t get in the lobby” or “our friend DC’d so let’s DC too”. Happens more often than you might think.
---
Yup, but that assumes I only heal self. Regardless of me taking dmg, I’ll still prioritize gens a lot of times as I am comfortable in my ability to loop killers. If I am in a poor position and can’t do anything useful/get healed, I’ll take the time to heal up, and if one of my teammates are death hooked or whatever, I can once again get the killers attention. Self care is just an option :)
---
Had a killer down my friend (who was the last Survivor alive), close the hatch in front of them, and just wait for them to die to the Entity. They bled out a literal second before the collapse. Haha. He was so pissed.
---
It never was.
---
Probably a byproduct of the month it was free then. I'm glad to be on a platform with minimal queue times.
---
Full rework mind you.
---
says it was only reworked on the basement stairs
---
I think they should keep it like this, but with 2 extra features.
---
So the new new left behind should be
---
1. You get a audio cue when the killer gets within 8/12/16 meters of the hatch for the first time. Whenever the killer is 8/12/16 meters within the hatch, you see their aura. You see the killer's aura for 3/4/5 seconds after leaving the "hatch radius".
---
2.One of the two exit gates' aura and noise bubble will not be shown to the killer unless you open that "hidden" exit gate. You will not know which exit gate is not shown to the killer. This effect only works if the killer closes hatch(this feature is only at level 3 of this perk)
---
3. You get a 75% increase to gen repair speed for every gen remaining.
---
My experience is the opposite which sucks because I have more cosmetics on console
---
Why would it be toxic in the first place?
---
To be completely fair they are meant to stall out the game before you get to late game. Having two minutes to RNG on boxes is far too long to be fair.
---
I mean halloween is owned by saws company
---
I'm a fan of the stealth killers so I can jumpscare the fuck outa people.  
---
Clapper + Ghost Soot Wraith, Monitor &amp; Dead Rabbit or Scratched Mirror Myers &amp; Piggy with Monitor &amp; Whispers to easily sneak up on people. :)  
---
Cant wait for Ghost Face, he sounds great!
---
What does DS stand for?
---
I'd also like to see a a mine. Like a coal mine and stuff like that
---
Your tag is misleading me of if this is an r/woooosh or not....
---
I'm glad I brung my friend to help me..
---
And the survivor could be the manager trying to escape the wrath of Karen!
---
Before taking a break from the game, I got to rank 2 just playing casually and not super sweaty. Took a 6 ish month break, and this is day 4 casually playing again (super hectic schedule), and currently rotating games with gf. Rank 11 atm which is whatever, but it will quickly go up again. Just needs a day to sit down to grind, but at the same time, it’s not seeing a lot of different killers than billy most games :p we both nurses, recently adopted a puppy, so the time is limited, but even at red ranks, I still see bad ppl man
---
Cleanse dulls the moment you see the and ask ur team pre-game to do so as well... if everyone would just quickly cleanse all dulls when they walk past them NOED wouldnt nearly be as much of an issues as people make it to be.
---
All of these in order, as killer  
---
if you know you've lost a chase as a survivor, and bow to the killer, I will down you and leave you  
---
if you do not wiggle while I carry you, I will hook you once. If I down you again, and you still dont wiggle, I will leave you there and farm after with you  
---
If you farm with me, I give you hatch or door, depending on how many are cool  
---
If you run from me after we are clearly farming, you get one chance, then I kill you  
---
If you teabag or try to be actively toxic, **I WILL DRAG YOU THROUGH THE GATES OF HELL AND WATCH YOU BURN**  
---
(no that does not mean camping,  but still, fuck that guy)
---
Just curious, are you on xbox?
---
They could make that the escape.
---
PS4
---
Have you actually watched the show? I thought I would hate it when watching the trailers and ended up really liking it
---
Survivors already troll each other enough by setting off alerts. I've seen survivors alert the killer because I won't heal them, or because I was searching a chest and they wanted to do it. 
---
I see no reason to give the killer ANOTHER alert on where survivors are, especially if it's only happening because one survivor is being a douche.
---
I don’t blame em it’s a legion with franks mix tape
---
No Mither?
---
Ok. That's actual going to be a nice update for a lot of survivors.
---
I'm responding to the "lol just leave" post, I know the killer didn't have NOED in this particular situation.
---
Just harder to pass certifications thru on occasion lol
---
This happened to me earlier today. A David was slugged and bleeding out I was a smol quentin trying my hardest... I spend the last couple of moments holding his hand before my ultimate demise. It destroyed my heart to be unable to help him :’(
---
I don't think they will PTB. They haven't done that for ANY OTHER licensed killer yet right?  Like why bother?
---
Maybe it's to avoid Legion but part of me hopes it comes out faster than that.
---
You should have thrown gas at them while they wait to die.
---
the entity at its best.
---
Doubt this guy is from the new season, they specifically rebooted it just to make it ‘less white’ (real quote, eye roll)
---
ah ok thanks!
---
Not everyone uses insidious to camp
---
Decisive Strike.  Laurie Strode perk.
---
Dick shit
---
They can’t ban you for mlga. It does not interact with the game at all, only steam. That’s like banning a player for using reddit while the game is open.
---
Dwight stache 
---
You didn't know?
---
Sleathy is a perfectly good and fun way to play, tips I have:
---
1. Urban evasion from Nea is a staple stealth park
---
2. Sometimes hiding in plain sight works. Killer will constantly walk by me since I don't Sprint away one o hear the heartbeat
---
3. Don't be afraid of the heartbeat! Roo many neepeople run from it and get caught, the killer might be nearby but it doesn't mean they're after you
---
4. Always, always always have an escape route planned. If you're doing a gen plan on where you're going to hide/where the nearest pallet is so you don't run into the open
---
5. Keep your head on a pivot when fixing gens, you can alot out the Shape, Pig and Wraith if you keep turning your camera to see them
---
It took a good amount of time to find Billy haha
---
This isn’t because of the end game collapse though. If your entire team DC’d that soon into the game you’d likely have died anyway because the hatch wouldn’t have spawned and it’s virtually impossible to complete 2 gens without the killer catching you.
---
How is he acting like a cunt? You just started getting aggressive out of nowhere
---
That’s why context matters. If the game is going normally and everyone DCs simultaneously, then it’s not a super coordinated event. It’s the killer being DCed
---
The point is you CAN fuck it up. Like by design it is supposed to be awkward. A good player will rarely fuck it up, but it happens, like a skill check, but something you have to do actively
---
I got accused mainly by 10 year olds that don’t know any better don’t worry.
---
That's my girl 😊.
---
I mean the hatch goes to whoever finds it first sadly. They can’t pull you out anymore so Atleast theres that. As a Survivor main I am happy with the change and it makes it feel more rewarding to find the hatch.
---
Yeah theres a lot boosted survivors in red rank I ageee
---
I don’t think they’ve had a licensed killer since they started doing regular PTB’s though, they started that with Clown chapter
---
I would love it! Some more indoors maps would be great!
---
Probably not I tried playing on a dell laptop and on lowest settings it was still hard to play its a decent laptop to not really for gaming but it has a decent graphics card and ram
---
The only thing about this some may say is toxic is the teabag... but the legion was being a bit of a dick too it looks like though so fairplay all around.
---
That was a god level save play.
---
Being in the chase. Palms are sweaty. Myers Evil Within 3. You dead hard into the elevator. Door closes
---
[this plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy_NKN75Jhw)
---
Who knew closing something could be so badass

Eh, that's why Id say add another minute to ninety seconds. People want them off BEFORE the exit gate is active as is, because if the pig finds them with them on, they are pretty fucked. Now, they just need to get to the door. Honestly, in a decent swf, if we had 2 gens left, Id completely ignore it. I would feel safe enough to get the gens done with it on, which quite frankly, defeats the entire purpose
---
Ive had this happen to me a couple of times as well as to randoms about 4 times. No prompt to heal and if they dont have SC rhey are screwed. Also had an audio glitch that sounded like the egc timer starting but non stop a whole game. It was bad I could nt hear anything else even the killers TR
---
Survivors can still get the hatch? They can even get it if they didn't manage to do a single gen. The killer can close the hatch, but then all gens get done and the gates are powered, right?
---
To add to this i had a bug where my gen wouldnt progress gor avout 15 seconds idk what made it statt to progress but i was using a toolbox and losing no charges and the bar didnt move at all
---
No worries! Sometimes it's hard to read what tone the other person means to type in, my bad dude! Haha he's a chill bing bong boi, we should all take a page from his book 🤣
---
The killer can take the stairs, while the elevator will be slow.
---
Being presumptuous by claiming I've not read any comments
---
"What. Of. It."
---
Yeah, definitely not acting like a cunt.
---
Do the gens or suffer my curse

No I healed her earlier in the game, I have been playing this game 2 years, I know what no mither is
---
I mean you and me can be so why can't other people. It is not like this is gonna be a prominent issue.
---
It won’t work natively on your Mac but you can check out these things:
---
Apple Bootcamp: https://support.apple.com/boot-camp this installs windows alongside Mac OS but still uses your Mac hardware to play the game.
---
NVidia Gefore Now: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/geforce-now/ Works by streaming the game from a server to your Mac. Since this is streaming the only thing your Mac is doing is decoding the stream. No powerful hardware needed since the remote server handles everything. It is currently free in beta but there is a waitlist so be prepared for that.
---
If you go with the first option make sure your Mac is powerful enough. Which Mac do you have exactly?
---
Oh wow, because one person plays the game how it’s supposed to be played means everyone will. Makes so much sense
---
Idk, some of the most fun I've ever had during this game was during the blight event; an event which awarded people for being selfish. It made the game scarier, I felt like I truly could not trust anyone, which made the entire event more enjoyable. I like the idea that the survivors are just that, survivors. They aren't teammates, or coworkers. These are people who need to do whatever it takes to get out alive. At the end of the day, all that matters is your own life, because...  
---
*Death is not an escape*
---
BoLd Of YoU to lie to us. If you don't tunnel, then don't bitch about DS, as you should have no problem with it, as the survivors wasted a perk slot.
---
After you miss a skill check with no ruin or lullaby "pls be patient I'm autistic"
---
So, I think we can all agree that trapper is S++ tier after this update yeah?
---
Happened to me as well, me and  jake were trying to heal meg and there was no prompt. I think she thought we were being jerks about it.
---
yes...
---
No, DBD doesn’t support macOS. At least it didn’t this past winter when I tried to download it to my bf’s MacBook.
---
Gameplay wise, it's freddy. I find his power works really well with his I play because it provides good information.
---
Lore wise, look wise, it's legion. I like their edge, and they just feel like killers to me.
---
holy fuck that probably took ages
---
Until Ghostface reveals himself as a good killer that doesn't bypass logic or has copyright issues where customization is beyond the grave you can't ask who has the last laugh when we don't know if we will be balling our eyes out when we figure out he is gonna turn out to be another Freddy or worse he creates a whole new name for himself. If he does  turn into complete shit then whoever you suggest that was bashed that speculated the next killer will be Ghostface will also be more of an idiot. If the opposite becomes true no one will care. Deal with it.
---
WHY WONT I LEARN HOW TO 360 EVEN ONCE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE OVER 400 HOURS AND BEEN SITTING ON RANK 1-5 FOR HALF A YEAR
---
fuck she can't be used as a distraction anymore
---
I actually like DS, as a killer.
---
If I want to hook the obsession, I'll re-down someone that I suspect has DS, and let them be the new obsession.
---
The best way I can respond to this is by refuting the claim "YOU COULD BE DOING GENS INSTEAD OF SELF CARE"
---
Chances are, I've already finished a gen or two by the time I actually do get hit. Therefore, if my other teammates are also doing gens, that leaves us with 1 - 2 gens remaining. We have 4 teammates, we can spread the responsibility around. Also, Nurse's Calling is a very powerful perk that is almost expected of the killer to have at the top ranks. If someone is healing me, our position will be given away leading to me getting downed and the killer chasing my teammate to down him as well. I'd rather the killer chase me only. Also, if you do bring a med-kit, that shit will heal faster and last longer. Against killers that like to slow the game down [jus a little bit] such as Freddy or Legion, having self-care + medkit can be an extreme life-saver.
---
Right now, the 4 combo perks that I run as a rank 3 survivor are 1) Adrenaline 2) Self-care / Iron will 3) Balanced Landing / Dead Hard 4) Spine Chill. 
---
I have had a lot of success with self-care and continue to have success with it because people focus on the single aspect of it that's negative which is 'YOU COULD BE DOING GENS'. Yes, I could also be doing gens when I'm healing someone or breaking a hex totem or hiding in a locker to avoid BBQ-Chil, but other things take priority. If I go down, that's worse than me spending less than half of the time it would take to rescue me into healing myself.
---
It's meta for a reason, because it's damn good
---
What if when hes crouched you hear the buzzing of his phone every 15 seconds or so instead of nothing
---
I think the 3rd one should be “people saying the ghost is an original killer because they only got the mask rights”
---
I googled. They recycle.
---
Happened to me twice
---
I’m trying to highlight my add ons and offering more... but sure.
---
Lol we're WaAAaAaAaAaAaAay past thaAaAaaaaAaAaAaAat
---
Every time I get in a lobby with four people with items, either the killer dodges or I lose my shit to Franklin’s.
---
Lol ok
---
What just came out? The last map wasn’t even a brand new map, Temple was just a variation of Red Forest. There are plenty of maps that only have variant that a second version would be welcomed. Lery’s, The Game, Ormond, Yamoka Estate And some others too.
---
Petition to bring back first person Moris please for the love of god
---
No goddamn shapeshifting. There's a reason we don't have a Pennywise killer. The current state of the game doesn't lend itself well to something like that.
---
The Ghostface fan chapter was good, but I didn't want to call survivors on their magical cell phones. Ghost having a cell phone selfie in his mori is good enpugh.
---
Incorrect.
---
I have an issue with a perk that is a literal jail out of free card, feel free to browse my post history i have been vocally against DS ever since it was released.
---
I play primarily survivor and only really play killer for daily's.
---
This must be the sign. The new leaked killer must be Nea posessed by the Entity
---
How is it unfair to the killer? The game is literally over, the killer has won + they get to see the new entity stab death animation. If you are the last person alive and you are slugged there is a 99% chance you will die unless the killer lets you live. There is literally no point of having the timer tick down as incredibly slow as it does when the last survivor is slugged. It makes no sense.

KID YOU CAN REMOVE NOED FROM THE KILLERS INVENTORY WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRUTCH? YOU CANT REMOVE METTLE OF MAN, DEAD HARD, SPRINT BURST, OR ADRENALINE FROM SURVIVORS INVENTORY.
---
If there are no BPs to be gained in unranked mode, it'll be dead on arrival. No one will play a game with no rank/BP benefits.
---
If there playing casual mode will give players BPs, you'll get even more tryhards and trolls, because there'll be nothing to stop them from ruining other's fun.
---
Except Altruism is a big part of the game. In fact, 1/4 of the survivors points COMES from Altruism. You get points for helping other survivors, healing them, working with them, blocking hits for them, distracting the killer for them, and saving them. So no, that logic doesn't apply. This IS a 1v4 game, and survivors are SUPPOSED to work together. 
---
One survivor is not SUPPOSED to stand in front of the gate lever and keep others from leaving. It doesn't benefit their points in any way. It's just being a piece of shit.

As a survivor main, I'm not. My survival is now based on how good my entire team is.
---
Users here used to complain about rushing the hook. Now I have to to keep myself alive. I literally had this happen last game where I Lithe over a window to unhook a Deng from a camping Myers. He killed me by downing me and not letting anyone near. The entity killed me
---
Didn't think I could ever leave Nurse for any killer besides Spirit, but my hype for Ghostface has reminded me of how fun this game can be when you really enjoy a killer. I cant wait to get my hands on him
---
Ability could rig generators somehow or mess with progression (he was a mechanic after all)
---
Perks could be based on messing with repairs or pallets.
---
agh, sorry, was a rare cosmetic issue certain cosmetics disable them
---
Window blockers spawn when a survivor **who is in a chase** vaults a window three times in a short period of time. Visually it'll appear for the killer regardless, but sometimes it does get blocked on the survivor's end.
---
"You shall not pass!"
---
100% yes. Stealth killers are so much more fun.
---
Personally I prefer passive perks that give information for you to make more informed decisions so that you can avoid making mistakes, but pretty much anything is better than just basically getting rewarded for screwing up or punishing the killer for playing the game (*cough MoM cough*)
---
THESE ARE ALL INDOOR MAPS, AND FUCKING EVERYONE HATES INDOOR MAPS!

Did OP privately message you to include they all DC'd at the same time or are we just assuming? I think people downvote for assuming
---
What’s your favorite Courage the Cowardly Dog episode, Sidney?
---
&gt;I have an issue with a perk that is a literal jail out of free card
---
Against incompetent killers yeahAgainst killers who are decent, its a chase extender. It's even less of an issue considering its on a timer that you can just slug the survivor so it gets wasted, it's literally an anti tunnel perk, if you're still complaining about it, then that's a problem
---
I'd fucking die if they dropped a OG Freddy cosmetic complete w/ voicelines from Robert Englund. I would gladly dropped several bucks on that.
---
Your personal experience and random people calling him The Scream isn't a good indication though. On the actual wikis and information DBs that have Ghostface have no indications of him having any alias aside from Father Death and The Icon of Halloween. As a result, it was very unlikely from the beginning that he would have been called "The Scream".
---
I see no Frank's Mix Tape, and even then this is most likely new Legion.
---
I mean, I asked haha. OP didn’t reply. Not sure why that means I get downvoted
---
Yeah it was frustrating, I messaged her telling I was sorry but just couldn't heal her 😞
---
It’s definitely shifted the balance massively in favour of killers. I had one survivor escape through the gates earlier after I closed the hatch, but it was on Gideon’s with the hatch obviously downstairs and the gates on opposite ends of the map upstairs. With most other maps and/or Nurse it would’ve been game over.
---
Tried to stomp a pallet at work the way susie does and broke my ankle real bad :( I’m trying to sue BHVR and also Canada but I’m illiterate
---
IM SO SICK OF NOED.
---
I USED TO BE OKAY WITH IT ACTIVATING WHEN ALL GENS WERE READY, BECAUSE SURVIVORS HAD ENOUGH TIME TO CLEAN TOTEMS.
---
BUT NOW WITH THE ENDGAME COLLAPSE? BULLSHIT. ITS ALREADY HARD ENOUGH TO OPEN THE DOORS WHEN YOU ARE THE LAST ONE AND ON A TIMER. BEING ONE-SHOTED FOR FREE IS BULLSHIT.
---
AND KILLER MAINS DONT COME TO ME SAYING THERE'S STILL TIME TO DO TOTEMS. SOLO SURVS ALREADY HAVE IT HARD ENOUGH.
---
r/MyPeopleNeed
---
LMAO this is just too perfect
---
They die of aids.
---
If the killer can't block you then you can't block them, the killer will just walk through you to get to them.
---
If they do the Haddonfield hospital I will cry tears of joy
---
You dont have to be a furry to appreciate  that. Have you seen Total recall? This sounds twice as fun.
---
Oh I love this so much. Watching this physically made me feel good like
---
the doors get powered. but get ready at least on ps4 I noticed a lot of toxic killers since this update
---
Yes please, Behavioral make this happen!
---
Good god it's amazing
---
Happening to me on Xbox one as well
---
The doors are powered when the hatch is closed.
---
I sincerely doubt she would have been on par with the Nurse, or even Hillbilly. I’m not even sure I believe her kill rate would have jumped up that much. 
---
Either way, they removed her endgame counter play and gave her nothing to compensate for it. There’s no arguing that she isn’t weaker than where she was before. 😞
---
OH, okay that makes sense. Thank you!
---
You can't walk through people, you just can't block the whole stairway, they can just squeeze past you.
---
I’ve been trying very hard to get rid of the sprint burst stigma by using it to save teammates quickly off the hook. I usually don’t use it in chases anymore because it’s not as good as lithe or balanced but I like to use it anyways
---
Sometimes there will be no heal prompt nor will there be a wake up prompt if you're facing Freddy. That's always fun. Lol
---
The entity was Reagan all along
---
There is no way for them to activate if all generators are done anyway, unless you mean they won‘t activate on the last gen being done.
---
Oof I mixed up franks mic tape and cold dirt my bad. But legion still isn’t that fun to go against but I do agree about the not losing add ons when people dc
---
Got mine today thank you sooooo much!!!
---
I rarely ever tbag killers, the only time I ever do it is when I got tunnelled or camped and I escape. I’m a survivor main and I hate when I see teammates tbagging at pallets and waiting at the exit gate to tbag.

Chainsaw and boomstick curtesy of hillbilly
---
Her killer ability is being able to fly over the map and hurl lightning bolts at survivors
---
Agree to disagree.
---
Or actually balance it instead of just removing the mechanic altogether. Or buff her elsewhere to compensate for her loss of counter play. This is just sheer lazy incompetence on the part of the devs.
---
Why even play this game if you're just gonna DC against some of the most popular killers to play?
---
Prestiging tour characters feels even worse... Especially once you have all the teachables in the game... That's what I'm going through rn
---
I think a better solution to make endgame collapse more fun would be to give survivors more options to escape the match; add random hidden key spawns once the egc begins that survivors can find to open the hatch or new items that can increase the speed of opening door etc. It would add some interesting dynamics to the game and make the endgame feel more fair to the survivor. As you said after the latest update it's basically just whoever finds the hatch first wins (which is the killer 90% of the time). If the gates are super close to each other it's straight up impossible for the survivor to escape, because the killer can just walk inbetween the gates in a matter of seconds.
---
Overall I think the endgame collapse is a really cool concept but it could use some tweaks to make it feel more fair to the survivor. One thing they should consider is looking at the gate spawns to make them at least not spawn within viewing distance of each other like they can on some maps.
---
TL;DR
---
I'm sorry, but I think patrolling the door is allowed
---
Well everyone needs to start and or lead by example..  be they change
---
*Shotgun* tho.
---
Could have something to do with the licensing issue. I know the copy right for the mask is owned by a separate guy then the movie, maybe they didn't get the green light until recently and made up their own version too fill the gap
---
Wat
---
Plz don’t ever be in my games
---
Now that you mention it.
---
First DS, then legion, now this. Gen rushing seems to be the only way to increase your chances of winning. You could still do 3 gens by yourself and die to the entity, unfortunately..
---
16 seconds animation mori, but who cares? It looks damn cool.
---
The fuck
---
D STRIKE IS A PRETTY GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO THAT
---
I played her all day and didn’t really see much difference I might be wrong though
---
Anyone think that nurse is balanced considering how hard it is to play her ?
---
Yeah im pretty ass at taking photos, thanks for the tip.
---
Why 99% it? To let someone else get the daily? To not start the collapse? If you want the collapse to start then open the door as killer. Am I missing something?
---
So what your saying is they need to remove the scourge known as SWF then all will be right in the realm ;)
---
I'm not it isn't. Before the update, it was perfectly fine. Now it's an almost guaranteed win. Super OP, worse than pre-nerf DS
---
I hate how they changed their hatch overall to be honest.
---
Ash is not jonathan joestar
---
Spine chill completely changed my survivor game and now I hurt so bad when playing an unleveled character without it. XD
---
Endgame collapse begins when either hatch is closed or door is opened by rigger survivor or killer. 
---
Assuming a teammate dies and a last survivor is standing, and the killer finds and closes hatch or either opens a door, the endgame will activate.
---
If the killer opens door, it's just normal, survivor must make a run for it or open the other door (or hatch if just 1 survivor).
---
I haven't seen the video in a while but I'm pretty certain if the hatch is closed both doors open?
---
Endgame should not have the option to trap the last survivor by blocking gens with hatch closed.
---
PS: I just remembered, another option that comes to mind would be this scenario: Last survivor, hatch is closed with 2 gens left, generators will get blocked but you now have access to open doors regardless of gens done.
---
ToTeMs ArE tO hArD tO fInD
---
*50 maps unused in inventory*
---
Why wouldn't it be a legit thing to do? Blood warden will be used more often now. The killer can open the gate if they really want to anyway.
---
Looks just like an average match making queue to me
---
I think Monitor is super necessary. I like to use it with the add-on that reduces the terror radius of EW2 so then even at EW2 you’re still super sneaky. It does have the drawback of increasing the terror radius of EW3 but by the time you’re in EW3 it doesn’t matter much anyway. I normally only use EW3 when I’m breathing down a survivor’s neck anyway. I think Enduring, M&amp;A, Overcharge and say Surveillance is a great way to balance Myers with the right add-ons and it makes a build that is terrifying to go against. Obviously you can substitute Surveillance or Overcharge for Ruin or BBQ but I don’t find those super necessary.
---
Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Bond, and currently WGLF in the last spot as I farm up the points to finish getting all the perks I own maxed out on Ash. After that is done, probably will switch to Mettle or Urban.
---
Yes sneaky killers!!!! My most fun matches are against Michael and Amanda. Michael being the most fun. His add on's can make for extremely nerve racking games. Spooky myers on Lerys is quite the adrenaline rush. Hoping for the same types of rush with Ghostface!
---
They're big mad about my opinions..  selfcaring loving fools.  It's all good.
---
He blends in a little too well
---
I came 3 times. Once at the rope scene, shirtless Myers, then pantsless Myers. Oh my!
---
Thank you! This is why reddit is a blessed place
---
This is why huntress is my favorite killer
---
They would need to make it bigger in my opinion
---
pills here
---
ecksdeedee
---
How are you saying self care is a crutch perk when you run EVERY META PERK  god what is wrong with you lol
---
I've  seen something here where that happened to someone too, don't remember the post tho.
---
I'd love it if they did chapter expansions for licensed DLCs. Potentially giving us maps like the Sawyer farmhouse, Elm Street, Laurie's house, etc.
---
She went straight from the survivor to the hatch, like she knew where it was.
---
She just slaps it with her hand. She used to have her pallet animation as her close animation and it looked cooler :(
---
I do
---
We need more Mulaney memes in our lives.

Yeah the did a video on the music featuring real grill sounds...
---
Nobody knows just parody ghostface. He was only in like 1 of those movies. The scream movies are way more popular there is no way that scary movie was your only time seeing ghostface.
---
Oh my no. No thank you!
---
HE TOOK A SELFIE I AM DECEASED
---
AYAYAYAYA!
---
IS THIS A PIG OR A HUHNTRESS
---
Yup you close the hatch and it starts a 2 minute timer for the last survivor(s) to gtfo or be sacrificed. Same thing happens if someone opens a gate after the gens are done
---
Oh my god.
---
Fucking RIP.
---
That sucks. :/ Hope you get a satisfying response soon
---
This could have been another great map for the Legion update
---
YES PLEASEEEE
---
It is!
---
It’s no more toxic than camping. Both punish the player by rewarding less bloodpoints and pups. You need to work on 3 gens in order to get iridescent medal. Just like you need to hook 9 times or stay at least 16m away from a hook. 
---
They have already implemented a self correcting punishment for this stuff in terms of deranking players that do it.
---
I understand why it won’t work though because of the obvious range chat giving away survivor locations and such
---
I would DC out of every game with the skin 100% of the time.
---
Good job.
---
Which isnt fair! Because killer can run freely with no worries while as survivor you gotta be sneaky while try to find the hatch..  update is completely utterly killer sided likw every other up date in the last 6 to 8 months
---
Nerve gas house. Will that include the needle pit
---
#Wrong!
---
*Also, you are being downvoted because you don't know how to read the score screen.
---
The killer has a score, which is conclusive evidence that they did not DC. Players forfeit all points then they leave a match prematurely.
---
You jumped on the OP and cast the blame on them, while feasting on your own foot.
---
All i want is the 2018 Myers :&gt;
---
If they could somehow create a creepy and eerie atmosphere then definitely. However if not I feel it wouldn't be too different to the Game.
---
I dont know why im getting downvoted, haddonfield and lerys are terribly designed maps, haddonfield could have been good if they prioritized the mechanics and the gameplay aspects over the appearance of the map. The game is a map that is hated by some but its not as bad as the other two. Having more maps like those i mentioned would not ne healthy for the game IMO
---
Survivors cant see auras too. Theres basically a permanent knock out filter on this map, its miserable.
---
Yeah but if you're using yellow mori and hatch is in play, if they find it you've got to queue another match as nurse
---
You hurt me.
---
Yes because my 1000/1000 internet causes individuals to DC one person and then another one and then another one 15 seconds or so apart. 
---
Sorry for sounding so condescending and like a bitch but I don't like it when they assume my internet is that of a Russian living in a hut in Siberia
---
I could see that being a really funny option to add in KYF.
---
The concept is poor offering design, just like old Decisive Strike was poor perk design. To me, it's really that simple.
---
And I love moris as much as everyone else. Pink mories on the other hand? They are just a cheap way to get an easy win.
---
You know, I came here to read the comments on this thread because I know people have opinions on SC. After the big nerf I didn’t run it for awhile myself.  But I put it back in my build because 1) You can pretend you don’t have it. Let those survivors heal you! Much faster (that’s your argument right?) and 9/10 times yeah I’m most likely not healing myself.  But I prefer to bring in flashlights and toolboxes so I’m not bringing a medkit every damn game. Especially when I run MoM and that medkit gets hit with franklins. 
---
2) I didn’t expect you to ARGUE with every person here who didn’t agree with you. You asked for opinions, and those who gave it to you, are wrong?  That’s not how it works. You got downvoted to shreds because of your lack of mature conversation. 
---
No one gives a flying fuck if you run self care or not honestly.  Whatever helps you best and you enjoy so you can have FUN in the game. I’m not trying to be stressed when I need to be healed and don’t have it. 
---
I know for a fact you’ve lost more games than you can count because if you only were healed... hmm
---
He was able, but he was just watching the Dwight suffer
---
I am just curious if anyone knows, why do I have to wait 9 minutes to reply to comments on my own post in this subreddit? This is the only one where there is any kinda of timeout like this.
---
Nice OC mate, creative too,  this is a really refreshing post to wake up to.
---
Definitely know how to read... 
---
This is a common thing that happens and the end of match scoreboard looks exactly the same. 
---
Never once did I say OP left the game. This happens when there is an error with the host’s connection.
---
Now with longer queue times!
---
If you find the hatch first, you instantly win.
---
If the Killer finds the hatch first, you get 2 minutes to open the door.
---
the teabag
---
You had me, and lost me with the teabag... cmon...
---
They only have the rights to the ghostface mask. The chapter won't be scream related.
---
Ohh sorry, did not know as I typically don't post here as much as I brows this subreddit.
---
Those were some great hatchet throws. I wouldn't even be mad if I was on the receiving end. Okay... maybe just a bit.
---
Imagine trying to escape leatherface using it and he makes it in with you 😂
---
Ninja edit: oh man or tombstone+smelly hair myers just milking every last drop of EW you for free lol.
---
And since they made a David body pillow it’s very much within the realm of possibility
---
Wasn't the EGC timer three minutes previously? Did they give a statement on why it was reduced to two minutes?

I've had to change my playstyle completely to win. I use to run just alert,bl,bond, and adrenaline.. but I tested out the good perks and I dont call them crutch I call it my second chance build. Because I of the tunneling and camping ds and borrowed time is needed, dead hard gets me through that pallet I would've been hit under. Adrenaline is my award for making it to the end. Mom is new and exciting
---
I would love a meta change for this game. Its the same old nurse numero uno for too long. I dont think hes gonna be better than her, with that description of his powers its not possible... but like a 2nd or 3rd place would be sooo cool.
---
Lmao then I put pressure on survivors and y’all cry about that. “Wahhhhhh he’s tunneling me!!!” “Wahhhhhhh he didn’t respect the pallet!!!!” “Wahhhhh he didn’t look the other way and let me unhook and instant heal another survivor!!!”
---
Y’all got more excuses then you do skill.
---
Funny you should say that.
---
Just got out of a match where the last survivor was standing on a hill and decided to start tea-bagging me. One very short chase later (their teammates decided to break 90% of the pallets early on) and I had him on the ground and tea-bagged him back.
---
It was glorious.
---
i'm really late to the party, so you'll be the one one that sees this.
---
you're right that Pyramid Head is slow, but not always. It seems to only be this way when he's using the Great Knife. He is really fast in the basement of alchemilla hospital when he's chasing James and Maria with the spear. 
---
otherwise i agree with everything you said. cheers!
---
Seriously, I don't get it lol Its such a joy getting into one of those games after you sat in que for more than 5 minutes. I dont mind green and yellows either
---
ME neither, but I assume they didn't remove all collision, that wouldn't make sense, they probably just made it wider.
---
When I run this build it takes about a minute or two into the match before 2-3 survivors dc usually
---
That is why I said to put him in the middle...
---
Okay. Sure.
---
Dude.... How... I can't hit someone standing in front of me with huntress
---
So is this a perk or an offering? Or is it something any killer can do now?
---
Or WAAAAAAAAZZZZZZAAAAAAAAHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUP
---
The issue here is that they won't make new textures for stuff. Something that the plague map showed, they just slap poorly made stuff on preset maps.
---
WHOSE FUCKING BRIGHT IDEA WAS THAT ENDGAME BULLSHIT?
---
TODAY SOME ASSSHAT HILLBILLY KILLS 3 OF US AND ONLY THE LAST FUCKER SURVIVES IN A LOCKER. THEN THE KILLER CLOSES THE HATCH. GATES ARE AS CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AS MOSQUITO BALLS ARE CLOSE TO MOSQUITO DICK.
---
WELL, GUESS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT. HE CAMPS THE GATES, RIGHT. FUN GAMEPLAY.
---
LEGION IS STILL THE SAME UNFUN TUNNEL NO FUN ALLOWED KILLER, THEY JUST GO ABOUT IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY NOW. IT'S ALMOST LIKE IGNORING THE FEW TOOLS THE SURVIVORS HAVE TO EVADE THE KILLER IS KINDA BUSTED. TOTAL REWORK WHEN?
---
They need to make his default coat more black... like total pitch black
---
Any killer. Its the Endgame Collapse. Its mainly to prevent survivors from holding the game hostage. The killer can even open the exit gate themselves if the collapse hasnt started yet.
---
Holy fuck someone call glenOck over here
---
Pretty sure they didn’t get the movie rights. Right now it looks like they only got the mask. But that idea would be welcomed.
---
Well, it doesn't balance the knife at all, it just pushes it in the middle, which helps nurse stay on there
---
That could make it more fair but it doesnt make sense for it to count towards sacrifice points when the entity didnt kill you.
---
Idk but I’ve been blocked in a corner and trying to wiggle out just to be blocked again too many times
---
This is amazing.
---
They should give the Plague her own map set like literally every other killer instead of giving her 1 map on Huntress’ land.
---
Nea trying to control her entity self
---
Ditto can be anything you want ;)
---
I've been anticipating this for a while, glad to see it kicking off! Hope it gathers steam within the community, cos you're onto something here.
---
Absolutely loving the feeling. I haven’t played much pig but surely there are add ons which make the teabag faster 🤔
---
Who's laughing now bitches!?
---
r/wholesomedbd
---
Any changed you would suggest?
---
That's just the opposite of the 10,000 year old dragon girl loophole though.
---
New season is planned to be in Atlanta, and the cast list makes no mention of an "Olsen". I'm stumped.
---
Pudding is better than cake : )
---
OH MY GOD NO WAY
---
Yea so why haven't they even thought about changing it? They made it impossible to pip with a pink mori instead of changing the offering itself. To me it seems like they think its balanced for some reason.
---
So let’s start by saying you have no valid input in sex since your still a virgin obviously
---
THE FUCKING TIMING. Oh my god
---
Combat Straps is pretty epic tbh
---
Your right but I was just pointing such out
---
What are these country code names? Need some lore in my life.
---
i dont know, i think you should tell him
---
Stop feeding the troll mate. /u/swampstix79 is just a neckbeard who gets off on pissing people off.
---
I’m talking lore wise Amanda made traps that were deadly but not escapable like normal if the trap doesn’t work like that in game then ok
---
Such a cute bunny mama! You can throw a hatchet at me any time
---
"ugh, Peggy on the 4th floor never brushes her teeth"
---
Are you also the same guy on PC who told us that struggling on hook at the end of the match would get you on this "list" because it was wasting your time?
---
My current build is bond, WGLF, borrowed time and lithe. I would swap WGLF with iron will buy I really like jeffs injured noises for some reason
---
I've found tutorials on how to make your mouse pointer the one in dbd. It's nice to be able to get the icons and images direct from the game.
---
Dude
---
You can't hide from the spirit if you're opening the door. Even with spine chill, she's not stupid, she sees the big "IM RIGHT HERE" red light on the door. Chances are the timer is at 70% by the time you stop. She either has to search the immediate 5x5 metres you snuck away to or stand at the door handle to ensure you're not opening it.
---
That had to gut them because they added ghost face. It’s better to gut them theirselves than have ghostface do it instead
---
&gt;challenge
---
Handicap. They added a handicap.
---
Fine I’ll do it.
---
OP that’s not what the Rock does. The Rock does basically nothing. ❤️
---
The map offering does though.

---
Thank you! I wanted to hold off on posting until I had everything but I liked this one too much.
---
Honestly you have a great idea here for both sides in my opinion. Well balanced and genuinely interesting.
---
Definitely
---
Since the Update I can't get him to say anything. 
---
Please tell me I'm not the only one who really wants this back?
---
Him and the legion have had the best so far omg
---
Dear killer,
---
The devs literally made it impossible for solo survivors to escape if their teammates suck.
---
Sincerely, I'll be waiting in the basement
---
Devs already confirmed Ghostface is coming so enjoy the hype :)
---
You can attempt escape.
---
I play on Xbox and they do jack shit
---
Every other game I get salty survs leaving - rep on me lol.  I love it!
---
If I’m the last survivor standing and I get hooked, even if it’s the first time, I go immediately into a temporary struggle then get instantly scarified.
---
They favored the killers way too much in this last update. They should make it so countdown stops when the hatch is closed, rather than starting it.
---
I've lost 7 out of 8 matches because the killer found the hatch first. Doors don't open fast enough.
---
&gt; Oxycrusher masks!
---
I think if we're being honest, *everybody* who watched that scene held their breath.
---
I've replaced it with bond since the new update. I went from getting chased by the killer to gen rushing just to compensate for the endgame.
---
god damnit
---
If you wanna make survivors paranoid you can just pick trapper or hag
---
Man these guys won't let me WALK
---
Makes the game really tense at least for me
---
I know thats like one of my favorite Medical Horrors tho.
---
Yea that's what I've been thinking about, just seeing that face peeking around a corner with no terror radius and then all of a sudden you have the exposed status affect...
---
Meta is an acronym for “Most Effective Tactic Available”. “””Generally””” the best things in no regards to fun
---
Not saying you can’t have fun with the best stuff, it’s just the best stuff.
---
lmao rip
---
Killer BMd too so it's fine this time
---
How can you be serious if it’s a shitpost lol
---
I have a collection of Mori's and they just sit there...doing nothing. They're boring to use as a killer in my opinion. A green one is whatever, I usually don't use em. I don't agree with making them only on last hook because then that'll encourage a full games worth of tunneling on survivors when I would rather just get the game over with if I'm a survivor versus being continually tunneled.
---
Ok thats one killer. You can hide from Hillbilly since hes super loud, Nurse doesnt blink to move around, Docotor if your smart you can, and every other kill you can too
---
...you did watch the same video as the rest of us right? Legion absolutely deserved it
---
Patience brothers
---
Love stealth killers since survivors will be more paranoid due to not knowing when the killer is near
---
Why would you thank them when I'm the original one who said it...?
---
Can this be a healthy love triangle with Queenie included? I think it would be better for all of us. That way it wont be awkward when you guys accept my job application in the future.
---
Killers complaining literally killed my fun as survivor. I'm really considering going killer main from now on, just because of the number of advantages they have now.
---
It's fine. If the killer wants to start the collapse then they have the option to go do so.
---
I was about to say that it would be a tight map, but they have the meat plant and Haddenfield so I guess it would work if it was more than the house. (Which it would be)
---
kinda reminds me of billy but instead of being a fast boi he shuts down loops? i like the perks but i don't think being able to destroy vaults should ever be a thing
---
This has happened to me before. Usually happens if my connection is iffy. Takes a few seconds to correct itself.
---
I prefer bond. It's more flexible and if your injured you can usually find someone to heal you. Plus you can just bring a medkit. But self care can definitely be useful, especially for solo
---
Clicked the wrong person. Oof. 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
no its not. the Timer is a joke.
---
unless you really want to die by the Endgame its not gonna happen
---
It's not just pressure though. If the killer finds the hatch first, it's game over. Doors are too slow to open that a patrolling killer has a guaranteed 4 man.
---
That really has nothing to do with what the question was and this can be countered with a key or perks
---
Alrighty. ALSO what if there was like a loading screen for the map where instead of the campfire, it would be in front of the gas station/butcher place with a van in front. Just like the beginning of the first film!
---
I agree, its extremely boring to use and play against. I only see bad killers enjoying it &amp; I guess you're right. I imagined the game would go normally and the killer would just mori once it got to that point but killers probably would still just tunnel anyway to ensure they get the mori but at least then it'd take longer to tunnle until the mori giving the other surviors a little more time to try to escape.
---
I mean yea its part of the game... its literally their job. Theres no need to be an ass. It hurts the community
---
Any sort of unique loading screens would be great tbh.
---
Can she grab people while crouched?
---
Yamaoka's Haunting - It just works
---
Hot
---
Oh, they did increase the door time huh. Well that's kinda RNG. The doors don't alway spawn close to eachother. Id say check chests and hope for a key if you're a solo survivor. 
---
I did lose a few matches yesterday when I played so its not impossible for survs to win. Not a guarantee I mean.
---
I’ll tell him...
---
pretty sure thats a steam thing
---
Freddy probably
---
How did they compensate?
---
i really hope that outfit is a placeholder/incomplete. it looks nothing like the movie other than the mask
---
The timer alerts every 25% just to let all players know that time is passing.
---
If the killer finds the hatch first, it's game over. Doors are too slow to open that a patrolling killer has a guaranteed 4 man. Why should I die cuz my team couldn't hide/ escape the killer? I'm being super altruistic, to the point where I'm fine with getting downed and hooked, just to ensure I'm not the only one left.
---
I just feel they could do a lot and there are many places from scream 1-4 that would be great. Even the mansion house in the last movie
---
I'd love if you mori'd someone against the wall as Myers he impales you to the wall before tilting his head and pulling out another knife.
---
From the patch notes: 
---
&gt;RBTs only become active whenever a generator is completed. Inactive RBTs will no longer trigger when attempting to leave via an exit gate. *NOTE: Initiating the End Game Collapse will not complete generators, but will block them. This means that any inactive RBTs will remain inactive.
---
So why am I being downvoted for mentioning slugging in a conversation condemning actual hostage situations?
---
Do people honestly think that downing a survivor but not picking them up is a hostage situation? Like you can't trap a downed survivor anywhere - they can just crawl through you and will bleed out.
---
I just feel that if someone literally runs into the basement with the killer hot on their heels (something I notice a lot as Spirit as I literally phase and see their scratch marks and wouldn't go down there otherwise) they really deserve to be downed, not just run around you, it's a mistake of epic proportions for a survivor to do that, being healthy shouldn't save them in that situation.
---
Hurrah for 🤡
---
All survivors get a phone and receive a photo of the mori.
---
Yeah. But what would they be though? Especially for the OG killers? For example, what do you think Billy’s loading screen would be? His old home where he was holed up?
---
Used that hit against someone. I was called a "Bullshit exploiting killer". Tried it randomly since I was survivors get downed near there and just stay ontop of one of the hay bales to not get picked up.
---
Gotta say, it feels good.
---
Terrible? I think killers (most of them) are meant to look badass, and i will rush to get both of those lovely new skins.
---
Don't forget Sunglasses Freddy!
---
What perks? I use spine chill to sneak away from the killer when he's coming towards the door. By the time he reaches it, there's maybe only 60% time left. All he needs to do is block the lever and it's over.
---
It pertains to the question because, as the last survivor, it's almost impossible to escape.
---
Really? Ive recently got back into the game and been slaying with him either I’m good or just trash survivors
---
did you use any addons and if so which
---
I’m pretty sure it’s arbitrary. There’s plenty of strange rules regarding animations that make no sense such as not being able to pallet stun or flashlight a pickup until the animation is done or needing to complete the entire locker jump out animation to use Head On.
---
So because the killer played well you should get a free escape?
---
Thank you, I'll forever think that and laugh now, you've eased the pain a little.
---
Nea is probably one of the best stealth killers in the game.
---
Yeah I expect to jump. A lot.
---
Gosh, wow
---
damn someones pissy
---
Killer: brutally demolishes survivors and hangs them on a hook to appease an ancient, evil god. 
---
Me: *squats*
---
Killer: that's harsh bro
---
Didn’t know know this was a tournament.
---
holy fuck
---
Holy fuck I found my new main
---
Looks cool and kinda makes sense
---
Finally, some good fucking skins.
---
Same man! Scream is a personal fav of mine when it comes to iconic slashers...Dream come true tbh
---
off topic but I would ditch that adblocker and get ublock orgin so much better and you have way more control
---
This happened after I installed the newest update, have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, verify integrity, and have tried delete this file but wouldn't let me even with a file shredder. If anyone has advice or help it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you
---
D A M N
---
I run noed on b tier killers and maybe get 1 kill almost never 2 or more. I don't get why this is always a topic. When I play killers I see adrenalin in 90% of my games. So how to counter that? NOED.  If the killers rely on noed kills I would bet he gets dumpstered 99% of his games. You got downed because of noed a few time but you bring how many 2nd chance perks? For real just cleanse  or play more stealthy towards last gen.  The situation you talk about would be stupid for the killer to rely on every game.
---
Maybe visual and mistook it? The bar burns away and every time 1/4 of the time is up it quickly burns the rest behind it away. So visual and audio as far as PTB, havn't played it since though.
---
I don't mind the hatch closing mechanic. I just think the timer should start when you become the last survivor and stop when it's shut.
---
Opening the doors is hard enough. To combat toxic survivors, they should put them in broken state and display their aura after a certain amount of time has passed.
---
I escaped once by myself against a hag, only because she didn't trap the lever. If she had, game over. It's that easy.
---
Yup. I don’t know if it happens to everybody (I assume it does). This is the only game that I have installed that does it too.
---
