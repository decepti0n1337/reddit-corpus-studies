because I want to make a text post without actually making a text post. it's a little more fun to type it onto a board a cartoon character is pointing at than to just type it in a post. it's a lot more interesting to look at this than just a standard text post imo.
---
---
---
Oooof
---
[removed]
---
Let's have a killer that is basically your own build-a-killer and survivors will have no idea what exactly your power may be and will require longer to figure it out. Sounds greeeaaaatttt!
---
So her lunge attack no longer counts as a basic attack meaning that hitting survivors with the lunge attack during exposed scenarios such as NOED and haunted grounds will not down them.
---
That's cool wanna shoot me a follow when you can?
---
I was actually one hook away from killing that guy that said ez too
---
definitely not, a good Hag will end chases as quick as Spirit does, Freddy is just a M1 killer so still loopable
---
You forgot the shitpost flare my man.
---
I’m being serious
---
Nurse is very much viable on console, just harder to learn.
---
Actually I struggle a lot against that Perk haha, but I always see ppl running Dead Hard/Self Care more often
---
You made it even worse
---
From what I've seen it might be platform based too, still not sure though
---
I cant take you serious.  He is quite good. I've been 4k'ing all night vs purple / red ranks.
---
Sure
---
Wait seriously?! So her sneak attack no longer works with NOED?
---
Yoi
---
Screwing someone bc you are bad is just worst, it wasnt his fault that you are trash
---
Pig
---
Yes!! And have Sarah as the corresponding survivor! The only question is....
---

---
Do we go by the original or the remake...?
---
Well, at least there's Lithe.
---
I just used a offering to play as him, and i didn’t get a single sacrifice. Not even a single hook!
---
Sony are ALWAYS fucks to work with\*  
---
  
---
FTFY
---
No mither?? Fucking again?? I could not believe
---
why is no mither even allowed in the shrine lol
---
I think they're just whittling her down so that they can rework her next. They just need her to be more broken first so that the community will ask for it.
---
Fs not for me again will God ever put hex ruin in the shrine fml
---
I played against him earlier and not even balanced landing could get me away from him.
---
They slow the survivor down by forcing them to search boxes and I don't know about you but I've played against many a pig where I've had to run to every box, all the while looking out for her.
---
I'm telling you man, you can abuse the boxes pretty heavily and those traps start doing a lot of work
---
I love him so far. Fake pallets are so much  fun.
---
Anything i should get??
---
This is probably one of the most underwhelming Shrine Week Ever.
---
What killer is that with Billy? Cause I cannot figure it out and it's driving me crazy.
---
Any reason why or just your personal preference?
---
What are fake pallets
---
That's not how it works. Just because I won't use it doesn't mean I don't want it changed/fixed.
---
I don't use iridescent head, that doesn't mean I think iridescent head is fine and that it should stay the way it is.
---
This guy^ = moron
---
nerfing low tier killers. nice
---
lithe
---
Maybe swap out urban evasion for quick and quiet and swap w.o.o for dance with me. It’s a great build if you’re in a jungle gym you can lose the killer very quickly.
---
I’m also on PS4 but I know there’s only one achievement for him for the PC Version and it’s Adept Bill. 
---
If they add more achievements for him I’m pretty sure the PC version would’ve gotten them. 
---
That said some ideas I have are as follows:
---
1.	Recover from the dying state by yourself 25 times
---
2.	Perform 25 safe hook rescues
---
3.	Repair 25 generators when you’re the last survivor remaining
---
Perhaps not 25 times for any or each, but basically ideas that go to his perks.
---
Dream pallets are a hoot. At least for the killer
---
Lmao. Stop complaining. It’s new. If you’re having trouble or making a bunch of mistakes, try to fix them. He seems pretty fine to me. :)
---
Lithe and Save the Best For Last are nice to have.
---
At least it’s not meg. I used to do it bc I wanted the practically complete invisibility, but I’ve grown out of that. Now I only do it bc I’m p 2 so I might as well finish the whole thing. Don’t worry I actually do gens and don’t crouch in bushes 24/7
---
Ya got goofed my guy
---
If you play survivor. Lither
---
Killer Save the best for last osnt the worst but id keep my points personally.
---
Basically it’s like that for any killer.  Play them and get their trophy for power use.  
---
I mean you can play the Trapper and not set traps ever or huntress and never throw a hatchet....
---
But who would?  Like every game
---
I played a match with Pig after the update today. Her ambush still works with NOED at least
---
WOAH I didn't even know, like what datuq ho?! Shit got me saying broooooo
---
Its an addon, it turns his snare into fake pallets you can put up around the map (10 pallets max). They have to be in the dream world to see them and if they drop a fake pallet, it explodes with blood. Its awesome.
---
^Truth.
---
When that happens, and it happens enough to notice, #HatchGameBruh.
---
Yeah pretty much.
---
They don't (just as Clown's gas) because pallets don't have a medium vaul, only slow and fast.
---
Nah, save your shards.
---
Nah, his lungs is the same. He’s always had that godlike lunge
---
Its a lot like when D3 dropped the ball on release, all the players were flaming the game but it was mainly because they believed in it, they wanted it to be good and they knew it could be so much better.  Lo and behold Blizzard got their shit together and made it one of the best recent ARPGs out there.  
---
But lets ignore that. What a cool guy reaponse from BVHR!
---
How do I know they’re in the dream world or the real world?
---
personal 
---
GF is pretty boring for me

Would like to test this now if my pc wanst broken
---
Still no Discordance. It never appeared in the shrine 
---
ffs I don't want to buy Legion and level him up -.-
---
Who uses that perk
---
I used mlga to block every single freddy that used the fake pallet lmao
---
Such an unfun add on. The new prayer beads/franks mixtape.
---
I for one, genuinely think he would be an amazing addition to the roster of Dead By Daylight
---
I'm thinking he can have perks maybe called things like,
---
Be Mine: You start with an obsession, the obsession cannot hear your terror radius outside of 24 meters, other survivors have normal terror radius effects. You lose your red stain when in a chase with your obsession, however when they are sacrificed your terror radius increases by 15 meters
---
Tunnel Vision: (Incoming joke about tunneling, I don't want to reward killers for "tunneling" but maybe it can work like "Make Your Choice" in a way with unhooking survivors outside your terror radius to prevent camping) Lets say a survivor unhooks another one, the survivor who unhooked them IF they are outside your terror radius when they get unhooked, they get a random affect applied to them like Hindered, Exhausted, Mangled, and maybe even a small chance of them being Exposed, that chance going up a small amount with each leveling of the perk maybe to let's say 13%→17%→23% and making Hindered the highest chance. But unlike Make your Choice, this affect applies the entire game. And can only go off every 150 seconds.
---
Breathe Easy: When a generator fully regresses, you gain a token. For up to 1 tokens. Each token lets your next attack apply the blindness status affect to the survivor you hit, missing an attack will consume a token. For each level up on the perk it goes from 1 token, to 2, to 3.
---
How is pig better than leatherface when he has an insta-down? I get that he gets slowed by using it, but if you use it properly you shouldn't be missing with it
---
nO U
---
They fixed that when they made all killers lunge the same.  What your experiencing is just the animation.  Sometimes it will look like it won’t hit because he attacks with his hand like hag, but his lunge is the same as all other killers.
---
Already got feng at a pretty high level, so no lithe
---
I haven’t played since legion came out. Came for the game, stayed for the memes
---
Woohoo can’t wait to buy no mither ! 
---
Said no one ever
---
Actually gonna get stbfl for gf
---
Put together with unrelenting beast
---
Killers always just close hatch so bleh xD
---
Both he and his weapon is small, so compared to Trapper who's huge with a big machete his lunge goes a lot further. It's the same distance for both but Freddy's model has to cover more ground in the same time. That's why Plague sometimes seems like she has a short lunge as she's wicked tall and travels proportionally shorter.
---
The remake has a cooler mask, but you can't beat the original.
---
Iron will + Lightweight.  At a loop that breaks line of sight.  Oh boy.  Your losing that killer.
---
Hag is the third or possibly the second best killer, so no.
---
Yeah, but the old Legion achievement was stupidly complicated.
---
Someone gets in a chase with her, and the other three run through the traps, ready to keep running if she actually comes to you. She can't teleport to them all and chase the person at the same time so three out of four are safe, regardless of what choice she makes, and you just blew up her entire web - which she now has to reset. Eventually, one of the three gens is gonna get done and she can't really stop it.
---
It's exactly the same as all three people going for the survivor in the basement when facing Trapper. Pop all the traps at the same time and you just nullified their entire strategy.
---
Stop being entitled and be happy that they give out perks at all, they could make this whole game pay to win but they don't
---
Panda for ShrineMaster 2019 make it happen bois.
---
They have a glowy frame around their character,  you know what i mean once you see it. Just smack them one time and they get right into the dream world or just let the micro sleep effect put them in automatically.
---
Basically on successful chainsaw LF won't have a 3 second cool down compared to missing his chainsaw
---
On the one with Ace you can see what looks like trees outside the window, indicating that is is not in the air
---
They did a couple of months ago
---
Yeah that one was a tad ridiculous.  Basically promoted the whole deep wounds hit bloodhound backwards chasing to get it as well.  That one def needed changed
---
There's whole guides and videos on this. I suggest you do research on this kind of stuff before you come running on here claiming Freddy is worthless, when in reality you just have no idea what you're doing.
---
That's not green hair that's the head rest of the floaty she is laying on
---
Has it never appeared in the shrine at all?
---
Ok, but I thought dream snares brought them to the dream world. Also how can they see me if they’re in the real world?
---
Run noed for all that extra salt, lmao of course it’s the survivors fault’
---
Hi, yeah, I'm here, what's up?
---
I mean, lightborns not super meta but it's a good lobby counter pick that makes it to where you don't have to level wraith.
---
More like devour hope
---
I was doing Adept Plague after the patch went live and can confirm infectious fright worked with Corrupt Purge it seemed pretty strong.
---
Trapper
---
Second best? I’d say nurse spirit and billy beat her by far
---
I do prefer pig, but they’re both fun.  
---
Pig benefits from the fact that her stealth doesn’t have any kind of sound giving it away and she can’t be broken out of it.  In my experience playing them both, it’s way easier to sneak around a corner as pig and get a free hit on a survivor than it is to stalk them all the way as ghost face.  Plus with the free hit even if you decide not to chase you’ve left them injured, whereas GF’s stalk doesn’t do anything if you fail to catch them and hit.
---
Her bear traps are also a kinda fire and forget type ability that you don’t have to think too much about. They’re always helpful, with the only real way to waste them being to accidentally trap a survivor who’s dead on hook anyway.
---
And finally she has ambush, which while very situational is at least a move that can help her in chases (it shuts down many loops once the pallet is down, and will often at least spook the survivor into abandoning the loop) which GF doesn’t have.
---
Holy shit, your right. I CAN hear this image.
---
If survivors are playing properly you won’t be hitting with it. Will admit there’s a lot of bad survivors, but against people who know what they’re doing, it’s not easy at all to land a chainsaw
---
I respectfully disagree.
---
I used to main the old nurse
---
I quit playing her when I noticed how OP that change was
---
That's who I figured

dead by daylight devs attitude towards the killer community in a nutshell.

They can only see the snares in the dreamworld. They also changed freddy where survivors can see him if he is within 32m or something even if they are awake. Just check out the patch notes, its all in there.
---
Sorry, it's actually left for dead
---
I giggled
---
I do
---
Yeah I agree they should buff it if anything, but the nerf doesn’t really matter since it’s already garbage is what I mean.  It’s a “Stop!  Stop!  It’s already dead!” kind of situation.
---
&gt;Healed teammates against their will
---
How is that possible?
---
I felt like I just read my PS messages after a 4K as killer.
---
Wow good job!
---
every killer has the same lunge (other than tier 1 and tier 3 myers)
---
Download Pixlr, it helps.
---
nope
---
Oh my god. She really needs a buff.

I guess Infectious Fright will be really strong on Plague now. But imagine this perk on Billy now, XD.

I find it hilarious

You have no idea what you're talking about. Why don't you explain the technicalities of why you're right and I'm wrong? I bet you can't.
---
not really
---
Unfortunately that's not possible, but I do agree, disconnecting should a give free "hooked", "entity summoned", "sacrifice" event and a BBQ&amp;C stack, it should also give the "quitter" event regardless post game. This way the game is not ruined.
---
It was a joke
---
The achievements are:
---
Left for dead, activate last gen as last person alive and escape through a gate
---
Adept Bill, escape with the three teachables
---
Taking One for the team, protect a recently unhooked survivor by taking a hit near them 250 times
---
Toftt is a bitch
---
yes
---
Speak up some of us in the back wanna hear your message
---
So true. Their comment is fucking funny and was a hell of an insult, but I feel like he got a little too offended lol
---
I agree 100%.
---
This is the problem with the devs handholding the survivors for so long. They are now used to the game being “easy” for them and any different challenge makes them lose their minds.
---
I haven't run into it yet thankfully but I appreciate the warning. Hopefully it will get fixed soon.
---
There's dozens of us.
---
Ok. Thank you.
---
First. What platform do you use to play?
---
Urban evasion is amazing I've juked countless killers with it
---
Paint brush is just fantastic now. Removing failed skillcheck wakeups is just mean
---
Okay, but those perks were in the general bloodpool. Do I need to reunlock them now?
---
I mean, not only did he just recently get a new outfit, but he won the contest for a fan-made outfit recently so he’ll be getting an elephant suit outfit soon.
---
**Dennis Reynolds confirmed for next killer.**
---
no
---
[deleted]
---
His weapon is basically his hand and he is one of the smallest killers in the game. He has the same lunge as every other killer (few exceptions such as Myers) but compared to a big guy with a stick like Wraith his lunge just comes off as unnatural. Also I’m pretty sure his claws grow like 3x the size when he’s lunging lol.
---
Lol. No one is getting banned for disconnects. You quoting is not breaking the rules in any way. That's why we have a quitter bonus as killer.
---
I've been learning myself, watch streamers/youtubers for one, another is to not panic every time you in the match. Watch whats happening with your team. If someone is being chased or I see someone just took a hit I hammer away at the nearest gen or heal another teammate because I know the killer is probably occupied. 
---
Take into account the different perspective killers have, as a survivor you see third person, you can look behind you or around corners and its easier for you to hide in brush. Aside from that theres learning what each killer does and how to get around that. 
---
Hag? watch where you sprint, especially when unhooking or being unhooked, flashlights burn traps and if the hag is carrying someone sprint to break a bunch of traps at once.
---
Trapper? be wary of chokepoints and tall grass
---
Billy? Listen for chainsaw, if its revving up take cover even if it sounds far away.
---
Its really all about risk and risk management and what you can get away with and when you can do it.
---
You ever just press the crouch button to flex on survivors who waste a perk slot with urban?
---
Once you get into higher ranks you'll want to kill them all everytime
---
Its a me morio
---
They test most stuff on the PTB
---
I believe it was preschool I, but we couldn't access the totem the entire game. Maybe it was because of the killer's trap but we disarmed it multiple times to no avail.
---
Why would they rework pig tho? She’s got a good power and no one is complaining. The only thing I would’ve changed would make getting her traps off not random some how, which I guess could be called a “rework”
---
"a powerful perk against any other killer". 
---
Plague : I'm about to end this man's whole career.
---
Nope, its nurse, zoom in further, has a feminine body type and has the distinct nurse headpiece and what also looks to be a bonesaw.
---
Everyone says Iron Will is a great stealth perk, but it’s actually a great chase perk. It’s so much easier to juke killers in jungle gyms, buildings, etc when they can’t hear you.
---
There's no guarantee that they'll never be added. Also, a lot of the survivors are teenagers, so addings "kids" or at least the grown up versions, is not impossible at all.
---
Being able 2 speed Crouch away after using lithe helps out so much
---
If I get a game against Freddy I dc 😊 hate on me

I dont see why. For pennywise you could just use the adult versions of the characters. Jason has multiple counselors you could use, but he probably wont come for legal reasons. They could use jack the ripper but I doubt the would.

#Nice
---
This update seems to have helped with a lot. I'm not freezing for a few seconds after getting bloodlust any more which is nice. I did notice a drop in quality the patch before this one.
---
Yep, all bloody clothes
---
It’s gonna be hilarious if the devs take years to rework him to a usable state and then he just ends up getting nerfed again lol
---
There should be a week where it's just 4 no mithers
---
Adrenaline, Calm Spirit, Self Care, and Small Game.
---
Same happened to my party. Along with some BPS...cool...
---
use spinechill now that he's invisible at a distance
---
At this moment, I see devs rather buffing Nurse than buffing Pig. I don't know why they hate her so much ...
---
Yeah, like the other comment said, also, just tapping it would show their aura as they knew I had nurse's calling at the 4 minute mark
---
If there's a window or a pallet nearby sure, but this is why Leatherface shines at a 3 gen build. Once you take out all the pallets in a given area, you can just use bamboozle to block the windows and bam, no chainsaw counterplay. Without a pallet/window, even good survivors don't have much of a counter to LF breathing down their neck with a chainsaw. At that pint you just spin around or hug a wall and hope he loses you
---
Read the question again.
---
I heard you will get banded if the ani-cheat system detect it?
---
Smh
---
Really wish they'd stash all these pictures somewhere permanently in hi-res, it's really good artwork
---
If I see a squad running 4 flashlights, a change is being made. Similar to running nurse's vs 4 medkits or franklins vs 4 toolbox
---
STBFL and Lithe are pretty good lol, 50% useful shrine is not that serious. No mither should just be deleted
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Do you know who you want to play?  Some perks work better with some powers than others. 
---
Other generally good perks to unlock are 
---
Bamboozle - Clown
---
Surveillance - Pig
---
Discordance - Legion
---
Pop goes the weasel - Clown
---
Nurses calling - Nurse 
---
Brutal strength - Trapper
---
You can play other killers, earn the BP, and then put the BP into Hag. You don't have to play the person you want to use the BP on.
---
I wouldn't run unrelenting. I'd instead work on not missing swings. It'll help more in the long run.
---
Didn’t think about that, thanks
---
u/peterexplainsthejoke
---
Iron Will is the tax for playing Jeff.
---
What's with brutal strength rising in popularity all of a sudden?
---
Pc
---
Nah, I do the same against iron will users with nurse vs non users. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
I can guarantee Jason wont be coming because his rights are all over the place
---
I'm glad I play on PS4
---
Rework Freddy are my booty today and I had a game where I got to 99 on the exit gate and he smacked me, he had noed ;-;
---
Pennywise prob won’t be added because to be honest he I basically like the Entity himself.  He is a lot more than just a clown with powers.  He is a cosmic entity that feeds on fear.  The Dbd Entity is a cosmic entity that feeds on hope.  
---
One does his own dirty work, and one forces others to do it.
---
I thought the devs removed double pallets. I guess not.
---
Its pretty much spine chill and borrowed that kill the guy. I suppose add adrenaline and dead hard. But spine chill is pretty much the counter.
---
Looks like the Meg hit a lag spike near the end or she was speed hacking
---
Trapper cosmetic
---
I want that Kate outfit.
---
If you say so.
---
Not even a joke, he said:
---
&gt; Worst Freddy Ever
---
&gt; Learn To Play Sucker
---
And apparently I only caught him 'cause it was a bad map (Backwater Swamp).
---
Spirit is definitely one of the better killers. For her,  a lot of perks are worth running. She also has some good add ons and fun builds. 
---
Doctor isn’t very strong, but he is good with terror radius based perks. His power is tied to his terror radius so increasing it with distressing or something make Sir more effective at range at least.  Shocking survivors can prevent them from vaulting windows and pallets and dropping pallets at all,  but the slowdown from
---
Charging the Shock means good survivors will just keep running the loop and not get confused. 
---
Wraith is decent after his buff or rework whatever they called it (cube?) and can use his add ons to change his playstyle a lot. 
---
Honestly what I did was just start playing a killer you like and start leveling each one up to 40 to get their perks.
---
I just want to go against new Freddy. Played 13 matches and havent seen him once
---
D3 was great but not much replayability. That's one of the most important things in any video game.
---
I've only been playing for 3 days and even I know that is a dick move.
---
I really wish there were more gamemodes, too! I would love to see a gamemode with 2 killers. Imagine Amanda and Michael teaming up!
---
The banner the plane is towing probably says “POST SALT HERE”
---
if you're not spending money on the game, it's justifiable
---
Why couldnt i wake up using that alarm? Was it bugged or do i have to still be awake? Lol
---
Thats why you do it with more than one gen. Split up and take several at once. Hag's downfall is when there's more than two choices she's gotta make at the same time.
---
Heck, someone can initiate the whole thing by blazing through the web at a single gen. It takes two seconds to start as long as you're all spread out - as you should be, in every game.
---
Immediately blaze through the other sections of the web when you hear the traps go off. She's gotta make a choice somewhere, and that person takes the lead. She can't retrap them all instantly so you've got some time on two out of three gens, or on all three if she decides to chase the person.
---
Any slightly coordinated team can pull this off with zero problems.
---
Also, you can also counter the web by simply not letting her set up a close proximity three gen. Another thing you should be doing every single game. Only map you can't pull this off well on is The Game.
---
Is each chapter a month? Not quite sure what the time scaling is for that chart lol.
---
I'm on my death hook and the Killer is following me, what a toxic killer
---
Tbh. Its comes down to playing a good amount and eventually playing selfish from time to time. After awhile you'll know killer trends and will recognize what to do. Im not say altruism is wrong or bad, but altruism can get you killed. So sometimes of the choice is between me living or rescuing a guy obviously bring proxy camped...im gonna let you assume which one you should take.
---
Thanks. I wish they’d drop them already.
---
Yes
---
both BHVR and EAC told us they don't really care about us changing those. 
---
BHVR told us that "We won't hunt anyone down for it but if EAC bans you, we can do nothing about it"
---
people reached out to EAC and they told us that as long as it's not affecting gameplay, they are fine with it
---
there's no confirmed instance of someone getting banned for it and if someone actually gets banned, they can always reach out to EAC support and get an unban
---
I'm not sure either, actually. I hadn't played the PTB and was just waiting for the release. Haven't  seen many complaints though.
---
Dead by Daylight: Sucks AND Blows!
---
Because I hooked each survivor 3 times each, and left the area right after hooking. I generally don't tunnel or camp, unless I need to in certain situations.
---
No, but I shouldn't have to play the game religiously for half a year to earn them, either.
---
To have fun

Usually i always let the last person go just cause i dont really need that last bit of blood points and generall im well over pip points soo ehh.
---
nah, I feel like lithe is gonna make a difference on freddy but, freddy mania is gonna die down.

YES

Still haven't fixed rank not updating bug...

You do seem salty though

They literally changed it so it wouldn’t take so long to hit them.

Is this a .... *shitpost*?

Try verifying your game files through steam, I’ve had that happen to me as well.
---
Adrenaline wants to know your location
---
The only one that made me lol. Take my upvote. 😂😂
---
This. When I first saw Plague I thought she WAS. Been low-key disappointed since.
---
Batman finally executed the joker and he annoyed the trapper
---
In the patch notes they did say they gave better totem hiding spots sooooooo
---
I can see where that person was coming from buyt it was so fucking funny to see that intense response to a short comment, and then an even shorter response. It's like it was ripped from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
---
&gt; as long as one survivor dies, and hopefully gets aggravated, I am happy.
---
Remember folks, it's not the act of camping or tunnelling that are 'toxic', it's the mindset of jackasses that do it to revel specifically in pissing other people off.
---
&gt;Is each chapter a month? Not quite sure what the time scaling is for that chart lol.
---
Every 3 months.
---
Are you on steam or console? If steam then try verifying your files.
---
How dare you
---
I see.
---
Rest In Peace son
---
There’s always a catch to new updates and this one guarantees a active NOED that no one can touch!
---
How though? Not saying he is right but he could be someone who liked the concept of the game but felt the devs fucked it up with patches. The response didn’t really defend the game, which is fine since the guy never gave constructive criticism in the first place but it isn’t really a murder by words.
---
I never thought of using  Thrilling Tremors on Freddy but yeah that sounds pretty dope.
---
God tier? Nah. Just use brown one for pallets and youre good lmao
---
YEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!!
---
This is a lore post
---
Question, have you ever watched nightmare on elm street
---
Theoretically this is great, but would the gen teleport come back fast enough to warrant all the perks having a synergy with it?
---
"Your game sucks and blows" did you not read the tweet? Like???
---
boy the new hotline miami looks different
---
you sure about that? i have an xbox one s and shit runs like magic for it being on console. obviously not as good as my pc but it’s veryyyy well compared to other peoples.
---
He did bro
---
Who cares about console lmao, higher skill ceiling higher importance.
---
Especially now that Dead Hard is broken. I'm using Lithe for now until they fix it.
---
Not to be mean but shut it then. Freddy Kreuger is a DREAM DEMON! He works off of dreams. When his victim is asleep, he slides into their dreams, shows what they fear and kills them!
---
Yikes haven't heard of that "in denial" response before haHAA

But no one cares about endorsement in Overwatch

LOOK AT THE BANNER! It’s 2 skulls and what looks like a Hot Dog in the center!

Jajajajajajajajajaja
---
Hi, are you me? Thanks.
---
Us No Mitherians gotta stick together
---
 Omg fredi op, what is looping and memeory?
---
I just tested it on Hillbilly, it works with chainsaws now.
---
That would ruin the immersion. Have you ever even used a flashlight in real life?
---
Fun to play, unfun to face. Rank reset is making things miserable for me on the survivor side of things, considering I don't play survivor often. My teammates just won't do gens.
---
How it goes against his lore? 
---
His lore States that his origins are unknown so BHVR can add something like "entity offered him plenty of victims" or he was even made by Entity itself, considering SlenderMan has some similarities with Entity.
---
But slender fans will probably hate bhvr for such addition to his lore
---
We are here because we love this game. I want it to improve and strive for a long time. I have a lot hate relationship with this game XD
---
Degenerates like you belong on a `hook`
---
Going to the upside down, with the ability to pull survivors into the dimension, sort of like the old Freddy.  Survivors can’t heal them, unless they are in the upside down with them, generator progress is slower, and can’t be fully completed unless you are in the regular world, you can go back by using lamps scattered around the map, when interacted by a survivor, lamps flicker and bring the survivor back
---
Me: “BBQ &amp; Chili?”
---
BHVR: “SHRINE MACHINE BROKE”
---
Me: “Understandable have a nice trial.”
---
Ye that's the thing, it would've made more sense to call him out for not providing any constructive criticism instead of essentially saying if you don't like it then don't play it, which is kinda silly since people can have valid criticisms for not liking the game and addressing it could potentially make the game better.
---
Because penny wise is pretty much a peronafied version of the entity thats why.
---
nah dude wraith is fucking great
---
Next you are going to tell me the pig is a pig demon. Keep your jokes to your self. This is a lore post
---
Ok... u have to be kiddin me
---
What does save the best for last do?
---
ITS RANDOM?!?!?!?!
---
sometimes when you start blinding on pick up too early you can click your flashlight to adjust the timing
---
Honestly Behavior what did pig ever do to you?
---
"slugging with 4 gens lol" - says the guy with OoO
---
 Shhhh dont tell to anyone.
---
It's a perk that notifies you with a bell chime when you're near a killer trap or totem. Works with Freddy's pallets too.
---
I really like this response lol
---
I had that issue. Jusy contact Nintendo support and they should be able to help you out

Exactly

waking up doesn't prevent you from being hurt. Only reason you want to wake up is so you dont get affected by his dream snares/pallets and his teleport coolown won't be reduced.
---
She was the only Pig that escaped from being turned into bacon, ever since she wound up in The Entity's realm the Devs swore to make her suffer.
---
Big yikes. The best way is to get a couple people to play with that will be able to kinda guide you.
---
Welcome to reddit man:( people are rude. And think you’re stupid for proposing something different than the status quo. Ignore them, they’re just too lazy to give a decent response other than something sarcastic.
---
I understand where you’re coming from. It seems to me that the problems are arising from your teammates. And not so much the game mechanics. Is that correct? Do you have any friends you can get on discord with? Having a 4 man will give you consistency and you’ll have good voice comms too. Have you seen the streamer AngryPug? He’ll definitely agree with you that even the most high ranked survivors are trash against ruin. 
---
I hit great skill checks about 30% of the time lol. But I always try to hit them. For me personally, I just don’t have a problem with the gen times in the game. But you and I could also just play the game different from one another. I’m a more casual player, that really just likes to level my characters up and do the best I can:)
---
I’m a killer main btw, but have been playing survivor more because of queue times.
---
you have to press it once for it to start shining and press it again to stop. it doesn't work for "as long as you're holding a button". You also can't click it as fast
---
They can break you out. Completely canceled and useless you’ll have to use it like 3 separate times to expose one survivor if they’re good survivors.
---
Uh, as a killer main who used to only get 2Ks and now I’m guaranteed a 4k, seems balanced to me
---
Big dick energy
---
**NOT FUNNY. DIDNT LAUGH.**
---
No the pig is Amanda Young, Jigsaws (aka John Kramers) apprentice
---
Damn foiled again. They need to change flashlights to toggle. But still no cooldown
---
Or  Enchantress from Suicide Squad D:
---
It would be balanced in my book until I'm guaranteed an 8k
---
But that doesn't change the fact that rancor is useless in this situation...
---
That down must have felt good for him, I love it when someone teabags the whole game and eats it
---
It isnt the best thats for sure. But it can be considered a counter against the most meta killers atm(spirit,nurse) because u get a notification without cd when the killer is looking in your direction.
---
Killer detection
---
If you already have them, you’re good. If not, you need to make them teachable.
---
Oh no but she doesn’t need to be nerfed
---
I legit cross map jay hatchetted a David twice yesterday, was he liking it all this time?
---
isn't that game dead?
---
sounds like a right cunt
---
They should really just remove the survivors ability to move, that’ll make it balanced
---
I mean I wanted to die. Free points for that cutie
---
Someone order a whaburger with french cries? Order number 62!!!!
---
Who says Meg is a tomboy? She’s athletic that doesn’t necessarily mean she’s a tomboy.
---
Mhm it's an absolutely justified thing to have a mind set of 'im playing for me to have *fun*, I don't care about other people's enjoyment' but it becomes an entirely different thing when the mind set shifts to 'hopefully I intentionally aggravate the people I'm playing against because I know I'm making their experience *unfun*'
---
What about Cannonbal? He’s a canniball demon

---
A lot of this is based off outdated and false information.  He lost his aura reading ability.  And being asleep just means he can teleport to gens a bit sooner and that you are affected by his traps nothing more.  You don't even have to wake up period against him.
---
You babyraging and quitting games like a toddler over a killer you don't even understand is a complete joke.  Learn the kit before you act like a toddler next time.
---
Lol, love how killers downplay completely obvious metas that work in their favor. But you better believe they were the first to bitch and DS, MoM, and all the other survivor perks. Y’all are some bitches, shut up.
---
Well said. Unfortunately, I started the game super altruistic and quickly realize that there are times, you just cannot save everyone.
---
Save the Best For Last might be my favorite perk in the game. For someone who doesn’t own the Halloween Chapter, I’m happy they get a chance to fuck with it.
---
It used to be A LOT, but since the plague, it never pops up anymore for me.
---
Exactly.
---
I was just doing the objective bro
---
I'm sorry what. This is probably the single most dumbest comment I've ever seen on this reddit..
---
What do you mean you are getting a lot of kills but everyone escapes?
---
Don't give up, OP! Starting the game, losing seems like it happens a lot and surviving seems daunting. However, once you play more and more - get a grip of the game, surviving is way easier.
---
Your not very smart are you. I hope your shit posting.
---
They're at least something to help support good play and reward players for being, well, decent people to fellow teammates. It would at least be something more then what we have now in the game.
---
I believe her name is the Pig, not Bad Ham
---
hes not wrong though  
---
i play cuz my friends do. that's it. bring on any new killers and survivors you want and the game is still a joke now.  
---
they went too close to the sun (imo)
---
Lithe and SFTBL are really good perks. This shrine is actually good and has something to offer for people who play either side. Not every shrine is going to have BBQ or Ruin. This shrine is a good example of what it should be.
---
Hah hah. Cannibal aka Leatherface whos mind is broke aban d he defends his home. Texas Chainsaw Massacre
---
That’s not true because they can mori you. Just because you’re already injured which makes the exposed status useless doesn’t mean getting mori’d is useless, which makes rancor not useless in that situation.
---
Nah bro he’s a demon
---
Use perks to slow the game down. Ruin, pop goes the weasel, sloppy butcher, thanataphobia etc...
---
Really?
---
I got a c+ in algebra last semester thank you very much
---
Penny wise not likely breaks lore.
---
Jack or Pyramid head aren't movie killers
---
I expect Jason some day.
---
I would like slenderman but he's a wild card here.
---
I wouldn't mind a duo killer that is on its own. Like where 2 killers go in together as specifically co-op killers and can chase down the 4 survivors. Like, for example, 2 people go in as Chucky and Tiffany and have to kill the survivors. That would be a lot of fun but would require a ton of balancing since it would be 2v4.
---
why not? achievements confer no benefit. an equally reasonable argument could be made that ALL achievements should take a lot of play time to earn, hence the name 'achievement'.
---
Rank 15 and it is going strong!
---
First day huh?
---
Yeah he’s a demon
---
His lunge just feels different because of Size and anmation. It's why plague feels like hers is smaller
---
Was it the obsession who DC'd?
---
Oh man, i love using that tactic. Killers can, most of the time, tell when you want them to know where you are, so dont be surprised when the killer does the opposite of what you want. I love when i ignore the "looping expert" and they follow me around trying to get my attention, only to fall to passive swipes while im carrying their friends.
---
Nah David is just a lad who is willing to love on a lady any time of the month
---
Was getting that loud noise notification as survivor. Didn't know what the hell it was but never thought much about it. Guess it was that bug
---
Only level 29798
---
I've played on it about 10 times today and while it certainly isn't as long as it was, it's most certainly wider. And yes, those super safe pallets before the rework are still there AFTER the rework that's a point I made in my post. Along side all the additional pallets they added. And how can you mindgame a competent player with a third person view with no obstacle between you and their point of view? Sure you can try doubling back, using the pallet itself as a line of sight blocker but a half decent Survivor will just run the opposite way, back to the pallet. You may get rid of the loop quick but you still get a pallet to the face with no hit, and then are instantly back to another loop were the exact same thing will happen if the Survivor isn't brain dead. Rinse and repeat all game, gens get done, game over.
---
Decent joke actually, got a snort from me.
---
I mean, a skilled nurse is a nightmare to play against but saying that she requires no skill is honestly bias.
---
2v7 would be better
---
Good job.
---
How is this not lore? Freddy can't kill people in their sleep
---
Looks like ur internet’s the issue. Also maybe your caps lock is broken?
---
I literally just laughed out loud at that face
---
Few decades*
---
Rank reset lad
---
Thank you so much! Considering a few hours ago I barely managed to get a hit on anyone, let alone sacrifice them, this is amazing
---
Or as a wall print. Like I would legitimately buy a vinyl print of that.
---
He's decent until purple and red ranks. He's fun enough, if you think he looks cool I wouldn't hesitate to buy him.
---
This, and your dream projection cooldown is reduced by 15% for each asleep survivor.
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
Dont thank me. Its good to see people improve and not be boastful about it. Just keep at it.
---
It’s ok, you just made a mistake, it happens! 😊
---
Want the best fcking advice bestowed to many noobs???
---
Watch Monto play any killer you'd like to play. And proceed to enjoy fun content while paying attention to mind games he does at pallets, intercepting survivors, and hiding your red stain. BTW the red stain is a light in front of the killers that only survivors can see which shows what the killers point of view angle is and what direction they are facing.
---
Again that's Monto, m-o-n-t-o on youtube
---
Cool
---
lol
---
She did on her p3 face, and it looked really good. They just got rid of it this patch
---
If you want a God teir killer you should look into Freddy. Overall legion is fun but you have to buy the pink hair julie
---
That's bad lag, sure, but it's not cheating.
---
He's the original pokemon from Red. 
---
Unknown.
---
Few universal resets*
---
They really should add a blanket item for survivors, unlimited uses, when a you’re asleep you just throw it over you like Snake with a cardboard box and Freddy can’t see you
---
Congratulations! Glad to see you are doing better man.
---
I’ve already been recc’d him and yeah I wastched a few and it’s pretty good! 
---
Also, I’m actually coming from being a survivor main so I know about the red stain hehe
---
The simple way to try and guess things before asking people for their reviews, is to think to yourself "Will i get the amount of money i spent by the time i got bored of this purchase?". Hope you get your money's worth if you do buy it, Have a good day!
---
Maybe I haven't played with them enough but it seems they're only useful at jungle gyms?
---
Selling all my 100 Gruesome Gateus on Ghost Face and because they are considered Event Offerings to a reduced price of 100 per Offering. Joke :D
---
😊 thank you
---
I have to do it around two times per month. It can be kind of frustrating when I’m busy and just trying to get in a quick match. Not sure what I can do to permanently stop it.
---
I don’t have an Xbox but wasn’t it free a month ago or not?
---
Oh, that's even better! Since you know how good killers are, think how a survivor thinks when playing a killer. Like how people will go for saves when it is safe to, like when another survivor gets hooked or downed. Stuff like that
---
I didn't check the perks. It wasn't object though because it only happened when the generators were completed. We'd get a notification that looked like Spies in the Shadows except it'd show a human. It wasn't an aura similar to the look of bbq and chili, it was a split second yellow circle.
---
Pretty sure Rancor is bugged then
---
I guess downs would be the correct term.
---
That’s what I’ve been doing hehe so I guess I have a bit of an advantage with that I know How survivors think and when they do certain stuff it’s pretty cool.
---
Yeah but still it’s easier to fail hook checks than any other because I feel they show up more
---
I think a 2v8 would work with 8 gens on the farm maps
---
It’s all there in the survivors rule book for killers lol (I don’t)
---
The only time I get salt is when someone soft camps. Face camping doesn't bother me because I just chock it up to being a troll.
---
That's a good way of thinking about it, thanks
---
I feel like this applies to 80% of the fanbase
---
Oh that's not good. That's a pretty toxic thing to do. Sorry that happened to you
---
He's better than Legion.
---
feelsPS4man
---
Not worth the perk slot over ds/adrenaline/deadhard/borrowed/bond.
---
Survivors are stupid, its easy to use pgtw on a gen and then smack the unhooker shortly after they unhook, and then get the recently unhooked survivor back down so that they are forced into a worse situation than before... at least until they hide in a locker and have a bullshit decisive strike. As a doctor player I have to use anything I can for an advantage, and that broken combo means my strat is completely wasted. (At least forcing people to 3 gen themselves is still dead easy.)
---
The point of it is to waste the killers time if looping and to get I-frames for certain situations that would kill you or injure you, and balanced landing isn’t a high risk/reward it’s just a mediocre perk.
---
eh I am used to dealing with assholes in the game lol
---
Dealt with this the other day. Im sorta used to the hate mail sad but true lol when they say that I just say "nah, forgot the tent, got my sleeping bag though GG" end of story lol
---
Would you say you like to give the survivors a chance (joke around)
---
Over bond? Yes
---
Bond is such a wasted slot lol
---
don't buy Legion if u want to kill

I’d certainly be interested in prints or pins, but honestly I feel this art would be wasted on just stickers. Stickers get lost, bent, and torn. I’d want something that I could hang on my wall. Keep up the good work.

Depends what rank your in, it's good in any other rank, red rank might be a waste tho I can agree there
---
*Survivior does something fishy*. 
---
Killers: speedhacks. Lag switch. Scripting. Etc. 
---
*Killer does something fishy*. 
---
Killers: nothing to see here
---
if  really like the lobby simulator then do this ofc.
---
Thats why yall complain about noed
---
I haven’t had this issue at all yet. Playing Freddy and survivor. People suck lol
---
Why would I limit myself from playing the game naturally? Rules are just an excuse survivors use instead of improving at the game
---
Not a particularly in depth answer, but I’d like to throw out it can clutch get you out the exit gate even with the killer blocking your escape. It can get you out of the basement as well.
---
La la la la la la la
---
Shoutout to the dude who made 8k.
---
I personally prefer original killers/survivors because that shows their creativity but license stuff brings in more players and money if I had to guess.
---
Those at least give bonuses like an extra 100% in that Category. All Freddy’s does is give an extra 200 points.
---
I assume she’s a tomboy referring to her lore. She was a rowdy and troublemaker. She seems like s/o who could be in a street gang and not into cute stuff.
---
Counters Ghosty-goo, Spirit, and Billy.
---
so... being stealthy?
---
I don’t think huntress is gonna find hatchets there lol
---
No cuz you get called a tunneler evem if youv hooked 2 people prior to finding them
---
I literally was gonna ask about this lol
---
Balanced landing creates a fair few infinite’s on certain maps. On the Myers house for example I can loop most killers indefinitely there so long as I don’t fall for their mind games.
---
I would KILL for that map alone!
---
You didnt get all 12 hooks thats why :/
---
“On certain maps” dead hard is universally useful and for more than just looping.
---
-_-
---
What do you mean?
---
When I play on PC I leave the match as soon as it ends or just ignore chat
---
On PS4 I have my settings to friends only so I don’t get end game gg’s and salt
---
I recommend trying both to help :)
---
The pig is fine honestly, but leatherfaces chainsaw needs to be high risk, high reward. Make the fool do the chainsaw dance if he misses to throw him off. Give the chainsaw fuel or something.
---
I still don't know how a map works. :(
---
Wish I had a silver to give, you deserve it
---
Or just hooks idk im losing it lmao. I mean someone may have gotton to struggle the first hook or died their second
---
Didn't block the name up the top btw
---
Dead by Daylight Dead by Daylight Survivor Mains are THE WORST.
---
It’s predictable though. As soon as I suspect they have it I just wait and bait it out and even if they surprise me with it from that point on it becomes useless.
---
That would make more sense since it would be an uncommon enough occurrence to avoid it becoming stale
---
Oh yeah I think that’s what happened
---
Meg really strikes me as someone who could "clean up" very well, it'd be nice if we got to see her in something styled like the gold and silk collection some day
---
Small Game is your best friend.
---
Downvoted for abhorrent graphics.
---
Yeah that’s a pretty calming game
---
It's his ability to teleport to generators that I think is bullshit, especially when there's only a couple left.
---
I just don’t see how that makes her a tomboy. Plus she has girly outfits like the gypsy one and also there’s a short gray skirt.
---
Even so, being a tomboy shouldn’t make a difference. Kate is a country girl yet she’s getting a punk outfit. It’s a game they can be anything.
---
I assume the same way, it just gets tossed around
---
Yeah the rage buff ruined it for me. In my personal opinion F13 and ebd we're in par til that screw up. He already x-rays your entire body lol like someone else said and now you can't stun him. Yeah bye. You either escape quickly or you die. Made the matches repetitive so I stopped playing. I miss those end game chases though. Had a much better time with the scares and chases in F13.
---
I mean they still did us dirty with other nerfs
---
It would but the movie would need to find a logical reason for survivors to leave the campfire.
---
Stalk survivors until you're on the very brink of Evil Within III and then trigger it when you're right behind someone and can down them instantly. Try to save it for when you see a group or if you already have a survivor on hook for maximum pressure.
---
.....
---
Does it need to be useful for anything else? Even if you could dead hard a gen to repaired people would probably still save it for chases.
---
Just played a match as new Freddy and WOW! He feels so much fun to play as and empowered unlike his previous incarnation. It remains to see whether this feeling will last but so far I am loving his rework. 
---
I also played a couple of survivor matches and it seems like Head On is in a really good place now thanks to the improved hit detection!
---
Well you can prevent adrenaline by killing them before the last gen pops...
---
But the uses you're thinking of where you CAN bait it are only a fraction of the actual uses of dead hard, using it to create that little bit of distance you need to make a vault or loop is extremely valuable
---
You what perks you want. Nobody can tell you shit. Just enjoy the game how you want. Its not like youre cheating.
---
Ok? Youre a survivor main. Good for you.
---
Me yesterday. Funniest part. It was a nurse
---
Are u sure? I'll check that later.
---
Not sure what that quote is from..?
---
It was 100% from Rancor. Object and Rancor have different looks to their effects. It was not obsession.
---
[https://www.shrink-service.it/s/Zla2H6](https://www.shrink-service.it/s/Zla2H6)  Pretty hilarious stuff. I recommend giving this channel a sub if you haven't already
---
dead hard is good because it gives you more time to get to the pallet, and slows the killer down(slow after missing their swing). It’s not for when you’re running in a straight line and the killer is behind you.
---
If you’re against good survivors, they should look backwards regardless of dead hard or not. That way they know your pathing, and what options they have based on your distance.
---
While balanced is OP in some maps, it’s not consistently useful because in most maps it’s either useless or a glorified sprint burst.
---
So using a perk meant to prevent camping and/or tunneling is toxic? I dunno, seems like you could easily work around that by not going after the nerd who got unhooked, slugging, or by eating the ds and only having to deal with it once from that guy.
---
Excellent
---
I love the effort you put into this
---
I think for the first time in this sub, the word "toxic" has a relevant meaning.
---
I think you're in a toxic friendship. From what it sounds like, you don't really enjoy spending time with them. You don't owe your friend anything and your life will be better with more positive companionship.
---
Hell, maybe even a sorta Freddy vs Jason kinda game mode with killers working against each other to hook the survivors
---
I use Lithe, quick and quiet, dance with me and iron will. I find the build helps me lose most killers in a chase and iron will keeps me safe if they do get a hit off. However, I sometimes replace iron will with bond.
---
I like having a challenge so I do not do it because I find tunneling and camoing takes no skill unless I return to the hook and I only see them then id go after them
---
When i use only a Bloody Party i get the points, but if i use a Bloody Party + BBQ then it bugs.
---
What's broken about it?
---
From your history on posting and commenting at least in recent times, it looks like you aren’t the nicest guy or even that respectable. In a post on the mortal kombat subreddit you won against a scorpion and then sent him a salt message. I really doubt you don’t do the same thing on dbd and send salty messages 😕. All of your recent dbd posts are about how op Freddy is and how you don’t get why people hate when other players dc. You should look at your post history and stop being so negative and get a positive outlook and a few friends
---
ueah, but its about balancing, and trying to talk about it and what the devs can do to please bkth sides
---
People just need to get used to his new kit. I am seeing a lot of players playing him with an outdated mindset and it’s hurting them
---
No one should have to make excuses or try and justify their playstyle. Play however you want, brother.
---
I believe luck can also cause better items to be looted from chests but correct me if I'm wrong
---
So do lunge attacks no longer insta-down someone who's exposed? Am I understanding that right?
---
More than likely.
---
You will be spared then. *This time.*

---
Wait a minute
---
It’s not, though, in most cases it probably doesn’t come into play for most people because they don’t aggressively go after the person who has been unhooked, and likewise, it doesn’t win a game, it just annoys you for a few more seconds. Getting a perk to counter toxicity isn’t in itself toxic.
---
Even I as a new player noticed how weird it is.. it's like someone tried to create a universe identical to yours but  couldn't get everything exactly right.
---
This hurts to read so I won’t bother.
---
Use whatever perk you want. You’ll get hate, and you should expect it for what the perk is. If you can’t understand why people hate it, then that’s foolish.
---
Hahaha yeah
---
Theres something called playing along
---
Because finding the hatch as killer is soooo difficult lmao
---
He already Passive Phases like The Spirit outside of a 16 meter range. I'm just think they should make it more like The Spirits by keeping it at a close range too.
---
Pig's add-ons could use a little tuning to either make them more useful or play style altering. I've also have wanted them to make it so she only roars when the meter is completely filled for ambush attack instead of having her roar while the meter is filling. Besides that I think Pig is in a pretty good place. She's an all around balanced and underrated M1 killer with a lot of built in utility.
---
As for Leatherface I have no clue. I've only ever played him once through an offering, and I didn't really like him, and I often just bully him when I go against him as a survivor. I really don't know what should be done with him.
---
Lol NOED is never earned man.  It's a safety net for playing like shit overcommiting to chases and applying no map pressure all things you readily admit to doing in your post.  If you lose all 5 gens you are tasked to defend you didn't earn anything.  You could have went afk while the gens were being worked on and still "earned your NOED".  And closing the hatch isn't earning it that's just taking advantage of an in game mechanic to activate your crutch earlier.   You create your own gen rushes the way you play man.  NOED isn't the answer.  Making better decisions in game is how you will stop these gen rushes.  I pressure gens with Legion, Freddy, Wraith, Etc... map pressure is a playstyle it doesn't require a specific killer.  Some just make it easier.  You got a lot to learn about playing the role still if you don't see the merit in switching up survivors and breaking off chases strategically so you can pressure the gens.
---
bc 7 second wait time for a hit was literally killing him
---
even with a strong fanbase, for a licensed killer he wasnt that popular bc of how weak that time frame made him
---
Follow the blood.Don’t go for blind blinks. It doesn’t counter her.But I can see the effects impact spirit more, unless you’re in a grassy area
---
What bug??
---
Glad people like it! I haven't been playing the game as much anymore so I've been having a reaaallly hard time coming up with memes lol
---
Just because it’s really not fair that he can ONLY attack while sleeping and you can find multitudes of videos where a Freddy lost out on a legit, fair kill because of it and survivors just Bm at the gate since he can’t do anything.
---
I do avoid playing in ways that would be aggressively unfun for everyone, but having a hard rule against those things would be silly.  There are scenarios where doing each of those three would be the only smart play.  Plenty of instances where slugging someone makes sense, most obvious being if you suspect they have DS, if there are two survivors left and you hear one hiding nearby while you’re hooking another you’re not gonna randomly cross the map to avoid being called a camper, and when you’re hunting survivors if the one you hooked previously happens to be the first one you find then that’s their bad luck.
---
Will never go out of my way to do any of those three for no good reason, but won’t just hand survivors the match to avoid them either.  
---
But yeah I would never face camp, slug someone to death for no reason just to make them wait longer, tunnel someone relentlessly when other targets had presented themselves, etc.  Even so, some survivors will still accuse you of pretty much anything.  Fortunately for every couple of those I tend to encounter one that’s just genuinely enthusiastic and wants to talk about a cool moment that happened or something.
---
Gotta love No Mither.
---
Awesome! Gotta love ST
---
Thank you for the information &amp; your right about the date of the article. I don’t know what I was thinking. I hope it wasn’t a joke but considering that we havnt heard anything more about it since it was posted I’m going to say your probably right. Hopefully we will see the master of pain in the future.
---
I understand that, I always thought it was cheesy I could just run out the gate injured because I wasn't asleep hahaha
---
I like the timer, I kinda wish (again not complaining) that he still couldn't hit you, but him being near you sped up the timer considerably! Or something
---
Oh well! Glad they did something however
---
thanks?
---
ok tier killer but imo very fun to play with.
---
Lol trolling is fun, having someone like you spend time researching me, write a novel on what you think, makes me believe the ones who needs a life is you bud! Take the sushi shove it up your ass and shush
---
Eh, I think it's a decent tradeoff. Freddy can't aura read anymore, so not having to wait to hit survivors is fine.
---
I don't play killer unless there's a good daily, but when I do I generally follow those kinds of rules.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Why?
---
Because the emblem system (generally)rewards you for doing so. It doesn't want matches to end too early so it puts up artificially barriers so that in order max out points and ensure a pip the killer may have to do things that, while aren't very advantageous, will extend the game and increase the chances of the killer pipping.
---
Granted that's not always the case. Sometimes if it's going poorly at the start you may have to tunnel someone out to put pressure and extend the match or you might might leave someone slugged so it pulls someone one off a gen to go heal. Honestly it seems that 90% of what killers need to do to pip is just extending the match.
---
It’s the perfect combination of attack and defense!
---
I’ve never seen a post more accurate than this
---
I don't either but people say he's the worst killer next to freddy (before rework)
---
True. If a survivor starts tea bagging they should become invincible
---
Did you not read the part where I said *a lot* as in, *not all*?
---
Touché
---
Legion's not a strong killer by design, but IMO they're fun to play and they have a good bloodpoint gain. Don't listen to people that say they're only decent until purple/red ranks.. I main Legion in red ranks and I do just fine (you gotta play Susie though, that's the trick ;)). It's all up to the individual player and their playstyle.
---
Tf did I just read
---
Not having to plan and put pressure on the gens because you can rely on NOED is the clearest indicator of a crutch. It's effective for getting kills but it won't help you become better at chases, which is the best way to pressure the survivors and slow the game down. 
---
I wouldn't ever want to stagnate my progression like that.
---
Yep just had a game as trapper. Frames dropping like crazy and whenever I placed a trap it made me look up.
---
Lol yes
---
to get the hatch open the killer has to do well to get 3 killed or the surviver has to have a key and press m2 to open it
---
Did they fix that survivor's silhouettes can be seen in front of auras so you know they are there even if you don't have a perk to do so?
---
I’m pretty sure it will be available at some point for two main reasons:
---
1.	A lot of us want in and BHVR knows
---
2.	It’s not like Hellraiser is the current hit franchise earning billions. The copyright owner probably won’t mind having the revenue stream from this lol.
---
😂
---
Big boy Frank?
---
its about balance, i just dont get the hate around noed
---
I prefer GF. It is easier to run up on survivors at full speed with no heartbeat than having to crouch and then dash with Pig. I like making them panic and start running into walls lol
---
Plus you get to creep on people while stalking, so a different way to play is available if you want. Overall Ghostface is really fun, although it does get tough getting kills with him in purple ranks.
---
Oh yeah I got plans for legion 😈
---
gen rushing isnt hard either
---
You can’t bait out a dead hard from a good player
---
this is an image i can hear
---
Dead hard is inconsistent with the current patch and doesn’t even work 50% of the time
---
You won't get banned if you didn't cheat. There are survivors using known exploits that aren't banned so you should be fine
---
Nah you wont get banned, they dont check that shit lmao
---
That's pretty suspect
---
IDV players won’t last 5 minutes in a game of DBD
---
Sorry but you are wrong.
---
Happens in asymetrical pvp games when some people play EXCLUSIVELY one side and another group play EXCLUSIVELY the other side. 
---
Also this game has a HUGE skill ceiling built in with timing hits and ds and looping  and shit. So killers can seem amazing OP and unstoppable in low ranks then survivors can bully that same killer for 5 gens in high ranks. I'm pretty average and im still green at surviving but I watch the pros at this game and the mind gaming people like Tru3 do is next level. Seems like every time he chases he back tracks half a second and bam the survivor is right there waiting to get punched in the face. I'm still learning to mind game moderately good survivors and its a mixed back for me.
---
And Dwight is a pizza worker
---
It's because in the game, it is "US VS THEM"
---
Unfortunately, as with all competitive hobbies, people fail to realise that that mentality shouldn't carry over outside of the game.
---
Definitely!
---
Only Jeff needs sweatpants so he can show his huge dick print
---
Imagine somebody making a post last year about how Huntress hatchets shouldn't collide with the air above the autohaven trucks, and somebody responded with "But the trucks have a larger hitbox".
---
Yeah.
---
That's the problem.
---
my point is adreneline is equivelent to noed, it can be earned or it can be given, noed may be an insta down but adreneline is a sprint burst and insta heal, not countering noed is the suvivors fault, its a punish more than anything
---
Don’t patronize me. I’m just trying to make a point.
---
I personally main Wraith and Pig. Jump scares ftw.  The easiest killer for me is billy tho. I just dont enjoy the play style.
---
* WGLF's calulcations for Post trial points are awarded but they are not shown on the Scoreboard, only on your total Bloodpoints up right.
---
* I failed skill checks for healing and on generators while in Dream World, and did not wake.
---
Every 2 fixes = a new bug xD \*shrug\*
---
Make it so you can never get the trap off on the first try, or allow her traps to work in the end game collapse like they used to work prior to it, except a survivor with a reverse bear trap on their head slows the timer like a downed or hooked survivor. Also her addons could use some reworking, maybe add a very rare or ultra rare that removes her ambush roar. 
---
Leatherface, though, should just rev his chainsaw like hillbilly does, where you can feather it if you’d like to mindgame at pallets similar to hillbilly doing so
---
&gt; They seem to have an extreme fetish with nerfing the killers.
---
if 3 survivors escape than either 1. the hatch was open, or 2. the gates were open and noed is alrwady active
---
?
---
I love that you’re playing wraith :D
---
If you are having fun, try not to tunnel or camp so the survivors can have fun. If they’re bullying you it’s fair for you to be toxic, but be nice to the baby megs dwights and neas
---
Yet I played matches where my teammates were all trying to wake each other up, which is pointless (unless for points). I really think the teleporting to gens thing is strong,  when you have survivors wasting time waking each other up. Just do the damn gens...seriously.
---
Keys allow you to escape through hatch before it's open
---
I do. I just try to keep in mind that there’s someone on the other side of the screen trying to have fun as a survivor, and camping and tunneling take away their fun without adding anything to mine. I’ll slug if I see another survivor nearby or really need the 4k, but other than that I don’t thing slug builds are much fun for either side so I don’t do them.
---
So we finally gonna get a shirtless hillbilly cosmetic?
---
People are theorising from some of the leaked banners from today that if we're getting a summer event, we're likely getting skins for Jane, Claudette, Billy and Trapper.
---
Skins for Freddy are unlikely to happen, I'm afraid.
---
&gt; a lot of the survivors are teenagers,
---
you didn't include Jane or Bill idiot
---
^
---
This game definitely does not suck and this is coming from a pessimist lol That person is probably someone that face camps on the first person and wonders why their games always seem boring.
---
I think the new obsession will instantly enter the dream world and the old one will stay in it but will be able to exit
---
Hmmmm maybe like a type of ghost bar or something that spawn over the map only the killer can see. 
---
So at the beginning of the trial Jack is standard everything (basically trapper specs). As the trial goes on these type of ghost bars begin to appear at different areas of the map. Jack stops by the bar takes a swig (similar to how huntress has to reloads hatchets) and goes into a drunken rage gaining a timed stat buff to like walking speed, lunge distance, and action speed. A drink only apprears on the bar when the effects from the previous drink wear off. Then you can have add-ons for the different types of buffs you get and the duration of each drinks effects
---
Run what you want, but know that it is a crutch perk. I play killer 75% of the time and don't run it.
---
Oh sounds cool, I was kinda hoping that maybe they could pull through like they did with the Pig. One can dream, ay?
---
You missed it when it was in the shrine  earlier this year I presume?
---
you can't do that to leatherface he'll be exactly the same as Hillbilly, currently he's only strong in basements.
---
But it can be. There are thousands of hours of gameplay on twitch and youtube of people doing it all the time. I have no problems doing it often at red ranks. At some point you need to ask yourself: Is everyone else just getting easy survivors or is it me?
---
Silence brand
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we’ve stepped into a war with the Entity in the Fog.
---
Ah, I see what you did there!
---
Yeah, I'm hoping so. It's less likely because there are multiple license holders for the remake, and none of them seem interested in Nightmare on Elm Street, but I hope the devs can swing it!
---
Freddy is licensed so no free cosmetics for him.
---
So you're saying that when endgame collapse is active, I have to walk to the other side of the map to check the gate after hooking someone?
---
Those were my favorite offerings, The Bouquet Offerings
---
So let’s get to taking out their gens one by one
---
yeah, but i also dont run ruin, cause it can also be seen as OP
---
Nah
---
Imagine 90% of your reddit posts complaining about killers being weak. You are the common denominator my friend.
---
Maybe one day (,:
---
My first two matches of the day were on grim pantry twice in a row lol and I’ve also gotten a considerable amount of coldwind matches as well, I’ve had maybe 4 badham matches and two were due to people using an offering
---
Would be nice but it won't happen.
---
nope, just gen rushed as survivor 3 games in a row solo queueing, shit goes way too fast, went against noed 2 of those times and we countered it
---
Batter Up is still more useful than Flip-Flop, Scoops Ahoy remembers me of the cowboy character in IdentityV (and dbd needs more interactive perks like Identity)
---
I have an anger issue when it comes to games and I hate it :(
---
I can usually get one or two drops in before the survivor can escape, is it Iron Grasp related?
---
These achievements have always been on PC. Taking One For The Team was painful to get. I recommend using Borrowed Time and basically hook farming (take a hit, unhook, get downed, etc.) as that's the easiest way to get it. IDK about Left For Dead though, I hadn't considered that with the new endgame collapse. I could see someone getting it if the exit gates are far enough apart though, but it definitely sounds very difficult with the hatch closing mechanic instantly blocking the gens.
---
Is it a meme? I legitimately thought it was an awful killer whose end game was so garbage, all of his perks were made specifically give him the slightest chance of getting someone post gates opening
---
Is this on the ps4
---
You shouldn't see boxes while the trap is off in base speed and her add-ons should be buffed heavily to affect both dash and traps (just like Spirit, Billy and Doctor)
---
You always go after the unhooked one to down them and go after the unhooker so they lose both safe hooks (incase they have any perk relating to that) and they get hooked themselves. Usually you can get a hook on the other downed surv if you can put pressure to make the chased survivor go towards the already downed one, lowering the chance of them also getting up. (Though this may change at higher ranks, I've not played particularly much so survivors at rank 10~ are dead stupid and just throw themselves at your baits.)
---
Darn
---
Honestly Freddy is already balanced and that would make him 1 more annoying because passive phasing is already a fucking awful thing for spirit and 2 it might actually tip the scale of him going up a level in the tier list which is 100% not needed
---
Idk man. Noed is a crutch perk, with no other perk on the survivor side rivaling it (except old DS and MoM). 
---
You sound pretty new so I'm sure you'll come around eventually.
---
FUCKING DUMBASS REEEEEE
---
Real question is how the hell did Claudette make a sand microscope?
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I also believe that once he hits you you're then put into the dream world too btw!
---
Ya it sucks.
---
What would you do about flashlight saves then? How eould that work with his pov?
---
Shoot I forgot about Otz!! He cheats though don’t you know? Otzcheats.com
---
Screw the rework, I’d buy Freddy just for these cosmetics.
---
You might be a better survivor than killer then. I just had two games at red ranks where I 2-3 hooked everyone before winning with three gens left.
---
Maybe frequent breaks might help
---
I don’t do that, I go after the unhooker if I happen to be close because I don’t care to sweat enough to chase them all down, besides the other person has to heal and usually runs all the way across the map. The only protected hook perk I can think of off the top of my head is MoM and that’s not really meta anymore.
---
The new Freddy rework has made the game a lot more fun and interesting for me so I hope they keep up this trend they won't but I can hope
---
Didn't know you could do that, sounds hilarious.

Tried it, helps very little. It's gotten to the point where I just don't really play PvP games much anymore cause I know I'll end up breaking a controller or something. (I've broken like 3-4 controllers this way and I'm not proud of it)
---
It’s saved my ass more than once lol
---
Oof
---
Imo adrenaline is more equivalent to a worse Devour Hope, in order to get it your team has to do 5 objectives just like how with devour to get an insta down you need to get 3 hooks, only difference is devour is a multiple use things which is why it HAS to be a totem perk and Adrenaline is a one time use thing. If they wanted to balance NOED by saying you need 3-4 hooks before end game then I'd say NOED is balanced at that point
---
I moried him and I guess that the hatch spawned underneath him
---
Why are her fingers backwards?
---
this would be cool as hell
---
It's a really annoying ability actually, especially when there's only one generator left to do. Couple that with the rampant disconnects and it's basically impossible to win against a Freddy right now
---
*Sad piggy noises*
---
I’ll dont camp or tunnel cause camping isnt fun for anyone but I will “camp” when I see someone else there. And I dont tunnel but if I manage to find the unhooked survivor by random and I hit them, on the hook you go. And I really dont see whats wrong with tunneling but I can understand its boring for the survivor
---
Super Freddy would be a fun cosmetic
---
Sounds about right. Second to last DCd on me because I wouldn’t pick them up for DS. Hatch spawned under them. 
---
I let the last guy go because that shit was just unfair. Lol
---
Same, I thought this was one of those "Wraith is in the picture just invisible" jokes until I looked closer.
---
Well your "friend" is a proper cunt and an idiot with shitty opinions he clearly has no information to back up with.
---
Invite this person to Reddit, I'd love to have conversation with him on his opinions of balance.
---
A survivor main calling a killer toxic is like a stripper calling a prostitute a slut.
---
Identity V. It was somewhat the first mobile version or installment if you want to call it that of DBD. Even the devs helped the idv devs make the game
---
Yeah I was more talking about him being able to do it whilst he's in a chase and shit and that's what I don't like because it really fucks with survivors without the killer doing anything, also it's always been a part of spirit that was just added bullshit on top of an already top tier killer and that was really a spit in the face
---
Oh ya I remember that game. Is it still around?
---
Balance balance landing?
---
Tf who thinks ruin is OP?
---
Ooh ooh this one
---
Yup. But I wouldnt be surprised if a lot of them are now hopping to dbd mobile. Expect to see a lot of campers if you play mobile
---
Come for the gameplay, leave because of bugs.
---
How long has it been since you played DBD? DS juggling is no longer a thing at all
---
Sigh guess I have to burn it
---
dude, noed is balanced, just destroy the totems, now its gone before it even existed, or even when it spawn is, also devour hope is a meh perk at best, just break the totem
---
Someone did an Oopsi.
---
Not only did they say they wouldn't do a flying killer, but they also specifically said they wouldn't do Jeepers Creepers!
---
i meant annoying but i typed op on accident
---
**SOBS IN CREEPER**
---
For pig I think reverse the endgame changes but for each person with a beartrap on their head the endgame timer stops for 30 seconds then will go back to normal, let pig see how much time is left on RBTs, make the dash be considered a basic attack, and until a survivor’s BT starts ticking they cant see the auras of jigsaw boxes
---
You don't run ruin because it is op but you use noed? You must be stupid. Ruin is more widely accepted than noed.
---
Lmao
---
Nah man, i’m the kind of guy who doesn’t care if I die so long as the other survivors make it to that exit gate, If i get sacrificed saving someone else so be it
---
Wait so the bush prevents anyone from touching the totem?
---
1st. i meant annoying and its way tko risky of a perk 
---
2nd. that exactly my problem why is noed not ok but ruin or adreneline is
---
Freddy’s endgame was always good. As was his stall, aura reading and mindgames. But because “7 sEcOnD fEdOrA mAn BaD” BHVR took all of that away and gave us a shitty teleport that doesn’t work as an ambush or as map pressure and shitty traps that don’t do fuck all to help because of the same problems Trapper has with his, in that the hit boxes are smaller than my dick
---
You're welcome
---
Stealthy while in a chase. I guess when I think of stealth perks I think of things that help you avoid being detected altogether. While with Iron Will I meant you can juke Killers in chases easier, not necessarily hide from them.
---
So, 7 weeks for a skin sale, right? Awesome!
---
Hey buddy I think you got the wrong door, circus is two blocks down
---
I think scoops and batter up are both great perks. Babysitter sounds OP to me.
---
dude, noed only activates at the end, the main game is during gens, noed isnt the problem, the problem is how fast it gets to the end, thats why new people cant get better
---
Preach
---
It's good for killer, so don't expect to be fixed soon. Probably in few months.
---
Uwu I'll finish it  
---
You:UwU it's nothing big daddy 
---
FWTC: pulls down your pants revealing the massive 50 foot cock "I KNEW YOU WERE HOLDING BACK LAST NIGHT"

FWTC: FUCK YES PLEASE

FWTC: puts a dream snare on his 50 feet long pp for protection.
---
You: Oh yes
---
Freddy begins to teabag on you and you flash your flashlight aka pp at him it's all in his eyes what have you done what wrong with you?
---
How is this toxic? There tea bagging each other and then leaving. People really do consider anything toxic in this game.
---
Lol tunneling is toxic gtfo.

Tea bagging the other survivors?
---
pig OP
---
nurse fine
---
My current hag build is Devour, Ruin, Haunted and Overcharge. It amuses me greatly watching people chase totems
---
Use the pallets. They are infinitely better.
---
No new people can’t get better because they run noed and therefore don’t need to learn anything other than basic stuff or they just don’t try to get better. There’s plenty of time for news players to learn and get better, gens are extremely slow for them
---
she’s got three whole abilities! how could you possibly escape her
---
Dark mode users be like:
---
2 far daddy-o
---
They’re also reliant on an add on and still nowhere near as powerful as Freddy used to be
---
If I see you I'm teabagging disconnecting and telling you I won
---
Every killer runs addons and you get more than enough from bloodwebs to always play them. Idk how you can't consider that part of base kit.
---
r/imsorryjon
---
Honestly thats facts, the killer was literally no where near us and we were just tea bagging nothing 😂
---
The most wrong post I've seen in a while.  Anyway, seeya.
---
2 gauntlet snaps*
---
I'm main spirit, and i don't follow voices, I follow scratches and blood, voice is last resort so pls use that no brain killer perk to help me with 3 perks instead of 4.
---
As cool as it would be, anytime people have glitched killers together in the same lobby it has barely worked. It would be a lot of work.
---
Also, balance is rickety enough xD
---
Risky click of the day
---
The add on is brown and Freddy was in NO way powerful before (I’m talking against red rank survivors).
---
Dude braught in an ebony and ya'll complaining about the instaheal?? lol
---
Ace player: Ey lmao im quiet, but if i equip iron will, ill ABSORB ALL SOUND AROUND ME
---
Or, or, or you just son't know how to use them correctly. All these killers complaining that survivors aren't taking the time to learn how to ciunter new freddy turn around and complain cause they don't know how to use snares.
---
Yeah, R,I.P. Old Freddy (ex Freddy main here)
---
He's not even that good guys
---
Flashlight saves aren't toxic period.  Honestly they're on us as killers everytime they happen.  Flashlights are by far the easiest item to counter in the game.
---
That’s not you being toxic that’s the killer being salty
---
Dang I didn’t know that and I’m glad it’s fixed but now I’m looking into the sky after placing traps.
---
The only thing I do in regards to flashlights is slug people if I know someone is nearby that tries to aggressively flashlight blind me whenever I carry someone else. I’ll chase and down them before picking someone else up.
---
Really good survivors using a purple flashlight can literally flashlight everytime unless your literally facing a wall... and you don't always down survivors next to a big wall.
---
This is a must. My favorite game mixed with my favorite show 🤩😱
---
Someone should fall off the map so the timer runs out while you are in the air. Wonder what would happen.
---
How am i being a snowflake??? Its also hard to detect bad jokes my man.
---
I hope they don't nerf him. He's a really fun well designed and well balanced killer.
---
No.
---
There's no mind game inside of 10m on most maps, which means a smart nurse blinks close enough (aka blinking to the corner you'd try to mind game around), and then gets the hit in with the next blink or eats the stun to get you with the next.
---
There is legitimately no counter play and if you were at least red ranks survivor on PC you'd understand.
---
She isn't well designed; she pays no mind to almost all survivor-killer interactions and all of her mechanical mistakes have fall backs that allow easy recovery when she should be an incredibly punishing killer to play. Why certain nerfs haven't been implemented (ie. not being able to blink down when there isnt a floor below) is beyond me when they'd make her at least semimanageable.
---
The problem is, nurse is balanced for 4 man swf meta stratting while the rest of the killers arent. Which means if you arent 4 man swf meta stratting, shes incredibly oppressive and borderline OP (just like 4 man swf metastratting is mind you). Nurse is the only killer balanced along that margin which is why its problematic.
---
I've only played him for a couple matches so far but I just don't see any reason for them to complain as his fake pallets only work if the Survivors don't pay attention to placements and his snares just slow you down a bit, he is probably the most balanced killer currently because he just has teo abilities that help with the chase and some gen pressure with the teleports.
---
Is there a fix for the "initialization error" on Xbox? The master fix list only mentions a fix for PC.
---
How so? Even with new freddy, slugged players remain asleep
---
The only time i'll do that is if it's your only chance. IE: You're about to hit phase 2 or about to hit phase 3 and no one else is going for you/able to get you.
---
The 4% chance of you actually getting away to safety i gave you is better than the 0% chance you had staying on the hook.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Oof the survivors too probably
---
Been playing about 10 hours today, never been slugged once by a Freddy.
---
More cosmetics
---
shut up cracker
---
Shes too strong. Billy is pretty good and spirit is just about perfect.
---
I can stand behind this. If I'm 2 secs away from getting in a phase then I don't mind.
---
Plunderers + Ace in the hole is great.
---
It would make a good mask
---
SLOW the games feel slow
---
I got your point that she ignores survivor-killer interactions but I still think there is couterplay if you play right. 
---
Realy liked that nerf you suggested.
---
Oh shit, what’s her rank. I went against a meg with those clothes and I thiiiiink the same perks
---
Hey, good news!
---
You're a pussy.
---
I'm aware of the last point, but the point was if someone makes an argument about how loops are too strong and too abundant, it's always met with "just break chase stop chasing 4head".
---
Jungle gyms are strong, and there are plenty of safe pallets or loops across nearly every map. When spawned in close proximity to each other because of map generation, which happens far more often than not, you can waste a very high amount of the killer's time. Hell, just even a single jungle gym can waste a lot of time by itself, easily allowing multiple gens to go up if the other survivors are working on them. The point was, a killer will comment on the ridiculous strength of the jungle gym and be met with "just break chase duud", but you'll never hear the killer or survivor say "after such a time of looping, just get downed. It's always one-sided. The killer always has to give up, break chase, or relinquish power. 
---
Thematically, this makes absolutely zero sense. How sad is it that a bloodthirsty murderer is stopped by a funky-shaped wooden structure with a window and a pallet strategically placed to waste several minutes of time when used in conjunction with nearby tiles.
---
Guess I spoke too soon
---
Time for a new friend imo
---
i just can't wait for these tile variants to also show up on Lampkin Lane
---
Is it in the files or something? Also, why was I notified of this lol?
---
Why DC against a killer that's perfectly balanced?
---
She plays rank 15. Just floats there really
---
Yeet, still Dc'ing
---
If he had valid criticism he would've posted that instead "it sucks".
---
Against a great nurse no chance. Killer is the most unbalanced in the game.
---
Freddy is pretty balanced now, before it was almost just unfair for Freddy players.
---
unless the killer forces you out the gate you should try
---
or NOED
---
I thought the perk was just badly designed for that reason.
---
Hmmm okay. I went against a rank 17.  What’s worse is that I was a rank 6, I felt so bad for them after I saw their rank xD.
---
Without Ruin, you need to force survivors to do things besides gens. 
---
With Legion, use your power to damage multiple people at once and forcing them to mend/heal.
---
If you down someone and see another survivor close by, consider slugging the downed guy and going for another chase.
---
In general, work on you mind games and ending chases faster so that you can constantly be hooking people. You want a quick cycle of:
---
1. Hook a survivor
---
2. Find new target with BBQ/discordance
---
3. Down and hook new survivor before or soon after the original hooked guy can be fully healed.
---
4. Repeat
---
This cycle will ensure that there are never more than 1-2 survivors working on gens for the majority of the match
---
It used to show a clear aura of the survivor through the veil. But for the last few patches it gets distorted and hardly works.
---
From other comments it seems like you don't have a clue about how to play him and what his add-ons are. I'd recommend learning a thing or two first before coming on here and getting all emotional.
---
Prayer Beads + NOED. Who hurt you?
---
Kept her cool better than some of the people I play with lol
---
The swf group in the match before 😂
---
tldr?
---
Jane is so hot ughhhh
---
Her three abilities are literally the definition of quality not quantity.
---
I’ll just let myself sit there and waste his time
---
slugging is never a strat for me, it's just a kinda thing that happens when things start to snowball
---
like i ain't going to hook when an injured/exposed survivor is right there
---
Perk: Good Grief
---
Effect: After being put into the injured state have a 30/40/50% chance of freezing time for the Killer for 1/2/3 seconds
---
sounds great ;) Ive established Im getting hag grabbing her ruin teahcable never playing her and go back to legion, very helpful might even play leatherface.
---
What about the Metro jacket?
---
I honestly hate how every time the DBD twitter posts, the replies are filled with people complaining
---
“Here” = on twitter instead of playing the game...?
---
Except it lessens your time on hook
---
Did they get rid of being able to put down fake pallets as the Nightmare? Also I don't understand the point of waking up when you're in dream world. He can hit you anyway when you're awake, so what's the point? Because of the dream traps?
---
Nah he needs to be reworked. Hopefully more of me complain enough to where he does get nerfed, call me a complainer or whatever, but it’ll happen 😊
---
He’s a M1 killer and is going to wind up in mid tier for sure again new killer is OP because you haven’t played against them yet to know their weak points and crutches
---
The game is slow. And thats a snail. Not a slug.
---
I just want to play the game. Like why should i try to make sure everybody gets a decent amount of points? I will prioritize injured survivors and will slug survivors to go after the survivor whose working on a generator. The one thing I don't do a lot of people would is go for an unhooked survivor immediately but I will still hunt them down if I can't find anybody quick enough. I just don't see any reason why I should follow those rules.
---
Please bhvr
---
There's a perk you can run called Small Game - gives and auditory noise when there's a totem (or killer trap) in front of you in a cone of 45degrees
---
Her power at base is fine, but she definitely needs an add on overhaul.
---
That is not what I am saying at all, what I am saying is that the game should not take away from me when someone leaves a game in progress
---
I guess I wasn't clear enough on that and that is my fault but don't get so pissed over nothing
---
I usually run dead rabbit with Tuft of hair. I like to use unnerving, distressing, infectious and ruin.
---
Like the survivors who stay?
---
I mean, this is the smallest "nerf" to her I could possibly imagine. It's not like she's gonna jump to F tier or something
---
How can they balance a game they’ve never played?
---
The survivors who play survivor during a new killers release or rework rather than trying said killer
---
Yeah but she shouldve never gotten nerfed in the first place, and it keeps happening
---
Looks at post...\*rusty brain gears turn 1 cog\*... D-Darn?
---
How come the patches for Xbox are always so big compared to PC and PS4? This one is 10.32 GB vs 1.2 GB for PC.
---
I run ruin, thrill of the hunt, iron grasp and the gen intervention perk. Plague is ez when you spam vomit until you break the survivor you are tunneling and then m1 and hook.
---
As stated....they face camped next to exit.
---
Rather than unhook blindly and leave killer to chase them and down them again, we got exit open first then went to unhook her so she could run straight to exit in front of her while we body blocked.
---
The issue was that we were doing the fake unhook so he wouldnt pull us off and would have to hit someone instead and someone could unhook safely during his recovery animation. I got hit doing the fake out and my friend tried to unhook her immediately after.
---
This made her target me for a heal instead of the unhook and rando got sacrificed then and there.
---
So it wasn't a matter of being unable to unhook her because of killer. We just had bad luck with how it happened.
---
????? Ok
---
The bloodweb needs a rework, once you reach a certain level you should only get purple and rarer items and such
---
I'm still relatively new to plague. Always used to  vomit then 2 smacks haha
---
Yeah . Me and my friends so far have no problem with the new freddy. He fun to go against. But its hard to play sometimes because ive had countless randoms leave because they see the timer count dow . Gets kinda frustrating.
---
i would agree but i got about half of them done in this hell system so them changing it now would be upsetting
---
I mean, they could've cleansed Dulls. The BP increase to cleansing might put NOED in a bit riskier of a spot now, tho.
---
Maybe, but I can see where BHVR is coming from with this change
---
So who gets the Woozle skin?
---
Surveillance is worth it
---
I don't think new freddy is op. I also think that the reason they nerfed mettle so hard is because of how free it was either of their previous ways. They really don't want hit negation to be super common and easy to achieve. If it was, the game would be unplayable for a lot of killers. When they rework a killer, survivor, perk ,etc. They try not to lose the core idea of the thing they reworked. Mettle's idea was to reward people for playing a certain way, the problem was everyone played that way. In it's current form it tries to award very altruistic survivors, which isn't worth it at all. But the main reason they struggle to find a middle ground, in my opinion is that when something is broken and needs adjusting, it's usually at high demand from a LOT of people.
---
What should he just fucking kill himself? Dbd devs are just pathetic and unprofessional smh.
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
Yea, I'm glad they at least gave us some Pajama pants and sweatshirts, I like the slight pizza thing like the logo on the back of the blue one
---
Yeah, if yoy have every killer teachable, it takes 250 bloodwebs to max them all, that like 5 million bloodpoints( getting a character to lvl 50 takes a million)
---
You overestimate the average player, my friend
---
I mean prayer beads are pretty OP in my opinion anyway
---
How the hell is this gonna help you vs nurse and billy? Sorry I refuse to believe spirit is that great definitely amazing killer but ya know
---
I played her for maybe ten or twenty hours trying to improve, the FPS drops when she blinks made her almost unplayable. So unless the devs have addressed this, I don't think she's close to viable.
---
Says the guy who strolls into my own post, tells me to GTFO, and says I’m flexing my “superiority” by saying kiddos. I guess you can’t fix stupid, eh?
---
Another boring m1 killer. Atleast he wont get as much hate because manchildren with 200 hours played him once and got bullied
---
u/KyleeTheSadist
---
There are players who DC against freddy instantly to try and get Behaviour to nerf him... It's ridiculous.
---
I’m relatively new to the game and this was super helpful thanks man. Do you happen to have one for other items? Add ons confuse me a bit but I got the basics down. I just don’t know what add ons are worthless for each item.
---
No killer is strong if you compare it to highly optimized rank 1 gameplay
---
Holy shit, those eyes are terrifying.
---
Rounding's a bitch
---
Michael comes out no where.  watch out watch out, ooooouh,  poor Amanda....

Crank it.
---
Oh that's nothin'. I camp with Leatherface.
---
Let me tell you, as someone who played both games religiously. You're not wrong about stealth but F13 had something that if DBD had it, much of the frustration from this community would be gone - individual player skill mattered. Sure, things were easier if there was teamwork, but if you had the skills, even if your team was messing up, you could survive on your own. Do an objective on your own, any of them minus the Jason kill. Or worst case scenario, you could juke and survive Jason for 20 minutes. In DBD this is not possible. You can be a master looper - so what, if the team isn't doing gens? It's all for nothing. You can be super efficient at doing gens and avoiding the killer - so what, if the rest of the team is doing nothing? You can't do it all yourself. If you get hooked, again, you have to rely on the team. They make a bad save? Too bad, you're fucked. I believe this is where 90% of the anger and frustration comes in our community, at least on Survivor side. Over reliance on the rest of the team because of how the game was designed. In Friday, teamwork was great, but if it wasn't happening, as long as you were good enough, you'd be rewarded for it and you could get by on your own. This is the one thing I wish DBD did similarly.
---
I am simple man.I see jojo
---
Maybe they will start doing this for all killers using there ability’s sorta like how bubba and hillbilly can’t do it with there power
---
Watch the example match I provided. None of what you said explains any of the survivors’ behaviour I’ve been seeing in recent games.
---
so does franklins no longer work on ambushes
---
My apologies, I should have paid more attention.
---
“Safe”
---
I think this one deserves the reply to.
---
"No, it's less than worthless!"
---
Yours makes sense this is just a new situation. We could use the nomenclature hiding perk instead of stealth perk?
---
is she sport?
---
Thats real mature calling someone stupid for disagreeing with you.
---
I'm just put off by too long queue as a killer..., I have limited time for gaming as is and waiting 6-10 minutes just to get one lobby is too much...
---
You can mindgame a thrown pallet. And i wont acctept old freddy was bad because i have had fun experiences playing him even at higher ranks, either way that wasnt the argument, the argument was how old freddy bennefits from overcharge compared to new freddy. Even if new freddy has gen TP and is better as a whole with it, that ability barely provides freddy with any extra advantage by useing the perk compared to straight up hit potential.
---
**_no no no no no you miss she sport not sport sport!!!!!!!!!!_**
---
But it has direct counter in Killer perk arsenal - Stridor. Suddenly, your Iron will is level one again.
---
I just play for like an hour everyday and always get all kills and 1 or two disconnects but am still at rank 17 I’ve only played for like 3 days tho
---
Come to think of it, Danny Glover is a cop in almost every role
---
Yeah, it's called masochism.
---
How does the shrine of secrets work?
---
Like for example, if enduring appears this week, is it possible to appear again next week? Or is there an amount of time that needs to pass before a perk appears again?
---
Its pointless man you are just too crazy skilled for this game so might as well quit.
---
If it really is that you can't one shot people who are exposed with the ambush attack, then think of this situation. You're opening an exit gate and you think the killer isn't nearby, but then you hear that the Pig is ambushing you. You can't really run anywhere in that time as the exit gates are in pretty open spaces

Why would do dc seems to happen a lot when I play new nightmare
---
the man said what he said
---
I mean u ain’t wrong, I do wonder how his bad games are like tho, he only puts in the good ones.
---
NOED is a must if they’re toxic.
---
Hey you earned my respect by not covering up and making excuses so I’ll upvote
---
Then go play survivor, bully the FUCK out of a killer, and let em kill you since you never see it happen
---
I'm rank 8. And yeah I try slugging a lot but it doesn't work well on some maps which makes it kind of a bad strat
---
Not unless he's fired!
---
&gt; I really think that in the right hands, doctor is definitely B or even A-tier
---
The problem is the majority of his power revolves around hitting skill checks, which really good survivors aren't affected by because they'll hit it anyway. Now, your power is only good to shut down a loop, and against good runners, that's a really tough thing to hit
---
Get better. Freddy is mid tier at best. Do you DC against Nurse, billy, and Spirit? Why not just uninstall the game at this point?
---
No camping unless there's scratch marks all over the place in which case ima be running very tight circles around the hook for a littlr while.
---
No tunneling, usually if I get face-unhooked I'll smack down the injured person and go after the saviour. I'm not about letting you just get away for free cuz you got farmed.
---
Slug when appropriate, but I don't do builds based around it.
---
 Game is the same, just quicker reactions.
---
Game settings then go far right. It will tell you there who was who at the end of the match.
---
We are getting fucked, thanks.
---
Look up while using it for best experience
---
Then you underestimate me
---
For dungeon crawler games anyways I don’t think that most story based video games need to have replayability however when your game revolves around replaying the game to get more loot then yeah.
---
You mean like the "DS rework/fix" which took like a year to implement?   
---
Bhrv are certainly not "favoring" killers.
---
Hol up.
---
Pallet freddy is literally useless. Who the hell is complaining about pallet Freddy?
---
Not lunge. They mean her dash attack doesn’t count as a basic attack. So the roar and charge move piggy does from stealth won’t instadown.
---
Having Survivors 360 and not having a fast enough tilt on the analog stick that matters to counter them is a small problem that does matter in a chase, so I agree.
---
Her hiker/backpacking outfit &gt;&gt;&gt;
---
What does scripting do in dbd?
---
I understand that and I also accept it if I was looping the killer. Why should they give me a chance to do it again? Lol
---
Ambush, not lunge
---
That’s what I was thinking, if it was true that they changed the stories.
---
Dawww. Literal baby meg.
---
Deserved it for teabagging the other survivors?
---
Fuck yeah, dude! I love Left 4 Dead. I haven’t played in a while but I’m gonna hop on and try it out.
---
If my build at the time or circumstances call for it, then I'll absolutely proxy camp/face camp/slug/tunnel. The **only** rule that I'll follow is that I won't taunt anyone who didn't taunt me first. I do see face camping as a sort of taunting, and so I'll actually try to avoid face camping unless other survivors force me to do it by circling the hook like vultures.
---
All those other tactics though, I don't see them as taunting. They may be really powerful and therefor unfun for the losing side, but that's just how this game and most other competitive games are. I define taunting as doing something that has *no ot her* function other than to taunt the other side. Something like gesturing at the killer, tbagging, running back into the killers field of view just to instaheal, flashlight clicking.
---
Things I *don't* count as taunting: Flashlighting at pallets, waiting at a pallet for the killer (despite it being a dumb idea), bodyblocking to save your team. If you do anything I consider to be taunting though, I'm happy to slug and watch you bleed out just for the satisfaction of it
---
40 000 damn you ain't gonna spend any on outfits lol?
---
Not very much. This change was to keep the consistency that power attacks aren't affected by exposure. Just like her terror radios change.
---
I'm still updating my game, lol! Never thought I'd go out of my way to get downed and carried, but now I have to know what it sounds like. 😅👍🏼
---
Omg you’re awesome lmfao. I knew I wasn’t that crazy
---
The problem with noed is it punishes everybody but swf who cleanse totems.
---
I find ti cute that you treat survivors like they are all different characters... they just look different playing a survivor is shit easy once you have the teachables unlocked that are all the same!
---
u/ms_claymore u/Ps4_and_Ipad_Lover This would be a cool banner don't you think?
---
You had me at your counterplay ideas because they indeed work.
---
You lost me at "omegalul" when you started to be some generic twitch normie.
---
Play survivor, find a match with a killer who has no addons outside of tan ranks. Every killer runs them always. So when you play against a killer, they will always have add ons
---
Nurse, hag is with nea
---
This is so true that it hurts
---
Yeah if the world starts collapsing around you, what option do you have but to run to the next area? Even if you don't choose to run towards it and let the eatth collapse around you, the Entity could just drop you in the Trial anyway
---
The grind really is terrible at times.
---
We all hate the game but we're here for some reason
---
"There are some issues with survivor gameplay."
---
"Nerf killers."  
---
\*Gets upvotes\*  
---
And all these sheep don't believe me that this subreddit has a survivor bias.
---
My favorite meme
---
Give me a scene where someone attempts to "loop" for a while, then the killer stabs them really deep. When they start to complain, the killer says something like "What, you thought I had to hit you twice or something?"
---
i always viewed her as the athlete lesbian beach goer/sport player type. wearing labels, athleisurewear, dresses that are tom boy but show the body she worked hard for, that kind of girl, you may know the type.
---
Add ons are still not base kit tho. When overall judging a killers strength you have to consider base kit and with add ons. It proves that no one cares for his base kit because the person who made the original post didn’t even mention the snares
---
I cannot recommend picking up Save the Best for Last enough, especially for M1 killers. It makes the absurdly long cool-down time after a successful hit much shorter, and thus helps stop the bullshit survivors can do during that time because you can go after them much faster.
---
That situation is not going to happen once the servers are out, they've said they will introduce a husk of the DCd survivor so that you can hook them.
---
I hope they will also give some bonus points to the teammates of the DCd survivor, as they lose out on a lot of points too when that happens.
---
This goes for every killer or survivor perk:
---
At levels 30, 35 and 40 there will appear a red icon on the Bloodweb with the name of one of their teachable skills buy that with bloodpoints from that moment on you can find that skill in other Killer or survivor bloodwebs.
---
Rank 8 killer and I versed rank 15-20s earlier. The matchmaking is flaw in so many ways. Sure easier games but less satisfaction.
---
Yeah, you have to work much harder than purple ranks.
---
Ok you're going off topic now and I don't see much point in talking to you anymore. Have a nice day.
---
I'm actually really sad Claudette hasn't gotten amy science based cosmetics like a lab coat or safety goggles + charred dirty clothes.
---
They don't really have much game merch yet so I'm not expecting a film to happen. 
---
They really need to partner with McFarlane or NECA and get some action figures on the market for their original killers.
---
If the killer has to gain Bloodlust 1-3 to gain a hit this is STILL BAD for the killer with 20+ pallets arrounds.
---
If the killer is getting you because he's at Bloodlust lll this allready means that you've outplayed him good enough (or you're using the survivor favoring game design like easy loopable spots like Ironworks).
---
It baffles me how many people here go like: "Survivors will lose the game because killers will just bloodlust at every pallet."  
---
Yes, if the killer would have 20 minutes to win this would be a problem.
---
This should be implemented
---
Most people don’t cleanse so they don’t give you your power. Maybe Thanatophobia?
---
To be fair, I'm pretty sure survivor sounds are made more quiet when they're in a locker now.
---
Freddy has a large hitbox for reason it's also apparent when you look how he gets stunned by pallets when they aren't even touching him or even get close sometimes, so it's only logic that his hitbox is just as big when he lunges for a strike. It's not really a big, it's just a bad hitbox size because he's skinny, the trapper and myers have the same hitbox but they are beefcakes so it doesn't show so hard.
---
This ^ I want my own nurse to sit on my desk with me as motivation while I blink 10000 times to down a survivor.
---
Or maybe it's not new and I'm just an idiot. Who knows.
---
at this point i'm not sure they have a competent in house or outsourced play testers, then the ptb they don't seem to listen. 
---
Also seems pretty killer sided which may be to keep lobbies because if it was balanced as some people suggest to i don't the killer type would even play, resulting in an Evolve like collapse of the game. 4v1 is hard.
---
It's baffling that we still have no changes to hit boxes, dire need of map fixes and reshuffling, low tier killer buffs, ebony mori, insta heal etc
---
They could separate it from Freddie by having rift points on the map, and survivors who aren't in the upside down have to look out for flickering lights to know that there's a survivor who needs a rift opened.
---
I wish her RBTs worked with end game collapse..
---
Glad to see you are a useless player
---
What he say i couldnt hear it lol
---
Is tunnelling going after the same person? If so what if I come across that person constantly, I'm not going to just ignore them
---
In another language
---
Increases your atk speed
---
cool name
---
There was a video posted either here or on Youtube I had seen showing it from both survivor and killer perspectives. Ace, Claudette, and I think Kate were the quietest. Jeff and Jane though, no surprise, were the loudest.
---
Whats M1 stand for
---
As long as they keep the bulge.
---
Btw you didn't change teachable to killers to survivors
---
The killer isnt even near, their just teabagging each other.
---
If you blind the killer, you have to die first hook
---
Mouse 1. It's the standard, basic attack for any killer that they do when you left click to hit a survivor.
---
"Are we going to be here.. all day?"
---
What did they do to my girl?
---
Freddy
---
"Killers haven't been receiving nerfs for years!"  
---
\*They implement more safe pallets\*  
---
"Well this isn't a nerf to killers!"  
---
\*Every other survivor agreeing on it\*
---
This is why I hate this subreddit.
---
That's not og canon

What’s the actual new Black Box?
---
This
---
Ghostface. He's funny to look at
---
I like the pallet token concept. scoops ahoy is a perk ive thought about myself. its a nice concept.
---
^. one small thing. the eye in the babysitter icon would indicate its an aura reading ability
---
Gay
---
I was an OG Freddy main when he first came out but then I gave up on him but now this rework changes everything
---
It really sucks but be the change you want to see in this world. I always try to be pleasant in my games and because of that I rarely see toxicity post-game and everyone seems to be nice (:
---
* If I die as survivor I'll compliment the killer 
---
* If we barely escaped I'll say it was a close one and a fun game
---
* if we demolished the killer I'll kindly give them hints and say it was a good game
---
And as killer
---
* I usually give the last person hatch
---
* if I can tell they are solo and the others are farming the person I'll let them escape / give them a redo
---
* I don't facecamp or tunnel, and if I'm stomping them and someone is on last hook I'll just down them and leave so their buddies can get them up
---
Do I have to do this? No! Do you have to? Absolutely not! But 9/10 games everyone is so kind and chatty at the end and I rarely see toxicity! 
---
Does this all help? Who knows, but I like to tell myself it does 😛
---
Occasionally I run BT, but when I switch it out...sometimes I forget.🤷‍♂️
---
We need more Mao Mao memes
---
Shirtless myers
---
I don’t think thanatophobia is very strong. I think pop is a better alternative.
---
I’m using it to assist in getting wounded healer. Also used it to get Adept David. That’s it.
---
I've noticed this. Many of the new pallet loops are shorter, while still being safe.
---
Also, why does Badham 1 still exist? It has an awful layout, especially now that there are about 24 pallets. 
---
Yesterday, I had a situation where there were 2 Survivors working on a gen by Killer shack. They had the God pallet, a safe pallet next to the gen, the 1 storey house and the 2 storey house all within safe distance.
---
*happy pig noises*
---
We need bunny clown and shirtless feng!
---
As far as I know, broken pallets always leave scattered pieces of blue wood. Unless dream pallets erase them, then you should be able to utilize this tip. Keep an eye out and lmk
---
Fundamental flaw in how the game is designed. Map pressure is very strong so killers that have it will be named op by most survivor players because of how difficult they make the game, map pressure and anti loop tech means even more survivors screaming. 
---
If they don't have map pressure they get gen rushed and seem incredibly weak especially those most susceptible to being looped.
---
Freddy is super fun and Myers too
---
Yo lightborn is way better than most people give it credit for. 
---
Whenever a survivor drops a pallet and tries to flashlight me, I love stabbing them. You can see the fear and confusion in their eyes the moment before hitting them when they realize “hey! This flashlight is not working O_O!!!”
---
I’m usually at 18...
---
I’m not a noob..I’m just smart
---
Me, getting facecamp : It’s a date, then. Hope you call me later❤️
---
I still feel this is fairer than the killer rule book
---
You will encounter all sorts of survivors at all different ranks.
---
The Shape would make a great movie
---
It's not too big, but still noticebale (still tremendously uneeded and seemingly for no reason), made her ambush attack not count as a basic attack. This breaks some synergy with perks and possibly(?) breaks a few add-ons but I haven't played as her since the patch so idk about that part.
---
On one hand as a pig main, I don’t think any of the recent pig “‘nerfs” Were all that bad, this new one was maybe to increase deviousness?? I think. But people have been asking for pig buffs for a while now. Even her buff in December wasn’t all that great. I think her power is fine and doesn’t need to be touched in its current state but her add ons definitely need changing.
---
Prayer beads need to be pink that's all I care about tbh
---
D3 = One of the best recent ARPGs out there?  
---
Are you serious?  
---
Every big D3 guy jumped the ship and is playing PoE by now.
---
shit u rite
---
Omg that scream then a straight face
---
For some reason, this community, that used to be completely toxic both with other players and with the devs' efforts, and got me leaving the game some time ago, is becoming wholesome. Glad I'm back and I'll see you in the fog, probably hooked by my hand!
---
An hour ago. Rank 10. Tunneled the entire game until finally hooked and then stared at me for the rest of the game. Thank you The Pig. I hope you had fun because I didn’t.
---
Agreed. Piggy has some of the worst add-ons in the game. Even her ultra rares are terrible.
---
10/10 best comment. Would updoot again
---
You can be blinded from anywhere in your FOV
---
You are attracted to Daddy Doc?
---
Or the Pig can just stand up before she hits you and use a basic M1. Most people do that more than ambushing anyway (unless it's to mindgame loops).
---
Here is the simple guide for noobs for telling if a killer is OP. Is the killer better than Nurse? Yes..............Most prob needs a nerf. No.............Its not OP. Easy :-)
---
Lol I feel you should find a easier game or something you more understand.
---
Thanks for that link.
---
Yes, they did mention some numbers how it might be. But thats just makes it more puzzling to me, why they cant put them into the description in the patchnotes.
---
I wish Ash said “I think we did a pretty good... job so far” when he completed a gen
---
Anyone but legion, plague, nurse and spirit. Huntress can actually be a lot of fun to play against because you can mind-game her hatchets.
---
I have a few things to say about this.
---
First, a bit of background, I run a Stealth Myers build ([https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/773974904470598419/6D7DF2A824317D60FF66F5A433A56A7C3D081229/](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/773974904470598419/6D7DF2A824317D60FF66F5A433A56A7C3D081229/) for build), this means I am far weaker then most killer builds, especially since I lack the materials to run it properly (I am working to get Monitor and Abuse for 0 terror radius Myers), I still love it for the sheer utility it provides, more on that later.
---
I usually don't facecamp, I usually don't slug, but I DO tunnel within reason, more on that later.
---
The reason I do not do these things is not an ethical reason, I've given up on the ethics of survivors long ago (few too many killer-abuse incidents), my reason is purely pragmatic. I'll break it down for you:
---
**Camping in the gen phase is tantamount to suicide**, especially for slow Myers where you need to always be on the move to counter your stupidly slow nature (you are only 5% faster then a sprinting survivor, and slower then a boosted survivor), you camp someone and you will get 4 gens popped like it's nothing, so that's right out. 
---
The only time it's worth it to camp the hooks is if you are monitoring multiple generators from your position (which is uncommon or extremely rare) or managing a multi-hook (such as hooking 2 or more people extremely close to one another, or basement with 2 or more). At this point you have half the team (or more!) on lockdown,  and the survivors will focus all their efforts on getting them back, even if they don't they will have far fewer gens completed before the two survivors die (1-2 at most, killing 2 survivors for 2 gens sounds like a fair tradeoff)
---
**Slugging is directly contrary to this build,** due to having mad grit and franklin's demise I only stand to gain from having a survivor carried, any attempts at bodyblocking will at worst fail 100% of the time and at best lead to more downed survivors. Because of this Slugging is just useless to me.
---
**Tunneling is something I avoid doing** UNLESS it's to punish unsafe wall hooks or to prioritize injured survivors, as a slow Myers the less people I have to worry about, the better, so it stands to reason that it works in my favor to kill as many people as possible.
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
Now here comes the big "BUT". In the exit gate and collapse phase, I drop those rules completely, here's the breakdown:
---
Misery loves company, and hooked survivors are something that survivors WILL go back for almost always, especially with survive with friends, as a slow myers I'll ***never*** catch up to the exit gate in time to do anything to them, so if I have one hooked I am going to plop my ass down and wait for them to come to me. If they don't come to me, they'll escape, and I'll still get the kill, is it toxic? Maybe, but it's not a foolproof strategy (as a 3 man swarm will easily bodyblock more then enough blows to escape even the toughest obstacles) so that helps make it seem far less toxic then it could be.
---
Slugging is still directly contrary to this build, as if I needed even more reason not to slug, slugged people can escape too!
---
Tunneling injured or last hook survivors is vital to securing some kills in the endgame phase, as stated earlier you're not fast enough to get to the gate before the survivors can open it, so you need to focus on what you have and leave with whatever you have.
---
All that being said, I love my build, it's not overpowered or "meta", but it compliments Myers' strengths so well that it is viable, at least until you get to rank 10 or less, then you're just fucked, 
---
since Myers (ESPECIALLY TIER 1 MYERS) is basically a worse ghostface (ghostface is faster, confers exposed faster, has no terror radius WITHOUT THE USE OF PERKS, has arguably better perks, can crouch and actually be stealthy, and **actually has skins worth a damn**), I feel justified in using these fair yet brutal tactics, after all, the survivors have every option they need to beat me, but I don't have every option I need to defeat them.
---
Lithe for survivors and STBFL for killers (especially if you play legion)
---
the issue isn't ruin, it's the fact that you can't play without it.
---
The lower in the ranks you go the harder it gets, playing killer is easy at first then makes you wanna kill yourself later on
---
DC = a kill by the killer in my eyes
---
Your first comment wasnt even mature at all dude.
---
Nurse, because on console 98% of people that play her are shit lol
---
Sure does
---
If you're on PS4 I found out the other day that pressing the trackpad button is a shortcut for turning the Y axis inversion on/off. If you're Xbox I'm sure there's a similar button.
---
This is me listening to the Myers song when I select him but then I feel sad because it isnt constant like the other killer's songs. :(
---
As someone who has conquered all Adept Killer achievements, I vouch pulling rabbit out of your ass while hooking is 100% accurate. 
---
My asshole looks like a sewer now
---
Literally all of your comments are you hating on new freddy lmao
---
Ash looks like ben's uncle from Ben 10 lmao
---
Dream Pallets erase them.
---
Didn't the devs say that when dedicated servers are out DCing survivors will leave a"husk" behind that you can hook? Sounds good to me.
---
The problem with  Billy camping isnt that hes camping, its that the killer is playing extremely bad if he IS camping with Billy. Billy is meant to roam. Do you know how triggering it is to see someone camp with Billy? Choose a different character to do that you dumbass.
---
That's not true, I've Q'd with many low ranks as R1 and gotten low ranked killers with myself as the lobby maker
---
If you let them get to you, you're just screwing yourself over. You're only going to entertain them further by raging at them post-game.
---
If a survivor's taunting you, just remember that they're only one mind game away from getting downed. If they're too good for you, just forge them and find someone else instead of letting them loop you, that doesn't mean they win.
---
If a Leatherface is facecamping you, check to see if your team is doing anything useful. If they're just crouching around watching you get camped, honestly just die on the hook and move on to the next game. If they're doing gens, consider staying on the hook and punishing LF for camping, if you feel like it. Ofcourse you're not obligated to do that for your team if you don't feel like it, people forget that this is an "every man for himself" type of game and if you're not having fun, you shouldn't feel obligated to stick it out.
---
I just explained why it works that way, but ok...
---
They aren’t. You just perceived it that way. They’re going down.
---
I seriously am astonished how lucky he is, I love his videos but man he always finds the worst potatoes to play against.
---
Except it doesn't actually *do* anything.
---
Each survivor in the dream state reduces Freddy's gen teleport ability cooldown by 15%
---
I play how I want but I usually try to not tunnel or camp whenever possible, if survivors have done all of the gens and I haven’t gotten a kill I’ll camp just in hopes of securing 1 or even 2 kills if the others go for them.
---
Yes sir
---
I’m glad I was so important to you that you went through my record 😘 you spend time out of your life to study me, fucktard
---
How you certain YOUR not perceiving them that way hmmm?
---
Old Freddy main here, new Legion main here. I prefer to have the odds stacked against me.
---
Damn you got me
---
Ive played 10 games today they all Been iron works or rotten Field
---
Because it gives her corrupt purge.  That's why the best strategy against plague is not to cleanse.
---
Ace is the quietest survivor and can barely be heard unless the killer is listening very closely. Kate is the quietest female but not the 2nd quietest overall. I don't remember what order they're all in in terms of quietness,
---
I love it the game feels more complete to be honest
---
Like I said, people need to adapt and learn instead of bitching for a nerf.
---
Imagine complaining about getting cosmetics for your main almost every patch because they aren't "good enough".
---
Gavin this is *u mom* i require s u s t e n e n c e
---
Nothing is confirmed, just speculation based on some tweets.
---
*stridor approaches*
---
I would say go for the killers over buying individual perks. Personally I only used it if their was a perk for someone locked behind a pay wall like a licensed killer. At least when you get a killer you can have fun with them as well as get 3 new perks. Honestly getting 300,000 bp is not that difficult if your playing killer especially as you usually get quite a few offerings to boost bp. 
---
If you like Billy spirit fury and enduring is a good combination so you can eat those pallets. Although ruin, especially when your high ranked, is very useful to slow the game down just a little bit. Monitor and abuse is also a great perk for sneaking up on people. 
---
You won't be able to get Myers with shards because he is a licensed killer although he is very fun even if his perks aren't the best.

I've only gotten it once and it was because the ash decided to start searching jigsaw boxes when he was at 70% timer
---
Shut up and take my money. 
---
Oh wait. Never mind. BHVR would never possibly release something so epic. A DLC character with only good perks? Hell naw. 
---
*cries in Ash*
---
You must be new here.
---
It's a speculation. [Netflix announced on Twitter that they're working with BHVR on an upcoming project](https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1138903234356006912?s=19) (probably Stranger Things-related), to which [Mathieu Cote, **Head of partnerships** and Game director at Behaviour Digital inc, replied with "Oh hi!"](https://twitter.com/MCote_BHVR/status/1139030572871950337). IIRC, someone also found a sound file in the DbD game files that fits the Stranger Things theme.
---
Nothing has been confirmed so far though.
---
As usual only one or two perks are worth getting.
---
Lithe or STBFL is what you should get, maybe lightborn as well because of flashlight blinds bloodpoint gain has been increased.
---
I would roughly say you will notice a rise in diffculty once you start playing against survivors 10 or lower. Red ranks can be very frustrating and difficult especially if you face an SWF. To give you an example as Billy your probably used to just revving up the chainsaw and hitting most people because they run in a straight line and don't look behind them. Once you progress higher people will be able to juke and loop you for a while until you get good at mindgaming pallets and loops.   
---
If your interested check out a twitch streamer or youtuber because they often play for hours on end so are very good compared to most.
---
How do you know there is a sale?
---
Im taking a break until it gets a fix, I could care less if i actually escape, but i keep getting yellow ranks who either DC on first down or all 3 teamates are dead before i finish 1 gen lol
---
Okay, thanks
---
If they're wearing flourescent body suit then they're really trying to get you to stare at them, it's simple facts and logic.
---
Would you mind if I add your **Window Tech** description to our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary)? :)
---
I don't have to eat many pallets, because breaking pallets with the chainsaw counts as a stun.
---
I already have myers.
---
bEHAVIOUR: " well, what about 'adorably idiotic Dwight?'
---
Doctor
---
*When you finally catch that survivor that's not being toxic at all*
---
**I camp your ass!**
---
why
---
Also some of Freddy's add-ons only affect you in the dream, their are some that will slow down survivor actions like old Freddy did.
---
Lithe is a very good exhaustion perk and STBFL is an A tier perk for all M1 killers. What do you mean
---
Right, thanks for the info
---
I love Steve and these perk ideas are actually amazing, 100% my playstyle I would main him if he came into the game like this! Good job :D
---
Finally, some delicious fucking meme.
---
we need more ace attorney memes, please.
---
You gain tokens by hitting survivors. Each token decreases your successful attack cooldown by 5% up to 40%. If you hit your obsession you lose 2 tokens. This perk is super good for M1 killers. It allows you to chain attacks quicker
---
You have a name to censor under your amount of BP btw
---
Thanatophobia, thrilling tremors, devour hope and haunted ground.
---
that's me with the new left 4 dead achievement it sounds impossible
---
I enjoy this game but definitely don't know where placements should be and to my knowledge there's no menu/tutorial to learn this.
---
Is there any in game indicator that a pallet could be fake? Does it flicker/bleed/something?
---
r/expectedmathieucote
---
Is it possible yo learn this power?
---
Thats the problem. Its already maxed out, its the reason why i sometimes get 360'd.
---
Really puts into perspective who is at the end of my weapon. I vow to be more gentle.
---
Dislike first perk as you have it.  Should be 10% per token and 1/2/3 imo.  30% wiggle isn't necessarily going to guarantee a wiggle off, but at least you aren't wasting 5 or 6 pallets(or more) to get it.
---
Second perk I think 15/20/25 would be better for a clean 100% on a 4 man escape.
---
For the third perk if you did it while injured would it down you or be unusable while injured?
---
Right now I main Ghostface. I run some pretty basic perks since I'm kinda low level on Ghostface and don't have many teachables, but Ruin, thrilling tremors, unrelenting, and deerstalker
---
Swf
---
Myers, he definitely is the one that can jump scare me best.
---
The shrine is random, so if Enduring appears in the Shrine and you don't have it, it's not a bad idea to buy it.Because it might be a while until it appears again
---
Legion is very fun for me at least
---
myers always
---
Its never to late. Youll be matched with other noobie survivors so you should be fine
---
Original Harry Warden would be so cool. And have a map whete it's down in a mine shaft
---
Same. For the people not being camped, it gives them ample amount of time to get alot of work done on gens(usually, 1 or 2 gens are done before a camped survivor expires) if they know you're being camped, and aren't throwing themselves at the killer in a vain attempt to save you.
---
Take my money already
---
interesting
---
Im disturbed for life.
---
Not at all, the game has a ranking system so you will be paired with new players for the first few games at least, unless your rank was high the last you played, but still, go ahead and have fun! 👍🏼
---
It's so easy to get a free hit on a survivor that's super desperate for a flashlight or pallet save. If you catch em at a good time, theyll be in whacking distance once your done dropping the other one.
---
Probably pig
---
this has happened before too, its not just this update
---
should they  though? There's legitimate reasons to hardcamp someone, the current punishment to chaser is fine and survs could you know, just win because it's given to them on a silver plate?
---
Hillbilly with them curves! 🙌🏼
---
Devour Hope tier 100: The hex totem spawns in an unreachable location. If a survivor locates the totem, all 5 tokens are gained immediately.
---
#FBI OPEN UP!
---
And also if q times are slower it might just match you with whoever.
---
Played my first killer game today with rank 20, level 1 doctor.
---
Hooked everyone once, two of them twice and did some sparkyboii stuff.
---
At the end I got flamed by a rank 13 that I'm an idiot and noob camper.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
It's a fair critique. She could get something else instead of the same thing over and over.
---
David
---
*gets hooked*
---
It's not very obvious in the video, but i was frozen i place
---
I've started playing PoE after D2 and D3 and it's just soooo much better.
---
You should show her the way of becoming an exile.
---
Wraeclast needs her. :&gt;
---
THANK YOU for having the right attitude. New killer play style = survivors must find new counter play style. It’s exciting as someone who plays both sides to have to “reinvent” games as or against Freddy
---
They say next reworks are leatherface,nurse and doc so no its not the case
---
gachiGASM YES SIR
---
Doctor, Plague, Hag, Clown, Nurse &amp; Trapper. I like Killers who have powers with consequence for the Survivor, not just a way to one-hit down (excluding Killer Add-ons of course). One-hit downs, I feel, shouldn't even be in the game as it breaks the momentum and fun that's only possible from a long drawn out game -- there's nothing wrong with having all or most Survivors on death hook with 2 Gens left, that's a solid game which gets everyone decent points, and sacrificing them all at that point or onward is a GG. What's the obsession with 4K a.s.a.p like the Entity is going to spank your Killer ass for not rushing??? LOL! 
---
PS : Sorry for the rant, it just got me thinking about the reasons why I like going up against those Killers I chose.
---
New Freddy, Myers, Clown, Ghostface always give me a fun time it seems.
---
I get accused of tunnelling all the time, never done it intentionally, why would you when Decisive Strike exists and doing so lowers your momentum and map pressure?  
---
Camping I'll do anytime a survivor is a toxic piece of shit however.  
---
I'd prefer not to due to loss of BP, but some fuckers need to be put in their place.
---
You think Steve wouldn't scare the piss out of the killers?
---
Nah, good spot
---
Current legion, Piggy and billy without isntasaw. Maybe plague too. Can’t wait to see if new freddy is fun to vs as well.
---
It still is highly lucky to get 100% potatoes in games he puts on YouTube every single/alternate days day given his ranks. In my region players in yellow rank do better than what he faces in purple ranks
---
I always pet the horse
---
Tbh, I quite like it. I think it syncs well with the fear of being one-shot downed.
---
A lot actually. It basically makes it completely useless now. Before you could commit to it because the reward was there: NOED, Franklin's, any perk that applies on hit. That was worth the risk of the lunge (the risk being that missing the hit has a long cooldown) Now you should never, ever ambush. Just uncrouch and catch them off guard, they have been snipping off bits and pieces of the pig for months. Now she is a neat little bonsai, cute to look at but not much actually there.
---
Playing killer can be stressful but remember to just have fun and learn, don't be too hard on yourself. GF can definitely help you at being fun to play DBD, but is also tricky to play him.
---
At the beginning you will play with newbies, but as you progress (easy as killer to rank up) you will find it challenging as survivors also derank on purpose to mess with new killers. It sucks but that's how you get better, learn their mindset.
---
Tips for GF:
---
* He is easy to get looped, so make sure in time to invest bloodpoints in any perk that helps you here: Bamboozle, Enduring, Spirit Fury or Brutal Strength
---
*He gets easily gen rushed because he lacks map pressure - you'll need Ruin hex
---
*Always stay hidden and stalk from behind cover (that's his purpose and that's how you expose them faster)
---
*Never fall for the clearly skilled survivor that's taunting you to follow him/her by spamming their flashlight at you. Know when to give up on a chase
---
*Mind-gaming them at pallets - they will loop you like there is no tomorrow. Get in stalk mode and crouch around to stalk them and do that until they are exposed. Hide from them so they don't reveal you.
---
It's overwhelming yes, but not at your current rank. Just have fun for the moment, cause the game can be so entertaining as killer.
---
No problem and thank you for taking the time to write this all up!
---
Myers is great. Huntress is fun to play against because she's unique and the way you play against her changes depending on how good the player is. Nurse is fun to play against if it's a map with an abundance of LoS breakers, lots of opportunities to mindgame as survivor and feel immediately rewarded. Billy's pretty fun, his map control makes for some good tension.
---
Not a fan of new Freddy, the "microsleep" is absolutely silly. It's luck-based (the Freddy player gets a harder chase if he flickers into existence at the wrong time, the survivor has to guess if you don't see him flicker) and it's not fun getting legitimately no indicator whatsoever where the killer is if you get unlucky. And there's just a mishmash of mechanics surrounding him that I just can't convince myself to give the slightest fuck about.
---
I don't think it's overkill, sure, bond can show you how a teammate is beign chased near you so you don't leave the gen, but spine chill will help you in all the other situations, making you escape from a chase before it starts, and if you are in lower ranks your teammates will die sooner so the first thing I said is gonna happen less often. And that's other thing, bond get better and better when you rank up because your teammates will be doing better plays
---
Iron will can be interesting in low ranks also because if you don't run selfcare and you can't be healed by other person because they are dead (wich happens more often in low ranks), you have a better chance to escape by the hatch by not being spotted easily. Maybe in lower ranks killer doesn't pay much attention to sounds in chases and that would be a reason to not run iron will (but I'm sure they will hear you and start a chase), but it can be also good with spine chill, even if you are injured and you know the killer is coming near you, if you are injured you can still neak up almost as if you were healed. When I face low rank killers I swap balanced landing for Decisive Strike if that helps you. But yeah, I would use (and I use) iron will even in low ranks when the rank reset happen every 13th, but keep in mind that I can afford that because I know how to loop, even if the killer sees me I have a second plan, but I guess if you run spine chill would be rare if the killer finds you if you start moving in the right moment
---
you're\*
---
monkaS where is she?
---
I knew you would say that man.
---
That's why I said NO beforehand lol
---
But I'm joking ofc, if she'll ask for another diablo-like, PoE will be first I'll answer
---
Its not just boring its fucking unfair. Plus boring for the other survs, I mean, doing gens and not even having to worry about the killer isnt really the moat fun thing.
---
*Laughs in ace"
---
Babysitter is absolutely op, having a  permanent pre-nerf borrowed time will make stopping saves impossible
---
hey we still got a month left
---
Does Small Game work against dream pallets?
---
I never look at survivor’s cosmetics. I just kill. I like looking good as survivor tho
---
I bought it
---
Myers and Ghostface. Constant uneasiness and checking your surroundings makes the game what it should've been. The chases with GF are definitely entertaining.
---
And I can't say how many times I got jump scared by these 2. Extra points for that.
---
Nurse. I'm only around purple ranks because I don't play often and I'm on console, but it's so satisfying juking her blinks.
---
I was quite dissapointed at first. Just check the add-ons after a game where you can see that some of them allows him to stalk if he is far enough.
---
The charge time and the and crouch time are going to be about the same, but you literally gain nothing by ambushing. There is no benefit to  Ambushing instead of  uncrouching.  Using her power and loops is not the right way, the   Ambush is too telegraphed, and not controllable enough. Ambush is not viable in  Any situation.   The  Devs  Seem to hate the pig apparently.
---
Batter Up is very underpowered
---
Babysitter probably doesnt give enough reward to be worth running
---
Scoops Ahoy is great
---
At least evolve wasn't a laggy mess that actually had viable hitboxes...
---
I dont camp, I dont purposely tunnel, but I do slug. Camping is just stupid and not even a viable strategy, tunneling is unfair and boring, but slugging sometimes is just necessary to win and doesnt really make it unfair. I dont choose whom I slug, I slug whomever I found and downed. I cant take people complaining about slugging serious, because they obviously seem to not play killer, at least not in a competitive way. And about tunneling: If I go back to the hook and only see the unhooked one, why should I waste my time looking for the otherone? If I see the other one as well, I will go for him, dontcha worry.
---
DS doesn’t only trigger when tunneling. 60 seconds is a long time.
---
Or just make him faster in feral and slower out of it. Too many people just M1 with him now...
---
Bro you have never seen a good pig if you believe her Ambush is not meant for mind games. Check out Scorpionz on Twitch he will easily show you the right way to use a pig.
---
I hardly play killer anymore because it amazes me how I can piss off someone while not doing anything toxic at all. Just by being the killer.
---
I once scored 31,400 points and was called trash because I used Thantnaphobia. No camping, no tunneling. I was going out of my way to hook everyone equally. It's not my fault his team wasn't that great. They all managed about 15,000 points too, which I consider good, especially when I am solo surviving.
---
Did you hit or miss tho
---
I hate camping but I'll patrol an area close by if you were toxic, far enough away that you can get saved but close enough that I'll find you if you sprint away. I'm trying to win, so I mean I'll leave if its beneficial to me which is 90% of the time considering I need to put pressure elsewhere on the map
---
Is the first definition ironic? If not how in the world do 360’s take skill lmao?
---
Pig. I love the suspense of the timer ticking down/searching the boxes. Plus she scares me every time
---
*cough* Nurse *cough* Spirit
---
I agree to get adept survivor you can let your teamates do the work while you can sit in the corner and do nothing until exit gates are open for killer you basically have to get iridescent on every category
---
pretty much, actually. yeah.
---
ah, finally. someone who gets it!
---
The intent was to cover the phrases terms and abbreviations used by players, rather than a glossary of mechanics.
---
"Top tier in red ranks" Say that to those 90% of people only playing spirit and Billy.
---
The dash is the best part about the pig. With it you can shut down a lot of loops other killers could not. If you threw her away just because you couldn't learn to use her dash right and relied on the her slightly higher endgame pressure that is not needed with endgame collapse now. I can conclude the you were just bad at playing her.
---
No it took them  2-3 more weeks after Xbox got it for PS4 . It was a complete shitshow
---
Not sure about the 3 weeks part, but like I said it's random.A great example is BBQ&amp;Chili. That perk only appeared 3 times and it definately wasn't 3 weeks apart either. There are some perks that appear more often than others.
---
Then y tf does Jane moans everytime I hit her lol
---
Lmfao
---
"I think I'll use bloody party streamers this game"
---
It's so annoying, I don't see how people get enjoyment from camping, ruins it for everyone.
---
Most builds will run one tracking perk, so if Spies is all you have then that's the one you should be running. In terms of "free" tracking perks, your options are -
---
* Spies is an exact ping on a non-hooked survivor at good range - but doesn't work if the survivor is crouching or running Calm Spirit.
---
* Bitter Murmur lights up everyone around a completed Generator, the downside is that it costs you a generator and that slower killers may not be able to capitalise on the tracking until the game is effectively over (e.g. survivors defeated your attempt at a 3-gen).
---
* Whispers lights up when a survivor is near you - but this includes hooked survivors too. There's no directional indicator, so to use it you have to sweep the area and triangulate a survivor's position. Bear in mind that Tiers I and II are basically "There are (no) survivors on this 1/4 of the map", it's only Tier III where the radius is small enough to actually navigate with.
---
Of the free killers, Nurse has A Nurse's Calling (healing survivors are highlighted) and Billy has Tinkerer (you get pinged when a gen hits 85%). Tinkerer is closer to Bitter Murmur, in that you'll generally need to be a fast killer in order to capitalise on the ping, but A Nurse's Calling just needs some good Sloppy Butcher hits in order to be viable on almost anyone.
---
It happens to me everytime! I just don't know how it works =(
---
Buddy, its lovely. But how many subs you gonna post this to. Smh
---
Wouldn't be anything like Scream imo. Scream was meta and revitalised a genre.
---
She’s actually quite a bit weaker due to the FPS, being harder to aim, and the super low sensitivity even when on max. On PC once you blink you can aim your hit to where the survivor is because you can see them, on console the FPS is too low, so 80% of the time you just gotta guess where they are and swing. Oh, and the corn maps straight up screw her over on console. Corn plus low FPS is a nightmare. Plus the game just runs like shit on console compared to PC; certain killers make the FPS drop by 5-10. Idk if I’m explaining it well enough or not, but there’s plenty of YouTube videos explaining/showing why/how Nurse is a lot weaker on console. She’s still viable, just not as much as on PC. Nurse is not worth the effort of learning on console when Spirit does what she does but better without needing hundreds of hours of experience (this applies only to console ofc).
---
Unless you're Kate, Ace, or Tapp who almost have built-in Iron Will.
---
It is great tho. When you get round to Ghostface on pretty sure that'll be my next tattoo
---
Old Freddy was pretty unique. Had a lot of stalling potential. While he needed rework because his old self was a bit weak, he will also be missed.
---
Makes all those salty messages easier on console. I like it.
---
Yeah it's the exact same effect.
---
If you have Ace in game and trap chests - you should Alt-F4 right away and then message a big sorry post for him.
---
I like the idea of an audiovisual cue but the execution could be better

I love F13 to death, but this is 1000% correct. No one but the most hardcore fan wants to deal with LOL YOU GOT INSTAKILLED CAUSE UR WEAPON DIDNT STUN.
---
Never camp, do a slug build once in a blue moon, and I only ever tunnel if a survivor is a super big asshole. Like, teabagging, flashlight clicking, red instaheal-carrying bastard. On the other hand, if I run into someone who was recently unhooked, I'll ignore them to give them a chance to get it together. Toxic survivors tho, fuck em.
---
Yes, it does, since dream snares and pallets considered traps.
---
Survivors have been buffed oh god oh shit quick get the killers mains to complain about these bricks
---
I would say a mix between a bit of a shitty connection and a little too slow on throwing it down, because he did start his lung and technically crossed the gap to catch you. Try throwing it down a little sooner, because that was still cutting it fine
---

Of course there is , how do you even play pig if you cant make quick 180 to fake with her dash , no Wonder why consoles players think shes bad , they cant do it with a controller
---
Sounds like GF's expose for ANY expose effect from any source (Myers, perk, hex perk).
---
I didn’t say they didn’t work lmao it’s just not as fancy as it seems. They aren’t actually doing big elaborate skillful spins around you. The fast sudden jerk of motion is just disorienting, you can achieve this even by jerking side to side which is ridiculously easy. It takes practice to get used to it in the first person POV.
---
And no more fcking pink for the love of god same can be said for all female survivors
---
Ikr? I loved the sound cause it was unique to GF. Now I look back like an idiot checking for GF even though it's Myers or I just unhooked someone :(
---
Try playing Civilization
---
Spine chill that way you know if he is really coming
---
That’s so stupid. Why’d they do that
---
How do you inte tionally stay at certain ranks tho? Do you throw games/let people escape freely?
---
He's been out for a day.
---
Everybody plays the new dbd content when it first comes out Ghostface is all I encountered on update week. I've seen pro killers get their ass wooped while playing him (and no they weren't new to trying him out either)
---
I played for about 4 hours after work last night. I didn't encounter Freddie once.
---
Here is my idea you can not take off RBT until it is activated, after it is activated Killer has 4 seconds to choose which JBox she wants the key to be found in. If killer will fail to do that random JBox will get the key.
---
Me too dog
---
Someone should make a trap remix.
---
Beg the killer to have a kind soul and take pity to get the achievement lol. That’s what I’d do
---
Probably for those survivors that were unable to see the expose icon to the right or hear the haunted ground totem being cleansed. 
---
They needed an extra sound cue to understand they are exposed. And what better to use if not GF's unique sound to mess with survivors' heads even more.
---
I can do it, I do it on regular basis. It's tricky but I play with full sensitivity.
---
And I conclude that you are an illiterate buffoon. Have a nice day, don't waste my time responding.
---
Was Freddy main, Rework ruined him.  
---
I guess I am the only person who didn't suck with Freddy since I rarely got less than a 3k.
---
Probably won't play him again. I just don't like him at all now.
---
Steve "the hair" Harrington.
---
If this isnt meant sarcastic: One survivor is constantly getting focused and therefore dies first no matter what, he has no chance of escaping (unless the killers just trash). He cant really heal up either, so the chases  wont last as long as they would normally. And if the killers right next to you when getting unhooked, you cant even get to a loop in time. The only thing you can do is to use specific perks like DS or BT, and even then they will only get yourself a bit more time, in the end youll die anyway.
---
There's plenty of irrefutable evidence in the comments, so...
---
They have to work together to drag the body, put the survivor on a pulley and hoist the player up.
---
The obsession starts the trial in the dream world, which is known for being easy to get out of, and likely spawns next to survivors who can wake them up? Sounds great!
---
Same actually
---
STBFL is probably my favourite killer perk. I run that baby on basically every killer I play- seriously, get it.
---
Your gay
---
How is calling someone trash because they didnt play the character at all and are saying dumb shit about it bad ?
---
Jeff just needs a skin that isn't jeans, a tshirt, and a jacket. Maybe one day they'll realize they can put him in something else...
---
I agree on the dick thing though.
---
Not loops, clicks or teabags, I'm talking those times where a SWF bands together to make everything impossible for the killer, saboing the hooks so when he needs to hook he can't, constantly bodyblocking and not allowing the killer to hook, constant flashlight blinds making the killer blind and not knowing where they're going. It could even go as far as queueing with lower rank survivors to ensure the killer is not near as skilled enough to play against that batch of survivors. That is the kind of shit that ruins the match for a killer, that's the stuff that essentially ensures a shite game and a heavy loss for the killer.
---
Not only what the other guy said, but in the Dream World the terror radius is replaced with the lullaby. This makes it hard to figure out where Freddy is or how close he actually is.
---
Brown Rake, Yellow Claws, Purple Paint Thinner AFAIK.
---
Can’t wait until they change it back

Well id say git gud or just hope ur playing againat me cuz i seem to suck at chasing down people quickly. People seem to find many ways to loop me or dodge my hits but that might be cuz im new to the game... so eliminating a player early helps a lot at winning the game
---
Ah shit you're right
---
I don't think that's going to happen. 
---
It's intended, they wanted it like this (see patch notes -  Gameplay section).
---
I have like 6 killer teachables unlocked, one of them being barbecue, and I never get it. I’ve only got it on hag and spirit out of all killers. It’s really freaking frustrating
---
I got it back when hatch stand off was a thing. Has a Billy just sitting on the hatch so easy to do then.
---
&gt; desisive strike is nearly useless now
---
I don't think i've had a single game in the last two weeks when it wasn't useful.
---
Yeah spirit and billy are tied for most unfun for me. Spirit for the same reasons as you mentioned. Billy because he just has so much global pressure it’s unreal along with easy one shots. I’ll literally have more fun playing against the old legion exploit.
---
Don't do that, don't give me PTSD.
---
Yeeeeaaaah, that's a sucky one, but, if you had a good game of back and forth until then it's a GG as you all got good points and a pip I'm sure.
---
Anyone who doesn’t own Myers should really consider getting STBFL. I put that shit on everyone, just seeing faster cooldown animations in itself is funny as hell. When you get to the 4+ token range you can really fuck survivors up because they gauge themselves with your attack cooldown in mind when taking a hit or trying to save someone. When you have 6 or more tokens and they try to go for a save, you can just hit them, quick recover and yank them off 100% of the time cause the animation to unhook is so long that even Dying Light/Leader, Spine Chill or Resilience won’t be fast enough.
---
&gt; a lot of killer perks are dlc perks
---
I'd probably agree for any killer other than Nurse and Billy (Spirit is DLC herself). The faster you move, the less need for something to slow down generator progression. You might have a sporting chance against Billy, but a Nurse slug build is an absolute nightmare.
---
If u/niallmul97's goal is to be a killer main, the priority has to be given to mastering Nurse - everything after that is basically "playing for fun".
---
"Oops! Did someone blink?"

And here i am still playing Ultima Online :D
---
That's because you are a lady of taste ;)
---
Oh, I play her a lot.
---
Problem isn't pallet phasing, but chase phasing.
---
I just don’t find myself getting downed often within 60 seconds of being unhooked. It’s never up when I need it. I ended up swapping it out for something else.
---
Yes. You were the only person in the entire dbd community who was able to do anything more than black pip/depip. You may have been the only person who ever performed well with Freddy ever. Please guide us on how to be good with Freddy, Reddit user TheN0m4d, you’re the only one.
---
Exactly, which is why they should have called him out on that instead of saying what they said, did you read my comment?
---
I don't even bother waking up to be honest, unless I go pass the clock.
---
Yea, 100% no contest would be one of the best perks in the game.  SSS+ tier.
---
Oh, 2 people injured working on a gen, and the killer comes by and hits one?  Too bad, they got a protection hit and now are in Deep Wounds and can run.   You basically get to treat the Injured status as full health (You could even argue it is better than full health in many situations.  Mending doesn't take a perk/item to do, the perk would block Exposed status downs, and you can still have Dead Hard up on top of that).
---
The rework did come to PS4. Just hope we’re getting bill soon
---
I actually had a game where one fucknugget quit, so I moried two players, and the last survivor, well I was carrying her while I was looking for the hatch. She kept breaking free and heading the in the opposite direction, not knowing where the hatch was. Once I found it, I chased her to it and downed her and carried her to it. She crawled in the hatch and got quite a few achievements
---
Incorrect
---
1 word: HONESTLY
---
Yikes, that's a bummer :/ I got like 3GB to go. 👌🏼
---
yeah, nothing quite like having a 4 man no mither without being able to stand up
---
Despite using mechanics like stalking and exposing, Ghostface plays so completely different than any other Killer. Part of why he isn't strong is because people don't play him right, but the other part is that the game struggles to balance around Killers who fall outside the norm. You'll notice any time they rework a character who has an unusual playstyle, it's to bring them more in line with ther standard Killer. They want to do more unique things, as shown with Legion and GF, but they can't seem to get the balance right. I love the concept of a Killer who lies in wait for their prey rather than just the standard chase. It's just weak because that's not how the game was originally designed.
---
Can you elaborate on what you mean by chase phasing? Cause when I think "in a chase" I think looping which at any loop same counter idea. loop until she phases, distract that phase, loop more, she fakes and you know it's fake cause cooldown. Also just curious what rank surv
---
Wait for killer to close hatch while camping a door?
---
Honestly I remain unconvinced rework Freddy will join the pantheon or nurse billy and spirit in the A-S tier.
---
Did it happen to you too?
---
Would be easier to level David who is a character you get for free but ok
---
Not everyone plays for points, I have everything pretty much I enjoy playing with so I don’t grind anymore for BP
---
I didn't expect anything from this childish and toxic community like DVDs, Thank you for your participation.

You need to complete a generator to power the gates, hatch closing won't count for this

---
&gt; Not chase, down, hook, and sit
---
Actually, the point of the game, as killer, is to kill. The method in which you do it is irrelevant, except to players with entitlement issues.
---
&gt; They should promote healthy gameplay
---
What exactly is healthy and unhealthy? Is it healthy to give survivors every possible chance to survive, regardless of how it impacts your chances to win as killer? Is it unhealthy to not acquiesce to every gripe and demand from a survivor, refusing to permit them a second chance that they apparently deserve?
---
I'm so sick of people making this out to be an issue of ethics and morals. A killer is supposed to kill, regardless of how you feel about it. A killer doesn't kill only when you say it's ok. You don't get to say "you can kill, but it has to be in *this* method or using *that* tactic. anything else is toxic and ruins the game"; that's not how this thing works. 
---
"You can survive, but you have to drop the pallet after 2 times through it and you can't jump the same window more than once. You can't bring any med kits because you should rely on your teammates to heal you. You can't run any exhaustion perks because you're not supposed to be faster than me."
---
Is it sinking in how ridiculous this sounds? Yet this still gets said to killers on a regular basis and treated as if it should be the expectation. If a killer wants to maximize his bloodpoint gains of himself and/or other players by behaving in a more "merciful" way - allowing saves, starting new chases each time, allowing you to escape to heal then chase again - then that's his choice; however, if a killer wants to find you and brutalize you, that's *also* his choice. 
---
I've said this a million times and I'll say it again:
---
***Killers are killers, not tour guides or experience curators. They are in no way responsible for your own personal enjoyment of the game, as their role is solely based around your destruction. If you have an issue with being killed in a game without "being given a fair/second chance", then might I suggest you steer clear of any sort of competitive game and stick to something like RPG's or hack'n'slash games. Hopefully you will be more satisfied there, until of course you get tired of not being given the best drops or doing the most damage.***
---
Honestly, Adept Survivor should include triggering an effect from each of the survivors unique perks because just escaping is too easy. Sadly this would make David the hardest one to get in the future. 
---
Alternatively they could make it so the survivor has to double pip as well.
---
He actually runs slightly faster than normal, I believe it’s 126% movement speed for his chainsaw sweep
---
I’m fine with these challenge addons as long as they are brown
---
I mean I only camp exploiters and people who run tiles like the Rancid main building, they're actively being unfun and purposely trying to ruin the game so they dont deserve fair play.
---
Yea if I notice a shift I would probably reconsider it but it’s just not useful for the games I’ve been getting. I have been there though, just an unlucky streak I guess.
---
Honestly I don't have a problem with camping with some killers but face camping is just a bruh moment.
---
I would gladly accept getting less cosmetics for her if those cosmetics actually got to showcase more of her personality instead of being "She Meg, she sport". Which makes her feel flat as a character.
---
Lets compare her with Kate.
---
Kate gets clothes for her everyday wear, when she's working at the ranch, performing/partying and hiking. A diverse amount of outfits that tells us about Kates personality and what she likes doing.
---
Meanwhile Meg is getting an outfit for every sport imaginable and none for when she's relaxing, hanging out with friends etc
---
We don't get much lore in the game and cosmetics is one of the few times we actually get something that tells us more about the characters we play as.
---
STBFL is my favorite killer perk, it never comes off my Hag.
---
Yeah, doesn't help that i, as a solo survivor, get matched with people half my rank for some reason :(
---
Ruin + pop + chains addon
---
I don’t like all the short tops, it’s just weird when u get into a game against 4 Kate’s with the short top.... makes obvious why they wear it. Like give these characters jackets man, it’s foggy and probably cold in these maps.
---
But he doesnt even kknow about freddy, and he say freddy is shit
---
Welp. There goes my main
---
Imagine hearing techno-music instead of terror radius. That would be sweet.

Shame it's not likely, as Hotline Miami is neither horror nor movie, and licensed killers we got so far were from horror movies.

Happy cake day!

BT used to be once per match and it was still OP.
---
You get tunneled and camped for anything in this game I just accept it 😂
---
There's collision and footsteps still. Nothing works against those good spirits if they have ears.
---
Yikes
---
I got David's adept first try. My tactic was to find killer early when pallets were not used, loop for a time, then help with gens and then wait someone to get hooked and run to save them and when the gens are done hide until the way out is clear and dead hard ready to use.
---
More like the salt from used a dream pallet and getting slapped  in the face for it.
---
Not at all. While it can be slightly annoying, you are still using the game mechanics as the developers intended. No shame in doing that so flash me all you want, baby.
---
true but i get it more now for using cosmetics lol
---
Its not only strong, it also destroys the fun.
---
stop
---
Why were they making fun of Tyle?, I have gone in with names 20x worse than that
---
This makes me smile :)

Like if you wanna use a chainsaw and camp just use Leatherface he does a 10x better job at camping anyway

Christ, I was in the PTB and the first match I did, the obsession DC'd because they started in the Dream World. Then everyone else left and I ran my ass to the hatch.
---
Oof feels bad man
---
Damn you're right completely busted no killer should have a power so you can just loop powers OP
---
Thank you man for understanding it's a game mechanic. I've been and seen people get tunneled for that so much.
---
#That's the point sergeant
---
You shouldn't be required to run a perk so you can counter one killer. It's a perk, not an action you do in game to counter her. It's a waste of time to argue with you if you can't discuss it like an adult.
---
Ik
---
What I'm saying is if you're a capable survivor you don't need iron will it's just a fallback if youre too 4head for mindgames, cya bud
---
Okay there friend , coming across a little pointed, what's wrong? Didn't say anywhere it was a bug , it *is* a little laggy and he threw it down a *little* too late  and If you look above I went into it more and said the killer had already closed the gap. That's not what this killer done, he just went for the lunge. I'm a killer main btw, hag, huntress, nurse and wraith  and over all this just is bad timing
---
It’s intentional for both pallets and windows. You can still get hit on the window one step after a fast vault and two steps after a medium vault (and ofc during the entire animation)
---
For the pallets, it’s consistent and most good killers wait with their hits to make you waste a pallet as well. There a clear timing to that.
---
What are you on? Talk about an entitled killer main trying to argue a point like a child. Good bye.
---
Dont camp a pallet it never works out, either then and there or in the long run something bad is bound to happen. either keep running to a different loop or get to the middle of that loop so that you can run it a bit more.
---
Sounds great man I might drop by your stream some time, I just watched a couple of your clips and you seem really good. Are you on Twitch?
---
Killer main lmao my flair is bloody Jake and I play both nice attempt 😂😂

Endgame piggy is a very common build on the pig. Blood warden can cover half of the timer and when you slug the timer doesnt get slowed (it was changed). You want to place traps and open the doors, without hooking people. Thanks to noed, this will be very easy. Then you go after one guy with traps for at least half of time (1min) and then hook. It works well as i tried a lot of time in rank 1 with the pig, and insanely good against swf, which at rank 1 is the order of the day.
---
I think based on character height/breathing and grunts when injured kate is the best. Otzdarva made a youtube video about this topic aswell: https://youtu.be/Goi0knDvpGI
---
And also this one: https://youtu.be/P0aFo4lPARw
---
Look in the tunk!
---
And you haven't actually said anything of how to counter her without Iron Will. You don't mindgame spirit, she mindgames you. Bye
---
Yes Lithe is a very good exhaustion perk but as i am a Feng Min player this sucks also i play killers such as Micheal and Legion. So this is more underwhelming for me than rather in general.
---
100% agree
---
You keep saying bye but are still replying?? Bud part of leaving is actually leaving

“Nothing” - he made a mistake tho

“Dbd has weird lunges and hitboxes” - that statement suggests that it’s not intended AKA bugged, which it’s not
---
F
---
Thanks! Yeah I’m trying not to tunnel/camp
---
Its getting to the point where any movie thing has been done, just look at ghost face hes Myers and a bit of pig(I know not exactly), its better if they are original as they can be free to do what ever and not be constricted to another slasher like Myers or ghost face
---
I just either dc or just kill myself on hook against spirit. Nothing will make me want to waste time on a spirit game anymore
---
Except I don’t bully killers, cause I’m not an asshole.

Oh the wait times are already painful and I’m definitely not always feeling as good as then 😂

**You Are ass?**

\- I don't think so sir!

Ya that as well. Only thing I find funny is he has 3 addons for fake pallets lol

Jesus you take that literally after I went into an explanation?  The game DOES have weird lunges and hit boxes, and are you actually trying to say this game has no bugs? Like...... y'all serious? C'mon now. I didn't even say it's bugged , but if you wanna say it like that, then yes the game is bugged in several ways, but weird doesn't equal bugged. At all, that's you making up a suggestion for my comment which no one else has took. 
---
You need to chill a bit my man, it's a game
---
The only bad thing about ghostface is that his perks are kind of limited, ruin or PGTW is an absolute must since he has little map pressure
---
Did you play the same Freddy as me? Legit he ran Pop, Ruin, and chains with 2 random other perks. Starting us in the dream and slowing action speed in the dream.
---
 🎵  AAAaaalll iis spoooort.... Spooooorrrt iis alllll... Meg iiiss allll.... Meg isss spoooort  🎵
---
One of 16 survivor perks shouldn’t counter a killers core chase power
---
You prob can say there is no best but meg, kate, feng , claudette and nea are smaller and thinner then the male charakters. This makes you able to hide better sometimes behind small objects or things like that. So they are prob a bit better when its about hiding.
---
What?!
---
Sure. I dont know why they changed it. 
---
And i also dont know why anyone actually gives a fuck about steam achievments.
---
Luckily i haven’t seen dream pallets and can 100% say i hate Freddys who plant a dream snare on basement stairs and run Monstrous Shrine, Territorial, Iron Grasp, and Discordance. Makes a terrifyingly efficient basement run. Don’t even need Territorial if you use Freddy too since his snares make you scream.
---
I hate this almost as much as getting left on hook while the most useless survivor waits buy a hatch leaving me to die
---
\*laughs in Jane Ramero\*  
---
For all those who dont understand, Meg in the original intro was called "Jane", they scrapped that design and thus Meg was born, then later on, Jane
---
The devs want us to have a reason to do totems cause of the NOED complaining. If you complain about Totems now and they change it the sub will just be filled with “NOED needs to be deleted/NOED is overpowered/etc.” We need the change at this point.
---
Hex: Ruin has been on the shrine 9 times
---
No camping, no tunnelling unless it's absolutely necessary and I always slug if I get the opportunity for it
---
There were like 5 sound files.
---
Lesbian? \*DbDgonewild intensifies\*
---
I don’t see a problem here
---
You dont need to walk around, you can just sprint to a gen and unless you're unlucky you'll probs have it back when the killer finds you.
---
Shouldnt it still tho? Legions frenzy hits count for Franklins and STBFL
---
It’s the freddy meta to slow the game down
---
The pigs workshop grease gives a 1% to have more skillchecks happen and razor wire is 2% at least you get a bunch of bpoodpoints
---
He is really fun to play, and I feel far from OP with him. At rank 13 I'm getting a lot of DC's as soon as they realize I'm Freddy. Pallet play for the ultimate luls.
---
Yes, but the perk encourages you to save it and use it in the beginning of a chase. And a little sidenote. How is BL better than dead hard
---
Is it only me that thinks Freddy is op now.... I know everyone wanted a rework but still. I use killer and survivor I never seem to lose as Freddy and always lose when I fight him..
---
I think it’s supposed to be like the hand of the entity
---
Don’t you need both 4k and Merciless for the achievement now?
---
I’m pretty sure I once got a Merciless match but only got 3k and didn’t get the achievement.
---
Checkpoint that every surv can see nothing else
---
Okay that's actually really cool. Thanks
---
Obviously the game thought you needed an easier time.
---
Mostly it's a week two of season achievement. New killers have been tough because of the silly rules to it such as it dose not count if you played a 3 year anniversary cake or a party streamer. Kill three and the hatch pops even with no gens done. While great for balance it's horrid for achievement hunting.
---
That's probably why it would be a Demogorgon so they could reuse assets.
---
You are wrong.
---
[https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Stridor](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Stridor)
---
And I experienced it in game myself.
---
It's the killer meta to slow the generator progression
---
12 gigs? Takes 20 minutes unless you have shitty internet.
---
The 75% decrease in landing time is constant even with exhaustion so you can constantly make use of the perk while exhaustion is still up.
---
R10 atm and i get matched with R15-20. Don't really have the motivation to keep ranking up if this keeps on going on :P
---
It's hard to find one, but when you get a Pig that can use ambush at loops, use traps effectively and stealth like a pro it's sooo much fun. Too bad most people just use her when they have dailies :(
---
She's my main and I will always have respect for the OG teabagging killer.
---
Now we’re talking
---
You must be new here
---
I would love to see less of a movie, and more of like a Netflix series or something. It would be cool to have individual episodes that dive into the killers or survivors backstories and how they got to where they are now.
---
Apparently, in lower ranks, it's meta to slow down gen progress, whether killer or survivor.
---
Should I get it for my clown?
---
Playing with 3 rank 20s gave me a much harder time lol
---
You need a definition for Infinite as well:  
---
**Infinite / Infinite Loop:** A loop (see Looping) that doesn't allow the killer to get closer to the survivor while in chase, sometimes even with bloodlust. This is usually achieved with window vaults and long, unavoidable walls that don't allow mindgames or shortcuts.
---
I try to stay between rank 8-12 for minimum toxicity ;)
---
welcome to australia lmao
---
Well I miss old Freddy but new Freddy is ok, I guess. However I might take a week break from console so that there can be some diversity in the killers I am up against(since I play killer, then whatever survivor was best, then killer, so on so on)
---
Lithe also combos really well with dance with me since the speed bonus lasts as long as you can make no scratch marks. Throw in quick and quiet and you’re the jungle gym god.
---
Not really, I knew matchmaking was bad but not this bad
---
I dont know why everyone is down voting you but your right
---
The only reason why it counters is because they affect different things. Iron Will doesn't make breathing quieter, only grunts of pain
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Iron_Will
---
Someone tried to tell me in post game chat that farming is when the killer hits the survivor who has just been unhooked, when I tried to explain that that is tunneling they called me an idiot and left a comment on my profile. Glad to see I was right and I'm not living a lie.
---
I think Spirit and Hag stretch that human rule a little
---
Than you must be very lucky because once I hit rank 10 it seems like that's where it starts
---
Not true, the frame drops aren't more of an issue for her than for any other killer and they've been a lot less frequent since the last update. Also, 5 blinks is terrible, you should always do max 3 blinks; pass that and it'll start hurting you instead of helping. The biggest problem is the camera sensitivity cap.
---
Never too late! Hope you enjoy the game...it's a lot of fun!
---
I mean it would be utopic if both sides would allways have fun.
---
But in a pvp scenario this isn't allways achieveable.
---
And I don't like how people start at: "The killer has to play a certain way so survivors have fun."
---
It's bullshit. Especially if survivors don't "play a certain way" aswell. It's all about limiting the killer.
---
Have you played since the Ghostface update? It's a lot better now.
---
2 v 9
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Every Survivor when you didn’t find hatch
---
Possess/Imitate?
---
I’m not even gonna say it.
---
Hey I didn’t said zero I just said minimum. Purple and red ranks are just a shit show of back and forth toxicity.
---
even if the bonus was like +100%, it would be worthless, because freddy gain so much BP, all of my games last night was 32K.
---
Part of me hopes it would be Billy just to confuse people.
---
He was that way before and it was the problem lol are you serious
---
Gotta love the community. I was lucky enough not to play any toxic survivors last night. I did get quite a few DC's but no after game salt. When I do face toxic assholes I just give the ol GG and tell them to enjoy their gaming.
---
Especially with hex
---
The game should be fun and enjoyable for everyone, so I try and please as much as I can, by not ruining someone's match by tunnelling them relentlessly. Sometimes this does happen by accident, but sometimes I just can't find anyone else except the same person. 
---
And camping on hook, that's just kind of cruel. Unless the whole team works together to save said survivor on hook with borrow time, taking hits, whatever they may do. But if they don't efficiently work together, that survivor might not get saved at all, and that's just no fun. 
---
Whenever I play, I just kind if think to myself, would I enjoy having this happen to me as a survivor? If no, go a bit easier on that person, don't tunnel them on purpose and what not. 
---
The good old, treat them as you'd want to be treated, strategy.
---
Plus, showing respect to each other could tighten the bond between the community, and could lead to a less toxic play environment, hopefully.
---
I would love that. I really want to "main" her as a survivor but I am having the worst luck getting any good perks in her web. Sadface...
---
y tho
---
Huntress has some of the quickest chases in the game if you land a hatchet then m1 and if there’s a pallet bait the drop and yeet one in the back of their noggin
---
The fuck is that lunge. Holy shit.
---
Was there lag or was the doc using a wakizashi saya?
---
Running only haunted grounds on hag is fun btw
---
Thrill of the hunt makes it even more fun
---
People will kill themselves trying to cleanse your Devour and then once they finally succeed, they’ll be met with a giant disappointment
---
I done that but still no adept Freddy
---
Has anyone gotten adept Myers since the emblem system introduction?
---
Nah they said in multiple patches and patch highlights that he needs to be in the center of your screen and that it has nothing to do with your character.
---
Wait... is the sword going through her chest or in the gap between her ribs and shoulder?
---
I think Zoey's outfit is pretty good......
---
He wants off-meta
---
When Enduring+Spirit Fury is meta, it’s not on the huntress, thus why I suggested that
---
The duality of this play-style makes it quite fun and it subversives survivor’s expectations
---
It feels good to call Freddy A Tier
---
I feel like Corrupt intervention is a better choice than ruin in high ranks, along with pop goes the weasel. Good survivors have no trouble hitting the skillchecks.
---
I want it even more now
---
Yes. I liek
---
What rank are you? Since ranks 1-5 have to get 4 iridescent emblems, 6-10 need three irid. and one gold and so on.
---
yea i main her right now because i like her skins. i spent like 3million blood points on her getting every perk
---
PS4 lag is super fun, that's why I (try to) DH so early :/
---
With BBQ&amp;C you have no issue getting 50k+ BP every game it was like that before his revamp actually!
---
Congrats man, nice to see you stick with it and get better.  Happy hunting!
---
Thanks man! Happy hunting!
---
Pfffff no lag other than normal horrible PS4 lag but I'm used to that by now which is why I DH so early.
---
the problem is spirit fury will be used around 1 or 2 times a game max as huntress ends chases too quickly to get any use. I’d say using a combination of the mid tier perks like her lullaby hex is fun to use as as soon as you get enough hooks gens are blowing up everywhere and if you combine it with pop goes the weasel you can easily see which gens have been worked on and kick em which makes a fun long game.
---
Motherfricker. I had this too, I was so confused and annoyed.
---
I can only play a few games of DbD at a time before having to play something else
---
It just bores me after a while
---
What timezone? Cause noon today was like 3 hours ago here
---
I'm rank 12 one pip to 11
---
As a myers main, my perks are typically Ruin, Monitor, spirit fury, enduring. Sometimes I’ll swap out enduring for nurses or BBQ. If you’re bad at T wall loops, swap spirit fury for bamboozle. A lot of people are against running spirit fury without enduring, but it works for myers because as myers you’re more concerned about stalking, and aren’t trying to catch up to people in chases.
---
The most crucial part of the game is getting your early T2. Use cheeky spots to stalk survivors on gens, and don’t stand out in the open. 
---
Your main objective is to stalk people until you’re at 99%, and then you walk right up behind somebody, stalk to pop tier 3, and then instantly down them. If they’re near a pallet, that’s what spirit fury is for. However, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t hit somebody in T2 if you have the chance. A lot of survivors against myers think you only care about stalking, and don’t mind running a loop an extra(dangerous) time or looping around a small object to prevent you from stalking. At these points just m2 them, it will help you keep game pressure.
---
Monto?
---
Eastern time US
---
The grind for BBQ &amp; Chili doesn't take that much time. Considering you're an instakilling chainsaw machine, that has capability of taking multiple survivors with one swing.
---
Is there no hope for anyone? Will we ever be able to enjoy this new Freddy? Please, what can we do with this Freddy, surely there must be anything we can do, you have to know something. You’re the only person ever who has performed well with Freddy ever in the history of all time, I’m begging you to find somewhere in your ultimate wealth of knowledge that we may be able to carry on. 
---
Also you don’t have to call yourself an idiot, you’re the only person in the entire dbd community who was good with Freddy.
---
Ruin + pop + thanat + chains + box
---
Thanks i will try it later
---
Since I have the time let me help you with that mental gymnastic you cant comprehend yourself:  
---
Nr 1. You assumed I am not high ranked -&gt; insinuating I am not high skilled therefore my claim. (First trigger signal)  
---
Nr 2. You constantly reply and argue on my thread, you cant accept my point. (next trigger signal)
---
Nr 3. You try to deform my points by strawmanning all I said (high trigger signal) \*ding ding ding\*  
---
If you need any more coaching let me know. Waiting for your reply ;) \*looking at nr.2\*
---
Cheers
---
if there's one there's bound to be more.

When Fuze falls through the floor instead of cluster grenades
---
Okay I checked and I was right. [Here] (https://gyazo.com/ffbbc67ab86b4e14c09f6218d1afd01b)
---
Doesn't seem right, Stridor only effects breathing, so grunts a pain won't change 
---
Also it is a fan made site
---
Well technically they are both still humans. Spirit is a wandering human corpse and Hag never really died but only came close and just developed into a walking plant mud witch.
---
The problem is, you literally have to follow the killer to get protection hits
---
Waited for a while? Survivor queues are instant btw. 
---
Since when do we have to play and sacrifice our own fun by thinking of the other players? The killers don't need to do it. It's a video game, it is suppose to be fun.
---
That lunge lol.
---
What ping did you have?
---
In Diablo 3 it uses similar different colour words like ‘Slightly’ etc as default, but you can toggle with a button press to turn the coloured words into the actual numbers for those who are deeper into the mechanics. 
---
I think that could be something that would work here and sounds quite easy to implement.
---
nah on shadowborn the eyes are colored in white
---
It’s not fun
---
You will just go too hell, not extra hell
---
Yes.
---
They need the points more. Can't make'em on their own.
---
r/suicidebywords
---
 I was searching for this post. Have the same problem
---
Np!
---
Im not a Baby Killer! Get off my LAWN!
---
kinda
---
I pick him up a seconds before timer goes down to 0 and "he escaped from my grasp", but he stays in the air. I couldn't do anything except m1, and he's down timer didn't proceed, so... new bug or old?
---
&gt; when the killer hits the survivor who has just been unhooked
---
If it happens a second after the unhook action (which means the unhooked survivor can't really move), then it's considered *farming [a survivor] off the hook*, yes. If the unhooked survivor was able to move away from the hook, the term tunneling is better suited, yes². However, I'd still say that the unhooking teammate *farmed* the hooked survivor, as they can tell that the killer is very close and, in this case, can quickly down the unhooked survivor again.
---
Noed is fine. 
---
Deal with losing like an adult.
---
As others said, faster hit recovery. Every killer can benefit except maybe Billy with amazing chainsaw snipes. It’s well worth it.
---
Oh k
---
That's just normal every day PS4 lag
---
That's why I DH so early
---
Luigi says: Just cleanse totems!

Why 2 perks are pink?

the /s stands for "sarcastic"

Is discordance legions get perk?

cause Tyler is a beta name I guess lol

But sports are a huge part of her personality
---
No need to be a Dick about it jeez
---
Scoops ahoy! Yesss that'd be wicked
---
well in Australia 12GB takes 5+ hours
---
It's not fun at all. There isn't much that can be done though. You win some, you lose some. It's very unlikely that everyone is an expert survivor though. 
---
Learn from each trial.
---
Its not like you have too much time against most killers. Gotta do all gens in 4 minutes and get out.
---
What does it feel like being elitist about something that's played by children?
---
That's sad.
---
I salute to my fallen comrade.
---
Oh I see. BNP : Brand New Part 
---
BP : Blood points

IS : Iridescent Shards

AC : Auric Cells  :D
---
Amen
---
You download an App called TapTap. Then search dbd on it and Download that. After go to your files and install the file you downloaded. Then start being a toxic rank 20 nea main
---
He has his moments. A mouse will always beat a controller when it comes to aiming for something specific, so sometimes Hillbilly can be rough to control with the sprint.
---
Idk if you know this but there comes an end after the middle, and that last year's summer event was in August.
---
Eh, he's pretty easy so I don't mind him much. Just run through the snares while he's chasing someone else and he simply becomes a powerless M1.
---
I guess ur HOPE of cleansing that totem got DEVOURED
---
So you're just gonna fuck over your team and not even attempt to learn how to play against a killer? He's not hard to play against, he's honestly a lot better to play against if you tried. Maybe you should move onto a casual game.
---
Iron Maiden: slightly faster reload, Fire Up + Brutal Strength + Bamboozle: No loops 4 u, Bloodhound + Predator + Stridor + Shadowborne: Eye of Sauron

So? An anti camping fucks perk.

Scratched Mirror on Lerys.
---
Br br
---
When will people szop complaining about noed cleansing all normal totems on a map tooks 1min and 15 sec thats it noed is gone. Also it only comes in when all gens are done. When the killer chase you after all gens are done with no oprn gate there is a very low chance to survive anyways. The killer has no reason to leave the hook then.
---
Its not like im at red/purple ranks where im getting good killers
---
Unless you go against Nurse, Spirit i feel like you can spare a few seconds for totem even against good player.
---
You still comfortably pip'd I'm sure. You could unhook maybe 1 or 2 people do like half a gen and have a shit chase that's less than 30 seconds die on first hook and comfortably pip. Just keep doing that until you don't see 20s anymore. Warning: all rank survivors are secretly bad.
---
To be honest, I'd rather see DS go instead of Adrenaline.
---
BP doesnt matter to me
---
I think we've done a pretty good job so far.
---
As many downvotes as they get.... they're right. You claim it to be "bait." Because you can cancel your teleport, and they dont know whether you will or won't. But as a survivor, when you see the gen seizing in a fountain of blood. You have to *assume* that freddy will teleport. Else you risk the consequences of being wrong. It's even better in this claudettes situation.
---
1 min and 15 seconds. You know how much time that is? A killer get a ton of stuff done in that time while youre wasting time looking for totems instead of doing gens aka the objective
---
Ds is just anti tunnel
---
I get it. He’s basically a new killer now and everyone wants to try, but I don’t think I have ever been happier to see a hillbilly or a doctor.
---
Hwàkeen Phoenix
---
A few seconds but even then gens are more important where you can get an extra what? 25% on a gen?
---
&gt;So now fear, the rank 20's will NERF the perfectly balanced killer.
---
i don't think this is true, becuse nurse and billy is barely touched, if the survirvors really had power to demand real nerfs then these 2 would be weaker for sure. So it's not that easy.
---
I don't think I use anything other than combat straps and either video tape or face mask. She's my favorite killer but the only other addons I consider using are the ones that add more boxes to the map.
---
Im going to have a look at it when im at home. But i think i already looked at that and tested it. Im not sure though
---
Just asking sorry
---
I played about 3 games of DBD on console just because it was downstairs and I was trying to get my console-only housemate into it but couldnt cope with the frame rates. That was about a year ago though.
---
I bought Pebble off of it and didn't get it for about a month in which I prestiged Tapp from P1 to p2
---
As far as I'm aware PC has the biggest playerbase out of the three? soon to be five.
---
I mean, you will see Ruin on almost every killer, Freddy mains aren't the only one using it.
---
That's probably one of the most annoying things about the mechanics of this game,imo. How perks and the stupid bloodweb work. I grinded my balls off to unlock these perks,now I have to continue the ball grinding until this pos bloodweb decides to randomly grace me with it? F off with that nonsense.
---
I have not had any yet, in fact post game has been more positive then usual.
---
Oh I see. I guess I'll use map offerings for a while then lol
---
Sounds more like a personal problem then. 
---
It's not that bad. The problem is when NOED gets activated, survivors seem to not pay attention. If the killer is bad, and needs NOED to secure one kill, the, let him get that one kill. Escape for the 5,000 BP and move on. Don't feed him more points.
---
I main survivor so the rare times I do play killer I refuse to  stoop to that level. I know it's annoying as shit to get off the hook and then tunneled into the ground because you're an easy kill for someone who is just looking to be a toxic cunt for no other reason than it's funny.
---
If you're genuinely skilled enough as a killer, you shouldn't have to secure kills like this, I normally see the person who was freshly unhooked and leave them alone to do their own thing for a little bit until I see them again later because by then they've had plenty of time to heal up and maybe get some points before I go after them again. I've gotten 4ks like that so it's genuinely not hard to just piss off and leave the person alone for a little bit.
---
I do kind of slug when I play? But I do it when the other player was near by and the player I've already downed is tier 3 madness (main doc) other than that I don't do it.
---
It's just another example of people just always wanting to win and never wanting to adapt, so they just DC.
---
Bout 2 months I think
---
Even got one for a perk that isn't in the game
---
Same I used all my MacMillan bones 😂
---
He doesn't need one
---
Nea
---
Precis. Behavior la till det i denna senaste uppdatering.
---
Iron Maiden, you can get hatchets mid chase and barely lose any ground, and on the off chance of someone going in a locker... their basically a free kill
---
So, I've been saving up for Hag, but probably gonna start playing survivor again after playing killer has been a frustrating experience. Should I pick up Lithe now? No real interest in getting the Doctor's Chapter ATM.
---
I'm. Sorry but what? Ambush can complety counter loops if you use it right.
---
It is a merciless, no other way unfortunately
---
If he needs noed for one kill then he shouldnt get that one kill at all, he didnt deserve it at all. He needs a crutch perk to get any kills.
---
I don't always downvote.
---
but when I do, it's on comments that ask for it.
---
&gt;  I'll get downvoted again
---
The full thing is 2979848
---
Didnt mean that aggressively sorry.
---
Suviviors are entitled and we aewht allowed good killers
---
I've gladly miss out on several upcoming killers, survivors and such if it meant Dead by Daylight focused on fixing their mess of a game.
---
I actually didnt go against that many gf. maybe 1 every 4 games, enough that you got experience against him but not so much that it was vs him every match like it is right now with freddy.
---
I really like the concept of batter up in how you gain tokens from stunning the killer but the wiggle part is pretty unremarkable to me. What if each token gave you a % speed boost while a killer has another survivor on their shoulder instead to help with bodyblocking and fitting the "determined guardian" role.
---
Good ruin games then get banned. We don't need players like you
---
They didn't make five different maps for Badham, they only created different tile spawns for the same map. If you use an offering you will always go in the same map with different positions
---
Any clue what level you get those perks? Or is the bloodweb random?
---
For the love of God. 
---
**Leave Piggy alone, you bastards.**
---
When will people stop complaining about decisive strike. Not Tunnelling a Survivior who got unhook takes 60 seconds. Also it only comes in if the killer tunnels someone off the hook, which is a toxic strategy to begin with.
---
Or they haven't seen it like myself.
---
Why is that?
---
Love the idea and the perks though I feel they need some nerfs. Scoops would be scary to play against if partnered with self care or a purple med kit and botany. Babysitter as well. Maybe make it an exhaustion perk or have a long cool down. I like any perk that encourages aulteristic play. I really like the build and the idea and I would buy the scoops ahoy outfit in a second I just think it needs some work
---
Imagine complaining about Borrowed time and decisive strike after both getting nerfs
---
Myers has a very small terror radius in tier 1 (6 meters), that allows you to stalk survivors from a decent distance, the first thing you want to focus on at the beginning of the trial is to patrol generators, find busy survivors and stalk them. When you reach tier 2 you are faster, but your terror radius becomes larger. When you are about to reach tier 3, stop stalking at 99% and try to get closer to your victim, then stalk again to activate tier 3 and insta down the survivors for a limited time. As you stalk, you can notice that survivors start to become reddish, and when they are completely red you can't stalk them anymore, so don't rely too much on reaching tier 3 to down them, the best thing to do for me is to completely focus on reaching tier 3 only at the start of the game, and instead downing them normally as the game progresses. For what I know, you are able to reach tier three only 2 times, and maybe 3 with some addons, per game.
---
I’m just sitting here trying to log in, but keep getting kicked out
---
1: Nah, it's never a bad time to get in and try something new. Don't get discouraged, no one starts as a master. I might recommend starting as a different killer just to get a feel for how killers play before starting straight with Ghost Face.
---
2: Ghost Face is the latest killer to be added, so he's pretty new himself. Now is a prime opportunity to give him a shot!
---
So what ur saying is it counters camping killers. 
---
I see no issue here
---
That's fine
---
You know small game could help with that...
---
I don't. Sure, I'll try to not play mean but if I see an opportunity that helps me by tunneling and so on, then yes I will.
---
I dobt actively do it or look for times to do it either.
---
I played a dozen games and only played Freddy 2 times. :(
---
Can't explain why she doesn't need a buff and instead immediately slings insults? Yep this is how a loser argues.

use a spacebar macro

Do you feel oppressed against what is basically a weaker clown?
---
Bye.
---
That is true. Forgot about that. I would still love a present day labcoat with rubber gloves and safety goggles.
---
Even then. Its a waste of a perk space theres so many better perks. Plus its a waste of time looking for it especially when you cant communicate with your team if your solo or duo or even trio. And if they need it go get any kills then they dont deserve them since its a complete crutch perk.
---
I've played with my friends when both Ghostface and Reworked Freddie were released. We're in ranks that go from 9 to 15, aprox. The day they released Ghostface, it was one Ghostface after another. My heart skipped a lot of beats that day (I wasn't used nor expected its lack of terror radius). But yesterday, with Freddie, it took us a while to find Freddies.
---
Ok
---
They should just put a DC counter over your head to show everyone how much of a cunt you really are since they aren't going to ban anyone for doing it.
---
Myers or Huntress.
---
There is no such thing as deserving kills or escapes if you live, you live and if you die, you die. Assuming that you deserve to live is probably why you died.
---
Both of those are still better than this.
---
So true 🤣🤣
---
I predict this sound cue will eventually be forgotten it even originally was from Ghostface and everyone's going to call it "The NOED Noise."
---
It was added to Game Pass, PS4 made it free tho
---
Nope. Rank 9 Claudette on Yakaoma’s.  I’d unhook her and she’d run to the corner of the map then self-care herself. Not a single mf gen.
---
One kill is nothing though. If the killer wasn't able to down anyone the whole match, then is able to only secure one hook, then the killer has absolutely failed. I don't see the problem.
---
I miiiiight be really far off, but I think I remember this scene from Toradora! But yeah, you're right, that guy on the right is VERY basic.
---
SAVE ME.
---
Yep, played on the game map with two addons to increase stalk amount.
---
What’s his twitch username?
---
DESPITE
---
I love padded jaws. Maxes deviousness super fast, which almost never happens for trapper.  It also makes the survivors not fear traps, so you pair it with the harder to escape add-on and you can leave them there for ungodly amounts of time.
---
I’m loving the rework playing as Freddy, I’m not enjoying going up as him though 😂 all I’m seeing is ruin/dream pallets. Maybe I’m salty because I’m usually the first to die ahah.
---
Blindness and hemorrhage are trash.
---
Yeah, but the fact is that I can see BHVR releasing something like that someday...
---
Lithe is good but everything else is dogshit
---
Depends on which ones fit your playstyle, but personally, I'd say Spirit and Legion since they have pretty good teachable perks (Haunted Grounds and Discordance). Plus they're both fun to play imo.
---
The amount of times this has happened to me since the patch caused me to die inside, officially.
---
Ok but we also need the link to that myers image
---
That’s because he just got reworked and you have to play against him to get better against him. Like just starting the game and facing your first wraith and wondering why you haven’t seen the killer all game. Over time people will find out how to counter him. Your judging him right after he got reworked. In a month when we know how to counter him it will be fun to play against because it’s so unique.
---
You had to score at least 10k BP if I remember correctly to get a pip as a survivor and as a killer you had to score at least 9 points, hooking a survivor was 1 point, sacrificing/killing one was 2 points.
---
Apparently some people think "now I can camp" is the key point of the rework
---
The Demogorgon had no trouble attacking its victims in our world. It primarily used the upside down to transport itself away from danger and to surprise its victims. It's more like the spirit. But in this case, the survivors would be able to enter as well. So really what would be cool is if the Demogorgon could hunt in either world, looking for survivors in either, and swapping between worlds to get all the survivors.
---
but you can listen to their footsteps to see where they go, hit them a second later and save a perk slot
---
No he wouldn't binchh
---
Camping is pretty useless and unrewarding especially if the survivors know what they’re doing. I try my hardest to avoid tunneling but if the person who just got unhooked runs right into me I’m gunna smack them. As for slugging, there are some times (two survivors left) when I slug just to avoid a hatch escape and get the 4K.
---
The new lawn mower perk
---
it sure is, for them lol
---
What about defending your totems ?
---
If you don't have time to look for the unhooking Survivior and just go after the hooked one, you deserve to get hit with decisive strike. 
---
If you let a Survivior follow you to the hook it means you didn't patrol the slug and you deserve to get hit with borrowed time.
---
I feel like there are some maps I’ve never even played and then maps like this or haddonfield I get every other game
---
Well what's the problem, killers with a greater movement speed than 115 are imbalanced. If bhvr would nerf nurse and billy to the level of other killers(personally don't have a big problem with spirit, just anal beads are bullshit) they could make some real changes to buff all the killers overall and make people to play other killers in red ranks. Now it's tiresome to play same 3 killers, because others are just not good enough.
---
Someone just adrenalined off the ground then got instantly smacked back down by noed
---
If you’re a killer main, hex ruin is a must, so get hag for that perk or wait for it to be in shrine. Pig is fun, just no map presence, and Myers is easy to use and is great when he starts setting up his evil within. If you’re not bothered about perks, just get Pig and Myers, if you are bothered about perks, then get bbq and ruin :). But waiting for shrine isn’t a bad idea either. hope this helps :)
---
If you don't call downing a Survivior within 60 seconds of them getting unhooked "Tunnelling" then I have no words
---
The Hag for Ruin and Leatherface for BBQ if you want to have their perks which are essentials. But if they are not your cup of tea, new Freddy is fun, Spirit is also a lot of fun since she has a pretty high skillcap.
---
Yeah bc borrowed time is meant to prevent you from doing something like that, bc that's a move called *camping* and it's a dick move.
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
wow some useless killer perks thats for sure
---
does anyone use lightborn? i had to google what the hell it even does (my billy is still a lvl 1  ive palyed like 1 match with him)  
---
and save the best for last?   its mediocre
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Guys, just to clear things up, I recently came back to dbd after quitting when legion launched. There weren't many killers using hex ruin (or maybe I just didn't play survivor enough, probably that).
---
There is no need for the "controversial" comments - a dictionary should remain neutral and objective
---
Defending... dull totems?
---
Personally, I have the most fun with Clown and Shape, but Spirit is definitely easier to win with once you get used to her.
---
Yea when I got lampkin lane after badham, I literally wanted to DC
---
“Don’t get caught loser” is like “stand up paraplegic” you are so toxic dude, getting enjoyment out of another person not having fun. Camping makes you worse at the game because you get in less chases. Not the survivors fault you aren’t a good killer and only win by camping.
---
Creeper aw man
---
Freddy is in no way a weaker clown lmao. His map coverage on it's own outclasses him. Clown is great in chases but has no map coverage or gen stall. Freddy with pallets, lullaby, and teleport is a menace
---
If you have noed and they are doing bones, why wouldn't you defend them if they are on your patrol routes ?
---
The other day he get destroyed by Zubat's Huntress, I would love to see it this channel.
---
Yeah, there's been times where I've gone against red rank swf groups despite being like rank 11.
---
Camping with this beautiful specimen is like Having a the most beautiful ~~wife~~ car in the city and not driving it
---
I mean he got farmed by his team mate.
---
I’m new to the game and have so far been able to adapt to most play styles I’m just looking for the killer that will make things more interesting for everyone not just me lol
---
I'm she has a longer cool down than nurse already LMAO. What are you talking about? Billy is the one that needs a cooldown.
---
Bad meme because camping is good in specific circumstances, can we stop pretending likes its some forbidden thing
---
It's definitely in the top 5 strongest perks in the game.
---
This happened to me the other day. I was so mad, bc my game was messed up the whole match. I couldn't heal or do totems or anything. And managed to still make it out with the wraith as the killer at rank 10 and this happened the same way... Smh
---
Thats some salt.
---
At least the dead hard nerf is alive and well!
---
seconding Laurie. OoO got me tunnelled for five matches until i finally - to use ol' Squeaky's turn of phrase - pulled a rabbit out of my ass and escaped on the sixth match somehow. i wasn't even actively using OoO :(
---
Who the fuck needs No Mither?
---
I had a blast with it, but after playing all maps and all types of shark a few hundred times, there is really not a big motivation to keep playing anymore, did all achievements, got a few nice skins, felt like I was already done.
---
https://imgur.com/a/mq4nNqU
---
exactly the problem i was talking about, ignoring that gens get done too fast and saying that a perk that punishes gen rushing is the problem, i rarely have chases that last more than 40 secs, but that doesnt do anything for me, cause how fast gens get done
---
Tunneling means i focus on 1 survivor and do anything to take him down and hook him over and over again until he/shes dead. In this situation i was already chasing someone else hooking someone else when the nea was already unhooked . And the the nea just randomly run into me. Why would you call that tunneling why should this be my fault
---
To be fair he still has the gen teleport and has invisibility up to a certain range while you're in microsleep.
---
Or he has fake pallettes with the addon.
---
So he's not a solid m1 killer persay.
---
But yea, he's not that hard to deal with. It's like dealing with a clown or a hag in reality.
---
The main thing the changes did for freddy were to remove the dream transition handicap he had that made him the worst killer in the game.
---
This game is dead after Cyberpunk and Death Stranding come out.
---
Give it time. Eventually he will be played less and less. Don’t change a character because some survivors find it unfun to play against. There are 16 killers in the game, so why change the way a single one works because he’s unfun to play against. You have 6% to play against him in the future when the craze dies down. Don’t get mad at a game that 2 of the 16 killers are unfun to play against when the other 14 are fun.
---
Thats counter-efficient. That brings them to ranks they where they arent capable teammates anymore. Getting bps takes a long time, but its paralell to experience.
---
On xbox when you go in to dream world the frames drop a shit ton to the point that you're playing at a huge disadvantage
---
The average rank of those survivors is ~9. I’m sure it’s based on that. This has to be SwF regardless of what anyone says. Is it fair? Probably not. Is it the best DbD can do right now? Probably. Obviously we can’t operate on a straight average, but this isn’t as broken as most people say.
---
for a sec I thought the 2nd is a darksign from dark souls..
---
something like 👨‍👦‍👦 would probably work out well - obviously less detail, but that explains it better than text could hahah
---
I know, and yet because survivors don't want to change, they bitch and moan until they eventually get their way.
---
looks dope my dude
---
Considering how they worked Ash into the game I feel that SPOILER ALERT FOR SEASON THREE DONT READ IF YOU DONT WANT SPOILERS MY GUYS Hopper or Billy since both of them died in a way related to mysterious ways which could easily been worked into the entity finding a way to grab them rather than take a full character out of potential season 4
---
You just gonna ignore all the reasons that have been given as to why old Freddy was good? I suppose not. After all, you heard somebody on YouTube say that he was the worst, and there’s no way that they could be wrong.
---
10+? weird way to spell 36
---
I thought that grind was easy as hell.   Find the 3 closest gens.  Lay a trap minefield.   Eat livers
---
Not to say that No Mither itself can't be countered though. Pro gamer Billies run Speed Limiter to punish No Mither gamers.
---
The original idea was the hands from Calm Spirit with the group of survivors in the hands, but the perk icons are kind of transparent, which made it harder
---
Yes I don't mean actively look for your own totems and camp them. Just defend one that is near a generator that you are patrolling while approching the end of the game.
---
Did you just use emojis in 2019?
---
Well that was a bit mean
---
Honestly imo discordance is the worst of the perks. It’s great at the start of a match if survivors start on the same Gen, but once they figure you have it they don’t double up on Gens, only making the Gen rush easier (and they should be doing it this way from the start anyhow)
---
Iron Maiden is actually a good combo perk on several killers, such as bubba, billy and nurse (fk locker jukes) and also great alongside BBQ. 
---
Mad grit is one of my most loved perks. I might be a little more biased on this one, but honestly I hate body blocking, and this eliminates that entirely. Ntm, even if they use dead hard/dodge your hit, by the time you finish the swing you can hook. It’s probably personal bias since I did a smoker nurse and combo’d a 3k off a downed survivor using mad grit, iron grasp, agitation, and iron maiden.
---
I mean he is difficult to beat, but not impossible. I survived 2/3 rounds against him last night.
---
...granted I may have abandoned the others to escape
---
Found the tunneler, guys. 
---
Jk of course
---
Shame we need an xbox one x for something that looks like a ps2 game
---
Hopper isn't confirmed dead, and David Harbour has signed on for Season 4. Billy would be a strange choice because he was a villain for the majority of the season. 
---
Steve could work. Laurie was taken after the events of Halloween 1, which doesn't fit with established continuity.
---
Thank you
---
Well, please don't be a cop in real life. Lmao
---
Probably just tired of Freddy, same reason everyone dc from ghostface marches in the beginning because everyone played him
---
One last question, iv noticed that some matches seem drastically more strategic and drawn out than others. Is this do to the skill of the players, the level of the players, or the killer that’s on the map? For example I feel like matches last longer when I’m the hag as compared to when I’m the huntress?
---
How come it takes so long to find a match
---
When you think about it, its smart of the killer to boost the babies coz then they will bring their top teammates down with them. One weak link breaks the chain.
---
I would love to get destroyed by Zubat's huntress but I probably wouldn't even see her as she snipes me in Lery's basement through the top floor window all the way from Red Forest.
---
Haha, the differences in here, there are no innocents. Well, i guess they all are, but we kill innocents, so same thing!
---
You had to wait like 7 seconds to hit somebody when you found them, giving the survivor time to get to a window or a pallet loop. His power did not help in chases and he could not mindgame with his power, and when the generators were finished, he was a killer with no power. He only had stall potential, and even then survivors could just wake up if they were together. But sure, old Freddy was probably great for you in yellow ranks.
---
I don't find camping happens this often, unless you're in yellow ranks or someone's having a bad day with bubba
---
Innocence just have a different title, Solo Survivor
---
Eh, you right
---
&gt;Survivor: does a suboptimal play

🎶 Smart but cynical 🎶
---
&gt;Disable chat completely
---
You can. Before you start playing, go into a SWF lobby, and click the arrows in the bottom right.
---
It’s wishful thinking for hopper still living but I feel it’d make good perks to have a more solo oriented character and Billy would fit that pretty well and if not as a survivor why not a combo of Hopper as Survivor and Billy a killer? Could get real good use out of the actors and leave wiggle room if they did decide to bring them back considering the whole Laurie thing I totally forgot about
---
Lol get mad? I'll just play killer for the next month lol.
---
Trust me, they can be just as bad as SWF when they feel like it.
---
Honestly I need to agree with you. The adept achievement should actually something you could be proud of, that you were good enough with a killer and their perks to do really well. I don't quite understand why people think that it should be easy to do.
---
&gt;Im probably 
---
Probably is right, because I'm 100x better than you and that's a fact, no "probably" about it.
---
thanks this happned to me and i thought is was my pc acting up but deadhard is just dead, time to put on DS again
---
when you post some stupid shit on twitter and get backlash for it
---
Devotion 6 solo player here and trust me when I say, I get more salt and eat more shit than killer and swf combined
---
But the bad ones are the most hopeless and adorable 😂
---
No those people dont deserve the easy way out. they 100% deserve to burn to death.
---
“He could not mindgame with his power” 
---
That’s just objectively wrong. Look up “DbD Freddy transition guide”.
---
That's the mad grit bug that was in the PTB, everyone knew about it. Did they not fix it? Good job BHVR
---
Sorry, I don’t believe that even remotely.
---
I will post a pic and tag it in a comment
---
Great, thanks!!! What's a meme build? I've heard the phrase a few times and have no clue if it actually has to do with memes.
---
100% agree not sure why DBD did a scoreboard and didn't include what each player playing in the first place, doesn't really make any sense.
---
It doesn't hurt anything. It shows who the killer is, but you have guess which survivor was which? I feel this would be simple quality of life fix.
---
I would show PIPs, and even break down the score, maybe some other stuff, so people can see how others are playing, to learn more about how to play the game. This could a later add, as I could see this taking longer to incorporate.
---
I would show player level, but I am guessing some people would want to hide that. Not that big of a deal but would end some guessing.
---
Just don’t buy a killer with real money if you can buy them with shards
---
You'll get used to it and draw strengh from their salt.
---
I'm rank 3 at the moment, I had time to play 4 games today and me or one of my team mates got camped in 3 games out of 4...
---
It's probably a combination of all of that. My clown games usually feel faster than my trapper games just because you have to strategize a little more with him, like as far as trap placement and all.
---
It’s usually the other way round for me (Red ranks, PS4, EU). Insta killer queues, like 5 seconds and 2-5 minutes as survivor to then get dodged three times in a row until you find finally a lobby which will most likely have shitty ping
---
I'll say that the memes/shitposts in this sub are top notch
---
Well you can just click it to close the chat, unless you click it open you can just ignore whatever is said post game
---
it would work better on a timer after an event, basically like a reversed(?) borrowed time. maybe after unhooking or healing someone from the dying state?
---
&gt;PS4 / played since 2018/ thinks hes good because he reached rank 1 .
---
Too Bad for you PS4 player, i play this game since the begining , july 2016 :)
---
Officer Krueger?
---
I've never heard anyone saying something this stupid before. 70% of the playerbase plays on pc
---
Just say “gg ez” when survivors whine. It’ll piss them off even more ;)
---
Dude got his rework yesterday....did you not expect people to play the new content added to the game?
---
That's a subjective opinion. I could proclaim I'm the King of England and claim it's an objective fact, doesn't make it one.
---
No he's basically an M1 killer with almost nothing else.
---
An actual strategy for bad players, yeah.
---
I'm just mad cause I spent 5$ for a perk and have plenty of shards to buy it for free but am too impatient D:
---
Who are you quoting? I don't even own a ps4. you might consider taking your medication because I think you're having an episode here.
---
Yeah whereas teabagging isn't one. It's just toxic.
---
Sadness. Oh well, I still have plague. Btw, plag is
---
A M A Z I N G.
---
Dude this shit is so frustrating, I refuse to use the perk until they fix it
---
Im taking guesses , youre a noob thats all
---
Doesn't have anything to do with memes, they're just builds that are fun to play and have some central gimmick, especially those that are not competitively viable
---
yea,but it could be 30 levels before i actually get to the unlockable i want. It's asinine.
---
No mither gang!
---
The demogorgon might be better than the freddy if he could pull you inside the upside down and slow you but hit you at the same time without needing to pull you in they should also implement something that has to do with teleporting as seen when he is behind will in season 1 or the worker in the first scene
---
The entity is just taking the same stance with me as my parents now. There's no point in expressing her dissapointment so she leaves the end game screen blank.
---
Yes, but those have much more prevalent counters. Just get in a locker or vault for Cannibal, and just look at Ghostface. The Legion can still open lockers in frenzy (I think) and you can’t vault. They’re also much faster, and can see you in their terror radius if they hit someone. The only counter is to never stay close together, because even scattering won’t work.
---
I have 7 people on my friend list, if you would like a pic of that I can send in DM so I don't put them on the public post. Here is my devotion level to show I am being honest.

Plus creepy noises
---
Will Won’t
---
Why the hell don’t they just nap near the campfire pre trial makes Freddy a easy win
---
Because on rank 20, people rarely play billy/nurse due to high skill level and if they do, they suck because of said skill level needed.
---
Since they can't properly play these killers, no one will there call for a nerf.
---
M1 killers are easier to play, especially on low ranks where people can't loop so that's why these are considered "OP"
---
You think balanced landing is better than Lithe what??
---
See P3 Claudette on scoreboard.
---
Me: There was a Claudette? *What?*
---
You got me there, but what about everything else he had wrong with him? You still had to wait to hit people, you still ate pallets during chases, and you could still get looped.
---
*nobody complained tho*
---
A possession /imitation mechanic sounds cool in theory, but I hope that killer would have other mechanics because they'd get SUPER fucked by SWFs
---
Ok evidently I should specify, I don’t doubt your devotion level, I doubt you get more salt as a solo then killers and SWF combined
---
so I'm supposed to just sit and let the survivor that I just saw crouching in the corner unhook?
---
Properly using the transition mindgame made most loops something very easily dealt with.
---
All lunges are normalized. Freddy is just a manlet so it looks ridiculous. Same with Legion. I really need people to start paying attention to patch notes instead of just blindly complaining.
---
And if you didn't have to throw down fake pallets to know they were fake, his power would be even more similar to the doctor's.
---
Don't look it that way bro, You got 1 new killer and 1 new Survivor plus the next time you can change the perk for 150,000 when it comes in the entity once again
---
Dream pallets are good but they have potential to be completly countered by a swf who knows the map and if you are smart you know that you need to swap out snares for pallets its a decent power
---
Yet she is pretty scrawny in game XD
---
&gt;Im taking guesses
---
that much is obvious, re-read my other post. :)
---
Yeah, I know it's an unpopular opinion but I find this rework really clunky and incohesive. The sleep timer, the desks, the snares, the phasing when awake...it all feels so cobbled together without any overarching idea about what they want Freddy to be as a killer.
---
The only thing I like about it that *feels* Freddy is the lullaby in dream world instead of the terror radius, since it feels like he could be anywhere and evokes that sort of dominion he has over the Dream World, but other than that, not a fan.
---
Quinton
---
fuck freddy, we need pig changes. Our girl needs buffs
---
Well swf won't help me out cause they care for themselves, I get farmed by all 3 of them usually. And killers assume I am part of the swf and camp me while nobody is gonna actually help. I have had to only rely on myself the entire time. No friends to help me get out of situations. As you can see in my pic I run Borrowed Time. I get no thanks for it, only farmed or body blocked in a corner or one exit room.
---
Think what you want tho, this is my experience and I am but a meat shield.
---
The doctor can do fake pallets, sure you can't throw then down but if you can keep track of then with the doc you can do it for Freddy.
---
It also makes Freddy invisible when he's outside a  certain range (20m or so)
---
Even if you play on pc it doesnt matter , ill still be better than you so why are you still talking to me
---
So basically a blanket nerf to the spirit so you can go back to "lol looped you gg ez killer"? Her power blinds her already. She can't see blood pools. And without addons, her cooldown 
---
Is long as fuck. I guess all of you people want everyone to get the Legion rework treatment. Want her to inflict deep wounds with phase hits too?
---
I would switch but as far as I can tell cross-save isn’t a thing yet, at least for PS4
---
I'm glad someone pointed that out.
---
did she just bring down the pallet before looping twice
---
Ah ok, makes sense. Thanks for answering!
---
More importantly, why the fuck is the killer running devour hope rank 1?????
---
No, they would release something as epic as this! But once they got your money for the DLC, they’d nerf the perks to the ground so they’re useless. 
---
*cries in MoM*
---
Yeah unless it’s a incredibly damn toxic player trying to ruin everyone’s fun (sandbagging obviously, teabag clicks into oblivion, cleansing the Totem that’s obviously haunted grounds at that point while teammate is in chase, etc. etc.) past that I feel it’s a cheap way to feel like you’re better than you are in most cases
---
Ok! I’ll get it because not to many people run stbfl. It’s always ruin (every killer need this) bbq, spirit fury, and enduring/perk of your choice. I’m excited to use it! I would assume throw a bottle to the nearest loop, hit them, they step into my gas and hit them again? The chase will probably be over in like 20-30 seconds which will be amazing
---
I don’t see why. He’s not that hard to go against
---
It would actually take closer to 11 million as 1 million only gets a character to around 35 and after you hit 50 it takes around 50,000 to move through each blood web obviously these numbers vary based on rng of bloodwebs
---
I don’t want to be that guy but it isn’t hard if you have a bit of play time with any killer, it makes the achievement more sentimental because you aren’t relaying on others to earn it.
---
If your team is competent wouldn't the camping killer get gen rushed? Yes, it sucks for that one survivor but camping is overall a losing strategy, no?
---
Bro chill, the other guy went off hard, but respond with some maturity, 2 wrongs don’t make a right
---
Okay fair enough. I don't see how that's earning the noed as much as earning adrenaline is.
---
This is like 3 sucker punches from the 4th dimension, I love it
---
Because I can tell that you know you're wrong and it's clear how desperate you are about it.
---
No Jane no god pls no
---
This community is whiny as fuck. The only killers who need adjustments are nurse and billy. You people wont be happy until every killer inflicts deep wounds instead of injuries and can't down you until you pallet stun them first.
---
Still waiting for hex ruin sigh
---
Last night I got the adept hag achievement even though I got "ruthless killer" and my rank only increased by 1 pip. The bar was all the way touching the second pip, however, but the second pip was gold not white.

yes because tbagging survivors or face camping killers aren't directly trying to lessen the enjoyment of others and is the only real source of salt
---
have you seen the forums???
---
Ok so here's  how I play. I don't camp, I rarely tunnel (unless it's for a perk but again rarely, and slugging I do only if I see another survivor with my general area. But I also say that guy is right. I mean yes these aren't the greatest tool that is nice but they are useful sometimes.
---
Lmfao whiny survivor main alert! NOED is fine, just do bones dummy
---
Anyways, DS’s nerf needed to happen, that shit rewarded bad gameplay. Next up on the nerf list is adrenaline for all you fucking gen rushers.
---
/s
---
This game really does move from bug to bug. Instead of SB its dead hard and now totems can’t be cleansed(or right next to a pallet)
---
looked more like just the host's ping. It wasnt accepting your input properly
---
Who are you playing and what perks are you using , ill then determine if youre trash
---
That's hilarious coming from you.
---
you have to set up the game, which takes a while before survivors even join, then you have to wait a couple more minutes for a full queue. All in all, it takes much more time than loading survivor, which is usually under 5 minutes.
---
Long as cooldown and like 8 seconds of warning. What the fuck more do you want?
---
Yeah, it's a shit sandwich and we all gotta take a bite bud.
---
The meta perks are great, but it’s always nice to change it up. STBFL combined with things which slow survivors down (such as Clown’s gas and Freddy’s Dream Snares) make chases end pretty quickly a lot of the time.
---
What do you mean you leave the game early . Like you quit as a killer right off the bat?
---
Yes,killer just get rekt without ruin against a good group of survivors. Against a party even ruin struggles to buy you time.
---
Doesn't matter, I'm better than you. You doubt, I don't.
---
I had someone disconnect on me when I tried to get Adept Legion (before the rework), and someone DC'ed when I downed them and picked them up, but I still managed to get the achievement.
---
Oh and there's the bullshit political statement. I was wondering where it was.
---
myers's good tho
---
I’m pretty sure you can still get it, I’m guessing you just have to hit them or let them fall asleep.
---
I think most of this is good. Would say Low B tier though since if a survivor is very good at the game, it’s easily countered if they learned the skill checks and such. Pressure is good on map control, nothing for the chase though. 
---
I would say just add Mabye a chase ability, like Mabye doing something to vaults or pallets. And it would be a very cool killer. 
---
Design should be a mutated looking guy sort of like the hillbilly, but like a cave looking person, with a hard hat and straps.
---
Great idea anyways!
---
At what lvl do you get a devotion im lvl 30
---
Babysitter is basically better We’re Gonna Live Forever.
---
Alright , the noob is scared because he has ruin and noed in all of his builds lol
---
BT: counters camping
---
DS: counter tunneling and can still be avoided by slugging
---
Adrenaline: rewards GOOD gameplay, whereas
---
NOED rewards BAD gameplays. Besides, NOED completely denies adrenaline.
---
🤡: people making these comparisons
---
After 99
---
We've talked about a killer imitating survivors for YEARS now, first we talked about how ghostface could do it, we got legion which we thought was their power because of the animation, it wasn't. We got actual ghostface, and nope.
---
It does. But survivors have a third person camera with a wide ass radius. It's not like survivors are first person.
---
It gets you banned
---
I played several matches last night on Xbox.  No Freddy.  I did see multiple Bills though, including a full lobby.
---
On ps4 you can block incoming chat from non friend it s
---
Is pretty cool
---
I turned chat once on and got salty survivor messaging me so off it is forever now
---
Well not if the idea has a lot of other ability effects to it.
---
the new freddy is not that op now you can hit without waiting 7 seconds
---
They really need to change up hatch spawns.
---
"Leaked" as in "included in the update like they have been since the store came out"
---
I got it last month, somehow.
---
Yeah, doesn't take a rocket scientist to know this post is a waste of time.
---
Sporty meg is thicc god damn
---
This add on is the reason why the map is my favorite item.
---
The anxiety lmao
---
I was the comedic relief that played Hag and Legion yesterday.
---
when the game ends i say gg then leave, because id rather not deal with the toxicity on the survivors side
---
He'd only be pre-rework Freddy if you make him pre-rework Freddy. ┐(´ー｀)┌
---
People hate to lose and will often try to validate their self-worth by lowering your own. I’d just say gg thanks for the game and move on.
---
I'd also add lag switching and PTB.
---
Apparently you're still invincible while DHing, so it's not _completely_ broken...
---
Thanks , but What was it ?
---
Fun to play as and against
---
the fact you put an emoji at the end makes this 5,000 times worse
---
The new P3 hair is miles better than the ketchup-stained mess they made it last patch. Her hair's not supposed to be red and after this 3.1.0 patch, it finally looks as good as the classic P3 head from back when she was released.
---
i main bubba and insidious camp
---
Dear God.....
---
Avdol noooooo :(
---
I hate playing as billy because he's kind of boring.
---
As survivor, playing against good Billys just made me a better survivor period. I love dodging chainsaws and forcing them to m1. Plus, I just find playing against him more engaging than say Spirit where it's a 50/50 chance with little counter-play.
---
Buy licensed ones with real money and the rest with shards
---
Definitely got r/wooosh ed
---
Scoops Ahoy seems great for healing on hook
---
I AM ANGRY ABOUT NOTHING
---
Yeah I’ve wanted discordance for a while but after seeing today’s shrine I bit the bullet and just bought him, watch it be in the shrine next week
---
Damn, They mentioned they improved totem spawns on that map but I didn't knew that's what they meant by it
---
i disagree &gt;:)
---
i suck at billy he is a good killer but i dont do to well at steering the chainsaw
---
:,(
---
ok then
---
24
---
Completely not true, the higher ranked you get the more people that play survivors. It gets to the point where survivors immediately join after you set up the lobby as killer.
---
&gt;The game is finaly **getting to** a balanced state and still they want more because: killer op
---
Cringe
---
Ah you scared me for a min. It is an issue but when you play any types of game pvp there will be trashtalk . And i found it even worse in game where both side dont have the se abilities and goal such as dbd or evolve so there isnt muchto do either report trashtalk of everyone or ignore completely
---
MISS PIGGY'S NURF
---
Actualy Dead Deja(v)u Daylight, thank you very much !
---
how was it nerfed?
---
they removed like half of his backstory in game though? i don’t even think it’s scrollable but it’s decent-sized on the wiki which is strange
---
I’ve definitely noticed a lot of LF players also happen to be lag switchers
---
The first rework freddy ive played against was a tunneling insidious basementcamper.
---
unless they do another survivor only DLC, which is probably likely cos I don't see them adding any of the Stranger Things monsters
---
Camping is boring and does nothing for me, but if i happen to be by when survivors get unhooked, i will go after them.
---
Tunnelling only if they are t-bagging or farming their teammates on hook
---
Slugging only if there are two survivors left or if I want to try a Deerstalker build
---
You can call them "new" mechanics, but he's literally just a worse clown that can jump to gens.
---
Boy George is the survivor
---
I have around 700-800 hours on console. I'd say a good 400-500 are all killer. I'm simply not some god at killer. I'm good, I can maintain a rank 8-4 but im simply not so good I can use base. Perks and apply that much pressure. Gens are done way to fast and without ruin or someone who can force them off gens consistently, it just won't happen.
---
I think you spelled Michael wrong
---
ahaha yeah i guess
---
It seems you enjoy Leatherboi, he was the first killer I ever played as and got a 4k in the basement. He can definitely be a lot of fun.
---
That guy is literally playing that after rank reset with a Scratched Mirror (Tier 1 only) Myers who is slow as fuck and has a lunge shorter than pre-rework Freddy's dick 
---
Not only that but he barely makes it out and also makes some really boneheaded plays. Sure with his boneheaded plays the small lithe boost makes some killers whiff but just play smarter with BL which opens up some damn near infinites or DH if you want to trust it enough and it's not going to bug out
---
Wait. They released the changes without fixing Mad Grit? Is Head On still bugged aswell?
---
I pay attention to what I want to because every new match is different from the last one, and I'm rank 3 so hold my beer. I'm just saying that use a perk trying to screw that specifical killer, nurse or spirit, is no sense and ridiculous. 
---
Last but not least, if I see a surv with strange perks, that may or not may iron will, unbreakable etc , maybe I will tunnel him because he could makes some problems in endgame. consequently, instead of screwing the killer, he attracts his attention and GG.
---
I tried to search a chest as a killer a few times
---
This round was just so fucking fun! Get found and hooked within the first 5 minutes of loading in, and then proceed to be camped in the basement. I got unhooked once only for him to just come right back down and slap me 😍😍😍
---
BL is legit one of the best surv perks in the game if not the best atm so idk what you mean by that
---
you weren't sure before, but now you know: I'm better than you. There's no need to be so salty about it.
---
hag isnt a dlc character
---
I HAVE NOT DROPPED A PALLET IN 2 DAYS BECAUSE OF FREDDY.
---
You could recharge any exhaustion perk while running, and after this path one year ago, you need to walk or stay without moving.
---
Have you considered getting good at the game like plenty of other red rank survivors that actually present me a challenge as Spirit?
---
We finally have another realm that has more than 1-2 alternative versions of it. Although it's a bummer that it only changes where the main buildings are placed rather than each map having it's own exclusive building
---
Does STBFL work on legions feral frenzy attack?

Shouldve specified that in the meme, that part makes it a lot more funny
---
I'M ANGRY BECAUSE THE "LIKE THIS" LINK ISN'T WORKING
---
I havent got much lucky thoe I played once after the update and thought it was complete utter shit when they said the expanded it like .....ok as if the bad wasnt  bad enough and then pallets are like 6 or 8 away from each other and what not
---
That's a purple add on and don't give her any extra bonus. So it is hard to combinate with the other add on whatever could be.
---
Should’ve only nerfed sprint burst tbh
---
MASTURBATION
---
I love this concept but babysitter seems OP. maybe if you had half the normal deep wound time limit. or maybe if instead of taking another hit for free, it instead gives the person you protected a speed boost similar to sprint burst. Cool idea either way.
---
I thought his original kit was more annoying for the survivor side then anything else. This rework was to make him stronger, but to also make him more interactive and fun to play against for survivors.
---
I’ve played all morning and haven’t had a single Freddy.
---
Should've just left.
---
Really? Hehe boi
---
EVERYONE SPAWNING TOGETHER LITERALLY TWO FEET AWAY FROM THE KILLER.
---
It wasn't nerfed...it was balanced.
---
Now thats a god damn travesty.
---
He's basically a new killer. Give it a week and he should appear less.
---
Did you report this? They need to fix it ASAP.
---
The sprint burst idea was my original idea, but people called it OP.
---
Go figure 🤷‍♂️
---
No he wouldn’t be better than hillbilly... there’s a reason hillbilly is the 3rd best killer in the game and Leatherface is considered one of the absolute worst killers in the game. Hillbilly when using his chainsaw can move at 230% movement speed iirc and can move even faster with addons. This allows him to travel the map at incredibly fast speeds. 
---
Meanwhile Leatherface can’t really use his chainsaw for mobility at all. Sure, he can technically get all 4 survivors down at once but people generally know to split up against him. And mobility is what makes hillbilly one of the best killers while leaving leatherface as a trash killer. This suggested buff would just make Leatherface slightly better in a chase, he’d still be nowhere near as good as hillbilly. 
---
Also what do you mean by perks? Like Knock Out, BBQ &amp; Chili, and Franklin’s Demise? How does a killers perks relate to how viable they are as a killer? Nurse has two pretty bad perks but she’s still the best killer, same goes to hillbilly. Huntress has no good perks but she herself is a pretty decent killer, and Leatherface overall has very good perks (though I wouldn’t willingly use franklins or knock out) but that doesn’t make him any better of a killer.
---
ITS SUCH A MOTIVATOR AS NEW PLAYER SEEING THE SURVIVORS IN YOUR LOBBY HAVE 2K HOURS IN THIS GAME, ON TOP OF THAT THEY’RE THE MOST TOXIC PIECES OF SHIT IN THE GAME.  
---
LETS KEEP RESETTING RANKED EVERY 10 MINUTES.
---
that just want you want me to think
---
NO ONE ESCAPES FUCKING DEATH :(
---
Tunneling is kind of an eh thing. I dont pick someone from the beginning and say that im going to kill them first then fo other stuff. It's pretty situational. I rarely go for the unhooked guy anyway because ds and borrowed are perks that are really popular rn anyway.
---
Slugging on the other hand is something i do all the time. Snowballing as a killer is very effective so if i down someone and see someone else i go for them. Im not trying to make them bleed out however just slow the game down.
---
Never go for camping. Only villains do that.
---
It's garbage for everyone except Legion and maybe Hag.
---
not really. it's fine as it is
---
hes the best BP farmer in game, even with a 0k game you will end up with a shit ton of BP.
---
I play him in red ranks (2-3) and hes more then capable for most games, its just when you get really good SWF teams who spread across the map where he becomes really weak.
---
Then they would be wrong, teleporting across a map to initiate a guaranteed chase (you'll see the scratch marks, you'll find the survivors) is an extreme advantage. The ability to bluff it makes it even better. 
---
Not having to move between long distance gens means you can pressure gens more favorably, and saves actual minutes in a match.
---
The Lullaby in sleep is also very confusing if you know how to red glow mindgame.
---
Sleep happens intermittently but the fact that survivors want to wake up means that he, without doing anything, is already slowing down the game.
---
Mobility is the sign of a good killer. He's at least hillbilly tier; switch out being able to instadown potato survivors into being able to mind game most survivors in dream state and I'd say he's pretty close.
---
Clown just can't win chases fast enough to pressure gens. Freddy can pressure gens across the map mid chase if it's not going well

You try to go for snipe shots with this.
---
I had a pennywise idea too. This is VERY far fetched but I think it’s possible that the devs would consider this in their capabilities. It would be the first killer to act on what survivor your playing. (Sorta how he feeds on specific fears) instead of one power, he has 4 powers based on what “type” of survivor you are.  The 4 main ones set the stage for what types there would be.
---
Cutting to the chase he would have 4 forms the clown would take, activates in the chase and gives you a whole set of play styles to choose from in one game. Each form is just as balanced as the other and would have specific powers. 
---
I haven’t thought of it fully. But it would basically be having 4 killer play styles in one match.
---
Hate to be the one to tell you, but if the spirit has ears, getting good isn’t really an option as you lose every chase quickly.
---
Yep, took me many many tries though. I got a 4k on many of those tries but because I didn't play around enough and drag out the match I didn't get the achievement. I finally got it by getting the last two survivors alive to farm with me, then I killed them. Doesn't seem right.
---
PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO REPORT IMMEDIATELY BUT OFTEN FORGET TO RECOMMEND EACH OTHER AFTER A GOOD MATCH.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ch9svq/killers_how_do_you_deal_with_camp_hate_mail_help/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If 3 people escaped the killer probably depipped as well.
---
Most awesome,  favorite killer or survivor?
---
It's the survivor running away from the totem. That's how I implied it as.
---
IF YOUR TEAMMATE IS RIGHT BY THE HATCH, IS DOWNED AND YOU AND THE KILLER ARE AT THE GATE, FUCKING LEAVE
---
WHY DOESN'T DEAD 'ARD WORK.
---
Thank you BHVR very cool
---
Yeah, dream pallets are a fine ability, that's not at all what I"m talking about. The snares are most definitely a weaker clown ability, though.
---
As for the gen teleport, the cooldown and windup are too slow for genuine pressure, even regardless of sleeping survivors.
---
Ikr, this gets brought up way to often.
---
They should make it so that only people who are rank 10 and below have the power to submit a ticket for valid reasons to Nerf a class. I always hear people saying rank 20s complain there way into a nerf, but my question is, how do you guys know its only rank 20s complaining? Like is there a location where we can see the one making the complaint / also view their rank? it seems a little anecdotal
---
"Leaked" as in "included in the update as raw PNGs like they have been since the store came out"
---
MY POST GAME POINTS ARE NOT SHOWING UP!  IM STILL GETTING THEM BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT!  ON PS444444444
---
This doesn’t really make sense. 
---
Opening a gate has nothing to do with noed, finishing the last gen does.
---
They mean all the banners, not the leaked ones.
---
People who say Legion is bad, he isn't \*that\* bad, his power relies on slowing down survivors objective, by mending. It waste time. Never use that as your power 100% of the time. People think he's a chaser because he can vault. No, it's helpful, but not in chases to end. Only use it to injure someone if needed. 
---
People say he's worse than Freddy. 
---
Honestly, I figured Freddy was better than the Wraith, Freddy at least had stall potential. Wraith had nothing, but this is only my opinion. 
---
Legion is a very decent killer, against a solid SWF, then sadly he isn't much. This goes for EVERY Killer except Nurse, and Spirit. These two can hurt SWF with their power.
---
😂 so true though, I even get at least 1 DC now whenever I use his paintbrush add-on. Which is like super OP
---
I'm not disagreeing (getting tunneled fucking sucks), but it really is a flaw with the design of the game that killers have to follows certain "rules" in order for the game to be fun for all the players.
---
With the cooldown time and windup time, even in that scenario it's difficult to get it to actually build pressure. If anything, it's just a guaranteed chase, but that doesn't help you in a chase and doesn't stop people from working on other gens or slow them down at all.
---
Like I said, real pressure can only come from faking, which most people have realized and will anticipate with such a long cooldown.
---
Ruin doesn't reward poor play as a killer...but NOED does. NOED rewards killers for not putting pressure on gens. NOED rewards killers that dont break chase when they should. Ruin does not. But keep trolling, with better bait, somebody may bite...not me.
---
I was joking you assumed i have a pc and im just used to pc kids acting like they’re so above console kids so I just wanted to make them sound like the uncool ones for once. Where did you get that info though cause thats pretty surprising that more people are playing on pcs than xbox and playstation combined since dbd is free on both consoles game passes now.
---
Do you have any recommendations
---
You realize now he can hit you even when you are awake right?
---
That sounds like a more powerful version of what rule set 2 does.
---
Lol
---
Same but in north America
---
Get a One X
---
I play more survivor than killer but play both a lot. Got every trophy in the base game.
---
Myers is my favorite killer for sure. Don't really have a favorite survivor. Alternates pretty often. Just not Feng Min or Claudette.
---
80% seems a bit inflated, but sure you got “camped” like three times and suddenly it’s an epidemic.
---
People that want to suicide on hook I would guess.
---
It's the perfect deranking perk for when you dont give a fuck but don't want to be banned for constant dcs.
---
Wtf, Ghost Face is so good in my opinion. 
---
I get EZ 4Ks.
---
If the Friday the 13th game was struck with legality issues, I severely doubt the chances of him being a killer here.
---
SPAWNING IN KILLER TERROR RADIUS EVEN THOUGH WE USED VIGO’S SHROUD.
---
STOP FUCKING RUNNING AWAY WHEN YOU MISS A SKILL CHECK ON A GEN!!!!! 9/10 THE KILLER IS HALWAY AROUND THE FUCKING WORLD JUST COMMIT AND FINISH THIS FUCKING FEN WITH ME MEGGG!!
---
Ik how nurse can, but how can spirit?
---
Is this just PS4, or is for all formats?
---
WHY DOES IT TAKE ME SO LONG TO FIND A GAME I JUST WANT THE RANK 15 KILLER EXPERIENCE
---
I mean, for killer there's no need, as you can see their power in their layout, already letting you know who they were gonna play. But for survivors, I agree wholeheartedly.
---
THIS PATCH IS FUCKED OR I AM HAVING THE WORST LUCK BECAUSE I'M GETTING ALL OF THE BUGS. LIKE ALL OF THEM. HOLLY CRAP DUDE, COULDN'T SEE SKILL CHECKS IN 3 GAMES NOW, AND I PLAYED LIKE 10 GAMES IN TOTAL, DESYNC ISSUES WITH KILLER, NEVER HAD BEFORE, JUST LAG SPIKES, NOW ALL OUT DESYNCS, THINKING KILLER LEFT ME AND JUST ENDING UP ON HOOK, OR NURSE JUST GRABBING ME FROM A GEN, DIDN'T EVEN HEAR SHE WAS COMING, AND NO, IM SURE THEY DIDN'T LAGSWITCH. WAITING FOR MORE TO COME.
---
I dunno, pretty much nobody is saying this. there is one post in there that says he is OP - but goes on to just share his opinion then say "what do you think?".
---
Obviously lots of conversation and questions around him because it has just been released. (particularly on console)
---
Meg main gang
---
Teach me your ways. His power gets deactivated   just by the survs pointing their camera at you.
---
Ugh I really hope it’s not Hopper. He’s a good character but he wouldn’t fit as well as Steve or Nancy. Hopper is a huge, beefcake who could step on most of these killers.
---
I am simple man. I see Toradora, I give updoot.
---
Also yes, Ms Yuri is exactly how I feel playing this game sometimes.
---
Did you just text shame me??
---
Right! The highest ranking dev is Queen and she’s rank 10 🙄
---
I've always thought that trapper was DBD's own version of Jason
---
Wha?
---
has BHVR hinted at anything, like with the Plague how they said it would be an "ancient" killer?
---
Or maybe we should just wait for the one DEV dropping the killer into production on "accident" lol......
---
True. There were so many pallets around the shack and the house (with 3 windows and 2 floors), and the decent survivor can loop till 2 or 3 gens are done.
---
I honestly wish they would make that tier up sound his chase music in tier three would make a game against him feel so much more intense
---
being able to view previous game results is just a good feature to have
---
Hillbilly
---
That perk sucks balls I can't believe people are wasting a perkslot, probably their borrowed time perkslot too.
---
1st. breaking chase is stupid most of the time, ca7se im not gonna be in a chase then just stop, of there isnt a reason  then im handicapping myself
---
2nd.your only looking at this from one side, what if 3 people die before even 1 gen gets done and the killer closes the hatch, survivor get adreleine and killer gets noed, is that rewarding the killer or survivor for shit play? or are you so biased that the killer ia the onlg one that can do wrong?
---
I protect momma's chest at all costs
---
Obviously the best option, but that's no fun lol
---
That wasn't my point at all. I'm frustrated because I was being chased and didn't get the chance to do anything else.
---
Honestly, I have mixed feelings about old borrowed time. It was unique and definitely strong, but pretty busted in some scenarios.
---
 It was great for getting out of the basement. Plus killers could just chase untill BT ended if they really wanted to as the deep wounds wasnt a thing yet, it was a good peek in this way. Annoying for the killer, but not too OP.
---
But after the gates were powered a both survivirs could just dash to the ex...
---
No you're supposed to pressure generators instead of being a lazy killer that refuses to engage in chases.
---
*Objectively,* without their perks, Claudette is the best female Survivor (due to hiding very easily) and Ace is the best male Survivor (due to being quiet as hell when injured, practically has a built-in Iron Will lol).
---
Fun fact: Sprint Burst is the only Exhaustion perk that actually also gained some utility from the Exhaustion rework. Namely being able to conserve and trigger it at-will, by keeping your Exhaustion at almost-recovered.
---
(The only downside being that as so many things in this game, this can cause SB to bug out in rare cases, making you stutter rather than sprint.)
---
Great tip my dude, will check.
---
I confirm ;)
---
That's fair enough, but when you first start playing DbD, it seems you objective as killer is... Well, to kill everyone. It's not immediately clear that you get more points from doing more than trying to secure every kill possible. Maybe the game could do a better job of explaining what you should be aiming to do in a game to secure the most points? I dunno what the solution is.
---
Memers
---
That's one extremely rare and unlikely occurrence. To say that your situation applies to every one else is ignorant. There is a reason this meme exists because coms are OP as fuck in this game. You're incorrect
---
It’s always been a bug with unbreakable
---
Catwoman confirmed as new killer
---
Depends on your rank. At lower ranks you don't all 4 iri emblems to double pip (merciless) so you can kill 3 and let one go with the hatch and still double pip if the rest of your emblems are iri.
---
havent been playing in a few months but im lvl 80 dev 1
---
Thoughts on it for Pig?
---
"you can't kill me! I kill me!"
---
Nurse
---
As long as their next OC isn't another lackluster killer like Plague or Legion, I'm all on board.
---
THE ONE TIME I SQUANDER MY SHARDS ON STOOPID COSMETICS A PERK SHOWS UP IN THE SHRINE THAT I DONT HAVE/ACTUALLY WANT.
---
Um, dont camp? 
---
And if you didnt camp, but they accused you of it anyway, then just ignore 'em cause they are obviously just salty.
---
but she was hot tho
---
Lmao! Nothing will shut them (us) up. I use to be guilty of this but stopped doing it. I turned my messages off on ps4 and when I play on PC I will say gg or nothing and leave. I am tired of reading all the negative comments over a game. Good luck out there!
---
I guess the general idea here is that since you spent most of the game running, you couldn't rack up points in other categories and thus got a bad score.
---
I understand this in the context of the killer, to dissuade them from tunneling, and teach them to disengage, but this really doesn't make sense for a survivor.
---
You really don't have a choice in how long the killer decides to tunnel you and you get punished for it. The only other option is just to let them down you, but that doesn't make any sense. 
---
I think on the survivor side, chase points should be able to cross over into objective if you maintain a chase throughout the completion of a gen.
---
For instance, if you run the killer you gain chase points (which i think go in the bold category?). However, if a gen gets completed while you  have been in a chase for at least 10 seconds, you should get an objective scoring event like say 500 pts.
---
This could also apply to saves, 100 for someone getting healed while you're in a chase and maybe 200 for an unhook?
---
It really doesn't make sense to punish the survivor in this way.
---
I have a hard time distinguishing MicroSleep from Full Sleep.
---
I started the game in Micro so I didn't understand what was going on. Then I busted a Generator and it didn't wake me up. Then I tried a clock and it still wouldn't let me use it and then I was hooked and woke up....
---
I'm confussed.
---
I didn't say it's never like this. it's less rare than you think tho.
---
also, comms are OP at the high ranks, as many SWF groups can't even tell eachother what's going on and where
---
Just a little bit
---
Hey they said they were gonna make the hitbox for headon more consistent so for all we know its not a bug
---
I am rank 12 cause I was busy getting platinum on Bloodstained lol. Working my way back to purple now
---
Yup, been running Iron Will ever since I started playing and got it as a teachable. Super strong against everyone, but specifically against the two killers you REALLY need to help from perks to beat.
---
Including you.
---
He means the killer is still chasing hil instead of going for the guy opening the gate which a killer should do
---
I usually get a good laugh at the salt survivors put in the post game chat. I don't take it too seriously and don't attempt to shut them up.
---
I’d honestly put Freddy snare on the same level of the clown bottle just with their own strengths and weaknesses. 
---
Freddy requires the survivor to be asleep but has pseudo infinite traps he never has to recharge and is better for cutting people off at pallets and windows. 
---
Clown can slow at any time he has a bottle ready, but needs to refill and reload but is more forgiving because the base zone is bigger and is better for stopping people out in the open.
---
Thats normal it should be fine in a few days
---
Not wahluigi?
---
Ye sure, I agree with you that snares are weaker than the other things of the rework, btw I think now Freddy is pretty good but I didn't play that much with and against him today so I should wait a bit more before give other judgements.
---
Back in the day, it used to be like that
---
I mean, I dont mind tunnelers at rank 15 or shit, they suck anyway and survs are definitely able to outplay em. Though I see tunnelers at any rank. Even at red ranks. And if youre above rank 10, you should know what youre doin.
---
I'M A KILLER MAIN AND THE QUEUE IS SO LONG I DECIDED TO TRY OUT SURVIVOR. I NOW KNOW WHAT FARMING FOR POINTS MEANS AND I HATE THE MEG WHO SAVED ME 2 FT IN FRONT OF THE KILLER TWICE IN A ROW. WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME? THE HAG WAS PUTTING A TRAP RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY HOOK... SHE WAS RIGHT THERE! 
---
NOW, AS A KILLER, I WILL DEDICATE MY TIME TO TUNNEL FARMERS. YOU DID THIS TO ME, MEG.
---
your title suggests you're going to review the rework, which wasn't what you did. killer queues were terrible before the rework and it only made them worse. that's what always happens when new shit goes live
---
Hot damn, Freddy on par with Nurse/Billy/Spirit?
---
Because it ruins the game for the survivors, I want to make it fun for everyone
---
Where is my bbq and chili? Bought it when it came out and never saw it once
---
Was just hesitating about buying dlc for lithe and now it's in the shrine. GG me
---
Why tho?
---
No it wouldn't?
---
In a little bit on the road map it says it will start rolling out the same time as Freddy rework so we just gotta wait alittle bit longer
---
Is a Stranger Things chapter a community wet dream or an official thing? 
---
I hope it's the latter because honestly, despite them both being horror IPs ST and DBD are oil and water. There are way waaaaay better IPs to pull from especially if you want a mind control / infiltration type killer (like John Carpenter's The Thing)
---
Jag tycker att det är inte så cringyt men de kan definitivt förbättra översättningarna
---
For a beginner i would start with wraith, his power is simple and straight forward. Also trapper is good for beginners
---
Yeah, he's fine, I just think it's an unoriginal rework. I found the old freddy to have much more interesting mechanics, despite being objectively weaker at high ranks. You could do a bunch of unique builds with him. Now you just use pop, brutal strength, and perks that would do well with clown.
---
None of the killers are truly scary. Not to me anyway. The only things akin to a horror experience that can sometimes be felt in this game are a mild sense of stress or distress, and jumpscares.
---
Pinhead could certainly make for a cool killer.
---
agree with them
---
be like "yea I felt like being a dick ;) it's funny to see you cry"
---
Technically was a nerf, just a much needed one.
---
"GG". Because no matter how you play, some 15 year old Twitch streamer will say you camped.
---
NOT TO BE RUDE, BUT IF A SINGLE SURVIVOR LOOPS YOU FOR THAT LONG, YOU SHOULD GO LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE
---
If you are currently Sarah and enter a chase or get stunned, you will become Madison UNTIL you lose/end the chase completely.  After losing/ending the chase you will return as Sarah again until you chase someone or get stunned.
---
Also, 10 seconds for Madison's power could be changed because this was just a rough idea for a power.  I'm sure a completely different power for her could be a lot better.
---
The endgame thing wasn’t really a nerf. Her RBTs were never designed to be solely used for the endgame. They were specifically designed to push survivors off gens and waste time and should be used before all the gens popped. If pig worked the same with EGC, she’d be a joke, like a completely unfair character to play against. It wasn’t a nerf, it was an alteration for balance that, if you played her optimally, wouldn’t have actually hurt you.
---
There's a difference. When phasing, Spirit can see your scratchmarks, but you get no warning (mid-chase). So you'll be running away then she'll suddenly just teleport behind you.
---
Hillbilly has his revving and Nurse has her gasp. If you are in her terror radius, Spirit has NOTHING.
---
Yeah they had to come out and say the issue and it wasn’t a big one if I remember correctly.  just bullshit between them and Sony
---
He's feels more like a master of dreams instead of a handicapped jackass.
---
You have to play cat and mouse. Constantly. Try to always have cover to hide and lean from, if someone you're stalking looks at you while leaning just dip behind cover and pop back out again. This way they cant knock you out of it and you'll get easy marks if they think they'll win a staring contest.
---
And it shouldn't be like that, considering the only hard survivor ones are Laurie and David because you'll get tunneled for the perks. It's ridiculous how the emblem system favors survivors and stuff, so even if they did have to pip or something, it'd be extremely easy.
---
CAN I PLEASE STOP GETTING AUTOHAVEN AS LEATHERFACE AND SWAMP AS EVERY OTHER KILLER PLEASE?!?!
---
The first emblem reflects it too.
---
I've run Killers for all 5 gens before and (with the recent addition of 'Killer diversion' points to the Lightbringer) you should get a Gold Lightbringer for helping your teammates do gens.
---
Time to rise up, gamers?
---
Is this gonna be the same for ps4?
---
I dont think so the patch notes say if you already have them you keep the perks but any other character you level won't have Bill's perks until you get them teachable from him.
---
Because the minority in both camps are extremely vocal and highly unpleasant. Most people I play with are pretty cool.
---
Don't let this subreddit sour you on the community.
---
How do you get him for free?
---
I’d say yeah maybe a day or two cause they would have to go to Sony and such to get it done up but generally same day
---
you should see one of his more recent survivor games where he tries a medic build.
---
It consists of him getting the interaction lock glitch then looping a Huntress for 2+ minutes at a double pallet spawn and when he finally goes down, there's a Meg with crows carefully walking up to him to unhook him, then when he goes back to the loop, an Ash starts healing him and the Huntress comes back, the Ash panics and instantly throws down the pallet and then Monto is still stuck unable to heal, and then he couldn't leave at the end and died to the EGC.
---
I'm talking about those times when there's no window or pallet nearby. 
---
What do you do then?
---
Yeah, I wanted to work toward the self unhook achievement while using Kate, who is my only Lvl 50 P3 character, which required me to not only unlock the teachable but go through like a dozen Lvl 50 bloodwebs to actually get it for her. So frustrating.
---
Mobility is great on a killer but the tp CD on Freddy is way longer than the Billy chainsaw and he can use it to catch up to survivors midchase so I don't think their mobility is equivalent. Billy's mobility doesn't go down throughout the game (as gens get done) and he can use it to patrol exit gates. 
---
Still a lot of pluses and minuses to these killers but Billy is still mobility king over Freddy.
---
I'm quite sure you can't change the title
---
exactly &lt;3 I haven't played the game as much lately and I forgot about that
---
Nah, I don't think so. I think if they were to release a Stranger Things chapter with The Demogorgon as the killer, they'd have some way to pull a survivor into the Upside Down from the real world, and the survivor would have to find a portal to return to the real world. Sort of like pre-rework Freddy but not really.
---
Yep, and they could improve it quite simply by increasing the number of perks available per level (the entity could still consume all but the one you take first), or at the very least not including a perk for the next X levels if you intentionally pass it up.  
---
I was at 3-50 with Kate and had multiple times where I opted to not take either perk offered only to see one of them offered again the next time around. Infuriating.
---
Just keep checking Twitter
---
HOW THE FUCK IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN FOR ANY OF THE PLAYERS INVOLVED? IT TOOK CLOSE TO 4 MINUTES TO FIND THIS GAME AND THE MATCH WAS OVER IN ROUGHLY 2 MINUTES. IT’S 11 AM IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER. IS THIS REALLY THE BEST THAT MATCHMAKING CAN COME UP WITH? GET REAL.
---
SURVIVOR SIDE FOR ME IS NO DIFFERENT. I’M PAINFULLY TRYING TO CLIMB AS SOLO SURVIVOR (CURRENTLY RANK 12) AND EVERY. SINGLE. MATCH. MY TEAM WILL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS: 
---
-RANK 12 (ME)
---
-RANK 18 WITH 1 PERK
---
-RANK 20 WITH 1 PERK
---
-RANK 18 WITH 4 PERKS
---
THEN WE’RE MATCHED UP AGAINST A KILLER THATS EITHER CLOSE TO MY RANK (12) WITH A FULL LOADOUT OR A RANK 18-20 WITH 1 PERK AND NO ADD-ONS. IT’S FUCKING RIDICULOUS AND NOT FUN—AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE WKTH EVERY SINGLE “MATCHMAKING ADJUSTMENT” THAT THE DEVS MAKE. https://i.imgur.com/HsL7vCv.jpg
---
Luck only affects chances of escaping Hook and Bear Traps.
---
[I checked the wiki, and this says it actually *does* affect chest odds, though I'm not sure if that's a typo because I'm 99% sure luck has no affect on chest odds.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Luck)
---
Yeah I just added something extra to say something else
---
Well u wrote two comments I only wrote one so nah brAAAAAAAH u chill
---
Huntress?
---
Aye that's true. 
---
I do wonder sometimes though if people have different definitions of tunnelers. There's been times where I've been playing killer and it just so happens I've come across the same survivor a few times in a row (for instance after said survivor was unhooked, he was the one I came across again first). In times like that I often wonder if the survivor thinks I'm tunneling them, but it has just worked out that way. Usually if the same survivor is about to get hooked for the 3rd time in a row I just down them and leave so a teammate can heal them up (or even just ignore them completely and look for someone else).
---
Thing is, I've had games where I 100% haven't been tunneling or camping but have had survivors still accuse me of it anyway. You just can't please some survivors as a killer. At a certain point survivors have to accept the blame for repeatedly being found and hit over their teammates.
---
For April Fool's Day, they should make the shrine all No Mither, just for that day.
---
When she screamed and jumped but then told herself “calm down, you got this”, I felt that.
---
I sort of wouldn't mind an Old Freddy-esque killer so people who liked Old Freddy's playstyle would be happy. 
---
Don't just copy-paste Old Freddy, but make him play similar to Old Freddy while making him more fun to play against, somehow.
---
I disagree, as doubly pointed out now. It’s a good perk in nature, and against lower level players it’s great. However against players with common game knowledge and some semblance of skill I find it a useless perk. The purpose of the perk is to force survivors onto gens solo. However, the game already gives incentive to do so, namely lowering the repair rate of the gen with multiple survivors on it. As well, when playing as a killer, pressure is the most important thing to have. Discordance places very little pressure on survivors, and after it’s found actually relieves pressure from survivors. 
---
If you’d like to dispute for your side by all means go ahead, but please do try with more than ‘You’re wrong, it’s a top-tier perk’
---
Crappy thing about playing ps4 we got song
---
I got camped and I was the only one hooked the whole game. It wasn't a long game either. Wraith on Rotten Fields. If I died so soon, I would have none for each
---
Leatherface and spirit Leatherface can be fun if you have dumb survivors and you get barbecue and chill and spirit is also fun very satisfying when you grab someone off a gen
---
I was playing Bubba and had 3 survivors tbagging at the gate once it was opened. Little did they no that NOED kicked in and I downed 2 of them. Hooked one and mori’d the other. Then I get the hate mail. Well if you aceholes would have just taken your win instead of trying to taunt me, I would’ve let you crawl out.
---
Myers is fun to play as and decent. He has a good stealth and pretty good snowball potential.
---
Hag is pretty good, as strong as hillbilly imo (except in rotten field). She can be hard to pick up but will destroy teams if you learn how to play her properly.
---
Doctor can be fun, but you will get looped for 5 gens as him.
---
Leatherface is the worst killer. Only get him for barbecue or get it in the shrine.
---
Pig is my favorite killer. She has a good stall and her ambush can end chases quickly if survivors are in an area with short loops. She can be strong in the end game, but she is getting nerfed every update D:
---
Freddy is pretty fun now, he can teleport and set snares or place pallets. He can also make you blind inside the yamaoka house.
---
Clown, you will not be looped for 5 gens, however those 5 gens will pop very fast. He is not really strong, and I don't personally like him.
---
Spirit is very hard to pick up, but is stronger than hillbilly against good survivors. She is very fun to play as.
---
Legion is kinda boring to me. He can get easy first hits but then you will just get looped.
---
Plague is the killer with lowest kill rate. She is fun if survivors cleanse.
---
Ghostface is like Myers, but his stealth is better but he has less snowball potention.
---
Don’t think they have since they’ve only just released the rework for Freddy.
---
You don’t need to sacrifice your fun but you know dam well you can’t ruin other fun to.its funny when you say games suppose to be fun while you ruin others fun
---
I’m not a camper but don’t push me
---
Are you on PC or console? On PC A Lullaby for the Dark is unlocked automatically (The Huntress/David DLC). On Console (from what I've seen from my friends who play this on Xbox) the DLC is free, but you have to still go to the store to "Purchase" it.
---
SERIOUSLY WHY THE FUCK ISN'T THERE AN INTERNAL COOL-DOWN FOR FLASHLIGHT ACTIVATION AND CROUCHING? THE ONLY REASON TO REPEATEDLY CLICK A FLASHLIGHT OR REPEATEDLY CROUCH IS JUST TO BE TOXIC, AND YET BEHAVIOR DOESN'T REMOVE THESE COMPLETELY POINTLESS MECHANICS. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT BEHAVIOR DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE TOXICITY PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY KEEP ADDING PERKS LIKE RANCOR AND TOOK NEARLY 3 YEARS TO EVEN CONSIDER IMPLEMENTING A MECHANIC TO PUNISH DCERS. 3 YEARS LATER WE STILL DON'T HAVE A COUNTER TO CAMPING AND HARD TUNNELING AND BEHAVIOR WONDERS WHERE THIS "US V.S. THEM" MENTALITY COMES FROM.
---
THIS! 
---
I’d do the same if I had ruin unlocked. But damn it’s to warm here to not get angry. Every Freddy I’ve gone up against has ruin.
---
I am of the same opinion for this one and for the "Evil incarnate" achiev
---
Is fucking nuts that a survivor can deny it by DCing once they know what you are going for, even the locker camping shit is still manageable if you can haul his ass away from lockers and have PWYF with 3 stacks, but a DC? no way.
---
Looks like a chat toggle, though I guess it's up to me to resist looking at it anyway. I'd love something that completely hides it, but this great on its own. Thanks!
---
I lost him once or twice, so it wasn't one gigantic chase, but I was still within 16m of him though I "escaped" the chase. Maybe that affected it or something.
---
His lunge range is the same as all the others. The devs have said and shown this over and over. 
---
What throws people off are his teeny little arms actually stretch for the animation, but if a Freddy lunge hits you, you can at least take comfort in knowing any other killer would have hit you as well.
---
Freddy with BBQ and PGTW is probably one of the single best comboes around now. Pretty nightmarish once he gets a few hooks going, snowball with his map pressure and slow the game down a ton.
---
Yeah at least that happened
---
Can I comment to say I upvoted? Name’s not chad tho
---
ALSO STOP DCING AGAINST NEW FREDDY HOLY FUCKING SHIT. HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO LEARN HOW TO COUNTER A KILLER WHEN YOU DC AGAINST THEM ON FIRST DOWN? EVERY MATCH I'VE HAD BOTH AS AND AGAINST FREDDY THERE'S BEEN SOMEONE WHO DCS OR SUICIDES ON FIRST DOWN. MY FREDDY ISN'T EVEN THAT GOOD BUT I GET 2 DCS AGAINST FREDDY VERSUS ZERO DCS ON MY P3 TRAPPER WHEN I HAVE TWO PEOPLE IN TRAPS AND THEN ON HOOKS BEFORE A SINGLE GEN IS DONE.
---
ALSO UNRELATED: TRAPPER TRAP RNG IS THE FUCKING BEST. HAD A MATCH WHERE 3 PEOPLE IN A ROW MANAGED TO PULL THEMSELVES OUT OF THE BEAR TRAP ON THEIR FIRST TRY.
---
wait for bhvr to realize killers need a buff
---
Rah boi slippery meat
---
Tfw it's been two years and people still don't know Freddy's lunge is identical to any 115% killer
---
I'd say you're right.
---
Freddy has some caveats (and opportunities) that billy doesn't have.
---
I was more alluding to his mobility+dream fuckery puts him with billy as powerful killers that can be looped but still pull it together agaisnt most teams. Mobility playing a key role in that vein.
---
The new Ace cosmetic is looking good, cool Wraith too.
---
Yeah soooo my statement was right then. Congrats you played yourself.
---
It's a theorized thing. Netflix Games(I think, it was definitely Netflix but idk which of their many branches) tweeted that they had Stranger Things crossover events ready for Roblox, Epic, and BHVR.
---
Roblox had some event revealed, Hopper and the Demogorgon were limited time skins in Fortnite, and now we don't know what's supposed to happen with BHVR, but if it's not a new game it's likely Stranger Things will get a chapter in DBD
---
Huntress really doesn’t even need add-ons to be good, but generally the best would be ones that increase hatchet wind-up speed and movement while aiming.
---
As for perks, Spies From the Shadows can be absolutely god tier on her. Combine it with Whispers and you’ll have zero problems finding survivors. These two easily justify bumping Nurses out of your kit.
---
Wow, a survivor concept with actually useable perks??? This is a first. Someone actually knows how to balance for once.
---
I MEAN RANK DOESN'T EVEN MATTER BECAUSE RANK 2S GET INTO RANK 10 GAMES.
---
YESTERDAY I HAD A MATCH WHERE THIS ONE FENG LOOPED ME FOR LIKE HALF THE GAME EVERY TIME I FOUND HER, AND THE OTHER THREE SURVIVORS WERE POTATOES WHO DIED INSTANTLY. GAME ENDS AND FENG IS FUCKING **RANK 2** WHILE THE REST ARE **RANK 12 AND BELOW. [I'M RANK 8.](/intensifies)**
---
Ehhh yeah but that's borderline exploit which isn't cool not to mention the fact that everytime you drop them you make it less and less likely you'll even make a hook.  Them wiggling off from drops might as well be a flashlight save.  Just beat them my way.  You won't get saved against ever and there's no cheese, just asserting dominance and turning their flashlight into a cosmetic.
---
I MEAN RECOMMENDATIONS DO LITERALLY NOTHING
---
Yikes.
---
That’s the ding spot
---
YOU HAVE 15K MORE POINTS THAN ME YOU ALREADY WIN JUST GIMME THE 5K ESCAPE POINTS YOU WATCHED ME OPEN THE GATE
---
Several of his add-ons are pretty weak. This isn't a new thing. People have been saying this about his add-ons since the PTB. Here is a solution.
---
But could you imagine if it was an active ability? I would call it
---
Dead hard 2: dead harder
---
My favorite thing about killers is when they've been slugging and two people are able to get up because of adrenaline. 
---
I fully get it though, it's not like noed gives you a permanent speed boost. Could you imagine in "Adrenaline" and "Hope" we're the same perk???
---
IF THEY EXIST THEY SHOULD COUNTER WEIGHT FOR NEGATIV REPORTS.
---
Alright thanks
---
As for aim, putting something on your screen won’t help you out much since the arc, speed, and distance traveled change based on how long you hold the power. Generally just practice, aim, and wait for survivors to make a mistake in your line of sight that will lock them in place for a moment, like vaulting a window, or dropping a pallet
---
I've got 250 hours but I'm level 40 because most of it was before they added levels 🤠🔫
---
It's broken.  You can activate it and you don't get the dash at all lol.  Ate 2 downs because of it.  Just one of the most used meta perks in the game not functioning no biggie.  Pretty good job so far.
---
Protip: The shape one is pretty easy to do in low ranks and its very easy if you use a Lery's offering and a Mirror addon, all you have to do is use your wallhacks to surprise hit them or pull them from gens and maybe do a quick down if you have enough STBFL tokens, dont camp, hook, walk and locate the next slash victim.
---
I got the trapper quite easily because I got it before they changed it to needing a merciless :/
---
They did fix it, notice how it still takes time to gain on the survivor? They have agitation so the killer moves faster enough to catch up and swinging rapidly doesn’t effect movement speed so everything is working together properly. You all need to calm down and stop jumping to conclusions.
---
Sorry 😂
---
this just restored my faith in being a killer main thank you man
---

Pretty Good JOb SOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooo FaR
---
Blue shorts guy for new DBD Killer
---
Is lightweight actually worth it?
---
I had like 5 Swing Chains lying around and holy shit that addon is cancer.
---
Class Photo is also super good. Been running the two of them together and have been doing very well.
---
I did, low rank survivors, corn map, I had addons to help me gain evil within faster, they kept doing risky saves and running around all map, it was pretty easy.
---
I run small game for a reason.
---
ah okay, thanks for breaking it down
---
So confused
---
How so? Because you don't do the original scream or something?
---
you can look up the sell-statistics online
---
It is indeed broken from the last update.  Sometimes it functions normally and others (for me always against Freddy) it sometimes does not work at all.  You don't get the dash animation you kind of just stutter there for a second.  Use at your own risk until they fix.
---
I demand an updated model where Meg is swole!
---
Anytime you get the "dream demon" score event it counts toward it.
---
It honestly shouldn't even be a 4k because of the hatch. (Though I mean now you can block the hatch so it's way easier.) As long as you pip you should get the Adept achievement.
---
Same with Survivor tbh, so that you can't just hide in a locker and then take the hatch.
---
Shadowborn and Iron Maiden are both moreso Quality of Life perks for Huntress, they aren’t required or as useful as other perks but you can run them if you feel you’re doing well in one area.
---
I don’t even know who you are lmao.
---
I'm not sure if we talk about the same thing to be honest. Because I'm talking about the PTB Head On that stunned the killer nonstop without even jumping out of the locker
---
Yeah this needs to be fixed asap, just wanna say Pretty good job so far devs :(
---
Hag is way better than the new freddy...
---
Hey mom can I have Hex: Ruin?
---
No we have Hex: Ruin at home.
---
Hex: Ruin at home - Monstrous Shrine 3, Unrelenting 3, Play With Your Food 3, Dying Light 3, Tinkerer 3, Furtive Chase 3...
---
You almost always pipped compared to now when it's a lot harder to. You needed 8k to safety, 10 to pip, and 20k to double pip BUT pips only counted the first 5k in a catagory.
---
I don't think either system is that great because for the first everyone would naturally drift towards rank 1 to easily and for the new one killers can get a 4k and only safety pip.
---
Terror radius perkd shouldn't affect his Lullaby.
---
Yea I was playing about a year before player levels
---
Literally finished leveling Feng Min from lvl. 12 to 35 just to unlock Lithe on Tuesday night lol
---
&gt;Been suggested a billion times and I still don't know why it isn't in the game
---
He's fine, his addons are fine.  Devs made it so we can run pallets every single game if we so choose.  With killers like Legion and Pig who desperately need buffs to their addons I don't know how Freddy even popped into your head.
---
Simply Outplayed
---
the spirit is a zombie and ghost at the same time since it can touch people and phase through the spirit realm
---
I think im Drunk i see THICC jane everywhere O\_O
---
Glad to see they didn't fix one of the most well-known bugs on the PTB.
---
When i fought freddy with fake pallets, the moment i fell asleep and i saw a pallet infront of me, my mind just kept drawing blanks and nothing but the question: "Was that always there?"
---
Welcome friend now go do a fucking gen
---
Ah, so you basically get the achievement over time just for playing now? Not bad, I’m betting it’ll take longer than it used to though
---
cute i love it keep up the good work
---
Ive noticed im not getting hit as far thhrough windows as i used to so that seems to be fixed, but now killers are lunging from even farther just in general and getting regular hits like its. Nothing
---
That's normal now, don't worry, in a few days you will see again Nurse, Spirit and Billy.
---
Can you fucking imagine Trapper just leaning forward and booking it towards the survivors? Like just imagine how terrifying that would look. This like 7'10'' man just sprinting after you, huge ass cleaver raised. 
---
I'd shit myself
---
love this pic lol made my day
---
People feel like they can abuse whatever gives them an advantage, to hell with everyone else.
---
Other users on the post you linked pointed out major flaws in the OPs claims. 
---
The ranking system is still fucked though
---
You could just learn the game and not camp.  That works really well for me.
---
Plus discordance is a pretty solid perk and iron maiden is bugged rn ;)
---
This was posted yesterday without the totem being lit. Here's proof that it can be lit!

You’ve yee’d your last haw
---
Yes its a bug and im kidding...
---
I MISS OLD FREDDY AND I WORRY ABOUT WHAT HIS CHANGES MEAN FOR OTHER KILLERS THAT DON'T MOVE LIKE GREASED LIGHTNING OR THAT DON'T HAVE INSTADOWNS AS STANDARD. I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP ONE DAY AND FIND THAT KILLERS HAVE GONE FULL SURVIVOR AND YOU'RE ONLY REALLY JUST PICKING A SKIN.
---
I just played him and I'm kinda feelin like he's in yikes territory.
---
You are just as toxic as me dude, You sound like someone who sucks at the game and just pretends they are good by trying to put other people down. Maybe try not being such a sore loser dick.
---
Are people really already asking for a nerf I really hope he doesn’t he’s so fun to play now especially with friends
---
Currently if you click the gear and then click "Game Info" it will show you the names of who is who, just like if you press Start/Escape in-game, where it shows the offerings and names.
---
Every killer has the same lunge range when using the basic hit lmao
---
Dude this happens with literally every killer release/rework no matter how godly/trash the killer
---
I'm not any role main lol, but think whatever you want, It was proposed in a discord server and I did this picture. We all reposted it
---
Survivor: Does anything
---
Monto: I knew he was going to do that
---
Well, at least half of his add-on are not worth using. Block add-ons are completely garbage now.
---
SURVIVORS TEARS DONT STOP RUNNING!

Yep I play on PS4 and I tried to use dead hard about 5 times last night. It worked 1 of those times. Thanks game!

That was fixed I believe
---
sorry im resistent towards irony and sarcasmn. Can never tell
---
I’m not sure. LF even looked slightly confused there too. There’s been times people have messaged me saying I lag switched and they had proof. And honestly I don’t know how to do any of that shit and my internet speed is pretty high. Sometimes the servers just suck
---
I thought I was going crazy yesterday. Glad it's just the devs being incompetent again.
---
Wraith and Hillbilly.
---
Why would he enjoy being a cheap perk abuser?
---
I'm going to Mori your son in the ribs.
---
I will mori you
---
Do I need to watch a pro play Hillbilly or something? I really don't get how he's such high tier, he doesn't seem that good
---
that'd give you an iridescent evader almost right away then.
---
sadly a lot of people actually think he's OP
---
It was fixed. You aren't gaining any speed from the constant attack, you just have no cooldown. The rapid swinging is Mad Grit and it doesn't give you extra speed. That extra speed is from Agitation.

---
I agree. You should delete the post.
---
I am very new to the game, can someone explain to me what noed is?
---
They don't. Dream pallets would be useless if this was a thing, anyway.
---
High end Jojoke.
---
It doesn't apply though because Avdol was giving Pol a knife out of respect so he didn't have to suffer. Hook farmers deserve a slow painful fiery death to Magician's Red.
---
It depends on how fast are the hard drives of the other players
---
There's also the fact that his power is on a 60 second timer, and he's essentially a default Killer without his power.

#For The Team

Welp, I mean I took the scene out of context to make a funny meme but yeah you're right.
---

The are not bad. Personally their change made them more fun to play as and a lot less annoying to play against. I do find them a bit perk dependent, with bloodhound, nurses, and thanataphobia being amazing on them and they feel a bit neutered without at least on or two of them. I think the reason people see them as weak now is because they are using their power wrong. Their power was never about downing survivors but rather stalling the game and making them waste time mending
---
I think the best solution is to get scores as a TEAM.
---
none of the survivors escape? All survivors get -2 pips.
---
A single survivor escape? All survivors -1 pip.
---
2 survivor escape? 0 pip for all
---
3 survivors escape? 1 pip for all
---
4 survivors escape? 2 pip for all.
---
This way if you are unlucky and get hard tunneled, but everyone else escape, you still pip because you deserve it.
---
Ahhh ok
---
IT GIVES YOU A FREE MORI ON A RANDOM SURVIVOR JUST FOR RUNNING A PERK. IT'S LITERALLY UNCOUNTABLE NOED ON STEROIDS. IT'S FINE WHEN A SURVIVOR IS ACTUALLY RUNNING AN OBSESSION PERK BUT IT SHOULDN'T CREATE AN OBSESSION ON ITS OWN. ONLY IF A SURVIVOR HAS AN OBSESSION PERK SHOULD IT LET YOU MORI THEM.
---
I agree it's underrated but this clip would have been the same if you slow entered the locker
---
Ik but he could’ve seen the door close
---
I’m console also. Why isn’t Nurse as viable on console? I just figured I sucked playing her
---
Spirit is a tough first killer to go against. Hopefully he sticks with it, and you two can enjoy the game together!
---
He couldn't, you get in the locker at 20s and still no killer coming at 28s slow enter doesn't take 8 seconds
---
Its op once you realize it counters most killer cheese like noed, haunting grounds, ghostface power, myers tier 3, iridescent head huntress, and nurse's calling.
---
It’s strange that you have to wait so long as a survivor. It’s usually killer ques that are long. 
---
I hate it as much as you do, but there is only one solution:  we have to get better at not getting caught.  Be patient when on the hook and make the killer regret his actions by allowing the rest of your team to finish gens. If you’re suiciding on hook, you’re rewarding the killer’s behavior and reinforcing his strategy.
---
Well the add-on to put Dream Snares on vaults is a common add-on. And I disagree with you that he has great add-ons at all tiers. Yes his Ultra Rare add-ons are good and a few of his very rare *(I didn't touch those)*, but you are completely brushing over his Block add-ons.
---
And let's not forget that he has a rare add-on that does the same thing as a common, but reveals Survivors auras for 6 seconds...
---
Like I said above, I agree that other Killers need some love but Freddy is fresh, meaning they are bound to make some changes and soon and this would be a prime time for some of his weaker add-ons to either get reworked or buffed.
---
I’ve played as killer once and had to wait a long time also
---
It's short for No One Escapes Death, a killer perk.
---
&gt;  I have to wait ages for queues as a survivor
---
This part is strange because atm there is a big influx of killers wanting to try freddy. Survivors queues are very fast right now.
---
Also in my experience at higher ranks there is less face campers, and more survivors with enough balls to go for it anyways.
---
\*plays menacing piano\*
---
That could be cool. What you're saying is when a survivor gets downed or hooked they turn into a killer?
---
Or a Spirit with prayer beads
---
And I always struggle on the hooks and don’t suicide or atempt escape
---
thank you
---
Shalisa
---
Ey, Want some "Balanced landing"?
---
I don't think you know what coaching is.
---
Downed 3 times, not hooked. Imagine trying to get anyone on a hook with 19 people body blocking
---
Shit they fixed sprint burst and broke dead hard :/ tine to use lithe i guess
---
I have a One X plus an SSD. Game is still choppy af
---
STBFL is a great perk to pick up. I run it on Plague and I can use my power to damage the obsession without losing any tokens. Very useful in reducing chase time.
---
Laugh
---
There is a hook killers can get stuck on as well
---
Mad grit for the win!
---
It’s just really hard to get a precise blink with a controller than it is with a mouse, hence why a good console nurse is so unbelievably rare.
---
Nurse is already hard on PC, trying to play nurse with a controller takes the difficulty to a whole new level.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they reduced the tokens.  10 does feel like a bit much.
---
&gt;Imitate Survivors 
---
&gt;SWF literally existing. 
---
Ohshitherewegoagain.jpeg
---
OP its not Thicc Thursday till tomorrow!
---
I think it would be fun to try it out but i got a feeling it would favor survivors. Going without ruins is hard.
---
Much better then old freddy, fun to play and not too boring, and is pretty balanced
---
Mood.
---
Because she likes it, obviously. Don't kink shame
---
The glitch starts at the beginning of the game, anything they do after will still leave them fucked, so them healing wasn’t the problem.
---
Would never work. Too many people kill themselves on hook or just aren't the best at the game it wouldn't be possible to get out of even rank 20 with this system
---
Eh. He alright. I mean I only played one game but that one game was nice. The snares I used more of as location security more than slows but other than that I like it. Gen porting is neat and with the add on to make all gens spee blood and no projection show up untill you're actually there is really entertaining.
---
I’m rank 20 becuase I haven’t been able to play that much
---
You are asking two questions here
---
I haven’t tried Class Photo yet but honestly I’ve made so many plays by baiting my power then cancelling it that I’m not sure I even want to try it.
---
Why would you suggest one of the two weakest killers in the game? I know its meant for beginner, but goddamn give them a good beginner character that is actually worth a damn, like pig. Nani tf?
---
Affect on pc as well
---
The implication is that the person doesn't like the game so they shouldn't care about the game, but there they are still following the game. So it'd be more like "You're still an asshole." "Yeah well you're still following me on Twitter."
---
Not everyone has mad grit, and i wonder what the other perks could do in this game mode. Maybe they could be tweaked to better influence this game mode, but change to normal in a normal game.
---
Ex. Thrilling tremors could put up walls around you in a path to the closest hook for a few seconds.
---
Me saying camping is a toxic strategy puts people down????
---
It was legit just a pic of the jotaro perk you made lmao
---
I see a gay camper
---
Lmao I just realised that wtf 😂
---
Yeah this is what he excels at.  Run Sloppy and Thanatophobia on him.  If they heal they lost the game.  If they don't heal then you get to play against a team of loud No Mithers making your job easier.  I'm enjoying using him in my rotation post rework.
---
Or just get rid of perk levels entirely. No reason I need to unlock the same perk 3 times...
---
Devotion 6 that’s insane well done. Does devotion levels do anything or is it just to show how much you played?
---
I english good yes?
---
Yea im gonna try playing as him more when I get more perks on him.
---
You mean regular matchmaking?
---
If you didnt purposely tunnel, its fine. Survivors are toxic idiots nowadays. I play nurse at high ranks and still get accused of camping. If the unhooked happens to be the first one to run into you, its his fault, not yours.
---
classic insidious bubba
---
Yea they changed the hitboxes, but I really need people to stop blindly looking at the patch notes and just blindly saying "Lmao must be fixed then". The hitboxes are still fucked, Nurse, Freddy, pig, clown all need to be changed still
---
I don't understand why those people don't understand that this is what always happens after something new comes out. Of course people are going to be playing that thing a lot.
---
If you didnt purposely tunnel, its fine. Survivors tend to be toxic idiots nowadays. I play nurse at high ranks and still get accused of camping. If the unhooked happens to be the first one to run into you, its his fault, not yours.
---
Thank you for all this information :) (read the 2 comments below too) though SFTS? don't people recommend to stay away from this perk even for Huntress?
---
Cool beans
---
I'm really hoping this stays because it is absolutely hilarious.
---
You have to pay money for pig, not something most beginners are going to do.
---
Her ambush hit no longer counts as an M1 hit so she cant get Save The Best For Last stacks with it or cant hit people who are exposed and down them. Perks like NOED and Rancor wont work with Ambush hit.
---
I deal with it by not camping in the first place
---
Bruh what?  This better be a fucking joke.
---
Yeah I feel like it could be useful on new freddy
---
I guess. But still, kinda throwing a new player into the deep end with those two. I know there isnt many options if youre completely new to the game
---
They don't do anything yet. Doesn't mean they won't eventually. The player level system is still fairly new
---
It's pretty obvious, they're an idiot.
---
NO MITHER ON THE SHRINE OF SECRETS, WHO TF THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
---
Exactly. Its the new shiny toy everyone is gonna try out.
---
Played last night and this happend once out of prob 15 dead hards from me.   Still annoying though.
---
Keep crying teabagger
---
They are, unlike your untouched beans
---
Yeah, I don't know about this.  The matchmaking gets messed up enough as it is (for a lot of people).
---
Is the cooldown still 45 seconds?
---
wow the entity felt bad for him but you still didnt let him escape? talk about a toxic killer
---
Only have three games with him since the rework. He is a ton of fun now. I do think his dream pallet ability is way too many tokens. Like 10 is too many for the fake pallets maybe make it around 5-7 instead. Definitely B tier now for me. A lot of players think he is Op though I think it is just a case of players having to learn how to play against him again
---
Your second paragraph sounds like you're slightly proxycamping.  It sounds like it's more about defending your hook then it is committing to a new chase to try and down and hook a new survivor.  Over time you'll learn it pays to play aggressively and keep them wasting their time going for unhooks as you keep up the pressure by efficiently chasing and downing your next survivor.
---
And tunneling can also refer to killers that go right back for the just unhooked survivor to redown and rehook.  It's typically combined with a camp or proxycamp playstyle.  Again feels shitty for the other side with exceedingly little counterplay so expect salt if this is what you're doing.  
---
In my experience I don't camp or tunnel and receive next to no salt.  But new players are infamous for playing the opposite way while they're still figuring the game out so you'll probably be receiving salt for a while.
---
any applicable ones.
---
Not to play devils advocate, but bt is bad in the sense that it doesnt help survs learn how to make safe saves, when theres zero risk.
---
Can't level everyone at the same time
---
I don’t t bag but ok. I only t bag when I know I’m going to die not when I get the exit gate
---
WHY IS IT WHEN EVERY UPDATE COMES AROUND THIS COMMUNITY JUST SHUTS DOWN. PEOPLE JUST MESS AROUND AND NOT GIVE AN EFFORT. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO LEARN PEOPLE JUST WAIT FOR THINGS TO COOL DOWN, THIS COMMUNITY FUCKING SUCKS!!!!
---
You have to run it on hag, to have time to set up, otherwise 3 gens will pop before you even smack first survivor.
---
I always thought sandbagging meant trying to get a teammate killed and it was because you use the teammate as a sandbag to get hits.
---
I mean this would be cool let you test a killer before you buy it instead of wasting money on a killer that you can’t or don’t like to play
---
Vraska, is that you?
---
The same thing you'd do in a dead zone against any other killer. You have to assume she's going to swing, so 360 even if you can't see her if you don't think you can make it to safety in time. That will cause your audio to rapidly cycle from left to right in her headphones if you're close. You can muddle your tracks that way too. Try to avoid grass if you're out of options. Best thing you can do is limit and confuse the information she gets.
---
Yeah sure you don’t, just like every other gay survivor
---
Imagine if in Halo 2 you could choose to "use an add on" to spawn with an ovrshield and a rocket launcher in an online ranked 1 v 1 game.
---
There would have been fucking riots in the streets.
---
I'm Dbd you can be complete cancer using an add on and it's somehow a good design choice?
---
Iri heads? 3, 4 blink nurse? Insta saw? Some of the stupid new Freddy add ons?
---
Sort of ruins any fun if I know the game is going to be a wash unless the killer is brain dead or my teammates are all really good.
---
Then ignore it, if on PC close the chat, if on console turn off public messages
---
I actually tried running corrupt intervention on hag instead of ruin and I did well
---
Both, like in Overwatch
---
Class Photo is good for a number of reasons. For one it's basically a global "get the fuck off my gens" button for 3 seconds. But more importantly Survivors will often become less scared of the gens spurting blood and will actually stick around for you to hit them.
---
It's not too strong but it's rather useful.
---
Spirit and The Plague.
---
You wanna talk about it?
---
You’re right! Sorry about that, will fix now
---
Amber rose
---
I'm betting it'll be a survivor only dlc with Billy as the survivor or it'll be one where he can be both roles. That's my guess. But im definitely leaning towards survivor only.
---
You can also just smack them in the butt
---
I feel ya
---
That hurts
---
Slow enter does make noise though to be fair.
---
Is someone a salty killer?
---
Tunneling and camping is lame, so I dont do that but slugging is a completely fair and legitimate strategy
---
Survivors don’t like killer perks that make gens take longer. Killers don’t like survivor perks that make chases last longer. 
---
I don’t think anybody complained about it before because you’d rarely see it. There’s no sense in complaining about something you’re not often bothered by.
---
I think you nailed it on the head. I wouldn’t be super pumped for a stranger things demogorogon killer. I love the show but I’m not sure how that play would be with an actual monster. 
---
I would assume it would take a while to make but you never know
---
I see you hate when people t bag so you camp which is way more toxic as it’s an automatic loss.
---
What a checkmate lol
---
I’m a survivor main/killer main dude. I play both and she’s bad. 😐
---
I'VE PLAYED FOR 3 HOURS SO FAR AND HAVEN'T COME ACROSS A FREDDY
---
That moment when your build is Iron Will, Self Care, Botany Knowledge, Solidarity. RIP.
---
OMG LITERALLY OMG
---
aren’t they going to make a secondary mode where you unlock items like lore and concept art?
---
Was it a nerf or Is it bugged?
---
I started taking Iron Will after playing a bunch of killer. Downing injured targets is way easier on longer loops, because you can tell which way they are trying to juke from the sound.
---
Bruh that was the worst rng I’ve ever seen
---
My exact face lol
---
Save the best for last is incredibly good, especially on clown.
---
...how is that karma? Is doing generators a bad thing?
---
No matter what you do on both sides killer or survivor someone will always hate. Just play the perks you want to play and have fun.
---
As long as you never play a game with the attitude "I'm playing to make others mad." Or "I'm going to ruin the game for others." Etc. 
---
If that's the case then you need help.
---
The “Remember Me” translation seems pretty fitting, given that Freddy is a pedo talking to his former victim whom he is currently trying to mind fuck.
---
Question completely unrelated to your post:  How easy/difficult is it for you to understand Afrikaans?  I seem to get a lot of different answers from a lot of different Dutch people, yet most say they can READ Afrikaans pretty easily (one described it as “Dutch but with a lot of spelling errors) so maybe it’s just a pronunciation thing?
---
I’d never GG a NOED skiller no matter how good that game you was, gtfo with that shit
---
Got my Bill to level 30 woth the BP i saved up for him and didn't even get tier one deliverance after i just got it from the shrine.
---
Visions of Jane Romero
---
Same situation here
---
It amazes me how behavior doesn't cash in on the meme potential of their survivors/killers.
---
Shirtless Meyers alone will fund them for the next 20 years.
---
at base, yes it seems to be.
---
Small correction on my part, there were some qol improvements that were added after the ptb. Specifically the snares are much faster to place, and will hold onto the last good position if you aim them somewhere invalid, making them easier to drop. Also they can go on slopes now, I don't know if that's new.
---
It def not top tier against better players since they'll almost always be on one gen each regardless since its way faster overall. Only time it would be useful is at the very start when they all spawn together or the very end if youre holding a 3 gen and not getting looped to hell. Also absolutely useless against a SWF once they figure it out
---
I wouldn't be putting freddy on that list just yet but ya pretty much nurse, spirit and billy boi are viable killers who can win against rank 1 swf which is the optimal gameplay... everyone else just cant and some like trapper, wraith, and ghostface are SO garbage that their m1 killers with no power to speak of because it's useless if survivors have eyes, ears, or brains.
---
Big sad
---
Honestly same
---
Every time I hear a random pallet being thrown across the map, I assume someone's trying to bait me. Accidental mind games!
---
How so?
---
Deliverance can be an absolute godsend during endgame, especially as solo survivor. Run it with d-strike and unhook yourself and you're untouchable.
---
All I’m getting is thanataphobia legions
---
Oh I know that, I just found it curious that several different people over multiple games use the exact phrase "Pop goes the braincell" and  was wondering where this sentiment came from.
---
Exactly. And let's be honest judge face would be scary in a different way
---
Except Legion. As far as I’m concerned, Legion doesn’t exist.
---
Say it louder.
---
THATS WHY NO ONE USES THAT TRASH
---
Literally had a Jake drop 5 dream pallets on me today. It was amazing and as the game progressed you could tell he no longer trusted any pallets
---
No its paint brush over box
---
Dream pallets 100% seeing claudies drop a pallet and get immediately killed afterwards is the best thing since sliced bread
---
Then people like this come on Reddit and say: "LoL nEw FrEdDy StIlL sUcKs" because they wasted half time of the game camping instead of teleport around the map to apply some pressure or use some fake pallets...
---
it's long but it isn't as long as the PTB killer queue times so it's good i guess
---
Yea do we care? Iron will ia Neat and a pain for spirits to deal with but ever other killer has eyes and can see... audio is great but unless you already lost them its impact is minimal
---
IT'S STILL REAL TO ME GOD DAMN IT.
---
That was the latest exploit that was patched out yesterday.
---
Lightborn cause atleast then we know it's the games fault a flashlight save didn't work
---
The dream pallets are a common addon
---
That’s basically in his base power
---
SURVIVORS ARE THE BIGGEST PUSSIES ON THE PLANET!!! I LOVE ANNOYING THEM AND LETTING THEM NOT PLAY SO I CAMP SINCE THEY ALL SUCK!!
---
I didn't know that when I first started either. My first game was against a Doctor, and the skill checks were all over the place, and I missed them all. I also didn't realize that a sound played before each skill check cause I was so on edge the entire time.
---
That actually is pretty cool
---
Oh well get used to it, so sick of seeing pathetic survivors complain.
---
Thank you!
---
Lol yup had a game against some survivors where I got that same totem
---
its best to just look for a match and play another game while searching
---
I hear a bass boosted lego Yoda deathscream.
---
thats kinda pathetic not gonna lie
---
This is a good point I never thought of .
---
me sorry I don't english :D
---
You are pathetic, stupid survivor c**t
---
His ability to take away loops is what makes him too powerful.
---
Explain
---
Funny because you just expressed exactly my idea. Did you read it?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cgyt2x/how_to_fix_ruins/
---
I was also massively downvoted so apparently people enjoy the RNG ruins gameplay =/
---
Or prayer beads or Nurse with omega blink
---
ever played solitaire? thats a good game to pass the time imo, also probably helps if you havea  switch or ds or ps vita formore game options
---
Yeah Gens need a rework, Ruin often gets destroyed within minutes and is really annoying for survivors. But without it the gens are getting rushed.
---
I've never seen that stop anyone from touching it
---
I think he said Freddy mains implying that while everyone may be playing Freddy, only the Freddy mains have the good perks like ruin on him already
---
They’re pallets.
---
Anime pfp = no opinion

”Stupid sweaty Killer can’t play without OP perks“ every Surv with insta heal, dead hard, adrenaline and d-strike.

as someone with an anime profile pic i promise were not all toxic : (
---
I believe it was specifically the Netflix account that handles games related to Netflix IPs. But you never know! A DBD movie would be super cool. Especially if it included the licensed characters.
---
Dead by Daylight is the only remotely popular or successful game in its genre. Of course we're all still here, they have no competition. They basically have a monopoly on this kind of game. F13 was the only thing that came close and it went to shit and died immediately. The game does suck, its a competitive multiplayer game that years into development still doesn't have dedicated servers. They have no competition, and thus they can just keep releasing DLC every three months and improve the game as slow as humanly possible, without any consequences.
---
I’m a broke ass boi can’t afford to buy a £6 pack

Excuse you?
---
Spirit is not an inept, weak, gutless C***
---
Or auric cells
---
No, old Freddy was great. I found it quite entertaining how he was constantly identified as the worst killer here when he was always in my top 3.
---
I miss old Freddy. Would like to have the choice of what Freddy I want to use tbh.
---
But saying that doesn't mean I don't like new Freddy. New Freddy is also powerful. Those pallets? That just need a shitty brown addon to use? Ridiculously deadly.
---
People have always claimed there are campers everygame, that they are getting tunneled every single game. But yeah, it's like one game out of 10 maybe usually, unless you're very unlucky.
---
I mean the perk doesn’t do much at all since you can literally clearly see the trap every time
---
Uh-huh, looks like someone scored 121 in an IQ test and thinks they are a bit better than others.
---
Want to shut me up? Give me proof you are rank 1 as killer and I accept you're just too smart and good.
---
Isn’t the general consensus that weebs are generally 15-21 y/o-ish white boys with no social life outside of discord that have to feel the need of being in power or superior opposed to others by any means necessary over the internet like for example Racism, Mobbing, Bullying and Harassing?
---
IT DOES IVE TESTED IT NO NEED TO BE ANGRY WITH MATHIEU.
---
Can someone summarize what he said ?
---
Every time this happens, I break a survivor  made up rules and tunnel them. I mean, I'm guessing they're doing it because they wanted my full attention and of course I'm giving them what they want. Always great when they DC right after getting downed a second time.
---
Trust me, getting hit over vaults has not been fixed.
---
I love when I play Doc and survivors setup a 3 gen situation then blame you for stalling the game lmao
---
With the amount of time spent waiting for lobbies, you’re actually better off playing Survivor as you can get two games in the time it takes you to join and complete a single game as killer.
---
Are you serious? Do you think that's on them? Michael Myers and Laurie are not behaviour's
---
Didn't think that counted as tunneling though I guess it still falls under going after one person for too long even if it isn't an explicit chase. I felt like I went enough of a distance to give ample opportunity for a safe hook most of the time -- I'll usually respond to a rescue by going for that same hooked survivor knowing their injured state and being closer to sacrifice.
---
I'm still trying to figure out pressure so I've yet to really discover the value of just getting someone injured for myself; I definitely do aim for getting at least one survivor out of the game to slow things down as soon as possible by going for rehooks as a result of not recognizing that. On top of that, the generator count pressures me a lot more than it should be and I'm usually left thinking 1 or 2 generators remaining equates to an essentially lost game (though it doesn't at all mean giving up).
---
Thanks for the tips and knowledge! I'll try prioritizing new chases more and see how that changes my play.
---
*screams at bhvr studios*
---
JUST TO BE CLEAR, IT REVEALS BOTH SNARES AND PALLETS?
---
Shut up no one wants you on this thread or this sub
---
They never ran out of sprint burst.  I have vid of them running around for 30 seconds straight like the flash.
---
I keep getting this Badham map and it seems to have 30+ pallets.
---
I don't know what you guys are talking about but I can't get a good win on it on red ranks.
---
Left Behind
---
The use is so niche it might as well not exist
---
Ngl people don’t complain about half of them
---
AS FAR AS I KNOW. I RUN SMALL GAME ALL THE TIME AND IT TRIGGERS IN FRONT OF PALLETS CONSTANTLY. HARD TO BE SURE IF ITS THE SNARES TRIGGERING IT SOMETIMES BUT IM ALL BUT CERTAIN THATS THE CASE.
---
I didn't see someone complaining about Pig like ever, and yet she still was nerfed 2 times.
---
Most of the are probably between 16 and 18. But good god they need to calm the fuck down.
---
I think it’s basically entirely Meg’s fault for rush-rescuing when LF was literally right up against her ass.
---
Ah, I didn't know. My first guess what that a movie was more likely due to Stranger Things' high popularity. I figured getting the rights to that would be too expensive. I also figured a pure Stranger Things game would happen at some point. 
---
I'd love a movie too, but I'm not sure they will feature licensed characters. I think a movie with the Trapper would be the most likely. Since he's the cover character. Nathan Jones would be a perfect Trapper IMO.
---
Funny how you are still around and trying to impress me! Keep on trying boy!
---
I think that's probably the case. I stopped playing the game months ago and I still check the subreddit. Mostly because this is the only game of its kind that's not dead. The devs have zero competition, so they just release DLC's and let issues go unresolved for months or years on end. Does the game even have dedicated servers yet?
---
At least billy is loopable. Freddy can literally just throw snares down and you can no longer use your 1 means of surviving.
---
Don't mind me just gonna hop in this locker for 60 seconds
---
i don.t think you lose the offering and the rank if the killer disconnects...i might be wrong tho.
---
Because now the game is the same for all players, if you can tamper with the music it'll take away the skill aspect for just hearing only the SFX not the ambient music.
---
I prefer snare because I know I will be able to set it off at least once a game but with the pallet nobody seems to use them at rank 8. I do agree that if you do have a setup it is stronger, but it wont always get someone.
---
That happened to me yesterday
---
She ended up insidious camping the basement and got a 3k
---
It wasn't even a meme build she was actually insidious camping with hag.... rank reset yall
---
I've been using tru3's build and it's been nice. Ruin, Brutal, Pop, BBQ.
---
-I became a freddy main for a challenge. 
---
-Now I’m high purple/red ranks and I’m 4k’ing everybody. (This is not important)
---
-Snares are better than pallets
---
-Map pressure is good (duh) 
---
-Springwood reworks are “good
---
-Nailed the freddy rework, excited for the future. 
---
So everything we already knew, minus the “good” map rework.
---
🦔
---
"Sir, are you aware you were speeding?"
---
One of the best perks for survivor (lithe) and the best perk for m1 killers besides for Ruin (Save The Best for Last). Nice
---
So? They earned it, they did the objective. Noed on the other hand is the exact opposite, you failed to keep the pressure, you should be punished for it, not given a perk that allows you to instadown (which directly counters adrenaline)
---
Bc it's designed to counter a scenario where safe saves don't exist without hook bombing
---
She Sports, she also Sporks!
---
His teabagging after I dropped him tells me he did lol
---
TLDR: Old Freddy was fun to play but was shit. New Freddy is still fun to play and is good now.
---
&gt; My point there was that generally I catch a ton of shit for running Ruin so I just assumed if i switched to something else there would be less salt
---
Won't happen. Those types of survivors will always find something to complain about. Try running Dying Light alongside the other perks with black box and jump rope. Obsession DC's, blame him.
---
I am not impressed because you havent shown anything yet that would make me. Go on....
---
That definitely seems op, a lot of people gave me advice for using her traps so definitely gonna try her sometime soon again! :D
---
Im sorry that most/all of the ones you’ve come across are toxic. I swear not every single one is toxic trash. I like to consider myself a pretty chill dude who just happens to enjoy animation more than live actors. I’m just a kid at heart who grew up watching cartoons and still enjoys the medium.
---
* Screenshot highlighting 4x emblems.
---
Well said. New Freddy is actually viable, and is fun to play and play against.
---
The Twitter thread was dedicated to video games for Netflix' franchises, so it seems less likely. But as I said, nothing is confirmed so far.
---
No ur supposed to down them. But if your thought process is to go straight to the unhooked guy to down him after he gets off the hook, then ur thought process is exactly what decisive strike and borrowed time is designed to stop.
---
He was doing okay as killer, but super distracted by chat. Doesn’t look easy.
---
Huge dick, lmao.
---
Also, it's a good thing I'm good in an emergency.
---
Cus when he’s cloaked I can’t see him 
---
r/IHadAStroke
---
I really think I kinda like it
---
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I must regrettably inform you that your opinion is, indeed, wrong
---
Wow you are a sore loser if you can’t handle someone using 1 perk which is counterable btw so if you get so butt hurt about it why not do something about it?
---
Sounds reasonable I dont know what i was thinking?
---
I'VE BEEN STUCK ON THIS FUCKING ESCAPE WITH DWIGHT DAILY FOR OVER 3 FUCKING DAYS. BEEN PLAYING ALL DAY AND HAVEN'T ESCAPED ONCE! CLASSIC "TOYBASHER EFFECT" IN ACTION WHERE I ALWAYS SPAWN WEDGED IN THE KILLERS BUTTCHEEKS OR OTHERWISE GET FOUND FIRST, AND I CAN'T LOOP FOR SHIT AND I'M ALMOST ALWAYS 3-HOOKED BEFORE A SINGLE GEN IS DONE. TO ME SURVIVAL OFFERINGS JUST MEAN EXTRA STRUGGLE BP.
---
I'M AFRAID TO DELETE THE DAILY BECAUSE I MIGHT GET SOME OTHER BULLSHIT LIKE MORI SOMEONE WITH NURSE ETC. AND THAT SHIT AIN'T HAPPENIN'.
---
I WENT FROM RANK 9 TO 15 IN ONE GIANT LOSING STREAK AND STILL AM GETTING MY SHIT KICKED IN. I JUST WANT TO ESCAPE ONCE!
---
it's kind of the same with Survivor perks as well. I have been using Nea and I started out with balanced landing 1 and it's never showed up on the blood web once. I have most of her perks to rank 3 but balanced landing. I have gone through probably at least 1 million points on Nea and I have never seen it one time.  I get decisive strike like every other time but I never use that so it's useless to me but perks I use never show up on the blood web.
---
I feel I always find survivor matches in under 3 seconds no matter the event
---
Does windows of opportunity also reveal if a pallet is fake?
---
I get what he means
---
The pallet at the shack is a fantastic pallet but if it isn’t there and a dream pallet from Freddy is there instead, it’s a false prophet/lie
---
This video is amazing.
---
I would Claire Redfield in this game!
---
That’s good, every non toxic player saves this community and keeps Dbd fun for me.
---
Once you get to high ranks, it's not easy to dodge saws anymore.
---
Just close your eyes
---
I would've loved it if there was another trap on that side of the rock
---
but the demagorgon wasn't formerly human
---
I kinda feel like Devs would pounce on the chance to have Hopkins as a stranger things survivor just because they really love ambiguous endings for characters where you're like well, they're probably dead, but also maybe not.
---
Well, looks like the prodigy I was promised is just a liar, trying to act tough.
---
you can't shitpost without having a stroke &lt;3
---
Which ones are useless? I’ve seen Shrine builds which are extremely strong, Iron Grasp is decent, Discordance is great, and Ruin is obviously good.
---
Edit: Just realized i said Territorial instead of Ruin, i messed up.
---
Too bad overcharge skillchecks are a joke
---
Get John Carpenter on the phone, I’ve got an idea for a movie
---
Ur post history is very interesting lmao
---
Tires you mean? Please tell me you understand
---
Honestly, he’s still not that great. Better, but not great. Went up against him like 15 times yesterday at Purple rank and beat him every time.
---
The joke
---
Honestly I think dream pallets are cool, but god I wish they worked more like Doctor where you knew they were fake as soon as they got there.
---
That or buff doctor to have the same he desperately needs it.
---
Yes. We know.
---
Ruin. Don't get me wrong i don't think it is overpowered or anything. It id unhealthy for the game since it applies pressure without the killer needing to do anything. I'm saying that this is bad because currently most killers don't know how to deal with generators being repaired and most of them use ruin too. I just want people to learn that even the strongest swfs are beatable without ruin
---
SAYING "GG" AND/OR DROPPING THE LAST SURVIVOR AT THE HATCH DOES NOT ABSOLVE YOU OF YOUR TOXIC BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL. YOU'RE STILL AN ASSHOLE
---
Bad Manners
---
It means they act disrespectful
---
NOED baby killer spotted
---
Wait 60 seconds, survivor falls to sleep, profit.
---
I’m fairly new and I haven’t seen spine chill in the blood wed once :/ also what is is DS?
---
Noed, agitation, play with your food. *Speedy boi Mikey incoming*
---
It is known. And it sucks. It’s a guaranteed NOED for the killer
---
Pop Goes The Weasel
---
Ha very funny lmao
---
Scoops ahoy is an awesome perk idea
---
And as such being the case, I still stand by my point that it should remain difficult because when you do achieve it, it's an achievement.
---
Ah okay, thanks for correcting me
---
You don’t even need to play the killer to rank them up.
---
Sandbagging in other settings simply means playing below your ability so you get easier matches. In DbD it essentially means screwing with your teammate's chances of surviving
---
Difficult, yes, but many of them are annoying or just unfun to do. There's a difference
---
Of flesh and mud?
---
That's what I'd like, 3 generators in the real world, 4 in the upside down (the "hard" gen is always upside down, like myers house, bathroom, etc). Killer can either switch planes at will leaving a gate behind (and 2 spawn at map start, so there's access), or goes through a few set gates that spawn like jigsaw boxes/purification wells, or just any locker?
---
Maybe could do something cool like RNG spawns are reversed, so the closed shack window is open and vice versa, and maybe some pallets only spawn in upside down (could cause a lot of problems for memory tho, so IDK).
---
I mean survivors do it too
---
You should watch the DbD parodies by Samination on YouTube. Extremely funny
---
That is good to know. Thanks for the testing! I have one other thing I've been curiousnabout regarding New Freddy. Do perks that work with terror radius also affect his lullaby? For example would monitor and abuse change how far his song could be heard by a sleeping survivor, or would a sleeping survivor scream from infectious fright if they were in his song?
---
When you put siege and dbd together 🤑🤩
---
That's true for that particular situation, that hadn't been revealed when I was using it as an example. But regardless of that fact, the situation he is describing does exist, and I think it's only fair to award survivors extra points for looping the killer for the entire game.
---
It just doesn't make sense to punish the survivor, maybe the killer yes, but not the survivor.
---
Are u joking,
---
I like box because it makes it so survivors always have a slightly reduced action speed
---
You’re a moron NOED literally negates all these perks, it’s not comparable. NOED rewards shit killers for play. If all the gens have been complete, you have lost yet you have a chance to make a comeback BECAUSE you have lost. That makes no sense. Insta heal is an addon for one, if it was a perk then it would be OP. Dead Hard is easily baited. DS is made to counter tunneled and adrenaline REWARDS you for getting the exit gates open. But all that can be negated because a shit killer uses NOED, one who’s tunneled all game and played poorly with no rotations and is rewarded for failing his main objective.
---
I personally love the snares, and his teleport with Barbecue and Chili is fantastic
---
I always get a merciless when I’m running no perks or something else, but as soon as I change to their teachable perks, it’s always a ruthless :/
---
I ended up getting the pig and ghost face and I’m pretty happy so far lol
---
I'm surprised I forgot slugging
---
David is  a character you get when you buy the game so he's a free character.
---
Killer mains who want their crutches man
---
Probably the default skin for Ghostface and the black leather skin for the pig.
---
I already told you : youre trash
---
Urban evasion for survivors. I swear any teammate that runs it likes to be immersed all game and not do shit. This way immersed survivors would either have to walk to not leave scratch marks but more easy to spot or run and risk the scratches but actually go to objectives. The amount of times I’ve been hooked and got into struggle because someone urban evaded to me from across the map is too damn high.
---
For the killer it would be Hex the third seal. Why? I love bond and not having it throws me off completely.
---
The main problem with her traps is the RNG on the removal boxes. Each box has a 50% chance of being the one that takes it off, so it’s incredibly easy to take them off. If they fixed the RNG numbers, it’d make her traps a lot more useful.
---
Yup, leapt straight out of it. Why were you so salty that you made this thread? Are you just angry because you die a lot or are maybe you're a bad killer but keep telling yourself otherwise?

Except the Adept killer achievements didn't used to be difficult at all to unlock.  Getting a 4k on a killer with only their 3 perks could be incredibly simple back in the day.
---
This post seems like a weird shade of gatekeeping, where people who come later have to jump through much shittier hoops than pre-Emblem system people. There's no pride in those achievements, and BHVR should look at tweaking them to accomadate the current game environment.
---
It's faster for me to get 1 million bp than 2000 shards
---
If someone is "BM-ing", they're being disrespectful. In the case of DbD, it typically means they're waiting for the killer to show up instead of leaving so they can tbag.
---
Then why does every red rank survivor run DH instead of BL
---
Bill, no contest.
---
Controversial means a subject of controversy. The dictionary can denote things as vulgar or offensive, or in this case, controversial. However, you're not wrong.
---
Pretty sure it stands for bad mouth but it definitely means to talk excessive smack/teabag a lot etc.
---
"They hated him for he spoke the truth"
---
how about you shut the fuck up, and stop being such a bitch :D
---
HALF OF YOU WOULD WATCH IT AND ONE OF YOU HAS MADE IT
---
Oh I have decisive strike
---
According to the road map, they should be enabled with the upcoming chapter. They will first enable them for a small portion of the playerbase on PC and then gradually for everyone else and then on other platforms in order to ensure smooth transition. This is what the devs said in the official forum.
---
If the killer is not experienced then they probably don't understand they benefit more from spacing out the game. Although you may just have been unlucky having going against some salty killers cause they had terrible games prior to yours.
---
I WANNA SAY TY TO ALL THE COOL FUN KILLERS WHO MADE THE GAME GREAT LAST NIGHT, ESPECIALLY ALL THE FREDDYS ON PS4! 
---
BUT AROUND 10:30PM EST &amp; ON 
---
I WANNA SAY FUCK YOU TO ALL THE CAMPING, TUNNELING, PIECES OF SHIT WHO DECIDED TO COME OUT THE WOOD WORK LIKE COCK ROACHES! THE GAME WAS GREAT TILL YOU COCK STAINS CAME OUT AND DECIDED TO BE A BUNCH OF LAZY FUCKS AND TUNNEL ME AND THE OTHER RANDOMS INTO THE GROUND! 
---
ALSO FUCK YOU TO THAT FREDDY WHO USED ALL THE OP ADD ONS AND PERKS TO TUNNEL ME INTO THE GROUND FOR NO REASON LAST NIGHT!!! 
---
WHEN YOU GOT STEAM ROLLED BY THE OTHER 3 SOLO RANDOMS, WHO MADE YOU LOOK LIKE A BITCH AT THE EXIT GATE AFTER I DIED AND YOU LOST YOUR ADD ONS FOR 1 PERSON WHEN YOU COULD HAVE HAD MORE BUT YOU JUST COULDN’T LEAVE ME ALONE YOU GREEDY FUCK! 
---
THERE IS NO STRATEGY TO TUNNELING OR CAMPING UNLESS THE GATES ARE OPEN, BEFORE THAT YOU ARE JUST A LAZY LOSER WHO RUINS THE GAME FOR OTHERS!!!
---
The build that I've been using is BBQ, Ruin, Pop, and Enduring along with the Red Paint Brush and Swing Chains.
---
Don’t let them get to you just ignore all messages it’s not worth the brain power
---
I have premonition, I have to use it better
---
Funny how you constantly fail in assuming things but I guess you not only lack the exp ingame but also in life. How old are you?  
---
Anyway you  shouldn't project your character onto others. Free coaching here ;)
---
The solution isn't to change the bloodweb, but to change the economy. Either reduce prices in the bloodweb or increase how many points a player gets in game. 
---
A survivor who sweats their ass off gets 20k BP.
---
A killer who sweats their ass off gets 30k BP. 
---
If everything in the bloodweb is priced at 4000 BP, the survivor gets 5 things from their web. The killer gets 7 things and has 2000 BP left over.
---
This is done without BP offerings, WGLF, BBQnC, or BP events. Players trying their absolute hardest get enough points for 6 things on average. With double BP, that becomes 12 things. Even with the web taking some things off, it is reasonable to assume that a player has to take 24 nodes off the web.
---
With 2x BP, it would take 2 games of absolute grinding to finish 1 web. Out of 50. Out of 3 prestiges. Per character. And that doesn't even take into account getting every perk on every character.
---
If you're new to the game, prestige ONE killer you like and ONE survivor you like to P3. Just because it's your main or whatever. But until bloodwebs get easier to grind, don't bother with prestiging every character.
---
If teabag is toxic, than so is closing the hatch in someone's face
---
No not an asshole at all  but you should have just not bothered replying my dude, that's what these folk feed off of. Best thing I did was turning messaging off when I play this.
---
Like, if you don't wanna play against good killers. Don't play purple ranks. I got rank one using pig, like, I'm a good player. Don't cry about it.
---
How was Pig nerfed?
---
That makes em even more mad lol. I keep em in because the few people that send gg's and stuff like that after games.
---
Hi! This is me. I carried the majority of the game and you got salty about me constantly evading you. I was trying to heal and my teammate led you right to me. A teammate who, you admittedly know, was not that good. Then you dropped me and attempted to close hatch in my face. I’d say that warrants a message. Maybe messaging you in frustration in the heat of the moment wasn’t the best idea, but there was no reason for you to try and be an ass and shut hatch in my face when I was not toxic that whole game. Did not tea bag, did not point, I did not do anything to warrant you doing that. You literally tried to be an ass to me for no reason. It wasn’t to get more points either. You did it to be toxic and I called you out on it. And it’s not the problem of you “looking at me”, it was the issue of you
---
blatantly letting the Dwight lead you to me and then turning on him. We weren’t SWF btw. And I messaged the Dwight too. You also blatantly face camped all the survivors you hooked. Gg.
---
I was gonna bring him to it
---
Someone did an Oopsi
---
It’s weird to me because I’ve only gone against one Freddy yesterday lol. It’s probably because I’m at lower ranks.
---
They used to be much easier, sure, but I dislike how some games (like Payday 2 for example) have achievements that aren't really achievements, like finishing a tutorial mission, for example. 
---
Like, Dead Rising did they in a way I like where you have to put in extra effort to pull off something you most likely wouldn't do any other time, or something otherwise very difficult to complete, like a very special challenge. 
---
Right now, Adept Killers are that very special challenge and I think they should stay that way
---
Ex fucking scuse me
---
GETTING TUNNELED IN EVERY GAME I GET IN
---
When did I camp
---
*laughs as equip Small Game* Easiest 1,5k BP ever
---
IM HAPPY ABOUT HAVING BILL ON XBOX, BUT NOW I HAVE TO GET HIS TEACHABLES TO GET HIS BORROWED TIME AND UNBREAKABLE ON MY FENG. ALSO IT TAKES LITERAL WEEKS TO GET ENOUGH SHARDS FOR COSMETICS
---
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE LOGIC BEHIND NERFING PIG AGAIN WTF BHVR EXPLAIN YOURSELF MANDY IS OVER IN THE CORNER CRYING BECAUSE YOU KEEP FUCKING HER IN THE FACE WITH YOUR BULLSHIT LITERALLY ONE OF THE WEAKER KILLERS GOT NERFED AGAIN WHILE NURSE IS OVER THERE BEING UNTOUCHED FOR HOW LONG ALREADY FUCK YOUR ANSWERS IT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION HONESTLY SOMEONE ON THE DEV TEAM IS GETTING DEMOLISHED BY PIGGYS AT RANK LIKE 19 THATS THE ONLY EXPLANATION I SEE FOR THIS BUFFOONERY RIGGORY AND STRAIGHT UP TOMFOOLERY MY FLAIR GOES STRONGER WITH EACH FUCKING PATCH SMDH MY DAMN HEAD
---
I don't gg ever anyway but I certainly wouldn't gg a killer using noed.
---
SURE YOU ARE,
---
JUST LET IT OUT
---
SINCE ITS RAGE WEDNESDAY 
---
YOU KNOW
---
YOU
---
HAD
---
THAT 
---
TOXIC 
---
PLAYER 
---
BETWEEN NOW AND LAST WEDNESDAY
---
&gt; You also blatantly face camped all the survivors you hooked
---
Exposed.
---
I always gang bang the horse gf sometimes joins in
---
MY FAVORITE IS WHEN THEY YELL AT YOU AT THE END OF THE MATCH FOR NOT BOTHERING EITH THEIR LOOPING!!!
---
And when was I showing saltiness about you escaping? Survivors do that. I didn't get salty.
---
Well , dat's a THICC ASS after all ....
---
Same, I'm going to fucking snap if I see another Myers or Huntress.
---
SMALL GAME DOES WORK FOR THE DREAM SMARES BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ASLEEP!
---
This is why I hate salt posts. Only getting one side of the story ☕
---
At that point you only need to change the text a little "When the survivor thought it was Ruin, but its really Haunted Ground."   
---
Honestly think it would work a little better, this guy looks like he's running to something, not running away from something.
---
I'm sure the thrill of the hunt for totems disappeared pretty quickly
---
Very nice play
---
I think Freddy now has the best slowdown in the entire game, with paintbrush + chains, ruin, pop, bbq, and discordance/surveillance, you will not do the gens.
---
I think most people would say “chase ending” or “escaping” perk
---
How can someone fail assuming?
---
So we got a 20 year old who has a 122 IQ and gives "coaching" without even knowing what it is.
---
If I were to project my character on you and you would take in even a tiny amount from it, you would see massive improvements in yourself, so no, I am not projecting on to you.
---
Why don't they just give the option of trying this for everyone? Looks interesting. Tbh this game has had a single game mode for so long, pretty much anything would spice it up
---
Ok, fair, but using dead hard is boring as all hell after you’ve used it for over 1,000 hours 😂
---
Maybe they are testing dedicated servers.. just a hopeful thought
---
Huh, on PC she definitely is.
---
I miss the exploit already :S
---
Run corrupt intervention and ruin on my trapper builds cause it takes so long to set up his stuff. Been working a lot better than expected so far, really slows the game down.
---
Sounds fun ig
---
HMMM seems what a toxic player would say
---
Being downed in one shot regardless of circumstance doesn't really sound like a counter. You were going to go down anyway, now you just also go down in one shot in any situation.
---
I'M A NEW SURVIVOR AND DAMN LEARNING TO CHASE AGAINST FREDDY IS BRUTAL. I CAN'T REALLY SAY ANYHTING ABOUT HIS GENUINE POWER LEVEL IN THE META, BUT HE HAS A HUGE TENDENCY TO JUST "NOTHING PERSONNEL KID" MY ASS WHENEVER I START HEARING THE TERROR RADIUS. HE ISN'T EVEN RUNNING PALLETS OR SNARES THAT MUCH AND HE'S STILL GARDENING MY ASS WITH HIS RAKE.
---
Do you think you would have a good chance of actually winning? I think even an average red rank killer will beat a green rank SWF even perkless.
---
Sprint Burst was bugged for 27 days, hopefully DH stays bugged for that long. All's fair.
---
Holy shit, what if (BIG BOY SPOILERS BELOW)
---
it becomes cannon in stranger things that hopper didn’t die, but went into the upside down, and that’s how he got grabbed by the entity
---
Huh, why did it fall over? Was someone on it when that happened? Was someone hurt? What kind of a bicycle was it? Tell me the story of the bicycle, if you actually know what a story is? 
---
I'll have you know that my age is at least higher than all my fingers counted together.
---
But yeah, could you just prove that you are indeed rank 1 killer or just admit that your post is bullshit?
---
Lol same here. He's  so OP.
---
That was the first day I ever played dead by daylight
---
SHIRTLESS MYERS FEELS YOUR PAIN, I GET SENT TO THE FUCKING COLDWIND FARM MAP ALMOST EVERY FUCKING MATCH!!! ALSO FUCK THE SWAMP I WISH THEY WOULD DELETE THAT MAP!
---
survivor main big brain
---
Removed - Oversaturated Content
---
True, Head On definitely seems more fun and trickier to pull off. I’d like to try it once i unlock it
---
Is this porn?
---
THROW ON OoO AND GO HAVE SOME FUN WITH THE NEW FREDDYS! I DID FOR A FEW LAST NIGHT
---
And how many killers would willingly queue for that though? Swf is a necessary evil. 
---
Imo the first step they should take is to make it so at the end of the match, the game tells you who is in swf because then people can start getting information on how many of their games are actually swf and not just a group of good survt
---
Reading this conversation was like watching two kids fight in the back of the short bus.
---
being hooked 1 time should still be pretty far from dying. its still gonna take another 2 downs and 2 hooks to put you out of the game, as long as you get unhooked before struggle state which you will 90% of the time. try to get better at winning chases, and breaking line of sight / hiding before chases can even begin. as long as you get your shit done and contribute enough, you’ll get your pips and BP, escaping OR dying. play less ballsy if you arent a great looper, but please dont become a completely timid player crouching around the perimeter and sitting in lockers, they are useless burdens no one wants on their team. if you make a decision to gen, unhook, cleanse, go do it quickly and with confidence.
---
maybe play some killer too, to understand some things like their limited vision and map pressure. some survivors act like they are scared to have a presence of the map, but killers are under extreme time constraint and can only do 1 thing at a time. if every survivor is making sound cues it doesn’t really punish them that badly, the killer can only respond to 1.
---
Definitely, we were both stupid but ig thats how it is sometimes
---
&gt;I'm so sick of this community.
---
Bye Felicia
---
Why Billy though? He's such a minor character. I'm pretty sure it'd be Hop
---
Since this is BHVR, I can absolutely believe they didn't fix this even though the community found this bug weeks ago.
---
Well done, BHVR. Never change.
---
Ew forehead meg
---
My idea for the killer is it’s a pack of demo dogs. You play as the mind flayer, who cannot actually damage survivors. He can place portals to the upside down (think how they can come out of the walls) and those portals are where you can leave or enter the upside down. You can station 4 dogs anywhere on the map, but only in the upside down. Using your power let’s you take control of any of them, and there’s no range limit. Maybe the dogs can bark when someone comes near them so you know who go transfer to
---
Use modmail.
---
Bruh you are tripping if you actually think that Billy needs a cool down
---
It could be made so that for each swf member the killer gets a bp multiplier up to 4x that would entice some to play aganst them or have a reward system so that if the killer does well or fulfills certain criteria they are givin rare offerings and add ons for the killer of their choice.
---
Then again this might get abused
---
Thanks, I’ll definitely try that!
---
he can trap window to
---
Do you not know what /s means
---
I would say I play killer more than survivor, especially recently but still play a good amount of survivor
---
I feel this my first time trying to get doc adept I decided to mori last guy to reward myself but nooo I needed a hook to get the adept
---
That's the joke.
---
Fair enough lol
---
But it needs to have a good title. Something iconic yet simple. Maybe relating to a holiday dedicated to horror...
---
Difference is as killer you get points for dc.
---
Haha
---
Oh so you were serious. Hm. I think thats def something with your internet then. If I would have to guess at least.
---
As Freddy you can instantly place snares mid chase unlike Trapper, and they slow you down for a free M1, so basically an injure, if you know what you’re doing
---
Call William Shatner and see if he’s busy. If he is, find someone that looks like him I don’t care if he’s wearing a damn mask, we gotta get this made!
---
If you play in low ranks, yeah, same as literally hits as you do the same, chainsaw has just a little smaller autoaim and thats it, in higher ranks, you cant do shit pretty much. I am billy main so i know, if i have a bad day then prob i will miss those 2 close saws but then there is no escape and i am warmed up enough
---
*breaks haunted grounds and hears vacuuming*
---
Do what I do, write names down (a hit list per say) and Mori there booties next match 😘
---
Honestly didn’t even think of Head On, lol because it sucks. I was mostly picturing the ones you use while being chase by the killer (SB, BL, DH, and Lithe)
---
A DDoS attack would be hitting your router first and would probably take your network down before shutting your computer down. In fact if it was an attack and they shut your computer down you probably have bigger problems.
---
I'M NEW BUT IN 2 DAYS OF PLAYING I'M ALREADY SICK OF PEOPLE TAKING ME OFF THE FUCKING HOOK WHILE THE KILLER IS FACE TO FACE WITH MY DICK!!! LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
AS A NEWER PLAYER, WHAT WAS THE NERF TO HER AND WHEN WAS IT??
---
*dies in the first hook as see the whole team be sluged* worth the 1.5k
---
Hm. I don't know. I also kinda think that he somehow got sucked into the upside down. You couldn't see his body standing on the platform anymore when it exploded so yeah. Plus the Russians talking about "The American" in one of their cells is a pretty big flashy sign saying "THIS IS HOP".
---
On the other hand: it was a perfect sendoff and tied everything up nicely. We'll see I guess. Can't wait for next season.
---
it's not that deep, my dude. it's a silly joke post.
---
Hahah.... no.
---
As a surv main, Ruin is not that strong lol, but greats. Now NOED is the real problem
---
*goes to Next Game against a pro nurse*
---
itd have to be up to 3 extra perks, since you cant really count one person as a swf
---
That’s strange, yeah I checked my router after the attack and it was still up, you got any idea on how I could stop it?
---
I want It, gimme
---
Monstrous Shrine is probably the worst perk in the game honestly
---
Score?! What do you mean we need to have an iconic score?! Just give Carpenter a piano and tell him to mess around with the keys for a few days!
---
I tunnel vision immediately and don't stop until they DC or I kill them lol
---
Yeah I think the American is elevens dad cus he is apparently still alive. And the Russians all the sudden have all this info on opening a portal. And hop is hanging out in the upside down
---
It does still give you the temporary invincibility tho so it's not completely useless
---
Sick, man.
---
Yeah but typically not sb
---
we know
---
I read this in Bob Ross’ voice and I regret nothing
---
That does absolutely jack shit, tbh. Maybe a different game mode would have to be tweaked so killers would actually queue into it, but merely telling the killer who's SWF and who's not at the end of the match is like putting a band-aid on a freshly severed limb.
---
Rank 3 at the moment
---
The bp survivor economy is at its peak whenever this happens
---
Noed has no power over us!
---
Yeah, on the behalf of all the weebs, I'm sorry man.  I always try to not be toxic and just have a good time and always hope that other people have a good time too.  I don't camp (unless someone else is being toxic, in which case I’ll camp them), I try to do all the gens and unhook survivors when I believe I can.  Sorry, again, for any toxic weebs you meet, we’re not all like that.  A lot of us are just chill people who like Japanese animation.
---
*1st time? Meme intensifies*
---
Did they ever start banning constant dc? Last I heard they can't until they get servers settled in.
---
It was at the end of the game. I opened the exit gate and she dc’d when my friend kept blinding her.
---
Run some antivirus stuff to make sure it's not something else, and make sure your CPU is staying cool that can definitely cause a sudden shut down.
---
Again very very likely just a coincidence.
---
Awesome. The firecracker has only worked twice for me. Felt awesome but both times the killer knocked the person down right away.
---
wow
---
Actually, this can be a + as well - you use ambicja only on obsession
---
I never said that’s all they should do but I do think this should be easier to implement for them than a whole other game mode.
---
If you're not good at chases, maybe perks that alert you to where the killer is might help you avoid them altogether. Spine chill, object of obsession (although that puts a target on your back), premonition, and alert can let you know where the killer is so you can avoid them.
---
Survivor gets hurt when he dc’s and doesnt affect anyone else other than just making it even longer to get into a match. But just like I said in the post. I lost a pip, an offering and bps
---
I wanna say green ranks
---
Seal this thread up, that's the third pun we've had.
---
Don’t know why you’re getting downvoted, when this is the literal best method.
---
Because if you don’t take the unwanted ones, they just keep coming back up
---
So we back in the mines
---
I'd have to agree the mixing of tunnels and camoing
---
Yeah, I really miss some things about F13.  I liked being able to find weapons and having the chance to escape via several different methods...but I'm with you when it comes to the Jason buff.  I get that premade teams were bullying him, but it wasn't the case at all in the average game with randoms.
---
Now, he's way too powerful.
---
Looks good.
---
Yeah, but there usually due to the pips on a perk. I’m not even ENTIRELY sure what those pips mean...
---
So you enjoy it when you're casually playing a game and it's not fun?
---
You enjoy not having fun against your will?
---
Do you enjoy when someone else has fun at your expense while you casually play a game for a limited amount of time?
---
I get about 3 hours of Dbd in a week and it's pretty annoying when 25% of the games at high rank are just pure cancer.
---
But hey.... It's casual so I can't complain /s
---
The pips are the level of the perk. Each perk has 3 levels.
---
Nothing like looping the killer for 5 minutes and your team still hasn't found Ruin and is to afraid to do gens.
---
This is more true than it seems.
---
What’s the image on the right?
---
I slugged the shit out of em personally, everytime they get healed from dying state, slugged them again, rinse and repeat. Once they message me I always say "sit down and be humbled", that usually get them hot lol.
---
What show is this?
---
cool, can't wait for NOED bloodwarden sweeps
---
Perkless and sleep, I’d have everyone else dc immediately and then it becomes a race for hatch with a 60 second head start.
---
I’ve never agreed more. 
---
Fuck people who use Urban Evasion, simple as that. For you to even be past rank 10 shows the ranking system is absolute garbage, you deserve to be in rank 15 at best. 
---
Use BORROWED TIME. Many players who are the type to urban evade and self care around the map like to farm people at the wrong times, and being farmed literally loses games. Trading off hooks makes you a moron (and makes me highly unlikely to come for you if you’re hooked). BT is a mandatory perk for not being an asshole teammate. It also saves your ass when the guy takes the hit for you to both escape. 
---
Self Care should not be used. Like OP said, use Bond. You get situational awareness, what teammate is where doing what. Doing a gen you can join? Cleansing a Hex totem? Being chased by the killer? Self Care should not be used 
---
Learn when to throw pallets and not pussy out when the killer is coming. 
---
And yah to many pallets on Badham
---
Probably trying to use Head On?
---
Yeah. And of course its the most difficult to get out of it because either potato survivors. It sucks. But i dont find a lot of toxic survivors there. But killers oh yeah most definitely
---
You do?
---
Y'all are what is wrong with this community.
---
It be the ones you expect the least
---
He was. He had stall, endgame, aura reading, and top tier mindgames. If you played your cards right, you were practically guaranteed a hit the moment those 7 seconds were up, regardless of any loops nearby, except for some particularly bad ones. Getting a hit after only 7 seconds in a chase is nothing to scoff at. The only people (and I do mean the ONLY people) who called Freddy bad were the people who didn’t know about the transition mindgame. That thing alone put Freddy into mid tier. Pair it up with his stall and Freddy was easily a viable Killer at rank one. Except for SWF, but SWF is broken for all killers. 
---
But who cares about any of that? Sure, you never knew about the transition mindgame, but you heard someone on YouTube say that he was bad, and no one on YouTube is ever misinformed about what they think. Clearly, you know better.
---
Stranger Things!
---
Well, yes, but then I won't learn chases when they inevitably happen. Can't stealth all game, every game, after all.
---
Dude great timing on that!!
---
insta-buy
---
It all started with Ace
---
Slow down there Satan.
---
People are saying with the change to pigs ambush not being a basic attack, you don't lose stacks when you ambush your obsession so it's actually really good on pig
---
Legions trash tho ofc you would lol
---
Got our pickaxe swinging fron side to side side side to side
---
When’s the next chapter?
---
I agree with you completely.  Btw, the same company that made F13 is now working on a predator game if you didn't know... I'm really pumped about the possibilities.
---
Right, you can also trap your Hexes. Though of course, it's pretty easy for survivors to wake up before cleansing them.
---
Plus rank reset just helps that out
---
Trapper is... special.
---
No other killer, that I'm aware of, can hurt themselves with their own abilities.  In addition, most other abilities aren't so obvious that they can be easily avoid or ignored.
---
Yes, there's some counters to certain ones, such as flashlight vs Hag's traps or Wraith's cloak, but survivors can disarm traps without those, and dismantle traps with a perk or toolbox.
---
Bear Traps need to either be less visible to survivors, or they need to not affect Trapper.
---
That's what Im saying.  Get in chases on purpose.  
---
Make sure you pay more attention.  If the killer starts close youre already at a disadvantage.  Also pay attention to the killers bloodstain, and what direction it's moving.  Youll get the hang of it.
---
If you play it casually it’s fine, but streamers really do suffer.
---
Taken from r/gaming
---
Had to share for the lack of misunderstanding from the uncivilized crowd.
---
Yeah, fingers crossed!
---
Have debated on it, but don't really have the money to get someone like that atm.
---
The true issue here
---
Wet noodle is best noodle!
---
Visual glitch, I checked you don’t actually lose pips when the match gets canceled.
---
Maybe near rank 1 they get mad cause they want the top level idk... Maybe I was just unlucky with the matchmaking today... Anyways under this comment section I see people talking like: "camping? Last time I got camped was 2012"
---
Leather man?
---
was the spirits name "HOOK IF UR GAY" if so, I apologize. had this exact gank of survivors yesterday and was wondering why the claud wasnt doing so hot
---
It means the killer is only using their m1 (mouse 1, left click) attack and not their ability.
---
Yea they do it sucks to because the developers don't fix that much stuff
---
Her ambush now is no longer a basic attack, meaning it doesn't work with perks like NOED
---
I mean blood warden is easy to avoid don't get caught in endgame most killers don't open the door unless they either wanted points or have bloodwarden (in my experience) bloodwarden should block both gates. I just 99 the door if someone is down when final gen is popped for that reason because if you open the door after it doesn't activate because no door was open
---
Definitely been seeing these games a lot more often
---
* Myers starts sprinting *
---
John Carpenter: "Oh, shit!"
---
* Menacing pianos faster *
---
Try spine chill instead
---
Thompson House about 2 weeks ago
---
You think so I think it's worse because they're all trying to rank up and sweat at green however it could be because of rank reset
---
Trapper is weak enough without instant escapes, but i agree that was indeed a pro gamer move
---
No one escapes puns
---
WE JUST HAD LITHE AAAHHHHHHH 
---
They need to stop with the repeats, i want good perks ;(
---
Well, it makes sense.  A match needs more survivors than killers.  For every one (1) killer, there must be four (4) survivors.
---
I think trapper is weak..but when I see him in a game besides spirit he’s the only other killer who scares me 😂
---
NONE OF YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION!
---
Purged
---
I found a place near me with cheap therapy and a nearby psychologist. I just recently started getting help mentally and my life is starting to look up.
---
He couldn't find me cause if my mad hiding skulls so he just got me to die
---
Gotta risk it for the biscuit
---
It demonstrably, mathematically, factually is exactly that strong. I'm quoting the numbers from memory but this is something that you can calculate on your own or look up on this subreddit.
---
That's my thought!
---
I play Pig and i after that lil nerf I'm like, y'all better appreciate me.
---
I think addons could really help this ability..to bad devs didn’t add any addons to make them better
---
You fool, UK master race!!! *proceeds to spend extra money on something I was already paying less for*
---
You mean perk or add-ons?
---
If perks then:
---
Whispers(or BBQ) Hex: ruin, enduring , spirit fury(MaA if you like stealth, BS if you don't eat pallets.)
---
Add-ons: he has multiple playstyles but the strongest might be either infinite tier 3 or hair bow(both with J. Myers memorial).
---
I bet the killer was mad
---
TFW you realize Ruin has been on the shrine once this year and it was early this year around February
---
But who actually does that? It seems like everyone's ability is useful to some degree.. if they weren't why would people use them?
---
Sorry not trying to be a smartass I just genuinely don't understand.
---
For example i hear everyone call legion an m1 killer, but shouldn't you be using his power a lot? At least to injury healthy survivors and for map mobility? Does it just mean the killers power is not all that strong?
---
Clever
---
Probably reported her x)
---
Myers, his terror radius music and tier up sounds are really good.
---
Two survivors left slug. That's just cheap man.
---
Man, when gf was out i had him every game but with freddy...i’m not getting lucky. Not one game against him
---
But yes. I died.
---
Thank you, I appreciate it.
---
WHY AM I PLAYING AGAINST A FREDDY AND A PIG IN THE SAME GAME END ME
---
I miss f13.
---
No ur trash
---
Same with the dresses. All 3 of them all inflict the same regression penalty upon failing skill checks (Compare to Interlocking Razor's for the pig, which "Tremendously" (60% instead of 10% progress removed) reduce progression on jigsaw box searches) the only difference is how long the aura is revealed.
---
So paintbrush and chains meta?
---
Finally something we can agree on /s
---
Ah
---
I'd remove DS as killer, it's annoying seeing survivors stay on gens right in front of me and rush into a locker mid-chase because they know they have a 2nd chance.
---
I'd remove Dying light as survivor, it just encourages tunneling hard.
---
I think rank reset is bs cause new players are gonna be matched up with former red rank players and it’s honestly horrible
---
PLAYERS DISCONNECTING IN THE LOADING SCREEN CAUSING ME TO LOSE A PIP AND LOSE 
---
MY GOOD OFFERINGS.
---
I'm literally not going on DBD right now until the hype dies down, literally will only go on if I have a killer ritual or just feel like playing killer. Fuck the Freddy shit.
---
THERE IT IS. LET IT ALL OUT.
---
Ha
---
He brought me to the hatch to close it on me last second. He was just being extra shitty for some reason lol
---
I can sense salt
---
Yes but paintbrush starts everyone in dream state and forces them to run to the furthest alarm clock to wake up every time they are asleep, that alone wastes more time than even ruin would.
---
Lol so then killers will camp in lockers for excess amounts of time and then complain about genrush at the end of the game. GGs
---
Yeah hahaha
---
The most hilarious thing is when killers think playing well means we must be in a SWF
---
some guy is on death hook, we all know to rush in and body block so he can wiggle free. We all escape and the guy starts bitching about SWFs when literally everyone was solo
---
I also love that SWF = toxic, often times me and my buddies are meming and probably preform worse lmao
---
Yeah honestly. If it was a good game not saying gg because the killer used 1 perk is very petty
---
I saw a wild LockerDwight today. Spent 90% of the game doing chases, saves and objectives and spent all that time wondering where the fourth player was. He never got chased, or did objectives. When I was powering up the last gen this son of a bitch comes out of the locker right next to the exit gate. He had been there all game.
---
HE HAD ALMOST NO POINTS EXCEPT THE ESCAPE.
---
Made me laugh though.
---
Same except for bbq on my p3 legion.
---
Use Spine Chill instead. No cooldown, lights up and stays lit and is also useful in a chase, when the killer is trying to mindgame, camp, etc unlike Premonition
---
Also I found this thread with some other possible solutions: https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/9/1693785035827870691/?ctp=4
---
I agree man n then when you get matched up with potato teammates
---
The fucking plebs who play killer like Freddy now because he's able to camp like the rest of them.
---
Technically it's better to work through ruin in most cases anyways, but yeah that's dumb.
---
Level I, II, III
---
And for god’s sake don’t use Urban Evasion. The killer will still find you when you get to the higher ranks. Do not use it
---
its kinda like a doube-edged sword
---
on side wraith with speed addons can be strong
---
on the other side wraith without speed addons suck really badly
---
Yikes. But he is right about SWF though. It's unbalanced as fuck, and I say that being a survivor main
---
The snares are meh, but if you are consistently and constantly placing dream pallets when survivors are gone then the amount of times you can catch them off guard during chases is astronomical.
---
I love the "Oooooooooh" sound he does sometimes
---
Hello Space Coconut, how are you today? Let me just cleanse every totem b4 your NOED activates.
---
Slurp
---
WHY ARE SO MANY SURVIVORS TEABAGGING ME FOR NO REASON? I DON’T TUNNEL OR CAMP AND EVEN IF I DID, THE GAME JUST STARTED AND LITERALLY THE FIRST SURVIVOR I JUST FOUND STARTS TEABAGGING ME AFTER EVERY PALLET AND WINDOW. WHATS WRONG WITH THESE PPL?
---
Bait and switch is the only good thing about this and it still sucks
---
Space Coconut disagrees
---
Agreed
---
Yeah I really don't know why people in this game specifically are so triggered by tbagging, like have they never played literally any other video game before?
---
As a killer I did the same thing, except after closing the hatch I let them escape by opening the gate. Sorry :/
---
I don't say that this action was okay, it was obviously not :D
---
I just don't like the 1/20 of the killers who are nice to the survivors as it is not the job of the killer to be extra kind to the survivors ( they don't need to be extra shitty though) 
---
This killer does suck ;)
---
I'm pretty sure at least 40% of the players that do that just do it for the salt.
---
can someone actually tell me why her ear looks like a black hole
---
Hag is good enough where you don't technically need it if you know what you're doing, but few hag players are actually that good.
---
I'm not mad he did it lol. I just thought it was funny and I should share. The feeling was shitty though, being like "awe yeah, I'll escape!" to "awe....dick" just felt so much like dbd.
---
The most fun in ranks I had was purple. Green is full of terrible camping killers and survivors who run killers around the hook, and red is full of survivors who farm their points.
---
EVERYTIME I TRY TO LAUNCH THIS GAME ON PS4 IT CAUSES MY CONSOLE TO OVERHEAT AND THIS HAS BEEN A BUG FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS AND IT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED YET
---
As a current Wraith main, bodyblocking is hilarious
---
Because there's literally zero rank 20 survivors now a days. The game has to put killers with someone, and these 4 survivors were the best fit. Its not ideal, but its better than waiting an hour for a game.
---
i find your descriptive language amusing as my cat's whiskers tickling my face
---
HER AMBUSH NO LONGER COUNTS AS A BASIC ATTACK SO IT WON'T WORK WITH CERTAIN PERKS.
---
More for a laugh then farm 😂 Going to own that one, thought he was closer tbf!
---
Got bored after the 3rd gen my dude 😂
---
WHY DID THEY BREAK FOOKIN DEAD ARD?!
---
I can now support that I don't feel that it's cheating because BHVR have confirmed that it is NOT cheating. Lovely stuff.
---
The UK left the EU tho
---
*its just 100* chill
---
Trapper is easy to learn, sure but not easy to execute at higher ranks. He requires the most skill/knowledge to successfully 4K at high ranks
---
Pretty sure it was when the game was broken af and he was being interviewed about it
---
Determined to use this photo I see...
---
https://youtu.be/mbeC2w-uIEU
---
Should probably ride in it so you dont get hurt
---
Fucking hell. I'm feeling the exact same. Got to rank 2 and thought I was going to get teammates with a non autistic brain, but I was wrong. Holy fuck, these fuckers reach red ranks without even knowing how to do gens through ruin, or AT LEAST find the damn totem
---
I'm done.
---
Windows of Opportunity is a teachable from Kate that you get at level 1 if that helps? Sometimes getting better is just learning how to take losses on the chin and seeing what you’re doing wrong (dropping pallets too early, trying to window vault when the killer’s too close to you), aaand the biggest bitch of them all: grinding up the bloodweb.
---
That isn’t a joke.....
---
whoosh
---
I mean it would be pretty bad if it was ruin too lol
---
I try my best, sure beats being bum bullied by a hillbilly running at mach 10 on his way to rearrange my rectum
---
INDEED I DO lol
---
“I’m a survivor main please recommend me easy killers use starting off”
---
“Yes pick Nurse because she isn’t hard to use starting off at all”
---
When did they confirm that?
---
Honestly in red ranks you can run DS instead of Bond as it is not hard to find survivors in red ranks and DS is arguably better than Bond.
---
Also, I've already said this, but most of the pallets in Badham can be played around, being a good survivor doesn't mean you are going to be able to predict everything the killer is going to do presuming they don't just break every pallet you drop instead of forcing you to play around an unsafe pallet.
---
I honestly love playing against ghostface. He actually gives me jump scares and it’s fun to do the teabag dance with each other at the exit gates while my team escapes.
---
I never read a text in Afrikaans but understanding spoken Afrikaans is pretty do-able. There might be a couple of words I don't get but most of it is understandable for me. It sounds a lot like a Dutch dialect like the Belgian Flemmish. Though Flemmish is easier to understand than Afrikaans.
---
**NEA'S A KILLER** 😂😂[😂😂😂](/intensifies)
---
Was this in response to the absolutely idiotic idea someone had about banning people who use 3rd party software? I really hope it was. It's nice when the devs themselves put dumbasses in their place.
---
OMG I even can't tell what perks are you using because of the icons.
---
Today, less than two hours ago. I mean, we all knew it anyway, but it's nice to get an official confirmation just to stop the argument once and for all.
---
I never said that he wasn't a dick.
---
Yeah I figured it was a troll and just ended the conversation, attention is their fuel
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/che4b1/bug_sometimes_the_entity_doesnt_want_you_to_escape/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
tfw now a Kate main solely for perks, I knew maining David was stupid. Does nothing but let me down, no wonder Freddie and Pig love to throw me in the air before puckering up my butthole and dislodging my intestines
---
Yep, it was.
---
STBL and his perk that lowers terror radius in a chase is really good if you play the mindgame...game. What I mean is dont use him as a stalky myers boi use his power when someone runs into a jungle or something so you dont have to moonwalk to get a hit. 
---
His other perk that gives fast vault auras are actually really good too at tier 3 if you use the above strat. Can never go wrong with using whispers too.
---
They should definitely add this as a hairstyle variation of this outfit, it’s amazing.
---
So basically, play the game as your normally would and if a survivor is going to barely get out in time you get to block the gate. Sure, why not also make noed part of the same perk.
---
I once saw an Ace get just over 6k points from escaping once.
---
I was in shock
---
Legion and pig are shit dont get me wrong but legion can stall the game as boring and as useless as it is for him... and pig can use her crouch as a off-brand mindgame tool aswell as her traps can stall the game out is RNG is on your side.
---
Wraith has no chase tools.... he has no gen protection tools.... and he has no map awareness tools he is the meaning of a M1 killer.
---
And just because you can get 1 hit sometimes doesnt mean that they wont loop you for a good 3-5 minutes after that... gens get done against wraith and chase get won against wraith.
---
It's a arguable choice on which is worse between wraith trapper and ghostface...
---
Trapper can counter loops but they can simply be disarmed or avoided making him pure m1 32m terror radius garbage...
---
Wraith can get withing sight range of survivors and sometimes get a hit off but rare as that is he will be forced to play the looping game and lose to gen play before he can make good hook progress.
---
Ghostface like wraith has stealth instead of loop counter, however while wraiths stealth rewards him with almost nothing ghostface can expose survivors with a 10 second stalk timer.
---
Trouble with that is, ghost faces power is rendered useless when looked at... and keeping in mind survivors are humans with eyes and it's hard to sneak up on them especially when your very movement makes as much noise as a leather windstorm...
---
So with that in mind ghost face might be able to get off 1 stalk per match but hes a m1 killer with an occasionally smaller terror radius otherwise.
---
It's a hard choice between those 3 for who's the most garbage but no argument that they are the rock bottom 3.
---
Get to red ranks on PC... play wraith... run whatever perks you want try your best... you'll see what we talking bout.
---
Never said you said he wasnt.
---
You really don't need it. She is very easy to end chases with if you play her right. I switch it up and use devour, haunted, or corrupt in its place.
---
Seems a little out of this world.
---
It doesn't change the fact that the game isn't balanced around survivors communicating with each other, and neither are the perks, and that if BHVR is going to sit there and say "we know our EULA bans outside programs that give any sort of advantage, but Discord/Teamspeak/VOIP is perfectly fine!" then they need to own up to it and start reworking "information conveying" perks (Aftercare, Bond, Kindred, Small Game, etc) and Hex totems and generally balance the game around SWF-VOIP.
---
Stbfl relentless if u have it thrilling tremors the other gf perks are useless and lastly iron grasp it's basement time bitch gl
---
You have to cut out your tongue to play this game
---
While I've never thought it's cheating it definitely gives a big advantage and it is almost unfair. SWF chat makes some of the killers pretty much useless, mainly the stealth ones. For me it's on the same level as Camping. Cheating? No. Unfair? yes. Some SWF don't use comms to be unfair and just speak normally and that's fine. Basically don't complain about camping if you're gonna go full communication tryhard mode. Both are unfair and ruin the game for someone else
---
Talk about a toxic survivor
---
Should you struggle to waste more time or not?
---
Fix matchmaking instead. If the lobby looks for survivors within a certain ranking range of the killer, then increase that range when SWFs are involved. If a rank 10 killer normally gets rank 6 to 14 on average, make that rank 8 to 16 SWFs when people join as a group. Survivor with friends get stronger killers. Fucking fixed.
---
But wait you say
---
Rank is meaningless
---
Which brings me to #2.
---
**Also fix the ranking system.**
---
Thats an oxymoron
---
Yeah and against 4 legitimate rank 1 survivors it’s more often than not still not enough to slow the game down to a reasonable pace.
---
Bummer, but I would rather them focus on game health than anything else tbh.
---
Always happens to me. Always.
---
Understandable good luck on getting the perk
---
See my edit. There are people out there happy to brand it cheating and to talk down to people that think otherwise. Believe me it's important that the devs have now said that not only is it not cheating, but they don't have a problem with it.
---
There's better be fuckin dedicated servers. Fucking tired to get killed because of the killer shitty connection
---
I can't even comprehend what happened there...
---
I've been outskilled and out played...
---
I really need to get more perks, Im using too many situational ones at the moment and I'm here wondering why I'm being skullfucked by every killer
---
I’ve had it happen twice since the update, yesterday I am 99% sure it actually depipped me because I fell an entire rank, as I had just made the new rank. But today it was only visual I think.
---
You have to get up in there in order to reach it. It’s a big if there’s literally no way to get to it.
---
It's now only just occurring to me that playing one survivor is a stupid thing to do
---
Indirectly referencing the third seal, nice
---
It would of been funny if you wiggled off and had a key.
---
Because he likes legion . Check his flair my dude.
---
It embodies rank reset in its entirety.
---
At this point I'll take tuft of hair/tombstone myers over freddy 😔
---
I mean, yeah, there’s some killers out there who said it was cheating. Like that one dude who you obviously had a 51 DAY GRUDGE (Jesus, odd respect there), but like I said, it’s a minority.
---
The last like 4 patches in a row all broke some perks. Wouldn’t be surprised if it’s buggged.
---
Can we get a link to the source?
---
Thanataphobia, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and Surveillance. I use a meme icon set for everything in-game.

I’m trying to learn legion atm and idk he seems like he is pretty bad albeit he is fun to play tho
---
I think he means Blindness as in the status effect (Can't see auras) although a second or two of actual flashlight-blindness once fully stunned could be cool.
---
Yes, if it’s Ruin you can deal with it but what if it’s Devour Hope or Noed?
---
And that my friends is why I immediately walk backwards after hooking someone.
---
r/lostredditors
---
When you start off, it’s smart to switch it up. Once oh level the important ones up (Bea, Meg, and Claudette) and make their perks teachable, feel free to be whoever you like.
---
I thought that Blindness for 30 seconds is fine. I mean the effect not the flashlight blind. It wouldn’t be easy to pull off the blind, and you don’t get many opportunities. Plus all it does is make healing harder. Maybe 20 seconds? As I said I’m not amazing with the numbers for this game so I find that a bit harsh to just stop.
---
And you are what I would class as a good killer, this guy was obviously new.
---
Jokes on the killer, it was Haunted Grounds ;)
---
That's against rule #819042.
---
Same, tbh. I wasn't even going to screencap it till I saw the two red ranks. To be fair their match was lost pretty early on- they kept farming each other in the basement.
---
Monstrous Shrine has replaced probably all of my rolls for whispers and bbq
---
Underrated comment.
---
&gt;At least billy is loopable. The Clown can literally just throw bottles down and you can no longer use your 1 means of surviving.
---
No grudge, I just happen to think he's a dick 😂
---
Time to grind 😤😤😤
---
NOED doesn't pop until the end of the game and its use is situational at best.
---
The killer is probably in a good position to win anyways when NOED becomes active.
---
Teammates be like *helping noises*
---
Wait... they didn't fix it?
---
Good luck!

---
...how about no?
---
Always struggle, four generators *should* pop in the two minutes you're hanging on the hook, it takes 124.4 seconds for three survivors without toolboxes to pop four generators without Ruin (and even with Ruin if toolboxes, repair perks, or hitting greats; 80 seconds is the default time for hitting "goods" without Ruin, and Ruin removes the "great" progression bonus, so 80 seconds still).
---
That least generator can be three-manned to pop in 33\~ seconds, so if the Killer doesn't find you (or catch you) for 60\~ seconds before hooking you, then all five survivors can power the gates and get out (each survivor only has to visit 3 generators, they don't need a huge amount of travel time).
---
While throwing down too many pallets early against non-camping Killers gives them a massive advantage late game, throwing down pallets to stay up against a camper is great, you have to balance how many you're willing to throw down in case they're going to camp you, but "enough to still be running after 80 seconds of being in the match" isn't a bad metric.
---
You can subtract however long the Killer takes to find you from those 80 seconds, *and* also subtract any time you spent working on a generator, meaning if you spawn across the map then it might be more like "needing to stay up for 40 seconds" instead, you can probably screw over a potential camper with just 3-4 pallets.
---
exhaustion clown. so much fun.
---
I was a Freddy main too (I played Legion more but Freddy was my second choice). When I first saw the rework I was kind of pissed and thought it looked boring. 
---
After playing him yesterday I think he’s amazing and very fun to play.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/77403/summer-event
---
A lot of killers can hurt themselves with their on power. Hillbilly can bump into stuff making you lose time, "same" as bubba. You can miss blinks with the nurse and lose a bunch of time, spirit has cooldown and 110% speed on regular mode... In fact most of the killers get hurt by the power being misused, it's the weird ones that don't.
---
 I did mean that :). And it also had the blind flashlight stun as explained. I’ve reposted it as I think I took it down as my image wasn’t working
---

I used to play on ps4 and playing hag on there was a nightmare. Frames dropped so bad after teleporting that trying to get an immediate hit afterwards was awful. Now that I'm on PC she's so fun
---
Romance anime can be good when they aren’t harem shows.
---
I have reposted this and changed the time, but also due to image problems. Please read through and check it out again :)
---
20- in the greys- is the "worst" rank, while 1- in the reds- is the best rank. The better you performed in the game, regardless if you survived or not, provides pips that go towards making your rank climb upwards
---
shhhh
---
Okay thanks!
---
One of the reasons for the audio is literally to drown out survivor noises. If there was a mixer, what reason would anyone have to play with higher chase music? You are effectively asking for the music itself to be flat reduced, because only new, inexperienced people wouldn't use the mixer.
---
 Imagine if there was no music -&gt; the only thing you'd hear would be survivor noises, making it super easy to find someone because e.g. breathing when everything else is silent isn't exactly hard to hear. Being able to hear the noises over the music is one of the skill curves in the game
---
Rank 1 is the best. Your rank starts at 20 and the more you escape/play, your rank decreases. The lower your rank, the better your gameplay is. I think, lol
---
I want this meme pallet right now
---
I mean, it depends on the group. If you have 4 Rank 1 toxic sweats, yeah, it sucks. But if it’s a case like mine, a few mid-rank friends dicking around, not being too serious, it’s fine.
---
what is there to rage about? Tho it's a perfect game.
---
I am also having this issue. So is my friend.
---
Came here looking for “it doesn’t”
---
How so? Seems like it would fall into the category of "Trap" to me.
---
DYING ON HOOK BECAUSE TWO OF YOUR TEAMMATES ARE FUCKING HEALING FOR AN ETERNITY AND THEY ASSUME THE THIRD TEAMATE IS GOING FOR THE SAVE BUT HES DOING A GEN LIKE A GOOD BOY AND RIGHTFULLY ASSUMING THAT THE OTHER 2 PEOPLE WILL GO FOR THE SAVE. NOT TO MENTION DYING ON HOOK BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE 2 TEAMMATES REMMAINING AND THEYRE HEALING EACHOTHER INSTEAD OF GOING FOR THE SAVE.
---
That should be obvious?
---
WHY DO I 100% OF THE TIME GET HIT WAY AFTER VAULTING AS A SURVIVOR, BUT AS A KILLER I CAN NEVER HIT A SURVIVOR AT THE END OF A VAULT? AND YES, BOTH ARE THE FAST VAULTS.
---
Ya I have it happen at a decently frequent amount. I have experienced the game DCing me more though in the past few months. Not regularly but like once or twice every couple days. Maybe that has something to do with it as well
---
Are you mad because you didn’t make it that far and still at rank 20?
---
I thought he'd step in his trap three times
---
Oh Lord, YES.
---
I disagree with every "Solution" here except for the icons, and the double BP
---
I don't particularly mind SWF players, it's only when they are wearing heavy cosmetics AND carrying items that I decide to bail (such as shirtless survivors, fuck that noise) as that means that they are hardcore into the game and I want nothing to do with that.
---
This game, for better or for worse, needs more transparency, a chat option (or global voice) maybe tied to a vote option, you're not going to stop toxicity, but you will improve cases where tensions could be improved just through talking and not letting your thoughts stew.
---
Double BP is a good incentive to fight SWF, I'd fight SWF every damn time if it meant X2 BP
---
I’m running borrowed time, Insta heals, and wglf. Don’t really like running mom
---
It is now. Wasn’t then, but is now. Hopefully they’ll balance the game around it.
---
Me too just keep trying it’ll work.
---
Me too, just came here to see if its just me lol
---
This task’s a gruelling one, hope to find some diamonds tonight
---
Seriously ppl think discord is cheating? My God...
---
For now
---
So it was not the killer's ping and it happens to others too....
---
Yep
---
Even the best fall down sometimes
---
No problem man thanks for the tips
---
thanks
---
Maybe give Trapper addons that decrease transparency of his traps, common is 10% harder, uncommon is 30% invisible, Very rare is 60%, and  ultra-rare addon literally turns his traps near invisible, this would also incentivize perks that give queues when you see traps.
---
Also, I know that feel, Tier 1 Stealth Myers is literally a worse ghostface
---
IM SO FUCKING MAD CUZ I DONT KNOW WHAT KILLER TO BUY!
---
I knew it would be in there somewhere smh
---
That isn't the wrong Cosmetic 😉😏
---
I've noticed this too, but it seems like it only happens like 1/3 of the time. Only happens after this patch.
---
And don’t get me wrong. I’m glad they buffed him, his powers are amazing. I just have Freddy exhaustion playing against him Every. Single. Round.
---
I'm waiting for a salty wave of "oMg NoEd NoOb"
---
This helped me a lot as a new member to the community! :D &lt;3
---
Thanks for not being a scumbag tm8 and using BT
---
This achievement will single-handedly ruin games for months/years to come.
---
Getting farmed 😂 is funny 😂👌
---
He was being nice trying to tell you that was a bad loop but when HG hit he like "well, shit."
---
Go play survivor and get tunneled and face camped a bunch and see if you feel the same way.
---
Same here. My friend is having the same issue.
---
It should. Protection hits are where you take a hit for an injured survivor. I dont know if its still bugged
---
LMAO
---
Honestly that was my first match I used as rework freddy and lemme tell you it ended with a 3k and 1 DC with only 1 gen popped iirc
---
Lmao, no, that would’ve been dope. My vision went back to normal, he insta-healed, teabagged, and then threw a pallet lol. I downed him a bit later with the same result *shrugs*
---
LMAO this is accurate
---
Doesn’t camping killer means you spam attempt escape without actually escaping.
---
I love this.
---
A true r/madlads
---
Ah ok, so I am doing it properly. Thanks!
---
DM me if you want me to send you the link, I have uploaded them all from the game files.
---
Why is the wraith trying to hide the switch behind him smh
---
How many bloodpoints did it cost?
---
you come into my fucking house 
---
 INSULT MY NEAS
---
Y’all love to say how they need to stop releasing content so they can fix bugs well here it is. 😒
---
For five minutes. Can you please not destroy my hex totem
---
On pc those perks were teachable for Bill, and so when they were on console and Bill didn't exist they were altered. However, now Bill is on console they have been made back into teachables and returned to Bill's appearance. Which also means you now can't get those perks without grabbing them as teachables from Bill, sadly.
---
Where is leatherface in this
---
I've been burning cakes and streamers the games I play as Freddy, a peace offering if you will.  
---
Still I have survivors DC on their first down...
---
Right?? She's going to regret that
---
Yeah me and my friend were trying to play it but it just told us to restart and try again and never worked.
---
I'm having the same issue and I am also on Xbox
---
The game is far from balanced, The issue with balancing this game is that survivors only have perks, items, addons, pallets, ect. But killers have Lunges, Powers, perks, ect.
---
Each killer is unique so its hard to balance the game in there favor without making the stronger killers way 2 strong
---
Im not sure about a fix but Playing against spirits or nurses are just horrible
---
Exactly!! It even has the extra bonus of having that cute icon on your name 🤷
---
Literally
---
That's actually a really easy "Christmas in July" or something kind of event, good idea. It uses already existing assets, just switch it on and done
---
It's so cute that all the killers want it and that's why they chase after you so much.
---
That first sentence says: I don't speak English, but I'm trying.
---
Everything after is so solid tho. What's the first sentence/question supposed to say?
---
I had to hard restart my Xbox a couple times then force close the game like 4 times before it started working
---
Sure hope your dog will be ok
---
Try it. DH bug affect nearly all my games.
---
Neither of them are earned, NOED and adrenaline are opposite perks but Adren does not counter NOED, Hope is a better counter
---
It’s concerning that you kept thinking about me for two months just because I didn’t agree with you about an aspect of the game. Did you save that link, lying awake at night hoping that the devs would one day say that you were right? 
---
Additionally, I would appreciate it if you deleted that link, attempting to shame players is a violation of this subs rules and I don’t want to have my inbox blown up over a two month old argument.
---
It least you're not actively shooting yourself in the dick with No Mither
---
When the entity really hates you
---
He is not that bad, i do think Pop goes my brain cells is way more annoying now, but GF is much much worse
---
Then someone DCs and another gets downed and DCs. Rinse repeat
---
Rip those hard earned shards, could've been used so well too
---
Tip: For every 15 seconds you’re in a chase, get an M1 (aka injure someone) or a destroyed pallet, and leave. Only commit to the chase if you’re positive you can get them down without them wasting too much time. Do not commit for more than 30 seconds, if you have that’s wasted time. You should never be getting to Bloodlust 3 (bloodlust comes in every 15 seconds in a chase, it’s a mechanic for ending chases quicker). If in 15-30 seconds you haven’t at least injured someone or destroyed a pallet, you’ve wasted time and a gen is getting closer to being finished. 
---
Don’t tunnel is basically what I’m saying. Don’t facecamp either, but that should be common sense. If they’re in a SwF, proxy camping makes the most sense as they’re guaranteed to go in for the hook. If you have a survivor party where all 3 are going for one guy, this is not camping, you’re putting good pressure. No gens are getting done. But you have to learn how to juggle survivors. If one is slugged, go for the injure on another, then come back (Nurse’s Calling and/or Deerstalker is great for SwFs) In time you’ll get better
---
Same platform, same issue.
---
And everyone likes attention, she would get all of it
---
"*Oh thank God, that asshole didn't save me and did nothing, glad the killer is showing them no merc-*"
---
#"WAIT WHY ARE YOU GIVING HIM THE HATCH? NO!"
---
As lazy as that is, that would be totally cool in my book. Always could use more BP. :D
---
This is why I quit playing dbd as much. Why play solo surv and get smashed because nobody can do gens even at reds/purps. It's not fun doing 3+ gens by yourself a game and nobody else even doing 1
---
If she wants to waste her time and effort, I guess that's her stupid choice
---
You remove ruins AND increase gen repair time so nobody complains
---
&gt; rng is needed in a game like this because it forces everyone to adapt
---
What kind of "adaptation" is needed when survivor are lucky and spawn next to your ruins?
---
What kind of "adaptation" is needed when killers are lucky and ruins is near impossible to find?
---
Everyone seems to be having the issue. Hopefully they fix it soon. Everyone having this issue, submit a ticket and let them know what is going on. They’ll be quicker to fix it if everyone is having this issue.
---
this might be best plan hahahha
---
JFC I can’t believe people are seriously still bitching about this.
---
Yes?
---
I have yet to encounter a freddy that uses his dream snares.
---
If an entire platform is not working, they aren’t gonna just ignore it
---
Trash.
---
I wish they add free addons for killer especially for Freddy dream pallets
---
give me the source for "research"
---
"""""""""""""""almost"""""""""""""""
---
Me letting go at the hook is more fun than facing spirit. I've tried to not do it and always regret it. Always. When killers tunnel and camp do they consider others fun? No and they shouldn't really either.
---
I've been wondering wtf are survivor aura reading perks for if voip swf teams know where everyone is at all times
---
How about make killers fun? Its a videogame it's suppose to be fun for both sides.
---
Maybe they just didn't like the comment, what a concept
---
Hipster adam. Underrated and lit as fuck
---
I remember seeing the killer was spirit and noticed my teammate on a Hex Totem. 
---
I died that game.
---
I'm not talking about the basement.
---
Daddy David.  He can lose the shirt ;)
---
Weird. DbD runs miles better on my X than my OG xbox one.
---
I think some things are bugged right now.
---
What rank you in? I'm around rank 9 and hardly get any DC's. I'm jealous.
---
Which ones do you currently not have that you are looking into buying?
---
How dare you tease me with this and then never let me have it. It looks amazing

I usually don't mind it if someone teabags after I get stunned or outplayed, but if they gonna drop a pallet instantly without even stunning me and teabag the whole time I break it you bet your ass they get on the hook for the whole game
---
Well, he’s a content creator and his goal is to entertain, so he only puts in the games where there is a lot of action. I played against him one time and absolutely decimated him while playing as the Pig and he didn’t put in that game.
---
They usually say "We are aware of the issues and are working on a resolution"
---
there are still open threads from February lol
---
Ahh fuck this is good
---
I’m still confused pls help
---
This is... something that I can actually agree with. Faced two guys today, one tunneled and camped and the other tunneled, camped, AND teabagged (Ghostface). Both had anime profile pictures.
---
What does the fact that they are white bring into the conversation?
---
Sounds like you're the racist one and not the
---
&gt;"generally 15-21 y/o-ish white boys with no social life outside of discord that have to feel the need of being in power or superior opposed to others by any means necessary over the internet like for example Racism, Mobbing, Bullying and Harassing"

GUN GUN GUN SHOOT HER
---
My brother and I got the exact same message, you probably won’t lose any progress so don’t worry too much. If you do I’m sure you won’t be the only one and BHVR will probably do something to repay us for our troubles.
---
Well like I said, not everyone uses it to cheese the game. And just like camping it won't always work out. But when it does it IS unfair. Really how what you think about it isn't the point, more that, if you think SWF comms are fine, then you should think equally of camping and other things like that.
---
Some would argue that its just a moron xD
---
lmao
---
I play both killer and survivor equally. I understand both perspectives, and I have found that when the killers camp or tunnel, it usually doesn't go well for them.
---
I think people are just sick of playing against him.
---
That's the mind game. If you know they will run away then you fake an ambush and catch them trying to get away.
---
To be fair I just have my chat closed at all time
---
Have you tried doing a hard reset at all? We kinda played with it, but we managed to get it to work.
---
From my experience, it's less that they're really into anime and more that they know that an anime pfp triggers people even more.
---
People who DC immediately after getting knocked down.
---
NOED is for swf teams that do all the gens in less than 3 minutes b4 I can effectively use my perks.
---
Literally all they need to do to counter is to do the totems.
---
Dunno what's toxic about using a key. I've had hatches re-opened from a key found in a chest, etc. and I don't feel too annoyed. It sucks when it happens but if you really hate keys so much, bring Franklin's if you see one in the lobby. I do that all the time with Hag and trap the dropped item.
---
I don't see keys as much different to certain addon combos or perk builds for killer. Dull key is a Very Rare, Skeleton Key is an Ultra Rare. It's not as bad as old BNP which was insta-gen or the old insta-moris (Which I kind of miss but the Ebony Mori was hilariously strong as you'd just down, kill, repeat until last guy grabs hatch or you murder everyone.)
---
Hoping Clown gets a buff as well his bottles aren't good enough
---
About two~two and a half hours, so not very long! Me and my artist get along very well so the time flew by
---
I am going to wait to play killer because the queue is way too long for me to wait but I have played against him twice and he isnt too bad so far. I'm rank 7 and have gotten purple rank fredricks so far.
---
If a p3 Claudette wasn’t complaining about killers being broken then is it even a p3 Claudette?
---
Yup. restarted my xbox and it worked.
---
My first tattoo was the same length but way smaller and less detailed Lol! Your’s looks amazing though!
---
TrUSt MeE I’m A P3 ClAUDettE smh
---
Oh, I know! I just wanted to make sure people saw the DBD references LOL. I didn't want to make it seem like I posted a random tattoo on a gaming subreddit
---
Me too. I’m rank 6 and have gotten rank 2 and rank 3 Freddy’s
---
Let me introduce you to Thompson's Mix + Tuning Guide
---
All I see is a bunch of whining from an under skilled survivor.
---
Looks sick!
---
Dream pallets are the only one that's OP because unless you remember what pallets you threw AND the ones the other players threw you can't counter it.
---
Should be reverted. Does the same happen if the survivor plug-pulls? I recall a time period where everyone would DC (Hard DC, as in yank the cord or force-close the app) to avoid losing their purple flashlights with odd bulb and chemical halogen.
---
"Why is it that when I lag out of a game, I lose two pips."
---
Should they change it into something like the doctors?
---
They nerfed gluten free food?
---
That’s not what the sentence said
---
That's why I dont have a girlfriend. Behavior nerfed her

Yeah he still completes the tele lol

Toxic Thread
---
On the maps that don't have a lot of drop points, you really have to be thinking ahead and planning the chase so that you'll hit those drop points. For example, if you're near a shack with a basement, you can use the stairs to trigger BL if you come at it from the right angle. This in turn means that you want to plan the chase so that you enter the shack from the opposite side of the stairs. 
---
I believe that it's a great perk for teaching survs the importance of planning ahead before the chase even starts.
---
b l o o d p o i n t e c o n o m y
---
You have to go back to the exit and it should end the game.
---
Extremely fun, I thought I would miss the old Freddy at least a little bit but I was totally wrong.
---
Tbh they probably waited for ages.
---
Got super lucky with that firecracker. If she had looked up instead of turning around when she heard it fizz, she would've gotten away. Heck, if she had just not moved at all, she probably would've been fine.
---
It doesn't make much sense for Bill to even be on PS4 since there's not a single valve game over there, but whatever ig
---
About the price of one piggy cosmetic 😔
---
THANK YOU
---
You just mad cause you a tash killer main smh😂💀
---
Only played Freddy in the PTB so far, but this is the best part about him. Without pallets as a ggez escape, survivors just have no idea what to do at all. Set up a single dead zone around a central hook, and they'll refuse to touch any pallet anywhere in the map from then on.
---
Just like Jasons shack on Friday the 13th
---
When you have a stockpile of Swing Chains and Red Paint Brushes.
---
You can't.
---
Monto is (completely biased opinion here, no shame) one of the best DBD youtubers right now; he does build videos predominantly ([here’s an example](https://youtu.be/FWUsfS8_ZfE)), but his content is top notch.
---
I actually main survivor. And only play killer on occasion. Quit whining and get good at the game.
---
Killers leave to smash a gen because they know you can’t escape. If they change it back you’ll just get facecamped.
---
The killer does that because you can't escape, it's probably a way to just end the game faster since even if you escape you won't escape
---
this
---
Oh man I wish I could have read that, must have been fun.
---
MY FUCKING GAME GLITCHED OUT AND DIDN’T LET ME ESCAPE! I WAS FULLY OUTSIDE THE EXIT GATE AND STILL IT WOULDN’T REGISTER. I EVEN FELL OFF THE EDGE OF THE MAP! IT PUT ME RIGHT BACK IN THE GAME, SO I HAD TO GO AND LEAVE AGAIN, AND IT STILL DIDN’T GIVE ME THE ESCAPE!
---
Still talking about this in 2019...
---
It's easy to compare the two and one is massively stronger than the other since can be denied, period.
---
No big deal, whoever thinks people at high ranks use noed even after the datas BHVR has provided, it's just delusional. Many people uses adrenaline even at high ranks, nobody uses noed in high ranks for a reason.
---
Camping is part of the game, swf comms uses software that isn't in the game...
---
Thank you! I'm an idiot
---
Thiccy Jane
---
Thanks i love it!
---
The best way to not get these messages is playing doc, you'll be able to find anyone from across the map, so if they call it camping then they can go fuck themselves
---
I am good at the game killers can’t do shit against me on the Meyers map😂💀
---
That's just how the game plays. Sometimes killers will even wait for you to second state on the hook to make sure you don't try and escape.
---
ooh
---
Man you’re salty
---
Ehh yeah they suck at balance but say that Freddy is op its way too funny. 
---
Is he nurse tier? No
---
Is he Billy tier? No
---
Still op for whoever won't bother to learn.. okay..
---
I can agree with MoM but that doesn't make your point more agreeable about Freddy especially since one is a killer and the other a perk
---
Ah hello there
---
Or better, omega blink Nurse with a mori.
---
I don't t-bag at the exit gate because that can signal you're being toxic to the killer, but I do double t-bag to survivors I meet or if a killer is being friendly.
---
I think the hook thing is something people I play with need to learn though.
---
How many times have you played clown? He's fine.
---
I just wish they made the gates farther apart since the end game update. And no more monthly resets.
---
I don't ever want to defend disconnecting but I think at least some of them are disconnecting because they're sick of Freddy every game, not because he's OP.
---
Might not be because they don't know how to counter him it might be because 9 out of 10 matches are against him and it gets boring. Idk I had 3 out of the last 5 matches everyone DC and leaves me screwed, got pissed and went to Hulu.
---
Bruh, I restarted my xbox 5 times and nothing changed

3 they stated this even 2yrs ago
---
Elaborate a bit on what you're thinking? I can't quite tell if you're supporting camping or SWF comms sorry.
---
Aint not. LMAO what an idiot.
---
On PS4 you just assume everyone is in party communicating lol
---
And notify the killer of the survivor's location, and you couldn't see them when you're awake? You'd never wake up then, just like how you don't heal against plague. Otherwise, they'd have to **only** put awake survivors asleep, but that would suck, too, because it's a wasted trap.
---
Those are the ones I listed but I still can't really escape a killer or loop yet
---
Holy shit I didn’t think you’d get my reference. I’m actually super fucking happy this just made my day.

He already got his rework on live.

Some killers respect the kobe, plus if you're last hooked there's always a chance of a dead hard/ds to escape if you 4%. I think you should be able to attempt but not struggle if you're last hook.
---
They needs to spruce up survivors gets boring after awhile killers are so different and have so many play styles survivors not so much
---
I like hiding in closets sometimes so would Jane's perk help that? thinking of buying her soon.
---
r/PrequelMemes exists for a reason. You say hello there on that sub and your inbox will just be "General Kenobi"
---
Myers is stronger, but Ghost Face can tea bag, so get him !
---
'If the survivors use game mechanics or are better than me I will waste both mine and their time for the sole purpose of being a sore loser! That'll show them!'
---
...
---
Whoosh
---
Oh come on, it spawned right on top of him!
---
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
---
My friends and I say that to each other all the time when we enter chat so I’m like 10/10 happy rn
---
Makes sense just sucks when earlier i had deliverance and adrenaline ready and was hooked right by the closed hatch with a purple key.  I would have made it out had it let me unhook.
---
Yeah this shit made me stop bringing items and START using plunderers instinct with extra cheat offerings 😂
---
*Fully swing on first hook three times and don't struggle*
---
fUCK yOU GUYS I don'T cARE
---
Extreme Speed Electroweb Cutter
---
I think it'd be much better if they didn't. More stealth killers need to have Tier 1 Myers aura-reading protection.
---
By far the best counter
---
Rough spot hopefully the hollowed blight comes back id love to see legion and clown as monsters
---
I just took a closer look at it and it's freaking me out right now.
---
Maybe the game checks programs active. If there is any discord, Skype etc... It just shuts down the game for the survivors and you need to mercy again.
---
Similarly, how when you play LoL and type in the search engine “hacks” the game would just crush....
---
Or that their primary power is .... . But there is also a secondary power, which is that Imitation. Yet, the killer is good enough, that even without his mimicking power he is somewhat good. Imagine clown-tier power, kinda, as primarily.
---
Or make an imitation killer, which also bends dimension. There are 4 different worlds (4 identical maps in one gaming plan). Survivors start each in different world, and play with bots in each world. So, per world can be 4 players (4 survivors, 3 survivors 1 not, 2-2, 1-3).
---
So, you have no idea, even if you have microphone, no way to know if they are real one or not. And the fun begins. A killer will be spawned in one of the worlds, with the power allowing them to disguise. Important to say, that bots will pretend to do gens, heal each other etc. even t-bag. Yet the survivors have no indicator whether they completed a real gen or mimicked completing one (no indicator how many gens left to do). 
---
Avery gen the real survivors do will count as 1/4 of a real gen (as they will be able to work in 4 worlds, 3 worlds without the killer). 
---
Every few minutes, the worlds would collapse (the survivors and hunter are randomly distributed again between these 4 worlds. The difference is, that the gen progress remains). And here we go again, you have no way of knowing which one is real or not.
---
What do you say?
---
Fair enough
---
It would be Detective Pikachu, to find out where the killer’s spine is
---
I don't have any. I was thinking Laurie, but I don't know if she's difficult to play or not. I mainly want her for decisive strike
---
I’ve heard about a 2nd objective, but that won’t come out soon.
---
I cream myself when I see triangles.
---
Haven’t gotten him yet sadly thoe I’m still yellow you assume everyone is rushing to play him
---
And self care + solidarity with a ranger medkit and 2 instaheals... ez win
---
I hope dissconecting was bannable
---
I hook someone, remember i'm running STBFL, i press esc to check which character is my obsession, hooked survivor kills himself. 
---
I guess i camped 0.0000023 seconds and we deserve the game ruined.
---
I believe that Plague is the leat fun killer to play against, and one that takes no skill to play whatsoever. She can constantly vomit on you, causing you to build up the sickness until you become broken and die in one hit, this vomit takes no skill to use or aim, and can only be countered if there is a big enough object in your immediate vicinity. Once broken, caused by an ability that is as easy as anything to use, you need to cleanse, giving her corrupt vomit, which takes even less skill, because unless you are once again able to hide behind an object in your immediate vicinity, and hiding is not a permanent solution, you can get hit without the killer having to put in any skill, and can be too easily downed. If no one cleanses this denies her the opportunity to use this, but then essentially makes the match a No Mither run but without any of the upsides of No Mither.
---
Hatch
---
It would be splash because this community is useless
---
Play killer and get a bunch of BP to throw onto your survivors until you have every teachable to get on your main survivor(s)
---
Why do you recommend Jane, though?
---
I always swing because being hooked is boring and most console players are oblivious anyway
---
I think the salt is real with blood pallet Freddy. Not entirely sure why. I like that it's risky to loop now.
---
I’d like it thoe it would be hard to do I think a step is more bp for survivors cause then at least bloodpoints is an attempt to make the player base more balanced thoe people would complain sadly
---
True, it will. Glad to see you understand
---
I DEMAND THIS BE A SKIN NOW
---
Mathieu I have made the many sacrifices to your true form of The Entity, now I demand you grant me what I desire
---
I wish it'd let you but they would just wait and make you attempt to escape before walking away. That being said if you run deliverance and ds or dh it is kind of unfair.
---
Clown isn't fine at all. He has 40+ bugs at the moment. I can show you a video clip with Clown bugs if you want.
---
What exactly would you say he's best at?
---
Honestly just because head on is really fun
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
Glad they finally have their priorities straight.
---
Maybe something can be done about it? Like really? Multiple worlds, randomly mixing survivors up every few minutes with bots and killer.
---
Anti-cheat system, shutting down all communication devices during the game. For example, in LoL if you use search engine to type “cheats” during the game, the game will crash.
---
So many different ways to prevent it. Or better — inability of mimicking killer to be matched with survivors in a lobby (you cannot be matched with survivors, creating a lobby or inviting; only random matchmaking works). And so many other solutions
---
But that's what the roar is for, so they know wether you're ambushing or not. So, again, Pig depends entirely on Survivors making silly mistakes.
---
Good bait.
---
No Mither + Self Care
---
Clown
---
Today i saw an Otz stream and he had Tinkerer. I think it wasn't good, Freddy can't teleport that fast to stop the gen from being done. Especially when there are two survivors on the gen.
---
If voice chat isn't cheating for SWF groups, then me tunneling and hook camping anyone I manage to down isn't, either.
---
I think that's fair. If you're goin' outta your way to ensure I have no fun that round, why should I allow you to have any fun during it? No, I don't particularly care if your team gets all five generators in the time it takes me to down, hook, and camp you until the Entity spikes your ass and flicks you back to the campfire like the booger that you are. I'll get my one guaranteed kill and you can just deal with it.
---
The rest of your team also won't get the pleasure of exit room teabagging, as I'll just bugger off to the basement afterwards. Shine some hooks. Put another flashlight in the chest for some reason. Y'know. The things killers do between rounds.
---
I agree with not only everything you just said, but also how you spelled it. Devise Stripe should be nerfed to oblivion.
---
I’ve played probably 30 matches since new Freddy dropped and only played against him once :(
---
You were right, thanks
---
it works now
---
Cant tell if this guy is trying to joke or not
---
I'll never get people that cheat in competitive games. Like... You're not even winning at that point?
---
1 minute to find a match, 1-2 for people to ready up and start instead of leaving early, 1-2 minute loading time to get in the map. Sucks to go through the wait for under 10k (best case scenario)  when it keeps happening. Every offering seems like a waste right now and just sprinting to find the hatch before the killer does is garbage.
---
Strong mind game potential
---
Teabag=Death
---
As survivor I’ve gotten a full iri game with 22k. Can’t wait for the rank system rework bc it’s hot trash
---
I would hope so, for his sake.
---
Rule number 2759 If I Billy am about to chainsaw you don’t dead hard! It already takes time to rev the chainsaw!
---
I just posted a separate post. As I found out this evening the physical collision of the blood pallets is different. So I know how to tell which one is which now.
---
r/whoosh
---
Do you have hex ruin yet? I'd get hag just for that tbh
---
When you die don't spam us with messages while your buddies are still playing. All it makes us do is hardcamp your buddies.
---
I can’t find the ”shitpost“ flair
---
Every Freddy I’ve played against since release just blood lusts and never breaks a pallet lmao
---
The point still stands that, if Trapper ever becomes meta, he has 3 perks dedicated pretty much solely to countering him.
---
Of course. Surely no one though I was talking about decisive strike. That perk is balanced
---
Damn dude cool to know, thanks!
---
as a legion main this pleases me
---
The salt is real
---
Feels Shards man
---
Its also hard to pay attention swhenyiu being chased you'll have to think quickly
---
IN A MATCH WE ALL GOT INSTANTLY SLUGGED BY A LEGION AND LEFT TO BLEED OUT ON THE FLOOR. I DE-PIPPED AND LOST MY RED KEY :(
---
GGEZ bby killer, can't kill us if we DC! /s
---
SWF are either the absolute worst thing to play about, or will hand you a game as soon as the first person goes down by hook trading, at bare minimum, 24/7.
---
Sad panda is very sad
---
It is ironic how much bloodpoints I'm willing to spend just to get more bloodpoints...
---
Pretty sure you’re not supposed to have giant turtles and talking kung fu rats up your arsehole
---
I still hate you ♥️
---
Sincerely-the friend in the picture
---
Thank you for this, I’ve found my people.
---
I know that. many people are in the Denial, Anger or Bargaining stages of grief tho
---
Then look it up dumb shit😂💀
---
He made Claudette vault and just as she vaulted someone triggered Haunted Grounds
---
I get I look like a dick now, but before that edit there were no exclamation points, no "as a bonus it counters nurse's calling" line, and especially no /s. That's not a whoosh, that's just making the joke completely obscured.
---
Or it would be over to quickly.
---
"Is that you coming to help me on this gen?"
---
"Nah that's not me, must be another Claudette."
---
"OH MY GOD SHE STABBED ME!"
---
If you bring a bunch of amazing items to a match you can't complain when I bring Franklins Demise
---
There are “rules” for survivors, they just choose not to follow them. Do the same as a killer and move along with your day
---
"any killer that comes out" Spiritcoughcough
---
he got her to vault the window the second that Haunted Grounds was popped so he got an insta down \^\^
---
Cry in post game chat all you want but don't fucking DC. Have some respect for your teammates.
---
Cant we all just agree that both survivor mains and killer mains are equally toxic
---
Am I though?
---
Don't worry they will. As it impacts survivors. Any killer bugs get ignored for months.
---
DONT TEABAG ME YOU WILL HURT MY FEELINGS
---
Isn’t there a game like that already?
---
This has been happening to me as well! 
---
I was playing with my friend yesterday and he wouldn’t receive my invites so we played something else
---
Now, every time I get into a game I get kicked out
---
WE SHOULD GET TO KEEP OUR OFFERINGS IF SOMEONE GETS DROPPED AND THE GAME SHUTS DOWN.
---
YEAH THATS WHAT I ALWAYS DO AFTER BEING UNHOOKED FIRST TIME BUT I CANT USE IT TWICE SADLY :((((
---
This guy is literally a bot
---
Freddy needs to say "welcome to prime time bitch!" Everytime someone falls asleel
---
Will still waste a bit of time since you'll be searching for a real pallet and not doing a gen. 
---
Still its a big improvement for Nightmare since he was useless pre rework.
---
Happening on my stream right now. Good timing BHVR

Male Seeking Male: Crotus Prenn Asylum
---
Was in a match against a Freddy. 1 player DC’D (connection issues or rage quit) then Freddy chased me, knocked me down, and once you picked me up to bring me to my well deserved hook, my screen went back to the loading menu. If anyone was that Freddy I swear I didn’t DC, it’s these stupid servers. I would’ve gladly continued to play against you. I was the scruffy Jake with a flannel shirt and black vest and black pants.
---
for the last 2 hours been having major issues.
---
List of perks survivors can NEVER use: [https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/survivor/](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/survivor/)
---
I play solo and in the 15 or so matches I've played against Freddy he's gotten a 4k every time usually with 4 gens left. They're so preoccupied with waking each other up and getting totems. It's driving me nuts. I don't dc though.
---
Same, kind of annoying!
---
Merciless has nothing to do with your BP. It's all about your emblems. Not sure why you're complaining about points.
---
I mean, I really enjoy Ohmwrecker.
---
Maybe while on hook, Rapidly raising your arms means "Im free" while not doing so means that the killer is close or camping. You can see hooked survivors auras even without kindred so it'll be really easy to see these short messages
---
No that's the huntress's
---
Dead by Daylight's EULA (End User License Agreement - you agree to it when you install or load the software) bans anything outside of the game that gives any degree of advantage, such a third-party software for "struggle macros", they define it as "features which are not documented".
---
This is part of what makes exploits (legally) punishable, like if you abused any of the recent bugs knowingly (Sprint Burst, Legion Blades on either occasion it was bugged, Wake Up, etc); it also applies to map bugs (jumping through a window that should be Entity Blocked for you is abusing an undocumented feature) but those are harder to track.
---
But it's also what people cite when they have a problem with VOIP/SWF; inviting your friends to a party is a "documented DbD feature", voice chatting with them while playing is *not*.
---
Few people think BHVR should actually ban it, most people want them to balance their game around it, but regardless of what Peanits (or any other DbD developer says), *it is still against the EULA*.
---
So when BHVR refuses to balance around it it's more "ban or balance"; they should pick one or the other, not sit between both like this.
---
Maybe but at least im not trash so who cares
---
"Get good" ah yes the classic response that doesnt help at all. Doing totems waste so much time when you could be doing gens and getting out. Which gives the killer an extra what? Minute or so which he can kill or hook/down atleast 2 people if hes good. Honestly your response doesnt help at all idk why you even commented if youre just gonna say "get good".
---
I think they did a pretty good job so far
---
.... You want to be rewarded for quitting a game? This is what happens when kids get participation trophies...
---
Just so you know, it's "hers" :)
---
So the killer is automatically always the Knight and the survivors are always salty? Hmm.
---
Detective pikachu isn't even a move idiot. It would require batman to find you a brain
---
Yep god forbid some randoms actually work as a team to keep someone from dying. So toxic. Some killers are actually fucking brain dead
---
'Noob3 is too toxic' 
---
 
---
Yeah you haven't watched No0b3
---
I would funnel him too
---
Please do. Bugs should always be fixed, but it does mean he needs a buff. Me saying he's fine had more to do with his power level and less with his stability.
---
Of course. My time was wasted why wouldn't I get points for it
---
Yes, been trying for 30 minutes now. Finally loading into game but we'll see how that goes.
---
Farmer John! &lt;3
---
Atleast you didn’t get hook camped by leatherface
---
Honestly I used to be a big fan of Save the Best but recently I've stopped using it. It requires a bit too much setup and is also really easy to screw up. If you can get it to work it's great but I'd rather have a perk that always works.
---
Decent idea, although if they implement something like this they'd probably only deduct 500 each prestige
---
Good.
---
I honestly do not even know what you mean by knight. But about 50% of the time as killer and I stay in the lobby all people do is complain about whatever thing they want to complain about. It is not my job to sit there and let them vent. I say gg and move on.
---
*gg ez*
---
I'm a killer main but I think SWF chats are smart and how survivor should be played...
---
Totally fine with this. Focus on game health first, we just got the new Freddy rework and people are still playing around with GF.
---
I can’t find games either today and every game we have found has been a hook camper
---
It's definitely not every one. I'm not getting any error.
---
Having a similar problem. Getting Join Game Failure and Host Unreachable messages practically every time I try to load into a lobby. When I actually get into one, I get booted.
---
Least you accept defeat
---
When he does come, will we have to level him up or can we still use the perks of his we already have?
---
OH GOD SHE'S HOT
---
The slow is pretty negligible, as for the pressure presence thing, why is everyone trying to change all killers rather than just buff killers in general? What do you want them to do? Give him a clown car he can drive around?
---
That was rude. Blocked and reported
---
one could only hope 🤤
---
I played him once and got 2 dc's. It doesn't matter, i mostly play Pig.
---
Speaking of which, will she be receiving any buffs?
---
Oooooh I didn't know that. That muddles things a bit. I agree they should pick one or the other. Thanks for sharing!
---
For some reason, don’t ask me why, until we get dedicated servers the game can’t tell whether it is a legitimate disconnect or a person leaving the game early. That’s why they haven’t been enforcing bans for frequent disconnectors.
---
Savage 🤣🤣
---
&gt;you don't even have to play them to get their teachables, you know
---
I honestly hate Leatherface as a whole and would be so much happier if they just removed him and his perks from the game. Yes that includes BBQ, which is the only perk of his I can tolerate. Everything about him does nothing but encourage toxicity: slugging, taking items, finding people from across the map, and camping. And the big issue is he's only good at being toxic.
---
Leatherface needs a serious rework and his perks do too.
---
Not that I'm aware of but she could use some
---
* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots.

I second this
---
Try OhTofu, he mostly streams but he posts like one or two videos every week and he's trying to do more I think.
---
Isn’t that the uncleasebble totem spot or a different one
---
so there I was, barbecue sauce on my tiddies
---
Europe only!?
---
That actually sounds fun
---
derank enough to face potatoes and then it becomes easier to use his power.
---
*looks for shit post flair*
---
So you're just applying your own specific instances to this broad general meme that could be about anything.
---
I'm a killer main and this....this is just stupidity. SWF =/= toxic. By his logic i should be able to get Double bloodpoints and a free escape if i go against spirit, billy or nurse because it's "avoiding toxicity" Plus survivors should be able to see what killer it is before a match begins so they can adjust their builds accordingly e.g urban evasion for hags etc  
---
By his logic, if a leatherface or billy revs his chainsaw for more than 6  seconds it becomes unusable. Also teabagging is annoying but I don't think it needs to be stopped? I find it funny when they do it because i can sometimes get a free hit. You can't fast vault from the crouched position right?
---
RACISTT
---
This is MARVELOUS, darling.  Do you have any more?
---
You right. These damn millennials
---
I've blackpiped once with 32k. It's not about BP.
---
DC buff is more of a lore post
---
That's cute
---
So it's a versus game right? It's a 4v1, in the chat who's gonna get more shit from whom?
---
Killers are players as anybody else but the group will always pick on the solo, even in nature a group of wolfs will kill and eat the one who's alone
---
So instead this post wanna encourage bullies making fun of the one who says whatever and just leave to have a slight relief.
---
Not one sided at all.. wow..
---
It's not a matter of being a knight or a Martyr it's a matter of what's the best thing to do to avoid an headache for no reason
---
As far as i’m aware, if a character has one of his perks, they keep it, but for presteging or characters who don’t it will become like a regular teachable
---
You can blame my friend chris smith

What happened when my friend tried joining a pub match as survivor
---
I'm really happy that they are focusing on core game mechanics before trying to put in events. It shows how Behavior would rather put the gamer's needs before money that they could've made through the event. It's nice to see a game company actually satisfy their consumers rather than exploit them, like Activision or EA.
---
That's the embarassing thing, I'm only on Rank 16 haha
---
I'm as serious as the guy that joker asked why so serious
---
I just edited it, honestly my bad for letting people’s opinions totally suade me
---
There's just some obvious things though, she's absolutely on the weaker side of the killer spectrum.  Like make rules set no.2 a base ability, or put her roar towards the end of the charge. I'm kinda disappointed.
---
Yes because I am one of the people who saw the meme and am allowed to share my opinion on what is being said. 
---
Also what I shared specifically addressed the title and what this meme is about. I get to the after game lobby, say my final words, AKA gg. And then leave.
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
I'm pissed at the survivors.  I'm glad Freddy got buffed.
---
I got it on my 2nd web level while starting mag
---
100% of the profits

They should make rule set no. 2 a stronger version of the add on that adds less time to rbr

All that's left is to buff Pig and Clown next

For some reason I don’t believe that.

Friend and I were playing against a trapper once. Took 30 tries (he counted out loud each time) for him to get off
---
Literally shaking and crying rn.
---
Sorry for the shitty MSPaint job, I just couldn't unsee this in my perk build and had to visualize it.
---
Really that serious you want points for leaving how about you lose 10 pips and all your bloodpoints if you DC
---
You're injecting your own negative experiences into this meme that I made which could apply to any situation.  I'm honestly surprised this meme would be so controversial and trigger so many people.
---
Just to throw it out there, I made this meme because I was in a match where 2 randoms DC'd after they got downed, which ruined the game for me and another random. We got obliterated. In the post game chat, the first thing that Freddy said was:
---
"Thanks for wasting my time. Fucking assholes."
---
And immediately left. 
---
I didn't get the chance to say what I wanted to say, which would have been: 
---
"Sorry about those two DCs, it sucks for all of us but I stayed in the game to see everything through. gg."
---
But if you were lucky enough to get it before he was brought in, you would still keep the perks.
---
I’m confused on what made you think that was James?
---
Truetalent
---
Obviously trolling. Like every post that this guy ever posts. I'm pointing out the stupidity of it.
---
PAULIE ESTER! HES THE NICEST PERSON I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED
---
I'm staring at my Freddy loadout right now, and I have Purple tier Hex: Ruin equipped.  I go to my bloodweb and the perk is there as well. I could show proof if you really want me to.
---
The locker aura blocking is a base thing that doesn't require any perks. *You* also become unable to see auras (Hence the blindness) because after the aura blocking was added, people would equip Object Of Obsession (Laurie Strode perk. When you look at the killer, you see each others auras. You see them and they see you) hop in a locker, and tell their 3 SWF buddies where the killer was headed while the killer had no idea someone was running OoO. 
---
Head On has been a bit buggy. I've seen people get yoinked mid-locker vault, etc. and the stun hitbox is weird although it was supposedly made much more consistent recently. Remember it is an exhaustion perk so comboing it with Sprint Burst means if you do the head on stun and it connects, you become exhausted and can't sprint burst, and if you use sprint burst and still are exhausted, the locker stun won't work. 
---
You also mentioned Calm Spirit. Calm Spirit's always been a weird perk. Alerting crows used to be a big deal because when this game first came out, Spies From The Shadows was actually a meta perk, making Calm Spirit also meta.
---
Nobody really runs spies from the shadows anymore, so Calm Spirit was reworked to also prevent screams which can give the killer a loud noise notification bubble. This includes stuff like clown gas, infectious fright (Killer perk, downing someone makes anyone in your Terror Radius scream and give a notification) Iron Maiden (Killer perk, check lockers faster and anyone exiting a locker becomes exposed making them insta-downable for a bit and scream), Doctor (Who pretty much makes EVERYONE scream just by existing. Former doc main and nothing was worse than people running Calm Spirit as it negates most of your abilities). It also prevents screams from being hit and I am not sure if that is any useful as they don't seem to give noise bubbles even if you do a cross-map hatchet hit. Hilariously it also makes you die faster since you don't go through the screaming animation when hooked.
---
If you wanna keep quiet while hurt, use Iron Will. Calm Spirit protects against map-crows and screams from killer perks/abilities, while Iron Will (And No Mither, but that perk is never worth running besides injured-builds like This is Not Happening, Dead Hard, and Resilience) muffles the moaning (and COMPLETELY SILENCES IT at level 3) which is important because even with impaired hearing I can still catch people from it.
---
Go ahead then, link image.
---
Tho I do agree we need to change the DC like add something like csgo and Overwatch if you do it too often
---
I was born in 1962 but you are probably a worthless millennial. People from your time need to learn that time is not something that should be wasted but you kids all spend hours on end in bed because you are "depressed" my time is valuable so I deserve  to be compensated
---
“MICHAEL”
---
I'll be totally honest, I'm not sure how.
---
Would've used dance with me or sprint burst for bottom perk
---
Ah completely missed that thanks! Damn
---
IT'S NOT DECISIVE TIME :(
---
Old bug, they're working on it. Don't pick up a survivor or do anything that would interrupt or delay the sacrifice animation when EGC is almost over. If it happens in the future, pull the plug to end the match so that everyone gets their full BPs.
---
Yeah there legit needs to be disciplinary measures added to DC'ing lol. But that will never happen 😂
---
It would have to be link to the image posted elsewhere. 
---
e.g. Imgur, Twitter, etc
---
That soundtrack is a fucking banger
---
You better start playing David and get that No Mither.
---
I agree with this decision
---
tell me about it
---
Yes you are allowed to share your opinion. But your comment sounded like you were just shutting down my message because of a very specific instance that you thought the meme could be applied to.
---
Survivors can be bullies to innocent killers, and killers can be bullies to innocent survivors.
---
It's a Summer Themed skin.
---
**Dat360NoScope** - He does no commentary videos and every video has one Survivor and one Killer round.
---
**Puppers** - More of a streamer than a YouTuber, he's still usually very chill and fun to watch (at least IMO).
---
**Demi** - A bit on the overly goofy/strange side he's not my personal favorite to watch, but maybe you should give him a shot.
---
**Farmer John** - I've honestly only watched one of his videos, but he has a very relaxing voice and I've heard good things about him. Maybe give him a shot if you haven't already.
---
It's absolutely huge in red and brown ranks. If things go even slightly wrong, survivors will DC and then lambast you for "making the game unfun", even if you were just playing normally. Can't wait for the dedicated servers to come out so these people will get temp banned every single time they do it.
---
Man I needed a good laugh today.
---
I avoid all of that by saying GG and leaving. Also one person can't shut down your Reddit post. I was just sharing why there are good reasons why someone would just say something and leave.
---
Lmfao I have to try this.
---
Mine has finally connected but it’s still kind of slow. Still better than before at least. PS4 has been very buggy the last week or so, wonder if that’s part of the reason Bill has been delayed for the PS4.
---
They've actually shadow-buffed Infectious Fright with the most recent patch: it now activates on any instance of a survivor entering the dying state. This is good news for Billy, and to a lesser extent Huntress.
---
My Fright build on Nurse paired it with Nurse's Calling, Monitor &amp; Abuse and either Knock Out or Deerstalker, but Billy might be better off using a chase perk or two (Enduring primarily, and then possibly either Fury or Bamboozle).
---
I mean once dedicated servers they said they will look more into the punishments because right now they can't. See the logs of the hosts server so they can't tell if a DC is a manual DC or if they lost connection but on the logs you can see that
---
I notice the killer DCed. Nice.
---
I AM A M G E R Y BECAUSE THE NEW EXPERIMENT IS FOR ONLY EU PLAYERS AND NOT NA PLAYERS. I MEAN WHAT WOULD REALLY BE DIFFERENT IF THEY LET EVERYONE DO IT.
---
Can't wait til gachi dbd chapter
---
Lol the power the t-bag holds over you killers is mindboggling lol.
---
Beets, bears, bloodpoints.
---
Jokes on you I escape most of my no mither games and killers still try and slug me for some reason.
---
Yeah I should have included in the title that this was meant to be for the killers who are overly aggressive for no reason.
---
When you make the meme text the title
---
I second this statement. 
---
OP doesn't have to watch No0b3 if they don't want to, but he's not that toxic IMO.
---
i’m fine with his powers i just feel like he needs to be a little slower
---
Yeah, this doesn't look like a lag switch to me. If they were going to do it, they would've hit it on the run-up to that first pallet, not wasted time and let you run around and potentially get away. This just looks like a totally normal lag spike that just happened to be at a bad time, especially since LF's movement wasn't behaving like a lagswitch causes.
---
No, idiot it is very not obvious
---
HOW DARE YOU

There you go, you can see ruin equipped, and ruin on the bloodweb, though it got eaten by the entity because I didn't pick it up again.
---
See I didn't even think of it in that sense but now understand the context. So that's on me, because it does seem pretty obvious to me now. Good meme now that I actually understand it.
---
bruh
---
Bruh that’s Ruin III.
---
I think the last one was america only
---
Yes, a perk I have already, and got again?
---
That event is awful though
---
I’ll check him out, never seen him before!
---
and nothing beats poised tbh
---
Every perk can be obtain until Tier three, you only have tier two. There’s no higher rarity color for perks above purple.
---
No that would take away any incentive to DC. They need to do something that increases people's desire to DC
---
Do people still use Mettle of Man? I still only have it because it fits Ash's personality, and even then, I don't think I ever actually managed to use it.
---
This game would be dead with out SWF.
---
freddys traps dont damage people. Meaning it could waste time/items if you stepped in a trapper trap if you loose the survivor and it could mean a 1 hit down later on if they decide not to heal.
---
too many people want to play killer and not enough people want to play survivor so it's hard to make a fair match when you don't have enough people
---
He could just be power joaquin
---
I literally haven't gone a single freddy since the rework. NOT. ONE. I just have no idea why, so I'll play freddy lol
---
Sorry I should be more mature. I was born in 1962 after all
---
same thing happened to me but in a killer game 🤦‍♀️
---
I know that, I'm not saying that you can get lower tiers of perks after you have the highest tier, just that you can get the same ones again. That's what I meant in my original comment.
---
No Mither counters NOED, MYC, Haunted Grounds, Rancor, Iron Maiden, Hilbilly’s and Cannibal’s chainsaws, Tier III Evil Within, Night Shroud, Feral Frenzy, Bloody Coil, Iridescent Head, Pinky Finger, Coulrophobia, and Nurse’s Calling. Am I missing anything else?
---
There it is, the stupidest shit I’ll read all day.  How dare these mean old survivors talk to each other amirite?
---
Claud recognized him as james and apperently that is his steam name
