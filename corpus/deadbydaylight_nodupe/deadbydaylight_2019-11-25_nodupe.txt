I do this sometimes. Only because like 98% of my other games someone goes for the hook instantly.
---
---
---
I'd love it. Just the map, no killer or survivor. Maybe Kazaan and one of his perks can be Savant
---
Which is ALSO a good reason to have husks.
---
lol is every survivor ever on PC toxic or something bc that’s all I see memes and comments about like damn
---
I don't DC, but I do hate him. He has a built-in Insidious that's much better than Wraith or Michael's, he gets rewarded for being revealed, and he's irritating to play against because he bypasses both the terror radius and height mechanics intended to make Killers noticible.
---
Ok there bud, I'm getting my stacks no matter what, you can't stop me
---
I believe perks are earned differently on mobile but im not sure about teachables
---
You'd hope survivors had more variety to play with because unlike killers they don't have powers which affect their playstyle
---
A little bit of it definitely depends on maps. Billy struggles on indoor maps but Ghostface excels on them, vice versa for the big open corn maps. Freddy's a can of worms I don't want to open in this discussion lol but he's definitely in the conversation for stronger killers.
---

---
One nice thing about GF is a strong SWF doesnt shut him down as well as most killers. It's hard to coordinate around what he is doing when you almost never know where he is. If you play a predictable sneak up and stalk style they know who you are going after and where they can pressure. If all you're doing is popping out of nowhere, smacking people and dissapearing, it becomes very difficult to predict when and where he's going to pop out next. Combine that with how dangerous healing around a GF with Nurse's is, and sprinkle in the occasional gen grab when they're lazy and you got a hell of a killer.
---
People can't stand it when their opinions clash with facts; anonymously down-voting the truth without providing evidence to support their standpoint is far easier than actually doing research or studying human biology. at university. for 5 years. which is what I did.
---
And you'll notice I won't pretend to be an expert, however a colorblind person will (as you can see above). This kind of argument from authority is a logical fallacy, but reddit falls for it all the time.
---
I let the last go if there's a DC, or the remaining players go if there are two.
---
I'll also let the last one go if they're baby Survivors.

You can still not get enough points in the category to depip. Imagine you get an early 3k and one dc, you'd get 1k chase points. you have to do certain actions to get a pip or double pip. for example stopping the generators doesnt give you many points but it helps you pipping.
---
Im gonna be honest, and give full allowance to downvote me, but...

I did this lately, as Leatherface. Sorry little Quentin, but your Team shouldn´t have done the last two gens whilst i was chasing you

---
Thats why I made my suggestion, which would fix all problens you just described, exept for the single game beeing ruined. We can add getting a bbq stack, I like that idea.
---
Pretty sure they do it to flex, its such a dumb thing thats been going on lately. Everyone screaming the word "Mains"
---
It's usually noobs that use that word
---
Reminder to all pc players that you can turn vsync off in the dbd config folders and it makes skill checks x400 easier to hit! :)

Yes, I've been able to easily find people with them. They've lasted over a year, I'm just upgrading to the hyperx cloud alpha, it doesn't come with an adapter for 7.1 surround sound but without using the adapter the way drivers are made helps. I only recently had some crackling when the cord moves but thats because I didn't get an adapter for it and didn't always use the USB 7.1 Surround sound adapter that came with it and I was resting the controller near my stomach when I used it always. That's why I recommend using the adapter that comes with it or getting an Lshaped adapter with it that lets it not go into your stomach and bend. Pretty much when I used it the cord was in a constant U shape where it connects because of how I used it. Build quality is good and you also get earpads to swap out if you need something more comfortable. I bought an Lshaped adapter and am getting the new headset tomorrow, it was $6.99 for 3 of them.
---

you win this time
---
That transition from map to map during the blink on to the top of the hill was some of the most beautiful editing i've seen, good job
---
I originally thought this was made because of the Death gardens death... rip
---
Yeah, theres definitely wtf moments when i play PS4, like the marker literally showing up on the skillcheck area already due to framerate lag
---
OoO, if used properly, it is more annoying then anything. The survivors have your position constantly, if you try to go for them, everyone else gen rushes and body blocks, even if it means sacrificing themselves.
---
M4
---
And both are being ran by a Doctor also running Unnerving and Overcharge.
---
I also dont have a problem with it because it isn't "unfair" in my eyes. It just increases the punishment for messing up. (It also makes for some funny situations for inexperienced survivors such as myself when I get clapped at the gate while tbagging) . Ruin on the other hand completely stalls the game. Since neither me not my friends can consistently hit great skill checks, so we have to hunt this totem down or tap the gens which is annoying. It just makes it so nothing happens for 10 minutes.
---
Really isn't but ok.
---
I wonder; at what point did this subreddit become people's diary?
---
Astro a50s
---
- I find survivors because I hear them
---
I’d rather they do gens than hide in a locker when the killer isnt anywhere near them..
---
you can go back to super long lunges and busted dead hards if you like. Or you can be patient and wait for them to perfect the dedicated servers, which aim to be smoother than the game has ever been.
---
Although i do think P2P should be reserved as a fallback if the main servers fail
---
the killer mains killed u man, but seriously if I haven’t teabagged or flashlighted once the whole match and the killer DCs that’s on the killer for not just taking the L. I’ve had too many pussy ass killers unplug their shit and cause me to get no points for the whole match bc they decided to chase me or my friend for 2+ gens and those assholes deserve a message. always kicks me back to main menu when they do that so I fuckin can’t
---
Hey I played against Scott Jund once and he was using nurse with only bamboozle and he he decked my entire team and I so don't bully me
---
theres so many things wrong here
---
You wiggle, you die, simple as that
---
They indeed are earned differently.You get them with level ups.Not in the blood*market* anymore.
---
So yeah, teachables may not spawn there actually.
---
But how else would you teach your perks to other characters?
---
I don't use headphones personally, they give me headaches after 15 minutes and I've never liked the feeling of having my head constricted like that. Earbuds are right up my alley though, and I use JLabs 'Epic Premium Earbuds.' yes that is literally the name of them. They're on sale for $30 right now on JLabs website, they usually go for $70. The audio quality is fantastic and the directional awareness is stellar. They're plastic with a hard aluminium cover that keeps them pretty safe from damage. 
---
To give a general idea of the audio quality, I can usually hear a Survivor's pain grunts from on the opposite side of a jungle gym tile, regular breathing I can usually hear from a few meters away.
---
Insert obligatory "Doing gens, you?"
---
I play on console. I couldn't find a skill check on console, and so I used the "space bar" for it.
---
rank visibility is going away anyway so I doubt matchmaking is much of a concern anymore
---
Day 4 looks fun
---
hol' up
---
I get it these suck but i think it evens out in the end, you get totems like these but then you also get totems hidden in the damn shadowrealm that you couldn’t find even with a rainbow map and small game.
---
I would instantly main Dean
---
I don't care about my Reddit karma lol the only ones right were saying toxic is bad, the rest just are exactly who I was talking about in my OP.  Salty killers who can't hold the L.
---
Only Steam/MS Store on PC
---
I don't think you're fully emotionally stable to handle competition in a continuous sense. You can obviously handle the game and play it to the point where you enjoy it, but constant stimulation seems to be too much for you at this point. Usually those that have some form of diagnosed anxiety syndrome experience this quite a lot, which means competition is a huge turn off for them.
---
You definitely won't, m8.
---
[deleted]
---
Even the best legion in the world is going to struggle to do well against mediocre survivors.
---
Yes. It never came to consoles.
---
That would be a mistake, letting me MAKE one
---
And this is why I find the hex totem and wait until a chase is happening before I destroy it... it adds more excitement to the game and of course the reward of altruism points. "It's ok buddy... I got you... here let me heal you too..."
---
And from then on they're a generator buddy... they don't know the betrayal that came to pass in order to get to this point
---
Because it’s fun.
---
Oh sick the new survivor gets a motorcycle in game that’s super fair and balanced
---
Easy counter to ds: chase the bloody unhooker. FFS he had make your choice, it shoulda been clear what he shoulda done. Plus, he barely utilised his shock. Didn't bring up their insanity, and didn't once successfully utilise it in a chase. He's whinging because he played bad.
---
Ok cool
---
It'll bring you toxic tryhards so you're no longer allowed to have fun, really. There isn't much benefit for anyone not solely concerned with their ego.
---
No I just stood up for someone now your flustered and making stuff up you good there kiddo?😂
---
Skill check fps 2 low for that
---
That's a good point! I'm still rather new, so BP is very precious to me at the moment, haha, so maybe playing with the idea that I'm doing great as long as I get all 4 stacks of BBQ might make the game feel a little more chill to me.
---
on PS4 seems like its good now
---
That's really clever.
---
It’s Jake lol

---
Ah yes back in December when they said there would be an optimization patch for console...
---
Oh my god finally an Ash vs Evil Dead meme ive waited so long
---
There was a graphics update. About it.
---
Yeah, it usually takes me a little time to cool off! It's strange because I'm not even "mad" or whatever - I've definitely had those nights where I'll get a really bad game of LoL or Overwatch right before bed and just like, lay in bed unable to sleep because of how salty I am, lol.  
---
But this is different! Like I said, even after a good game, I can feel anxious and high-strung. Taking some time to listen to chill music and unwind is a good idea, but it's frustrating that the game I'm playing after work or on my lunch break for fun then needs to be "unwound" from lol. Wish I could just like, sit down and play it and enjoy it and just go back to whatever else i need/want to do without the residual negative feeling.
---
ok here me out.   a perk that once per trail you can tackle into the killer to stun them but you yourself are stunned for a second if it hits or not. so if it hits yay you stalled for time but if it misses the killer gets a free hit
---
I need to ask this...
---
What detection perks is Tier 1 Myers ACTUALLY immune to? Cause his tier 1 says he's immune to all detection effects, but then there's perks that say they trump all stealth effects from killers. Which effect wins???
---
Am I missing something?
---
?
---
If a team gets absolutely rolled or they just lose cus of one or two DC's I'll always give the last person hatch as long as I've hooked them once for my BBQ stacks.
---
His name tho
---
I know that feeling 
---
Just focus on getting bp and experimenting with different builds on killers(assuming you don’t have every perk or most perks) and just having fun in general
---
hooks they had left and sacrifice*
---
On Xbox, if you have a bad game, you will not hear the end of it. I've learned to report offensive messages, block them, or ignore them.
---
may as well wait till the patch, see if he gets nerfed.
---
Nah, his pallets fall in such a way that they can be used as ramps. He can then reach places that are un-mindgameable. Also, killer cannot break the ramps because sjw's would take bhvr under fire for being insensitive to handicapped people.
---
You can stop waiting now my child. He has arrived
---
Gratz on Adept, trapper imo was one of the more difficult ones to get adept. Getting iridescent gatekeeper can be tough on trapper because by his like 1-2 or even 3 gens get done by the time you place a few traps.
---
Well they made her basic cosmetic kind of ugly.  but they did her right with the hair clothing and makeup you can add. She was the most  fun to make she’s a fashion icon.
---
Half of my auto aim cuts the lunge short and I miss the person walking in a straight line
---
she tried running lol
---
Finally, a good Baby Yoda meme
---
I love Ash so much
---
Honest question: would a colorblind mode make the game easier for non-colorblind people to spot survivors/killers? Like if I were to use it (not being colorblind) would survivors look different from their surroundings?
---
lol, yea, dealing with toxic survivors is never any fun, but I've played enough ranked LoL over the years to have grown a pretty thick skin when it comes to other players. This feeling I'm getting definitely isn't from just having to deal with toxic buttholes - it's much more anxious / high-strung from the actual experience of the game I think.
---
Who doesn't? Also, happy cake day! :D
---
survivors: 
---
me with Pig at high ranks: :’(
---
How is it useful to know when there’s a survivor ten or fifteen ranks below you in your team, or to be able to identify a SWF in your team? Gee I dunno.
---
I was thinking that You can make both him and another survivor go faster by having the survivor go behind him and push him, if you gain enough speed you can just send him in as a fucking ram.
---
Thanks :D
---
 I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye.
---
They've been taking art direction from GGG I see.
---
Oni comes out the third so might as well wait
---
On Xbox, I almost always get teammates that will willingly get me.

Why do you feel the need to comment on it if you hate it so much?
---
r/okbuddyretard
---
that's exactly what i'm talking about they added a cooldown over her fatigue and kept the chained fatigued over chained blinks
---
huh
---
Is that the plague?
---
He’s immune to all *aura reading* perks in T1. Spinechill and Premonition don’t reveal auras, so Mikey still triggers them.
---
Waits 2 hours for a lobby
---
Error message
---
Rollerblades as new items.
---
If depipping is all you care about Behavior could just put in a safety buffer so if a survivor disconnects the remaining players can’t depip. At worst they remain at the same level.
---
She's my idol
---
Thank you, I've never been able to get someone to explain this too me.
---
Oh ok lol
---
Why would anyone run self-sacrifice? Lose one heaöthstate for 5sec haste. No thnks
---
i enjoyed it the moment i got Tbagged by those guys
---
You have to find that niche yourself.  Like I love playing huntress, and I usually limit myself to only throwing hatchets the entire game.  I usually only get 1 or 2 kills playing this way but to me it’s really fun to do that.  Also I like playing wraith with the add on that doesn’t hide your tr and trying to get surprise hits with it.
---
That's why you 99% it so you can use it to save your teammate before they are hooked. That way you can ensure the killer hates you and will do everything they can to tunnel and camp you after
---
u/kilocityy
---
😭😭😭
---
Imagine watermarking a meme 😂
---
...it goes by rank, not prestige or level...
---
Especially in the basement or against a proxy camper, it’s why I never take it off
---
I don't need to. I just did.
---
Sometimes the killer spawns before the survivors and vice versa, maybe that happened or the games spawn mechanics are fucked.
---
Add "when you sabotage a hook with this toolkit, it stays broken for x seconds longer" Don't know how long it would need to be good though
---
Or "sabotaging a hook with this toolbox doesn't give the killer a noise notification"
---
Stop lying to yourself. ACCEPT YOUR FATE
---
But why?
---
To add to the other explanation: PIP = Point In Progress.
---
Each pip is progress towards ranking up.
---
Really? I'm in fear of that because the frequency will be worse with trigger instead of a button
---
why are the comments so rude? couldn’t be me getting mad for no reason. post what you want.
---
The pestilence known as Instagram is full of scum, villainy, and meme thieves. If I don't watermark my memes, they get stolen with no recognition.
---
Survivors should also get something more than 600 for a dc
---
I know, I was saying I’m happy with it
---
Nothing to see.
---
I was saying it finally did a good job for once
---
PORTUGAL CARALHO
---
I genuinely dont see the problem with others re posting someone else's meme on Instagram, its not illegal and half the time they dont even claim it as their own. Plus if your meme is funny enough to make someone else "steal" it and post it, then I'd take it as a compliment
---
Not that I agree, but the point is that adding new visual options does change the gameplay, which it probably would. Though that being a valid reason to screw colourblind people is another argument.
---
i haven’t played him but by guessing i’d say “i’m all ears” and “discordance” would be good for keeping track of survivors, he really needs it for his power.
---
Do you even know what that sub is for? I feel like you need a special needs subreddit, not the meme one😂 But yeah ending an argument you lost by linking a sub is a total chad move.
---
I’m fine with it since the lower the rank goes the longer it takes to find a game. 
---
also rank doesn’t matter
---
Should just make the character the perk comes from initially have a 4th tier that's better
---
How was that funny
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Yeah, but I dont think changing the colors of auras affects gameplay as much as adding autoaim does. How would adding colorblind options affect gameplay?
---
Switch unbreakable for Spine Chill and you’re set!!
---
Adrenaline activating while you’re in a bear trap
---
Yeah I was thinking something along those lines, but I’m all ears is an incredibly situational perk. It’s not often you see survivors just fast vaulting for no reason.
---
Yeah, I know... How dare your opponent use a strategy to try and win. /s
---
Do you complain when your opponent in Monopoly buys a property? Do you bitch about your opponent making 3-pointers in basketball? I bet you play Street Fighter and complain if they use a Hadouken, right?
---
You don’t get to dictate how another person plays the game. Your opponent is not responsible for your fun.
---
I don’t know, I mean he’s not even proposing anything or asking something, just wishing he had the teachable. Like...okay?
---
They should just force Huntress to have only one hatchet while using Iridescent head
---
I'd say it's not a single perk but a combination of perks. Most annoying one is Ruin + Chili &amp; BBQ..... I can't hit great skill checks every time so if there's a ruin, I go to hunt it. Suppose the killer hangs someone, and there goes your chance as the killer knows where you are, and if you're getting too close to the ruin totem, you're dead. Ruin &amp; Thrill of the Hunt are basically the same. You start working on a totem, boom, you're dead. Kinda annoying.  
---
As a killer, I'd say that Decisive Strike is a bit annoying, but it's also logical in the game so I'm not complaining when someone stabs me after I stabed them. Retribution. But there must be some kind of a perk that allows survivors to take one more hit when they're unhooked, as it happened to me as a killer, and that's annoying when you have players that unhook their teammates a second after you hooked them.... So, if that's a perk, THAT is an annoying perk. Annoying af.
---
I think if they made native teachables be able to be 4th tier. We dont want to give it to everyone and plus that'll make using diffrent charcters useful cause as of now once you unlock the teachables, its just skins
---
I like that idea because once you level up all survivors they basically only have cosmetic differences. It would be like the survivor version of a power
---
How does it not reward bad killers? You have to practically lose the game for it to activate
---
To be somewhat helpful BT is a nice perk.
---
The original image is Spiderman's suit all segmented so I just segmented her (even more than she already is) for the hell of it
---
Survivors pull no punches. I won't pull punches either.
---
It’s not mainly about the boost, it’s about the instant health state recovery.
---
Playing decently = Green or better add ons I guess?
---
Idk man, I just wanted to vent while staying polite...
---
From what I've seen on here, DS along with other perks are quite the controversial topic and I didn't want to display that. I vented for the need because of ridiculous hook saves get me pretty mad. And I'm venting this frustration because of how many games I've had because of the shitty saves and way too much farming. I've even had games where the killer waits right by the hook when another survivor is unhooking so they can hit me immediately... it really sucks.
---
And funny thing is when you tap the gen and that thing pops up when you are running.
---
Like when they run away from you even when it’s obvious there’s no killer around? Hate that.
---
Depends on the platform. On Xbox it's Freddy, Spirit, Ghostface, and Hillbilly
---
I highly, highly doubt it. The shade of red they currently use is, if I recall correctly, explicity called "High Visibility Red" and is chosen because it is viewable my the majority of visually normal people in almost any environment. The problem comes when your cones are very red weak like the cones of most people with Protanomaly/Protanopia are.
---
If you want to test what a full colorblind color scale would do the playability, enable the Protanopia filter bundled with windows 10! In fact, this is the reason I'm on such a crusade about this: I don't WANT a full color filter, it makes the game look jarring and bad. I just want to be able to full utilize the tracking abilities given to me in the game without having to resort to an outside tool like ReShade, Windows 10 Compatibility Features, or nVidia FreeStyle or make the game look like I dropped some particularly bad psychedelics.
---
yeah unless if you are playing on 60fps the red line lags around the circle and it's based on mental clock rather than sight
---
75% of the time when I use ds I don't even get a chance to use it, because I don't get downed/picked up in 60secs. 
---
25% of the time when I get to use it I'm getting camped/tunneled and the killer deserves to get ds'd.
---
Ds isn't op. Ds is only for tunnel/campers that deserve it.
---
How did you make the face?
---
kindred gang
---
I understand, but most of the time I don’t need the recovery. So For me it wastes a slot. 
---
I used to run it when I first started. I hated the meg skin but I prestiged her first only bc of her perks.

As someone who plays spirit a lot, I’ll try to curb their toxicity for ya
---
Then Survivors should get something equal because all that does is give a Killer an easier time to pip.
---
But a solo player can run all kinds of build but a good well rounded one is Exhaustion Perk/Borrowed/Iron Will/Adrenaline.
---
Now from there just specialize based on preference. Swap out Iron Will for Bond if you don't care for being injured long and stealthy. Borrowed can go if you only do safe plays, so Decisive or Unbreakable can take that spot. Adrenaline is powerful but a perk like Kindred or Botany may see more use.
---
Try to look at a wall or somwthing while doing gens, it helps with the frames. Wouldnt recommend it when facing stealth killers, though.
---
Every single Ghost Face I've been up against since the latest rank reset has been a hard camper. I'm rank 7 going on 6 at the moment and still keep ending up with camping Ghost Faces.
---
Making an entire post to call some random hag just trying to have a good time shitty at the viddy game seems kind of extremely ruder my duder
---
I play other games on PC, DbD just got more progress on PS4. But I actually deleted it because it was cramping my style in PC version of DbD
---
Ok so I was playing Nancy once, and this Claudette unhooked me. As soon as I got healed I got insta downed by GF, and the Claudette blocked me. I messaged them because it was really dickish. Later I was playing Spirit for dailies and I saw them again. And I knew. And I camped at the endgame because I get out in the first 5 minutes, you get out while everyone escapes in the endgame
---
it's one of the best comebacks. Like how stupid does one have to be to call someone a noob when they lost to that person.
---
"so you lost to a noob then?"
---
and conversation over.
---
I look forward to hanging out with the Hag for a bit, followed by a year and a half of no contact.
---
What if we get a switch in dbd for NSFW view of models? That would ve nice hehehehehehe
---
Lol all these salty ass quoting killer mains ganging up on you is priceless. I play both roles, and it’s laughable hearing people whine about how the killer gets bullied
---
Am I the only one who thinks Lully at 3 stacks is better than when its mute?
---
Lol, you really said the users of this site owe you great content when you have delivered absolutely nothing. You sound like a clown.
---
yikes
---
Can you send link again, please?
---
Which doesn't solve the problem, because then you get hook/sacrifice points sure, but lose out on Brutality, Deviousness, and Hunter points. That to make up for you have to take the other 3 survivors hostage to fill because the game is now slower without a 4th. On top of that finding, picking up, walking, and hooking an empty husk takes time away from the killer. Which with current gen speed, every second counts for killers.
---
A DC should reward the killer much more, so that the killer is not punished for the dc person. While at the same time - dc's receive a heftier punishment for dc'ing. Like a 20 minute lobby lock.
---
Dont question the gameplay
---
I know this is fake, but like what movie is this from

yep. Killer flair on a subreddit as a proof for toxic killer behavior.
---
That's it guys, I have seen it all
---
spine chill is pretty much useless. it is only seen as useful when playing immersed &amp; spine chill only activates once you can already hear the heartbeat 80% of the time. yeah, it’s cool against stealth killers, but that’s like wanting to run small game because a lot of killers bring hex perks.
---
100% correct on the pallet wasting part. More often than not I see him use shack pallet early on when looping shack, throwing down pallets at jungle gyms before looping them at least 3 times etc.
---
God, quick time Events kill me in any and every game 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
I use a controller on PC and I feel the pain.
---
I didn’t know what to flair it
---
Had to deal with those as well and some other even if carried flash lights.
---
RIP old DS you will Not Be Missed by reasonable players.
---
NoEd is active before I thought hatch
---
Just pc and switch so far.
---
they rotate their camera?
---
And spine chill is a disaster
---
Dafuq are you talking about s brown tool kit repairs faster than a purple?
---
Lmao
---
We also need friends :(
---
I love spirit because she does require more skill than most killers to master and is very fun to play I also love her concept and look and I look forward to continue playing her even after the nerf also I actually enjoy playing with grey add ons on her a lot to make it more fair
---
Sad times we live in
---
f in the chat
---
Ikr :( it’s hard to find people who love the game and don’t get mad and like playing a lot :(
---
*GG EZ lmao uninstall*
---
I agree about the punishment, yet there should be a compensation for the killer once a dc only gives you something around 1.200 bp, not even close to a third hook + sacrifice or memento.
---
&gt;way too many requirements for it to work.
---
Power all gens. That's 1 requirement. If that's too many idk what to say.

Big oof

It wont make anything smooth lol, it will always have more latency than p2p

After spending most of my afternoon waiting for the servers to come up, I had time to really get in a single match before work.  I had a Clown daily and I wanted to complete the "Interrupt a Survivor" rift goal.  So I had a simple plan.  I'd chase down a survivor, get a few gas attacks on him and down him.  Pick him up, hit a generator, and when he started to repair it, pick him up.  Then, I'd just farm or take the game half-seriously.
---
I get Haddonfield map.  Not my first choice, but whatever.  I spot a David crouching down the main street and start to head in his direction.  He is easily half a map away and just starts to run.  I could chase him down, but its early.  I let him have the scare and go for my next target, a Nea.  I get an initial hit.  I loop her a bit on a house where she keeps jumping out onto the balcony and taking the same path each time when I go to chase.  I get her and haul her up to the gen.  I smack the gen three times with my weapon and drop her.  She runs out the window to hide back in that same corner.
---
I just want my Interrupt catch.  I get the idea this Nea just doesn't get what I'm trying to do, so I go back out looking and find the David from earlier.  Smack him.  He tosses every pallet he finds and in about thirty seconds, he's down.  I take him back to his original gen, smack it a few times and drop him.  He starts working on it and I get my interrupt.  Horray!  I decide to reward him by letting him do the gen and drop him back down.  Nope, he just bolts off.
---
Mind you, I'm 6 minutes into this match at this point in time.  I've downed two survivors at different points in time.  I haven't even seen either of the two Claudettes.  Not a SINGLE generator is done.  At this point in time, I wanted to start doing the generators myself so I could get out of there.  Side note:  Every time I ran near that house I encountered the Nea at earlier, she would run right over to that same spot on the balcony and wait to see what I would do.
---
Honestly, I felt like I was in a Demi video.
---
I use the Playstation Platinum headset for PS4. I'm not sure how it compares to other headphones but for me the sound is really good and I have no problem hearing survivors breathing or urban evading thru grass. I don't really use it but the PS4 also has a headset app for them where u can download different EQ's to your headset
---
I'm saying like they should be put into dc lobbies right? Meaning that the killers who would commonly dc should also be paired against them right? But what if they weren't. And they just got put against the people that dont dc like myself and then the whole team just dcs and I not only waste time taking forever to find a lobby but I dont get a rank either and I dont even get to have fun.
---
Like dc lobbies are just a waste of time honestly. Just fucking ban the people. Punish them for real. People who dc commonly just should not be allowed to play.
---
It’s tagged as a rant for a reason.
---
Yeah I agree. Honestly I figured that would be hammered out somehow and the revenge/trying to save someone thing that's kinda a theme would carry it. In the way that the Spirit's dad was the one killing the mom but for a while we only had the spirit as the killer. I just was like "he looks dark, has that revenge thing, there are crows in the game that can be utilized somehow, and with a little sanding and paint it could work." 
---
I think having the girl Sarah, the teen in the movie, years later where she's 25 and is brought into the fog 'sends the crow back to Eric to right the wrong' but the entity tricks him into thinking he must kill to free her and return to the afterlife. Something like that could work. A teaser of some crows from a map and one caws and begins to fly, but doesn't return. 
---
Voiceover from movie "they say a crow carries the spirit from the land of the living to the land of the dead.sometimes, the crow can bring that spirit back, to the right the wrong." Flashes of chaotic footage until you see Dwight look up from a generator and hear 'Victims, aren't we all?' Then the crow logo with a dramatic orchestra hit.
---
Currently I'm leveling up David to get dead hard. And after that I'm doing bill for BT so I can help teamates
---
Honestly, I just wanted to be altruistic and get the Claudette out safe, but couldn't believe I got the Kobe off the hook. 
---
I know that it was just a combination of being extremely lucky and having a low rank Billy, but man I've never felt such a rush! I've played for a while, but know I'm not the best survivor either, so this just made me insanely happy. Hope you all enjoy it :)
---
Also excuse my awful commentary and nasally voice XD
---
Drop Sloppy for Thanatophobia, and that's me. Freddy.

i don’t think killers should be buffed at all. they’re just fine against solo survivors, it’s the toxic 4-man swf that everyone hates.
---
Lol I’m lying now?
---
lol i got banned of his twitch too 😂 just because i said i didnt agree with him about spirit and his mod timed me out :/ so i havent been back since! if you cant even have a discussion in a chat whats the point of being in there?
---
she got her sensitivity on 50% or something lmao
---
It’s not, I play with my friends at red ranks and we don’t sweat at all, more meme builds then anything. It’s normally the lower ranks that try harder to get to red. Whereas casually it’s easy for most
---
Why some people when they failed a ruin skillcheck leave the gen for a couple of seconds?
---
I remember me and my friends got in a really bad spot fucking with a killer. My two friends playing with me are insanely good at the game, but me and my other friend were kind of new. We managed to get out of a camping trappers basement because i took the hit and was extremely frightened to see an unnerving presence ds skillckeck. I hit it and was surprised.
---
Same
---
The nerfs to addons were largely fine and needed, that said what replaced them was garbage. "moderately reduce blink distance for FUCKING BLOODPOINTS" REALLY?
---
What wasn't fine was the cool-down on blinks. This hurts the nurse allot more then people seem to want to acknowledge. For example, let's say your blinking twice towards a far off survivor that you need to interrupt. Could be the last-gen, could be the exit gate.
---
Now lets say you blink twice then fatigue and then blink one more time to try and stop the objective before it gets completed but you come up short by a little distance. Old base nurse would have just blinked again and stopped you. But because of how the blink recharge timer works you won't have that second blink needed to stop the objective and thus you lose.
---
This is just one example but an all to common one , especially on larger maps where you are all but forced to use both of your blinks for mobility. Its a fucked situation you either use 1 blink and move painfully slow through the map because of your horrendous base movement speed. Or you use both to travel around at a decent rate but then you don't have 2 blinks up for the survivor now running away.
---
That said the issue is pretty moot if you main nurse now I guess since there are 2 addons that effectively remove the blink recharge timer its just a fucking shame you have to run those 2 addons every game just to be old base nurse now. But hey if it will shut the fucking survivors up I guess its fine, maybe they can direct their hate at spirit or the oni next.
---
I don’t think she’s really fair, considering she has the best 50/50 in the game. With add ons unbeatable and  just makes me tilted.
---
Cause they really can’t die. Entity wants all of survs hope then toss them away like leftovers on thanksgiving
---
So you’re telling me a killer shouldn’t punish a survivor doing a gen in their face? Sometimes grabs are unavoidable as well. You can try to hit but sometimes the game registers it as a grab.
---
You play on pc?
---
Purposefully going out of your way to go after trapped survivors instead of ones doing gens is a bad idea for you as killer and it's not fun for the survivors. But if you come across a survivor with a bear trap on, there is literally no reason not to get an easy down and hook (because they usually don't heal), especially if you have perks that activate with hooks. The RBT's aren't there to kill them, they're there to waste their time and leave them vulnerable in the open. You're harming your chances of winning by not taking that opportunity to get a survivor closer to being sacrificed just because they have a party hat on that they'd get off in 30 seconds anyway.
---
Punishment: for every dc, ur teammates must do another gen/ lose a rank for good.
---
Yeah
---
The ptb is so bad rn
---
adrenaline = must be injured, downed or on hook. survivors must be doing generators while this is happening. 
---
self care = you have to win a chase.
---
I love the fact that ghostface is entp, such a joker...just like me
---
They should be scared to get hooked and taken out of the game though. I’m a red rank survivor lol
---
I did 3/4 and 1 DCd and it didn't count.
---
So this killers power is basically the demo Gorgons power but he can crouch and still have a 10 meter terror radius instead of making portals
---
The original picture was going to be a caveman beating a rock to make a wheel, but this worked just as well. The only game I rely on to play is dbd without it, It sent me back to the Monkey era.
---
The whole chapter was like 7 dollars lol
---
We like memes here. 🤷‍♂️
---
Just played for 2 hours and a half and literally only got 1 pass level while I was doing the challenges too. How exactly is this fair? What am I doing wrong?
---
Why lithe? Seems like an obscure perk that not many people use.
---
thats not a problem with DS then. thats a problem with the game.
---
Punishing them would be lunging and downing em. or if its early in the game, just eat the DS
---
It's times like these that I'm glad I'm a killer main. Great editing my dude.
---
There are so many times I'd like to run without BBQ, but with the extra blood points it's hard to justify. Even burning through my Black Wards, I run out of essential addons that aren't even OP. Spending on other killers and survivors that I'm trying to bring up to snuff dries out my main.
---
If the +25% of BBQ were baseline, then I'd essentially have five perks. The aura reading of BBQ is occasionally nice, but I run it solely because I want to keep the hate train going. I wouldn't _need_ a fifth perk at that point, and I think we'd see more variability in the average killer build.
---
Plot twist he has borrowed time and stacked mettle
---
I picked Steve bc I have loved stranger things since season 1 came out and honestly our personalities are kinda similar, plus I needed to move on from being a Claudette main yikes
---
Idk I don't use wraith, just had to have a way to bully his tiny feet
---
Int DC =5k bp
---
I feel like other survivors that stay in the game after a rage quitting teammate should get a good-sport bp bonus based on how many left since they are already crippled really badly by losing somebody.
---
dead hard is good after you get saved because you can use it immediately if the killer is there. you can also try deliverance if your teammates can’t come for the save. borrowed time is godly
---
I saw a post about someone getting stuck on that pallet earlier this week and Monto did too. I guess that pallet is glitchy for both sides
---
I live by the gamer rule
---
Yeah, he's about the weakest killer in the game without good add ons now.
---
I was somehow glad too, so managed to play BFV and Subnautica and it was very fun haha
---
I mean she literally is fair as it is entirely skill based to phase and find people especially with no collision now but alright? It isn’t like she goes through the walls when chasing people either she has to deal with loops just like every other killer. Plus her op add ons were balanced
---
It 100000% affects gameplay. Visibility is a huge part of balance in DbD.
---
Stupid question but what do I need to change in order to achieve that ? The left/right keys in movement ? 'Cause I often use them, and I couldn't find any bindings for just the strugle state
---
yeahhhh...I don’t think so. maybe on low tier killers like legion or doc but that shit ain’t gonna fly on a spirit nurse or Freddy. they just need to rework the low tier killers honestly
---
That wasn't me talkin about that. I'm a killer main, I know what you're talking about, DCs are fuckin awful.
---
My opinion, it's not OP, but it is a crutch.
---
Hmmm. That sucks.
---
I understood THAT reference
---
is there no dbd community type thing on PC? I found my good dbd friends through the PS4 dbd community, maybe you could try looking for a similar version of that and ask people to play?
---
This post is literally just "I'm defending the fact that I play a top tier killer and use a perk that pushes him further beyond top tier."
---
Like, bruh. Just play what you want and fuck what others think. If you want to be toxic and insidious camp basement as Bubba then do so. Is it bullshit? Of course. Is it against the rules? Fuck no. Your goal as killer is to worry about your victory and your fun. Same when you play survivor. The other person is playing how they want to play and if someone doesn't like it then fuck them.
---
I was for real thinking that combo... pretty killer
---
??? Why would you say that?
---
A P2P is only better for the host (killer). Never for the survivor.
---
sir this is a wendy's
---
You just started playing or? How many hours?
---
Am I the only one in the world that doesn’t get frame drops at all when playing this game? I’m on console too.
---
It's not supposed not be a crutch, more like an insurance policy but unfortunately people use it as a crutch
---
Yep you have as long as possible to do them, it’s just the shards you get with them go to whichever rift is open at the time you unlock them
---
Lmao, how long did the match end up taking? And did you eventually get bored and kill them or did you keep farming?
---
more info
---
But even then itll be tracking blood and scratch-marks.... which all decent killer mains can do pretty easily.
---
that would be cool but I wouldn’t wanna see the same 4 survivors all the time just like we’re seeing the same 4 killers all the time
---
Happens every fuckin time I run Thrill. I just straight up wanna DC. Sounds like world war 17 in my ear drums
---
Most survivors aren't smart. At all. So when BHVR nerfs something for Survivors, the 90% of players who are bad get punished instead of the 10% who will ALWAYS be amazing at the game.
---
The game won't last like this forever. Something NEEDS to be done
---
I love playing Plague and she’s also my personality type? This is witchcraft
---
I don't think the game should be balanced around DC's, I think the husks and the escalating matchmaking bans should be enough. Once those are both implemented I'm sure the problem will get better, and I won't be quite so frustrated when it does inevitably happen.
---
There should be a bind just for struggling. Are you on pc?

Edit: there’s 100% still issues. Actually got into a game and we were all disconnected about 2-4 mins in. Said I didn’t have an internet connection which I definitely do. Grr...
---
Children angry about the return to school maybe?
---
NOED is like C tier honestly. At the lower ranks it’s very strong but at the higher ranks it’s meh. A lot of people whine about it but if you don’t like it just cleanse totems
---
Well if they’re on perks, it would come down to preference. It would old un-diversify at higher ranks because meta.
---
Don't know if I'm reading this comment right but basically I don't think 2 perks that revolve around all gens being done should activate just because the hatch is closed.
---
 If not all gens were powered then you shouldn't get a free health state or free instadowns.
---
When I play killer I feel like I get a toxic survivor every 5 games or so, so it's like 1/20 survivors is toxic towards me. I'm sure it depends on many things like rank and playstyle.
---
it’s not op, just annoying because it is often used by killers who otherwise could not have gotten the kill.
---
I usually get to rank 1 solo and my usual 3 perks are Iron Will / DS / Balanced Landing. Maybe switch BL with DH after the nerf. Iron Will let’s you make some tricky mind games in chases and since your solo you might not get healed as much. 
---
4th perk is a flex pick. Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Bond, Deliverance Unbreakable are all good.
---
That’s true.
---
theyre angry that they didnt get to play the game all day til the evening. set messages to friends only

---
Technically every perk in the game is a crutch.
---
NOED counters adrenaline and gen rush. There are sometimes games where you just lose regardless of how you played. You (with low tier killer) will almost always lose against teams that focus on gens. So with NOED, you can just snowball and slug everybody. Sounds unfun but hey, DBD is balanced
---
It fixes the unique problem that YOU have
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Maybe not OP just very poorly designed. I think a way to fix it would be that for every time you hook a survivor, you get a token, and when the gates are powered, you can 1 hit down survivors but every hit you lose 2 tokens, once you’re out of tokens you lose the one hit down capability. That way it stops rewarding bad gameplay, if you played bad, you don’t get much use out of it.
---
Survivors dcing should never punish the killer, and even with husks it still will. This problem is among the many that are pushing killers away and soon we won't have any left.
---
That's like deciding rules for professional football based on a toddlers league.
---
I have like 378 hours I think
---
Feels bad man. On another note, is it possible to dead hard to temp avoid getting killed by endgame, or is that just for RBT’s?
---
I get why people feel Bamboozle is somehow wrong - you get to a window and it doesn't respond, as if the game were broken. And we've all seen it _actually_ broken, like the bus windows on Autohaven used to be. You feel cheated, and one of your major tools is taken away unexpectedly.
---
But if they try to take it out on you, that just means the perk did precisely what it was supposed to. They're just handling the surprise poorly.
---
I thought about turning it into a 4k.  I wasn't sure if I had hit my 4 bottle hits for my daily so I decided to torment a claudette.  I ended up hooking everyone once and kicking gens as I found them.  Then, when it got close to the end, I went near one of the doors to spook someone with my No-Ed.  Turns out the claudettes had been busy cleansing every totem they could find.  It just took them 10 minutes to find the lit totem in the open.
---
They all escaped and I kept it that way on purpose.  If it had been any map but Haddonfield, I probably would have just tried for a 4k.  I lacked the detection perks I needed for Haddonfield.

---
Actually noed counters adrenaline lol
---
Mommy Myers? Is...Is that you?
---
I just mean that they aren't going to be scared of hearing the heart beats/get scared when they see the killer coming towards them.
---
They're just going to say ok lets see how long I can stay up.
---
I don’t read their messages so they’re all just a bloodstain on the ground to me now.
---
Your altruism was rewarded lol
---
Karma Whoring is a problem, period. If you think Karma Whoring is okay, then you're out of your depths.
---
When a new cosmetic comes out you see more of them for a good month
---
Bamboozle billy above top tier hahahaha.
---
i almost feel like people would prefer it be a totem perk over this.
---
He used to immune to spine chill too, but they traded that out for 0 terror radius
---
Thanks, your reply makes it all worth it.  People love to read in too much or generalize to make themselves feel better.  I'm not defending even myself here, my gg bb is toxic, but the replies say more than any reply I could make ever would.
---
Does that mean you can rejoin the game after disconnecting
---
Everyone likes memes, but this isn't just about memes, it's about that fact that this Sub is only memes, and there's blatant Karma Whoring.
---
Then apply to be a mod here. 🤷‍♂️
---
you are absolutely right
---
Adrenaline 4- surge of adrenaline grants super human strength, causes exposed effect on killer for remainder of the game. "Whose the bitch now"
---
I love this
---
thankyou!
---
If you play too well you get punished as well, the wiki lists all the requirements for pipping on the medals page
---
https://discord.gg/kMF4TX
---
I run dead hard (no balanced because it's not always useful) decisive strike, empathy and borrowed time. Probably not meta though
---
And when a killers DCs after a green rush survivors should get Max farm and escape
---
yup! Thankyou! :))
---
 noed confirmed
---
That's a good thing, survivors should not be able to exploit the game by dcing and robbing the killer of using their perks by dcing before being hooked.
---
Ditto
---
I like reading their messages just to see how much they try to swear at you lol. It's kinda funny.
---
Yeah I'm on Windows 10, and I can't find the struggling bind... Maybe it's because I play in French ? I don't think so but eh... We never know
---
Because I'm sick of seeing good cosplay that takes a lot of time and effort be ignored for any generic gamer girl who dresses as Susie
---
Yes, you can't blink through object's if you use the 3rd blink add-on. But I should test this with bamboozle, should bring some confusion haha
---
The consensus here is it's totally fair. While it is effective at making you a hard to beat killer it doesnt stop you from being a asshole. I dont care for it and I dont really do it. If I see someone that just got unhooked I will slug them but not rehook because it's just common decency.
---
So wait or no?? This answer confuses me sorry
---
i play as survivor but my boyfriend plays as killer and he doesn't focus on just one person. if someone is unhooked he usually goes for the player that unhooked them rather than the player who got hooked because he sees how frustrated i get when i get tunnelled lmaoo
---
i mean i play on pc, and the thing is that unless if you are getting a consistently high framerate the skill checks get weird. my build generally stays around 45-70 fps so experience weird skill checks every now and then. consoles also generally play more consistently historically.
---
It will be implemented early 2028
---
Sometimes it's the right move. A good team will punish this. Borrowed time, decisive strike, sprint burst off the hook etc.
---
My rank 1 girlfriend got called a baby killer unironically because her game ended in 5 minutes while playing Naked Wraith. Lol.
---
To be fair, PC servers kinda fucked stalking
---
But you'd be much better off running something better that will help you make those seconds last longer wouldn't you think?  Sloppy, Thana, DL, and more
---
lol you think "bamboozle pushes him further beyond top tier"? Like c'mon lol
---
So... When you make a killer quit you should get the points you have accrued. It's kind of shitty.

I never tunnel (well very very rarely intentionally) but if I come across you on a box trying to take the mask off I'm not going to just ignore you. Unless you're Dwight/David. I play favorites.
---
Nope, they get beaten(bullied) for the 1 in 20 games they played and only remember that. Whenever I play killer I rarely even see anyone chat.
---
Honestly, I love the salt makes me laugh that they felt so strongly about losing they felt the absolute and dire need to go through the xbox menus to message me saying I suck as I get a 3-4k game (depending on how I'm feeling about the last survivor I give hatch every so often). A d it's usually the ones that think they are monto or no0b3 god tier survivors.

I play both sides, so I wouldn't consider myself a killer main, but I 100% prefer playing killer. I rarely tunnel, the only time I really do is when I can't find the guy who did the rescue, or when the unhooked guy is playing stupid and runs into me. If the guy gets unhooked and genuinely tries to escape, I usually let him go, but not without hooking his rescuer, lol.
---
*tormented the tormenter* *plus 2000 BPs*
---
Is this game even released on mobile yet?
---
It looks like his mom is yelling at him after he just did something he thought was funny
---
Hard same! I collided with a survivor once, and didn't even realised it until post phase
---
It says Get Decisive Striked bitch
---
Opening the gate isn't a DC bro, and you know the difference.  Don't change my words to make others feel better about DC to screw over people outplaying them.
---
Ive gotten smiley laugh faces, gg bb, lol get wrecked from killers before.  You sure you speak for everyone?
---
Myers became a kangaroo
---
What the fuck does any of this mean?? 😂
---
I also dont have an issue with noed. I play both sides equally. Ruin gets annoying but if you use it you use it. Noed makes the game more cringey for sure but that's what makes it fun. My heart races when im trynna save my friends off the hook and the killer has noed. Makes me feel like im really bout to die 🤣
---
Gg bb whiny killer mains.
---
I play a lot of both survivor and killer. Tunneling is generally a shitty thing to do but it depends on how you define it which is where a lot of disagreement comes in. It should just refer to when you consistently, in every interaction where you can choose between survivors, pick the same one every time and tunnel them down til they are dead to the exclusion of everyone else. Doing it as killer sometimes makes sense, but not always. I think a lot of newer killers do it because they struggle to secure kills, but some seem to do it specifically to be toxic. 
---
Strategically it sometimes makes sense as a killer to soft tunnel someone, like you don’t want to be mean and keep going after them but sometimes turning and leaving them in a chase is you making the choice to be nice instead of catching them and hooking them after say a teammate makes an unsafe save but then takes off and is harder to find. Or the unhooked person stays right around the hook self caring or whatever and is the only one to be found. Sometimes it makes sense to tunnel someone who is injured who was way more difficult to catch than the other survivors or tunnel Object of Obsession users. 
---
There’s a ton of different examples I could give I guess and I am sure some will see these answers as toxic play but I’ve kind of stoped playing as nice because when I am killer I get so much toxic bullshit in my inbox regardless of how I play, and survivors are sweaty every single trial that I am now playing optimally as possible which sometimes means somewhat tunneling someone. This game is less about mechanical skill than it is decision making in terms of being good at it until you reach the lowest ranks. Killers are sometimes expected to make bad decisions so that survivors can have a fun game, which I don’t agree with but is also a huge point of contention in the community. 
---
Sometimes we tunnel when someone is being toxic towards us. I mean if you drop pallets on me and blind me after that’s fair play. But if you run around behind me clocking your flashlight, you drop a pallet and teabag me etc you clearly want some extra special attention and I am happy to give it to you. I will tunnel players who sandbag their teammates, farm their teammates etc. Then I will usually let the others go! There’s a ton of ways for survivors to counter tunneling but if a killer is being a total dick and truly tunneling someone even those tools like DS and BT only get you so far.
---
I like it.
---
No he said it was cause the rank system actually matched all green players together. I just assumed he was being sarcastic about something cause posts like this almost always are when it's "Thank you ranking system, very cool!"
---
creeping in post history - this drawing is gorgeous :) best boy Frank
---
When the surv is baby, when is my friend and when the surv is Just Nice dont tbag dont do anything tóxic Just play the game, when the player is not tóxic and is a good surv too, im a Nice killer when i end the match fast (slug  them all lol) i let they Farm some points and kill them again ;)
---
If the killer DCs then they couldn't handle the neutron style
---
I didn't even mind them getting the hatch tbh it's why I was getting the pallet but they gotta do me like that
---
There is an option to hide post game chat. Most people don't know this so there you have it. People will always talk shit, even if you play "fair".
---
I have Jane she’s pretty ight, head on is pretty nice to have
---
I mostly play survivor so I’ll just say, please:
---
If you’re killing someone on back to back hooks at the beginning of the game and they don’t get to play at all that round it really, really sucks. There’s no need for it. Don’t punish the victim when a trolling survivor farms them. Kill the troll with extreme prejudice!
---
How old are you?
---
Must've just got disconnected then 😣
---
I lost my add ons and offerings too! I wasn’t playing Huntress though
---

---
Well you are also a new killer and you may be playing like an asshole and not even realizing it. If you are hard tunneling people and camping them you’re going to get a lot of hate for it.
---
Oh lord, Claudette and Quentin are in my group.

---
Are you serious? You think that 3.5 BILLION people play dead by daylight?
---
Me as david tbh
---
Wouldn't one issue be trolling killers then? I imagine sometimes survivors dc because they feel they are getting trolled / just straight up having a bad time yo. The balancing comes in making sure Killers never WANT survivors to DC. 
---
3 hooks and a sacrifice would be enough to cover it while not making it beneficial to the killer, a middle ground where no one is happy about it but you dont feel like you've been kicked in the gut.
---
Edit: I should add that I'm a killer main, and have never really understood DC's, but I've assumed above that not 100% of everyone DC-ing is an overgrown manbaby
---
That's how it should be. Skill should matter that's balance.

I agree, there are tons of perks, and the majority of those are more or less useless as unfortunate as that is. The more they add characters, the more of these there will be. It would definitely be a nice thing to be able to toggle off certain ones, in the future if anything.

I bought the clown cosmetics and started playing him. Sometimes I get 4K sometimes I get zero. Red ranks btw. And I realise that clown’s performance is kinda dependent on the map and duration of gameplay. (Which killer isn’t LOL) but I wanna say that when dealing with jungle gyms and looping the survivors, I can catch up easily and down them more effectively than when I’m playing ghost face and huntress (my other two main apart from spirit). But when it comes to patrolling gens and applying map pressure, I find it a lot harder. Survivors gets alerted easily by the puff of smoke and screams by their friend and move away to the other side of the map. So when the map gets bigger such as red forest, I just can’t get gens to stop popping. I’m not using the pinky btw, so nobody is actually teabagging me. All in all, I think clown is actually better than the other so called low tier killer but if it’s reloading speed or bottle count can be buffed I’ll have a lot easier time to walk around the map (cuz right now the reloading is kinda slow). I can’t think of other creative ways to buff clown ~ be glad to listen to your suggestions.

I think if they made him look a little bit more exhausted from the running, it would excuse his speed. I've seen some LARGE fella's walk and run at some incredible speeds. (Not really fat per say, but they were fit back in the day and they chose to drink beer for 10 years after.)
---
What originally made it good was a bug where any hit granted a token but then that got fixed, and borrowed was originally *I think* any unhook granted the endurance effect instead of being inside killer terror radius
---
They way it works is that no matter how bad they did they will tbag and trash talk. I really wish i got matched with the same people so i can play dirty the next match instead of being all nice and just remove them from existence in a few minutes
---
People gotta stop being silly then
---
Mettle is harder to proc and idk about borrowed. Its just as annoying as it always has been
---
Well what i mean is that games in general should be balanced around optimal play because taking low level play into account doesnt make any sense. If someone playing at low level thinks that something is overpowered because they dont know or dont have the skill required to implement the counter, that thing shouldnt be nerfed, that player should be expected to either continue to lose to it or be able to, through practice and learning, reach a level of skill where they can access that counter. The important thing is that the counter exists and is reasonable. Killers do better against nonSWFs because the nonSWF is more likely to play less optimally. Thats not the killer’s fault. If that team of randos are all skilled and play optimally they have essentially the same tools as a SWF. Its not the killer’s fault that they dont utilize those tools to their maximum potential.
---
true but also oversaturated content
---
From that perspective, it would make sense to down and hook someone trying to get their trap off. I choose not to play that way as I wouldn't like being targeted like that myself. Might sound cheesy, but I think the "treat others the way you want to be treated" can apply here. I'd rather everyone in the match have fun than getting my hundredth 4k.

Had like 3 killers dc so far in the past 2 hours and I’m not sure if they’re genuine or not on PS4
---
I wish BHVR would slap an obnoxious UNSAFE UNHOOK across the screen when people pull this crap while being chased themselves and you get hit by the killer (*because why wouldn’t the killer hit the injured person put right in front of them*). I know they punish your earned points already but that doesn’t seem to stop people from doing it anyway
---
You new here or something? SWFs now join lobbies based on the highest level in the group. People that have rank 1 friends join rank 1 killers.
---
Well they weren't kidding about matches taking a minute
---
Exactly why I thought of it!
---
Why should the killer be upset or punished when an opponent DC's? And what do you mean "trolling" killers? The Killer is not on your team, or a team intended to aid you. It's also not their job to make the game fun for you. If they are doong things that constitutes as trolling, only throws the game for themselves as well. While Survivors have so much versatility to counter anything a killer can dish to them right now. Though I am speaking from a high ranking perspective, which any game should be balanced around higher ranks where players are using skill to the highest potential.

---
Regardless of what anyone says it is a unskilled way to play if you can even call it playing. They might not be responsible for my fun but they are for there's and people do dc all the time bc of this stupid unskilled strategy. Its very unsportsmanlike and should be reported.
---
I have to respectfully disagree, as somebody who plays both sides. DS can be useful against tunneling killers, but there are many scenarios where it’s used as a get out of jail free card. 60 seconds is a lot of time, and if you go for the unhooker and hook them, you can *still* get hit by the last guy’s DS. 
---
I don’t think DS is insanely OP, but I think it needs a small change to make it a true anti-tunneling perk.
---
Also it’s very sad that there are 7 downvotes on my comment yet only one person tries to argue their stance. But I’m not surprised considering how pathetic this sub is.
---
Lmaoooo what if they introduced a stun like legions when hes been running so long😂
---
The cooldown simply doesn't make sense, lets look at Trapper for a moment.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
He can step on his own traps and get "stunned" momentarily, survivors can disable traps, survivors can "destroy" traps, and survivors can use abilities such as deadhard to counter traps (which is fair) but then the TRAPPER is being countered by his own ability.
---
That's dogshit. **Hot dogshit.** He's one of the few killers where their ability is more often than not, a weakness. Why not make him immune to his traps, have the escape for the survivors not be RNG based, and give him some sort of ability to fuck with pallets/windows? He's a TRAPPER who cant TRAP! 
---
Back to clown. Clown has a weakness in an area he doesn't need. He has to manually reload his bottles eventually and the most depressing part is theres a lot of "deadzones" where if you throw a bottle (or a hatchet) you'll hit an invisible wall and it breaks.
---
If you want to give him some sort of weakness, that would be in an area that is NOT in the chase. Like map pressure. If he lacked map pressure then it would balance ou-... oh wait. He's missing map pressure. So he has two weaknesses. 
---
Why? Why do you hate me game?
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
yeah annoying right?
---
Damn, it was always kind of good to know if you were being teamed with a baby Nancy lol
---
Lighten up jake
---
Imagine fixing the game instead of just slapping bandaids on everything.
---
The douchebag of DBD
---
I would say 5th perk is not necessary, but I want perks such as Shadowborn and BBQ as built-in features. Killers deserve higher FOV.
---
Don't que up if you are going to just DC if you aren't having a good time or feel you are being trolled. It's incredibly selfish because you just put your enjoyment first and trolled/ensured everyone else in the lobby is going to have a poor time
---
Adrenaline cuz when I slug 2 people and poof they stand up .
---
Noed , I usually cleanse all the totems in the map .
---
Yeah, it's not very fair, you can still absolutely destroy as no perk survivor but killers are very perk dependent, you don't really need any of the survivor perks to do well, you can still do gens and loop the killer. Let's also remember that there are four survivors, so one survivor doing a full meme build with bad perks is the killer equivalent of just using one meme perk.
---
Nah
---
Ah yes it seems I am a bug dumbo... that's what I get for using mobile...
---
I'll keep it there just so I can use it as a phrase though :)
---
Woosh
---
Balanced is better than dead hard because it can create infinites.
---
BT used to last longer and didn't require the hit survivor to mend afterwards.
---
Adrenaline , cuz it’s kinda stupid when a slugged person gets picked up from the perk I’ve had times where I had slugged 2 people and they got picked up before I could pick them up.its the same side for Noed but it’s a really controversial topic
---
You don't need any perks to play well as survivor. The meta survivor perks just help with second chances, they arent so... mandatory (maybe DS for solo que but you get what I mean)
---
^ yeah now I remember thats right
---
I had a game yesterday against a rank 4 spirit. She had ruin, pop, strider, and bbq. From the start of the game she camped. (Not facecamped but never let anyone get close) nobody was toxic we didn’t all run around the hook. Eventually one brave soul unhooked the hooked survivor after phase with bt. She proceeded to tunnel the hooked survivor but he got pallet saved. She then found me downed me after a minute chase. And FACE camped me. She was angry. Team did the last gen and opened the door next to me. I managed to get saved and as soon as we ran out the door she dcd. Moral of the story even spirit players can be toxic as hell.
---
you just spawned in late cause those two are crouching and hiding from the guy
---
Also sorry for gif not video, I screamed "oh my god" after I saved and I sounded like the girl from the Exorcist
---

I always find this memes ironically hilarious because no one can agree on what the "generic meta killer build" it's always something different, it's almost as if theres more variety than people think.
---

What’s the buff
---
Yea but only if you get the right map. I ran it hardcore for a while and most games it was a dead perk. Dead hard is always useful if you use it right
---
Wrong

Getting DC’ed while playing killer in game. I lose a PIP as well. WTF

I'm getting "Party Creating Failed" when I try to play as survivor... \[edit\] I'm on PS4
---
I tried killer today on ps4 and got kicked out 2-3 times. Once I got stuck in the 5seconds screen forever and had to restart
---
I mean if you don’t care about bloody cosmetics there’s no reason to prestige
---
I mean DC's are always going to be an issue. It's a problem inherent with an asymmetrical game. It can't be avoided. The game is balanced around 1 killer and 4 survivors, so when someone DC's it's gonna screw shit up no matter what. You can't really fairly salvage the game when it happens, you can just deter it (matchmaking bans) and try to make it less annoying for both sides. The husk will basically change a DC into someone killing themselves on hook (better for killer than a DC) but the killer will have to spend a little time to do it (which helps remaining survivors a bit). As a killer main, this seems fair to me, and is much better than the current "DC to give your friend hatch" bullshit and ragequitting in general.
---
Prestiging is really up to you. The only thing you gain is bloody cosmetics. And the more killers you get up there the bloodwebs get flooded. 
---
I prestiged my Detective Tapp and I've been 50 for a long time and there's still perks I used to have that I dont any more.  Im definitely not prestiging anymore people at all.
---
Same here

I just now got this error, can the devs ever fix there servers?
---
Some dont know any better and some feel it's the only way until they see the light.

I’m also currently unable to log in on PS4...

Yeah I just got kicked all the way out and now I can’t connect to the game
---
As a survivor main this was fun to watch lol
---
Yea same here. Ps4 NA
---
Just got dc'd as killer on PS4.
---
If you are to prestige, its better to have over 900k bp so you can get some perks first...I got al characters to 40 for the teachables, but now im aiming for P3s. So far I got Billy, Doctor and Dwight P3 and going for Bill P3
---
Same for me and the Ahoy Boy
---
Already said to someone else who commented
---
And it went back down. I got error code :8,018 on ps4
---
Just checked twitter for other people’s responses and yup.. looks like they’re down again. Just my luck after barely getting on to play
---
Its not worth it to prestige anyone but if you want to show how much yoube played that character or as a survivor if you want to max out a main that would pretty much be the only reason to do it. If youre cool with not having the prestige cosmetics then save your blood points to get all the perks on your killers.
---
Same issue here
---
I can’t even create a lobby to play a game
---
Yeah it was my first availability to play in weeks xD

Prove Thyself, Better Together, Leader, Empathy

Freddy is a good pick that’s kind of who I main. I have played GF as well but as soon as you get out of potato ranks it’s much harder to stalk with him. It seems like some higher skill players use his ability more like a survivor finder than they do to actually get a good stalk on someone.

---
A good Head on build really needs quick and quiet. I would use Bond, DS, unbreakable, Inner strength, dance with me, or spine chill any combo of those but its ok to have backup exhaustion in case you need to Ive used Balance and Dead Hard and lithe with head on and you can until you get used to head on. Lithe and quick and quiet is nice to have but you wont really need it with head on. You can throw a pallet and jump in locker while killer breaks the pallet. Its best to slow the killer down so you dont get caught jumping in a locker and dont forget the quick and quiet timer when jumping in locker unless you wanna bait the killer to you
---
I use Bond/Empathy, Deadhard/Head-on, Borrowed Time, We'll make it/Prove Thyself
---
Yup. Down again for me
---
He is way better than bubba. With billy you can pressure the gens really well using the speed of the chainsaw, And you can punish survivors with a one hit down. Bubba is horrible in comparison.
---
Me too, not a good look.
---
I prestige the ones I play a lot as and want cosmetics. The hatchet for huntress is actually cool and migh th be kne of the few cosmetics for killer worthy prestiging since u can actually see the weapon yourself
---
But then that makes his ability mostly useless
---
What episode? It’s hard for me to get into the show. The horrible cgi,and Corniness,bad writing etc hold be back.
---
But then people say you need to like the og evil dead films to like the show. But still. I expected a monster hunting show with a quirky guy not scy-fu channel trash
---
Thantaphobia, nurses, ruin and sloppy. You dont only use your night shroud to sneak up on survivors not to stalk.
---
\[on ps4\] Getting "error code: 8,017"
---
Bro he is 1000 times better than bubba, bubba is the worst killer in the game billy is one of the best. You just don’t see him often because people got sick of playing over the past few years. The reason bubba is trash is because he has no map pressure, billy provides a shit ton of map pressure lol
---
I don't even cuss people on Xbox and I think I have a total of 7 bans. It's not too bad considering I've had my Xbox for like 4-5 years. I think my bans were more for what they interpret as trolling.
---
If its forever freddy or prayer beads spirit im dcing as soon as i find out.  No one in that lobby was going to have fun anyways.
---
Tbh at this point I use NOED to punish genrushers who don’t do totems and any Survivors who make a mistake, but are protected by their perks such as DS or Adrenaline. It’s ridiculous how much survivors can get away with when they know they are invisible with some of their perks. They will fix a gen under your nose, make ballsy plays or unhooks and none of that matters cuz *stabby stabby*. I literally had games where everyone was hooked twice but because of DS I couldn’t do shit and by that time the gates are already powered. So I whip out my NOED.
---
The update is December 3rd
---
Same here😕
---
If you use surveillance you can teleport to gens as soon as survivors get back on them
---
If you use make your choice you can expose someone and then tele over and slap em down
---
His addons slow the survivors down a lot, so adding on ruin and thanatophobia make it take forever to do anything.
---
Replace thrilling with sloppy and you’re there, don’t stalk. Just use the 0 terror radius to be a sneaky mofo
---
I wish I could tell you, but I'm in your exact situation, first episode had me wondering how old this series was. However, it does kinda grow on you, definitely took awhile though, but I'm only on episode 4? Maybe 5? So I have no clue lmao
---
Hmm I might try out Billy but at the same time the new killer is almost like Billy but he needs blood to use his insta knock
---
You look great!
---
What now?
---
Well, we can't all bring Toolboxes.
---
Imo I don't like nurses because of how small the range is, why do ppl say it's so good?
---
Nah dude wtf. Be nice? My job is to kill you. I don't owe you anything for being a survivor. I'm not saying face camp or tunnel but I'm not running 50 miles away from my hook just so you can go to the other side of the map and heal. If they get unhooked I'm coming back and going after whoever i see first. Be it them or the savior. Of course as the killer your allowed to choose to tunnel or not in that situation and don't let anyone ever tell you how to play.
---
"i disagree with you which means you have no idea what you are talking about and have never played killer"
---
I love it when people say this. i have been told that like 40 times on this reddit. Im a rank one Billy, huntress, and wraith. but thanks.
---
If a survivor comes to heal em, that means there are 3 people not doing gens. Its an anti tunnel perk, thats all it is. you get rid of it at the start. or you slug. Camp the body if you want 2. It shouldnt be hard to just slug and go to another person.
---
what you suggested would honestly make the perk so much worse, it would make the perk last forever, imagine someone just following you with a flashlight and DS up, forcing you to chase them while you try to chase someone else. They can extend the chase easily and then you would have to wait 60 secs just to be able to hook em. and if they have unbreakable, you lost the game.
---
Really nice!
---
Got it thanks for the help
---
Thank you!
---
Because you get the noise part way through the skillcheck and it’s more off putting than no noise at all
---
Now this is a quality meme.
---
&gt;Back
---
Fair point, but I've found you get terrible spawns like this one way more often than good ones.
---
Are you sure they are back yet? Games still taking forever for survivor cues and i disabled cross play
---
Laurie too

Error Code 8,018 on Ps4
---
Today has been rough so far
---
EDIT: It seems like it's working again. Currently in solo queue
---
EDIT2: Got booted off again at 1 gen left, that's it for me for now
---
I'm only going to be nice if the person cooperates. Like example was yesterday I played a hag game and was trying to do the interrupt and grab challenge. And I didnt have any luck. Final guy and I close the hatch. Find him and I lead him to a pallet and hit it to tell him to drop it, he does and then I hit it again to tell him to jump over it. He foes I grab him and then I carry him to the door and I let him out.
---
But if your a person that's just sitting there buttdancing and shit I'm not gonna show mercy
---
Yes. If the killer is a filthy camper or tunneler, I message that.
---
Well. Probably because the past is meaningless in terms of the entity's playground. Life and death mean nothing so someone as old as time could play its game. But the future Isnt something that i think could be manipulated. 
---
But who's to say that the entity even exists in now. Why cant it exist 1000 years in the future.
---
I don't get why nurses is so good. it's range is so small and when people are healing, I'm chasing someone else nowhere near them
---
Its the community not you. Many survivors will call you bad because you won. My honest advice is to stop giving a fuck about what anyone thinks. If you wanna run Prayer Beads Spirit with NOED then do it. 
---
You could use 0 perks, 0 addons, 0 offerings, kill all 4 survivors, no camping, no tunneling, using the worst killer (legion or leatherface tbh) and people will STILL call you bad.  They’ll probably call you trash for even deciding to play Legion or Leatherface lol.  
---
I’ve slugged all survivors using only hatchets as huntress and got a 4k and I got called bad. I got a 4k using 2 blink nurse and I was told that I was playing a trash killer (even though Nurse is one of the best killers in the game.)
---
You can either collapse post-chat using the double arrows or just stop playing the game if you can’t handle the toxicity (and thats okay bcuz some people genuinely cant handle it. mental health is #1 priority). The developers of the game know about the toxic community and have done nothing to stop it. The report button doesn’t do a damn thing. This game is a joke honestly. 
---
However, there are people here and in-game who are nice and wont be mean but we’re the minority.  
---
Every game you play (as killer) is dictated by your rules. You can slug, mori, camp and tunnel (these 2 are not advised ) if you please. Don’t let someone tell you how to play your game.
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen this before, I hope your not stealing artwork and acting like you made it?
---
I demand COMPENSATION.
---
I run towards the killer when that happens. Time to punish the little shit.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e19jpz/if_only_they_gave_a_daily_for_getting_hooked/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
This is actually better than 90% of suggestions, few bits of criticism tho.
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but isn't Radio just a better bond? Areas are similar with the added bonus of sharing auras
---
Applying exhausted with an M1 is extremely over powered. Maybe make it so the exhausted effect from this perk goes down whilst in chase? 
---
Self sacrifice is a great idea tho 
---
Also, this is obviously an opinion, while the drawing itself is good, I think the design of the killer would benefit from being more human like. Similar to something like terminator with more of a horror theme?
---
:(
---
P:
---
When it does load me in it says failed to create party
---
try turning it back on
---
Yup
---
nah but for real: discordance
---
This happens to me a lot. But yesterday, I had: A Claudette that kept crouching 20m from me while I was on hook on struggle phase, doing absolutely nothing, scared of the killer, that was chasing someone else on the other side of the map. Yep, I died. Then I had a match with a Bill that in a chase, ran into my direction on purpose while I was getting unhooked. Of course the killer downed me. Yes, I died. And then, I had a match with a Tapp that did the same thing. I died again. I was so frustrated, team mates like these makes me wanna uninstall so bad. Rank 10, btw.
---
it has nothing to do with skill. swf ignore every game mechanic. they have benefits that solo survivors will practically never get. they know where teammates are at all times, they know where the killer is at all times (when doing something productive), they know what generators to work on to get the game done asap, they know what perks the other survivors are running, they can band together to use some really overpowered swf builds like “can’t hook me” etc. it isn’t optimal play if solo survivors can’t do half of that without wasting 3 perk slots and having extremely competent teammates. 
---
no killer in their right mind could get a 4k against that.
---
that’s why it would be extremely unproductive to just buff killers that go against solo survivors. for what? 
---
if someone isn’t skilled enough to play against solos to the point where they need a buff then how the hell are they skilled enough to play against swf? doesn’t make sense.
---
*blendette
---
I now want this as a skin. Really good and unique cost play btw.
---
I tried still long ass queues. I'll just play mortal kombat 11 until then
---
If you combo Pop &amp; Surveillance or Surge and Surveillance that's better. But the perk itself is really good, I don't really use it alone. I don't like discordance, surveillance is more consistent but you have to kick gens more, which is why I mentioned surge/pop and it.
---
christmas comes earlky this year :-*
---
I get into game but constantly get disconnected after the first gen gets done, I thought it was fixed there because the survivors got the gens down to two but it disconnected me again just as I was about to third hook a guy. I’ve reset my PS4 and internet 2 now so something fucky must be happening with the servers
---
You’ve gotta be green rank if you think Nurse is still a good killer XD. She is not even close to existing in red ranks where I play. And most Nurses that do exist are jokes. 
---
There is way too much free windows of escape against Nurse. As someone who plays 50/50, I’d rather Nurse he feared and respected than treated like the absolute Garbage BHVR left her in.
---
Edit: downvoting without explaining why you think I’m wrong doesn’t make me any less correct.
---
So let's say Billy is better than oni, what are the best perks for Billy?
---
Okay, sorry I couldn't help
---
well in this case theyre pointing at you, but it would make more sense to do the come here one
---
Nope -- I generally avoid tunneling unless the person is being really stupid or cocky.  
---
Mostly if I down the same person who just got off the hook, I'll go off after the savior and leave the team to pick that person back up.   
---
I'm not going to pull punches if you/ your team decides to play really idiotically.
---
Eh dbd at it's finest folks
---
lol makes sense
---
Discordance
---
I was a killer doing a challenge and finishing it. I was playing against baby survivors so I thought I’d let them do gens and farm. Then game crashes and I don’t get compensated for the challenge. 
---
Never again.
---
I've seen it when I begin leveling a new killer against Seal Team Six SWF's. Not too common, but its out there.
---
NEEDS A NERF
---
Sad yiddle noises
---
If you dont like cheesy writing and bad special effects evil dead just isnt for you
---
Same, restarted and back in again.
---
I SWEAR THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MY WEBCAM
---
Doesnt really reward you for focusing on the obsession, if the obsession dies before exit gates are powered it doesnt really have any use
---
True enough. 
---
What about Remember Me?
---
On trapper. Surv for a 3 gen with pop and surge and ruin ez gg.
---
It is its a skull on fire with an 8 ball i think
---
You're correct, he's bottom tier. But he's certainly not the worst killer. I'd put him as fourth or fifth from the bottom.
---
Unspoken, player made rules are meaningless. The only rules you should be following are made by the devs themselves. You're analogy falls flat, pulling a pistol out during a race goes against any rules of a standard race.
---
Nothing better than landing a hit as someone throws a pallet down on you when you have enduring and spirit fury ❤️
---
The turtle beeches work great for me and only cost £20-25.
---
That's... actually a perfect solution, what the hell Behaviour?
---
Exactly. The only "rules" I'm talking about here are player made ones. Of course I'm going to follow the actual rules of the game.
---
Honestly I fucking love that feeling
---
i prefer a solo stealthy play style so i tend to run 
---
urban evasion, iron will, bond &amp; self care. 
---
a really fun build i’ve been using lately is basically a savior build where i run borrowed time, we’ll make it, empathy &amp; wglf for bloodpoints!
---
Alright guys here is the most toxic/op build there is in the game for survivors:
---
No mither, selfcare, solidarity, and fixated
---
You can play now?
---
Seen this one somewhere last year, though that was over 60k subs ago so good ,on ya dude
---
So what's your point? Since putting any perks on billy pushes him beyond top tier, I should just play perkless billy?
---
I'm all ears is better for mindgaming windows then actually finding survivors
---
Depends on how good you are. Meta is also overrated. I solo 99.9% of my games, I don't even remember the last time I queued with a friend (who barely manages to hit purple ranks). I run horrible, but fun perks 90% of my games and I still escape most games (currently at rank 1).
---
When I want to fuck around but still carry solo games I run :
---
- Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, OoO
---
If I don't feel like using OoO because it's overpowered, I run a build that has infinite looping potential:
---
- Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, Iron Will +1 (mostly balanced landing, sometimes plunderer) 
---
Shoutout to
---
- Deliverance, BT, Dead hard, Decisive strike
---
Hold on, who are you again?
---
Who are you again?
---
Yeah, 19. Pretty sure that's legal everywhere in the world.
---
“On PC” major 4head moment
---
I was literally thinking about this when I saw him unmasked
---
How is this a buff? It seems like a nerf to me
---
Different analogy then; in the race you know one of your opponents has suffered a terrible loss in their family, so to get the upper on them you insult their loss. You win the race because you hit them emotionally. Its not against the rules but its just a straight dick move. Unwritten rules for sprotsmanship are a thing. Dont try and discredit them.
---
I should have called the house hold the Gen rushers lol
---
That's in Survivor, not in proper English
---
Kindve need it with Trapper tbh
---
The DC person points should be split among the other players
---
This is a ShitPost of the highest caliber
---
Honestly just play how you want your playing “wrong” no matter what anyways,
---
I wouldn’t want this but I guess the upside would be being able to save 1 million for survivor and 1 million for killer before a new chapter gets released.
---
I’m a simple person, I see Ash vs. Evil Dead memes I upvote

So I’m not the only one

I feel that it’s the maps and the gens that are the problem
---
I won’t even get that screen on my switch. It just gets stuck at the loading screen before the main menu
---
That's ironic. Reddit tells me your comment is 8 hours old. I'm here because the servers are down...
---
I mean people with keys can't complain lol
---
Thanks!
---
I agree. I’ve had mine for about two years now and they are good quality and not to expensive!
---
Just tried to play at 10:15 PM EST, got into the game as killer but as soon as it loaded and showed me in-game, it booted me and now says I need a network connection to play.  But, I have one as everything else works.
---
Welp...
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
Some wear glass shards for example
---
Give ds inner strength balanced and iron will a go its personally my favorite setup besides ds I’m not a fan of that so I don’t use it I’ll run bt or something instead or maybe bond but usually I can tell where people will be
---
Ah, now I recall. I checked the thread. Tbh I think I didn’t block you specifically for one of two reasons
---
I didn’t actually consider you one of the people I hated
---
Or
---
I didn’t expect you to comment on my post mocking me and on another post of mine mocking me. 
---
At most I would have expected a private chat insult of sorts. That stuff seems reasonable, but what you chose doesn’t. Big oof choice if ya ask me. Yeah I’m petty but... I ain’t gonna insult ya on your other posts. You gave me no reason to, hell this still not a reason for me to do that to ya. 
---
Anyway, seeing as how you went this far, I guess you DO qualify as one of the people I hate. Let me fix this situation by blocking you like the rest :).
---
Dude, you're comparing perkless spirit with billy equipped with meta perks? WTF. Also I have never seen anyone saying billy is more powerful than spirit. I would rather face bamboozle spirit fury instant saw billy rather than perkless spirit.
---
This system is very stupid. Don't pay attention to it.
---
Did you not read my original post buddy? I said fuck them. Play whatever you want and worry about your fun and how you want to play. It's not your job to worry about whether or not the survivors are having a fair or fun time in their opinion. You think they'd give you the same luxury? Hell no. They're gonna run decisive, adrenaline, dead hard, and other bullshit meta perks so you play whatever you want to get the upper hand and win.
---
Duuuude ain’t this the truth. I always see my teammates just sneaking around the map doing nothing.
---
I just tried to start a game as killer, game loaded but then booted me out.  Now can't get into the game as it thinks I have no network connection, but everything else on the PS4 works.
---
No DbD tonight sadly. :(
---
I prefer Surveillance by far. The utility of Discordance is limited to simply knowing when more than 1 survivor is on a generator. If you're playing Trapper and that gen is cross-map on a large map or you're already committed to a chase/defending another gen, odds are not in your favor at that point. But you'll see it light up with Disc &amp; want to try to get there in time, thus giving up potential map pressure elsewhere. I've tried it on several M1 killers (Plague, Trapper, Legion) and it does not compliment their kits at all imo. Sometimes the paranoia of it hinders me more than it helps me, haha. A decent Billy, Nurse, or Spirit may be able to make use of it, but that's it.
---
Once you have a rudimentary patrol route memorized for maps, Surveillance offers a lot more bang for the perk slot. It's reliant on locating a gen being worked on first, but experienced killers get a feel for this. It's effects work longer and on multiple generators. Say you find a gen that 2 survivors are working on. You hit a survivor, kick the gen, &amp; commit to chasing either survivor. You now have an indicator if the 2nd survivor or any other teammate stops that gen from regressing while you're chasing the other person. This allows continued potential map pressure on every survivor &amp; I love that about the perk. 
---
Neither are hyper-meta perks as long as a bevvy of stall perks exist (and BBQ offers all-around more utility), but I think Surveillance is a mainstay for me as I continue to challenge myself to stray from the more egregious stall perks like Ruin, Sloppy, Pop, etc... Like BBQ, it simply feels like a more engaging/active perk for both sides than those 3. Spirits using it drive me nuts though. :p
---
They probably went to r/dbdgonewild and that destroyed their servers.
---
Too busy shitting in the tall grass
---
Yea , schooled a crew of toxic swf
---
#GROOVY
---
This. He clearly doesn't play Freddy
---
I run Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, and Iron Will to loop the killer. My meta build is DS, Adrenaline, BT, and Dead Hard/Balanced Landing.
---
They were resolved for a few hours, but then PS4 users started to experience more issues.
---
What rank are you at? Most people at purple and red ranks can hit Overcharge skill checks.
---
I'm just saying you think billy with a perk is the best killer which is not something most people would agree with. Also every top tier killer gets nerfed so I can only assume you are the beginning of the nerf billy bandwagon.
---
Then i have no idea what your point is....
---
&gt;Left Behind increased Generator repair speed by 75% when you were the last one alive
---
They buffed it when EGC was introduced. 
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Left_Behind
---
Myers: they’ll all dc
---
I agree. Ghostface is way better then hag if played correctly
---
No. Those DLCs were given free because they were years ago. Hasn't been a killer or survivor thats been free since. You can use shards though.
---
funny cuz i don't run any perks cuz I'm too new to have unlocked the good ones and i get worse messages than that every game from people 10 ranks better than me cuz match making
---
Of course SWFs are gunna have better information because they have comms. But like thats not something the game can account for, thats why games like Rainbow 6 or overwatch balance for top level. Of course teams in those games that dont use comms and are just a group of randos are likely to have less information and will play less optimally because of it. Its a team game and they have to balance around optimal team play. If survivors play optimally and a killer plays optimally the killer has no chance. If they want balance to be 2 kills 2 escapes, they should strive to balance so that if both sides play optimally the result will most likely be 2 dead 2 escape.
---
Yeah. They changed it before it got implemented.
---
Not as difficult as you think, just don’t heal in dead zones or in closed of areas where you can get snuck up on. Follow him around and play to his weaknesses, as he’s just a m1.
---
That's when I mori them &gt;:)
---
no perks are toxic. if survivors can run any perk and do what ever it takes to escape, then there is literally 0 reason a killer should have to worry about his perks or playstyle
---
Well you can only have 1 ruin or  pop in a game and 4 DS borrowed time adrenaline and sb. That's the biggest problem. 100% unfun and unrewarding to play against.
---
Buff a killer that is already strong. Stupid
---
u effed them all up u monsta
---
Wrong, huntress was free because we earned it, we completed a series of challenges as a whole community and that dlc was the reward. It would’ve been paid otherwise
---
Played a couple games after the party error, now I'm getting 8108 error and can't get ingame at all
---
I got bitched out for an endgame play today and the killer said they were camping to back me up. Other than that it was a GGs kinda day.
---
I’ve been booted from my last three games right at the end. So no blood points for any of it.
---
More important are the add ons, a bag to carry extra traps is a absolute must
---
They may as well replace the rating system with a "did you win or lose?" button
---
K
---
Overcharge......
---
aw that made me think how neat itd be for Steve Urkel to be a survivor. he misses a gen skill check and goes 'did iii do thaaat? laugh laugh snort snort'
---
Same thing happened to me. Friend and I got kicked from a match, now we can’t even load the game up
---
I always bring at least a trapper sack!
---
I sit between 12-13. I’m not very good, I just enjoy the game
---
Some of my funnest matches were when I lost. It's the journey not the destination
---
GF is really good at high ranks, you just aren’t playing well clearly
---
Lmfaooo
---
I didnt clarify what I would consider fowl play, but if you're fine with tunneling or camping (or whatever playstyle) when you're the survivor than go for it, but dont play like a complete dick and then get mad at other killers for playing the way you do. 
---
It's a game, all players involved should have fun. If you're blatantly disregarding the fun of others, then yea, you're a dick.
---
I was just booted from a game at the very end, and then trying to start a new game it now says "failed to create party" and just loads forever... On ps4
---
No obsession no DS 4head
---
you must be fun at parties.
---
I'm at purple ranks currently so I don't think Overcharge will help. I don't like how the ranking system works because I get bullied a lot when I get to red ranks since I play survivor 60% of the time.
---
My point of for people to understand what a competitive game is because sometimes I wonder if the player base even knows because of howany people want their opponents being "friendly" to them and basically giving them the win. I don't know how many times I've heard someone on the survivor side want a killer to basically just hand them the win and vice versa for killers asking survivers to give them a win. "Killers who get 4k games are selfish and should let at least one surviver escape" "it's unfair when all 4 survivers escape, they should at least sacrifice one"
---
Lmfao, it happens. But she’s still top tier.
---
oh shoot shit, I feel like a fool, I assumed he meant he was in xb his friends was on PC not both PC, but yeah Microsoft store and steam can play together it's somewhere in settings
---
False alarm. They back down again.
---
The lunge you described is literally just how demogorgons lunge works but if you want to describe it as a long pig lunge that works too either way already in the game
---
Top tier trash
---
How it feels to play against legion* lol
---
Hahahah, yeah nah
---
Edit: yeah just downvote me for no reason man lol
---
Yeah, they’re not the best though.
---
all of these games are fun imo i just wish they had more players.
---
to me i take them as alternatives to dbd so i would play them when i was tired of dbd, however most of them arent getting updates anymore :/
---
Bad idea
---
"b-B-B-b-ut NuRsE Is sTiLL A tOP tiEr KillER"
---
Lol I loved how she was like "uh? wha-...sigh*..."
---
Well, just tried to play as killer, and the game booted me within 30 seconds of getting into a lobby. (on ps4)
---
That’s true. Surveillance would probably be better for you then. And same! I mostly play killer so when I get to a lower rank survivors are so mean to me lol
---
Ruin NOED and purple addons.... you needs chill man lol gg
---
Did you try putting rice in it?
---
It is as much a bitch perk as Adrenaline is if not less. There is only 1 NOED and up to 4 Adrenaline. Think about it for a moment.
---
No ds on any of them? Wow, it must have been a good game. Their points say that you slaughtered them tho lol
---
Exactly what I was thinking when it happened lol
---
That's not unwritten rules, thats just whining. Unwritten rules for dbd are things like; dont face camp or hard tunnel.
---
Make perks even stronger than they already are. Bad idea
---
Daaaaaaaamn! I absolutely love everything on this picture!
---
The killer seems awesome, the survivor looks great and all perks are really good.
---
Amazing job!
---
I feel the big thing about nurse too was that as being the best killer, with skill, she was the safest bet when it came to dealing with best survivors (Rank 1 / mainly SWF). Spirit is good too but the skill yielded higher reward as nurse.
---
I see it as most low tier survivors did not know how to deal with and created a bigger nurse nerf craze, (though omega blink was kinda cheap).
---
But I was seeing less nurses than before even before the nurse.
---
I don’t think survivors are entitled to an easy fair match, nor do I think my killer should. 
---
But there is a moral dilemma I’ve always faced  where I know either side is going to lose horribly so I start playing horribly in order for them to gain some points.
---
The more people deal with toxicity in this game, the less likely they are to continue playing it.   Ques are bad enough as it is.
---
I just had the same issue. Also on ps4
---
Basement: Haha, No.
---
Except the tethered Adelaide is literally just normal Adelaide remember she did the switcharoo with the original
---
Reee
---
Imagine expecting the dbd devs to actually release stable patches and content /s
---
He isn't strong.
---
He has a decent ability (if slightly underpowered), but relies heavily on survivors fucking up.
---
Dark traps which were given by....
---
What do you mean by “shutting down people with valid criticism”?
---
They should make gen speed lower but increase the speed for working together and hitting great skillchecks. Then Ruin won't be a must have because it will have a lesser effect than now which is basically have a chance to do something for X seconds (usually 20 because spawn locations are amazing). 
---
But it will never happen so boring meta it is
---
Here comes the trapper
---
Servers have been messing up lately that's probably it
---
I don’t really enjoy playing against them, none of the survivors I’ve played with like playing against them but there are plenty of people who insist they’re totally fine so you probably won’t get too much hate for playing them. The biggest ones I’ve heard things about are:
---
Hex: Ruin
---
Barbecue and Chili
---
No One Escapes Death
---
And the Mori add-ons are pretty annoying to play against.
---
Again you probably won’t be known as “that guy” but again; I’ve never been messaged anything negative and I also don’t run the same perks most killers do. I did however receive a message as soon as I killed someone today and he said “gg that was fun”
---
There’s ways to counter those perks (except Mori add-ons) but they just make things so easy for killers that’s why I don’t run them. A lot of people say “well when you get to the high ranks you need those perks just to compete with survivors” which may be the case, but at low ranks they’re win buttons. I’m mid-tier, just in between high ranks and low ranks and all I can say with certainty is at my level and below those perks are absolutely no fun to play against.
---
Edit: Don’t worry about the “rude response” either, it’s cool and I’ve heard a lot worse
---
1. You are playing on console.
---
2. Nurse takes a fair bit of time to master her blinks, I'd say 50 hours of nurse gameplay gives a decent understanding of the blink mechanics.
---
Thank you very much for the response! Very interesting!

He relies on survivors guessing his mindgame 100% of the time when there is no indication. You considered wraith which shows you haven’t played much. GF is a top tier killer, unless you stalk with him
---
But what is fun for others? That's so vague. I play to win objectively and that's fun for me. And there's nothing wrong with that. Just like as a survivor you would play to win most of the time. You're not gonna give up every chase just because you know it would make me happy as a killer. I don't condone camping and I don't do it myself but I'm just tired of people telling other people how to play killers. Like when was a rule book made saying you can and can't do this? Sometimes I might have to play dirty to have a chance to win and yeah it's a dick move sometimes but I'm trying to win at the end of the day like everybody else. The way I see it is you're not a dick unless youre throwing a game to ruin someone else's (face camping, entire game chase, hardcore tunneling). I want to win but I don't go out of my way to ruin someone else's game.
---
This. I would honestly like to think I am in the 10%, but honestly I have so many moments of moron that I realize I am likely in a transitional state between the two.
---
This is a nerf night shroud is what makes him strong
---
The first DLC I've gotten for DbD.
---
Huh?
---
Everybody in this thread.
---
&gt; give survivors a much slower speed when they step in a snare. They’re currently useless at this point.
---
Absolutely fucking not.
---
Freddy's snares counter 95% of loops, if you can get a survivor slowed through the whole loop from the pallet, you can down them easily.
---
&gt; Make Rule Set No2 base, make Tampered Timer base,
---
Holy fuck no, 2 minute timer with 5 boxes? I'd quit at that point.
---
&gt; Increase the time survivors are intoxicated, make your vision more blurry when intoxicated, and get rid of the slowdown he gets when throwing the bottle. 
---
removing the slow down is fine, but increasing intox time is not a good idea (depends on which intox time you are considering, 10% or 15% vol?. If it was 15%, clown would absolutely own loops.
---
The range of demos lunge is 1-11 meters and it’s charged up there’s a short stun if he misses not similar at all? So basically your killer idea is a worse version of demo and pigs lunge combined
---
They were sweaty with higher ranks but I'll take the 25k plus DBP fr BBQ. Haters gone hate , hater lollll
---
Probably because after playing Ruin 15 times in a row actually winning a match seems worth gloating about. I’m hovering around rank 10 and I’ve yet to receive a single message
---
Y'know, I am not colorblind but don't have great vision. And the snow map fucks with me something awful. I can't see trapper's traps at all, and barely see the gen outlines. The white next to the browns seems to wash all the colors out for me.
---
I've cc'ed before but that's on unfun games where someone DC's or the killer is camping or tunneling and I'm solo in thoes games
---
Zero face camp and all except one were dead hooked.
---
It got nerfed into the ground remember
---
You obviously dont play survivor often.. if you did you would know how bad hard tunneling is. Sure its easy to get 4ks every game if you just keep hooking each person 3 times in a row each, but is it sportsman like? No. You seem to not even follow your own "rules" under the guise of "playing competitively"...
---
Damnnnn haha yeaa it happens. Youll recover though, if you can 😜 still the easiest killer for me to kill with
---
dbd on a chromebook? what the fuck is the specs on that?
---
Y'know I'm absolutely garbage at her but I still understand that she is the best killer without a doubt
---
Cant finish a game without getting the 8018 error code. Thats why i asked how you were playing
---
Me half the time , probably you as well h8a
---
Imagine thinking noed is fun...
---
&gt;I don't know why you're trying to argue why someone on the opposing side should get punished because the one they were against quit the game.
---
DUDE I'M NOT. WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THAT FROM. NOTHING I'VE SAID EVEN HINTS AT THAT. IT'S ALSO THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO ARGUE. I've been trying to say the current way the game handles DC's sucks, and that I think the husks and matchmaking bans are a pretty good solution. I'm a killer main, my entire opinion about the subject is based on my subjective experience playing killer.
---
How were they sweaty higher ranks? They were about the same rank as you and didnt bring items. Pot calling the kettle black for you.
---
Some actual good content for once
---
Sorry you have to be such a rare and dying breed. As this game gets older its playerbase only seems to get sweatier.
---
Obviously a lunge is similar. I never said that it isn't. There's not a whole lot of places you can go with a lunge. You have to charge Demo's, but you have to fully charge it, unless I'm more stupid than I previously believed I am. And, there's a short stun because it makes sense no matter who's doing it. It's the same reason Nurse has fatigue. It prevents abuse. This is intended to be a semi-stealth killer, putting stress on Survivors during chases. I'm sure I'll think of ways to alter it, but this is what I have right this moment.
---
I'm not. I just understand how visibility plays a large role in the balance of the game.
---
Changing the color of something is not as simple as "I can/can't see it." It's much more complex, especially when things are dark. Trust me, I went to school for this.
---
Hold up this doesn’t work
---
Wait but I… OHHHH I main Jane
---
How it became free doesnt really change anything about my statement they used to do stuff like that but its been years since there was a free DLC
---
He’s one of the better killers in the game now.
---
I used the splinter 2 weeks ago
---
How you position yourself when you are doing gens etc makes a big difference. Try to put yourself in a spot that is going to be difficult for him to get line of sight on your without being seen.
---
Yea I literally can’t get into any matches
---
she is
---
Thank you for clarifying, I don't believe it says this in the post. But since you can disarm it, think it should be a really long time or that it can't expire. I may be wrong to think that though.
---
When you have a survivor on hook when the gates are open and the others start to grief and troll you after saving the last survivor with body blocks flashlights dead head etc etc I fcking love NOED ... Hater.
---
You do not have to charge demos all the way also you are nerfing this killer way more than needed a semi stealth w only a lunge is bad think of another original main power they could have as well and they could be good
---
Bruh so true i was look wtf y can i play killer and not survivor
---
Or you get tunneled the whole game and all gens get repaired and you're the only kill "ggez learn to loop"
---
Having issues right now
---
Still not working on PS4. Haven’t been able to finish a game yet.
---
this is even bigger than Ruin skill checks
---
Run inner strength? Do a totem at the start of the match, once you take damage and get a free moment hop in to a locker for a few seconds and nurses calling becomes useless
---
Spine chill. Extremely helpful especially against stealth killers liken spirit or ghost face
---
This was an alpha version of the perk I’m talking about. The devs realized it was overpowered and took it out. There are hackers on pc that use this version of the perk to win games easier
---
he literally said that the power needs a dedicated rework
---
I mean I suppose it can reward killers that objectively bad at the game, but I don't thinking using NOED makes you a bad killer. Regarding the losing the game for it to activate, if you don't bring in a perk to slow down gens in some way you're basically screwed as killer, no matter how good you are. The time you down one person sometimes 2-3 gens can potentially pop if the team is coordinated enough and there's no Ruin.
---
pretty much
---
You're flexing a 4k that wasn't even a perfect game. I already knew you were trash from the start, I'm not surprised you can't 4k all the time even with the strongest perks in the game. H8a
---
I said that before he edited it 😊
---
Die on first hook?
---
Seems to be working on PS4 now.
---
ah i see
---
yes me and my friends cant even stay in a damn party.
---
Play unexpectedly against a Spirit. 
---
Run Iron Will
---
Gen Rush?
---
I took the Myers Briggs test a few months ago and got INTJ. Kind of funny that Adam is in the category since he’s my favorite survivor to play
---
So almost literal insta-vaults if you're the last alive? Sounds fun, but probably op.
---
Shadowborn on nurse makes me want to nut- It really makes her more enjoyable to play imo
---
18p 500mb RAM 30fps intel icore 0.5
---
That's the solo Survivor experience! 
---
Fuuuuuuuuun. /s
---
Let her hook you then. Or try do play ONE match without the intent of winning. Like when you do on a daily. Or maybe use the match as a learning experience so you can get better against the spirit
---
O shit just realized that the percentages would stack up, I thought the percentages would stack up to a max of 25%, not 75%.
---
It went back to normal but then it stopped working again now.
---
I promised myself that I'll never dc in a ranked game unless I have to go somewhere or something
---
Not the pot blah blah blah thing cause I'm sweaty AF.
---
 Sweaty , salty , toxic all that . Hater
---
I do not think we need another killer with an instadown attack, besides the ability would be something similar to that of the demogorgon only more op for the instadown xd
---
I can't speak for every character or MBTI type, but from I think you did a pretty good job...
---
It'd be dishonorable of me
---
Yeah I was picking up my last survivor to hook them at the end the game. It was a perfect game too.. I don’t get those very often and my game crashed..
---
Eh the way I had the cooldown in m9nd was that it would be like heavy smoker nurse fatigue like cooldown
---
Dead ass ever since I got Nancy I run inner strength, spine chill, fixated and deliverance
---
Enough bp to level up twice
---
Do you prefer no or hell no as a response?
---
Sophist.
---
i did not :(
---
I have partial colour blindness and yeah, I struggle to see blood on the ground in some areas. I also struggle to see the killers stain as well.
---
I disagree with RSN2 being base, it would hurt piggy more than it would help her
---
No problem!
---
Run diversion and throw rocks at her
---
Big nope
---
They’re capped at one million because people would hack in large amounts of bloodpoints
---
This seems kind of useless like that one perk where you see 3 gens.
---
All good 👌
---
Fuck i thought there would be an enfpt. I'm sad now.
---
I see you play Xbox 🎮 nice
---
I heard gun media is taking over the office.
---
Ah, alrighty. Won't expire then.
---
Not to mention that they could put the holes near hooks or on the escape door
---
Just troll the killer for as many points as you can and hope you don't depip.
---
Reported to Xbox for cussing
---
Seriously? It's like everything they fix is just a bandaid ffs
---
If you want to be mean af, do a forever Freddy build. This makes gens take absolute fucking ages. 
---
Use the best swing chain add ons, thanantaphobia, dying light, ruin, and pop goes the weasel. No gems will be done, assuming you can keep survivors in the dream state.
---
Is this not a punisable offense as well?
---
I was surprised that three types were not in the game considering there are 41 characters to play as.
---
Visiting Daddy Demo
---
So thats why I die on my first hook in 70% of my solo games!
---

I mean I’m not asking for perfect servers, I’m asking for working ones and that’s the bare minimum I don’t expect anything better than that from them when it comes to technical stuff
---
Platform deffffffinitely matters bud. PC nurses are on another level compared to console.
---
Id swap out dying light for sloppy personally. If you're forcing them to heal with thana might as well make it also take forever.
---
This is a balanced landing with an addition and removal of the speed improvement xd
---
Sir yes sir
---
Every time you down someone you get 5% increase in speed? LMAOOO yeah ok. Imagine running around in 140% movement speed the entire match for downing survivors. Yeah no
---
Edit: all the perk ideas are horrible tbh, we already have rancor and enduring.

---
If you're new your rank is high, the lower your ranks the easier it is to find a match
---
What does it mean when you say adept Trapper?￼
---
The PS4 servers continue to be absolute fucking garbage.
---
If you're a shitty person you are not going to change just because someone is nice to you. That t-bagging killer is not going to change just because survivors are nice to him. His language of choice also shows that he lacks consideration for others who feel outcast by the use of that slur. 
---
I've been tbagged by survivors when performing poorly. It never made me more bloodthirsty the next round. Similarly, I've been tunnelled by killers but it doesn't make me want to tbag the next killer. Stop blaming others for one person's asshollery. The buck stops with that asshole.
---
Just kill yourself on hook then if you really don’t like her
---
I feel like it would be interesting to make the obsession a permanent feature and allow the killer and survivors to choose 5 perks. The obsession and the killer would be the only ones to use the 5th perk and killing the obsession would cause the 5th perk to become inactive.
---
Probably a dumb idea but I thought it was interesting.
---
No? The devs can’t punish that
---
Wait never mind I think it is a trophy.￼
---
holy shit i just realized how heated my ps4 was getting this is insane
---
You can't eliminate an exhaustion perk when a survivor is using it. It's no different.
---
Servers are being weird today
---
You do whatever the fuck you want. You don’t have to follow some fake rules someone else made up. 
---
Just make sure you kill them all next time. :)
---
#What can I say except delete this
---
Looks like I'm just stupid then. Either way, the Hunter is based off of the, well, Hunter from the Left 4 Dead series. It makes an amount of sense, and Bill never came with a Killer, so... the semi-stealth thing is intended to make it different from the other two main stealth Killers, Pig and Ghost Face (sorry, Señor Bing Bong.) I'll go on the assumption that you haven't played Left 4 Dead, but even if you have, it makes sense to explain it. When playing as the Hunter (in L4D,) you can choose the distance and height you pounce by looking at different angles. Obviously it makes no sense for a Killer to be able to jump 30 feet in the air, so having it as different distances is a good solution. An idea is making it an insta-down, as that's what the original is anyway. This gives more of a reason for the terror radius to still be present while it's active.
---
Hell yeah.
---
People think it's OP, but people even thought windows of opportunity was OP at first.
---
No I must show the truth
---
Keep trying to play as best as you can, so that you can get better vs her. Please dont put the other 3 people in the shit just because you don't like going against spirit.
---
Just because you’re trash with her it doesn’t mean she’s bad loll
---
Still op bro 
---
x,d
---
I didnt say you were. I was exaggerating an example... sorry wont happen again.
---
Ok
---
Just as much as other perks then.
---
Seems like closing the game out and completly reloading helps for a match or 2, very aggravating.
---
It was litterally posted everywhere lol
---
In ps4 the basic attacks of killers have a VERY slight auto aim to the survivors and when they start to run in zigzag that auto aim of crap becomes very annoying because it gives a lot of sensation of failing the attack when you know it was not
---
Groovy!
---
You are correct. Goodbye now
---
See you in the fog
---
I'm just sick of killer mains going on about how toxic Survivors are when IME, they are the ones who tunnel, camp, hit you repeatedly on hook all because you loop them or drop a pallet or DS them.
---
The worst survivors have done to me is teabagging. But then again I turn off messaging so I don't read toxic comments from them. But either way, comments and tbagging don't affect how the game plays out unlike tunnelling and camping.
---
Time ban
---
I’ve had survivors on death hook DC to deny me BBQ.
---
Hopefully not
---
That’s dumb. Now killers are just going to sit in a corner to depip everyone. Lol
---
Is this what's causing error code 8018?
---
Toxic survivor main, gonna report you XD
---
its beenlagging loads to
---
If Wraith himself doesn't need a buff (even though he desperately does), the literal garbage known as Swift Hunt needs to be buffed. Four tenths (or 13.333% repeating) off of three seconds isn't worth 6k bloodpoints or an add-on slot.
---
The game is 60 FPS easily. The skillchecks are around 20. How? Nobody knows...
---
What a bad argument xd
---
Oh. Ok well in that case I'll be doing that. Thanks man.
---
Love the noob3 reference
---
Fuck ruin, Fuck corrupt intervention, fuck any other perk, Use Noed to counter everything the survivors did the entire trial
---
I'm pretty sure this is sarcasm.
---
Just stand still and let them kill you. Duh.
---
Good job!
---
No dude matchmaking bans aren't fully implemented yet. The current ban only kicks in if you DC 30% of your matches. Soon, if you DC **once** you can't queue for ten minutes IIRC, and it gets worse if you do it more. This system is not live. Also, DC's do not help the killer in terms of perk effects/points/pips/rank. And you don't get 2500 points, it's like 600. The husk will alleviate all of these issues. If you don't see how this will help killers, you either don't play killer or are bad at it.
---
PC crossplay disabled
---
Spent about 20 mins trying to find a lobby as both killer and survivor, didn't get any games.
---
I can't count how many times I've seen people post this exact same totem spot.
---
Legion is basically autopilot. You don't even need four kills to get a two pip. That's why there's so many garbage Legion players at high rank who think they are good. They rely off of no one escapes death and a ton of deviousness points.
---
If you manage to get an entity displeased as Legion. Well... As the great Mathieu Cote once said, pardon my French, "Play something else, civilization is a good game. Gtfo weegion scrubs uwu"
---
I think their stats are worthless anyway. Im not sure but i think they used an average across all ranks so, rank 20 killers getting averaged in with rank 1s. Also number of kills per match is kind of a shit stat anyway. Someone with noed can do nothing and then just slug all 4 survivors during endgame and get a 4k where someone else can have a close game where the get a 9 hook 1k. I think stats we need to see are for each killer at red ranks average chase times and maybe average hooks per game. Thats a bit more telling of a killers performance.
---
gens before friends :)
---
Skillchecks are important gameplay wise. You do not trust the client to tell the server whether it succeeded or not because the client can cheat then. Gameplay important actions have to be decided by the server.
---
Got to love pyros “Hunt down the Refund” new leaving the recommended
---
u/hachikuri0 It seems a lot of people took offense about the toxicity bit or took it a little too literally with the way I wrote it poorly. I completely agree that tunnelling and camping isn't fun whatsoever and is absolute bullshit. Strategies like those only go so far and eventually (at least I hope) the people who do it realizes it hurts them more than it helps because good teammates will punish that by doing gens. Sorry if I upset you. My intentions wasn't to complain about survivors themselves, I'm not a killer main whatsoever so I was trying to look at both perspectives.
---
I don’t understand how that would work. If they could hack in numbers, wouldn’t they already be doing that despite a 1 million limit to blood points?
---
Why do I feel attacked from this?
---
Its hygiene in fear I guess.
---
Also been out of school for a while but i think 
---
Tstat= (.35-.30)/(.1/(100^.5)) = 5 
---
Df= 99
---
Just plugged those into an online p value calculator and got p=.00001

You could cleanse totems and prevent the perk from activating
---
devs said fuck it. functional game machine broke. i get it’s an indie company but shit, y’all just go to bed when your financial livelihood is completely in the shits? cmon man, i spent my money on this shit
---
Try hitting that on the Switch version you'll be a god if you accomplish that
---
Sloppy does work, it’s just everything takes forever anyway, so you can buy time for dying to work. Plus, with dying light it slows healing in everyone except the obsession.
---
I never said they help you rank up. Wow I must have really pissed you off if you're to the point of putting words in my mouth instead of bringing any actual data to the discussion.
---
That's the entire point. The husk isn't doing anything that benefits the survivors, and at the same time the survivors are not doing anything that benefits a husk. While you are picking up, and moving a husk to a hook. All that time waste is seconds gone from finding survivors (Hunter), chasing survivors (Hunter), hitting survivors (Brutality), damaging generators (survivors main goal, and Brutality), using your abilities (Deviousness), and hooking/sacrificing survivors that are actually in the game (Sacrifice). The things that take time away from the survivors giving Killer more time to win. If you move a husk, that is all that time the 3 survivors are working on gens - the main objective, because they have no incentive to stop you, or save a person that dc's.
---
Wait till the end game, and you may miss out on hooking them entirely, or you forcibly slug remaining players till you take the time to hook 1 or 2 husks. Which is toxic game play by the community standards, and no fun for anyone.
---
**Time is the most crucial resource in the whole game, and is what asymmetrical games are based around.**
---
So the devs are liars?
---
But you gotta get the gens done dude!, Only focus on Gens!!!
---
I believe this is an attempt with SWF for low ranks
---
I was reading this shit too and I immediately thought that over half of these are ridiculous. Most of these aren’t changes they’re just overpowered buffs
---
Three fucking matches in a row I get hooked to start the game and watch as everyone is doing shit other than unhooking me. Then finally one of them decides to get me right before I'm about to die on the hook just in time for the killer to loop back around, down me and kill me. It had the same thing happen almost identically in three solo matches tonight. I raged so hard. I honestly don't know how people pip up in solo matches I'm a rank 8 and it seems like if I play with random's I get thrown in all sorts of random lobbies.
---
they're good trash bronck
---
I love Franklin's demise. I have had many victims thanks to the greedy survivors who want to retrieve their items x, d
---
Thana also slows healing. Either is good for the forever freddy build, i just prefer sloppy as it needs no set up like dying light does. Plus that pesky obsession gets bonuses which im not too fond of.
---
Possibly, but they all loaded into the lobby at separate times, so not a SWF
---
I hate telling people to only play a specific way, but this game is never going to be an Esport so I don't really understand why people can't handle not achieving a 4k or escaping every match. People tend to forget that the game is supposed to be balanced around 2 kills a match on average.   The us vs them mentality will be the death of DBD
---
Nurse is literally the strongest killer that can exist. It all comes down to the killer's skill as there is a nearly limitless skill ceiling.
---
Objectively, Nurse will always be the strongest unless there is a killer that has a stupidly high amount of map knowledge with map pressure to work.
---
The upcoming oni, stranger things, the clown and Ghostface
---
Or stop poorly defending a badly designed character. I have detailed reasoning on why she is terrible, and just saying "you just suck" isn't going to change my mind
---
Lol this games okay on PC, barely above garbage on console, so I am sure for switch your experience will be miserable
---
Bois, it's still down on the PS4. What's happening?
---
Just spent the last 15-20 minutes on XBOX trying to sync with my friend. We know the game has been down all day but there was s message saying servers are back.
---
I joined her but it showed she immediately left (she didn't), I tried joining her from another invite, nothing. I tried leaving my lobby back to menu but it wouldn't let me leave. I tried several times and nothing. I managed to get in to the archive and that threw me out to the menu again. 
---
I set up a lobby and she joined but 5 minutes went by and she asked if I was ready. She didn't see I had been ready. We quit and I joined her new lobby. She couldn't see me. Again. 
---
15-20 minutes just lobby jumping, trying to get the damn lobby sync to work. 
---
Once it finally did, I got a game in less than 5 minutes and got in a 10 minute match against a Myers at Coldwind. Then I had to get off because I gotta get stuff done before bed. 
---
Hopefully I can get another match when I return.
---
One 10 minute game for the whole day otherwise.
---
That doesn't mean anything though. I've played in a swf where I loaded in way quicker than my friend did.
---
I don't think this is a good idea for a perk, and have a few reasons why.
---
First, if a SWF is all running the perk, they can prevent the killer from hooking the downed survivor. All they'd need to do is run to the three nearest hooks and each dig a hole. Even if two people did it, it's quite possible the killer would go to a hook with a hole in front of it, or be unable to reach the next available hook.
---
Even if the holes can't be placed directly under hooks, they could be placed in pathways to hooks, forcing the killer to go around, or past a pallet. The amount of people that would wiggle free or get free due to the stun would make the perk too strong. This could be made even more powerful in combination with hook sabo'ing.
---
Players running over holes dug by teammates could easily escape chase, especially with Sprint Burst, Lithe, Dance With Me, Quick and Quiet. They could also work on gens with limited access next to a hole, and not even have to start running until the killer got stunned.
---
Additionally, survivors could place holes in the basement or outside shack, and prevent the killer from getting basement hooks. What's stopping survivors from lining up another hole in front and behind a killer while the killer is stunned on a path where there are only two exits? 
---
I don't think you've detailed any counterplay, so please feel free to provide more details on your idea. From what I can tell, the killer would have to resort to slugging everyone (if they're even able to catch them), which doesn't make for a fun game for the survivors.
---
Pallets give us a way to stun the killer. There are a limited number of pallets to ensure we don't abuse them. With the new survivor's perk, it's possible we'll see pallets being reused, which can increase the potential number of stuns. The killer can break the pallets to prevent this from happening.
---
Thoughts?
---
True, I forgot about the new servers
---
according to your data
---
you basically just ignored my point of just leaving the husk for later by saying hurr it's toxic (which might possibly even let you deny hatch)  which invalidates your incredibly long winded and incredibly obvious to everyone argument. plus you didnt know how the matchmaking ban works, you didnt know how many points a dc gives you, and you clearly dont follow dev updates. you're either not rank 1 or havent been for a very long time.
---
It’s working for me now. So we’ll see how long this one will last...
---
EDIT: After queuing up to a game, I’m getting a bunch of error messages. 😕
---
The game is fun and the servers are not usually down. Today has been an exception, not a rule. I hope it can redeem itself!
---
When there’s 1 generator left and I’m being camped on the hook and all 3 survivors just hide behind a tree or something and watch me die or run at the killer and take a hit and run away and self care. Either save me or do a gen. Stop being useless.
---
Congrats!
---
It’s so satisfying so see it.
---
Just use Tru3s build it works at red ranks for me he’s damn good
---
I don't get how there are people that have waited all day to get in to a game. Finally get through all the error messages and get into a match just to disconnect when they are downed. Can't wait for a punishment system to come on for the people that constantly disconnect
---
Y’all motherfuckers who aren’t colorblind trying to chime in saying it’ll ruin the game or balance are dumb AF. I hear y’all can see the red blood and scratch marks just fine. Y’all know how fucking hard it is to keep track of survivors while being colorblind as a killer? I can’t see the blood at all. Like I’ll get the notification and wonder where it is on the ground because I don’t see it. So I don’t play killer much and play Survivor much more.
---
Glad to see you aren't dead, but don't post and drive
---
You just asked me for reasoning while also saying you're not going to be open minded about it? What's the point then?
---
I meant that unhooks counted but it would take more tokens, 3. Protections hits would be ok but they don’t work properly
---
Problem with this is that once survivors know it’s him, they’ll just stay away from each other. If another survivor comes near them, they’ll know it’s the killer. Plus, he would be useless in a swf match.
---
Cool idea but sadly not possible since he could be countered hard
---
Just logged on (12:31pm) on switch and got a message from devs saying all platforms are back online. Got into a match pretty quickly too
---
That games done for that lawsuit will ruin that studio with all the legal fees. If they would just give the rights back and just use the rest of what they own they could save so much money but they are going all out.
---
DBD “balancing” is a lot of bandages slapped on gaping wounds that need stitches.
---
I'm not colorblind, but I do have a bit of trouble seeing blood and scratch marks at times. These options are pretty important for a game that takes place in a mostly dark setting.
---
They're not fun to feel forced into using either. I play both sides and the meta in this game feels like dog shit. There are a LOT of perks and the viability of them is very small, and they need anything fun into complete uselessness.
---
&gt;I meant that unhooks counted but it would take more tokens, 3. Protections hits would be ok but they don’t work properly
---
They tested safe unhooks and as expected, it made MoM worse. Not only it encouraged hook bombing to get your perk active but in addition to protection hits, it was easier to activate it.
---
Then I will see you when you wake, servers are still broken atm
---
It’s a thing for the new killer who can absorb blood orbs, it’s not for all killers
---
I can’t be open minded about a fact? I was just wondering what the “detailed reasoning” is because there literally can’t be good reasoning behind something that isn’t true. Also, downvoting a comment doesn’t win you the argument buddy. Just makes you seems amateur and salty.
---
I think that they should also keep the addons if they get 4 k/2 pips, the same way survivor can keep the item and addons if they escape.
---
Survivors snap their legs in half
---
How about at least a safety pip for survivors. Im tired of green ranks where everyone tunnels, camps, and dick rides totems.
---
Ahh I see a blendette trying to be a Jake main?
---
“:3”
---
You just loop him like normal but if you see him start putting down snares drop the pallet early because you most likely wont be able to make another loop. Kind of like playing against clown.
---
u/yourneighborhoodbm I agree on the survivors not saving just to gen rush and the killer slugging when it's unnecessary is toxic but I meant just doing the objective and put in my post /being a good teammate. When the Ghostface in my game got rushed it was coincidence, and because he was chasing someone.
---
Might not be on purpose, whenever I get a game now (IF I get one, I'm still getting network errors), it disconnects me during the game
---
See, the problem is...
---
At low ranks, survivor logic is: Ruin is up, well shit I can't work on generators until we find ruin
---
A optimized team of survivors wins against a killer every time. You can complete 5 gens in 4 minutes with an optimized team. I've had games where that has happened. If you read the comment thread with shorse_hit I explain that skilled survivors easily counter unskilled tactics that make Killers lose games, or only make it as far as green/purple ranks because they can't consistently get 4 sacrificed games to reach rank 1.   That includes tunnelers, campers, and farmers. If you are bad enough as a survivor that the killer farms off you. Then you are in the wrong rank, and need to get better at the game.
---
Also again it's not the Killers job to make the game fun for you. He is your opponent, an enemy. He wants you to lose moral, mess up, and lose. He wants to get inside your head and piss you off. You getting annoyed because Doctor spam shock treatment you, and then you DC. You played exactly into a low skilled mind game, and cost your team the win because of it. That's not the killers fault. A good survivor would just extend the chase, allowing their ally's to finish more Gens. Which punish's the doctor for wasting his time "trolling" by spamming you with his ability.
---
That's one example of a survivor outsmarting a killer abusing a low skill tactic.
---
A killer keeps slugging you, if you DC and don't try to recover to near full. Wiggle out when the killer picks you up, or give your ally's a chance to save you - one ally might have unbreakable, get up and come save you. You decide to DC. Then you just lost the mind game to the killer, you let them get into your head, and piss you off that you dropped your paddle in a ping pong game, and left the table. The killer should not be punished for that. That is purely the survivor's fault, and only their team should be punished for it.
---
As it stands right now, and then with Husks. The Killer is still being punished for people dcing. If two people dc early in a game, then the killer can only black pip, because the points from all other categories matter. With husks they waste precious time moving a body that is giving no purpose to the game. That time wasted goes to the survivors allowing them to complete objectives without pressure. You may get stacks for perks, and Sacrifice category points, but at the loss of the most important resource **time**. The killer still is punished in that equation.
---
Same way you counter The Clown. Drop the pallet early. People get VERY greedy with pallets and go down a lot because of it
---
not funny montage parodies all use the same effects and jokes after you watch one you've seen them all
---
Hallowed Blight and Winter Solstice hands down my favorite musics
---
ah, sorry about that. it’s just really fucking bad lmao
---
Yeah, shit like that just happens sometimes. But games like those you can still win with honor. If you let anger get in your way you'll play worse. And i know it can be frustrating being in those shoes sometimes
---
On the other hand, the Oni's ability is just way easier to use and control so someone who doesn't put the time to practice Billy (like me) can pick him up and play a lot more easily.
---
It happens occasionally. It’s not supposed to, but it does. 
---
I’ve had it happen to me a couple of times
---
They never nerf survivors. The fuck are you smoking. The only meaningful nerf they've made recently was reworking DS
---
This hasn’t been occasionally happening, it’s been happening like every other game, my friends said it’s happening often to them too but not as often as me. It used to happen everyonce in a great while but now it’s just ridiculous
---
I've never got why this is an issue? If you're playing killer then you need to spend BP to get new add ons and no matter what you're playing there's somewhere those BPs could be going to get new perks. Why do people save up 1 million and waste matches because they can't earn any more???
---
by that logic, survivors should get 2 gens, 2 unhooks, one totem, and an escape's worth of BP when the killer DC's then. That would only encourage toxicity, killers and survivors would work extra hard to get the other party to DC. This is a nice idea but bad in practice.
---
INFJ checking in, can confirm
---
He meant blood trails, about how he never sees them except on The Game map due to color blindness. Sometimes I wonder how dense people can be.
---
This died in new
---
F
---
The base mechanics of this game are flawed in the first place. So it’s tough to get it towards that ideal balance without fucking up something along the way. Honestly if it weren’t for its unique style and a very, perhaps extremely loyal playerbase, it would have been long gone.
---
Spent all afternoon and evening trying to play yesterday, nope. Go to sleep, wake up, try to play a match before work, nope. PS4 btw. 
---
This is soon going on for 24 hours.
---
So in other words "I didn't want to have a civil debate I just wanted to bully you for disagreeing with me." Yea we are done here, we can agree on that. Also nice straw man with the irrelevant downvote fixation.
---
Exactly, just have the perk equipped and hit 3 great skill checks. Also, run borrowed time for safe unhooks and be fairly aggressive about going for hooked survivors. When I did these challenges, I focused on the challenge objective and not surviving, if that makes sense. The only difficult one was the dark sense one. I brought a commodious toolbox w socket swivels and extra charges plus prove thyself and was a gen jockey. Try to do it in a swf if possible. U don't have to do the whole gen, but u do need to be the one to finish them. Hope this helps. GL HF &lt;3
---
What info?
---
This is seriously the bane of my existence. Every aura related perk for killer I have to find a flat surface and stare at it so the auras can seperate from the background in my vision. Green auras are just fine I love them, I just want a dark purple or blue color or something. Seriously they cant possibly think people will use it as a crutch right? I mean auras are SUPPOSED to be visible to the killer. I dont care if I can't see blood in the grass, that's fine Ill live without blood and can run bloodhound if need be. Just please let us change the aura colors it's impossible to see for me. Red is literally the one color I can't see well
---
This is definitely the case. Last year my step sister tried to get into the game.
---
She did really bad as survivor for about a week, got tired of dying and quit.
---
If this is what happens to every new player, the game won't last long
---
This would make the perk completely useless but with some rework of your idea thus idea could be a great perk for a future killer.
---
About where they tested the perk with safe hooks I’m just interested in their reasons
---
Oh wow 600 whole points for a guaranteed loss, yippee! 
---
if cleansing a totem gives more BP than losing a teammate early/instantly, then you probably need to bump those numbers up.
---
When I hit 1 million I spend them, I never waste matches it just would be nice to be able to save above 1 million so that you can put more points at once into the new survivor and killer when a new chapter gets released.
---
I mean look at how they fix bugs.
---
Behavior has confirmed that there will probably never be a shapeshifting killer as they say that it can be countered too easily and be to hard to code, but I keep on dreaming
---
Happened to me yesterday when I didn't pay attention during loading. Next thing I know I already got hit once. This was unusual as usually there a decent amount of time passing between loading and the killer finding you.
---
This has been happening a lot since the last patch. It's not supposed to, but it is. Sucks, but what can you do? Hope they fix it (again) soon.
---
&gt;About where they tested the perk with safe hooks I’m just interested in their reasons
---
It was during a PTB that preceded the nerf. Everyone got to test it.
---
I mean couldnt they at least do the auras?? I can't see the color red very well so I sometimes can barely see the generator auras or where my totems are. I mean that information is *supposed* to be for the killer to use.
---
Watch otzdarvas vids on him
---
They were both made before the EGC was even a thing, the only way they would ever trigger was when the gates were powered. Meaning they were never intended to activate unless all gens were finished. 
---
When the EGC was added rather than change the perks to once all gens are completed, they kept it to once once the exit gates were powered trigger, probably because of how they initially coded it into the game.
---
The devs, the community, the optimization, the grind and the balance.
---
Other than that, though-wait, also the bloodweb.
---
I'll help you, what do you play on?
---
But in case of ruin you don't get punished as much for missing great zone
---
As a killer main I disagree
---
If you're playing as Claudette, equip Empathy, which will help you see injured survivors. If you're playing as Dwight, Bond will help you find other people. Some of the challenges for survivor can seem a bit daunting if you don't play often.
---
If you're open to partying up with people, r/dbdlfg or the dbd discord might help. I'd offer to help if you were on my platform (xbox), but I'm almost red rank at the moment, which probably wouldn't be much fun for you if you don't play survivor often.
---
I share your pain, I really do. Im red-green colorblind so red auras DO NOT mix with grass. Basically green and red trigger similar cones in my eyes because my red cones just aren't as powerful as they're supposed to be so if there's any green it just gets washed out. Ill usually try to find a rock or something to stare straight at to make the background black and the red auras can be seen then. But it's such a hassle that I have to do that. I cant even use Im all ears because I lose them even with the aura
---
Ah yes, every time I see my opponent has sustained an injury, I make sure to tell him that I must break him and then sweep the leg. I can't afford to not be sweaty; games aren't about fun.
---
/s
---
Oh boi. If only you knew the history of DBD
---
Slight hint. In the first alpha versions of DBD, you could climb up walls.
---
But arent you supposed to see auras?
---
Yeah but that's points that are getting stolen from another character. I mean survivors don't really matter but as a killer you need add ons to stand a chance at higher ranks so not spending BP after a killer match on that killer means they eventually run dry.
---
It's Sunday, so people are miserible about work or school tomorrow.
---
Also apparently the servers. Gotta get their toxicity quotas fast.
---
[CONTEXT] 
---
I was being swarmed by the survs and this Jane was there and so she ds’ed me, so I chased her down then she ran straight into me. I of course killed her then she sent me this.
---
Uh, rank 1 huntress and nurse here. Nurse is still the best killer in the game. Now she just takes some thought on how you use blinks instead of spamming them. If you legitimately think she is a bad killer now, maybe you're just a bad killer player?
---
Same. Restarted 6 times (literally) and am now searching for a match which I feel will be infinite.
---
I feel either way the pat out should be equivocal and balanced.
---
So just for the mechanics, no lore behind it.
---
Yup, early I couldn't join the survivor lobby, now I just can't get in to a game at all.
---
where’s my intp solidarity?
---
i feel oppressed
---
Franklins. Im just trying to do quests damnit i dont need this shit with my medkits getting dropped.
---
I've been in a couple of games so far. Still getting error messages here and there but have been able to complete matches
---
New players get to encounter a very steep learning curve. And since matchmaking is a mess, they usually face players much more experienced than them. Add to that how unbalanced certain maps can be for one side or the other, how unfun a toxic SWF or sweaty killer with OP addons can be, and the overall negative vibe that some players give. Yep you got yourself an unwelcoming game for newcomers.
---
People can say “oh the game’s doing great. It’s growing and getting better” and I mean compared to what it was before it kind of is. But there are still glaring issues. All of the DLCs have been awesome but they haven’t brought the influx of players that is needed to sustain it well enough in the long run. I don’t know. I might be acting pessimistic. But this game can have so much more potential if its longtime problems can be fixed.
---
GF is amazing. People just hate him bc how his reveal mechanic feels like shit and how many toxic assholes play him just so they can tbag you.
---
He can do amazing at red ranks. Perhaps try some other top tiers like nurse, spirit (if you like being an ass), oni (when he comes out), hag, Freddy, billy, demo, and huntress
---
It does, and there’s an audio cue that’s even more helpful, but in the moment I’ve seen some people surprised by it.
---
Any survivor that messages the killer for anything other than pure disrespect is laughable. I only did it last week when a killer for some reason slugged me at the start of the game then stared at me on the ground without hooking me for most of 5 gens before I bled out :( Other survivors tried picking me up but I wasn't hooked so borrowed time wouldnt work. She let the other 3 go :((((((
---
oh i feel dumb now lol, i watch all of his vids
---
Should've edited out the success zone
---
Hopefully they won’t be down tomorrow
---
Before ST, last good perks came from Adam. So yeah, over a year.
---
I’ve invested thousands of hours into Nurse and made rank 1 with her every season including playing her reworked. 
---
You cannot NOT spam blinks. You kinda have this big drawback of having *less mobility than a survivor* without them.
---
Surveillance, Brutal Strength / Enduring, Ruin, Bloodhound.
---
Surveillance helps you 3-gen better by showing you when a generator you kicked gets worked on again.
---
Brutal Strength / Enduring for breaking / eating pallets. I prefer Brutal Strength.
---
Ruin to slow down the game. If it spawns near your 3 gen, even better.
---
Bloodhound to help you better track down survivors that you hit or freed themselves from a trap. You pretty much will never lose a survivor with this perk on.
---
Using the extra trap addon, you can turn the area around your 3 gen into a deadly minefield. To buy time to setup your minefield, smack nearby survivors so that they run off to heal but don’t waste time chasing.
---
Add-ons:
---
Harder disarm = helps slow down the game when survivors love to disarm your traps.
---
Trap setting speed = helps you create your minefield faster, as well as re-arm your minefield when survivors disarm your traps.
---
Dye = helps catch the unwary. Though experienced players would know where are the trap hotspots.
---
Console console console console player
---
Oh god xD
---
CURSED VISION
---
Oh then I just didnt get the reference there, my bad
---
Connection is one of the issues that makes it inconsistent
---
Well... shit.
---
*cough* bnp, insta meds, ds, bt, flashlights, healing, medkits, self care, pallets, vacuums, windows, fast vaults, BL, exhaustion, ect *cough*
---
also i would like to state, I never said any of these where not broken, the point was to show how killers complained and survivors got nerfed, it's double sided.
---
Yeah, that's right. That's me baby
---
Been happening for the best hour on PS4 for me
---
me: "The game lasted less than a minute and everyone immediately died on hooks and disconnected."
---
also me: "No one gained too many bloodpoints or anything unusual from this. I just hope no one-"
---
**that one guy:**
---
Yeah, I do question sometimes about mentality of that person.
---
Yeah, it's happening to everyone on ps still
---
Wait, most of it is STILL down? Lmao can't even be mad anymore, thats just hilarious.
---
the whole point was to show that it's some shit instagram account (that i follow because im boring) and that no one in the comments knew that she wasn't a real person.
---
Killer easiest to play? Mate ru stuck at green ranks?
---
Indeed
---
Do other online games have these issues so often? Generally curious as this is the only online game ive ever really played.
---
Nah p3 red rank rn bout to p4 lol
---
I got to play one match after many errors and it was a scratched mirror myers that put the lab........... feels bad man.
---
The bigger problem is ranking up in this game is way too easy. Even the brain dead people can reach purple/red ranks. Playing solo first week after reset is super nice, killers are brutal, but survivors who reach red ranks fast can hold their own. But after few weeks all the immersed people, or people who got carried by their way better swf friends also reach red ranks and it gets brutal, especially against billies, as he have just a field day downing everyone in seconds.
---
The problem is, you will never be able to balanced it. For the last year survivors got nothing but nerfs, because top swf groups can just shit on any killer. And they probably even could do that if all 4 people went perkless into the match against any killer. Perks are not the problem, bad map design where these perks can be abused is. Newer players don't know all the abusable windows, veterans do. Haddonfield can be easy against inexperienced players - a nightmare against experienced swf group. I mean in iron works that one window pretty much looses me all the games, because it have no counter, you can put on bamboozle, it still buys people enough time to fly through gens. If you don't tunnel or camp, people gonna be able to vault that window 8-12 times in a chase and buy what 20 extra seconds every chase. What's 2 extra gens for ya. Until bhvr fixes their terrible map design killers just gonna have bad time against veterans. And newer players getting punished for that. Like one game I can get shit on in 4 minutes, other match against same rank players on a same map people don't even manage to do 1 generator. Skill gap is just wild.
---
You should right poems
---
P4?
---
I’ve got really high ping so ruin is impossible to cope with
---
It sucks for Ash fans. Buckle Up is easily the most useless survivor perk, next to Solidarity.
---
I noticed that but I assumed I remembered incorrectly and didn't bother to check
---
gonna try to follow this thread and see if anything changes
---
Ok, please. Everyone in this community needs to learn something. 
---
Annoying 👏doesn't 👏 mean 👏 op👏
---
Noed is one of if not the shittiest designed perks in the game, it is the definition of a crutch. It's a reward for doing poorly.
---
I can already hear the "but they only used 3 perks the whole game!!!!1!!" That argument is dumb. Killers meta is based around 2 perks, BBQ and Ruin, both of you're other slots are killer/player dependent. No killer forces you to use all 4 perk slots constantly. 
---
Noed is a cheap perk that confirms a kill if you are not dumb, people also argue that adren is the same, but adren is a reward for completing you're objective. Unlike how Noed is a reward for losing.
---
He doesn’t play this game. Trust me its a kid probably 14-16 sh max.

---
My bad its butcher mask
---
Was that supposed to be funny?
---
It’s been back up for hours now. I don’t know hats going on on your end
---
Wait why is vacuums in that list? Sure the rest have an argument but why vacuums? You're playing survivor not nurse
---
Havent tested dbd in a while but according to many comments here it still doesnt work on some platforms
---
&gt; IIRC they tried a similar anti-camp mechanic in a PTB or in live a VERY long time ago, and it was quickly reverted after people were abusing it.
---
&gt;
---
&gt; IIRC they also tried making struggle infinite in duration (If you facecamp, they'll eventually hit stage 2, but you HAVE to actually hook them 2 or 3 times total to kill them) but that also didn't work out either.
---
Had no idea. It was just something I thought of off the top of my head. Thx for the info.
---
I think it's fine if you want to secure a kill at the end. The problem I have is in solo queue you don't know the killer is camping. So everyone goes to the hook assuming no one else is going for it, then when you realized oh, he's camping you've already wasted time checking the hook, and doing 5 gens in 2 mins is not really possible unless you're in an SWF. So usually it's 2 kills for free. The only way for everyone to know right away if the killer is camping or not is kindred. 
---
Even if you escape everyone gets a safety pip or a depip and no BP since no one got to do anything, which is a massive waste of time. Ya'know? Like I said to the other straw man dude. I think it's fine if you wana play like that. But at least give the survs a way to just end the game and find a new one ASAP without dcing. 
---
Thanks for being respectful. :)
---
If it takes you more than the second blink to catch up to someone, then you're not a good nurse player. There is a reason literally every killer streamer with thousands of hours still say nurse is the best. Just because you boosted yourself up to rank one by spamming blinks doesn't mean she's bad now. Downvote me all you want, that doesn't make you better.
---
It’s actual sarcasm bud.
---
That's sad
---
You can really tell the sarcasm in that message
---
I want it
---
Mom got nerfed quickly.
---
Head on is the worst exhaust perk in the game, only works wonders when a 4 swf is using it.
---
Distortion? Really?
---
Deliverance is a perk that can be removed before it can be used, often times meaning nothing. I would say it's the best perk we got tho
---
Dance with me is alright, but def not amazing.
---
Why don't we compare killers perks then?
---
Demise of the faithful: infectious, corrupt
---
Darkness among us: discordance
---
Shattered bloodline: haunted, spirit fury, and arguably rancor 
---
Curtan call: bamboozle, pop goes my brain cells
---
Notice anything different? Survivors got one perk that was almost meta, being discordance.
---
While killers got at least one per chapter, but yea I'm sure distortion is meta I just am not smart enough.
---
Oh good god you are not an og player are you
---
"but why can't he just use the chainsaw to kill???"
---
Even then, Deliverance isn't that great
---
Not too sure what the mind process was for that reply, but it doesn't seem to answer the guys question at all
---
You mean Ruin slows the game down ^just ^^a ^^little ^^^bit
---
Thanks bud, but im to far gone, you keep going though, be an actual good player unlike me LMAO
---
Right? I doubt they'll change it too but I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed!
---
Wait. Would you be checking recent players in order to tell if you're playing against the same people again? I fail to see how dodging lobbies is effective as a survivor. It's not like you can tell killer or add-ons from the lobby.
---
Yes sir!!
---

"haha it ran out of gas, you forgot to remind me, Pablo you beautiful idiot!"
---
Stealth never works after a while so I don't mind VM shininess. In fact, it's one of its main appeal for me.
---
Yeah, if I had checked recent players, I would've been able to see if it's the same guy, and leave the lobby. I don't care what killer they're playing or their add ons or if they have a Mori. I just don't want to be camped to death on first hook.
---
Theres an achievement for every killer called adept _____ for getting a merciless rating using just their 3 perks
---
Me too. While I had my personal beef with the show, I was at least happy Bruce came back to play Ash once more. I feel like AvED should continue in comics, ya know? Sorta like Army of Darkness.
---
The meme is about the blood orbs so I assumed that’s what he was talking about. Sometimes I wonder how dense people can be.
---
Me and my friend only got to play 2 matches like 2 hours ago but we never got to even finish either of them bc we all got kicked from the match from it being fucked up. It's annoying.
---
That Jeff better respect wamen now.
---
Oh shittt I didn't even notice. That is funny.
---
Depends on the killer you are using. Some killers like Huntress or Nurse you want survivors to vault windows.
---
i have flashbacks to [this](https://twitter.com/i/status/1193044990039142400) a lot. incredible how one can go from "doing okay" to "dead and gone" in 2 minutes
---
Yesterday I had a discussion about this very topic, and suggested the camped people be given safety pips, and more time on the hook so the others could do gens. But was straw manned into oblivion. 
---
Putting that aside if you keep running into people like this, yeah i'd dodge.
---
That's one **happy** Trappy boi right there.
---
Any legion cosplay will get upvotes
---
I play Freddy and Michael but I don’t often vault windows
---
Totally, ash is a cool character, even more in ash vs the evil dead, also ashy slashy as a cosmetic is the best thing they could have done
---
I would argue that WGLF is technically the most useless since it does nothing in game, I think solidarity can be decent though
---
Camping takes legit no skill or gameplay. So many people support it because they'd rather not play the game and just ruin the fun of DBD for everyone else. It's amazing playing against a killer who actually knows how to play the game, win or lose. Campers just don't know how to play and don't care to learn. If they were any good they'd know that they get many more bloodpoints for actually playing. So would everyone else. Campers are just trolls with no skill who waste everyone's time, including their own.
---
Photoshop.
---
Or just use MSPaint, no one's gonna judge if you fully cross names with a black pen.
---
I completely agree with your idea. It's so frustrating. Especially when the camping is seemingly random and undeserved.
---
I had Ace losing his hat and shades.
---
And a Meg with her pony tail.
---
Especially in Japan.
---
It’s something a lot of other game devs will do when their customers are inconvenienced. Feeling entitled to bloodpoints if the game is down for an hour is dumb but PS4 players like me are going on 15+ hours of the game being down.... not able to earn any points today. Kinda feel like something for their issues would be justified lol.

It'll be great once the PTB changes go to live. PTB kindred shows you auras personally if someone else is hooked on top of what it already does. Makes it so much easier to go for a save or just stay put on your gen.
---
Okay yeah, thats understandable
---
If anyone actually cares, I have 12 other screenshots from the conversation, that were just completely funny because it was like it was written by a five year old yelling at me.
---
I choose to believe this was staged for my own sanity.
---
He is like billy but you have to work for his power and his power is just freaking awesome!
---
There's hundreds of tweets on twitter saying otherwise... I guess it's just a huge coincidence.
---
holy shit i thought i was the only one. i got the swamp twice in a row earlier, logged off to do some work and get lunch, and when i came back to grind challenges it put me in the swamp AGAIN. also with legion.
---
Kettle changed from any hit to protection hits. Essentially, originally you just got a free hit for getting hit, punishing M1 killers who suffered while not affecting the actually good killers too much.
---
Once upon a time, Borrowed Time applied on the savior too. However, it's overall stronger now imo, as back then it had a single use a game and was a timer and not Deep Wounds.
---
Before: a delayed down on both people once a game that you can't really control.
---
Now: essentially a free hit on just the saved survivor up to 6 uses.
---
Hmmmm it's rank 1 killer
---
😢 mai bebe
---
Exactly, but the response is always... 
---
bUt ThE kIlLeR isN't ReSpOnSiBlE fOr YoU'RE fUn! But who said they are? Rewarding survivors for dealing with this crap is the same as banning people for it? No. You can play how you want, but in my opinion this boring play style should be disincentivized, not banned.
---
I play both sides and I still think it's lame.
---
The same can happen if 3 survivors instantly DC and the last guy yeets down into the hatch, or all 4 survivors kill themselves on hook.
---
If the killer is not an invisible Wraith, crouched Pig or is facing a wall, you can farm evader emblem.
---
either staged, or below rank 15.
---
Explain?
---
No. Just no
---
Absolutely well said. Agree completely. This skill gap is also why some survivors claim killers are OP. They think there's no way to counter them
---
I've already repeated myself multiple times to you, in a simplified format. With examples. You say "3 more seconds" but yes, 3 seconds is a big deal, also all the extra time you are wasting because you can be walking and more often will be walking longer than 3 seconds to hook any survivor including husks. Which your example does not include the many more other situations husks are gonna cause. I would like the game to remove the person who gave up, and give you the points - equivalent to enough that doesn't force you to only be able to black pip. Enough that you can black pip, but have a chance to pip and/or double pip.
---
I never said they weren't implementing the system. I also play on the PTB. I also said i'm glad their implementing the system.
---
Again. It's not the killers fault that a survivor decides to DC, and it's not the killers job to work with survivors. It's their job to go against the survivors.  If the/a survivor(s) decide they want to throw the entire game for them-self and their team. The killer should not be punished in any way for doing so. S/he is not even apart of that team.
---
Just checking to say if this is a bot that automatically replies with the copypasted message
---
I can’t get the 3 gens thing. Either I’m running the killer around or my team is literally dying before I can get a gen done.
---
Seems accurate
---
This is cursed and I love it

It’s been all fucky for me tonight

The real question is... Do you watch hentai?

Legit couldnt. Every personni tried with would just run away and self heal or run headfirst into the killer.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) You can't say that not except me to wana see the salt.
---
ok so, vacuums are an old term, before pallets where nerfed, you used to be able to run up to a pallet, and instead of having to wait till you are on the other side of the pallet to be able to throw it, you used to just be able to run up to it and clip to the other side and throw it. 
---
making loops amazingly strong just bc you would teleport to the safe side of the pallet every time
---
Dedicated servers force you to have a delayed generator / pallet breaking action plus teleporting you into position.
---
Me: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
you don't understand
---
i'm so nosy
---
Thanatophobia, sloppy, nurses and ruin
---
Also basic chase builds like spirit fury, enduring, ruin and a 4th perk of your choosing
---
That’s true, it doesn’t absolutely nothing in game. But the blood point bonus makes it very worth it, while Buckle Up is so situational and almost completely useless. Solidarity is a bit better, but it only saves you about 8 seconds.
---
I was thinking of this, hell i'd even go for a simple chainsaw or shotgun back cosmetic
---
Since before freddy
---
Edit: was watching gameplay before that
---
Thanks for telling me
---
i wish i was a nurse like that.
---
she is hard to play on mobile but im practicing still
---
1. Even without the teachables I dont want there are a bunch of basic perks I also dont care about. Brings the total to a lot more than 12 bloodwebs, especially if you factor in the character you're playing havinf a teachable you dont want, that takes up one of youe possible perk slots every single level. Personally, I think if you miss a teachable, it should just be gone. 
---
2. BHVR can work on what they want to? They don't have to do 100% bug fixes and new characters. QoL changes are a part of a healthy game development too.

Why not wrong poems?
---
vacuum pallets get removed, making loops much more unsafe, making pallets a weaker resource.
---
Idk about you but that sounds like a nerf to me. Ofc i know it was a fix, but it was a nerf no matter how you look at it.  i literally said that most of these things deserved to be changed
---
How?
---
Stick it out. Trust me it gets funnier and more badass
---
the BL bandaid is gonna peal off really quickly when people realize that it does almost nothing to fix pantry and haddon, and when people realize that SB is legit just BL but better so people will be able to run the buildings more.
---
can we get a supernanny chapter
---
Because she is harder to play/master now?
---
Nurse players who think the minor rework she received changed her place on the tier list weren’t very good Nurse players
---
Who hurt you
---
No, as in you using selfcare,
---
I shoulda said that differently tbh
---
first hit counted as a "suprise" attack even though you were chasing her for a solid 10 seconds before hitting her?
---
It specifies healing other survivors
---
CHUN-KY!
---
I don't get it... explain please OP?
---
My friend is able to play killer.
---
These are some shit pills then
---
Weird, it usually should say 
---
"Completely heal 2 health states using the perk empathy"
---
as in it doesnt matter who you heal, important is you heal
---
You don't have to think I'm more credible because I don't really give a shit. I just know if you think she's bad now you're either delusional and want to have something to complain about or shit with her. She's still undoubtedly the best killer when put into good hands. Probably one of the worst when played by someone below average.
---
tickets unlock characters for a limited time. you can unlock the teachables of that character during that limited time so that it becomes available for other survivors and/or killers, if you get the character to that specific level to unlock the teachable that is.
---
Boop the snoot, you get the chute
---
Yet it had 5 downvotes last time I checked... Wow. People are too sensitive on here.
---
How did you manage to pull that off??
---
Lullaby, ruin, unnerving presence and distressing coupled with unlimited terror radius and the game offering
---
Or just an anti depip safety for all the players involved in the game, would lead to less toxic chat and people would keep playing.
---
NOED is annoying but calling it a reward for failure--as is common--is ridiculous with the current state of the game. At least 8/10 games it goes one of two ways: all but one dead before the last gen is done, or the last gen pops with everyone still alive.
---
If it's the latter, there's a good chance they are a ridiculously organized team that completes gens at a rate that makes it mathematically impossible to win. It's been shown again and again that even if you end chases as fast as you possibly can and make no mistakes, it *still* isn't enough to gain the upper hand against an optimal team.
---
So no, all gens being finished is not reserved for "bad killers", you can be literally one of the best players in the world and still have the match come down to the wire. In most cases, when the gates are powered it's game over. The killer might be able to squeeze out a couple more hooks, but they're not going to "win" without camping or slugging, and even that's difficult to do against a whole team.
---
NOED is a gamble: you're playing with three perks for the whole game so that in exchange for the game being potentially saved at the very end, and it's a hex that can be destroyed before it even activates.
---
Using Adrenaline doesn't make you good (you can hide from the killer and do nothing all game while your team does gens) and using NOED doesn't make you bad, it's all in how you play.
---
r/dbdgonewild is right next to this sub.

How have you got dbd to run on a chrome book? I thought it you wasn’t able to download it on one.

Emblems are a broken system just like when we used to rank up based on score.

I don't have a solution to give, I'm just thankful ranking up doesn't actually matter beyond bragging rights and harder matches.
---
theyve been
---
Lol how? I’m saying I’m bad but can still work through ruin there’s no reason people should refuse to do gens until a perk is gone it’s not hard focus the gens and if you come across ruin then destroy it
---
It's ending?
---
Ah yes, the hillbilly but ancient and a better pwyf, enduring 2.0 and rancor
---
Playing right now
---
Oof, yea that is actually the one with other survivors.
---
I do recommend talking to your mates in pre-game chat, it's worth a shot
---
Communication can mean a lot, worked for me with the safe unhook challange
---
They've stopped working on it and the servers will likely go down at the end of the year.
---
Yay, thank you both! Once I realized why I couldn't get in, I haven't tried again.
---
This isnt a discussion on how fast gens are, if you are having issues at high ranks with gen speeds, bring pop instead of NOED. 
---
If you are playing a top tier killer (EX: Nurse, Spirit, Freddy, Billy, Oni and possibly hag and huntress) you have everything in your kit to beat a good team. you dont need an extra boost at end game to confirm another kill.
---
If you get looped all game as a top tier, thats on you. You have the kit and the power to slow gens and end chases, and its up to you to be the better player.
---
If you are playing a lower ranked killer, i can agree that NOED is fine, but i do think other perks would be better.
---
Adren is only given to you after you do every gen, if the killer cant kill anyone when someone is in the corner of the map the whole game, once again, thats on the killer. 
---
you cant argue that NOED is just handed to you for doing poorly, bc it literally is. You failed to do your job which is to kill the survivors so you are given an extra chance. Adren does feel cheep sometimes, but at least its linked to survivors only objective.
---
Imagine being so upset over a collection of pixels on a social media site
---
See I can say stupid shit too.
---
Man you’ve never gone against a halfway decent Spirit, have you?
---
FEEL MY PIPE
---
I think it's more common on PC than other platforms because I'm pretty sure that only the PC version of the game has post-game chat whereas you have to go out of your way to find someones username and send them a message on console.
---
You didn\`t read my post carefully enough to make that stupid reply
---
1. Yeah I know that opening a gate isn\`t a DC. Btw you can\`t open the gates a killer anytime... I pointed out that survivors have the easy way out by killing themselves on their first hook. Why don\`t have killers the opportunity to open the gates? As it stands DCing ist the only way for a killer to leave the game early
---
2. I got all kinds of salty/bragging messages from killers before. I said that you nearly every game a killer DCs atleast 1 (most of the time the 2 man swf) write "gg ez baby killer" (and that on the steam profile too). As it stands right now I have never seen a killer write "gg ez baby survivor" when a survivor DCs...
---
This time you should read the post as it is not as you want it to be. I won\`t write this a third time
---
As someone who never plays pig, how would it?

Guessing from his reddit history, because he doesn't know how to play her.

I ain't even upset over a picture just calling OP out on his ridiculous bullshit. Oh no someone pushed the control button. "Waaaaaa. ToXiC." Y'all are a bunch of pansy ass bitches for real. Man the fuck up kiddo. They pushed a button IN A GAME. They didn't skull fuck your mom after running a train on your sister.
---
You say you are surprised, but how did you qualify them?
---
There*
---
Michael Moris, Bubba eats.
---
Not ime
---
You’re playing a swf against one of the weakest killers, if you get caught you deserve a 1 hook
---
Interesting concept, but I’m not sure how balanced a gun would be. Upvoted in hopes that it gets a conversation going in the community
---
LOL, EXACTLY! Always nice to see other people in this sub agree that immersed players are the worst part of the playerbase.
---
These people inevitably get found when they go against killers who aren't braindead and then proceed to go down before anyone has time to get anything done.
---
It appears that you lack the experience of nurse to play her well.
---
Introduce a flopped game to a more successful to try make DBD die off

---
Don’t sent them a message just move on, most of the time I get a message I just laugh and try to trigger them even more
---
I wouldn't consider 2 people a SWF. My friend looped the Leatherface for a good amount of time so stop being an ass hole. I'd love proof that you can loop weaker killers for 5 gens, dickhead.
---
Scrap it altogether and make a new perk that has the same energy but better execution.
---
Like maybe you stand still staring at a Survivor you can stalk them and later on activate undetectable for X amount of time.
---
Who is it? Closest I can see is Zeus from the Hercules movie from the 90's.
---
Problem is some people play this as a race others play it as a horror movie. 
---
Take tunneling for an example in a competitive game it's an exploite one side can abuse ot gives the other side no chance to win. But in a horror movie it is the whole point killing the opent and posting them in a disadvantage.
---
Just play the way you have fun dont worry about all others.
---
Then again devs refuse to fix some of the stuff that still linger in the game and use "priorities" as an excuse.
---
Go fuck yourself.
---
Why do I need to stalk to get a chance to use my ability when I could just play as the two stalkers we already have and knock the whole team with Michael.
---
Not that much but it’s a good idea
---
What’s a safety pip
---
First of relax I wasn’t crying like you are, no need to be rude. 2 man is a SWF, simple. If you want proof add my steam(same as reddit)I’ll run you or your friend on any killer you want.
---
The follow up before I even replied, who hurt you?
---
monkaS
---
For the dying animation they should just start the end game menu in the sec u get on it last hook
---
Killer has 2 objectives.
---
1st objective sacrifice survivors to the entity.
---
2nd protect gens and stop the progression of the trial to keep survivors there longer to achieve the first objective.
---
There are less desirable ways to achieve the goal of sacrifice such as a hard tunnel or face camp. As these tend to be less fun especially for the victim and unless on a coordinated team is pretty hard to counter.
---
This being said when the gens are done and a trial is nearing an end your only goal left is to kill. At this point if you have a survivor on the hook and so desire you protect that and maybe even get a second or a late game wipe.
---
What you do at the end is up to you but defending a sacrifice at endgame is valid and if you feel it is your best strategy at the point go for it.
---
The beauty is every trial plays out different so adapt and kill.
---
Good luck in the fog.
---
What are u ?
---
Jk but in an argument its gd to know what side your bias is.
---
Detective's Hunch is so much better, especially the new version that procs for you when any generator is completed and reveals exact locations at range and works with maps if you want to bring one.
---
If your team isn't popping enough generators for you to get all five totems, you're either going to die or have to escape through the hatch anyway, but unlike Small Game you don't have to wander aimlessly for a short-range perk, just pick two or three positions to proc it from.
---
Sure Hunch doesn't reveal traps, which is a nice thing to know about when facing Hag or occasionally (but rarely) a bush-heavy Trapper (though admittedly Trapper tends to be more obvious and limited than Hag, and he's really weak in so many ways that it barely matters whether you step into a trap and get second-hooked anyway)...
---
But it's better in all the other ways.
---
Does anybody have any tips on hitting decisive strike on PS4? I can never hit a decisive. I swear on my life I time so perfectly but it always hit the very end of the skill check. I am very good on hitting great skill checks on anything. I think decisive is just messed up on PS4.

Probably overkill, but maybe rework Mettle or Buckle Up into his boomstick. Would it be OP? Maybe, but if there was a timer or some ridiculously hard activation, it could work.

3 o clock doctor lullaby skillchecks
---
Ah yes a Buster Scruggs meme
---
With unnerving hell yeah
---
Not to mention that Ghostface really does make excellent (ab)use of the fact that at best there's one pallet near most generators and plenty of cover to approach completely unheard and unseen, most people don't see Wraith coming due to walls either.
---
You can just stalk them, it's almost impossible to reveal a leaning Ghostface (or any Ghostface since the window is so short and detection is so buggy, stalk doesn't decay, but reveal can be completely reset by crouching or strafing) and hit them, he's an ambush killer who never has to chase without any meaningful downsides, is really good at proxying or camping, and gets to be stealthy/sneaky with none of the downsides of EW1 Myers, crouching Pig, cloaked Wraith, or phasing Spirit.
---
\+ He can hear generators to know where to prepare to stalk if they're being repaired, throw in a few slow down perks and you should be 4king without a sweat.
---
Imoossible Claudettes never work on gens!
---
Right?? Personally, survivor is way more fun to play than killer. But I have to play at least 2 killer games with BBQ a day if I want to keep progression going. It’s pretty annoying, I wish WGLF also got tokens from finished health states or gens.
---
I get SWF is can get annoying, and should probably be looked at but I'm pretty sure people just wana have a good time with their friends... You deem that worth of a face camp?
---
Also how do you know what killer you're going up against before the game?
---
Two year BPS freeze, Giant survivors. Models still protruding from lockers, year long Freddy rework, three year nurse rework, inaccurate hit boxes, additive counter-balancing, no prestige options for any cosmetics besides base. Near impossible rift teirs, no reward for ranking. Legion knife bug. That's just the bottom of the barrel 
---
I still like the game though.
---
They should make devotion increase the bloodpoint cap so that there’s something meaningful that comes out of devotion at level 100
---
Don't think doc is scared of anything he's just fucked in every way
---
There are some really mean Legion builds that make use of Iridescent Button and Filthy Blade. Forget getting generators done when Legion is going to be keeping everyone in Deep Wound for longer than it takes to mend, be ready to use it again before you even finish, and can stall out the game indefinitely with Ruin/Dying Light/Pop/etc.
---
Jigsaw Tape looks like Rules Set No. 2's nerfed version. Please, no
---
I didn’t know you can stun killer with a closet!
---
Actually want that as a killer
---
Unlucky man, just keep at it, maybe msg the other survs beforehand and tell them you're trying to do it
---
I tried one of the builds from Otzdarva and its working great so far: Corrupted Intervention, A nurses calling, Surge, Surveillance
---
Well this is getting taken down anyway. You're supposed to block out player's names that aren't yours.
---
its fucking crazy that the devs legit have not added ANY settings to the game. Like imagine having one of the most played games on steam for 3 years and not adding actual options. All you have is resolution and quality. actually a fucking joke.
---
You can legit edit the quality urself in the game files so its not like they cant add it. its crazy that they have not added any color blind options either.
---
The biggest rule with nurse is always be blinking. If you're not blinking, you're wasting time. In the right hands she's still a dominating force. These were.... not the right hands, clearly.
---
You killed a bunch of immersed survivors with NoEd. So what?
---
Or just make one animation where his chainsaw hand is down when he's repairing a generator.
---
I agree, it should be just 4 sacrifices
---
😂thank u literally forgot to add something
---
yea, you cant really spam blinks anymore thankfully. but god it kills me to see some nerd float towards me when i have no where to run, if i throw the pallet she hits me, if i run from the pallet she hits me, ect.
---
I think it's a super cool-sounding idea, and I love the concept of it!
---
However, I don't think it would really work very well in-game. Unlike survivors, which mostly have one true objective (gens) they're constantly working on, killer is constantly doing stuff and all over the place. In a chase, running to hook, running to kick a gen, looking for survivors, blocking a totem/exit, etc.
---
I think giving killers another thing they have to spend time working on / seeking out would not be very balanced as it would make playing killer even more of a constant rush, especially if the survivor benefits were strong.
---
That would be good.
---
What a dumbass lmaoooooo
---
The main point is that it stops;
---
DCs when losing to spitefully deny the killer points/emblems/stacks of BBQ/information.
---
DCs to give people a tactical advantage, like "oh the killer's near me and now the hatch is open instantly so free escape for you with no counter, -2 kills for the killer."
---
If this was a bug then I don't think they test their releases at all... lol   
---
Would explain a lot of the bugs they recently introduced
---
I understand how frustrating it is not being able to see auras and scratch marks when it is so integral to doing well as killer in this game, but it seems everyone who is colorblind is overstating the importance of blood. Even as someone who is not colorblind, i rarely (if ever) notice blood on the floor in or out of a chase. The scratch marks and sounds of survivors are much more important. The only time i can think of where I’m actively looking for blood is when i have sloppy butcher and they stop running while out of LoS during chase or possibly at the foot of a locker. Blood isn’t the biggest factor for tracking, rather than scratch marks, sound, and intuition. However, it is ridiculous not being able to see scratch marks and auras, and BHVR definitely need to address it.
---
It is actually not bad at all!!! Good idea!
---
That said, nobody that WOULD run BBQ isn't doing so *in case* a DC denies them a stack.
---
Aye check it out now
---
You're clearly a survivor main that's barely touched killer.
---
Thank you I’m posting fan art soon and the description of the perks + weapon so stay tuned.
---
i've been playing before they added an icon to show u can get 1-shot and even i thought exposed meant this
---
Its scott, he wouldve decked you perkless
---
Any killer can catch a survivor running in a straight line in 8 seconds and your idea to balance it is make the killer faster and remove the only elements that make the survivor faster?
---
So any killer would grab any survivor in 5 seconds, they may have defeated them all by 2 minutes
---
It's true that it'll make the gameplay quicker...
---
They can be affected (and they are) by fps drops thought
---
Coming out of the closet stuns the killer for only 3 seconds, while it can last up to a whole lifetime for your parents
---
Playing a weak killer against a SWF isnt smart in most cases, however SWFs complaining about a killer camping whilst they had the up most advantage is out right stupid.
---
... I'm talking about making killer SLOWER and removing pallets
---
I play at a stable 144fps and get no framedrops but the red line in the skillchecks will still randomly be anywhere from 20 to 100 fps.
---
They're consistent though, if the first skill check is smooth all of them will be, if the first skill check is laggy all of them will be. Weird stuff
---
Oh god this goddamn meme again
---
I wish DBD had walkie talkies like FT13th so I could just tell the other survs to fuck off and let me die in peace.
---
I’ve always found we’ll make it to be surprisingly meta in red ranks

Pretty much lmao. Dont come to rescue them while i still havent got them fully on the hook.
---
Definitely, although that's a different matter entirely.
---
You should just accept it rank 20's are fricking hilarious
---
it's a meme
---
laugh
---
As a biology student and an avid dbd player, it’s really disappointing that they haven’t addressed this. So many males play video games and SO MANY males are also colorblind, so idk why they can’t fix this and expand their market. It’s kinda sad
---
BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL
---
They did?
---
Ouch. Sadly a lot of new players who bought this game will experience issues.
---
Dedicated servers had run into full kaput. You'll have to wait until they fix this, and yes this issue still persists and they're not running too good even.
---
man killers can't even hook someone at this rank
---
Surely it'd be a hack because they didn't panic in the slightest. They know they can't get stabbed
---
Yes, people are already using low res to make it easier to see. You will bet this will be abused
---
To the op, no.
---
Just like nurse and legion, that perk was gutted for a reason.
---
For doing nothing but saving someone ( easy to do, happens every game, is safe af) you can destroy a killers momentum because he, managed to make you, stuff up. But is punnished with a whiff and gets to watch you sprint off to the next god loop.
---
It is a stupid perk with a stupod design and can't be balanced in a way that will make survivors like it, but be fair to the killer. Even the update to protection hits is going to make this perk an extreme annoyance after the update.
---
tbh hatch escapes can be really annoying but I rarely see them happen so it's not enough for me to pitch a fit. I had a Freddy one time who had been slugging all game and he was slugging for the 4k (btw he was trying to mindgame badham basement house pallet, but around the stairs instead of in the locker room) and I ended up finding hatch midchase. my boy ace who was about to bleed out got up with adrenaline and got the door and the Freddy pitched a FUCKING fit. like yeah dude, I know, it's annoying, but just gg and next game please.
---
I’m convinced at this point it’s a bug and they don’t know how to fix it. At least update the achievement description. All of the achievements on killer side are ridiculous and require a ton of games using that one killer.

Not every player is good as you, we all are learning and dont say you have only 100hr in game and still better than me, everyone has different learning speed, different playstyle, different weakness. Btw you were the one who were rude. Chill man, no need to shame anyone, we got it you are good.
---
"kIlLeR wOnT gEt HoOk PoInTs"
---
Congrats, you fucked yourself, your team and the killer over. Now nobody is happy
---
That was close
---
lol the downvotes tho. Like if you've said something criminal
---
What?  You DON'T get 100 shocks per game as Doctor?  Fucking amateur...
---
BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL
---
I mean that shit after a few game gets tiring to the point where I slowdown and sometimes I realize I didn’t slowdown and then I die.
---
I wasn’t rude in the slightest, then he instantly started crying and cursing. Shows the kinda of people you are. No one said anything about playtime.
---
This is the groovy content I come here for
---
And once you get on the hook 2 of them crouch near you as the killer goes away. They wait for god knows what reason until when the killer rounds back to your hook, both of them come towards your hook, one of them unhook you, and they run away without bodyblocking for you, and you get instadown again.
---
That or the killer facecamps you because they're a sore loser for being looped that long.
---
'Belgian death metal' Hmm, I know what's next on my playlist at work.
---
Think I'll have to play some Doctor when I get home. Who can say no to that laugh?
---
He's wearing a power glove?
---
Link to original shirt?
---
Ha, no.
---
Youtube video called Hazbin Hotel.
---
My bad, but you were mean saying you should get 1 hook if you messed up in looping.
---
I would be he was taken by the entity
---
I know they’re a pain but they’re all achievable, I had plenty of 4K as Michael but never had enough points for the adept

In a swf? Clearly killer was struggling. Too many snowflakes. Tell them the truth they overreact and cry.
---
Our game already has hooks and a blackjack player so why even bother
---
are u sure it was a nancy? cause she doesnt have any blue tops. she has blue jeans tho
---
I told someone recently that he/she shouldn't EZ someone, since I find it rude and the killer was rank 13 against green and purple ranks. I mean yes, that dude was camping hard and all, but damn, those two surv where so salty in post game chat that I just couldn't defend their anger. Like... what the fuck, dude.
---
Of cause it ended with "lol I can EZ who ever I want EEEEEZZZ".
---
Omg! My heart!
---
and it seems at higher ranks my hex totem has a neon sign pointing towards it, 20-15 it may as well be invisible and anything lower than that and it starts spawning in survivor's pockets and gets clensed instantly.
---
Cocky survivors that do that last gen in your face because they have adreniline.
---
Don't get me wrong, I would do it to, but damn does it bring out my inner demon.
---
Actually, according to the game lore entity along with campfire is a personal hell or some sort of purgatory for survivors. They all died a long time ago and now their souls are all doomed to be tortured and killed for the end of the ages. Space where they inhabit called  *Realms of The Entity that appears to be nothing more but an illusion.* This game actually has lore you know...
---
Are you on ps4? This crap kept annoying me until I swapped it to the touchpad (Button in the middle of the controller). The travel time is half of the normal face buttons, so it’s a lot easier to spam. Just tap it on the corners.
---
I’d kill for a taco right now tbh
---
Damn, looks great as heck. The idea of having locked characters playable for a limited time, so you can try them and decide wether to buy them or not is kinda juicy
---
I agree. Spamming the button hurts my wrist, so while I do stay up as long as possible, sometimes I got to stop because it's a sharp pain shooting through me. Like, imagine trying to mash X, but with a needle in your wrist that bounces around.
---
Why are there no accessibility options for this? It can't be that hard to make "hold button to struggle" option, would it?
---
Doritos locos taco ftw.
---
It's like they did something great when they beat your Legion on Rotten Fields.
---
I loved it because, three hours in, instead of posting about the servers being down, they instead decided to post fan art

That's hella wierd,I never encountered anything like that.And I've leveled a couple of survs up to 30 at this point.Good to know,thank you.

This is taken from the VoD of the stream this game was part of. Otzdarva is an above average killer player, but not a great one. I haven't watched him other than clips posted here and there and this VoD, but I could do a match review to give you an idea of why I think that. I don't have to see a lot to be able to tell how good someone is, I have watched and played too much DbD, and he makes pretty basic mistakes pretty frequently from what I've seen, and for this Doc game specifically, it shows that he doesn't have a great grasp of how to use shocks in chases. There were a handful of situations primarily around both bus and shack in which he could have all but guaranteed hits had he used his shock, or used it timely enough.
---
On top of that, gens weren't even very quick to be done: the third gen popped around the 3 minute mark, when 3 gens can optimally be done in around one and a half minutes. He did apply pressure, but he did not capitalize upon that pressure properly. Early game he kept switching targets too much instead of committing to ending a chase, which would have allowed him to hook a survivor close to the generator they were pressuring with multiple people, then defending both that gen and the hook. Dashing out hits on people regularly just does not create as much of a stall or pressure as having someone out of the game entirely (that is, actually downing them to slug them or put them on a hook), and having other survivors try to challenge the hook, which most of the time they will, especially if there's a far-progressed gen around there as well. He then hooked survivors away from gens once he did down them. Later, he had a situation he could have very well won off of: 1 person on a hook in the corner of the map, one person slugged in close proximity to that hook, and one other person injured. This is where you try to control the hook and slug, to win off of this situation, or at the very least to secure kills that then more likely escalate into more kills. He opted instead to pick the slugged survivor up without even as much as checking the perimeter for a second, which shows scratchmarks leading to the hook.
---
His builds are usually more gimmicky, often using subpar perks, not always using Ruin and other meta staples. He is not someone that tunnels, camps or slugs very hard, he does not use the strongest killers and/or add-ons often, he doesn't like to play very "mean". In this game specifically, he was playing Doc without add-ons, which truly is one of if not the weakest killer in the game, he needs an add-on to increase his shock range at the very least (base shock range should be increased). And yet as the numbers show, he still kills a lot more survivors than he has escape. Where is the problem? If "doing gens" is easy, and "doing gens" is all it takes to end games ridiculously fast and win ridiculously easily, how are these numbers possible? No less from a player that is "only" decent, plays weaker killers, with weaker perks and add-ons, not employing optimal winning strategy. If he should never get survivors that do gens efficiently and escape quickly, how are his 4ks justified in which only 1-3 gens get done and he ends the game fast himself? He has games like that without Ruin too. But in those cases people just say he is a good killer. Maybe good survivors exist too? That win fair and square against him because he does not play well enough? Maybe if we nerf survivors so much that games like this aren't possible any longer, good killer players or even just decent ones that use strong stuff and employ strong strategy will win 99% of their matches rather than the 80+% they do now? Maybe in the reality of public matches, killers aren't underpowered?
---
People frequently complain about survivor "death squads", but they are exceedingly rare. Most of the people that complain just are not good enough, and thus think the survivors they face are that good. I guarantee that if I put a player of my choice against the very same lobby one of those complaining players thought were infinitely unbeatable bullies, that player would wipe the floor with them while talking calmly to their chat.
---
The average player is so bad they in fact do not even manage to do gens efficiently, i. e. don't even fulfil the bare minimum requirement to play this game, and of course they don't last more than 20 seconds in chases against competent killers either, let alone make smart or even just reasonable macrogame decisions. If you watch decent or even just mediocre killers play, they win most of their games in red ranks, and only rarely actually 0k. Good killers and killers that "tryhard" win the vast vast majority of their games. I can give you countless streams of people you will soon grow bored of watching play killer because they are barely ever even challenged, winning hours upon hours on end day after day. And statistically, the game is killer-sided at all ranks globally as well, and even the statistically worst-performing killer characters average more than 2 kills in red ranks.
---
And yet the forums are still chock-full of people screaming survivors are unbeatably OP and it's insane how imbalanced it is and we need tremendous survivor nerfs, nerf all viable survivor perks because they don't even need perks, but you need Moris to stand a chance in red ranks, and more such ridiculous statements. They are not "up in arms" about the stuff you mentioned, most of the online presence for this game is full of ranting about how OP and toxic survivors are, day in and day out. The reality is that if we nerf survivor more (which has been happening consistently for 2 years now, and continues to happen) and keep releasing killers like Legion in its original state and Spirit, the game will start to die. Solo survivor is already hardly enjoyable anymore. (To note: There are definitely still things on the survivor side that should be changed, but likewise on the killer side.)
---
Yes, generators can be finished too quickly in theory - so what does it mean that despite that, killers still outperform survivors statistically, and that there are numerous killer players that rarely ever lose, but 3-4k 80+% of their matches? If that is already the case now, how would things look like if you what, doubled gen times, reduced pallets, removed strong windows, nerfed DS, BT, Adrenaline, all Exhaustion perks, buffed all killers that aren't Nurse or Spirit, and so forth, like people often call for? (Many of the weaker killers could very well do with buffs, but that doesn't mean good players don't already win in red ranks with these killers, they do, frequently.)
---
No, you can't play "fair" against a group of survivors that actually do gens efficiently, you can't chase and hook everybody 3 times, alternating targets constantly, you have to tunnel, camp and slug, you have to employ different tactics to win, strategically and situationally. And yes, using certain perks helps a lot. If you use perks like Make Your Choice and I'm All Ears and barely get value out of them all game, of course that is not conducive to winning. I do think killers should not be as incentivized to use Ruin (mind you, there are players that do not use Ruin and still win consistently in red ranks), and would like if the spotlights were removed from generators, as well as their spawn locations randomized more, but either way, these perks exist, strong add-ons exist, effective tactics exist, and good players that win the majority of their matches exist, and they use all of these things to do so. Maybe add-onless Doc with gimmicky perks and not employing effective strategy played by someone that's "only" decent should not win against a group of decent survivors that actually play effectively.
---
you havent seen it?? because i have, its the finest repost, the return of the king some might say.
---
downvote.
---
This sounds dumb, but you did unlock those perks, right?
---
Happy cake day!
---
Ahhh i see you are man of culture as well.
---
4ks: 10 0ks: 4
---
It's legit no camping. You don't even lose Emblem Points if another Survivor is nearby.
---
More like Corrupt Intervention  
---
It does say a lot though that the 'meta' builds at the moment are much more focused on slowing down the game than lethality. The good killers are good because they can end chases quickly. Other killers that have slowdowns or map control in their kit, and would usually use perks that increase their lethality cant really do so, because they just get genrushed
---
That is so annoying. You just get your game RUINed because some blendette can’t put on borrowed when she wants to go for saves.
---
It’s still viable imo. An extra 16 seconds is decently valuable
---
Shame that they're ending the game, it's so much fun imo. But yeah they could definitely add him in DBD.
---
god i just got it on legion again as my first game. are you cursed? did you pass your curse on to me?
---
nerf gen speeds and the problem will fix itself.  
---
Killers dont like having to run this shit every game either
---
That's what it seemed like, it was happening all game.
---
I mean he literally stated that lag spikes fuck him up so... I don’t think it’s because he’s lazy.
---
Before he was taken, am I right to assume he took you off Chrome OS?...
---
Those already exist
---
Damn I wish I would’ve leveled up quicker when I started. I started right before Bill was added, but since I was knew it took me a lot longer to get bp (since I sucked lol) so I never got those. Now I have to grind just to get bt. Got unbreakable from shop tho
---
if you feel breathing down your neck, you better prepare your crack

Why rework when you can nerf a perk?

Still love this show

---
I rarely teabag, but you can bet your ass that I teabagged to my heart's content against a camping, tunnelling, insidious, noed bubba.
---
Jesus dude it sure as hell *sounds* like you're upset.
---
New killers camping is because they don’t understand the game. They don’t understand the emblem system. I never said SWF means you’re a good survivor, but being in a SWF gives you a advantage over the killer as 80% time it’s on comms
---
Decisive strike is kind of in that vein, isn't it?
---
No because it only works if they pick you up.  And you only get to use it use once.  There really should be something.
---
No she had the grunts and everything
---
There's no way they're hitting that window 8 times in a single chase lol.
---
That Just means you came back from the future, saw the conversation and didn't have a change of opinion, which means you haven't changed at all.
---
Well its good, unhooking yourself activates decisive strike and if you want to be even more cheeky you can put on unbreakable too so no matter what happens you can escape your first hook
---
Nope, because SWF could be misusing it to fuck up the killer. I think its fine as it is.
---
Yea DBD Reddit suffers from high blood pressure from all that salt over a tbag.
---
How do?
---
My first stolen meme! I'm honored, but also angry that he got more upvotes.

You lied to me Pablo-Ash Willams

So.

Until you realise the killer has Pop
---
If your fps drop during the skill check you have no time to react to it and you will fail it
---
As a nurse main, I couldn't agree more.
---
Deliverance isn’t great, as you can just wait to get unhooked. Only situation it’s good is if you’re getting hard camped by a LF.
---
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER THAN THE SPIRIT, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER THAN THE SPIRIT 
---
, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER THAN THE SPIRIT 
---
 , YOU WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER THAN THE SPIRIT
---
Right but sometimes you just *won't* get saved, and also if your teammates don't need to take the time to come and unhook you then that's more time they can spend working on generators and not risking their own safety to get you.
---
Instant Heals.

---
I feel like Haddonfield is for survivors, what The Game is for killers. They’re both quite biased to one side, so I feel like it’s not too bad relatively.
---
I don’t see it super often unless someone uses an offering but I’m guessing you’re getting it a lot if you’re making a post. Sorry man.
---
I get it once every 3 games. I haven’t gotten The Game in two weeks.
---
Pretty much
---
Is the third level out yet? Not been able to check lately
---
You joke but that's literally how I got that achievement, just booted up and got to shockin' until I got that good good trophy ping
---
Ah thank you, fairly new to the game and quite the hoarder so I’ve never actually used one
---
Those are the best :)
---
Especially with the new rank reset coming in...
---
DS is active for 40/50/60 seconds (depending on rank) after being unhooked no matter what happens to you. If the timer expires it will activate again after your second hook. If you get to actually use it, it will be permanently disabled for the rest of the game even if you missed the skill check
---
I guess theres a time and place for those, but id much rather have a few cabeza meat with onions and cilantro on a corn tortilla.
---
Gen speed is the way it is because pallets are a limited resource and the goal is 2 dead 2 out most of the time. 1-2 gen for first hook is ok because the game starts rolling fast after that and the map gets shorter with less gens. Its the 3 people on 3 seperate gens that  gives you no chance of control, usually done by SWF thats the problem. If they just add a hardcap to genprogress or a new mechanic that requires moving around then its fine.  So that doing gens progress the game timer but it doesnt get out of hand and theres average game time that all could work with
---
Currently spending all my BP to tier 3 prestige bill so I can have the bloody pants and head to go along with the sweater. So excited!

B U F F S P I R I T

Yes.

Agree, and he is pretty much exactly like Trapper in design too.
---
You guys are getting hooked more than once ?
---
And that's the point. The thought an edgy teen is now a much scarier monster than the former blacksite interrogation expert with dubious methodology just makes me happy. After all, go look at her character model renders. That smile. That damned smile.
---
one of the most annoying things as a killer at high ranks is that you *have* to assume that all 4 players have D Strike, if there's just one obsession. 1 or even none of the players could have it, and there's absolutely no way to know, so you have to just treat people like they do. It's like Otz says in the video 'invulnerable for one minute'  
---
Also nearly all the viable killers are either one-shotters or end the chase in seconds because if you don't do so, two people across the map without a toolbox can still bang a gen in 30 seconds. Toolboxes, perks just make this even quicker. It's insane.
---
At least I'm not a dontletthisdieinnew guy lol
---
That means don’t get chased first and get greedy for a save. It’s not a good play style. Plus denies your team points
---
Yup. I don’t use the secondary one often unless it’s for subreddits im banned for (this isn’t one of them as you can tell, and I keep myself as polite as possible in said banned subreddits to avoid proper punishment) and to be silly on occasion, like now, when I said I fuckin died lol.
---
Too bad this perk will soon be nerfed /s
---
Here. Have some pills for your comment, my good sir.
---
Aren't you the one who said "I'm blocking you" because I disagreed with your point?
---
Pretty good.

That’s... the point?

On an unrelated note, in some of my more recent comments you could find some guy basically insulting me on two of my posts, said posts being unrelated to the post we fought verbally on. What I did was pitiful yet I stand by it (I messaged him through private chat, forget what I said though), so he decided to mock me on two other posts. Didn’t recall him until I did some digging. Still stand by what I did in that verbal fight.

I would have went for an hour. Fuck you and your escape.
---
He has achieved T E I R F I V E. This event coincides with the 5th angel blowing it's trumpet, the rapture is coming Myers will punish you
---
I know this post is a month old but deadass does Myers have some damn Timbs on right now?
---
Since this before but this seems to be the most reasonable, if they are very minor changes then it’s not that big of deal as many people like that survivors aren’t unique in a way that they can play whoever they prefer. Instead of there being a meta survivor. Depending on what all the abilities are it could create a greater unbalance but faster exhaustion recovery and increased luck seems too slight to change much.
---
There shouldn't even be a cap, its so dumb
---
Technically you did make it easier. 30% easier to be exact.
---
Woo it’s this same post again
---
Check DBD store
---
A man of culture I see.
---
I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but if you're on first hook I am absolutely pulling you off even if I'm in a Chase.
---
Odds are the killer slugs you and you stop progressing on the hook, ignores you to continue to chase me, or absolute worst case gets a double hook anyway.
---
Slapping Alert and Spine Chill will also help you go full immersion while your teammates get chased around.
---
Word for word lol
---
Dam 2.0
---
I'd love something like that but I'm pretty sure people mentioned something about certain survivors becoming 'meta' and really throw off the diversity of the survivors you'd face. It'd get pretty annoying to have every lobby filled with nothing but Megs or something. I wouldn't mind it personally but it may hurt the game in the long run.
---
Report ftw
---
Meh, I don't mind giving the last survivor hatch after a good match
---
Dont heal!
---
Isnt power shock just overcharge?
---
I’ve gotten some pretty nice stuff from Wish. It’s false advertising, who wouldn’t be upset in this scenario?
---
I think it increases how long the killer is blinded but I don’t use flashlights much
---
That’s rather embarrassing.
---
Oh my bad I didn't even realize I said him instead of her
---
They want you to use leatherface or trapper but never use your chainsaw/traps.
---
Bitches, imma play my Myc/Pwyf wraith and there's nothing you can say or do to stop me. 
---
In short, play what you want and have fun with
---
The strangest one is Even Punishment - teleport and hit everyone as Hag. I've had like 20 games as her and usually they went well, completed several "teleport and hit" rituals but never got that somehow. Either it's bugged or I' just unlucky / incompetent?
---
The worst being, of course, 3 blink gen grab Nurse - outside of deliberately farming, how long is that going to take in real play?
---
Lower Ranks are more likely to DC
---
Desync probably made the Meg jump in a second later. Killer probably still had the Pick Up prompt before his game registered that she escaped
---
I don’t know either. I guess it’s cause I found it funny.
---
* For non-text posts (images, videos, gifs, ...), referring to the game in the title is not sufficient. The main focus of the post itself must be on Dead by Daylight. The rule of thumb is: if you can post the exact same image/video to another, completely unrelated subreddit without changing a single thing in the image/video, it is considered offtopic.
---
You say that, but every patch they release is three more perks in the game. 
---
Also, even if you wanted to argue that its just a way to get better builds earlier, then let us at least "miss" the teachable by not grabbing it at the level its unlocked. I can't be the only one annoyed by the fact that hitting level 30+ means that unless you want all the characters teachables, you're gonna have a perk slot taken up every bloodweb by trash.
---
Better decrease the amount of points you need to level. Honestly its a lot faster since you always get 2 perks per level now but still. I got almost 4000 ingame hours and i still dont got every perk on every charakter. You should somehow be able to come to an end.
---
removed uncivil
---
Survivors getting bored of playing survivor..watch the game die
---
Really solid perks! Though, im not so sure about guns in dead by daylight, not that you have much to work with it, but maybe something more fitting to the overall dbd theme.
---
*sad Quentin noises*
---
removed for being uncivil
---
Hell, it effectively used to be just leveling them up to level 40 (or less if you grabbed the teachables from the shrine and didn't get unlucky with the regular perks). I'm very glad I got a few of these that way before they changed it to 4K (and then to the abomination it is now...)
---
In the sense I am that stubborn rarely? Yes.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Honestly doing gens gets so boring, just sitting there pressing M1.. so implementing a task you gotta complete before you can continue to do the gen would be wonderful.
---
no i got them from the shrine
---
I actually like the perks in a weird way  
---
Swallow you whole shouldn't increase the time to get off though it should only make you undetectable  
---
Cut the engine is actually pretty solid as a perk   
---
Rip and tear shouldn't decrease healing speed and instead should be only apply broken after a survivor is healed from the dying state to make it more of a slugging perk
---
Who would be the killer?
---
Haven't played or versed any nurse after the nerf yet, how bad (or not) is it really?
---
100% trye, also
---
BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL
---
Killers have a default 115% speed
---
H**bin hotel is shit because the creators are pedophiles j/s
---
Can you imagine hooking someone at the end game and when they get saved they have this "self-BT" perk, adren and ds. RIP.
---
Okay but notice how all those stealth killers have another power to balance it out? Only having a lunge is not very good. The main idea of the hunter in l4d is that they incapacitate the survivor while also dealing a lot of damage. Maybe once the hunter pounces and successfully hits the survivor gets mangled or a new status effect that slows all actions for a minute   and another ability would be some way to track survivors better than other killers maybe he can see the auras of survivors within a 40 meter range once he activates prowler and prowler can have a cool down to use
---
Alternatively you could hit em with the Chad thundercock bbq, bamboozle, enduring and brutal strength which allows you to brute force the majority of loops
---
Yeah that’s why I think it would be important for the developers to focus on making each specific ability very minor, so that the change is there but not super noticeable.
---
when you wany a good michael myers mask but get the one from H2O ijstead
---
Don’t think they’ve been in the shrine yet🤔
---
1:45-1:48 It was so smooth I failed nnn
---
My friends: "I don't care if I die as long as I pip"
---
Me: "I don't care if I depip so long as I survive" (which outside of this scenario is a rare constellation, of course)
---
After all, what's the objective of the game? Arguably, getting points to level up all that crap and unlock all the chars possible without money, so that you eventually can actually play around with fun builds.
---
As survivor, pipping is only advantageous to your points if better teammates prolong your games even if the killers are better - as killer, pipping is never advantageous to your points, only makes it sweatier to get them. I play this game semi-casually, so fuck that.
---
why is AFK survivors deadly for my emblems bc they will die on 1st or second hook 100% cant get my max points with that unless the rest of the game is good enough but oh well not like i care about rank
---
Was rip and tear supposed to reference the Doom slayer
---
So much this. I've been looped around a hooked survivor and called camper in the end so many times.
---
If you break 3 pallets, and down someone in a deadzone , you've wasted enough time for the survivors to have done 2 gens.  
---
You can then either run to the otherside of the map where they are doing gens, meaning the survivor can be unhooked and far, far away from the deadzone, healed up, with fresh exhaustion - or you can camp the area around the hook looking for the rescuer, even if you manage to chase and injure the rescuer twice, that will probably take yet another gens worth of time to do - in the meantime, a third survivor can easily come and rescue if you aren't literally on top of the hook - all whilst the 4th keeps on banging out gens.  The more likely scenario is that you injure the potential rescuer, they run away to heal and a 3rd person gets the rescue. 
---
Survivors just have too many options to counter your ability to snowball a hook. Whilst BT and DS exist in their current state, the only way to effectively end a game is slugging - which fucks you over in terms of points and is considered toxic, meaning survivors will just dc
---
They nerfed spirit
---
XB1 unfortunately :/ 
---
Been thinking about switching over, though, so that’s good to know!
---
Even meta survivors now? No dude
---
Sounds like you might be developing carpal tunnel.
---
A shame Bill is so boring in DbD
---
Same goes for other crossover survivors, they're honestly wasted in this game
---
Oh the servers are down? That explains why I waited 2 hours and didn't get a match. Thought that nobody was playing.
---
Yeah but it can earn you some pretty cheap kills, It's not a good perk but for what it does....
---
Yellow is normal
---
Green lasts 10 seconds instead of 8
---
Purple lasts 12 seconds and has a longer blind
---
Pretty much useless side effects other than that it you can get more blinds out of it.
---
Why? So um can prestige 3 new killers survivors without even playing them yet? Kinda makes sense
---
I think the second to last was still briefly in struggle stage as I was hooked
---
Yeah that’s exactly why I wanna do it?
---
They nerfed spirit and now people will cry about oni and someone else like Freddy. Can you stop?
---
We could make him the killer instead
---
template?
---
Yeah, give extra BPs AND also some extra ranking points (maybe +1 level to your weakest emblem ?) to make at least getting the safety pip a bit easier. Survivors also have it tough at red ranks in that regards.
---
Don't worry about it. The Entity... uuuh.... does some magic.. or something.... who needs to breathe anyway am I right?
---
Deathgarden is free now, previously you could only get the mask by purchasing the game but since the game has died and gone completly free everyone can get the cosmetic instantly.
---
bc her face is disgusting to look at and I like masks
---
Enjoy it while it lasts, DC penalties coming up very soon.
---
That would be too unfair to the killers.
---
still helped me though.
---
Cricket as the Talibum, killer ability can be blowing sand in survivors faces causing blindness
---
I just noticed that sign brilliant
---
I may be cursed but i hope to pass it on to someone else
---
She had a purple toolbox with BNP, but it's still BS.
---
Maybe next time
---
Buying it the day it comes out. Hell yeah!!
---
And NOED gets activated along with blood warden
---
Rippi in tippi
---
I’m sorry
---
This fills me with utter happiness and  nostalgia
---
Literally all of this is in the game already my dude, the killer power is Hillbilly's chainsaw, Hermes is an extremely overpowered version of Play With Your Food, Ares is basically Enduring but more complicated than it needs to be, Trojan isn't even an interesting perk compared Devour Hope and Rancor which both have very strict conditions on letting you kill by your hand. Also like, a trojan soldier? No flair or mythos or anything just a dude with a sword? Pretty weak, bud.
---
*Gg you piece of shit* 
---
Calling card of a serial killer only known as MegHead
---
Yeah survivors need extra BP gains anyway.
---
i think its dope dude. i can't fuckin 360 on pc but i rarely have time to play so w/e.  
---
 the hatchet a minute in was nasty. the track you picked fits too.
---
Pretty much my thought exactly...but I mean you mostly only see Nea, Steve, Claudette, and Meg anyway, and statistically their pick rate is way higher than the others. Nea for the memes, Meg for her perks and memes, Steve because Stranger Things, and Claudette for her borderline broken camouflage.
---
Survivor diversity could actually increase rather than decrease if every Survivor had a perk that made them a consideration...but it'd be a balancing nightmare. Survivors already have huge compounding interest due to their nature as a team against a single person (which is why if all four survivors are running a minorly annoying perk, it becomes a MAJORLY annoying perk, because their numbers are a force multiplier).
---
It's a dilemma that BHVR clearly doesn't want to take on: make the abilities extremely weak and the meta doesn't budge, make them worthwhile to influence the meta and people will find the "best" one and use nothing but that, or exploit synergy between four survivors to achieve gamebreaking feats.
---
I just let out the ugliest sound after seeing this. Now this is the wholesome DBD I want on my feed 😏
---
He never complains about survivor builds he goes against? Nor the other way around. He does complain against keys and sometimes OOO, but that’s because keys are unfair and OOO is OP in the right hands.
---
it isnt, because she can only do that once obviously
---
GeNrUsH DoEsN'T eXiSt JuSt ApPly PrEsSuRe
---
You don't need 4 noed you just need one - it covers the whole lot. 
---
All survivor perks are (attempted to be )balanced to x4. This is one of the issues with balancing a 1v4 game.
---
Well I mean if you actually read my post you would see I put a lot of emphasis on each ability being very minor, which would likely not lead to meta survivors, but okay 😬
---
BBQ. A good billy rarely use Ruin anyway.
---
That’s 120 seconds of no gen work aka 1.5 gens
---
Servers have been broken all day, might not be fixed yet
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e1fz2e/how_do_i_report_a_bug_i_got_hooked_but_my_body/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

Lol autocorrect is the best xD
---
When your game and Aladdin's pants get the same number of patches. Oof.
---
I send you a chat invite, I'll run you through everything then inbetween games
---
At that point lithe or sprint burst are better to have because they are actually consistent. Also the disturbed ward atrium drop is not long enough to trigger bl.
---
A cosmetic would be great, but I think they can put shards, Bloodpoints, anything ,u now because it's sad don't won nothing it's like ranking up , you just do to impress yourself.
---
Yea not camping as long as you’re actively hunting for them.
---
Yea same. It literally has no meaning or purpose other than to show how many times ive leveled up. Wait why am i leveling up again? Lol
---
True but when a survivor leads you away from the hook on a chase a lot of killers just get one hit then turn back.
---
I get it. Now you have 1 person healing 1 saving and 1 on hook. And if you do it quick then you can protect the hook. Just makes for very unfun games as the hooked person when they dont commit to the survivor running away from the hook. Not saying it isn't smart but just unfun for the poor hooked bastard.
---
lol
---
Season 3 Epsiode 8 btw :)
---
Hey appreciation posts arent allowed here. /s
---
Hello glad you got the game some tips I have,
---
For survivor a good perks for new players might be
---
Adrenaline- A meg perk she is free, it might not seem like a great perk at first but it’s very good
---
Self care- This is a Claudette perk and let’s you heal yourself without a med kit
---
I highly recommend these perks for a new player to learn
---
For DLC’s I’d get the Halloween one and stranger things since they have great characters who have great perks
---
i love hearing this excuse because its completely ridiculous, no offense, but seriously 120 seconds of no gen getting done versus the extra time it takes to gen tap or run the killer around while gen tapping. its all slowing the game down but once its gone the game goes back to normal speed permitting no other slow down perks are had.
---
They are not about to change ds any time soon, so yea...
---
Feng, theres a high chance laurie has desicive strike ready
---
u/410maximus
---
Not like rank matters much in this this game lol.  And what are you going to do with this information that makes it useful to know?
---
I thought they fixed that so it goes with the average, like if you had a rank 1, a rank 9, a rank 7 and a rank 3, it would try to pair you with a rank 5.
---
Did they change it back?
---
Yea, i stream and play on the first original xbox one. It runs great while i do both at the same time.
---
BLINDED BY THE LIGHT
---
actually that's very scary
---
I'd agree with the change to Swallow You Whole and actually make it so you lift survivors faster, so you shoulder people dang fast and go ghost.
---
I wanna get physical.
---
Hi, the only thing I have custom is my perks. It's the Simple Border pack by EvaZioN. You can download it from their steam group that they keep updated when new DLC/ updates come out \[here\]( [https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Nebula\_Perks](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Nebula_Perks)) - just scroll down to find the Simple Border. Hope this helps.
---
Mixed Pig/hag like powers. Ki Ki Ki would lower his terror radius while he is standing still, Mother's Voice would reveal the location of generators that have more then one player working on it, and his power would work like the hag teleport just like the movies when he would just suddenly appear in front of people. Just my thoughts on what could be.
---
As a survivor, kudos. 
---
As a killer, that was my damned basement hook and you took it from me you hateful cock.
---
And you'll enter the chase pretty quickly if the survivor is nearby.
---
We call my brother ‘GG one hook’
---
That’d be the most selfless perk then
---
Apply straight to the forehead!
---
A day to remember &lt;3
---
I got this a lot when learning nurse.  
---
Now I just get salt.  
---
Worth.
---
Nah whenever I play spirit I can expect atleast 1 DC normally once I phase walk into them a second time.
---
Thanks! I could probably use as much help as I can get with the killers but I like the idea of sneaking around as Pig. I enjoy playing as Freddy right now when i do play killer.
---
Brought in line, by nerfing it
---
You are the one with yt chanel who is in love in meyers
---
Ruin could have potentially stopped Bnp if the other person got a bad skill check
---
Why not run the killer away from the hook so you can give your team a window to safely save the hooked survivor?
---
Try using Tru3’s build on him
---
No
---
well, I was thinking an upgrader power, he starts with bell traps (when survivors steps on them, their location is revealed) and when he get to X stucks up to survivors running throw them, he gets new weapons, first maybe a spear which increase the range, and then maybe the machete which increase his movement speed, his attack speed, his pallet break speed and all o that have a cooldowown of 2 minutes, but all the match ith the spear.
---
yea very annoying and strong, thats the bad part
---
Upvote for actually watching the show &lt;3
---
Reminds me of No0b3
---
now, this is the best idea I ever heard LOL.
---
Need a season 4 😭 Netflix please renew it
---
RESENTMENT!
---
Hey don't be jelly of survivors being camped your time will come too /s
---
You took my Pablo, now I’m taking your 4K
---
Yes run Dead Hard it is such a good perk and totally not overrated shit I approve of this.
---
1. If by abilities you mean perks, then some perks are always active, and for some, certain conditions have to be met for them to activate. It will explain further in each perks description.
---
2. It all comes down to personal preference and playstyle, but here are some good and bad (in my opinion) survivor perks:
---
Good:
---
-Self-Care
---
-Unbreakable
---
-Dead Hard
---
-Tenacity
---
-Diversion
---
-Alert
---
-Empathy
---
-Inner Strength
---
Bad:
---
-Up the Ante
---
-Mettle of Man
---
-Sole Survivor
---
and good Killer;
---
-A Nurse’s Calling
---
-Hex: Ruin
---
-Barbecue and Chilli
---
-Devour Hope
---
-Blood Warden
---
-Discordance
---
-No-One Escapes Death
---
-Deerstalker
---
-Fugitive Chase
---
-Hex: The Third Seal
---
-Mindbreaker
---
3.  It’s completely up to you and what characters you like, some are more powerful than others but anyone can practice and get good at anyone. However, if you really want a definitive answer, I’d say The Shape, The Nightmare, The Cannibal, The Ghost Face and The Spirit are pretty powerful, but they might take some practice.
---
4. As someone else said, if you can see a generator though walls with a black circle around it, it means that that generator has been completed, and that you are one step closer to escaping!
---
5. Finally, I personally would not recommend attempting to escape unless you know you are going to die otherwise, as it is a 4% chance, however there are certain perks such as Deliverance where you are guaranteed a hook escape (however you cannot be healed for 60+ seconds).
---
I know that’s a lot to take in, but I hope it helps, and enjoy the game!
---
What is the point in hacking in a game like this, what is there to gain?
---
I'm still of the opinion hex totems should spawn as close to the killer as possible and a lot of the bullshit spawns, like blatantly in the open, should be removed
---
This might be different on console but but as killer and survivor I've never seen a game that survivors won without anyone teabagging, I just find it funny ngl
---
Yeah but sometimes you gotta do arguable shit for pressure. These gens aren't protecting themselves and stuff.
---
Yeah they should really nerf gen repair speed
---
If you get tunnelled over and over, and don’t think equipping ds is worth a try, idk what to tell ya buddy. Telling yourself you can’t “predict” what’s next is a pretty lame excuse to not try being better prepared.
---
Power Shock would make Overcharge useless
---
But better
---
I wish but Bruce Campbell is done with the series and I believe fox is the one who cancelled it, sadly on a fuckin cliff hanger.
---
“AHOY LADIES!”
---
Yup, amazing for solo qeue.
---
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
people have the right to moan to complain about things they paid for
---
She shouldn’t be able to do that at all is the point.
---
It looks like someone has been listening to the new ADTR song! ;D
---
I find that empathy is a really good perk too. Especially if there’s no mither in the group
---
You must traverse to the opposite end of the map or else it’s considered camping
---
Lucky that the Killer turned back to you. But nice teamwork, great save! :)
---
I see Nacho Libre, I upvote. It's the rules
---
I'd rather go to Taco Shack.
---
Haha nice read. If they tbag after pallet stuns fuck em
---
and killers shouldnt be able to insta kill everyone after one hook either. nothing is fair
---
Nice man
---
Yeah I don't know where i've heard about this anymore. I stand corrected. Couldn't find anything with a quick google search about this. Only that you lose points if you stand in proximity after 10 seconds. 
---
The chase clause is not mentioned either though. 
---
Maybe im just bad at google, or blind, or both.
---
They were t-baggin and pointing it was disgusting. Still feel bad about telling him to DC. For a second there I went full emperor. "DO IT"
---
No need to actually apologize for that ahah ^^
---
I would love this ahahahah
---
If it makes you feel better that's the best possible outcome for your team. Your team can get 2-3 gens done if the killer just camps you.
---
Because she has a unique facial structure (like all people do) instead of being perfectly soft, round and feminine
---
I think Nea looks cool because there's no one else who looks quite like her
---
Would be dope, like +100k Bloodpoints cap for each devotion lvl or something
---
I mean if you use bamboozle, and don't camp/tunnel, you gonna chase each person 3 times, so they can jump through that window 3 times. So 4 survivors 12 times a match.
---
If you don't use bamboozle, it's a lot more
---
naw i think it’s a reference to that one old speedo guy on vacation in mexico
---
Oh thanks for the info, this is a huge update about all this fight.   
---
I hope Larry is right and everything end in 2020.
---
Ehh he's got a point of the sub, I still like the game tho
---
They don’t put credit
---
Do you know haunted ground don't give any point. Because its a trap you fool.
---
I mean, i can understand why there is a cap. As an example, a new chapter comes out and you saved up to lets say 10mil Bloodpoints. You could max the killer/surv immediately. You get bored faster, because u already maxed out, u know? :)
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but it doesn't make a difference anymore, because BNP has two D-Strike style skillchecks that don't have a "good" zone, unlike before where it was a barrage of normal skillchecks that were effected by ruin.
---
I think that would trigger me, tbh.
---
Want gens to protect themselves! Say no more with corrupt intervention
---
I honestly don't know either, I think it was ones said in a dev stream.
---
Me Playing Hag: \*Hooks Survivor\*
---
Me: \*places traps\*
---
Me: "Aight Imma Head out"
---
From my experience, I'll only really protect my hook if I've actually seen someone nearby - when I get a hit on the first guy, I'll usually quickly look around for another person, and most of the time I'll see them bombing the hook because they've assumed I'm gonna commit to that chase. Last time, I literally saw both the other two survivors going for it. If they'd just stayed hidden, I'd probably commit to the chase because I don't wanna waste time hunting for survivors who might not be there. I'm a survivor main and I get that it sucks for the hooked guy, but a lot of the time they only have their team to blame
---
Honestly don't take people who message you like that seriously, I think its funny to get messages like that knowing that i don't regularly camp or tunnel
---
BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL
---
Eh, I usually get team mates who dont attempt to rescue me until I am literally one second from death, so one hook for me
---
I can agree with that. Im at 3300hrs, all my killers &amp; survs are P3 (killers have all perks). But survs still missing alot of perks.
---
Thank you! Didn't need to be wooden specifically, but I just thought that a more personalized mask would fit him more than a gas mask, which seems more like it'd fit a miner killer or WW1 era one. Especially since both Trapper and Nurse both have gas masks already.
---
Mmmm strudels
---
He forgot to mention he takes frequent coffee breaks mid-chase
---
Any reason as to why?

This game is honest to god perfectly balanced when there are 2 god tier survivors and 2 mediocre survivors in a match.

I see a lot of potential in this meme.
---
Dude i think that durvivors cant complain any more, if you look at som of the otzdarva video's you cant beat them if you play a regular killer. The funny thing is that you dont hear the killers complaining on this subreddit. It are only the survivors, that need to change fam
---
I mean it's a horror game, you're gonna be dying most of the time
---
Legion will Susie go to prom wit me
---
I got the 4k with it and got the achievement in low yellow ranks
---
Why would they want people getting bored with the game so fast tho? Its better to just incetivise people to keep playing and trying perks so that they cant just get the same build they always use on a new killer/survivor and just play them to level them up.
---
I'm realy not after upvotes, and I was under the impression that "hot take" was more of an ironic phrase these days. Maybe i'm just old and fucked up the new lingo.
---
If you don't run the Perk "Bloodhound" the blood is not bright red. It is a very dark red. Imagine running that perk and suddenly we get ultra bright blue blood. Nothing else is that color, it would stand out so hard. Even experienced Killers sometimes lose Survivors because Scratch Marks occasionally are a little bitch.
---
[It's about 23 seconds longer](https://youtu.be/Pm2FBVvu2ro) than hitting 3 Good checks on a Ruin repair. Sure, it's faster to just hit every Great but it's an exaggeration to say it's a *lot* slower.
---
The problem is 9/10 you are dying because your team is stupid.
---
I can't COUNT how many times I'm down, under a pallet and people ignore me till I'm hooked.
---
Or how many people bring the killer to me.
---
Or any number of scenarios
---
Never realized Supernanny was hot
---
I'd rather there be a way higher concentration of pallets + windows but a much much smaller map.
---
With your idea the game would get DRAMATICALLY more boring. Killer is near? Run in a straight line to the opposite side of the map, everyone split up and keep holding W. Your goal would just be to drag killers away from gens as far as you can so they're forced to walk back too.
---
Not enough players
---
I just realised I wrote Rancid Abbatoir when I meant fractured cowshed
---
Been lookin for ruin
---
Love r/seaofthieves
---
LOL,
---
really nice play!!! TOP, No1!!!
---
State the truth = rude and salty
---
Kid, even now without any passive skill if you wanna go super tryhard you pick Claudette. It's just a dumb idea even put passive that **will** create a meta
---
As I said, it's a you problem if you don't get it. This idea isn't new, it's been out for years and debunked many times
---
It is not really about "hot take", it is about the fact that while you have a point, Ruin is not "cancer". Ruin is a necessary response to the fact that half the gens are done in the first minutes of the game even if you don´t have toolboxes. THAT is the problem. Gen speeds, not Ruin.
---
Which you did say in your post and I agree, but the title gives off a bad impression.
---
Exactly, If I see someone sprinting there I go, they unhook and I get the savior not the victim
---
Don't sweat it? [It's about 23 seconds longer](https://youtu.be/Pm2FBVvu2ro) than hitting 3 Good checks on a Ruin repair. Make sure they know to practice hitting Greats on non-Ruined gens so they'll eventually be comfortable powering through Ruin, but it's really not a huge deal if they prefer tapping.  
---
Assuming they're doing gens solo. If they're doing co-op gens you might want to focus on that first because that's a bigger mistake.
---
Unbreakable is good but way too situational. Most of the time I play I don't get slugging killers.
---
Thank you so much! This is really helpful! I'm going to give the Hag and Michael a try and see how I do.
---
Omfg please
---
In my opinion, there are at least as many complaining Killers in this subreddit as complaining surs. Not saying either of them are right, but both sides like complaining. Just my opinion
---
It almost felt like the killer did that animation.
---
Oh of course, thanks
---
I got accused of camping for hooking someone, walking a few steps, seeing someone running to the hook, and chasing them
---
Love the game but every post I see is just killers crying about how survivors bully them
---
Nah, Ruin is the terrible chemo to fight cancer.
---
They have crossplay between windows store and steam, but you can't play as friends, you have to hope you get the same lobby. Crossplatform between xbox and PC doesn't exist yet, but they did a survey asking about it recently.
---
... jump tf.
---
Remove it
---
Survivors: BuT SuRvIvOrS hAvE tO **EaRn** AdReNaLiNe
---
Also survivors: relies on free adrenaline constantly when hatch is closed
---
(From a 95% survivor main)
---
jump literally all the time because i've tricked myself into thinking it makes me move faster. aka what i do in every game
---
The answer appears to be yes.
---
The rest of them are still loopable too, like Coldwind.
---
Optimistic are we?
---
&gt;ruin 
---
You're being extremely charitable with the amount of time it takes to find and successfully destroy the totem.   
---
Yes the game goes back to normal speed once it's gone, but in that time the killer has managed to get himself rolling. To find bearings and possibly set themselves up for an overwhelming authority.  It's not useless.
---
In some games it actually does though. Like bunny hopping in Source engine or Unreal engine games.
---
This is very clearly someone who's been playing for like 8 months.
---
This format is too perfect for this subreddit
---
its just for a few hours people can play something else while its getting fixed 😳
---
Is this the retrogore album cover? If so, fantastic. Band is fantastic.
---
Yeah like in the forest and majoras mask.
---
He should atleast have heard the locker sound
---
Well, camping is actually one of the challenges for survivors to overcome. But it's true that it's a boring strategy AGAINST SOLO SURVIVORS, and most effective against SOLO SURVIVORS. SOLO SURVIVORS have very little tools to deal with it, and one of them is getting a buff in current PTB (kindred works for an user if somebody else is hooked). Since solo survivors have no clue, what's going on at a hook and why nobody did anything at this point. It leads to 2-3 survivors coming to the hook just to take a note, worse if they don't notice each other and "wait for opportunity". Lack of data in SOLO SURVIVOR experience is devastating against camping, that's why this is a VIABLE STRATEGY (sad, but true).
---
Sorry why?
---
Yet everyone will still gen tap.
---
It's chemo when surgery would have been easier, better, and more effective.
---
It was good
---
Tell ya what, blendettes are not hard to find once you figure out the pattern. They all hide in these tiny fucking corners and pretend to be a rock. Well guess what bitch that shit dont fly with myers.
---
That symbol means they're on windows not steam.
---
I meant fractured cowshed
---
So this is just a post from sea of thieves. Yeah I guess there might be some community iverlap as they are both in the game pass.
---
When your friend gets downed at the exit gate and the killer brought a cypress mori
---
I like Meg
---
I was expecting the survivors to quickly change to the lockers she checked when she wasnt looking. Ofcourse hindsight is 20/20 :)
---
For her power, she wields a G U N
---
Yeah I agree that killers should be rewarded for playing well, I’ve never expected to be let free, it’s their job to find and kill me. I’ve always went for the 4K when I played as the killer, although that’s only been a handful of times so spectating those matches just struck me as odd lol.
---
Which is only possible in swf.
---
Solo survivors will just run around the killer and take some hits.
---
Damn I really liked doing it .-.
---
It gonna work for everyone when user is hooked, and for user only if anybody else is hooked, so devs made it way more useful in selfish way, actually.
---
big pp
---
Correct.
---
Beating a camping killer is the best win. Just a giant middle finger to those killers.
---
In Low yellow ranks you can win with anything
---
And now its passive heal. One perk less needed.
---
Not sure you know what a buff is.
---
That’s like 100x creepier
---
&gt; thats assuming i hit every great or my team does too.    
---
Right. Assuming you can hit every Great that shows up, it's faster to power through.   
---
If you get at least 3 Good checks instead, it's the same amount of time as gen tapping. If you get 4 or more Goods, then it's slower to power through than to have just tapped the whole time.
---
But that just wastes everyone’s time/patience. Run the killer away so another survivor can try to dive in and unhook. If you unhook someone in front of the killer, there is no reason for them to go after you. They have an injured survivor literally right in front of them who is closer to being fully sacrificed. It is entirely in the killer’s best interests to try to knock a survivor completely out of the game early.
---
I hate when I'm in a chase as a solo survivor, see ruin, and can't let my teammates know where it is
---
Luv that dont make no cents
---
Okay, so you can get regular checks while the 15% bonus is filling in and if you get regressed it will interrupt BNP?
---
I haven't used them in probably a year.
---
What good ol days, oh wow its so fun to stare at the killer till one gives up
---
Don't stand at the side of a generator when you can hear the terror radius? 
---
Also chainsaw has a cooldown (1.5 seconds or so) and using it slows you down for a period of time, even a mediocre survivor can outplay most HillyBillies.
---
Well the point is more that it's not that bad to gen tap, *especially* if you're not confident that you can hit every Great that shows up.  
---
Hitting every Great check &gt;  
---
getting 3 or fewer Good checks &gt;  
---
gen tapping &gt;  
---
hitting 4 or more Good checks.
---
I can hear this
---
Have you thought about using a pallet?
---
Oh. I thought you meant his chase music...because that's been fucked for a while. 
---
But instead here we are, complaining about a killer who might be slightly above average and successful. How dare Killer mains have anything good??
---
just because the small playerbase
---
After the balanced landing nerfs I don’t think anyone is going to use this offering anymore lol
---
Could fastvault regardless of position or speed, no bloodlust, no entity blockers, no EGC, BNPs existed, killers could mori on first down no hooking required... list goes on and on. 
---
This game has come such a long way, and yet still people solely believe the devs don't care.
---
Lmao ADTR
---
HE HAS HIS AIRPODS IN HE CANT HEAR US
---
I genuinely haven't seen it here, and usually once someone says they've seen it I take it down, but in this case, either how many people upvoted I'd like to keep it up since so many people haven't seen it yet and since its probably put a smile on their face or made them laugh :)
---
It went from being instant to taking time to activate. How tf is that an improvement?
---
had two dc's in one game, someone on the ground (whch I was a hunteess with doodoo perks) they slwoly got out of the locker in front of me so i threw a hatchet and downed them and slugged. They probably got mad because they messed up and I counterplayed their ds. someone on the hook dc'd because I was by them, there was the person with ds in the locker and someone else. I don't understand why survivors get so upset when killers simply take advantage of a situation like that.
---
I'll excuse them taking a while to figure out what is happening but a statement should have been released quick smart. There's no good excuse for a twenty second Tweet clarifying the situation not being made when the problem was identified. 
---
My free time on week days is a commodity and sitting around for hours with my thumb up my ass trying to determine if my internet is fucked or the servers are down is time I would have preferred to spend relaxing and moving on playing another game had I known.
---
However if you're running OoO expect no mercy.
---
But then you'd also have to have good gen tapping etiquette. Like lots of people don't hold m1 long enough. And even worse, they'll WAIT standing still the an equal amount of time, before they get back on the gen. For no reason.
---
Dude holy shit we get it you completed some event. For most of the playerbase that started after, its free. But my point isnt there hasn't been a free DLC for 2 and a half years so OP asking if this one will be free the answer is no they dont do that anymore.
---
I've had those days.
---
I like this map as a killer. I understand the problem but it’s still one of my favorite map.
---
If y’all have fun then YES. I care more about enjoying myself than ranking up or whatever
---
easy..... i keep getting random fps drop during the skill check with an high end machine.
---
I think if someone is about to go into struggle and you know for a fact no one else is around (like with kindred or bond), it’s a little different because the worst case outcome is no different than what would have happened if you did nothing. 
---
I think a lot of the salt is aimed at survivors who do this though when you’ve got plenty of time, and/or who don’t have any kind of awareness of other survivors and just pull you off even though someone else is near and they’re literally leading the killer to you. In the first case, you’re not actually making things any worse than they are and you might even somehow make things better. Second case is just rude
---
its called proxy camping, at least your team got gens.
---
Every time I see an anti gen tapping post I wanna gen tap even harder
---
Kinda hard with braindead teammates, and his ugly ass flying across the map at me. No joke, 90% of the time, I can't hear his terror radius because he travels faster than it.
---
Shoot a friend request my friend, 
---
Volatilerogue
---
If you get pinned into a gen and get downed, it's your own damn fault. Git gud whiner.
---
About a year I think
---
That's why I like playing Trapper, he's the closest thing we have to him right now
---
I do a quick check  if I see two in BBQ and then I go for the closest known one.
---
Fractured cowshed can absolutely have a harvester
---
yes.
---
You're asking for science based counterarguments against a feelings based argument. Saying it will RUIN the game for everyone has nothing to do with science or Facts And Logic™
---
Best feeling on god
---
Yes, and it works... WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO REACT. Once again:
---
Infinite sprint + 1HKO + no cool-down + static chainsaw audio + high movement speed = B R O K E N
---
I'll be using Yui because she looks 🔥

Here's a summary.

If you hear the saw its time to move. Quite simple really
---
*i hook a guy and then go patrol other gens, but before I can go that far I’m all ears activates and I see a survivor’s aura near the hook, so I go back and chase them*
---
Surv:”CaMpEr”
---
I think her base weapon would be a Kukiri, a classic hunting blade, but possibly more futuristic.  
---
Stalker would make a great addition and give us that futuristic character we need.
---
I do enjoy me some ash, but this is reposted constantly.
---
Killers act like this too, survivors as well, in the end shitty people on both sides do the same things and no matter what side you play you will run into it
---
He's the easiest of the top tiers to loop, the fact that you got caught in corners by him just shows how much of a noob you are
---
If most other Killers were half as viable, at least Billy would just be par for the course. And YES, his chase music is beyond fucked.
---
No not yet, I want to see them live one day.
---
Fix your face first
---
Really? I've been here for about a month, and it's one of the subs I check out the most and I really haven't seen it? Are you sure?
---
That's why you always make sure the reviews include pictures.
---
Lies. All Lies. Dare this meme speak such blasphemy!
---
That's the other reason I figured it was time for this to get posted (again?). I was in a thread where it seemed like people are gen tapping by literally *tapping* M1 which is the wrong way to do it.  
---
So now people can learn the right way to do it and decide for themselves if they're confident enough to power through, if it's more efficient for them to just tap.
---
&gt;He's strong news not broken.
---
That's literally the elitist's excuse to something being broken lmao. 90% of the time, this is the response I get, just before the thing I've bitched about for ages gets nerfed. Then, suddenly everyone agrees with me.
---
What a badass
---
Yeah, definitely, but I’ve come across more toxic survivors than killers (I’m a survivor main) the whole time I’ve been playing this game
---
That was awesome
---
Platform: XB1
---
Type: In-game
---
Description: Missing WGLF bonus. Been getting “Error: You have been disconnected from the host” at the end of every game this morning, and in my match just now it happened before the endgame screen and I didn’t get any WGLF points in spite of my having three stacks by the end of the game. I’m sure because I got 25k total in spite of double-pipping and had 25k at the endgame summary screen. I would report on the forums but I can’t actually register an account there because the Captcha thing keeps messing up.
---
Screenshot/Video: I have video but am unable to post it at the moment. Will edit later if I can get XB1 app to work. 
---
Nothing else here is really applicable.
---
I like it,  very nice
---
Seeing as you are vegan I think you would really like the band Cattle Decapitation (vegetarian band). That’s if you don’t know of them yet.
---
It's the entity's fishing hook and it's reeling you in.
---
I have no idea of what this means
---
People have right to do all kinds of unproductive stuff, yet sometimes they shouldn't for their own sake
---
I love this! 😂
---
Yeah you’re exactly right, as a killer you’re gonna wanna search the area around the hook for survivors who are right around the corner. It’s all about timing but those deliberately proxying the area in hopes of catching someone unhooking then that’s definitely camping
---
Hi, pissy Billy main. Not surprising to see the "git gud" excuse from someone who's likely a non-life Billy/Spirit main (possibly Nurse on PC).
---
You are trying to take away my bitching rights! This is not allowed.
---
Yeah tunneling is ok in my book (survivor main btw).  Getting one player out of the match is really impactful and even optimal in some situations.  Of course the one getting tunneled isn’t going to like it, but it’s a competition, they don’t have to.  People in the DbD community (both killers and survivors) are so entitled.  I come from League of Legends, where using the most optimal strategy is seen as a good thing.  But when a survivor takes all the best perks and items or when the killer takes all the best perks, the top tier killers and a mori in DbD people lose their shit.
---
It’s a PvP game — if you don’t take the best build and someone else does and beats you, don’t get salty, it’s your fault.
---
Yeah, I have it saved on my phone multiple times because I keep forgetting. And note that not all posts end up in the front page.
---
Imagine a perk allowing you to survive third hook, but by losing your item+addons, your emblems, bloodpoints and applying the broken status effect.
---
The ultimate hero perk.
---
Next Tuesday there will be
---
The difficulty/power ratio is garbage now. She's even harder to play and weaker as well.
---
I must become the bonking boi
---
Imagine the level of creativity to have that response. You are a true linguistic artist.
---
That's fair, but I do like to think of this meme making other smile, so even if it's been reposted to hell, at least a couple thousand people smiled :)
---
It’s cause in order to survive as a high rank killer you need to be absolutely brutal and merciless otherwise you black pip or depip. Survivors have always been stronger than killers (bar a few exceptions throughout the years).
---
Both survivors and killers are stronger because the longer a game is out the better players get. Killers just have to get exponentially stronger as survivors do since it’s a 1v4.
---
Awesome, thanks for letting me know on that, I will def check him out. DBD is one of the few games that I don’t mind spectating and I’m always down to learn more.
---
you’re the one bitching about a slightly above average killer
---
Seen Aborted and Cattle Decap several times. The cattle vocalist was spitting all over the crowd. Disgusting and amazing show. 
---
The only band on my big list I’ve never seen is Pig Destroyer.
---
I'd get you bitching about nurse or spirit but billy is fine bar maybe his instasaw addons. Hes never really been changed for that reason
---
Aside from the potential rehooking without being able to do anything about it being possibly more frustrating than just dying and getting out of the game, agree.
---
&gt; I think a lot of the salt is aimed at survivors who do this though when you’ve got plenty of time, and/or who don’t have any kind of awareness of other survivors and just pull you off even though someone else is near and they’re literally leading the killer to you.
---
Everyone hates these of course, especially if they start getting chased somewhere *else*, and *then*...
---
One time when this happened a David claimed I was tunneling
---
I see you are adtr fan as well. That song is great.
---
well then I wouldn't use it. Empathy is way more helpful to see where the killer is if its not trapper to the beartraps. and even so trappers go for the trapped
---
Herd yu was talkin' shit?!
---
As a killer main, lolwut
---
Thank you Bardock, very cool.

I'm at 800ish hours on my 2nd Account. It has all at 50 + 4 at p3 50 maxed. So basically not even a Quarter done. I'd say that you will need to put in about 3.5k ish hours in to get all max at my pace

They're on all of them so far we found haddonfield, gideon, ormond and yakoama

We all got out btw. Sorry for sandbagging you Jake lol
---
There's an easter egg of golden toolboxes hidden on every map
---
I did bitch about Spirit and Nurse. And guess what? They got nerfed ;)
---
I mean, it gets rid of their ability to use it so it kinda is
---
I fook'n luv it
---
because we both know its TRUE. I hate running solos 😂
---
Well,i'll play the oni because he looks like fun.
---
The perks as a whole look pretty shit.
---
Nemesis may have it's uses in a gimmicky/niche build.
---
The pallet pickup perk may be useful if the killer doesn't break pallets.
---
The other 4 perks in the pack must be pretty forgettable.....being that i've already forgotten what they are.
---
Yeah and in some instances that is true but there are so many things to consider that it's impossible to say. You have to be able to read the situation.
---
I'm telling you now though if you are going to give up on every chase before 30 seconds, against strong survivors then all 4 are gonna thank you as they all t bag you at the exit because you won't catch anyone.
---
Just wait untill nemesis comes out
---
Yeah, I've been called a camper for doing that too. Been told that that's not how you're supposed to play hag, like WTF?
---
I don't believe it's gone 100%.   
---
I think they can still grab *if* you are not the last survivor (if you use a key). But that if you *are* the last survivor, they option isn't there, and is replaced instead with hatch close.   
---
I could be very wrong, just stating what I think the rework was.
---
Please explain how licensed survivors or boring.
---
- Strongest map pressure
---
- Strong ability
---
"Not broken or over-tuned."
---
So, history lesson.
---
Back when the game released, there was a very easy way to "hack" (really you just opened an easily accessible file and entered a number) to set your BP to literally any number you wanted. The downside to doing this was that, for reasons unknown, it completely wiped your save data, meaning that if you had any progress before the exploit then doing so would get rid of it.
---
Now, that didn't really bother people because they could just get 999999999999999999 bloodpoints, but still.
---
BHVR, unable to really patch the bug at the time with their current ability, simply implemented the bloodpoint cap. That way, you could only level a certain amount using the hack. Keep in mind that this was still back when bloodwebs were even more ridiculously expensive, and one million got you maybe 15 levels at most.
---
You couldn't hack them in one million at a time, because you'd just reset your progress. So, ultimately, it was a bandage for a problem they didn't have the ability to fix at the time.
---
Since then, I think they've patched out that exploit (maybe? I'm not really sure) but the BP cap remains as a relic of that bygone era.
---
The second perk will destroye Make your choise.
---
Problem with this is:
---
1. You stay around and loose 1-2 gens
---
2. You leave him be and go after the next one. In this case you lost time with the chase and got nothing out of it cause someone will pick him up, they still have the perk.
---
Survivor perk: Decoy
---
You learned from past experience on how to get out of sticky situations.
---
Perk activities when you’re working a gen and you’re in the killer’a heartbeat radius
---
When activated, the perk will spawn a decoy survivor on the gen. 
---
Only activities every three minutes
---
I use the map offering for those when i run haunted ground with ruin or devour, sometimes you get lucky and haunted goes on the one out in the open lol
---
I'm stuff is just hard wired
---
Make your choice is on the person who goes for the unhook, this goes onto the unhooked one
---
Basically hitting your obsession allows you to gain stacks and those stacks put more time it takes to open the exit games.
---
Water "traps" that notify the killer and can be teleported to whenever you want. Hag/Demogorgon. Or anything better that the other comments suggest
---
He put you against a wall because of your poor positioning, the fact that you couldnt hear his heartbeat is probably because he had tinkerer. Learn how to play againts him, he's the easiest of the top tiers. If you're running without any plan obviously you're gonna get downed easily
---
The only acceptable tea-bagging from survivors is when I’m playing Ghostface and I let the last surv escape. Then the mutual tea-bagging is acceptable because it’s more of a goodbye than a “u suck lole420”
---
Literally some scooby doo shit
---
Honestly I love seeing survivors doing generators, im fine staying on the hook if hey rescue me before second stage
---
THANK YOU. Finally someone thinking about the real problems
---
If you play bad, you get what you deserve honestly.  I just play for fun and rarely rank up, even though I'm a long time player.
---
Guess what? Nurse and Spirit got nerfed ;)
---
Billy's days are numbered.
---
That's remember me, Fire up makes your vault faster with each gen done.
---
Apparently, the devs are going to do something about it before it hits live.
---
That's why I do 360 each time I don't find anybody in a locker...
---
Lol hes bitching about 4% speed boost after 3 gens are done? Classic
---
As a Killer Main this had me laughing out loud
---
It’s the 16 personality types.
---
I=Introvert E=Extravert
---
S=Sensing N=Intuitive
---
T=Thinking F=Feeling
---
P=Perceiving J=Judging
---
That's remember me you're thinking of. Fire increases vault speeds and pallet break speeds by a percentage for each gen completed.
---
Awww, that sucks.  I was looking forward to using it on live
---
Ah right. Been away for a while. It gives more speed in other categories as well if I remember correctly.
---
I mean you aren't presenting any arguments here but fair enough.
---
Thanks for posting this my dude. People really need to chill out with the hate towards tapping, like yeah sure they have the "if you don't try to go for the greats you won't imrpove" but have you noticed how often the damn things skip frames and turn a great into a good check? Not to mention how rng can screw you over.
---
Merry christmas everybody!
---
William Overbeck
---
Lol I can understand ugly monstrous Killers, but Billy is just poorly-designed. What even was the direction with him?? He's just a Leatherface knockoff, which makes his lower-level even more infuriating. The REAL Leatherface is a meme because of how trash he is, yet the store-brand is S-tier.
---
Yeah people are so mean on the internet.
---
It would make ruin no longer necesary which is what most players want
---
Infinite sprint that has extremely limited turn radius and control. 
---
1HKO that only works if you’re caught in the open, which you shouldn’t let happen vs killers like billy, LF, and huntress. 
---
There are animations that take up time when the billy lowers his saw or misses. 
---
High speed that can be deadly on certain maps, but nearly useless on others.
---
isn't it always Super Mario though.
---
Same, but I'm not 100% sure if they are, since my only source is other people on this sub saying so 😬
---
It's from season 3, episode 6 'Tales From The Rift'. 
---
Season 1 only has poor CGI blood holding it back, the practical effects look great. Seasons 2 and 3 raise the bar with the practical effects significantly. 
---
Like /u/rebelrob73 said, if you can't handle corny writing and some hokey effects then the Evil Dead franchise isn't for you. Ash hasn't ever been a 'monster hunter', that's not really who he is. The original movie was about five everyday college kids being overrun by demonic forces in a cabin. Ash is the everyman who has to become extraordinary to deal with extraordinary circumstances. 
---
The Evil Dead was made by some twenty year olds with money they raised from their families, friends and even their dentists. It's low budget, grimy, indie filmmaking and the show does its best to pay homage to that practical effects driven route.
---
Y’all talking about how curtain killers make them dc last time I checked getting downed once made them dc
---
I see someone do it at the gate, not going out, is just wasting everyone's time. So go at them to help them leave, seems to work. 
---
I only go to gate when I can't find survivor in map. And there they are... Waiting to do just that. &gt;_&gt;
---
but that would be another hag, I dont think we need more teleport killers, Jason doesnt teleport on the remake, he more inteligent and brutal, and he runs at full speed, so there is that.
---
Yes
---
Me: The survivor has a minute on the hook, why do you need to unhook them right away? "I had borrowed time."
---
The Trashman
---
No, why do you ask fellow gamer
---
That is certainly an interesting idea and could add some variety which would be welcome. However what if the killer finds the box first and can then just camp it knowing survivors have to go there before doing any gens. I do like the add on to create more fuse boxes though, that is a good idea
---
old legion isnt even leaving ptb so no
---
Map structure is still fucked. A successful killer rework took them a year. A garbage fire of a killer rework took them 3 years. The imbalance between SWF and Solos is still staggering and there is no concrete evidence that they are trying to bridge that gap. 
---
BHVR has had long enough to start fixing these issues and they don’t do it in favor of pumping out more content. That only works for so long.
---
Hey now
---
well, maybe it would be better to make some change to DS. The most obvious change would be to just make it unsuable if you are not on the ground (making it useless if you go into a locker, or just repair in front of the killer, taunting if for a grab).
---
I don't understand why people answer toxicity with more toxicty. Fix the issue, don't just create another one.
---
Only Ash is voiced by the correct voice actor and naturally all survivors are merely skins as there are no fundamental differences between them.
---
So after they gut Nurse and Spirit, now Billy is in the crosshairs...sad.
---
*"The Jason" intensifies*
---
Myers
---
Feels fine to me. Maybe if he’s up your ass he wants you to go somewhere, and you know where!
---
Don't know if it's on every map but there definitely are. I think maybe only on the original Maps or something. Just Google it, plenty of pictures out there.
---
Yeah but its not really a hex totem and all time i clean one, i got nothing just the exposed stats.
---
There would be many boxes with one fuse each
---
Lmao xd
---
The anxiety overload when it looked like it was too late 😂😂😂
---
Yup you crazy. Played as trapper and against him recently move speed hasn't changed to my notice.
---
love!
---
Yes, rank 2 is terrible. Excuse me while I cry in a corner lmao.
---
You know you can combine your messages into one reply right? You can edit replies too if you want to add something to it after the fact
---
Edit: like this
---
Blows my mind when people use offerings for the farm. It’s literally one of the maps that they send you to every other game.
---
I have Myers though :(
---
I know how good that perk is but the idea is to avoid killers relying on perks like ruin or corrupt
---
Do you argue that Spirit and Nurse were balanced?
---
please BHVR as a survivor main I’m begging you to buff weak killers I’m so bored of the same 4 every match in red ranks
---
Rank 2 and complaining about Billy, damn you're boosted AF
---
We just dont tell you any more but I had a gd night with her last night ;)
---
True but I doubt they’ll do anything to change gen speed tbh
---
Almost exclusively solo-survivor ;)
---
People use... whatever the fuck that is?
---
Thats true. Should aswell go on cooldown after the killer hooks another survivor
---
Pig is probably more competitive than Demo. She has a built-in slowdown via her traps, stealth and a good lunge. She also has two very good teachables.
---
Demo is a good killer but he needs a lot of work to be viable. His perks are also all hot trash.
---
On the other hand, survivor perks in Saw chapter are really mediocre, with only 1 being good and even that can be subbed with Small Game. Stranger things has some good survivor perks like Inner Strength (although really not many, a lot of them are trash too)
---
sucks to be you then huh
---
That you did!
---
The perks are all gimicky. There is one where if you are near a carried survivor they get 20 percent extra wiggle speed and you get a 5 percent haste effect.
---
Basically.
---
Ah sorry I misunderstood, then yeah I’m on bored for something like that
---
"Si Se Puede!"
---
Look around under porches on the yamoaka house or whatever Spirit’s house on her map is called
---
I mean technically its camping but its excusable camping
---
I'll go check it out on the wiki, thank you! I was thinking it meant I'd been reported or something during that game lol.
---
Which one you meet the most? And tell me about that. I am tired of playing Spirit, Nurse, Freddy or Ghost Face just to have chance to win over and over again its getting repetetive with gameplay being just the same each map.
---
Ok, I'll keep going!
---
Guess you reached red ranks thanks to your buddies
---
I wish it was as active as this sub
---
This killer seems like a mixture of old and new freddy, with an interesting concept but mostly boring add ons which tend to just remove downsides rather than change the playstyle (like the dream pallet)
---
Mathematical impossibility, but sure.
---
its his animation, thats why freddy feels so fast too, and myers, they have walking animations but they are going 115% movement speed, it looks wong and confusing and thats why you maybe feel he is so fast.
---
there in non accessible areas, not able to be picked up. [example](https://i.redd.it/5g156c2zq06y.jpg)
---
Surge is not trash though. Combine that with Surveillance and you have a very strong combo.
---
I’d rather them add something like this fuse box instead of increasing gen time. It’s the most boring part of the game
---
Well the voice actor doesnt always want to stand in a studio and record groans and screams for hours on end. If bruce didnt get to speak I doubt he would have either. Plus Bills VA is dead. Been dead for a while actually.
---
I mean they try to fix problems when they show up. The question is, do they try to prevent these problems from happening again?
---
Thats how it was. They changed it to be based on the highest rank now
---
Me too
---
I mean my graphics card lets me enhance the graphics and lemme say it don't look half bad
---
She is saying: PREPARE YO A*S
---
He seems faster to me but only for the last month or 2. I don't know if I am just getting better with him or he actually  is faster. I am him hitting a lot more survivors than I use to when they are vaulting or just going around a corner. Sometimes it kind of feels unfair.
---
Wait, are we done crying about Legion already?
---
\+{ñ{ñ-Thanks{l´}{ñ
---
It is trash. 8 percent regression and some information costing 2 perk slots is bad. Especially with how many times Surge can whiff (grabs, lockers, downs away from gens) and its cooldown. Just use PGTW and a different aura perk and you are better off.
---
Old lady breaks teen ankles
---
Isnt this just finding ruin with extra steps?
---
If he never gets his face rework but gains an onesie cosmetic anyway, can we use the hood to cover his face? xD
---
Are you seriously calling Fire up strong?
---
TL:DR
---
It’s a bad idea because it’s so easy to abuse. Dc before hitting phase 3 hook, dc if 3-2 gens are left, early dc punishes killers for nothing.
---
It's very well decorated and a cool layout overall of like two zones of good cover/loops with an open zone in the middle with mediocre cover/loops.
---
It's just devs went fully stupid on the strength of those zones with good loops.
---
Saw some guy asking The Devs what “compensation” he’ll get for not being able to play for a day lol.
---
Ok I, understand, i am adding cooldwon to it by edit
---
they cant.
---
Anyway, I started blasting.
---
For killer I would go to Otzdarva he is really helpful, and for survivors a good one is Ussilys
---
There's a lot of solutions to this problem but sadly many of them are exploitable.
---
I do think that a DC'd player should leave a husk if they were already dying or carried so that the killer can get a hook and potential BBQ stack, at the same time I don't think it would be unreasonable for the remaining survivors to get some free altruism when this happens.
---
But people asking for much more than that are missing how exploitable it would be. The first problem that arises is that bullying people into disconnecting would become a win condition, and that shouldn't be rewarded to anyone. On either side. 
---
The second problem is that SWFs can exploit it to get easy rank ups. People are suggesting that the rest of the team gets a free black pip, but that's just going to cause people to disconnect on purpose to save their teams rank (don't think they won't. This used to happen in siege back when they gave smaller ELO losses for 4v5/3v5/2v5/1v5 games, which is why they no longer do that).
---
Disconnecting is a huge issue with the game right now, but it will be very difficult to patch the wound in a way that is elegant enough to not be exploited.
---
Nor water temple levels
---
The shouldn't appear if you generate the next bloodweb. If they do, that's a bug. But BHVR either #1) regenerates the whole blood web for everybody when the event ends, which is a really bad idea or #2) replaces each and every one of those with something else, which requires editing every character and is pretty pointless, since they're just 3K each.
---
if you see survivors sitting on gens u should switch to them.
---
well in the case its bugged thats the games fault not the killer
---
Lol 5 generators can be done in 4 minutes, and a perk that forces all generators not being completed to regress when you have already completed a generator is what's broken? You wanna check your data on that?
---
Wheelchair cat
---
Well, I usually don't. I just needed to vent.
---
Gentap last 20% so no skillcheck can fuck up all your plan randomly
---
I personally run Corrupt Intervention, A Nurse's Calling, Pop Goes The Weasel, and BBQ/Infectious Fright/Knockout/Sloppy Butcher/Any Other Perk
---
Don’t forgot that it pops up like 6 times in the span of a microsecond
---
Didn’t know I needed it until I saw it.
---
Nah. With the addition of noise reduction on landing you can be a mile away before the Killer is halfway up the stairs and he won't know. No Killer is going to spend a full minute searching the entire area around a house because he heard a generator go clunk.
---
He... he just said he didn’t see anyone else near the nea... why would he go after anyone else if he doesn’t know where they are, but he knows where the Nea is? Not against what you said but I felt I should mention this.
---
Ghostface should recieve double bloodpoints if he teabags a hooked survivor, and the hooked survivor should be able to teabag with him. If this occurs, than the survivor simultaneously dies and kobe's off the hook and into the hatch.
---
I would be a great game designer at Behavior
---
LOL I accidentally do this all the time. especially on the indoor maps.
---
Nope the Oni perk that makes Legion more than just a m1 killer - makes legion "broken" apparently.
---
Fire up, freddy perk that increases speed for pretty much everything per gen
---
Also notice the flair of the post
---
WELCOME TO THE EYE OF THE TIGER.... GO!
---
There's already a game that is sharks vs. divers called Depth.
---
What would an anti billy build even look like? If a killer is playing well they should be able to knock a survivor down after a certain amount of time regardless of what the survivor does. Know why? There are 4 survivors. It's why nurse used to be the only truly viable killer. Nurse didn't completely rely on survivors making mistakes. The killer has very little control over a game, you must rely on survivors to make mistakes. It shouldn't be this way. I will never agree with you about this. Have a nice day.
---
Notice the flair?
---
3 dailies + shrine of secrets purchases.
---
If a killer with that mask would come in my house, I‘d die from laughter
---
Oh god, we keep seeing the same posts. We get it, it's not camping.
---
flair...
---
It's a joke guys, it's just not funny
---
Nancy has never had a blue outfit.
---
Jojo memes good
---
flair
---
PainReliever is really good
---
Oh yes I can clearly afford that with my part time job and going to school + having to pay for my things already
---
https://youtu.be/mB1fLYPme5c
---
Oh lol
---
Naj lose all bp acquired and recieve none at the end of the game. Purpose of perk, no death no 😥
---
https://youtu.be/qnwdPlx9yR4
---
Posted some videos for you to watch and think on if you care.
---
I agree with everything else than the loops. If the guy knows the map he deserves to be able to do that in my opinion. Usually if I know that the survivor is good. I’ll just leave him alone and go somewhere else.U can of course have ur opinion about this and I don’t rly mind if u think otherwise.
---
BP i agree but emblems nah, cuz then u would depeep
---
Yes, it matters.
---
Didn’t say it wasn’t a shitpost. In fact my comment was more joke like, or at least intended as such.
---
Lemme reword it now that I know the name
---
“People use fire up?”
---
You get why I would consider that a joke comment, now? If not that’s understandable I guess. It’s because it’s the “wait, people [insert action or usage of something here]?” Kind of joke comment.
---
I wish I was having your experience lol.
---
I'm sure you meant this, but to be clear even survivor mains know the game is survivor sided lol. When they complain that killers are OP they're usually complaining about specific builds, not killers in general. That, or they're baby survivor mains.
---
Perks:
---
A Bloody Accident:
---
If you do an action that would normally change the status icon will have a 10/15/20 second delay the change the status icon. Will also work on a finished gen or a survivor being hooked.
---
(Can be used to make solo survivors confused on their progress)
---
Search And Destroy:
---
While in a chase, if you look at the survivor directly for less than one second you can see the survivor’s aura for 3/4/5 seconds with a cool down of 30 seconds
---
(Good to know how to out smart the survivor in a loop)
---
S.L.O.W:
---
You gain tokens for hooking each survivor once. Each token gives you 2% faster movement speed out of chase. With a max of 2/3/4 tokens.
---
(Helps get around the map faster without making survivors helpless in a chase)
---
Yeah probably but I’ll be pretty happy with five million.
---
Don't think of it like that survivors teabagged to mean that.   Pointing is more of a friendly thing
---
Given Gen speeds at the moment, my most hated Survivor item is a toolbox for sure. The amount of speed increase on Gens is insane if you use just even a decent toolbox.
---
There is no difference in these 2 pictures
---
Wow, I am surprised that big boi billy is not on that list
---
My bad, theres a fair few people not noticing the flair and complaing and the joke went completely over my head :/
---
Probably not. I bet they’re all hoping they can come to work the next sunday...
---
That's like saying the McDonald's guy was just as upset that your burger came out cold
---
I feel like im the only person that genuinely likes this map, even as a Survivor that doesnt use balanced landing.
---
I think it’s more of the fact that you don’t know what the other side will bring. You could potentially bring the best survivor perks but then there is an iridescent hatchet huntress with a mori and you are fucked no matter. 
---
Then on the other side you can bring the best killer perks but then there are 2 brand new parts, god med pack and a rainbow map. And then you’re fucked. 
---
I think it’s the issue of balancing for how the game has evolved so players get salty when “op” things are brought. It’s almost as if the community is trying to self balance the game. I completely understand your point I played a ton of overwatch before touching DBD and having the better comp is rewarded but this game has balance issues so that’s why people cry. 
---
Also I do think survivors are entitled when they think they deserve to escape and killers are entitled when they think they deserve to 4K.
---
The problem with this game is really the fact that killers dominate lower ranks, swf teams dominate higher ranks. How can you balance both?
---
I agree that gens need to be slowed but playing as a solo survivor is hard enough. Also doing gens is boring now so I think it should be a change that makes it more interesting too.
---
With that being said, what you proposed could work and like someone else said, making ruin not needed/used as much would be good too
---
okay thanks, could you explain in what order i should be using things?
---
Ur correct on that one. But better thing to do is pressure BHVR and make them nerf ds to be an actual anti-tunneling perk and not let it just be I can do this gen in-front of the killer cuz I have ds cuz I got unhooked 15 sec ago kinda perk.
---
I know that one... I dc all the time!
---
You will play the same amount of time for the bp regardless of the cap, because increasing the cap doesn't increase your bp gains. I think they are fine with someone who only gets on to p3 new DLC characters after p3ing everyone else.
---
I’d actually go for flashlights. 
---
Nothing is more annoying when you pick up a survivor and you see claudette walking in front of you go “click” and you drop the survivor. 
---
Sure toolboxes speed up gens and key opens the hatch, but I hate the flashlight more.
---
If you have difficulty with chase and do skill check on generator, play feng min. Her perk lithe: after vault a window or a pallet, you speed increase to 150% of you normal speed for 3 sec. Technicien. You have 30/40/50% to if you fail a skill check, the generator will not explode and the killer hear explosion 8%- than normal if you are on this generator. And alert is the last perk: when the killer break a pallet or a generator, you can see his aura for 3/4/5 sec.
---
Not what i was trying to say with this post but I get ya
---
I have a Noob question but how does it make a difference
---
I felt that for the last Legion I met. It was very heartbreaking game where everybody escaped, including the part, where he was looped at EGC just because survivor could.
---
The 1HKO and infinite sprint are still busted. Not to mention his glitched terror radius.
---
Danny Davito vs \*Danny Davito\*
---
u/catgirlfighter summs up my emotions on the Nurse rework from a fun perspective so I'm not gonna address the "fun" aspect. But the TLDR of that rant is that if you think it's fun throwing all chase power to a survivor for 6 seconds being totally helpless, then you are just delusional.
---
She is NOT the best killer right now. I'd argue Spirit, even after the nerfs she's getting, is still #1.
---
Nurse can't chase or she sacrifices map pressure. She can't apply map pressure or else she loses chase power. If a killer had to throw away their map pressure to be good at chases, they'd still be F tier because they have no map pressure. If a killer threw away their chase potential for map pressure, they'd still be D tier because they have no chase potential. You wanna know how I know this?
---
Wraith has decent map pressure with his cloak increasing his movement speed but has shit chase potential due to having an over-reliance on surprise attacks. He's considered C to D tier.
---
Clown has decent chase power with his tonic by hindering survivors and cutting off fast vaults but has shit map pressure due to his bottles not helping him outside of chases. He's considered D tier on a good day.
---
Just because the killer in question is named "Nurse" when discussing this, that doesn't instantly mean she's S++++++++++++++++ tier and she needs giganerfed.
---
"She's still undoubtedly the best killer when put into good hands."
---
Then why has she all but Houdini'd her way out of red ranks as a viable killer.
---
It's cool, it's the nature of memes. They are to be collectivized and shared freely amongst everyone. I'm just happy to see that one of my memes hit really well with the community. Welcome to the community! We're not all toxic!!
---
It’s both sides complaining
---
I recommend watching some YouTubers/streamers, you'll learn A TON from doing that. I personally really enjoy ZubatLel and Scott Jund, but they're probably not as new player friendly as some of the others. I know people really love Otzdarva. Can't really go wrong though.
---
Obviously there's tons of stuff to say about the strategies and subtleties of the game, so I'll just address one thing from your questions that hasn't exactly been brought up by other people: there are lots of perks in this game that are bad or not as strong as others, there's some perks that are fun or provide a unique playstyle but statistically aren't the most powerful, and then there's a narrow list of meta perks that are top tier. I wouldn't worry about playing meta builds, but keep an eye out as you play to see what perks people are using a lot; you can begin to expect people to have certain perks. This is less true in lower ranks, however, where there's more casual players.
---
The perks seem really interesting and I would love to see hunters from Deathgarden get pulled into the realm of The Entity, but her power seems like Iridescent Head Huntress with extra steps. I like the concept of a gun wielding killer, but don't know if this would be the best implementation of that concept.
---
So it's confirmed Haddonfield is the most survivor sided map.
---
So Freddy gets BUFFED? SWEET!
---
I like the lobby idea. I've always thought it's unfair that the killer can just dodge people they don't want to play with
---
Basically which ever add-on is first determine in what order they are applied.
---
For example:
---
The Pig's Ambush Dash takes 1 second to fully charge. She has two add-ons that reduce her Ambush Dash charge time by 50%. Now in theory, stacking these add-ons should work like this: *1 second - (50% + 50%) = 0 second charge time*. But it actually works like this: *(1 second - 50%) -50% = .25 second charge time*.
---
Why keys though I had the second in a row tunnel for a key. Just because it’s an easy win for survivor?
---
I'm gay so I win
---
UPDATE: A Moderator on the BHVR forum stated they contacted Rover Team and they are now aware of the problem. 
---
My guess is participants will likely see some sorta response by the end of the day.
---

---
It’s the most annoying when you camp a toxic survivor then all their toxic friends show up and toxically save their toxic buddy then toxically body block all the way to the gate.
---
“Fuck got caught in a trap!”
---
“Dane you Dumbass how did you-FUCK IM TRAPPED!”
---
“You’re both idiots, I’ll rescue you when you get hooked-dammit I’m trapped too.”
---
“Guys I think we’re fighting a Trapper main. Filthy fucking toxic camping shit!”
---
was there ever any question?
---
Why, because the killer don't know how to chase a toxic nea with a flashlight and generator keep going when nea is in chase all the game. Take ruin. Because this concept is very bad, sorry, because ruin is make for slow the game down, just a little bit. And take dying light and tanatophobia for slow them. You just need to counter pallet looping and ur ok or u can take discordance for know when they do coop action on a gen. Ta da. Its ez to for the killer because myer infinite stats 3 with tombstone, i don't care im hiding in a locker for he will not be able to kill me just grab me and you will just get hook.
---
300 Stalk levels on Myers.
---
1000 hatchets with huntress.
---
Oh you bought demogorgon? you just need to down 30 survivors with your power fam.
---
I want to think they are starting to reduce them because they noticed how grindy it gets.
---
Farming your teammate*
---
How do you win? You committed crimes AGAINST pantless Myers and his people.
---
I had to buy Adam just to do that bullshit.
---
We are the debugging crew!
---
What is the best way to gen-tap, hold for 1 second intervals? Is there a tell or mark that you should use? Or just get a feel for it?
---
Freddy has a higher kill rate at red ranks. Talk about nerfing him leave billy alone.
---
I like it too, the houses are fun.  
---
I'd take this over the school and all its lag inducing bs
---
I like the disparity between top tier and everyone else. Overall trapper is S tier I guess.
---
Knew it. Spirit wasn’t just nerfed due to overperforming killwise, it was the pickrate that factored in a lot towards that.
---
Wonder if Freddy will be nerfed next since he’s the strongest killer across the board. Plus everybody hates forever Freddy.
---
Still don’t get how in the hell these stats are correct when some of the weaker killers aren’t far behind Billy. From what I’ve seen, Pigs get genrushed to fuck and rely on NOED whereas Billy often tends to dominate unless the player is a complete noob. 
---
Also what a surprise at the deadliest/safest maps. Ones where survivors struggle to find gens come out as deadliest and coldwind comes out as the safest. Who would have guessed?
---
Nerf coldwind and makes gens easier to find on hawkins.
---
I wonder if your getting downvoted for a reason, possibly because you are wrong?
---
yeah if its end game either get the noed or just go. the killer gets like no points for 1 hook all game so they lose anyway
---
Honestly Cut The Engine sounds like what Surge should have been
---
How is that the devs problem? It's absolutely unreasonable to expect a compensation for the system being down. If there was a power outage and you couldn't play, you wouldn't be asking the electric company for a compensation because you couldn't grind the rift challenges. 
---
Also ...  If you have an actual life you can also do other things with your free time.
---
Please fix your grammar, genuine request, no rudeness intended, as I cannot understand it.
---
I feel like I remember seeing one before but I can’t remember where it was. If there is a golden toolbox, check the main structure near ruble because that seems like a likely hiding spot.
---
I don’t find my self being wrong when there’s so many weak killers who need to get buffed.
---
Otzdarva or PainReliever, they are both very helpful and I’ve learned a lot from them
---
Welp I never asked for you to belive me but I actually never have. Just never appealed to me
---
Yea I tryed to get the noed for good. But other random teamates didnt do anything xD just chikling at the Gate.
---
And you know how it is... Ya dont leave no friend behind
---
I am an avid admirer of the big boi, therefore my crimes have brought great fame to the peoples
---
If you're making your decision of stats alone, rotten fields and cowshed have lower kill rates.
---
He gains blood orbs from injured survivors. When his ability fully charges, he basically becomes a Billy: he can dash and chain it into a one hit down. During his rage mode, he’s essentially a much better Billy but at the cost of having to build up his power.
---
Scratch marks, crows flying away or coming back, if you have bbq and only see two other people, if you hear grass or footsteps, or if you actually see the person
---
I'm confused. Doesn't this chart means trapper is simply popular and not s tier? Or did I get it wrong?
---
Perhaps it's just me but Meg seems to be looking at the killers in an oddly flirty way.
---
doesn't that mean you can easily manipulate them to be always perfect with cheats though
---
Yes I agree, there is also so many weak perks that need buffs that’s why there is very little mega perks and very little meta killers, I wish they would buff everything to add more survivor sets and more viable killers (I play both) and using the same survivor perks gets old fast I wish more were good
---
Deadliest by kills rate \*cough\* MacMillan \*cough\*
---
I want the entity to turn all the survivors into mermaids.
---
I feel like a dead man.
---
People will complain about certain features of the game, and for good reason. Spirit having too little information, old Legion literally killing the game, Forever Freddy being even more annoying and viable than a snipe doc who 3 gens from the start of the game, Plague being frustrating with Pop, Thanatophobia, and Dying Light. Also, Oni is extremely powerful. Like, it's kind of gross how he has no bumping penalty at all.
---
But, then you say "Well survivors should just get better. Learn to counter play!"
---
And to that, I say: Why didn't you just learn the counterplay to instaheals? Or infinites? Or god loops?
---
Kind of like hillbilly but with more mobility and he has to collect the blood of survivors to use his ability.
---
No its okay to have different point of view. And i agree with you, if guy is skilled he diserved to make me sweat. But godloops and stuff is still a thing. Windows which dont close or close but guy can transfer elswhere etc. 
---
In my opinion please bare with me. This game should be more about mind gaming and hiding then Looping and chasing survivor. It feels rather like action game then horror game, and not even good one if i am being honest. I mean i love the game but i hate it for what it is then what it supposed to be, but thats propably my issue but ... I just wish it was more about cunning and hide'n'seek instead of endless holding of W on keyboard.
---
didnt realize the dbd community was homophobic lol

Ahh I see he is F A S T
---
Pain Reliever for his Key... moments
---
anyway, I started repairing.
---
Billy basicaly replaced Nurse no?
---
Totally. I much prefer this over Lerys, The Game, either of the Swamp Maps or Hawkins
---
Watch Fungoose on twitch and YouTube
---
It's the least we ask for, just one hecking badass supernanny that teaches baby players like me to behave proper.
---
Playing bad is relative. You can't tell a survivor they're playing bad when they're not playing like the top 1%. It's like if you compared every CSGO player to f0rest. That's not fair.
---
pig has better perks but demo is better in general
---
DK her power makes survivors run around the map, who'm more likely make them find the totems. especially at high ranks.
---
Billy is probably the easiest killer to effectively loop, especially if they are insistent on getting chainsaw hits. If you allow yourself to be pushed up against a gen or onto a wall, you're going to go down, every other killer will also be at an advantage in that scenario. His terror radius isn't bugged at all, and if you're constantly caught off guard by him you need to be more aware of your surroundings.
---
See if every killer was like Freddy, or even on the same level as him, then there’d be almost no point in playing any killer over another. The game would slowly stagnate and people wouldn’t keep coming back, at least on the killer side. Which is half the community.
---
Art is art! Good on you.
---
And making your teammates take all the aggro? Use your head.
---
You can see the scratchmarks up top
---
Yep but its a lot of wasted time stop and go to find another survivor because there is NO CHANCE to catch that one. And having perks which you need to purchase to be even viable is BS IMO ... Perks should make you stronger. What they do is making you viable. Survivor perks make them stronger.
---
You see a Spirit with Spirit Fury and without Enduring / Ruin... Well, it glows, so what gives?
---
I looped a baby wraith for 4 gens after he facecamped someone until they suicided on the hook
---
If the McDonalds guy had to stay an extra 2 hours after his shift to make a new burger, then yeah, he'd probably be way more upset
---
Freddy with ruin tanatophobie dying light and sloppy butcher for slow the game to much. Yes he is one of the best. And take good addons that slow down survivor
---
Agreed, but I don't think his percentage would be so high without the tome challenges. If we had tome challenges for Wraith, you could expect a higher percentage for him. If we saw only one more Wraith for every 25 or so games played, that's still a 4% jump.
---
Demo is definitely the better killer, and in terms of playstyle I enjoy him way more, but I see plenty of people that enjoy piggy as well. In terms of perks, the only good killer perk between the two is Make Your Choice really, and that's only really useful on certain killers. For survivors I'd say the only good one is Inner Strength, but there's some others in the Stranger Things dlc that could be useful as well.
---
I imagine BHVR is gonna take notice and the idiot will be re-banned? I always figured he had a secret account he plays on his own time.
---
He's only on console because of his bans on PC lol
---
Ok dude w/e. Then I'm the rude one? God damn. It won't ever happen so keep jerking off about this idea that has been debunked several time
---
Yeah, same, only one cheater this far
---
The amount of times players have gotten a free escape from me because of a completely random key they found is infuriating. I bring cut coins all the time just to reduce this chance of happening yet it never stops.
---
Trapper sounds simple enough. Doesn’t need every detail so I’ll just put a few lines poking out of his shoulder when I get the chance and make his mask basic if it isn’t staring directly at the viewer. Wondering how it might turn out when I attempt it later. Gonna be honest, ghost face and wraith would be the hardest to replicate properly, and legion the easiest, but I’m a trapper main so I’ll just do trappy boi for now.
---
Don’t need to be properly detailed, just look good. Hopefully I can pull that off. Yours are ok if not good. Reason proper detail isn’t gonna be counted by me is because ain’t nobody gonna remember how many cloth lines be flowing odd ghostface’s back.
---
Holy shit the guy needs to accept that he isn't welcome anymore, I really want to know who still watches him.
---
Ok but why is there a cap at all
---
You are one entitled piece of shit. You are not entitled to shit
---
&gt; New players get to encounter a very steep learning curve.
---
It's really not though relative to other games.
---
I learned the game very fast, I'm a bit older and have been a gamer for like...2 decades now so I guess I can pick up games a little quicker than most, but it's a shallow game.
---
All of the basic concepts of the game are fairly obvious without even watching videos or asking experienced players if you play for a few hours.
---
Like when you're in a chase, waste the killers time for as much as possible for other people to do gens...fairly obvious.
---
When unhooking people, do it when the killer is not around...also fairly obvious.
---
There's really not that many high level concepts that put you at a significant advantage over inexperienced players.
---
i like this and i like you
---
Also the only time it's fair to maliciously t-bag a killer.
---
Good. Wouldn’t want to switch to oblivion guard mode to scare you into choosing jail or fine if you decided your life wasn’t worth the cost...
---
They can’t take the aggro if the killer is right next to me. Your logic is so flawed, you’d rather let the killer go after you? Also If you’re gonna bitch get off this post we have no time for this
---
I know people may blast me for saying this but damn I get so sick of seeing these child's drawings on this sub. I mean for fucksake the game is rated M. While I know it's true, I don't like the fact that I'm playing with literal children constantly being shoved in my face.
---
Yea It is interesting murder mystery
---
 i still feel like i depends on the individual just cause some guy goes out and gets a m&amp;kb doesn't automatically make him good. One thing i will add though is there's a high skill ceiling on m&amp;kb. But that doesn't mean that every player will reach it.
---
Body blocking isnt toxic it just stops you from tunneling one person. Your just bad
---
it's the only way to prevent the gens from being done in a 3 minutes aganist good survivors. There's nothing cancerous about wanting to have a higher chance of winning
---
&gt;So it's confirmed Haddonfield is the most survivor sided map.
---
To literally no one's surprise. Everyone knows that Haddonfield is a shit map for Killers.
---
That's the sole reason that M1 killers are pretty much all at the bottom of every tier list. Having a power that helps in a chase is the strongest tool any killer has.
---
• Flashlight base use time is **8 seconds**.
---
• Heavy Duty Battery increases use time by **4 seconds**.
---
• Flow Amp Filament increases Flashlight item efficiency by **24%**.
---
Depending on how you equipt the add-ons changes the product.
---
• 8 seconds + 4 seconds + 24% = ~14.9 second Flashlight use time.
---
• 8 seconds + 24% + 4 seconds = ~13.9 second Flashlight use time.
---
You realise on console (at least on PS4) you can create a brand new PS4 account whenever you want and buy the game and play it, whether your previous account was banned or not.
---
No.
---
Who said I'm not just horrifically bad at drawing
---
This is what killer mains say all the time and it's stupid. There should be an ideal balanced where if survivors play just as well or better than the killer. People can disagree on what that is, but 9/10 times dying is absurd.
---
I'd say something like if survivors and killers played equally well, 2 survivors escape. That would be ideal balance in my opinion.
---
Lol true. Luckily I had watched gameplay to know I at the least needed self care, adrenaline and at least WANTED balanced landing.
---
Some survivors love to sit right by the hook as soon as you down someone but you know they are there. Then they start l
---
trying to loop the killer but they do it right around the hook and just fuck their teammate over while crying camping.
---
Whenever I'm the guy hooked on that situation I always call out that shit when they try to blame killer after game
---
I agree.
---
Nurse is the 3rd worst kill rate killer in Red ranks - yeah sure the nerfs on her are not that bad meghead survivor mains
---
Yeah a huntress dc'd on last survivor after 3 escaped, must've thought it denied anything to us.
---
The cosmetics are only in deathgarden arent they?
---
Keys aren’t common enough to upset me, so it’s flashlights... unless their user is a tool themself, heh!
---
Yes yes, run to me with your flashlight trying to blind me within swinging distance, I’ll *totally* pick them up instead-WHACK! ENJOY BEING INJURED, KNUCKLEHEAD! Now back to my downed victim...
---
Are you actually the Education Guy?
---
The chase has definitely gone on too long if you hit BL 3
---
When you're hooked and you see someone coming to save you, and the guy in a chase is running right at you as well. The only reason I run decisive strike is because of potato teammates. It's not because I fear killers will tunnel me, it's that I fear a teammate will bring the killer right to me as I'm getting unhooked, or unsafely hook me for no reason.
---
Hell no
---
I hate shit like this. This whole attitude of “survivor mains will go from killer to killer they’re annoyed by and complain until they’re nerfed” is ridiculous. I play both sides and I can tell when something is stupid and OP. I rarely find mass complaints that are unfounded or that I disagree with
---
To be fair i cant count how many times ive yeeted gens the killer just chased somebody off or the amount of times ive circled a tree &amp; immediately hopped back on the gen they kicked &amp; finished it in their terror radius
---
Thanks.
---
This is an acceptable headcanon
---
Taken from BHVR's stats post on the forums yesterday: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/
---
Even 16-18 year olds can have these kinds of drawings. Ain’t no one always gonna be an artist.
---
Yeah but I thought we have HWID bans. I know the PC version has them if you get banned on 3 separate steam accounts IIRC.
---
We've all been there.
---
Toxically save
---
Toxically body block
---
Let me get this straight, you tunnel someone who loops you for 5 gens, facecamp then, then get salty when you can't even manage to do an act that even a rank 20 can.
---
Damn, took my joke.
---
Oh well, I will take your upvotes
---
I’d say because I’m the deadliest maps, finding ruin is a bitch and the other three not as much. Sometimes in haddonfield.
---
Danny Devito as Frank from Always Sunny in Phildelphia. And his Killer counterpart; "THE TRASH MAN"

i never understood the difference between normal and dream world, i perform the same in the match and most of the time i manage to escape... can someone explain the dreamworld as if i was dumb?

**V I G O R O U S &amp;nbsp; B A G S &amp;nbsp; O F &amp;nbsp; T E A**
---
You telling me people don’t do this normally? I thought everyone did this.
---
Are you high? The game currently has a problem of too many spirit players at high ranks because few other killers are as viable.
---
But the stats blatantly show it's not
---
There are some areas on some maps that are very strong for survivors, like the middle building on the asylum map for example. If the chase has been long and they're now in a really safe area, I'd give up. Also, feel out the ability of the survivors you're playing against. Is their David REALLY good at looping you, but the other survivors just kinda fall over? I'd give up on David much more quickly than the others in times like this.
---
Doctor's not top tier, but he's by far my least favorite killer to go against. Beating even Spirit.
---
LOL Poor Peppa Pig. If Peppa Pig reportedly teaches American Kids to speak with a British accent, Peppa might also be able to teach the Devs how to speak English.
---
BTW this Is a Joke I know the Devs are French Canadian and I personally love all of them...except for The Map Designers
---
Ehhh, not really. He’s very challenging when in the right hands. But if the person doesn’t know how to play him effectively than he’s pretty trash actually. I wanted to start playing him and learn quickly that he is not nearly as easy to play as I thought he would be. And throwing his projectiles is actually kind of weird too because the arc and trajectory is weird.
---
You can still hack in over a million easily... sitting on 50m lmao
---
so freddy is getting a nerf soon 
---
awesome......
---
It'd be funny if they had a thing for which map offerings were used by which killer.
---
I'd imagine a majority of Lery's offerings were burned by Myers, and 99% of Jigsaw Pieces burned by Doctor players ready to show the world the ~~misery~~ joys of Dr. Worldwide Impossible Skillchecks with a Jigsaw Piece.
---
That and being unable to see which direction the killer is coming from.
---
I just find it funny that the killer favored maps are all 3 indoor maps in the game and the survivor favored maps are corn maps and then Haddonfield.
---
She want that Macmillan dick
---
Survivors OP. Red ranks are hell. Can't win.

Not just with no buffs, with continued slight nerfs

&gt; Killers just have to get exponentially stronger as survivors do since it’s a 1v4.
---
level of logic here = oyster
---
Wasn't the fix bloodpoints cap only at 500,000 ? I remember how annoying that was..
---
big help, thanks so much!
---
Yes but it's also incredibly easy to surpass controller above average controller users unless you're just not even the slighest bit skilled in kbm
---
Oh cool! I was incorrect. Thanks for the info.
---
Haddonfield &amp; Coldwind are also heavily survivor-sided maps.
---
Right?! 
---
She's like "So what's your offering? Mori me with that dick. "
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e1iqkt/this_matchmaking_is_broken/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Don't forget for the killer to look at you and sprint out before they can close the gap for a free chase/escape and progress in evader bar ;)
---
It's not all that different honestly.
---
It depends, if Jason decides you die first, the game is over in 1 minutes - Quite unbalanced IMO, however, you're right too, since many matches are like 20 minutes of Jason chasing someone
---
They really should remove map offerings
---
Because at higher ranks survivors are still gonna do gems because they’re not gonna bother searching for boxes if they can’t see them. RBTs are meant to stall but all RSN2 does is encourage them to do a generator.
---
Slick
---
I changed my username on dead by daylight a bit ago and that clip I posted a few days ago was old so that’s why it’s different, still me though
---
What's happened that he got banned? I don't really now him but it's interesting what the reason is.
---
Nice.
---
Cat in the hat swings his bat the the ground, making an earth quake breaking nearby pallets and slowing nearby survivors.

Yeah might be that.

might be it

Would buy simply for the chase music

They hack the game and get like 1 billion bloodpoints. There's already a video of Oni and Yui where they level them up and p3 them completely
---
It's not as easy as you think most people are learning mouse and keyboard for the first time. People on controller have been playing it since they were kids they have years of experience. I'll use myself as an example when I first learned how to do mouse and keyboard I was trash lots of grinding working hard and getting smashed and I got a little better. Nowhere near close to the skill ceiling necessary to be as good as you're claiming. Mouse and keyboard is work for people that have never done it before most people don't even like to deal with it do you play PC? Most of my friends use a controller if they aren't forced to do mouse and keyboard. But we'll just have to agree to disagree.
---
Sure, in Dream World you get some kind of penalties, and in normal world you kinda cant see freddy until he is a bit closer. Also if you are in Dream World you are affected by either Dream Pallets or Dream Snares. Plus Freddy have great addons, for example if you are in Dream World you have big pentalties towards what type of Addons Freddy Choses, most used are those which halt your repair, heal speed etc. to halt.
---
I wanted a break from spending my PB on Spirit before the patch, so I played Wraith with that addon that makes his TR audible in stealth, distressing, and some more meme perks. I mostly spent my time bingbonging and keeping people injured.
---
The amount of BMing and shit talking in chat was honestly about the same. It just changed from like 20% of people complaining their SWF got steamrolled to 20% of people congratulating themselves on escaping against a wraith memeing.
---
Yeah flashlights really only work once for a save unless you are half asleep and forget to watch out for it.
---
Most of the time i find players with flashlights getting me free hits because they greed for the save.
---
Off the top of my head: 
---
*You only see the puddles/fake pallets when asleep
---
*You hear the lullaby instead of a heartbeat when asleep
---
*Certain addons slow the game down more for each addled survivor (like the chains addon)
---
*His gen teleport’s cooldown lowers for each asleep survivor
---
Agreed.
---
He'll probably move to Xbox. Once he's banned there he'll move to Switch. After being banned there finally he'll have a ton of burner phones so he can keep making accounts and upload content for the mobile version.
---
When was the pig last nerfed again?
---
Love me some MackDonalds
---
Doctor and hag too if console
---
One bad survivor and survivors will very quickly be on their heals trying to help them. Two bad survivors and there's almost no chance even with godlike synergy from the other two.
---
I hate Haddonfield as a killer. You can’t just walk by a gen to see if someone’s on it. You have to go in the house, up the stairs, into the room. Just so many places for survivors to hide and do gens.
---
Thats what am i asking what makes him so good, and how adapt other killers to be similar, of course halting game to a crawl is not a solution but find out what makes him strong and tweak it to be fun and viable yet killers would have decent winning chances.
---
The bgm and sound effects deserve a round of applause!
---
No.   DG was an obvious drain on DBD resources and hastened the introduction of shitty monetization practices into DBD.   BHVR hoped we would all just jump onto their attempt to fleece some money from the FPS market and didn't truly understand why DBD was popular.
---
You might be right, I've been gaming with a pc and console since I was a little kid so I'm fine using either but I have preferences for games, hate kbm on fighting games and refuse to use a controller for shooters.
---
It depends on the scenario, there's no outright rule of "never allow yourself to get bloodlust during a chase". 130% movement speed ( from a 115% killer) could be invaluable at downing an injured survivor. 45-50 seconds is not bad for a chase, especially if they are dropping pallets along the way.
---
Now if you're chasing someone who is very good and won't drop a pallet and you haven't even injured them in 30 seconds then yeah I would have left the chase by then.
---
I don’t think devour is that bad. It rewards the killer for not camping a hook and going to look for other survivors. Also devour can be cleansed almost immediately like ruin
---
why can’t you just get good at hitting skill checks rather than pressing m1 every 2 seconds
---
“Debunked” by people like you getting angry and saying it’ll never happen. Okay dude.
---
You’re so braindead it physically hurts me. Why don’t you go get an education or something.
---
We spent ages I really want to find it, for some reason the one from springwood didn't show up even though it's meant to be in the phonebox :/
---
Definetly make Stealth much more viable, and looping and chasing much harder. Viable, but not viable enough to make look killer like Tom chasing after Jerry in grotesque. 
---
And definetly agree with you.
---
They always say a trapper was camping even when a survivor gets trapped right by the hook.
---
What if No Mither gave you a forth hooking? Cause it’s useless at this point.
---
As opposed to the current meta of playing the exact few killers over and over again? I’m rank 3 and I cant remember the last time I saw anything besides spirit, nurse, Freddy, and billy.
---
It's hard to hear a second locker closing while you're opening one yourself. The reason he was checking at all is because he can hear her crying.
---
After this he probably walked downstairs to see if she was right underneath him.
---
Anyway, it pays to look at the ground every now and then as killer.
---
He's one of my only P3 50 all perk killers, and I have to agree with you. I never really used STBFL or sloppy though, so my builds aren't broken by these changes. Testing out the improved speed and instant button effects on the PTB felt REALLY good though.
---
I think a fine nerf would be making his slowdown add ons reduced because forever Freddy is a genuine nightmare to play against.
---
Imagine the maps where scratchmarks actually work being the deadliest.
---
Indeed, but not to the ground to be the worst killer of them all.
---
I agree, they are the highest priority targets
---
I don't think it's so much about her being simply powerful or weak. It's about the little interaction you have with her in a chase and that she barely offers any counterplay. That's where most of the complaints come from.
---
Thanks for telling me! 😁
---
Definitely for me. Hatch escapes at 4 or 5 gens are bullshit enough, but keying out to obtain it? Fuck that. I facecamp any key I see to death.
---
except that she's still S tier...
---
I'm so confused what just happened. Billy hit you with that fucking portal chainsaw lol
---
can't be unseen....
---
Clown being the worst killer in red ranks shows a lot about killers with no map pressure. With the way gen speeds are if you have no map pressure at top ranks you’re going to have to work your ass off to keep up and even then you’ll still be behind.
---
IIRC it was a multitude of reasons. Witch Hunting/having his fans harass or report people. I think he also abused and showcased exploits on stream (Remember, using exploits to hold a killer hostage, reach places the killer physically can't go, etc. is bannable. SHOWCASING HOW TO DO THEM IS WORSE since some people will use what they've learned in matchmaking.) etc.
---
[On the bright side, we got this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE1EF0szD6Y)
---
Why does that bird have a Pig head on it?  Is that some obscure mythology reference or something?
---
Ascend!
---
yea i specifically dont use his purple/pink add-ons because they are a little too much.  i do well enough with him as is  with the pallet add on.
---
I agree and I say this as someone who has been defending Spirit against the hordes.
---
Yes Nurse is technically stronger, but no killer in the game feels as cheap ad Hillbilly.
---
The massive chainsaw hitbox, the auto-aim, the instasaw. I’d take Prayer beads or omegablink over instasaw Billy anyday.
---
At least the other 2 killers are harder to use so after rank reset you still have a chance. Anyone can pick up Billy and ko a team of green rank survivors in under a minute. So after rank reset this was the deadliest killer of them all. He’s too strong for how easy he is to use.
---
My Ranking goes as follows:
---
Number 15..Burger King Foot lettuce. The La thing you’d want on your Burger King Burger is someone’s Foot Fungus. Well as it turns out this might be what you actually get. In...
---
5. Maps
---
Maps really aren’t annoying what do ever and I  think they are probably the most balanced item.
---
4. Med-Kits 
---
Again nothing really too bad and they don’t really distract me
---
3. Flashlights 
---
Now this is where it gets annoying 
---
Flashlights are a pretty dumb item. It give high reward for little risk or skill (except maybe Flashlight saves which used to be a lot easier)
---
2. Toolboxes
---
Toolboxes only increase the already insanely fast  speed of Generator Repairs so this pressures you as the Killer even more. I think Base Generator Repair Speed should be MODERATELY reduced so the highest repair speed with Speed Increase Add-Ons and the Best Repair Toolbox should complete a Generator in 80 Seconds
---
Number 1: Keys
---
Keys are probably one of the dumbest most broken things in Dead by Daylight being on the Same Tier as Omega Nurse, Old Brand New Part, Old Insta-Heal, Old Prayer Beads, the Old Loop Lay-out and the Pallet Vacuum. Keys literally reward Players for Losing. Two Survivors already dead because the Killer is playing smart but we did 3 Gens so the final 2 Escape. I’m Sorry but who things this is fair or fun. And I’m mentioning Fun because the Devs seem to only balance around this idea despite the fact that the Legion is probably the least fun to Killer to play as because of how underwhelming their Power is. And don’t get me started on the Ironworks of Misery Window, The Rancid Abattoir Main Building, or the Torment Creek Main Building Window.
---
This Game used to be a lot worse but that doesn’t mean that it’s anything close to balanced.
---
Got caught with 30 rocks the cop look lik alec baldwin
---
Oh no, I can't hump the combine on Rancid Abattoir with the god window open in the background, how will I ever live!
---
Seems people would rather DC than risk getting hooked these days
---
Infinite sprint that sucks in all survivors nearby like a fucking vacuum and hits survivors around corners
---
I rly like the looping in the game cuz it makes the game more entertaining. Think about dbd when u will just look inside lockers and go kick another gen somewhere.
---
I'm really shocked at Hag having SUCH a low pick rate in red ranks. Admittedly I almost never see her in my games, but she's extremely deadly when people play her correctly.
---
Yeah it's not like the devs wanted this
---
I’m pretty sure it’s a joke
---
Come on dude, take it easy on that poor strawman.
---
Guys this is obvious sarcasm
---
It’s literally my favorite game
---
In the last 2 years I can't remember the last time I've hit BL3... if it happens you're doing something wrong
---
Just did it and it totally works- thank you so much dude
---
That’s me but instead it’s my first hook
---
I was playing against a nurse the other day, I was looping her at a window and eventually she cornered me, but then stopped trying to hit me. Weird, I thought. So I got away and the nurse never hooked anyone the rest of the game.
---
In the end game chat I was talking to the killer, and she said on her screen it showed her as grabbing me at the window, and for the entire rest of the game she couldn’t interact with anything - kicking gens, pallets, use her power, or pick up survivors. It also slowed her down since the game seemed to think she was still carrying a survivor. 
---
I felt bad afterwards, I thought she just took pity on us lol
---
tbh No Mither or Deja Vu
---
But the argument is that it would become less fair for people who have fine eyesight. that's the entire discussion.
---
Everytime i run deliverance i get tunneled and camped after 10 seconds lmao
---
I think one of the main reasons contributing to why indoor maps have higher kill rates than other maps is that generators (and Ruin) are harder to find on them. This is why I think removing the spotlights from generators and randomizing their spawn locations on all maps is the best way to slow the game down, with survivors having to spend more time looking for generators to work on in the first place. In turn, Ruin should be nerfed (at least removing the 3-second progression cooldown on good skill checks), and killers would have the perk slot open again.
---
Freddy would literally be the best killer lol
---
Try again after the update. I believe they are fixing protection hits
---
WE WILL NEVER BE SLAVES
---
But we will be sacrified. &gt;.&gt;
---
What? She was called weak and unviable when she was on PTB and was legit shit back when it first launched with her. They made tweaks and she became good.
---
I actually really like this idea. On most maps it's brain dead simple to find generators.
---
They're doing some tweaking with protection hits and how often you can score them on the PTB I believe. 
---
Hopefully this will make MoM more viable.
---
&gt;no matter what happens
---
Except being the first hook
---
MM is broken again BTW
---
i've been playing survival for almost two years and never once have i played as a killer (not counting the tutorial).
---
I need Matilda and Twins Devito who transforms into Its Always Sunny for a special power and chainsaw
---
Yup. Used this perk for a meme last night and I got 3 protection hits but only 3 stacks too. Sucks too cause I died in the end game collapse but I would’ve escaped if the perk actually worked.
---
She still has a 65% kill rate on average though? Actually the most shocking thing about these stats are that killers are obviously killing people far more than survivors are escaping. Unless I'm severely misinterpreting it seems really unbalanced.   
---
But yea regarding nurse, I'd wait a few months and look at her stats then. People gotta get used to the changes. I've gone against some insane nurses since her rework.
---
Which is the main reason why the colourblind settings argument is a hard one to balance for. But I do think it makes some sense to add colourblind help for certain things, like auras.
---
Wow. What a dumbass. Just leave at the end of the game and don't be a fucking douche
---
When you said big company, I assumed it was one of those companies that actually affect our life. Be it health or financial wise. But gaming company does not have equal value. I understand your perspesctive. The game developers' job is to keep their game running, yes. But I'm just trying to say that people should be more  chill about it since it's just a game, not like they're gonna die or be homeless or anyting if a game doesn't work for a day. Things happen. I think it's too much for us to be asking for some compensation for just one day of something going wrong.
---
That's not how that works lmao
---
Uhm, the electric company charges you for usage.  So you aren't paying them for something you aren't using.  That doesn't make sense.  
---
However, it is absolutely reasonable to ask your ISP for compensation if there's an extended outage.
---
Wow really! Holy shit that’s bad, I’ve seen that happen before when someone DC’s on shoulder but not like that. They really need to fix the grabs. Losing a Gen grabs as killer could be super detrimental
---
I know, but that’s not always an option.
---
Horrible idea.
---
Nice 360, but please use something else than saboteur, it‘s a veeery weak perk, even calm spirit is better
---
So Freddy's getting nerfed next? 😢
---
Where did you find it were on that one right now?
---
“Left to hung like a douche, another player named dwight”
---
It's so much fun and the new fire update is awesome
---
Don't forget when you're not sure why you can't escape the hook and immediately go into struggle (Since it's only a 4% chance the game doesn't clearly communicate) and the killer decides to give you hatch because you're a Baby Dweet and you're confused if the killer was trying to belittle/insult you.
---
I wouldn't want to watch mobile gameplay. Good thing I'm not an OchiDO fan.
---
Yeah for sure. That poor Nurse. And she’s so slow without her power too lol
---
Stop afking and do gens
---
I'm bout to blow your mind right now but the survivor auras are actually yellow not green
---
I mean with stats like this I find it harder to believe how killers are incapable of ever winning at high ranks. Since apparently even in the worse scenarios killers are still killing over 2 people on average. With the only factor keeping them from 4ks is probably hatch games.
---
Not me, used to like his compilation vids ok, but then I watched games where he played the whole round hearing him be a douche noozle to low rank killers while he uses meta + 3 body guards keeping him alive if he fucks up. Yeah... no fam and after the shit that has come out about him (being a creep, what a surprise) I just doubled down on never watching anything refered to him.
---
profanities bro
---
I do realize this. But there is a slight chance his band could've been lifted.
---
For me it would be demo
---
I play a lot of games and I've received compensation from several of them for unexpected outages.  Generally in the form of some token amount of premium currency.  Not enough to really be meaningful but enough to say, "our bad, he's a little something-something to keep our support staff sane."
---
Playing survivor for... Bp? That's not how it works. You stick to killer for that lol
---
moaning and cumming 😩
---
Big deep cuts are hott and all, but all those little slices really gets the blood pumping
---
Are you new to the game, trolling, or what?! 🤦‍♀️
---
Body blocking can absolutely be toxic. What are you talking about? If someone teabags and clicks a flashlight at me, I’m camping you. You made your choice. I made mine.
---
My point was that my anecdote was just as valid as your anecdote.  
---
Most games I play don't go down unexpectedly for hours.  So you've already shrunk your sample size down significantly.  Further, of the games I do play that have gone down unexpectedly for hours most do not have a time limited event with an entry fee attached to them.  So you've now shrunk your sample size down to a statistically irrelevant number.  
---
Social media isn't the correct place to request compensation for lost access to a paid service, but requesting compensation for a paid service outage is absolutely a valid response.  Gaming companies that care about their reputation generally preempt that conversation by providing a token of some sort.  Are you entitled to it?  Probably not.  I'm sure Bhvr offers no SLA for online services.  Does it reflect badly on Bhvr if they do nothing?  It should.
---
*arm detached for handjobs*
---
Actually I share the same experiende as /u/Penquinn1
---
Don't you think you same argument cpuld be used in reverse? Only because the games you play don't give out compensations then it doesn't mean noone does it.
---
The only way I want to die tbh
---
Don’t go down defending me. You don’t deserve that!
---
Well I didn't really want to write out all the specifics. There's already a lot of text in the picture, and listing all the add-ons, perks and offerings that get complained about would have just been a little excessive
---
Stats of this kind are so interesting to me!
---
First and foremost I’d like to notice the fact the Nurse now requires skill to play and not everyone can get an easy down with her. It just surprises me that it’s considered weakest cause I still think Nurse is top tier. Not everyone can use her, yes, but that makes her even more lethal. 
---
Second: Freddy being the strongest right now it’s only imo cause of his slow down build. He def doesn’t require a nerf but does add ons need rework cause going against a Freddy become boring: they all use the same build with the same add ons. 
---
Third: who’s getting the next rework? Beside Oni before release and the already announced Spirit, I think Clown should be given a better chance to fully express his play style. 
---
Forth: I disagree with the popularity of the Plague cause I believe after the Dying Light perk rework, this killer has been overused and became way more popular and lethal than before.
---
But if you're a dick and don't help your teammates, you can still derank if you escape. The emblem system makes it hard for survivors so they play seriously.
---
Iridescent hunt&gt; bloodhunt
---
That mask is hilarious, I'd wear it just for the memes.
---
From what I've seen on this sub most survivors are only toxic when the killer camps or tunnels. I know that some survivors are just toxic but protecting a survivor so everyone can get out isnt toxic.
---
The intensity of the blinded animation is higher, it does not blind the killer faster, it USED TO but because you could combine it with other addons that also reduced time to blind "insta-blind flashlñights" became a very abused item so they got nerfed.
---
They should at least offer bloodpoints, people only have weekends to play sometime. It was freaking sunday.
---
How dare people rescue their teammates
---
Don't be dramatic. Changing his slowdown addons with effectively little counterplay will only harm those who have no skill with him. Mainly, his power is still gen teleportation (map pressure) and chase trapping (chase power), he doesn't need a slowdown power.
---
Actually I share the same experiende as /u/Eviltew
---
Don't you think your same argument cpuld be used in reverse? Only because the games you play don't give out compensations then it doesn't mean noone does it.
---
BL resets when you hit a survivor or kick a pallet and junk, if you've done nothing but hold W for 45 seconds you're doing something wrong
---
This was more clever than I expected, well said good sir!
---
The time should be doubled by 50%, like End Game Collapse.
---
Haddonfield is 3rd safest, according to the stats.
---
I’m 18 and my basics look like this. If I were to put effort into something it might end up better but this kind of stuff you see before you would be my basics.
---
What'd they say
---
No they were just being an asshole
---
Well if you aren’t sure don’t say.
---
autohaven gas heaven is my favorite specifically. it has fair loops, good gen placement, really well balanced imo.
---
Bro I hate those add ons as killer. I've been against it once as survivor and he gave up and just played regular. Its fucking painful to run.
---
Imagine dying.
---
this post was made by D/C gang
---
Maybe you do bones next time
---
It’s gone 100%, don’t spread misinformation based of what you think it was. If you’re not sure just read patch notes or look at this wiki.
---
I find it ironic, how the role that objectively has the most power to victimize and bully others, makes itself out to be the victim and has cemented this false narrative of killers being weak and victim to an unbalanced game. At red ranks the game is objectively killer sided, considering the 60+% kill ratio when they strive for 50%. The stats don't lie, but killer mains do. You'll see them running to this thread trying to disprove these stats by saying stuff like "WHat AbOut DcS", when those are probably already accounted for by the people doing this professionally.
---
So Freddy needs a nerf but via his add ons.
---
I do this shit constantly in the Hawkins lab dropping down from the top floor.
---
I like Father Campbells Chapel. It's a decent map for both sides and it's aesthetically pleasing
---
Institute
---
Very claustrophobic and perfect for stealth killers.
---
Red ranks on both sides are hard. Yes to the bp's, but the whole ranking system needs to be reworked again in my opinion. It's too simple to calculate the many variables that go into a match. I know it's never gonna be perfect, but there's definitly a better way to rank up.
---
I remember back in the dark ages where killers could basically farm points with autohit bots... and rank up.
---
I shit you not, rank up! Because survivors would find the killer, notice he is a bot, let it take a few hits to heal themselves, then decide to maybe finish the gens and leave and the killer would get bloodpoints and rank. Awful shit.
---
I like Haggonfield, because i main trapper. It takes survivors out of their comfort zone.
---
Least they didn't pause at the crotch or boobs. I know I would have.
---
Relatable
---
Since when? I'm never toxic and I face tons and tons of toxic survivors.
---
Lots of survivors are toxic just for the hell of it. Just like lots of killers are. Not sure why each side thinks it only goes one way lol
---
Never thought I'd see a list in where Freddy is the strongest killer while Nurse is the weakest.
---
Times have changed
---
If I have no reason to suspect a nearby survivor going in for the save, I automatically assume they're all away doing gens.
---
I patrol of I see or hear something.
---
If I don't, I go straight back to patrolling gens.
---
Don't worry about pissing people off for sticking near a hook if you have cause to.
---
r/perkbydaylight
---
Best thing I did as a killer main was start playing survivor sometimes. It makes it easier to mindgame as killer and understand how survivors think.
---
probably because people can't play her correctly. If you don't know how to use her, she's easily one of the weakest killers in the game. I also think it has to do that she is the strongest capable killer that ALSO has the worst counters for her. If people have flashlights, Urban Evasion, and even some communication; her power becomes drastically weaker.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love Lisa, and I've mained her for a bit but when you run into her power counters shes basically a powerless slow killer, which you most likely will in red ranks. At least the flashlights
---
So how much did you have to pay her?
---
16 seconds can make all the difference still
---
Survivors have gotten significantly gutted when compared to how they were a year ago. No more instaheals, many nerfs to survivor perks, whether direct (such as Balanced Landing), or indirect (Object of Obsession indirectly nerfed thanks to the undetectable status), as well as the removal of quite a few infinites. 
---
I don't think killers got nerfed quite as much by comparison, and even when they did rework some killers, they mostly just got rid of the outright broken stuff and left their base kit perfectly functional (Nurse), or outright improved them by a huge margin(Freddy). 
---
There's also the fact that it's not that hard to reach high ranks as survivor, especially if you're being carried by more competant teammates. So you may end up with teammates who can't carry their weight, and get roflstomped by a competant killers (and high rank killers have to get there by their own merits since they can't be carried by teammates, so they'll wipe the floor with the dumb apes in your team).
---
I’d rather they just change DS to turn off if another survivor gets hooked
---
Youre hung up on an irrelevant fact. My response answered the OPs question regardless of the reason it was free in the first place.
---
Nope.
---
Just get better
---
Me: *opens gate* ok time to wait for my teammates before I leave
---
Killer: *Downs teammate with noed*
---
Me: yeah, ima head out
---
Freddy doesn't even need the slowdown addons to do well, if those get hit by the nerf bat I won't be too sad
---
If they do something to his power (snares) I'd be worried, though
---
Sure some people do, but it shouldn't be an expected outcome from it because some people choose to do it. They had server issues and tried to fix it as soon as possible, but people are saying they should give them compensation for it because they missed a day of potentially grinding. It's not like BHVR purposefully shut down their servers to stop people from working on the rift, and it's not like they just sat there until Monday to fix it. The servers weren't even down for an entire day and people want compensation for that? It's just a really shitty attitude to have when a game has issues and the people complain that the devs aren't doing anything about it, when they are, and then say that they deserve to be compensated for that time it was down when it wasn't even a long period of time
---
Well of course you love it lol dont all survivors love it?
---
It's the most survivor side map in the game
---
Seems like an interesting mix of new and old Freddy. I like it.
---
I was expecting Spirit to appear out of nowhere and close the hatch...
---
Swallow you whole + Agitation + Iron Grasp = Basement Party Bubba
---
Id really like to see some more stats like average hooks per game for each killer at red ranks, average pip rate for each killer at red ranks, and average chase time per killer at red ranks. Just seeing average kills doesnt tell you much, a NOED nurse could easily get a 3 hook 3k and a decent hag could easily get a 9 hook 1k. You can get a 3 hook 3k and still depip and ive seen plagues that played well and got a 3k still depip. Also idk if they can track such a thing but id like to see even just these stats but instead of factoring in all red rank survivors, just show the stats vs red rank 4 man swfs to get a better understanding if top level play. Finally i see some people saying that this proves killers are over performing but id say the sample size of red rank survivors is also not very telling as it is way harder to reach red ranks as a killer than a survivor with this emblem system and id wager if the difficulty of pipping for survivor was made to be as difficult as it currently is for killer, this sample size would include people spanning all the way back to green ranks (which everyone knows is true because at reds you still get potato teammates but there are no potato killers).
---
And so I can get those sexy BBQ stacks.
---
The second I saw ADTR post this, I thought the same thing hahaha.
---
Jobs give free money with 0 effort or work
---
I dont want the devs to think this is acceptable by using it tbh, they keep track of perk use, if none of us use it then they'll realize somethings wrong with it
---
At high ranks running NOED is actually a good strategy. No one expects it and it directly counters gen rushing
---
I don’t keep up on patch notes and updates but I’m fairly certain they made unhooking quicker and safer. It’s really almost impossible to stop them from unhooking if they want to, even with camping. But for real, I’m just in it to at least annoy someone. Send me an angry message and I’ll know my job is done. I’m glad there’s at least one person on my side!
---
I believe I said I might be very wrong. But there are many ways to express the correction without coming across as a jerk. How about you read into that sometime.
---
Killer Main I assume?
---
I am doing this without Adams perk. Am currently at 39 out of 50
---
They got it once before and it's not like the terminator franchise is too hot there new movie bombed.
---
Nah, Genrushing the killer to fucking oblivion is what I'll do
---
There are plenty of things they've fixed and balanced well in that time too. Someone already made a comment on this thread about some of the things they balanced and they were really bad things that needed balancing, but people just act like all the devs do is make dlc cosmetics for money
---
They Devs mentioned that why will be implementing Disconnection Penalties soon in their November 2019 Dev Update.
---
I didn't really look what people were asking for a compensation but an extended event is definitely understandable. I guess I jumped the gun and assumed they were asking for something unreasonable like a free costume or something. I'm just tired of impatient people who think everything should be perfect always and forget that things happen, we make mistakes, and there are other people just like us working on this game.
---
All autohaven and macmillan,chapel,and new preschool
---
I think theyre fair maps that are good aesthetically 
---
Also fuck lerys
---
They're a cheesy way of getting out. I understand if all 4 survivors are still alive they would've gotten out anyway, but if it's 3 or less survivors with a few gens remaining it feels very awful suddenly seeing those undeserved escapes.
---
Damn that was clean, great job!
---
I know but im not english 100% im a french canadian. And i don't listen in my class.
---
Something about the addons being too op and the commenter hoping they'll be nerfed to shit
---
And amputee
---
Now we just need to pressure BHVR that they would nerf ds what they claimed not to do.
---
Yeah I was thinking if it was because I’m just bad
---
Man the skill, the intense gameplay, why BHVR do this to us.
---
It happened to me too against a spirit in "the Game"
---
Great meme, even better username lol
---
Yes exactly I've slowly begun to realize this studying the other survivors as well as my own behaviour during a match. I realized no matter what one of my team mates would always unhook me and block me as I used self care. It was eye opening in a way
---
I would only ever play as him
---
This is 100% not true. People will be toxic just for the sake of doing so. I am happy to say that I have many many more matches where everyone plays fair but there is the occasional jerk that is JUST there to irritate killers. When poked, I poke back.
---
Yes I agree change it up but if they are gonna keep generators as the main objective then making the skill checks harder would delay them being done and make it more interesting for the survivors.
---
Ruin and other directly noticeable Hex perks are overrated imo because everyone immediately looks for the totem, they aren't bad perks though I just don't know why some people rely on them without complimenting it with something like Haunted Grounds
---
I just watched a poor demogorgan baby get fireworked and tbagged at the exit gates :(
---
Preschool. I think it’s pretty even and fun.
---
I'll do you one even better: just don't unhook your teammates at all. Leave it to someone else,  maybe they'll find a more convenient time, LOL
---
For killers: Toss up between Dead Hard or Decisive. 
---
Did you make a mistake? Make a bad play, or get mind-gamed? Press E and make it to the pallet. 
---
Meanwhile, decisive existing at all gives survivors 60s of invulnerability after a hook.
---
For survivors: Rancor.
---
Do you know a buff is something that make the thing better. But its a nerf and a nerf is for op thing. If u already know this sorry but, its special to said Freddy buff. He was the most weak killer and now he op
---
What new stats?
---
To me the scariest is The Pig or Huntress when she specifically has the Mother Bear head or the Satanic Goat head on. Something about animal heads on people just freak me the hell out.
---
Had a match as ghostface where a dwight was Urban evasioning towards the meg I hooked and I just used night shroud and followed him while crouching, probably gave him a scare when I exposed and downed him faster than a toxic nea will teabag after a pallet stun
---
You can’t be serious? Nurse will always be the best killer in the game as long as she ignores literally every survivor countermeasure, which she still does. There’s no way you think she’s the worst in the game.
---
Agreed. Forever Freddy is dull as fuck. At least old Freddy had to work to put survivors asleep, by getting up close. New freddy can be in the other side of the map and never see the survivor in question but they’ll still get the gen slowdown eventually. It feels unfair.
---
God forbid you’re the poor sod who gets the obsession that can’t wake up. It might not be a massive slowdown but how on earth is that fair? You’ll permanently have the gen slowdown and never hear his terror radius.
---
His snares, fake pallets and teleports are all ok.
---
Id be up for changing his lullaby too personally. I think hes too fast to need it. Huntress has it but shes slow and its a 45m warning
---
No. No I am not.
---
He's the most daddy of all the killers
---
Sorry to be that guy The devs confirmed they are alone between trials
---
&gt;Actually the most shocking thing about these stats are that killers are obviously killing people far more than survivors are escaping.
---
The kill rate was a lot higher than I thought it would be, especially after the last stats dump we got earlier this year.
---
I suspect that the matchmaking change where groups are now matched according to the top survivor rank would work slightly in the killer's favour, and possibly EGC would as well. As a survivor I don't feel like I'm dying any more than usual.
---
It would be interesting to see a breakdown of the new stats to see how the kill rate is per rank, or per rank colour. I know that weird matchmaking can make the data unreliable for anything too serious, but maybe there are still some trends to be seen.
---
 Just add to library and praise Paulie Esther
---
Let's look at the facts. Best killer in red ranks- freddy. Best killer overall- trapper. Also funny to note that the nerf to nurse that people have said wasn't bad has her at 3rd worst killer in red ranks. Git gud.
---
That would be a huge oni buff wdym
---
Then why would you want that?
---
How do you make the little perk icons. I have a perk idea but I'm bad at art
---
I’d love to see these stats without NOED. I feel like the killrate would plummet at low ranks
---
Sides* at the start of the text.Stupid keyboard.
---
People get mad when they see noed but I'm honestly fumin if I see fire up
---
lol look at the whinny survivor main.
---
Wheres the lie?
---
Totally stopping the timer is too much, not stopping it at all is why we are having this conversation. 50% is a good compromise.
---
Oof, poor thing
---
I agree with almost all you are saying. However, if I have no Idea where the survivors are, just that they are likely close (like with bbq or crows coming back) I would still consider it camping, (well, patrolling, still bad, not the same as facecamping tho).If you dont know where the survivors are, so you could well run around the hook for a whilst without giving them any chance to be rescued (at least without beeing tunneld) and theres still a chance that there isnt even someone around (bbq can be blocked by other perks or lockers, people running into a diffrent area of the map might have alerted crows and be long gone).
---
BHVR has a tendency to over react (Mettle of Man, Legion, Pig being a few examples). His slowdown add ons are mostly status effects for the dreamworld which as it stands is really easy to escape.
---
*science rules*
---
Wouldn’t work, e.g hooked in basement, 1 person loops basement, others are on gens. Etc just stay near hooks
---
I was watching Football all day, didn’t even notice DBD was down lol. How long was the downtime?
---
it's not exactly a 3-way tie. I'm assuming you're referring to her, Hillbilly, and Freddy. Sure they all float around 75%, but she's played about 50% more than them.
---
Killing on average 75% of her survivors is a LOT more than killing an average of 75% survivors on Freddy and Hillbilly.
---
She is an obvious outlier on the graph, and is clearly performing well more than any other killer. The only other outliers the graphs show are Nurse in (All Ranks) category which can be explained with her nerfs and difficulty to use, and Trapper who is the posterboy of the game.
---
Eh I think it's better if Jaws is fast but the trade off is that he cannot be on the raised portions. Especially since if someone is on a hill then they're not doing a gen!
---
Yeah it would sadly but there is no way to make a change to make it fairer to higher rank killers and also not influence lower ranks. 
---
I'd like to see something like what they have on friday 13th where you collect parts so you can escape in a car
---
Been feeling the same since the start, specially because I started playing survivor thinking it would be the harder role.
---
Killer puts you in the spotlight, as survivor you share blame with 3 other people, you can get carried, cooperate just fine or be dragged down because they can't rub 2 braincells together, its all around. And even if "your team" isbeing steamrolled you can choose to start playing selfishly to conserve your ranking or get a few more points before the inevitable dead.
---
Killer is at the center of the whole game the whole time, no down time unless you want to survivors to chug on gens and say at the end how ez you were. Also, the first person view feels so restrictive compared to the survivor 3rd person view, which makes you fall for simple tricks and lose sights of them, the game being so dark by default definetly does not help.
---
The best way to play killer is by being "deattached" from it, dont mind the ranking up, dont mind not getting a 3k or 4k. You got to go into the game thinking about just playing not about winning, just like how survivor is easier when you stop being stressed about getting moried or because you died by being tunneled or abandoned by teamates.
---
No but they dont give money to the people who get employed after the work is done either.
---
I started playing after the event the two DLCs were completely free for me no work required. same for most of the player base. How they became free is completely irrelevant. Dont give a shit.
---
OPs question was "will they be free" and I said "they only did that for older ones they dont do that anymore" how those two became free is completely irrelevant. Are you looking for a thank you or something? I just dont get why youre so hung up on this irrelevant detail.
---
For Those Who Have Heart album best album
---
I am very much not a fan of the new singles :(
---
they obviously have like no perks on jake theyre probably leveling him
---
He should of used his power
---
I agree with what you said and I totally see your point.
---
But what really irks me is that the moment I even tried proposing a different argument from the one in the post i got showered in downvotes and people not even trying to understand my opinion telling me I'm entitled.
---
Do you play in SWF or solo? I play with usually one other and we die FAR more than we used to since that matchmaking change. The killer will be ranked against us (red ranks) and we'll get like a green or sometimes even brown rank survivor. It's bizarre. I think you're right though, it has a lot to do with iffy matchmaking.
---
I also think some of the reworks to maps and making pallets generally more unsafe, nerf to instas etc may play a small part in it. I'm interested in how many are "kills" or DCs too. Perhaps it will slightly even out when people aren't DCing to avoid the punishment.
---
When she was realeased she had directionsl woosh inside her terror rsdius and people didnt knownhow to play her right
---
The weirdest thing is that all the spirit mains said she wasnt too Strong and they needed to let her be. While she is the most played and almost #1 in kill%. This means that even the newest players Are getting decent kills with her
---
Oh... No wonder playing Freddy is so easy for me.
---
Ahhh yes 90ping constantly great experience
---
When I play killer I love Lery's. I love playing stealth killers and I have the most success on this one when playing Ghost Face and the Wraith.
---
Pig actually has a pretty high kill rate on that chart
---
Um nurse was good cus people who were very skillfull with her were the best. saying unskillfull means i can put a killer in anyone's hands and they do well. that is NOT the case with nurse at all.
---
Okay but in all honesty, imagine how utterly terrifying it would to be repairing a gen and thinking you’re safe and all of a sudden a big ass cat-man with a bat comes running at you full speed and has really creepy music playing as well. 
---
**this is also me wanting a creepy killer with equally creepy music, not like Freddy but imagine  cute music box when a killer is near, terrifying.
---
bruh...
---
On par with Hillbilly
---
Thank you :D
---
Oooooooh
---
If you want to believe there’s no difference between a typical rank 15 and rank 1 player then you do you. 
---
It’s really not that hard to imagine how a better understanding of team composition will affect people’s playstyles. You can play under the assumption that the SWF will be communicating and more likely to save each other, or try and take aggro if you see the baby being chased, for example.
---
Because it wasn't even down for an extended period of time and they were working on fixing it as fast as they could. And yeah I would tip them because I'm not an asshole and I understand that they make next to nothing without tips
---
Still counts as a kill/death tho.
---
Idk man shirtless Myers is still up there
---
 It was at this moment he knew, he fucked up
---
Thank you kind internet stranger!
---
She’s weakest across all ranks because she’s hard to play I assume. It doesn’t mean she is weak though.
---
I got sandbagged twice last night by the same fucking nea. I don't think it was intentional and apparently the killer agreed, nea got away and I died on first hook.
---
What dude stranger thing and Ghostface came with alternate cosmetics not big changes but you get torn clothing for Steve and Nancy and a white shroud for Ghostface
---
Teammates present and future: I give you 100% consent to GTFO when NOED activates.
---
You have to take into account how many Nurse players are learning her. There’s really no in between with Nurse; you’re either a potato or a god. I’d imagine that massive learning curve while you’re still a potato is what influences her into being the weakest. Meanwhile Freddy’s insane map pressure is relatively easy to control, hence him being the strongest.
---
Well I don't really feel happy because the game is still not working for me. I can't even get past the start menu.
---
From the looks for it Coldwind Farm is the most survivor sided map unless I'm reading that wrong.
---
THATS IT, I AM GETTING ME “insert favourite toxic killer build here”
---
Didn’t you notice the distinct lack of archive lore?  Or not getting rift fragment from it?
---
If there's 3 or more gens left to do and your teammates stop before completing them then they deserve to lose.
---
I came into DBD the day it launched for PS4. I had been playing the ever-living shit out of Friday the 13th, and knew that on PC DBD had gotten Michael Myers, so I was interested, and besides that I just love horror in general.
---
So I come home with the game, pop in it and then just fucking...have no clue what in the absolute hell is going on. No tutorials, no tips, just dropped in on my head with no fucking clue what I was doing. Again, I came out of Friday the 13th, so I was expecting something a bit more similar to that, and was just baffled that I could fight back against the killer. 
---
Then I learned the hard way that items used during a trial are gone if you die, and of course all I ever did was die, because I had no clue what I was doing.
---
So I try to do research and learn the basics and I'm left thinking, so I have to essentially do this Saw-esque shit to escape a trial? Shit, Pig from Saw should be in this. (And later she was put in, so that's cool.)
---
What happened was I got frustrated and ended up just going back to Friday the 13th for a while. Then one day Friday the 13th got slapped in the face with the on-going IP lawsuit and it was announced that no more content would ever be added to the game. And I decided to come back for another go at DBD and give it another chance.
---
Now I play it pretty much daily and the game has come a LONG way from back at the console release when I first started.
---
I wondering how much of the Trapper play is due to the Tome.
---
Explain how I’m being a jerk, I’m just telling you to not spread misinformation as there’s no point it doing so. 
---
It would literally take less time to look up that you’re wrong than commenting something wrong and saying “I could be wrong tho”.
---
I agree completely
---
A small price to pay for salvation.
---
There are some perks that I find overrated but still good to use (BBQ &amp; Chilli being one of them), but some I just find... Uninteresting? Like ruin for example, I get it, it slows the game down, but since it's a hex perk that anyone would expect and immediately look for, I just find it "weak". And enduring? Meh, it's alright, but I prefer to NOT receive a pallet to the face, thank you.
---
I only use NOED when I’m trying a new build and don’t know what else to use
---
Oh I totally understand, I just think if anyone saw this chart like a year ago you would be laughed at
---
I loved those posts where people kept saying "Spirit isn't picked that often, you guys are being ridiculous". Well...the stats don't lie.
---
You honestly think survivor is harder to play then killer? We are done here then because that is completely wrong. Have a nice day in fantasy land.
---
THIS
---
I always make sure to eat that toxic survivor alive by any means necessary
---
All indoor maps are deadliest. Makes sense tbh much harder to hide in brighter lighting since all outdoor maps are nighttime.
---
Hmm, seems to be working for everyone else, must mean it’s your connection. Check your wi-fi connection, your wi-fi could have just gone down temporarily, it happens.
---
LOL
---
That's not your problem,is the problem of the people that you get matched with. There will always be someone that thinks losing is an excuse for DC'ing. Sorry to hear that(anyways I didn't know people dc'ed against Myers xd)
---
“The beatings will continue until morale improves.”
---
If dbd was able to implant such a mode. They can lower number of gens needed to be done and/or change spawns so they much farther than each other so a killer can't 3 gen them. 
---
Honestly if you ask me, I think gens are the biggest problem of the game and there needs to be something else instead. They are boring for both sides.
---
Here’s the thing...if the exit gates are open and the killer downs you, my ass is out like NASCAR. I’m zooming out of there. I’m not about to play games with a potential NOED/Blood Warden combo. No ma’am, no ham, no turkey, no jam. Bye.
---
Are you newer? It’s happened to me maybe around 10 times and I’ve got 1000 hours on survivor alone so it’s quite rare.
---
Works in low (high number) ranks, but the times ive gone against red ranks they usually wait until after the hook to open the gate.
---
What I’d also like to see is the most popular perks with each of the killers. As some have said, it’s pretty crazy that some weaker killers have the same kill percentages as stronger killers. I think that might have something to do with running NOED etc. on the weaker killers and not on the stronger killers. Just a thought.
---
An ignorant rank 20? I'm red rank both sides douchebag. Who is here whining about how hard survivor is lol? You are a baby.
---
bruh
---
Wut
---
ITT: People who can't read graphs
---
No, I was chatting with 2 other friends yesterday and for 1 of them it was working juat fine but for me and my other friend the game just wouldn't work at all since the fix.
---
Which was that everything to do with saving someone from hook is toxic?  
---
  
---
yea ok bud.
---
Seriously? You can’t dodge a 5th dimensional Billy charge? Trash noob....
---
Dude Meg is the best girl
---
BBQ is a big one for me, if I don't see any auras then I know to give the area around the hook a patrol before I go patrol gens.
---
True
---
Looks like this Michael has been bullied :(
---
It becomes camping when the killer ignores you while running away from the hook to go back to it.
---
&gt;Because that's 3 people tied up, off gens.
---
&gt;If your team has meta perks and moderate skill, and you have BT, just diving on it and unhooking in front of (but a good distance from) the killer is the optimal play. Even without BT, with a bit more distance on the killer you can bodyblock for him.
---
&gt;Unless you misjudge the distance or otherwise potato it somehow, you'll be back to 1 player occupied in short order.
---
Well, yeah. A killer hooking a survivor creates map pressure, which is fine. It's a reward for the killer and it's good design imo. As far as the situation you described that would he fine too, but that's not what slarg originally wrote. He described a situation where he farms you mid chase, and you get slugged (so no BT)/instant hooked again for phase 2/maybe death. 
---
Between that or tying up 3 people, tying up 3 people is usually a better choice. Obviously, having BT and getting a sneaky unhook in is a different story, but we were talking about farming somebody mid chase, which is dumb. Also body blocking is a different story, but that's not what we were talking about.
---
There's not much interaction between the two, you can unhook yourself yes - but better to wait for the killer to be a safe distance from you first.
---
That it may be but the stats still show that even though it's in the top 3 of safest survivor maps killer stay has a 53% kill rate meaning survivors die more than escape there.
---
And also the introduction of dedicated servers with weird pallet hits, crazy huntress hatchets and also dead hard not working...
---
I wish she would have an add-on that makes her traps immune against flashlights
---
Lol
---
spirits kill rate isnt the highest because of the amount of dc's she gets
---
I am all for adding Jason but I feel like he’s going to be hard to implement into the game without him just being a basic M-1 killer...
---
“Balanced around 50% kill rate.”
---
By BHVR stat she is
---
Yeah thought so just makin sure thx
---
Trapper, at all ranks, is the most popular killer, but I wonder if they included players that JUST started out? If so, it skewed the data for some of these killers
---
The odd thing about clown is that he's amazing at crushing tiles.
---
You can force the pallet drop as you're going up to the tile.
---
... But that's the thing. The only option the survivor has besides dying is going through pallets liberally.
---
So if the survivor plays "correct" at every tile, with the clown actually using his power ideally, the first survivor will be dropping every pallet as the 3 others are pumping away at gens.
---
He's not particularly interesting to play against or as. He's one of those cases where even though on paper he's weak, he's not fun to go against.
---
Meanwhile it's POSSIBLE to loop a Billy or Huntress on a single tile and not be forced to drop the pallet for a while, but they'll still outperform other killers because there are more "decisive" moments where the chase is up in the air and either party can succeed at gaining distance or making a risky power move.
---
I’m happy about the prayer beads change but other then that she can stay the same.
---
Ew disconnect penalties good thing i didnt plan on playing again because it takes a hour to even find a killer lobby
---
BBQ
---
I try to get on there servers for switch but it does not work.
---
I like the demogorgon map for its infinites and looks (yes even though most of the pallets are unsafe) and its unique playstyle for chases
---
Benedict Cumberbatch?
---
I was a little confused because he was watching the hatch earlier, but I guess he didn't know I knew where the hatch was too.
---
You can do them solo or with people
---
Compare Freddy’s kit to Clowns. Freddy is better in literally every single way. He isnt slowed down when he places his snares, he doesnt need to reload his snares, his snares are not as avoidable as bottles. You dont need to aim snares because you can easily force survivors to have to path into the snare. Freddy can teleport to a generator and can fake out the teleport. Theres an entire wake up mechanic. Oblivious effect while sleeping. Non directional lullaby. Freddy goes in and out of invisibility when you are awake. Freddy is shorter which makes playing certain pallets much easier.
---
Despite all of this, Clown still manages to maintain a 60% kill rate at red ranks. But Freddy rework is just massively upgraded clown
---
you’d be surprised
---
That's fair, however both sides have something like this. Killers have moris which are arguably much cheesier.
---
Imo pure killrate is not honestly that telling of a stat, which is why I wish we would get hooks instead. A killer can down 1, camp them to death and get genrushed then kill one more person in the endgame and it counts as a 2k, while someone else can get 9 hooks and still only get a single kill due to unlucky timing. Not to mention NOED, which prevents any even halfway capable killer from getting a 0k realistically speaking, even if they got absolutely shit on in the match.
---
Yeah, I was being sarcastic. It's a common conception here and elsewhere that you you basically can't win as a killer in red ranks and survivors always escape and bully killers on top of that (despite there being countless hours of video evidence proving the opposite...). Yet the stats show that the reality is not that way. Nor was it last time around they shared stats, where the rank 1 survival rate was also in the 40%s, and global survival rates also below 50%.
---
There are still issues on the survivor side (and on the killer side), but the killer main narrative that the game is impossibly survivor-sided has always been bullshit. As the stats time and again have shown, the game is actually fairly killer-sided for public matches. Even back in the day where there was a variety of genuinely broken stuff in the game, there were killers that won many or most of their matches. And if the average player kills 2 or more survivors more often than not, you can imagine what the kill rates of good players look like.
---
No, im saying your point is stupid.
---
Or he could walk on land at the cost of slower movement speed (4.6 base/4.2 on land)
---
Imagine DC’ing to a garbage pallet wasting Claudette who can’t loop.
---
The killer entitlement is that they should get 4 kills every match. Many new/bad players simply aren’t okay with 2 kills being considered a win.
---
Urban Evasion boiiiii
---
right now!!!
---
Honestly it's pretty good if I put it next to other games. Most games, especially new games with better graphics, I usually have to tone down the res or other graphics settings. Dbd runs perfectly at my native res with Ultra enabled, so I would say it's better than most games I play.
---
Yup, she’s pretty much a camper
---
The game with w o o and bl lots of holes to jump down
---
Those are the worst ones. The ones you played fair to and then they message you and act toxic anyway.
---
My guess would be either something that gives him stealth or something that works like a detection perk.
---
Trapper already got bear traps covered, there is already a few killers with instadowns (either at command or by building up a metter) and Jason is mostly known for being able to track down and find people instinctively while also being pretty silent (at the start).
---
So my guess would be a passive ability that lets him see survivor auras (maybe when they start running or when they start doing a generato at a certain distance from him). His secondary ability could be something that allows him to lose his terror radius for a few seconds at command, maybe it builds up with chase time?
---
More like bring a new form of life to game that didn’t have it
---
It's certainly not impossible, but does seem unlikely. I think I took about 3 weeks to play killer first, but unless you're playing really sporadically (and I'm already playing quiet sporadically only), you probably tried it out for giggles ad curiosity at some point after *years*?
---
That interesting these you u use the F word (which I used liberally) as the middle name of Jesus Christ and then ask for blessings. Not very religious myself, but there is definitely something wrong there.
---
There are times when I hook someone and BBQ doesn't show anyone at all. If I expect 3 survivors to be a live and somewhere out there, and I see 0 with BBQ, I'm gonna be fairly certain that someone's around.
---
Could be very wrong because of perks and/or locker-play, which results in a situation like what you described... The killer roaming around searching for someone nearby, with everyone being on opposite side of the map.
---
 -----
---
There's also times where I'm aiming for a 3-gen and have hooked the survivor in the middle of my patrol. So I just continue my patrol as I've done all game.
---
What the fuck did I just see
---
"Hey, you provided dog shit service but here is my money because you chose to work in this line of service, thanks for being useless, have a nice day spending my money !"
---
8 hours is not an extended period of time?
---
This pretty much. Most killers don’t complain about solo survivors. They complain about highly organized swf teams. I would like to see that data before coming to any conclusions regarding balance
---
When your SWF group each take a hit on the way to the door when the killer is clearly rushing for your cheeks, it’s *extremely* satisfying
---
I would like to know what sensitivity the hag is on
---
I made a face camping wraith rage quit by unhooking all of the survivors he was face camping just by luring him to pallets near the hooks giving him a hit so I could run through him and stun him on the opposite side of the pallet and safely unhook the survivor. So he ended up face camping, got no kills and the gens got completed in like 5 minutes. 
---
Somehow he never learned, but I guess that's why hes a face camper.
---
I believe it comes free with some xbox pass
---
Its all I can do in response to the OP post
---
Thinking you are owed a 4K is your problem. Devs have said 2K is a win. Whiny ass killers who aren’t satisfied with this screaming at the devs constantly is only going to make it so that no one wants to play survivor anymore. Then good luck getting any kills at all. No games.
---
Which still screws over the person who just got unhooked from a survivor perspective (solid play for the killer though). In that case, you’ve got two people not being effective (or more if other survivors are running to heal up the survivor who got downed). Unless the killer feels like being nice and going after the person who unsafely unhooked you, you’re just spending the whole game dying or hooked which is no fun and strategically very poor in most cases (if a swf group can coordinate it such that it’s effective, genuinely kudos to them, but for people who play solo it’s really lame and generally not effective)
---
Let me rephrase. NOED can be prevented, Adrenaline cannot. Just do totems, 4head. No matter what you do, in most high rank games, survivors will get a free health state once gens are done.
---
I remember the first time I played Hawkins as killer.... It was not a good time. I only got 1 hook and that was because the survivor I'm guessing felt sorry for me as they let me down them and hook them after the other 3 left.
---
I got lost and turned around so damn easy it wasn't even funny.
---
Love the hair especially, good drawing!
---
I mean they only come with one set and most property owners don’t want their characters to look different like micheal Myers didn’t have a alternate cosmetic with his dlc but Laurie did but that’s cause she changes outfit same with Freddy and Quentin and Freddy
---
o ya ive seen this porn gif
---
Yeah but calm spirit is a teachable of jake, so yeah... and with an at least level 5 jake you should have some other perks better than saboteur, or am I wrong?
---
Short to be said, some games don't need to be filled with chatterbox characters. It's not like we want every game to become Bubsy.
---
A few audio clips of him being a perverted asshole to some of his female fans and stories of him pressing said fans to send nudes and whatnot, even a girl he knew was underage (clip is obviously in spanish since he is from spain) I remeber watching a few vids talking about it on youtube but I am afraid I cannot link you currently.
---
If you search in youtube for "ochido being a creep" it you will definetly find them.
---
I like it!
---
&gt; Just makes for very unfun games
---
Your opponent is not responsible for your fun.
---
Can that person please bitch about NOED and praise Pig?
---
Freddy is strong too, but Billy is higher across the board.
---
Lol search and destroy is just I'm all Ears on crack
---
What else are they meant to balance around? 1k? 3k? 4k?
---
On the face of it, 2k makes the most sense. However that shows one major flaw in the game - tunneling. If a killer can get 8 hooks, 2 hooks per survivor then all 4 will be left at the end meaning all 4 on gens meaning they'll probably escape. If the killer does 3 hooks on survivor 1, 3 hooks on survivor 2, then 2 hooks on survivor 3, he still has 8 hooks but now there's only 2 survivors left to work on that last gen. meaning chances are they aren't making it out.
---
They really need to address this in any potential sequel. I feel it's too late for them to do anything in DBD now though as it would require massive change.
---
I was playing legion and this is after the rework nerf of him so hes trash. I was on the preschool and had level 1 ruin. This was purple ranks bit they were allergic to gens so after 6 hooks before a gen was done, I literally dropped this jane by my ruin. Nope, they didnt cleanse it. They then tbagged,2 disconnected, and they all added me to a chat. Apparently, I was being toxic for hooking them and not letting them do gens when I literally saw 1 gen with 5 percent progress on it. They told me legion is op and I'm a baby killer for using him and not allowing gens to be done. I told them about the ruin and they told me that they dint need my pity. I get the pride part but the complaints made my head melt in how little sense it made.
---
i only play DbD with my friend thats why i don't play as killer, I do complete daily challenges for the survival sometimes.
---
But what about the non licensed killers and survivors?
---
I'm not a killer main, I rarely play killer outside of the tome challenges, but 4 man SWFs are always going to be a cancer to the killers.
---
This is fantastic.  You would think that if red rank survivors are better than non-red ranks, we would see the stats for killers either stay the same or even drop, because the game is supposed to get more difficult at higher ranks.  These stats suggest that the game actually gets easier for killers as they get better at the game.
---
I play about 95% of my games solo in purple and red ranks. My skill level has improved a lot since the last stats were released (I was probably in green ranks then), so that might be why I feel like I'm not dying any more than usual.
---
I didn't even think about the DC numbers, specifically against Spirit. I agree that it'll be interesting to see the numbers at the end of the year after the update (although I suspect the DC penalty may only affect PC/Switch, since PS4/xbox are not on dedicated servers).
---
Exactly
---
Other than Forever Freddy, Insta Saw Billy, Live Build Spirit, Ebony Moris, and possibly Nemesis Legion, what is actually overpowered on the killer side?
---
"That makes me want to bully you more!" Goes the toxic survivor.  The cycle must continue.
---
I get that but then they should really find a way to make them less laggy. They sometimes feel like they are at 20-30 fps while the rest of the game runs smooth and it's really frustrating
---
Thank you! I've noticed that people get all up in arms about Killers nerf requests, but as soon a BHVR listens, they change their tune. Just look at Nurse lol.
---
When they nerfed bl that was annoying but acceptable if they nerf ghostface next I'm buying a new game
---
Or claptrap from borderlands
---
thx, he is an awful guy. I wonder how he looks
---
I literally facecamp survivors who sandbag
---
I need head on so bad
---
All the damn status effects are even worse
---
This is the most accurate description.  Dream snares are better, don't require you slowing down, and you get to teleport to generators.  
---
Clown has to throw the bottle predictively, reload every four (or more depending on add ons), and has a slight delay before he can swing after throwing.
---
Me with rank 20s:
---
" i guide others to a treasure i cannot possess"
---
If you respect pallets survivors will abuse it by taking extra loops. In like 90% of cases you should just walk or attack through a pallet, because goose stepping around it actually wastes more time.
---
Doesn't matter. You won't be happy til wraith is considered strong.
---
No just no.
---
Make sure you run it with Quick and Quiet.
---
can't even loop properly lol
---
No it isnt... You can even still exploit the myers house by forcing the killer to vault the safe vault.
---
NOED is meh. You can always tell who runs it. I used to hate it don't have a problem with it anymore. Honestly, I just feel bad for killers that use it unless it's for a very niche late game build. I mean, think about it. They know they aren't very good and that the survivors are gonna power all the gens. Why else would they waste a perk slot solely for one-shots in the endgame when they could get better use out of a perk for early or mid game? Because they know they can't win without it. That's the only reason I don't run it. I want to improve during the game, not rely on a perk to secure the 1k I know I wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
---
Epic repost
---
How salty do you need to be to call legion op?
---
How does a shark walk.
---
And I don't want to imagine Jaws with tiny legs
---
You mean the oni and yui? Still PTB sometimes they don’t include alternate outfits I haven’t tried the PTB yet so I’ve no idea but when they make an original character they usually do the extra small cosmetic
---
how?
---
Watch them and if you like them, follow/sub or whatever. I dunno why you are asking randoms
---
You should look behind you more frequently
---
Léry's, The Game and Hawkins because I love the claustrophic feeling of making my way through the maze. As a survivor it's much scarier to not know what's around the corner, and I'm good at navigating so I enjoy the puzzle
---
Haddonfield and Badham's also because I love the suburbia feel, especially when I'm playing more urban slasher-like (non-fantasy) characters
---
Ormond's is also really beautiful, I just have not been able to get confident on it as killer yet :(
---
Dennis seems like the obvious choice for killer, tbh
---
2 kills isn’t even a blank pip most of the time.
---
You gotta bait them into swinging and hitting the invisible wall.
---
You do realise, yeah community bitches on both sides but they look at killer and survivor stats to decide on things like nerfs.
---
Anyone who thinks whiny comments change the course of the entire river probably don't even have the brain power to drop a pallet...
---
I cannot agree more.  This difference in what counts as a win is super easy to fall into because of the nature of the game: every piece of feedback in game tells survivors "RUN, SURVIVE, GET OUT!!" and killer gets all the feedback of "KILL THEM ALL, NONE MAY ESCAPE!!" So when BHVR comes in and tried to tell people "no no, 2 deaths is totally a tie," and no one really believes them. 
---
There's actually a lot of interesting ideas for changing that kind of in game feedback, but that's a different post, ha.
---
Oh dude I have seen many grown ass being childish than a child ever could on multiplayer gaming. I am a sucker for horror slasher movies and thats why I love this game otherwise I am exclusively a single player gamer for games with good stories
---
The goal is for all Killers to be viable and have equal up/down sides.
---
The thing is, you HAVE to run ruin, otherwise the game is over within 3 minutes.
---
Also, don't respect pallets. Just run through. Good survivors will notice you respect them and abuse that by looping you once again, which costs more time than just taking the pallet.
---
It doesn't surprise me the slightest to see Clown as the weakest killer in the game.
---
Wraith is sort of cute, he looks as if he still has a shred of humanity left in him the entity has yet to consume.
---
He uses his tail as a pogo stick and bounces after survivors
---
I agree that game balanced could become fragile, but 50% is what they stated they are shooting for, which is interesting because they did not state their justifications for that rate.  And I wonder why they balance around kill rate.
---
Yes it does
---
Magnum Dong: The sound of your flopping magnum dong alerts the Killer to your location every 2 seconds. When the Killer comes within 2 meters of your location they’re immediately forced to their knees in awe of your massive splendor. Lasts the rest of the trial.
---
&gt; It becomes camping when the killer tries to protect their objective and win the game.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Yes I'm a paying customer and expect a working product. Is that too much to ask?
---
If your cable provider had problems during some football match and couldn't show the game that you are paying for wouldn't you expect them to fix the problem?
---
Also when your job and your responsibility is to deliver a working service you can expect to work Sundays or holidays if something goes wrong.
---
Lets see stats of how many current players there are and the rank distribution.
---
Lets see stats of exactly how many 4 man, 3 man, 2 man, and all 4 solo games there are percentage wise.
---
Lets see stats on how many games resulted in 0 kills, 1 kill, 2 kills, 3 kills, 4 kills.
---
Lets see stats on how many generators get done per match.
---
Lets see these stats over a solid 3 month period to get some more accuracy.

Sssssssh, don’t think about it

I play Freddy without addon, he doesn't even need it to get 2 dead survivors and 4-3 gens left
---
Wow, I totally forgot about that fact... good point.
---
Iridescent shards/level is carried across both roles
---
Oni has the frosty eyes and yui has a recolour on her shirt (pink-white to white-pink) I'm just annoyed because they used to actually put effort into extra cosmetics (specifically ace and feng)
---
Yeah, pretty sure Nurse was already the weakest in terms of total average before the Freddy rework, so...
---
Like a spaniard nerd, there are videos where he is shown.
---
Also I believe is "ochido exposed" that will give you the most info about how awful he is.
---
do all the killers movements seem physically possible?
---
Every single person I've introduced this game to has gotten hooked, and seen "Escape M1" or whatever and then followed the tooltip and killed themselves. Hilarious every time.
---
This is accurate
---
Bruh
---
Weird, I don’t remember saying it was original. Only that they were good in ghosty, like the OP asked
---
EAT SHIT ASSSSHHHOLE
---
For extra pepeganess right?  Makes sense
---
Nerf pallets.
---
Or better yet, ban spacebar.
---
So it just shows what was clear from the begging if you play both sides, on average killers are doing super well and only organized swf can stand up to them.
---
Red rank solo experience as a survivor is pretty miserable at least on ps4. People just go down in  seconds, don't know basic game mechanics. I texted one person why was he sitting still hiding, while legion used his power and could see him. Rank 2 survivor didn't even knew legion could see him. Ranking up is just way too easy, until bhvr figures out how to not let potatoes into red ranks killers will be over perform, as red rank killers are brutal and don't let people do any mistakes. 
---
The worst part is I don't even know how start balancing this game, as skill gap between survivors is wild. One person can run killer around for 5 minutes using one or two pallets, while same rank survivor will go down in 2 minutes using 4-5 pallets in a process. Same with killers, one spirit can destroy team with no gens done, another one with prayer beads get 0.
---
You see I'm totally weird.. cause I see crunching in front of the killer as weirdly submissive not toxic. It's toxic if you do it after a pallet stun or torch blind...
---
But at the end of the game when it's like do we farm or you just gonna hook a bitch? I think it's more a form or comms... 🤷‍♂️ I'm silly like that.
---
But I totally agree... be shitty, get funnelled. You deserve it.
---
Unnecessary. You can hear how close the killer is.
---
That's why you open the  Exit gates 99% until the person is hooked
---
I don’t know if voice preset work with survivor breathing but if you want to hear footsteps I am not 100% sure but I think turning mid up will work. Am going to get platinum headset for ps4 soon so I don’t know if I’m right
---
Manchildren.
---
"devs said 2K is a win" but 2K doesn't even let you 1 pip.
---
No...
---
&gt; Less BP, MUCH less. Let's say you down someone right after they get off the hook, you get 1/4 of what you would have gotten say for hitting someone that wasn't on the hook.
---
This idea is bad and you should feel bad.
---
I just can't fathom that. I really, really can't. I know they have to exist but I refuse to believe it lol. It's just like football fans who throw shit at their TVs when their team is losing. I know they're out there but I just cannot imagine an adult throwing a tantrum like a toddler.
---
I’m not insinuating you did it on purpose, but it is spreading misinformation regardless or it being a mistake or not. You did cover yourself by saying “I could be wrong” but that ties into my next point VVVVV
---
I didn’t mean to come off as rude but I just see it like why comment if you could be wrong. I see it as either don’t answer or look it up then answer. I apologize for coming off a jerk seriously I don’t mean it that way, my bad. Other guy totally could have looked it up via wiki or test server patch notes.
---
I agree that a 4K should not be the metric, but to be fair to killers, a 2K usually is at best a single pip and at worst a de-pip.  The only guaranteed way for a killer to double pip (and a double pip is usually regarded as a true win for killer mains) is a 4K.  I am not sure what the solution is, but getting a 4K should not be the barometer of killer success, and that may ease some frustration on both sides.

Wraith: Everytime he rings his bell wild dogs come and eat him
---
Trapper: He starts in a bear trap and can't escape 
---
Billy: His chainsaw is replaced with an air conditioner
---
Bubba: He is now 0.1 % slower when he charges his chainsaw
---
Hag: She shrinks by 50% and now can't see over survivior's shoes
---
Clown: He is affected by his own gas and laughs himself to sleep
---
Legion: Their power no longer applies sloppy butcher, oh wait..
---
Spirit: Everytime she uses her power her husk can be tickled by survivors, if she laughs she is broken out of it.
---
Freddy: Freddy is replaced by Edward pingas hands
---
Doctor: Shocking survivors electrocutes you
---
Huntress: has imaginery hatchets that she thinks she is throwing
---
Pig: Poking her snout puts her to sleep
---
Plague: if she drinks corrupt purge she catches a disease from the survivors and dies
---
Nurse: Everytime a survivior is injured she has to heal them
---
Ghostface: He can't t bag

Demogorgon: Like someone said if he uses his power he gets lost in the upside down and can't escape without calling eleven
---
Oni: His club is replaced with a balloon animal
---
No, there are plenty of anti tunnel perks already
---
The fact that almost every killer is above 50% kill rate and people are still crying everyday is astounding to me.
---
In balance in any other game you’d want it to be as close to 50/50 as possible.
---
With these stats there’s no more denying that killers who are crying need to shhhhh.
---
Yes we all know 4 SWF teams are a problem, but these stats show that you’re not running into them every game clearly.
---
The cap is there because people were hacking the game and adding billions of BP. Instead of having to do the work to individually ban people they put a BP cap on.
---
Yeah reworked Freddy is basically better than Clown in every way.
---
Man, if you brainwash ppl with crap like "Nurse is gutted now" so nobody attempts her and she becomes "weakest" killer lol
---
I would’ve thought to see Moto Moto because they’re both grey but this works too
---
He should have gotten a Santa outfit
---
You know Killers can open gates too now
---
Nope. But go ahead and walk away feeling like you’re better than someone for no reason.
---
You made my day
---
Hillbilly isn't easy to use. I tried so many games i just can't get anyone with the chainsaw (without addons). Same goes for Huntress and since i'm so underperforming, survivors actually think i'm drunk in the endchat XD
---
Whiiiich it doesn’t. You just fucked yourself out of your own points fam
---
le someone who's better then me at this game as killer has arrived
---
I've mained her for a long time and honestly Urban helps her more then it hinders her. If the survivors urban around everywhere then your traps will stay untouched and you'll be set for short chases. If anything We'll make it is her real counter.
---
50% makes the more sense from a design standpoint, 60% is okay too I guess.
---
We're closer to 70% tho. And, most surprisingly, higher kill rates at red ranks. (it was completely the opposite last time) But anyway, the numbers evolution is coherent with the direction of the game this year. (EGC and overall nerfing of survivors)
---
I think we're in the greatest spot possible for a mori nerf with these numbers. And I guess it also showcases why the devs chose to begin with the "nerfing" reworks (Nurse, Spirit) before going through the planned buffs (Bubba, Doctor and Clown soon I hope). Freddy will maybe get slight add-on changes in the mean times (Forever Freddy amirite).
---
"And I start throwing garbage all over the killer!"
---
2K isn't a win as it's not even 1Pip
---
Lmfao exactly
---
Love it.
---
If a 4k was the ONLY factor on whether you win or not, then killers would be playing a lot more dickish. It isn't hard to 4k or even at least 3k with hard camping, tunneling, slugging, Mori's, and most killers strongest add-ons. Problem now is that if you do play like that, that is usually the cause of getting a black pip or even depip since the emblem system actively discourages that.
---
A while ago, pipping was entirely based on how much each survivor was hooked and/or sacrificed. So that if you killed at least 2 people, you were guaranteed to not depip no matter what. This led to killers just facecamping people on first hook if they felt like the survivors were playing "unfairly" just so they wouldn't "lose" the match and secure their rank.
---
While I understand the pipping/emblem system we have now isn't perfect, it does still promote healthy and engaging playstyles for both killer and survivor to actually put an effort into make the match more engaging itself.
---
I mean barely anyone wants billy nerfed bar his instasaw addons
---
Lots of killer mains run zero add-ons on stuff like Billy, Huntress and Spirit and do fine. Even at red ranks.
---
Yeah the game should put the percent chance to escape (Affected by offerings) with a "Failed escape attempts speed up sacrifice progress" warning. Almost every time the novice players try to escape thinking it'll work.
---
I'm pretty sure the "How to play"/survivor manual thingie in the main menu says it's a 4% but that info is buried sort of deep. I think it definitely should be made more clear that it's best to let yourself hang and await rescue, and attempting self-unhook is mostly a last resort action.
---
The original Pig for sure. There's something so dreadful about seeing her gaze at you through a filthy pig mask ready to pass judgment on you through mechanical torture
---
It's a less is more thing.... unlike the supernatural killers, Amanda simply chooses to play her games to their final bloody conclusion, and that puts a chill down my spine
---
Exactly my point? Reading comprehension?
---
Things like scratch marks and auras (as changing those do not affect gameplay) should have specific colorblind settings while things such as blood (already hard to see unless you run bloodhound) should not have specific colorblind settings.
---
No he throws trash at the survivor insta down wouldn’t you sh*t your pants if you see Danny Devito come out of nowhere and throws trash at  you
---
bRuH
---
Surviving doesn't let you 1 pip depending on rank.
---
Yea my build will be similar to yours except I’ll probs have d strike instead of adrenaline.
---
“How dare people rescue their teammates”. Those words don’t equate to “your point is stupid”. If you’re trying to say something, just say it. My point is some survivors are toxic and deserve just treatment. If that’s a stupid point, alright. I don’t particularly care.
---
Because leveling up your characters shouldn't be the game, the game should be the game.
---
The goal is for you have an easy time as survivor and for all killers to quit playing. Keep crying about nerfs I'm sure the game will be fun with nobody playing killer.
---
Power update: Shrek is love, shrek is lythe
---
The worst is that everyone online thinks you're a guy so they always tell me how small my penis is too. Like, yeah, dude. Literally nonexistent, just like yours.
---
The Hag has some of my favorite movement. The way she hops through the window, and licks her fingers clean after a hit.... she is so animalistic and horrifying
---
lmao next you'll say that the nurse change ruined her
---
That is ok.
---
I know that.
---
Yup my line in the sand is hillbilly. They touch him im done. Survivors can have fun sitting in lobbies because they have made killer so unfun and difficult to play.
---
I'm not colorblind and it's hard to see the blood because dark red on green in this game is like light yellow on white because of the fact that if I do not look close, it is hard to see. Sure, things such as blood should not be able to be changed, but if it's the auras or scratch marks, then yes it should definitely be able to be changed.
---
An entitled survivor !
---
I would be the first to tell you it did nothing to her base kit.
---
Why did you just respond so passive-aggressively to someone agreeing with you?
---
When the obsession are stalk by myers and he got infinite stats 3 and tombstone. You are already dead
---
*Niiccceee*
---
I definitely agree
---
Whenever I’m killer I weirdly like the game. Whenever I play survivor I like Lery’s, if I’m a runner for the team. Or just a good old auto haven when I’m a gen jockey.
---
if the bell on the choker jiggled as I ran it'd be an insta-buy
---
Honestly I agree, if anything I think BHVR's balance philosophy rides too hard with what they see from the numbers alone (being the only explanation for what they do to Pig). This was mainly just. Yknow, a shitpost.
---
That being said I've mained killer basically since I got the game and while things are never perfect we've been doing much better since pallet vacuum, DS and the hatch mechanic all got changes in our favour. It's been basically nothing but buffs and QoL help since 2.0
---
Nope you are just a baby killer. You should have played around that key that they might have found in a chest and you didn't even get a chance to see. Git gud everyone knows leatherface is op.
---
You're Leatherface and thus have access to Franklin's. While it can't completely counter keys it will make them much harder to use. 
---
I hate keys too but there's at least actions you can take if they're a serious problem. Franklin's, tunnel the guy with the key, even dodge the lobby.
---
So I assume bbq and ruin were already in?
---
Really not picking one side or the other, as I play both. But if all anyone has to do is bitch until something is changed then itll be more like Dead like Deathgarden.
---
well they shouldn't Urban everywhere, that's just bad play. What it does do is make hooks save a lot easier against her, one of her strongest aspects is that she slows down hook saves a lot, simply just due to fear of setting off traps near hooked survivors, so others will crouch up to the hook to go for the save, which takes a lot more time and allows for her to keep her pressure strong. Urban speeds up this process quite a bit and allows for people to save others fast enough before they hit next state or she gets the next down, etc.
---
Was the person being picked up Bill?
---
To be fair it's kinda the same with survivors, a lot of new/bad players simply feel and believe they're playing better then they are and deserve to be getting better results. Killers feel cheated out of a 4k when they tunneled 1 person all game and got gen rushed, survivors feel cheated out of an escape when they play poorly and mow grass with their teeth in the corner of a map then die.
---
This is just an issue with every game with a ranking system though not necessarily just DbD at least.
---
Very
---
Then you just power walk away from the locker or the killer doesn't do shit because they're in the middle of a chase. What an awesome perk.
---
Okay short example basement can be used for 30 seconds easily, longer if killers bad. Iron works of misery basement is right next to the infinite, yes not a true infinite but lasts a minutes+ just running it with no skill required.
---
Yeah it’s so stupid you basically have to 2 hook everyone and 3k to pip as killer, but they want a 2/4 if you get 3 you are over performing.
---
Uhhhh. Goldfish memory I don't remember haha.
---
I still can’t see her xD
---
Well said! Yeah I agree I never liked using mori so nerfing them will get no objection for me especially since this is the first time in awhile where I don’t feel too stressed playing killer, sure there’s a few games where gens fucking pop off like nothing but that’s not very often either. Still the killer nerfs so far have been pretty fair I’m excited for some actual buffs for the lower end killers going forward
---
Maybe should have taken Franklins instead of Noed, considering they had a way to escape before all the gens were done anyway.
---
Me walking into the preschool
---
"If the average player kills 2 or moore survivors more often than not, you can imagine what the kill rates of good players look like." -- Well said, and captures more accurately what I was trying to say above.  The truth is that good killers are far better than good survivors, unless it is a 4-man SWF.  But I would love to see the data on 4-mans to better gauge true high tier play and balance.
---
Ya I don't quite understand what they are shooting for. Meh. Pretty good job so far.
---
I think the devs just want killers who aren’t automatic 4K wins so to speak.
---
Dont listen to the clear facts about the game?  What kind of thinking is this lmao.
---
Really surprised to see Pig's kill rate, wouldn't have figured it would be that high.
---
Yeah I agree with this. I’m a killer main, and maimed freddy before the rework. I love playing survivor too though. I have always looked at winning more in terms of if i 1 pip as killer. I would like to see what the stats are behind the rates or killers pipping each match.
---
Nurse is still the best Killer in the game.
---
Spirit is no where near Nurse level but even still is the second strongest Killer in the game, and will remain so even after these nerfs.
---
Yeah,that kind of tunneling is unfun and ruins the game for the person affected. Even if you aren't toxic some killers just tunnel you to get that "first kill value" or "one person less doing gens". What I'm saying is that tunneling to punish toxic people is reasonable,but that kind of tunneling clearly isn't.
---
Yes the game is dying everyday since day one , we know
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e1kng6/whats_the_worst_game_youve_ever_had/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Well i was doing a 3 gen strat, and i didn’t look at their items in lobby, now i’m gonna be careful and lobby dodge every time i see a key
---
I forgot to mention that lol I had an entire extra paragraph going into things I wanted to see about survivor that I deleted to retype and just forgot to retype it.
---
I know awhile back they did something along the lines of like the ratios of solo queue, duo, trio and 4 man SWF groups and the different escape rates. I think the same statistics release they MIGHT'VE done something about which perks were being used the most on each side and which ones seemed to most often appear in games that had varying escape and kill counts.
---
Then job done. There are no automatic 4k killers. The best killer player with the best killer and perks loses against the best swf.
---
Forever Freddy coming in clutch on Monday morning.
---
Yeah she's hard to play but still easily the strongest killer, especially with addons.
---
If you spam ready up in the queue lobby you can make a friend or yourself blue screen on ps4.
---
Also those numbers are kinda weird I think they count dcs as kills and since even I’ve done it(dc), every iri head huntress get 4K and most pray bits spirit, etc.
---
Yah stats aren’t great, need to show hook averages as well as kill rate.
---
Bamboozling maybe. Idk about bullying.
---
Haha, that’s the sex number!
---
If you get a 2k you are gonna stay where you were you should be is what they are saying, if you get a 3k-4k youre gonna move up in ranks because youre currently better than your current rank.
---
Wait what! I can’t believe Freddy is strongest for both.
---
Interpreting stats and why are they the way they are is a completely different thing than just going "look this number is there and it´s true because numbers"
---
The meme said problems which all of them are, including but not limited to bugs.
---
No they just have better addons
---
Zathura &lt;333
---
I have one power is he can sneak up on people and in a chase if it last more than 30 seconds it activates rage mode and you can destroy pallets instantly if stuned and damaging generators take 1 second also it gives a 50/50 chance of hitting them in one hit. he can also hide in lockers
---
And they still have yet to touch gen speed and ds while better is still 60 seconds of you can’t get hooked or even taken out of a locker
---
It's not a matter of belief, it's a matter of fact lol.  The way the ranked system works and the general lack of much skill input makes ranking up pretty dang easy.  Which makes so many players' obsession with rank seem very silly.  If anything, level is way more indicative of how good someone is, and that's moreso because they probably know less about perks and maps and stuff
---
People come for new content, but they stay for a game that works consistently. If the game crashes after a few matches, that's just a buggy game, and people that aren't dedicated to the game are only going to tolerate that a few times before they just drop the game. At the endgame collapse update, the game peaked at around 75,000 players. Now we're down to 25,000. A game can have a shit load of content, but if it takes forever to get into a match, or matchmaking puts you with players that don't match your skill level, then it wears away at your willingness to keep spending your time on a buggy game and not another game that works so much better. TL;DR: Functionality &gt; Content
---
Oh no, not ruin and bbq. Whatever will I do. I cant do skill checks or hide behind a gen. You're such a toxic killer.
---
Would be nice to have better queues in red ranks. Need more killer mains for that to become a reality.
---
Why doe?
---
Boosted survivor triggered. You think it's a joke but keep nerfing killers and the game effectively dies. You only have to lose a fifth of the plauerbase in theory.
---
Tru3 is an arrogsnt manchild with an inferiority complex, change my mind.
---
What is sweaty? One who tries to win? I've been called sweaty after giving 2 people a hatch. Sweaty is such a bs term cause everyone who wants to win gets called it.
---
Is there a place you can go to actually see killer kill rates?
---
Danny Devito, killing himself on the hook: "Suicide is badass."
---
Where did you find this information? I would have said spirit or a very skilled nurse would be above freddy
---
It would be nice to see if killers or survivors pip easier. I find it much easier to get to rank 1 as a survivor tbh (and I play like total shit, but with a friend). Kill rate at 50% does not seem like a proper balancing sweet spot. Often you don't even safety pip with 2k.
---
I made another comment (that is now at the bottom because downvotes) of a link to stats posted less than two hours ago. They show all killer pick and kill rates at both all ranks and red ranks.
---
Well,to get that infinite tombstone you need to stalk A LOT,you can get the 5 gens done before the Michael reaches tier 3 with that add-on combo. I think it's perfectly balanced because of that but I guess that people don't want to lose because of add-ons.
---
Still I think that DC'ing against a regular (no tombstone) tier 3 Myers is very dumb tho.
---
Well there’s my new spine chill perk icon
---
Have fun up your own ass.
---
Imagine maining in dead by daylight and then complaining about balance
---
:D
---
Not to mention you get punished for killing people too well. "This guy is performing way above his rank's skill level, so we decided he should depip."
---
If a survivor cries about ruin or bbq which are the least annoying perks then they are just sensitive. Most use bbq just for points and ruin goes in 30 seconds anyway. Sounds like you play at yellow ranks as killer and no one complains because no one knows shit including yourself while you run the universal perks.
---
No I know it goes both ways I play both sides but being toxic back isnt the best way to handle it
---
And thank god. In general it is a shitshow vs her ^^ esp if she decides to go basement
---
Coming from a truetalent PS4 players fan , i take this as a compliment
---
Killers rage quits seem so frequent these days. Used to be 90% survivors but the past month or so it has been 90% killers for me
---
on paper it seems fair. When talking about these percentages, people seem to forget that the 4 survivors are other people too. I guess this comes from the killer being 1 person, so it truly feels closer to a "single-player" experience in that sense compared to survivor gameplay where you actively have to rely on other human players to distract the killer, save you, do gens, and so on. Throw on the fact that it is an asymmetrical MP game (with the added weight of it being literally the only successful one in the past decade that has had staying power, so it has nothing to compare to) to make it even more confusing for balance.
---
If a killer was balanced around killing all 4 survivors, then there would be virtually no point to even try on the survivors side, if the killer is already inherently designed to kill you all already, with a slim chance of MAYBE 1 of you getting out every now and then. This can already be seen when going against extreme cases like pre-nerf Nurse with omegablink, Ruin, and a Mori with a handful of other killer builds similar in strength to this, where survivors literally just didn't try or were simply wiped within minutes of the game starting.
---
Having the balance at about 50%, allows for survivors to work together to survive, but also make risky decisions on whether it's worth it to go for the end game save or just leave, since there is always a chance that either they can make it out together or die together or just outright leave each other.
---
I know people like to parrot the idea of "well what about the killers fun?" when talking about OP survivors, but this goes both ways, having an equal chance of winning on both sides is important in an asymmetrical game.
---
Call me a dick, but if I catch a glimpse of SWF in the lobby, I'll more than happily tunnel someone if you unhook them within me turning around. Generates extra salt for the group and I can then double down and camp the fuck out of whoever was farming their friend. 
---
I can get back a pip, but the satisfaction (and, to be honest, free BP) from getting two kills like that is priceless.
---
Go toolbox with emphasis on charges instead of speed, then be the dedicated mechanic. If someone gets picked up, hop into a locker to avoid the BBQ aura. Use spine chill + sprint burst - when it lights up, pop sprint but then walk instead of sprint to get outside their search radius without leaving scratch marks. Then just get a little lucky.
---
Popping 3 gens isn't actually that hard, but unfortunately like most challenges you'll have to forego normal play and ignore teammates to increase your odds of completing the challenge. GL
---
Nurse isn’t as good, with no add ons. If she uses 2 blinks and hits you, you can run away in a straight line and by the time you’ve recovered 2 blinks it’s not enough to gain that distance. Plus after nerf her kill rate has dropped at red ranks to 60% whereas spirit is at 72-75
---
This is one of my fav Huntress or Trapper maps, its just that any other killer there makes me want to die inside if there's at least 1 BL.
---
Demo's model and POV are upside down
---
No. I am completely serious and have been this entire time. Jesus christ.
---
You were saying its annoying when survivors save their teammates. Whether they're toxic or not doesn't matter, its good to help your teammates. If you want someone to dislike to die, then kill them. Dont complain about their teammates doing something as basic as rescuing someone.
---
Instaheals provided no counter play
---
I agree with them, and i also think she is rather behind spirit. I just stated what BHVR stated trough their data collection.
---
That's a nice strawman you got there.
---
Why the need to nerf good killers, why not just buff other killers and/or survivors?
---
Not all swf are like that last part lmao
---
I would love to see stats about key vs mori succes rate, since many people keep comparing them.
---
Your girlfriends ex and you.
---
&gt; (blood and scratchmarks)  
---
&gt; They are already the equivalent of neon-lit flashing billboards. 
---
Blood isn't bright unless you're bringing bloodhound. On most maps it is already hard to see. Scratch marks and auras are way easier to see.
---
Ah thank you, I didn’t see the comment originally.
---
I would love for ebony and cypress mori's to be removed, the only one they should keep is the ivory one. 
---
I just hope they don't take the stupid idea of "only usable after two hooks" crap that morons keep posting here. If a survivor is on death hook there's no point to using a mori on them. It's a waste of time.
---
Yep she is considered one of the weakest. Slightly better than Legion.
---
It looks like that because of the way they show us the numbers. Like in the red ranks table, why are ranks 3 and 4 included? That just ruins what would actually be interesting data. I understand if they would include rank 2s but 3&amp;4 just should not be in there imo
---
Git gud
---
Slightly above it over all ranks, most in the middle between 2 and 3 kills. (And there is the question of how useful it is in the first place, or are you advocating for a slight nurse buff?). As far as red rank goes, usually 2 kills=depip, so it shouldnt come as a surprise that killers hover around 3, since people who cant regularly get 3+ kills wont contribute a whole lot to the red rank statistic. More a surprise that it isnt above 75%.
---
As a camping killer, this just makes me SO. MAD.
---
Yeah she has the worst stats, because she's arguably one of the hardest killers to play. Once mastered she's the strongest killer in the game IMO.
---
Oh yeah lots of messages from claudette mains as well but for some reason I mostly recive meg messages. All thought Dwight's can be annoying let's thank them for (for the most part) being silent.
---
Judging by your posts it’s hard to tell
---
According to data Nurse is also worst killer. Does not make me think she is not belonging to the S anymore. Still does not make Pig great killer.
---
I will come down on lerys like the hammer of thor!
---
I don’t understand why people care about ranking, it gets you literally nothing.
---
Who gives a fuck if you rank up or not? The way people generally measure fun in this game is kills/escapes.
---
Also with every killer above a 50% kill rate it’s no wonder they balanced it around killer having to do more to rank up.
---
I just joined the conversation and you said level, not rank
---
I believe it was on a dev stream. But I know they said ghost face has a success rate of 65 and that’s below spirit and spirit is below Freddy.
---
Freddy
---
Why would it be hard to tell? It's not like sarcasm is literally dripping from every comment. No it's not like that at all.
---
Billy mains be like ^
---
Seriously, not only is he the most toxic Killer; the people who play him are just as bad.
---
I read that as Eminem points and thought this was some 4D joke I didn't understand
---
But he still has a 60% killrate! How is that the worst killer? Literally every killer has over 50% killrate. What more do you want? 100% killrate? Might as well expect to die every game as a survivor, I guess.
---
Tbagging is not toxic at all. If you think tbagging is toxic and tunnel because of the tbagging, then you are continuing the cycle of endless toxicity according to what you believe is toxic.  If survivors think tunneling and camping is toxic and they tbag because the killers they get against always do those two things,  it might make the killer want to tunnel and camp because the survivor is tbagging.
---
People who camp and tunnel because of tbaggers and those who tbag because of camping and tunneling are what creates an endless flow of toxicity in this game. If people did not get mad at either of the two, what both sides think of as toxic would not happen as much.
---
Hell, people do those things because they are thought of as toxic just to get a reaction out of the other side. Why does this happen? Because of the "toxicity cycle."
---
How the toxicity cycle works:
---
1. One side does one thing even if it's not used to tilt the player (example: tbagging, which can have multiple reasons)
---
2. The other side gets mad at that and does something the other side thinks of as toxic (example: tunneling)
---
3. The first side thinks every killer will do the same and continues to tbag
---
4. The second side keeps tunneling because someone tbagged.
---
This is why you should not tunnel because of tbagging or tbag because of tunnelers. It makes the other side want to do their "toxic" thing more because of what your side is seen to do a lot.
---
stabface was 5 bucks tho without maps or survivors
---
Shut up baby dick. Stay at rank 20 if you want to bully the killer.
---
Ghostface for me it makes doing a generator stressful
---
the chart they just released literally mean nothing. It's an average across all players at certain ranks. You can only judge a Killer's ability and Survivors ability to outrun them at top levels of play.
---
If you honestly think Nurse is worse than Spirit, or more so the worse Killer in the game by BHVR's released chart, you're just a bad Nurse. Spirit can't do shit again god windows/pallets. Nurse can and is still the ONLY Killer who can, not a single pallet or window in the entire game matters as Nurse.
---
No i was a hillbilly on xbox
---
Considering that Nurse is one of the original 4 killers available when a new player begins the game, I'd say her performance rating is a pretty significant problem.
---
Absolutely not suggesting she needs a buff, but maybe she isn't the best killer to open the game's experience with.
---
His power lays in ability to counter pallets and looping. Thats why his chases are quicker and Survivors in doubt if they are safe so they are not so daring. Which is great.
---
Big facts
---
anytime theres afk it default goes to crows. first one, then two, then three. you have to do something productive to shake them off
---
I’m in the NYC area so my ping is always under 50
---
Agreed, just stated what BHVR stats says, not if it could count to anything judging how they balance the game.
---
hahaha sexy number lol
---
Killers are bitching about being the UP side and demanding to nerf any good Survivor stuff.
---
Local man so evil he can walk through fucking walls
---
Yeah you are right it really isn’t how odd? Also leather face is most op killer please nerf bhvr also make survivors take 4 hits instead of 2 it is too hard to not go down especially when I jump in locker
---
Still counters DS, which is strong. Ebony with two hooks condition could help counter a lot of endgame D-strikes, when the perk is the strongest.
---
I mean true but they basically have the same definition. Again I apologize for my typos disregard it.
---
Every killer is a rework of an existing mechanic because this game is a poorly optimized mess of amateur code.
---
I just got lucky and managed to get jockey without being spotted
---
Remember when the only strat against legion was to run away as far as you can in one direction? Dont miss him
---
Perfectly said. The real ones know that a good nurse will, what’d you say, wipe the floor? I like that.
---
Well it could be done different way and still be fun, Friday 13th in all fairness managed to make this excelent fun. And if killers spot you, you know you messed up. Which makes me feel thrill of the survival each time. This does not achive it sadly. Again just my opinion.
---
people tend to cluster her traps in small areas, or think it's a good idea to place 6+ traps on 1 hooked survivor from what I notice, which takes away her strongest attribute of map pressure. That and they overly commit to chases, which is the worst thing you can do as a 110 killer with no inherent anti-loop capabilities.
---
I've faced plenty of Hag's who played like this, and at best they walk away with 1 kill that they overly facecamped with all her traps while all gens got finished in the meantime because she was so paranoid of her very first hook of the game getting saved.
---
It's not a great perk to use in a chase but it is hella fun to pull off when it works. Also it synergizes with Inner Strength and Q&amp;Q so well.
---
Statistics only have value as doors to questions. Killrate is completely irrelevant if you don't know the reasons behind it.
---
I would also like to see kill rates versus solo survivors.
---
Am i missing something? You literally just healed behind a wall then started egc without the whole team lmao.
---
Yeah screw those survivor perks none need to be buffed. Like Left Behind shouldn't have ever been balanced before after the End Game changes came in. Oh and Calm Spirit, that's so stupid why did they balance that to actually have more use in the game lol stupid devs. Oh but let's Buff Noed and ruin because killer mains keep crying about how OP survivors are. You clearly don't play both sides and only favorite one side. Play it for a change, you'll realize killers are bigger babies than what survivors could make to be.
---
Just saying. I assume the red tank here assumes tier 1 killers and survivors only. To be a tier 1 killer unless you only play like sport and Freddy you’ll inevitably be incredibly good at the game so can almost play Antoine. And as there aren’t loads of rank 1s anyway that means you’re looking at data for the best players out there. I’d say looking at purple ranks is the most efficient method to judge this. Low rank is easier for killers as they’re  stronger than survivors so require less skill. However too tier survivors are likely swf or at the least extremely optimal, knowing every single loop outcome and play. Whereas tier 12-8ish is relatively balanced, Both sides are as good as each other and won’t be extremely competitive/ too casual. If you get that data you can see how viable killers really are. Saying the best killer mains can play leatherface at rank 1. Isn’t realistic across all players at all
---
Niiiicceeeeee. Nice juke.
---
Because BHVR has proved incapable of doing so. Not to mention Billy is easily the easiest Killer to do well with. Unlike Nurse, Spirit, or Freddy, Billy requires almost no practice.
---
Maybe it’s just my perception. Someone mentioned the animation makes him seem faster so that may be it? Dude just feels like an Olympic speed walker so I was curious if anyone felt the same.
---
https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/864/BDOZ0GYZMPZW.png direct link man.
---
I still have haddonfield nightmares from  me playing spirit
---
Fred matches for me are always a nightmare, pun intended. He has incredible patrolling and anti-loop, so he'll be pressuring everyone and downing fast. Not to mention his passive slowdown if you want to fight sleep. Also, slowdown builds are really common so the match slows to a crawl. It's nice to see a shit killer go from bottom tier to top tier in one rework, almost makes you want to see that happen with *certain* other killers.
---
Not saying he's OP or anything, I just clench my cheeks whenever I see a sleep timer when I load in.
---
I mean how did he not hear her behind him she was so loud
---
They had stats for every all ranks.  Every killer but nurse had over a 60% at all ranks, simply because console nurse and low ranks nurse suck
---
Funny, since I'm a Killer main.
---
I'd argue her strongest aspect is shutting down long loops like houses in Haddonfield, wretched shop, etc. And while I get where you're coming from, I don't think her main focus should be protecting hooks. more so it should be how well she can snowball off of well placed traps, so she can get the hooks rolling.
---
ehh kind of seems like you were on a high horse aswell. What did you expect when you explained to them that them escaping was just a part of your master plan?
---
I mean,of course tunneling because someone teabags you when you get stunned by a pallet is kinda absurd and that using toxicity against toxicity isn't going to solve all this toxic cycle.
---
I'm not trying to say "tUnnEl evEryOne thAt cRouChes".What I'm complaining about are about those toxic people that literally only play to mess up with the other side. For example SWF groups that quite literally bully rank 14 killers that just want to have fun and chill or facecamping LF's. Of course tunneling and camping is awful but,do you think toxic people(both survs and killers) will stop being toxic if the rest of the community is nice? I don't think so.  I agree with the toxicity cycle and all that you said but there are just people that won't change. And if they continue like that they should be punished.
---
Tru3 isn't a very good player. He is litterally playing the most OP thing in the game. 
---
An actual good killer main playing nurse would do good. You also say that the issue is people working on gens together is the issue, thats not how you do gens efficiently, working on separate gens is the best way
---
The killer isn't under obligation to kill all 4, they are under obligation to kill 2 at least. A 2k is a tie.
---
I have a friend who will always say he lost if he doesn't get a 4k. Sometimes he still says he lost if he gets a 4k, but only got it because the survivors omega fucked up at the last second or something.
---
It's really bizarre.
---
I bet butthurt survivor mains will start demanding Freddy nerfs due to this.
---
Done that aswell noticed after like 3 matches
---
Excuse me?
---
I want people to have a fun game, what is wrong with that?
---
They teabagged the entire game, and I had no problem with it until they decided to say “ez” when multiple were on death hook.
---
It took me about 2 months to be able to consistently do it on console, It's pretty useless though. Still fun to do!
---
what the fuck is this watermark
---
I might as well add a shady rumor but don't be surprised. If he keeps on trying to bypass every console or so to make his way back to the game he might as well get IP banned for the record or even get a lawsuit on him. Taking this kind of gig into a whole big deal is really petty from him and if he keeps up he can get into trouble.
---
Although fans would disagree and would protect him at any cost but most of those fans are kids. I mean, gee these small factors of him being a creep is also immensely uncool to hear. He should've just walked away and made his own simple content if he wants to keep it clean but no, he's pushing himself to the verge of pitfall. 
---
Do get the idea if he makes one simple flop or mistake he's out. He's fully out. His whole career will end if he keeps this up. Look, I would say something nice about him but he is the one who's responsible making Dead by Daylight community spoiled.
---
I cant even get the dark sense one done
---
That actually sucks. Sorry for you. But Michael wasn't made so that he doesn't have collision while stalking?
---
There is no better image to capture this feeling
---
What's your suggestion, though? Arbitrarily lock her behind a pay wall? It's not like you're forced to choose her, and the game does say she's hard.
---
Now I know this a troll, using Billy effectively (his curve) take time and practice otherwise he can easily be looped.
---
At this point I'm pretty sure NOED has a hidden secret clause of "chasing Thalia will cause all survivors to instantly finish the final gen right as you catch up."
---
Servers hit by surge? Ffff
---
Theres nothing wrong with playing the game in a manner to make it the most fun for both sides, but you cant get mad at them for saying ez when you're literally doing the equivalent.
---
And killer mains still cry about how "hard" the game is for them even though they win most games
---
"I could have killed you"
---
High horse. 
---
Still, some survivors are shits...
---
R/wooooosh
---
It’s a shitpost buddy
---
wtf is thalia
---
I think i stop playing when i dbd and i ragequit so i don't know if he can do this but the new freddy can counter pallet verywell. Dream snare will make them scream and not be able to put the pallet and he is slow. Or fake pallet. That your opinion but i think the old freddy was better because we was not op with 3 special ability and give some disavantage to survivor. But old freddy was not op he was just..... anyway he need to put a survivor in the dreamworld and attack him and any fail skillcheck wake him up
---
Yes I could have killed her.
---
It is a simple fact, nothing more.
---
I left her for her teammates to heal because I felt bad about chasing her immediately.
---
And I got a BS stalk as Ghostface.
---
I'd do an add-on that makes them much more flashlight-resistent, but her traps are extremely strong with crazy huge hitboxes, so they should have a counter that's not just wasting time crouching.  Immunity would be too much.
---
they seem to make sense to me. What is it that you believe people are missing?
---
people who think Hawkings is survivor sided just don't know how to play the map properly. There are a LOT of pallets in Hawkings. SO MANY...but nearly all of them are extremely unsafe, so you don't need to break them.
---
I can't tell you how many killer's I've come across who do nothing but instantly break every pallet dropped in Hawkings, then bitch that it's survivor sided...
---
the kill rate is relative to how much the killer is picked. Keep in mind pick rate of 1 match is the equivalent to the kill rate of x/4 survivors.
---
so say for example you played ONE match. Your pickrate is now 1, but you killed 3 of the survivors, your killrate is now 75%. That is how the %'s are divided.
---
Let's compare Freddy, Hag and Spirit as they are the 3 perfect sample sizes of this disparity. Lets round them all to 75% of killrate for simplicity and round Hag, Freddy, and Spirit to 3%, 8%, and 12% for cleaner numbers.
---
It's hard to factor the quantity of pickrates since it's divided so much between all the killers, but lets translate this into x100 for easier reading. So Hag has played 300 games, Freddy has played 800 games, and Spirit has played 1200 games, keep in mind each game has 4 survivors in it. So that means Hag has killed 900/1200 survivors, Freddy has killed 2400/3200 survivors and Spirit has killed 3600/4800 survivors. Notice how Spirit has killed more survivors than Freddy has even faced, and same for Freddy vs. Hag, sure this won't always apply to all killers if they are really close to each other, and who's to say that if all these killers played in the same amount of matches that they would keep this similar killrate, since this also doesn't indicate consistently getting a 3k in every single match they play either, it's just an average after all.
---
The amount of matches they played is just as important as how many survivors they killed in said matches. Playing one match and getting a 4k in that one match you played, and then claiming you have a 100% win rate isn't that impressive.
---
Perks: 
---
Magnum Dong. When survivors look at you they immediately have an orgasm and cannot move for thirty seconds. Magnum Dong has a cooldown of 180 seconds.
---
So Anyways I Started Blasting. Everytime survivors stun you, you are given a gun for 25 seconds. If you successfully shoot a survivor, they are put into the dying state. Has a cooldown of 120 seconds.
---
I'm the Trash Man. You can harness the power of trash. When you successfully his a survivor, they suffer tremendously from the mangled and hemorrhaged status effects until healed.
---
To anyone who wants to say that these are over powered, they come from Danny Devito, they MUST be overpowered.
---
Oh thanks, so that pictures pc but the others aren’t right? Cause the other pictures don’t specify it? Trying not to sound stupid here but I’m just confused why that one specifies but the others don’t.
---
Someone told me to kill myself after my first game.
---
I get that every game
---
Yeah defintely. It really depends on the ping as well. RIP for me most of the time 😂
---
Well I clearly wasn’t trying to, yet you’re portraying it as that.
---
It’s obvious I wasn’t trying to be “you’re trash, I coulda killed you easy, haha gg”.
---
BHVR: 'Thanks for your feedback. You need to unlock the Nurse-DLC with Iridescent Shards or are able to purchase it with money.
---
This is great!! I love it!
---
I have more than a thousand hours played on both roles, regularly play red ranks on both, I think I'm a better survivor player than I am a killer player, yet my kill rate is definitely higher than my survival rate. Unless you dodge a dozen lobbies until you find competent-seeming fellow survivors, solo survivor is pretty awful and has rather low chances of survival.
---
And yes, SWF is a different game entirely, even without factoring in voice comms. I mostly duo-SWF, which can still be rough, but whenever we get 3 or 4 people together that I know are at least competent players that make reasonable decisions and actually play to win (or even just play, which is more than can be said for many random survivors...), survivability goes up significantly. Then again, we know from last time's stats that SWF does not necessarily change a whole lot about global survival rate either. Most SWFs are casual too. But I agree that seeing stats for red rank SWF specifically would be good. Likewise, it would be good to see just how high individual killer players' kill rates can get. I would not be surprised to see some of them in the 90%s.
---
That said, I think killers being favoured statistically is a good thing, to a certain extent. More than stats, we can use game knowledge as a basis for potential changes. Gen times are still something that can be looked at, some of the weaker killers can do with buffs. Some of the stronger killers need some adjustments, and particularly add-ons (and Moris) need some rebalancing. As do some survivor items (e. g. toolboxes should be nerfed for gens, but buffed for sabos, flashlights could be buffed, ...).
---
When it says "Catch a survivor in a trap" does it mean you have to grab them when they are caught in the trap? Or does it count if they just step on it?
---
Sh*t those are awesome but for the Magum Dong it should have the effect of Freddy where you should have a prompt to stop orgasming
---
Have they been confirmed or are we crying wolf? 🤷‍♂️
---
No lie, I’ve payed as Meg wearing the black version of her original outfit from the store and it 100% hid me in that exact patch of grass. 
---
The killer (as the Trapper) walked right up to me, put down a trap in the grass, and walked away. A nearby Dwight watched the whole thing through a window and crouch-hopped in disbelief.
---
I wish I caught that on video.
---
And through their eyes it's a simple fact that it was an "ez" game. Both sides of this conversation are essentially the same
---
Yeah, it sucks because on console you'll get 120-180 ping a lot due to killers not using an ethernet cable or just having trashy internet.
---
The devs did.
---
I feel that. I hooked some dude and 2 of his teammates were basically throwing themselves at the hook to get the save before I even left the area so of course I stayed and dished out free hits. After the match the hooked dude was so salty, calling me an idiot and trash killer that needs to camp. It was pretty entertaining.
---
How is clown the weakest?!? He's amazing!
---
Lmao okay buddy.
---
NACHOOOOooooooooooooooooOoooooooOooooooooo!
---
Yep, true
---
Yes, and DeAndre can play big bird, and the map is paddy's pub and the surrounding shantys
---
You were very humble-braggy. I'd probably respond the same way if I were them.
---
I believe they're trying to balance all ranks at the same time... if they balance the hell out of wraith or trapper, that'll be stupid for new survivors. They've been trying to balance new players with new killers and beyond. Red Rank should be where the elite players are so it only makes sense that the best killers stay there. I main spirit because she can cover lots of ground in seconds and has good gen control. Do you want Wraith to Run around the map faster than spirit or same with the pig? It doesn't make sense.
---
Also Danny Devito should have a ability like the clown where he throw trash at survivor or Demo power where Danny Devito crawl out of a couch naked
---
I would totally stand around in the hospital map with Insidious, or just stay in Tier I forever. But only if I'm playing KYF to hear the screams.
---
OOOOoohohhhhh shiiiiiiiiiii
---
yes that's how they should play, but placing just 1 trap at a hook is enough to deter survivors from going for fast saves. Overall map pressure is her strongest ability, that includes monitoring all gens, catching all survivors off guard, making hook saves risky, and being quite literally in multiple places at once.
---
Your main focus shouldn't be protecting hooks true, but Hag can do that and everything else at once with proper trap usage.
---
Just don't message people. Don't know why you saw the need when it was unnecessary.
---
&gt; Basically only 5% of the matches are 4-man swfs
---
I remember this. the main response was that everyone knew this was a lie; we can see the number of people who populate into the lobby at the same time. and you really have to include 3 man as well, since they're about as strong anyway. 
---
the fact is, if SWF is allowed, then killers have to be balanced around it.
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
Ok, so when someone doesn't do their job, you better go and do it for them because that is somehow now your job.  
---
And, I don't use Cable, in fact I know almost no one who does, so this is irrelevant, despite this, Yes they should fix the problem, but don't expect it to be instant, don't expect people who AREN'T ON DUTY THAT DAY TO GO FIX IT YOU FUCKING ASSHAT  
---
You don't have any concept of how people work if you actually think people on their day's off are just going to come in and go "Yep, I'm going to go do this, extra thing that isn't part of my job because it's my day off"
---
While naked, he moves at 250% movement speed for 50 seconds
---
That's the most infuriating thing that can happen to me. That's one of the few times I guarantee you die.
---
Oh, also, while naked he's on all fours
---
Yeah, that confuses me. Fred's god tier and people keep picking the anime school girl... oh. Never mind. Figured it out mid-sentence.
---
Also, I suppose Spirit's more satisfying and visceral for the killer (and utterly frustrating for the survivor). I wonder if the patch will change anything or if people are going to keep using her. I don't think that she's going to stop being the go-to unless there's some sort of tell when she's spirit walking besides standing still, which isn't really a tell since it doesn't mean she's doing it. At least BHVR is taking steps with the collision and window vault animation.
---
That be terrifying imagine doing a genny and you see Danny Devito come out of nowhere that would be arousing and terrifying at the same time
---
Canceled is when the show just stops airing without any proper ending this show ended properly
---
Didn't they get those from when dbd servers messed up and they lost their accounts?
---
Irrelevant
---
Former killer main here, now 50/50 player. When I play survivor, I can "win" without surviving. Since to most people including myself, a win is a pip. When I'm playing killer, I can't win without a 4k. Maybe a 3k if the game is exceptional. Anything less is a "draw". And the devs are balancing around draws. 
---
That's my take on it anyways.
---
wait there's perks other than hex: ruin?
---
Rolling with some crazy perks these days
---
This brings me back to my childhood where everyone sagged their pants.
---
Even the Entity couldn't resist
---
Never got to high ranks but I saw someone recommend a nurse build for: Incedious, Aggitation, Noed and Blood Warden.
---
You teleport through an exit gate at the end and wait there with incedious for that 0 radius.
---
You then down someone quickly hook to summon bloodwarden to then pick off the rest.
---
i consider myself a "mid level" survivor, and i hover around rank 7. i feel like even when i do bad i neutral pip. it just seems very easy as a survivor to pip up
---
I think i was a little dump on this because i don't know this information  and he was not stalking me and i was already injured so i just stay in the corner because we don't know if he have infinite and tombstone. And 2 gens pop up and after he down me and he go without me, i use my umbreakable and i go. He finally got is stats 3 so 2 of them are dead and my friend rank 4 said go in a locker. So we try to make a my 2 gen remaining and we are trying to do a generator and when he was coming we hide in a locker and you know after.
---
Bruh. I said not to buff them rn cuz theres bigger problems and the game is clearly survivor sided. And who thinks noed and ruin should be buffed.This is what I mean why survivors are baby’s. They start crying about everything and they seem not to be able to read correctly.
---
Seeing Hag at least popular is real sad at red ranks. One of the best killers in the game and everyone likes to ignore her.
---
"Killer bad, survivor good. A streamer told me that once"
---
Yeah its a uh  
---
its a meme post title
---
What totem?
---
And d-strike is an anti-tunnel perk apparently lol.
---
Devs have said that a 2k is a draw. Not a win.
---
ahhh i complained about the game and the devs took my feedback and fixed it hahahahaha dumbasses! fucking idiots we know your every move
---
Kills seems like a poor metric. It's easy, sure. But one person surviving or dying skews it by 25%. Timing of the kills matters too. And I imagine this counts disconnects as kills since it counts as a sacrifice at the end. One survivor disconnects at the start of the match because they get downed early or don't like that killer and you're left with a 3 kill at least--and likely 4. A red ranks comparison might be skewed too. To get Rank 1 killer you have to be brutally efficient. Ranking up as a survivor is easier so you're likely to run into larger skill gaps. I would really like to see this chart without disconnects factored in. 
---
That being said, I can't come up with an easy to understand metric that would be better. There are a lot more variables than just 1K 2K 3K 4K at work here though.
---
Just stepping in it is enough.
---
either way nurse deserved to be nerfed, legion and pig definitely didn't
---
They better fix their damn servers before they start pulling this ; I get d/c'd at \*least\* once a day for who-knows-why.
---
That looks really cool, especially the Spirit. Maybe be careful about scribbling out pictures of psychopathic serial killers in class though, might give classmates and teachers the wrong idea. Might be better doodling something else and saving these for home. You got a favorite killer?
---
The legion nerfs are in the ptb.
---
Havent heard anything about pig nerfs though.
---
It’s a joke
---
The all ranks table is even more meaningless. 
---
The survivors that are at yellow and above are generally free kills because they struggle to get gens done, they don’t loop well, and generally just waste time. Yes the killer players are also bad at those ranks but it doesn’t matter because of the way survivors play at those ranks.
---
Does this include dc’s? What about when survivors kill themselves on the first hook? I mean idk how anyone can take this seriously when bhvr themselves are basically saying it’s flawed data
---
Absolutely love this
---
more like +500k, 100k its almost anything
---
Autodidact, or in some cases, deliverance or balanced landing
---
The first post on the front page of this subreddit.......
---
I like Tru3’s youtube vids and I’ll occasionally drop by his streams (he usually streams while I’m in class so I don’t really get a chance to watch them) but from what I’ve seen he’s a chill person
---
I wasnt paying too much attention to it, just played and after this weekend i checked to see how far i was then noticed i had to select the certain one lol
---
Look up any YouTuber's/Streamer's killer tier list. These are people far more skilled than you, with much more play time and they all put her in the top 2. Even after her nerf.
---
remove the middle one and im fine
---
I guess
---
Thanks
---
Thank you
---
I didn't say you said tunnel everyone that crouches. I'm saying don't say you don't have a right to complain about tunneling if you tbag. It's like saying you have a right to tunnel because someone tbags. Players who say that are also what causes tbagging and tunneling to be seen as toxic. 
---
Toxicity is when you use a communication or behavior to hurt a player's feelings, for example:
---
- GG EZ  you suck uninstall the game baby killer
---
- Go kill yourself
---
- Nobody loves you, it would be better if you just die
---
Does tbagging hurt someone's feelings? Sure, if you're a snowflake.
---
If it doesn't hurt most player's feelings, it's BMing. If it makes you mad or upset, it's BMing.
---
Amazing. Maybe jaws could be a land killer that's a person-shark hybrid to fix the water issues
---
Where did they say flawed data.  I dont know what it includes its just saying a lot about the current stare of killers vs Survivors.  Its clear data that killers are overperforming at high rates
---
&gt; 4-man SWF is between 3 and 6% of all games,
---
this is flase at high ranks. regardless of what the devs claim, we can see them all pop in at the same time. and we can see that those are clearly organized and on comms.
---
the fact is, if SWF is allowed, the killers have to be balanced around it. and most arent.
---
Looping shouldn’t be that hard. The killers or should I say Jasons are way weaker in Friday 13th. But that’s ur opinion.
---
Wait, I thought it was a search and rescue
---
Demo and freddy imo
---
On console it’s every other match in green ranks,,,
---
Ruin and ds
---
BL till BHVR nerf him, Borrowed
---
ON killer is BBQ for BP, and STBFL
---
Can we get a link to your steam profile and screenshot of rank 2 you are claiming to have as solo-surv?
---
Any killer except for maybe pig can fill up the deviousness category pretty easily if you use their powers correctly but i think that Legion gets the most BP because every frenzy hit counts as a normal hit too giving you double-ish hit bp
---
You should remake this but with killers who camp and tunnel. Yes they're both """strategies""" but is the air or motion from their squats completely ruining your entire match? And don't forget Mori's... if you use those for anything beyond challenges and dailies and I escape, better stay away from the gates cause you fucking suck at the game if I'm still alive. And noed users beware.
---
Wasn't that back when pipping was mostly kill based? You can get a 4 man and de-pip these days.
---
Pig is the 5th best killer at red ranks. She seems to be okay
---
It's really weird seeing these statistics, and yet there's a lot of discussion about generator speeds and 'underpowered' killers (e.g., trapper). While I do believe a lot of game sense is acquired by the time a player stabilizes themselves in red ranks, it's interesting to see such high win rates among all red rank killers.
---
I feel like there's a general consensus regarding Hex: Ruin and how frustrating it is as a perk, so I wonder how the team is going to address/fix the perk without spiking killers into an even higher win rate bracket. Same could be said for generator repair times.
---
Here's a shocker for you: it's a totem. And there's only five of them.
---
But for real it is poorly designed. Much like the Adrenaline giving you too many stats, even against Freddy it's too effective. My only question is what was it really intended for to counter because my thoughts were at first it is meant to be against Hope or Adrenaline.
---
I would simply remove on of the two effects on the No One Escapes Death: either speed or instant-downs. And I really don't mind a totem giving you exposed effect on Survivors as long as it doesn't add up additional bonuses, one of the two things really.
---
Hold up what's actually happening here?  Did he try to open Bill's locker as he jumped out, and got vacuumed into opening the other locker instead?
---
overdose on your meds and accidentally hit enter early or any other reason you refuse to explain WHY my comment is "irrelevant"? I went out of my  way to tell you why your point is null I'd appreciate you attempt to do the same (:
---
I don't think they are trying to achieve comedy, this isn't (for the most part) a meme subreddit.
---
For killers, Corrupt intervention and Whispers
---
For survivor, DS and Bond
---
All day
---
Ive low-key always wanted Jaws but thought everyone would think its dumb af lmao
---
Your math is still flawed. Percents are percents. More matches just mean more accuracy.  We are not dealing with small numbers anyway.  Pick rate has nothing to do with kill rate.  75% is 75% if she was over tuned she would have better stats.  Total kills means absolutely nothing.
---
Take those stats with a grain of salt
---
This is especially hilarious on maps like the game.
---
Search and Rescue! Of course I mean search and rescue.
---
It's not all killer mains. Let's not generalize a whole group here. Most killers don't complain about the game nowadays because now it's a lot better than what it was a couple of years ago. It's easy to be fooled by the hivemind on here and in other forums where many bad players whine but it doesn't truly reflect what the majority think about the current state of this game (in terms of balance).
---
That's one of the harder ones for a lot of people. The level 4 is going to be straight up impossible without SWF, which sucks because I just want to earn lore.
---
If it helps, I managed to do the dark sense one quickly. Go toolbox but focus on extra charges instead of speed. Sprint burst + spine chill so when you see SC light up you tap SB but walk instead of sprint to hide farther away without leaving scratch marks. Ignore your teammates' desperate pleas for help and be the dedicated mechanic. You can manage this against even good killers, but hopefully you'll get lucky and play against a rank 20 leatherface or something.
---
The thing I hate about these is that they make you play like a dumbass sometimes. Like the "drop 15 pallets in a chase" one - when the level opened people were deliberately going around and wasting all the pallets to the team's detriment to finish quickly. Especially the "complete in 1 trial" ones, it makes you play in a very awkward or selfish way sometimes.
---
Like i said i wasn’t paying attention in the lobby, and i find it quite tricky to see if someone has a key during the countdown, and btw i don’t really like FD, but thx for the advices
---
I can’t play survivor without Balanced Landing. As you can probably tell, I’m pissed about the nerf
---
Such a crybaby survivor...
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind if DS was replaced with something like this.  
---
I play equal parts killer and survivor, and I just think that DS is stupid but a necessity. It punishes the killer for attempting to punish a survivor misplaying with an unsafe unhook and incentivizes slugging which isn't fun.  
---
Making DS more like borrowed time would just reduce the punishment the killer gets for not slugging and capitalising on shit unhooks.
---
Fire up and Leader.
---
Slow-mo Trapper's like "nnnnnnnnNNNOOOOOoOoOoOOOoO...!"
---
I haven't T-bagged before, but the only time I ever will is if the killer is a complete facecamping scumbag
---
Some people do, some people don't. Perhaps they should just remove ranks
---
Tenacity is the best perk.
---
Doctor in my opinion, you get a similar amount of all categories in all killers except for deviousness, and the doctor really makes it easy with the shocks:)
---
How are 4 man swf groups toxic
---
The clown map
---
Leatherface op omg you’re so funny dude, i play since the console release, LF is not my main and i don’t play him well rn, you obviously think that Wraith is op also
---
One thing with playing Killer is that there's no guarantee all survivors are at the same rank as you are. Every so often you get a green rank or multiple purples in your games, which if you're a red rank killer usually means your kill count gets boosted
---
Balanced landing. It makes gameplay incredibly easier in chases
---
You think Oni has counterplay? His best "counterplay" is to jump in a locker so he can't slug you.
---
Atleast you could run Franklin's against multiple items or play Plague.
---
Compared to pick-rate, though. That means that there are a relatively small amount of people playing Pig very well. Not that Pig is a good killer.
---
Last night I rescued and she was T-bagging and of course I was pissed, and I got downed after the rescue but realized the killer was a facecamper and I completely understood 😔
---
Or maybe just run franklins....?
---
Trapper is surprisingly good for it, as long as you actually catch people in traps, it gives like 500 and is easy to max out deviousness.
---
The game+doctor×distressing=4dc
---
Trapper you can just pick up and place traps though if you dont have either, huntress also get like 300-800 per hatchet hit.
---
Oh no I go only get so erect that so terrifying
---
I don't know what map you play if you think the game has a lot of unsafe pallets.
---
Takes some to know some
---
Nice art, The demogorgon looks good imo
---
W E T
---
Don’t like it, i think it’s a waste of a perk, and btw LF is not my main, i main Freddy and Demo, i have far better perks to use on them
---
You are easily the most reasonable person on this subreddit. By a wide margin.
---
No, not really. The lore is very complicated so he probably wouldn’t have known unless he dug through it.
---
Yeah I always forget about it and mess my pants.
---
Do you play killer or survivor because it take more time killer than survivor.
---
Pick rate is affected by perceived balance by quite a bit. She's low picked cause people see her as weak
---
Unbreakable. Anytime I've not used it, I could have. I've just decided to have it forever now.
---
Isn’t he a fog whisperer? I hate him too btw. You said it perfect
---
Because no one wants to play you being Legion, idk how many times we have to tell you /s
---
You must be new to multiplayer games if you think toxicity is unique to this game. Just ignore them, there's plenty of nontoxic people. 
---
Also, if you're consistently getting called a camper, you're probably hook camping. It's not rocket science.
---
Imagine the dbd gone wild
---
Community the entity could allow Danny Devito he to hot
---
I don't really care what my teachers and fellow classmates care of me and we have multiple dbd fans in class plus my favourite is the legion
---
...is there maybe a reason she’s seen as weak?
---
Yeah, the comments on threads that say “well the killer is supposed to be the most powerful, they are supposed to kill you” are so fucking stupid. Like, it’s a game mate, about people with purple hair being able to shrug off a bear trap to the ankle, a hook through their lungs and a hatchet to the back, it’s not that deep
---
Hello Otz’s alt account.
---
Why must you remind me of that god forsaken community
---
Every mori can go through walls if you start the animation next to one. I hope you aren't serious.
---
Matches with a dc are excluded which means the killrate is probably a lot higher.
---
I don't know how the devs think they should still buff killers.
---
It is a sphere around the Killer. Think that's bad? It used to be a flat cylinder around the Killer, meaning it had infinite vertical range. It's fine as a sphere, means Survivors can't just hold M1 on a gen without being around of their surroundings.
---
Hahah imagine the fan art THE FAN ART
---
Pls say that this is sarcasm.
---
Spine chill
---
NOOOOOOOOOO
---
So you think you are better at matchmaking than BHVR ?  No you're not.  One of the many reasons you are not is because you can't see the Killer level,  Maybe he is of a lower level, which would explain  your lower level teammates, you are then meant to lead this teams of wannabes to victory.    Hiding player levels is a good step forward.
---
"Mains" btw
---
That first swing was so close I felt it on my back.
---
If you play a way that somebody else doesn’t like, you’re going to be called toxic. Just ignore those people.
---
That is so gross
---
No, we should demand a nerf to every killer =)
---
Bayonetta - The Witch
---
Power: Witch Time
---
Pressing the Power button will **Slow Down Time**, making **Action** and **Movement** Speed 50% Slower for survivors within a 32 meter radius for 4 seconds. Witch time can be activated once every 60 seconds. Hooking a survivor fully replenishes Witch Time.
---
Secondary Power: Dodge
---
Pressing the secondary ability button as you're about to get stunned by a pallet or blinded by a flashlight will trigger Witch Time even if it is not fully replenishes. You still have to break the pallet if you Dodge a pallet. You can't dodge while carrying a survivor.
---
yah now thinking no PLEASE NO
---
You aren't exactly contributing to the conversation in any positive way either pal.
---
1. Until these stats are able to exclude DCs I will never take them seriously. I play enough on both sides to see how many survivors DC.
---
2. My biggest problem with the game is the gen speed. I have a well-played back and forth game that get's a 2k then I'm happy. If I get gen rushed to shit and I have to start playing dirty just to get a 2k then I'm not happy. IDC if you give survs more chase options or you nerf top tier killers if they would just slow the game down.
---
3. If I wanted to play like a cunt every match I could easily get a 2k. Focus one guy down and then camp the last guy during EGC. That is not hard and certainly not a win. The devs need to change their philosophy from two kills to an average of something along the lines of 6 individual hooks (I'm not saying this is perfect, this is just off the top of my head) while also discouraging tunneling and slugging.
---
I think a lot of people are forgetting this. A killer with a 72% kill rate doesn't mean they're doing well ranking wise. You can easily snowball in to a 4k and black pip or get 0 kills and pip. These charts also don't mention if they take moris in to account, which would change things massively.
---
Yeah the drop 15 pallets one was tupid af I'm gonno go do the dark sense one now tho
---
Legion or Doctor, they get easy BP
---
Lol Hawkings is fucking great if you play trapper, hag or myers with scratch mirror.
---
One trap can seal a whole damn corridor, and you are so close that there is almost no place where as hag you cannot teleport to unless its literally at the other side of the map
---
How much would his DLC cost though?
---
Up the ante + slippery meat. 
---
For killer: ruin.
---
I understand your point but Franklins is actually quite nice at slowing down the game even thought it doesn't look like a slowing perk. I always bring it as hag (without ruin) and i can 4k consistently
---
Mm the cheapest because I think everyone should have Danny Devito in their roster
---
Idk honestly. I just assumed they were hacking because it looks a little odd to have like a billion bloodpoints
---
50 cents
---
As I told the other guy
---
I was asking why he put a bug in the list of nerfs. I was not asking what the vacuum was
---
Shirtless Larry skin please
---
And a egg to please the enity and Danny Devito
---
Just finished a match as the pig and sucked hard hahaha so yeah. Thank you for your advice!
---
deerstalker
---
Queue times are leaning towards infinite because of this kind of selfish thinking.
---
Thank you for the advice
---
Bruh 
---
I barely play survivor, but making good plays is not toxic. Toxic survivors exist, but they *want* to make you mad, so you’ll place worse, or throw the game, don’t let them.
---
Thank you ; )
---
Thank you : )
---
Thank you for the help
---
wait a moment if forgot to tell you that Legion isn't quite the best killer if you want to earn BP and win. I'd recommend hag (My main haha) but she takes a little bit of practice, but after getting the hang of her power she becomes super fun and powerful and she can earn a lot of bloodpoints
---
Queue times are nowhere near infinite for either side with the ranks active.
---
Can I offer you a nice egg in this trying time?
---
I like how you just stood there to face down your inevitable fate.
---
I played a match as the hag a while ago and actually got close to killing everyone hahaha she was fun and very powerful but I still sucked a lot hahaha
---
That’s always what happens: the one time you don’t run a specific perk is the one time you could have actually used it.
---
Fun bonding ideas with the squad
---
If you press space to grab people out of traps, you also get more blood points than hitting them out of it.
---
4 survivors joining at the same time != 4 man swf.
---
Let me tell you how current matchmaking works: You queue up as survivor -&gt; You dont get in a lobby until you get paired with 3 other survivors -&gt; When you are paired, all four survivors get in at the same time.
---
This was properly explained on a dev post. Does this happen always? Of course not, matchmaking will also put you on a lobby where one or multiple survivors have dodged.
---
Also imagine thinking the devs would lie about this, like they have a survivor biased agenda. Jesus fucking christ man
---
&gt;the fact is, if SWF is allowed, then killers have to be balanced around it.
---
Then youd have no chance to escape as a solo player, fuck that and fuck your shitty balance
---
OwO. I'll feast on your soul.
---
Freddy is a killer comprised of other killers abilities but does them better.
---
He can teleport like the hag but there is a lot more mind game and strategy potential.
---
He has a lullaby like the huntress but it replaces his terror radius and you can't tell where it's coming from effectively hiding him even when he's near.
---
He phases in and out like the spirit and fair enough it's not better but he still has it.
---
He has a trap that is a combination of trapper and clown except he can do it instantly (unlike trapper) and can be spammed (unlike clown)
---
He has an oblivious like the wraith but unlike him he can have it in chase.
---
He also can be invisible (farther than 32m) like the wraith but there's no downside.
---
He's also pretty damn fast considering what he can do.
---
I personally find Freddy to be the second most annoying killer to face. It's not a whole lot of fun. He does so many things and he does them better than the other killers. The only reason spirit, nurse, and Billy are above him is the sheer mobility they have.
---
Every single killer has a killrate above 60% in red ranks, so how are Survivors OP? It was right to nerf the 2 best killers. 
---
Billy is fine tho he just needs his insta saw addons to be reworked.
---
It should've been like 10 - 15mil iirc. If they really did have a billion then yeah fair enough.
---
Why are you downvoted ?
---
Ahhh I always wondered how you did that I thought it was just like an interrupt thank you!
---
BBQ and Chili from Leatherface, it gives you extra BP for hooking survivors. Killers usually get more BP per match already, and BBQ is way better than the survivor equivalent of the perk since you'll be hooking people no matter what. It also lets you know who is far away from you so you can pressure them next, which is great to help you win matches.
---
It's too bad you missed it in the Shrine of Secrets recently. Leatherface is considered the lowest tier killer in the game - feel free to play him, but I have a feeling you'll be switching to one of the others real fast. If you don't want to play as him, I recommend earning BP by playing a different character, then spending it on Leatherface's bloodweb. I frequently do this to get perks ready on other characters before I start playing them.
---
And the shard to pay for survivor and killer cosmetic should be a egg
---
Decisive strike is a good perk for prevent tunneling
---
You're welcome
---
Oh shit im under cover, shhh
---
Or a crab
---
Imagine thinking that the mere existance of people is political
---
Oh i do have it hahaha I’ve just never played too much killer and heard you get a lot more and based on what you’ve said I see why hahaha thank you. BBQ sounds a lot easier than we are gonna live forever. Plus it has an extra bonus
---
I mean I would honestly take anything at this point
---
Interesting.
---
Yess and Now Danny cosmetics the first one the trash man, the troll “you gotta pay the toll” and anything else
---
Personally I think those "wow I got 3-4 kills and didn't pip!" are literally those people that face camp, bring Mori's or literally only get their kills off of people due to NOED or some cheeky blood warden play.
---
I would be interested in seeing some kind of graph for pipping, but I can imagine that being skewed as fuck. Legion will be over ranked, Plague will be under ranked, and basically any killer with an insta-down won't have accurate readings either.
---
I will gladly throw the game to stare them dead in the chest as they hang on the hook. It’s not an all the time thing, thankfully. But simply mentioning the concept of justified camping gets people all riled up. To clarify, I was totally being sarcastic about the toxic save and toxic body block. Well, hyperbolic, not sarcastic. My point wasn’t sarcasm though. Sometimes survivors gonna toxify. I, more than anything, want to have fun with this game, whatever form that takes.
---
*Wolves by Kanye West starts playing*
---
The problem on those maps isn't that it's hard to hide, it's that each room that you run into while getting chased is a complete mystery. 
---
It's total rng which rooms will spawn pallets and it's luck if you manage to find them.
---
Spine Chill or Bond. Probably Spine Chill. It gives me a head start on chases or even an opportunity to avoid them altogether, and even some utility mid-chase. I'm so used to it I don't even look around during gen work and just focus on hitting greats unless there's a very long sight line. Whenever I switch things up for fun or a challenge I do noticeably worse against stealth killers.
---
Hatchets, Saws with speed limiter, and Corrupt all give speed boosts and are not normal hits. The only time when a survivor becomes injured and doesn't gain a speed boost is when they become broken by Vile Purge.
---
So It’s illegal to use things what haven’t been touched cUz ThEy ArE sO oP. Say that again when u see a gen pop in 10 sec cuz theres a full swf with green box’s with some speed increase add ons on them and proof thyself.
---
Like many people here, Spine Chill. I found myself getting snuck up on too much by Ghost Faces and Wraiths and such. Now that never happens.
---
Which is why I strafe away from the gates if I suspect the Killer has Blood Warden negating the aura reading.
---
Why do I need to repeat my point again? I made my point. You managed to miss it. 
---
“Ya okay bud” kind of implies that you think you know better about this situation that I’m in than I do. I know what I’m doing.
---
Freddy is the strongest in red and all ranks, and trapper is popular AF in all ranks. Wow.
---
Can't wait for oni to take all the top spots, and throw this off by a mile.
---
Also, is it not strange that killers complain about indoor maps, but they are the most deadly?
---
I totally agree with that. Or something like after a certain amount of chase time, the men’s timer starts to go down and then it turns into an M1 if they don’t mend 
---
This would prevent loops and give legion some power back
---
Susie is S tier I agree, and same here I'm just throwing the suggestion out there
---
So is it your personal crutch or did you just say something about a random perk?
---
And then they dc and add another screenshot to my dc hall of shame.
---
Are kill rates for 4k or at least 1k?
---

It may just be me, but I think she's gotten lost in the mix. I *love* playing her, but I never feel the inclination to do so. Kinda like Clown, for that.
---
Keys because there’s not much you can do about them, with flashlights you can bait them out or just face a wall, maps are pretty much useless unless they’re finding ruin (but it gets cleansed early anyway) and toolboxes are just eh. But with keys the only way is with franklins or tunnel them (which I don’t tunnel)
---
Yesss sure
---
I'm not saying they should or did nerf killer, you're saying that with your meme. Your meme should be the other way around. The side that has seen by far the most nerfs since this game released is survivor.
---
It's happened to quite a few people, it's part of why they're being given free to everyone December 3rd.
---
You're not alone OP, and there is an upcoming solution. Hope that helps somewhat.
---
The main idea with hillbilly is to use his chainsaw to traverse the map and to catch up to survivors. After that you basically chase the survivor normally until you have an opening to chainsaw them directly behind them. If they are playing windows/pallets too well then settle for an m1.
---
That will get you most of the way. Higher ranks will require you to actually maneuver while chainsawing but you'll be well on your way by then.
---
An easy way to play huntress is similar. Get close to them then hit them with a hatchet where it's difficult to dodge while close. The cool down on attacking is significantly less than actually hitting so you will have another opportunity for a hatchet or finish with an m1 very quickly. You won't need a lot of medium range hatchets until the higher ranks.
---
It would be more likely to turn them into Innsmouth fish people
---
SuRviVORs ArE ToO StrOnG
---
Console average is 150. But that’s because we have some many damn WiFi warriors.
---
Be on the gen when it's completed. 
---
My suggestion is to use Bond (maybe Prove Thy Self too) and keep doing laps around the map looking for others already on a gen. Don't bother with soloing gens, you're just better off piggy backing off nearly complete gens (unless it's already nearly finished).
---
&gt;  but still easily the strongest killer, especially with addons
---
Red rank stats literally prove the exact opposite but ok.
---
Oh. Well that is interesting.
---
For me it's more stealth killers on indoor maps are a fucking nightmare.
---
Imagine a humanoid cat man in an oversized striped top hat rushing at you with baseball bat and laughing like Mike Myers
---
I watched a streamer get 9 spirits in a row at the red ranks. Yeah they're picked a lot.
---
Right I see, when you said top post I thought you meant of this thread lol. Also it's not the top post
---
They say even race car bubba couldn't match the raw speed of Usain claudette
---
BVHR make it happen
---
Submit a support ticket to be safe. 
---
I didn't have this problem and haven't seen it mentioned much. Better safe than sorry.
---
Total kills mean nothing. Kill:match ratio is the only indicator.  There is no way we are looking at pick rates low enough to create a statistical deviation.  Thats why I said pick rates don’t matter. Spirit is popular but does not mean she is stronger.
---
Thank you for the info and the link, much appreciated!
---
Ah this makes a lot of sense, thank you
---
I’m waiting for it PLEASE BHVR GODS
---
Well on video on youtube where they p3 oni they have 600 million
---
Iron will! i cant even listen to the survivors anymore without it
---
LOL. Sure
---
Yeah in red ranks that's what happens 99% of the time. The other 1% when you get blood warden active they usually just run away from the gate and chill for the remainder of the time, or use the time to plan a rescue for the new hooked person. I don't think I've ever seen someone get chased into the exit gate while Blood Warden is up, red ranks are generally too aware of that being a possibility for it to happen.
---
I love these perks. I hope the devs see this. Cut the Engine is how you make a perk to slow progression. However. This will also make Forever Freddy literally fuckin eternal
---
Now, we wait
---
More useless than unsafe tbh, like those pallets next to a staircase or a drop. The amount of good pallets on The Game is low. The basement loop is weak, windows are scarce.
---
Yeah it's not super likely you go against survivors who know how to fight hag, but she went from being like my favorite "holy shit no one knows how overpowered she is, such a good killer" to being... disapointing when you realize she only felt powerful cause survivors haven't been *properly* countering you.
---
You kind of want the ability to play well enough to *compete* with a good set of survivors on a "fair" map. Killers like Billy or Huntress facilitate this, while some killers like Myers or Plague depend on at least 1 survivor making a big mistake.
---
It's not satisfying to win just because survivors didn't play "properly"- it's MUCH harder for survivors to effectively counter Hag in particular compared to Plague (Where with the latter you simply have to not cleanse, where with Hag it needs you to be more proactive as a whole team)
---
&gt;For me that is rarely and she can still push real hard if she wants to
---
Pushing more or less with her ends up becoming camping 3 gens and setting up defenses/ traps faster than survivors can heal, come back, and pump the gens. It's kind of annoying to be honest, and kind of boring.
---
until theres an unranked mode, people are going to care
---
Matchmaking is based on the highest player in a group now. It was a fairly recent patch.
---
It'll be in one since she's an original killer
---
Which is surprising, since she has 1 of the MUST-HAVE killer perks that anyone who plays killer regularly would want with Ruin.
---
Yes NOW WE WAIT I’m pretty sure they tweeted this idea before, they tweeted tony hawk before so we see
---
&gt; is relatively easy to control
---
it's not relative enough.
---
Second Wind. I know it’s not amazing, but if i can get it to proc twice, i find it more useful than Adrenaline.
---
When the killer is the Cat on a swamp map you here him yell in the distance “What are you doing in my swamp!”
---
Splendid
---
True but it is required to pip at the highest ranks.
---
Hawkins is the only indoor map I like as Trapper. You can lay his traps beneath the rubble doorways which will almost always work. Likewise both exit gates have rubble in front of the switch which covers like 70% of the trap. I'd almost call it broken if those rubble spots weren't essentially the only good places to set traps. The biggest issue with indoor maps is that the floors are usually concrete and not even the tar bottle helps in most areas.
---
Thank you for taking the time to explain all that! Very much appreciate it!
---
Not gonna lie. I’ve used that little patch of grass to hide. Ran around the corner after using lither (paired with lightweight) and i just sat there. Legion just kept running and even started checking the lockers in the room to the left of that patch.
---
You can dream but i don't think its will be in the next chapter because there is a story about a doctor with drug. Claudette no friend, and evan, trapper. There is one on the entity and i don't remember the last. But this is not a bad idea. I mever think this but this could be fun see her story more in detail. But will never happen )-;
---
I play ps4 I have to play killer at night due to long survivor queue times, but during daytime its 5-10 min to queue as killer but instant for survivor.
---
How is 4 completely safe pallets weak? Pallets buy time and on the game you can't actually do anything tricky to make loops shorter. You just run them like a bad ai and hope the survivor is bad at looping and uses all the pallets before they finish all the gens.
---
&gt;and they do indeed have a survivor agenda
---
Why do I even bother
---
Because they are. They are toxic to the overall health to the game.
---
In EU the queue time is still way faster for surv than for killer in high ranks.
---
Snares make him difficult to loop, add bamboozle ontop of that and your not gonna have a good time
---
They should make it that you can counter moris with d-strike. I\`m tired getting unhooked right in front of the killer to get downed and moried 3 minutes into the game
---
I know, I mean like in the next season of archives or whatever.
---
I play killer a lot, and let me tell you, I actually see Hope used a pretty decent amount. Wasting as much of the killers time as possible in end game is important as  it is all or nothing at that point for most high rank killers, it also makes it harder to get held hostage in the game. On top of that, it is a counter to noed.
---
1st 2nd its one of the stickied posts.
---
Thanks, was definitely looking for the more popular names in the community i could look to for their streams/videos. I do like that bit of information, as with every game I figured there was a meta. I will most definitely be looking at what others are using, thanks for the great advice!
---
Nothing like running into a room on The Game that only has one entrance and no pallets.
---
No problem! Had fun writing it.
---
i mean as hag i have no problem against swf groups but whatever

Wow thank you for writing it all out, didn’t even know you could destroy the hooks! Boy i’ve got quite a road ahead of me but i’m excited to play nonetheless!
---
Yeah man I hate it when a survivor squats ferociously so I completely ruin their gameplay because I got butthurt over something so insignificant. Oh but me chasing them around for 3 gens isn't my fault.
---
oh lmao wow
---
To get a challenge done in Tome 3.
---
Yeahh
---
Or just a slight change (I.e. Meg being a bit faster, Claudette healing a bit faster and depleting medkits a bit sliwer, etc)
---
most hag players camp hook while putting 100K traps around it. 
---
That won't do against survivors with 2 neurons connected.
---
A survivor hit with Borrow Time still gets a speed boost when they gain the deep wounds effect, which still makes legion consistent with the rest of the game. Deep wounds is less of a status effect as it is a health state.
---
The only reason Vile Purge is different is because becoming Broken isn't treated as being hit since the only other times survivors become broken are by their own perks.
---
especially in the outfit OP has
---
Glad to know Stranger Things dlc is worth the purchase, i love that show and absolutely love Steve Harrington lol one of my fav tv characters ever! 
---
Edit; also thank you for answering my questions so promptly and explained so easily, much appreciated!
---
They just want to 4k every match, thats their endgame
---
*Oni wants to know your location*
---
Who's the killer and who's the survivor? I haven't played DBD in a while...
---
Spies from the shadows and Urban evasion.
---
change the add u want to be added on to see if theres a change&gt;?
---
You seem like a fun person.
---
I refused to play killer before tome challenges because I don't have the option to toggle if I go against 3/4 SWF groups.
---
It's not fun and quite frankly if I had to choose between going against SWF and only playing killer for the Tome challenges and never any other time, I'll take the killer during Tome.
---
But you  need to survive on 5 generator. That the only thing.
---
As a survivor for now it’s empathy. Not only does it allow me to get an idea of where the killer is at thanks to an injured teammate, if that injured person stopped getting chased and is alone I go to them and heal them up 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
As for the Killer, Thrill Of The Hunt Has been very useful for my legion build. The moment someone finds a hex totem I’ll be there asap.
---
Elaborate I dont understand
---
What are your average pings? Lol
---
Balanced Landing... it's why I am dreading the nerf.
---
And the killers who use all those perks can be found trying to defend themselves below because they need validation after using said perks. They’re not impossible to play against but when a killer has all of them the game isn’t much fun. It’s whatever though they’ll run what they run
---
Its really good
---
So you are running 3 of the top meta perks and a flex spot for healing and you need feedback?
---
how was that a slug race he gave you hatch 😂
---
It was the Thompson house I believe
---
Nah I pay for this shit now I expect better from them
---
Hope is good only in circumstances that you are somehow in a chase in exit gates powered scenarios. In most cases even with hope, you will still go down but it could help you make that pallet or give you the extra few steps to the exit gate. In any scenario you would realistically want hope your better off running adren outside of getting into the chase after its popped.
---
Adren gives you more of a speed boost, 50% vs 7% for 5 seconds which is more then enough to break chase or make the distance you need vs 7%. Combined its pretty good but takes alot of slots for an endgame build.
---
Reading comprehension?
---
Not once have I received a negative message from a survivor.
---
Sprint Burst right now. I'm still learning how ti run decent loops, so the extra 3 second head start helps me plan a little bit.
---
Adreniline is meta so clearly that isn't a big deal.
---
At the end of the day, survivors don't really need perks to win anyways.
---
Plus it helps if the killer closes the hatch.
---
It's more that they should be able to 4K consistently against the most tryhard swf. And in they super big brains it doesn't sound like it's going to be an issue regarding solo survivor teams, like at all.
---
Yeah, Nancy's perks are all pretty good in the right build, better together requires a bit of building around but fixated and inner strength are both good. Steve's perks are less good with second wind being ok if you use it right but you do get to play as Steve which is a bonus. And demogorgon might not be top tier and it's perks are meh but demo is high mid tier and at low ranks should be fine
---
No ruin and bbq is a good perk. Don't tell me nobody use these perk so its not random
---
Cause we all hit perfect skill checks every time. Never said anything about disconnecting either. Someone’s awfully defensive though
---
No, because old Freddy needed a lot more help than the mere addition of snares. He had a ton of issues that needed fixing, but the devs decided to just scrap him and start over.
---
The only buff I see is legion's vault speeds which have only been restored to what they were beforehand. I suppose the pins as well now have more viability but knowing behavior they'll reduce the time the pins' effects last
---
It's spelled insidious, but that is an interesting combination.... 🤔
---
Definitely, combine with borrowed and get those BP!
---
Calm Spirit counters any perk / Killer that makes you scream. This obvious includes Doctor but also Clown's bottles (if the Clown can't hear you coughing), Iron Maiden, and notably Infectious Fright.
---
The big picture is if 100 survs leave then we still find matches
---
But if 100 killers leave good fucking luck
---
Edit: basically get off your high horse you arent as important as you think
---
mmm yes, this is the kind of content I like to see
---
&gt;The killer entitlement is that they should get 4 kills every match.
---
Yep, and this subreddit is brutal about it. Thank god these stats came out to shut them the fuck up. The things killer mains on this sub say and what I witness are not even remotely close to reality. I fluctuate between red and low purple, and I get killed probably 75% of my matches, and the ones where I live, 50% of those are killer mercy.
---
I can't even begin to explain why the game is so imbalanced...I mean I can, I can explain from a survivor perspective why it's so fuckin difficult unless your 4 squad SWF, but that would take forever.
---
I'm still relatively new to the game, but based on these stats, and the things I read online, my guess is that killer mains bitch and moan that they're not getting a 4k every game and "ItS a HorRoR GaMe", and got buffed because of it.
---
Hell instaheal got obliterated, but what the fuck about ebony mori? How is insta heal op which saves 1 health state, compared to something that eliminates 8 health states?
---
That ghostface is the embodiment of my team looking for ruin
---
I think 75% is a better sweet spot. It makes the game more tense and better fits the slasher movie theme.
---
lol, imagine being so deluded that you think the Devs have some nefarious secret agenda to lie about SWF rates. Survivor queues are 5+ minutes long, of course once a killer comes along the lobby is going to fill up instantly.
---
Wait for new killer imo. If not I’d say plague out of those choices
---
Bbq is an ok perk, definitely top tier for bp farming.
---
Haha 1 downvote doesn’t mean ur argument is correct. Another example why I find u as a moron. And did u read my reply? U  answered nothing aahhahaa I won the argument cuz u couldn’t answer my questions hahahaa. That’s moron logic for u.
---
I like the idea, but I don't think it should last forever, a great deal of more time yes, maybe like 30 seconds base rather than 10
---
I’d love more Generator testing/stats in general. I know I’m about to get bombarded with Survivor Mains, but Gens can be done WAY too easily.
---
If you aren’t bringing Ruin/Corrupt, you’re basically fucked without decent generator placement.
---
clown
---
Afk wraith using a noed blood warden unrelenting and save the best for last on swamp. Two of us got out but fuck that guy.
---
So you need a +75% killrate to be "viable" ?
---
Idk but i think oni is a very good killer. Or the legion he gonna change but clown is very boring to play and plague to
---
And he moves 5% faster in Frenzy which is actually significant.
---
I'm sorry, am I missing something? Everything seems about right here.
---
If you want great killer perks, go for Clown.
---
Otherwise, I’d wait for the new killer. He’s going to be easy for new players, but hard to master.
---
Well I do agree that it needed a rework, and I didn't personally run it since I didn't think it fit me well, no one held perks up to it's might, no one wants every perk to be like DS or BT, but it's sad that we have so little meta perks and soooooo many dark senses. Even the decent perks that people argue are good are no where near top tier perks.
---
Honestly other then poised, poised is really good lmao
---
It's literally the only exhaustion perk that still works in some way even when you're exhausted, I play survivor and it makes sense to me why they would change it.
---
YES wraith is super OP balance too scary he also can go invisible THATS OP. Fix bhvr
---
No, although I thought it was me until I noticed you were on PC
---
&gt;Considering that Nurse is one of the original 4 killers available when a new player begins the game, I'd say her performance rating is a pretty significant problem.
---
&gt;Absolutely not suggesting she needs a buff, but maybe she isn't the best killer to open the game's experience with.
---
The statistics are misleading. The skill needed to be good with nurse is pretty high. I bet if we looked at the kill rates over # of games nurse would have the lowest kill rate at lowest games played, but the highest kill rate once we look at people with 100s of games experience on an individual killer. IE a 500 game nurse probably performs better than a 500 game hillbilly.
---
I face a lot of Camping killers. They even stay at the Hook if 3 people are running in Front of him
---
Nurse
---
Spirit
---
Already probably working on nerfing oni
---
Legion
---
Freddy that they nerfed and took over a year to fix
---
They dont nerf killer perks, they just kill the killer
---
I have something like a 90%+ win rate on Lery's playing Killer.  The loops on that map outside of the office area are mostly hot garbage for survivors.  Probably one of the easiest killer maps in the game for me.
---
Hag/Spirit/Plague on Hawkins is a slaughterhouse. Especially if you’re using Spirit Fury and Enduring.
---
It's only a milisecond or two but I do agree it's a really annoying bug that should be fixed. The problem with Calm Spirit is that it's already highly situational (counters two low tier Killers, one bad addon on a high tier Killer, one bad perk, and one good perk that no one knows how to use) so the fact that it actually has a tangible downside (no matter how small) moves it firmly from meme tier into trash tier.
---
tbh made this meme after a friend told me about a match where they were playing Huntress with Iron Maiden and someone actually had Calm Spirit to counter it :P
---
From my own anecdotal experience...and from basic logic, mori is significantly better.
---
To use the key you have to do 3 gens, and then find the hatch. Finding the hatch with no audio cue and a killer roaming the map can be pretty fucking challenging.
---
"Most viable build" lol
---
STBFL isn't a build
---
I solemnly believe that F13 is the worst video game to ever exist, I'm very disappointed that I wasted $40 on it day one and spent the amount of time that I did...  For the record, I didn't buy DBD until a little later, I just hate this game on it's own merits and not because of DBD's existence...
---
some people only get time to play on weekends. that plus the bug fixes being postponed is bound to irritate people enough that they’re gonna complain.  sure nonstop bitching is annoying and they devs don’t deserve to be berated, but they should hear people’s complaints. the game wouldn’t improve without feedback.
---
Presentation of information is a huge thing in game design, I think you're on the right track.  
---
Similarly, I think there should be an icon or debuff icon when Killers are in camping range of the hook and losing emblem points. It lets noobies know "camping bad" if you want to rank up.
---
Also you can see Mike's cock right before he pulls you from the gen for not watching around.
---
I guess you're just bad at playing The Game. And the numbers aren't on your side on that one.
---
Lol sorry i wasn’t answering to you but the other guy omg i’m stupid
---
Only a scrub would cry about this.
---
Take Spine Chill to counter stealth killers. Or whatever else, tons of options. And "right off the hook"=60 seconds lol. But not the point. 
---
People will play whatever the hell they want, because it´s strong. Stop complaining and play the game or not.
---
Well thanks to the archive, they can artificially induce killer influx. Trapper was being played every other match for like 3 days. 
---
Honestly I don’t think we need new killers. Flooding the game with “different” powers and skins will water it down. They are already starting to copping similar mechanics from older killers. 
---
We need new ideas. Not new killers.
---
That not the same money
---
Lul nice meme
---
Yes was 2nd. Interesting, so freddy is strongest at red ranks supposedly?
---
I get you OP. Yeah, it gets dull always facing the same killers with the same perk line ups. There's very little diversity because of it. On xbox it's usually Meyers, Meyers, tombstone Meyers, ghostface, spirit, ghostface, spirit 4 more times, potentially a few awful nurses, a freddy running pop and bbq, and then a face camping trapper with NOED. It just sucks the fun out of it. Like, I honestly want to get walloped by a fucking good plague, legion, wraith, or even huntress. Hell, I've actively surrendered myself to get killed to people who at least tried to go at me with one of those killers
---
Why not just run Bond?
---
Still not the point. And yes, I take spine chill.
---
It's not entitlement, most of the time. Killers just get pissed about *how* they lose that 4th kill. Often, it's through no fault of their own.
---
Fore example; keys, doors being too far apart to patrol, DC-into-hatch, toolboxes making games last &lt;5min, etc.
---
I live on a damn island so I have wait until way late at night otherwise it's averaged at like 200-250, sucks but oddly when I play survivor it's ok at about 180-190
---
Cause it's free on mobile. They have to make money some way
---
Where's endgame collapse? Is this an old clip?
---
Then make it so hitting someone with endurance active doesn't stack any perk, and gives no speed boost. I feel that is more than fair for an invulnerability window. No one but the survivor will benefit. They just won't benefit AS MUCH
---
If youre facing a 110 killer hope is the dream perk.  They wont ever catch you
---
Point is, stop whining about lack of diversity. Survivors have 0 diversity in their loadouts, why should killers play off-meta stuff just so you can have a "fun" game.
---
I would have excused them if it was a one time thing. But the servers have been bad for sooo long. They should have fixed them long ago, and instead this happens. It's just not acceptable.
---
Your broke my child dream when i like sponge bob. I know he is a little weird but not like THIS.
---
But let's be honest... most women have bigger fucking balls than most of the guys who go out of their way to send those insults XD
---
How's it going Prayer Beads Spirit?
---
Lol just straight up playing swf is toxic in your eyes? People like to play video games with friends you know
---
I also feel like most people don’t want to practice her in Live Games and get bullied/Gen-rushed to death while trying out her new power and Add-Ons. 
---
If they ever implement that “sandbox training” mode, I feel like that would boost her popularity. I’ve only played her a couple times for that reason, and I still don’t know how her Pink Add-Ons work because I’m afraid to even try them in a live game.
---
/u/peanits A couple stats I would like to see:
---
-Killers who run Noed and ruin and their increased kill rate
---
-Survivors who run keys increased escape percent
---
-Killers who have moris increased kill percent
---
-The sfw percentages and their increased survival rate
---
-Escapes by hatch percent
---
-Escapes by exit gate when the hatch has been closed percent for last survivor
---
Spine Chill definitely. It's such a useful perk and has saved me on more than a number of occasions
---
I think it’s a console thing. Instant down, instant gratification. they flock to that. They are also lower skill to play... so there’s that too.
---
Nice, three examples (Spirit isn't nerfed yet). I could give you a 4 page list of survivor nerfs. I'm still not sure what your point is with this meme.
---
I mean look at his perks
---
Feral Frenzy is just a mess of a power. Not fun to play against, buys you ample time and just makes the game slow to a screeching halt. For the love of god, I hope they rework legion. They’re a band of killers, not 1.
---
They said in the AMA that he's fine and they aren't looking at him at the moment.
---
You don’t know what you’re talking about. Lol. But whatever dude.
---
You need to “kill them by hand” meaning you need to use a Mori or the devour hope perk
---
No I mean the Killer would be forced to leave hook even if they knew someone was there because of the penalty.
---
I do just fine. Like I said I'd like to see the stats by rank. It's clear that bad survivors do bad on the Game. Putting rank 20 and rank 1 survivors in the same stats doesn't give any information about balance. You also haven't told me how the basement pallets are weak. It's 4 completely safe pallets.
---
Nerfs or fixes you call nerfs
---
All 3 are very fun to play IMO
---
I'd probably wait for the Oni though.
---
You need to mori him. Kill him by your own hand
---
Once again, that's how legion was before his previous Nerf. Don't get me wrong I love the second legion rework. I like the new mechanics and restored playstyle, but FF is not rewarding anymore. It applies very little pressure now, it's basically just information now like doc, but doc affects them CONSTANTLY
---
according to the data. But we dont know sample size or anything else to show us the accuracy.
---
Good loops, good spacing, corn is great to hide in and the layout is easy enough to understand where pallets generally are. And imo, the mind games are a bit more survivor favored in these maps because the loops are generally pretty safe. Especially the cow tree loops and the shed loops every now and then,
---
Good luck lmao. Not as easy as it looks, survivor main.
---
I do agree that it can be bullshit in some places *cough cough* Haddonfield *cough cough* but instead of nerfing the perk they should have fixed the maps.
---
I would unironicaly use this every game
---
What... why does this game give me quests to complete with perks I don’t have or know how to get?
---
Absolutely. I tried learning Nurse at rank 9, I got matched over and over with red rank SWFs with full meta loadouts teabagging and ggezing me anytime they had the chance. 
---
So why bother?
---
I love a four man flashlight squad as that probably means they will be busy going for "sick saves" rather than working on gens.
---
A four man toolbox squad though... I fear that.
---
or rancor
---
You need to kill them, aka mori them.
---
You can do this by bringing a mori offering (they look like half skulls, half of a face), or with the perk Hex: Devour Hope with 5 stacks.
---
Same could be said for all the killer changes you listed. A nerf is something that makes something worse, whether warranted or not.
---
Cod Mobile is also free and seasson oass not double expensive..
---
Looking at your responses here and this thread, neither do you.
---
I know but you see there is a nurse no where appear on your post
---
I have footage of me spawning in with a Cypress Mori as Wraith today, one survivor IMMEDIATELY DC's, second survivor DC's as I uncloak next to him, I hook the third 3 times IIRC, and Mori the last, and I depipped.
---
Give it several weeks. If more people start playing Ghostface, you'll hear the same whining that got Nurse and Spirit nerfed. Whether you agree they needed changes or not, the changes were only made due to said whining.
---
Dude, there are 16 maps where balanced landing can be abused more than intended. Lol
---
Not surprised the bugs have reached any and everything related to the game.
---
This has literally nothing to do with dbd
---
I think yes.
---
You honestly aren't one to talk
---
Weirldy enough you are correct, Jason from Friday 13th is kinda weaker then Killers we have in DbD but yet he manages to make survivor look like victims of horror. And here i fear survivors and laugh hard when i outrun a killer heh.
---
Bruh do you even play the game what
---
Billy is a m1 killer who runs like an idiot and eventually can chainsaw rank 20s.
---
How aren't they balanced. This right here is showing that killers are thriving at red ranks...... 
---
The 4man SWFs had the highest survival rate at 48% last round of stats.
---
I still believe huntress is the best designed and balanced killer aside from iri heads
---
T3 Michel vs T1
---
Mechanic wise, the game is 100% survivor sided to degree that survivors can waste a ridiculous amount of time looting and crap, and still win the game while the killer has to find and down survivors quickly 24/7.
---
In reality though, most "red rank" survivors are actually potatoes.
---
i agree but it's conditional right? 
---
Like if you're down to the final 3 gens, and the killer is just patrolling and keeping 3 people off of all 3 gens, it's a nice perk to have to basically tell the survs when you are and are not repairing without the use of voice comms.
---
Given that it can't be used to down Survivors I see no reason it shouldn't be infinite. Legion only suffers from having it on a timer when their power is weak enough in other aspects. 
---
The most you could do with infinite Frenzy would be to have a reasonable chance at actually hitting all 4 Survivors and applying Deep Wounds so that you actually put pressure on everyone while you chase 1 Survivor as an M1 Killer.
---
Which is what Legion was designed to do.
---
How do you abuse BL on most of these? They don’t have strong loops like Haddonfield, although it’s pretty great having it on The Game.
---
Yeah that's why killer queue is almost instant and puts me against survivors 5 ranks better than me while survivor queue takes ages and puts me against killers 5 ranks worse than me.
---
At least that's how PC has been for the past month.
---
Ok here is the issue with the tome that ik they are gonna have. I dont think they can ever have a nurse and possibly huntress tome.
---
Both those killers are incredibly hard to play, and i think it will be frustrating for people who dont play them to pick them up and try to efficiently kill with them.
---
I also dont think a spirit tome will happen unless they fix spirit, bc people will DC against her a lot and no one will have a good time. 
---
also it sucks for people who dont own DLC once they do payed killers, since you would basically have to pay 17$ if you want the battle pass and the killer
---
Franklin’s all day, every day.
---
What’s swf?
---
Ya hes good against people that dont loop, you have a harder time looping spirt than him once you know how to make sure he cant chainsaw, and god forbid spirit has prayer beads lol
---
There is a lot of bullshit with huntress since hitboxes are so inconsistent. I actually couldn't really get into her because of how buggy her hatchets are.
---
Yes its free but its in beta and with full of bugs.. im guess if they have not less but the same prizes than on xboxthen many players would buy auric cell.. like me.. i wont buy them for that prize.. but for less i would purchase more killers already..
---
Spirit is a legit guessing game, her power is pretty straight forward, ever try 90s on a billy?
---
They fall in it passively as well, i think every killer should get passive as well to make some advantage for Survivors not doing secondary objectives like Fredy does. Then it would be a lot more challenging and fun. Just thinking out loud.
---
I don’t like you
---
I didn't think they renewed it tho so is why they had to end it the way they did. It was still a fairly new show
---
ecaped
---
Oh yeah you right. Honestly kinda dumb survivor hitboxes make it impossible to close hatch even when you're like right on top of it. At least Killer bodyblocking it makes a bit of sense.
---
I agree get hit boxes are a bit wack but I can’t place the blame on her for it. But she is well designed regardless
---
Only thing I hate about stealth killers is that most players resort to using that stealth to camp the hook.
---
GF is a notorious motherfucker for this.
---
I honestly don't think they were working on anything. The servers needed a hard reset anyways. There's no way that everyone who plays killer has that bad of internet on a regular basis. I was busy working and playing a different game when I got back from work to care about dbd anyways while it was down. I waited a few hours after I seen a post that they were back up and the improvement in the games playability has had a pretty big impact on reducing the overall lag during matches. The difference is night and day. 
---
If they had scheduled maintenance on the servers once a week like literally every game on the planet then the games health would improve a lot. But they keep them up 24/7/365.
---
good
---
When can we get a nurse one?
---
Trapper on Hawkins is so fun, if you bring trapper bag and carry one with you at all times, theres several rooms (the ones with one staircase up and then a single drop down point) with guaranteed traps more or less. Plus he can shut down that one really safe gen in the upside down room and if your totem spawns on the broken/floating catwalk, its an easy defend.
---
once people realize that the issue with those maps are not fixed bc balanced is gone, we are gonna have a gutted perk and still shitty maps.
---
Also they made hawkins much worse somehow with this nerf.
---
I just realized this post is r/imbadatenglish material
---
One problem also is that Freddy is balanced about sleeping survivors (as he has a lot of things in his load out) but with only one minute awake is too small. Maybe a bigger window of being awake (1 minute and half) would make him more balanced.
---
Don't forget Unnerving, Overcharge, Huntress Lullaby and double calm addons!
---
The emblem and pip system is a bit off at the moment. That is what needs to change, not necessarily the goal of 2 kills being the balance. Ideally, if you are playing against players at your level, you will get 2 kills in the game and safety pip to stay where you are at. If you 3k, you should pip once, and 4k should pip twice, since you are performing better than the players you are against. If you only get 1 kill or 0 kills, you should depip to inch you back to the rank you belong at.
---
Currently it is very wonky. You get killers at red ranks that don't belong there, and killers in green ranks that are better than their rank because of the messed up emblem requirements.
---
The mishaped
---
:) i love her
---
Update.... right after this post, I got a huntress! 
---
Then she camped and tunneled a Claudette. 
---
But it was still more fun than another stealth killer.
---
Entity Displeased is a win, apparently.
---
Oh so that happened to me when I was playing as the spirit, I grabbed a Claudette and tried to hook her but I couldn't , the I couldn't interact with anything because I was still "carrying" the Claudette.
---
I want bunny Jeff now. Do it devs or I will uninstall lol
---
*You know who* **else** *loves this show?!*
---
**MY MOM!**
---
I think the ease that survivors rank up is a big issue. That needs to be addressed first.
---
Outside of that, I think BHVR went too far with perks in some aspects. Think of killer perks that give knowledge of survivor locations, BBQ, Discordance, Nurse's Calling, Whispers. They take the hardest aspect of being a killer, *finding* the survivors, and turns it on to easy mode. It's very hard to avoid BBQ every time because you may be healing or there aren't any lockers around, Whispers lets them know instantly whether to stay in an area or not or move to another gen, Discordance gives them information that will literally put pressure on two survivors at once.
---
I mean the most important aspect of being the killer is taken care of by perks. But the same thing for survivors, avoiding the killer? All they have is Spine Chill realistically, every other perk would trigger in situations where they aren't in a threatening situation to begin with. So survivors are constantly completely in the dark while killers are gifted information with various perks.
---
Then look at gen progression, another main aspect of the game. Killers have multiple very strong perks to prevent gen progression, and when paired, make it damn near impossible to get it done. Thanat, Overcharge, Pop, Ruin, all incredibly effective at slowing down most survivors significantly. Do survivors have any counter to these perks? Nope, they simply have to power through them outside of Ruin.
---
Killers have various combos and builds they can do with slowing down gen progression and locating survivors, and by the time you figure out what they're using, they're 3 hooks in on survivors and you have immense pressure on you. The best perks for survivors are often situational. My decisive strike doesn't even go off half my games, lithe just simply extends chases(I'd use dead hard but it doesn't work 90% of the time for me), unbreakable usually doesn't go off, adrenaline, heh, we're lucky if we get 5 gens done, I could keep going ofc.
---
Then look at addons and tools. Killer pink and purple addons are fuckin *bonkers* dude. They are literally game impacting throughout the entire game. If a killer takes a pink or purple addon your game just got twice as difficult. Survivors though? Bulb sucks and is actually worse than yellow addons, syringe nerfed and is mediocre, brand new part gives you 50% gen progression and then is useless.
---
Every aspect that is outside of the base game, perks, addons, offerings, they all favor killer significantly. Add on top of that some really garbage maps and you're looking at a miserable time as a low purple/red rank survivor.
---
Any body miss when Friday the 13th the game had dlcs?
---
What's easier: fixing every single map or one perk? It's not laziness, its efficiency. Besides, it still has a passive now.
---
wait how did you get dbd on mobile?
---
yea the changes really didnt effect her much
---
Lol!! I love when they have a sense of humor.
---
she was never the best killer in the game, nurse is still the best.
---
I think we are caught in a miscommunication, I’m saying spirit is harder to win against bc of her gimmicky power. I’m agreeing with OP on how billy is one of the best if not the best balanced killer in the game, aside from huntress imo. I put those 2 in the same class
---
Unless the Killer just followed you waiting for BT's Bleedout to end. 
---
Current BT vs. Freddy is basically how it used to work, except it lasted longer. 
---
It was only really good for buying time to get through to a nearby Gate or getting enough distance from a hook so the Killer couldn't dribble to it.
---
This is too true. Pips for killer should honestly be centered around only the number of kills you get, nothing else. All the other stuff you get scored for should just be tied to bloodpoint gains, and not involved with ranking in any way.
---
Probably for u cuz u don’t understand facts.
---
it just takes time brother, art is hard. fucking... really hard.
---
just keep going, dont force urself to draw when you dont want 2, but set a goal for each week. maybe like 1 or 2 full drawings or a few sketches a week
---
So all the whinging about this game being heavily survivor based was total bullshit. If anything, we need to buff survivors and their perks. Either that, or revert killer buffs.
---
Well, at least now we know that if a survivor dies, it's because they were unwelcome to Shrek's swamp
---
Overall, red ranks killer do better than all ranks, wouldn't be surprised if it holds true for The Game in particular too. You're pretty confident for someone who goes against the absolute consensus that The Game is a killer-sided map lol.
---
The basement loop is two sequential pallets, not four, (unless you're counting the two pallets above it but that's just another loop), and it's weaker than a classic shack in most situations. It becomes even weaker if the bathroom generator is finished, and you'll often want to finish it early if you can.
---
Carry on
---
Nice I recommend to swap self heal for another perk that gives you a little bit of distance against killers such as spirt burst or dead heart which i will probs Dave you some times Ggs on that game though
---
That’s pretty much half of those games. 
---
If I get snatched off a gen, then whatever. If I’m camped, fuck that. 
---
Also tired of running myers around for 3-4 gens, then tier 3, hit and hook. By that time, doors are being open and they leave me to die.
---
Why did they have to give her ugly bright pink fake nails.... Disgusting
---
Survive with friends
---
Her hatchets can feel so random, you’re always in for a surprise against her.
---
r/uselessnobody
---
That's actually a pretty solid observation. Guess I'm just dumb lol
---
Survivors have more to do in a game to determine worth though. The best performing survivor on a team might not necessarily survive. They might do all the leg work and great plays, but be the one killed at the end of a match.
---
Tractors on coldwind farm maps might as well be snacks if the survivor has bl, coal tower is almost an infinite as it is without bl, ironworks of misery main building is actually an infinite with bl, Lerrys center can be used to loop the killer for a very long time unless the killer mind games you, and the game has that one staircase with a drop through cement mixer to the bottom and there is usually a staircase nearby that leads you back up.
---
Can’t hate the game for killers trying to kill, yes it’s a shit tactic, yes it’s unfortunate when you’re the one getting camped, but remember, if the killer is camping he should only get one kill that game. Every other survivor should be plowing gens. Just gotta right through it.
---
The majority of people who have played video games don't know shit all about coding and it shows. Working in IT is hard. Shit breaks all the time, sometimes for seemingly no fucking reason. You try fixing something where nothing looks broken. It'll take you hours to figure out the switch that doesn't look like it hooks up to anything is flipped in the wrong direction and it's breaking everything.
---
The clip's from last night btw
---
Stealth killers make the game more fun imo. I wish I got more of them.
---
After playing survivor more for archive/rift stuff, I have noticed that more often than not, survivors appear next to each other AND right next to a gen. I think the spawn points need to be fixed. I had a game yesterday where all 4 of us popped up right next to each other WITHOUT an offering to do so.
---
just take it as an opportunity to learn looping the best you can and hope your team genrushes. sucks when it happens a lot but at least the killer isnt ranking up much if hes face camping every game
---
I'm already at my wits end as survivor. Imagine being me starting the game 2 months ago as a survivor main, in literally the worst time to be a survivor main in the games history.
---
I wouldn't mind it so much if killers on this subreddit didn't tell me the game favors me. They got some fuckin balls to say that when I'm dying in over 75% of my matches, and half the time when I survive it's killer mercy...
---
Tru has left the chat.
---
**ARE WE GONNA BE HERE *ALL* DAY?**
---
The maps will still be shit, but there will be significantly shorter loops because you can't run around a tracker 50 times anymore.
---
huntress is fun to dodge, not every survivor cares about escaping. maybe she was just goofin around practicing and took the L for it.
---
jk i noticed she DCd too.. well that takes the fun out of it!
---
Oh boohoo just a singular pip. That's every game for survivors.
---
I can't just focus on my task of escaping. I have to make sure I unhook, heal, get in chases, and live a long time. I've had games where the killer was playing like an idiot, we do the gens, and leave, and depip.
---
I don’t agree with u but I don’t disagree either.
---
Not when it’s every game. Jump scares are funny as hell... but it’s being drilled into the ground. I’m just tired of their play style.
---
Sorry if I'm not trying to change my gameplay around a moronic and arbitrary pip system instead of just trying to maximize sacrifices.
---
If their justification for balance is sacrifices, why is the ranking system so absurdly far removed from sacrifices?
---
yea, you cant run harvester at all now. They gutted the loop entirely
---
Me too! He killed me later but I forgave him lolol
---
Yeah I agree, and that's kind of my point. One of the game's opening killers has the highest learning curve of any killer in the game. That would ideally be an experience that you have to opt into.
---
Unfortunately, "red ranks" doesn't really mean anything.
---
Anybody can hit red ranks if they have the slightest idea what they're doing.
---
The result is that in red ranks, you'll typically have 1-2 dipshits running around getting themselves killed. This means there's too much dead weight for those 2-3 competent players to carry, and the match quickly falls apart.
---
The reason most kill rates at red ranks around around 70% is that those boosted monkeys make a good half of matches into hatch games.
---
If there's no dipshits and you're trying to have fun with Wraith you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Sorry, I looked at the glossary and the FAQ but didn't see it. What does nerfing refer to?
---
nobody would play anyone but the best suvivors. i personally would hate that change
---
I guess.
---
The killer can't chase all survivors at once though so if the team is smart they will run away when the killer gets close but go right back to the gen after the killer leaves. Eventually, the killer has to dedicate to a chase.
---
Yeah... good survivors only show themselves during the pick up animation. 
---
If I see a survivor nearby I’ll always chase them first.
---
Do many people listen to music when they play? The audio in this game is so important, I don't think I could listen to music when I was playing.
---
Yes Keys by a mile.  They are by far the most difficult item in game to counter.  Franklin's only works up to a point they or someone else can always pick it back up.  Keys only true counter and calling this a counter isn't particularly fair is you MUST end your game with only 2 gens completed that way they can't get more than one person out with it.  3 gens is all it takes for final 2 to bail out the map.  2 gens completed only or that's the risk.  Rough but that's what it takes.
---
I'm guessing you missed the news about the matchmaking rework that happened almost year ago.
---
Here's the short and sweet of the MM rework: they pool survivors until they get a good match with a killer, then they pop in. But it's not always going to be 4 popping in at once.
---
https://reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a0n1nv/new_matchmaking_system_information/
---
It's because of the emblem update and consoles(most likely ps4). It's always been to achieve a 'merciless' victory using that killer's three unique perks. Before the emblem system all that meant was getting a 4k to achieve merciless victory. After the emblem update a merciless victory is whatever the emblems need to be to equal merciless, I think 2 gold 2 iridescent is the minimum but I could be wrong. I know Sony is real finicky about developers changing achievements post-launch on their platform so Behavior probably isn't even allowed to change it. I don't know if Xbox is like that but I know they could definitely update it on pc. The problem therein lies, though, that then achievements for the same adepts would have different requirements across platforms and they probably don't want to do that because then everyone would bitch about how it's unfair that pc/xbox/whatever gets to obtain those achievements easier. The only reason survivor adepts only require escaping with them is because that's what it always required prior to the emblem system and is worded as such. 'Escape with x using only their three unique perks' vs 'Achieve a merciless victory using only x's three unique perks.' The requirements for merciless changed with the new pip system and killer adepts have always specified merciless victory, not kill all survivors in a trial.
---
Good, that shit was literally a jungle gym except with no pallet.
---
Yes I understand you're at that particular time in a player's life and they play this game and they absolutely hate everything about it because of a common thing that happens. Yes it is annoying and it does happen but the killer can be punished for their mistakes the same way survivors can. Don't worry it happens to everybody. Just yesterday I had a series of terrible games has both sides
---
Death metal, black metal, nu metal, thrash metal, indie pop, synthwave, vaporwave and lo-fi hip-hop.
---
I rarely listen to music while playing DBD but whenever I do it's something not very loud.
---
I’m a better killer than I am survivor, so I always just have self care on because I’m normally in yellow ranks, and people aren’t the best at healing in yellow ranks XD
---
I also always flub my dead hards LOL Once I’m more comfortable on Survivor though I will definitely take it off since you can technically self care with a medkit!
---
Thanks for the advice! :)
---
Maybe! Or maybe even a free-but-over-rank-15 wall. Definitely not suggesting it's an easy problem to solve, but were I in BHVR's shoes that statistic would make me squirm.
---
"1/4 intro killers really sucks to play as for new players. She is the hardest of all of the hard killers."
---
It's hard enough for new players to learn loops and pallets, nevermind highly punishing chain blinks.
---
I think they were perfect and now she is entirely balanced so survivors CANNOT complain just because she happens to be a strong killer
---
The reason you feel that way as a survivor is because it's your only chance at sanity...at least it is for me. I die over 75% of my games as survivor. If surviving was a requirement for "winning" I would have quit a long time ago.
---
I always thought the entity would be more interested in krampus.
---
im not 2 sad its gone, but god they really fucked over rotten fields since other then shack those are the only barriers for the middle of the map
---
Spirit players approve of this outfit.
---
What’s the password? *Ooooorgy*
---
How someone still dont know? Pm me ;)
---
It’s because us solo players suffer because the toxic swf
---
Hmm for fun bubba
---
You gotta take the hit and finish it
---
Look at what just happened to insta heals even though Eboni Mori and any purple to pink killer addon still exists. That's because BHVR needs to do anything to get whiny killers to just shut the fuck up.
---
Yeah....good killers KNOW the survivor is nearby on each down to make said flashlight saves.  Find them first prior to pickup lol!  They have a tiny window for executing the timing so they can literally only be so far from your downed survivor making them very easy to find.  No offense but if you're picking up survivors without knowing you have to flush out the flashlight holder that's 100% a misplay on you.  I get flashlight saved against like 3 times a year and that's when I downed in the open and they FOUND a flashlight in a chest or something meaning I didn't see any in the lobby.
---
100%?...that's bold of you to say...considering it takes a killer 2 minutes tops to tunnel one player and catch him and end his game by camping him. A killer will be there the entire duration of the match. A survivor has to hope his teammates save him/doesn't get camped in order to be there by the time the 5th gen is completed. There are negatives on both sides but killers have it in their favor to enjoy a full game.
---
You would go right back to survivor. Killer is rough.
---
she is not balanced, they didnt fix her, they made her better, but didnt fix the issues with her.
---
you still cant tell when she is phasing, you still have no idea where she is when she is phasing, and she still has SOOO much info, way 2 much for a killer moving that fast.
---
Hell in ways the hit box changes might actually make her easier since she can just run past you and block your pallet/window
---
...yes...yes they fucking do. Being a survivor is hell right now.
---
Leatherface, and Oni are fun
---
There used to be such strong killers I think. Nurse before the nerf and spirit. I main spirit and I use devour hope with speed and duration buff, i remember getting a thirteen streak of mori-ing every survivors in match. Btw Rank 1 already so i got nowhere to pip to. I’m also pretty sure some of the teams were SWF because they tried really hard to get my totem. It’s so op I felt guilty after a while. Now with the nerf hopefully everything will settle.
---
I mean yeah it's obvious what everyone has to do, the perk just makes it easier to coordinate that without comms is all I'm saying. Great perk.
---
I agree, concept and design wise. His trailer really makes me think of suicide if I was in Fengs shoes. Imagine a 6ft evil like him existing in reality. The power to fry your mind in thin air, causing horrifying madness then torturing you with his knowledge of human anatomy. I would rather take my own life then go against Doctor or Hag in real life
---
I wouldn’t be able to focus on the game if I listened to music while playing, the sounds are very important for your success. But when I do listen to music, I mainly listen to death metal, 90s-2000s rock/grunge and I’m a sucker for old school hip hop/r&amp;b and also Lady Gaga lol
---
ok yeah I pm ya  now ....
---
Whoa, wait... Bunny Feng?? If this is a thing, then you best believe I w a n t it
---
You had to play at some point to get those BP though.
---
I'm talking about each sides chances of winning, not overall "enjoyment" of the game.
---
I thought this may be a prominent answer. Just wanted to find out. Sometimes I’ll have music playing in the background from my phone or laptop which doesn’t effect my headphone audio :)
---
And btw ur points are stupid cuz when I talk facts and u have no chance to say nothing else against my argument so u have just tried ur best to roast me kinda pathetic.
---
As a survivor main who has started playing killer and is already in the green-purple ranks, yes it fucking is. Might be harder to pip now, but it is easy as fuck to kill anyone that isn't a coordinated 4 man swf.
---
Still extremely survivor sided given how ginormous the map is.
---
Declaring your opinion to be a fact doesn’t make it a fact. 
---
Even if you believe that rank is literally just an indication of how much time you spend playing the game and nothing more, that in itself has *some* correlation with skill. Time spent doing something improves your ability to do it.
---
I mean if you get 2 kills odds are they finished the game very quickly meaning you got no gatekeeper.
---
Indoor maps are better for killer In general especially with aura seeing perks and skills. Survivors tend to be more stressed and do less objectives.
---
And then you miss the skillcheck
---
Yeah I’m the same, if music is on - it’s only quiet from my phone or laptop :)
---
Exactly, it most likely took them some time before they even knew what the problem was, and with that on top of actually trying to fix it, it’s lucky they fixed it in such a short time
---
Preach my man
---
I done that once and i was so proud of myself, for 5 seconds, then i died xd. Still 2 survivors made it to the exit.
---
"Bro you want some harmless cosmetics that represent some people's sexualites and also possible making all money gained from purchases go towards charities whilst doing no harm in or outside the game except from making some sweaty, homophobic incels on the internet angry? I dunno man seems very non-gamer of you"
---
Yeah I figured it would be hard, I sometimes have it playing in the background from my phone. Nothing like a bit of lady Gaga while slashing 😂
---
You think Borrowed Time is gonna save you? Pathetic.
---
I think BHVR has to grow some fuckin sack and tell killers to stop whining and that they're utterly dominating survivors at every phase of the game.
---
&gt; As a killer, the noticeable difference is that you will see all four survivors appear almost simultaneously in the online lobby.
---
and yet we dont, and we can see its clearly because they arent together. the difference is quite stark based on rank as well.
---
for example, I'm currently in purple ranks, and around 80% of my games have 3-4 pop in at once. if you see their playstyle and their friends list, its clear these people are all playing together on comms. But a short time ago, I played on my partner's account to do his killer challenges for him, since he hates that mode. So I was at ranks 20-15. suddenly, all 4 were popping in separately each time, because they were solo. the difference is obvious, and the devs can tell me whatever they want, but the truth is clear in front of my face and the face of every other killer.
---
Have we not beat this horse carcass into pile of dust and pulp yet
---
I have a buddy who literally studied the perk names and descriptions on Quizlet.
---
But each character would be a different playstyle, so there wouldn't be best just best at certain things.
---
So Scott Jund talked [a bit](https://youtu.be/V1-32zB3ejY) about stealth lately (concerning Oni) and said that stealth is not a viable counter to a Killer. Saying stealth is the only counter to a Killer is admitting that the Killer is so strong that your only option is to avoid chase entirely. 
---
And that's the thing, Billy is not only counterable by stealth. He can still be looped. He still has punishments for missing chainsaws mid chase and he still has problems with some tiles. So I hope the devs understand this and let the complaints fall on deaf ears. Because Billy is the last bastion for strong and balanced Killers in the game atm.
---
No god no i play in console and I dont want to play huntress
---
If you don't call the top floor part of that loop you can't call the 2 basement pallets part of the same loop. They're the same level of safe as God pallet being that you have to break it or you'll never get the hit.
---
NANI!!!
---
Deadmau5. I play it before a match
---
depends of your playstyle and the difference of average skill level between you and the survivors team.
---
When rank reset happens you 2 pip your way out of green ranks without killing anyone. You just down and hurt everyone constantly and 2 hook them all. You keep 3-4 gens unrepaired as long as you can. 
---
You let them all escape and still 2 pip.
---
At high ranks,  you can still do that but you need to at least kill one dude to assure Silver and Iridescent in Devout and Malicious and get one pip with a iridescent chaser emblem and gold gatekeeper for exemple.
---
You have to remember that you need to hurt survivors a lot of time (it means that one shoting hurt your malicious emblem gain) and need to keep 4-5 gens unrepaired as long as possible. 'Cause each unrepaired gen give you gatekeeper points each seconds.
---
Which means that during the first part of the game, you are supposed to focused more on patrolling all gens and hurting/downing survivors rather than hooking them.
---
Spending time on a chase at the start of the game is really hurtful for the killer at high ranks. Even a 20s chase is too much at the start 'cause all other survivors aren't busy healing themselves they just rush gens.
---
Moris taken out of DBD
---
Oh man I want to experience this
---
Twitter is so toxic at least compared to Reddit.
---
This reminded me of that gta san andreas mod
---
But they will trick their chat and fanboys into thinking that they run into those survivors +50% of their matches.
---
&gt;You can't balance around that.
---
Indeed, dbd is a casual game at the end of the day
---
Your a traitor to the Ace community. Smh😂
---
The ol' disrespect!
---
At red ranks you often depip with anything less than a 4k.
---
I'm not a fan of facing ghostface at the moment, bubba I only hate when they camp otherwise hes fine
---
Should show % of hatch escapes, % of kills/escapes in a game with a D/C and % of 4-man clean sweeps (escape and kills).
---
Maybe even an average trial length to try and judge if a rank mismatch or attrition match occurred.
---
tbf the Pig can be pretty OP, like i think the changes might have been for the best
---
I think that's the internet in general, everyone defaults assumption to a guy. Maybe it's a built up society habit or something. I know a lot of people - good people, who assume that. They have good intentions, but they still refer to the unknown as 'he' instead of 'they'. It's only when we're told to stop or when we know for sure we dial it back.
---
Dead by daylight community is pretty illiterate overall in my experience
---
I feel that anyone who puts that kind of time into nurse would be better off investing their time into someone else. Billy, Spirit or Freddy are only slightly less weak than an optimum Nurse and you could learn all 3 in the time it takes to master Nurse. And if you take a break at all with Nurse you lose your edge instantly.
---
cute baby Bubba
---
Erin from You’re Next would be a kickass survivor. If it was a chapter, having a killer as well, maybe called The Pack, where you could switch out the fox, sheep, and lion mask (a bit like the legion). Idk what the powers or perks would be but it would be cool.
---
The game has the problem that one side can snowball very easily. One survivor out is a huge advantage. Two survivors is gg and hide from the hatch. As a killer,if the first chase goes badly,it means 3 gen popped. 
---
I would agree for reduced gen speed,if you will be able to have a chance to win as two peoples.As now,it is the most boring shit for more sides.
---
because she's boring as fuck to play
---
Well I mean the odds are in the favor of survs right? But ultimately the killer *should* be and is stronger. I don't think that's bad game design at all. 
---
And to be frank, if someone believes the balance to be so far out of whack to call the game essentially broken i.e. "bad game design," they can simply opt to not play the game lol that's the beauty of games is there's always another one if you don't like it.
---
I wish there was a middle finger emote for survivors.
---
😂😂😂 this made my morning, thank you
---
Doctor and camping bubba. The clown is pretty fucking annoying too
---
Ahhh that’s awesome!! It’s been a while since I’ve listened to him
---
If the gates aren't opened and it isn't a high mobility killer i'll try and find noed and come to save you. Otherwise i'll just leave asap.
---
This is the only situations where I'll teabag the killer. No regrets.
---
Don’t listen to the 2 trolls above. Bubba is the worst killer in the fucking game lol. Do yourself a favor and buy ghost face, or another licensed killer. Oni, Hag, and killers made by BHVR you can buy with in game currency instead of real money
---
someone's here is rushing a beatiful serie called "ash vs evil dead", if you wanna talk about it, here I an
---
Ma’am, this is a Wendy’s
---
As a killer main I can say DS is fine as is. If you do happen to find the person you hooked you slug them but in doing so take the risk of a teammate healing them. It's situational but powerful.
---
swear to fuck if they touch Freddy, man
---
I heard the nun from the conjuring might get added they honestly missed an opportunity with Freddy he should've been Robert englund hellraiser would be cool and putting people on hooks are right up his alley
---
Dude I went full brightness and still couldn’t see that
---
No fuckin wonder I can never spot the blendettes in my matches
---
The only reason I’d know to check their is the scratches
---
there is always gonna be the “meta” regardless. like healing is not nearly as important as gen speed. but i guess yeah. i just like being able to play every survivor to my own playstyle
---
So you're worried about the two worse perks in game being even worse on Legion?
---
I cant help it. Everytime I see his face I'm reminded he's a white nationalist.
---
I wouldn't. Im rank 1 both sides, i lose 0 games on the way to rank 1 as killer. I dont use ruin either. Will upload any gameplay if needed. Killer is overhyped.
---
Reddit Killers always try to delude themselves into thinking Killers are weak despite stats showing that theres a 60% kill rate for the **weakest** killer at red ranks. Theres this victim mentality that killers are so weak and helpless. This is obviously not the case.
---
Turns out if you view anything other than a 4k 5 gens left no add ons as a “loss”, you’ll feel like you’re losing most of your games.
---
I mean ideally you wouldn't do this against stealth killers
---
Can't continue this if you are getting salty
---
I'd love to see some American Horror Story characters as killers and survivors
---
That's across all ranks, including rank 20s who don't know what a pallet is.
---
They have too much working against the Killer; corn, horrible jungle gym placement, cow tree and strong main buildings.
---
Yep, any killer can be viable at red rank, if the player puts time into that killer. I think the reason for all the “this killer isn’t red rank viable!!” complaints is cause so many people jump from killer to killer trying to play all of them and expecting to be just be good with them without time/effort. Also part of the not viable argument stems from thinking every game should be 3-4K.
---
Yeah my anxiety goes through the roof when people dont look behind them
---
"friends".
---
Legion. Forever and always, dumb mechanics, dumb story, dumb cosmetics. So boring.
---
I'm just pissed that just about every game I've wanted to play lately keeps crashing. Like, dbd and destiny went down back to back.
---
You'll get a points notification (the scrolling notifications on the left of your screen) entitled "Killer Blind".
---
Plague. Not because she’s OP, but the stupid fucking plague crap negates EVERY healing perk, every medkit, and any concept of stealthing. It’s not strong, it just means the game is nothing but rush gens and leave anyone else behind. Worse than legion in terms of interactivity.
---
If two people got out (assuming you didn't get cheated by a key) that means they got out via the gates. That means you're probably getting a silver Gatekeeper *at best*. 2 points.
---
A 2k gives you a silver Devout (assuming no bleedouts). 2 points.
---
A 2k means your Malicious has at least 12 points. If you're an M1 killer downing people normally, you'll probably get a silver for a 2k. If you're oneshotting people, you'll probably get a Bronze because fuck you. 1-2 points.
---
In the event of a 2k, it's highly likely that you'll have to secure your last kill in the endgame. This means you're going to spend 2 minutes facecamping that poor Meg to make sure you get the kill, because the moment you step away you'll have to contend with the remaining two players going for saves with Borrowed Time, DS, and Dead Hard at the ready. This means you lose 900 points, and with the poor performance associated with a 2k you'd be lucky to get a bronze after that. 0-1 point.
---
So that's 5-7 points total in a 2k scenario.
---
At red ranks, you need 9 points to *safety*.
---
*Good fucking luck* getting 16 points for a pip.
---
Jason is really unbalanced,  in one game he teleported on me and insta killed me
---
Wow youre dense. You clearly dont play legion if you still havent realised what im talking about. Or actually have no basic knowledge of killers. Also sloppy...bad perk...youre joking right ? Yeah this conversation is over im not interested in debating with someone with less than 10p hours
---
A "special favor" for another favor.
---
At high ranks, she's strong when you give up gens and basically make 1 corner of the map deadly, which a lot of people don't understand. The amount of times I've ran hags for 3+ gens because all they do is chase with no traps down and just place traps mid loops is honestly kinda sad. Choose your gens, trap them up, and force survivors into them. You should *never* chase with less than 5 traps on the ground, IMO.
---
Yes "friends"
---
Freddy easily... I have no desire to attempt to go against him, he's annoying and probably one of the harder ones to actually go against on console.
---
Ghostface is a very close second..... I always end up getting jumpscared by him.
---
I know that’s what he said. He still could put credit.
---
&gt;he doubted it would even work
---
Yea and yet "GoYz I tHoUgHt oF a NeW mEtA" yet he had just learned about it.
---
Ghostface is bomb as fuck
---
I use pandora when I play and you can control the music vs game audio settings.
---
The spirit mainly. I don't have an exact reason, she's just a pain in my ass lol
---
Metal and rap mostly.
---
I mean, the math is pretty clear. It is very difficult for a killer to beat a group of survivors playing optimally. The speed of completion of objectives for survivor and killer are just different. It's very possible for a good survivor to loop a good killer for 3 gens if the killer doesn't give up the chase. Yeah yeah, a good killer won't tunnel for 3 gens, but the point is the potential is there. Good survivors can loop for a long time and gens do not take long to complete but represent a sizable portion of the total objective. Hooks take longer and represent a comparatively smaller portion of the total objective.
---
16M radius of the killer or of the hook?
---
It’s the truth
---
I mean there is a reason there isn't a voice chat in the game.
---
Meaning that level of coordination was never intended to be in the game otherwise they'd have their own voice chat system.
---
Which strikes me as strange that, at any point in time, they balanced a killer around the idea that people cant talk to each other
---
something with the animation not having started even though the save bar was full. its bullshit happens to me all the time against doc in treatment mode
---
Getting into red ranks only requires a modicum of skill and a bunch of time. If they were just stats for people who hit red ranks around the first week of the reset maybe it'd be more useful, but as is there's only so much selection for skill.
---
Case in point, scope Trapper and Bubba's places in the Red Rank stats. There is no world where either of those two are better than Huntress or Demogorgon, much less Nurse, but they are generally easier to play properly. They demand less mechanical skill and most of the knowledge to play them right is general killer knowledge.
---
edit: It's also probably why Freddy is so high, and why he doesn't move up in kill rate half as much as Nurse. From a mechanical standpoint he's a more straight forward Clown with map pressure.
---
Oh boy are you gonna tell me to **M i n d g a m e** people?
---
Wow what a pro gamer move.
---
If that was enough to be a viable killer, old Freddy wouldn't have been a complete failure.
---
Reworking a map and balancing a perk are different levels of effort. Also, imagine being so lazy your don't even proofread your meme lol
---
Huntress is my least favorite killer to play against. I feel like ever since dedicated servers became a thing the hitreg on her hatchets has become such bs. Almost every time I am behind a map prop or fully rounded a corner where I am no longer in line of sight but still get hurt or downed anyway. It's straight up frustrating.
---
That's wild. I have around 600 hours and I honestly cant say I've ever seen a racial slur.
---
Thats the problem right there. 1 pip is a win. 2 pips is just stomping them and winning by a huge margin.
---
Wat lmao
---
Oh.....nah.😭
---
PC or console? I'm on PS4. I play both sides but I play survivor when I want chill games. Mostly a killer main.
---
since when did corrupt beat out ruin, ruins stronger then ever with the totem hiding spots improved
---
I love that even with stats proving that if anything, the game is killer sided, people in this thread are still trying to make a point for the contrary. "Give us that stat, this stat", arguing kill rate isn't the most relevant stat of killer performance... lol. Yeah guys, on a bad map vs a team of .1% survivors the game truly is survivor sided, too bad that almost never is the case and the stats show it.
---
Good, she should look like a normal person
---
Good ol’ Adrenaline. Do gens!
---
I main killer so I can give you another side. Dead hard is the easiest to bait out. Just wait and the survivor will use it if they have it. My preference is lithe
---
&gt;These stats suggest that the game actually gets easier for killers as they get better at the game.
---
It's frustrating to see so many people completely miss the fact that *by definition* red ranks contains only killers that can maintain that kill rate.  Anything less *and you drop out of red ranks*, so it doesn't tell you anything about balance other than "there is a group of players that can maintain that kill rate".
---
Not at all. There are killers with low skill ceiling, simple abilities, and you can do whatever the fuck you want, you still won´t be able to beat certain situations. No matter how well you do, you can only do so much to loop perfectly or work within the mechanics of the game. 
---
Whereas Nurse allows you to completely bypass those mechanics, as long as you put in the time to improve. Her *skill ceiling* is much higher.
---
Easiest upvote of my life
---
You don’t understand. The guy on the bed is Myers
---
I believe Freddy needs his sleep nerf back. Like hitting a survivor when they are awake should but them to sleep but should cause the deep wound effect not the instant hit.
---
No problem btw what killer do you Play as I just bought screamer like a day or two ago and I’m trying to level up hag as much as I can to get the hex ruin and then ill main screamer. What is you’re perk load out  cause I’m not the smartest with the killer perks
---
That’s just rude
---
........do it again
---
Madison or Queenie from Coven would be so funny. Any of the witches could have really cool perks tbh
---
Lmao as soon as Spirit and Nurse got nerfed, **Billy** is now right behind Freddy, as I predicted. Freddy at least takes skill though. Billy has been busted from day 1, and requires almost no practice.
---
**I can't wait for his inevitable nerf.**
---
For Freddy, I'd just remove the dream traps, make him invisible to awake Survivors, and give him a timed AOE sleep ability. Survivors caught in it are put to sleep, and cannot work on generators. However, they CAN wake themselves up, just like mending Deep Wounds or curing Madness. Awake teammates could also wake them up. Their bodies could maybe even remain where they fell asleep, teleporting to them if they get hooked.
---
2k should be a safety pip according to the devs I think
---
You’re right they don’t lie! In fact, they show that in over 85% of matches at red ranks the killer does not pick Spirit!
---
Not really.
---
It's frustrating to see so many people completely miss the fact that *by definition* red ranks contains only killers that can maintain that kill rate. Anything less *and you drop out of red ranks*, so it doesn't tell you anything about balance other than "there is a group of players that can maintain that kill rate".
---
That’s where you’re wrong, he was just bringing up the idea and never got to test it. He was brainstorming, wondering if something like that could be meta. In later vids, his watchers proved him wrong. He was by no means declaring it meta or complaining about it, again, this was said day one of the PTB, during a stream where nothing is scripted.
---
Streamers have thoughts, watchers expect to know their favorite streamers reactions and thoughts.
---
It’s not as if he put out a video explaining a new meta or anything.
---
He was also not claiming it as his own. He was putting his own twist on the untested idea his viewers put out.
---
And most 4 man's end up suiciding for altuism
---
The pig for me. I just always seem to be the first one killed when I go up against her
---
I'm not sure if this is the right template to use, but ok
---
A pip is intended to move you up the ranks, it shouldn't be the baseline. If you two killed, you're at a point where both you and the survivors are performing equally well and shouldn't rank up to be matched against better opponents.
---
Don't worry  as soon as you get high ranks you will have to remeber only 4/5 perk for survivors and 4 for killers
---
Thrash and heavy metal mostly. From Mötley Crue to Rammstein to AC/DC.
---
I also like some Banjo music, Bagpipes, epic instrumental(if that's a genre) after that there is some Indie music, a few pop songs, etc.
---
And even that was still under 50% lol
---
Alternativealy have the killer chase you, because you can loop better than your friend, while that friend repairs the last gen and opens the exit gate.
---
The Shape. Common, overrated, and boring to play against. He really just stands there and that's it
---
Wanna bet?
---
I definitely need to do something with at least the lower eyelids because not only are they very almond shaped ( which I tried to paint black to give the illusion of wider eye holes since foam latex is very difficult to cut ) but they for some reason bend inwards and touch my OWN eyelids and it's the most irritating thing ever. I dont know how people wear this mask skin-tight lmao
---
But I most likely will be making a brand new one in the future with better painting techniques and better cutting so I can have the slightly larger eyes and make it so the neck isn't so wide! Thanks for your constructive criticism 💕
---
Hello u/howtojump.
---
I want to play a game.
---
Inside this room are no pallets, and a deadly Killer just came in the only door behind you. Your goal is to escape the room alive. You know, most people are so ungrateful to be alive. So go on.
---
Make Your Choice.
---
Dude I’m not bad at assuming the game is survivor sided I’m just a word what u have probably never heard of. Logical.
---
Yes, you are completely right, and it is exactly the reason why people simply don´t bother with her. They could spent hours and hours getting better with nurse and completely decimate survivors...but why bother when a nice billy or spirit or freddy will achieve the same end result? And that is what you see in these stats. But that doesn´t mean she is a weak killer-she is just a killer with a high skill floor, but also very high skill ceiling.
---
Whether it is worth it to play her or not is an entirely different question.
---
Number of matches is not important unless its a tiny number that could taint results.  On average spirit gets 3 kills a game doesnt matter if its 1000 or 10000 games. its still 3 kills per game.  Freddy gets a little more but still about 3 kills per game again 1000 matches or 5000 matches its still 3 kills per game and it shows on a per game basis they are about the same especially looking at red ranks because the noob factor is gone.  The pick rate is not a factor when it comes to balance because its not an indicator of strength its popularity and nothing more.
---
I was watching a stream by u/Peanits recently and it looked like we weren't getting any more stats, so I'm very glad to see these!
---
Not very surprised to see Haddonfield as the safest map, but it's interesting to see popularity against kill rate - makes me wonder if the increased popularity makes the kill rate "more accurate", and if the least popular killers have a skewed kill rate (e.g. Nurse being dragged down due to the learning curve and difficulty of "flicking" with controller sensitivity).

---
Guess the whole genre as a whole would just be labeled as electronica since there are huge amounts of variations in that genre. I listen to that the most.
---
No I don't listen to anything while I play. Only during queue times and loading screens.
---
I will never forget the match I had where huntress hit me while I had the gen at 99%. I quickly finished the gen, adrenaline popped, then I jumped out the window with a hatchet flying at me. 
---
Felt good man.
---
Love wholesome memes. GG WP
---
&gt;Ranking up is just way too easy, until bhvr figures out how to not let potatoes into red ranks killers will be over perform, as red rank killers are brutal and don't let people do any mistakes. 
---
This, this is the main problem. It is the ROOT of every problem in dead by daylight.
---
Killers rank up to quickly face survivors that are too strong, and now they just keep losing because the system is forgiving and doesn't rank them down. And now they're stuck facing survivors way out of their league.
---
Survivors I would say are kinda on the same boat.
---
This is what needs to be fixed. They need to find a different metric for ranking up, or make it harder to actually rank up. Truth is winning should make you go up. And more importantly, losing should make you go down.
---
They should change the generic information displayed on the loading screens to a rotating description of different perks. It's kind of a waste to use that space to explain what the hatch is to someone who has played the game for longer than a week.
---
It's the animation. I notice the same thing with Clown. The fact that their animation shows them walking but they go at base killer speed (115%) makes it feel like they're faster.
---
Still want to see Sidney Prescott and/or Randy Meeks as survivors. Can't believe they put Ghost Face out the door without an accompanying survivor.
---
U can’t rly say that I don’t play survivor cuz u do not know me and I’m not just asking killer buffs I’m also asking survivor perk buffs. U are such a moron and it’s annoying that u don’t see it ur self.
---
That is literally impossible.
---
At the end of each minute you gain 5 points for each generator that is not completed.
---
You stop getting points in this way after 9 minutes.
---
I'll be **super** generous here and not only say that it counts the 7 generators on the map and not the 5 gens that need to be done, but that you're a god and managed to keep all of those gens unpowered for the entire 9 minutes (but somehow managed to fuck up and let all the gens get done afterwards).
---
(5 points per gen per minute) x (7 generators) x (9 minutes) = 315 points.
---
You need 350 points for a silver.
---
Nice bullshit buddy.
---
True but I'm not an asshole devoid of empathy. So even if the game goes a little worse for me I still want others to enjoy it as well. It's a game... But how people play is of course up to them.
---
Its still easy at high ranks lmao, unless its spirit or Nurse then you mega fucked
---
I think the bigger problem is that it’s too easy to rank up / too hard to depip, especially as survivor. For the most part the only realistic way to depip as survivor is to get found immediately and then get tunneled/camp til you die. 
---
Look at other games like LoL, DotA, CS, etc. People in the highest ranks are the players that are truly masters of the game and understand the game completely, know the ins and outs of every interaction in the game,  etc. Because in those games if you want to be in the highest rank you need to legitimately be a top tier player. Then you look at DBD and as long as you are above average and play enough you should be able to hit the highest ranks in the game. It’s not even that it takes a coordinated SWF to beat a killer, 4 legitimate rank 1 survivors (as in they are truly masters of the game) that are all solo can manhandle a killer just as hard a coordinated SWF. It’s just that there are very few survivors who are actually this good at the game, even at rank 1.
---
I feel like the Survivorship bias is in full effect here. The devs cant just put out this data without their interpretation of the data. Data alone can be incredibly misleading if not looked through the right lens. To me this shows that most players dont play optimally, so trying to gather balance data from this is futile. All you can get out of this is what killers are picked most often, since very clearly the kill rate isnt that relevant since they all sit at roughly the same level. 
---
(SURVIVORSHIP BIAS: [Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)
---
They where wimps who thought you had an ebony prob
---
Yup, ruin is a bandage that is not even fun for survivors, it hurts bad players way harder than good players and coordinated teams. Few killers can defend gens in big maps like freddy, nurse and hag i'd say. Maybe also Billy since he can move quickly but not everywhere. I dont even know how people who run purple toolboxes + brand new part enjoy the game, like do you like being chased for only like 2 times in a game before finishing all the gens?
---
No, no they should not
---
&gt;but once you rank up, this changes, and suddenly, a huge majority of lobbies suddenly get 3 at a time or 4 at a time. the devs can claim it doesnt happen all they like, but our eyes arent lying to us. The devs are. 
---
Strongly disagree with this mate, when I play survivor I often get put into lobbies with survivors and we'll be waiting on a killer to join, it's just something new that's been changed with dedicated servers like the other guy said. 
---
It could definitely be something to do with ranks as you mentioned though, I've noticed it happens more to me as I rank up survivor, so maybe there's just more high ranked survivors in queues than there are killers.
---
Who uses feet to buy things?
---
1. Trapper
---
2. Hag
---
3. Clown
---
4. Cannibal
---
The first two for obvious reasons as they both make me shit myself but at least Hag's one doesn't hurt me so it's lower.
---
Clown I just can't see anything when playing him and it's kinda aggravating but at the same time it's a part of his kit that makes him, him.
---
I hate Cannibal just for simply how pissing annoying it is when I am caught out by say running to a loop that should have a pallet but doesn't cause it was broken by another survivor. If I'm caught out in the open then that's my fault and no else's.
---
Edit: Name Consistency.
---
You both are definitely wrong
---
Anytime 😂😂
---
Don't worry, most of them are so shit you'll never have to actually understand them
---
She's just so awkward to play is the main reason vs pickup and play killers like Billy or Freddy
---
I AM NO MAN
---
I can see it being something along the lines of how rage mechanic from F13. The more pallets he breaks as well as stuns taken builds a meter when it's full he's in a tank mode where he can destroy pallets vaults fast as well as a inbuilt bamboozle effect as well as no terror radius.
---
Same here on PS4 and just more people on during the evening
---
I never get the reasoning behind it, same with hook suicides because of a potential Mori. "Oh no you can kill me after first hook, I'll just kill myself on the hook instead! Outplayed!"
---
Constantly heard how these maps were survivor sided, and I was downvoted once for disagreeing, but generally just ignored it. On streams I'd hear it often though.
---
They so clearly aren't and this proves it. How annoying.
---
It's way harder to escape and impossible to hide in comparison to other maps. You get off a gen and the killer can see the gen from down the entire hall as their terror radius hits you, in full light. Stealth killers are also crazy on these maps compared to others.
---
It just goes to illustrate how killer sided discussions are and how disliking something turns into "survivor sided" very quickly.
---
Gamer
---
My life is filled with bruh moments.
---
Thanks man
---
Funn ey
---
That's what I do as killer, if the survivors really do manage to piss me off, I just put on youtube and say screw it till they leave lol.
---
Just ask to farm with the survivors.
---
My favourite response
---
They are reworking it tho..
---
&gt;Strongest perk in the game
---
Sir, may I inform you that D-strike has been reworked
---
i love how trapper even swung to signal the start 😂 that was awesome. did he just drop you all by the door?
---
Don't worry, she has been executed for her crimes
---
You don't have to play her to get Ruin. 
---
Plus, most people have it unlocked already.
---
Winning as two people might be a much, I don't know you would implement that. That being said I don't mind giving survivors more tools if it meant that the game was just slightly slower. They are some teams I won't even MEME against cause they are too quick with gens and I get to meme for like 2 minutes. Super fun.
---
Btw I'm also not saying the game should be balanced around the 1% cause I realize most people are just average t the game. I'm just saying that the gen problem is a real problem.
---
Still the strongest perk in the game.
---
are you this man
---
Then tell me how much fun it is to get farmed and moried without any counterplay?!
---
not feeeeengo meeeen
---
I also recommend Give Me the Night by Des Rocs if you feel confident in your “getting chased” skills
---
Dude the show was at least 8 years old
---
Not Tru3 name any names, of course.
---
Ghost Face and Miss Piggy
---
Just stick it dude their not even close
---
As soon as the hatch closes the vast majority of if games are over. The doors are in spitting distance of each other and you can just moonwalk as you check them. Very few maps force hard checking if doors. And there is no thought behind the decision, you just close the hatch and check the doors, it's an easy kill.
---
I'd like to see this fixed/changed, as it's currently not fun and feels pretty dog shit on survivor.
---
You do understand that it's called a test beta right?
---
How do you think it is for survivors? It's the exact same. Iridescant iridescant gold silver or trip iridescant bronze to just bare minimum pip for a red rank survivor.
---
&gt; So it just shows what was clear from the begging if you play both sides, on average killers are doing super well and only organized swf can stand up to them.
---
Alternatively, given the previous data dump in May that showed the game being survivor sided at purple ranks and above:
---
Dedicated servers are a dogshit, failed experiment, and the added lag from them objectively favors killers.
---
Seriously. It's frustrating to see how little people analyze information.
---
Character from outlast, Sebastian Castellanos from evil within, Jason and Jarvis

no thats only if you stand up or let go when a skill check triggers. they dont always trigger

This is a fallacy of an argument. There are huge loops that can be run without balanced landing including the ones on haddonfield. The loops are broken not the perk. Nerfing the perk isn't going to change anything. Not to mention the simple fact that out of 20+ maps balanced landing can only be effectively used on 5 of them. Most of which requires a map offering to go to because map rotation rng is total shit in this game and even with the offering, you're never guaranteed to go to the map variant you want. You can play the Macmillan estate offering for iron works and end up in sheltered woods instead. There's literally nothing wrong with balanced landing as it currently stands. They just want killers to get free hits and free downs and are literally blaming a perk instead of bad map design.
---
got em good
---
The last stats they released had hatch escapes(I think) and SWF escape percentages.
---
gud

Springwoods Golden Toolbox is under a bench is a grassy tile

I can't even count how often I've been called a "nazi" or "nazi pig" just because I'm from Germany lol

I cant find the notes on changes to the pig, does anyone know what they're doing to her?

I would say Michael or Freddy, but definitely wait till Friday for the sale
---
This is why I run detective hunch and cleanse them totems. My favorite save was in the corn field, started cleansing the last dull totem before NOED activated. Right after a person got downed is when I finished the cleanse and we rescue the poor sap and everyone survived. Now I always hunt down then totems, get the bold points I can't get for infinite loops :D
---
Their shitty matchmaking system has far more to do with queue times than anything with population or players on either side.
---
The archives should have lots of players doing random things on both sides, but we don't really see any of that since their last "fix."
---
Check the last stats they released, it had this info. Only one I remember is 4man is less the 5% of games
---
This is why you should always run tenacity.
---
Oh my calling me a true fan. Honestoy couldnt despise him more. But imagine thinking sloppy is bad becuase true uses it. Yeah im done

Thank you man

it shouldn't be easy to get insta downs

*Queenie Perk: Bitchcraft*
---
Bitchcraft starts with 1/2/3 tokens.
---
When a Killer's basic attack would put you into the dying state, Bitchcraft consumes a token. You do not go into the dying state and instead one healthy survivor becomes injured, screaming and revealing their location.
---
Bitchcraft has a 40/30/20 second cooldown.
---
*"I ain't nobody's protein shake, bitch!"*
---
So has nurse, she’s still the strongest killer. Decisive is still the strongest perk, even after the “rework”
---
Yeah, no mither is pretty poopy rn. This would be a nice way to make it suck less. 
---
I just played with a guy running it and he played well but since he was a one hitter he was the only one to get killed. The killer was pretty bad at chasing.
---
I'm a both main as well and say both sides are babies lol
---
That would in fact make it a more useful perk, and wouldnt make it super powerful in any way. Good suggestion
---
i bet the devs fucking regret this chapter so much, i think if they could go back they just would have never released it even if it was done
---
I find bubba is the easiest to get 4ks with, not sure if thats cuz I'm only like rank 15 or what,  but I dont think hes as bad as people make him out to be. I run ruin, bbq and noed and I tend to do well with him
---
I play killer and survivor at red ranks and you can’t put to much weight in these graphs because you’re automatically assuming that red rank survivor = master at the game. Even red ranks is filled to the brim with bad survivors (mostly due to it being too easy to pip / too hard to depip) 
---
9/10 games at rank 1 are winnable as killer because most survivor make enough mistakes for you to capitalize on. but then you have those 1 out of 10 games where you’re up against 4 god mode survivors and you feel powerless lol. 
---
so yeah these graphs only show killers are stronger if you assume red rank survivor = a survivor who has mastered the game.
---
I for this, nice work
---
I almost got that fucking trophy yesterday, and then jake became magnetically attaches to every fucking locker. Even if I took him to a corner of the map and dropped and picked him up until he got out, he just went straight for a locker. Fuck that achievement
---
Not to mention the add ons
---
Survivor: Don't worry, the phantasm traps make a loud scream and a husk of hag pops up when you trip them
---
Rusty Shackles: lol
---
Survivor: Don't worry, if you step in a trapper's trap, you can escape easily
---
Honing Stone: lol
---
Survivor: Don't worry, Clown's tonic only slows you down, it doesn't hurt you
---
Red Head's Pinky: lol
---
Survivor: As long as we don't cleanse, Plague cant get her power
---
Iridescent Seal: lol
---
Survivor: Don't worry,  we can speed though a couple gens before Freddy can even teleport to them
---
Swing Chains and Outdoor rope: lol
---
I would say that too. But usually killers don’t cry that often. Survivors literally cry if u bring noed or ebony mori these days.
---
Edit: Apparently slugging and using hex: ruin is toxic now as well :).
---
And another edit: I would say there’s some baby killers as well but there’s way way way more survivor baby’s than killer baby’s. Like I would say so my self if I face a swf using green tool boxes with fast add ons and proof thyself. That gets a gen done in like 10 sec not even kidding watch TrU3’s video when he uses that tool box. That’s a thing I would cry about but it wouldn’t make me a baby in my opinion. And survivors bitch about a mori? Like fr wtf.
---
Then it should be a safe assumption that they need to fight harder survivors to bring the rate to something more reasonable? ie: make it harder for survivors to get red ranks.
---
suprisingly people play legion a lot more than i thought
---
Tru3 has an ego, clickbaits, not that great at the game, and is constantly being sucked off.
---
entitys left hand i dont think is 2 bad, at least compared to Hexy and tru3
---
tru3 trys to make statments on how spirit is balanced, but its such a shit show but people just constantly suck him off even though he goes back on his words and contradicts what he says constantly for example
---
If it looks like the game is broken, definitely - need to check both my net and for posts. But instead of just breaking, DBD let me sit while waiting for a match that was never coming. I readied up, waited, searched again, etc.
---
That's not something I can distinguish from regular wait times, and because it was a Sunday morning it seemed plausible that few were playing. Just needed to be patient.
---
I don't think I deserve anything, but at the same time there was no indication for me that something was actually borked and that I should go do something else.

Using a strategy to complete your objective is not toxic, it’s trying to complete your objective.
---
it literally does matter. Literally killing 3/4 survivors a game out of 1000 matches =/= 3/4 survivors out of 5000 matches.
---
If we're going on a per game basis, that would also mean Ghostface, Trapper, Hag, Doctor, Pig, Legion, Wraith, Plague, Bubba, and Myers are all equivalent in effectiveness since we aren't taking into account how often they are played then, or that Nurse is overall one of the least effective killers at red ranks, even though she is just played substantially less right now.
---
This is a common statistical mistake ("Survivorship Bias")
---
*By definition* red ranks contains only killers that can maintain that kill rate. Anything less *and you drop out of red ranks*, so it doesn't tell you anything about balance other than "there is a group of players that can maintain that kill rate".
---
I knew it, I’ve always disagreed that nurse was the strongest and spirit was second, according to most tier list. Confirms spirit is strongest
---
“You are a genuine dick sucker!”
---
I thought it was a Freddy skin for a second.
---
Nah, no efficiency is lost, one charge is always one charge, gens have 80 charges in em, if you have a toolbox with 40 charges and double up on a generator with someone it'll eat the whole toolbox perfectly (barring skill checks)
---
Especially when BHVR says "2 kills is a win, guys!" but in the next breath announces your depip for a 2k game. 
---
Also, basing these stats on kills rather than hook states consumed is kinda silly imo. There can be a game in which I get 2 hooks and both die first hook, and a game where I get 10 hooks with the two survivors both being on death hook, and BHVR weighs them the same.
---
Oni OP, please nerf
---
People don't know how to interpret them at even the most basic levels. It's frustrating. 
---
E.g. the red ranked stat is a perfect example of  "Survivorship Bias" in statistics.
---
i see so many of these post and i have to comment the same thing over and over.
---
Annoying. Does. Not. Equal. OP.
---
Fuck clown, i hate playing against him and the people who play him are assholes most of the time, but he sucks dick
---
Lol you think she’s extremely easy than you obviously don’t play her often. Please don’t talk if your point of view is watching pro gamers or playing survivor
---
shadowborn gang
---
You know, that’s make for a wonderful Claudette skin.
---
yes
---
I broke a Hexposed last night and just stayed on the freedy mattress waiting for my punishment. Mr Clown was actually gentle.
---
Quality meme
---
I thought it slowed down because it was gonna hit.
---
Yea, but that doesn't even always work out as intended. The mvp could be only doing gens and never get the chance to do a save or chase at the proper time because noobs are rushing hooks and taking a 4 person tour around the map with the killer. So because they were reacting in the smartest way possible to their dummy teammates actions and picking up slack got no points except for objectives. 
---
As you implied, there is flexibility for the survivor team, any individual survivor can pretty much do what they want and long as they get some gens done and do some healing,take some heat at some point in the trial (obviously relying on the rest of the team to make the effort as well). For killer it is far more rigid, hinder the survivors in a specific way. Find and catch all of them, let them go, find and catch all of them again, meanwhile prevent them from finishing objectives quickly and prevent healing. That's a source of frustration for me, I /want/ to let generators go sometimes, especially on big maps so I can focus on specific areas but we're penalized for it with the gatekeeper medal.
---
Looks like someone isn't good enough to beat a Billy, ouch.
---
No mither is a perk to challenge yourself with. That's all it ever was and does not need a buff
---
Yeah there's a lot of survivor sided crap goin on with the other killers involved with the chapter, oni is just broken rn lol
---
Honestly I gotta wonder if that guy plays the same DBD I do.
---
For the record, I'm a Killer main (Ghost Face/Myers/Freddy main. Also like Pig.). I speak from someone who's been in red ranks for a while. Hillbilly has been an utter nuisance since launch. He's the only Killer, apart from Nurse, to dominate in high-rank. Worse still, he destroys at EVERY skill level, because he braindead easy.
---
Imagine try harding at rank 20 cause you cant win without everything stacked in youre corner?
---
again, I point out that we can see that their numbers are a lie to begin with. so numbers claiming 3-mans are rare dont mean anything.
---
_bruh_
---
Things like this happen its not a big deal.   I just hope they extend the battlepass one day to make up for it.
---
pips shouldn't be solely based on how many survivors you kill. The entire emblem system came out to address that inconsistency, since if you completely disregard BP and any care for actually having an engaging match, it isn't hard to actually get 2 or 3 kills as killer against even a semi competent team.
---
I died with an erection.
---
Probably wouldn't rely on these stats to much considering people like to dc and kill themselves on hook a lot
---
Too lenient.
---
2k means they got out the gates, and likely means you only got 1 kill in the actual match and only got your second from facecamping in the endgame. 
---
You need to have people depip when they fail.
---
A draw shouldn't be a thing.
---
Who actually sits dicects this shit
---
How is clown the weakest?
---
Billy takes much more practice to learn than new Freddy, and even then he's perfectly fine. People have never bitched about him up until recently, and he's never changed.
---
This^ it's the matchmaking changes
---
Yeh I'm just adding some discussion to it :D chill
---
I almost couldn't see baby yoda because of the text
---
Run Inner Strength and you get a free heal out of it that you can cash in any time you're injured for a fraction of the time of a normal heal to boot. That perk is some insane time economy.
---
If you scroll down i literally said this? Oh what? You assumed i was an ignorant survivor main? Oh this proves youre the one sided ignorant one? Yeah. Foxed
---
Also for the record cant remember the last time a killer was relying on other people. Typically they cant be hit by the survivor. Just because youre a rank 20 that cant patrol gens doesnt mean shit and makes you look cringy
---
I cannot see claudette holy fuck
---
Killing yourself on hook when NOED activates is the right thing to do. Change my mind.
---
oni needs tweaks, but not a huge nerf.
---
he def is going to be a killer i wont enjoy playing against.
---
I'm so mad that i'm going to go out of my way to send you hatemail to tell you i'm not mad, you're mad.
---
I just imagined you explaining this to a stranger on the bus
---
It's doable, Nurse is not as hard on console as people make her out to be. I love playing as Nurse on console. I'm a trophy hunter and only need Skilled Huntress, Left for Dead, and Taking One for the Team. The Nurse achievements are achievable without farming
---
Awwwwwh! Him so cute!!!!!!!
---
Pretty sure everyone read it different than you. Maybe, just maybe, you should go back to cLaSs.
---
Deliverance + DS
---
I know the last stats were really good. These ones kind of suck. And it was ~7% for 4man SWF. The only problem is they released the stats at a poor time, and it was only over like a 3 day window and the rank 1 stats were skewed for survivors. Id like a little more than what they did that time with some of my suggestions here as well as have it over a longer period of time
---
Ranges from about 30 to 80, with an average of around 50. Don’t think I’ve seen yellow or red since dedicated servers released. However, queue times have gotten much worse as both survivor and killer.
---
To the children of Reddit,
---
My comment was meant to imply that the meme simply was lazily made and was not funny.
---
Murdoc out
---
Safety pipping isn't a bad thing though. People paint it as a loss, but it technically isn't, if your goal is to ALWAYS pip, or hell even double pip that shouldn't be happening unless you're severely mismatched with people highly out of your skill range.
---
I also think people seldom don't take into account the rate at which the 4 survivors are pipping or not. There's no feasible way for all 4 survivors to be pipping in a close match.
---
First time playing me and my friend asked the random in our group if it matters which character we start with. He said "No"...... Now I have an Ace that I abandoned at level 30 and never went back to
---
Maybe so, or maybe people are giving kneejerk reactions because I wasn't nice.
---
Hook of course, as well as a killer.
---
Be wary that's not 100 percent correct  ptb said Kate's biker was shards as well . Too many of those are all shards, I can guarantee some won't be .
---
Is that like a leader of Lockers?
---
"I'm not against anything lgbt"
---
\- literally doesn't like pride cosmetic lmao
---
Apparently not BVHR.
---
Having survivors together early game is actually a bad thing. If a killer finds more than 1 survivor, it’s 1 or more extra survivor being pressured instead of just a solo survivor.
---
Multiple survivors on the last gen? Yeah that’s an advantage
---
LMAO I'm sorry
---
it's so fun when it happens- dbd can be toxic but sometimes it really makes my day
---
Bruh billy be the most balanced of them all..come on
---
/uj unless its heterosexuality
---
we were wetting ourselves!
---
Been there lol
---
That’s a good point. But don’t the stats show that red rank killers are on average doing better than other ranks? I understand that it’s likely because they are much better at the game and so, like all games, they are the top players. But doesn’t it also suggest that red rank survivors are not equal? Like if red rank survivors were equal to non red we should see similar numbers right? Especially when all rank stats on some killers have rates which would qualify for red ranks?
---
Rip coldwind maps in the next update
---
I just did copy and paste and slightly edited the words lmao IQ of a McNugget.
---
What do you mean sorry ?
---
straight people show it off all the time ?????
---
yes!! we were so happy he did! he took three of us down at the gate, and then when he saw us lined up he brought the last guy over
---
My sister has told me once that I give her anxiety every time I stay on a gen when the killer is coming
---
what. of course it's still camping. the definition of camping doesn't change just because another survivor is near the hook.
---
Mathieu: [reads this post] Billy, come here
---
Billy: [comes]
---
Mathieu: [takes chainsaw from Billy's hands and replaces with broom stick] ok now, go play
---
Billy:😢
---
it really made my day!
---
Feel free! :)
---
My very first game of Dead By Daylight was on Lery’s Memorial Institute against a Ghost Face. The first time I was hooked I did exactly that but escaped on my first try and thought it was a game mechanic to just get off. My friends were freaking out while I had no idea what just happened. I was the lucky one.
---
All they gotta do is force doors to spawn on opposite ends of the map and it becomes fair. But yeah, when they spawn on the same side its impossible.
---
I understand now, and I edited my comment to reflect that. I have some questions in another comment that I could use some help understanding. Statistics aren’t easy to me and I appreciate your help.
---
You have som valid aspects, but I have to disagree on certain things.
---
I never had an issue with aura reading perks for killers. As a killer, the fun part is not wandering around and wondering where the f\*ck the Blendette hides but the chases. Chases are the core-part in this game.
---
I highly agree on the slowdown perks tho. They are so strong if you stack them. Had a Legion with sloppy, thana, ruin and pop. Add ons were both increased mending time. This was so incredible boring to play against. I wish there would be some kind of rule. "only 1/2 slow down perks allowed"
---
Survivor perks, items and add ons tend to be weaker, because there are 4 players that could take them. Remember the old BNP? Insta-gen. Take 4 and you're basically done with the game. Heck, even just one was wild. Some with the syringe. They were way to strong if there were multiple. On the other side tho, I fully agree that there are really strong add ons for killers. OP ones. And they are slowly getting changed aswell. But it takes time. And yeah- mori is too strong too in my opinion.
---
Awesome
---
None of the killers need any nerfs right now but a lot of them could use buffs.
---
&gt; I die over 75% of my games as survivor.
---
If you're dying that much then according to these statistics you're an outlier, even at red ranks.
---
No map pressure
---
Lets look at the facts...
---
Instadowns:
---
Myers = Needs to delay the chase to stalk in order to earn the instadown. Time limited.
---
Ghostface = Needs to stalk without being spotted to earn the instadown. Time limited.
---
Leatherface = Slows down while charging, so needs to get close initially then has a limited window to pull it off. Has a massive time wasting tantrum if he hits a wall, or a lengthy cooldown if he misses.
---
Billy = Can casually walk behind a survivor charging it and lining it up. Has a minor cooldown if he misses or hits a wall. No slowdown, no stalking, can swing them for the entire trial at minimal cost.
---
Mobility:
---
Spirit = Users her ability to cross the map at roughly 176% speed. Can not see survivors while phasing. Once arrived at her destination, needs to wait 15 seconds for her power to recharge which leaves her as a 110% speed M1 killer.
---
Freddy = Can teleport to a gen giving survivors a lengthy heads up via blood spurting from the gen. After teleporting goes on a long cooldown before it can be used again.
---
Demogorgon = Has to place a portal where he wants to travel. Then has to place another portal as an entry point. Portals can be destroyed by survivors.
---
Hillbilly = Sprints at 230% speed across the map in seconds leaving survivors little time to react. Can instantly turn around and sprint across back to where he came from or elsewhere. Has no cooldown on his power.
---
So in conclusion not only does Hillbilly have the BEST instadown and the BEST mobility, he’s the only killer to have an instadown and mobility at the same time.
---
HilLbIlLy iS tHe mOSt BalaNcEd kIlLeR
---
He said he doesn't know who made it since it was rip from a wallpaper app.
---
Yes but to be fair the bs is indiscriminate! Sometimes you can tell it's bullshit that the hatchet didn't hit and sometimes it's bullshit that it did! Balanced!
---
You were the one that posted it. Dont post low iq things if you dont want low iq answers.
---
Isn't that haddonfield?
---
Lmao you wont be able to access them for another 100+ hours anyways, thanks to the grind. Enjoy the default perks.
---
Maybe it was intentional all along 😳👌
---
Please just stop bitching at any decent killer.. Seriously if every killer gets nerfed one after another the games as good as dead.
---
Edit: spelling
---
That’s why BT is clutch. It seems like whenever I take it off, I coincidentally face a facecamping killer
---
More could use buffs than nerfs. I agree. However, Billy has evaded the nerf hammer for too long. He has virtually no drawbacks for his potential effectiveness.
---
Since most of the killer challenges in the archive are Trapper based doesn't that rather corrupt the results of killer popularity?
---
I can’t even find gens the on these god forsaken maps
---
Usually the heartbeat should be enough for detecting killers?
---
Survivor add-ons should be weaker because they can take four at a time
---
Aw heck you're right. I got my maps mixed. I'll personally hop into a swf and look for it real quick
---
I know, when I heard this I thought they’re Clowning around
---
This is the underlying fact of all discussions with killer mains I've ever had.
---
If it doesn't promote a 4k, it's bad. If it allows it promoted escape, it's bad. If they don't like it, it's survivor sided.
---
These stats show that the game is far from survivor sided, and killers are currently performing extremely well overall. And a few maps killers have been saying are survivor sided are in fact heavily killer sided lol.
---
The game was adi to be balanced around 2ks not 4ks, and slowly people who only play killer have complained their way into this being the norm. It's extremely validating honestly. Too bad it won't change the mentality of the community, stop people parroting streamers, or stop the devs from catering to these people.
---
as a main killer, i hate you.
---
as a normal person, that play was awesome, congrats bud
---
Survivors don't need to escape to pip or even double pip, whereas a killer in red ranks would be hard pressed to pip with just 2 kills on average.
---
It's good so idk
---
quick and quiet along with the nancy one where you can see the scratchmarks, can both be used to try trick the killer, so make fake scratchmarks and then jump in a locker, heck use head on if you’re feeling spicy
---
I think more Killers need buffs, actually. But when something is so intrinsically busted, I take notice, just like Spirit and Nurse.
---
Then how do you explain that all killers except Nurse have above average kill rate for all Ranks?
---
0:35 and then the Nea teabags you as you get morid
---
Lockers can be useful against killers like Doctor. But they leave you very vulnerable. Because you can be grabbed or hit when leaving the locker or found in it. If you want to hide, just crouch and put your head down. I'm not exactly an expert of being immersed. It's not my playstyle. I know at grey and yellow ranks a lot of people hide in lockers so I think killers learn to expect it.
---
Lockers at this point are very obvious to search. The only good time to really use them at this point is to hide you aura from BBQ and Chili. The only perk that counters locker usage is Iron Maiden, but it’s rarely used. Huntress is also a bad killer to hide in lockers against as they use them to reload, so they hit them very often.
---
Also note that killer’s instinct (used by mostly by Legion and Ghostface) will still work in lockers and that infectious fright will also make you scream even if in a locker.
---
Ok ok. My only complaint with Pennywise is that he's the Literal Embodiment of all things negative in our universe &amp; maybe even cross dimensional. How the hell is the Entity going to be allowed to control or persuade a being to play it's little game that by all means seems like a way higher force than itself? I'll still be up to play as IT whether it's Tim Curry or Bill Skarsgard (most likely) but just that factor alone kinda pulls me away from the immersion into the lore y'know.
---
Normally I don't listen to music because the audio is so important, but now that chase cues have been taken away I find myself doing it a lot. Mostly hard rock/metalcore/gothic metal. (Ice Nine Kills, New Year's Day, Motionless in White, Stitched up Heart, Blackbriar). INK even has songs about the films some of the characters are from that really get me in the mood for DbD even when I'm not playing.
---
You're actually brain dead. I copied and pasted your post, edited the word killer to survivor and posted it. I don't know how to explain it any better you actual brainlet.
---
I have never blendetted in my life. I would just like to go around a corner and outsmart the killer by rotating around a rock instead of him coming within 30 meters of me and i scream.
---
Right when I got the game bbq and chili was in the shrine of secrets. I asked was it really worth it?....
---
No problem. I really wish they'd release more data or none at all. These small tidbits are *really* easy to misinterpret if you aren't familiar with some of the basics around data analysis.
---
Yeah, it was my first time making a meme, and uuuuhhh, we're not doing it that way again
---
This is so sad can we nerf the Pig
---
Well if your injured they can hear your grunts and moans and if the killer has a God tier headset they can hear your breathing when not injured
---
Just don’t hide and his power doesn’t help him.
---
He's not necessarily the weakest, its just that he is not often played by people who are skilled/experienced with him. These stats leave a lot of room for interpretation.
---
I was lucky enough to watch other youtubers play the game first, so I knew not to struggle
---
Was playing Meyers, closest hook was on a hill. Looked around after hooking, immediately spotted an outline, went and grabbed them. "Camping trash! :'(" People are fucking stupid.
---
It was green ranks on console and I was using Feng Min for a daily ritual; I don’t normally use her.
---
What perk build do you use? I got a perfect trapper game last week as well, i love trapper and always wanna try out different perks
---
Those chases take years to finish and 9 times out of 10, the survivors would’ve finished 3 gens if you do end up downing them
---
Also the Nancy perk that heals you requires a locker.
---
&gt; and these survivors had around 50% survival rate.
---
Actually, iirc the survival rate for 4-man swfs at red ranks was about 65%.
---
Oh damn, that underwater generator pic is yours? 
---
Sorry I didn't credit you, I just took a random picture of a dbd match from google.
---
I don't even really care since I've been asleep, but what? If something with their game, *their product*, is wrong in it and simply isn't working for the people have have paid for it.
---
 Then yes, it's right to complain. I'm not going to lick the corporate shoe and go "Oh well it must've just been as annoying for them" because that's irrelevant. So is every bug, issue, or anything in the game.
---
The killer just had a stroke
---
In what way was she ever op?
---
He ended up disconnecting later XD
---
*how a legion player feels when they miss a frenzy hit*
---
Probably not. The experience at different ranks is so vast it's like a brand new world. It's two totally valid points of view but both are ignorant of the other's experience.
---
I wish the Devs would find better ways to balance the upper end though. I understand why they're balancing for green ranks (majority of player base) but it's frustrating when you're being ignored.
---
Mostly perks. Some perks like "save the best for last" rewards you for not hitting your obsession and loses you tokens if you do hit them.
---
I'm not sure. We don't really have enough data to know what it "means".
---
Yep
---
The new killer seems good against toxic survivors because they get more blood if you crouch
---
Chapter 15: cats and hats
---
Its a shitpost my man.
---
You can still loop it just watch Ussylis’s video on it
---
hitting your obsession with perks like STBFL will cause you to lose tokens
---
Sounds about right for the veterans to go off when the noob kobes
---
Correct
---
There should be a skill tree that shows all the perks if different categories and how to unlock them.
---
Why should the most uncounterable part of the game not be given a counter. If you are farmed off a hook with a killer who has a mori, you’re fucked.
---
Literally my 3rd game ever as trapper, just levelled him up for the 4 traps in one game lmao. I had NOED, Thrilling Tremors, Brutal strength and BBQ, all level 2. My trapper is only level 21 lol.
---
Depending on how the killer plays, I’ll go back. If they kicked everyone’s ass, I’m leaving. If they’re just camping, I’ll try to find the totem and go for the save.
---
Thank you! Sick of seeing this racist fucks face. 
---
Insane to me how he still has fans.
---
Hey, uhh, I think Kate wants to have a word with you.
---
Oh, and how could I forget *Ash Williams*.
---
Those damn prayer beads
---
Ho is that stupid? The issue is the emblem system is still shit, and people complain constantly if they don't get more and more kills.
---
These graphs show that killers are far from under powered though.
---
You won't "easily depip" unless you're literally one-hooking everyone
---
If youre going to look at these stats at face value to show billy is over performing, then by that logic nurse is the 3rd weakest killer in the game.
---
Doesn't that debuff only happen if no survivors are within range of the hook? Could give away position.
---
The only time my ass goes in a locker is if I'm running "Inner Strength," and need a little love.
---
They probably say that because they have the perk Save the best for last which makes you recover from hitting survivors faster the more you hit them. When you hit your obsession you lose some of your recovery speed
---
I love this perk so much. Much more than I probably should!
---
Ghostface is one of my favorites to verse tbh as long as they don’t camp w their undetectable status I love the surprise element, no way does he need a nerf
---
I just tried Hag, and it was a so much better experience!
---
I mostly take other existing perks and use certain elements of them.
---
Cut the engine has a generator from corrupt intervention, Rip and tear has an arm from self care etc.
---
As for the other icons I searched for silhouettes of things, like a sharks jaws. 
---
I hope that helps :)
---
Same i run it on most of my builds has saved me a few times.
---
At the very least make it reduce grunts of pain by 100%
---
Didn't know Marco played dbd.
---
I get what you’re saying but you can’t expect every game to run flawlessly since release, there are going to be issues, and there is no point in complaining like some people were. Sure, get annoyed by all means, but some people were ranting about how Behaviour is useless and how the fact that it happened on a Sunday was not good enough, when it wasn’t really Behaviours fault.
---
These stats are proof that killers aren't the problem, its swf
---
It's my job to save you, and I will stay no matter what perks the killer has, if you're on the hook, I will save you, or I will die trying.
---
Where is the fun in running away ?
---
Well most killers just M1 to directly make survivors lose one health state. Trying to M1 as  Huntress without hatchets is bad, since she’s slower so you’re going to take longer to be able to swing at them.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e1of7s/hey_behaviour_there_seems_to_be_a_bug_i_didnt_get/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That happened to me when I was playing as Nurse. There were two survivors working on a gen and I grabbed one at the same moment that the gen exploded. I went to the hook thinking I was carrying the survivor but they werent on my shoulder. I had to walk around the map like I was carrying a survivor for the rest of the match. They all escaped of course.
---
Winning as two people all match is really two much.But,when you are the last two, usually is the most awkward face as you cannot do anything,as doing gens will reveal your position.
---
Indeed,it is really easy to 2k with tunneling and camping but it is counterintuitive to the pip system,as usually it is easier to pip with gen stall (so i usually take safety pip with only one kill).
---
If they play efficiently without taking unesserary risks, running at tiles and doing gens,they aren't usually a lot you can really do as killer, and it so annoying to just seeing survivors keeping you in the loop without being able to do much and gens pop it the worst feeling.
---
Actually,i feel than survivors have more things to get rewarded ,chases,gens,hex,traps disarms,stealth, altruism etc. And the killer has only killing and a the rest of ranking system is very vague.
---
Some perks are obsession related. Save the best for last as play with your food requires that you avoid hitting your obsession to get stacks.
---
for me personally a 3 dead 1 escape via exit gates, feels like a good game for both sides tbh. the killer did his job well and so did the survivors. this imo is what i consider a tie game. if 2 or more escape via exit gates, i feel i lost. if none escape via exit gates, i feel i won. if anyone escapes via a hatch that i didn't let them have, i feel the devs beat me
---
I think Myers takes that spot, in my opinion. His base power is amazingly well done- it represents the character well, and it’s a ton of fun to use as play against. His addons are by no means overpowered, but can be extremely powerful if you can pull them off- Tombstone+Tuft takes forever to do, and you’re at a severe disadvantage for the whole game until you get to that point- but if you can pull it off, you become probably the most dangerous killer in the game.
---
Yeah. I agree with you, they probably wanted to take a break from the game, just like the players. xD
---
Fr? If they nerf Billy we riot. He is literally the most balanced killer in the game.
---
Survivor: Balanced Landing. I don't even care about which map, I'll happily roll the dice on shitty BL maps.
---
I just don't like any other Exhaustion perks. Dead Hard is extremely dependent on latency if you need to escape that hit and it barely extends chases. 
---
I can't seem to time Sprint Burst well enough for it to be useful. Head On is a meme. Lithe is ok.
---
Killer: Ruin
---
If you're a killer you should know the logic behind these stats are incredibly flawed in every way.
---
for example not giving SWF stats
---
Making 50% 2 kills when that is a depip in red rank
---
The fact that there is nothing saying who/what percent of killers stay in red rank
---
Matter of fact if you look at both charts pig has 65 in all ranks, but is not even charted in red ranks proving alone how unbalanced and broken ranking system makes killers
---
Tap revving doesn't help mobility.
---
You have to play mind games to be an effective Freddy, tricking Survivors out with his teleport. You also have to predict where Survivors will go, since you're limited on snares/pallets. Freddy has ZERO insta-down attacks, as well.
---
Given how without BL there are multiple long loops that really are damn near close to infinites thanks to those fucking fences?
---
 People still will, it'll be just as annoying
---
So you would agree that she is weaker than bubba as per this chart?
---
I like how people says we need to see survivor's perks comparison in red ranks. What? All purple ranks have only meta perks,let alone red ranks. Mostly, a killer with/without noed or ruin would be intresting. Also,if the matches are mostly 0-1k or 3-4k.
---
Have any console games added availability for mouse and keyboard yet?
---
Thats why I stopped playing claudette 
---
Blendettes must die
---
Honestly i dont care about survivors complain. I dont camp but its just funny when they get pissed
---
In an enclosed space, it absolutely works. I speak from experience.
---
Happens literally every time I hook someone. That's is why the "Just pressure gens" response makes me so unhappey
---
You took a duke in the locker?
---
Small Game is just as good!
---
Same with DC,but for yourself.
---
Because BL was only part of the problem on haddonfield. Fences introduce multiple giant loops alone, that can combo into other smaller pallet loops so close together
---
*Laughs in Monitor + Abuse and Shadowborn*
---
Billy doesn't need changes because he adheres to the rules of the game. A lot of people seem to not understand why spirit and nurse needed to be changed. It wasnt because she was good, it was because you literally could not counter them in a chase because they don't play dead by daylight and there was no fun involved for survivors. Billy's map pressure encourages chases, and he is an M1 killer against decent survivors since you have to be right next to a survivor in a dead zone to get a chainsaw hit. He's probably the most fitting killer for a game like this.
---
this isnt a shit post, just bc you put the tag as shit post it doesnt mean it is
---
at least put /s or somthing
---
Exactly.  She has a high skill curve/ceiling so for people just picking her up or not used to her mechanics, she might not perform as well as others.  But once you get good at judging distance with her blinks, reading Survivor movements, etc. she's borderline OP.
---
Nurse mains
---
I once played Trapper on Badham, and the basement was under the school.
---
Absolutely devilish.
---
r/croppingishard
---
Apparently, at the moment. This is accumulated data from BHVR. Nurse was really hurt in her last rework.
---
I honestly can't tell if you're joking or serious. I've gotta have a look at these forums. Haha
---
Well I’m damn sure not running T1 Whispers or T1 Spies From The Shadows.
---
&gt; regardless of what the devs claim
---
Damn that is Trump-levels of fact ignoring
---
I’m a legion main and I can say this is true
---
Damn thats amazing ! Great job dude !
---
“politics” lmao
---
I’m rank 7 killer and I run noed on all my matches besides this one time I decided I didn’t need it, I got gen rushed
---
I stand by what I said lol we can have different opinions we don't have to agree. I believe the killer should be able to kill the survivors more often than not. If survivors are able to consistently survive then they aren't at the right rank.
---
Better yet, take the chain off his saw. He probably wouldn't notice.
---
Aww that sucks. Why didn’t  you stop and let him pass you so he could’ve took it. That’s what I always do when I see the shell incoming.
---
because im not gay so im a homophobe
---
that's legit what he was almost doing when lunging lol
---
A million times this. Negates way too much. Second least favorite is doctor because all the screaming is just annoying.
---
Nobody is denying the maps are bad, but BL helps create exploits in their bad map design
---
??? That isnt very concrete sorry hahah are there examples I might have encountered?
---
The wiki [says] (https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Movement_Speeds) 92% which seems right to me. Is that wrong?
---
This is the stuff I wanna see on this subreddit
---
Mori on second down is just as unbalanced tbh, just like key
---
Clutch play!
---
The memes here warm my heart as compared to how garbage the game actually is
---
Solo is yeah I agree. SWF is still easy. So killers are kind of in a middle ground.
---
Would Thing 1 &amp; Thing 2 be used in the cats power as well? 
---
What about all the other cats hiding in the cats hat?
---
Ahaha! Thank you so much.
---
Repost
---
Oh, it’s real. Sadly it’s not here because devs can’t figure out how to do the head+body since they are separate cosmetic pieces. Been teased by the devs for years now.

Ah, sorry. It was the game.

Hey, a C+ is passing and counts for my degree!
---
11.5% really isn’t much. That means if I play 5 games I’ve got a slightly less than half chance of encountering at least 1 spirit. That ain’t bad.
---
I wish I had that perk!
---
That’s fair.
---
I play him and I am pretty good not the best. He is a very good killer when used right
---
No the most beautiful model face wise is hands down Jane
---
That's bullshit. Play plague, watch vomit splatter over survivors. Watch them flail and groan from it, then run away uninfected. Then tell me the killer gets authority.
---
*But Bruce Campbell*
---
[BHVR's statistics today](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/) show that the game on PC is now significantly killer-favored at all ranks. This is in stark contrast to [the data from May](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests) showing that Survivors escaped more often than not starting at rank 8. While there are other factors like the release of EGC, the single biggest one that has personally impacted my Survivor gameplay experience (and generally made me stop playing the game as a whole) is the release of Dedicated Servers.
---
I know others have experienced this as well, so I wanted to explain to people who may not exactly know what's going on with servers.
---
I agree, and I see the trap I fell into. I think this data does reflect though that kill rates are much higher than BHVRs 50% balance mark they said they are aiming for.
---
Ohhhh you got downvoted hard for your well reasoned, respectful opinion.  The only thing you did wrong was disagree with the majority.
---
No I don't
---
Yep.
---
If I choose to play a weaker killer or off-meta perks as survivor, that’s on me. I can’t expect my opponent(s) to play less than optimally just for my benefit.
---
And then you realize there are only like 4-6 perks that are actually viable. :(
---
I'm serious, checked discussions when I noticed the issue and first one I saw "do you think we should be compensated" with a description about it being down for hours and its ruining Sunday, how the community deserve blood points or x2 or x3 blood points next weekend
---
The problem with Corrupt Intervention is that it doesn't stop survivors from getting on gens, it just shuffles them around. Ruin, while it might not last all that long, still gets 1-2 survivors off gens hunting for it, which is where it gets its value. Ruin only needs to last as long as my first chase for it to have been worth it for me, and from then on I just let my applied pressure do the job.
---
Oh ok I thought  you had something against ghostfaces
---
"toxically save their toxic buddy" LOL are you okay?
---
Maybe because it’s harder to get a 4K on those maps? Doctor’s, Stranger Things, and Meat Plant all have their doors spawn opposite each other.
---
Oh I do with the console ones. Fuck campers all the ghost faces I encountered on console rbag
---
This is something you experience once in a lifetime
---
This is why I hardly ever play survivor anymore.
---
I don't know either 😤
---
Exactly. Idk if you were gaming at this time, but Billy mains remind me of the cunts on MW2 who would run One Man Army, Danger Close, and M203. Basically, they gave themselves infinite ammo + grenade launcher + increased explosive damage.
---
If you're on ps4 you can queue with me. It's better with a pair. I'm also a stressed female. :p
---
I’m on console but I never camp as ghostface. If I do and I down the person who was previously hooked I leave them to be healed
---
How this turn out for ya
---
Better now. What’s up? You free? Wanna hang? I’m makin pizza rolls!
---
A random Nea or Quentin must show up in the map or lobby that how you should counter it (yah I know it kinda of a dead meme about Nea being ugly still)
---
Count yourself very fortunate, once they read my profile it's the 1st thing they use to me.
---
Honestly I remember this scene it was the one time in the entire franchise that Michael actually showed a little bit of remorse and hesitated. If only for a moment
---
Trying to use your time on a hook to google random debuff icons and figure out what it was doing to you/what perk it was
---
That would be a cool killer to add.
---
If you camp because someone unhook next to you when you wanted to leave it's not camping so dont beat yourself up about that
---
Instead of "the shark" have it as " the big one"
---
Ghostface
---
I got mike separate with cells btw and I still have him.
---
Im more scared of swf against corrupt, couldnt all 4 decide not to do gens until it ends? And I havnt been at rank 1 for a while now, switched to other games, so Im not sure how viable ruin has been as of late
---
But isnt it strange how ruin is most effective at low ranks. Noobs cant hit great skill checks, so they usually gen tap or search for it without knowing where to look. Bad design I say
---
It's literally the same animation of other short killers. You are just not used to it
---
...YOU FUCK!!
---
I’m on pc :(((((
---
Anyone hyped for the Irishman coming to Netflix this week?
---
Ok because that’s what usually happens, and I leave the hooked person be unless they run into me intentionally
---
because not every game is a coordinated swf.
---
but it can be, and that’s the problem
---
As a billy main who plays a lot of huntress, that map sucks lol. 
---
For real though I’d like to see red ranks vs all ranks for those indoor maps. When I play survivor The game and lery’s are some of my favourites and i never seem to have a hard time escaping on those maps.
---
You're on to something.
---
Bubba's basement
---
Honestly I'm fine with that, if the survivor is doing something. The thing I see too often is the bloody blendettes that hide in grass every time the killer gets near, and self care in the corner of the map every time they get hit.
---
Too bad!
---
Just be extra wary of the killers. Remember it also makes a distinct noise the killer might hear, also most importantly be aware of bloodstains if your Injured. If stop after a while but they make it extremely obvious what locker you're in. Lockers arent for noobs, but they're risky if you dont use them right
---
I prefer no reload add-ons, gives me more time to yell “YAH YEE YAH” and violently bob my head up and down.
---
It's fine, I think I made my point and not everyone disagreed with me. The only thing is that 30+ people downvoted me and I guess disagreed with my reasoning but only like 5 bothered to respond.
---
This is honestly more scarier than all of DBD
---
Lol k
---
All original killers and survivors can be grinded for in game the only paid characters are the licensed people. Plus they said all original characters will get a story in the tome.
---
I've been playing for 2 months. I still feel like this
---
Yea that's just bad timing on the survivors part
---
Is it possible to do stats over a longer period of time? The stats back in may with the survival rates, SWF rates, and everything was a great post but had some problems with the rank one survival rate.  If we could get that plus some stats about depip, safety pip, one pip, and double pip it would be perfect!
---
I know its a lot to make these posts but they are super appreciated by a lot of us and I know I really look forward to them but this one was a little underwhelming
---
He has the same exact kill rate as spirit
---
You be surprised by how often it happens.
---
Once there are less then two gens survivors commit to gens so hard and we'll pop them in the killers face, so annoying yet respectable.
---
Nice to see some Krita representation
---
Don’t forget more then half of the perks in the game are usless
---
Explain me why he has to be changed for being good so much time. Theres some kind of time limit?? Being good for a long time makes a killer stronger?? I think you need to rethink your logic because looks a lil bit... well, not very good.
---
How many shards you got lmao
---
You can just hear the leather wrinkling in this picture
---
i’m never toxic but most games i get tunneled all game, while the rest of my team finishes all 5 gens and when i finally die on my dead hook, the exits are already open. its kind of lame. i never get to do anything it seems like. but i still like the game for those times i can actually do gens, totems, go for saves, heal my teammates, anything but be chased the entire game AND tunneled off both hooks. not even exaggerating, i cant do that in 99% of my games. this is in purple ranks. 
---
it’s not even my fault they commit to me that long just because they see me first and develop tunnel vision, then proceed to camp and tunnel, instead of patrolling generators. i’ve even got called trash by a killer after being tunneled all game, even though the rest of my team got out because HE tunneled me. i guess people are just mean haha
---
**Bruh**
---
It would seem the delta would be an indicator of the killer's difficulty.  Clown is relatively "easy".  Nurse, spirit, freddy, billy are all fairly "hard".
---
Those fuck me eyes are calling me.
---
But what your opinion on this what should counter this Perk (I know I know it a total joke but what you opinion on this)
---
33 bc canada
---
Bm?
---
Ghostface gang
---
Yeah I usually eat decisive strike anyways
---
Aaayyy
---
Tough.
---
Nothing, nothing would be able to counter it
---
Definitely happened to me. I barely knew what to choose, so many options!
---
Words cannot describe this masterpiece.
---
Because it can give the players the opportunity to be fucking cocky and it gives no counterplay instead of slugging, which can be counterplayed by going into a locker, which can be counterplayed by looking at a locker for a whole minute, which can be counterplayed by Head-On.
---
In my opinion it should only be affective against tunneling like borrowed time. So when you have the time to heal up, finish a gen and come to rescue someone and get grabbed, just to be able to stun the killer for 5 seconds and mad-dab him is balanced in your opinion?
---
Or when people play and say/do "Dude i have DS, just let me tank after getting of the hook so i can stun his ass"?
---
My problem really is that the have that force shield around them of not being able to pick someone up that bothers me, after not tunneling, mainly.
---
This reminds me of scooby doo for some reason.
---
So what you’re saying is you wanna 3k every game. Ok Boomer
---
Imagine being so bias that even statistics can't away anything you think about the topic.
---
The game isn't and hasn't been survivor sided in a very long time.
---
Yah You can’t stop once you see Danny Devito
---
Lol exactly.
---

---
I play on PS4 and started before Legion so Doc was the biggest DC-bait at the time, too!
---
You can not listen to music while you play.
---
Last stats showed 4man games were about 7% of all games and even then the survival rate went up to "only“ 48%
---
ghostface: allow me to introduce myself
---
Yes ochido is back. I checked the video and that was on the latest build of dbd since I saw charms. He had to make an alt acc
---
Did you just try and use activist as a derogatory?
---
Yeah but even at rank 8 most survivors I go against are potatoes anyways and even if I don’t tunnel I get 4K’s. Maybe just a PS4 thing
---
No you kill the bad players and reward the good ones. Wtf backwards shit does this community follow
---
He went out as a hero
---
Yea, it's not a problem with survivors just what is expected of either role to pip. The opposite problem occurs with bloodpoints, where a killer barely has to try to get max points and a survivor has to finish 10 gens and carry the entire rest of the team through the exit gate to get 30k.
---
Agreed, survivors arent op but a decently coordinated swf group can fuck a killer hard.
---
Can I get a link to the stats?
---
Is this a jojo's reference?!?!?!?
---
Duh? The pallets on the lab are ao unsafe it's not even funny. Looks like the lab has beaten shelter woods as the new killer favored map.
---
i love how the only way to make bubba worse is to literally take his power away
---
Dont understand that feeling
---
Rank reset treatin me like crap
---
Balancing around draws isnt the worst thing though. There's only 20 ranks and if you dont end up drawing most of the games where youre at your level it will just make the higher ranks congested with different levels of players. Like you can get a red rank survivor thats a loop master or a liability to the team.
---
So I'm definitely not for killer nerfs as I play them mainly and don't really think Billy needs one. But what if they just added gasoline to his chainsaw? It would be on a meter that runs out and there could be gas cans around the map that he could refill with.
---
Oh that sucks I guess it’s just luck
---
The joke was like makig the question in a harsh way, thats why the description is literally HUH?!
---
One of my most memorable games is when it was just me and another player left in Coldwind Farms, and there was one gen remaining that I was working on. Almost done, so fucking close like 99 fucking percept, and the killer comes. I go and run, do a tiny loop and go right back to the gen and as he immediately downs me the generator pops.
---
And there at the other end of the map as I'm struggling on the hook is the remaining player opening the gate, with the killer looming around me but not to the point of camping. I watch, expecting her to just leave, but she fucking comes back! She unhooks me and we book it, and with the killer hot on our heals we cross the map and both escape.
---
I'll never forget that game, or that player. There are some real awesome ones out there.
---
woah there comedy genius, that’s too original.
---
anyways, what I’m saying is that there are conditions in which you can get no kills.
---
As a survivor, no matter what, you can always survive.
---
But as a killer, you sometimes don’t even have a chance at a kill.
---
Not saying that killers should be guaranteed one kill, I’m saying that it should always be possible to get a kill, just like how it’s always possible to survive
---
Haddonfield is the easiest one to find, some of them are so difficult though .-.
---
THATS WHY! Omg but hey if you really wanna know where the gens are. Try playing killer for a bit in these maps. You remember where the gens are because you can see their aura and then go back to playing survivor! 
---
On top of that, I know the Hawkins is a new map and can be disorienting. Here’s the tip! Most of the gens are around the outskirts of the map. Which means running in any direction and hitting a corner will likely find you a gen. There’s also almost always a gen near the exits and upstairs. Use different landmarks such stairs and the upside down (that part in green) to orient yourself. Imagine you’re looking at the map from above: the top and bottom will be stairs and greenish zone, the left and right will be exit gates.
---
is it up?
---
Me: o boi imma try this one. *gets nerfed* 😒
---
What games do you play cause I get trash teammates as survivor
---
Who the hell has a 70ms ping to a server in their own state.... How BAD is the network infrastructure out there?!??! It should be at like worst 20-40ms.
---
I mean hell, I had a 25ms ping to a server in freaking Boston from Chattanooga.  
---
Mind that the laggy servers are entirely interdependent on which backend ISP they are making use of and the amount of money they're investing in that. Add in also people playing on wifi, etc, which are, frankly, still not great for online play particularly if you live in an apartment complex.
---
But what do I know, I only play racing simulators. &gt;.&gt; and maybe deal with federation servers in my day to day job....
---
Good combo!
---
Not even that, I'll get down to rank 14, then have a game where I'm hooked first and depo to 15
---
You'd have to play the game non-stop on every alternative timeline simultaneously to be that (fitting, btw) devoted
---
Went down for me but I exited the game and started it up again and it’s working
---
Rammstein would be perfect background haha! Love it. Good variation, thanks!
---
That just happened to me after a match too. Then it disconnected me after I relaunched because of network status?
---
Getting the same. Was waiting for someone else to say it.
---
Same error. Was kicked out of a lobby.
---
Mori on first down is way less balanced. If back then killer with a mori found you first, before you had a chance to find a gen or teammates, and killer downed you,  game over in 1-2 minutes
---
Bad manners
---
Yep, me too!
---
maybe delete the pack and re download it?
---
Just restart! They are back
---
Imma not lev i not idiot u idiot 😒
---
Add on: explosive tipped teeth.
---
Give the chainsaw an area of effect similar in size to the “tzar bomba”
---
“Lol, just dodge noob”
---
that dude needs to go to a hospital cause his ankles are shattered
---
I’d just finished a game, the server went down in post game chat. When I’ve started up again I lost a pip and didn’t get my BP from the game. Classic DBD.
---
I got the same, I restarted steam and the game and it seems Ok now
---
Aw yeah, what artists do you like? Like you said it’s so broad! Yeah I can feel you on that. Can be distracting if in game
---
Does a disconnect count as a kill?   Would love to see some data on which killers cause the most disconnects.  Would hate for a killer to be seen as "over performing" just because survivors are not willing to learn
---
Just fyi, statistics aren’t and shouldn’t be used for drawing conclusions or “proving” stuff. Experiments are what is used for drawing conclusions, statistics have other uses, none of which are serving as “proof” for arguments
---
Best dlc killer is the one you like most :) and unfortunately the Xbox does suffer with long loads times but as you rank up it should get a little quicker. 
---
Enjoyed DBD
---
I had 3 shoot off the other day, it was great....not for the killer haha
---
That argument works if the survivor doesn't have as good of a connection to the server as the killer does. If the killer has a worse connection then your point is reversed because they see themselves farther than what they actually are and rubber band back to it while the survivor has a better sight of where the killer actually is and can play around that, in that situation the killers hits would be delayed by however bad the connection is and end up not hitting when on their screen it looks like it should. I don't understand how they would have a worse connection to the server in the first picture since it's a shorter distance for both of them to connect to the server than it would be to connect straight to each other. The survivor doesn't connect to the server to connect to the killer (which is what I see the first image as trying to say), both sides connect to the server and it plays out from there
---
When you go to your room and put on your clothes, look at the tags. It's easy to point fingers at others and call them 'bad people', yet it's even more difficult to look at ourselves and realize we're contributing to the same problem. Not too sure why the top minds of reddit downvoted, but what I do know is that people get angry when reality hits them in the face.
---
Thanks, I’ll check it out
---
It’s definitely situational, but for most of my survivor games, I’ll see two dumbasses running around doing nothing when they both get caught on the same generator when I’m using Bond lol.
---
Oh yeah, there’s an efficiency penalty when multiple survivors are working on one gen - you get more gen time done when everyone is working on their own gen
---
i haven't tried in at least a year because of a long break from dbd but billy feels damn near impossible to play as, i can never play as well as those slug masters can and the chainsaw always jerks in some random direction for me.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e1p4oz/item_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If billy is running after me and there’s a locker near, I’ll hop in it really quick to avoid being smacked/slow him down. Usually causes his chainsaw to hit the locker which gives me enough time to run and build more distance
---
She doesn't look like the same person at all
---
I never said it’s only him that complains and he does complain about survivor perks like decisive.
---
Do you disagree that a hypothetical killer with perfect prediction (i.e. equivalent to having third-person camera and wallhacks) would be able to pretty easily beat non-god loops without using their power?
---
She is! Not the same person that was in the trailer tho 😂
---
That’s epic! What a list! Definitely on that my Chem vibe. So nostalgic, the black parade!!

Bc she low-key deserves it

It looks nice, I liked the artstyle. Nice job!

Imagine having your parents pay thousands upon thousands of dollars so that you could have the best shot at life, and then look at them in the eyes to tell them 'C's get degrees!' 
---
Congrats, you wasted your parents money. You should be ashamed of disrespecting them like that, lord knows I would be.

I'm sure you've done all of the above and you know what? It's okay because it's not that serious.

I’m allowed to not like and advocate against something I support in the proper mediums. Not everything has to he about your sexual identity, respect that video games have nothing to do with what you’re trying to force on it.
