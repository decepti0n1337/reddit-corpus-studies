yes, thats distressing. DD sets the terror radius to 32 meters, distressing has no effect on it.

I've seen people complain because a SWF wouldn't stop bodyblocking or saboing hooks.
---
How did they get nerfed? We're they insta heals before be cause I tried using them before and they didn't work how I saw them in videos?
---
dont fall for it doggo, shes trying to destract you so the egc can get you! run!
---
Not for years surely saboing is not an issue and hasn‚Äôt been for a long time
---
They were already nerfed. No need to nerf them further. They're perfectly balanced as is.
---
Jesus... Does nobody buy Ace?
---
probably because getting people on hooks in the first place take more effort then healing other survivors
---
I'm both but I mainly play survivor and u thought insta heals where completely balanced so

Survivor: Open-Handed and Up The Ante | Killer: Brutal Strength and Hangman‚Äôs Trick
---
I get where you're coming from, and what you're feeling is the satisfactory factor of the game. the game as survivor has 2 true satisfactions: popping a gen and escaping. there isn't much satisfaction when you die in dead by daylight.
---
It's also why legion is so unfun to go against. I cant stand legion.
---
Both of Ace‚Äôs perks...except the one i wanted :(
---
dying light, thantophobia, sloppy butcher and ruin 
---

---
best map for me on legion is Auto wreckers for me
---
I play both sides and think the Moris should require second hook
---
Please tell me this is a joke..... please! :(
---
You're a hero for posting this quickly
---
More effort than putting plain text above an image for a meme because it just barely counts as not "unrelated content"
---
Ooooof
---
If moris get nerfed then keys also need a nerf
---
&gt;Both of Ace‚Äôs perks...except the only one thats remotely useful :(
---
ftfy
---
welcome to social media, enjoy your stay
---
Your forgot keys.
---
Wow they managed to put up 2/3 of aces perks and still failed to choose the good one. Bravo.
---
Ew
---
lol what 2 ace perks
---
So you‚Äôre saying Thanatophobia isn‚Äôt effective on plague if no one cleanses.....? Literally the best use the perk has ever had. Sloppy however is good on any killer with any play style.
---
Get the "ez win" and then depip because those addons make you lose emblems. But yeah keep making up reasons why you ruining the game for your 3 other teammates is justified.
---
Us V.S. Them is part of the game, right? :^)
---
used to heal instantly, now syringe heals over a short time and syptic provide endurance for like 8 seconds
---
You are right I was a bit biased but being completely honest I had 3 games of camping killers in a row and 1 where I died first hook because no one tried to save me and it just gets so annoying, You have a amazing point of view and argument, I will look at it a different way, but I just hope we can agree to disagree
---
Wow! All of these except brutal strength are useless!
---
How drunk are you on a scale of 1 to Kid Rock?
---
if they did this it should depend on the mori rarity atleast
---
Fudge, just throw every villain and every hero into dbd. I couldn't decide on just one each.
---
I know it‚Äôs annoying
---
I just want ruin
---
Yeah...
---
You toxic bitch üòà
---
So basically it's time to start racking up those DCs for testing purposes, right?
---
Probably somewhere in that range.
---
Yeah I already have those perks from the other killers, the killers I listed are the only ones of their perks I don‚Äôt have.
---
i don't have any videos, but if you have 2 friends to do it with i can do it with you. i also have a post with billy holding a hatchet
---
Uninstalling right now
---
I hope you never bring good addons as a survivor if you're going to complain about them on killer.
---
Gracoas hombre!
---
Yo, I need that trapper boi
---
Yeah, thats my thoughts. Like the person should be on death hook state to get mori'ed.
---
We've all been yellow jacket guy. I had a killer chase me around the entire map, he even passed by other players. I was like...Wow he is MADDDDD.
---
R/BoneAppleTea
---
Oh. I see. You‚Äôre a Claudette main.
---
I approve
---
I just have the water pumped into my mouth through a tube.
---
Waited a whole week to get this :/
---
Oh look, everyone got screwed this time
---
Ace free
---
I like it.
---
r/woooosh
---
It seems like you're missing your own point with your last paragraph there. The first three examples you give don't have to respect pallets because they can get through them quickly. Then the examples you give at the end are ways to prevent the Survivor from jumping back over that pallet which isn't the problem in the first place. Instead each killer needs to have a way to quickly get rid of that pallet or around it like your first three examples do.
---
Straws are dangerous.

---
My fav build on Legion is dying light, pop, ruin and thanphobia. You will slow the game down just a lil bit
---
What if I have to leave in the middle of a match, like if I have to go somewhere
---
I'm glad :)
---
Nope
---
I meant unsafe unhook. Typo due to the lack of sleep.
---
Sure say what you will I can't stop you
---
What NOED achievement? Been a while since I completed all the achievements.
---
It‚Äôs the archive mission.  Mb
---
Killer's damaging repaired gens wouldn't work, especially if they're still notified of it being finished.
---
Since when where tier list based on how bad players play the killer?
---
I've had my FPS capped to 144 for years and have had no issues whatsoever. Skill checks are much easier and the gameplay is more smooth. I'd play at 144 if I were you. Mind you, it seems they have recently made it so your FPS cannot go above 120. But still, it's very nice and no problems.

Legion : Cant find anyone so they come back to down me

Why?

---
DBD is a casual game. It isn't Rainbow Six Siege, and it also does not have a "ranked" mode and a "casual" mode. There is no reason for 30 minute dc timers in a game like this. I'd say start at 5mins.
---
Technically they've already been nerfed. You used to be able to mori them without even hooking them at all.
---
No its not bannable at all.
---
*laughs in stridor*
---
Not entirely.
---
Much like how I don't believe that every killer needs to be able to teleport across the map in order to apply pressure, I don't think every Killer needs to be able to jump across a pallet or get rid of it quickly.
---
As it stands, Trapper and Hag are the two characters that can lay something down to prevent abusing the Trap, while also granting a bonus for a later chase (as long as it doesn't get disabled). Spirit and Nurse can completely ignore the Pallet. Bubba, Hillbilly and Demogorgon can all destroy pallets immediately.
---
No one currently actually affects the pallet as it stands. Doctor is an easy stand in for his ability since being shocked and not being able to jump over is exactly what his ability already does, so you're just making it hit the Pallet as well. Pig is all about making hard choices that will let you live but hurt as well, so being Mangled/slower gen speed until healed makes sense.
---
Imagine if Pig's ability stacked; the more times the Survivor jumps over a pallet, the longer it takes to heal them and the slower they are on generators (to a point). Pig now has a choice; chase until you get the down, or force the Survivor to effectively make themselves useless until healed. That plays directly into Pig's "slow down the game" motif and the Survivors are doing it to themselves. The Survivor has a choice; waste time until the pig catches you, jump over hurting your ability to actually do something, or just run to a different pallet and run that loop, spending more and more resources until the pig eventually just walks around breaking them for end game.
---
The idea isn't to make Pallets useless, it's to make them actually have a trade off for those killers. By all means more killers should be able to ignore pallets, but that shouldn't be the *only* interaction with them.
---
Thanks ‚ù§
---
I agree this challenge was a pain in the ass. I got it by playing extremely selfishly. (Blendette with Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Sole Survivor, and Left Behind + a key doing nothing and waiting for everyone else to die to grab hatch.) 
---
IMHO it should be changed because to get it you almost have to play like a shitter since escaping without being hooked means you have to play very stealthily (Or if the killer finds you, somehow loop the killer for the remaining gens and escape through an exit gate/hatch.) and that ends up turning into borderline sandbagging.
---
Honestly tho wish dead hard worked better with the dedicated servers.
---
Just salty survivors lol
---
Exactly, i barely bring green items as survivor, i have +30 purple flashlights and +100 yellow ones
---
I couldn‚Äôt find 100% sure info, but I saw many more yes‚Äôs than no‚Äôs.
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Thanks for commenting!
---
I understand perfectly well what makes nurse strong. But she's weak to things that no other killer is. This is why I claimed she's the best killer in some situations, but she is not in other situations. A perfect nurse will fail every time against a good team on Yamaoka's estate for example. Find me a vod of a nurse 4king that map in rank 1 and you might convince me otherwise.
---
I like Dying Light as part of a "One Punch Man" build. Combo it with other "Ignore the obsession" perks like Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food, etc. as well as Rancor.
---
Ignore obsession all game, one-hit-mori at the end!
---
literally every time man
---
I was being aggressive
---
Thanks!
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is Hex: Ruined.
---
Just made this my background on my phone. This is sick
---
Come on, Baxter. You know I don‚Äôt speak Spanish.
---
whole lotta mid
---
I think pig is great with the right addons. Face mask, jigsaws blueprint for extra traps/boxes, any help slow the game down. Rusty hinges? No more stun/speed. Face mask and hiding in that locker to avoid BBQ? Now you don‚Äôt know where the hooks are. The traps will always slow down the game considerably because people need to take them off before continuing on safely. Now it‚Äôs worse if you only have that one trap and two boxes, I dunno why that‚Äôs a good addon, but pig can slow the team down if anyone can get downed.
---
I'm not saying we should force everyone to play the way I feels I best but I feel that there should at least be incentives for playing with a challenge like you said, where you could take the easy way out but you dont, which I find very respectable.
---
I also agree that playing for wins is your right and isnt a bad thing, but I think there shouldn't be stigma around that, that you can still do this without having a group of people that are now upset because of how you played. I know that's not pheasable since that's just how the game works but (and take this with a grain of salt cause I dont take anything seriously) maybe people should just take it easy and not focus so much about winning every game.
---
The labeling of anything survivors dont like as toxic is stupid, but some things arent unfounded, there are ways to play that are toxic, but who you play and how you play them shouldn't immediately be labeled toxic. I find people who baby rage at legion 4ks as a hilarious example as hes a very bad killer in the eyes of most players but good players make him very good (in some cases) and can easily win but that doesn't make it toxic to play him that's just hard work and experience which shouldn't be penalized. 
---
Yeah, it definitely does suck that people call you out when they make mistakes and label you as toxic. I feel like there should be support for players to show them how they're at fault instead of having the players immediately say it's the other sides fault.
---
There are many problems with the way people view the game and I understand how people dont call each other out, as when you deal with problems, people with similar problems somehow become validated in whatever they say which is ridiculous which is why we should hold each other more accountable and listen to those even if they do have differing opinions. 
---
Also I feel like many of the problems we have arent fixable with just the community, since the game is being constantly worked on, there needs to be communication and support as often as possible as well as a higher attention to detail. Of course I'm not saying that BHVR isnt trying, on the contrary I believe they're doing their best but I feel they sometimes focus on the wrong thing and other times dont involve us in the process as much as they should as feedback from consumers is one of the most important factors in any development.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I might do more wrestling ones; not sure yet.
---
Ah I see. Pardon the aggressiveness. I agree. If survivors end up getting shafted even more it won't be fun to play killer. Itll just be tag simulator.
---
vommy mommy*
---
Thank you :D
---
Adding 2 seconds to a totem would be a waste of development timez when the issue is that they are found within 2 seconds.
---
Once you stab someone it shows nearby survivors and if you stab someone already affected it barely affects the timer, ends your power, and leaves you with a stun. Not that the deceased wounds time does anything as it doesnt go down in chases.
---
YES HAHA
---
Yeah I always ask survivors to farm for that kind of crap, I don‚Äôt have time to waste on getting a great match for something that can be boosted.
---
You‚Äôve betrayed the killer community and are now shunned
---
üòÇ
---
More to come!
---
That's why you need to leave one survivor alone, slug the 2nd to last one, than find the survivor you left alone all game, put them on a hook, then find hatch.
---
‚ù§
---
Oni: ME SWORD IS GLASS!
---
I'll never understand gen rushers, they get a 30m queue, and when they finally get a match they do their best to rush it
---
Ah yes, slung over my shoulder like a sack of potatoes then tossed up on a hook like they're nerd getting an atomic wedgie on the school flagpole and then tentacle raped by the evil sky spider.  
---
With dignity...
---
The Killer could easily just only damage the repaired gens and not chase anybody, making the game go on forever. Or they could chase people but whenever a gen is finished they just leave the chase to go damage it. I like the idea of the match lasting longer but that would make it last too long.
---
Cause you're not playing with sweaty people you're just having fun
---
Sir, please! I only did it for a daily!
---
Never, dude
---
Pig
---
I'm with you and I like the idea. I think I assumed you meant the Survivor could see that the pallets were affected, like they could see electricity crackling over it or that it was trapped. I think these would work if they didn't know the pallets were affected.
---
Just as the cherry on top üòõ
---
So using your argument it's fine if killers DC if they're being beaten and not having fun? I personally don't find it fun when Ruin gets cleansed in 10 seconds, so it's cool if I DC?
---
It would also not be allowed to be posted if it wasn't
---
Thank you.
---
Wish I could hear this more often instead of his FATASS FEET
---
It does.
---
It still makes me laugh and probably will do forever, quality content
---
Legion sorta can counter loops with the new deep-wound nerf. Just hit them with feral and now they can‚Äôt taunt anymore or die. Granted they can run around but still
---
I love the Wraith's pallet stun he sounds like a bitch (bitch, your beards weird).
---
Nurse isn't weak on Yamaoka, at least not a good Nurse. Survivors hide on that map a lot but no good Killer regardless of map is going to fall for stealth plays 90% of the time. I know of one video of current Nurse on Yamaoka by Zubatlel, the best Nurse I've ever seen, but it was right around dedicated servers came out and he was rubberbanding the entire match so I don't think it's a good show case.
---
honestly thats a welcome nerf, not much is worse then having a rough game as killer being able to down one guy, then they all rush him and pop him up to full health and the gates open........ugh
---
That was the initial idea for this video but I couldn't explain why the David would do this to the Claudette so I changed the storyline. But yeah, watch out for killers who suspiciously let you complete the last generator.
---
Mmmm feet
---
Yeah i just cant seem to find normal people I only get these ‚Äúkeeping my head high‚Äù types lol
---
Once ive been asked by a killer to farm with an exact request and the rest of them wouldnt give a damn about it 
---
But I might just try it,maybe this time they would say yes xD
---
It's a 60 second ban.

happy cake day
---
You make a good point. Added another bullet.
---
So what are you waiting for? Just leave, that survivor is dead
---
I have a level 25 meg, I don't have any keys lmao. I'm not putting 1000 hours into a game about holding mouse one, hitting QTEs and running around in circles in predefined jungle gyms with your only defense being the same copy pasted palette.  The last game I played where the killer didn't get a 4k was when they didn't bring ruin and that was over a month ago.
---
I ran we'll make it to do the challenge, when you unhook someone and the little buff comes up in their screen they are way more receptive to being healed
---
My field medic perk build was- we'll make it, empathy, botany knowledge and solidarity. It was so much fun to use!
---
Yep.  Just slowly strafe right away from the exit to find the spacing
---
Those kind of players dont care about pips, they just like playing games they can‚Äôt lose.
---
Very fun for the other side. They‚Äôre just their to participate? Its a video game, it should be balanced for either side to win based on skill
---
Id love it if it were done my way. I‚Äôd rather have queues be a few minutes longer if it meant survivors wouldn‚Äôt rage quit immediately. At the very least it‚Äôd mean that the lobbies that take longer to find would be less likely to have quitters.
---
Imagine if you got your way and we continued to not punish people
---
... I mean I would have been happy to hear that a while ago
---
I had a first time legion in my game who spawned on me within terror radius. I got so mad and sure enough they found me. Then they proceeded to stab me and nonstop chase me. I would keep getting stabbed, speed boost, and repeat. We won the game within literally about 4 minutes.
---
Yea it's a shame they should minus bloodpoints or something maybe but then again some people don't care about that either
---
Just keep playing. That's the only advice I can give you for ranking up. You might lose, but assess on why you lost that trial, and improve from there. If you're genuinely a new player, camera movements, master that. Watch dbd streamers and see how they move their camera, learn that. It's extremely beneficial
---
The claim that rank 1 killers aren't playing nurse because she's too OP is a huge reach. They're playing other killers because they perform better more consistently.
---
It makes sense?  You queue as survivor you get a game instantly, that's the only reason I even play survivor so I can get some value out of this $20 barely functional indie game.  Killer queue times are always at least 10 minutes and sometimes I just give up after 20 minutes.
---
I mean it makes sense, you have "killer mains" on social media that whine about simple perks like dead hard and the misguided devs take them seriously and now no one wants to play survivor.  I think deathgarden is perfect evidence that these devs are incompetent af and just got lucky with this game.
---
True, but you haven't presented a  counter to the comment you've replied to, as they are still very much correct.
---
Had a game just like this where I played as meg and glitched in the same way. Not sure if it was me, but on the chance it was, here's a silver to show you we're all good
---
Never said dont, just said that the time outs shouldnt be as severe with all the bugs in the game.
---
You dont need a time out system. Just have what we have now but decrease the amount needed to earn a disconnect. Right now its a week ban minimum, not a time out. It just hasnt been effective because its not always enforced, the biggest quitters (certain streamers) get tipped off by the mods when they near the limit, and the amount allowed is too high.
---
Does anyone know if this triggers the first time you disconnect (especially if it's the game's fault) or if you get some grace?
---
damn it, I should have known better
---
And if the killer is just slugging survivors? You cant just kill yourself in hook in those cases
---
Optimally played, nurse's power is still the strongest.  Experienced nurse players will hit you in 2 blinks every time, and that's what Nurse has left.  It's the people that take more than 2 blinks that are going to struggle.  
---
  
---
Throw pallet &gt; dead.  
---
Hop window &gt; dead.  
---
Walk &gt; dead.  
---
She's still the best. Weaker than she was.  I dare say more fair, but still the best.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that the shrine was a garbage bin for the sins of man.
---
The only one still salty is the child crying to Reddit over it. Like c'mon dude, does the validation of people you'll never meet irl mean that much to you? U also have screenshot evidence of the facecamp, so there's that. :) Ok so, I'm done replying here. I reported your thread for harassment, so enjoy all the kharma coming your way.
---
Every single point you make is written as if you're the only person that matters. I have some shocking news for you, it's a team game and it's not about you. There are other people playing, and all you do is make the game even worse for them. It's a multiplayer game, you're not supposed to always be the winner. If you can't handle losing, go play a singleplayer game where you can set it the difficulty to easy or rage quit however much you want. How childish.
---
It's not bad, its just not that relevant anymore now that hooks and traps respawn (they used to be gone forever if you sabo'd them before).  
---
It's pretty much only useful to hook people on the same hook by waiting ten seconds, which is rarely needed since you usually have enough hooks nearby.
---
IMO there should be no mori and killer can just use execute after 2 hooks.  Ebony mori is essentially turning on a cheats and is far worse than a key or an instaheal.  If a killer wants to use that shit he can do that with a different squad, no harm in leaving since survivor queues are instant anyway.
---
This is not low tier, this is high quality
---
I like using Blood Echo on Legion and Plague too, and while the synergy between it and Mindbreaker is cool and something I hadn't even really thought about, I think Blood Echo alone is more than enough already, in most cases. After you hook a survivor, you (should) get into a chase with the next survivor swiftly, and so they will be afflicted by Blood Echo the majority of time - and then upon ending that chase and hooking that survivor, Blood Echo will proc again, rinse repeat. So unless you are ending your chases fast enough for Blood Echo to still be on cooldown, it alone already pretty much nullifies Exhaustion perks. (Plus, if you are ending chases that fast, not only does that mean you are in a good spot anyway, but it also means other survivors are also still exhausted for a certain amount of time too, unless your chase ends right between the 45 seconds cutoff point and 60 second cooldown - but then you can simply leave the survivor on the floor for those remaining &lt;15 seconds.)
---
I really enjoy not having to worry about Exhaustion perks too, and specifically Dead Hard is something I like not having to play around much at all anymore; having to get close to a survivor and wait out DH is just unsatisfying, and having a survivor DH to make it to a pallet or window when you thought you had them can be frustrating, and so being able to just swing away freely from max. distance and also knowing that they won't make a pallet or window if they don't have the distance to is great. But even then, justifying spending a perk slot on Blood Echo over other perks I could be using instead is already not easy, so spending two slots on combating Exhaustion perks is even harder of an investment to make. But yeah, for a like you say somewhat-viable anti-Exhaustion build, the combo is actually pretty interesting, and of course more potent than just Blood Echo on its own.
---
I think at the very least Mindbreaker should be buffed to pause Exhaustion for the entire duration of the repair, not only up to 50%. And maybe also cause 10 seconds of Exhaustion itself, rather than only 3. Then it could actually throw a serious spanner into the Exhaustion meta - if survivors have to be scared about one of their perks being all but nullified by a killer perk, they might start actually going without an Exhaustion perk altogether more often.
---
Would be cool to know if that‚Äôs true
---
What killer is it good on? Spirit?
---
every Killer main I watch says they hate mopping the floor with Survivors, they like it when the match is drawn out and they can actually play a full game, I feel the exact same way, more bloodpoints for me and the survivors, and everyone is happy. and Nurse is extremely difficult to pick up and just play, her skill floor and ceiling are extremely high, to the point that the only 2 streamers I can think of that have actually put effort into learning her are Zubat and Tru3. other Killer are just more accessible and that's why they get played more often. BHVR's most recent stat charts showed Nurse is the least played Killer in the entire game, not because she's bad, but because people simply don't want to pick her up and learn her.
---
BuT wHaT AboUt KeyS? as if they are in any remote way the same thing lmao.
---
Jesus you still talking. Get over it already
---
Any killer really. It's more of a novelty build but PYWF is very easy to gain stacks on with Wraith since you can start the chase, cloak to immediately end it and gain the stack, wait for the cooldown to end, uncloak to start the chase again, recloak for another stack, etc.
---
Why are ghostface players the chillest fucking people out there
---
The message removed by PlayStation safety says otherwise kiddo. The fact alone that you had to facecamp, then tunnel me while you claim that you went after the Claudette who unhooked me, ate my DS after missing all five hatchets says alot.
---
Sounds like you're making a conscious choice to not use the tools available to you and then think killers have to do the same.
---
I guess you have a point.
---
This seriously tickles me in a weird way. Like, yeah its the only Objective, but theres a Difference between being a Genjockey and doing your Objective.
---
I had a Clown game today on Coldwind¬¥s Thompson House. Above happened there, too, I got 2 Hooks before Endgame, both saved with Borrowed Time. We all ended with  under 15K points. Then, and only then, all this was suddenly my fault for "not chasing on Purpose". I didn¬¥t even make it to the third Gen before 3 poped.
---
I 100% agree its dumb to purposefully not run Hex: Ruin since Games end too fast, but damn that 4-man Squad with their 4 Brand New Parts complaining about their nonexisting Points and Depip made me choke on my Coke from Laughter.
---
They offer cells? Why the hell can't we get that on PC and Consoles?
---
Have you heard about sloppy butcher? Because it kinda seems like you havent.
---
I did that too earlier. Downed one survivor, heard the last working on a gen about 4m from me like a true genius.
---
As survivor I dont mind being slugged if the killer actually sees the other survivor nearby, its just when you‚Äôre left on the ground for minutes as they look for an immersed survivor all over the map and you get picked up, slugged again, picked up, slugged again.
---
Theres a difference between slugging because you see the other survivor, slugging and having a quick look, and then slugging to search the entire map 10 times over while the other player is left on the floor.
---
Its the last example that is the one that needs to be addressed, and being able to bleed out faster would help alleviate that.
---
Pips are useless, and the survivors are generally spiteful whether they win or lose, no matter which killer or loadout they face. Thus, it's best to use the best loadout no matter what. 
---
I also prefer instant down abilities mostly to counter the fact that if I don't use one, the survivors are rewarded for being hit with a speed boost while I get punished with a cooldown.
---
Jesus you really still salty aboug this? Grow up and move on already.
---
they didn't say how long it was, just that it wasn't 30 seconds.
---
What what some of you are saying that a killer and survivors can cooperate to gain more blood points? Tell me how please
---
So you want survivors to respect the killers' autho-ra-taee?
---
I'm game.
---
Unfortunate ending üòÇ
---
Guess what, dc exist in every single game, if people dont enjoy a match, they will dc and you cant force them to not do it, they are fixing the symptom, not the cause, i wont keep playing a match because someone decided to be a dick, if the other ones on the match want to keep playing they are free to do it, i will find another match or comeback later
---
Multiple identities as well.
---
What rank was this? I guess Bubba really hates neon green.
---
Eh, I've personally run into some pretty bad ones. I appreciate that though!
---
So?
---
You'd think the first could go unpunished. Any how long the decay is, or does thw dc count stay with you forever? I'm worried about getting stuck at an infinite loading screen sometime in the future and then not being able to play the day anymore that day.

What a leg

In the Dream World, survivors have the following debuffs:
---
- They hear a lullaby instead of the terror radius/heartbeat. This makes it incredibly difficult to discern where Freddy actually is (this is one of the most underrated aspects of Freddy imo)
---
- They can be affected by dream snares and dream pallets
---
- They have the Oblivious status effect, making perks dependent on a terror radius such as Borrowed Time not work
---
- The cooldown of Freddy‚Äôs gen teleport is reduced by 15% for every sleeping survivor
---
There‚Äôs a couple more depending on add ons but that‚Äôs the gist of it.
---
Being honest I feel like after ash learned he cant die permanently hes just been having the time of his life.
---
Buenos dias senorita
---
Dude. The salt is you. You came here crying to Reddit after getting called out on being trash and toxic. You're name dropping, encouraging bullying, and harassing me by having this thread up with my PSN name. Just stop trying to get the pity of anon people already. I posted all the crud since you only wanted to show the parts that you think make you look like a victim. You're racist, unpleasant and rude, and I hope you get banned on all platforms for your harassment.
---
This isn't the Pig perk I wanted! Where's my MYC?!!
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
Imagine having to use both hands to hit a skill check
---
This post was made by the side mouse button as skill check gang
---
It's boring?
---
Would you find the match fun if all four survivors were AFK for the entire match? Smack them twice, put them on a hook and they die as soon as the struggle phase starts?
---
Camping does not only happen in ‚Äòend game.‚Äô It ruins the experience for other people and needs to be tackled rather than supposed killer mains getting bratty
---
Moris are more comparable to keys than instaheals
---
Happened to my friend and the killer dc‚Äôd we were freaking out tho,it‚Äôs usually an animation error of some sort
---
Where is it!?
---
For all the things I did right makes up for the little errors. I did not catch this error, but that's okay.
---
When you're so bad at finding downed survivors you run deerstalker constantly
---
I haven‚Äôt done this, but I get why it would be fun to just do it once or twice. Just the pure destruction is fun.
---
The shrine this week is more garbage than a camping tunneler.
---
Now, the real question is, how close do the DCs have to be to count?
---
The problem emerges when if bleeding out faster still wouldnt guarantee the hatch, survivors would just DC, and I think that's a shame.
---
That accidental locker is heartbreaking haha... But seriously though, your team could only get 2 gens in that time? Lol
---
No one gets banned on this game anymore. Why would you be concerned if something is reportable?
---
This is DBD in a nutshell.
---
"You outplayed me? No fair game for you!"
---
I think they were green or purple. Im purple but the matchmaking has been everywhere lol.
---
did this once with friends and the rank 1 pig moried us
---
Thanks
---
Yeah I was actually heartbroken when it happened. Definitely not my intentions
---
*sigh*
---
#pulls put Deerstalker
---
I mean I agree with you that Survivor mains are salty but that's no reason to be a twit and get ultra sweaty. I like to actually be challenged so I don't see the fun in winning 5 seconds in.
---
Not without his M16 or 1911.
---
When out of ammo in L4D, all you can do is give the infected a weak shove.
---
Bill is unarmed in the Entity's realm, just like Tapp and Ash. Without his guns, he's just (an admittedly badass) old man.
---
The killer perks are great ideas but the power is ridiculous
---
Dont forget demigorgon‚Äôs shred which can break the pallet and also cancel out a pallet by breaking it and hitting the gut with shred.
---
Child why are you still salty? You said what you had to say even though you lied none stop. Grow the fuck up. You literally don't got shit on me. You went after me, lied about me, and nothing in thag original text was racist yet here you are playing like a victim even though you still going after me HOURS after the game had ended. You tired banning me for literally no reason but because I killed you in a video game. So stop lying and stop @ me cause you just showing everyone that you're a child who can't take a lose.
---
Im aware. Im just talking about counter play. Literally nothing a killer can do to stop people from jumping into the hatch.
---
I went through this twice. It fucking sucks. First time,  I was hooked at endgame and right before I ascended a survivor saved me causing freddy and I to sit there for 30mins trying to figure out how to end it while keeping our points. Second time i was stuck by a tree and the huntress left me there eventually dc. Both happend while playing dwight.
---
Ghostface is either the memeist fucker you've ever run into or the most toxic hoebag stealth camping hooks.
---
There is no middle ground.
---
‚ÄúThe Game‚Äù because if not in swf there‚Äôs no way to communicate to others and then it‚Äôs basically a free kill
---
Also removing a health state just for searching a box
---
Wow you really changed my mind, sike. And im not trolling, im just making valid points. Idc if Killers use mori because its apart of the game, Michael Myers basically has a perk thats like a mori. O well, I guess u can just lobby dodge if you're not good at killer üôÑ
---
Absolutely terrifying, lol.
---
Damn this is doo doo
---
‚ÄúThe Game‚Äù is meant to have the announcement broadcasted thoughout the map, but i see your point.
---
You really made a huge effort for this post. I'm gonna be honest with you. I didn't read everything because this is hella big but some parts I read, I agree with you. She definitely needs a rework.
---
Except they're not after 2 times
---
I CANT BREATHE THIS WAS AMAZING
---
Yeah even then it‚Äôd be too hard to communicate. I would make it so the survivor that is wearing it is not allowed to pop the gen instead.
---
And then you get jumpscare Myers.
---
They're both stupidly overpowered so they are.
---
Instaheals needed a nerf. Moris need a nerf. Keys need a nerf. Both sides have things that are pretty OP, so some balancing needs to be done
---
This could be a good change. Perhabs if it forced the survivor to only go for Jigsaw boxes and not gens, unhooks etc? I will definitely look into this. Thank you.
---
now you just get a new fancy lobby searcher
---
BHVR is about to get 15 matches worth of data for their DC test.
---
There's an easy and safe way to get rid of the 120fps cap, and so if you want to do that, I could tell you how - in exchange for you telling me whether it causes any gameplay issues on dedicated servers, ha.
---
As for your resolution, I doubt it is actually taking it from the files, since for windowed fullscreen mode it will just run at native res and scale down from there. I suggest you take a screenshot of your game and check the resolution on that image - it will always be your native res no matter which numbers you put into the files (unless you also force the game into true fullscreen mode).
---
HAHA, thank you.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs better. Should we prevent everything until they take off the trap. Would be fun changes though fs.
---
You actually have to have the "safe unhook" +500 points pop up. It did the same thing to me. If you escape too soon you don't get it üôÑ
---
Good one!
---
114 teachables currently. 
---
If the perks showed in order, without repeats, it would take 27 weeks for all current killers' perks to show up and 30 weeks for survivors.
---
Add RNG into this and it is possible to not see a perk up to a year.
---
I will look into this and see if i can balance this more.
---
update: multiple opportunities to let survivors do gens and escape chase while i literally stand in a corner waiting. all 3 left with a key. feelsbadman
---
pretty much yep
---
&gt; The RBT has a chance of 0.1% each second to kill the survivor.
---
This is terrifying. One in seventeen (5.9%) will die in the first minute of the RBT. One in ten (11.4%) will die in two minutes. One quarter (26.0%) will die in five.
---
Combine this with Amanda's Secret and a five-minute game, and you've got a 70% chance of a kill on at least one survivor that you never even have to _see_.
---
Thank you. But you are right, the post may be too big. Maybe i should remove the comparison.
---
Well in that case just fuck yourself, they only add this stuff for killers, i cant count how many times i got fucking slugged in the endgame being the last one, but its okay i guess, because SuRVs OP aND TOxIc
---
The fact you can't win against killers with red addons tells me all I need to know about how good you are at the game.  Rank and time played means nothing.  Anyone with two brain cells can hit rank 1 as survivor and killer.  Not too hard.
---
Nothing has been announced yet. Soon‚Ñ¢.
---
if he doesnt want to farm he should just play the game.  he farmed when he lead me to pallets to stun me with them
---
i‚Äôm thinking tomorrow
---
I mean, I hate people that DC as much as the next guy, but when people go against a decent Doctor (whos counter is literally hiding in fucking lockers) with good addons, I don't blame them when they DC. That killer is not enjoyable to play against. At all. 
---
You spend 90% of the match with a dumb filter over your screen and being forced to do a stupid series of 3 skill checks that if you fail one of them you scream, and your progress is reset and if he finds you while your in the middle of it and you stop your progress is reset and you cant play the game until you get rid of it.
---
I'm joking
---
That‚Äôs an amazing piece of art my guy ü§ô
---
Good point. I was just unsure if my changed had a too big impact, thus i thought the additional time would be a good idea. 
---
And i TOTALLY love the cosmetic idea.
---
same happened to me two days ago. Meg was on the hook, still, with crows flying over her head. I couldn't unhook her, then when I was downed close by, I was hooked right where she was xD
---
From what I understand on the other thread if you don't load in every 4 or 5 games then you will be fine. You might get the 1 minute penalty but it would go away instead of stacking up.
---
Good ideas, there are some flaws but it‚Äôs a very good concept.
---
Broken sanity.
---
A way I think you can valence it is when you search it doesnt I get you but you get 2 or thread skill checks that get harder as you go along and if you fail one then you get hurt
---
What sound does a ruin totem make? I see a few youtubers said that they can hear a totem nearby.
---
Still have yet to ever see one of these.
---
I feel like this will create more bugs
---
I mean if there are three people left, and the killer Downs you, downs your friend then chases a bit and chases the last guy, and you are still crawling into a corner by the time he hooks the other two its all your fault.
---
The killer wants to get out because its boring, you want to get out because its boring, but the hatch is closed and he cant find you. All you have to do is make yourself as obvious as you can instead of hiding in the corner.
---
It's totally possible as we've been getting cosmetics for the Saw Chapter more than the others, so I don't see why they don't do something like that. Though the only problem would be the Shotgun-Necklace as it would have to remove the survivor's head, but the Venus Fly Trap just covers the model
---
just use m4 forehead
---
I understand your idea, but the main problem with these ‚Äúharder skill check‚Äù addons is they become useless at high rank and very punishing for new players. 
---
Allthough if it could be implemented without it hurting the Pig, it would be amazing :)
---
Bill's never almost single handedly stomped apocalyptic events and fought God like demons like Kandar the Destroyer. Bill's strong for sure but not really on Ash's level.
---
So retaliating against unsportsmanlike behaviour by not rewarding it, is now toxic?
---
Wow.
---
Just got my confirmation text!! Thank god lmao
---
Yea that‚Äôs the problem with skill checks in the game they are strong at low level but at high level they become a joke
---
I just got a confirmation text! So it'll be shipping soon!
---
No.
---
Wow. Imagine failing at facecamping as Leatherface. Yikes!
---
sounds like a faint crackling fire
---
I think I've seen one for every licensed killer except demogorgon, tried it and wasnt very impressed it's not as fun just one chance at it with no perks or add ons
---
care to explain?
---
Not at all
---
I'm considering buying this game after seeing the Stranger Things DLC. I have few questions!  
---
* Can anyone guide me to a basic **text** guide? I mean an absolute basic guide. Like, why do some killers just one hit someone and go after another? Why not outright kill them? What kind of game modes are there? The [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/index.compact) says "New User's Guide (coming soon)" but there is no link.   
---
* What is the game monetization like? Season pass? In-game currency for cosmetics? B2P characters / maps / modes?  
---
 
---
* Apparently I just missed the sale on Steam. Damn. Anyone knows if any sale is planned for Xmas (on PC)?  
---
* What are the DLC's that you consider necessary? And why is that (strong killer/survivors, or simply fun additions/game mods)? Similarly, any DLC's that you would **not** recommend?
---
No worries man. In any competitive games, just remember that you'll meet trolls once in a while. Just focus on the next game. Don't overthink that particular game. And skip post chats, always.
---
My idea for a fix would be that you have to cleanse all totems to power a key. If you mori a survivor, a random generator will become fully completed.
---
Solo survivor is underpowered. while a really good SWF is OP in most cases.
---
If its a nurse, spirit, billy, or freddy i think its fair play against a SWF.
---
If its a good swf against a good killer that isnt necessarily a top tier its mostly SWF sided.
---
The issue is, you cant nerf SWF bc without SWF this game will die, solo survivor sucks so much cock so what they should do is buff solo survivor in ways that dont effect swfs, then nerf survivors in general after that. E.X: Add kindred to base kit.
---
Playing an online multiplayer game with bad internet makes that player a cunt.
---
Without a doubt. I'm ready for the whole "economy" to be reworked.
---
I'm not going to lie I havent read it and probably wont cause I'm lazy but have an up vote for the effort
---
Also, when The Pig first was announce, I was hoping we'd get a replacement to the hooks in game where she places them in Traps and it would be treated like a hook, but have new animations and just really spice up the game. I would love to design the models for the traps and send them to BHVR.
---
play normally but without ruin
---
My girlfriend introduced me to DBD about 6 months ago and we‚Äôve been playing together everyday since. When she‚Äôs not with me we do survivors. When we‚Äôre together we take turns being the killer.
---
They should hang this up in a gallery somewhere
---
Dope! And I dont even like legion üòÇ
---
I'm not sure but it seems kinda useless now because all you have to do is sprint and you don't need to mend.
---
Yes, because it took 0 effort considering it‚Äôs just a picture with text and this is the least creative idea you could possibly think of
---
It is just overall nerf, with an exception of running/vaulting speed (which you have a lot anyway, and the buff is minor).
---
Making him run 10 meters per second would make a difference. 5,2 and 5 are basically the same....
---
Unfortunately, the only way to get rid of skill checks is to play Killer.
---
who?
---
I mean it depends. If it's a real 4 man sweat squad then yeah they are gonna be rough and super strong but those are extremely rare. 4 extremely strong survivors will give a killer a hard time whether they are swf or not though to be fair.
---
I play in a 4 man, red rank swf most days and we are all competent but far from the level of the top 1% and a good killer will do well against us and there's still a fair share of 4k's. And I play plenty of killer too and I'm definitely not frightened of a swf.
---
The trouble isn't swf, the trouble is the lack of strong enough killers to cope with the top 1% but they can't possibly balance that because of the amount of more casual players that play and the fact that killer completely stomps at rank 20-10 so new players would be put off.
---
No, anyone like that is just going to suicide on hook, it will almost exclusively affect those who are kicked out for whatever reason
---
That's... literally what a meme is.
---
&gt; We cant rank every survivor and killer to level 40. That's a bit much.
---
Actually leveling every character to 40 is faster than earning iridescent shards to purchase every perk...  Remember it takes 2,000 shards for 1 perk, and you have to farm shards by playing the game, same as bloodpoints!
---
I did some very quick back-of-the-envelope math in an attempt to prove this:
---
Averaging all levels, you do earn ~0.072 Iridescent Shards per Experience Point ([source](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player_Level))
---
Let's say average amount of xp per match is 650 (amount gained from 10 min match earning 4x gold emblems) meaning each match nets 47 iridescent shards
---
114 teachables requires 228,000 iridescent shards.  Using our average match amount we need to play **4,851 matches to afford all perks using shards.**
---
On the other hand, getting level 40 with a character takes on average about ~1.2 million bloodpoints (source: couple different reddit and steam threads of people guesstimating)
---
Let's say we're getting an average of 15k bloodpoints per match, which is probably low, but we'll say it's 30k after taking into account BBQ and chilli and some other +bloodpoint perks and offerings which we'll use because we're efficient farmers
---
There are 38 characters, and to reach 40 on all of them will take 45,600,000 blood points.  If we make 30k each match, we only need to play **1,520 matches to afford all perks using bloodpoints.**
---
Even at 15k bloodpoints per match, we would need 3,040 matches, still about 1,800 less than if we did only iridescent shards.
---
For it to be worth farming all perks with only iridescent shards you would need to be earning less than 9400 bloodpoints per match every match for nearly 5000 games.
---
**tl;dr: 4,800 matches to earn enough shards to purchase every perk assuming average match performance.  1500-3000 matches to learn by leveling up every character to 40 depending on performance and builds.**
---
Yes. Now it should kill the survivors without the hook requirement. BUT generators need 70% less time to complete. Let the actual horror game begin....
---
It‚Äôs not entirely useless, you‚Äôd be surprised how much a survivor stops running mid chase. Also they can‚Äôt really use flashlights, as they have to stop sprinting
---
Can you elaborate what you mean?
---
I know it just annoyed me how you said you put effort into it when it took none at all
---
you keep items upon dcing
---
Did you buy his chapter through the PS store or did you buy with Auric Cells in the in-game store? The splinters will only disappear if you purchase the entire chapter from the store. If you buy any of the characters with Auric Cells, they‚Äôll still appear for some reason. I‚Äôve bought all of my characters through the PS store and I haven‚Äôt seen a splinter in years.
---
Well at least the flair checks out.
---
you'd be suprised as to how often mad grit will help
---
Bad Bot
---
Auric cells
---
gen slowdown
---
That's actually me. When I started playing with my friends, and Haddonfield loads, I immediately shouted the killer is Myers into their ears
---
This is super cool! 10/10
---
Or just make him without the sprint ability, but with the deep wounds ticking down in-chase. Also, reduce the mending time drastically, so you can mend mid-chase. Boom, solved the problem. Now he is a delayed insta-down killer with couterplay.
---
Quickly mending in chase is also much more engaging and interesting, rather than mending for ethernity on one place....
---
I mean the entire character, ability and play design is not fun or exciting. 
---
I'd rather go against the nurse or spirit 24/7 than the current legion.
---
True, also why is up the ante even a perk it literally seems pure *garbage*
---
There is an app called "Randomizer for DbD," it explains all the basics of the game...like perks, killer powers, etc. There is also a section that lets you practice skill checks. It goes through a series of regular skill checks, then moves on to hex skill checks. It's very helpful.
---
I'm 99.99% that was me a few months ago. Biggest regret of my life, my friends were egging me on to meme because it was a ttv swf. If it was you I genuinely apologize lol
---
2 gens btw
---
I was in a match with my friends and we all got slugged by an Oni. He picked one of us up and the rest of us split up and went to opposite sides of the map hopping to find hatch (two of us had keys) By the time he picked up a second survivor he lost the rest of us. Spent the next 5 minutes bleeding out, with the Oni looking for both us. At that point it was a race if the Oni could get both of us before we got the hatch.
---
100 seconds*
---
I think this eould be interesting, but instead of it glowing for all Survivors, it should just do it for those with aura perks. SWF groups wouldn't need the universal glow, and those that are fortunate enough to run aura perks gain another boon.
---
Some addons promise me I won‚Äôt have a fun time (iri head/swing chains Freddy) so no thanks.
---
Thank you. :) I am a girl just to clarify but I don‚Äôt mind being called a guy
---
Why are you DCing so often though? That's 3 DCs out of 5 games total we know of. No way in hell anyone should be DCing that much other than for abuse.
---
Iv played since Beta. DbD has been know to be rather buggy, but I can't recall it EVER being THAT broken to need to DC 3 out of 5 games in a row.
---
Agreed. Deep wound state is literally ‚Äúinjured state but with angry orange line‚Äù now. It should make people go down after a while, unless they heal, regardless of being in-chase or not.
---
Yet, speed of ticking down in-chase should be much slower than speed outside of chase/terror radius/whatever.
---
We don‚Äôt even know 100% that there will be an event yet
---
Same for Open Handed tbh
---
It was recently on the new Oni map
---
You‚Äôre friend‚Äôs pretty talented, dope photo
---
Excuse me? Why?
---
Because entity
---
She smells like a rotting pig head.
---
Yeah, for like the first two or three penalties. It ramps up immensely after that.
---
oh i was gonna say its cuz theyre about to prestige up so they cant keep items anyway
---
I've also seen the dead zone from hooks being gone actually come into play as well. Hell, that survivor trying to kill themselves but instead kobeing might get them to stay in the game. 
---
Like, I don't get how bad at this game you have to be to think that DCing and killing yourself on first hook is the same thing. They're both bad for your team, but one is leaps and bounds better than the other.
---
when your trying to level up your killers and the entity pulls a reverse card
---
I agree w this 100%. Otherwise you could just hop into a locker w head on and it becomes a perk that gives your teammates and especially swf a lot of knowledge that might be op.
---
wat
---
Imagine Dwight with pyrovision goggles
---
a braver soul than i

I mean, I don't think the devs or other players are that upset that you would. Good game development companies implement rules and penalties like this not just to change behavior but get rid of players who probably make the game worse for everyone.
---
Practice.
---
Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about bro, that‚Äôs clearly just skill.
---
How much you willing to sell them for?
---
True, but in the L4D comic, he bashed a zombie's fucking brains out with just a quick melee from the butt of his M16. He also survived at least one (1) Tank bitch slap, which should probably knock Bill's torso away from the rest of his body, but he made it through...partially. Bill doesn't get enough credit because his beard is infected.
---
I'd pay for the sharknado
---
damn not me then, this was way earlier this year. i was ready to repent lol
---
Sell them through etsy, I can't go to L.A in January.
---
I'm a girl and I don't DC. I'm not allowed to say ew to a killer I don't like playing as or facing? Nice.
---
Not a survivor main. :)
---
To be fair, I've came out of games sure my team where all rank 15-20 just to see they were red ranks :P
---
What if you had to be in a certain range? Like 16 meters
---
Obama
---
I can somewhat agree with this. The only unfortunate part is the mention of outside resources, just because some could say that it shouldn't be that bad since Killer's can bring add-ons. I see add-ons as very essential parts of their power, but some could make the argument that bringing items for Survivors is comparable.
---
This game is weird:P
---
I can only hit your last two questions at the moment:
---
1. I‚Äôm not a PC player so I‚Äôm not 100% sure, but I‚Äôve heard Steam has a winter sale coming up. 
---
2. So DBD DLC isn‚Äôt like The Sims or other games where it adds modes or new features. Buying DLC will only give you a survivor and/or a killer, and their perks. So no DLCs are essential. However, if you‚Äôre interested in new characters, I like the Halloween DLC. Myers is a fun killer, and Laurie has a great survivor perk. I also like the Demise of the Faithful DLC, because Plague is really fun. Ghost Face is a blast too. 
---
Also, while we‚Äôre on the subject, you can buy non-licensed characters with Iridescent Shards in-game, which are earned just by playing. It can take a while to earn enough Shards for a character, but if you play enough it‚Äôs a great investment. Just something to consider.
---
The killer perks aren't much better
---
Yo devs can you guys please kill yourselves please!!!!!!! You guys are worthless in this world i fucking hate you fucking ugly pieces of shits
---
weak killers are forced to play like ass to get kills
---
His twitter is @Official_Slidy if you want to check him out.
---
Fuck thats accurate
---
"If your beard turns, can I shoot that too?"
---
"Shut up Francis."
---
Still, he's armed then. Firearms are still deadly when used as blunt instruments.
---
The closest we get to see him fight unarmed is when he's fighting his way out of the hospital in the comic, but even then, he's dual-wielding a bonesaw and knife.
---
You can't see auras while in a locker and no one can see your aura while you're in a locker
---
That's a good tip, and also highlights one of the problems with his Frenzy ability. Having an incentive for the killer to prefer eating a pallet stun is a really backwards design.
---
Wooo!
---
I‚Äôm a legion main and the update for him was a big buff me me. I feel faster in every aspect besides vaulting and it‚Äôs made him a lot better.
---
His add-ons could use a complete rebuild though that‚Äôd be nice; they‚Äôre so boring and just ass imo.
---
But the perk really doesn't need a buff. It's already really good as is.
---
"They've done studies you know. 15% of the time it works, every time!"
---
It was a joke :)
---
Looking at this gives me so much pain
---
Lol pull what power cord?
---
&gt;losing, unhappy
---
&gt;pull power cord to pc/router to avoid 2 minute ban
---
&gt; wait 3 minutes for router//pc to reboot
---
&gt; "heh, stupid devs, im smorter than them"
---
Haha typical DbD. Haven't actually played in months, the community is just the worst now lol.
---
I think killers bringing addons shouldn't matter because our shit gets used up after the match. Survivors can bring 10923763920272 green toolboxes with instructions and socket swivels if they don't die each match, and if they do die they can use black ward.
---
Even then Brutal Strength is a waste of a perk slot unless you're on something like Clown or Doctor where you have to eat every pallet to get a hit
---
I could see like 4/8/12 range when leveled up but any higher than that and I think it would be unbalanced imo.
---
An icon I had no choice but to stan!

Lol baby trapper relying on noed to get kills lol garbage

I had originally thought it was like a ‚Äúdeath by a thousand cuts‚Äù thing. Like the power was you had to hit survivors 3-4 times in frenzy in other time down them. But, that‚Äôs not the case anymore.
---
A very funny one, indeed.
---
Well the perk description says a terror radius of 32 meters, not 100% sure on madness but I've seen a few other posts that have asked that and they said no
---
Go for someone else dumbass

That is dope

Get banned. There is nothing wrong with slugging. Now deal with it.

Idk if the WTF is about being off by a few hundred for a perfect game, or the visual bug
---
Max trash.
---
Camping is forced on good killers at end game. Other than that they don‚Äôt camp. You‚Äôre clearly at a shit rank. If you camp, you lose. Simple. Unless you‚Äôre like green ranks or worse.
---
Only if BHVR releases a thicc-er woman survivor will my main ever change. Shes just so glamorous!
---
I've had 3 separate instances now where I've gotten hooked in a basement and I've glitched into a void. I can hear all the game audio but I cant move or see my character really (unless I'm running around on other screens but cant see it) and the only way to get out of it is to disconnect on purpose. Hope it doesnt happen again!
---
The horse
---
Last survivor has trap. Pig can just keep pressuring they have to take trap off to escape? In this case wouldn't the trap and the deep wound be doing the same job?
---
Taking the trap off is similar to finding a med-kit (not the same)
---
With most killers being the last survivor is pretty close to a death sentence. There are quite a few one-hit killers?
---
I'm low ranked, I dont know a lot but I feel like what I'm saying makes sense?
---
Soooo .... 3 shit  perks, one just ok perk, and is only a teachablenon a base game killer who is easy to pick up. Great shrine, thanks
---
I must be in a MOOD because reading it tilted me lol.
---
Playing on my killer only account, and I get these comments constantly. I never run ruin or addons yet I still get these comments 1/3 games.
---
Im a survivor main too. Sad.
---
That‚Äôs not an aura. I believe you can see location notifications with Contagious Terror, too.
---
There is no bong without the bing!!
---
lol wat.  
---
One is useful on a particular situation. The other lets you kill all survivors at any time after one hook. What are you even on about.
---
Well that's not really an aura. An aura is bright red and in the shape of the survivor. He just get's a flashing pentagram.
---
Literally the fact that no one asked for your opinion is the issue.
---
Ehhh it‚Äôs just a cool little animation cancel trick. We have nemesis and spirit fury which both encourage getting hit by pallets so it‚Äôs definitely an incentive for killers at times
---
Right it‚Äôs not as if the power dynamic of this game has been and continues to be disgustingly in favor of survivors and the most prevalent survivors understand how powerful they are and are very cocky about it, which demoralizes killers who simply want to have fun and play normally, compelling them to feel like they need to fight dirty, only to be met by the same cocky survivors who then treat them like they‚Äôre some kind of extra large pile of shit for actually trying. 
---
It can‚Äôt be that at all /s.
---
Dcing still pussy shit.
---
Good point, but it's worth noting he fought off anesthesia while doing that. He's an old man under the effects of anesthesia fighting off zombies with a bonesaw and scalpel. 
---
The takeaway from this is Bill should be able to kick The Clown's ass.
---
I've been glitched into  void 3 times now and have had to disconnect. Sorry to anyone I've confused or deeply hurt for abandoning you!
---
Lol, i'm a ps4 player and i queue for atleast 10 minutes either way so i woudn't even notice the difference..
---
fake uncloaking is pretty good for wraith.  Makes em dump sprint burst
---
I take that Baby is a euphemism for a newbie then?
---
Same. I'll keep re-rolling one each day. No killer for me
---
Mori‚Äôs are mostly used for streamers and daily rituals. Normally nobody brings a mori for fun.
---
If you derank as killer it can also mean you literally killed every survivor way too quickly, meaning you *overperformed* and are being punished for it
---
BHVR go fuck yourselves you ugly cunt looking ass bitches. You guys like sucking the cock of killers because the people that play your game have no brain and need help to win. Fuck you devs you guys dont know how to make a game what so ever. Please delete dbd and do not attempt to make another broken game please
---
Facts none of the other survivors can compare to such a baddie
---
A true P3 Claudette doesn‚Äôt even get rid of the totems :D
---
Agreed. He was intended to be in-chase heal kind of thing, but they were too afraid to make him OP, so they made him annoying instead (if that even makes sense).
---
Not at all. I‚Äôm not a toxic survivor so as soon as the gate was open I just left right away. I literally had a full bar because I didn‚Äôt use it at all. Also the killer was nowhere near so it couldn‚Äôt have been franklins.
---
If it helps, I was terrible at them. I changed the button for it and that helped as well as practice.
---
Exactly. So much of it feels like a Ghostface stand in
---
That's why. It's just a bug where you don't own the DLC so it'll keep spitting those offerings at you
---
The survivors weren‚Äôt that good
---
honestly love playing against Demo because of how good it's chase/TR music is and how it's actually a little scary sometimes
---
Doctor is not a strong killer. The game takes practice and patience to learn, there are a lot of great killer guides you can do research on. The game is more strategy than chasing survivors. Also, try playing as survivor to understand what their next move is. 
---
Once you get a good killer with good perks and some skill, you‚Äôll really see a difference.
---
That's selfish.
---
Yeah but he let the feng unhook twice, which was preventable as he stood too close to the hook so was stunned and downed the feng too late both times. Just a really bad killer.
---
I'm still gonna DC on Mori's IDGAF
---
1.Swamp
---
2.Swamp
---
3. Hawkins
---
4.Swamp
---
5. Any fuckin swamp map
---
So you're a green rank but have the hours of a red rank and are trying to flex? LOL boi.
---
On PS4 though? I dunno, I feel like after one game you would know.
---
What makes you think that? I mean, the only one i thought was kind of weak is the Nea.
---
Depends if you're playing killer or survivor
---
Oh I thought you were PC my b
---
1. Any of the farm maps
---
2. Haddonfield
---
3. Azarovs resting place
---
4. Iron works of misery
---
5. Mothers dwelling or Temple of purgation
---
Dog killer when BHVR
---
Too bad isn't whataboutism. It's a counterargument, something you have no clue what does it mean apparently
---
And that's how you kill your already toxic playerbase 101
---
1: Coldwind 2: Coldwind 3: Coldwind 4: Coldwind 5: Coldwind
---
cool, if you ever want some advice, im much better at advice in party chats. psn is nightshard507
---
All variations of swamp and all variations of red forest. Fuckin hate em with a burning passion.
---
Seems like a better Dark Devotion, not sure if it should be this strong.
---
If the survivors were good they wouldn‚Äôt be healing against a legion... also they spent way way too much time looking for the third seal they should‚Äôve just ignored it. And a lot of them made really dumb plays in the chases.
---
I'm not saying being a toxic clicky clicker, it's just if you're clicking the flashlight while you exit it keeps it on behind your back ans gets used up.
---
That‚Äôs how I imagine 100% of Bubba mains are when playing
---
I take it you play mostly killer. Coldwind maps are probably the strongest for survivors.
---
*Give them the data*
---
Oh and DLCs necessary:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Survivor:
---
* IMO Feng Min is the easiest survivor to start with, as you are less punished for failing generator skill checks, and can see the killer easilly
---
* Most of the best survivor perks are in the free characters, but Laurie Strode could be good for Decisive Strike
---
Killer:
---
* IMO the Clown is the easiest killer to start with, his power makes it easy to end loops
---
* Leatherface and Hag have the 2 essential perks, BBQ &amp; Chilli and Hex: Ruin
---
I haven‚Äôt done it more than once but I used an offering to play as the pig. I already owned her and had perks in place for her. The match I used the offering to play as her I did have the perks I had slotted on her already. I haven‚Äôt done it twice to confirm.
---
This is gonna get removed because it‚Äôs oversaturated and honestly no one cares. People are rude, we know. We‚Äôre all playing the same game trust me *we know*.
---
One whole second to DC
---
I guess you're right, but i realised they were very altruistic so i tried to capitalize on that as much as possible.
---
Gotta love Zimbabwe bubba
---
People are complaining that they aren‚Äôt doing much when working on gens, and you‚Äôre suggesting to make them more boring. Noice.
---
Isn‚Äôt like a 30 second penalty
---
If you ‚Äúwalk everywhere‚Äù you‚Äôre using sprint burst wrong
---
You cant (easilly) buy characters with in-game currency, but you can buy their perks
---
Ya that makes sense.
---
I feel he just doesn't fit in with the game. Most killers create panic or some kind of worry when I go against them. I never feel afraid or stressed playing him, just annoyed and bored. I can't stand playing as him either. As soon as I got his specific trophy he will never be played again.
---
You son of a bitch I‚Äôm out. Genrush time
---
just played a game as rank 3 and my teammates were 19,16 and 7.
---
the rank 3 piggy was confused as well
---
It should be maybe 3/4/5 seconds I think cause that seems pretty powerful
---
But you are right about the coldwon, especially the coldwon it seems legit that the coldwon would be that long
---
I can see voices *hears a chainsaw as the game starts*
---
Or don‚Äôt run perks that don‚Äôt synergize together
---
Really Legion's power needs to be completely reworked similar to Freddy. (Give him a brand new power.)
---
I love Legion's visual design but his gameplay mechanics have just been impossible to balance without him being very strong, or useless.
---
*Hillbilly has joined the chat*
---
That makes sense, thank you
---
This is literally the worst shrine I've ever seen since I started playing Dead by Daylight.
---
Plus rebooting the game/console will probably take longer than the ban would.
---
why do some people got DS to work before being hooked? i have been watching youtubers that use this perk and they have it available all the time
---
* Survivor:
---
1. Lery's.
---
2. Swamp 1.
---
3. Swamp 2. 
---
4. Yamaoka 1
---
5. Yamaoka 2 
---
Lery's being the most hated. I can even throw in a sixth map for free, Hawkins.
---
* Killer:
---
1. Lery's
---
2. Yamaoka 1.
---
3. Yamaoka 2. 
---
4. Haddonfield. 
---
5. Hawkin's.

Sry for 5 posts?
---
Let‚Äôs not forget about object. The level of sweat needed to beat a good swf with an OoO is insane
---
Yeah, you're right
---
The design concept behind skill checks is to tax your attention to anticipate one signal while watching for another (the Killer). The idea is to create a sense of ongoing tension to create suspense and risk, which is one of the fundamental elements that makes it a horror game. Just sitting there would be much less risky and engaging and would remove a lot of the mood of the game
---
Please go delete all of your other posts, there's like 5 or so lol.
---
Ive wasted over 10 medkits on this because people want to use self care or their own medkits
---
FUCK. IM TOO FAR AWAY
---
Well, did you say yes?
---
You people will complain about literally anything huh.
---
dark devotion its longer and less cooldown, but you have to work for it.
---
Me too
---
Do you have a video of someone using it?
---
It isn't just you.
---
Lol we tried this with baby dweets and we got shredded XD
---
Is there also a penalty when you press alt+F4?
---
Otz is our lord and savior
---
The stats they released were interesting and I've always felt Bubba wasnt as bad as people say. He's performing fine at high ranks. 
---
He's like the opposite of legion. The hardest thing in the game isn't getting up to survivors the first time, it's the giant speed boost and stun that happens when you hit someone.
---
If a leatherface gets up to someone with monitor and abuse it's over. And because of that, I've always been pleasantly surprised playing him at high ranks.
---
yea maybe, so you have to calculate how far away of a gen are ya
---
Way to combat campers tutorial:
---
Step 1: do gens
---
Step 2: profit
---
If your Internet sucks so bad that your dcing over five times in one day, you might wanna hop onto some single player games for a while. This is always a complaint when leaver penalties are implemented, but i frankly think it's a moot point.
---
If you think about it, there is literally no difference to your teammates from a lag out and a rage quit. You've still made the game less fun for everybody involved, it just happens to not necessarily be your fault. You still deserve to be punished for leaving early. And again, the first few punishments are pretty negligible, meaning unless your playing in an underground Starbucks, you shouldn't get more than a few minutes wait.
---
I understand some people don't have access to stable internet, but does that mean i have to play with Dr. Disconnect because "it's not my fault I'm lagging"? What were you doing before the penalties were implemented? Dropping out of games left and right due to connection issues? I think ANY disconnect short of server issue on BHVRs side should be punished equally.
---
I don‚Äôt get why people repost their memes like five times. is it really that hard to get through auto-moderator or are you just dumb?
---
Also dude I would 1000% get that raven one
---
Your first mistake was not saying, "no u". (Jk)
---
In all seriousness, I have my messages turned off. I can't get over the amount of shit people send to each other on this game and I'm not about to subject myself to it. When I first started playing the game I'd get all kinds of messages that made me not want to improve or bother to play anymore. Took a year break and came back and closed my messages off.

rrrrrrrreeeeeeeeEEEEEEEE√âEEEEEE√ãEEEEE√àEEEEEEEƒíEEEEEEEEEE√äEEEEEEEEEEEƒñEEEEEEEEEEƒòEEEEEEEEEEE

https://youtu.be/gv2bElLrx0Y 2:56. He hasn‚Äôt got the timer on the perk, so does he has it available all the time? (in the video its showed more than once and in different games, for example 3:21, 3:40, 4:14, etc)
---
Yeah sorry I didn't notice I reposted  until I actually looked at my homepage
---
a swf on haddonfield and they complain about a clown, not surpirsed tbh.
---
are we officially cross-console yet or is this something that hasn't happened? I feel like I remember bhvr bringing it up?
---
It could do you some good but I think it's a big gamble. Most of the time you'd hit them and then swap targets so they're not gonna need to go for pallet stuns into flashlight or anything they can just run across the map and start mending. Good survivors are also not gonna hide without mending and are probably just gonna loop you.
---
In my opinion dirty knife or the legion pin with an add on for increased frenzy duration would be better
---
i hate this type of newbies

---
If any killer deserves a second chance, its her. (and maybe Susie)
---
Maybe you have a point. I was being kind of an ass.
---
Should add that continuous play of the game will gain you shard currency, in which you can use in the Shrine of Secrets to purchase teachable perks. I feel like not enough survivors utilize this awesome feature
---
Survivor Perks:
---
Up the Ante (Ace Visconti)
---
Open Hand (Ace Visconti)
---
Hang Mans Trick (Pig)
---
Brutal Stregnth (Trapper)

you can try r/LeaksByDaylight
---
don't know why you got downvoted, its a legit question
---
I topped out at about rank 3 as a survivor, most of the killers I faced couldn't do much about strong loops tbh. I spent most of the game pounding out gens. The only games that felt remotely dangerous were against nurse or spirit.
---
hawkins showed me and many others that maybe the map design for previous maps wasnt so bad after all
---
You should really grow up, no need to cry over someone not liking your game. Sincerely reconsider how much of a manchild you are, Internet points are not everything :D
---
Infectious fright*
---
‚ÄúOr just make it go away‚Äù haha sorry dont mean to be rude but that was kinda funny
---
Is there something weird going on with sound? Almost impossible to play killer
---
srry don‚Äôt use it that often
---
The only perk worth getting here is ''Brutal Strength''. Others aren't really worth anything.. ah well, easy 150,000 BP per perk.
---
30 minutes? Where do you live?
---
[There you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dqtqx9/guide_console_controllers/)
---
Oh hey guys. WE GOT BRUTAL STRENGTH AGAIN
---
i want ace visconti to kiss me on the lips
---
same. there isn't really a strategy. we just just kinda wing it. ive had some games where i never even used my ability.
---
*laughs in Deerstalker Huntress*
---
If Ash is without his weapon, he usually just runs for it.
---
Brutal Strength is a decent perk. It doesn't work well with your play style as Hag, but it's still decent.
---
Then play a different game? I would hate to see how some of DBD's survivors would react to being spawn peeked in R6 Siege. If slugging wasn't meant to be part of the game then Deerstalker, Flip Flop, Unbreakable, and Tenacity wouldn't exist.
---
1) 60 seconds
---
2) ???
---
3) 30 minutes
---
4) 1 hour
---
5) 2 hours
---
6) 6 hours
---
From what I can tell the lockout isn‚Äôt that long. 
---
It should be 60 seconds after the first DC. And then should double after every following DC. 
---
So at first you wait 1 minute: then 2, turn 4, then 8, the. 16, then 32 minutes
---
This is an old video before it was nerfed
---
Nah, plenty of people care since these posts are frequent. If you don't like it you don't have to say "no one cares" just report it and go on lol.
---
You should be happy it pretty amazing
---
No she didn't.
---
had the same issue, i enabled true full screen in the config files https://youtu.be/RoPOiaSLXms
---
What exactly should I be doing to (more) consistently rank up as both killer and survivor?  I know the thresholds needed to get a pip and especially get a double pip get harder as you get closer to red ranks, but what are the things I should be doing each game to get points in the four emblem categories?  I get a lot of games where I think I did good/decent and only black pipped, especially as I'm getting closer to red now for the first time as survivor (currently at rank 5, everytime I get to 4 I have huge difficulty getting pips).  
---
And related to that, I'd especially like to a thorough breakdown on what you need to do to get Merciless as a killer, since it's a requirement for the adept killer achievements and I'm struggling with that for the Oni currently.
---
I think dcing is.
---
You honestly believe disconnecting is some sort of retaliation?  It's ragequitting.  Don't try to package it as not being toxic.
---
Dark devotion let's you sneak up on survivors and get an early first hit, if you can down them in that first hit, that is pretty huge in terms of game pressure.
---
I just got a ban because I was forced to shut down the game through task manager due to being stuck in an infinite loading screen. Literally never had this bug before, now I've had twice in one day.
---
Sounds like a sandbox of fun. Not a sweaty competition once you hit green ranks and up, because greens seem to get matched with reds anyway because great matchmaking. I try to stay yellow ranks. Good balance of fun and interesting
---
BBQ will multiply the amount of points you get at the end of the game depending on how many hooks you got. Distressing will only help you get points faster. It will not increase the maximum blood points you can get, just increase the rate you get them in the deviousness category.
---
You really couldn't have cropped it huh?
---
Did u seriously just ask what it matters when a game thats balanced to have 4 players play against 1 suddenly becomes a 3 against 1? I tell you what it matters it will most likely become a boring match for both sides, and especially frustrating for survivors sind they are at the disadvantage and lose their rank and points.
---
Love that art, but, as much as it hurts to say, Krampus wouldn‚Äôt be a good killer. The fact is, Krampus isn‚Äôt a killer. He‚Äôs a punisher. He ties naughty children up in bags and beats them with sticks until they learn their lessons, then he lets them go. No strings attached. 
---
Also, Krampus only visits children, so...
---
It has been done
---
I've said it once I'll say it again, I'm not sure a bbq stack or two is worth longer queue times from people deciding the game isn't worth playing.
---
I get 35 min killer queue
---
Nay, if not bravery then hubris.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll leave it be then.
---
Seems that should be pretty easy
---
All the salty survivors are in the DC penalty box
---
By rank 15 my killer games went pretty much instantly during good hours.
---
isnt this a repost tho
---
&gt;What I‚Äôm saying is that I haven‚Äôt been on Dead by Daylight for the past like two to three weeks, theres no need to be an ass to someone who has stuff to do.
---
My initial reply wasn't being an ass but people take a simple "google exists" as offense so w/e. This sub is full of people that can't use a search tool or at least do a quick look at major changes that are often very highlighted in multiple platforms, including in-game when you open it for the first time after a patch has been deployed.
---
Also, this patch was deployed over 2 weeks ago. If you can't take 5 minutes to read the main changes listed on the patch notes because it would get in the way of your finals, what are you doing on DBD's subreddit? Isn't that much worse?
---
Just play survivor for a while so you derank
---
Link to original, I dont wanna upvote this if its stolen
---
I mean I literally just dead body it anytime I‚Äôm the last survivor, the points are very negligible and you‚Äôre basically not getting away.
---
You put it in *words*
---
You're... completely stupid.  People DC because people rage.  
---
I can already garuntee you are newer to the game than me, and likely worse ranked as a survivor.
---
Very good, however you should have made him where his cosmetic with his thicc nips.
---
Killers act the same way if a survivor teabags. I've seen someone say on this sub that teabaggers should 'rot in hell'.
---
This happens to me on PS4 every now and then
---
Right in the giggle muscle.
---
Truuuue
---
I do this with my boyfriend! Boyfriends are the best haha.
---
The reason for it is that he has very little he can do to injured survivors, and healing the entire game, is, well, boring.
---
You should be able to stab people again using your power while they are injured.... Otherwise, it is just super counterintuitive and punishes you for using your own power.
---
Of course, it must be balanced somehow, but yeah...
---
The body is perfect
---
The ones you're not controlling would just stand idle.
---
Gotcha thanks. In a way I can see why they would be mad because they essentially were running only 3 perks. But yeah least it's not prayer breads.
---
Hopefully moris get a nerf.
---
Ok but I see far more keys (that can also be found in the trials) than moris
---
Both make the game shorter than it should be. The difference is just you can also use a key and escape even if you did nothing the whole game while you have to win 2 chase and hit the survivors at least 3 times before using a Mori to a single player
---
But I guess using logic isn't your forte since you find this whataboutism for no reason but to give an easy excuse to counter an argument you cannot engage with. That's a you problem my guy
---
no such thing as 'gen rushers' just survivors playing the game.
---
If you do it you are a piece of shit
---
I honestly had high hopes when they said he was getting reworked but then they just turned him into an even worse version of an overall bad killer design.
---
They need to completely overhaul him in my opinion.
---
I'm afraid you're wrong. With several party streamers or a survivor pudding and BBQ you can get a lot more than 32k + 100%.
---
Hmm yes. If they follow the youtuber apology cliche then their fans say it wasnt that bad then it‚Äôs fine. It only happened on camera once so its ok. Lemme just yeet this toddler across the room as long as it doesnt look to bad and i apologize its fine.
---
I went against a trapper last night and one of our teammates was AFK. Trapper finds him pretty quick and smacks him down. I came over and teabagged the down guy and then ran away because well, memes. Trapper takes this as a signal to start farming and goes and starts smacking the gen. Team comes over and starts farming with him. Downed guy comes back to his computer and sees them farming and joins in. And the whole time I'm just standing there like "THIS ISN'T WHAT I HAD IN MIND!!" Oh well, free bloodpoints.
---
He‚Äôs just excited for rise of skywalker
---
Just seems like tru3 being tru3
---
Or DBD server disconnects someone from the start. I got disconnected frequently since I picked up the game again last week.
---
8000x4 = 32,000. 4 stacks of BBQ &amp; a BPS/pudding will put that at 96,000.  If all 4 survivors also put in BPS (unlikely at R20) puts the absolute maximum at 192,000.
---
If people are going to decide the game isn‚Äôt worth playing because they can‚Äôt DC and would have to actually play the game- I‚Äôm good with this. I‚Äôd rather have a longer queue then enable rage quitting whiner baby teammates.
---
Contragulation
---
You done it
---
Then they say I tunneled when they wear the same shit.
---
Might be. I heard after 6 hours it's 24 hours. I doubt they'll use an automatic system to perma but the penalties probably rack up to like a week ban.
---
What are the survivor perks?
---
It‚Äôs crazy how difficult it can be to have a discussion without resorting to attacking the other person‚Äôs intelligence. I apologize if you were offended by my whataboutism comment but I was attacking the argument, not you personally.
---
Yes, keys can be used to escape without doing much. The same can be said about just running theough exit gates. That‚Äôs not a point against keys; that‚Äôs an issue with a 1 v 4 game. Of course there‚Äôs going to be some survivors carrying others. That just makes it difficult for the one‚Äôs doing work.
---
Here‚Äôs where moris far exceed the scope of keys: the conditions for a mori are far easier to achieve than the conditions for a key. All it takes is one hook and a tunnel to completely cripple the other side. Might take a minute or two from the start of the match.
---
Compare that to the what it takes for the hatch to spawn. Survivors need to work on the objective enough such that the number of gens completed is one more than the survivors remaining.
---
I just saw it so its not removed
---
If you read that second post they are asking for it to be removed because there is no point for either side they are not complaining... the first one... you can‚Äôt fix some people complaining I guess haha
---
Pretty sure the prices are jacked up to compensate for the larger rewards.
---
Yeah its unfun to play against, go against, and how you feel when you use it but if I see 3 toolboxes a d a key at red ranks they getting some toxic sludge.
---
That's like saying that "tunneling" isn't a thing. Sure, I'd probably get more kills that way but ultimately the objective isn't to kill, it's to chase, stall, and injure.
---
The game is available in Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Australia, Philippines and Mexico as a beta. If you're not in these countries, you can use TapTap or QooApp to download it.
---
Can we get this to infinite downvotes
---
I gotta admit I think the perk would be too op for killers that can cover a lot of ground really fast and for killers who can potentially one shot. If the effect timer is lower it might be more balanced.
---
Wut. How is this a repost? It‚Äôs a completely different caption.
---
Well the objective of survs is to escape and doing generators leads to that. If u arnt getting chases then gens are what u should do to achieve that goal.
---
I was about to post this üò≠ I bought a mug and a tshirt for my husband on 12/07 . I have an order number from my receipt but I never got sent an email, my card immediately got charged.
---
It said it was getting ready for shipment on 12/09, FROM LATVIA!!!! No updates since üò≠üò≠üò≠ I really need it before christmas
---
P.S. I have opened 2 tickets with no response:(
---
Thomas had never seen so much bullshit before
---
Hey just checking if anything happened with your order? I ordered on 12/07 and I haven't received updates yet :(
---
Pallet / Window hits is just latency / ping.
---
Don't know whats the deal with DS.
---
Hello new wall paper
---
As a Claudette main who plays Medic Support and Gen Duty, I get so sad when my teammates leave me for dead on First Hook. Like.....Kindred is on my dudes! üíÄüò≠üòπ
---
Hahahaha! It is if you think about it this way. What killer would actually hit someone then run to someone else and then someone else? It is pretty goofy.
---
Nice flair
---
Guys let me know :( I ordered something 10 days ago and still havent heard anything. I refreshed my confirmation page and it gave a tracking number from freaking Latvia!?
---
The comment or post? ü§î
---
Hahahahhaa &lt;3
---
i love the legions lore and design.. too bad they have the most absolute shit power in the game..
---
In game I see Spirit as the Nea of killers
---
Hes tryina get on the tru hate train i guess
---
This actually happened to me not too long ago. Maybe I was the survivor you did this too. :D
---
lol cant wait for infinite loading screens to make their return and ppl get fucked for dcing while in one
---
i think this is the only time i've ever emotionally identified with a billy
---
If Riot, the makers of the largest game on the planet, cant dicern from a crash or internet cut out, and actually leaving the game, neither can BHVR.
---
This is kinda blowing up so Im gonna plug my shit

It doesn't fix the issue and anyone saying "its better when they off themselves on first hook!" is delusional.
---
I feel you there
---
Some people are being offensive but some people are also just waiting to give you the last hit. Either way though you shouldn't let anyone get the best of ur mood especially with the touch of a button. It's so easy to just walk away from the exit and their "offensive behaviour" to me it's judt them celebrating they did good. Even if you farm with them and do something nice theyll t-bag in a good manner so just dont let that simple animation get to you bruh.
---
I‚Äôve only been playing for the past month but I always get him through the window and pallet I just thought that‚Äôs how it is lol
---
Cool
---
Nah i just thought the dude looked like Logic lmao, didnt realize it was the dude from The Office
---
How about useful add-ons?
---
Bahahahahha ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Lol that 225k in your screenshot is how many BP you have total, not what you earned in that one match. You did though get 88k in that match.
---
His friend made it.
---
lol
---
Most people assume that the tradeoff would be that they add more objectives and then reduce the generator time. I don't know why you didn't pick up on that.
---
I just played a game where when legion picked me up she kept on swinging her M1 repeatedly, was there a reason for this? Or just her just doing random stuff? I coulda swore my wiggling was being weird during this but I mean, i guess it coulda been me? Just thought it was odd.
---
Oh shit what up gurl.
---
Myers with Nemesis, Dark Devotion, and the addon for faster stalking on the obsession is fun, in particular. Evil just flows.
---
Scuff Controller + 100% sensitivity and it is pretty much the same as on pc
---
I did. Do you mean on the ps4 settings? Cause my dbd sensitivity is 100
---
A: ‚ÄúWatch out, B! It‚Äôs a tombstone Myers!!‚Äù
---
B: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a tombstone?‚Äù 
---
*loads into haddonfield*
---
Honestly most of the game‚Äôs killers are takes of unfortunate tragedies that lead to corruption. Just look at the wraith, the hillbilly, the legion but not Frank, the nurse, the spirit, the huntress or the plague and probably some others that I can‚Äôt name off the top of my head.
---
Aw! My boyfriend and I have been playing dbd together since last Christmas on his PS4. I do survivor and he does both. One day I‚Äôll try killer but it‚Äôs fun seeing him wreck a group.
---
The "I'll take my cheating elsewhere, thank you" argument never really holds water. If anything, more people get frustrated with quitters and stop playing. We'll probably see queue times shorten in the long run.
---
Did not expect suite life here, a surprise to be sure , but a welcome one.
---
Truly, it's like one of the best perks for me at least.
---
According to Benedict Baker‚Äôs journal entry on Nea, it sounds like she was supposed to be a stealthy character.
---
 I nearly always find a match in lies than a minute as a killer.
---
There used to be a bug where you moved faster doing that with a certain perk... I can't remember if thats still in, but if not it was probably just having some fun with that perk
---
 Then You‚Äôre all dead 10 seconds later
---
Fuck that‚Äôs incredible work!!
---
Tell your friend... GOOD BOY/GIRL
---
a sight too familiar ): might as well have NOED
---
The entity should probably make better choices than people known for killing
---
What up!
---
Always check or ask the Killers on their location and ping, on their end it probably looks fine, on yours it does not.
---
An example I can say this is I was at 120-130ms on US servers (I live in the UK) and I was playing Huntress, all my hits looked perfectly fine with no BS hits, at least on my screen it was like that...
---
Turns out the enemy team thought I was hacking because my hachets on their end were curving around walls, corners and even sometimes through big ass boxes.
---
So ask their region and latency at the end and see what happens.
---
Lol DBD is a game where you can get stuck in place unable to move for the entire game, get trapped in trapper traps infinitely, be unable to snap out of it against doctor and be effectively useless, and more. All it‚Äôs gonna do is punish people who experience game breaking bugs while people who actually DC will just kill themselves on hook.
---
Spirit has the potential to be in the stealthy list since she can get people by surprise by just popping up on a gen and grabbing them
---
The thought came across my head, I quickly dismissed it when I thought people would assume it doesn‚Äôt fix the problem. What is being implied is say make a generator 60 seconds rather than 80. So what happens when it takes 2 minutes to find a part, or 5 seconds to find a part? Now you‚Äôre stuck with the game either being too long or too short, not to mention that perks like prove myself or toolboxes can add on to the madness completely skewing  the. Games. Design. It‚Äôs not fixing the problem, it‚Äôs only putting a bandage on it to cover it up, trying to compromise instead of really digging down to the core mechanics of the game and find the issue.
---
super cool
---
What do you mean you can't get it on her? Have you gotten all the other perks for Nancy and Bl still isn't showing up?
---
It just takes a while if you have alot of other teachable yet to unlock on her. Took me forever to get sprint burst on nea to
---
Rng is rng
---
I do this with my crippling loneliness! I'm glad we all have somebody to share the game with, that makes it much more fun!
---
it does :)
---
"DCING INTENSIFIES"
---
looks pretty cool, i like it
---
Doesn't look like it to me. 
---
He could've had botany on,  or they could've had unbreakable which gets them ready to be picked up faster or they can pick themselves up. You easily downed him,  so I'm confused on what you're seeing lol.
---
What rank are you?
---
A casual mode would just be a shitshow. Brand new players being matched with experienced players that just stomp their faces in.
---
You'd HATE IT as solo survivor.
---
&gt;I shouldn't be forced to stay in a match where I am purposely being bullied by the other side.
---
Casual mode won't prevent this. In fact it will be more likely to run into people way better than you since now there isn't a ranking system keeping you two separated.
---
&gt;no Rank and purely played for fun
---
You honestly think people wouldn't sweat their asses in that mode for the power trip? I was seeing ebony mori omegablink nurses on rank resets, people don't care.
---
No the game would be infinitely worse. The amount of abuse that would be screamed because now they can. Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo thank you
---
1. The new map, I don't know the exact name, but the one with the oni
---
How did you make it? Was it sort of traced or hand drawn
---
Or just play yui and kill yourself on hook, the sound she makes when she goes ti struggle is the same as pig getting stunned tbh-
---
I think he beat you to the pallet very quickly but wouldnt say he was cheating. Healing maybe he was running perks for heals
---
WOW. I should have said that too in the post. I‚Äôm a rank 7 right now, rank 1 consecutively for over a year lol.
---
Aww gg!
---
This game is not stable enough to have a penalty system for DCs right now. Not when you still have bugs that force people to leave the game and also game mechanics that aren't the most fun to experience. It's good that they are doing testing on it, but we are still far away from reaching that state where it's ideal to implement something like this.
---
Gotta go fast.
---
Like always.. that's sad
---
What is he looking at me on the other side of the pallet for, instead of breaking it?
---
*Myers Tier 3 Music*
---
Only way to get better is by learning. Also hiding, not having a decent chase and not taking your two hook states can hurt your team in the end
---
It really is
---
like sure, I'm the asshole in the room but I'm sincerely tired of seeing an unfunny joke plastered all over this subreddit.
---
Am ghostface player, can confirm. There is no in between. If I feel bad and the survivors weren't toxic, I'm letting them go. If they teabag, death time
---
Gross. Remove Legion.
---
Is it really frowned upon on here to ask for someone to play with?
---
I think it‚Äôs awesome that BHVR is implementing a DC-Penalty system. But most times DC‚Äôs are situational and I find people only want to do it maybe once per day. Not every single match. How will you punish a player like that? Give them a ten second penalty for disconnecting once? Oh woopsy! He filled out his daily quota of DC‚Äôing for the day, ‚Ä¢10 second penalty.
---
I hope that BHVR‚Äôs DC penalty system will look at the users playing game as a whole, and hopefully if it notices a pattern (say, a player DC‚Äôs twice every day) then it will do something about it, not simply punish a player for DC‚Äôing on the spot.
---
Yeah, totally not suggesting an idea to prevent disconnecting...
---
Im really glad they at least fixed the damn "stuck in a gen after kicking it" bug that I was getting every 2nd game. 
---
If that was still in the game I'd be on 24 hour timeout rn.
---
&gt;or you are slugged to bleed out
---
I really wish they gave survivors a forefit option for a situation like that. I sometimes legit lose track of my slugs and the poor guy has to bleed out while I'm running like a headless chicken trying to find him.
---
Try and complain enough for them to hear. There are plenty of things in the game that need fixing.
---
It's just one more problem with the game. DCing is far worse than slugging is, and needs to be fixed or punished.
---
Slugging is just a DIFFERENT part of the game that needs to be fixed.
---
This idea that people have, that they should be able to ruin the game for everyone else because they don't like an aspect of the match, is just so entitled and absurd. If you don't have time to play out an entire match, don't join a lobby. Don't join up and then think you can just DC out the second you start losing or the killer doesn't play exactly how you want.
---
The amount of people DCing because they are being slugged is INCREDIBLY small. The vast majority of DCs in the 100s of games I've played over the past few weeks were on the FIRST DOWN.
---
Does Freddy have a 32 meter or 16 meter TR?
---
I sent them a request to contact me on their support page and I haven‚Äôt heard anything still. Kind of annoying. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift but I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs going to arrive at all.
---
The loading screens are still here, they never left. And yes, you do get punished for those, fun.
---
Like I said it's not a repost, it's probably very similar, but unlike all of us she doesn't look at reddit memes it's not like she knew
---
It would help if you show the perks the David had...Seems like We'll make it
---
Drawn, but heavily influenced by something else I saw. Cant find it to give that guy credit though :/
---
I wish legion was good, I want to main them but nice artwork nonetheless
---
Open handed and Up the ante
---
I am having some problems with health, study and depression, because of which I didn‚Äôt even have had enough time to complete Oni's renders before release :(
---
I hope I'll have some spare time on next week for all of planned renders
---
I'm on Xbox, sorry homie.
---
He was doing adept
---
20 more seconds in a 3v1 game yeeeeeeeeeeeeah boi.
---
exactly man üòÇ
---
No worries dude. Your own health is the most important thing. If you feel stressed about it, just leave it. It‚Äôs not that important. Wish you well for everything!
---
Which leads the discussion back to game design. Don‚Äôt punish the game for having gens be too fast, try to improve upon it. I do agree that this applies in red ranks but it doesn‚Äôt apply for every single game, and as DBD‚Äôs average game time is 11 minutes, it definitely doesn‚Äôt apply for DBD as a whole. The gens speed is an issue of game design, so don‚Äôt punish the game by forcing it to be longer and more dragged out, instead, try to make it more enjoyable.
---
Same! I placed the order (one shirt and one mug) on 12/7, got charged immediately, never received an email. I've opened 2 support tickets and have not heard anything yet. It was my Christmas present for my husband :(
---
BULL SHIT.
---
I've been constantly talking to the killer mains on this subreddit about how SURVIVORS get the shorter end of the stick because of DCs, and I'm not going to stop now.
---
3 people 5 gens favors the killer HEAVILY. Two people DCing means you're going to depip, but unless you also DC, the killer is going to safety from fucking you up easily because the game can't go any other way.
---
Where are you even getting this narrative? It sounds like you're one of these entitled fucks ruining the game for everyone else. If you can't play the game, don't queue up, you don't deserve to be able to DC and jump into your next game leaving us to fucking rot with our shit bloodpoints and our depip.
---
Thanks so much :3
---
I wish Legion's gameplay was as cool as this artwork
---
Legion and ghostface also get id'd if they use their ability on anyone
---
They added a nom sound effect when he put the fingers on his mouth now-
---
Ebony Mori Intensifies...
---
Yay a penalty for not wanting to sit in a 3 gen hostage doc game.
---
Very cool!
---
yea maybe 5/6/7 seconds?
---
Killing yourself on hook is better than DCing as you get downed, or before you even get to the hook. Literally for everyone else involved it's better. That's ALSO a problem, but just something else that needs to be addressed.
---
In your situation you can DC and eat the timer, or you can sit around and wait for a new game, either way you're waiting for a new game. Your example isn't even remotely the norm, like so much so that it's basically a straw man.
---
You know damn well people are DCing on first down because they're salty they didn't get 3 gens done before being found, or because they "were found first." 
---
Your example doesn't even have anything to do with solving anything.
---
they cant stalk
---
Every game people are doing this?  People shouldn‚Äôt all have the same challenge so.  I mean I just play hard for the unhooks and heal using empathy.  Didn‚Äôt know it was really difficult.
---
Rank 1 survivor before this last reset, here‚Äôs what I got:
---
If you really wanna pip most games, always be mindful of what you have done in a game. For example:
---
‚ÄúOkay I did 2 gens and got chased for a little bit, so I could probably start getting some altruism points and maybe get in a chase. Oh look a dull totem I‚Äôll cleanse that for objective points since I‚Äôm here.‚Äù 
---
Just think about what you have done each game. Also unsafe unhooks KILL altruism. So I run borrowed time to guarantee a safe hook and altruism is super easy to get iridescent. 
---
Here‚Äôs my perk setup:
---
Borrowed Time for the safe unhooks.
---
We‚Äôll make it because more time healing means less time doing something else.
---
Iron Will cause you gotta have it at red ranks imo.
---
And BOND! Bond is amazing, you find people to heal/heal you, you won‚Äôt run across the map for an unhook just to see your teammates take the save when you could have just stayed on the gen, and you just have so much relevant information on what is happening around you. 
---
So those are my tips. Altruism is super easy to get iridescent so shoot for that and get your safety pip so you don‚Äôt get set back. Good luck
---
No shit Sherlock, nobody has ever suggested it to make the game more unique, only to make it longer because generators go so fast.
---
Only if you see the fountain or traps which is not guaranteed compared to chainsaws/screams/global notifications.
---
The pallet thing is what I'm more confused, it's like a sprint burst but he didn't have it and it was way to long for a sprint burst
---
Doesn't matter in this case as his dream demon ability is seen right from the start in the player status.
---
Do you just post things without reading that other 20+ people posted the exact same thing in less than a day?
---
It took me forever to kill my obsession 4 times.
---
DC is OP!
---
Her base kit makes her distinctive whoosh very apparent and she has a terror radius when not phasing.
---
The stalk isnt the good part of his ability.
---
It's useful, but not nearly as good as the ability to turn off the terror radius.
---
The coolest Daniel should be tenacity no mither
---
Lvl 3 drug addict
---
We play on console (Xbox) and I must admit. She is wayyy better than me.
---
No lol took maybe a 2 month hiatus?  On and off. I promise. I‚Äôm not a shitty player lol.
---
Gen rushing exists, but it‚Äôs intentionally letting your teammates die on hook to finish gens.
---
Yes lol.
---
The who whooer?
---
Well shit now i know not to ask here then. Have you tried the dbd ps4 community?
---
There's a perk that prevents the attack cool down when carrying someone and pauses wriggling after a hit.
---
But we all want to see a toxic survivor being beaten with a stick to death üê°ü•ï
---
I hope you realize the RNG behind that would take weeks/months to achieve. I‚Äôm not sure what you think I would benefit from that?
---
Free internet points obviously who doesn‚Äôt want those
---
The struggle button mashing is so redundant. 
---
I saw an interesting idea awhile ago that they should change the struggle phase so it gives you three random skill checks. If you hit the great skill check the sacrifice bar stops depleting for 5 seconds. If your hit the good skill check nothing happens. And if you miss the skill check the bar depletes a certain %. 
---
This means people can‚Äôt kill themselves but it still gives a reason to be engaged during second hook.
---
Dead hard is broken. Half of the time you dead hard into the ground. Probably the new dedicated servers. Pretty sure a lot of people are experiencing similar issues.
---
Too long to read
---
Kobe off hook = let them escape
---
Absolute dogshit shrine
---
Loaded into a game with 4 pink haired neas doing this I gave up as soon as 3 gens popped in the first 4 minutes
---
What if the killer or another survivor just bodyblocks you in a corner and refuses to move until you leave?
---
Well, it could be problem with ssd or hdd, because i too have low end hdd and it's freezing for half a second because game need to proceed and then show you exhaustion. Also lagging when i get hit threw dead hard.
---
Lucky new players should get this on all platforms
---
Welcome to dbd
---
I'd hang it on my wall forever :O
---
Boop the snoot
---
Choo choo, our next stop is locker.
---
Are they gonna fix grabs anytime soon? Either give me the grab or give me the swing, stop with this start a grab into nothing happening. FFS!
---
New Zealand too.

After I hook someone I look around to try and spot others with BBQ. So watch the killer after getting hooked. If the killer comes straight to you or another survivor after hooking s/he probably bbq'd.
---
NOED increases killer speed.
---
I bought Ace only for Ace in the hole and meme.
---
Don't be afraid to try out his fake palette add on. For too long I thought it would be useless until I started using it and it's absolutely amazing. You can just walk around placing them while you're patrolling and when a Survivor runs through one while you're chasing them it's the greatest feeling in the world knowing that it's fake and you're going to smack them right through it.
---
The greater good must be served.  Toxic assholes DC happen much more frequently than all of the myriad of excuses i hear of "my computer crashed just as I was downed" bullshit.
---
It‚Äôs a bug
---
Here i am with the game wanting me to play damn nurse
---
If I pick one to live, their team are not exempt. You are the chosen one. Dont get in the way or become victim of the wrath of the entity
---
Do you know how he did It
---
dont drop the soap in the prison shower
---
1. Sanctum at the moment. Haven't played on it in a while so I dont know if the brightness has been changed but I'm too fuckin blind to play on that map.
---
2. Thompson House. Too many jungle gyms makes survivor boring and killer annoying.
---
3. Wretched Shop. Probably the only autohaven map I dislike.
---
4. Red Forest maps. So big.
---
5. Haddonfield. Houses arent as much a problem anymore but those long fences are still the worst designed thing in the game.
---
I have previously mentioned this killer as a candidate for Dead by Daylight, and I agree that it would be a wonderful crossover.
---
&gt;Edit: Also as an anecdote, I see far more ebony moris in my p3 killer bloodwebs compared to keys (both purple and pink) in my p3 survivors.
---
Ok since you said that I'm gonna really put effort on my reply. Not my fault if you did say dumb shit, just saying. let's see
---
&gt;It‚Äôs crazy how difficult it can be to have a discussion without resorting to attacking the other person‚Äôs intelligence
---
If somebody says something stupid I call that argument stupid. If you feel offend by that it's a you problem. An argument can be stupid but the person who said such thing might not be but just be influenced by external parties
---
&gt;I apologize if you were offended by my whataboutism comment but I was attacking the argument, not you personally.
---
Same
---
&gt;Yes, keys can be used to escape without doing much. The same can be said about just running theough exit gates. That‚Äôs not a point against keys; that‚Äôs an issue with a 1 v 4 game
---
Exactly. Still, is an item that can be found in bloodweb, protected for multiple uses and found in trials. Moris don't have this privilege and both have the same function. cut the game time by prematurely ending it through escape or death
---
The major difference is that keys are stronger and don't need to win chases to be activated.
---
&gt;Here‚Äôs where moris far exceed the scope of keys: the conditions for a mori are far easier to achieve than the conditions for a key.
---
Condition of keys: gens repaired and survivors alive
---
Condition for Mori: win chase 2 times (3hit minimum)
---
Gens are done in 80s. Games last for around 5-7min and chases can last a full minute depending on the maps taking into consideration a pair skill level between killer and survivor with normal chase. The only exception is Nurse
---
If both takes keys and Mori at the same trial, one death would mean 3 escapes through hatch fairly easily. The requirements of both are not the same since a classic chase for someone like trapper or GF can take a while if you focus on using Mori. On the other hand if you wanna use keys your playstyle won't change, you just do gens as usual
---
&gt;All it takes is one hook and a tunnel to completely cripple the other side. Might take a minute or two from the start of the match.
---
Yes. If 3 of em do fk all. Before the game even start you know a Mori is in play so you focus on doing gens asap. A minute is just to down a survivor unless said survivor is in a dead zone. Plus you have to take into consideration that people won't save immediately if a Mori is into play, why bother. Plus after the unhook it can take 30 extra seconds to down the survivor. More if BT is in play
---
30s are 1/3 of a gen and taking into consideration that both sides are equally skilled (high ranks between 3-1 in EU) it's a lot of time. Enough to do the fourth gen if 3 of em are in one gen. After that you just need to find the hatch to escape
---
It has variables of course, this is on a vacuum. Still, even being charitable it will result in 2 escapes and 2 deaths in the worse scenario in those ranks
---
&gt;Compare that to the what it takes for the hatch to spawn. Survivors need to work on the objective enough such that the number of gens completed is one more than the survivors remaining.
---
I'm not taking into consideration other things like Toolbox, bnp, prove thyself and so on to make gen go even faster. Isn't as hard as you make it to be, plus the fact that you can also drop it in trials and protect keys for multiple uses. Idk, maybe you're in America but in EU gens don't take that long to be completed, at all
---
The hatch needs 4 gens done if one survivor die. 3 gens are usually popped in the first chase in normal games, having some sort of a hurry seeing a Mori, it's not surprising it would cripple the killer more trying to focus on one at the time to make the Mori work.
---
You cannot pressure enough if you focus on that and if you try to play at best ignoring moris. Having 1 or 2 gens left when everybody has been hooked once isn't unlikely depending on map and killer. Classic chases doesn't work anymore and pressure is needed more than tunneling one single guy to Mori. If anyone do that in high ranks, he'll achieve 1 kill at best. Moris are strong but not as much as a single key, that can be brought, found and kept safe for 4 survivors
---
*recap* both are very strong and should be looked into but keys are hands down stronger than Mori. Can be used multiple times and the requirements are not a big issue in high ranks (and you should balance towards them in the first place). A Mori even if not fully used is being burnt anyway while a key can be saved if you survive
---
A key can be protected by add ons. Can let you escape after EGC or before every gen is popped if the requirements are met. Moris have one requirement, win chases. This single requirement isn't as easy as it sound since skilled people know how to deal with anyone and to catch them you have to capitalize on their mistakes and cheeky strategies that are risky
---
This is all in a vacuum as I said but I still see more upsides towards keys than Mori. I barely use Mori or see them for this reason. Are not as powerful since puts you in a bad mentality of tunneling which lead in a lost many times. By the time you kill one, 4 gens are popped and they are working on the fifth
---
I used more keys and seen around too since they are easily accessible and easy to protect. A decent team can escape through the hatch without any effort and as a solo you can hide 24/7 and escape. Something that cannot be performed by the killer that has to find you, chase you, hit you, chase again, hit again, hook you and repeat the process after unhook
---
I've seen few killer succeed with moris and mostly are Nurse and stealth killers that can avoid the first chase by catching people by surprise. Even then, if it's a SWF group that focus on escaoe, still unlikely to fully succeed. 
---
The insta heal Nerf on the other hand was really a good change. A proof of that is just looking back when they announced it. Every game had 4 insta heals and everybody could see how unbalanced that was, many players stopped to play killer completely during that time for obvious reasons
---
Plus insta heals are not really being nerfed since the purple add on still do the same thing as the old one, even better I would say since nullify insta down abilities too. Only the syringe is being nerfed heavily which was needed due to the double health state it had before
---
Mind game loops by walking backwards or sideways to hide or misdirect your red stain.
---
*cough* young ash *cough*
---
haha i never saw a picture of the live action Ash. he looks hilarious. that big chin. haha
---
Wow, the worst shrine yet
---
I do that all the time lol. I always imagine the survivor doing the surprised Pikachu face when I don't immediately leave after I Deep Wound them.
---
I break that one all the time...on purpose
---
Holy crap! He‚Äôs so manly in this picture. On streams he‚Äôs always cute and welcoming but here he‚Äôs mr steal yo girl.
---
You always Boop the snoot
---
Honestly that tier just seems odd, most of the killers can be ID‚Äôd in some way before they get near you which isn‚Äôt really related to stealtb. Its a different category than knowing the killers coming towards you before you hear the terror radius, which I think is just huntress for her whistling, billy and nurse only when they use their power for mobility, maybe Freddy for the gen teleport.
---
Sometimes I'll let them get super close and then kill them anyway...I'm evil like that }:‚Äë)
---
Pip? Who gives a fuck about piping? Just to get longer queue times? Or just to play against tryharders players? Survivors are getting nerfed back to back, like the red addons, while moris stay the same, instead of fixing the cause, they fix the sympton, like gens, you want to stop gen rushing? Give secondary objectives, but no, lets just make gens take longer and healing times painfully eternal, lets make it a M1 simulator, and i dont want to mention the fucking hitboxes that are shit since i can remember, but those things are fucking overlooked because they are busy nerfing Balanced Landing instead of reworkin the maps
---
Dude I think a Manhunt based killer and survivor would be awesome. Maybe Starkweather or Piggsy as a killer and James Earl Cash as a survivor.
---
He is in prison eating cockmeat sandwiches.
---
I did consider making a "stealthy with skill" but it only had her so I consolidated the categories.
---
Not normal.  Have you wiped display drivers with DDU yet?
---
Who ever did it is a legend at drawing
---
&gt; Who gives a fuck about piping
---
Who gives a fuck about killing, who gives a fuck about bloodpoints, who gives a fuck about playing.
---
Nice argument.
---
In game probably- what is this a house for midgets??
---
Alright, so how I had it. You want to edit the post if you haven‚Äôt already as that is not made very clear.
---
You aren't serving any greater good when the people who want to leave the match will just die on hook. The problem didn't get fixed at all but we are getting innocent people penalized.
---
&gt;"my computer crashed just as I was downed" bullshit.
---
You know those things actually happen, right? It's pretty unempathetic of you to just dismiss those who legitimately get penalized for the game not working properly.
---
RUN
---
I mean I know swf is frowned upon on this sub but I didn't realize it was THAT frowned upon
---
Myers ability also makes him faster, have a longer lunge range, gets him extra points, and can be activated more than once.
---
R/hmmmmm
---
Monster House
---
With a soldering iron or similar you could make your own, this is such minimal effort it's amazing.
---
Yea, ik that movie, but i remembered Haddonfield :)
---
Isn't it in the lore that mori is a permission to kill from the Entity? That's how I see it.
---
I think she is fun to go against you actually counter her differently than doing the same old pallet looping shit. How is she not fun to vs?
---
That's only for low ranks. Queue times are flipped in high ranks.
---
You sound like someone who DCs a lot
---
Mega OOF
---
I agree even though I already see the holes in his armor (power taking time to set up, only being able to possess for a limited time, only having 6 shots while possessed with no way to reload so once he's out he's out, bullets only travel in a straight line making them easy to juke just to name a few)
---
Ooooh I like it
---
Hahaha I love using Myers and just staring at people do gens than downing them
---
All games do this. If it‚Äôs PvP you have an MMR even if it‚Äôs not shown to you.
---
Well, bloodpoints actually does something positive...
---
Can I get some feedback on this comment:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eby6er/looks_like_dc_penalties_went_live/fb89jnb/?st=k4aw5gdt&amp;sh=19f55fe3
---
That was for testing purposes.
---
As a surv I only dc on slug, hard tunnel or when it's bugged out.
---
All I know is that his cat apparently kept coming back for more and it was apparently a joke. Cats are very agile. I don't want to see if the clip myself, but I'm 80 percent sure it's not actual abuse.

How long have you waited to get 3 challenges from the same character just to take a picture of it and post it?
---
I love this game but lately matchmaking has been an absolute shit show. I just played a 5 minute game against a rank 20 new billy. We had 1 afk for the first couple of minutes of the match and the rest of the match we gen rushed him. Outside of the all the other problems DbD might have this one is, in my opinion, an extremely serious problem. Matchmaking for killers can take ages and if new players that join get matched up against seasoned players they will have no will to continue to play this game. Especially if they sit in queue for 30 minutes and they end up playing against people who severely outrank them. This needs to be fixed.
---
A crash or an infinite loading screen every now and then might still be a bad thing with the dc penalties. We don't know what the decay rate is and how it works.
---
For example if you play every day and get get a crash once every 2 days it can rack up to heavy time outs easily if the decay is something that happens once every month. And the more you play the more of these errors you're likely gonna get.
---
I do hope they've tied the decay rate either into the amount of matches you play or the amount of minutes spent in a match. I do admit that it can lead to players just going afk and "farming" the decay. Maybe the devs have come up with something smarter.
---
Looks pretty normal that‚Äôs a good time limit per heal if you make no mistakes while healing
---
What do you mean i dont know? Ive seen this movie like 100 times as a kid
---
Because there is no counterplay to her power. You don‚Äôt get a notification for when she starts her power, which already starts of the 1v1 interaction badly. Yes you can walk, yes you can run Iron Will, but it doesn‚Äôt mean anything if she was ‚Äúmindgaming‚Äù you by standing still. It‚Äôs a guessing game. To me that isn‚Äôt what makes DBD fun. 
---
Also I actually find running a killer on jungle gyms fun and interactive. Pallet loops, not so much.
---
Isn‚Äôt there crossplay now?
---
So why was he arrested?
---
No, it was more like this when level 3 was just released
---
Frank be like: omg im turning into Shrek!
---
Because that‚Äôs what drinking can do my friend, you can get, toxic, happy, sad,depressed or horny I‚Äôve seen all lol.
---
How do you have so many teachables if you've been playing only a week?
---
they could add in the chainsaw hand but they'd have to completely rework ALL of Ash's animations just for one cosmetic, which I don't seem them doing. it'd look far to stupid for him to drop a pallet or heal a survivor with that thing for them NOT to rework all his animations, hell I'm sure the animation team complained when they had to change Clown's Mori animation just because of Ashy Slashy.
---
Yes. If you're not having fun in thr game, DC.
---
So have I lol. But I‚Äôm watching his stream and he went off on one guy for 20 minutes. Talking about ‚Äúif you‚Äôre gonna talk shit in my chat atleast sub‚Äù 
---
It‚Äôs sad to watch honestly. I used to like him but idk anymore haha
---
This exact meme was reposted 2 weeks ago
---
Is this him? https://nypost.com/2019/01/05/high-profile-nyc-lawyer-may-have-led-double-life-as-serial-sex-crime-fiend-cops/?utm_source=url_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons
---
I know an easy ban when I see one. Hopefully you reported them.
---
Queue times are longer which sucks but having multiple matches without early quitters so far has been nice
---
I need the original, I want to send it to my gf
---
No it doesnt make him faster, and no extra points.
---
My idea has different numbers than ghostface and you cannot be revealed, also it works completly different.
---
Spirit does have counterplay, first realize she cant see you while phasing and she cant vault over stuff while phasing, second keep track of how long she has been phasing to guess when it will run out. Third Instead of running around aimlessly giving huge telltales where you are run up to a pallet throw it down and walk away once they see you doing that enough they will adapt but its not about running them for 5 gens, its about buying as much time as you can for the teamattes to complete the objective, you can also run up to a window fast vault and slow vault back, just slow vault, fast vault and walk etc. To confuse them, spirit is a very fun killer to vs once you know how to play against her.
---
You deserve the hate. Get over it
---
Doesn't totem cleansing give you boldness not objective?
---
Confirmed this is him. He's a scummy piece of shit who is rotting in jail.
---
Thats fine and I respect you for holding your ground against fact. But this is typically why we have issues. Because if you keep ignoring the fact eh ques will get longer. the problems will keep stacking, and nobody will play. Because we are conerned more about our ranks and dlc the game continues to have flaws so good on you. Anyway I respect your choice.
---
second is 5 minutes
---
Like... how is this even possible... this rant. 
---
You just explained that he waited for 30 minutes and got this match ups. You know what else prevents players from continue playing DBD? Endless queue time. 
---
Would you rather have him sit for 60 minutes or longer instead of just playing the game against whatever the game can find for him? Because this is what happens when you sit in queue for a while, you get whatever ranks just so you can play.
---
Why is it so hard for people to understand how matchmaking works.
---
It does work different from ghostface. You also cant reveal him in stealth, which gives him undetectable, gets rid of his red stain, and turns off his terror radius
---
Tier 3 myers is faster than average. He also gets points for using his power, while haunted ground doesnt.
---
You're right but I think it's stupid they keep saying ''we can't cos new animations'' it's like yeah but it's your job to do that |:  
---
Imagine the hatch spawning in the basement like a hatch inside a hatch lol
---
I like how your level is 69
---
meaning matchmaking will take even longer as less players will be available...lmao,u cannot discipline DC by pausing their timer. if u cant play u leave.
---
Yikes dude...
---
How does someone deserve racial slurs and to be told to kill themselves?
---
So, they throw BPS to rush you with brand mew part and tool boxes? Lol
---
1. He could be running botany knowledge/ autodidact
---
2. The other survivors could be running unbreakable
---
3. There is a bug with sprint burst.
---
I think people are to scared to fuck with EAC to hack in DBD.
---
thank you
---
You have zero context to make that assumption.
---
Only if the game isn't skill-based. What's wrong with playing against people at your skill level? The alternative is eSports level players (whether they're taking a break from Ranked or if they just play all the time but prefer casual) getting matched with day one players or people who play once or twice a month and absolutely stomping.
---
Imagine being forced into Ranked play (if you didn't like it, for whatever silly mental reasons) in a game like Overwatch, because you actually had fun matches - but playing Casual meant you had a 33% chance of going up against aimbot level Widow players. Or in DbD terms imagine if they split it the way you're asking, and your choices were to go into Ranked mode or go up against Silent Phasing NOED Spirits and FunGoose level Killers every game.
---
*intense flashlight flickering*
---
I don't know if it will work, but I know about the people who I know that they sometimes DC, that they will do it further because they hate being tunneled, camped or farmed
---
Unless its on bloodlodge...
---
Its not mine but a close friend of mines rule.
---
When she plays a survivor, she has to use at least two perks from that survivor. 'You are playing Dwight, you shouldn't play Dwight the exact same way you play Claudette.
---
Seems like Laurie got sick of Myers's shit so she decided to grab a knife of her own
---
Great cosplay!
---
Fair enough
---
&gt;This is literally the treatment I get every day - killer just isn't fun anymore
---
Disabling chat is always an option. Just saying cuz some people aren't aware of this feature.
---
I love it too, one of the few games that actually got under my skin due to how realistic the kills are  (I've seen some fucked shit man) and it honestly doesn't get enough love
---
Can't touch this
---
When chased for 40/35/30 seconds without taking damage, gain a 150% move speed for 5 seconds
---
"Speed boost motherf***er"
---
Such is life
---
When hooked for a 3rd time, have a chance to revert to beginning of second phase, but it goes at double speed. Chances are 5/9/14%.
---
"Its fine guys! I'll just.. Hang out for a bit"
---
Magic hands!
---
Items regain 5/10/15% of their charge upon being used up (does not work on keys or maps)
---
"The misses always said I had magic hands, this is my proof"
---
Haha, Claudette, I get it.
---
They should change his ability from able to get quick hits and that stupid bleed out timer and make it a traversal tool. 
---
Like make him able to use it for longer, but give him a cooldown before he can attack out of it and make him recharge it by hitting survs, or something like that. Or maybe they could let you hit out of it but it‚Äôs an extended lunge like Oni, and missing it automatically puts you on cooldown.
---
All and all though the bleed out timer needs to go. It‚Äôs just so lame, and everytime BHVR reworks legion they base it around reworking how Mending works. If they took that out of the equation completely and focused more on feral fenzy I think that would be better
---
Watch him run. He doesnt stutter in the animation like one would if you had Sprint burst on command, and he is very clearly faster than the killer.
---
Then he gets to the pallet, while sprinting above 115% and then slow vaults? No.
---
Hes got a MS hack.
---
As far as I read the DC punishmen*T* is temporary for now.
---
However, people who DC on purpose are very egotistical when they're farmed on (seriously, the teammates? Thinks nobody about the teammates!?)
---
Get yourself killed if you hate the actual game.
---
I'd want a laurie looking laurie first
---
Inner strength the best self-healing perk... *if* people don‚Äôt use it like a dumbass.  Grab a dull near the beginning of the game (super easy to do) and bank the heal for the clutch when you need it.  If you‚Äôre playing smart and using your teammates for heal when safe, you should only need it once or twice in a game; but it‚Äôs just going to come in clutch when you use it.
---
(I honestly prefer Second Wind *conceptually* but the perk needs buffs to compete with the other healing perks)
---
Troll somewhere else
---
It looks AMAZING!
---
Also I had this guy rq on our team, then when he joined again a game later, he would afk since he couldn't rq again.
---
Lately it seems no matter how good the ping is you'll still be hit through windows, over pallets, around corners, etc. Been kind of a bummer, hope they fix it but I don't hold out much hope haha
---
Where is he?
---
Leakingpickle!!! I missed you! Again with shitty posts I see
---
Welp, I hope they make even longer queue times punishments for people who DC like you. I still remember how hardly you defended DC like it was a human right hahaha keep it up, your posts are always funny as hell
---
Dat
---
Mate it‚Äôs a 5 minute ban. Calm down.
---
Madison Montgomery survivor when?
---
Cute!
---
&gt;But what's the point in playing against survivors that completely out skill you?
---
The point is playing at all... Or you uninstall DBD and go play something else because you can't find a game. Like I said, there is even the current SWF algorithm which removes a lot of otherwise brand new players from the rank 20 ~ 16 pool. 
---
We've all been there. When I started playing DBD's matchmaking didn't have as many rules as we have today and I still had to brute force my way through a bunch of red ranked survivors (some times 3 in the same match) while I was still in my first 10 matches ever as a killer. 
---
I played, I got destroyed, I watched videos / streams and these matches even though extremely unfair to me, allowed me to practice so I could improve. The alternative would be not play at all while I wait for indefinite amount of time until there were 4 survivors the same rank as me available which still wouldn't guarantee 4 brand new players because of rank reset and derankers.
---
Try to use this logic to any other game. Go to any subreddit and make a post about it
---
They laugh at you so hard you'll come back with your tail between your legs
---
well ig I am the odd one out
---
Hexes are gone once they are found that is the point if u hang ur hex like the back bone of surviving then you are doing it wrong
---
This is why you always move to a safe location. Remember, every killer has just enough I there arsenal to kill you.
---
It's 60 seconds the first time and 5 minutes the second time. The devs have no idea what they're doing. They've proven it time and time again, unfortunately.
---
Only after the hook has been broken.
---
I remember unhooking myself during end game as Kate, was the Kate‚Äôs username kittyhkat?
---
Dont argue with him. He defended DC for centuries and he does such mental gymnastics to do so.
---
From previous interactions I suggest you to not speak with him, at least not taking him too seriously. He's pretty much a joke, someone who made a whole new account to harass me because I destroyed his arguments in an old post
---
He is that kind of person. Don't waste time
---
well no shit
---
Loving the good fellas meme!
---
Well yeah. If you actually learn something like this, good for you. In my opinion if I started this game today and I would have to play against the best survivors after waiting for 30 minutes I would just quit and play something else. I don't have a huge amount of time after work and I would rather spend it with something where I have fun. That's just how I see it.
---
1 week my ass u got 3 teachable from dlc killers
---
No homo, he is ridiculously handsome haha
---
...okay a little homo
---
For  the love of god, please how do I disable the chat? I'm not even kidding I don't even know why the killer has the ability to speak with survivors after game
---
It's been a long wait for everyone recently, not sure if less people are playing or the ranks are fucked or another bug. Hopefully they'll resolve it eventually. I just want to play rounds haha
---
this whole comment is so cute. you two should kiss
---
welcome to life
---
N word and Asian at the same time... big brain time
---
She has no counterplay. You don't understand what counterplay is. There is no skill to play against her, it's why pallet loops are 50/50, and if you run away, she'll just run at you with her power, and be able to tell exactly were you are, because good Spirits run Stridor. No other killer has this behavior, even nurse has counterplay, as you can gage where she will blink, and how far.
---
Are you one of those survivors?
---
Nah fam I was the Kate in reference
---
Up to this point I always thought that was a send button. Wow. You are a saint. Thank-you so much!
---
the speed boost is pretty significant as well.
---
also it's not easy to land a chainsaw hit on a competent survivor
---
Do they give Donkey Jacket and all the other ultra rare cosmetics to everyone? Because I didn't have some of them and I have now.
---
Uninstalled. Forced to play shitty matches. No thanks. Bye
---
witch hunting isnt allowed here.
---
Nothing wrong with a little homo ;)

They already added more points for survivors. Dull totems give 1k now (500 before), hex totems give 1.5k (from 1k). Dropping pallets and fast vaults in a chase give 200 each (from 0). The only real difference between killer and survivor bp gain is in the disparity between BBQ vs WGLF. BBQ has an actually useful effect while WGLF makes it so you have to choose between playing to win or playing for points

According to the dev team, the Entity was whispering to Rin‚Äôs father &amp; drove him to do what he did. But Rin‚Äôs fury attracted the Entity to her over her father‚Äôs despair.
---
agreed with everything you said!
---
Ok. Well, you kids have fun.
---
make sure to have noed equipped when you try to do the challenge
---
Both of those perks are awful for my play-style
---
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
---
Where's the Claudette?
---
still waste of a perk slot especially for billy just throw a git gud and they are gonna curv around every corner
---
lmk if u ever check out r/dbdgonewild thx
---
This is probably the issue. If the op has a 1660 ti and a similarly recent cpu he should have no problems running the game
---
It happens even if I have just come on and last game I was against a different freddy and there was no audio on  gens or when the killer hit me or on dropping pallets or vaulting
---
Nobody cares tbh.
---
please DC 5 times in a row and tell us what your timer is looking like
---
I dont because I am not a child. I voluntarily DC when I find smth that‚Äôs bothering me (not only me but those who DC in general and punishment cannot enforce behavioural change)....pussy or not....dying on first hook will grant me a pass to the next game....yes IP ban for pressing exit game...lmao calm down...IP ban will deffo put this game in the trash
---
What does it do, make fully charged hatchets a one hit down?
---
Wow it's almost like those two can be done at the same time, but one takes significantly longer.
---
I didn't even see the NOED or the end game timer... I stupid xD
---
But seriously that assesment on the last part was exactly my thoughts too.
---
Good one man, I respect the time you put on.
---
You just get used to it with time. You won't notice it that much as survivors but as killer... Sometimes I feel like pulling my hair out. Everytime a survivor trys to 360 frames drop/lags the game for you so all you can do is predict which way they are going or don't swing and wait a bit for a good hit.
---
Survival points need to be awarded more frequently. They make up a quarter of the possible bloodpoints for survivors, but the biggest source comes from escaping. The further a survivor makes it in a match, the more survival points they should get.
---
Until the game bugs and or crashes 3 times in a row, then it‚Äôs an hour ban
---
People like you have been putting it in the trash for 3 years.
---
Like literally read the 1st line lol
---
Max bloodpoints (1 million) will only get you to level 36 haha.
---
Could have ended that whole paragraph with "Gotham will pay" you know, might as well.
---
Yep, I'll vouch for that. Rank 1 killer and it seems there is an overabundance of survivors and not enough killers as my killer queue is lighting speed and my survivor games take 5 minutes or so to start up.
---
depends on what u buy it can get u to 40
---
It can be frustrating to constantly go mend, I can relate to his frustration but I stopped getting angry about it.
---
Thats so trash tbh, the double xp weekend need to be the real blood points for survivors
---
Adding DC punishments to a buggy game,
---
BHVR coming in with the big brain moves
---
I rather not üò≥ I prefer r/dbdgonegay
---
Remove hex ruin. Add a built in mechanic that slows repair speed by X%. For every dull totem cleansed, reduce that effect by 20%
---
Gotta come prepared for anything if you're gonna go that far, I guess. Now imagine a Tuft Myers running NOED, MYC, Haunted Grounds, and Sloppy.
---
Wow its look that they rather want to release new dlc with new bug, but its okay, we can nerf survivors
---
Try [this website](http://www.mistersyms.com/tools/gitgud/) it's very useful for beginner players practising skill checks
---
It‚Äôs definitely a lengthy grind.
---
What happened here?
---
I ranked 3 killers up to 35
---
The ''no gen camping'' rule
---
Really funny
---
Repost
---
that is 8 days not 7 hence not 1 week
---
mmm yes indeed crutch perks
---
youre a faggot cunt nigger.
---
i mean no negativity from my words btw
---
does my second line change my first line in any way? no. because it's still against the rules to call someone a faggot cunt nigger even if i mean it in a nice way :) just like it's against the rules to witch hunt even if it's in a nice way :)
---
Are there any perks worth buying in the new shrine? I'm new to the game
---
You know, you're right. That was my b. I honestly made this so I could set up the punchline.
---
nice reply, really driving the conversation there
---
Now I'm curious
---
Looks like I found my target audience.
---
Scott Jund literally posted two *hours* of wrecking people with Spirit with way more ease than other killers.
---
I was having a bad night at the game and decided to say fuck it and run Spirit who I barely play. Lo and behold I think only 2 people escaped in about 4 games. And I was just trying to end the night on a high note, making tons of mistakes.
---
There is no countering her. It's being unpredictable for as long as possible and hope your team slam out gens. When Ruin is gone or no slowdown is applied to gens, she can look weak. Add in some god loops and she may even seem balanced.
---
But usually there is slowdown and every loop isn't godly. You won't ever escape a chase from a semi-competent Spirit and you won't ever have a long one with a great Spirit.
---
Can you guys rework haddonfield? That's the only reason i would DC as billy.
---
Its everywhere on the map, lol
---
sorry got lot in the bs of text where it looks like u defended NOED as a smart option
---
Weebs DansGame
---
Same in Ireland
---
Something similar happened to me, guy wanted his WGLFE stack and i wanted my 4% achievement with deliverance c:
---
I only wear free clothes TryHard Clap
---
When youre in an online argument and the other person has bad grammar
---
Like a little up from direct center
---
There is no matter if it's casual game if you are in a bad enough state to rage quit after first down because you don't like killer and make 3 other people casually deal with your BS you should not be rewarded with almost instant que into another match! 30 minutes isn't enough!!!
---
I've had last night two guys with "clan" nickname after killing one with Mori other guy instantly DCs well that casually ruins rest of match for me and two other survivors!
---
 I don't really think punishing a person for not wanting to play the game is a good idea.Tbh i only care when survivors dc before i hook them because i lose my points and usually depip. So instead of punishing the person for dc they should give killer a bloodppints equivalent of 2 hooks and a bbq stack for that dc. For survivors side, they should get like 5 to 6k bp for each dc because it's not really fair to play 3v1 so they shouldn't lose a pip or bp for that.
---
Np
---
Good son cosmetic set minus the mask best set
---
a shame. back to calling people idiots then.
---
Don't try to survive because the killer will call you toxic
---
Don't do gens or the killer will call you toxic
---
Don't say gg or the killer will call you toxic
---
Tell me what is casual about ruining other peoples fun because you cant be bothered finishing a match? Last night I've had two guys with clan nickname, I've Mori one other guy instantly DC it ruined rest of match for me and two other random survivors..., in your honest opinion should those two guys be rewarded with instant que into next match?
---
Not really. The only perk that‚Äôs (slightly)noteworthy is brutal strength(the foot kicking a pallet), but it‚Äôs on a free killer.  My advice is to never buy perks from a character that you already own as it takes a significant longer time to get 9000 iridescent shards than to get the bloodpoints to level a character to lvl 30/35/40 respectively depending on the perk you want.
---
Yep. My new wallpaper.
---
Well it sure as hell isnt 2 weeks
---
How would this impact queue times?
---
True. That is helpful.
---
imagine thinking someone is "toxic" enough to make a post about them just because they say gg2ez, he clearly doesn't care weather he lives or not it's probably just the dudes copy paste for end match chat.
---
r/thathappened
---
Been saying that for years. Even if they just make the bad Killers viable. Not even talk to you or anything. If they would actually focus on slight Buffs and changes instead of Cosmetics for a month or so we would being a much better state of balance. People wouldn't hate Spirit Ghostface or nurse as much if they didn't go against only those three killers above Rank 10.. Although I despise Ghostface more than anything that's ever been added to the game and it's mostly due to his glitchy and inconsistent nature. In my opinion he doesn't need the ability to stock since it's busted and will never work properly. No good Ghostface players actually stalk anyone anyway. It's just a nuisance because of the terrible reveal mechanic.
---
Killers like Leatherface Trapper and wraith have got nothing but Nerfs and been ignored for years. Pig seems to get nerfed every patch. Despite nobody complaining about her ever.
---
If they made the fun bad Killers better... We get more variety of gameplay. Instead they release a new killer who is seemingly very good and fun. Once everyone has bought the DLC within a week they Nerf the killer into the ground rework them slightly so they are still weaker than they were at launch and then ignore them for the next year or two. It's to the point where I'm done buying a DLC on its first day.
---
Honestly all this quit penalty makes me want to do is quit the game. A game I'm already losing motivation to play since I'm not having fun anymore. I'm either going to get bullied by toxic Survivor, forced to play the same few killers and against the same few killers. Which is insane for me to say given the fact that I've been begging for a quit penalty for years. Now that it's finally here... There are so many problems with the game that it will only add to them. At least in my opinion. People who want out of the natural still just pull the plug or download programs to quit and simulate a genuine disconnect. Or just suicide on hook.
---
You'll never be able to force people to play a game they don't want to play. If I have a teammate DC or suicide on hook immediately into the match... You can bet your ass I've lost motivation to finish that game. If it's my 9th Ghostface in a row and since all of them tend to play like scumbags... You can guarantee I'm done with that match.
---
Too bad the bad killers are going to continue getting ignored and the new Killers who are actually viable will continue being nerfed into the ground. At least this Band-Aid fix that solves nothing will only create more frustration.
---
",only on" takes out a survivors rulebook hahaha
---
I was literally being a dick and correcting the title. The title says they had addons that would let them keep their items. I was just being a bit of a cunt
---
I will say this: BHVR, instead of enforcing punishments and playing with rankings with depips and whatever, they should change the award system. you did a bad job as a survivor/killer? u get minus Blood Points....meaning if u do a shitty job u get less rewarded, if u dc u get minus some amount of BP (and this is a proper ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù)....everyone likes BP...without that u cant progress....anyways, im going to work because i loathe myself and i have to bring home the bacon...
---
Why is he dating a furry? I love it
---
I suggest oni but 99% nipple
---
Literally it‚Äôs me
---
Personally, that's what I would do.  I didn't prestige anyone until I got everyone (that I had at the time of course) to level 50, so I'd have all the teachable perks available in the bloodwebs after prestiging someone. All depends on how much you care about prestiging vs just leveling up post-50 to get the perks you want on any given killer, though.
---
Found my new phone wallpaper
---
I don't wear clothing MMMMMMMMMMMMMM
---
I think Survival is the only category that could use some help. Recovering while in the dying state and some points every time a gen is completed while you're alive are two easy things I can think of
---
Myers with tombstone piece in a nutshell. (Got entity displeased but i killed everyone,2 sacrifices 2 tombstoned survivoes, entity can get fucked tho)
---
When you hoped for good perks
---
Haha don‚Äôt take it too seriously dude. It‚Äôs a video game post. Imagine caring this much about my post. I literally said I think it‚Äôs funny. Sorry one paragraph is TLDR for you bud
---
Time will tell if these immediate DC punishments in a casual game will harm DBD. I won't voice my opinion on the matter because its controversial and will likely just get downvoted. I'll never agree to DC punishments in a game that isn't competitive, specially considering how much control killers have over your actions. 
---
I'll just add 2 cents about your example. Removing one of the 2 friends from the match earlier than it should (through 3 hooking events), will force him to spectate the other guy for as long as the match lasts or he dies. If they don't care about ranks and just want to play together, second guy won't force the first one to spectate after being removed from the game so early. Even worse if he is being forced to play with 2 randoms that are probably urban evading around the map.
---
Did you report him in-game after the match?
---
if this ever happens again, another good way to move them is to give them an item. Make them drop it and pick it back up. They teleport backwards when they do.
---
Sometimes they move too far though and can't reach the item again so they need you to help move it closer again.
---
Demogorgon and Oni are unique tbh. Both of them emit map-wide sound effects when preforming certain actions. So in a way they can fit in ID'd before seen and No stealth mechanic.
---
Hello
---
You can also work the bloodweb so that the entity closes off pathways. You might not get the perk you want, but if you're just going for teachables on a character you won't be playing, it can save you a bundle of BP.
---
Hahaha there he is! Wtf
---
I literally took like 3 tanks to kill bill.
---
Demogorgon has a stealth mechanic. When going trough his portals he become undetectable for a few seconds
---
Especially in my first few games as surv, I thought his power was total bs, like, dude don't vault that pallet, that's my job. although, now I don't mind them (?) nearly as much.
---
How? Playing normally now justifies racial slurs and insults?
---
yet you are here reading my posts and commenting :) thanks for the attentions buds!
---
I cant even see shit he‚Äôs laggy as fuck
---
i wanted but he is homophobic!
---
Billy be like wtf y'all leave me alone
---
Mmm the healing thing could be fine? But he's def too fast. There is a bug where you get stuck with the speed boost of a sprint burst (not even specifically the perk. it can happen with the speed boost from getting hit too) so unfortunately, it's too hard to say if it was an intentional hack or not vs a bug.
---
What did I just watch
---
True, if you dont go against a Pig or Trapper or any killers that let you get survival points it's pretty much impossible to max it out
---
If there's any kind of tension, sure. Doing gens when you know the killer isn't gonna play the game is just boring busy work.
---
HYPERDANIELSVIDEOGAMINGEMOJI
---
I got myers, iridescent tuft, noed (Can be cleansed, will still count), pwyf, stbfl, and something(Didn't have bloodwarden when I did it). Activate tuft, down 3 at most when there are still generators to get stbfl and get pwyf at 1 gen left. Open the gates yourself if needed.
---
LOL I probably  looped you for days, gets rekt bitch
---
(More images)[https://imgur.com/a/YBxUpLU]
---
Hope you reported them in game too!
---
&gt; Better in what exactly? Getting the killer their BBQ stack? Or buying the other 3 survivors only 30 secs or a minute MAX
---
ABSOLUTELY YES
---
still delusional i see. :) 
---
btw u r wasting ur time on ma posts. please do so
---
yeah and if you die the category is probably just going to be flat out empty unless you used DS or something
---
Man, I'm loving the tears of the DCers in this thread :)
---
Here's what they said:
---
&gt; Killers complain if totems spawn next to:
---
&gt; Generators.
---
&gt; Hooks / hooked survivor.
---
&gt; Inside pallet loops.
---
&gt; Plague's Fountains.
---
&gt; Pig jigsaw boxes.
---
&gt; Considering 80% of the map has at least one of these props, totems should spawn outside the playable area. Only then, killers will be happy.
---
the chainsaw. specifically billy's. if you pay attention to the animation, he does it in a way to where it gets as much area as possible before pushing in.
---
@gaymomota I only say that shit when I FUCK them up
---
I did, as well as on steam.
---
You want them to get sued by bhvr?
---
yes, and in steam.
---
Matchmaking so broken it's running No Mither.
---
Matchmaking so stupid it's also running Self-Care.
---
i mean hey dont make assumptions, maybe youre just ugly
---
no when you overperformed you 2 pip. That's basic stuff to understand.
---
robots are fricking taking our youtube jobs too now
---
I just started playing on the Switch, do most killer camp? Ive have 5-10 games and most have.
---
Lol gtfo üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
&gt; Dwights always live.
---
Whenever I play killer, Dwights always survive. I'll hook 'em twice, but long as they get themselves saved they won't hit the third hook.

---
Ikr lol
---
It makes every hatchet a one hit down, but reduces the number of hatchets you can carry by 4
---
maybe:..
---
Report it to BHVR.
---
This is why they made the penalties so low initially -- Because they knew there would be problem situations and they want to test things first.
---
File a support ticket with info.
---
Her new hair is too bright though. I doubt it looks anything close to one of Halloween movies. Because for me it's like a Schwarzkopf ad.
---
@chazrat123 hope I see you next game üòâ you‚Äôll get fucked up boi
---
I submitted a ticket at the end game screen, so hopefully they can look into it.
---
Good luck fixing that spaghetti code, though. God only knows what piece is causing such a weird bug.
---
It could still be random, but randomly selected from a number of hard to see specific locations.
---
Survivors could learn the spawns, but they couldn't know which spawn holds a totem just by glancing around as the work on a gen or sprint across the map.
---
Both Badham and Hawkins work this way, and although Badham still has some stupid spawns (two totems can spawn near to a generator in the preschool basement) their totems are generally harder to find without actively searching for them.
---
We won't shed many tears if we lose few Ochido like rage quite that DC after first down. . .
---
Wtf is wrong with you
---
Honestly I don't plan on going past 50 to get perks. I'm just thinking about getting most of the killers I want to play to 50 so I have variety. I've sank like 30ish hours into Myers these past two weeks and I'm burning out on him.
---
Not gonna lie the Jeans are the only thing that highly matches here. Except it's gonna feel pure annoyance for your crotch side. Because of how you have to pull them up till your waist.
---
Of course you won't, but will you be the first to cry on lobbies taking forever?
---
Time will tell.
---
I like sprint burst and botany knowledge when against Oni. That way you can make a quick getaway and heal quickly if he gets you.
---
&gt; Good luck fixing that spaghetti code
---
I find a good marinara sauce poured into the main server will loosen things up nicely.
---
Though some people prefer alfredo.
---
I agree with the hair color's lack of accuracy. Though, it would be neat if they added this outfit and added a darker variant of the "gold-feathered brown" hair!
---
I don't like legion when i'm playing him or when I play against him. But this drawing is already my wallpaper on phone. Ty for this pic &lt;3
---
Lol
---
Oh yeah, I'm not worried about him Pre-Chase. Its during chase and more or less Post-Power. I dont really like to play immersive so his power kinda counters my naturally bold play style lol.
---
Because say you‚Äôre a non-DCer trying to get into a match, but every DBD player nearby is waiting on timeout.
---
[oops wrong link](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ubj5SSJ)
---
Absolutely that's fair!
---
His power cant flick nearly as well as it used to, so you can 360 him and just generally juke him like you would a billy or even a huntress.
---
Is it just me or are the Halloween wraiths always the wholesome ones?
---
Oh, do have kudos to you cause this is more well looking than worn off white looking color. Totes, would wear this.
---
Thank you!!! I‚Äôd do anything to fix my girl Laurie!
---
Be honest DC issue is currently horrible on PC and people usually DC due to throwing tantrums for xyz reason . . ., having poor connection, bug or router reset is far less common and even if it happens you get slapped with 30 seconds BAN it takes longer for router to boot connection back on...
---
If someone gets 30 minutes + BAN that means he already ruined few games for killer and survivors and should chill from a game for a while..., survivors and killers took the "fuc* it" approach for far too long...
---
And you won't be able to ruin few matches in a row for others any more...
---
Thank you
---
tails is huntress   
---
head is wraith   
---
go flip
---
They can't even make spectating work
---
even better when you bring yellow in
---
Low rank yes
---
I was thinking what if slugged players can help each other up and nothing else? Too OP?
---
Even when the problem is clearly lag / desync, people still ignorantly mention hitboxes. Unbelievable.
---
DC timeout is negligible if not repeatedly dcing, (1 min, 5 min)  so the only missing players would be those dcing often, who aren't that common and I'd rather play without anyway.
---
I made this post as a joke, I didn‚Äôt know I was gonna get grilled about it
---
the DBD community in a nutshell ignorance is a bliss *like it is that hard to switch hitboxes for latency and being correct*
---
The strongest part of NOED is the speed increase. You can look the killer for ages when injured, but can't do much if the killer is a tiny bit faster and can finally play the loops instead of having to kick every pallet down on blood lodge
---
For the new balanced landing, will the 100% muffled sound from falling only activate when not exhausted or will it happen any time that you fall? I‚Äôm a little confused with it
---
ah yes fuel the dumbasses of the DBD community that take this as evidence of "hitboxes being broken"
---
&gt;I made this post as a joke, I didn‚Äôt know I was gonna get grilled about it
---
Way too many people make this joke, providing similar footages which is then used by even more ignorant people to harass the devs on every social medias they have. These people seriously believe there are problems with hitboxes even the hit was 100% caused by lag / ping / desync.
---
Then I‚Äôll just delete the post then, sorry for upsetting you guys
---
The muffle will only happen if you are not exhausted!  
---
So Balanced Landing does absolutely nothing while you are exhausted.
---
Didn't know asking for some friends to swf with here is frowned upon, but just go to r/dbdLFG and make a post there or comment on an existing post. It's a community of dbd players looking for swf or kyf (kill your friend).
---
Or internet. I have pretty good connection most times and whenever I go to a friends house I get DC because their internet is trash. They blame the game though.
---
I think toxic killers as a whole was combined with a fun but admittedly OP release of Legion and it tilted Survivors for an eternityüôÉ Legit been told I was the spawn of Satan countless times for simply being Legion but I just wanna GaNk....
---
Yep you did prove a point. Not yours tho...
---
You don't have to play a Killer/Survivor you want to level up! Use your highest Killer with awesome Perks that you like the most and while playing that Killer level up other Killers with that juicy BP you made. If you really want multiple Killers on a high level consider pushing only to level 40 because at that point you get all the teachables from that Killer.  
---
The best Killer to gain BP with would be someone with BBQ and double BP Offerings!
---
Green mori will forever be the funniest thing in this game
---
Fuck you in particular
---
ü§ß
---
Been testing them on pc for over a month now. Switch has them but thats because it required them apparently.
---
"Why the fuck would Myers be into frozen pizza?"
---
It kinda was like that before...u could turn around and the wound timer would go down and then you get your ability back and hit them again. How about when chasing the timer goes down making it harder and harder to see (like clown bottle) and then when he stops chase if he leaves you it takes SIGNIFICANTLY longer to mend...the more the bar is drained the more time it takes to mend...muahahaeheahaehaehaeh
---
Thank you - Not the best week :-(
---
Its not annoying to have someone DC. Its ruinous. That illogical mentality spreads. When one of four survivors DCs consistently, it blocks four others from playing. Its getting to the point where people like you DC because they get knocked down once. I have atleast one DC every two games. Atleast. If I'm unlucky I have to put the game away because there will be a string of losers who DC over an hour plus.
---
If you don't like the game. Fine, don't play the game. Don't sit here and bitch about ruining games for four other people because of your own selfishness.
---
When people turn around corners i just stop my dash and go slam them, i can dominate games with common add ons or come back when all gens are done against a swf and get 3 kills, im rank 3 killer and been in the red ranks since i got it for free from the ps plus monthly free games.
---
hes extremely easy to loop...where are these stats? Also based on how much data? It could be a small pool...like I could take poll of 10 ppl and then say 90% of people in DBD agree with this thing while 10% dont...see how that wouldnt not be accurate? He is not good past purple ranks...at all. You are forced to use certain perks on him to make him SOMEWHAT viable...he needs a rework
---
Thank you for your sacrifice. You are motivating nurse players to keep practicing her and not giving up... And maybe that'll encourage them to give hatch to baby survs!
---
Signed : a former baby nurse
---
Ur so butt hurt lol.... (Good one. Classic comeback. Bravo. ) as you bitch about the developers purposely trying to rid you from the game.
---
WAAAAAH! (Thats what I think)
---
Sorry about crappy video, recorded with my phone.
---
I've never purposely quit or DCed from a game. Yet here I am with an hour lockout because of this loading screen error which started when dedicated servers were brought in.
---
The point of a closet cosplay is to reproduce the look with stuff straight out of your closet. I'd say OP did pretty well.
---
well Legion has already went though a "rework" a failed one...but a rework nonetheless
---
&gt; It's just a nuisance because of the terrible reveal mechanic.
---
That made me think that it would be awesome for this killer to integrate the Tobii eye tracking system to reveal him :D
---
"tons of objs" not really...5 gens...if you have survivors who are just simply competent...2 gens are done by the first down...its easy...now if we are talking survivors who hide and dont do objs...then yes...but if you are playing the game proper...one being chased by killer and 3 others do gens...its EASY
---
Aren't you a meme gand as well? (you know, self care+no mither)
---
Yeah I'm aware that they are on PC for a while, but I thought only the first two weeks where testing and since they didn't take them out again (they had done this in a test a few months before iirc) it meant that they are officially launched now. 
---
Hm, but to be honest if this is still a test I think it kinda works ok. Didn't have to many problems until now...
---
You realize slugging is part of the game right. Knocking someone down then chasing another who is nearby because they ran up thinking the killer would just ignore them is illogical. One person down. Chasing another and a third survivor coming to heal. Thats 3 people not doing gens. Its a decent startegy against overaltruism. If survivors are spread out and not all in the killers face, slugging is useless and hurts the killer.
---
this only resulted in survivors instantly giving up on hook when i camp em xDDD
---
First of all I love this but I have some questions if you don't mind answering.
---
Do you have a website where you sell your charms or are you in the process of making 1?
---
How much?
---
Are these the only DBD characters you have?
---
If you do this as a business do you accept custom request?
---
Jokes on you, I vaulted a window at 99 with the killer 40 feet away and activated Sprint Burst, and got downed THEN saw the Haste effect as I was on the ground.
---
I mean I guess it still works sometimes but it's hard to be oPtImAl with it.
---
yes because skill checks are so "hard"....you just proved my point right there...they are laughable...but at least make it so its not a "hold button down" simulator. Takes no stimulation or even the slightest focus.
---
Thank you for the clarification!
---
Nice reading the comments I've explained this like 3 times
---
I mean, Nurse killed an entire asylum's worth of people and Huntress was butchering families and soldiers her whole life. But I do agree with you on the others.
---
This is me...against SWFs or any survivor that is an asshole...if I got ran 5 gens and there was no toxicity then its diff tho...but that is rare.
---
Its still not on ps4 or xbox unfortunately. Seems to be hit or miss for pc, probably distance from their centres.
---
thats alot of ppl nowdays...selfish...want to ruin everyones experience and only care for their own
---
Finally thank you bhvr.
---
Idk man I been 4king in rank 6 with all the low tier killers
---
wait he was getting paid to play?
---
Just remove ranked boom simple some days u might go against rank 1 players and sometimes rank 20s it's good
---
For merciless killer, gen slow down is essential. You get points in gatekeeper for each uncompleted gen every minute, plus a bonus amount of points for the number of gens left at the end of the game. Ruin/Corrupt Intervention/Dying Light/Thanatophobia all slow down gens to some extent and will net you some extra points in this category. 
---
For the devout category, you need to get as many hooks and kills as possible. For iridescent, you need a total of 9 hooks across the four survivors, and four kills. If you find you've downed everyone at the start of the game, you're probably not going to get merciless because you need to hook everyone several times. 
---
The malicious category requires you to put pressure on survivors. This includes damaging survivors and hooking them. You lose points when survivors heal. Killers with instadowns tend to score lower here because they get half the number of hits. Perks like Sloppy Butcher/Coulrophobia/Nurses Calling may help prevent healing and keep the pressure on. 
---
To get points in the chaser category, you need to find survivors, initiate a chase, and down them as quickly as possible. You lose points for being near to hooked survivors (camping). Perks like Enduring/Spirit Fury/Bamboozle help with chases, though you're going to do best here if you can prevent survivors getting to strong loops.
---
People would complain about others being a higher rank then them due to how skillful they are. Casual mode won‚Äôt change much there will just be more bitches and people who love being noob stompers.
---
Uhh, out of curiosity. Did BHVR actually paid Ninja to play their game or he tried it on his own?
---
Tapping takes longer just git gud and hit skillchecks 4head
---
If I've gotten 2 hook saves on solo queue you're goddamn right I'm leaving anyone else who gets hooked to get saved by other people and either doing gens or running the killer to get my points in the other categories.
---
Where‚Äôs the proof that they paid him to play?
---
Yesterday we had two party streamers a bound envelope and killer project pudding. So of course the game was over in less than 10 minutes with excessive tunneling and my other two friends and myself were salty af
---
I need killer advice for a total scrub. I bought the game back in the summer, played about 100 hours, and took a long break. I'm rank 17, should probably be lower.  The highest I've climbed is rank 14.
---
I recently started playing with headphones, that has helped some. My best killer is Ghost Face, but I know I play him poorly. I mostly use the zero terror radius to get the drop on people, and if they are as potato as me, I might actually be able to mark. 
---
I have days where I 4k back to back and feel like I'm improving, but anytime I play half decent survivors I feel like I can't do anything. Every few games, I dump all of my bloodpoints into Leatherface, hoping BBQ and chilli will help me out a bit. I plan to do the same with Nurse for Nurse's calling once I have BBQ.
---
My main issue is finding people, although again, headphones has made that easier. For someone who is full potato, admitting they're potato, and truly wants to improve... is their any general advice of where to start or what to work on? I play a bit of trapper too, and sometimes do well on him, but I am a buffoon and walk over my own traps during a heated chase.
---
I do try to patrol gens, I try to control the chase as best I can, I try to learn effective use of my powers... but I'm afraid I'm just bad.
---
Yea but at least we can stop caring about having ranked actually work bc it doesn't. The game isn't even balanced enough to be a competitive game where u would usually care about ranks
---
I bet rins feet taste like broken glass
---
Now ppl cant DC for hatch (NOICE)
---
Bubba. If a Bubba sneaks up on you, you're basically screwed.
---
Love the phone, classic Laurie Strode accessory especially over the face...
---
If you are banking on NOED to get kills you already lost the game in terms of emblems and points.
---
Probably would praise Legion players if they would use perks that increases their mobility.
---
Wait, did I just want Legion to become a Meghead?
---
Agreed, I recently had a guy DC on me because I pulled him off a gen he 99% probably was a tap away but he got greedy so I took the easy yoink.
---
Legion has better perks but ghostface is much better. Go with ghostface
---
Yeah but it really won‚Äôt stop the caring or complaining, ranks or no ranks people will complain that they are versing highly skilled players that aren‚Äôt on the same level as them which is why ranks is a thing. Sure there rank system messing up sucks but people aren‚Äôt complaining because they are vrsing a different rank gap they are mainly complaining because they are versing a higher skill killer or survivor to where they have no chance at being successful.
---
Wtf no. You can barely 4K and 2 pip. If you smash survivors you will not 2 pip
---
How does the survivor stun the killer for perk 2? Is this a DS/pallet stun?
---
I think the idea for a survivor bamboozle to be interesting, but it'd have to have some maluses not extra effects, like it's blocked for both survivor and killer, and also have a cooldown like I'm all Ears.
---
Not everyone can hit the great skill check..esp with unnerving 4head
---
Show your feet laurie
---
Gen tapping is extremely slow. If your ruin is making people gen tap, you are getting a lot of value out of it, believe it or not.
---
Totally agree. Why ebony mori still exists is beyond me. Ivory isn't too bad and I don't really mind whether they nerf it or not but ebony needs to go or get nerfed
---
I play Killer and Survivor equally and I disagree...it does just enough if Ruin cant be found quick enough to be worth while....esp if you have 2 ppl on a gen tapping...it goes quickly...not as quick but the difference is not discernible IMO
---
If it‚Äôs at an hour that means you dc‚Äôd a couple of times before. It‚Äôs an unfortunate thing to happen, nonetheless, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll get fixed
---
His gf is a sweat at the game, im pretty sure she got him to play it and they have been playing almost every night.
---
I rather not show my face. Due to not bothering to do make up so early in the morning.
---
Ngl I love when killers use unnerving bc it just makes it easier
---
no its not...its slower...not "extremely" lets dont over exaggerate here...i play both sides...i know...I gen tap all the time if I cant find ruin QUICK...because its a waste of time to look for a hex when you can finish 2 gens by the time you find it in most cases.
---
Survivors actually get dailies ? Weird I‚Äôve never had them.
---
The video shows what's causing it.  Its a loading screen error.  I don't DC but the game refuses to load into games half the time and it's counting that.
---
you sure are full of yourself arent you?
---
Oh ok. Report the bug then. I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt try this out with dedicated servers
---
Dude nothing will stop any community from bitching. But I'm fairly tired of teams losing against me bc they had to play with a rank 20 that can't do much.
---
They get mad and then sometimes the rank 20 gets mad and it all goes to hell if they try to blame the killer like I just wanna play for fun
---
Yes I pump my ego daily &lt;3
---
I don't know how to report it other than get it attention on here
---
Assuming I played well, it's the fault of other survivors in solo queue when I lose games. Killer is there to kill, if they don't they lose. Survivor is there to do the objective, if you're sitting in a corner Self Caring while I'm in a chase we all lose.
---
His name checks out
---
So you agree casual mode will be bad because it doesn‚Äôt take any type of skill it just puts 4 people with all different types of skill together and you hope you have success. 
---
Which is worse then the rank system because it at least gets someone that‚Äôs at least decent depending on your rank.
---
Casual mode  = Rank 20,1,6 and 15 can go against a Rank 6 killer. See what I mean all different skill levels and it will be so much more worse then rank mode.
---
If your party has players who are experienced enough they would do the two simple things: A) They would find the totem and cleanse it or even stumble on another hex that wasn't expected and B) They would do the same thing as your doing but preferably stop when the gen failed the great skill check and continue and going for same sync and use for progress.
---
To repeat, skills checks pop anytime. With or without Ruin. With or without gen tapping. If you're relying on gen tapping too much then you're gonna explode the gen and make regrets but still sometimes seen that players don't blame themselves for doing same mistake over and over.
---
You are wasting more time gen tapping instead of pushing through the skill checks. You don‚Äôt have to believe me but get your friends in a private game and try it out. 
---
Gen tapping is extremely slow.
---
My wife watches me play all the time. Whenever I play as the killer she‚Äôs the one that decides if the survivor I picked up dies or not. she‚Äôs always like ‚Äúnooo let the Steve go he was cute this match‚Äù
---
You can report it on their website but people have already reported the bug, apparently. I see two people who have already reported the bug
---
*laughs in 99'd T2 Myers*
---
Probably. The way I see it is if the exhaustion still goes down even when sprinting (only when due to addons remember) it wont matter too much to competent killers because they'll probably get the second hit in the time frame anyway, but it'll reward the survivor for playing well if they manage to run the killer for that period. Rewards the better player rather than just "oh well guess I ain't using that perk this game" which I don't personally find tilting but I do find it pretty boring
---
I mean, killer is there to kill. That's their job.
---
Sitting in a corner using Self Care while the killer is on me or running straight into the killer while out of position is essentially throwing the game and both of those happen in solo queue more than a killer actually winning by being skilled.
---
Submit a ticket on their website. Hopefully they'll approach as soon as possible.
---
My game just crashed and I got a crash report to send and I still got locked from playing for a minute. Is this going to become a thing?
---
Nah I had to heal tap when I got the skill check glitch and survived the match without doing a single gen, saving everyone and cracking all totems. It was a wild game but I survived. Obviously no one should  heal tap but it does work üòÇ
---
Try running Open Handed with Kindred, it's fucking amazing.
---
It doesn't. Unless they somehow find an exploit to abuse it. Like DCing then checking the perks through it and giving info to swf
---
Well, if they are testing punishments for DC's when there are so many bugs right now that cause people to DC when it's not their fault, it's hardly going to give them great results is it?
---
Of Gen tap WRONG. Most optimal way is not m1 spam, but Hold m1 for half of sec, or 16 Repair points (31 with other teammate), skillcheck never appear if this 16 points, but on 17-18 you can blow a Gen, and this is litlle faster than spam m1, but yeah, still little slower than great skillcheck only, which is hard sometimes.
---
Ok, but like having 99 as Myers is by far the best feeling in the whole game. It's like "You don't know it, but with the slightest tap of this button I can end your game right here and now."
---
Thanks! I'll do it anyway.  Can't hurt to let them know it's affecting multiple people
---
Yea but that's assuming ranking currently even means something every time I mean like yes rank 1s will be better than a rank 20 but rank 10 to 1 is usually the same with the exception that rank 1-3 is more likely meta loadoutes. 
---
But I do hope BHVR can start to balance the game around high skill Survivors and killers and make the rank system fair but I also want a casual mode on the side bc with the new rank reset system I'm eternally stuck at rank 5 and that's not always a place for meme builds or just chill killer days. I don't know how higher ranks is for Survivors
---
Maybe you should try first to improve your internet connection first :)
---
It's not fun for you to get disconnected and it's not fun for other players too.
---
Some tips :
---
- Avoid Wifi connection -&gt; Get an ethernet cable. Wifi increase ping and if you're too far from the router (or there's too many obstacles ) you will often get packet loss which can kick you out of the match. Also most internet providers boxes have really shitty Wifi transmitters which doesn't help to get stable connection :)
---
- Check your open ports : this [site](https://portforward.com/dead-by-daylight/) will give you which ports are required to be opened to optimally play Dead by Daylight
---
- If your internet speed is low : track all bandwith uses and shut the useless ones. -&gt; **Kick in the face** your sister who is downloading all Justin Bieber's songs while you're playing!
---
- If your iternet speed is low it's also maybe time to change your internet provider :) get a better offer! you even could save some money and get a better internet connection at the same time. "Good bye copper wires!" and "Hello fiber!" :D
---
Why is this so downvoted?
---
LOL!
---
The hell was that tbag for?
---
Tbh if you arent hitting like 3/4 greats you really need to practice more rather than gen tapping. So its kinda counter productive for you to gen tap in the long run
---
Ironworks of Misery
---
Play normally until 1 person is dead and at least 1 is on death hook. Then, stop defending gens. Oncr the last gen pops, use NOED and slug.
---
Open the door and pray no-one has adrenaline/unbreakable.
---
In what way because I also use it to run to saves or heals but should I be running across the whole map?
---
Y‚Äôall just complain for the sake of complaining. We got a dope as game on our hands and that‚Äôs the end of it. 
---
I‚Äôve never seen so much whining about a game before. Seriously such a first world problem.
---
Causal would be dope because you don‚Äôt have to expect anything except for whacky games. Ranked is also dope because it‚Äôs way harder and you don‚Äôt always win.
---
I can‚Äôt believe people from this community get so salty and toxic. I say to myself be the change you want to see but it‚Äôs hard when like 90% of this community just hates for the sake of hating. If the game is that bad why does everyone keep playing it haha. I‚Äôm not trying to cause more arguing or debating I‚Äôm just voicing my opinion and have wanted to say something like this for a little while now. Happy gaming my people!
---
Lol thinking they have the money to pay him
---
I tried that, sacrificed one, Blood Warden activated and they just opened the hatch with a key instead. Big sad
---
Self healing (med kit, self care, and maybe perks that heal you like Inner Strength) could be swapped from Altruism to Survival. Maybe add some points for stealth actions like "close call" where you are in close range to the killer but stealth around/away, or you're in a locker and a killer walks by without finding you (once per locker). I think Stealth is within the range of reason to be considered a category to get points for "trying to stay alive". Stealth actions that award blood points would have to take place within a fairly short range so blendettes that hang out on the edge of the map outside of the killers terror radius.
---
Possible, but I've only once encountered a killer who left the last survivor to bleed out, every other killer was legit. Some facecampers, sometimes I got tunneled, by accident or willingly, who knows, but these games are over in a short time. 
---
You don't save much time by DCing, and I prefer a game that punishes me for leaving a match I have every right to leave, than a game that allows another person to doom the whole match because its not going their way.
---
I remember when they added tavern brawl to hearthstone shit was dope
---
Same.. we encountered a cheater and friend was streaming that time.. the killer was oni and the game was good til the end game.. noed popped then suddenly this oni one hitted us while he's across the map.. we were shocked thought we're gonna escape. All we did was report him via in-game and hopr for the best.
---
Reminds me of the game I had last patch where I got a rank 20 Claudette in a lobby I solo queues for at Rank 2 with a Rank 8 Ghostface. Her only perk was Self Care and she couldn't seem to complete skill checks even after Ruin was gone. I felt so bad for her.
---
Exactly and something fun and wacky could be fun and interesting for DbD. I love Tavern Brawl and sometimes I replay Tavern Brawl more then I do ranked mode on hearthstone.
---
Marry her
---
They look more like the constipated gang
---
People don't buy that DLC for Ace, they buy it for Hag and Hex: Ruin.
---
How am I supposed to react to this? What purpose does this image now serve now that I have seen it. I ask myself this a lot..
---
Especially on console. *Shivers*
---
‚ÄúI play both sides‚Äù is beginning to sound like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not racist but...‚Äù
---
Yeah exactly! I have no trouble doing these challenges with the same build...
---
I‚Äôm actually okay with this since I want all survivor perks but don‚Äôt wanna buy em
---
One thing that really helped me is knowing when to abandon chases. Some survivors are really good at looping, but it's rare that you'll get more than 1 REALLY good survivor in a match unless it's SWF. So if they're proving difficult, just try and injure them and then leave and go and patrol gens because even the potato survivors can do gens. And then later on in the game you might find the strong player again and they're out in the open and you can get a quick down on them. You've got to use your time wisely. Ghostface is very good at catching people off guard because of the zero terror radius, so that's even more reason not to bother with long chases against strong loopers. 
---
Avoiding strong loops altogether is another thing. Some loops, usually the map-specific ones in the middle of maps, are termed 'god loops' because they're essentially really strong loops that take no skill for survivors to use and waste a LOT of the killer's time. If a survivor goes there, just leave them and go find someone else. 
---
Watching streamers is another good way to improve so you can see exactly what you need to be doing. 
---
You say you're having difficulty finding people. Just patrol the gens until you do find someone; if no one is doing gens then it's working in your favour. If you know survivors are there and just can't find them, have a quick look around all the nearby rocks etc, and then move on. 
---
And if you're playing trapper, try to put your traps near windows or pallets so survivors can't use the loop without getting trapped, and you're less likely to step into them.
---
Not my fault the timer ran out on their RBT
---
If it‚Äôs not a known bug hopefully the person gets banned or suspended. 
---
As long as a single devs sees this we should be good.
---
When that stealth killer misses his hit as this happens üòì
---
They got rid of that addon after too many survivor mains complained. And she has no collision with survivors whilst phasing now, this part I can agree with
---
At that point you might as well leave in shame
---
This is a trash shrine, but...
---
Seriously give Open Handed a try with the new Kindred. The sheer amount of bullshit you can out a killer through with a strong loop is amazing. 
---
I completely fucked a Myers with a Mori out of using it entirely when he hooked a Meg at the end of the game, when she hook traded with me after he tunneled me all game. Just happened to be at the mine area of Suffocation Pit as well. Kindred basically completely shut down any mindgames he tried to play. She got unhooked and he unloaded T3 into her Borrowed Time while they ran out and I got hatch.
---
It's particularly strong on The Game map in particular where the aura range ignores vertical axis.
---
he* xb
---
/r/dbdlfg for that.
---
She‚Äôs just the better player :(
---
Also peripheral vision is your friend. Keep looking around. He stands out like a sore thumb so I find keeping a track of his movements is a big key to staying away from his attacks.
---
a tad overedited
---
actually its virtually impossible to get a skill check if you are tapping correctly...you cant hold too long..spamming it always works...i never get a skill check...EVER
---
Never healing, taking only gen perks, spending your whole match on gens
---
1. BHVR's map selection algorithm I got Rotten Fields for an hour and a half straight as Killer and Survivor
---
And that's it
---
Hes ranked the highest in kill stats. Hes number 1
---
not if you miss every great skill check....i know enough from experience to not have to test it in a controlled environment.
---
God damn man gamers so thirsty. Cool cosplay. Hope you kept a firm grip on that knife
---
The killer is the entire map and he gives survivors the lick and the monch.
---
Bc nobody wants to play nurse those statistics don't show the whole truth
---
A tier.
---
You'll go up against the top 1% one in every 100 games. It's just statistics. SBMM in casual pretty much forces you to sweat every game to stand a chance - you can't ever 'take a break' because the moment you want to try to win you bump your mmr and if you ever take it easy you just get destroyed.
---
Chasing Simulator &gt; Hide-n-Seek Simulator
---
that test was terrible and he was tapping wrong
---
Yes nerfed, they literally released statistics showing a significant drop in her performance.
---
Okay it's been months since this was posted and I still revisit it occasionally. Honestly one of the best posts to r/deadbydaylight.
---
Yea pallets getting thrown on me is pretty fucking spooky
---
&gt;If slugging wasn't meant to be part of the game then Deerstalker, Flip Flop, Unbreakable, and Tenacity wouldn't exist. 
---
Pretty weak argument when there are Agitation, Barbecue &amp; Chili, Blood Warden, Dying Light, Furtive Chase, Hex: Devour Hope, Hex: Huntress Lullaby, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit, Make Your Choice, Monstrous Shrine, Thrilling Tremors, Aftercare, Babysitter, Boil Over, Borrowed Time, Breakdown, Camaraderie, Decisive Strike, Deliverance, Kindred, Second Wind, Slippery Meat, We'll Make It and We're Gonna Live Forever which are all useless if you just slug everyone and one hook them.
---
Slugging everyone is not the intended way to play, not fun at all for the Survivors and shouldn't be the optimal choice for a Killer.
---
nah the front is sufficient
---
I'm sorry but we CAN NOT get Kelly without Pablo. It's just law
---
your jokes are bad...those are rookie jokes...gotta pump those jokes up
---
What are you talking about? Her default outfit is this outfit. Just without the blood, the ripped shirt and Jamie Lee Curtis' likeness of course.
---
This "cheat" is called terrible work of dedicated servers. From killer's POV you were standing where he was hitting you.
---
I have never received more hate mail from a game then Dbd what is it about this game?
---
Hahahaha s~ame
---
Mm yes hilarious rly the back bone of missing skillchecks
---
Nurse kinda sucks in console so guess it depends if you are on console of pc. Cant really say about her viability cause ive never played on pc.
---
I didn't say slugging, I said camping. Nobody dc's because they get slugged, they would lose all their points, which they likely have a lot of if they are the last survivor. People dc went they are getting camped and tunneled, because they aren't going to GET any points, not are they having any FUN. So they leave. Why should they stick around doing nothing but hanging on a hook mashing a button, so that YOU can have a better game?! The penalties will change absolutely nothing, people will just get themselves hooked and force die, leaving the end result absolutely the same, since the problem is shitty game design in which one player is able to completely prevent another from participating meaningfully in a match, and then rather than just being able to leave and join a new one, that player is expected to try and remain in the match even longer for no reason that will benefit them at all. No shit people leave early.
---
Actually using your brain &gt; Hiding and pressing m1
---
Thats really cool, would love a more phone-friendly res as that would be great as a wallpaper.
---
So a rework will come at one point? Nice :D
---
What would you remove? The Obi Wan maybe?
---
Lmao I never knew Doctor x Wraith was a thing until now
---
Mosr swf I come across just try to sand bag each other. But then again the dev stats can get skewed
---
She's broken good on PC to the point most people that know how to play her don't wanna play her bc 1. People give up and DC 2. It's not a game if there isn't a challenge 3. All u do is blink smack win at least with killers like trapper or even legion u gotta be smarter about it
---
Sometimes I really miss the scary horror part.. But it's also my fault, because I love spine chill so hard haha
---
Ah yeah I remember now, the last perk is make your choice. Since I usually hook and tp its also very very strong.
---
Hello and thanks for your answer !  
---
Sadly for me, I'm the kind of player who thinks the opposite, and I feel kind of "cheated" because you are totally right on the fact that Chasing is waaaaaaay more powerful than hiding !
---
Well u can't DC too often now on PC or switch at least
---
We get it u want minigun
---
Yeah its hard for sure, but its fun, its an actual doable challenge that makes you play uniquely. Dcing is always just a measure of your compassion towards others
---
That isn‚Äòt him. He just changed his name, that‚Äòs why it‚Äòs the exact same username. The real dude is u/Routine-Durian.
---
At least level 10*
---
And so do I :D I really love that perk, helps me to get a little away from the generator I'm working on and feel the stress when I see the killer searching for me :D
---
You stalking me now? Lol
---
\&gt; I also prefer instant down abilities mostly to counter the fact that if I don't use one, the survivors are rewarded for being hit with a speed boost while I get punished with a cooldown.   
---
I can literally see both ur posts on my phone at the same time
---
I made Shirtless myers for a girl i played a lot dbd. We always laughed that shirtless myers is her favourite. So she called him Daddy Myers. 
---
Here's a picture. (Didnt make it in time to color his body. 3d model is handmade from the pictures. If someone wants the model. Dm me)
---

---
The only useful ones are the rag and ones which reduce fatigue and charge cooldowns
---
While those perks are meta for a reason you can very much win playing immersed or with non meta perks. Example I've been running and having a blast is mettle of man, botany knowledge, inner strength last perk I switch around but borrowed time while MoM is active is very fun. The killer goes for unhook or the unhooker and can't get either very satisfying.
---
Hmmm.. i thinm there's no way you can hit 2 person on two different exit gates in less than 5secs.. Even if that's a very bad desync from the dedicated server.
---
So ur saying get lucky bc that's how it worked for me
---
Trapper : oof
---
wtf sorts by new on reddit....nah bre you stalking me or you are a weird lill dude
---
When will you review the latency and absurd hits that are happening on dedicated? Haven't heard a single thing from bhvr about that.
---
Being stealthy deals more damage to the killer when done correctly. But above all its preference people play as they want to metas or whatnot
---
Bc the DVD subreddit is deader then this meme I've seen 2 times now can't wait to see the same meme 3 times soon.
---
And sorting by hot or rising doesn't update as often
---
Freddy currently has the highest kills per trial. Talking tier wise, probarly A. The devs had released some stata awhile ago.
---
I like reading new posts better then top posts and fuck a mini gun chainsaws are much much cooler.
---
Ok boomer
---
Apparently super hard
---
It doesn‚Äôt get much more toxic than this one.
---
The more people that play dbd the better.
---
I don't know the scenarios but if you voice your opinion respectfully then you don't deserve to get down voted. If you voice your opinion in a disrespectful and belittling manner then it makes sense.
---
FeelsDankMan
---
Do whatever you want but don‚Äôt complain when someone gets mad at you for sitting on a hook with your cannibal
---
1) Don‚Äôt play in green ranks as nearly every killer just camps or tunnels.
---
Think, "do players really want to slug extremely often just to counter a single perk?"
---
Aahh wow its anne mateo im from ph too, you used to do dota2!
---
T-bagging sure is not cool. Your second point though, to me, proves that you'll feel weaker as a stealhy player, and winning this way feels pretty rewarding.
---
I‚Äôve tried to boop the snoot in EVERY pig game I‚Äôve played survivor. It has never worked. D:

30 seconds? I just dc'd first time and got slapped with 5 minutes
---
I completed it by luck. It was rank 1 pc, solo on shelter woods against a legion. At one point I was downed and a very kind and loving Bill body blocked a potential basement hook for me. All the gens got done, I jumped in the hatch and was finally done with that shit.
---

No one is questioning your girlfriend. We are just wondering why you posted this when it is deathly similar to a pre-existing post? She's not guilty of reposting, you are :P
---
Yes it's her.. I'm her friend.. she used to stream dota2 on twitch.. now she's streaming on FB..
---
I love the concept of dying light but man it's just not that good in it's current state ull get more use out of thana and sloppy combo
---
Can we all just call it quits this shit is just looking stupid, have a good one y‚Äôall!
---
See? You're part of the problem. You're expressing an opinion that makes zero sense when you think about it. I expressly said that in some cases/powers, those behaviors were unfair; Cannibal is one of them, clearly. I wouldn't camp with him, nor would I hiding with Scream or Myers. I'm not against people getting mad at unfair practices, I'm against people not trying to understand what's around them and just whinning because their whims arn't being satisfied.
---
Just get an IV for water duh
---
I play a lot of Ace when I play survivor and I get misplaced a lot. He's ungodly quiet when slugged. If you slug an Ace in any map with grass you better take very good notes on where you left him. I've bled out more than I've been found.
---
That man is used to being fucked up on the ground, apparently
---
Holding someone hostage is also bannable - e.g. if you're the killer and you have a survivor blocked into a corner and you never let him go until he DC's. Also doing the double killer bug is bannable even tho I'm not sure if it even still exists
---
Hey gotta make sure noed doesnt spawn
---
From his POV you were 99% on same place so it wouldn't be hard for him to do that.
---
November 2018 was when it was released for free on PS+ (Maybe even October, it's hazy)
---
Another cool map would be Pablo‚Äôs Uncle‚Äôs farm from the first season. Great concepts here though.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
You mean spending your whole match on doing the objective so you can win said match? Healing is a waste of time anyway if u know how to loop, its why many red rank players dont heal. Other than prove thy self name me another decent gen perk.
---
I'm sorry, I don't know how to answer that, I don't understand your point. Yes? I like the game and I'm having fun playing it?
---
Thanks, mate. Times flies. Could have sworn it was longer!
---
Or dont get mad when the exact thing happens you (OP). I remember names of camping/tunneling killers and then camp and tunnel them when i see them as survivor in the hopes that they see its a horrible "strategy". 
---
What OP fails to realise is that these "strategies" are hurtful to the game itself. No one likes being tunneled or camped. People will stop playing if it happens too often.
---
well if u aint gonna mute it do you think it is fair to come here and complain about it when you should know the DBD community and most other PvP games has a strong down look on campers. 
---
I personally have stopped trying my hardest and now go for dumb shit like when I play trapper I put a trap in the most ridiculous of places. 
---
also insulting is a form of complaining they are clearly unhappy there is nothing u can do about that besides playing with the intent of giving everyone a fair chance to win, ofc you don't have to but if you play in a way that makes people mad then that should be a call that this is a fruitless effort for nothing.
---
At most you can mute it or o with it and not complain bc when you are in the game you can not complain about the players when you are fully choosing to listen.  
---
but I am not gonna tell u how to play u do u and I will do what I do just consider "is killing this survivor right now fun for them and is letting them escape something I can turn around on" I often give survivors a chance to come back from a bitter loss they dont always like that thinking I am BMing but the ones that do make the game last longer and we end up having a good game still.
---
I don't complain about how survivors play ofc we can all get mad but it just becomes a worthless cycle of "survivor pisses killers off and killers go vent like on here to survivors get annoyed and insult the killer more to the killer and survivors having a shit day"
---
No matter how you argue, camping is a pity cheap tactic which is unfair, even in DBD. Don't whine because you got called out and reported.
---
I mainly remember because all my friends got it for free, and like a month later after Black Friday, (where I was going to buy a new PS4, but didn't) my ps4 broke heavily.
---
This has me laughing my ass off, it‚Äôs amazing!
---
*Oink*
---
If the best you can come up with as killer is camping, than say goodbye to your BP.
---
It works solely once or twice until the survivors have seen through your tactics, even the hooked one won't complain about a lack of sportsmanship of the other 3 won't unhook.
---
That's actually what I try to do most of the time^^ 
---
Those are great advices, but that wasn't my point. I'm not saying camping/tunneling is the best strategy (actually I don't even understand camping being efficient), I'm just saying it's not an unfair one.
---
I got it first try. Luckily for me, it was a camping killer on Hawkins Lab, so I did gens near him and got that sweet speed boost by just looking in his direction. Felt like a scumbag because he had NOED, I opened the gate and left. I wasn't trying to be a hero, I knew if I didn't get it there, I wasn't going to get it for another day or two. If not for NOED, killer wouldn't have gotten a single kill. I opened the gate, team tried to unhook the one survivor he got all game and got caught.
---
camping and tunneling can be viable strategies in certain situations, however the problem is when its the go-to strategy from the start of the game. It ruins the game for everyone else.
---
Also if you need to do that to win then you must be low ranks. Camp and tunnel stops winning against good survivors because it doesnt generate much pressure.
---
Camping doesn‚Äôt help either side. You won‚Äôt get many points if you camp 1 or 2 players throughout the game while the gens are done and it‚Äôs the same case for the survivors in terms of chases or altruism.
---
Here's the stats btw,  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/).
---
The game gets even MORE killer sided as you rank up, not less as this community would have you believe.  3k - 4ks are the norm not "bad games" for the survivors.  But the moment a killer misses his swing on dead hard and misses his 6th 4k in a row they nerf that perk too.
---
Love how you can see the horror in Claudette‚Äôs eyes when Trapper gives her the thumbs down.
---
So instead of facecam yourself, you try to sound like an anime char and put a facerig overlay on top? To stay anonymous or wat?
---
Yes rewarding. And playing stealthy does not mean playing selfishly. I think you are generalizing a little here. I‚Äôd rather die too rescuing as much as I can than escaping alone. Chasing for long might be fun to you, but think about the killer‚Äôs perpective. How is that fun to run around walls and eating pallets through all the map for 2min only to get one hook and see 3 gens pop ? :/
---
I was told Wraith is good bc all u need to worry about is 1. sneaking and 2. hitting
---
They haven't nerfed DH and there is nothing to nerf on DH
---
Yeah ruin is a headache but not a game stopper. That's like saying if you have decisive strike you're guaranteed to survive.
---
ye...especially on high ranks you should be able to hit greats, know where it can be
---
Imagine being so entitled to protect a tactic that literally no game nor any player really supports that you spit out collums of empty phrases and repetitions but no real response.
---
Did you know that many games even punish camping? i HaVe No IdEa WhY.... /s
---
relatable
---
Jesus, you're the third one in 30 minutes. I'm going to start answering by quoting myself.
---
Dude, I DO NOT tunnel. Nor do I camp. I've said it in my post. I'm not complaining because I'm sad about how people want to play the game because it impeds my way of playing, I'm mad because people go around spouting whatever crap goes through their head just because they want everything to go their way and don't want to have to think about it.
---
Also, no it doesn't. Ruin the game, I mean. You're contradicting yourself! Camping ruins the game, but it's useless against good survivors? It can't be both, mate. And I agree with the second one. I don't think camping is a good strategy, but those strategies being good or bad was not my point.
---
They testing it right now so penalties are favorable by intent
---
Looks pretty good
---
He was just camping the pallet
---
Damn I wish there was actual figures of DBD this looks so good!
---
I mean you still can run in circles
---
Probably not because his name is copyrighted.
---
Im a long time rank 1-2 legion main and I only average 1-2kills a game. I wouldnt say I am bad but if you dont tunnel this is how it is. Legion has so many flaws but oh well its fun and his power gives you brutal killer a lot.
---
This glitch can randomly fix itself when you‚Äôre rehooked so imo the best option is to get crows so the killer hooks you again and see if it fixes itself

---
This sounds more like a rant than a discussion tbh but soab, I‚Äôm in.
---
There are many things that can greatly increase your odds at surviving but it all boils down to wasting the killers time as much as you can: loop, juke, stun, blind, force whiffs, rescue, tag in and out of chases, etc‚Ä¶ (completing center/secluded gens early so that the killer has a harder time patrolling as the game progresses is key, too!)
---
Hex: Ruin is easier to counter than people think; perks like Small Game, Detective‚Äôs Hunch and/or using a map can go a long way if you don‚Äôt have a general idea to where totems spawn on each map, even better if you play on comms with someone.
---
suicide on hook now, ez quit
---
&gt;I just wish they'd give me my legacy back too
---
You think we're ever gonna get them back? It's weird having the P3 L50 achievement unlocked 3 years ago but also not having a character beyond P1
---
I really can't believe how nasty everyone is being in the thread.... Didn't think people would be so pissed that they couldn't DC without penalty lol
---
I main hag and i can tell you that is 100% false.
---
I win a little more playing killer than survivor but thats because i only solo que and killer is for solo queing. What killer do you play because if your out here maining wraith then i can see why your losing
---
Yeah, sure, right after no counter keys and DS get nerfed, because otherwise this would be extremely unfair for killers in case survivor would be running deliverance or/and DS or/and key.
---
There was no heavy sign of lag or even latency which there usually is
---
&gt; You know, the survivor you hooked isn't an AI, but another player that can't participate in the game anymore once you start camping.
---
Funny you should say that. I ran into a streamer who apparently does nothing but play insidious LF and facecamps from the start of the match. I went to his stream to see what the heck was wrong with him and he just went on and on about "entitled whiny survivors" and "I don't care one bit about them or their fun, they might as well be bots." He laughed when people killed themselves on hook and kept track of how many people DC'd against him. Also bragged about his kill rate... since no one cares to play against that shit, they just want out asap.
---
And you have no intelligible response to defend your opinion
---
Dude... Read a book. Like, for real. You don't understand how logic and argumentation work. At first I was pissed at you because you were trying so hard to insult me, now I'm starting to feel sorry for you.
---
And since you obviously need the help, I'm talking about how you went and picked and example that has nothing to do with anything just to emphasize the point you're trying to make, which is a common use of a straw man argument ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw\_man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)); while completely overlooking my point. As I said in my post, I know it's not fun to be camped. I've also said that rules should not be about who gets the more fun, but about fairness. And as I also said, I know how to play the game, I'm pretty good at it, I'm not using cheap tactics, and you're right, you loose BP and will get owned by good players if you try to camp too much. I was already aware of that.
---
Would just get camped anyway then put back on hook even if they kobed
---
hag plays very different from other killers and wraith sucks without addons.
---
But what if they didn‚Äôt get camped?
---
im sorry was I meant to care after 4 hours?
---
Ever happened to you that a survivor got saved off hook and a gen popped literally the second their feet touched the ground? That's how this shit feels.
---
Unironically as a new player this is exactly what I thought the first time I loaded into Haddonfield, just to see Clown in a Santa outfit in around the start of June
---
I dunno, I agree with you. You should be able to attempt but devs ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The worst ever iridescent huntress I‚Äôve gone agains was: iridescent head, soldier belt, insidious, noed, hex:ruin and blood warden

I have seen that once. But then again, i have seen weird stuff with the RBTs.
---
Honestly that sounds like a solution at this point. At least if dead by daylight ever becomes VR it will be easy to reveal him.
---
No matter how much effort *I* put in, the stars still have to allign for the challenge to even be doable.

You're... Quite amazing. I've answered another one of your comments, you should go check it out. I really advise you to go read the Wikipedia article I've sent you, I think you'll find it interesting. Gods know you need it.
---
So that addresses Lightborn, but not the other problems.
---
There are currently some problems, probably a bug. *Should* be fixed.
---
But if it‚Äôs advocated why can you report it at the end of the game?
---
r/woosh
---
I am curious how they where cheating also, as far as I know, there is no way to formally report people u could try going to the DBD discord seeing if a community manager is online dm them and report it with proof
---

I would love to see one but doubt it would happen. They created an original character and licensed the appearance. it might be possible since I would expect canon is the only thing stopping them from tomes for other licensed characters. They said with the tomes they wanted to give some backstop they haven't shown before. They could do this with their ghost face but their hands could be tied based on what they had approved with the license holder.
---
removed uncivil
---
Quite possibly the worst shrine I have ever seen
---
It was a Nea player with about 4 hours in the game, at first I just assumed it was some SWF sorta deal. In the game though I noticed that she was running around without scratch marks after I started chasing her, but she faulted a little earlier so I just thought it was somehow Dance With Me. But after 2 people had died I could absolutely notice that she had speed hacks as well as no scratch marks. I also couldn't ever get a chase to initiate with her but that could be because of jank, dead by daylight being dead by daylight. Only reason I could down her was because she was actually an idiot and played as if she really had only 4 hours playtime. On top of that, I'm pretty sure she was able to crawl through the closed exit gate, but I watched her and stopped her before she could just get away. It felt really good to facecamp her though!

---
Oh shit that's right
---
Completely agree. I actually never realized camping could be efficient if everyone came at the same time - it gets the survivor back, but does slow them down. Still though, not very nice.
---
I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm looking at right now
---
Wait yeah I want this too
---
you are looking at dead by daylight mobile
---
You don't want to know, dude. Trust me
---
&gt; You spend less time in the penalty than you do slugged on the floor for the 4k.
---
*buzzer noise* it takes 4 minutes to bleed out at the very most. LESS than that due to time elapsed from being downed earlier in the match. Besides the very first leave, [all penalties are greater than 5 minutes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ec05r0/disconnection_penalty_lengths_tested/?st=k4bajk7h&amp;sh=a55f0f8d)
---
Bring unbreakable if being slugged is that frustrating.
---
I use Huntress' flannel coat with her bear skull mask cuz the fur from both blend and look amazing, or sometimes I'll use the hallowed blight body with the bear head cuz the face looks so cool
---
LATVIA??? What??? The hoodie I got shipped from NC.
---
Devs have such a hard on for licence killers people keep saying it's not the ghostface from the movie well guess what he is named ghostface he looks like ghostface he stalks like ghostface so my conclusion is that it is ghostface
---
Borrowed Time gets used and the survivor is put in the Deep Wound status.
---
One thing is being hard, one thing is annoying. Forcing a red rank killer to use for example: Distressing or Monstrous shrine is not good. Some survivor challenges promote farming your teammates too.
---
Yea it's dbd mobile what about it?
---
That's the thing. I'm joining servers with 44ish ping. Recently i made a post about it and argued it's hitboxes. Long story short according to him it aint. It's supposed to be a latency thing. How can i join a server that shows me low ping but ingame i get these weird hits. And it doesn't feel like latency at all. Like it's not delayed or anything. It's just that when a killer swings it adds another 4-6 feet to the swing. For me p2p with green ping was loads better then the current dedicated servers with green ping
---
but that's a lot of crybabies
---
Aw crap x) sorry for you mate, that must have been horribly frustrating. Hope you could find a new PS4 for cheap!
---
I don‚Äôt know if you know this, but if you can‚Äôt access your PS4, you can still get the games directly on the website if you log in with your account. : )
---
Exactly I have stopped running ruin on most of my killers. Corrupt Intervention I find is a much better delay perk. You get a guarenteed time where certain gens are unavailable. Yes most of the time the survivors will just open chests and cleanse dull totems or camp gens waiting for it to end but for killers that need set up time like Hag or trapper it is more dependable than ruin.
---
I believe in "no-makeup wednesdays". Trust me, confidence is key. Everyone is beautiful, and you sure as hell classify in the "no makeup category.
---
P.s: Laurie Strode didn't wear no makeup in the movies, so the cosplay isn't 100% accurate :) We hope to see an accurate one soon!
---
If it's not about the makeup, but personal security, then I understand. Just wanted to point these things out because you mentioned not wanting to show your face because you had no makeup :)
---
Because as legit as tunneling can be - since you could work around there - campaign clearly isn't
---
Last survivor should be moriable. He shouldn't mind it cuz he's dead anyway
---
Change MY mind
---
What the fuck is even this post
---
yeah but is it too much to expect bhvr to have some rational thinking sometimes.   
---
the timer choice shouldnt be that hard you can look at other games as well.

All they to do now is to fix the game breaking bugs and crashes to prevent any discrepancies, and possibly tweak it if need be, then I think it should be good

---
Same thing happened with my key :(
---
What do you mean? Their support site works and reports are handled accordingly as long as there's adequate proof.
---
Keep in mind it could have been a glitch don‚Äôt always assume someone is hacking especially given how buggy the game has been ever since the oni was added   
---
I know specifically that there is a sprint burst glitch to where you keep speeding because it never registers it ending. So know that could have been the case. 
---
As for the scratch marks? Likely a combination of the fact that this nea was in the sprint burst glitch
---
No I was thinking that everyone joins the match then they do the role off, then it chooses a killer out of the 5
---
Where's the DBD?
---
U press the button and it pops out from thin air
---
Okay that makes a lot more sense ya.
---
People have been disconnecting their Ethernet cables to keep items and avoid derank for years, its an old trick at this point so they need to punish it.
---
Aaaand I keep seeing the votes fluxing up and down. Jesus
---
I wonder if I‚Äôve seen you before, I‚Äôve seen a few legions on PS4 get perfect games in red ranks, more than any other killer surprisingly
---
I feel you... I never really played much killer before but I bought ghost face 3 weeks ago and been maining him and I‚Äôve managed to climb from 20 to 2 without much difficulty...
---
1. Flashlight the killer they're hooking the survivor. The animation should be long enough that you get the blind. Doesn't really help with Lightborn but I haven't seen that many people take Lightborn personally.
---
2. It sucks needing everyone to live that long but once you get there it's relatively easy. Force the EGC to start by opening the gate and then rush injured people with empathy and borrowed time. You dont have to live you just have to get the safe unhook.
---
Tbh nobody would play this given the culture of the game now. There are strict survivor players and strict killer players WHO NEVER CROSS over. I just it would lead to people DCing if they become killer like Friday the 13th and then DBD will eventually do something to really punish or prevent the quitting and then people won‚Äôt even use that game mode anymore
---
Yeah
---
It's all that sweet RNG plus sometimes it's annoying when gates spawn miles away from each other and I just closed hatch oop didn't have time oh well GG RNG be like that
---
You‚Äôre acting like Gen Z
---
Unlikely, you're in NA?
---
Is NA North America? Sorry I‚Äôm dumb lol
---
Yes lol
---
That dude 1 bloodpoint off 10k tho
---
Then yea I‚Äôm in North America
---
We won't get any further here. My opinion is that you shouldn't DC but struggle to keep a camping killer busy and help your team, or run decisive to stop the tunnelers sometimes. Your opinion is that you can DC when you don't have any fun and won't get anything out of the game, since its a waste of time and helps tunnelers/campers.
---
If I got it right, I guess both opinion are justifiable.
---
I want to believe that the first thing you did was stand in the door and started crouching and standing fast and turning the light on and off, at the same time while aiming it at your teacher
---
This is a very ungroovy gaming moment
---
Fuck this I want Sidney Prescott!
---
As a legion main, this puts a very large, twisted smile on my face. Definitely making the my background for my phone
---
I can promise you, things on both sides get nerfed. Within just the last little bit some of Freddys addons, and the Oni had a nerf. Not too long ago they hit Nurse, and Spirit to a degree. Legion gets hit all the time, and Pig to name another. Killers get it too.
---
I do agree with the Devs being incompetent to an extent, but on the flipside, it's a really whiny community that is always go ding something wrong with something.  They mainly need to work on differentiating legitimate complaints, and people complaining over just being salty.
---
Now as for getting rid of moris and Ruin, I agree and disagree. I don't like Moris. I main Ghostface, have him at P3 Lv50 with a proverbial shit load of ebonies, but I don't use them. They end the game too fast, and just zap the fun. Where most people disagree with me is that I feel the same way about keys. I don't think either one is good for the game, and I'd be happy if both were erased from existing.
---
Now Ruin, you're flat out wrong on. Gens get done stupid fast, and not every killer can dish out enough pressure all the time to take advantage of other repair time oriented perks. Not only that, it's RNG if the thing is even gonna last longer then thirty seconds. Ruin is perfectly fine.
---
My neck hurts
---
So no double XP?
---
I‚Äôm near Mexico
---
That is true. I'm not against people getting mad, I'm against people trying to impose their rules based on what they like most. There is a difference between those yelling at me because they didn't enjoy my play (or showing it to me with T-bags), and those who sent me copious amount of insults, report me, and tell me I \*can't\* play this way. I don't mind the first ones, but the second ones are a problem that goes far beyond the scope of the game.
---
I mean, I can agree with both. Sounds cool to me to let the last survivor unhook but also get potentially even spookier treatment from the killer.
---
However multiple last survivors just sitting on hook wasting the killer's time would be annoying bullshit.
---
Some graphic details? 3 more perks? Idk
---
well not everyone understand basic stuff...
---
At least you repent for your sins against Survivors
---
Same thing happened with me, I almost never played killer then I got plague just to try her out and now I play her as much as survivor
---
lol that's exactly what I did haha
---
The Meg, Dwight, and Huntress outfits will be releasing today
---
Danny devito
---
Some killers have low map pressure
---
Lets completley ignore how unfun you make the game for all players by camping and tunneling which to be frank is a completley valid reason to complain to the killer. 
---
Even gameplay wise Camping and tunneling are poor plays for the most part particulalry at high ranks due to BT and DS. If you tunnel a good survivor you will likely have a long time to get them back on a hook and more importantly you are applying zero pressure to the other 3 survivors, at least 2 will be able to just sit on gens. Leaving the hook to pressure other parts of the map slows gens immensly and is the main way killers achieve victory
---
Yes some survivors are ridiculous and expect to be ignored but acting like tunneling/camping is a very viable approach in game is daft. 
---
Even at endgame etc youd be better off going for another survivor or trying to bait an unhook rather than just sitting there and trying to tunnel a guy
---
Yes! Also, that's a nice sub, thanks for sharing.
---
Poor excuse imo if I can everyone busy as bubba then u can get everyone busy as every killer in the game at rank 5
---
Which just saying A LOT of people play that way and have that frame of mind. I don‚Äôt but yeah a lot of people do that.
---
Hey /u/uniontattoo you have an insta and/or FB?  This is great.
---
2 years ago they were nerfed and havent been touched since. The game's different now
---
I had a team that did that to me the other day but when I found them they were all 4 in the same corner so I ended up stabbing each person like 4 times I‚Äôve never done that before lol.
---
No worries, I like having a good laugh by reading the nonsense you write
---
Everyone on here complaining about this timer saying it hurts survivors stuck in bugs or slugged, these issues do NOT happen every game or even every other game so even if you DC in those situations it should be of barely any penalty to you since the timer starts at fucking 30 seconds. Stop creating issues that aren't there. You do not DC enough \_for legitimate resons\_, to be mad about this
---
Now imagine this as a portrait on your wall. I demand one!
---
The Bloodhunt is double XP
---
Cool. If you want I will speak using one of my mother languages, then I'll judge your grammar, what about that?
---
If you can even understand one of em ofc
---
&gt; I'm a killer main 
---
&gt; Moris are completely balanced
---
Hmm
---
Probably 1
---
thanks dad
---
That‚Äôs a lie lol. You can get them at any point
---
Especially when you don‚Äôt get hit the entire game and lose it by the exit gate.
---
Because they‚Äôre the saltiest
---
Why it sideways
---
Yeah I just get tired of getting a constant influx of spongebob dbd memes in my feed, so I just left the sub. problem solved.
---
if he does it after borrowed time is activated? it'll cancel your frenzy
---
Here's a video by Scott Jund where he goes over how to properly chase:
---
https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
It would be difficult to explain how to best counter loops and chase strategies by only typing it out. Watch Scott's video, and like I've been saying watch other good killer players. They'll teach you how to optimally counter loops, and how to do little tricks and maneuvers to throw survivors off their game.
---
You should learn the difference between safe and unsafe loops, and also mindgame-able loops and no mindgame loops. If you can rotate from one end of the pallet to the other before a survivor can vault over it then that's an unsafe loop. If the loop obstructs the survivor's view of you while they run it then that's a mindgame-able loop. Again, watch other players to learn strategies to do in all of these situations. A piece of advice for safe and no mindgame loops is to just brute force through them. Just chase the survivor in a straight line until you either hit them or they throw the pallet down. There's really nothing else you can do at a safe no mindgame loop unless your killer power allows you to, and unless it's to secure your first hit Legion's Frenzy won't help you at these. Learn when and how to break pallets. If it's an unsafe loop then you'll just be wasting your time breaking the pallet during a chase, so only do so when outside of a chase. When you do break a pallet while in a chase though be aware of yours and the survivor's positioning. You can limit their routing depending on which side you break the pallet on and where the survivor is positioned when you do go to break it. So if you're chasing someone around a pallet one side might lead to another loop but the other might lead to a dead zone. It may sound obvious, but try to break the pallet so the survivor is positioned on the side that leads to a dead zone. That way it's easier for you to catch up and to potentially end the chase faster.
---
Something I forgot to mention is you should play DbD with headphones if you aren't already, it makes a world of difference. Sound is so crucial when playing killer. You need to listen for survivor breathing, footsteps, groans of pain, if their working on a gen, cleansing a totem, searching a chest, etc. Can't tell you how many times I only knew a survivor was near because I heard grass shuffle or them breathing. Don't play killer while listening to music either, the sounds you need to listen for are already subtle enough.
---
Replaces all hooks with leashes.
---
They know, it just sucks. Lithe is only good at specific windows. If you fast vault a upper level window, you waste a 1-2 seconds of your speed boost from fall/stagger. If you vault a window where your facing the edge of the map/no second loop you wasted your lithe because you need to sit at the window and watch where the killer goes. 
---
Its nutty for distance when you get the right conditions, but its too situational.
---
Literally never see them miles away anymore. It used to be common, now they‚Äôre right next to each other every time.
---
I wonder if that kills benevolence
---
* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
I wouldn‚Äôt care if I dropped my item I just care that I lost 21k bloodpoints
---
Both buffed and nerfed, the fact that some perks and builds don't work too well certainly sucks, but the speed changes make the actual ability work way better.
---
the joke went way over your head i see
---
When you're so stealthy, you camouflage your words in your pwn t-shirt
---
Let's be honest, like theyve done every other time, they'll just keep the dc ban without actually fixing all the bugs. So enjoy :)
---
If the survivors running deliverance they shouldn't be punished for being the last to go down...
---
Franklins is the perfect counter to flashlights, brand new parts, good toolboxes, keys, firecrackers, medkits etc.
---
It may be an asshole perk but it's the only counter to disable survivors items.
---
D strike and dead hard exist, back in the day I can remember two times when this mechanic saved me
---
He's not. The one meme is talking about (a friend) watching your (stream) and is saying that he's happy that your die. This one is about a gf or bf watching his or her bf / gf playing Killer and killing the survivors that bullied him or her before, idk, but to me that's a completly different meme only using the same picture.
---
"You can report them" is what bhvr would say but they never do anything about the reports. So enjoy your shit teammates/killers. Pretty good job so far. :)
---
I barely even get to use it because people just switch to their items at the last second
---
Or just get rid of the mechanic all together
---
You Can't everyone busy as Bubba if you arent playing dirty
---
yeah, he's really good, highest kill rate at all ranks and you don't even need to use a single gen perk if you're good at him
---
I was one of the few people that survivors actually liked playing against when legion still had so many exploits since I didn't use them, really shocked me when people would say that they actually had fun playing that when they were thinking that it was gonna be super annoying ect.
---
If the party is me being controlled by an ominous entity which will punish me if I don't murder people trapped in walled areas, yeah, I'm not really fun.
---
fOuNDtHeMObiLeUsER
---
That's kinda how it works afaik.
---
&gt;You seem to put a lot of emphasis on chases as a requirement and I don't think that's as big of an obstacle as you make it out to be. 
---
Suure.. because the game isn't around chases at all right?.. 
---
&gt;When I play killer at red ranks (with Pig no less for instance), chases rarely ever last longer than a minute. Very few survivors get anywhere near that long without me making a crucial mistake - the primary reason why chases ever go longer than a minute for me. 
---
I'd like to see that while using Freddy, Trapper, wraith or anyone really, in any God loop. Using a non mindgamable loop being forced to break pallets to even get a chance to catch to people.
---
 I'm gonna ask again, from where you play? Here in EU people know every loop since you hit rank 10. Isn't difficult and they are pretty competitive (I'm not excluded ofc)
---
&gt;I also think 5-7 minutes is lowballing how long an average game lasts. It's possible if the team is a coordinated SWF (rare), or if they all happen to be skill check gods (also rare), or if I just play like complete shit.
---
Rare? I might have the worst luck in the world since whenever I play killer 1/4 games are not super sweaty survivors doing pretty good. Plus hit skillchecks with ruin isn't a big deal even for an average player like me, be a "God at skillchecks" isn't a thing if you have a pair of functional hands. You might miss a few but takes just few seconds from finishing it
---
&gt;That's not even considering how much pressure I'm applying with downing survivors and the fact that there are a lot of potato red survivors that can barely last 30 seconds. So most games for me - the ones I've timed anyway - drift closer to 8-9+ minutes.
---
There are, that's for sure. Still, I guess I have the worst of luck as well as many others like me in this region. Plus I won't care much about it when I suggested a pair situation in skill not a dumb player against a smart one. I was taking into consideration the most experienced players in a vacuum, of course variables exists like I mentioned but you totally ignored from my argument by stating a scenario where the opposite isn't even conceived.
---
At least I put 5 people into consideration where both sides were equally skilled. Of course this scenario won't always occur, especially now with matchmaking issues and people bringing low rank friends who are clueless in red ranks.
---
In any way squads that are actually just focusing on winning exist and are not at all rare. If you look it up for people looking for groups or when people invite you to join them, they are super focused on winning and depiping the killer. I've been there, seen it and experienced that my dude
---
&gt;That's a lot of time to get 3 hits and I don't really tunnel either. When I'm using a mori for a daily, I just play normally and use it whenever I feel like it without needing to mentally shift gears. And I think if you're struggling to get a second hook on any survivor, that game is going poorly anyway.
---
You are from America for sure if games goes for 9+min for you..
---
&gt;So I guess for me, a mori is consistently way more likely to proc and influence a game compared to a key, where I need to rely on good randos to do generators and last somewhat long against a red rank killer, or that I'm not one of the first survivors dead. Moris are much more reliable. That's my experience at least.
---
Yeah I guess.. I played with some American guy and they are so bad even at red ranks. Can't even hit skillchecks or do gens, something I don't experience much playing solo
---
Yeah because survivors should have every single second chance they can get to get out
---
wrong
---
doubt it bc I haven't seen any BPS since the last event
---
Same here partnerüôå but I'm sure you've also been called a sweaty bastard? Granted you played "fairly"
---
Fartnite bad!!!
---
I know u cant lag switch but who knows what wacky fucking hacks are out there
---
i thought they fixed that glitch? i haven't seen it since they said they did atleast
---
That's what I thought when you suggested a noed rework, but here we are
---
Not true at all. I've actually managed to escape more times than not if I end up in the situation where the hatch gets closed and I have to open the door.
---
First take the door which has more stuff in front of it so the killer can't see it clearly. Then hide nearby and wait for him to come and check the door and as soon as he leaves open the door just enough that the first light doesn't turn on. Then hide again and as soon as he's checked the door again go back and open the door. Even if you see him coming it's always better to hold on till the very last second.
---
Using this method I manage to escape more often than not.
---
I realize that sometimes this simply doesn't work. If the doors are too close or there's no visual obstructions between them or you're dealing with a stealth killer, it of course becomes way harder. It is simply up to the RNG.
---
I get one every 10 or so webs
---
Noed is a genuinely unhealthy perk, adrenaline is just good.
---
Wow thank you very much for this tipps :o
---
I will play the wraith then as well later today and give it my best.
---
Balanced, Nea's perk
---
there are no killer perks that can nullify your offerings or addons xP but yes to items but not like killers can take items with them
---
Great Cosplay! It looks great!
---
"No counter keys..." 
---
Let me introduce you to #Franklins demise#
---
Bold of you to assume I have friends.
---
It's fine. If I DC because I was tunneled or face-camped (for no reason), then you are just giving me time to reflect on why I play this crap game. In fact, it makes me want to exit and play something else. So, keep going with this policy and see where it gets you. Oh, I'll tell you where it gets you . . . even longer queue times then before. 
---
TLDR: If BHVR isn't going to punish the bad behavior (face camping etc.) beyond point loss, then we have to punish it by taking the matter into our own hands and DC'ing. Keep this up and people will just drop your bugged game.
---
Well that was out of my knowledge so there u go ig u can still get them
---
You might get out sure but I dont get anyway who looks as escaping hatch/door after hatch close as a win. You,ve lost and got your pity escape, its like getting one guy with NOED
---
You could miss all the ruin skillchecks while forcing the gen through, and it will still be faster than gen tapping.
---
Because they‚Äôre trying to derank before the new tome comes out so they have an easier time doing the challenges. Which isn‚Äôt fair to the survivors they‚Äôll be playing later trying to do their challenges.
---
I prefer to be a runner instead, but for some tome missions, I've become more inmersed. My normal build would usually be Lithe, Quick &amp; Quiet, Dance with me and Iron Will, which is a but of an immersed build, but I use it to gain distance and get a breather before the next chase. When I want to play fully immersed I usually play Iron Will, Spine Chill, Premonition and Calm Spirit. It sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't. The smaller the survicor team becomes, the less usefull an immersed build becomes as well in my opinion.
---
Hate legion. Love this tho.
---
This was a good episode.
---
Yeah, legit my builds never even focused on deep wound (never really gave a shit about it anyways and with how it was changed there's pretty much no real threat to it anymore üò¢) and instead focused on getting everyone injured as fast as possible (duration and speed increasing add-ons)
---
basically what I was saying. no one cares about twitch streamers and their annoying chat. they will always aid the streamer no matter what.
---
You‚Äôd really expect them to do something like that?
---
Third is 15 minutes
---
but one game last night, i played against someone who was pretending to be stuck in the glitch(cuz during the glitch your character is perma running in circles) and when i went to hit him, he dead harded and ran out of the basement. i felt betrayed
---
He should have the chance just like everyone else. And if he success, he gets bloodpoints.
---
It‚Äôs really funny, because when I got my first save I was playing Quentin cause it‚Äôs too easy to find flashlights on low blood webs. I was trying to get blind 4 times (I eventually got it with a new Ghostface and he agreed to farm.) and Billy picked Feng up, bam, injured me comes up for the save. I got it. Then the blind 4 times wasn‚Äôt even activated :(. I got the flashlight save from a trapper after blinding and no save
---
Imagine complaining about DS in December 2019
---
If this change were to happen, you are 100% getting camped. 
---
Even with DH and DS, the killer can hit you before you can actually move and then just wait the 60 sec (the most boring 60 sec of a lifetime).
---
Let me introduce you to: plunderer's instinct; small black stealthy model of keys in lobby, asspull key during the match and many more.
---
I just dropped a million points into my oni right now, and I have 6 party streamers for him. I think your talking out your arse m8
---
You'd expect them to give us anything for free?
---
If keys are so hard to see then it makes Franklin's even better. Hit them once and then they waste time searching for something that is basically impossible to see on certain maps.
---
Unlike a lot of fan-made perks, i could see these in the game. 
---
Useful, some situational, not OP.
---
What were you high on? I want the same
---
I‚Äôm 90% sure that they can differentiate between the 2. I don‚Äôt have pc or switch tho so idk
---
r/okbuddydaylight
---
Imagine thinking that if somebody says something is strong that always means somebody is complaining. I have nothing against DS but if OP's suggestions would he implemented, the things I listed above should be looked at first.
---
Why didn't I trust you!? D:
---
P l u n d e r e r ' s i n s t i n c tv
---
Not to mention they have stupid things like moris and face-camping as normal play. We should have the right to DC in protest to bad behavior.
---
If not, guess we'll play a different game.
---
Honestly, as long as the DC penalty is in force without allowances for legitimate reasons to DC (face-camping, tunneling, etc.), I will not spend another dime on BHVR DLC. Enjoy the boycott bitches.
---
I love it! \*horse mask intensifies\*
---
\*ancient meme-rism as well\*
---
Appreciate that dive into the darknessüôåüôå
---
Oh yeah? Played 7 games as survivor yesterday to do the cleanse 8 totems challenge,  so I brought maps to find totems quickly and effectively. And every. fucking. killer brought franklins. In a couple of those games I was the only survivor with an item at game start, and was facecamped by a spirit in game 5.
---
Alot more fun than patroling gens while being unable to find the god damned blendette as the gen progress goes up, and up, and up till u lose. And in my experience the immersed people are the ones who leave team mates behind when easily gotten the people that took chases so thier precious lives could continue.
---
I think it‚Äôs possible. Correct me, but isn‚Äôt his mask the only liscensed part? If they work around that, he‚Äôs just an OC
---
I never expect them to give us anything worthwhile. Other than new chapters, but they‚Äôd rather pump out content than QoL changes.
---
I think yall expected a random person on the internet to always be correct in what they say sorry didnt know it is not allowed to talk from personal experiences
---
Is DBD IOS beta on USA store? I don‚Äôt seem to have it?!
---
current answer is yes.
---
they just implemented a punishment system. Pretty sure they will fine-tune it though, only time will tell :/
---
1. Coldwin 2. Haddonfield 3. Hawkins 4. Lerys  5. Badham
---
money is so funny
---
What has that got to do with anything? If you hate keys and want to counter them, always use Franklin's. Not that hard. The same way as if survivors hate doctor and want to counter him they have to run calm spirit, the same way if they want to counter spirit they have to run iron will. If you hate keys then run Franklin's but they definitely have a counter. You cannot jump through a hatch without a key so just hit them before they get to the hatch.
---
Thank you. This will help very much in the endless challenge that is the Entity's Realm. Good day to you, good killer.
---
there are so many ways to counter the gates being patrolled. 
---
- follow the killer to the one they‚Äôre patrolling and you get more time opening it.
---
- crouch nearby a gate and start opening it as they leave.
---
- work on the gate and hide when they come back. repeat.
---
on another note, it‚Äôs extremely rare to be the last survivor &amp; escape. you shouldn‚Äôt expect to at this point.
---
Them lips tho üëÄ
---
Yes! I don‚Äôt want to take credit for this just showing off my friends talent.
---
Does the same for me
---
When are the dedicated servers going live for PS4 and Xbox?
---
He's absolutely in the top tier now, even after they just nerfed his strongest add-ons with this latest patch. His kit is very versatile so it's kinda impossible for him to not be in the upper tiers now.
---
And to answer your question about what I run on him, it's BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel, and Thanatophobia along with Swing Chains and Jump Rope as my add-ons.
---
Idk. I think modern warfare 2 and halo 3 hold the toxic crown.
---
His girlfriend sucks she's a rank for the doesn't even know what the exposed status means and sucks it hitting skill checks I have a feeling that she was carried there and is only been playing the game for a little while
---
It sure is fun to have no perk synergy.
---
please no
---
Why not just edit the black to be bigger?
---
TeamBowser üëç
---
Image being able to find all the totems without a map. Small game is amazing.
---
No, that's really boring, the game is already over, why you want to get camped and slugged until ds expires just to get hooked again.
---
Crop your memes
---
Or.... me getting a nice pallet stun and getting hit through that shit. If I stun the killer I should get invulnerability so I can‚Äôt get hit through stubs anymore smh
---
I main doc. Put them tier 3 down them. And keep laughing.
---
Which Material is the Face ? Is ist Wood ?
---
hulk legion
---
No, it's me saying I've tried in the past, and this sub is hot garbage, so I unsubbed :/
---
Ready for robot chicken
---
jokes aside very great work
---
11AM EST
---
Pretty easy, kill everyone before the hatch spawns, slug for 4k if you really want. Then no key can be used. Keys are supposed to be OP, just like Mori's are they aren't supposed to happen every game. You counter a Mori by not being downed you counter a key by killing people before the hatch spawns. If the hatch has spawned find it and know where it is, if you don't want someone using a key tunnel them so that they cannot use it.
---
Maybe a perk with this function would work... maybe increasing luck slightly as well.
---
Lmao, DS wasn't nerfed at all in the first place. By looking at it I mean the situation where survivor unhooks himself and gets 60 seconds of untouchable. 
---
As for keys, they should be reworked at all or at least should not be used instantly. 4-5 seconds casttime should make them somewhat fair and countarable
---
You‚Äôve posted this multiple times, yet still haven‚Äôt explained what‚Äôs missing.

Absolutely agree. 
---
I don't care if your network sucks, either pay for a better service or get it fixed. It was the same thing when I used to play Dota (I don't anymore because players are way too toxic). People would d/c constantly and expect pauses through the whole game for them to reconnect. I don't have time to sit on pause screens for 10-15mins+ a game and it's also not my problem. 
---
I haven't hit a loading screen problem or had my network boot me in weeks.
---
You get a lot more points from that sacrifice and the merciless victory than the 250 from the hatch and maybe 2 pallets.
---
Oh I didn't know it had been buffed. Either way if you smack the survivor enough the key will disappear. Or just proxy the hatch.
---
Ok, that makes sense! Thank you for the answer to my question, and thank you for answering it civilly
---
I got timeout for not participating in a farming fest. That's a flaw right there. So am I suppose to tag along and get my 32k bloodpoints and be quiet about it? Isn't farming a 'bannable' offence?
---
My current Legion build is BBQ, Enduring, Corrupt Intervention, and Thanatophobia. Do
---
you guys think I should switch Corrupt for Discordance, or is it fine as it is?
---
So when are we getting the shirtless Claudette skin.
---
0.1? Have you even played her? Before OR after the nerf? It's massive.
---
Or just have it be the wiggle mechanic which is so much easier because it‚Äôs not as tiring as mashing buttons.
---
It's alright, honestly, the fastest matchmaking I've had for survivor, was a while ago where it would state the approximate waiting time (it was never longer than 2 minutes, even in SWF) 
---
They removed it because it was the opposite on PC and I went back to waiting 10+ minutes in SWF and solo
---
I looked at your submitted Reddit posts and the only one there is one from /r/MagicArena.
---
So you are basically saying that you have no proof that any other killer except those I listed can counter keys by doing what you suggested? Cool story bro
---
I'm having trouble getting the endgame challenges for killer and survivor
---
bEtTeR toGeThER
---
Which is easily solved by actually escaping instead of baiting a hit on the door because you find teabagging exhilarating
---
Do us all a favour and disconnect all afternoon so we can see what happens and stop your bitching.
---
And it keeps getting taken down by mods
---
Bubba wasn't on the list who I main, and I 4k with him at red ranks before hatch spawns a lot, so yes it is possible.
---
Shouldn't that be a shard of glass?
---
Is it? I though it was supposed to be last week
---
Do that and people will just go afk then. You cannot force people to play games they do not want to play.
---
Looks like the one I ordered that got delayed like 5 times awhile back
---
You HAVE TO file an in-game report and then go to the support page and report there
---
If you haven‚Äôt reported in game, no action will be taken despite evidence
---
Groovy
---
So take the hint , people are reporting it and its getting taken down, its now just spam.
---
Getting the save on yourself sparks joy.
---
4%, 4%, 4%, 4%...
---
I‚Äôm red rank killer and survivor. I usually get a killer lobby in under 5 seconds and survivor lobby after 3-5 mins. (Not exaggerating). 
---
If you can‚Äôt deal with Ruin to the point where you must DC, then your opinion on this game is simply not substantial. No offense, but it‚Äôd be like a 10 year old offering me investment advice. Also you‚Äôre just flat out wrong.

Those high waisters! üòç

The issue has gotten so bad that now I cant even get to the main menu without it turning off

Yea, I know

Same thing happened to mine and my wife's xbox one elites. One of the consoles started sounding like a jet plane taking off anytime we loaded up DbD. Could be dust build up, could be the hardware is finally showing its age. Either way DbD seems to be extremely demanding on consoles. And like you I could find little information as to the cause and or solution (new Xbox with updated hardware solved the problem). Unfortunately other than replacing/repairing I haven't found an easy solution. The game isn't optimised for consoles and its blatantly clear if you try it on a ps4 or Xbox one that is 4+ years old. I suspect it has something to do with the frame rates(uncapped in the menu and loading screens maybe?) or the way the game is rendered/generated either way my older Xbox would struggle and get warm quickly only with DbD the new console seems to handle it just fine however.
---
Hello there DS! I hope you enjoy your stay on the floor.
---
DS was nerfed. Survivors aren't untouchable as you can still down them you just can't pick them up right away
---
Immersed play is noob play. If you want to play immersed, go play Deathgarden
---
DBD is about chases, not hide and seek
---
cool so I can't DC I can't give up on hook to even let the last person get hatch so ima just go watch YT for 2 minutes fucking good idea
---
Woosh
---
But what about the real killers out there who respect the kobe?
---
Ba ha ha ha ! PC peasant.... Nah for real though it makes sense
---
Maybe you're experiencing lunges and don't realize it? The amount of distance a killer can go with a lunge is decent, and with the way hitboxes have always worked it's always been easy to know when I should get hit or not. You also may be getting hit from slow vaults, as those have your hitbox linger for just a tad bit longer. This is intended in order to reward the killer for the survivor making a mistake.
---
Basically myers taking a piss on entity
---
I used it once. If i get into a full lobby, see 4 blendettes and a key i'm not gonna be nice.
---
Right because it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre more likely to be hit going to the exit at the end as it‚Äôs the only place to go or anything. Everything is done purely to bait your fragile ego.
---
time and location + active players
---
Why would you ever DC.....
---
I don't think that survivors should be entitled to the hatch. So change it back that it spawns only if enough gens are done as well.
---
No just do the gens and leave
---
It really pissed me off when I saved deliverance until the end and am immediately killed instead of being able to use the perk üò¢
---
Well you qued to play Dbd so they obviously wanted to play...
---
No, stop bringing this up every fucking time.
---
Exactly. This would happen once every blue moon
---
I shouldn't have to be forced to stay on the hook if I can just suicide so the last person might have a chance at the hatch. Maybe remove button mashing but have a 'Let go' button prompt
---
You say keys and DS are unfair but don't see a problem with moris?
---
bc I don't want to play a game when I am getting pissed off which leads to getting more pissed off OR I don't wanna sit and wait for a killer to farm with my team while I just wanna play the normal fucking game
---
What?
---
The most unenthusiastic scream üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Fuck not again... farmfest and no actual dbd for 4 days
---
For survivor yeah. On ps4 from rank 16 to 6 its instant around 5pm-2am eastern US.
---
Still no ideas for changing DS then? Nice one. DS was definitely nerfed. Used to be able to use it at any down and the only semi reliable counterplay was juggling. Now it is situational. It‚Äôs still a great perk, I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt, but it was definitely nerfed. I don‚Äôt see how you can even argue this tbh. The counterplay to DS as it currently is, is to slug. Definitely doesn‚Äôt make you ‚Äúuntouchable‚Äù lol, if you genuinely believe that then I don‚Äôt even know what to say to you. 
---
For keys, I agree. They‚Äôre very cheap. I also would like to see them changed.
---
[why casual mode is a terrible idea (comments is old but mostly still correct)](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c41lmn/quick_match_mode/eruix8z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Also consider that there is no requirement for hatch anymore... It:s always there for the last survivor...
---
ditch it yes but add a button to allow ppl to let go. if ppl do not wanna play they should not be forced to play that is wrong and a good way to make ppl just say fuck this game. ik it sucks when it happens but you cannot force someone to stay
---
Went from 20 to 1 by only playing Pig and while I think she needs some tweaks, she's still doing fine.
---
In the end you can 4k with every killer, just need to be good enough.
---
um, many times I have made it out with the killer right on my ass and yet even though I made it out he still managed to smack me during the animation. let's not pretend this does not happen
---
I have always been pressing 2 buttons for struggling (even tho one is not doing anything) cuz it feels better (pc)
---
So what about the old system where you actually have to do something so hatch even spawns?
---
Exactly, you find a killer than suits you then you use them. If I played nurse I would have circles ran around me because I was shit at her that doesn't mean nurse is shit (this is pre nerf) just that I didn't know how to play her.
---
Am I the only one who feels like (PS4) killers cannot miss? In the last few months it really feels like even when a killer completely missed a swing, they have a second to "drag" it into you. I am by no means a red their survivor and I do play both, but it is begining to feel like unless you can disappear in a chase, it's almost guaranteed you'll be hit/downed.
---
But why? Why was he arrested, that's the question.
---
I just had a teammate dc. 3 vs 1 and the killer wanted to farm. I suicided on hook because I dont want to spend my time farming bloodpoints.
---
I run it on every killer, it's great!
---
Perhaps you also noticed that this account is brand new. I wonder if it's possible if I have another account. hmm.....
---
Fine detective work.
---
I agree it's more satisfying than a massage. Especially if you down all four survivors
---
Maybe, but sticks are too soft. He would also carry around rusted chains, if that could work.
---
I mean yeah, but doing *exclusively* gens isn't what gives you the most points/pips. The more you heal/save the other survivors, the more you distract the killer, and the more bold you are, the higher you go. The objective of the killer is to kill, but getting a 4k doesn't mean you're getting the highest score.
---
Wtf? Yes they should, if you run deliverance and don't get yourself hooked on game why the hell are you running deliverance?
---
The reason I don‚Äôt like it is because it seldom affects the game, it‚Äôs just petty and makes the survivors lose items.
---
Toolboxes only shave off like 5 to 10 seconds of gen time, 80% of the time it doesn‚Äôt make a difference, it‚Äôs still annoying to lose items though.
---
I mean... If you vers.  a huntress like this the game is over pretty fast. Why even bother to dc?
---
I think the big thing you're missing is that those Iridescent Kings and Moris *are* destroyed at the end of the game, *every* game. It's not seen as an asshole perk for killers because losing your addons/offerings every game is the norm for killers, whereas a survivor can have a purple flashlight with an odd bulb ever game indefinitely as long as they leave it at 1%. That is, unless the killer has franklin's. How is that fair, compared to some killers who NEED certain offerings to even be viable (Wraith, i'm looking at you) and yet have to grind through 10's of thousands of blood points to get the ones they need?
---
Shhh. I'm just not on my PC at the moment
---
the release is today some say 11 am eastern
---
Well at least on the game they're always across the map from each other.
---
an army of gremlins that tbag and say "ggez" after every match no matter how narrow their escape was*
---
Because it‚Äôs a backup option in case you get hooked and your teammates can‚Äôt save you... like if you‚Äôre the last survivor.
---
*sips coffee in Spine Chill*
---
Don't worry, this is the reason they had to wait for dedicated servers to hand out penalties. The server can tell crashes and DCs and hand out penalties appropriately.
---
It literally would create amazing last minute scrambles which would elevate the game and be a blast to play as a survivor and a killer, so of course they'll never do it, lol.
---
Make it so the last survivor jumps off the hook and into a hole in the ground, falling into the entity's realm and dies instantly anyway, but with that fat bonus bloodpoints.
---
that could also cause the speed glitch
---
Why even bother bringing an item then if it doesn't affect the game?
---
So you DC every time when the first survivor dies?
---
I wouldn't worry to use STBFL on huntress
---
this is outrageous, it's unfair
---
Yeah actually now that you mention it the problem is only on the startup menu so I guess the menu being uncapped must be the issue. I did have it cleaned and thermal paste replaced though extremely recently though.
---
It really only happens to me before I press X befote I go to the main menu, so I never let the game linger there. Never had it so bad that my PS4 shut off, though, and I got an older model
---
Its the wooooorst.
---
if you have a hard time with pressing a button at like 160bpm go see a doctor. Your only argument here is "I have problem with tapping balance the game for me"

deliverance?
---
Bond is the best survivor perk imo
---
I've left the game running, left the room, made a snack, ate the snack, and came back and I'm still glitched. I hope it doesn't happen again!
---
then chances are it is just the main menu it seems this game has issues with only some consoles. like I got the game pretty much close to when it first came out and it has never turned my ps4 off but has with others
---
How would someone be on first hook if you are getting a 4K
---
Yes, because people will always DC, so its better to actually try to fix some of the issues, not every single one, just the ones that can be fixed, like the op addons or those "bullshit valid strategy"
---
I just tried to play today and the fans kick in for about half a second then the console just shuts off
---
Yep! That's the one
---
I think it‚Äôs a bad idea because if you‚Äôre the last survivor, the killer is just gonna wait for you to hit struggle and die. Why would the killer leave you there if you‚Äôre the last man on hook? 
---
Even if you get off, you get slugged afterwards for any potential DS shenanigans or just mori‚Äôd if it‚Äôs in play. 
---
Ultimately, it just drags out the end of the game.
---
cause you killed all the others first..? that‚Äôs not tunneling. usually if they haven‚Äôt been hooked yet they‚Äôre a stealthy ass survivor that you haven‚Äôt seen all match. obsession perks exist btw.
---
Switch it to mw wheel down
---
It only ever seems to happen with Feng Min and when hooked in a basement. I've even had people unhook me, but I'm blind I tell you, BLIND! 
---
Hopefully its fixed :)
---
is it really though
---
All my dbd shit is on console mate lol.
---
Ummmmm. If it is the last survivor..... Why wouldn't the killer stand next to the hook again? What is the killer going to go and do? Patrol gens for the 0 survivors that are left? Haha
---
Yes I am referring to Jane being curvy, just like I would say anyone with distinct features of another character. You‚Äôre the perv to put it in that context
---
Just perfection
---
I feel like if you stop and think you can figure this one out on ur own
---
Dead by Daylight is a team game.
---
Using Deliverance to secure the killer's attention on hooking you and subvert the need for your teammates to take time away from objectives to rescue you is valueable to yourself and your team's chance of survival.
---
Using Deliverance to unhook yourself when you're the last person alive and the killer has nothing better to do but hang around you or look for hatch isn't valuable whatsoever to you or your team's survival.
---
So, by bringing Deliverance and failing to use it while your team is alive, not only do you contribute nothing to your team's chance of survival, you contribute next to nothing to your own chance of survival. Might as well run Self Care, at least that might help you.
---
What about on other maps? If it's only one map, people will get tired of that same map.
---
Put We Will Make It, you can do it farely easy
---
You're playing a game and you're finger still gets tired? You don't slam it down as fast possible just like shaking off the killer doesn't go faster the faster you go it's all on a steady pace
---
Ok Zoomer
---
This also applies to the Pig.
---
Maybe there's dust blocking the ventilation? Because that sounds pretty extreme
---
NO MERCY
---
Bruh this is really good
---
No I don‚Äôt slam it down as fast as possible just repeating my pressing the button down gets tiring for me and it‚Äôs not like during the first few matches it‚Äôs more afterwards it really starts to kick in. Like on my 5th or 6th match. Some days it doesn‚Äôt really affect me. 
---
But my finger gets slow and then I just slow down just a little bit and then I die so instead of going aaaaa it‚Äôs more like a with a .5 second pause.
---
Which god?
---
Rewarding the survivors for being hit with a speed boost to the next badly designed loop is not balanced or well designed.
---
No dust actually as 8 had it cleaned very recently
---
I only use Franklin's when the entire fucking group of survivors decide to use items, multiple toolboxes, flashlights or a key.
---
The problem is, the cost of these rare high-tention moments against a benevolent or not-so-smart killer is every other game turning into a needlessly long slog of:  
---
1. stand around and wait for kobe.  
---
2. Did they Kobe?  
---
 - No: Goto 1.  
---
 - Yes: Down them and wait 60 seconds.
---
It's slow, boring, lazy gameplay when everyone involved would likely rather be getting into their next game.
---
I would still take it. Give me blood points for unhooking myself. I'm gonna die anyways, might as well get a bit extra for it.
---
data is skewed....still comparing more information received from other killers to a fraction on Bubbas which happened to be favorable...not necessarily accurate.
---
It's also in a well ventilated area?
---
Indeed it is.
---
Don‚Äôt use it on huntress
---
It would‚Äôve been much better if they were snapping their fingers while still holding onto their guts.
---
Just in case the hatch wasn‚Äôt enough.
---
wrong...you can sit there and miss 3 great skill checks in a row when the gen is almost done and take longer from regression vs just gen tapping
---
Lobby dodging it is, then! Thanks, OP!
---
They barely give you survivor challenges if you main killer.  They just give you challenges for killers you don't play.
---
Crazy how you complain about SO MANY things about survivors. We know which side has mories though.
---
Says the person who used the licking emoji while saying oh it's jane alright...
---
What other meaning is there?
---
Seems fine as is. You could replace enduring for discordance too.
---
oh ghost face, you caught me gen tapping, hmmm, what if I let you tap something else? Hehe ;)
---
Ok I really need to get back on focusing on my job interview in 28 minutes instead of doing this.
---
immersed play actually requires a pretty fair amount of skill. if you‚Äôre good at it, you need to practice map awareness, jukes to escape a chase, good teamwork, how to actually stay hidden etc. dead by daylight was never meant to be looping simulator. you‚Äôre stuck in that mindset where immersed players do nothing but in reality they‚Äôre probably the ones allowing you to escape each trial. every team needs someone who stays hidden &amp; does generators whether you like it or not.
---
The last survivor already has a free hatch, you dont need more. Bring left behind if surviving against all odds is your style.
---
No, you don't get it. Pandamomium wants to play victim. You're getting in their way!
---
Let Miss Piggy rest. It takes a lot of energy to build up the courage to fuck an anthropomorphic frog.
---
Is this smashen? The Kate main?
---
stealthy is when a killer expects a surv to be there and cant find them. Alot of higher tier killers do split pressure, hook then patrol nearby gens. If he goes to a noisy gen and cant find you he'll either waste time trying or go back to his previous pressure. If that pressure disappears then killer's momentum is gone and hes back to square one, not knowing where to go.   
---
Being stealthy doesnt mean you go to the useless corner. You just pay attention like hide on heartbeat if no one is being chased, lockertech BBQ, pay attention to scratchmarks. You'll still be found on gens every now and then. Ive seen a lot of chads run around, no matter how good a looper you are (most arent) the location info you give is still a killer advantage
---
They build up tho
---
This still comes with a pointless slowdown of the endgame. Say a killer feels they actually deserved their 4k, and want to keep it. They have to wait on hook for 15 seconds. If the survivor kobes, they just hit them and wait another 60 seconds.
---
The reason the last survivor auto-dies is because there's really no combination of perks that give them a fighting chance on a kobe, save for the weird mettle-of-man, decisive strike, unbreakable combo.
---
I know. That's what I mean. I hate the 4K, 1K style of writing so I typed it out fully
---
yea makes sense, thanks
---
That has always been a tongues out emoji. Not a licking emoji. Stop projecting
---
&gt;the time it's most useful
---
If this is how you intend to use deliverance, I feel so bad for your team.

Huh. I'm baffled.. it very clearly is a fault of the game, since it sounds like it's taking off as soon as you get to the 'press X to continue' screen, but I wouldn't know what you could do to prevent your console from shutting off :( I wish I could have been more helpful. 
---
BHVR clearly needs to change something to the startup of the game to prevent it from overheating, because my console stops that sound the moment I get to the main menu
---
yeah you can just get lucky or bring key, toolbox or take advantage of situations like farm and camp, since OP doesnt want the "git gud" talk alternative
---
Console is harder doh ;-;
---
This would just be annoying. It adds unnecessary time to the end of the match, it's pointless since the killer will just camp, and if there's an obsession it'll add another minute of slugging.
---
Can you show a little enthusiasm? You only see DS so often...
---
The survivor queue time already feels like a DC penalty.
---
But if they're simply across the map then 95 percent of killers have no chance and survivors get out with no skill
---
I see you are a killer main
---
Why is there a consensus that Iron Will is better than Self Care? I can see how being out of the game for so long during a self-heal could set you back, but is it really worth sacrificing the flexibility that a pocket medkit gives you?
---
Personal experience doesn‚Äôt make something fact. Don‚Äôt be so stern on giving out misinformation
---
Adrenaline would, but I still feel like it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense. It would just needlessly delay the inevitable in 90% of the cases were it actually works.
---
Have you seen the cosmetic prices?
---
Ok sorry I was just saying in my experience dang
---
‚ÄúI find your lack of DS disturbing, Nancy.‚Äù
---
The only reason I'm sure it's a fault with the game and not the console is because every other game I've tried work more than fine on the console. Also even after the console shuts off I lay my hand on it and it's only slightly warm to the touch so I don't even know if it's an overheating issue now actually
---
I love the map concept.
---
Nothing like watching a movie and getting to play it.. Love it &lt;3
---
This is utterly untrue, but okay
---
You were told from three different t people you‚Äôre wrong and you still kept giving the wrong info
---
I‚Äôm scared
---
Fortnite is the reason I don't want proximity chat in this game.
---
&gt; Not having fun playing anymore
---
Because you don't win every game? Survivor entitlement
---
DbD is a team game but each player‚Äôs ultimate goal is their own survival. Team work makes it easier to reach the goal but in the end your own survival is what matters. 
---
People don‚Äôt bring Deliverance to waste killer‚Äôs time. Sure, that‚Äôs a bonus, but the main point is to use it as a backup option if teammates can‚Äôt save you. 
---
It‚Äôs like saying the main point of Unbreakable or DS is to waste a killer‚Äôs time. They‚Äôre primarily used as back up perks to increase your own independence. They‚Äôre not specifically designed as stalling perks nor should be used as such. 
---
In a lot of games, you never get the chance to use DS or unbreakable. So why do people bring them anyways?
---
If my teammates are dead I can still escape. Why should my teammates dying mean I have to die?
---
wtf did this guy want from you? You didnt do anything to him
---
*own*
---
Quentin needs a paper bag option for the head slot.
---
I should've worded it differently. Their are bannable actions but they literally never actually ban players anymore. I'm sure if you modded your game you could but I'm referring to normal actions in game.
---
How does your crippling loneliness hold the controller??
---
well it just depends on what you consider immersed i suppose. there‚Äôs definitely a gradient of players from potato to flashlight clicker. to me, immersion is fun and allows you to help your team in subtle ways. also feels pretty cool to try thinking ahead of the killer in order to outplay them.
---
Or if they still have deliverance active and haven‚Äôt used it
---
&gt;Gen rushing exists, but it‚Äôs intentionally letting your teammates die on hook to finish gens.
---
Sometimes that's the only legit counterplay to killers that stay near the hook.
---
Also, if multiple people go for a save it's usually a waste of team resources.
---
As a somewhat skilled Billy you my sir understand that it‚Äôs not just ‚ÄúcUrVe HaRdEr‚Äù sometimes
---
That is a dick move lmaooo
---
yes if you hadn‚Äôt been hooked previously.
---
But the katana is deadly and you can take unlimited amount of stabs from the knife
---
I heavily doubt that it is enjoyable for both the Killers and Survivors who have such short games in Red Ranks, good games are ones that are longer, have a bunch of chases and where you only *just escape*, but given how quick gens are, this is not the case.
---
Low ranks are just that - low ranks, so of course they're not good loopers, good at doing gens etc, it's a hierarchy and it's exactly how it should be, if you're a low rank that is because of you, not your team. You can die and still pip, nothing really to do with fame design, that's just you being a shitter.
---
If you have a certain standard to hold yourself up to (So the standard of what you should do in-game) and you don't/can't do it, then that's a you problem not a game problem. A simple example of that is totems, it's been literally 6+ months since I have been hit be NoeD at the end of the game, in fact, I've never been hit by it in Red Ranks due to a combination of Survivors actually doing totems and Killers actually being good so they don't use it as a "Get out of Jail Free Card". Last time I was hit by it was mid-purple ranks because these Killers and Survivors are both bad.
---
At the end of the day, adding more to do will extend the game and make it into an actual game, the people will need to adapt, simple.
---
Rogue vs Fighter.
---
100% agree
---
But what was i supossed to do?
---
Killer was right there
---
I'd rather they bring that than dodge the lobby. If I have something I want to keep I'll go back to collect it after being hit then stash it near an exit gate out of sight of the other survivors
---
Removal of button mashing would make me so happy. I would probably play a lot more survivor.
---
If you're not getting into chase's you're just ensuring that somebody on your team is gonna die early. You should never die on first hook unless you are getting camped.
---
I am also a creative player that likes building developed characters and finding out how to best employ their skills, because I like the immersion of the universe and the challenge of playing different character archetypes. I definitely agree that at a high level of play the game can lose its horror tone and become a game of mere geometry.
---
My favorite survivor games are the ones where I am playing a more strictly defined character (a healer Adam, an athletic Meg) because it really relies on me to figure out my niche in the team and play to my strengths. There have been a few good high level games where the role-playing truly comes out and the four of us suss out our roles (e.g. once playing a We'll Make It Dwight and ambulancing a team vs. a hex defending Trapper)
---
Anyway I agree with you, just wanted to say that creative, dramatic character-oriented play is so fun and always worth trying at high levels. Even it does mean keeping up a hustle and managing the time and still playing to the geometry of chases....
---
Your computer takes 3 minutes to reboot?
---
Is it from 2003?
---
I get wanting to use your deliverance, but if she saved you, you wouldnt be broken and youd been better off. Still theres a chance I wouldve done the same js. That deliverance is so satisfying
---
Well at least the game will be over soon
---
I think he just meant because the memetage effects are very similar.
---
Never mentioned anything about how many they have but OK whatever you say pal
---
They don't even need to ditch it. If it's not being used to read auras, you should be dead before you get hit 10 separate times.
---
Maybe provide more context for a start, in a safer situation it is 100% a scummy move to deny save points and make someone waste their time.
---
If it‚Äôs a situation with the killer involved that works out great, it confuses the heck outta the killer.
---
Exactly
---
There is a huge, huge, huge difference between ‚Äúusing deliverance when 2 survivors are alive and the killer‚Äôs attention is diverted‚Äù and ‚Äúusing deliverance when you are the only survivor alive and the killer‚Äôs attention is only on you.‚Äù
---
i don‚Äôt use bbq but i‚Äôm personally not the type to seek out individual survivors. i‚Äôd rather just go for whoever i see.
---
Don‚Äôt run Iron Maiden. Waste of a perk slot. Might synergize, but it saves like up to 10 seconds during the match and it saves them from your free time
---
Well seems to me that if only a third of the killers are licensed then it's not much of a hard-on now, is it?
---
I remember i had a teammate that had deliverance and it was his first hook we got to endgame and this hag camped the other random so my teammate got himself downed to get the random out and the hag pushed us out so he was the last survivor left and thought he could escape with deliverence
---
Ahh yeah I get that. Just wanted to distance myself from the toxic nature of those clips
---
As u/ps4_and_ipad_lover said above, it's probably the issue with the startup menu being uncapped. I can't believe after so many complaints about the sound of PS4s everywhere, BHVR still haven't fixed it.
---
This is fine
---
You can pick the key back up and lol killers should use 25% of their perks to counter items seems balanced
---
Oh I see. Nvm then lol
---
Again completely irrelevant
---
Im fine with it.. what annoys me is when my random teammates pick it up lol
---
I think a point bonus equivalent to the Struggle points they're not getting would be better.  More consistently useful.
---
Spine Chill, Wake Up, Quick &amp; Quiet, Fixated. They won't find shit
---
At least killers have some counter. Where's survivors anti Mori perk?
---
Those stats are literal junk. bhvr even tells you this.
---
They didn't' use standardized games. They didn't control for any variables.
---
It's so irresponsible for them to put stuff like that out because they know how the playerbase is
---
ive actually had this happen a few times playing as freddy
---
I‚ÄôM NOT READY TO GET MY CHEEKS CLAPPED BY TOME 4!!!
---
Get your blood points. This is fine.
---
Lol I got it yesterday without deliverance...
---
GOSH DAMN HIT BOXES. VAULTING A WINDOW, STARTING TO RUN, THEN GETTING HIT/DOWN?? ABSOULTELY BULLSHIT.
---
Yes that's just what killers are looking for, more chances to get cucked out of hooks they earned
---
WOW, thats dope! Can i have one? :D
---
Well done!
---
Balls to the wall opinion. Remove cypress mori and make it standard
---
Why would you pay someone to be terrible and toxic at your game and mislead their fans into thinking that basic perks and mechanics are cheating/hacking?
---
i was counting every item in 100 of my killer games to see what's the most used items for survivors ingame and made a statistic to it.
---
Good bot
---
He was absolutely toxic when he played, getting his team killed repeatedly, blocking people in pallets, blaming them for stuff. Not the kind of people I want to play the game. The game is already pretty toxic.
---
Rank? Platform?
---
&gt;If my teammates are dead I can still escape.
---
Please, if you can, describe a single scenario in which a not-braindead killer puts you, the last survivor, on the hook, and you can ‚Äústill escape‚Äù. 
---
Enphasis on ‚Äúnot braindead‚Äù.
---
&gt; the biggest one being the terrible desync,
---
If you play on PC, killer desync cannot affect you. If you play on console, it could be you or your friend's internet. Just because the killer is the host doesn't mean the strength of your connection doesn't matter
---
&gt; that on top of already being faster than you, makes it very unlikely you can ever juke him.
---
You juke the killer by using structures. They have to kick pallets. They go slowly through windows. These functions counter the killer's higher speed. And if they didn't have a higher speed, survivor could literally just run in a straight line and win
---
&gt; I think the queue times speak for themselves.
---
They sure do. My killer queues are instant and my survivor queues take 6 minutes
---
Well I guess I see your point seeing as if they could just bring every movie killer into the game if it was up to them, they probably would but that doesn't take away from the original content either. So I don't see licensed content as bad in any way.
---
Still better than DCing
---
All info I have is ‚Äúpeople keep asking and get no response‚Äù
---
Hope this helps
---
I'm in this post and I don't like it
---
Oh right they could close hatch. I always forget about that still.
---
I'M A RED RANKS PLAYER WHO PLAYS SOLO 90% OF THE TIME AND I STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED THE FLASHLIGHT SAVE CHALLENGE.

FIRST OFF, KILLERS AT MY RANK BASICALLY ARE NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO PICK PLAYERS UP UNTIL THEY'VE CHECKED THEIR IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY. MOST OF THEM HAVE EARS AND CAN HEAR YOUR BREATHING OR FOOTSTEP SOUNDS. SECOND, THEY KNOW TO LOOK AT WALLS WHEN THEY DO PICK PEOPLE UP. THIRD, I'M THROWING THE GAME BY TRYING TO GET IN POSITION FOR FLASHLIGHT SAVES INSTEAD OF PROGRESSING OBJECTIVES, AND PEOPLE IN SOLO QUEUE HERE ALREADY DON'T DO GENS SO THIS STUPID CHALLENGE WOULD SCREW ME EVEN MORE. FOURTH, DEDICATED SERVERS MAKE THE TIMING EVEN WORSE.
---
KIND OF WISH THEY'D CHANGE THE CHALLENGE TO INCLUDE HEAD ON AND PALLET SAVES SINCE THOSE ARE USUALLY EASIER TO PULL OFF.
---
Red ranks/ PC
---
Just bring empathy, we'll make it and borrowed time. Make sure you get the hook saves and heal them right at the hook. Its actually really easy
---
Eat my butt
---
&gt; Use your brain instead of trying to be a elitist pos
---
Holy fuck, chill out. How did I say anything rude to them at all? This is why when I am rude I do it on purpose, because people flip out even if you're not
---
Anyway, hatch closing still slips my mind and I never leave the hook until they hit second stage anyway so it didn't enter my mind
---
I'm glad i just frenzy people that get unhooked in front of me.
---
But isn‚Äôt Mori a secret offering?
---
I ran small game for 6 months straight when Ash first came out, just so I could get used to totem spawns on all maps. Now I don't need it. It's worth doing.
---
It‚Äôs alright bud your joke was funny to me. You can‚Äôt rationalize with these white knights lol
---
BHVR PLEASE HAVE SOMETHING DONE ABOUT DBD SWITCH. THE BUGS ARE LITERALLY GAME-BREAKING. I DON'T MIND THE SHITTY FPS BUT I DO MIND MY AUDIO AS KILLER CUTTING OUT MID-GAME AND GETTING STUCK IN GENERATORS.
---
I mean it‚Äôs most useful during endgame were everything is messy.
---
STOP DISCONNECTING ON FIRST DOWN, OR BECAUSE YOU GOT YOINKED, OR BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE KILLER
---
LOL! I'm sure of it!
---
There has not been an anoucement about cross progression but they did ask people's opinion on the last survey they did. So they probably plan to get to it at one point but are focusing on other things first.
---
Yeah unfortunately as much as I agree, the killer would just wait by the last hook 100% of the time, and just down you and hook you again
---
If they did... Killer would just stand by the hook, and bitch slap him if he got unhooked.
---
Kind of a waste of time when they are the last survivor.
---
You're free to Deliverance right in front of my after I hauled ass over to you. 
---
But good luck on your second hook.
---
IT REALLY ISN'T THAT HARD
---
And yet the civil one gets the downvotes.
---
That was the most satisfying this I've seen in a while. I'm proud of you.
---
Some context. The Claudette was getting chases by Oni and ran to try and save, She pallet stuns right next to me and i decide to Yeet.
---
&gt;simply juking a killer
---
Self-unhooking puts you through a nearly two-second animation and lands you in a predictable spot, completely stationary, and with zero acceleration. If you‚Äôre playing in yellow ranks, you might manage to find a killer who would miss that hit or swing at you midair.
---
I personally believe survivors should hit the ground running on any unhook, with a one-second window of Endurance as a slight prevention to hook farming, tunneling, bubba‚Äôs basementing, etc. But in its current state, self-unhooking in front of the killer is a completely suicidal action if they haven‚Äôt gone AFK.
---
SO MANY CONSOLE HITS FOR ME. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, HITS HAVE BEEN MAGICALLY MISSING FOR KILLER AND AUTOAIM HAS BEEN ON ONE. DO YOU PLAY CONSOLE? I FEEL LIKE IT'S ROTTING RIGHT NOW
---
Do people not realise that the struggle mechanic damages keyboards?
---
YOU JUST SUCK AT SKILL CHECKS
---
It's nice they added that bug to the switch version so you guys didn't feel left out (:
---
Nothing is messy when you‚Äôre last alive. The endgame is fast-paced, but being alone and on the hook doesn‚Äôt carry that same weight at all. There is no killer objective besides you, and you are on a hook.
---
here are some counterpoints to your counterpoints
---
1. your point #3 actually refutes point #1.  mashing a button is so easy and mindless that removing it as a mechanic doesn't change the difficulty of the overall game by any meaningful amount.
---
2. suiciding on hook to give last survivor hatch is not skillful or some kind of 200 iq play, any trash survivor can do it.  struggle phase is only 60 seconds, so if you can't evade a killer for 60 seconds then can you really claim to be not trash?  imo removing option to suicide actually increases difficulty of the game in a skillful and meaningful way
---
3. you right.
---
The scenario for this just doesnt happen ever. He would have to be on the killer‚Äôs shoulder, then the last gen pops, the other survivors run to the gate, open it and escape. All that in the time you‚Äôre still on the shoulder.
---
It's just a good perk. I've swapped it out for Kindred, though
---
They mentioned the sphere activating earlier, so it'd be hard to drop after that.
---
No? Theres been so many games I have been in a chase with a killer for a few gens, did gens, unhooked a few people and still haven't been hooked during endgame. If thats the case I 100% deserve to escape, not die because of some clutch killer perk.
---
Obvious answer: DS. DS with a key is a hatch escape. If your teammates have already opened or 99‚Äôd a gate, you can easily escape. Even if the killer tries to slug, if you‚Äôre hooked near an open exit (pretty common), you can reliably crawl out within 60 seconds. If the killer tries to hook you further, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll wiggle free. 
---
You can DH to avoid a hit. Even sprint burst will give you quick distance. It‚Äôs pretty common to see clips on this sub of people escaping using DS/DH or even SB after a kobe/deliverance when their teammates have left or died.
---
I CAN'T SEEM TO RELAX WHEN PLAYING KILLER! I JUST WANT TO RELAX AND ENJOY PLAYING FREDDY, BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE I'M EITHER TOO FOCUSED ON GETTING THE 4K OR ARE WORRIED ABOUT GENS GOING TOO FAST DESPITE MY BUILD. HOW DO I BREAK THIS HABIT???
---
Somewhat agreeing with you
---
You clearly don't get delivarence.
---
1. it is so mindless lets just remove all the things that require little to no skill not like BHVR does this daily
---
2. tell me how many ppl in rank 15 are gonna give u hatch when they are struggling on hook
---
It is tbh
---
DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO
---
Read better. I said upon hooking/downing another survivor. At that point, "you're not getting tunneled" so it should deactivate. The fact that it still works even though you're not getting tunneled is the issue here. It's working even outisde of it's intended fuction, which is obvious because EVERYONE uses it like that. 
---
It allows for really aggressive plays from survivors since they can't get hooked because of DS even though the killer is not tunneling.
---
jesus fucking christ
---
Err that's how most people use reddit, man.
---
THIS FORUM IS TRULY FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH ENTITLED BABY SURVIVORS
---
A killer who would quickly pick up a recently-downed last survivor is braindead or throwing. A key doesn‚Äôt do anything for you there.
---
In a small set of circumstances, it‚Äôs true, Dead Hard and Sprint Burst can get you distance on a killer who fails to react with a level head or times a hit poorly. This is mostly reliant on poor killer play, and isn‚Äôt really at all dependent on good strategy or timing from the survivor.
---
But yes, you have found one situation a survivor can assuredly escape. Unhooking yourself with decisive strike active within 60-seconds‚Äô crawling distance of a previously opened exit gate will ensure your escape. I stand by my point that this small niche of circumstances isn‚Äôt worth the hassle of an often-needlessly-extended final hook, but you have managed to encompass a small subset of situations in which it would be useful. I can appreciate that.
---
I do this and it does make it more fun but im just curious as to how long it took to make this post?
---
If the person who came for you had bt or we'll make it then using it was a real dick move
---
Have you uninstalled and reinstalled? I did for my wife and had better luck getting thru the start menu. Just about every patch forces us to reinstall the game.
---
I get deliv**e**r**a**nce just fine. What i don‚Äôt get is why people seem to think it‚Äôs useful in a one-on-one situation in any capacity.
---
why use unbreakable &amp; no mither together?
---
A survivor could literally be injured, unhook you and then 5s later gets downed while the killer comes back to you.
---
No thanks, I'll take my DS as it is.
---
interesting words coming from w mouth of a uneducated redneck
---
Oh my god please do this. Imagine the power move of them being like "One of a kind!! So special!! ‚Äú and then youre just here like" hi"
---
Huntress is fun\~
---
I have no idea, I've been ignoring it for years!
---
Because most of them are weebs with neckbeards, fedoras, katanas, and have sex with body pillows that have pictures of underaged Japanese school girls on them. And those guys tend to be extremely racist because when you're already total scum you might as well be racist scum.
---
So if it's my first DC in a while then it's better than waiting out being slugged. I don't DC often so it's worth it for me to DC when slugged for the 4k.
---
&gt;Bring unbreakable if being slugged is that frustrating
---
First of all I find Unbreakable to be a very unfair perk and I don't run the stuff I find unfun to play against myself.
---
Second of all if I'm getting slugged for the 4k the game is over anyway, and me getting up won't do anything. I'd rather move on to the next game.
---
&gt;Hell I make a game out of being slugged.
---
That's good for you. I prefer to play the game.
---
it's so true
---
Right. And the sum chance of escape is... 11.6%. Test it yourself if you don‚Äôt believe me.
---
source?
---
If this change went through, why would they ever do that?
---
as if its not an hatch game already with the disgusting amounts of keys around lol, can't believe they are still in the game
---
what is up with PC red rank fengs? console red rank fengs are usually really sweet
---
Callback to Demise of Faithful ptb, where every survivor was Jane running headon, and every locker I went near was a 50/50 chance of a thicc Brazilian woman come booling out and give me a fucking mini heart attack.
---
Was about to 4K a few days ago and the guy DCed and messaged me saying ‚ÄúNot letting you get the satisfaction asshole.‚Äù
---
Correct, the best part is you don't have to mindgame a tier one meyers or anything like that.  Just force him to eat a pallet and run the spoopy boy to a window, or a two story vault and just run run run.  
---
Even if you suspect it's a tier 1 meyers on one of the stronger maps, it's still not too hard to run him as long as you're paying attention and extra reactive.
---
I had a wraith who had legit never seen anyone kobe off the hook. I was the last man on hook and everyone else was a couple seconds from dying. Dude just sat there waiting for me to die and I yeeted myself off- he let me go and it post-game chat he was like "I have only seen that work on YouTube. Holy fuck I didn't know that was even real."
---
Or the clown hitting anyone
---
The only time it's not toxic is when you're doing it in sweet revenge.
---
No, I just despise small game just as much as I despise self-care
---
Oh ok. But there is a chance the survivor does have deliveranceü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è... you definitely did change my mind. You are right.
---
As a killer main i have to say that was fucking savage.....noice
---
The survivor could have dead hard or the killer could make a mistake, though.
---
If the killer wants the 4k, they can hit the survivor after they kobe.
---
self unhook in front of my salad!
---
No, it's a greeting.
---
Fuck sake dude, you made me laugh ugly. Have your upvote you beautiful memer.
---
either you're a god tier looper or your hiding is causing your friends to die quicker since you're not making use of your hooks. If the latter, you're terrible to play with.

Who said he was the survivor?

even if it was a 1% chance and they only get to attempt 1 time it would be better than getting instakilled. this game is going down the shitter and it's devs are the reason
---
This is what it boils down to. Way easier to buy Leatherface than to just sit and wait for bbq. I waited almost a year for it though lol.
---
I'm not too hopeful, but hopefully this cuts down on DCs. Was playing two nights ago as Doctor (using only his 3 perks for the achievement). Over 3 matches, 7 people DC. The first match, two people DC as I downed them, no hooks. Second match, first person I downed DC, then the other 2 slowly DC over the course of 3 minutes, I didn't even find them. Third match, 1 person DC as soon as they saw me, and another DC after I downed him before he fixed the last gen.
---
Fun times.
---
Yeah it because of the delay for dedicated servers, so sometimes it‚Äôs really reliable others well...
---
Like 10-20 mins for killer, but think it's because I am new on switch and level 20! Might be lower when I hit yellow ranks.
---
There's the possible situation where you can crawl to the gates within 60 seconds.

STRUGGLING TO GET THE ADEPT KILLER TROPHIES ON CONSOLE BECAUSE OF ALL THE LITTLE TRY HARDS THAT HAVE ALL PURPLE PERKS GEN RUSHING IN GREEN RANKS
---
MAN JUST WANTS HIS PLATINUM
---
Right because every game improving suggestion is obviously a result of salt?
---
Yeah it counts towards the challenge. I dont ever really use flashlights so it was the easiest way for me to get it.
---
If you couldn't drop the last hook and re-hook em, then, maybe try a new game? I don't think there'd be many people getting off and then making it out when they're last, lol.
---
I can't believe they haven't changed it back yet. I think it's worth waiting an extra minute even from a killer standpoint
---
I agree struggle should be replaced with just holding down space or be automatic but you hold space to die. I get "it's supposed to be a struggle" but after so many hours it is honestly a chore. I don't want to use macros. Maybe give a thing in the option menu to turn it off.
---
Facts
---
When it's clearly a nerf for the other party and nothing more then yes, more often than not.
---
Self Care + Botany Knowledge = 33% faster healing for not just you but your entire team, from all sources you have including Medkits and Syringes. 24 second Self Care time without a Medkit, between 12 and 8 seconds with a Medkit.
---
Inner Strength = indeterminate amount of time running around looking for a totem, 14 seconds to cleanse the totem, 18 if the Killer has TotH, and could possibly be HG. 2 seconds to get in the locker, 10 seconds to heal, 2 to get back out. minimum time used: 28 seconds.
---
I'll stick with my Self Care + Botany combo for solo play thank you.
---
I have to disagree.. As a survivor I feel like you deserve those chances. You went the entire game without getting hooked and you don't even deserve to *try* a 4% success rate? 
---
I've been in those shoes and it kind of feels like your being cheated. Who cares if you don't have much of a chance? It's a 4% chance unhook you already don't have much of a chance but to not get one at all? Don't even get me started on if you brought a luck offering and don't even get to try.
---
1. ok?  i don't see a counterpoint here.  i personally wouldn't classify many DBD mechanics as mindless or no-skill, at least not to the ridiculous level of struggle which you can literally do with no sound, your monitor off, using only your big toe.
---
2. unless you're in a SWF group why would sacrificing yourself to give someone else hatch be a "smart" play? the game doesn't reward you in any way for doing this.  actually it hurts your score.  struggling for as long as possible increases your score and awards more bloodpoints, which a rank 15 might be more into than giving someone hatch for the sake of being purely altruistic.  but regardless of all that, i still stand by my point that removing struggle would increase the difficulty of the game for the remaining survivor in a way in which they'd need actual skill to overcome.  arguing about what might or might not go through the minds of rank 15 players doesn't really address any of that.
---
Maybe reduce there effectiveness if they need to be nerfed but even just 5% slower is insane for survivors (that‚Äôs just perma bloodlust but worst) but I‚Äôm not sure they require balancing. At least a i know most of them don‚Äôt  maybe the green one if a entire team uses them
---
Its better then getting ebony moried without being hooked all at least
---
noed, noed, noed i love that
---
The game is over now because they changed it.
---
When you had a chance, the game wasn't over.
---
Killers make mistakes. It was possible to escape in this situation before, and the devs made it impossible now.
---
But why? Because it's fair. It's also logical for new survivors. The change was a weird arbitrary change to give a gift to killers that isn't consistent with the previously established rules of the game.
---
5? Only 4 survivors in a match correct?
---
The same could be applied the other way, though.
---
As a killer, I can two-hook everyone down to death hook by the time endgame nears, not tunnel/facecamp/etc and play fair, so I 100% deserve at least two kills to get my safety pip, not lose all my chances because of some clutch survivor perk that leaves me powerless to pick them up because DS, or make them neigh uncatchable because of BT/DS/Sprint burst/Adrenaline with an open gate.
---
Yeah because that makes sense. Why should you be punished for not getting hooked? Idk sounds like a killer cushion to me.
---
 You know you can hook survivors more than once right?
---
Gotta rehook someone.
---
OMG I read that wrong! I‚Äôm embarrassed now
---
It means get 5 basement hooks in a single match.
---
Doesn't mean 5 unique survivors
---
*I need to know if he booped it*
---
Deliverance, MoM, DS, Dead Hard
---
EZ
---
Then run detective's hunch.
---
It's just 5 hooks.  Just throw on Iron Grasp and Agitation and you'll make it there every time.  Trapper lends himself to this challenge because the traps can snowball additional no effort hooks for the basement just trap the loops near it. This is one of the easier ones I've seen.
---
If I see 4 medkits, 3 toolboxes, 2 flashlights or 1 key you bet I‚Äôm bringing Franklin‚Äôs.
---
I run Borrowed Time / Deliverance / Dead Hard &amp; Decisive Strike lately.
---
If I had Deliverance ready, it's not that unreasonable to unhook - decisive strike the killer and create some distance especially with dead hard.
---
Lmao i dont understand how he doesnt know this. I turn away so it can ping another one right away when im near it. No reason to stare at a totem
---
Exactly! I think every killer can be top tier if you're good enough with said killer.
---
You're literally stealing bloodpoints and emblem points from someone who was seconds away from saving you. Of course it's a dick move. They wasted all that time to come over and get you just for you to fuck them over. Like I get if you have deliverance, it's a good perk. So fucking use it for what it's designed for. Don't wait until the survivor is right next to you, because at that point you might as well not have that perk.
---
If someone does that to me they can go ahead and struggle to death the next tome they get hooked.
---
also excessive teabagging should result in a 4 second "freeze"
---
The doc one you're thinking of is Distressing.
---
Please read context :)
---
If you've two hooked everyone chances are you aren't going to bee encountering DS much late game. If you hate BT then take make your choice/focus the unhooker. Adrenaline is a fair perk because it means the survivors have done all 5 gens for a one time use perk, which they should be rewarded for.
---
WHEN THE FUCK IS THE AUDIO CUTTING OUT MID GAME ON SWITCH GOING TO BE FIXED? IT'S TOTAL BS WHEN I'M TRYING TO PLAY KILLER AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN MY CHARACTER GOES DEAF. [AHHHHHHHHHHHH](/intensifies)
---
Once they get to the struggle stage they will have the auto-die. I just think it's unfair that everyone else was able to get their chance to try to Kobe but the last person who was able to be stealthy all game or had the skills to out maneuver the killer has to pay the price by not even getting a chance to escape
---
Just because you have a very low chance of success doesn't mean you shouldn't get a chance.
---
Ooo ok
---
Hey man, I'm just saying that make-up doesn't improve someone's beauty. It just hides it. You can see it however you want, but if people interpret my advice as a creepy thing then go right ahead. You ain't open-minded.
---
What would you want me to say? I appreciate beauty, and you should do the same. You raggedy-ass virgins.
---
Appreciating beauty isn't perverted, it's in human nature. It's not my fault that other thirsty fuckers leave creepy comments about body parts.
---
Thanks , one of my main problems as killer is keeping pressure so will be using discordance :)
---
Plus toolboxes aren't even op or anything. If anything nerf how often BNP comes up in the bloodweb, but even then that's unnecessary.
---
FUCK YOU FOR SPAWNING NEXT TO HEX RUIN.   
---
LAST 8 GAMES, TOTEM CLEANSED BEFORE I COULD CROSS THE MAP TO GET TO IT.
---
Fuck your keys and toolboxes I don't give a shit
---
I run Deliverance, Decisive Strike &amp; Dead Hard.
---
It really sucks having Deliverance ready and I can't use any of the perks when they probably realistically give me a shot at getting out.
---
Dead by Daylight rewards good decision making and positioning more than anything else. Always be aware of where you are in relation to the killer, whether his attention is elsewhere (allowing you to run around and do whatever you please) and what you should be doing with your time. Killer detection perks like kindred/empathy(!!)/spine chill are very handy indeed for this. Alert not so much.
---
As a survivor, your most valuable commodity is not gens (as everyone seems to say) but survivor lives, in the same way that gens are the most important resource for a killer. You should always strike a balance between working on the objective and helping fellow dwights - you're only on a timer once the last gen pops, so don't feel you have to glue yourself to a gen! A survivor hooked in stage 1 should never reach stage 2. 
---
When running a loop, think of your escape route. If you're on the edge of the map try and make the killer break the pallet or vault the window on the outer edge so you can run back into the centre of the map towards other loops. For this I really like using Lithe, as it lets you bridge the gap between loops. The above commenter also offers some excellent advice on positioning during chases. 
---
Otherwise, prioritize your time. Usually it isn't worth cleansing a totem, but against a killer who has only shown 3 perks so far with only 1 gen to go, it might be worth trying to play around NOED by slapping those bonesticks. 
---
One last piece of macro advice: consider the meta. Ruin and BBQ are always going to be popular perks, and you should at least have a plan for dealing with them before you ever sprint burst to your first generator. Try and work out what perks the killer is using and you will find games become much simpler. Some perks eg sloppy/totem perks/corrupt intervention advertise themselves, but for something like BBQ/pop goes the weasel/enduring/monitor and abuse/distressing, you will have to pay attention. If nothing else, picking up on what 4 perks a killer is using will let you forget about NOED!

just bought new survivor(yui kimura), im still kinda new at this game, got just 80 hours, can u suggest me some good perk builds for her ? Thanks
---
I‚Äôm sorry :(
---
ah, thanks.
---
i'll forget again soon
---
You dont understand what counterplay is, just because you cant loop her for 5 gens does not mean she doesn't have counterplay. Read my other points and tell me exactly why they dont work against the spirit. Spirit literally has more counterplay than some of the shit survivors have.
---
As a red rank console Feng, I agree :3 we are the sweetest.
---
YaY!
---
&gt; The change was a weird arbitrary change to give a gift to killers that isn't consistent with the previously established rules of the game.
---
OH PLEASE
---
previously established rules? Give me a break. That's meaningless.
---
And it was changed to prevent survivors holding the game hostage at the end *which they did*
---
as you should, it's actually counter intuitive on Doc unless you're doing the impossible skillchecks build.
---
I think it happens a decent amount.
---
If it's me and one other survivor A LOT of killers will slug you and run around trying to find the other person to get the 4K. 
---
Most survivors just rage die if they get caught too since they're first to go on a hook and then the killer has to find the crawling person.
---
I knew she had borrowed, told us in post-game.
---
Prolonging the end game for that one slim chance is not worth it.
---
Whoa, calm down there, little Timmy.
---
It‚Äôs because they literally have studied exactly where to stab you to apply bleeding and internal damage otherwise known as the deep wounds status effect
---
New challenges seem way better compared to the leaks some weeks ago.
---
I'd say the hardest for survivors will be finishing for gens in one trial and for killers 4 basement sacrifices.
---
I'm actually kinda confused by the amount of people upset at this. Literally there is nothing bad about this that I could think of, I mean why wouldn't a person DC:
---
1. Technical issues like a PC crash or you got stuck somewhere. The only legitimate reason to DC but even then the first couple of timers aren't THAT harsh and if you're having these kinds of issues in multiple games you should either check PC and internet or your the unluckiest bug attractor in existence (but since we're on dedicated servers they will get the chance to look into these cases so not even that bad after all).
---
2. You don't want to go against a certain type of Killer/Add-on/Perk: first stop being a baby, there is not a SINGLE uncounterable combo I could think of. You don't like moris? Neither do Killers like Keys but that's an entirely different topic regarding balance. Maybe your team is like "iridescent head Huntress? Alright let's buckle up and give it our best" only to be f*cked by a lazy douche pulling the plug.
---
3. You want to give a teammate hatch: commonly referred to as "tactical DC" yeah sure I didn't want that 4k either and I'm definitely not slugging because the hatch is a dumb mechanic that I can't do anything else about yeah no problem. Also if you are willing to sacrifice your BPs for a teammate a 30s timer shouldn't be a concern to you at all.
---
And to those arguing "But people will just kill themselves on first hook" hey at least they wasted the killers time a little bit, gave their BQ stack, destroyed a hook and gave you information where the killer was and where he is coming from.
---
If you have ANY other reason somebody would legitimately DC where it's justified please enlighten me, because I really struggle to understand all these people being mad at it.
---

2. THE CHOSEN ONE.  PICK ONE PERSON BEFORE THE MATCH BEGINS.  IGNORE EVERYONE BUT THEM.  ENSURE THEY DIE.

3. FUCK BLENDETTES.  TUNNEL THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF THEM, SUPPOSING YOU CAN FIND THEM.

These 'challenges' are very lackluster.

Haha time to stay as far away from the basement as possible, good luck killers!

how is it counter-intuitive? even if you dont use that build it still increases your tracking potential and synergizes well with a few of his add-ons *at least*

It is yeah, but you can just drop the toolbox when you see the killer and you are normal speed if they start to chase you
---
Toolboxes are easily the best survivor item in the game.
---

&gt;There is no countering her. It's being unpredictable for as long as possible and hope your team slam out gens. 
---
This is how killers should be countered, why complain spirit has more counterplay than some of the shit survivors have, like godloops and swf. Do you survivors want more boring m1 killers? If so keep your fucking bitching because nerfing the killers who can actually stand a chance against a good swf team will kill this game.
---
As a killer iv never seen them spawn close enough that I can effectively cover both gates.
---
Is there a link to the challenges? Can‚Äôt check in game atm
---
If you got the down then why does it matter if you literally wait just a minute. Fuck, the killer lobbies take way longer than that, but you're complaining about a measly 60 seconds? Just to give the survivors a fair chance, especially when killers have quite a lot of game mechanics that benefit them more than survivors?
---
I don't think we should be balancing the same around SWF. Make it so solo players are on the same level as SWF then buff killers around that.
---
WANNA HAVE YOUR MIND BLOWN?  YOU DON'T NEED TO GET THE SAVE.  JUST BLIND THEM WHILE THEY ARE CARRYING.
---
Heartless.
---
What have they changed then? That literally sounds the same.
---
Im surprised youre being downvoted. I've had this happen to me many times before, albeit, without franklins demise, but yeah, getting smacked at the end haooens alot, specifically if youre waiting for a teammate or was currently in a chase at the end.
---
I LOVE this!! Definitely my new phone wallpaper, thank you! Legion is my favorite killer, always love to see legion content.
---
When will Nea outfit be released that's the only 1 I want.
---
DS was already nerfed and is way situational. Killers just leave you on the ground anyway.
---
So far I‚Äôve seen this ‚Äúdie trash‚Äù meme 3 times with slightly different wording. Y‚Äôall are soooooo original.  üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ
---
well you see when I see that really good med kit or key I'm sorry but it's gotta go
---
i dont want another paragraph. When i play killer i have a harder time when not seeing survs than good loopers. Ive seen streamers struggle more with not finding survs than the best looper theyve seen. On the contrary its harder to stealth properly than to loop
---
Were you Huntress? I think I was in your game. I saw you knock her down and babysit her cheating ass.
---
That doesn't make them op. And even then some would argue against them being the best as i've seen full squads of flashlights and some of insta heals.
---
That was one awful billy.
---
Having killers that destroy solo players, which stat shows is like 90% of the playerbase, will kill this game. All killers don't need to be overkill like Nurse or Spirit to stand a chance against the few sweaty SWFs.
---
Billy and Freddy are perfect examples of strong killer that can take on any team with some thought.
---
Holy fuck
---
some people would rather pretend it only happens to survivors teabagging honestly
---
Dude, killers will just slug people on the ground to force them to wait out the entire endgame collapse. Letting the last survivor try to kobe wouldn't drag the game out anywhere near as long as that. If you're actually concerned about how long the end of the game takes, banning slugging would have a much bigger effect. If you don't want to do that because it would needlessly kill somebody's chances of winning... then it makes sense to let survivors kobe for the same reason.
---
I actually agree w this fengs at red ranks on console do always seem quite nice and never toxic
---
Can anyone confirm how many rift fragments some of these challenges give?
---
It puts too many people in tier one early game, so it's harder to have them scream to reveal themselves later when it matters.  When I face a doc, and I see someone scream at tier one madness, I bust ass to get there so I can get my cherry popped right away, as opposed to later on in the match when it matters like going for a hook save.  
---
Also the the deviousness gains from the perk just help you hit the cap faster as opposed to applying the bonus post trial, so you'll get to that 8k cap quicker, but it's not that hard to get there without using distressing.
---
Without Franklin's we have ZERO counterplay for keys or Styptics/Needles.  Whether you like it or not the perk serves a strategic use for killer.  We don't use it to be assholes.  We use it to defend ourselves against your crutches again Key is the tippy top of that list as those become essentially I Win machines.
---
Congratulations, you found the one thing about Dead by Daylight that didn't need to be fixed and made it worse.
---
No
---
&gt;because so many people aren't having fun
---
It's comments like this that make me wonder, "Am I playing a different game than all these other people?" While the amount pales in comparison to some people, I've put 150 hours in since the beginning of September, and the only time I'm not having fun is when I get camped or play against Leatherface (aside from the Huntress the other day with magnetic hatchets hitting me crouched down behind stuff from far away). And then I always see on Reddit that there's balance and fun issues, among other things. Are these issues not prevalent on Xbox? As Survivor I hover around Rank 9-10, could that be why I'm not running into these same issues?
---
Im not trying to seem stubborn, or start a debate, I'm just genuinely interested as to what I'm not seeing.
---
Tbh I'm actually a bit scared to open the game again because it's already forced my playstation off too many times and I dont want it to get permanently damaged but I may just take that risk and try reinstalling the game
---
Why do perks look like that
---
You're literally saying that because *you personally* struggle with certain things those certain things inform the truly optimal way to play. That's uh ok.
---
&gt; On the contrary its harder to stealth properly than to loop
---
this is certainly a thing an individual can say
---
I'll just note that you didn't engage with my arguments against your position at all and just reasserted yours while appealing to your own difficulties and entertainers
---
Whats your definition of a killer with counterplay? Its not get lucky its be unpredictable and get her to make the wrong read i think survivors are forgetting killers are the "power role" they have to down and hook all 4 survivors 3 times, if the killer and the survivor have equal power in a chase how the fuck is that fair?
---
Maybe xp farming?
---
"touch yourself to heal"
---
whoa there, don't let r/dbdgonewild find out about this
---
Too long for a bait post
---
QUIT TEABAGGING AT THE EXIT GATES AND GET THE HELL OUT OF MY SWAMP
---
Damn! That's amazing as all hell.
---
You bleed with both attacks. Legion drives the knife into you and causes rapid bleeding. The Oni just bats you with his sword and slices you, it's not as deep a cut.
---
 Below you have the old challenges, compare these to the new ones posted by OP, they definetly have improved them.
---

---
But 5% is a lot
---
Wraith and Huntress were easy to pick up in my case
---
Constantly getting nerfed.
---
Interesting concept but I can imagine the abuse that would have
---
Mid chase about to go down, leaves game, reconnects after
---
Yeah self care plus botany very good but self care on it‚Äôs own kinda lame especially with sloppy
---
So if 9 master challenges but only 3 log entries, does that mean doing any 3  of the master challenges will give you the last lore section?
---
This is literally all they have to do
---
Legion is bottom in terms of fun to play against, by a large margin. Sitting and mending all game and dealing with sloppy isn‚Äôt fun. 
---
But I‚Äôd say worst killer is close between clown, pig, and doctor.
---
He isn‚Äôt the worst killer it‚Äôs just such an annoying kit to go against combined with an overall weak kit. He had a couple decent perks but it‚Äôs boring to go against and pretty weak overall. The weakest killer though? Probably someone with much less map control like clown/bubba.
---
I gotta ask. How does it seem that should be easy?
---
Hi Ayce! You‚Äôre not obligated at all, so thank you for offering! I don‚Äôt use Reddit much, so preferably my twitch, but whichever makes you feel more comfortable since I‚Äôm hoping the reach funnels down there anyway eventually. Could even use the google drive link if you wanted as the credit/source if you wanted, too. :) 
---
Thanks again!
---
&gt; It puts too many people in tier one early game, so it's harder to have them scream to reveal themselves later when it matters. When I face a doc, and I see someone scream at tier one madness, I bust ass to get there so I can get my cherry popped right away, as opposed to later on in the match when it matters like going for a hook save. 
---
This is not in any way an argument that Distressing is counter intuitive. It's just your own preference
---
&gt; Also the the deviousness gains from the perk just help you hit the cap faster as opposed to applying the bonus post trial, so you'll get to that 8k cap quicker, but it's not that hard to get there without using distressing.
---
I know that. This is a weird point to make when I didn't even mention bloodpoints and it has nothing to do with Doc's gameplay
---
Or just break the totems you find as the game progresses instead of going out of your way to look for one right away. 
---
Survivors should be cleansing all the dull totems anyway to prevent the cheek clappage from a possible NOED.
---
No because then I wouldn‚Äôt be an immersed survivor please delete
---
OwO
---
Looks like you‚Äôre having fun, welcome to the reddit
---
I mean, no? Just let me unhook myself, and if I have perks that make it so I can escape I do. Dead Hard and Sprint Burst can even make the killer whiff if they aren't clipping into my model at unhook, so...
---
Why'd you cleanse???!!!
---
Yea, nice to see you! :)
---
Its from a perk pack. u can find it here [https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/e845br/updated\_neon\_space\_pack\_added\_killer\_powers\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/e845br/updated_neon_space_pack_added_killer_powers_and/)
---
It doesn't make sense. A new survivor who has experienced being hooked and attempted to escape is going to be confused why he didn't get a chance, because the game reinforces that you get a chance to escape on your first hook.
---
It's arbitrary. It would be like if you couldn't break pallets if there's 2 gens left, but could break pallets if there's more or less than 2 gens left. It doesn't follow the logical progression of what the game taught you.
---
Yes.
---
"Kills". You can't kill the Boogeyman.
---
Anything in disagreement with a killer main is downvoted here. It‚Äôs a killer circlejerk.
---
You actually think any immersed players are competent enough to even know how to get on reddit?
---
this is really true but wow sometimes BHVR baffles me w the amount of bugs in this game compared to basically every other game I‚Äôve ever played in my life. at least they didn‚Äôt just release the game and call it a day though
---
Huh, most of these seem a lot easier than I thought they were gonna be, just time consuming
---
Key nerf: carrying a key will make a survivor 200% slower increased key size to the size of onis mallet
---
Not if the killer downs you immediately after that survivor bring you back up. What else you got? I just got sick of that and left only to get penalized.
---
Imagine being able to reliably take away NOED and getting 30 second into the game Hex Cleanses all without an item to be knocked out of your hand.
---
Imagine going up against a Trapper and knowing what loops are safe and which ones aren't.  Imagine going up against a Freddy and knowing which pallets are fake.  Imagine going against a Hag and knowing what areas she hasn't trapped.
---
Small Game shouldn't be dismissed it's amazing and yes as the previous commenter pointed out it would have been a much better option than your map as it can't be countered.
---
Wait, is that a Mountie skin? Maining Jeff, an Albertan, and with my Trapper Canadian flag mask, DBD Canada edition becomes one step closer to reality...
---
+ you need to drop the animation first, either way a lose lose. Using a toolbox on a generator will mean you need to stop working, enter the drop animation then run away before the killer reaches for a hit.
---
Legion is certainly at the bottom of the list of killers. A lot of Legion's stalling ability was recently nerfed with shorter deep wound mend time and FF can't trigger sloppy anymore. FF is not a lethal ability despite overriding his basic attacks and requiring a 4 second stun to exit FF in order to down survivors.
---
Now just because Legion is at the bottom doesn't mean it's impossible to win with Legion, but most other killers will have an easier time winning than Legion will. Though one advantage Legion does have is in emblems. It's pretty hard to not safety pip with legion.
---
What‚Äôs your point?
---
Legion can be extremely good (even in high ranks) but only when following a specific build
---
* Sloppy Butcher
---
*Thanatophobia 
---
* Pop Goes the Weasel
---
* Fourth Perk of your choice (BBQ, Nurse's Calling, Ruin, etc.)
---
If you're doing anything other than a slow down strategy Legion's essentially a pushover. I think that's why everyone says they're so bad. I could run a ton of different strategies on another killer, but anything other than the above build makes legion almost impossible to win with
---
As a survivor main I'm okay with not getting the chance.
---
Survivors are already straight OP compared to killers the last thing the survivors need is **another** advantage. Let killers have this one thing please.
---
No u
---
They wont destroy solo players all the time if the solo players learned the counters
---
I described exactly why I think the perk is counter intuitive on the doctor, and the devious gains are the other half of what the perk does besides increase your terror radius.  
---
You might like it with the madness up in shock aura add ons, but that's one of your two choices.    
---
I usually run doc with a yellow/green range extension and then discipline to make the shocks have more impact.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you can‚Äôt just run both. Self Care can be a flexible pick when you can‚Äôt be healed in a certain situation or be able to get a little more out of a medkit. 
---
Iron Will if anything helps you be a bit more protected when using SC, but I think it stems from people wanting to be hyper optimal to the point where anything that‚Äôs not being chased or doing a gen is seen as a waste of time. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with SC it‚Äôs just all about the situation in which you do it in.
---
I agree, take out mori's and keys.
---
A punishment is also supposed to punish people who've done the wrong thing. Coming out the gate with a "you have a twenty year ban for DCing" isn't going to work when people have their games glitch, crash or some other bug, of which there are many. Ramping up how long you're locked out for makes sense, and is incredibly common, it's specifically done because accidental crashes and the like aren't supposed to happen repeatedly.
---
Lithe is low-key the best exhaustion perk. Every time you're in a chase, what're you gonna do? Hit them windows! It just helps no matter what, especially if they get ya with a double-back.
---
I run lithe with pretty much all of my builds, and always regret it when I take it off lol
---
No, it's Doc or Leatherface
---
Yeah tip is being unpredictable that s gf
---
The guy running around is the reason the rest of you are free to do gens.  Don't lose sight of that.  Respect it
---
LOL obviously the character stays afk in the game while you're not connected. 
---
And maybe (only) your teammates can see that you're afk
---
You would be asking every survivor to have a very specific combination of perks. I can see why Behaviour decided not to change this feature when in 95% (or more) of cases it will not change the outcome of the game. You might get a handful more points on both sides, but that isn't really worth changing a core mechanic for
---
&gt; Legion is bottom in terms of fun to play against, by a large margin.
---
lol heck no
---
&gt; Sitting and mending all game and dealing with sloppy isn‚Äôt fun. 
---
You can counter sloppy with the buffed medkits or inner strength and mending takes almost no time at all
---
there is a youtuber called truetalent, he has a playlist of ghostface. copy his build and playstyle and u will be fine.
---
Huntress: Ruin/BBQ/Whispers/Nurses

Myers: Ruin/BBQ/Infectious Fright/M&amp;A

Freddy: Ruin/BBQ/PGTW/Dying Light(or MYC) with slowdown addons to make it even less fun to play against
---
Pig: Ruin/BBQ/Enduring/Spirit Fury
---
What are you 13?
---
Yeah it's boring, but my overall point is it doesn't need a nerf.
---
Noice
---
Well then by the time you reconnect you‚Äôre gonna have crows and probably be hooked already
---
Not to mention there‚Äôs an afk husk sitting somewhere
---
Imagine one dude leaving inside of a pallet and then not coming back and all the sudden you‚Äôre getting sandbagged by an afk husk
---
Why would anyone have a discussion about it? It‚Äôs an awful idea. Let me guess, you came up with this idea because you can‚Äôt pressure gens?
---
Yeah it does. People who consistently play well will forever be in red ranks. People who don‚Äôt won‚Äôt. Rank reset does nothing now so people who are in the green/grey ranks are there because they don‚Äôt play a lot or well.
---
you couldve left
---
These are some nice ideas, great work!
---
You can‚Äôt burn their DS if this is their first hook...
---
Tell your friend he's a hero
---
Sacrificing all four Survivors in the basement. Bubba's like, "ight, imma head out."
---
&gt;This isn't an argument against it; it's an argument for a better tutorial system.
---
No, its an argument for consistency. I maintain it's bad game design when things don't make sense or their rules are broken.
---
&gt;wow good job totally ignoring how I explained to you why it isn't arbitrary and then making up a totally nonsensical analogy.
---
I disagree that being on a hook, the way it existed for half this game's life, is holding the game hostage. Again, your point is moot because your perspective is out of whack. It's not reasonable to consider that holding the game hostage.
---
&gt;And it also looks like you're talking about the hatch mechanic now rather than kobes-as-the-last-survivor.
---
You're mistaken.
---
This was a hot meme like 12 years ago so probably not
---
Survivors don‚Äôt want killers to have any other tactic than just hook and go to the next survivor and hook again.
---
I thought i made something original :(
---
Why would you send him a shitty message on xbox?
---
You breaking line of sight on these killers and buying 2 extra seconds of life isn't counterplay.
---
No but buying a minute will cost the killer a gen or 2. 
---
Stop trying to push this narrative that 90% of the playerbase just needs to learn how to counter killers that essentially ignore any part of looping
---
So survivors shouldn't have to learn how to change there playstyle against certain killers is what im hearing. This game would be more fun if every killer was actually countered differently thats why spirit and nurse are my favorite killers to go against, its actually hard and you dont just loop to counter them.
---
Or with deliverance. First time I played after that patch came I had a charged deliverance right next to the open exit gate and couldn‚Äôt do anything and was pissed
---
He was injured from being unhooked and you were in the basement during EGC. I don't blame him for not turning back for the save.
---
IM TIRED OF PLAYING SWEATY RANKED MODE. I WANT AN UNRANKED MODE SO I CAN ACTUALLY ENJOY THE FUCKING GAME
---
Should have hooked 'em before the gates were powered.
---
If the stars align and the survivor uses this to their advantage *that's okay*. It was a very specific thing they set up for themselves and were able to accomplish.
---
as a very skilled survivor i can tell you with complete confidence that it is 100% not that simple. people just like to talk shit bc they were able to hit a rank 20 dwight with the chainsaw once so they just assume it's easy
---
Yeah ok, they would need to figure something out. 
---
But honestly better die to the hook than getting a cooldown for disconnecting, expecially as killer, where the match is over for everybody
---
My usual place with SF is to just count to 15. If I can‚Äôt find a survivor in those 15 sec, I‚Äôll self care for a bit and make my way back to a gen. People more call on Bond vs SC and I use that same logic. 
---
I‚Äôm could find someone but that implies they stop doing whatever to even heal me so I‚Äôll take self care when I can. 
---
Also, you‚Äôre very welcome. &lt;3
---
No one? I‚Äôm saying it needs to be at least a little bit challenging. There‚Äôs no point in free wins. It‚Äôs not that fun for the winning side and definitely not fun for the losing side.
---
No I get that, but this entire thread‚Äôs point is last survivor not getting their escape chances on first hook. Your point is valid, but it doesn‚Äôt apply to this case, unfortunately
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
Imagine you finally get the last person hooked and you have your 4k but then he unhooks himself but don‚Äôt worry you down him and the pick him up and OH WAIT he has DS guess you shouldn‚Äôt have tunneled now he‚Äôs running to either the open hatch or if the hatch ain‚Äôt open then okay or maybe the gates are open and there he goes right out the gate because of dumb luck
---
Key data is probably skewed from the archive challenge to deplete keys. I'm probably wrong in saying this, but in 800ish hours I actually don't know if I've ever seen a rare key before that challenge ever lol.
---
oof
---
Gen Tappers are adorable.  They've basically just given up on improving at the game.  Should I practice skillchecks and actually become a useful red rank teamate?  Naaaaaaaahhhhhhh.  I'll just double the repair time and look like a noob while doing it.  BRILLIANT!
---
Ooooh fancy, two licenses and no money for either copyright holder.
---
No, that's the thing. EVERYONE can get to red ranks with just enough time, and the new system makes it infinitely easier. Before, red rank games were usually only infested with complete garbage Blendettes at the end of the month, when they had loads of time. Now they get set back to rank 5 instead, meaning they're there almost immediately. Less rank regression just means that even terrible players will earn net gains in their pips due to the length of season compared to rank reset frequency.
---
Our only objective isn't gens lol we have 4 categories just as well as killer. We have to do gens,  clense totems,  save team mates,  heal team mates,  run from the killer,  and if we get that far open the exit gate. While we do all that,  the killer has to chase, patrol gens,  and hook. I've had games were our whole team gets destroyed in 2 minutes. Sucks, but is there anything I can do? No. Just move on. I know not everyone is powering thru ruin gens,  so chase and patrol your totem some esp if swf. They'll be trying to clense it,  and you'll get to hit and injure a few of them. Which will make them heal, and slow down gen time as well. Know when to leave chases.
---
Whether or not they pressed the leave game button
---
yep what more can i say than my own perspective and its good that you're firm on you're beliefs. Its everyones game
---
But survivors get struggle points
---
So your saying there's a chance
---
That's how I got mine si yes I can confirm. Confirm that it works and that I'm bad at flashlight saves lol
---
Bro, who the fuck has a 5k karma main and a 68k karma alt? Nice try, but nah. You're just a bit of a cunt, aren't you mate?
---
First time I dc‚Äôd I actually didn‚Äôt get a penalty at all. Thank god too because I had to quit from a bug
---
Except you don't do anything to counter them! Not once they're good enough.
---
When you want to post 2 or more hours of footage of you escaping these killers every time you get them, the be my guest.
---
But you won't, because there is very little you can do to  increase your chances of escaping against those killers, besides complete immersion. 
---
Just because you looped a Nurse or Spirit who's trying to do a daily or got carried to higher rank than they should be by them, doesn't mean you countered the killer.
---
9/10 times I get more salty at my teammates than the killer
---
Huntress noed is scary, not for the survivors but for the killer lol
---
HOOKING 5 SURVIVOR IN THE BASEMENT IN THE SAME GAME CHALLENGE WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK

ENTITY HATES THIS GUY
---
*read more...*
---
Aside from the server issues, I don't get what some of you want them to do.
---
**Unfun/"OP"** killer builds: Is BHRV supposed to forbid the usage of certain perks in tandem with other perks? Then that would make it unfun for the killer, being shoehorned into a build they don't want.
---
**Useless teammates**: Report. Or, if on Xbox (maybe PS4), use the LFG feature, or there's the LFG subreddit, or get your friends to play.
---
I've seen complains about looping/teabagging Survivors. While the teabagging is tilt worthy, it isn't grounds to DC, or to report. Looping survivors isn't either. If you're tunneling hard enough that one survivor is forced to loop you endlessly, just move on, unless they're the last one obviously.
---
I saw some complaints about playing on certain maps as certain killers: Is BHVR supposed to be like "Oh, they're Huntress. Better give them a map with lots of open spaces"?
---
Some complaints have been valid (slugging, bodyblocking teammates, etc) but some of them, like complaining about Ruin, NOED, etc, is ridiculous. Hex Totems are distinguishable for a reason.
---
That guy running around will be me at a certain point time. Everyone already knows being alive while chased is good. Its just few respect the ones focusing on being unseen so they can do gens
---
This is why I play Freddy because ‚ÄúFreddy sucks‚Äù
---
So when I do win, people don‚Äôt usually trash talk me they trash talk their mates.
---
i mean i wouldnt blame them, i saw a story of a twitch streamer who were found cuz one of her stalkers found out which train she uses from the reflection on her eyes, went there and raped her. some people are just no... so...
---
Oh this meme again
---
&gt; No, its an argument for consistency. I maintain it's bad game design when things don't make sense or their rules are broken.
---
Once again, if you wanna argue for consistency let's bring back old Moris. I'm 100 all in on your "nothing should ever change" mindset, fambam.
---
And just because you assert over and over and over it doesn't make sense or the "rules are broken" doesn't make it so. Those are called "your feelings"
---
After reading your last two paragraphs you're not even talking about what everyone else is, and then swinging wildly across topics to claim that everyone else is wrong. You are not a reasonable person
---
Well i know that i could've left but i don't want to be that type of gamer that plays only for the win
---
I don't think survivors should be afraid to get hit when looping a frenzied legion is nearly impossible unless the legion player is garbage. The whole design is just not workable.
---
I got better performance out of Pre-Rework Freddy compared to Legion.
---
Someone's Mommy and Daddy never stopped letting them win in Candyland growing up.  Sometimes we get downed.  Sometimes we die.  Take it like a grown up and not a little kid and finish the games you queue into.  It's beyond pathetic and people like you are the reason the devs had to implement this.
---
ITS PRETTY FUCKING HARD WHEN THE NEEDLE LAGS ACROSS THE FUCKING CIRCLE LIKE A TELEPORTING SATELLITE AROUND EARTH
---
But both Dead Hard &amp; Borrowed Time are super common perks and top tier.
---
Decisive strike is pretty common too. We're not that out in left field here.
---
Maybe just my opinion but a futile last survivor I feel like the chance to get raised slightly
---
Enjoy hell

STOP SHOUTING PPL!

No don‚Äôt remove the obi wan üò≠
---
If you agree it‚Äôs boring, why are you against making a change? Why should boring things exist in a game? And like I‚Äôve said, my suggestion wouldn‚Äôt even be that big of a nerf since you can just drop the toolbox and it might even clutch a game if another survivor completes a gen with your toolbox that you otherwise would‚Äôve been carrying.
---
When all of your teammates dc, you are the killers last hope to get bloodpoints in the sacrifice category
---
Some people suck. One time I ran Myers around the whole time got downed just when the doors opened I gave the game to those randos and they left me first hook.
---
Yeah. Or if they have Deliverance, not being able to yeet off the hook like a total badass (*sad Adam noises*).
---
Not getting caught twice?
---
Cool thats literally not done, as you get less emblems and then don't pip.
---
Well now that i'm thinking it wasn't a great idea but on the moment i raged a bit
---
AS A SURVIVOR MAIN I NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE SAY BBQ IS OP WHEN U CAN JUST HOP IN A FUCKING LOCKER WTF, ALSO BUFF WGLF SO IT HAS ANOTHER USE LIKE BBQ DOES
---
That look in Laurie‚Äôs eyes is pure fear and just realization
---
That's what the entire thread is about, but in this comment chain I was referring to the 2nd and 3rd level comments, specifically the guy I replied to's point that there's "literally zero counterplay" to survivors being able to Kobe if last on hook with DS.
---
YEAH WGLF NEEDS SOMETHING, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT. MOST OF WHAT IT COULD HAVE IS COVERED BY OTHER PERKS.
---
I still find it annoying that because you got hooked last with no one on hook means you're locked out of getting the struggle bloodpoints
---
MY PERPETUAL RANK 20 FRIEND DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THAT MUCH TROUBLE
---
I mean if you‚Äôre at the exit gate couldn‚Äôt you just pick it up while they are wiping their blade?
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone will steal this but sign your work
---
I mean, Legion already has to stab you 37 times in the chest to down you so anything's possible...
---
SOMEONE SAID WHEN U GET THE SAFE UNHOOK POINTS U SHOULD SEE THE AURA OF THE KILLER AND OTHER SURVIVORS FOR X NUMBER OF SECONDS
---
I still want this bastard as a killer
---
Why though? Killers just gunna smack you down and put you right back up. Doing this will only add more end game chat salt because that survivor who got the 4% is going to feel like he should have been let go.
---
Or they‚Äôre going to make up a new rule and say something like ‚Äúyou owe me 3 seconds if I unhook and am last survivor‚Äù 
---
Giving the last guy the 4% is literally pointless
---
First killer I bought, love her. Really fun power, and so many survivors panic when facing her.
---
Try that when you get tunnelled or hook farmed when you are a solo survivor.
---
More like way too easy..
---
I can smell the Huntress skin, instant buy
---
SOME MATCHES THAT SHIT IS EASY BUT OTHERS DUDE THE FRAMES JUST ARENT GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP UP
---
I'M GETTING -1 EVERY GAME TODAY BUT I'M GLAD CAUSE I HATE PLAYING ON RED RANKS VS TRYHARDING KILLERS ALL THE TIME I JUST WANNA HAVE FUN BUT I DON'T
---
you‚Äôre real fuckin lucky if you‚Äôve never gotten a killer ever that just keeps trying to slug everyone over and over
---
Oh! Oh I see. My bad then
---
Sure, but I think you're looking at this through the lens of your own experiences. Most likely one of those perks is not enough to do anything on its own if you are the last survivor, so even if people run one of those perks it doesn't change the game. You're still asking people to build around this scenario specifically. That could be fun, and I wouldn't mind being given the chance to 4%, but I get why it hasn't been changed.
---
I don't focus on being unseen ever and still get plenty of Iridescent Lightbringer games.  For me the issue and why I think so little of stealth gamers is this is a game of time management and they waste so much of it.  A lot of this can be seen in your final statement.  You absolutely should be running ANYTIME you can.  Like if the killer isn't in heartbeat range at the very least run dude.  Stealth gamers pretend their run trigger is busted.  They crawl everywhere and waste oodles of time.  Also if the killer isn't coming back just heal immediately don't waste 20 seconds making me chase you to the outskirts of the map.  That's 20 wasted seconds I didn't heal you.  Just saying while there is a time and place for stealth it is often misused and at the cost of your team.
---
So what? So it's really bold to complain that much about Survivors when November's stats showed that on average, Killers do better than Survivors. 
---
Keys are overpowered? Please, at least you actually have to play the game and waste time for them to work. And it's not even sure that you are going to use it anyway. Mories on the other hand? Completely overpowered items that kick a survivor early in the game.
---
So yeah, that's the "so what". I think it's time for Killer mains to stop looking for nerf everywhere for the Survivor side, because currently, it's the Killer side that needs a rework.
---
Red jacket Claudette with urban evasion in a game with Pig is the worst
---
Can't they distinguish between a legitimate DC and when someone presses the leave match button?
---
DOTA matches are very long and painful if you lose players (at least from when I used to play, it's been a long time) where as DBD matches are a lot shorter and it's still viable to win with a DC player. Encouraging a system where people can leave just because one person did means you'll have significantly more matches of people just giving up and time being wasted.
---
I prefer to not? It‚Äôs hard to get the habit since all my art is on paper or painted on paper.
---
Just give them max struggle points so they aren't punished for being the last one hooked.
---
it‚Äôs different
---
If its already 20-30 mins on console then its gonna be way longer with dedicated servers.  You get put in your closest server which in NA is Ohio, then you have to wait for killer/survivors that are +/- 6 of your level.  Their ranking system needs to go and their MM algorithm is one of the worst.
---
what part about this story is unbelievable?
---
I love the feature, I hope they keep and and make it more severe!!
---
You beautiful son of a bitch.
---
She best not be killing any Scoops Steves though.
---
Escaping isn‚Äôt necessarily winning. It‚Äôs amazing how many people think that an escape is the only thing that matters. 
---
That being said, I am glad you went for the save. Sometimes it‚Äôs just fun to see if you can pull it off, regardless of whether you die or not.
---
Der Nazi
---
Deliverance and Adrenaline. Maybe even dead hard
---
There are ways to leave without pressing leave match, though. If they only put the timer on people who hit leave match, obviously every DCer will just close their game with those tactics.
---
&gt;Once again, if you wanna argue for consistency let's bring back old Moris. I'm 100 all in on your "nothing should ever change" mindset, fambam.
---
You're completely missing the point.
---
I'm not saying that things can't change. I'm saying it's not consistent with itself. The generator example is apt. If they made it so you couldn't break pallets with any amount of gens left, then it would be a shitty update, but it would be consistent with it's own rules. My issue is the consistency. It's established that if you haven't been hooked before, you get attempts to escape. But because some killers were offended or something, the arbitrary change was made.
---
Also, the point you're wrongly making invalidates your arguments lol.
---
&gt;I'm 100 all in on your "nothing should ever change" mindset, fambam.
---
Then you agree that the change should have never happened, and all your arguments are moot.
---
WHEN I PLAY SURVIVOR I GET SMACKED FROM TEN MILES AWAY AND WHEN I PLAY KILLER MY WEAPON GOES DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR BUTTHOLE AND NOTHING, WHY DEVS WHY
---
You're exactly what's wrong with the community.  You made a thread about how triggered you got that he didn't save you and you are even madder that he reported whatever shitty thing you sent him for playing a game.  
---
Your lack of self awareness is astounding.

Here are some general tips that are popular for Ghostface right now
---
- Don't stalk. Just use power to stealth and get free hits.
---
- Use power recovery add-ons.
---
- Most popular build is Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Thanataphobia, and Nurse's Calling.
---
5% is actually quite a lot in this game. Like another commentor pointed out it's a buff to bloodlust. Plus again, it's not a needed nerf. Nerfs should be for items or abilities, etc that are considered op/broken. Noed is boring to me, BT is boring to me. Doesn't mean they need to be nerfed.
---
ADEPT KILLER SHOULD JUST BE 4K WITH THE THREE TEACHABLE PERKS CHANGE MY MIND
---
The sand people travel in single file to hide their numbers...
---
No, all it really requires is Decisive Strike.
---
If someone Kobe's off the hook, and the killer is facecamping them for the insta-down, they can stun them and take off again.
---
Absolutely not.  
---
 If you're going to kobe infront of the killer with I'm guessing deliverance, you should probably be running D strike as well.
---
It's not all about escaping. As long as you were active in other areas, you can still pip up. unless you're doing a number of escapes in a row, then ya. That sucks
---
I love the tea bag! Nice job!
---
Sorry but I can't take this argument seriously. This is a game, of course you're supposed to have counter plays, not just mind games and spin the lucky roulette. I'm pretty sure the devs are trying to balance the game and will definitely not (fortunately) follow the logic where a Killer should just destroy Survivors.
---
How is it fair that a killer has no counter? Popular streamers describe Spirit very well, you can make the chase take longer, but you won't escape the chase, except if the killer is very bad. You can read other Killers and play around their powers, for Spirit, you have no indication of when she's using her power (except if you hear the vacuum sound when she's out of range).
---
You could say the exact same thing for doors spawning as far away as possible it‚Äôs RNG get used to it it screws over both sides sometimes
---
I think 4 basement sacrifices and 5 Agitation basement hooks will be hard.
---
It's not losing the game to get a 3K
---
Not really, the worst are still in it.
---
Well looks like its back to farming with the survs
---
And what if the hatch is closed? What if the gates aren't open? What if you aren't close to either? What if, like many survivors, you aren't running DS? Again, I'm not against it, but it makes no difference to the outcome in the vast majority of cases, so I understand why it's not in the game
---
The entity demands why more physically than jigsaw ever did if u can believe that
---
There's so many different ways to DC than just clicking leave.
---
* Alt+F4 if on PC. 
---
* Task Manager if on PC
---
* Force the game to close through the menu on Xbox/PS4. 
---
* Turn off your Switch.
---
* Turn off your console.
---
* Unplug your internet for a few minutes.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecfg04/tome_1_level_4_challenge_are_now_live/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
You don‚Äôt even really deserve that big of a chance if the hatch is closed meaning the killer killed everyone else and beat you to the hatch survivors are lucky they even get that last chance in the first place
---
I just turn 90 degrees and walk straight at them LMAO, works like 70% of the time or starts a close chase at worst
---
You do realize that the DC penalty is a minute for the first offense, right?
---
If you can crash, boot up the computer, boot up the game, get your build, item, and offering in place, and get back into a queue in a minute, you need to spend money on things that are not your computer.
---
If it's not your first offense, either because you keep crashing or you DCed a ton of times prior, I have no sympathy at all.
---
almost everyone on this subreddit seems physically incapable of doing this
---
Hes low tier, but i wouldnt say hes the worst
---
Hatch can be closed. Why is it the only time updates/changes are viable to you people is when it only benefits the killer?
---
That‚Äôs a really bad excuse for not crediting yourself.  Take more pride in your work.
---
No. They should make it so if you have BT na unhook yourself you get BT.
---
THAT'S JUST A BETTER BABYSITTER
---
you will not have enough time by the time you pick it back up you will be smacked again
---
But my idea is that if you do not have deliverance or decisive, that 4% chance to unhook yourself would just go in vein if you are immediately hit again without delay.
---
Christmas
---
My thoughts exactly...
---
I love having to throw games just to do 4 gens with dark sense. god forbid the killer be a pig or something.
---
Life and games done work off that mind of logic. If it did, then the game would automatically just quit and give the pips to a rank 1 killer playing Legion when against four rank 20 survivors, because they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot going to win anyways.‚Äù
---
Game logic just doesn‚Äôt work that way. The only reason they auto kill the last person is so they can‚Äôt delay it. There is always a chance to win. They just don‚Äôt feel like that chance is worth the possible negative outcome. But to suggest there is no way to win is ignorant.
---
All of it.
---
why? it‚Äôs dumb to unhook someone in front of the killer
---
I‚Äôve always wondered why this isn‚Äôt a thing
---
&gt;Sacrifice 4 Survivor(s) in the basement. Master Challenge - Single Trial
---
Insidious Bubba: Now this looks like a job for me
---
You're gonna go far in this life.
---
Penalty is a minute for first offense, just boot the game up and enjoy the cinematic.
---
If you DCed to the point where the game crashes and you're locked out for 45 minutes, I have no sympathy for you at all.
---
BBQ Ruin and nurses calling are some good perks for him and maybe sloppy butcher
---
Most people at red ranks wouldn‚Äôt pick you up after they downed you anyways because they all assume you run DS.
---
No, it's for the instance if someone unhooks themself
---
They probably don't realize that the killer still gets bloodpoints if they dc during the hook
---
Clown and doctor probably are the worst
---
Those are nothing compared to finish 4 generators by yourself with dark sense....
---
I misread it but still like why would you unhook yourself right in front of the killer you‚Äôre just asking to get hooked again lol
---
*Laughs in client side*
---
You can make that argument about anything though.
---
"A good killer can easily down survivors at those loops"
---
Can we get big bootie Jane?
---
I‚Äôd say maybe face camping. Could say when you swing your legs in the air you kick them in the face and stun them. But if they are further than in your face it shouldn‚Äôt do anything. Sadly it‚Äôs part of the game and you just take it and move on to the next one.
---
Also if you pretend to wiff 360's, sometimes they'll only try to 360 instead of going for a loop. Easy kills lol.
---
these are some awesome skins, the huntress one looks crazy cool. dwight is cute as fuck too. meg‚Äôs is nice but i just like her jacket, the rest is mehh.
---
You can just tap a 99'd generator to get the progress, so no.
---
Any word about a winter event? 
---
BhVR: ‚Äúlook more cosmetics‚Äù 
---
Hopefully during the devs q&amp;a we get some clear answers on what‚Äôs going on with the game and not a bunch of mumbled jargon with stutters like they don‚Äôt know what to say...
---
*opens dbd* my PS4: time to break the fucking sound barrier bitch
---
Agree. Sometimes DBD ain't the right game and that is A-OK :)
---
I still can‚Äôt get the ‚Äúescape with Spine Chill without being hooked‚Äù challenge. I‚Äôve come SO close but that one has just been too hard for me at red rank.
---
it‚Äôs not by urself, you just need to be on the gen when it‚Äôs finished. that being said, it‚Äôs still annoyingly hard.
---
If you're going to just get face camped until second phase or until death, It's worth an attempt
---
Nah it would be normal so that I can farm some extra points a little bit before the game ends.
---
Keys cant be used to escape 2 mins into the game.  And Moris counter keys.
---
Are you horrible at the game or do you just pretend to be?
---
At least if we use kindred we'll see the killer stand still to get insidious.
---
yeah I dont get it, its 2 buttons
---
It's probably because they have Sprint Burst.
---
Oh lol I thought you where like being super series and going off of what you think a katana actually is like in reality my bad mate lol, have a good one!
---
its not too much for me at all..LMAO! i do and i will continue do what i want. and YOU nor bhvr cannot stop me...:) and this will bother and everyone else who cry on reddit for DCs...
---
I played a game just yesterday where my first hook was during EGC as the last survivor alive and I had Deliverance but never got to use it because it forces you to die. I could've escaped that round if I had the change to pull myself off the hook.
---
What survivors will all agree to being killed in the basement tho
---
Also that and trap 6 survivors in one match vs. escape as claudette once
---
Oh yeah... I'm a big dumb
---
Because I never mentioned how many there was
---
Yes, that is part of the joke
---
Yes of course
---
As i said in the comments i don't play necessarily to win, but to have fun and I sincerly think that I would've tried to help him
---
MY LOADING SCREEN GOT STUCK AT 99% WITH THE LOGO THING STILL MOVING, BUT THEN I GOT BOOTED OUT AND GOT A DC PENALTY. I DON'T LIKE THIS.
---
Grab a medkit and you can Elf Care everyone.
---
Which, ironically, mean you don't need to run it.
---
 It would also give you the chance to crawl for the hatch or door if they are open, or force them leave to kick hatch or to pick you up giving the DS.
---
Unbreakable and Tenacity's existence make the thought process of just slugging you for the next minute more complicated, especially if they are slug racing towards the open gate.
---
I only get red rank survivors, and I'm only rank 9-10. It's actually really frustrating trying to play nurse unless I get a really good map. But I figure it must eventually make me a better player.
---
This. There's also the issue that, in a standard game (where the Killer isn't being merciful and "respecting the 4%") if a Survivor unhooks themselves as the only person remaining they will just go down again, especially if the hatch was closed. This is why (as flawed as it is) the hatch exists as a mechanic: if a Survivor is found by a Killer there's pretty much no channelled action they can do. If a Survivor had to repair gens solo they wouldn't be able to do it. Henceforth hatch, which you can escape through mid chase.
---
That being said there are still games as Killer where I want to let the last person go but don't because of BBQ stacks or whatever. I do have several games where I say "if either of the last two Survivors unhook themselves I'll let them go." If the last Survivor could 4% (or use Deliverance which I also don't think would be that bad) I do think it would be fun purely for social gameplay shenanigans.
---
I think we are gonna see more basement dwelling bubbas for the next few weeks
---
"survivors should be allowed to make bad plays for no cost to themselves and also punish the killer"
---
and your post is upvoted. once again, this explains A LOT of what I see on this forum.
---
Awww
---
I play to have fun and I certainly have more fun when I escape
---
No point. Killer could just face camp since he‚Äôs the last one alive.
---
I‚Äôve done this against people with deliverance
---
I don't think a change like this would ever be game-breaking, but the lack of varied gameplay and outcomes is absolutely an argument against and not for? Besides, the 4% argument just feeds into this; just because you've acknowledged this is a 'what if' scenario that doesn't suddenly make the problem go away...statistically you will see ass-all happen in 96% of games, and in probably 90% of those remaining 4% of games, nothing will happen. Why would a survivor want to play that out, and why would a dev want to invest time to change their game?
---
It's about whether you can have fun trying to Kobe, and right now I think it will just give survivors more salt to sprinkle on killers in endgame chat. These are not 'unnecessary considerations', it's about whether the game is worth stringing out for another minute or two.
---
Let's not be disingenuous about the hatch. It's much harder to escape after the Endgame Collapse patch, and again you are asking survivors to bring a specific item for this scenario! A scenario which is vanishingly rare to begin with (being the last survivor without having been hooked during the game). If this change ever gets introduced, killers will make sure to slug the final survivor and close hatch first, making it worthless. 
---
Now that I think about it, what are the chances of getting a purple/red key from a chest?? Basically zero without plunderers instinct. So survivors would have to run yet another perk to even have a chance at having fun in a situation that has almost no chance of happening?
---
Sacrifice 4 survivors in basement WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK, ITS RNG THE CHALLENGE, SIX FEET UNDER? MORE LIKE RNG-SUS UNDER. Kick the same generator 4 times, WHAT, IF A GENERATOR GETS KICKED MORE THEN ONCE ITS CAUSE SURVIVORS ARE DOING IT A LOT AND WILL BE DONE BEFORE YOU GET 4 KICKS
---
I do this all the time especially with ghostface
---
quick patrick take notes
---
jokes aside thanks for the tip
---
Doubt we'd ever get a map for Ash, though the concept is cool. Excited to see more cosmetics for him though! Bringing the chainsaw back would be great: we'd finally have a good hand cosmetic that isn't Ashy Slashy!
---
well tbh they didnt make money of those exclusives
---
Where can I get one....
---
r/whoosh
---
That‚Äôs not even my point. You finish all the killer challenges in 1 game. 
---
Survivor challenges take like 5 at least.
---
lol literally demanding that the "respect the 4 percent" from the survivor rule book become a mechanism
---
wew
---
You must be really bad
---
I KNOW BUT DAMN BABYSITTER IS SO ASS RIGHT NOW MIGHT AS WELL REWORK THAT PERK INTO SOMETHING ELSE TOO
---
I should've been more specific, I DC on slug when 2 are dead, one in a bush and killer goes sightseeing.
---
again what part of it? him having a girlfriend? her making a meme? him being better than her?
---
four gens in one match with a perk i would never use otherwise. why
---
I dont know. I have been getting lucky with shape challenges recently.
---
FOR SURE
---
Lmfao, it does! 
---
As long as Mcote is there waiting for us shouting out ‚ÄúGood Job So Far‚Äù then I‚Äôm fine with this...
---
Latency is also a factor here. If you send the unhook action to the server and the server has already gotten the survivor‚Äôs stop unhooking action, you‚Äôll see the unhook start and then stop abruptly, and the survivor won‚Äôt be affected.
---
This seems to have become more frequent with dedicated servers, though it‚Äôs possible that‚Äôs just because I was typically the server host in my killer games.
---
If you‚Äôre in an unhook standoff where it‚Äôs just you and some survivors standing next to the hook, more competent survivors will try to tease out a hit by starting the unhook and then stopping shortly after, hoping you‚Äôll swing after they‚Äôve stopped and then using that cooldown to unhook without getting grabbed.
---
1. The killer would literally just camp you because there are no other survivors to look for so no reason not to secure the last kill
---
2. There would be plenty of survivors abusing it by just not trying and hanging there wasting time
---
wait that is it
---
TEABAGGING AND FLASHLIGHT CLICKING AT THE EXIT GATE AT ME, A RANK 19 KILLER COMPLETELY NEW TO THE GAME JUST GOING FOR A PIG DAILY CHALLENGE, WHERE I DIDN'T EVEN USE REVERSE BEAR TRAPS AND ONLY HAD 1 PERK SLOT??? YEAH??
---
I laugh and go win the game
---
As a killer main who hates survivors I gotta say I hate that killer more. You deserved every point you made there!!!
---
This mostly seem easier than level 3 lol
---
only two or three of them seem shitty
---
EGC? Man this clip is old.
---
almost all of the challenges are at worst a little time consuming. you're just saying The Thing to get upvotes
---
They're annoying and idiots because all they're doing is losing out on their points. They're not achieving anything except making the Killer's job easier if said Killer doesn't go easy when there's a DC. It's kind of pathetic, really. Why place a game like this if you're going to tantrum over a loss? These last few days I've had more than a few teammates disconnect the very moment the Killer touched them for the first time in a match no matter how good things were otherwise going for us. I even had teammates disconnect the second the Killer merely saw them in matches where we'd nearly finished. I had two people DC on me when I was playing Killer yesterday. They'd both looped me for a few minutes and the second I downed them they quit.
---
I usually report them even if it actually works or not and move on with my day.
---
&gt;Just walk it off
---
Just run it off, actually, because when your guts are coming out of your chest nothing helps fix the problem like a quick jog.

You did nothing wrong nor are you at a significant advantage. This survivor is just excreting Salt as most do when they fuck up and fail to admit their own mistakes.
---
I was actually pretty content with the [original design](https://i.imgur.com/W5IjF9z.jpg) for Mike - but when I looked at the gallery of killers as a whole the Mike piece stuck out like a sore thumb - and it was pretty unpopulr with you all, so I decided to do a redesign. I'm a lot more happy with this one.

**Next up**: The Nightmare, I'm pretty deep into his design and am happy with it. Probably not until after new years though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
To answer some common questions:
---
&gt; "Are you / when are you going to do X killer?"
---
Yes, I'm planning to do all of them, including The Oni and whoever else gets revealed. I don't have them planned out in terms of when I'm doing which killer - just kinda of letting it happen. I know everyone is chomping at the bit for Legion, and I have some solid ideas for them, but they'll probably be wo I do last
---
&gt; "Are you going to do the survivors?"
---
No. I did Dwight because he's my boy (and I wanted to do a pizzagram), but generally speaking the survivors aren't as visually interesting and they don't have the sort of strong iconography that makes doing the killers engaging from a design perspective. Oh, and also I'm shit at doing faces (as you can see with my Dwight). And no technology exists capable of making colors bright enough to accurately depict like 98% of Min's outfits. 
---
&gt; "Can I use this design for a tattoo?"
---
My stance on tattoo design is to contact me via DM and we can hash out the details but, generally, yeah, I'm cool with that.
---
&gt; What equipment/apps do you use?
---
Most of the work is done in Procreate on an ipad / apple pencil combo with some occasional photoshop involved. 
---
&gt; What else do you work on?
---
Quite a bit - I'm also working on hashing out a [Fallout series](https://i.imgur.com/OjxZuoT.jpg) similar to this one, working on two seperate sets of tarot cards (one based on my [own designs](https://i.imgur.com/kwbBgl2.jpg) and one based on [hiphop / rap artists](https://i.imgur.com/Fky8eva.jpg)), regularly doing pieces based on Ari Aster's films [Hereditary](https://i.imgur.com/bm1gcmO.jpg) and [Midsommar](https://i.imgur.com/Vf5PIhP.jpg), and I'm also a [nightscape photographer](https://www.instagram.com/davecarender/)... so I stay busy. 
---
&gt; Are you making stickers / prints?
---
Yes. The plan is to open an etsy shop when I finish all of the killers - probably sometime q1 next year.
---
More of my work can be found on my IG at: [@gopencyprep](https://www.instagram.com/gopencyprep/) give it a follow.
---
&gt;How is it fair that a killer has no counter?
---
I am sorry but have you tried any of the things i mentioned above? Also when doctor got his buff a while back survivors said he had no counterplay a year later they think he is weak and he is getting a rework. Quit your fucking bitching, try different strategys, adapt. Spirit is very fun to play against if you know how to counter her. Tru3 gets a lot of shit in this sub but watch his video on how to counter spirit its helpful.
---
Ehy
---
It was my time, today, to repost this
---
Yep. Survivor hiding behind a tree, wondering if you've seen them? Casually walk past them, then do a quick turn and you almost always get a free hit.
---
I am ignorant, what does "allowed to 4% off the hook" mean?
---
Thanks.
---
time to equip a no mither gen rush build
---
I feel like Dwight has always been like that - his default outfit has the shirt tucked in, but the pants low, and as a result all of his cosmetics have his pants low on his waist. 
---
I get why they did it though, at least it‚Äôs consistent, otherwise all of his outfits would clip through the top and bottom.
---
He was hitting him on the hook, it‚Äôs the killer equivalent of t-bagging. It‚Äôs BM.
---
Yah I felt bad doing this same thing last night because I was getting my ‚Äúsacrifice 2 poor victims during endgame collapse‚Äù achievement.  
---
BBQ came in handy since dude was hiding in the back.
---
?
---
Wait what?
---
Also seriously Ninja is old news. I don't know why anyone gives a shit about him anymore. Even the Fortnite community has kinda ostracized him for being "pretty good but super toxic."
---
honestly what did the devs think while making these? it‚Äôs 100% necessary to farm at this point. why make challenges that can literally not be completed in a normal circumstance?
---
I see next to no other alternative, except for shackled hag maybe
---
I don't understand this at all.
---
No you really cant, those loops are 2 small and weird shaped to have billy work effectively on
---
Reminds me of the facecamping basement Hag who did it "for the Rift" and at the same time would shake her head and swing at the air when my friend tried to blind her for his flashlight blind daily.
---
She also insisted that she wasn't camping against two people with Kindred. Bitch we can see you standing 3 feet away from the basement with Insidious.
---
Clearly to charge the warp drive.
---
The old version required a successful deep wounds hit, so your TR didn't blow up the entire map until you were ready to strike.
---
Current version triggers whenever you enter Frenzy.
---
It's still pretty good for causing confusion and scaring people off of generators.
---
It‚Äôs what happens to me when I play either survivors I play with dc or I get errors while trying to get into matches
---
And DS
---
David from Rotten Fields against Freddy with the Monstrous Shrine challenge?
---
Ya that isn‚Äôt possible, clearly hacking/cheating somehow.
---
Just how long doing every adept + the huntress and legion achievement alone....
---
Farm until the end, teach them a valuable lession. 
---
Honestly though just play as normal and slug, it's boring effective.
---
Well we think differently :)
---
Right? Like sure you really don‚Äôt stand a chance but it feels so much more satisfying to get that last ditch effort.
---
Thanks, tried it but it still doesn't work :(
---
What happens if the disconnect is not intentional but it's your connection dropping?
---
I wish I had üòî
---
The longer you look at it the better it gets
---
ah. Didn't know how those perks interacted.
---
You said BHVR has a hard on for licensed killers.  That insinuates that you think there are too many and that they keep putting them in over original. Therefore, stating the amount of licensed killers is relevant because it shows how there‚Äôs not as many as you think.
---
Just no...like really...no
---
People cried for dedicated servers now here we are.
---
The Dwight costume jingles! I love it so much!
---
Sorry to bring the bad news but...
---
*You're
---
His power is only really good for early game unless there's a lot of leaning points, because as soon as Survs know you exist they start moving their cameras like Juice WRLD's more epileptic cousin. If you want to utilize your power PAST this always lean and 99, then just walk up and pop em for easy downs. Good perks for him if you don't want to be super toxic is discordance, I'm all ears, and thrilling tremors. For add ons do ones that increase stalking while not leaning combined with exposure longevity. Or, equip the speed while crouching stacked and be just a stealthy m1 killer. That's like his two main playstyles.
---
My game was last night, ps4.  My username is my psn name if your on ps4 and recognise it, also thanks for my first silver.
---
This guy says I‚Äôm complaining, what am asshole! /s
---
Yes. Out of the entire playerbase the one or 2 dickhead survivors you found talking shit account for every single other human being that plays this game. Well done galaxy brain
---
I was actually kind of sad when I started knowing the layout of every map, the game seemed so much scarier when you have no idea where you are lol
---
Hold up, the new cosmetic jingles, making you easier to locate?
---
Now I'm curious if the killer can hear that jingle
---
Please, show me a single instance of a competent killer tunneling a survivor who manages to escape without being downed twice.
---
No. No. Absolutely no. It would make Deliverance + DS a free win if the door was open already.
---
Yes
---
I think you have forgotten to read my last sentence.
---
yeah dude, its insane
---
Haha thanks, it‚Äôs just a quick comment that I didn‚Äôt realize hurt so many peoples feelings. It totally didn‚Äôt come across my mind this way, and besides the trapper is more my type anyway üòõ (this is the licking lips emoji btw)
---
Completely agree with this^
---
Imagine facecamping with a killer who can teleport
---
I think your babylegs clown was the first I‚Äôve seen of these and it‚Äôs still my favorite üòÇ these are all amazing though! Can‚Äôt wait to see freddy
---
The Hindered status effect is only 3.75%, but ignoring that, there‚Äôs nothing fun about having to drop your green kitted-out chest to run a loop and then finding it missing when you finally make it back.
---
Just run Franklin‚Äôs.
---
Oh no I read it.
---
yeah, thanx!  my insta is gregmurphytattoos
---
Does it make noise in game?
---
I'd argue that flashlights are not that good because you stall the game by going for saves, meaning no gens are being done, and the killer can easily bait them. Instaheals pre nerf were arguably on par with toolboxes, but at the moment the syringe is an ultra rare that takes 16 seconds to have an effect and the styptic agent has counterplay by waiting 8 seconds after a survivor uses it. Toolboxes on the other hand allow you to complete gens much faster with add ons, and the only counterplay would be franklin's which is the same counter for every survivor item.
---
By far the most interesting and accurate comment I've had on this thread. Thanks for sharing your point of view :) !
---
Here's the thing: Being stealthy all game is detrimental to your team overall. Everybody should be distracting the killer to create openings to do objectives.
---
I can't wait for the tons more basement camping killers now that the new tome has 2 basement related challenges that promote it.
---
Haha I still have a special love for him too
---
THEY‚ÄôRE GIVIN‚Äô YOU FREE BLOODPOINTS BROTHER
---
IVE DIED SO MANY TIMES TRYING TO ESCAPE THROUGH THE HATCH BECAUSE MY TEAMATES WONT LEAVE
---
I'll play whatever game I want, thanks.
---
Your answer brings nothing more that I've already stated.
---
Indirect iron will nerf.
---
STOP USING VPN AS A KILLER
---
mostly tattoos i‚Äôve done but i defenetly have some digital art in there too
---
They out?
---
Not killer specific, but most killers I've seen around green-purple ranks run at least 3 of the following: Ruin, Nurse's Calling, BBQ, and/or Pop Goes the Weasel
---
Your point about skill checks spawning at anytime isn't completely correct. The game has a small buffer before skill checks can appear(it lasts about 1 second or until the "pop"sound that plays when you start a gen). This is the entire point of gen tapping, you can avoid 100% of the skill checks (except overcharge checks, which ignore the buffer).
---
I need this but like the logo of dbd that would be dope looking
---
okay boringGenericUser
---
Use a key with blood amber, and maybe open handed or streetwise if you want to get more out of it. Should help you avoid the killer.
---
If you injure someone using Feral Frenzy that means Sloppy Butcher won't apply? That is some bullshit nerfing right there. I've been using Sloppy Butcher with The Legion for a while because it complimented their power to well.
---
NO THEY ARENT WHEN I APPROACH THEM THEY JUST TEABAG AND LEAVE
---
If you watch frame by frame you literally spun into the attack
---
&gt;Except you don't do anything to counter them! Not once they're good enough.
---
Hmm its almost like playing any killer besides spirit or nurse against a good team.
---
Oh you‚Äôre back. Noice work
---
Does anyone have any tips for getting flashlight saves? I have 30+ days on this game and I have never gotten a flashlight save. It‚Äôs never been an issue before because I don‚Äôt tend to use flashlights but now with the archive challenges requiring it I need to learn. I‚Äôve been trying for over a week now for this one challenge and I just can‚Äôt do it. I never seem to be in the right position for it, and when I am, I usually get spotted and killed or the flashlight doesn‚Äôt blind them at all It‚Äôs not an issue with the timing as such because I‚Äôve seen videos explaining when to aim etc, but the flashlight just doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything at all. Like the beam doesn‚Äôt narrow at all, it‚Äôs just a wide beam of light that doesn‚Äôt do anything. 
---
So can anyone help with how to get in position etc. Should I just be following injured people around in the hopes that they get downed? And are there any addons that are useful for getting flashlight saves? I don‚Äôt really understand what the flashlight addons do.
---
Resilience, especially since it's only used when injured.
---
YEAH I HATE THAT TOO BROTHER
---
imagine thinking self-care is good when you have to dedicate 2 perk slots and an item to classify it as worth it.
---
Botany itself is already good enough and is more beneficial to the whole team and not just yourself.
---
god i hate when this happens. I was looking for 2 survivors for 20 minutes with 2 gens left to fix. Turns out they were camping by the hatch in lockers.
---
Ah yes so I can hit a survivor and wait out a DS timer
---
NIIICE-ly done. lol Camping prick.
---
That doesn't change my argument, because 1) i've still seen other items than toolboxes used and 2) they're not op.
---
From a min/max BP farming perspective - it makes sense to not actually claim the rewards until the blood harvest event on January 2nd, right?  The rewards from level 1 were doubled during the Halloween blood harvest event if I remember correctly.
---
If they implement this, I'll just face camp with mah chainsaw revved the whole minute.
---
SURVIVORS ARE THE WORST BROTHER
---
When he first got a buff a while back survivors complained he had no counterplay a year later you all make memes like this about it, Shows you should adapt not complain.
---
Now everybody / just follow me
---
Cause we need a little / controversy
---
And it feels less toxic / without me
---
EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU ARE AT PURPLE/RED RANKS. AT THAT POINT, YOU WILL ALMOST NEVER FACE ANY SURVIVOR LOWER THAN PURPLE RANKS, AND GOOD FUCKING LUCK GETTING YOUR ADEPT AGAINST THIS KIND OF TEAMS. 
---
OH, AND IF YOU ACTUALLY WANNA GET IT ON A LOW TIER KILLER, LIKE DOCTOR OR CLOWN, YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF WITH A RUSTY NAIL, IT'S GONNA BE WAY LESS PAINFUL THAN TRYING TO GET THAT SHIT.
---
I'm stating something so I'm "bitching". Ok.
---
Wow, these are a joke compared to level 3.
---
&gt; just that survivor is always 10 times harder.
---
No it's not. Most of them are easy
---
It‚Äôs easier to deal with on The Game because of the long lines of site than Lerys. Just pay attention  and stay close to areas with decent loops. They will not engage in the chase if they are good.
---
5%? Thats a real lot
---
excuse me, what? her animation has ended at that moment if you watch frame by frame.
---
I get what you mean. I perhaps should have said I‚Äôm some one with 2.5k hours into the game. It‚Äôs like when a doctor lunges for a hit and you can clearly see him whiff by about 4-6 feet and you are surprised because wham he has hit you. That‚Äôs basically what‚Äôs happening
---
The key part is "FINISH REPAIRING". You just have to be on the genny when it pops.
---
Petition to make Johnny Bartlett the next killer.
---
&gt; Survivor challenges take like 5 at least.
---
I mean, it has to be this way because there are 4 survivors in each match with the same overall goals. This doesn't mean it's "10x harder" it just means it's grindier
---
yep! im on xbox not sure if that matters
---
Firstly, I did give a reason. I dismissed it because it‚Äôs a bad idea. It‚Äôs that simple
---
Secondly, if you‚Äôre as good as you say, you should know why your idea is bad.
---
&gt; why make challenges that can literally not be completed in a normal circumstance?
---
almost all of them can be though. are any of you saying this shit even reading them?
---
that's utterly false
---
ITS SOO CUTE RIGHT the jingles are amazing
---
YES!!!!!!
---
How many kills would you say you average against a swf
---
The worst part is one game I got downed at the very end, but not hooked. I was crawling away while the last guy got hooked, hoping to find the hatch when it spawned. Unfortunately the hatch spawned right where I had gone down, but I had already crawled too far away! When the killer closed it right in front of me a part of me died.
---
Not sure! Iwould liek to test and see if killer or other survivors  can hear the jingles
---
Why do I have to take broken shit to have a potential chance to counter another broken shit?
---
At least one of them only requires basement *hooks* but... yeah I can't wait for all the Killers who camp if a Survivor is on second hook in the basement.
---
That‚Äôs just how it is in Dead by daylight. This will never change
---
I thought the challenge was ‚Äúcomplete 5 generators while all other survivors are hooked in the basement with insidious camping NOED Bubba and save them using the perk dark sense. Must unhook them safely without borrowed time. Must be done with 10 seconds of end game collapse in a single trial‚Äù
---
Intentionally obtuse, or actually that stupid with no reading comprehension whatsoever. Who knows at this point.
---
It has to be in public games.
---
its suppose to be a "casual" game...not everyone has the mindset to play the game like they will make it into a job and skill check desync is a thing...
---
UPDATE: There are also little jingles as you are being carried by the killer
---
Have you seen college tuition costs along with how expensive it is to live alone in college now? Wild how people still think you should move out right as you hit 18.
---
Half are ok and could be left as is.
---
I really hate challenges like this. you either need to get really lucky or play like an ass to get it.
---
4 basement sacrifices and 5 basement hooks would never happen in a normal game.  I think I may have done 4 gens in one match once in my DBD career.  It's extremely farfetched to believe it could happen, even with brand new part and fast tool box.  4 pallet stuns seems hard unless you're the first one to grab killers aggro.  The same generator 4 times I suppose is somewhat possible.  6 bear traps seems questionable but I think could be doable on certain maps.
---
Inner Strength + Detective‚Äôs Hunch gang rise up
---
You don't have to take it seriously to practice. You can practice just by playing normally.
---
Was gonna say the same thing... Until I watched more than 8 seconds of the video.
---
New players learn the game quickly, most people play with a swf group. Nobody stays a noob for long, because the game has a very shallow learning curve.
---
Ohhh, that huntress might have been me i use those exact cosmetics
---
Like, I said: almost all of them. not all of them.
---
I mean, they have to have *some* that are challenging and get you to play differently.
---
CAN WE PLEASE HAVE THE OPTION TO SKIP OVER CHALLENGES WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETE????? I CAN'T FLASHLIGHT BLIND TO SAVE MY FUCKING LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---

---
Talking about double standards
---
[YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA COMPLAIN ABOUT SO ILL SAVE THE EFFORT](/intensifies)
---
Devs seem to be waffling on whether it will stay this way. Personally, I think that any source of DC should be punished since the other four players are having their match messed up, regardless of why the DC happens.
---
If you can't play games consistently enough that you start getting serious penalties, you should probably find a different game to play.
---
Well its been proven to take longer that actually doing the gen, so im fine with that.
---
They could also have not been hooked because it was beneficial to the killer via obsession perks not to do so, that would potentially be unfair to killer as well since they were optimally using their perks.
---
Kinky
---
I used to think hitting people while they're hooked would make them die faster. I still cringe remembering about it sometimes
---
how can i kill someone so cute?
---
Ah, you're still on that "I'm on my alt" thing, huh?
---
That's me every time I find the group of survivors near a hook while Make Your Choice is activated
---
well your name tag asks for it
---
like, a neon logo?
---
or fewer players that are actually new play Dwight anymore, it‚Äôs more Claudettes and Fengs or licensed characters that people bought the game for
---
Okay Mememaker13
---
Well that level of gen camping is going to lose you the game, and with 4 survivors working on gens it's way too easy for 3 of them to finish at least 2 without you being around
---
alot of ppl do it and it works 'nough said
---
I saw something that said they're doing one for each killer and survivor. If that's the case then its guaranteed you'll have trapper anyway
---
I meant it as in they never release skins or as with the ghostface dlc there was no woods borough map for whatever reason I just they are picky as fuck when I said hard on for licence killers I didn't mean it as they love it because a hard on isn't always a good thing like striking one in public
---
Shirtless David gang, rise up
---
Most times i can find them by theyr sound but lately i think its glitched out where they barely do any sound even without iron will. Making finding them almost impossible
---
You have the right to feel the way you do towards immersed players, but talking about "a fucking cancer" is not what I call respectful.  
---
I think people see "Immersed" as a dwight running as soon as he hears a leaf falling, doing nothing but hiding.  
---
I might have used the wrong term then.  
---
"Immersed" to me was more like roleplaying the character you chose, but still doing gens and helping others to get out ! However, this game clearly is not to be won that way. Pallet looping is the only thing you can do to truly help your team out, and I find this lack of variety in the gameplay pretty asceptic.  
---
I talked about hide and seek as an opposition to the "Look, I'm here, catch me if you can" style of play.
---
LOL you are talking to a GEN Y who lived through the 2008 recession when the stock market was complete shit and there was no jobs...kid...give me a fking break
---
It‚Äôs suppose to be based around trapper and Claudette lore. Everyone has the same challenges
---
Ok well what type of fire crackers &gt;:(
---
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

---
I realised everyone had the same changes but didnt realise they were actually character specific.
---
Commenting to look back at this later
---
This game is populated with high ranks, middle ranks, and low ranks. For high rank games, that's something known by everyone. Medium ranks have some who know it and others who don't. For low ranks, no one knows that. You can't generalize the high ranks for the entire game. You have to find the highs and the lows, create a mechanic that can work in favor for both, and implement it
---
that completely counters the entire point you made initially................some ppl who have play this game only and have thousands of hours still cant hit skill checks...so thats an invalid point
---
What if the stealthy person was doing objective tho
---
No need to report since DCs are tracked and punished automatically. I just ignore them and keep going, maybe give the last person or two a free escape if they seems like they were genuinely trying despite being abandoned by their team mates.
---
Master challenge: Hook 4 survivors in a basement
---
Also Master challenge: Just escape with Claudette I guess
---
I haven't gotten past the first one because I hate playing claudette and so I gave up with it lmao
---
No it doesn't. It doesn't counter my point at all. What are you on about?
---
If Oni or Spirit swing their katana and hit a rock or wall it should shatter into a million pieces
---
So what would the killer's counter be to this 4%? Say if the survivor was hooked near the exit gate, gets off the hook, killer hits and downs them. Then killer has to wait the 60 seconds, which might be enough time to escape. What perks or move do killers get to counter that? There might not have been any hooks within range to hook the survivor, so why should that person get a 4% chance to escape, while leaving the killer a 0% chance of having any sort of counter? I see 0 reason to give a survivor the chance to RNG escape because of some perk they might have if the killer has no real counter to the other perks the survivor might be using.
---
That's why I played a game as legion and I was able to get 25 hits (don't know if my powered actually counted to it or not)
---
Okay then why are you bitching? 2 kills is considered balanced. I don't play killer often lol.
---
Lmao
---
The maps need to be more randomly generated imo
---
This just in!
---
Angry tf2 elf scout mains convert to DbD! All are very angry because their elf Dwight outfit keeps jingling away their position to the killer!
---
I was, but one followed me around, so i just put them out of their misery. They hook suicided almost instantly. The fourth guy got out without me seeing him go.
---
if you want it over with, just approach the survivors and put your trap down.  If they don't catch on, knock them then pick them up and drop them until they're free.  Most survs will help with the challenge
---
That perk pack is really cool, wish we could have them on PS4
---
Well thanks for sharing your opinion then, we might differ a little but I think I'd prefer the patrolling and search kind of play which, and I think wie both agree, does not fit to the actual gameplay :)
---
But also by that time it is literally just the killer versus the survivor. It's a simple 1v1. Most of the time, the killer will probably win because the survivor no longer has teammates to help. Even if it's a detriment to their perks, the killer could still easily use their power and/or brain to catch the survivor
---
Shes a keeper
---
SC/BK half your build right there. Also--- finding totems prevents noed, and isn't really that hard when you know your way around maps.
---
Can‚Äôt speak for everyone but I will farm for most of the killer ones. The survivor ones are kinda ok. Not sure how I‚Äôll go about completing 4 gens but I guess I‚Äôm gonna look for a swf to do it with
---
You don‚Äôt have to play as claudette to get past the tome lol
---
Oh yeah, if they want out, I'll give it to them easy. Just hit a gen or two so that they know they could farm if they want first.
---
I watched every frame. It checks out. Her swing hurt box was still active. Reminder that they changed her recently so there‚Äôs nothing wrong with nurse here.
---
I FUCKING HATE WHEN SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO ME EVERYONE DISMISSES IT AND TELL ME TO STAY CALM AS IF  THINGS CANT AFFECT ME OR THAT IT WAS MY FAULT CAUSE I DIDNT TOOK ENOUGH PRECAUTIONS.
---
BAD SHIT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND ITS NORMAL FOR ONE TO FEEL BAD ABOUT IT, STOP MINIMIZING IT LIKE ITS NOTHING.
---
Got it. Thanks for the tip!
---
Okay and ALL you have to do is get kills.
---
To bad killers don't :(
---
the survivor can get the hatch, its fair game when its a 1v1
---
Sure survivors CAN still win with 1 DC, but their odds literally get cut in half. To suggest that every survivor should just tough it out isn't fair to the average player.
---
Whoops my bad. But still helps
---
You ran into it at the very last second as hitboxes have to be slightly larger or it would almost be impossible to hit anything. A lot of games do this so you can still hit stuff you just got unlucky that you turned at the last second into the hit
---
You can‚Äôt criticise killers for camping during the end game collapse
---
No but need claudette perks that I dont have as teachable
---
And the killer could just as easily close it
---
Lithe though.
---
These stats do no count: thrown games, DC and suicide which are a very common reason that survivors lose. In a normal match, where survivors are playing in a team or at least understand what they need to do and don't make silly mistakes will always have the upper hand.
---
"Pretend keys are overpowered" I don't need to pretend that something is overpowered when it actually is. Keys currently have no viable counterplay (Franklin is countered by plunderer's) and if a survivor has a key oriented build, the only way to not let him escape is to tunnel or camp him so he won't have a chance to use it (but hey, camping is w r o n g and good killers do not camp, they always 4k on 5 gens no matter what team they are facing).
---
I played ~1000 hrs on survivors, half solo, reached rank 1 almost every month and I do realize how strong survivors are, especially in SWF, even in duo. Survivors still possess enormous amount of second chance perks and tools to end game faster (toolboxes, keys).
---
"Stop looking for a nerf" no I won't, because many things in survivors are still broken. I am not talking about killers' nerfs here only because this is not the topic of the discussion, however I do agree that some killers' perks or addons need to be changed. Survivors have been overpowered since the beginning and their nerfs since 1.0.0 are all justified with a few exceptions (if you think they were not, then I have bad news for you, my biased friend). Keys are one of a few things that remained unchanged since 2016 (better say "not nerfed" as they were buffed in 2.7.0), so they must be changed.
---
Sometimes I just leave them to bleed out on the ground if I dont think I can make it to a hook before they wiggle through or if I think they have decisive strike
---
yup :\\  for all the shit killer mains give surv mains, survivors are a lot better at helping with challenges in my experience
---
Bubba is better than lLegion
---
Well all I can say is I‚Äôm glad this is just a fun concept and not actual perks being implemented into the game
---
What about the average killer by that logic? You've allowed them to be punished for doing well, one DC means everyone else can bail and they can't continue.
---
I only use map when I get it from a crate lol and it's usually to look for another crate with better loot haha
---
Oh yeah I agree
---
I mean it's 5 basement hooks in a single match, no way most killers aren't just gonna proxy around the basement all match for it.
---
I just hope we don't keep getting challenges like this in future tomes because they just promote really dumb gameplay.
---
and the survivor could have/find a key or could just wait at the gate to open it once the hatch is closed like everyone at higher ranks does
---
It‚Äôs worth a shot. Why waste all your time on hook when you could have a chance at escaping by giving the ol‚Äô tug?
---
BHVR: omg! people LOVE this Kate outfit! Let's resell it but on an even MORE popular character!
---
Is double damage just an insta down or what? Does he score a critical hit on the survivor
---
It‚Äôs not the size of the blade, it‚Äôs how you use it
---
Yes like tier 3 Michael
---
But the killer will just stand there and down them immediatly anyway
---
Tbf you can't farm unless the killers wants you to, so you can't just walk up to a killer and expect a good time
---
I never have a problem with noed because I'm a bp thirsty whore and will do all totems myself
---
Oooh I see. Why not just play normally and put the bloodpoints into claudette?
---
It still makes killer waste his time and resources on downing you. And in some situations he cannot pick you up while you crawl out to the exit. It is not okay.
---
yes, pls join us we need more friends :D
---
Except when I‚Äôm playing killer.
---
The problem is, all those situations would hobble a survivor with dead hard or sprint burst too, so I don't think they count. Poor positioning isn't really the perk's fault. 
---
It's far easier to manage exhaustion with Lithe than sprint burst, and I'm yet to come across a perk that lets me get between loops as consistently as Lithe. It's just great, and for me the best exhaustion perk after balanced landing got taken out behind the shed.
---
Those quotes are top notch
---
Lol, it is way more than 1 or 2 dickhead survivors.  I've seen entire circlejerks on this sub making fun of killers who get mad at survivors for teabagging full of people agreeing with the sentiment.  I'd say survivors have more than lost the right to get mad at people for teabagging them when it is MUUUUUUCH more prevalent on their side.
---
Tbf that's a good point
---
i apreaciate it dude. i mean her animation really lookes like it ended hmm
---
That‚Äôs a fun idea, I‚Äôll perhaps give it a try !
---
If the killer looks in the hook‚Äôs direction and sees some scratchmarks, you can bet your ass he‚Äôs gonna know I‚Äôm hiding nearby, waiting for him to go away.
---
This gives the killer no reason to leave the survivor if there aren‚Äôt any other injured or hooks survivors at the moment, and thus gives them a reason to camp, all because I felt impatient and wanted to rescue you faster than needed.
---
True but at least we aren't one of the most searched porn result!
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt see a rule book on what you can‚Äôt or can‚Äôt say on the internet lol. Anyways, I‚Äôm more of a Huntress kind of guy. Like ma‚Äôam let me dive into that feral pussy üòõ
---
Your submission to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots. 
---
Well while that's unfortunate for them, 3 other players are having a bad experience compared to 1 player having a good experience. They could also offer BP incentives to make it fair, and encourage survivors to stay.
---
Make it where as long as the killer is 32 meters away their timer goes down faster and skip the struggle stage altogether.
---
Got in 2 games earlier against elf dwights, far as I can tell their silent on killer side
---
Why do his groans sound like Freddie‚Äôs laugh...
---
23 seconds off an 80 second generator is pretty OP. For reference BNP shaves off 20 seconds and it's an ultra rare add on. Just socket swivels, a clean rag, and a brown toolbox, or even yellow green or purple for the lols.
---
OP: *makes a silly veggie tales meme for DBD*
---
You: *Assumes he's bitching about D-strike being overpowered for since reason*
---
So does trapper‚Äôs yet the hitbox is still active late into the swing. All killers have this... situation I‚Äôll call it.
---
It depends on how you run the loop, and whether you can manage exhaustion correctly. It's usually not the end of the world to simply head for another time early and come back around to your current position later, every step wastes a killer's time after all. Having said that I'll be trying out this sprint burst tactic, could be fun.
---
Killing 4 survivors in the basement is absurdly hard, you may kill 1 maybe 2 but as soon as survivors realize you running a basement build stay the hell away from the basement as soon as a chase starts
---
Then that's the killers fault for not focusing the survivor with the key, or leaving the survivor alone long enough to find a key. The whole point of a game mechanic is that it's balanced and useful for both sides. The survivor has many chances and so does the killer. It's all about decisions. We can sit here and go back and forth all day, but there's no one will win simply because of the amount of decisions either side could make to give them the advantage.
---
That‚Äôs probably true. Still Franklin‚Äôs is by no means an asshole perk to run. It just negates a luxury survivors have that killers don‚Äôt get.
---
I know but that's the same for killers.  In my experience playing both, more survs I go up to are willing to help than killers.  I always thank survs for the help.  When I message killers, they always say "I'm killer, my job is to kill."  I get it if you don't want to farm.  It's fine.  Surv players are nicer imo
---
And those games are actually balanced.
---
absolutely based
---
I mainly use legion so whenever I get matched with them as a survivor I'd be a good sport about their power. I had a match where this legion is continuosly making us mend because of how close the gates are. Although he got 0 kills, i told him he did great pressuring us cause i can relate to his gameplay.
---
My new thing on legion is using the green pin addon with blood echo, it's worked out nicely so far
---
I still highly disagree, especially since 3 other players having a bad experience seems like grossly over-generalizing. Plenty of matches with just 3 people work out in their favor. Your system suggestions cost more than they add, and just promote more matches being tossed out the window. Since people already complain about queue times and people abandoning matches, this solves nothing.
---
Oh right, my bad for not setting a timer every time somebody gets unhooked.
---
&gt; If this change ever gets introduced, killers will make sure to slug the final survivor and close hatch first, making it worthless.
---
Which, assuming you are correct that *all killers do this*, it means that what you describe as a almost statistical anomaly chance of happening would have changed the meta completely. 
---
It will also bring value to Unbreakable (and No Mither but that's a completely different can of worms) as if the killer slugs you and walks off for the hatch thinking you have DS when you don't, you have a chance to make a break for it.
---
It also doesn't *require* you to bring Plunderer's, survivors are welcome to suicide 96% of the time and die on the hook like they already do, today, but tangentially it would improve the value of Plunderer's to those that do choose to bring it.
---
No offense, but that meme is pretty obvious imo. Quote: ''Haha yes, die trash''. He's obviously talking about his friend, but w/e, this meme is definitley no repost, it's just a meme with the same pic in it, but even if the same story probably not intended.
---
Amazing
---
what's wrong with having half your build dedicated to healing? if you can loop and are generally good at the game a Survivor doesn't even need perks.
---
It is if you've already won it. There shouldn't be a 4% chance to just lose progress you've already made when the game is over. That's like having a 4% chance a Gen breaks after its been repaired.
---
Why ‚Äúhe?‚Äù Women players won‚Äôt get this chance ;;;) ? Hahaha, I‚Äôm kidding here but you can totally use ‚Äúthey‚Äù in this situation too. We do it all the time in the English language so it‚Äôs not hard to give it an effort.
---
Its boring for the other people.
---
The person on the hook cant move nor participate. They aren‚Äôt playing at this point they‚Äôre just spectating, knowing that the moment they‚Äôre unhooked they‚Äôll be put right back on the hook.
---
The other survivors are left to hold M1 on a gen with nothing else to do, no chase, no suspense, nothing. They also feel bad for the player whose left to be camped out since they dont get to play and on top if they leave them on the hook they take a hit to altruism points. Or they unhook at which point the sad case camping gets what he wants.
---
Its dull. Nobody likes camping in any game.
---
Agreed even if he's already been hooked once
---
Except there's also 5 generators. So even if all 4 shaved that time there would still be plenty of time on each generator that would need to be done. Then take in to effect the fact there's a nut job running around trying to kill you. Plus not everyone succeeds skill checks with BNP, let alone standard skill checks. All the variables come in to play. So no, not OP.
---
They could have found the key after the hatch was closed or pulled it off a teammates body, I never carry my key on me when I bring it in, I just drop it somewhere I know wont be found and that I'll remember. 
---
Either way, endgame is more than fair game for the survivor, they used to have to have done 2 gens atleast before they could get the hatch. Now everyone can die in the first minute of the game and they can escape.
---
Disagree with that one, if they got hooked already, that‚Äôs a rip
---
What is the point of killer running at you, and you don‚Äôt care about it at all....
---
I am sure Chaisaw billy is scary as hell when he rushes towards you from the distance. Survivors, hence, must always be afraid of getting hit, or else it is not a horror game anymore, and more of ‚Äútag-and-loop‚Äù, which is destructive to both survivor and killer in-game experience. 
---
But it should be balanced, I agree. Question is how? Maybe make every legion cut apply stronger and stronger effect on the survivors for the rest of the game (permanently), but increase the CD of the ability drastically and/or reduce the duration extension. Also, make some penalty for tunneling one survivor (anything, really). 
---
Ex: First hits wounds and applied hemorrhage, second ‚Äî healing speed decrease, third ‚Äî altruistic speed penalty, forth ‚Äî repair speed cut. From fifth onward ‚Äî broken status effect. Sevenths ‚Äî complete bleed out (deep wound decaying no matter what). Etc. Again, can be balanced, but fulfills the fantasy of legion stabbing and stabbing multiple people multiple times in a row. 
---
The counter would be spreading out, so that legion applies less of its debuffs to the entire team, and is forced to eat harsh penalty of tries to tunnel that survivor with the frenzy power on... 
---
What do you say?
---
I think players who have Deliverance all ready for use should get a chance to use it even if they are the last ones. I‚Äôve had soooo many situations where my perk was wasted -.-
---
Stunning a killer 4 times in one match looks to be the only truly difficult one.
---
WHO THE HELL IS BOB AND WHY YOU WANT TO KISS HIM
---
My very first game I hid in a locker for like 30 mins as all my teammates died and the killer couldn‚Äôt find me :( pre endgame collapse. I remember thinking ‚Äòwow I‚Äôm so good at this game if the killer can‚Äôt find me!!‚Äô
---
"bullying me" and not "bullyhig him"
---
You can just say you made this shit meme.
---
We are both gonna be downvoted to hell for saying such things in public lol.
---
Thats true i guess
---
Why isn't he patrolling finished gens or checking open exit gates?
---
Just kill your self on hook then
---
Tnx man
---
There‚Äôs perks like ds, unbreakable, deliverance etc, I die on first hook a lot just because I‚Äôm the last person alive, meanwhile I always run deliverance so there was supposed to be a 100% chance of getting off, it‚Äôs ‚Äòsimply annoying‚Äô to people who need the 4% and or run deliv and don‚Äôt even get to use it
---
Yea but u have to be lucky enough to be near the gen when it pops and hope it‚Äôs not being used by Max number at any given time
---
But it's not generalizing. No survivor every has said "Wow, this DC makes the game even better!". 
---
Define "Plenty", because later time I checked a DC results in a 3 or 4 K most of the time.
---
You do realize the player who DCs still gets punished right? This idea is also just a concept, so numerous things would need to go into it to perfect it, you see the worst parts, I see the best parts, but at the end of the day the system is there to let players not have to sit through games they don't want to play. The fact is no player should have to sit though a game that was already "ruined" for them or face punishment.
---
100% true. Playing too stealthy leaves the killer free to patrol and apply gen pressure. Chases are what wastes killers time. Learn to loop and only hide when absolutely necessary.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I do. When I see them camping I just walk to them and get them to put me on hook to show I have no interest in playing with them. And not give them chase points
---
If killers get the choice to four man slug and waste everyone's time for up to five mins or more (can't even DC now!) then the last survivor on the hook should be allowed to waste 60 damn secs if they so choose...
---
You have a 4% chance to pull yourself off the hook during first state normally. If everyone else is dead then you immediately go into struggle then dead state, no chance to pull yourself off even though it's your first hook.
---
I actually like the new meg skin it‚Äôs cute
---
The stunning a killer 4 times in one trial is gonna be hard.
---
hahahaha u got it bro :D
---
mUst.. buY.. dWeeT skIn..
---
I did it with surveillance easily and won the match
---
The torso looks good the rest is garbage
---
I personally believe camping is ok and isn't that toxic especially during endgame collapse. Now this hillbilly deserved exactly what he got with the repeated chainsawing but that's my opinion. I myself don't camp ever because I can't sit still without getting bored, I gotta keep moving to entertain myself
---
Happy cake day :)
---
It‚Äôs good except for the hair. It would look so much better as a full head of hair, the half looks so good :(
---
The power doesnt sound like much fun to me, it rewards the killer for not ending the chase early but all in all fun concept.
---
Or just do the generators nearby and farm them off the hook with borrowed time before they hit struggle.  
---
It's not fun facing a camper but you can punish the hell out of them if you play smart.  Giving up like that just encourages them to keep camping because it worked on you.
---
sprint burst would of gotten you the distance earlier, and more effectively too. Dead hard can let you bait out the hit or greed for another loop with its distance.
---
And re:pallets, the same thing applys with the window situation but usually worse because unless its a god pallet your gonna wanna loop it until they break it anyway and if your vaulting the pallet, its usually an unsafe one anyway
---
Ah, the first week of survivor is a blur of panic and desperation. Good times.
---
remember the "fix 3 gens with dark sense"? now you have to do 4
---
I like that hair style tbh if they can pull it off makes her look young and care free and it‚Äôs not a sports outfit
---
very easy imo, easier than tome 3
---
I agree, and that's why I'm fine with having the chance to 4%! Cobbling together a meme build specifically for the Kobe would be cool, but the odds of any of this happening are infinitesimally small, so why would the Devs or survivors change it?
---
Unbreakable could be fun, but what are the chances of it still being active that late in the match? Once again what's the point of judging a perk around a situation this rare? It's a pretty thin argument. So far I've seen a list of 6 different perks that could maybe potentially once-in-a-while maybe do something, and deprive you of the chance to play any other build. 
---
Sure, a change in killer behaviour changes the game, but it's hardly a 'complete' shift in the meta, even if it were to happen every match. For the meta to change there has to be a noticeable effect, this is a small tactical change (that killers mostly already do) that directly counters the subject of this entire conversation. It's why Yui's new pallet-lifting perk is, and always will be, bad: if it ever gets popular enough to see significant use, killers will instantly break pallets and render the perk useless. A victim of its own success. 
---
I'm not attacking you or your idea, but why bother? If we're being honest this would be a waste of time, when there are far easier ways to make the game more satisfying.
---
Unless they nerfed it in the most recent change, it's 25%.
---
You have to tap the attack button, if you hold it it will cause you to lunge. Mostly timing.
---
true I do not think its a asshole thing. but ya just getting tired of ppl saying just do not teabag lol
---
Is it the Obsession?
---
Undead strength might be a little R rated for the game.
---
A pretty much seperate route for killer and survivor leading to the epilogue, forming an eye with some challenges in the middle.
---
Most of the challenges are pretty easy except for 4 in my opinion.
---
On the survivor route: Finish 4 gens in a single trial with Dark Sense.
---
On the killer route: Hook 5 survivors in the basement in a single trial.
---
And 2 optional for lore in the center: Kill everyone in the basement, catch 6 survivors in bear traps in a single trial.
---
The killer actually gets more of a win if they would get off and they hook him again, you get less emblems for killing him instantly without giving him 2 hooks. The killer has nothing to lose and a hook to gain if they get off.
---
Whole lot of farming üòä
---
give an outifit like this to everyone. sidecut leather jacket squad
---
R rated?
---
Holy shit XD just re read it
---
Watch good survivors stream idk what to tell you. Ur trash if you can't run a killer for the majority of the game (excluding nurse)
---
Lucky for you,  i dont deal with that shit anymore
---
Those are different situations - let's only bash Lithe if it deserves it shall we? All these perks fundamentally allow you to link loops together, that's how we should look at them. All I saw in the original comment was a mistake of positioning.
---
Totally agree with the pallet argument, but Lithe gives you another dimension which other perks don't. If you're at an unsafe pallet then lithe will make all the difference in a critical situation, and lithe would be powerful for the same reason people think adrenaline is good.
---
XD
---
Hope you still think that when every killer's running a basement build
---
You spelled "Voorhees" wrong. For shame.
---
Lol, I fully don‚Äôt understand this sensitivity in a game where we cut peoples finger off and suck on it
---
Love the idea of yeeting survivors at each other tho! Lmfao
---
The killer loses 2 minutes of his life. Nobody cares about emblems. I don't feel like standing in front of a guy and then over him when I could just be in another game. Just give last survivor points and be done with it.
---
Spicey, I like it!
---
Whoops oh well nothing I can do about it now
---
read what you said an hour ago
---
I thought that might be what it is, but other add-ons say that they increase the range of the flashlight. So I was just wondering if this was a typo from BHVR.
---
Exactly. You get more points from finding &amp; chasing than to just facecamp. It‚Äôs not productive for anyone &amp; punishes a survivor unnecessarily.
---
"hit a survivor with your weapon 25 times"
---
it's legion time lads
---
Yeah, DS is a huge part of this bundle.
---
Wraith I'll t'y next for sure
---
With the huntress I gave some survivors a pretty good time
---
because totems go down way to fast sometimes and its annoying
---
exactly
---
You can, it‚Äôs what I use
---
Glorious.
---
Killers who camp are number one on my shit list.
---
Killers who camp instead of trying to prevent exit I just feel bad for
---
Honestly, just fucking drop kick them right from the hook.
---
MAYBE THEY GAPED?
---
Well when you talk about winning, emblems are what give you pips toward winning and ranking up. What I would propose is that it auto attemps for you no matter what instead of killing you straight up. If they did this it would only add like 3 seconds unless they get off. And if they do get off the killer has a chance for extra hook points amd emblem progress.
---
thats so cute im happy it jingles üò≠üíñ
---
Nah, bloodhunts never increase dailies and I don‚Äôt remember them doing so for challenges
---
I absolutely can
---
go and try to prevent other survivors from escaping.
---
no get your respectfull depressed crap outta here im tryin to meme and have fun
---
With add-ons bubba in some cases is better but with no add-ons bubba is bad in a loop as his chainsaw slows him down so much it's easy to gain a good bit of distance by the time he starts his chainsaw
---
yea, its pathetic when killers do that
---
go search for other survivors and prevent them from escaping
---
You're bitching about totems, but also saying we don't HAVE to do them? So what is a skill check going to do? Make it so you can just camp the totem against people who can't deal with ruin?? What's that going to do? Oh I guess make it easier for killers right lol. If you're getting 3 to 4 kills MOST matches,  get the fuck over it. Some matches you WON'T win just like the survivors didn't when you killed 3 to 4 of them every match.
---
If Legion is hitting someone and then disconnecting, it might be a bug crashing their game.
---
No I meant what I said and if Mcote is there with us, then he is in hell as well... it was meant to be funny ha‚Äôha
---
The last 3 tomes haven‚Äôt been to bad and can agree a few are time consuming but most of them I got done on my first try. Ready for the 4th!
---
Sorry I‚Äôm deaf can you say that one more time?
---
You're literally bitching about totems going to fast,  but in the same breath want people to gen rush lolololol. I'm SOO confused by your weird ass logic.
---
...I have no comment
---
I don‚Äôt know or care who you are. You‚Äôre not important. Go away now.
---
Literally me in the game that place is a hell hole
---
&gt;Stop trying to push this narrative that 90% of the playerbase just needs to learn how to counter killers that essentially ignore any part of looping.
---
And there's your issue. You are facing Nurse and Spirit as though you are supposed to loop them. Which you are *NOT*. When you run from an M1 killer, your intention is to loop them forever. When you run from Spirit or Nurse, your intention should be to *get away from them*. A prolonged Spirit chase is just asking for trouble. 
---
If a killer ignores looping, *DON'T FUCKING LOOP THEM!!!!* Stealth is an option. Mindgaming an LOS blocker is an option. When you face a good Clown, you drop pallets and move on to the next one. You don't loop him. Why is Spirit any different? Oh, right, because she turns invisible and people who play video games don't have object permanence or any desire to adapt to a different mechanic.
---
Also, saying that the playerbase shouldn't learn to paly effectively vs a strong killer is stupid. If nuclear warfare were legal, the government would mandate that you learn to prepare for it. And you'd be the dumbass crying  "waahh, the entire country shouldn't have to prepare for something as blatantly overpowered as nuclear attacks!" Fucking moron, this is about killing people, of course I'm going to use whatever blatantly overpowered shit I want, So if you don't want to learn to beat me, it's going to keep working, and I'm going to keep doing it. Pretty vicious cycle, no? If you want Spirit to go away, make her lose more and she'll stop being played.
---
And this is coming from a survivor main, who has no issue facing Spirit at red ranks, *while running No Mither*. All because I miss feeling challenged by the killer. And that doesn't happen at red ranks because survivors actually carry themselves instead of being dead weight. So learn to play instead of pathetically bitching and moaning.
---
gotta love immersed claudettes they make it easier
---
Overwatch is an absolute hell hole, especially around high diamond/low masters. So many people who think they should be top 500 and it's just their team bringing them down.
---
And then the killer has to slug for 60 seconds because DS works on self unhooks. This change just sounds like it waste a bunch of time for no real benefit.
---
The frighteners great movie
---
Very easy.
---
Only the dark sense and basement challenges are annoying.
---
EVERY SINGKE ONE OF US HAS RUN BABY SITTER FOR A FEW MATCHES, REALIZED IT WAS TRASH, AND SWAPPED IT BACK WITH ONE OF OUR STANDARD PERKS.  NO ONE HAS REACHED DOUBLE DIGIT TRIALS WITH THAT PERK.
---

---
This is reddit, lad. I go where I please, and I do as I please. Don't like it? Too bad.
---
And you sure seemed to care who I was 'bout an hour ago!
---
I still don't understand what you're saying. Nothing I've said has countered anything else I've said.
---
Yeah a lot of people will tell you not to stalk but it's not smart to go in only expecting to use half a power. If you see a good opportunity then you should stalk, as I said above it's only 2.5 seconds when leaning. If you have time and opportunity then you should definitely do it. 
---
The playstyle people are recommending above is effective but if you don't have the addons you're waiting 30 seconds for your power to come back. I rarely use addons and if you're relying on addons then you're not effectively learning the killer but either way play how you will and enjoy. He's fun.
---
-2 points for the revenge teabags,
---
Whether or not it was deserved.
---
THAT WAS ME RUNNING SMALL GAME, HOME BOY.  NOTHING I LOVE MORE THAN A SUB-MINUTE RUIN CLEANSE.  I LITERALLY LEAP FOR JOY IF IT IS FOLLOWED BY A SWIFT KILLER D/C!
---
AKA the "fuck your hooks, bitch" build. Probably better with No Mither though, so if they decide to slug you you just keep getting back up.
---
I just like the idea of having a last chance. especially when you use 1/4 perk slots for deliverance, save it for a clutch moment, and then you can‚Äôt even use it.
---
I VOLUNTEER TO BE THE RECIPIENT OF THAT LETTER.
---
I AM LONELY
---
lol...you dont understand the obv point and trying to twist it. The point is hexs most of the time get raped in 5 secs because they are not well hidden and sometimes spawn right by survivors...and that is bullshit...thats like me spawning right by a survivor and downing them within 5 secs because they got bad spawn placement. a hex totem being destroyed almost right when the game starts can be the diff between a 3k and a 4k....so yea
---
‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢
---
Once again, ignoring hard evidence that a player playing those killers to even over half of their potential destroys any team. That nuclear warfare example is dumb asf considering nuclear warfare and other means of mass destruction is either outlawed or heavily discouraged because of the damage it can cause.
---
You're not no god for "beating" Spirits at red ranks. Red ranks is a fucking joke for survivor because all you have to do is about 2 gens, 2 unhooks and be in chase for about a minute throughout the whole game. 
---
Killers can rank up by using Legion or Wraith to abuse the emblems system and then switch to killers that are higher tier once they reach a point those killers won't get them pips without the skill to back it up. 
---
Almost the whole community and BHVR agree that Spirit is/was in a bad spot. But sure, stroke your e-penis some more but acting like your Rambo as survivor.
---
IMO its not about changing the outcome of the game, it simply feels bad, the hooks are designed so that you have a chance to get off +time for someone else to get you off, theres no lore related reason for you to get killed immediately on the hook at any time
---
See this is a good idea if the game launched with this, i prefer my survivors being skins since i can just switch between them and play who i want without having their ability or stats being dog shit.
---
The cosmetics descriptions are perfect! Id be so hyped for this
---
his power is bassicaly old STBFL.
---
The mechanics aren‚Äôt dumb. It now consistently is abuse-proof. 
---
But it is weak as shit and needs buffed.
---
Nicely done
---
THERE IS NO JOY TO BE HAD IN RED RANKS.
---
Well they dont have to be dogshit we can make them all good
---
Especially with Deliverance it wont go off if your the last survivor and have never been hooked
---
I had no idea that existed lol
---
As a killer main let‚Äôs not make survivors overpowered please and thank you.
---
Yes the game is centered around chases. But you‚Äôre saying they take 1+ minutes and I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs an exaggeration. 
---
I play in US Midwest. Maybe there is a large gap between US and EU survivors. Definitely possible. My only exposure to EU survivors are from watching True‚Äôs streams but I didn‚Äôt notice a huge difference. Granted I stopped watching a while back because he kept complaining about playing a perfect game and still losing but any decent killer could point out a dozen mistakes on his end. Plus most of his games went on for 10+ minutes and this was back when DS was still busted.
---
Idk what to tell you. A coordinated SWF is maybe 1/10 games for me. Sometimes there‚Äôs just a few really strong survivors but unless there‚Äôs like 3 of them, it‚Äôs not really a big deal. Mostly games are just straightforward enough for a 3-4k for me.
---
Just run Iron Maiden lol
---
&gt;I think everyone can agree the survivors should all be unique and not just skins
---
Nope. Let me carry on playing who I want to play because of how they look rather than choosing based on stats.
---
Many thanks Mr. Beard
---
I DIDNT REALIZE YOU ONLY HAD 1 PERK AT THE TIME I WAS RUNNING OUT MY FLASHLIGHT BATTERY ON YOUR FOREHEAD.
---
ctrl shift esc bruh
---
Umm,  I have spawned right beside the killer lolololol. Maybe not RIGHT next too, but around the corner to have a Ghostface on my ass not even 30 seconds into the match. Also you're NOT SUPPOSED to get 4ks EVERY game. Quit being entitled and thinking you're supposed to kill everyone every match,  it may be your job to kill but it's ours survive. I cannot believe you are dead ass crying for totems to have a skill checks because sometimes you don't get a 4k lolololol. Wow.
---
If doing something like this makes them op we can always buff the killers, i just dont like how repetitive the survivor role feels.
---
yea it was pretty trash lmao, but i like ur considering Jason in the game, he desirves a spot here.
---
And a Sabo toolbox
---
Why isn't this ingame? You basically proved my point.
---
In league it's automated, and works great.
---
Damnnnn
---
While dev time aint free (I'm a dev myself), and I don't want to make too many uneducated assumptions about the game logic, but back of the napkin, its really only disabling the logic that treats the last survivor being hooked any different, and allowing the normal game logic for hooking survivors to resolve. 
---
Most killers typically hook the last survivor then leave to go kick the hatch for bonus points, anyways, or just fuck around during the last sac if its already shut, I don't think such a change would drastically change how things play out today, other than the rare, "oh you little shit!" moment where the killer has to run back to try to catch them a 2nd time or race them to the hatch, which could be fun, and gives that survivor a little bit of hope (which the entity enjoys) and a few extra blood points for another chase, pallets, possible escape.
---
I do not agree that every survivor should be different.  They already have their own playstyle from their teachable perks and I think if you tie abilities and speed differences to each character, you would just create another meta system.
---
Plus these are some massive buffs you're attaching to them.  Dwight having a passive that's almost double the range of level 3 bond?  Meg getting another 2% run speed?  Get real man.
---
WAIT TIMES ARE TRASH. HIT BOXES ARE TRASH. IM SI TIRED OF THIS GAME BEING BROKEN, I WISH BHVR WOULD SELL THE RIGHTS TO A COMPANY THAT HAD COMMON SENSE.
---
We can make them all good
---
HONESTLY IF THEY CAN'T CHANGE THE TROPHIES THROUGH SONY AND REFUSE TO CHANGE THE RANKING SYSTEM WHY CAN'T THEY JUST TIE MERCILESS BACK TO A 4K AND MAKE THE DOUBLE PIP "PERFECT KILLER" BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO BE.
---
So survivors dont make any sounds injured?
---
Yeah he‚Äôs one of my favorite slashers along with Myers and ghostface so not to mention that the whole legal issue thing with the rights is close to resolve so we may see it in the near future
---
Discordance is quite good with GF, as well as Thrilling Tremors. While other people say not to stalk, I'd say you should creep up behind cover, and make sure the survivor doesnt know you're there, and then lean and stalk to exposed. It's really great to end chases before they even start.
---
HOW DO YOU GET 6 SURVIVORS IN TRAPS IN A SINGLE GAME WHEN EVERYONE D/CS SO MUCH ON PS4?
---
HOW DO YOU PALLET SLAM A KILLER 4 TIMES IN A SINGLE GAME WHEN EVERYONE D/CS DO MUCH ON PS4?
---
WHY DOES EVERYONE D/C SO MUCH ON PS4?
---
Yeah not sure what it would hurt
---
810k bp, the challenges arent that hard imo
---
Nah we will never get him, just like a winter event which we are not getting because they are trying to get dedicated servers going which was suppose to happen by end of summer, whatever this company is a joke and my Wallet is closed.... this game has turned into nothing but a cash grab with cosmetics and nothing else...
---
This doesn' have to be exactly what i said above it is just a concept we can balance them if there to weak or to op
---
OPTIMIZE CONSOLE ALREADY FUCK I JUST WANNA PLAY NURSE
---
Id rather have bug fixes and gameplay balance.
---
no keep being immersed i need a kill per game ya know
---
Yep ez survivor buff they are just op now get good baby killer
---
I don‚Äôt care what you do with your time. You do seem like a loser to me with nothing better to do, but like I said, you do what you want.
---
It's ok, sometimes I throw on baby dwight clothes and run straight so the killer can have some fun.
---
I would love to have save progression between xbox and switch, so *fingers crossed*
---
*Please stop bleeding on my couch*
---
I never said they dont make any sounds injured i just thought since jake has the iron will teachable he can be passively quieter than the other survivors.
---
Killer would get even more camping messages lol
---
Is it weird I actually want to run this and see how it goes? Seems like it makes you basically unstoppable if there isn't a hook within like 2 feet.
---
More like Jane wearing Laurie's outfit
---
if playing with such a build could be considered anything but the highest manifestation of insecurity, yes
---
No matter what you do, there will always be one survivor who's more optimal than the others and what if they decide that the character you play doesn't work well with how you play? 
---
Let's say your a Kate main and you like leading the killer out on long chases and stuff but (because of her lore) the Devs decide that her passives should be about giving back to the other survivors as a support. Now you either carry on playing her despite not being optimal or you abandon the character in favour of one who works better as a distraction/looper. It takes some of the choice away from the player.
---
It's been a know build but don't do no mither bc they'll never slug you
---
The all say ‚Äústay quiet while injured‚Äù.
---
Don't eat the eyeball!
---
You are basically giving every survivor an extra perk slot with this idea.  You gave Jake built in Iron Will, Dwight has a double range version of Bond, you gave Meg  a run speed boost AND Vigil for herself (even though it's a quentin perk) and claudette gets botany knowledge and improved self care.  
---
Just no man.
---
Agreed. I don‚Äôt really get the whole hate behind survivors tbagging in general. It never really affects me and I play killer all the time. The only time I ever really get mad is if the game glitches/lags and they get away with some bs because of it.
---
As if we'll even get that!
---
That's actually really awesome.
---
So is getting angry your default emotion when looking like a bit of a goof online?
---
But almost everything else is stupid easy
---
Not really they can all loop just some would be a little better at it.
---
can't wait! excited to hear spirit's chase music!
---
&gt; You do seem like a loser to me with nothing better to do
---
I dunno. Does having spare time make you a loser? Doesn't that make YOU a loser?
---
&gt; but like I said, you do what you want.
---
And I will. Good day to you.
---
the jacket is hot tbh
---
Already cant fuckin hear them anymore, so why make it harder
---
here comes the trapper better watch out for his traps
---
YOU. ARE. A. NEW. PLAYER. 
---
You will not have great games! You will lose A LOT. Quit whining!   Wait til you actually know how to loop and not miss hex ruin skill checks and you will change your mind.
---
Once again it is just an idea to make the survivors more unique it doesnt have to be balanced exactly like this
---
I would say only for deliverance..
---
So your saying if you get stabbed with a knife, it will do more damage than getting cut by a katana  that has been swung by a 7 foot tall muscular as fuck samurai
---
mmFuck yeah
---
wdym we already have him but just longer hair
---
Idk why you're being downvoted bc it's all 100 percent true and why I'm about the last person playing this game among my friends lol. 
---
When a killer complains about the state of the game the killer echo chamber stampedes the forums with nerf everything chants. but when a balanced unbiased complaint comes around you're told to play another game lol.
---
Your right, i didnt think about that it is a typo
---
[Perhaps](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/dy4ynv/ama_we_are_behaviour_interactive_the_devs_behind/f7yp4qd?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

If their internet went out, then 30 seconds won't matter as it takes longer than that to fix.  
---
If their internet is horrible, they shouldn't be playing team based multiplayer games.  
---
If their house is on fire, as already mentioned, a 30 sec ban should be the last thing on their minds.
---
Yup, no summer event, delayed Halloween event and now no winter event, no dedicated servers and the one for pc are garbage, a pos blood hunt at the beginning of the year and as always ON TIME COSMETIC DROPS!! 
---
I‚Äôm done spending anymore money on this game, it‚Äôs turned into nothing but a cash grab with broken shit and constant delays... this company is piss poorly managed...
---
yea cuz they didn't want to go stupid hard
---
why just stunned for few seconds? make the killer die if u do this
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking
---
Very disappointed this wasn‚Äôt clown in the Santa skin
---
I wish it was üò≠
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm saying
---
Yeah I guess that makes sense. Unbreakable also helps you make use of Flip Flop, but equally with No Mither they're forced not to slug you, which lets you make use of your main trait even better, VERY FAST WIGGLES. And after they figure out your build they'll just slug you every time. Seems like they both have their merits.
---
it's called you have no idea what youre doing
---
It's like post-game chat
---
Jazz hands
---
Spice up your perks then. You‚Äôre suggestions would make a lot of perks obsolete and, despite them seeming somewhat minor, would buff survivors like crazy. I mean some are already quieter than others, it‚Äôs just not measured in their info. The killer deserves a power because there is one of him versus four survivors. Really adding anything in terms of unique abilities to survivors would be too much and a huge shock to the game as a whole.
---
I‚Äôve been farming all the tome 4 killer challenges, so far I‚Äôve completed one each match.
---
When you go up against a plague, legion, or a stealthy killer with nurses/sloppy you're at an instant disadvantage. It's not a matter of being good at the game, but if you spend most of your time healing you're dead weight to your team.
---
As long as They fix the heartbeat,  I end up hearing the chase music before I know the killers coming.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Okay since you know that then don't point out one of the very few difficult ones to mislead and spook OP
---
That's the problem.
---
And I played a game as him this morning where I got pulled out of Night Shroud by someone hiding behind a pile of rocks. It's insanely inconsistent.
---
Boil over doesn't make you wiggle faster.
---
The chances of you not getting the sacrifice are so much lower than you finding and downing another survivor
---
Oh that was hot to watch.
---
But you‚Äôre more likely to depip
---
So many messages being deleted, most of the Q&amp;A is questions so obviously cherry picked. None of the pressing issues discussed
---
Teabag deserved
---
You might be right but i still think survivor gameplay needs to be changed in some way i find it super repetitive and stale
---
well it's a good thing I'm smart enough to know when to heal and when to just do a gen, darn this Killer that prevents healing sure has foiled my build what ever will I do
---
I WIN AS BUBBA BUT LOSE AS BILLY ALL THE TIME
---
Oh no no no no
---
PepeLaugh
---
Only piece that I bought üëå
---
Pipping matters not the BP.
---
First of all why would you patrol finished gens and secondly you‚Äôre more likely to lose the hooked survivor and get no kills
---
IT TAKES 10+ MINS TO JOIN A SURVIVOR MATCH.
---
KILLER MATCHES BEGIN INSTANTLY, AND MATCH MY LEVEL (12) WITH THREE LEVEL 3s AND A 2. 
---
[WHAT THE FUCK BHVR](/intensifies)
---
Man that sucks. Probably my favorite event to be honest. 
---
I don't care that there aren't any objectives, I just love the lobby music and festive atmosphere. I'm all for focusing on game health but it can't be that hard to just re-enable everything (lights, lobby, gifts in blood web etc.) 
---
Oh well.
---
We can balance them to the point there is no top tier characters and they all have the same power level
---
really? do you honestly think adding somthing like this would go smoothly? this is BHVR we are talking about. heres what will happen.
---
Update drops: 1 or 2 super OP survivors that break the game
---
the rest either help the killer or do next to nothing
---
That happens sometimes. It's much more common for survivors to pull you through solid walls
---
As a killer main I‚Äôve given so many survivors the left behind achievement, but have never gotten it myself. Sad days.
---
Imagine the hitbox
---
There's no way a killer would slug a no mither player unless there's another survivor right next to them.
---
Well should killer abilitys be removed since some players think a few of them are op?
---
I wish I was on my desktop instead of laptop, I would of recorded it. I managed to get behind him and  then he turned, we stared at eachother for a few seconds and then I got exposed. All in all it was funny but it seems like staring and facing my character at him never seems to work.
---
No, this would be way too strong
---
The word you are looking for is "toxicity"
---
We can always balance it, it doesnt have to stay like that
---
I guess No Mither really does hard counter Billy
---
I...didn't say it did? Perhaps I should've been a bit more clear, what I meant by "VERY FAST WIGGLES" was "you wiggle free very fast" which you do seeing as you can start off with base 50% wiggle bar.
---
Who do you think the next killer and survivor is going to be for the archives? I'm really curious to see how they flesh out stories for killers that have more backstory like huntress and the newer bois
---
&gt; i find it super repetitive and stale
---
Why should the game be changed to placate you? If you don't like it then don't play
---
They aren't going to give more of those...No updates until mid chapter guaranteed.
---
This is objectively less content not resources shifted!
---
Tru3 was right wraith top tier as you non believers can clearly see
---
Like how we have perfectly balanced killers right now with no clear best or worst?
---
they literally picked a person asking "why is the oni collecting blood orbs from hooked survivors?" lmao
---
yea, which is why I was saying the easiest way to probably do that would be to get some friends and have them 99% the gens and let you finish them
---
being stealthy all game = being a coward and hiding in a corner of the map and not doing gens or anything for 30 minutes
---
But if they put you back down (IE: you didn't wiggle), you're still stuck in "Dying" unless you have the Bill perk, right? Or am I missing something obvious?
---
But they are unique
---
I just did it and had no issue.
---
And the chances of finding another survivor and downing them are zero if you sit there and camp like a wimp.
---
The purpose of the game is to down all the survivors. If getting one as a participation trophy makes you happy go for it
---
If that was possible you wouldn‚Äôt just see spirits/nurses/Billy‚Äôs at rank 1 all the time
---
I hope his chase music will sound hectic, like you‚Äôre going insane from his shock attacks
---
FUCK YOU BHVR INTERACTIVE!! YOUR A PISS POORLY MANAGED COMPANY WITH CONSTANT DELAYS AND BROKEN SHIT AND THE ONLY THING THAT COMES OUT ON TIME IS YOUR CONSTANT COSMETICS, YOUR JUST HOLDING OUT YOUR GREEDY HAND! ALSO THANKS FOR NOT DOONG ANY EVENTS BECAUSE OF YOUR BS PROBLEMS WITH GETTING IN OVER YOUR STUPID FUCKING HEADS! 
---
KARMA A BITCH AND IT WILL COME BACK TO BITE YOU BHVR
---
Hahahaha well, I'm going to drop the game too
---
wow look at this public threat. watch out, bhvr you're doomed
---
I hope that killer sees this and goes and F's himself
---
THATS HOW IT WAS AT LAUNCH BUT THE EMBLEM CHANGES NEVER ACCOUNTED FOR THE ADEPT ACHIEVEMENTS SO NOW KILLERS GET TOTALLY FUCKED
---
I swear Adam needs an outfit in like the next 4-5 batches of cosmetics just to be on par with everyone else.
---
It doesnt need to be changed i just personally find the survivor role repetitive i just brought up an idea to make it less repetitive. None of the things i said need to go live
---
Whenever I'm survivor I can never break him out of stealth, whenever I play as him I get revealed from behind rocks/trees/jungle gyms.
---
I did it earlier as well with no issue.
---
If they fix something 2 more problems appear.
---
They are also constantly ruining "balance" with watering down every single mechanic in the game.
---
At least events were cool.
---
YES!!! OH YES NO MORE SAME CHASE MUSIC! WOOO!
---
Yeah, I saw a neat suggestion somewhere else on this sub where a survivor is given a few seconds to start struggling (so they don't just sit there for the full duration of 1st hook and waste the killers time) - it definitely would fit in with game logic to let you struggle.
---
They dont have to be that way though
---
I mean, that's not really always the case. Maybe for very low ranks and a bit of middle ranks, yes. In high ranks, you rarely see that. You can't always blame the low ranks. They're usually terrified of killers. Middle rankers can be scared too, but it's probably because they're usually not very good at the game
---
RIGHT! Like shit
---
How? There all skins
---
Yeah, or automatically DC so he doesn't get points
---
If you have deliverance why do you not take pressure off of someone that has been hooked multiple times?
---
That was my point. He has nothing else to do.
---
Also i am able to find Keys luckily in Chests as Survivor.
---
I can¬¥t luckily activate the Ability to Mori, i have to sacrifice Perk Slots
---
I haven't played him in a while since I am pretty bad with him and don't play killer as much. I've seen him get revealed in weird scenarios though, it just seems to never work when it should and works when it shouldn't lol
---
aight that's fair enough, but still I believe you benefit more from being bold than stealthy as a survivor
---
When you said "very fast wiggles" I thought you meant boil over made you wiggle faster, my bad.
---
Except it is possible
---
The Iron Maiden/BBQ combo is a nice one though.
---
Probably like the only way other than farming
---
WATCHING THIS DEV Q&amp;A IS SO FUCKING IRRITATING 
---
THEY DON‚ÄôT UNDERSTAND THE GAME AT ALL!! RUIN IS META BUT IT‚ÄôS NOT BECAUSE KILLERS LIKE THE FUCKING PERK!! GENS ARE TOO FAST!! FIX IT!! 
---
LET PEOPLE SEE THE RANKS OF OTHER SURVIVORS!! THAT WAS AN AMAZING ADDITION AND EVERYONE LOVED IT!! WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU ACTIVELY DENY YOUR PLAYERBASE THE THINGS THEY LIKE WHEN THEY HAVE ZERO NEGATIVE IMPACT!!!!
---
That's what makes them unique. The fact that they're different people with different personalities
---
Much easier than Level 3.
---
Fewer challenges, roughly half are Master Challenges, and most can be completed through normal gameplay.
---
That is what I call "JUSTICE" ! Wp good sir !
---
It's only repetitive if you make it so. Use different builds and strats
---
I'm still trying to get one. :(
---
Exactly and was looking forward to at least getting lights and the dope lobby music, but now nothing. But not_queen stated on stream a few ago that they will be focusing events around the tome bs now :( this game sucks
---
Eh, fair. The wording wasn't clear. Also Boil Over totally should do that. Definitely needs a buff, seeing as it's not useful outside of these meme builds.
---
So he can't use perks the developers placed in the game or he has a disorder?
---
They're only doing a double bloodpoint event the 2nd of January. No festive boxes this year. :/
---
I got it by merit of extreme paranoia. I hid at the first flash if Spine Chill, I avoided gens if the killer was nearby, and I unhooked nobody. My perk setup was Alert, Lithe, Spine Chill, and Inner Strength (though self care would work fine, I just didn't have it on that character). I also brought a skeleton key with blood amber, just in case I found the hatch before the Gates opened.
---
Sometimes  I wonder about some survivors  lol
---
I do use different builds, just no matter what build you use you will always end up holding m1 on a gen and pallet looping.
---
Pressing the same button over and over is just annoying as hell. Only a tiny amount of people would leave the screen and if they do, they likely would have DCed anyway.
---
It's all about decisions and who you're playing with. If you're bold and your other teammates are more stealthy, you'll just get tunneled all game because the killer doesn't have anyone else to leave to focus on. If you're bold with teammates who are bold as well, you have a much higher chance as survivor because the killer is forced to spread his attention to everyone.
---
Why save deliverance so long?
---
Because killers need a 4K to pip. If your team got steamrolled accept the death and move on. You already have a lucky hatch escape holy shit
---
Take your ps4 apart and clean the dust out of the fan i did this and my fan now sounds like a tesla.
---
well glad it worked for you. but for me it aint somehow wth
---
They only want money, they are making that very clear now... 
---
not_queen states that they will be focusing events more around the tomes now, but a delayed Halloween event and now no winter event for Christmas is bs.
---
I for one am very disappointed and am done spending anymore money on this game...
---
Those are big words for a company that‚Äôs too afraid of putting out another top tier killer as it is. If the majority of the community saw them properly balance killers so that they‚Äôre all equally viable at rank 1, then I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd have a lot more support. The reality is we already have such a rigid meta for killers because they aren‚Äôt equally balanced, so there‚Äôs literally going to be no way to implement unique abilities for survivors without also creating a survivor meta.
---
Another day,another example of psychotic killer mains action.
---
I object to very few of these, but most of all the Agitation and basement sacrifice ones. Agitation is annoying, but the four sac is bullshit as a master trial.
---
Even the bare minimum, it should have been so easy to just add last year's lobby at the very least. I don't really see the need for a new lobby just for Oni's chapter. Nothing against it, but would have been much happier with the snowy lobby.
---
Yah I just heard it live on stream, disappointed with BhVR and then wanna wait till beginning of the year for double blood point event and will only be 4 days like normal, fuck BhVR
---
Mood that's so me when I am tired of people im ding dong im gone ezzzz gg
---
holy shit i play with the exact same skin and loadout except I never use the ring because it's worthless to me ngl.
---
Why do you want to escape so badly when it hurts the killer more than it helps survivors?
---
I leave the lobby
---
Not everyone sticks around for the cancer in chat. Nobody is obligated to congratulate you.
---
&gt;Challenges, Entries, and Bloodpoints from Tome I will remain available permanently after this date \[...\]

I don't use it either tbh cuz you can't see scratch marks but I wanted to try on some EXTRA speed you know lol

Ok so you want to have unbalanced shit in the game?
---
hOLY SHIT
---
I don‚Äôt need events. The Halloween and Winter themed lobbies were nice.  2017 Halloween to be precise. Loved that music
---
&gt;BHVR Adds custom chase music
---
Pick one:
---
A) Half the game breaks.
---
B) It doesn't work half the time.
---
C) Both.
---
wtf
---
The whole game is repetitive even for killer. You make it less stale by straying away from meta perks and finding something that changes how you approach the game. 
---
The game will always be repetitive because you‚Äôre going in with the same goal every time. Do gens and get out. New challenges have helped change that by giving you a side objective in matches. If you‚Äôre getting bored as survivor, try killer and experience the other side till that seems repetitive.
---
Adding abilities to survivors won‚Äôt make the game less repetitive, as the goal will always be the same. The perks exist to make the game less stale. You should play around with different builds and see how much different you have to play in doing so.
---
That's a good point. We should get rid of killer powers so they can just be skins as well.
---
What's the point
---
If I know he has a free unhook
---
And he knows he has a free unhook
---
Why would I not just sit there and wait on it.
---
Nah dropping a perk slot in case people hop into lockers to dodge BBQ is pretty weak and the reload being faster isn't a huge upgrade or anything.
---
Could they just down them again, since they‚Äôll already be injured? Just playing Devil‚Äôs Advocate btw, I‚Äôm not for or against a change.
---
I never say GG unless I bonded with my team or I genuinely found the match to be really fun, only because I have no reason to stay around in chat. It was probably the same for the survivors, I wouldn‚Äôt think too much of it. It‚Äôs better that they left than leaving something toxic.
---
Also no summer event
---
Take it a step further and take away their weapon too.  Can't have some killers having cooler looking m1 attacks than others.
---
Why should they have to say anything to you?
---
I mean, aren't forums made for a little bit of trolling?
---
Trapper
---
Yah I forgot to add that, and we were given the excuse because they were trying to get dedicated servers up and going before end of summer. They stoped everything to get the switch version up and going, they are way in over their heads...
---
This entire stream is disappointing. The moderators are just muting others for stating their opinions. Of course we wanted a winter event. "But at least we're giving you festive sweaters", oh give me a break. Throw some lights on the damned generators.

Legion stabs with his knife. Oni slashes.

Hell, as a KILLER MAIN I say if you kobe, you get BT reguardless.
---
"Escape 2 trials- This challenge must be completed in a single trial."
---
Legion 100%
---
They can't do the trapper one because of some rules or regulations about decapitations in video games and how it affects their rating I think?  
---
They all sound cool though and I think Billy/Wraith/Trapper need new moris because they were the first killers and as a result their moris are the least inventive.
---
Meg and her BF look ridiculous.
---
Entity Fried Survivor. It's finger-lickin' good!
---
Seriously, got 19 of those in one match with him hahaha
---
"False Hope"
---
What? Not even cheap presents in the bloodweb? I mean that can't take any resources at all to fix?
---
They also become exposed and you get the bonus speed when reloading. It also counters things like head on and inner strength. You‚Äôre guaranteed information when paired with BBQ and eliminates a form of hiding from the game. There‚Äôs stronger perks to run, but the benefits are far more than just opening the locker quicker.
---
Hypothetically, if they were to remove teachable perks, who would be S tier survivor?
---
hahaha. i did 22/25 in 1 match as legion using a lot of frenzy hits. then did a quick oni match where i hit 3 ppl then went afk
---
1. Bloodlodge if im on killer
---
2. Coldwind
---
3. Thompson house
---
4. Haddonfield
---
5. Lerys
---
I would love to be able to buy an alternative mori. Even though I don't really use for the offering it would still be a thing I would buy if the alternative animation pleases me.
---
No one owes you a gg lol
---
I'm new to the game but the DC penalty scale recovery time seems pretty fair. Looks like it's two non-DC games undoes one DC prior.
---
If you're DCing more than once every 3-5 games, it's probably your fault. At that point you're either consistently ruining others' games from crashing/losing connection so often, or DCing out of bad manner.
---
yeah they could at least spruce it up with repeated assets from last year(s). i just dont care for the word 'solstice' as i think that was like an aethiest attempt to cover up christ. even 'holidays' is a better word. less pagan
---
Year 3 is really the worst.
---
No events anymore, battlepass and a lot of delays and bugs.
---
The only reason you can‚Äôt attempt is because the game shouldn‚Äôt be going for another 2 minutes after it should‚Äôve ended, so why don‚Äôt they just increase entity progress speed but give you more chances (make it only take off time for there to give you 3 attempts) and skip the struggle phase, killing you immediately, because there‚Äôs nothing for either of you to do and its just lengthening the game for no reason.
---
Once Moris get reworked sure.
---
They had to rush to adjust the level 3 ones to something approaching reasonable. They've had more time to rethink level 4.
---
I prefer to play by the unofficial official rules because I know at times it seems unfair so If the survivors can't appreciate it then they have no right to be toxic about it and stop saying shit whenever they're camped, farmed, slugged or whatever. Like so many times survivors tea bag and then complain about the Killers being toxic.
---
People getting chain slugged really fast and leaving me alone, or people will jump in and try to get the killer off me for no reason. Or the classic I go down and everybody rushes at the killer and go down before he picks me up.
---
also had no issue. i was wraith and kept invisible, hit a gen, stood there, tehy came back, hit it again, got it done quick
---
I mean no one is obligated to stay and chat, and with the way the community is, I don't blame them for backing out. I know you tried to offer props originally, but honestly I feel like all this post does is spread more toxicity in an already horribly toxic community.
---
Head on is the worst exhaustion perk and I would rather deal with that than someone intelligently using dead hard, sprint burst, lithe or balanced.  
---
I'd rather still have room in my build (after BBQ and ruin) for nurse's calling, Pop goes the weasel, blood warden, deer stalker, knock out, etc.
---
No I‚Äôm saying that medkit with charge add ons are still broken.
---
Ok was worried,  I do think it be neat to have survivors be unique though. Faster searching, fixing, opening, rescuing, healing, easier skill checks, they would have to be minor to not break balance but enough to make people play someone other then chlaudette.
---
I can hear it as killer in the lobby screen, actually starting to get annoying.
---
What's unbalanced about removing killer abilities? Are you still talking about adding survivor specific perks?
---
I'm a noob killer too. only have about 100 hours in the game. i don't know how i keep making it up to purple ranks. i kinda stagnate at rank 8 cuz i completely dumpster green ranks, but competent purple and red eanks usually 4 man escape
---
Remember no one owes you anything in the chat. I don't mean it in a rude or condescending way. They may have just dipped.
---
wraith
---
You know what that means!
---
#LEGION CHASE MUSIC
---
FUCK YEAAAAH
---
They changed rank reset to make it so everyone now goes back one color rank no matter what their original rank was. This means there's almost no one in gray ranks so to give them games they queue them with higher ranked players
---
Yes, but the katana would really only cut through the outer layer of flesh since he‚Äôs slashing instead of jabbing. If he jabbed with it, then the katana absolutely would inflict deep wounds. Also, that katana would be dull as hell since it most likely hasn‚Äôt been sharpened for generations. The thing‚Äôs probably as sharp as a razor blade compared to a sharpened katana.  Legion, on the other hand, plunges his knife through the skin and tissue with a knife, hence the ‚Äúdeep wound‚Äù status effect. It‚Äôs because the wound actually goes *deep* into the body.
---
hehe id say who cares, its a fast easy challenge anyhow
---
This stream is a nightmare. They just don‚Äôt understand this game at all.
---
set messages to friends only
---
not fun M1'ing with billy
---
LOL at least he gave u constructive advice
---
If you‚Äôre talking about red ranks, if you die you need two iridescent and one gold emblem to pip. Doable but defintely hard especially if you don‚Äôt get the chance to heal. Survivors pipping is heavily dependent on teammates while killers are mostly in control of their own pips. 
---
You literally don‚Äôt need a 4K to pip. Sure, it makes it harder, but still doable. Just like how it is for survivors. 
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems
---
If we‚Äôre talking about other ranks, then you defintely don‚Äôt need a 4K.
---
Very sweet escape! Great job, friend.
---
u/BellumOMNI Is it really that hard to just not say anything at all though? Also tell someone with crippling anxiety that "iT's ReAlLy NoT tHaT hArD" when it feels like you're being beaten in the chest because of how worked up it makes you. If anything what pisses me off the most is how I get upset over it because I can't control that shit. You can't tell someone to not get upset when they literally can't fucking control it. üòÇ
---
RUN THE HEX GAMBLER BUILD : RUIN, HAUNTED GROUNDS, NOED, AND DEVOUR HOPE FOR THE LITTLE SHIT THAT WANTS TO BE A PALEONTOLOGIST
---
I think your definition of constructive is wrong.
---
I remember when I was still new, I delayed the game for about 40+ minutes by crawling all around Coldwind Farm as a Wraith tried its damn hardest to find me. Two of my teammates DC‚Äôd and the other was killed off fairly quickly, so we only had 1 generator completed. When the killer finally found me, I was working on another generator. He stayed by my side and guided me to each generator until the hatch opened. He took me there and I jumped in, finally ending the game. Dude was such a good sport, he laughed when I explained the situation and gave me a couple of pointers. Such an awesome guy.
---
Welcome to DBD. I embrace it now. I try to make people as mad as possible and collect steam profile comments.
---
Devs try to balance the game and update it for both sides, but changes end up upsetting killers: OH MY GOD BEHAVIOUR HAVE THE AUDACITY TO MAKE CHANGES THAT ARE CLEARLY SO SURVIVOR MAIN SIDED THEY DONT THINK ABOUT KILLERS AT ALL SCREW BEHAVIOUR COSMETIC COSMETIC SURVIVOR SIDED GIVE US YOUR MONEY HERES 100 EXTRA BUGS WE TOTALY MEANT TO GIVE YOU GUYS LOL
---
Devs make the smallest change/nerf to literally any survivor perk: Ha, you filthy survivor mains finally got what you deserved. It looks like Behaviour are finally seeing just how absurdly OP survivors are because this is 2017 and survivors have far too many tools to effortlessly destroy my gameplay. 
---
Like, Jesus, I‚Äôm a killer main but I cannot relate to any of you who genuinely think the game is as bad as it was almost two years ago. Yeah, screw Behaviours efforts to balance both sides of an Asymmetrical multiplayer competitive game. Let‚Äôs just trash them for literally trying to make the game better. Pathetic.
---
Gross.
---
u/JoyKingg I usually don't but that was like fifth game that I had to go against toxic assholes and already got messaged a lot. People are saying "Oh it's no big deal" and "It's just a game" but I'm talking about the PEOPLE and the toxic side of the community. I've heard people say very very VERY bad things to each other over this game and it's just getting too much.
---
hehe its funny ppl downvote for a joke. its less funny if i say its a joke but its so obvious it is
---
Excited to hear wraiths. Hopefully some tribal drums
---
Damn you fast as fuck with this lol
---
Damn thats dope! All I need are two! Everyone escapes via the hatch and blink x amount of times and pull a survivor with the nurse. ... Struggle is real
---
I wasn‚Äôt the one doing the downvoting tho. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Chainsaws, Bro.
---
Speed limiter makes a fucking chainsaw, driven into your back or face, do less damage than a small hunting knife.
---
I have always loved the decorations, too &lt;3
---
GROOVY
---
Not necessarily. If the killer wastes 25 seconds walking around checking every corner near a gen, that's even better than a 25 second chase. You use no pallets, put yourself at less of a risk to get smacked, keep the killer confined to one spot rather than potentially running him into your teammates working on other gens and even if it doesn't work, you still get to start a chase. There definitely is a time and place to play aggressive and you can't just only rely on stealth, but saying "chase good stealth bad" completely disregards just how powerful stealth can be in this game.
---
‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre giving you a ton of Christmas gifts, so...‚Äù
---
What? What are they? The shitty Christmas tree charm and bill‚Äôs sweater? Or do you mean the other cosmetics that we have to spend money on? Why should that placate us??
---
you are supposed to put /s at the end of your sentence that is sarcastic
---
Not having to swap to treatment mode is a big buff since one of the biggest issues is using his power in loops being a pain since he has to switch modes. 
---
All around I see the Doctor changes as mostly QOL enhancements.
---
The only "nerf" i'm seeing is no more passive insanity AOE linked to TR in treatment mode. But now he has Static Blast, which is a manual AOE attack that zaps everyone in his TR, so Doc still has a synergy with massive terror radius builds.
---
when i got all characters maxed whit all perks then maybe i prestige
---
If the gates are opened killer has no counterplay, if they are closed the surv has no counterplay cause the killer will just stand over them for 60 seconds and close the hatch if they get close. 
---
The only way the surv escapes with a Kobe would be if the killer walks away for no reason or with ds. Ds is annoying already why would we want it to extend matches when they‚Äôve already lost.
---
But that anniversary event üëåüèªüòÇ
---
I FREQUENTLY TROLL ONLINE SO WHIKE IM GENUINELY THANKFUL FOR THE OFFER, I CANT PROMISE I WONT JUST START SAYING WEIRD WHICH HAVE NO REFARD FOR YOUR FEELINGS MERELY TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF
---
Yeah I covered that in another comment.  They're called bad players.  If you can't work through skillchecks you don't belong up there and you'll literally never improve at them if you gen tap.  You're basically like the NOED gamers of survivor.
---
That‚Äôs the one where you have to use your weapon? Probably not, since his chainsaw is his power and not his primary weapon.
---
what's there to elaborate on? you dont understand how to reveal him. otherwise you wouldnt complain about it.
---
It's honestly a huge disappointment but thanks for those extra sweater "gifts", /u/not_queen_bhvr , you know, the ones a lot of us paid for.
---
Swiggity Swooty they comin' for that Billy Booty!
---
THAT'S FINE, JUST DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE
---
Oh no, did they change his name?
---
Note that console still doesn‚Äôt have dedicated servers so we‚Äôre just like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Turn off messages or just ignore them. If anything I get doesnt start with GG or soemthing non toxic I just delete. It aint worth it
---
He probably was never hooked
---
But i want struggle points. Coz if the other 3 survivors get theirs but I don‚Äôt because I played well for the majority of the game then come on. I‚Äôm greedy. Just give it automatically, like killers get DC points (although not nearly enough tbf)
---
I'm not really disappointed, I don't like festivities.
---
yeah then u should really set everything to ignore. dont read messages included in friend requests either
---
Just because you gen tap doesn't mean you don't deserve to be in red ranks. My brother is very good at DBD and he usually gen taps through ruin.
---
Good stuff!
---
Because no one ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù to pip. Literally the whole goal for survivors is to escape. Dying still makes it way harder for survivors to pip.
---
No, I think the game is better when the design aspects are focused on simplicity and elegance
---
I'm done with this discussion. If the only way you can enforce your opinion is trying to attack any people who disagrees with you, then you can keep it for yourself. Good day.
---
That actually sounds great. But ya know, changes scaring the people who don't play both sides and all.
---
Some killers still cry about decisive and borrowed time for some reason now, as if in their current form they are still as strong as they were back then.
---
They just said it was their first hook
---
Another Sprint Burst bug is discovered.
---
u/Marmotbro That's part of the fucking problem though. What benefit do you have at making someone upset other than the fact you got a reaction out of them? It doesn't feel nice when you get upset over anything whether it be irl or in a game so why do it to someone else? It's fucked up and disgusting how majority of the internet has lost our humanity because there's no real consequences to hurting someone and I'm convinced that y'all forget it's even a real actual human on the other side of the screen with feelings and emotions. It's a big deal because it's just going to get worse. It's drilled into our head that it shouldn't matter because you don't know the person or because it isn't in person but you don't know the shit someone could be going through.
---
*‚ÄùSurvivors piping is heavily dependent on teammates‚Äù*
---
What the actual fuck did I just read? You don‚Äôt depend on others for being altruistic or doing gens. If your team is doing so bad your job is to yolo it and do as much as possible before you die.  
---
Then when you play killer the game you get against the insanely optimal team will be pumping out gens left and right so say goodbye to your gen keeper emblem. And if you do manage to get the 4K someone or 2 of them are getting 1 hooked. You aren‚Äôt getting 12 hooks against that good of a team.
---
Kinda toxic to shake your camera like that. Like, he was already dead.
---
no.
---
Both sides would get some pretty broken combos if it was raised to 5
---
hehe i love his new outfit. i wish kate got some christmas love as she's the only one i'll use
---
I also hear it when he gets downed
---
u/Swashbuckl88 It shouldn't be a problem in the first place.
---
good idea, bad execution
---
Cosidering all his perks are useless it would be nice.
---
Just wanna add. Weren't dedicated servers supposed to fix latency issues? For me it only made it worse but even so it should not be a latency issue
---
You provided a list that you preferred so I used it lmao. You either don‚Äôt understand IM or can‚Äôt comprehend beyond a 1 dimensional use for it. No need to get so worked up over it.
---
Yes...and what next? The killer hits you then has to wait 60 seconds for your little DS to run out...enjoyable.
---
Let's say the killer is boosted enough to miss the hit or you somehow Dead Hard, what now? Sure, run an infinite 3 times, sure throw a safe pallet that the killer can just sit and wait you out at. It's a waste of everyone's time just move on to the next trial.
---
they should just give killers a shortcut and include hex ruin as a permanent 5th perk slot that u cant change
---
I only P3'd my Pig because I thought her original outfit in blood was especially heinous looking and I wanted to rep the Pig at high levels
---
But I have been disappointed in prestiging my other characters; I only really use Nea's bloodied jeans or Dwight's bloodied head
---
They could have done something to take pressure off of teammates though. If you have a get off of hook free card why are you saving it to the last moment when you know you can't jump off instead of trying to be proactive with it.
---
Don't know why you are getting downvoted - this sub is so confusing!  Sometimes, a killer must kill ;D
---
Fine with me, Twitch chat is straight up cancer
---
I know that... they could have done something to get the killer's attention or something along those lines so that they would use it and hopefully help a teammate escape or finish gens etc.
---
Note: Kate died on the way back to her home planet
---
Well, you can't do anything about how people interact with you, can you?
---
I'm not trying to be a dick, but it costs you nothing to not read a message from a stranger, that's the best advice you can receive regarding your problem.
---
Ah just unlucky then.
---
I missed the stream entirely, but do you remember what all they said in terms of Doc changes?
---
lol hes so disapointed
---
No good player gen taps.  It's an oxymoron like Giant Shrimp.  Gen tapping is for noobs that never learned how to hit skillchecks.  Skillchecks are really really easy.  Like I play on console where ours aren't even very good and I still can hit easily.  Choosing to innefiicently deal with a core mechanic of the game in order to bypass growing and developing as a player does not make anyone "good" whether they share DNA with you or not.  Tell him to eat his wheaties and practice skillchecks than we can revisit the skill discussion once you guys complete survivor basics 101 Chapter 1 which is Skillchecks.  Literally they're the first step to learning how to play the role.
---
And while we're at it give all Survivors base kit adrenaline and borrowed
---
Piggybacking off of this: something I learnt just recently through experience is that traps actually function better in high-traffic areas than they do around objectives. This goes for bear traps, Phantasm traps, and, I assume, Freddy's traps, but people will ALWAYS be more alert and on the lookout for them around hooks and gens, so putting them at a common crossroad, under windows, in doorways, or even just placing one where there aren't any others can be better than trying to trap RIGHT against an objective.
---
Thats not what I'm talking about... I'm talking about after the killer has left to do something else and i see ur ass 128 meters away walking very slowly towards me when its clear the killer is gone
---
Ah gotcha. I completely agree, missed your point initially.
---
I can't wait for the test to be finished. I literally can't play right now. The game is so laggy as killer and survivor. I it basically unplayable. As anyone else had this issue?
---
Except they changed arguably the most annoying and clunky aspect of playing Doctor, switching modes and walking 5% slower. Now literally one static burst can put all 4 survivors into madness 2 or 3 if timed right. But I guess that's a nerf.
---
Yea I get what you mean now but I think he still has a point you should be able to use it if you have it at the end regardless.
---
does it make noise in game though?  
---
because if there's no jingle when my spine chill gets a tingle, I ain't buying.
---
Yeah, people being bad at stealth is a big reason why Ill stay around the hook or nearby. I see you, Im not giving you the free unhook and youre just wasting your own time and killing your friend. Stop pretending i can't see you when i can.
---
Followed by: "Face camper, reported" most of the time
---
As survivor its like, take your time if youre uncertain. Id rather go to struggle than end up with 2 people hooked...
---
Just because less people play him doesn't mean it's inaccurate. It is a large sample size and it's statistically significant.
---
So you have the killer sit over your body after he downs you and then what, you Unbreakable and get hit back down again...and the killer waits for your DS to expire and then what's the next genius move here my guy?
---
You should change your username to MarbleTheNegativeNancy
---
not_Iridescent Queen ***
---
I guess it doesn't matter when it's a killer with a charge attack tho :(
---
u/MisterCold Talking to Anna person I guess? I blocked them.
---
As a relatively new killer, what is the actual best play for him here? The exit gates were open and he had very low chance of getting anyone else but risked losing the survivor he had on hook if he left. Why is it bad to just confirm your kill when the game is almost over?
---
It's called Decisive Strike... but if you lack the skill to evade the killer not even that will help you.
---
Ah, in that case yes I see your point.
---
Waaaah
---
Yeah he's fine let him rest.
---
Seen GTA Online? They DDoSing ppl over there.
---
Definitely does not help with the burnout
---
That was some kind of power move I think...
---
SO it would be totally reasonable to reward the survivor for getting hit if there were no loops? that's absurd game design. especially when killers lose bloodlust for breaking a pallet AND getting hit by one.
---
Agitation, iron grasp and mad grit. 4th perk of your choice. Catch them almost anywhere and you‚Äôll make it to the basement.
---
It was me and another. (Idk why but she was very immersed). Los on this map was really bad so oni just had to walk a little bit before he saw the red lights. It was over before we even knew we were stuffed
---
u/DigDropper69 Why I stopped playing that too
---
If you‚Äôve survived long enough to be the last survivor you‚Äôve probably gotten more than the measly 2,000 struggle points just from playing the game
---
Why not insta max it out because you survived to the end? Makes a helluva lot more sense than slowing the game for the points, anyways
---
Yeah you lost the argument the moment you pretended that statistics do not count. Let's pretend everybody plays in Survive With Friends in a group of 4 and they're all experts at the game. Let's do that. This counts much more. /s
---
Fuck off
---
I'm a killer main, I got the **Doctor**, **Freddy** and **Plague** at P3 and I'm busy on the **Ghost Face** he's at P2/48 so it's gonna be soon! But I usually use the lvl. 50 class to grind 1.000.000BP in that way I use up his items and not just throw them away.
---
Guilty of try-hard mode. Although I do recommend the latter.
---
Damn bro now I gotta rewind to hear that earrape ‚ÄúYOU WHAT‚Äù from spongebob :(
---
If you're a killer relying on the doors to spawn right next to each other to win, you dont deserve it. Killer played horrible yet still got a 4k because all he had to do was walk back n forth
---
Did you even read the emblem guide? 
---
Most of altruism points are from healing others and unhooking them. 
---
Evader is mostly from getting chased so if another teammate is looping the killer you won‚Äôt get the chance to gain points. If the killer tunnels another player then you‚Äôre not getting that emblem.
---
Part of lightbringer is dependent on teammates finishing gens. 
---
&gt; your job is to yolo it
---
You‚Äôre defintely not gonna pip if the game devolves into that
---
&gt; the insanely optimal team
---
And then when you play survivor you can get the insanely optimal killer and/or insanely bad team. It goes both ways.
---
Some power... she got ganked by Myers and disconnected Immediately when I ran into her again
---
I just completed the kill 4 survivors in the basement challenge and it took me around 3 games to complete. This was the build I used
---
* Agitation
---
* Monstrous Shrine
---
* Iron Grasp
---
* NOED
---
I didn't even need NOED for the game I got the challenge completed, so you could probably replace it with something like BBQ or Enduring.
---
It looks hard, but it only takes a few tries for the kill 4 survivors one, and I definitely hooked more than 5 times in the basement. I hope this helps!
---
So? Points are points. Makes the grind a bit easier. Is there any reason players don‚Äôt deserve it? No because they just insta die even on first hook. Just give them the 2k points, no one loses anything
---
The devs should not be catering to the red ranks (aka top 3%) to balance this game.
---
WHY IS THE SOLUTION FOR EVERYTHING "ADD A COOLDOWN"?!?!!?!?! COOLDOWNS ARE NOT FUN AND ARE NOT INTERACTIVE!!!
---
Is Legion getting nerfed again? Good they really need it. Hope they nerf Pig too
---
Thank the lord unhook 3 or even 2 surv during endgame collapse was removed
---
these challanges might be easy, but at least it keeps me from playing like a toxic boi.
---
Reading comprehension only works when WHAT'S WRITTEN makes sense in the right context. YOUR first statement is obtuse. You're speaking in general when the context of the video is not taken as a factor. It's toxic on both sides, it's not just survivors. You BM/Be Toxic, the other side has all the right to do so back and call you out on it. It's not double standards if the standards apply to both sides.
---
For fucks sake I‚Äôm not gonna even bother. It‚Äôs literally your job to pip and a team effort to escape. Enjoy your day
---
just keep replying with "cool"
---
Hell no.
---
Just better to make distance especially if they have the sloppy build
---
u/AndreTheWeen I'll try that
---
i also agree
---
Is it in my head that the Trapper seems like he's faster than other killers on-foot, normal walking? Whether I'm playing as him or against him, chases seem to end a lot more often with hits, and he seems to be able to close distances faster, but I haven't played enough/against enough to actually know for sure.
---
Toxic pig
---
And flashlighting the killer twice in a match when they have a Survivor in their arms
---
also no winter party starters lame
---
What‚Äôs your point.

Playing for fun eh? You must be one of the last ones. Imo the state of the game has only gotten worse since the archives. (Yes I play console so that's on me) I can never find games, but when I do it's going against red rank killers because noone else is playing, or it's not at all. I deeply regret buying the battle pass. Won't be doing that again.
---
The hell you mean we are already nerfed to shit
---
Will completing all the challenges get me to level 70 on the Rift?
---
If the killer killed all 3 survivors plus finds hatch first, the game's already over, if the doors spawn on opposite sides like the hospital and the killer makes the wrong choice the last survivor escapes by luck
---
That's interesting, I kinda like it
---
3+ Claudette is the only time I use iri head/infantry belt. Mori if there‚Äôs 4 of them
---
But it's a slice Vs a stab
---
yep lol
---
Something that needs to be addressed is DCing because if trolling, sandbagging survivors who also team with the killer. It‚Äôs not that common but it‚Äôs happened to me and I‚Äôve left before it got worse.  Maybe if the devs really gave a shit when you submitted video proof with usernames it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem.
---
I like it too but I am a killer main so my survivors are low level and their only perks are typically their own, Small game and Spine Chill.
---
I want to say they do it for Killer too but I feel that it would cause you to use perks that dont work well together or waste a perk slot. IE I am playing Myers STBFL and PWYF isn't a great combo and DL isn't a good perk.
---
if you've never met a good legion that's just luck
---
what did you say about my just?!?!?!?!?
---
Doctor was never stressful to play against. He was easy as hell to beat. On the game map with a certain build he was a bit of a bitch but beyond that I always found him fun to play against.
---
Well, you know... *some* kind of power XD
---
I dig it
---
SAMEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I hope it sounds as awesome as their main menu theme
---
And doesn't apply deep wound unless running
---
Deadhard
---
go follow ur rule book and leave us play the game the way we like....catholic play = boring play
---
&gt; ~~toxicness~~
---
*toxicity
---
Very much so. Double xp fortnight like last year would have been all I need to finish off a number of my killers perks.
---
I am sorry... but I personally don't like Jane and just... don't. Stop.
---
You get 5000 points for escaping right? The bottom guy did nothing lmaooo
---
Damn, I literally just stopped playing.
---
Ah that one. It‚Äôs special to the survivor isn‚Äôt it?
---
The problem with Legion and Pig is that they‚Äôre still able to kill survivors. If you don‚Äôt see the problem with this, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you
---
Oh man, I am going to buy it and slap on plunderer's instinct and Ace in the Hole and give all the other good survivors and killers presents.
---
He died first, gave up on first hook and just let it kill him.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why Laurie‚Äôs P3 outfit doesn‚Äôt include her slashed arm
---
This is hours old comment already geeez
---
It's the teachable perk for David King. Highly recommend leveling him to get it
---
i'm gay
---
Nah bro, don't say that. It makes it sound like it's the beginning of the end :(
---
Looks like if the Joker was a demon
---
What we need is survivor friendly killers
---
Definitely wouldn‚Äôt have gotten 30K camping them, and they didn‚Äôt seem boosted to me
---
Guess I gotta buy him lol. One of my friends just got it and keeps testing it out. 
---
I‚Äôm garbage at running away so this might be perfect for me
---
Well you're wrong. He is good at the game. He sometimes does it normally but he doesn't like doing it. It definitely slows you down but even if someone is good at getting greats, I would guess the average of goods they get is like 1.5 or something.
---
I never thought of that, that would make it so much more interesting. I always thought of the Legion as sort of a Purge type of killer. They‚Äôd just team up and murder anyone. Would make it more balanced with a huge map and more survivors though. But that would be nuts.
---
Right?  There's literally been several dozen key survivor nerfs/killer buffs over that time period that has made playing killer feel night and day different compared to what we went through in the days before the pallet vacuum removal update.  Shit used to be legit fucked for killer.  But so many players either didn't play back then to know what struggle really looks like OR they were so incredibly bad at killer that they literally didn't notice any impact in their game because they could get dunked on by anyone.
---
Well if it was realistic one hit from any killer should kill a survivor. Now would you play a game where a single hit kills when trying to escape?
---
To add logic, the NTT makes sure a hit isnt an instant kill because it is wanting lulz.
---
Definitely, even as a Legion main i feel like if they look at a surv they get  -1000000 blood points
---
Double bp is coming Jan 2 according to r/leaksbydaylight
---
Yeah running a perk just to boost BBQ or just to open lockers faster would suck. There‚Äôs a lot more to it though. Agree to disagree.
---
Yes, disagreeing with someone = ruining the fun
---
Isnt the point of this post to cause discussion? or would you prefer everyone to agree constantly
---
Instead of strangling the survivor on the ground nurse could lift them up and force choke them.
---
This is definitely a bruh moment
---
The almighty entity
---
Holy shit, what a laggy mess when your jumped of the hook, even your dead hard was like going 3 cm forward. So much bullshit to prevent you from escaping lol, but you did it. Screw that killer, gg!
---
That's impossible. The charge add on bug didn't reduce charges at all. And the gel dressing add on which takes away 8 charges took away no charges. You're definitely mistaken about something
---
It basically gives you an iframe. If you're familiar with dark souls or smash bros, you know how useful that can be. Here's a little lesser know tip, you can deadhard over The Trapper's traps.
---
And Legion's knife probably has better hitbox detection.
---
Have to consider how the emblem systwm works. Freddy, Wraith, and Legion are 3 of the most emblem friendly killers.
---
I started playing this spring and I haven't experienced any of those cool events that I see in older videos.
---
My internet/game has crashed 3 times today and now I have a 15minute penalty. WTF this is shit. I thought BHVR said they could distinguish the difference between a DC and a game crash/lost of internet
---
I p3 anyone I wanna main, i p3'd yui, feng, wraith, and pig
---
Rework his power into something that involves the whole gang. Thatd be cool as shit
---
Fuck healing - No mither gang.
---
Sounds like he won't have his constant static field anymore though and you'll have to do it manually, not sure how i feel about that.
---
Ok kiddo
---
Fully agree with that. Don‚Äôt see any real downside either.
---
Lol ikr
---
ACTUALLY even as a killer main i can tell you theres one bad thing about doctor for the survivor side: the skill checks are too much when you have tier III of the power on you. they even shift it away from the center of the screen, AND if you miss one, you start ALL OVER. so, yes, that is dumb and can use a change for the survivors' sake, not for ours
---
I made a pretty clear case for why I'm not wrong.  Skillchecks are a core part of the game and EVERYONE runs Ruin at red ranks so that isn't a good first day to miss in school if you're planning on hanging up there.  Skillchecks should literally be the first thing a player learns.  Also your 1.5 thing is just a weird shaky guess based off no actual math or real gameplay numbers.  I get that you look up to your brother but like it's really simple don't talk skill until you can read your way past the first page of the book.  We aren't ready to talk chapter summaries yet, he still has to finish the first page of Survivor 101 before we can talk about the novel at book club.
---
I love when people say more survivors DC, its like there are 4 of them in one lobby. 
---
The dc penitently isnt fixing much, they really need to just fix the punishments you are given for having another player DC
---
Legion gets nerfed again
---
Hiding your score? What do you mean?
---
yeah because normal survivors sprint up to the killer and hold still...
---
if killers don't want to farm, instead of downing me they could hit and then shake their head.  I don't care if I get hooked though, it's fair enough.  I've only met one killer who let me get my flashlight challenge.  I've met surv in almost every lobby that will help me.
---
He has to be dead center on your screen and you have to take his add ons into account. I've been revealed from some awkward spots, but I can't stay I've had a lot of trouble revealing him if I try to.
---
They must be expecting a fucking miracle if they think people can kill all four survivors in the basement in a single trial.
---
Not continually camping. SWF tend to be over- aggressive on hook saves. Easy to run away then come back immediately for bait.
---
Not that I was going to buy anyway but I hate the fact that Meg's and Huntress cosmetic are Auric Cells Only. 
---
As a veteran player grinding for cosmetics is the only thing left for me but when cosmetics like this get released and I can't buy, I just close DBD (which is one less player in the player pool for matchmaking) since there is not much left to do in the game. 
---
If I could buy every single cosmetic with Iri Shards (which is not cheap), I would be playing for many more hours to regain my shards back which would make me another player queuing and serving as matchmaking for those that play and buy skins with Auric Cells. 
---
I understand the logic of Auric Cells Only but BHVR should re-think them. People that can't afford to buy skins, making Auric only won't change that. People that can buy with Auric Cells but can't be bothered to grind for Iridescent Shards, will buy the skins no matter what.
---
More things available to grind for is an incentive for people to continue playing which increases the player population, helping the matchmaking. If players that are used to buy skins with Auric Cells can't even play the game due to lack of players (killer or survivor), they will think twice before continue to spend money on skins. 
---
Finally, 21.600 Iridescent Shards for a full outfit is a LOT so is not like people that just bought the game will be able to buy multiple skins straight away.
---
I know that he's good because when we go against red rank killers and he is found first we almost always get 3 or more out because he can run them around for so long.
---
I'm not a katana expert but I think you're pretty much right, Katanas can cut through whole bodies if the target is unarmored afaik
---
That's fucking dope. Basically Kaelthas Living Bomb from HOTS.
---
so like im just now realizing theres couches in ormond
---
BHVR has always more or less allowed the behavior. Just move on to the next match. Players will d/c for any reason.
---
removed feel free to post this on dbd gonewild sub
---
Not my idea but saw it on another post a while back. Instead of unique abilities give all survivors and killers a 5th perk slot that can only be used for one of their 3 teachables. (not my idea so don't hate)
---
Is it a whole new item or is it replacing something? I've almost gotten all perks on Doc so I don't plan on dumping many more points into him until my add-on hoard has depleted a fair bit.
---
All right man you can either follow the simple logic of good survivors can do skillchecks or you can't.  I'm not going to keep doing this with you.  If you gen tap you're bad at the game.  If your brother gen taps he's bad at the game.  Practice and once you guys become skillcheck competent we can revisit this. Get practicing.
---
That's nice, custom chase music has been creeping more and more into the game lately and I would love to one day hear a special chase theme for every Killer. This makes me wonder though... what would happen to the "old" chase musics?
---
It's AOE on your Terror Radius, there's still his Treatment Mode shocks as far as I'm aware so specific zapping is still a thing. But the new Static effect has a long cool down and a 2sec charge and release mechanism with movement slow down, so no more tracking screaming Survivors just by being in Treatment Mode with passive Static Field, that's gone.
---
My bf always lets Laurie live if he plays Myers and lets shirtless David live if he‚Äôs huntress.
---
It's pathetic to assume it's pathetic. Sure, BM was wrong from killer's side, but considering gates probably 99'ed, if he would leave this guy - it will be easy escape. And there is nothing toxic or amoral about securing a kill after gens are done.
---
I like stealthy players when they actually do a gen with a ruin instead of searching 10 min for a totem.
---
You do the reverse looks like a nice joint
---
[deleted]
---
We all want Jason but because of the lawsuit going on right now we will not get him
---
Freddy or Spirit.
---
They probably already used that pun once or twice
---
The two who had DS and borrowed time never got them to go off and if that were the case the other 2 SWF would be on a gen while i baited then which would‚Äôve lead to easy gens and an escape
---

Honestly left me speechless
---
He's making a joke
---
I hate the single trial challenges. Hooking 5 times in the basement or 4 basement kills is fine if it didn't need to be done in a single match. Same for completing 4 gens.  
---
Do you know how hard it is to finish 4 gens in a single match? You basically have to have your teammates doing anything but working gens. The other survivors have to either do anything but their main objective, or you have to somehow convince them to work a gen to 99% so you can run in and finish it off. Even in SWF that's almost impossible.
---
I rather they up the amount of times you need to do something and get rid of the single trial restriction.
---
&gt; Again, survivors making everything about themselves and bitching and moaning when they're inconvenienced isn't something that's never been heard of or demonstrated, and this is no different.
---
Aren't you doing literally the same right now?
---
That's the whole point. There are some weirdos on both sides. Sadly but natural.
---
I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed her! There are very little Plague mains and we need more!
---
The order is bullshit. 4 gens with dark sense in a single trial, meaning you can only afford other survivors to do one gen without you there. Its pretty much for swf only.
---
Then its followed up by escape a trial as claudette....how the fuck is that a level 4 challenge? Im sure it was tome 1 too.
---
Nigh on impossible to not even a challenge
---
Lol what. I lobe the pretentiousness sometimes in subs. We all know the Jane avatar is referenced that way. And I wasn‚Äôt commenting on the OP. I was saying in general. Better clean your horse it‚Äôs not as white as you are Mr. Knight. Get lost you dumb ass.
---
Let me just say that he fully broke a hook with a bnp toolbox and it wasn‚Äôt even for a challenge. Aswell as asking how michael  one hit his girlfriend he was playing with.
---
And yet, thoae filthy huntets doesnt follow the rules
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
So the rift pass costs $10 and you earn $10 when you complete it?
---
I can't see the price in game.
---
I know it won‚Äôt happen but I hope Clown‚Äôs chase music is the Benny Hill theme
---
FUCK ONI
---
It's almost as if people complained an unrealistic amount.
---
that was so sick dude
---
Nice one m8
---
A "last man standing" bonus would give another incentive for passive play. Sometimes the last guy left is the one who didn't do anything. We've all seen the guy who gets hatch and has like &lt;10k total after the hatch escape bonus.
---
lmao you forgot one
---
Remove the N and you have the perfect word to describe the shrine.
---
See option one. Move away and give enough space for a survivor to come and unhook if you don‚Äôt want to apply exit gate pressure
---
Tbh when someone is hooked and I get the last hook I like to tap until the end to get some more points. Especially if it‚Äôs double bp.
---
Let me think:
---
- increased range of shock therapy
---
- no more stances
---
- static field (which was kinda shit after rank 9) was changed to static blast, which increases survivors' madness in greater value that shock therapy, apply shock stun, make survivors scream and is bound to your terror radius, the downside is 1 min cooldown.
---
- no more donut add-on instead we have iridescent queen, which act like that leaked scrapped tape description
---
- obedience no longer grant exhaustion instead we have reverse skillchecks
---
What stays: 
---
- 4.6 movement speed
---
- shock stun lasts 2.5 seconds
---
- random skillchecks
---
- survivors scream when they level up madness
---
- and probably other things which was not mentioned
---
Oh yes, doc is nerfed to the ground, i'm telling you guys he isn't even going to be in f tier more like g tier or h tier, yes you are totally right this is a nerf, a HUGE NERF.
---
I guess, but the way it is now it kind of acts like a radar. And it's apparently going to be on a cooldown.
---
No caps, Im so pissed that I‚Äôm calm. Weird right? I‚Äôve played 20 games in a row. And each game I‚Äôve literally been the first player hooked. So I joined my most recent game, and I spawn next to a Meg. Cool right? I‚Äôm close to a locker. I‚Äôm tired of being the first hooked. So I go into the locker, planning on waiting a few seconds just to see if the killer zooms past me. But Meg? Meg had other plans. She approaches my locker and spams opening it, apparently worried that I want to play the game my way. The killer shows up inevitably, as I‚Äôm too pissed to even care to leave the locker. The Meg gets hit, and runs, and wowie the killer STAYS AND GRABS ME OUT OF THE LOCKER. I literally just disconnect, mostly so the killer chases that Meg.
---
Wrong it is uncapped at loading screen
---
You guys are aware that he's a licensed character and they can't realease any ''random'' outfits? Same for Bill, Quentin and Ash. That's why I always say original dlc's are way better than licensed, but everyone wants their favourite horror movie in the game and then wonder why they are not getting many outfits.
---
I am so confused
---
Might not, but should get you pretty damn far into it.
---
I managed to complete the RIFT before this page went live, just playing and doing the challenges
---
What's unbalanced about removing killer abilities or are you still talking about adding survivor specific perks?
---
Exactly, I like the passive now as it acts like a radar. We'll see though.
---
Isn‚Äôt it because Legion‚Äôs knife is like rusty AF?
---
Terrible idea tbh. Gens already get slept on enough in a lot of matches. This would just enable survivors to stay away from gens once they give up on the team too early.
---
B r u h  I'm breaking out the good bowl and extra butter for this!
---
Yeah some of the challenges are pretty difficult, specially the ones that reward tome entries
---
I can imagine the Trapper trying his hardest to use the toolbox as a weapon.
---
AKA "Play one game with Jane Romero".
---
Okay
---
Bill's left behind is unusable, perks like Insidious (promoting camping) should be something else entirely, Monstrous Shrine is garbage. Unrelenting strike is trash. More perks should award bonus points for doing X, like BBQ and We're gonna live forever, more perks should be a viable way to slow the game down and not just ruin. I liked the idea behind Surge, but it's basic attack only why not just straight up on going down? More killers can run it and not just M1 killers. Tons of survivor perks are pretty crappy but you can usually run more non meta stuff, as a survivor than killer.
---
Stuff like that.
---
90% are impossible without a swf or coordinated game.
---
I know it was charge add on and something else. When I tried to heal myself with the medkit it was used up before I even healed myself halfway. There‚Äôs definitely something wrong with the add ons tho, I just don‚Äôt know what exactly.
---
I use maps to track the occasional thing, but USUALLY I just carry it to get a few more points in my ‚Äúdoing gens, you?‚Äù Category
---
Why do you have to bring counters in?  Because that's how the game works you overused dildo.
---
It's the entity's influence 
---
That's the sorry and I'm sticking with it
---
Along with his big nerf.
---
It's like I don't want to hear your ass complain about killer balance and "OP Survivors" if you've never played a Wraith game where you had to uncloak to kick every pallet and gen or to search a locker against a lobby full of instablind flashlights and insta completed gen bnp's on a map that has god windows and double pallets as far as the eye can see with a built in vacuum to safety on each one while dealing with Decisives that denied first hooks and mid chase exhaustion recovery allowing for multiple Dead Hards or Sprint Bursts per chase.  Like these dudes have no idea what a tough killer game looks like lol!  You'd think we live in a vacuum and that none of these changes ever happened reading the entitled woe is me killer posts around here sometimes.
---
All the yes
---
It better change depending on which Legion member it is.
---
As long as gets that meat cleaver to replace the hammer
---
It essentially lets you choose when you want to have easy acess to survivor locations.
---
This can work really well if you are saving the tier one proc for when haunted grounds or the like activates.
---
People are really confused about what a hitbox is, and what lag is.
---
Yes, you're playing as David MacMillan: The Trapper
---
the gates are barely powered when David got hooked, there's no way they were 99'ed or for the killer to assume that. They are also spread far apart, Hillbilly definitely could've made a play here to keep the game going, even if it were just trading hooks at that point between the survivors.
---
Seeing as it was David's first hook, it is much more likely that the Hillbilly tunneled a lot to barely get that first kill and barely got David by the time all the gens were dumb, and  was salty about it that he had to constantly chainsaw David on the hook being proud of his lackluster 2k that quickly turned into a 1k.
---
Id give you gold if I could, but here‚Äôs a discount gold instead üèÖ
---
Yeah, he got the movement speed increase when he was nerfed into the ground. They thought it would balance his obviously overwhelming capability to... Injure survivors and then take a nap.
---
Wraith using the flashlight to mori someone
---
#WACK
---
I got really lucky and got that one first try. I played super immersed. Full immersed build and played a blendette that didn't do anything all game. Immersion will help a lot
---
Thank you thank you thank you. Im pretty new and im gonna try and listen to all of what you said. Its been a challenge for me as far as looping goes, i don‚Äôt look behind me maybe that‚Äôs been my problem this whole time . How long did it take you to understand how to play?
---
I ABSOLUTELY HATE RUIN!!! IT‚ÄôS THE LEAST GRATIFYING PERK I CAN THINK OF BUT OPTING NOT TO RUN IT ON MY PERSONAL FAVORITE KILLERS (LEGION/PIG/PLAGUE) CAN BORDERLINE GUARANTEE A GAME OVER!! WHY DO THE DEVS THINK WE WANT TO WASTE A PERK SLOT ON A BORING, UNRELIABLE, HANDS-OFF PERK???
---
Doc is a noob stomper for baby survivors who can't hit skillchecks, if you're halfway decent at them he's not much of a problem.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eciumx/disconnection_penalty_is_buggy_as_fuck/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I wish BHVR would put some energy behind punishing camping ... anything
---
Spine chill, bond, urban evasion and Iron will is a good stealth build.
---
Start the game doing totems or chests, the killer usually patrols gens on the edge of the map at the start.
---
Is this your original work op?
---
Love how you so kindly ignored the fact that I stated he wasn't difficult, just annoying, but do you boo. Good luck!
---
Yes of course ;w;
---
That's what I thought, thanks for confirming.

What's the ending sound effect lol.

I cannot express enough how basically this is just easier Myers

I once had a challenge to scare birds, so I ended up on the swamp map with the boat(i don't remember what it's called) but I spent most of the time running circles around the exterior scaring birds that landed on logs then I got lucky and found the hatch
---
OMFG FIX THE FUCKING SOUNDS. I HARDLY EVER HEAR SURVIVORS AND WHEN I DO THEY SOUND CLOSER THAN THEY ACTUALLY ARE!
---
Sure!
---
I'm still gonna down you and rehook you.
---
Yup XD
---
GOT DC'ED BY WHAT THE FUCK REASON FROM THE KILLER (SHOWED UP HE PLAYED EVEN THO HE GOT "DCED" AS WELL - LOST CONNECTION LOGO) AND I GOT 30 MIN BAN FOR HEALING MYSELF üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
THIS GAME SUCKS
---
It‚Äôs incredible.
---
But also do you think you could ever do just twerking Ace? Because I love him
---
&gt;Well im not. I was specifically talking about ps4 the whole time
---
You are missing the point here so last try. The problem here is no your system, not the capped or uncapped frames. The problem is that screen because it causes overheating no matter what. 
---
I just used PC to isolate the problem by monitoring, testing and comparing with normal gameplay temperature at 99% GPU usage.
---
Dying light is kind of weak imo so it's not too mean lol
---
If it were noed, sloppy or nurses I'd say you're a monster bullying those poor dweets
---
How am I ever going to get four survivors to agree to be sacrificed in the basement?
---
Haha ok I‚Äôll keep it in mind and do it if I have the chance XD (he is twerking in the comic tho- just against a wall)
---
Exactly. Insidious Bubba overjoiced
---
Thank you. Us No Mitherans can just skip a whole a whole state saving much more time.

THE OTHER DAY I WAS IN A MATCH WHERE I HAD TO SOLO THREE GENERATORS. NOT ONE. NOT TWO. BUT THREE. ZERO TO ONE HUNDRED. WHAT THE HELL WAS THE REST OF MY TEAM DOING THAT I HAD TO SOLO THREE GENERATORS?? I GET IT, THEY'RE BEING CHASED BY THE KILLER, BUT IT STILL DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHY I, ALONE, HAVE TO DO MORE GENERATORS THAN THE THREE OF THEM COMBINED. AND YES THEY WERE ALL ALIVE, THE ONLY ONE TO DIE DIED IN ENDGAME. I WASN'T EVEN PLAYING IMMERSED.
---
If people want out of a game they will find a way
---
There are some minor fluctuations but for the most part, no matter what level you are, you're getting 0.072 Iridescent shards per exp point
---
Ofcourse Im missing on purpose. it‚Äôs not
---
Like I suck or something haha *sweats*
---
Be a good challenge tho if killer isn't already hard enough lol
---
Haha you‚Äôre welcome!  Yeah, looking behind you and moving your camera around is key to playing survivor. It takes some time getting used to but once you get the hang of it, games are going to be much more fun!  
---
So I‚Äôve been playing for about a year and a half and I would have to say maybe 3 or 4 months to *really* understand things.  I always think about this; I did shitty every game and then one day I woke up and I learned how to loop lol. I don‚Äôt know what clicked in my head.  All of the YouTube videos helped me I think. Once I came across no0b3 I think that‚Äôs when I started to play better.  I started educating myself months after I started, so if someone here (or you) sees this, I think you‚Äôll be much better in no time. Good luck to you my friend!
---
Imagine using dying light. 
---
This post was made by every other perk gang.

(Dying light best survivor perk)

I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the cashier in the Ghost Face trailer.

---
If people want out of a match or don't want to play the match, they won't. You can't punish people into playing against something they simply don't want to.
---
If you add suicide punishments people will just AFK in lockers or don't even attempt to run away when the killer comes for them.
---
With Nemesis, idts
---
Yeah, that's right, you nearly get the same per XP.
---
The Only thing you should P3 is blendette in my opinion. Every other cosmetic is just for show and useless
---
are you actually asking that? removing the killers abilities would literally make them worthless?

---
SURVIVORS AT EXIT GATES: TEABAGGING, FLASHLIGHT CLICKING
---
SURVIVORS IN END GAME CHAT: STOP CAMPING
---
ME AS HAG: WAIT FOR ME TO LEAVE BEFORE YOU UNHOOK, LIKE WAIT 20 SECONDS FFS
---
Yeah i agree BM is bad
---
This comment section is the ultimate battle between White Knights and Creeps but somewhere in between there are small glimpses of human decency... Oof
---
GG on the cosplay tho
---
Found the killer main!
---
"Year 3 is the worst" 
---
Holy fucking shit you must be new. For years this game was broken and unbalanced as shit. I'd say the games better now than it's ever been.
---
Go through [this](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems) to get a rough idea of the minimums you need to be looking at. First section tells you where your points come from, pip conditions tells you how many you need to earn.
---
Rank 4 is Red ranks, so instead of 12-14 points to pip up, you need 13-15. This means something like 3 Golds and an Iri *minimum* to pip up.
---
Obviously stealth has its moments but good killers won't waste time like that, they'll check the gen, maybe a quick check around then move on. Same way a good survivor could potentially run a killer for several gens so chases are far more effective in wasting killers time. It's like I said, it's about knowing when to play immersed rather than just immersing the whole time.
---
I‚Äôm new to PC. Dont have any perks really
---
The improper usage of the word "you're" is the real deep wound.
---
Nurse. Can cover the Map pretty well and ignore all loops
---
DON'T DO NUMBER 2, IT SUCKS TO PLAY AGAINST
---
They even said it in stream, they're not trying to make the Doc a better killer, they just want the survivors to have more fun going against him. 
---
Basically if a killer has the capacity to annoy the survivors in any capacity then that's not allowed.
---
This is literally as low effort as it gets, at least use the right jeans and tie the bottom of the shirt. Sorry this isn't a costume, this is just an outfit a blondie wore.
---
Last 50 levels. You get 25.3k for 100 levels and you get 300 each level after 50
---
I don‚Äôt understand the issue ngl. If I get one I‚Äôm happy. I can do my challenge and get bp. Eases the stress off a little too. You don‚Äôt have to help them. But they‚Äôre only helping you
---
Yikes that dude is definitely mad. This is why I play the Hag. You dont need to camp when you can be across the map in the blink of an eye
---
Your extremely subjective opinion isn't 'literal fact'.
---
Dang, that's the one thing I like about Doctor. Helped me learn where survivors like to hide in the early game.
---
Nothing wrong with helping a fellow DBDer out.
---
Right, because the game can‚Äôt crash multiple times. I mean, it only crashes for me 2 or 3 times daily, that doesn‚Äôt add up. Oh wait, it does. Cool.
---
Denial isn't very flattering, on anyone.
---
I just hope they use that YouTubers music
---
*Sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement in one game*, would like like a word
---
i mean that sucks but nothing the devs can do about it lol
---
I want to play the game I paid for not totem cleansing and getting trapped sim 2019
---
Good stuffs!
---
Still not seeing an issue. I said already, BM was a dick move. But otherwise, he used not all toxic strat to keep the kill. He could be just bad on this killer. Or was pissed off by this survivor earlier. Either way, securing a hook in the endgame situation is completely fine.
---
Yeah it is! I was gutted we didn't get him or the store as a map I seriously want it as a map :( At least we got the classic ghostface outfit though.
---
Known issues:
---
Trapper has bugs, we'll get to them in 2032.
---
You‚Äôre not obligated to farm with them. Just ignore the message and move on.
---
I have a feeling some of these "pressing issues" are stupid questions which shouldn't be surprising to be ignored.
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy to leave a lobby after receiving a ‚Äúwanna farm?‚Äù dm. I know the lobby queue is annoying, but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal.
---
That hairstyle is the hottest thing on a girl with confidence, different tastes I guess :/
---
Honestly I've been playing the game for about a year now, and I dont have the maps 100% memorized, just the main buildings like the gas station or open houses. But put me on The Game or Hawkins and fuck me dude I'll be lucky if I can find a single generator the entire game.
---
What a shit killer for letting you guys party in the gates lol I would have forced out fully
---
*sad urban noises*
---
I only prestiged a few survivors and Piggy so far. I only play casually, DBD is not my main game and even though I play with my bf who always gets into red ranks by the end of the month, he's not a try-hard and nor am I (never got out of purple ranks but honestly don't care) so prestigeing survivors is pretty easy and fun, I just work with whatever perks the bloodweb throws at me (preferably as memey as possible). I only prestiged Piggy (my main) after farming up a million BPs though because I'm pretty bad at killer and get horrendously bullied whenever I try playing killer without meta perks.
---
Omg that store would make such a fun map!
---
Yeah that is a tad stupid imo.
---
Of course it's a Mandela effect. It's ruined a lot of my childhood things
---
FEELSBADMAN
---
Lmao you know there‚Äôs ways to outplay that right?
---
Especially with deliverance
---
Just that second panel alone is worth a thousand words
---
Please delete DBD. We don't want or need someone like you in our community
---
My only gripe with that is Tru3 thinks Wraith might actually be more viable than GhoseFace which is absurd
---
Definitely a map were pallets wouldn't be out of place lol
---
I've been in this situation so many times to the point i'm numb to it.
---
Buff
---
I'M EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED THAT THERE WILL BE NO SOLSTICE THIS YEAR IN ADDITION TO A PUNY 4 DAY HOLIDAY BLOODHUNT AT THE START OF THE YEAR WHEN MOST RETURN TO SCHOOL
---
Tombstone and oni‚Äôs aura reading one are changes.
---
Depending on how to the doors or hatch you are if you get hit by DS there‚Äôs be no way to catch up in time. If they have unbreakable you‚Äôd have a better chance. There are a few ways that a survivor can turn that 4% chance into a near 100% chance to escape. 
---
So say someone gets the 4% or the deliverance perk escape, the killers would hit them and they go down. If they have DS the killer has to wait 60 seconds. If they don‚Äôt the person can have unbreakable and DH. Both of those would potentially make it possible for the survivor to make it to hatch or out of the door without the killer having a way to counter. Or a small % chance to prevent the escape. There are other ways that this can favor a survivor basically getting a free escape. I‚Äôm of the opinion that if I killer has to bust his ass to basically get a 4k then survivors shouldn‚Äôt potentially get immortality to escape. 
---
Even if there‚Äôs no chance the survivor could get out, I don‚Äôt want to wait an extra minute for the potential DS to run out.
---
That's just not true. Some people can play all the time and never reach red ranks.
---
lolwut
---
Isn't that what the new scrapped tape is supposed to do?
---
Exactly, I‚Äôve met many supportive people online (Male myself but seen it) but the bad people are more memorable unfortunately
---
What would be a pressing issue you would like a answer about then?
---
r/okbubbaretard
---
It's the other way around for me. Almost instant survivor queues and 10 minute killer queues.
---
Thanks so much haha. We were just so psyched after the whole thing.
---
Sorry for wanting to play the game Mr big brain killer main
---
\[I AM SO TIRED OF KILLERS FINDING US WITHIN THE FIRST 15 SECONDS OF THE GAME, TUNNELING, CAMPING, AND GETTING STUPID KILLS WITH NOED. I WAS DOING FINE UNTIL I GOT TO THE CHALLENGE WITH 5 ESCAPES AND NOW THE ENTITY HAS SUDDENLY DECIDED THAT I'LL ONLYT ESCAPE ONE IN EVERY 10 GAMES\](/intensifies)
---
What‚Äôs EGC?
---
I'm saying he was salty, and yes he was toxic with the constant chainsawing at the hook. You can't just be like "if you ignore the pathetic BM then it wasn't pathetic."
---
It's an ok tactic, but still not the best thing to be doing. Personally I think promoting a playstyle like this only encourages bad killers to stay bad, he still had potential to get another kill if he didn't give up and BM the David.
---
Alright, so there's two schools of thought on Ghost Face - one school just uses his stealth, and the other actually tries to use his instadown. Sounds like you're the former.
---
Assuming you only have base perks and Ghost Face's own, consider Whispers (at T3 *only*, nothing less), Sloppy Butcher, Thrilling Tremors, and Bitter Murmur. When you get Barbecue &amp; Chilli, it can replace Bitter Murmur.
---
For add-ons, anything that reduce the recovery of stealth. It should go [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He-PltRCDTU), although there'll be more time pressure on you because you don't have Corrupt Intervention.
---
&gt; *general advice*
---
Understand your power, understand how [loops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop) work. That's all there is to it.
---
The constant chainsawing is the only problem honestly.
---
He *could* have gotten another kill, but he probably didn't feel confident in his ability to. Like you said, he probably got ran around all game. So he'd probably get ran around during the collapse. Also there's no point in running away from the hook at this point when you know the survivors will more than likely be coming to you. He has probably just as good, if not a better chance of getting a third, and even forth kill by camping imo. 
---
Camping is super lame and unfun, but walking away just lets the survivors unhook during the collapse and takes away all the pressure. People need to learn that there are right and wrong times/ways to camp a hook
---
I enjoy a Jane joke as much as the next guy, but requesting a big bootie Jane cosplay on somebody‚Äôs cosplay post like that just comes off as creepy, is all
---
Survivor main. And again, you're just a toxic douchbag. We don't WANT you. We HATE you. So please, delete DBD and leave this sub. You're not welcome here
---
Still not fair for the people whose game is fucked now that they're down someone.
---
Why can't we have both?
---
To alter
---
Well let's say you don't take a medkit in game, there is about a difference of just 2 seconds while 1 uses 2 perk slots and the other just uses 1 perk slot ;)
---
You‚Äôre playing in the day and he‚Äôs playing at night
---
Google closet cosplay please...
---
If the killer downs you near the exit gate, why on earth wouldn‚Äôt they take you further away from the gate? All this change does give the .1% chance to let you get a painfully slow and boring escape if you fulfill very specific requirements:
---
1. The killer doesn‚Äôt Mori you
---
2. The exit gates are actually open
---
3. The opened exit gate is within 60 second crawling distance
---
4. Your DS hasn‚Äôt been used previously during the match
---
In every other scenario, all this change does is pointlessly drag out the last moments of the game
---
I disagree. All it would do is delay the game another 60 seconds if someone were to get the Kobe because of the ‚ÄúAnti-tunneling perk‚Äù.
---
As a killer main i approve this
---
Maybe it automatically used all 3 attempts and if you run out, you just die
---
Yeah small player base. I always see the same people in high ranks
---
I recently opened up a discussion on this and pretty much everyone in that discussion disliked self-care
---
A summary of what i learned from my post is that: Iron Will makes it harder to be spotted, Self-care is a waste of time, and make the most of resilience until you can find a teammate. And apparently there's a killer meta of countering healing, so healing perks are looked down upon
---
But i still kinda like it... it depends on how you use it. So preference i guess
---
Coding the ability to reconnect to a game is not as easy as just "do it 4head." BHVR is just barely getting used to using servers instead of p2p, I doubt we see a reconnect option anytime soon.
---
as much as i‚Äôd love that it‚Äôs too much to ask for them to make 4 separate chase songs for one killer
---
also... her shirt is not "tied"
---
I MSG THE SURVIVORS BEFOREHAND TO GIVE ME 6 TRAPS FOR FARM
---
Good Doctor players that have the timings down can already use the shock to great effect and catch survivors in chases with it, due to the 2.5-second interaction denial. Doc's underrated, just needs Mouldy Electrode.
---
And with the rework, this promises the potential to become quite obnoxious, or even oppressive. Not having to change stances means you will be able to attack earlier after shocking. It also means you are constantly moving at 4.6m/s, rather than 4.4. And then Horvath also mentioned that they've increased the range on the base shock, which means that you likely won't anymore need add-ons to use shocks effectively in chases - add-ons which have the downside of increasing the charge time. So if they won't introduce other cooldowns or increase base charge time or such, all of this combines to make shocks an even more potent chase tool.
---
This "rework" to me sounds promising from a killer perspective, and frightening from a survivor perspective.
---
Its both
---
Or you could not be boring and want everyone to play the exact same way and let people play how they want ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Is this meant to be under the shitpost tag?
---
The strength of unbreakable
---
Deliverance, unbreakable, decisive, + exhaustion perk is my personal favorite combo.
---
Literally happened to me earlier. Wasn‚Äôt even looking for the guy and he ran around the corner and basically stabbed himself on my knife. Immediately I got the message telling me that ‚ÄúI suck‚Äù and to ‚Äúget good.‚Äù
---
Damn... that‚Äôs a lot of downvotes. Whew.
---
Well you wouldn't want to just remove the abilities and call it good. There would be balancing/tweaks with the perks and adjusted stats to be equal across all killers (nurse speed increased to make up for lost blink, etc).
---
The bing bong‚Äôs bonk of infinite salt
---
I say GG if it was a good game. Judging by your rank v theirs and scores/result, it wasn't a GG.
---
Just ignore the message and/or leave the game??? Nobody‚Äôs forcing you to farm
---
Actually I play really late at night typically....
---
All the comments above me are Devotion 1 Killer mains
---
That's true, the Hag is the auto-camper... I hate it but it's that much sweeter when I can escape her.
---
OR! And hear me out here.... stop telling others how to play the game and let people enjoy it the way they enjoy it!
---
...so NOED.
---
The 4th tier challenges are really hard overall. Like, I get it, but also, fuck this
---
I convinced two to let me do it. The other two were asses about it so I just had to get them normally then the two that helped just stepped into the basement and let it happen
---
i figured DCing means the challenge considers it not your responsibility to hook those ones?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecja9m/when_will_dc_penalty_come_to_ps4/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It would work perfectly with his current animation set too if you think about it
---
personally i see it more like you getting one of those really hard to catch survivors and then getting a chance to catch them.  i still would like to see jason but, ah, the rights.
---
Both, though not all killers have powers that lend themselves well to altered utility. I fail to see how this is an issue.
---
Unbreakable is devastating in some situations
---
His power to me seems like blood lust on crack
---
Yep. not usually one for slugging but I had to in that situation. Literally dropped the guy onto the floor with it tool
---
whats it matter since ure obviously playing it on the throne anyway, just play vita or 3ds til u get a match
---
\+5000 points for escape though...
---
I like it but it makes her look like a white sombra from OW
---
don't forget he [blinks](/intensifies)
---
This is true, he may have not been confident. Even still face-camping does not help him improve his chases or kills. It literally does nothing but net a few blood points and chill the salt levels. 
---
I still do not believe there is any reason to face-camp like this because even just patrolling the immediate area is more beneficial than chainsawing to the face. You will never get better from this, you have the ability to give a few chases and stop an escape, doing this literally ends your game and shows me that you had a tough time and needed to grab one pity kill. 
---
There is no right and way to camp because there is no right way to play this game. Sure, go ahead and face camp all the hooks, you wont get better and you'll stick around the rank 10 mark forever.
---
NINTENDO SWITCH PLAYERS PLEASE LISTEN. IF SOMEONE GETS HOOKED GO FUCKING GET THEM AND STOP LETTING TEAMMATES STRUGGLE ON FIRST HOOK. HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE TIME!
---
Tf is dark senses that‚Äôs so bad
---
My insanity level is tier three after seeing this
---
Ahh that sucks really wanted to play the Switch version more since it was portable.
---
THE GAME JUST FUCKING KICKED ME OUT AND I GOT A PENALTY!
---
So it IS fair to those of us getting punished for the game crashing?
---
Isn't laurie just your average 80s teenager so actually don't need much effort at all ?
---
If you hadn't read it yet it teases something pretty nice.
---
I'm in the same boat my man. Way grindy, but I've reserved myself to get as far as I can and avoid buying the next one unless it's toned down.
---
I mean don't get me wrong, if you make any progress the free cosmetics outweigh the cost of the pass, but then you lose the choice.
---
Haven‚Äôt seen it yet no spoilers but I‚Äôm excited
---
I only bought the sweater, I wasn't feeling the tights and the hat, but the sweater is cute and it still jingles
---
I got the 4th Charm and it fucking caught me off guard cause it blinks.
---
I won't spoil it then lol
---
It's not my fault they were too good for me when you're let's say training someone you just don't be an ignorant cunt you provide them feedback as in what they did wrong and how to improve that this was the situation for me in this case. And for what I'm concerned they gen rushed and like found the totem in 5 secs again not my fault.
---
It's literally the equivalent of putting on an airplane jacket, hiding your face and saying you're legion/ace/david
---
It sounds super beginner friendly though! If your chase lasts for 90 seconds and you finally land a hit you get rewarded for it. It can be really rough for baby killers out there- you either learn to end the chase quickly or you get rewarded by sticking with it. 
---
At the end of the day, you do ***not*** get away from Jason. 
---
But for higher ranks I could see it not being popular
---
Agreed but it would‚Äôve suited Nea more
---
I actually like Meg's new outfits though. It is finally not a sport outfit, so I am happy :D
---
Who hurt you?
---
Lazy dev team
---
Yeah, I am actually having some difficulties finishing tier 3 to be fair, I just looked at tier 4 and I was like fuuuuuck
---
PC has more by far
---
You can still medium vault and this would only apply to window fast vaults so you still get the fast slide. I feel like this is something that sounds harsh but if applied wouldn't be so bad. You still get the sprint burst from getting hit, and still have your exhaustion perks.
---
Oni has the same Chase potential has Billy when his power is up. He just has a little less cause he has to get his power while Billy can flick his on or off. Huntress can potentially end loops but if the wall is high enough, she cant hit Survs over them. Shes slower than Oni too so I'd say Oni is still better in some situations compared to Huntress. The Loop Factor between them is situational but Huntress is better in a straight away run most of the time but if Oni has his power, he might be better in a Straight Away run. Plus if you're injured in chase, you can juke a Huntress and hide and have a better chance of escaping compared to Oni who you cant hide from when injured since he can constantly see your blood drops through walls
---
At no point in the movie does she have her shirt tied I think you should rewatch it
---
Legion can stab you exactly where it will do the most damage (major organs and blood vessels) which will cause serious bleeding that needs fixing. Oni just hits you with probably a dull blade without caring how and where it hits you, just that it hits you
---
&gt; skip a whole a whole state
---
Us Killer-mains thank you &lt;3
---
Maple King is the common add-on that let you see your shock range.
---
Obedience - Carter‚Äôs Notes was the exhaustion status add-on.
---
Is the Iridescent King changing, or is obedience changing? I doubt they‚Äôd just change maple knight to be iridescent when they already have a piece with a good effect (all ailments tied to shocks). 
---
Also, it seems to be that the new iridescent Queen is inheriting the leaked power we saw on the scrapped tape earlier when his changes slipped through in text. Curious now as to how they‚Äôll adjust scrapped tape then, it‚Äôs terrible in its current state of it remains as is
---
if it means saving my team i‚Äôll gladly take the tunnel
---
taking perks that are only better than the ones i would use regularly during the EGC is playing to lose. you are saying "they will get every gen done and i need to bust my ass in the last minute or two of the game" which is a losing mindset. also what i jured survivors? the moment they have the gates open or at 99 and see you get a down they will heal in some hidey hole then sneak their way to the hook then once they've got that unhook, they're as good as out
---
5 bucks on it being in March
---
Lol no one. I just think survivor is way too easy with all the powerful tools they have. Like I said above I stopped playing when pig was new and came back only to rise straight to red ranks. I don't consider myself good enough to be up against a competent killer though. Thus I shouldn't be red rank
---
Hard to do that with a single building and a bunch of tiles in each one
---
what you just described is every bubba‚Äôs strategy for every game
---
but then I'm a toxic noed killer
---
I CANT FIND A FUCKING MATCH AS RANK 20 KILLER IVE BEEN WAITING 20 MINUTES FUCK
---
It be like that üòí
---
Lay it on me üòâ
---
Is there even going to be one? I thought they said they were holding off on events, and just doing bloodhunts for now, while they fix bugs and stuff.
---
Ever get that feeling that you want to out your hand through the monitor screen to reach to one of those pricks neck that does that shit only to **snap it**?
---
Wierd isn't it?
---
But he‚Äôs still a pip machine
---
At worst tier 4 is mildly grindy outside of the 3 that are genuine challenges. I don‚Äôt know why everyone is pretending it‚Äôs so hard
---
What a good girl. I find hag oddly adorable and I can‚Äôt even be mad at her for eating my liver.
---
Might be CPU related. I have ryzen 2600 and im stuck at 62 fps.
---
Some buildings have different window spawns ever game they should just expand into that
---
Are you trying to unhook outside killer's Terror Radius?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecjkql/so_my_game_crashed_at_the_loading_screen_and_i/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
With how much has changed towards pallet placements, vacuum pallets and tile placements making it so survivors cannot fast vault when injured is overkill and will just promote survivors to linger near main buildings and toxic set ups because getting hit will pretty much mean gg .
---
You already have to hit fast vaults from a certain angle and survivors get punished with a hit if they eff up that vault, also hitboxes through windows anyway should be factored.
---
You know how boring that would be right?
---
I respect that, it's a good strat. The comic is not about that, its about toxic players calling tunneler post game, even tho they were blatantly doing dumb sh*t in the killer's face XD
---
The video I used is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pshlJLOeX7k), because it dates to *after* all the flashlight changes of the past.
---
If they spot you *and* hit you, then I'm sorry but your timing *is* an issue. There is *nothing* the killer can actively do to avoid a flashlight save if you're in the right position and have your timing down pat. If they can hit you, your timing was off. If they can avoid the blind, your timing was off.
---
To give you a better chance, either stick to another survivor like glue or start running Empathy. When someone gets injured, start shadowing them and think about positioning - you want to be hidden, but able to get into the killer's POV during their moment of weakness. After that it's just a question of pointing and shooting.
---
If you still can't get the timing right, then you can fudge it by hiding behind a hook and popping out to blind the killer when they start the hooking animation - it'll still count as a blind while the killer is carrying a survivor.
---
But you're not forced to play either survivor or killer. You can complete a tome without doing every challenge by taking the path with the challenges you want.
---
To be fair, you can at least combat it by crouching to the hooked survivor. It‚Äôs balanced because the hooked survivor usually runs and triggers her trap. So at least it‚Äôs balanced unlike face camping.
---
[It's in your head](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Movement_Speeds).
---
Yeah, some of the challenges are still pretty annoying. Thank god for the rank reset, going up against noobier survivors made some of them much easier. 
---
RN I'm trying to do the "heal 3 survivors in one match" but these idiots keep running away from me after I unhook them, even when it's abundantly clear that the killer is nowhere nearby. Fkn dunderheads.
---
Exactly. That is OP's original point. Survivors feel stale because there's nothing unique about any of them. They're just skins, nothing more. Boring.
---
Honestly, after Demogorgon and Oni, giving it to all killers is now kinda a necessity. Any survivor can tell if its Demogorgon or Oni the instant they get a heartbeat, even if they don't see the killer, because of their unique music cues. In theory the same holds true for Mike but Mike's tiny T1 radius usually means it'll be either someone getting stabbed, Mike getting spotted stalking, or Mike levelling up that'll reveal his identity.
---
Make no mistake this will still be a cool addition, and I'm looking forward to when Amanda gets her music.
---
Not being able to fast vault? Are you serious? That would make chases feel one sided and would end them super fast.
---
That looks amazing! I love closet cosplays. Always fun to see what you can do with what you have!
---
Survivor main here. Can confirm.
---
This Nerf would essentially mean that injured survivors were permanently affected by the Afterpeice Tonic. I'm happy for you that you are so amazing at the game that you feel you need a handicap, but if this change happened no one would ever escape. If you really need things to be harder just use No Mither.
---
Are you serious? Is that an actual challenge?
---
Don't you lose progress or items if you just complete a tome entirely?
---
You have a point. Maybe this kind of a change but keeping the ability to fast vault would be enough? I'm just thinking of a way to make the game longer tbh. Cause against a good team of survivors even with ruin or the plague's perk you still can get all the gens done in under 10 minutes easy.
---
What the fuck lol
---
I joined during late October, sad I will not experience it as well :((
---
sounds like a killer main who doesn't even understand survivor gameplay and just wants easy wins
---
It‚Äôs designed to be grindy, like most battle passes. It‚Äôs supposed to last you through the entire season, which I‚Äôm pretty close to. I am about at the point where I‚Äôll make it if I level up once per day.
---
They hope people will buy tiers if they don‚Äôt finish lol
---
Other then the fact that survivors dont need to feel unique since killers are, if you find survivor boring, play killer, or dont play at all
---
The red one is really nice, from the outfit with the crop top and skirt.
---
I'm probably going to buy this outfit, minus the hair.
---
Dont you mean 2 states as we can pick ourselves up an indefinite amount of times.
---
Do enlighten me.
---
If they are childish and toxic in end game chat, yeah, I feel you bro :'D
---
&gt;had he left the area and tried to stop the others from escaping he may have gotten another kill during the chase
---
This doesn't happen. If the gates are open/99% and they haven't left yet, they're either healing at the gate or trying to unhook the survivor. Camping was the smartest option here.
---
I cant beleave you would tunnel him like that, why do killers play like this!?!?!
---
What? No you can go back if you want
---
First of all the chases should be one sided for the killer. It is a 4v1 after all. Secondly someone else convinced me that maybe it was going a bit too far with the fast vault never happening considering they got changed to require a specific angle already. So I would think that allowing fast vaulting but keeping the other things could be more fair. What you think about that?
---
Thank you!!!! May I ask how I can tell who gives me the medals? Is there like a notification somewhere? cause previous posts I never knew who to thank T_T!!
---
After an update from steam its stuck at 62fps now lol
---
Pretty sure you can turn off the frame cap somewhere in files

Inner Strength is in my perma meta build for Claudette
---
YES. I played DBD today and it automatically killed me because i was the last survivor, i think it's garbage.
---
To be fair I wouldn‚Äôt get too hyped for Amanda yet, as they didn‚Äôt specify whether it‚Äôd be happening to licensed killers too or not. I‚Äôd lean towards not, though if any of them did it‚Äôd probably be Pig seeing as the license holders seem more lenient.
---
Oh. I thought if you complete a tome you don't get anything from it.

No he was right in Front of us
---
They aren't training you? You aren't even at their rank. The result of the game was evidence of that. Saying GG would have been a polite lie. Nobody owes anyone a GG.
---
You can't attempt to escape off of the hook after the first phase anyway.
---
The whole point is that they want to encourage people to play both sides rather than just sticking to a main
---
I‚Äôve been robbed of many grabs due to shitty dedicated servers.
---
&gt;No he was right in Front of us
---
Which killer was it?
---
Then don't complain about NOED.
---
Someone else convinced me that removing fast vaults to injured survivor would be a step too far. My point is that I'm not a good survivor in any sense of the word and it doesn't feel like I did anything special escaping. Sometimes it does but most of the time it doesn't.
---
No you can go complete the tome and do the challenges you didn‚Äôt do if you want later
---
Wait... He runs nemesis and **most likely** pwyf, why the hell would he play like this then??? Y i k e s
---
To be fair, getting hit with any of the killers weapons in this game realistically would cause deep wounds incapable of just walking off
---
Yes and no.
---
Devs need to fix their game. We've been on and on about Operation Health for a while now and it still *needs* to happen. 
---
Still, if the game crashes 5 times in one night for one player, that player probably shouldn't continue ruining everyone elses' game.
---
We had that with every killer now
---
Maybe actually provide some evidence to back up yhe claim that everyone thinks Spirit is overpowered. Because last I checked, Spirit was nerfed to appease the rampant bitching and moaning of survivors. And yeah, the emblem system is busted, but I'm saying that I have no trouble escaping vs Spirit at all, provided the killer doesn't tunnel or camp (which would give anyone issues regardless of the killer). And of you don't think rank matters, than why even bring up players dropping weak killers in favor of strong killers at high ranks? And I wouldn't have bragged about being "Rambo as survivor" if I thought you wouldn't immediately accuse me of being a biased killer main.

Wolverine never quits.

I had a clutch 4% end game ill have to post it

1st hook with basement trapper, not impossible

Beginner friendly sure but if he would practically be unplayable at high ranks
---
Cause the entity gave oni a dull ass sword so he just says fuck it and pulls out the big stick

HIT DETECTION TRASH
---
*COLLISIONS TRASH*
---
*[GAME NOT LETTING ME STRUGGLE TRASH](/intensifies)*
---
It is way too grindy. You can't realistically complete it if you have more than a 9-5 job and if DBD/gaming isn't one of your main activities outside of that.  
---
I won't have an issue finishing it myself, I'm currently on tier 61 but I was also able to play about 60h in the last two weeks because I had days of and a rather light schedule in general.
---
True I'm not good with killer but I'm not a killer main in the slightest. I play survivor way more and understand against most killers aside from ones with their very best addons I should be escaping. Though I was convinced by someone else that removing fast vaulting was a step too far so I think that keeping fast vault but doing the other things could be fair.
---
We can't all be as amazing as you, obviously
---
Where are the changes??? I cant find them anywhere
---
You have to sacrifice 4 survivor, the last survivor will always quit while you are carrying him at the hook
---
I remember getting chased by the trapper in my first game of DBD, no idea where to go or why, nearly having an anxiety attack from the heartbeat and music! I thought you were just supposed to run in a straight line lol, no clue about pallets or looping. My friends thought the same. We were all so bad but I had so much more fun then than I do now! :)
---
It‚Äôs not servers. This same thing where you get hit by head on after you begin opening a locker happens on console too
---
I went on to Survive that trial too. :)
---
The 4% !
---
As someone who plays wraith a lot u have to agree with you
---
Not always, if you feel like you've found someone you'd think would dc then hook them first and leave the more immersed players till the end
---
Of course she needs a white knight to protect her, why don't you put on a bathrobe backwards, grab a knife and call yourself closet cosplay myers so you two match
---
Lovely &lt;3
---
Professional Meat Shield...love it! GG
---
Really wish I read the start of that post before reading all of it.
---
Yep.
---
Sorry Charlie killer is much more fun, plus you didn't' have to worry about teammates who do nothing but crouch the whole game.
---
Someone put it over a last second RBT removal in a video and it was really intense
---
You'll lose out on extra BP and rift fragments if you only play one side but all 4 levels have been layered out that you can reach the end by only playing 1 side.
---
Everybody may ve willing to dc and I can't know who is, but think it as you want
---
I wish the devs didn't encourage this type of playstyle with these rift challenges
---
that's fucking stupid.
---
Face camping and chainsawing the David on first hook doesn't make sense by any metric. Low emblem points for a first hook death, no late downs on any of the other survivors because they see the facecamp and just leave. From a bloodpoint perspective, you get 1 sacrifice, but avoid downs and hooks on saving players that would have given you more. From an emblem perspective, 2 deaths with 1 first hook is almost a guaranteed depip. Camping him isn't going to do anything to change that. And from just a skill perspective, camping to get 1 kill isn't the way to get better at the game. At this point you're depipping, why not do what you can to get better? 
---
Also this billy is pretty clearly not confident with his chainsaw or had it in for David, because he had the Feng in no mans land when she tried to body block for the David at the gate. Easiest chainsaw of that Billy's life, and he just ran around her to try to get the m1. This camp wasn't "strategic".
---
I did the same thing on my very first match. 4 gens left and I crouched around so far looking for the hatch lmao
---
I haven't gotten any revelations entries because i've been storming the killer tree (and finished in 2 hours), so please spill the beans
---
I hope we never get dedicated servers honestly. (PS4)

Why Nea though, stellar nevertheless &lt;3
---
Thanks üòÖ
---
Devs need to play their own game and at higher ranks as well ...
---
Baby Dwight role play.
---
Yeah it worked so well.
---
I can see it being objectively better for the designated juker, but for other roles on the team it sounds like self care is still too versatile to ignore. Those teammates are unlikely to have Adrenaline - plus it frees up a prove thyself rush (resilience too if the juker joins in).  I've been to rank 1 multiple times but I usually don't run the killer around, so maybe I just lack perspective.
---
Honestly it's just a terrible idea for a challenge.
---
Shirtless David escaping üí™
---
It sucks but it‚Äôs fair what happened. Slugging is the equivalent to gen rushing. It feels really shitty on both sides but there always needs to be a counter that can flip a match like that.
---
I was gonna let him go as the 2 of the other teammates were farming him
---
Thank you. Me, 400 üòÖ
---
Wat
---
Who would choose fucking bloodpoints over awesome challenges and lore
---
How did u manage the dark sense task. As a Soloplayer this seems hard
---
I actually came across a guy who did the same thing, except in the second panel it was jumping into a locker around the corner from where I was walking. We weren't even in chase and I would not have looked his way unless I saw the notification
---
The best play for what? You're depipping for a 2k with a first hook death, you're getting 0 bloodpoints because no one will try to save, and you're not getting better at the game while also looking like a bit of a jerk. A soft patrol is definitely a strategic play at certain points, but a facecamp is never the right play.
---
Just cause she is usually the meme for being cocky, good at looping XD
---
Oh wait a second you ARE the cosplayers, how convenient that you start existing when the cosplayer does, you insult her to build up that karma and self pity cause you're pathetic and just need quick compliments. Then seeing me call you out you switch to defending yourself on both accounts to see more legitimate, did I get that all right?
---
The mistake here is refusing to down the other player who's bodyblocking. At this point he's being vindictive and dumb against a player who may very well have DS.
---
And thats when Bing Bong boi decided not to be a simple brutal or ruthless killer, he equips a shiny brand new ebony mori and head on into another trial.
---
I had the literal opposite when attempting that tome challenge
---
I went against a killer doing the challenge earlier today and he almost got it, but the last survivor dc‚Äôd when he was downed. 
---
I felt *so* bad for the killer
---
Same I haven't see any of that either... but that sounds like it will make for interesting characters.
---
I‚Äôve tried it twice and as soon as the first Survivor sees Iron Grasp and realises i‚Äôm heading to the basement they‚Äôve dc‚Äôd.
---
If you think it's fun as Billy, you should try it with Oni. Same exact feeling but replace the chainsaw rev with a "RUAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHA" and going super saiyan
---
...literally how is it that player‚Äôs fault? The game randomly crashes on loading screen for EVERYONE, RANDOMLY.
---
1)To stay in red ranks people need to score high enough to not get deranked, so by design people won't get too low K ratio with any killer on red ranks;  
---
2)Red ranks are not really the highest mark, they should make a Grandmaster League or something like that (though I think everyone agrees that the rank system needs work). Seeing that Scott one 4k'd 32 times in a row on Leatherface with speed limiter means that red ranks are not generally good enough to make bad characters unplayable without deranking.
---
It‚Äôs forsure Waldo. Where‚Äôs Waldo, not wally
---
Not only do you get robbed but sometimes it‚Äôs to your detriment. Like a pallet grab and it fucks up and they end up on the other side which prolongs the chase
---
I like this
---
It actually sounds like the Saw chapter, what with a detective survivor and a pig related killer, 'cept the detective is fem and the killer feeds people to pigs
---
I more so meant I don't see a problem with the face camping after the last gen pops (aside from the salty chainsaw). Once David gets off the hook the killer definitely makes a lot of mistakes.
---
Voice chat is better than any perk survivors can take
---
Teacher:*speaks fluently french*

Le me: "Oui"

Please let me know what you think!! :)

Any French speaker have an English translation?

true
---
I think it's a pushed stereotypes, claudettes though, they're so toxic.
---
Images you can hear - part 4
---
Goodb ye
---
This looks like the movie poster of Sicario 2 which is an amazing film by the way. Good work.
---
Lol I‚Äôm still lost in Hawkins Lab and the Game. Not having a sense of direction irl definitely carried into this game
---
Actually not entirely. I see what you mean but feeding corpses to pigs is actually a popular/efficient method of getting rid of bodies. So I picture a pretty intelligent killer then.
---
Wasn't he an ultra skilled samurai in the lore or something ?
---
PC players outweigh Console players so by default PC has the biggest player base.
---
He's being a dick. I have every right to point out a dick
---
I feel the same way. With Kids, a full time job and other requirements I don't have enough time to play. I'm hoping the winter event if we get one will lower the XP requirement for each tick for the rift. Make it so we can progress faster outside the challenges.  Right now my only hope is I can get the serum to get two skins.
---
Ah yes me and the survivor can listen to Frank‚Äôs tunes such as demonic screeching and radio static
---
Well as u/Gruffin77 said, feeding bodies to pigs is efficient at disposing of murder victims, and there's always some trope of detective x fucked up murderer, so there's that too. Would be cool to have Hannibal as a killer though
---
Left behind already got a rework. It's okay now.
---
&gt; had he left the area and tried to stop the others from escaping he may have gotten another kill during the chase
---
Obviously the possibility exists, but the odds are not in his favor here
---
I mean I did bill but I‚Äôm not doing that shit again just a big ass waste of time IMO even thought the cosmetic you get is badass
---
&gt;If the killer downs you near the exit gate, why on earth wouldn‚Äôt they take you further away from the gate?
---
Because you potentially have DS, and picking you up is risking it right then and there.
---
I think those situations should be allowed to happen.
---
I don't think there is a game than can replace dbd, so I suggest you find some other game. Also don't just ask the devs, make it happen. Hell, you can ever create a propaganda, we survivors surely get every killer nerfed a few days after release. Have a voice!
---
You could be bugged, after 10 minutes I would just restart the game to make sure. 
---
But queues can be very long during low population hours.
---
Wow how rude freakin tunnelers. Glad the truth is coming out lol üòã great comic!
---
I've seen more toxic Claudettes, but pink Neas are a whole new level of toxic.
---
I use the 3rd one so it's in the left slot, closer to my m1 progress bar, but to each their own
---
Pig is now able to be mori'd by survivors
---
stopped reading once i saw deep wounds was changed to multiple skillchecks and if you miss one you die. Imagine how many times you fail level 3 madness snap out of it checks, now you get put into dying for fucking it up.
---
You honestly may as well just do a gen for the one minute if its like that.
---
Yes less people dc, more people suicide on first hook. Different way to get to the same outcome - leaving game early.
---
So then what is the killers ability to get around those with DS and were hooked near an open gate? I‚Äôm all for this, but not if it gives a survivor an escape that I can‚Äôt prevent as a killer. Survivor with DS basically has invincibility for 1 min in this situation. And if it wasn‚Äôt near the gate it would just be a min long wait if I slug them.
---
Asking for hook escapes at that time is basically saying I should have a 4% chance, or higher if you‚Äôre running deliverance, to get a free escape or just waste everyone‚Äôs time. This screws over a killer‚Äôs potential 4K and has no counter play. If you want the BPs, you‚Äôll get more BP long term by getting into the next game quicker.
---
Yeah but even something original would have to go through the license holders to get approved. And yeah even the first official Saw game couldn‚Äôt get Hello Zepp so I know that‚Äôs probably not gonna happen.
---
Its not about the time hooking other people, its about the amount of time when you were unhooked. So I was unhooked less than a minute before.
---
Never go on a kill mission without your tunes.
---
I don't understand this "hey mom" meme. Can someone explain?
---
Well, by your rules they can criticize this billy for camping then, since this video seems to be from before they implemented the endgame colapse.
---
Go Youtubers! I was very excited to see the community asking for this and now that it is happening I have a lot more faith in the developers. I might get stabbed through a window 4 seconds after I've vaulted it by stretchy arm killers, but I'll do it in style with dope custom chase music! Go BHVR!
---
I haven't even tried to do the ones that are challenging. All I'm saying is that the vast majority are simply grindy
---
Yeah, my bad. I forget it was called Iridescent King
---
Doesn't this reddit have rules against non english stuff?
---
I agree, and this was an issue with the last Tome *and* it‚Äôs an issue with certain achievements (such as the Adepts). They require a lot from the killer, and a survivor dc‚Äôing can literally rob them of their progress. It‚Äôs stupid as shit. I have the challenge, just got it with Trapper, but I was more paranoid about being robbed by a DC than thinking I wouldn‚Äôt get it because I misplayed.
---
Oni keeps it dull so it hurts more when it goes in.
---
so, a normal game then? T\_T
---
That's always the most demoralizing, when they all pop at the same time and you go from "okay still 5 gens left I might have a  \*POP POP POP\* OH GOD THE GAMES HALF OVER ALREADY"
---
Thank you! Might have to try using Empathy just to get this out of the way. And when I mentioned the timing I meant about the timing during the pickup animation. Obviously the killer spotting me before they pick up is an issue in itself.
---
&gt; You can't realistically complete it if you have more than a 9-5 job and if DBD/gaming isn't one of your main activities outside of that.
---
I work a standard 40 hour week, have a gf who has a kid, and yeah this is pretty true. I have 3 central hobbies and DBD is one of them.
---
This is why DBD's ranking system is trash. People only go up in rank and rarely ever go down in rank, and are only bottom rank if they come back to the game after a long break or are new to the game.
---
Yeah, of course, if they were to do licensed chase music, Freddy and Leatherface would probably be the ones that are going to be skipped.
---
I'm just seeing it as the licensed chapters that got cosmetics will be the ones where there will be a possibility, at least.
---
SOMETIMES PEOPLE MAY MINIMIZE BAD SHIT TO OTHERS, BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT MAKE YOU REALIZE YOU ARE ONLY HUMAN. 
---
IT'S OKAY TO FEEL BAD FOR YOURSELF, BUT IT'S NOT OKAY TO BLAME YOURSELF FOR IT.
---
ONLY THOSE WHO DO NOTHING MAKE NO MISTAKES.
---
It‚Äôs wayyy better now but still not good in almost every game I play the hatch is closed instantly before I even have a chance to find it so I mean it‚Äôs usable but it‚Äôs low tier and definitely bill‚Äôs worst perk
---
He basically says that if you run this perk you're useless for your team and to not run it
---
Sound gets broken again
---
He might not want to bait people however. Maybe he‚Äôs fine with just two kills. He might have been looped the entire game and knows he‚Äôll be out matched if David is unhooked. Camping during endgame as killer is a fine strategy just as any other and you shouldn‚Äôt be judging him negatively or any end game killer for just wanting a sacrifice or two.
---
I did it as Trapper on first try, and I still agree with you. The whole time I was more paranoid about a survivor leaving than I was thinking that I would misplay. In theory, it‚Äôs difficult but doable, but DCs should count towards the challenge. It‚Äôs not fair how it is a killer challenge that puts so much power in the hand of the survivor.
---
This was an issue with challenges in the last Tome and it‚Äôs an issue with certain achievements. It is shitty design on BHVR‚Äôs part that you have killer challenges/achievements that can be ruined by a survivor taking two seconds to leave a game. That isn‚Äôt fair at all.
---
Awesome way to show just how toxic tunnelers are!!! :))üòÇüòÇüôè i really hope they bring back vacuums and give billly 110% OWOüò¢üò¢

It's an image though :)))

REWORK RANKING SYSTEMS AGAIN. DON'T PUT IT BACK TO HOW IT WAS, BUT CHANGE IT AGAIN. IT IS TOO EASY TO PIP AND RANK UP AS A SURVIVOR AND TOO HARD TO DEPIP. THINK OF IT THIS WAY, IVE HAD THE ESCAPE 5 TRIALS CHALLENGE SINCE RANK RESET, AT RANK 5, I'VE ESCAPED ONLY TWICE, AND I'M RANK 4. CLEARLY I DON'T BELONG IN RED RANKS, BUT I'M STUCK HERE DESPITE PLAYING AWFULLY. I SUCK AT LOOPS AND CHASES, I GET DESTROYED. WHEN I PLAY AS KILLER AT RANK 16 AND GET PUT UP AGAINST RANK 9S AND 10S, THEY DO BETTER AT CHASES THAN ME AT RANK 4. IF WE WANT TO BALANCE THE GAME AROUND 50% ESCAPE RATE, WHICH WE SHOULD, WE NEED A BETTER RANKING SYSTEM. I DON'T MIND DERANKING IF IT MEANS I'LL GO UP AGAINST A KILLER I STAND A CHANCE AGAINST.
---
ALSO DON'T MAKE KILLERS HAVE TO 4K TO RANK UP. I'M NOT TOO SURE HOW KILLER RANKING WORKS SINCE I BASICALLY NEVER PLAY KILLER, BUT FROM WHAT I HEAR IS THAT THEY NEED A 4K TO PIP. PIP AROUND 2K. DOUBLE PIP 4K. AND BALANCE FROM THERE TO GET AN AVERAGE 50% ESCAPE RATE
---
I would expect console to outweigh PCs because they tend to be a lot more common than PCs. PS4 wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it was first.
---
r/TheCouncilOfAsh
---
The killer can potentially lose a pip at higher ranks. Killers have to play near perfect to get a pip in red ranks, so the difference between a 3k and 4K can mean the difference between a black pip or full pip. Unless the killer has a counter for things like DS, which can be used as invincibility frames, this would be unfair. I don‚Äôt agree with survivors escaping on RNG where the killer potentially can‚Äôt counter.
---
Keikaku means plan.
---
This was not my first match.
---
This was a long, long time after my first match.
---
So worst-case scenario, the same exact number of games are ruined as before.
---
More likely scenario: More people stick around and play games they normally wouldn't, and even if they suicide on their first hook, at least they're keeping the killer occupied for ~20-30 seconds and destroying a hook on their way out, making them more useful than the otherwise would have been.
---
No. Only foot lettuce.
---
so for the dark sense one you just need to be there when the gen is finished
---
So my strategy was to have bond and sprint burst. I'd run around, make myself aware of who was on what gens and how close they were to finishing. Then just made sure I was there when they did.
---
Oh thank you! I wish there was a seperate tab, and it wasn't like mixed with replies ;_;
---
Only when I play huntress, and even then I face a 4 man red rank swf while I'm rank 9.
---
Forfeiting all your BP just because the killer didn't pick you up within 5 seconds after downing you to cuck his 4K is the epitome of pettiness. 
---
Really my argument is against SWF when both know where hatch is, killer also knows where hatch is, killer downs the third while in sight of the 4th, and he chases the 4th, and the third DC's to open hatch. THIS is the situation that gets on my nerves as killer.
---
True, usually if it's a group. Solo claudeys are usually super innocent and cute &gt;.&lt;
---
The council will decide your fate
---
Yeah but it's not like replacing the assets in files with the Christmas decorated assets is that hard.
---
End game collapse
---
Jsyk, iirc the owners to the rights of leatherface outright came to the dbd devs for them to add him so they could be more lenient, but we'll have to see. Although I don't know much about the rights owners so maybe something could have happened.
---
Which is why I pointed out that you shouldn‚Äôt have to increase the games longevity and drag it out, the game design isn‚Äôt BUILT to last longer than it currently is. It shouldn‚Äôt have to make the game longer and DRAG it out, who wants to be forced to find parts before they can continue on a gen? That‚Äôs like stopping to do a gen simply because you found out there‚Äôs ruin and now you want to scour the entire map for it. Instead there should be a system to make it more UNIQUE without INCREASING THE TIME.
---
imagine bringing in items instead of just hoarding shit
---
Yeah they'll probably make it festive looking, but there probably won't be an event. From the leaks I saw, we might get a blood hunt from Jan 2nd - 6th.
---
That's fair.
---
That‚Äôs quite interesting and honestly doesn‚Äôt sound like such a bad idea.
---
Oof sorry man, I just tried to make my to;dr as conscie as possible, while the main topic as detailed as possible. üòÖ
---
Shouldn't Legion have 2 red add ons likw most killers?
---
Everyone is different but most Claudettes are irritating
---
That's not all the addons, just the reworked ones
---
Thanks for your input btw :D I like talking about this game but some people make it hard to say things without being ridiculed for it.
---
Who is missing that big ass madness skill check? Lol
---
Oh I see, in recent years The Winter solstice event has only been cosmetic changes with the assets. iirc they said no more game-changing events again, but I'll be pretty bummed out if they won't atleast add the Christmas lights
---
Good to know we're getting a blood hunt tho :)
---
Nice name
---
Better hope shes not running noed
---
As far as I know, sandbagging your teammate is doing anything to hinder their progress including but not limited to trapping them in a small area, bringing the killer to them on purpose, dropping pallets on other survivors, vaulting windows so someone being chased can‚Äôt etc. I‚Äôm not sure if this is correct but I‚Äôd hope so since I just passed 3,000 hours.
---
Personally I think beinf able to vault pallets should be a passive ability as we need more killers with multiple abilities like nightmare and Demogorgon as having multiple powers would make them more viable as high ranks and allow more strategy for the killer.
---
Nope it's Wally. Search "Where's Wally" it's his actual name
---
Wasn't accusing you, more of a warning.
---
Probably just some toxic survivor mains who feel satisfacted and Happy when killers can't do challenges even if they should
---
This is the most useless perk for Leatherface. A good Bubba knows to not leave the basement.
---
I like it as a meme, in an actual match I would break my keyboard.
---
What could the second reworked add on be?
---
Maybe allow legion to vault pallets without feral frenzy active?
---
Though it would probably requsome sort of downside.
---
&gt;This is why DBD's ranking system is trash. People only go up in rank and rarely ever go down in rank, and are only bottom rank if they come back to the game after a long break or are new to the game.
---
Also the new SWF algorithm (requested by killer players) removes brand new players from the rank 20 pool since they go straight to SWF lobby with their higher ranked friends.
---
I got mine fully done with legion üòÅ
---
I‚Äôm a pig main when i play killer and i can NEVER get them to boop my snoot :(
---
Yes, but he was also a dumbass who got in a lot of trouble because he just acted out of anger and didn't properly think through the consequences of his actions.
---
No problem! Just don't let negative comments get to you.
---
Because you stopped reading you didn't see what I have to say about this very thing in the bottom of the post. TL;DR the skillchecks aren't overcharge level and shouldn't be that hard to hit, they are more of a deterrent than a way to get downs.
---
you got me excited for a second. i was thinking we could use our own music as chase music and i really wanted to use the bennyhill music when i get in chase
---
I don't know. Vaulting pallets seems way too strong to be a passive and it will be hard to balance the power around that.
---
Yea this was happening to me yesterday. A Feng was doing a gen and I could never find her. Always made me waste time searching around gens. I probably had a total time of 2 minutes wasted looking for someone I could never find. She completed the match with second in points (idek how she died)
---
The damage 8 generators while using brutal.
---
Ayup. It's fucking stupid. The penalties are not enough as survivors are petty enough to consider it worth cucking your achievement.
---
We need DC husks so a survivor DC means you can still hook them.
---
You can "secure" a kill without having to be a dick and constantly smack the survivor on the hook
---
I got lucky with all the challenges and got some chill survivors, the only 2 i played normally for was the obsession one and the 25 hits. Other ones i just farmed \^\^
---
Oah i hope they get as eery as demogorgon and oni. Those sounds freak me out :D

Me: *sees username*
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture aswell
---
Oooooooh that cat meme
---
I got a 4K with billy last night, against an swf . After the game I say gg but this chick goes ‚Äúgg even you‚Äôre rank 2 and play dirty‚Äù
---
Naturally I was like wtf is she talking about?
---
I replied ‚Äúdirty? I thought I played quite fair actually‚Äù
---
She responds ‚Äúyou still trash get good‚Äù
---
All the while her profile says ‚Äúsave the salt‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hate Toxic people‚Äù
---
Fuckin dumb man, it didn‚Äôt go how they wanted so they all message me bullshit to try and shit on my win. ‚ÄúYou still trash‚Äù bitch if I‚Äôm trash why didn‚Äôt you escape? Why did I land every chainsaw and get a 4K. Gone tell me ‚Äúyou play dirty even though you‚Äôre rank 2‚Äù translation: I‚Äôm a crybaby entitled player and when shit doesn‚Äôt go my way I make up shit to be mad about and go out of my way to message others. Dumb cunt
---
he literally wasn't even being a dick.
---
saying "you're a douchbag. we don't want you, we hate you, you're not welcome here, delete the game" because someone doesn't want to help killers do challenges is a good example of someone actually being a dick
---
Or just run agitation + iron grasp with any killer and hope someone doesn't DC.
---
Hey, that's an insult to Satan. Satan likes parties.
---
Both sides bitch about everything, win or lose. I don't understand.
---
What other ability could be givin to legion?
---
Like I said earlier nightmare and Demogorgon are what every killer should having multiple powers instead of just 1 lame power. The only killers with only 1 Power that works well Is Spirit and Billy since their power can serve multiple functions so legion should he similar treatment.
---
i do sometimes with the doctor movement.
---
they could also start selling them or putting it into the battlepass. or maybe they‚Äôre already satisfied with recolors of recolors and recolors of charms being the filler content in the battlepass.
---
That's been my problem on Xbox. Every fucking game is a person D/Cing after one or two basement hooks.
---
Read between the lines and read his other replies. He's a dick. I was responding in kind. I hate assholes
---
Depipping and pipping doesn't matter. Sure, being tunneled is annoying, but I don't care about pipping. I just do what's best for the team.
---
The hook trick?
---
The Meg outfit looks horrible compared to the Kate one. The pants are awful.
---
Might be cuz most ppl are working and haven't had the chance to do the last tome.
---
Or don't run Spine Chill.
---
you're psychotic lmao
---
Some people (myself) really and truly care about rank. That‚Äôs sorta why i made this post I can‚Äôt stand losing pips just because some asshole had a bad day or can‚Äôt cope with losing
---
even the torso isnt that good. The hair could have been decent but they decided to say ‚Äúfuck my shit up fam‚Äù halfway through to make it ‚Äúunique‚Äù or whatever.
---
Wait.
---
Are you the same lady that make that cringy and disgusting "bad guy" animation? I personally dislike it with all my soul, but still i admire the dedication and who pro it ended. Also this post is good, good bless you madam.
---
The truth can be funny, I agree.
---
I got all the killer ones apart from the two basement challenges and The Trapper one (because I can't access that yet) just by playing normally. I just got assholes who refused to run around the map let alone hook them in the basement
---
cannibal for bbq
---
okay that's true. but it doesn't relate too much to what I said. usually it's the stealthy players **blendettes** that stop doing the gen when they get ruin. so they go and search for the totem instead. I'll do the gen, but my luck has me running the killer instead. so when all the other players are searching for ruin and I'm running the killer, nothing productive is happening.
---
If you make it apparent you are extremely proficient at using effective strategies, don't be surprised or salty when the killer takes measures to ensure he doesn't have to catch you more than once.
---
If you insist on leaving me slugged for minutes at a time just so you can get your sweaty 4k, I'll still dc as soon as I see the survivor t-bag (meaning they found hatch). I should not be penalised for you being unable to find the last survivor.
---
lol! i knew the title was sarcastic when i saw it. set messages to friends only
---
lol now i gotta check
---
That was awesome dude!
---
ah, but you an also big brain play coulorophobia like a madlad
---
GET ME INTO A FUCKING GAME WHERE MY RANK IS RELATIVELY THE SAME AS THE OTHER PEOPLE'S!!!!!!
---
Try learning Nurse on console at them ranks. Oh the messages you get from some people...
---
If they are camping while letting other survivors pop gens, they deserve to lose.
---
If they camp after the collapse has begun, they literally have no reason to leave the hook. If the survivor goes for the unhook without BT and gets killed, that‚Äôs on them, not the killer.
---
If you like farming go play farming simulator and get the fuck off dbd thanks
---
Could pull it into the MacMillan Estate realm maybe.
---
I assume english isn't your first language because I struggle to get what you mean. If I read everything correctly Legion should have more than one ability, a passive one atop of his normal one, like Freddy and Demogorgon. While this is a great idea and I would like to see it, I don't believe the devs will bother to give a complex rework like that to Legion because they already gave them one, if not two, and both were rushed and didn't properly address the problems with the character. As for killers with only one ability being weak, not necessarily. Huntress, Hag, Nurse, Myers, they are all simple killers yet very effective.
---
PS4 has it available on PS Plus so a lot of people got it for free, including myself. So that would give the chance of it really gaining a massive group of players. I‚Äôm not sure if Xbox ever added it as a free game but pretty sure it‚Äôs on the Game Pass program.
---
You can't get him with shards
---
Yeah its pretty stupid. I'm not looking forward to doing it.
---
Yeah, true, but he has thus far not been added to the Switch and mobile versions, so maybe something happened
---
Great suggestion, but a few weeks ago I bought bbq on the shrine. What do you like best about the Cannibal?
---
Maybe even give it to a prestige-3 to give a less cosmetic reason to prestige
---
Time to grind I guess
---
Why would you break the pallet there
---
Absolute retard
---
Fancy seeing you around here CuteC3. Loved your TF2 Animations.
---
Michaels mask doesn‚Äôt show emotion, should take the angry eyebrows off. Otherwise it‚Äôs awesome man
---
Just a little bit
---
Everybody is saying that the killer got what he deserved. But did you ever take into consideration that maybe the David did something toxic and made him want to facecamp?
---
Haven't played them enough so yeah your probably right.
---
Bruh, this is great. Keep up the good work OP, love your art style.
---
I'm aware
---
No, i'm just a guy who won't tolerate people being dicks anymore. You're just as bad as a dick as him, so get the fuck out of here and stop bothering me
---
I hate that perk... it's my bane, and I don't really know why someone would run it though unless you **really** want to protect that one chest
---
Z) Causes survivor head glitches.
---
MY FUCKING GOD BBQ ISNT OP
---
1.HIDE IN A LOCKER
---
2.GO IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN TURN BACK THE OTHER(DONE THIS MULTIPLE TIMES)
---
3.GO IN BBBQ RANGE
---
4.DISTORTION 
---
STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT PERKS THAT HAVE EASY COUNTERS
---
Frank always struck me as a harsh noise connoisseur.
---
Hahaha Boss fight!!!
---
Lmao, I love this!
---
You yourself don‚Äôt have to do them tho, at least the last dark sense challenge was the same wording, but to my understanding the perk will only have to proc 4 times, so four gens will have to be done in a trial by anyone, not just yourself, but I could be wrong though.
---
Infinite loading screens have been a problem for literal YEARS at this point. 
---
If you guys can't fix it or you can't detect when it happens as opposed to someone intentionally dc'ing don't even bother with this dc penalty system.
---
SMALL GAME SO FUCKING GOOD MAN! EVERYONE MAKES FUN OF ME FOR RUNNING IT, BUT THEY NEVER COMPLAIN WHEN RUIN GOES IN THE FIRST MINUTE.
---
AND GOD HELP THE POOR TRAPPER WHO GETS MATCHED AGAINST ME.
---
Literally every game when I play nurse and there are 4 survivors left within the endgame, I camp and tunnel to get the kill
---
Tomorrow will be literally my 1st anniversary of starting to play DBD,with 930 hours in and I still can't find my way around Hawkins
---
Run up to the killer, point to a hook. Most killers take that as an invitation to hook you. Then simply suicide on hook.
---
the neat thing is u have forever to do them. your chance to get archives pages are never lost, even when the next one begins
---
Update: Got some rather dull survivors who didn't play around BBQ or try to hide, so I got this with Nurse. Props to you getting it on your first try!
---
Grey rank (rank 20 to 17) have the worst queue times of all. It is normal. I've put on DBD before sat in queue (as rank 19). Launched a different game with dbd on the background. After 3 hours still no game.
---
Request a refund or wait for the devs to patch it. It can take a couple of months though.
---
It‚Äôs a little unusual but your meaning is clear! You could also say something like ‚Äúif they don‚Äôt let DCs count‚Äù. But I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it :)
---
Girl....chill
---
Voice chat beats multiple perks survivors can take.  I count over a dozen perks a good voice team gets over the standard solo que.  But no need to balance for SWF w/comms.
---
Lol accidentally. The rate they are going thatd be on purpose lol
---
Based on those, I think you might like The Nightmare. 
---
Freddy is fun, and one of the strongest killers. The dream snares can keep you from getting looped, fake pallets are incredibly satisfying, and the teleport lets you skip the walking around the map aimlessly looking for people.
---
Downside is that his perks are kind of a meme. If you want to buy a killer for perks, Bubba, Hag, or Clown would be my go-to.
---
Middle ground between perks and fun would probably be Spirit. She‚Äôs hard to play, but she‚Äôs quite fun, and both Spirit Fury and Hex Haunted are good perks, and even Rancor isn‚Äôt awful.
---
I suppose the *Rift closes in 20 days* thing is just lying then, huh? And so what? These challenges are still absurd. They shouldn't fucking take forever. They don't have to be done real easily, but the current ones we have are just sweaty and stupid.
---
&gt;the neat thing is u have forever to do them
---
Technically you only have 20 days.
---
THIS IS FUCKING INFURIATING, EVEN WHEN THE KILLER DC‚ÄôD I GOT A PENALTY, ITS NOT FAIR
---
I really love when that happens. Im both killer and survivor main and the only thing better than watching a toxic survivor being put on their place is putting them on their place yourself (specially as Ghostyboy so I can t-bag them :D)
---
i rarely use ds and none of my teammates had bt the killer (trapper) spawned right next to me and i chased him for a good minute before he got me. He then proceeded to tunnel me and completely ignore my urban evading teammates. I literally had no way of winning.
---
Does that actually work? Asking for a friend...
---
The hardest one was to spend time with your family
---
In my opinion they got scared by the backlash in both scenarios. In the original rework back in April they hurried up to fix the moonwalking, bleedout timer abusing Legion that had no counterplay and in order to appease the pitchfork wielding crowd of angry survivors they went suuuuuuper heavy on the nerfs to the point of being almost unplayable. All addons expect for 2, sketchbook for duration and ruler for cooldown, or maybe 3, irri button in a small map where you could actually reach survivors, were absolutely pointless and were either left unchanged or again rushed. FF movement speed was reduced because according to the devs being able to run 70 meters in one Frenzy would be crazy, because Hillbilly can't run around the entire map at 10x the speed infinitely with shorter cooldowns and can insta down, and vault speed was also reduced to again give survivors more counterplay. On top of that the bleedout timer stopped while in the killers terror radius, missing a swing resulted in losing all of your fucking power which I hate to this day because of random frame drops and auto aim, the cooldown when ending FF was increased and I can go on and on. Basically they butchered the Legion and made him boring for both sides. The newest changes which were made a few weeks ago if I recall correctly were also obviously botched and rushed in an attempt to counter the Nemesis exploit but still, I feel they are a buff and a good one too. Sure running pausing the bleedout timer sounds bad but Deep Wounds was already pointless after the original &lt;&lt;rework&gt;&gt; so actually expecting it to get downs is dumb. FF stabs not counting as basic attacks is a stupid change and one I really don't get, it didn't create any broken synergies or could be abused in any way. As for mending taking less time maybe that's the hardest part because your ability to make survivors waste time is less but on the other hand having more movement and vault speed makes it incredibly easy to chain hits and gives you a lot more map pressure.
---
what if its just every survivor with a flashlight taking turns blinding you forever
---
I'd say piggy and ghostface are probably the two most likely of the licensed killers.
---
So yeah... like I said, you got punished by your teammates and the killer. Solo queue is a lovely thing.
---
I've never heard any of my SWFs complain about this I'm confused tf
---
I got the 4 generator one in my first attempt, brought a toolbox did the first gen with another survivor. I had bond equipped, so I went to find the other survivors on their gens finsihed 2 more this way and then I did the last one with another survivor together. You dont need to do the gens from the beginning to the end, you just need to be on it when is actually finishes, so its not as hard as it looks. And I wasnt even in a SWF, if you play with your friends just tell them to 99% the gens and you finish them.
---
White Octane @_@
---
This so much. Farming is nice every now and again but I bought this game to play it. I'm so sick of being held hostage in M1 simulator.
---
Sacrificing four people in the basement is easy?
---
Whenever children want something most moms use to say "No, we have xyz at home", but in reality it's a shit tier version of the thing the kid actually wanted.
---
Just do the killer tree. It‚Äôs fucking easy. Then go back. They‚Äôll fix them in a week
---
I found out after the game ghosty boi was doing the grab survivors challenge
---
Oh my god I thought of the same thing! It'd be absolutely BONGERZ if we'd get focking Hannibal Lecter as killer and Clarice Starling as survivor
---
Is this a copypasta
---
THAT AIN‚ÄôT RUIN, THAT‚ÄôS YOUR COMPUTER.
---
SOUNDS LIKE A YOU PROBLEM.
---
I know it sounds nice but I dont think it would be an good idea. Everyone could pretty much effort to bring only the best stuff into every game and is that really what we want? Well I dont want that. :D
---
The Rift closes, but the tome challenges are permanent. The devs indicated that they didn't want people to miss out on chances to obtain the lore.
---
Okay? So? I was already aware of this. Besides the fact that half my friends don't even join my lobby when I invite them, that's still an annoying challenge that you have to go pretty far out of you way to do. The challenges should be more like the daily rituals. Maybe that's boring, but I don't care. At the very least, they need to remove this "Do in one trial" bullshit.
---
Beethoven dubstep
---
This community always finds a way to be toxic
---
Consistently wrong, judging from the comments anyway.
---
Oh wow, my mind is at ease, truly. 
---
The challenges are still batshit retarded.
---
I mean it's not fun getting tunneled, hooked, watch the killer stare at me for a minute, get unhooked and redowned in 5 seconds and rehooked or just left to bleed on the floor. There's literally not one fun part about that cause im just staring at my screen. I dont care if i lose (most of the time), but there are situations where its not about winning or losing and its just downright ridiculously frustrating and stupid and i would rather just move on to the next game instead of watching nothing happen for an entire match cause I cant even play.
---
The objective is not to get a 4k. I don‚Äôt know why people still tote this around like its true. It is not. The objective is to rank up/pip, which he wouldnt get above bronze in devout without killing the david. You can one hook a whole team because you got lucky in the first 2 mins. You get a 4k, but did you win? No you didn‚Äôt, because not only did you depip, but everyone else did as well. How is that a win? Also you will never catch up to a survivor after you M1 them during endgame collapse if they use the burst of speed the hit gives them and their exhaustion perk correctly.
---
go to therapy luv you need it xoxo
---
what? you said it was an easy change and i pointed out how other easy things that we come to expect are still not in the game. the fact that you think thats toxic shows how overused that word is. trust me that isn't anywhere close to toxic
---
FUCK THAT! WGLF NEEDS TO BE TOTALLY REVAMPED. THERE‚ÄôS ONLY SO MANY HOOKS IN THE GAME AND YOU‚ÄôRE NOT ALWAYS IN A POSITION TO BE THE UNHOOKER. SURVIVORS NEED ANOTHER +% BLOODPOINTS PERK THAT‚ÄôS BASED OFF ANOTHER OBJECTIVE.
---
LIKE DEJA VU. MAKE IT SO WHENEVER YOU WORK ON A GENERATOR THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED YOU GET CHARGES TOWARDS A BONUS 100% BP.  YOU GET A MINOR BENEFIT OF VISION AND INFORMATION (WHICH GENERATORS ARE 3GEN) AND YOU GET YOUR BONUS BP FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN UNHOOKING.
---
It doesnt look much like her in game or original movie outfit but as long as you are having fun thats all that matters.
---
likely same color as it is, black bg and white symbols
---
Cute. Like I said, leave me alone already dickhead
---
lol yeah no last minute heroine here
---
Not terrible but middle perk is BBQ and chilli and I think the abilities need a bit of a rework. Pretty good though!
---
DBD is one of the few games that I cant play with music. I know you mentioned playing it casually but even then I cant bring myself to play it with music. You will be singing along doing a gen then next thing you know you are getting grabbed by Myers. It would scare the shit out of me.
---
Why is everyone that plays this game so fragile and take everything so seriously?
---
God it's so true it hurts. Survivor mains=garuntee toxicity now a days.
---
And it's always nea that's toxic
---
Christmas music or my regular same 20 song playlist which includes pop.
---
People don't DC when being found. They DC after being downed. It takes 5-15 seconds to hook a downed survivor.
---
Ha! If they were here at launch maybe they would appreciate what they have. Sure, there‚Äôs no Christmas event, but it‚Äôs far from being the worst year in DBD history.
---
lol someone posted a hilarious bubba basement post a few days back that was for a new offering idea, i think, that creates 2 basements instead of one in the map and the icon is a skeleton hand with a middle finger up at you
---
T O X I C SWF using C O O R D I N A T I O N
---
Barbeque is when a survivor is hooked and it‚Äôs 40 meters and away
---
COSMETICS ARE GETTING CORNIER AND DUMBER BY THE RELEASE. ELF DWIGHT... WE FORTNITE NOW BOYS!!! WHEN ARE KILLERS GETTING CANDY CANES FOR WEAPONS??
---
He literally just downed and hooked the guy who rescued me from the hook, so it was basically camping, then he ran over to hook me again. So its not a flaw.
---
you've said yourself that you snap at people extremely quickly for essentially no reason
---
like i said, go to therapy luv mwah mwah
---
