I will let neas live because they're nea.
---
Tbf I don't play enough to get past rank 7 before reset, so people aren't that cautios when playing. 
---
Like Wraith. My cute little Bing Bong Boy.
---
Every single perk in the game has been in the shrine at least once. (Except from some newer DLC ones). Kinda weird.
---
Thank you, haha ^^
---

---
Yup, I suppose I obviously skipped some parts, we can always improve, thats what the beauty of showing it to the public is! Thank you :)
---
Please do feel free to add to the ideas on your own, this is not set in stone nor am I an official developer, I'd love to hear improved versions!
---
That's terrifying
---
Well, we didn’t even get to that part. There wasn’t a dingle generator done
---
Things I have forgot to mention in this chart would be that the only item is an instant heal medkit that spawns periodically in the middle of the basement instead. But I am not sure if I hate the idea of pillaging for normal kits or not, since the second totem would be useless then. 
---
And ranks, well... This is intentionally killer-sided to prevent absolute infinites, but surely thats just my opinion ^^
---
For dbd?
---
Hah. I didn’t pay for squat. They gave it away for free on PS+ last year. The only thing I “paid” for was leatherface.... and that was with a gift card someone gave me. 
---
Negative. I know he wasn't in range but I was making a joke he did get close when it showed up so (that was the joke). 
---
You can clearly see the 2 disconnects and my last remaining teammate on the gen upstairs across the street from me with bond. Also my last remaining teammate didn't even have prove thyself and it happened again later in the game on the last gen.

I TRIED TO PLAY TRAPPER AND HAVE A FUN CHILL GAME INSTEAD OF MY USUAL TRYHARD BILLY. GOT SENT TO GRIM PANTRY. LOST 3 GENS DURING THE 90 SECONDS I USED TRYING TO ACTUALLY SET TRAPS. DC'ED. 
---

---
I mean, they are supposed to be bringing you down with their swords, cleavers and so on. The match gets ultimately killer-sided in the end so that if there is a significant difference of skill between the survivors and killers they can at least finish the match. That's how I'd see it happening at least, if not any faster by the lesser skill gap?
---
Is this some reference i dont get?
---
Haha, some sort of selfless feeling in the generators does offer a "breathing room stationary" to people. This would definitely keep them on their toes.
---
Only thing I'd change is that I'd rather not get Stridor because it throws off my tracking - making survivors louder so they sound closer than they are.
---
Yep
---
It was worth every potential downvote
---
Definitely! It’s weird how quick 100 sacrifices popped for me and just how loooong 500 felt o.0
---
Hahaha hey a trophy is still a trophy! :D I got lucky with hatch escape as I play regularly with 3 friends and some guy put up streamers and was farming as killer.. I found a key and we all just kinda decided if he wasn’t gonna kill us it was trophy time xD
---
I've had a lot of fun with the Spirit. But I've had the most fun with the Doctor. He may not win every match, but you'll feel good and get better at tracking while playing him. He's one of the only killers that can track players in his base powers. Feng Min is very cute, and Adam is also very cute, but each of them only has like one 'worth it perk'. I'd also say Laurie and Myers are very fun to play, but Laurie has 0 cosmetics and Myers has the same problem. Don't bank on them.
---
Isn't David free?
---
That was awesome and hilarious. 
---
Oh god I'd love something like this that doesnt make me go "FUCK I LOST MY PIP AGAIN BY SOMEHOW BEING FOUND AT THE FIRST 30 SECONDS WHAT THE FUUUUUCK" I really want more chill by deadlight in my life.
---
Updoot
---
I like this, but why give buffs to the nurse?
---
I feel the same way. There is so much more pressure being killer. I just go play survivor instead when I get overwhelmed.
---
Is that a joke or am I having a r/woosh moment?
---
Just regular stab them. 
---
 Also good taste.
---
When i start to feel overwhelmed playing killer i usually change it up and make some fun builds just to have fun with, takes the pressure off and i enjoy it more than trying to get 4k's or stressing
---
No, NEA
---
PRO TIP: BORROWED TIME DOESN'T TRIGGER UNLESS THE UNHOOK HAPPENS IN YOUR TERROR RADIUS. STAY SLIGHTLY FURTHER AWAY AND BORROWED TIME WILL NOT PROC. YOU CAN ALSO BODYBLOCK PLACES LIKE THE BASEMENT AND WAIT THE TIMER OUT IF NEEDED. 
---
SPEND YOUR MONEY ON SPIRIT. SHE’S ONE OF THE BEST KILLERS AND COMES WITH GOOD PERKS THAT ARE GOOD ON MANY KILLERS. OR IF YOU NEED THE TRACKING, GET LEGION OR THE PIG FOR DISCORDANCE/ SURVEILLANCE. 
---
I HAD JUST PLAYED A GAME WITH A FUCKING CLAUDETTE AND IN THE PREGAME I SAID “HEY MAN NICE GAME WE HAD!” AND HE JUST SAYS “LMAO!” THEN WE GO INTO THE GAME, THE HAG FINDS ME PRETTY EARLY ON AND HOOKS ME. NOT A BIG DEAL UNTIL THIS STUPID FUCKING DIPSHIT P3 CLAUDETTE IS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO THE HOOK AND REMOVED ME INSTANTLY  INFRONT OF THE FUCKING KILLER! THEN THE KILLER FUCKING MORIS ME AND CLAUDETTE, I SHIT YOU NOT, SAT THERE TBAGGING MY CORPSE FOR 4 FUCKING MINUTES 
---
HEY PC PLAYER WHO HAD A STARWARS NAME THAT I WILL NOT SPECIFY IF YOU FUCKING SEE THIS 
---
FUCK
---
YOU
---
I mean, it has to be a joke for you to be in a r/woooosh moment
---
The problem with that is money. New killers and new cosmetics are the cash infusion that pays for everything else. Businesses need to constantly bring in money to keep the lights on, pay employees, all those fun things.
---
*STOP* no but seriously what the hell was that thing and what did it represent?
---
IN YOUR OPINION, WHAT IS NOT AIDS?
---
ARE YOU ON PC BROTHER? MESSAGE ME MAN. YOU DESERVE BBQ.
---
He’s right about allot of things in his vid, it’s 2019 and this game plays like it’s 2004 on a PS2 console, this company better pull itself together and start fixing the problems or people will stop playing and spending there money on this game. BhVR really needs to sort out on which way to take its company and this game before it kills it off and whoever you have writing code is total garbage! I don’t wanna hear anyone say anything about how much they can pay people to write the game codes and design, I’ve seen people working for free make better games than this! 
---
Wouldn’t the killer be guaranteed 30k? If there’s no escape, and the goal is to outlast the other 3 survivors, I don’t get why the game would continue when there’s 1 survivor left as there’s nothing left for them to do. So that would mean the killer always kills just 3 wouldn’t it? 
---
NOT PLAYING AND GO OUT
---
1/10 suggestion. I've survived more by hatch escape than exits probably. Actually getting out alive is more fun in the end imo 
---
IN THE MID LEFT IT'LL GIVE YOU POINTS IF YOU LANDED THE BLIND. BLINDS ARE ONLY REALLY POSSIBLE WHEN THEY'RE PICKING SOMEONE UP, OR WHEN THEY'RE BREAKING A PALLET. IT'S TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE OTHER TIMES BUT MOST PEOPLE JUST LOOK AWAY.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
FLASH LIGHT DOES NOT STUN (EXCEPT DURING FLASH LIGHT SAVE). IF YOU'RE HURT IN A CHASE, AND YOU'RE FLASHLIGHTING /NOT/ AT A PALLET, HE'S GONNA HIT YOU. DON'T EVEN TRY.  
---
HOPE THAT HELPS DAWG
---
Farming is lame and boring. 
---
REACHING FUCKING RANK 1 BECAUSE EVERY MOTHERFUCKING, MEWLING QUIM SURVIVOR WOULD RATHER DC INSTEAD OF PLAYING AGAINST LEGION! SERIOUSLY, I WANT TO LEARN TO PLAY THE LATEST KILLER, BUT NOOOOOOO: 1-3 SURVIVORS PER GAME DC AFTER THE FIRST FRENZY STAB, SHORTENING THE GAME TO LESS THAN 3 MINUTES, AND WASTING MY FUCKING ADD-ON'S, OFFERINGS, AND GOD DAMN TIME! GETTING RANK 1 THIS WAY FEELS HOLLOW, UNEARNED OR RESPECTABLE, AND ONLY MAKES THE SURVIVOR SIDE OF THE COMMUNITY LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF TOXIC WHINY LITTLE BITCHES... FUCKING MAN UP ASSHOLES! THIS DC'ING SHIT EITHER HAS TO STOP OR NEEDS A LOWER THRESHOLD BEFORE PUNISHMENT!
---
Hm it does state that this is more of a chill by deadlight theme so i really would get behind chilling and pleasantly farming 30k guarantee every game by existing as a killer.
---
This mode overall really seem to push killer aside and tell them to "do your job" while focusing on survivors to struggle against Each Other more..
---
Is this intentional? Its devilish if so.
---
some people weigh it against how much they've managed to accomplish in the match, if they personally didn't get a lot done &amp; then the killer ends up camping or something they'll consider it a worthwhile loss if it means the killer has less to benefit from as well 
---
Oh that's pretty sweet then. Still doesn't justify the lackluster console experience. :(
---
Yah I’ve thought about doing the same and getting a PC this game on console is straight trash and MCote is so full of shit and every time he speaks his nose gets longer and longer! 
---
Detachment. I don't take things personally in the game. But, I have screamed at the tv screen a few times.
---
Plus, if you use Hex Ruin, you can sometimes turn the early part of the game against survivors - depending on the killer.
---
Or when they farm you and then your corpse as you get moried
---
Yeah bruh they have bigger hitboxes, crappy perks, and are loud as fuck, except Ace and Adam, but Aces perks are complete crap too. Only one with decent perks is Adam, and that's deliverance. 
---
So....it is?
---
Seems like a bit of overlap was my point though. Both would just result in the unhooked survivor seeing the killer’s aura, which doesn’t change much if the person using WGLF just unhooks instantly for their stacks unless the hook is destroyed so you have a chance to wiggle out 
---
The calendar should be a rank 19 badge too, haha.
---
SHIT YOUR RIGHT, although I don't believe that there's enough traps to completely block both gates.
---
It was a manifestation of Courage's fears of not being perfect, the episode ends with Courage realizing he's perfect the way he is, which kills the perfectionist, the antagonist of the episode.
---
Yeah, I saw that red bar and was like, "well, there's no leaving this trail alive". lol
---
What are you saying??
---
Ettiquitte is dumb. If you play poorly I will punish you for it
---
It's really ironic that the same things he talks about and says everyone agrees with because he is a known streamer. When I say anything about the exact same thing, I get downvotes. It just shows how badly the community here is out of touch with what's really going on in the game that it takes a streamer to drive the nail in the rest of the way for anyone to agree.
---
i take out the days frustration on innocent survivors
---
Yes
---
Do you just like settling for the other lame survivors or is Meg too godly for you to even play with?
---
From my understanding, if you pull your ethernet cord out, the game will think the killer quit, and still give them Bloodpoints
---
I have 2.5k console hrs. Most of that as surv. Last season was my first and last to rank 1 killer. I only played killer as I got more event points than rank 1 surv. Once I hit red ranks I pulled all the stops. No more letting the last one go or playing fair like chasing the person who rescued not the injured one. Nope I tunneled, I slugged, I proxy camped if anyone was near and even facecamped if you had the loops. I did it all for that rank. Red rank surv dont cut me no slack with pallet looping and 360s why should I cut them any?
---
I don't want it to be F2P. I've seen Dead by Daylight on sale plenty of times, but we already have a toxic enough fanbase as it is--We don't need more trolls coming in. I'm in favor of there being more emotes and skins however, but nothing on a first person shooter level. A hook entity skin would also be nice, and I think the ranking system is gonna be a joke until they decide to add a non-ranked mode.
---
A bit late to the party, but I tend to be tunneled frequently. Sometimes all you can do is just distract the killer and let your team do their thing.
---
Doesn’t always feel good in the moment, but turning 4ks into anything less always feels better.
---
Who’s your friend that likes to slay?
---
I JUST NEED A FEW ADEPT KILLERS FOR ALL MY TROPHIES BUT NURSE IS KILLING ME,  AN I JUST GET SOME POTATOES FOR ONCE PLEAE.
---
Either way, I get what I want lol. If he wants to take the quick kill, I get into another game. If he wants to farm, I get to relax for a few minutes and rake in some desperately needed BP
---
So is this just one and done? Meaning you are dead just after getting downed once and killed via mori? If so I feel like these games would be way too fast. I’d like to see something where the mori part is scrapped, and once a survivor is downed they are just dead. However they then respawn somewhere on the map and continue playing. Each player gets 2 or 3 “lives” before being eliminated. Just my thoughts!
---
I liked the meme. I also like the guy, I believe he's funny, honest and has a delicious accent.
---
"Oh shit is that guy waving at me? What's his name again?"
---
he's Friend shaped
---
OMG he actually has the Wraith's dead little eyes
---
I love playing against trapper.
---
I actually allowed a guy to do 2 generators on the condition that he stepped in my bear traps a few times I also let him disable my hex and let him jump through the trapdoor.
---
They don’t do anything 
---
Myers is C tier.
---
I agree but her and Huntress are cuddle buddies 
---
Jake and Kate were regulars of the foresr.
---
Meg, Claudette, and Dwight were lost while visiting the forest.
---
David, Feng, Ace and Nea were wash out who got lost went they frequented sketchy places (bar, underground places, etc) 
---
Adam, Bill, and Tapp were implied to be dying or dead. 
---
Quentin got there because he felt vengeful. 
---
Embrace it! 
---
As a female who play games, I feel this 🙄! It's so annoying. 
---
Not only that, but it turned off a few times because of overheating. Only on Dead by Daylight.
---
See, I LOVE playing against huntress! 
---
I freely admit I hate legion and bing bong boi but I still have a go because I hope I'll get better against them. 
---
It happened to me to once. Lost 15 levels on bubba. I found that it was a bug when quitting. It stays open in the background and doesn't save when it closes. BHVR just said to keep a backup, but quitting with task manager quits it and doesn't send it into the background. I've been quitting with that now and have had no further data losses.
---
This is really good!
---
What did you use to make it?
---
One game I had found the hatch and the other survivors were already running through the exit gates. I had been harassed all game by killer and was on death hook, so I hid in a nearby locker to wait out the last person. It was an Adam. He apparently ALSO knew where the hatch was and after a tense engagement with the killer, Kobe'd off the hook and made a beeline straight for the hatch location. From across the goddamn map. 
---
Welp a few tense moments went by, Adam was already back on the hook, directly in front of my locker, which was right next to the escape hatch, which was in direct proximity to the killer. 
---
Guess what feathery assholes decided to show up at that very moment.   
---
Fight or flight over what? She got grabbed by a janitor for trespassing it’s not like any of them were in danger. They killed the guy to kill him no other reason 
---
That could work too~
---
He did get a second ban which he protested and caused quite a stir in the community. Funny enough he never told us the reason he got banned after not_queen said he was given a reason why. To this day I wonder what the second ban was for. 
---
nice
---
I got called Trash Pussy by a guy who face camped everyone he found after I took the hatch to leave... Then they sent me fortnite porn
---
I farmed as nurse and while a Dwight was working on the gen I turned my back to him, blinked three times, and reversed back to yank him off.
---
Personally, I think the four survivors in one hatch is going to be the absolute hardest
---
You are right, I forgot about that. I wonder as well. Oh well, this is why Monto and Hybrid are my top two.
---
IF PEOPLE CAN STOP BEING SO FREAKING SCARED OF THE KILLERS SO I CAN GET OFF ONE GODDAMN FIRST HOOK BEFORE I GO INTO STRUGGLE EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. I SEE YOU CROUCHED BEHIND THAT ROCK. DO YOU NEED AN INVITATION OR SOMETHING? HERE. YOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED TO CARESS MY ARMPITS WITH YOUR HANDS AND TAKE ME OFF THIS STUPID HOOK, YOU USELESS IDIOTS. WE ARE RANK 11. AND WHEN I POINT TO HEAL UP BEHIND A WALL OR PALLET, PLEASE DON’T RUN THE OTHER DIRECTION. JUST HEAL ME SO WE CAN CONTINUE THE GAME AS THE GODS INTENDED - INEVITABLY GETTING CAMPED BY A LEATHERFACE IN THE BASEMENT. FFS. 
---
Coldwind farm without corn field is my dream
---
Game over sweater and kitty skirt.
---
Let's coffee top and black plaid skirt or shorts with tights.
---
Blue or green and black space invader top with black pants or the default/bloody shorts(only with green and black top).
---
Those are the combos I use with that hair anyway.
---
I enjoy playing him. I main legion. He’s just not fair. 
---
Starts t-bagging the Bear asking mercy
---
I enjoy panda he's not afraid to show games where he doesn't do all that great. :)
---
.......What is people's originality going down the drain in the recent months.
---
I absolutely agree! He’s very entertaining and does show mercy. And then Monto is also very skilled and gives me great perk build ideas. Also both very good “leader” type people for the community.
---
Lol I did that with my friends I didn't even know it was  an achievement lmao
---
People keep saying SWF will ruin the surprise but by the time they find out it's too late and you can get at least a hit due to proximity. 
---
Sounds fun. Seek out the killer, go through the effort of killing yourself on hook, lose a pip - all because the game is bugged to fuck and other people left.
---
The m&amp;a over whelming overwhelming presence power combo 
---
Escaping through the hatch also doesn’t count you have to go through the gates.
---
Ignore them. Their goal is to waste your time. Make them pointless by chasing and killing the others first.
---
Last time it happened to me I lost a pip and the killer was taunting me as I died and called us a bunch of noobs after we lost due to 2 people disconnecting.
---
Fun game.
---
Hah, in my mind I get to be as much a freak as I want 😌
---
Yup. It seems to be mainly luck, which increases trifold if you are playing SWF in group chat. I’ve been so close before, but always get ganked or someone else fails to get the hatch.
---
I have been in queue for 50 minutes every 1-2  days because either me or my gf did not Load in or 3man or infinites.
---
Hit boxes are bs. When i play Killer and someone does a 360 i can hit them without seeing them.
---
Point still stands(Legion)
---
Meta is most efficient tactic available. By definition this excludes more than one option. 
---
To the last point: since bhvr is Hosting tournaments they Seen to care about pro scene. Making it stale is not good 
---
mucho bado
---
P3 claudette is part of the meta because she's the hardest survivor to see due to her camo.
---
From my experience most just camp you out.
---
Take a break and go to survivor. Playing killer in this game is much much harder and more stressful at higher ranks than playing survivor at high ranks. If I get sick of playing killer I just go play a game of survivor for some easymode carefree fun. 
---
owo
---
Absolutely. We're the ones who get dicked more by the deserter. 
---
haha yes
---
i think you mean "haha UwU"
---
Predict where they're going. Most of the time, they'll think you're stupid enough to not predict their movements, or they usually have a friend following them--Grab them first.
---
Ok
---
I farm him for brutality, hunting, and deviousness.  Then I let them pallet stun and do gens until the gates can be opened.  Then I kill/sacrifice them.
---
Make sense ig

100% bloodeh agree, I'm a big fan of his content! :) 
---
That happens a lot to my friends :(
---
Not better than Monto or Puppers tho
---
No it’s really fun to play as when you get salty survs lol
---
hahahaha no
---
If you're playing a m1 killer like trapper or wraith, enduring spirit fury is pretty much mandatory since it significantly shortens chases and guarantees a hit every 3rd pallet (better survivors will drop pallets early if they predict you have spirit fury but that usually means one less loop).
---
What loops are you struggling with exactly? Shack/jungle gyms/t walls? I assume your post was referring to junk pallet tiles (random pallets with debris attached) that the survivors are running around repeatedly and dropping when you are near. The proper way to run these pallets is to commit to one direction, cut the loop as narrow as possible and never respect the pallet. These shouldn't ever be a problem, although I've seen some killers be stuck here for 30+ seconds because they keep changing directions, cut the loop super wide or respect the pallet.
---
Lolol the music though 
---
Can’t wait to do these...besides my lvl 15 Claudette I have no survivor past lvl 2. Lol Killers seemed more varied so I focused them for the last 104 hours
---
It’s a sad state of affairs that this must be said on a meme. RIP human dignity. 
---
Learn to run loops as tightly as possible without getting stuck. Don’t respect or fear pallets either. Any decent survivor is going to try get as many loops as they can and swinging too early or stopping at pallets forces you to run another loop. 
---
Meh...a rank 16 on PS4. 
---
he's legit streaming dbd right now as a matter of fact
---
I love playing Trapper. 
---
[removed]
---
purple map it is.
---
I have no one to blame but myself 😭
---
Did it spawn in the bloodweb before you bought Freddy without you noticing?
---
Would you like to explain how? He makes great content and is fun to watch. At least state reasons why before criticising 
---
I don't play killer very often, but when I do, it's usually him. 
---
killer deserved that lol. new or not hitting someone on the hook is a asshole move lol
---
Not really whining just going over some of the most huge problems with the game
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
uvu
---
Wrong place, wrong time (The original 4, Kate, Laurie, Jeff, Nea), a human disaster (David, Feng, Ace), dying (Adam, Tapp, Bill), summoned the Entity out of rage (Quentin)
---
When I bought the game I bought as many dlcs around Christmas as I could and bought Freddy and the spirit later with cells. That was around Christmas and I just recently got clown to level 43 and it was there. 
---
you're still wrong
---
as much as i love your idea i think they should fix the damn game first there is so many bugs and bullshit that shouldnt exist like the window vault bug or killers hitting you from nowhere
---
@ the person who said there’s no good legion art
---
I remember all the youtubers being really excited for it, put out videos for it for maybe a month after release, then nothing. lol I don't think anybody knows at this rate lol
---
I don’t think you can technically even be level 0. I think they all start at 1. Bizarre. 
---
Pretty sure Jason could happen, isn't Hillbilly just a knock off of Leatherface? Plus I keep hearing that game has gone downhill more and more, the idea they would look to pass the license off to another game wouldn't be far-fetched. 
---
I always assume it's Myers until I know otherwise. 
---
Or a Cypress 
---
Simply put, you can't. If they can beat your mindgames there isn't anything you can do it outplay them other than running the loop as fast as possible and not respecting pallets. Chasing somebody like this earlygame is giving up 3 gens easily. Go for somebody who doesn't know the loops. If they all know the loops and how to abuse window loops, you lose. There isn't a counterplay if every survivor knows where the loops are and can run them.
---
Keep it cool. Remember that there really is no pressure--Even just hooking one survivor is enough. If the survivors don't have enough experience, they're likely more nervous than you are, so feed off of their mistakes. Read tips online to brush up and practice your skills. Sometimes, the killer you're playing isn't your style, so you might try playing someone completely different.
---
“THAT’S CALLED BOY TIPPING!
---
HAW HAW HAAAWWW!” 
---
Top ten moments taken before disaster 
---
Hm, I see. I'll see if I can't replicate it in KYF and try to send a video report.
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury make for a deadly combo, but it’s not necessary.
---
If the killer drops you themselves it automatically fills up 33% of the meter.
---
When you mix too many bloods.
---
Ok sweet! I’ll check it out.
---
Thanks
---
D a r n
---
WHAT THE FUCK! I HIT PLAYER LEVEL 100 AND THAT MEANS DICK OF ALL FUCK-NOTHING?! FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUU.
---
So.... you agree, then?  That’s a lot of hours for all of you. Of course the game is a little stale at this point. 
---
Also, I’m not saying that the game’s not without it’s problems. It has heaps. I just find in disingenuous to show video of blatant lag while talking about hitboxes.

Save your shards and just go play David.
---
The reason you run both of them is because you can hit a survivor through a pallet and it will cancel the blade wipe cool down animation. Then Spirit fury will break the pallet. Finally enduring will make the stun effect not last as long allowing you to chain a second hit almost instantly getting you a near instant down.
---
J-just maybe survive until Dedicated Servers..??
---
Adept killer is easy in low ranks. I recently got the Trapper, Hillvilly's, and Wraith's.
---
I did this a few days ago, nothing but DCs and letting themselves die on the first hook. After he mercilessly killed me I messaged him the typical "Wtf was up with my team?" and after messaging a few times back and forth we're friends now.
---
Press f12 to take screenshots
---
Thank you! I wish this game was a bit more polished but a great game none the less. 
---
the hitboxes are the same.
---
Is this on Steam or on console? If its Steam its a little bit iffy, if on console its probably due to a lower playerbase, dunno
---
I'm still pretty new to the game but I've already had two games where this has happened. Teammates all DC'd within a minute of the match starting so I started window-vaulting to make noise for the killer. Killer found me, I tried to let him kill me but he just kept smacking the gen next to me, so we proceeded to run around the map together doing gens, mock-chases, and letting him hit me, self-care, repeat, then smacking me down and carrying me around the map to find the hatch. 
---
Thank you Misters Clown and Myers for the My Best Friend, The Killer adventures. 
---
Discordance is pretty dope. It’s a teachable from Legion and will highlight a generator yellow if two or more survivors are working on it. 
---
Actually, Freddy's quite good at finding immersed survivors. They can't see Freddy when they're awake, so it's very hard to hide from him properly. Plus, Freddy can just walk around with his power up, and it'll lock onto any survivor that's in front of it, regardless if Freddy actually sees them or not. You're not really supposed to stealth versus a Freddy, besides.
---
I don't believe that, sorry, Show me proof.
---
A few of the windows hits in the video are possible, if they weren't, windows would be even more OP. 
---
*going against legion the first few weeks of his release be like..*
---
Me as hell. 
---
I *am* that killer.
---
When the survivor team is *crankin' it*, I'm doing my best to hook &amp; sacrifice *AAAALL* party victims.
---
But then there's times where the round starts, and 1 soul DC's.  "Unfortunate" I say.
---
Then I find &amp; chase my first Victim.
---
SCHWACK! *BWAHAHAHAHA*!  SCHWACK! *GAHAHAHAHAHA*
---
DC #2.
---
"That is a cretenious action, poor sportsmanship &amp; lack of intestinal fortitude. Bollocks! Shame this buffoonery."
---
So I then find another survivor &amp; *make them understand* in some way/shape/form I'm giving chase &amp; injuring with intent on BP farming &amp; letting them go.  No need for additional killing, for these remaining survivors should be given the chance to run &amp; scurry on another day.
---
THE ENTITY is a forgiving, though malevolent, God... and through me THE ENTITY speaks His intent for I am simply His instrument of pain, sorrow, and pilfered hope.
---
There will be blood in other fogged realms to be acquired.
---
Farming time!
---
My favorite tier list
---
Only if survivors get finger guns. 
---
Tru3 is damn good, one of the best killer main in the world
---

---
The nurse isnt a free character??? You just level her up without playing her...
---
Eh. I remember getting major spooks from that episode as a kid.
---
I gotta say, as someone who plays Legion, I never would have known the moonwalk trick if everyone on this reddit didn't **constantly** post about it.
---

---
pick one, op
---
Thanks matchmaking!
---
It's Freddy so nah
---
I think it's just a joke about how freddy is regarded as a bad killer.
---
Puppers is awesome, see his leatherface cosplay? Man that shit was hilarious.
---
Nice.
---
Only for his toxic series. He takes the piss but he’s having fun, I wouldn’t class him as toxic.
---
The nurse and the huntress are on pc anyone who came after the huntress is paid dlc.
---
My PlayStation has hardly ever made that noise while playing, the only times that I notice it happening is when I just finish an 8 hour long session and when I'm about to turn off my PS4 I can here the thing going crazy, but other than that, it only happens loading up the game for only a minute or so.
---
I don’t agree, I often see him saying he’s messed up. I do think he over reacts to ds, he makes it way more of a deal than it actually is.
---
‘Poor Soul’ is running a Purple Flashlight with good add-ons, Self-Care, Dead Hard and Decisive. All of which I bet you abused to the max against this ‘poor soul’ and felt super ‘leet’ in your skills over. 
---
You would have to name some perks that are not currently legit options, but are also something you would want buffed to be playable.
---
I'm guessing your 8 Meta perks include:
---
adrenaline, DS, deadhard, self care, balanced landing, borrowed time, Sprint burst, and urban evasion. 
---
I can think of about 25 perks that are viable, and see heavy play at rank 1, so your 8 must not include :
---
Bond, alert, Lithe, prove thyself, leader, quick and quiet, lightweight, windows of opportunity, calm spirit, iron will, diversion, deliverance, Unbreakable, after care, breakdown, empathy, spine chill, WGLF. 
---
It's only the players that absolutely must win, and don't give a shit about fun or just playing, that complain about Meta perks. 
---
Complain all you want, aside from technical bugs, the fun and thrill is there to be had if you stop and take the stick out of your butt hole, and let go of the salt. 
---
During a dev stream with some of the animators, they mentioned needing references for animations they wanted to do. I asked if we made a reference video, if they would consider using it. They laughed and said "yeah." Ever since then I've been planning out how I'd make a new Wraith mori...
---
It would definitely include putting the Wailing Bell on the survivors head and banging on it until the survivor was both dead, and disappeared
---
I just got mine an hour ago, it was quite painful, so many games as nurse but damn it felt nice seeing that achievement pop up.
---
Is it tho???? I actually don’t know the stats here but I get wayyyyy more hits with my hammer than timing the chainsaw just right. Especially without anything to help with steering and charge time.

Myers main here. The most stressful part of the trial is always at the beginning. Once I'm out of EW1 I tend to relax off a bit but if I can't get there before the first gen pops it's usually a really bad game.
---
No liberal we left as soon as we could. Was only able to use my flashlight at a pallete once
---
It’s not, I’ve played some billy and I was just surprised someone would say that it was easier.
---
[:(](https://imgur.com/a/q1w8nOv)

Camping and tunneling are shitty, but NoED is part of the game on purpose. People need to learn to cleanse the totems. Do I like getting all the gems up and seeing NoED pop? Hello no. But that’s mine and my team’s fault for not cleansing. It bugs me when people say the killer is cheating when it’s a mechanic that the devs put in to be used in that exact way. Both survivors and killers need to suck it up when it comes to these things.
---
MY SOUL HAS BEEN CRUSHED. TWICE.
---
And I thought xbox red rank was salty, sheesh. Saw away buddy! 
---
When to land a chainsaw you almost have to be within hitting distance. Clearly you can’t land normal hits though. 
---
You have to be a particular kind of killer to 1k and pip. Fun fact: if you play optimally, you can 0 kill and pip. You need to hook everyone in the trial once, never lose a chase, slug when possible and extend the match significantly-- but I have pipped with 0 kills several times.
---
Advice: fuck 'em, play how you want, you paid for the game same as them.
---
That's a new one lol
---
Killer Clown or Doctor: I will find find you
---
Me (as Claudette): I brought calm spirit
---
Killer:I have one more counter 
---
Me:What?
---
*Killer Disconnected*
---
No one escapes death.
---
Ok 
---
&gt; First of all, I think current Legion is a fun killer to play, and that's the most important thing.
---
What about much fun the killer is to play *against*?
---
because every killer hit should hit 🤔
---
Same dude maybe one day it will be come back
---
u/title2imagebot
---
Yeah I agree, the teaser should be in the Dev stream tomorrow.
---
What's even better is when they start hostile but because you were nice to them they then apologise and become friendly
---
People run ruin to slow down gen progress. If people are gen tapping then you're achieving that anyway, tapping is slow af.
---
As for ds, it's a good perk with very few opportunities to actually counter play it other than just burning perk slots on counters and HOPING it works out for you, so when there's a chance to juggle, go for it, fuck ds.
---
Dedicated servers are sure to change one thing - since killers won't be hosts anymore they're gonna experience the bullshit that is latency. 
---
ABSOLUTELY
---
When people do that I just don’t understand 
---
Beautiful
---
I wouldn't be surprised if a decent number of people didn't know about lunging if they are new to killer. It took me a bit to learn and I had to tell a friend about it. It definitely makes things a lot better when you learn of it though.
---
Also on a side note that is some wonky matchmaking.
---
“ I did your mum last night noob”
---
“ Why are people mean “
---
hmm
---
Ehhh. I can see it going both ways.  Regardless, the Super: Broly movie is the single greatest film to come out of the Dragon Ball series and the animation/fights/lore was orgasmic several times over.  
---
DS USERS THAT DC BECAUSE YOU DRIBBLE THEM IS MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING.
---
Like your mom?
---
Yup had a game the other day when me and another survivor was being chased through the killer shack. The claudette was in front and stop and blocked the door way for a sec just long enough for the killer to hit me before running away so the killer would chase me.
---
I followed the claudette around the rest of the game and farmed her twice right in front of the killer to make sure she's dead. 
---
i totally agree. its so sad at what people will do for points, and what alex said is too true )-: plenty of times the killer has ran after me and stayed on me until they got me down after a survivor used BT on me. 
---
Overall a pretty  cool concept and I would play it
---
I'd argue to still watch them because then you might be able to appreciate some of the differences, as well as some of the insight into how Goku/Vegeta try to live their lives when not having something to fight (first few episodes before Battle of the Gods starts up).  
---
Also a beloved character shows up during the Resurrection F arc that doesn't show up at all in the movie.
---
The bloodpoint gain on this game-mode is crazy huge, if I'm reading this right does this mean you could potentially get 100,000 bloodpoints as survivor without having to bring any offerings? 
---
Also the unique perk only rule will basically make it so only like 3 of the survivors are ever picked.
---
Nice concept over-all though 👍
---
&gt; If they all know the loops and how to abuse window loops, you lose. 
---
*Cough* The Nurse *cough*
---
I got all my killers up to lvl 15 then took it from there gradually leveling them all up. Learning how they all play is very amusing. Got all adept trophies except for Huntress which I plan on doing next. Trap killers all benefit from smart placement. Hag placing traps in not so obvious places benefits her hit n run gameplay. Most players have mastered tapping Billy's chainsaw so that it cannot be avoided. Cannibal thrives on altruism. Doc can root out people hiding. etc. 
---
You got to keep in mind that you're basically the director of the game determining how each survivor experiences the match. Yeah you could get gen-rushed then flashlight blinded every game but there are counter-perks other than hex: ruin out there. I seen one person playing the long game with devour hope and thrill of the hunt that turned a game into a bloodbath. 
---
 
---
It's more fun for everybody when you don't do those things. Camping isn't fun for survivors, it's not fun for killer until a survivor comes along. Survivors *could* ignore the guy on the hook, and the killer would get a 1k/2k tops but people just wanna have fun. 
---
Slugging isn't fun for survivors since they're crawling on the ground. Unbreakable is not as "fun" of a perk as others, but slugging is a part of the game that has a time and a place and can be played around. Just keep in mind that it's removing counterplay options like flash light saves, hook sabotages, DS, etc. Slugging also encourages survivors to ignore the last guy, since you'll be coming back to protect them. 
---
Tunneling I think is only an issue if someone unhooks right in front of the killer. But that usually only happens when the killer camps, which goes back to survivors just ignoring them to play around it. Tunneling *could* be totally avoided too with a consistent stream of chases fueled by perks like BBQ/Bitter Murmur/whispers etc. I'd argue killers that aren't good enough to go for non-tunneling kills aren't having as much fun as they could be.
---
NOED is very unsatisfying. Compare it to Make your Choice or Haunted Grounds. You don't work for the exposed status, and due to how late it activates people are just gonna leave usually. Survivors *could* clean all the totems, but this is something you can't coordinate with random people. I find it's usually the bad players that run NOED.
---
Asymmetrical game balance is tricky. Last Year: The Nightmare is dying now. Friday the 13th not as much but the dev can't do anything aside from maintenance so who knows. White noise 2 is pretty low. Dead realm and Damned both dead.
---
Play how you want though. People can still get salty regardless. But you're going to have a hard time improving your skills if you camp/tunnel survivors/run NOED
---
For me its also as survivor so much stress but as killer i determine the game and also i guess u should not expect a 4k i plenty of time let people get away and still have a good game
---
Finishing her chipotle
---
BING BONG BING BONG!
---
Do you play hearthstone? That game had the same issue. So many "bad" cards in the basic and classic sets, as well as in the expansion sets. The devs didn't crack to the pressure, and they didn't buff the weak cards. The devs simply introduced more cards, and as they rotate out of standard play they make more interesting cards that do better things.
---
The variety is there, and players with experience are the ones that look away from the Meta and surprise others with the strength of off Meta plays. 
---
I mean hey, if you’re looking to give em away I’m on pc brother 
---
I think both the light blue ripped jeans, as well as her Zoey jeans (Left 4 Dead), tend to accentuate her curves more than the track pants.
---
i agree that hitboxes usually arent thaaat bad und most of the time its because people dont understand hitboxes/animations (being in a vault means you can get hit, but they only see "they've been hit, but shouldnt") or because the ping does.... stuff. something that shouldnt be that big of a thing with dedicated servers. sure, servers still have a ping, but usually its lower and more stable. having a constant ping makes it so much easier to play around, because you can learn the timing for the ping you have.
---
maybe i'm just being too optimistic, but i really think that servers will improve the game a lot.

Must've been a bug because I had someone in the dying state and out of the dream world through a similar scenario but I could still pick them up. Same way you can still grab awake survivors out of lockers.
---
The rest is a russion roulette...
---
old but GOLD
---
I had a Myers pull that on me. He had JUST left Tier 3 so I ran toward him through the exit gate...nope.
---
It has a slow-ish start but builds up well, imo.  There are some awkward spots where it feels like things are drawn out, but there are so many good moments as well.  The climactic battles at the end of the post-movie arcs are 11/10, and they get better and better imo.  
---
Also, the Broly movie that just released in theaters last December/January is the best thing to come out of Dragon Ball, period.  
---
I'd also recommend watching the Funimation dub if you grew up at all with DBZ, because they actually have some great bits in otherwise flat areas of the series (mostly between arcs), such as getting Vegeta's Ocean Dub (original showing of DBZ on Toonami up to mid-Namek) voice actor to make a cameo for one part.  
---
Fuck good guy killers, coddling fucks.
---
Not really. People just hide in lockers. So, you can't be sure where people are. It's only helpful when people can't get to the lockers in time. 
---
He admitted in a stream it was for hacking again.  He got pissed and hacked in items.
---
Nurse is free. 
---
I mean you were standing still. I probably would have t-bagged too. At least he wasn’t teabagging at pallets and windows 
---
I've encountered some that will feign compassion and let you do gens until the gates are active, and then slug you.
---
He was literally teabbaging at a pallet. When survivors do that I usually stand still in shock at how toxic people can be. 
---
No, it doesn't. No single person has ever been banned for PNG edits and has proved it. EAC only checks the encrypted pak files used by Unreal, not the raw PNG files stored unencrypted in the game's folders. Stop fearmongering. Sad this has 5 upvotes. 
---
It's completed safe. Memes like this just spread misinformation unfortunately. Coloured perks are ugly anyway. 
---
Huntress definitely does leg day. It's more like Pig is the only female killer who bothered with cardio.
---
Yea and as I said I do look away from meta and run different builds to try and keep my games from becoming stale, but my point is its still feeling stale. That's because I know exactly what every single perk does and how to best use them in different builds and playstyles.
---
When new perks come out its great because you get to try and be creative with finding good or even just fun new builds to run. It would be the same kind of feeling with tweaking existing perks except the content is already there, someone just needs to do it.
---
So then did you not like what they did with surveillance? Because that's a perfect example of what I'm talking about. They changed it an a way that its more usable now and people have been finding ways to put it in builds like using it with pop goes the weasel, ruin, and discordance.
---
Think if they did something like taking kindred and changed it so that anytime you're in a chase all the survivors could see eachothers auras with the person being chased having a red aura. Is it meta now? Maybe but probably not since its basically giving info any SWF could tell eachother. Is it improved and changed in a way that its worth experimenting with for solo players? I'd definitely like to run that and see how it goes. Maybe even try to come up with some builds around it.
---
Like my whole point here is its about keeping the game fresh for those of us who have over a thousand hours. The point isn't to just give me some new killer stomping perks.
---
Holy shit. That looks fucking amazing man. The artist did a great job.
---
He didn’t start teabagging until after you stopped.
---
How can you be mad at somebody teabagging while you are standing still over a low wall?
---
Because he had been doing it throughout the entire game. 
---
Haha, that survivor is an idiot. You are skillfull enough to down with chainsaw but not with hammer? How does that even make sense 😂
---
I don't see an issue with the killer standing still lol, easier escape for me I don't get why you're so mad about it 
---
Why t-bag if someone is standing still? 
---
Spine Chill might’ve saved you :(
---
When you aren’t happy with simply not being an asshole so you make a post about it. 
---
Gen tapping is a waste of time and doesn’t do anything but stop people from getting better and juggling is simply a mechanic to counter DS as currently it’s the only counter that doesn’t involve a perk. 
---
I’m not mad, just thought he was jumping to conclusions.
---
Honestly I just try to not take it too seriously, just do my best and if it doesn't go well then I just got outplayed, no big deal. I mainly just try to improve as killer and I do get what you mean because I used to feel that way but honestly I think the anxiety just makes you play worse. 
---
u/vredditbot
---
Ah, my mistake. I assumed this was the first time he did it. 
---
What was toxic?
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
Well they were just looking at him. To me it kinda symbols friendliness... giving up.... idk. But I would’ve teabagged if they were staring at me like that.
---
Don't I know it! HappyClown's Colored Perks just make the game feel much better than the standard perks

Im only saying at least be able to put a survivor in dying state to sleep. How else can u hook or pick them up? We're supposed to painfully watch them crawl away powerless?

This is quite accurate

I JUST WANT TO GET BLOODPOINTS!!!!!!!!!! FUCK!!!!!!!!

Someone got killed in a lobby of DCs

Killer Battle Royale when?
---
Drowned clown STUNNING
---
Playing killer isn't fun at all past rank 10 anyways.
---
Which was very fortunate when I bought the game on Steam last winter sale cause I also bought the Leatherface dlc because he is my all time favorite movie killer that was available. He was my first killer I played with and I played with him straight for a long time.
---
I did this as well on legion, (daily) but only 1, and I tried, got a 3k, and felt bad because as I downed the last person I realised it was a 3v1.
---
Zubat was literally playing DbD earlier today. Just because he doesn’t play it full time anymore doesn’t mean he’s abandoning it. Hell, I only have 1400 hours and I still burnout and take month long breaks. 
---
I think we need to have a talk about what the doctor does
---
Yesss, I knew I recognised my box Joseph :D
---
Do you seriously have to be that person. I’m just trying to make a post about non-toxicity because I barely see them. You thought you did something huh.
---
Nah. I had a killer knock me down. Then acted like he was hiding me to a hatch for a long ass time then left me to bleed out.
---
Never knew it could take some long to bleed out....
---
Tru3 is definitely not bad. I main Nurse and I learned some valuable skills from watching him. While he’s not the best, he’s definitely not bad at all,
---
Just had another game in the hospital and figured out why its so brutal.
---
A Nurse's Calling plus BBQ and Chili basically gives you total map knowledge when they're hurt or when you're hooking. It's almost impossible to hide and heal in such a small map.
---
Treatment mode is my weapon for those lame doctor dailies. Come here boy and let me zap you. Buzz buzz 😒
---
Are you not going to accept your mistake now? Damn. Change it. Pig and trapper in the same tier is just freaking ridiculous
---
Let me add on to this experience with a streamer I encountered one time.  I can't directly name her because this subreddit thinks it's some great crime to shame people, but it was a fairly popular one.  Anyways months upon months ago I ran into this streamer and this was when I had my awakening.  The lesser me would have degraded and lowered myself to the 90 IQ level someone like her prefers operating on, but this was not the same man.  This was actually an ascended being, humanoid yes, but an entirely different beast.  Like some sort of undiscovered creature that predated mankind.  
---
Anyways long story short, she saw I was playing with the worst possible things you could ever want and after the game (I slugged her and made sure she saw me kill the rest of her team) I got zero response to my "GG."  I went to go to the VOD quickly and rewatched it.  Here's what I remember hearing: 
---
"Fucking toxic prick."  "Boosted bitch."  "Wow just make yourself as unfun as possible."  
---
And other shit I can't recall but it was hilarious hearing this chipmunk sound off.  So I go to the chat and I simply type this: "Hey ___, I was the Nurse that game.  If I ever hear you disgrace my name like that again I will spank you like I'm your daddy." 
---
I kid you not, saying this was like opening the floodgates to Hell.  EVERY person in that chatroom proceeded to react the only way boys with an all tofu diet know how to: the defense force.  I knew this would happen, so I simply leaned back, cracked open a victory beer and watched it all roll in.  Subscribers demanding my head, wannabe subscribers parroting them, my message getting deleted as the mods began to question my mental health (when a few moments before I typed that same mod was talking about their history of antidepressant use) and the streamer herself being shaken to such a core by the audacity she obsessed over it for the next ten minutes.  It was ecstasy.  
---
And it all happened because I was willing to do what pussy clout chasing killers won't.  Be a MAN.  
---
Freddy should be top tier. Locks on awake, aura asleep.
---
Tmw they have two decisives and everyone runs self care but god forbid the killer has anything strong
---
I think instead of killers having their 3 unique perks the should have 2 as well as a slot for a base killer perk, for example: Distressing, Deerstalker, or Sloppy Butcher. Also the maps would work really good if they were mazes themed around the different realms with pallets and windows scattered around. Only problem with this though is the Nurse would have free reign so she could be a banned killer for the gamemode. Ooh and in the centre of the maze is the shack with the basement which has a guaranteed totem in it.
---
Pretty much agree with everything you said. Hopefully the change to surveillance is a new beginning of spicing things up. I havent been playing nearly as long and its definitley starting to get stale for me.
---
One shot hatches, NOED, Camping, The game offering.  Yup total pro gamer here, rank 1 is awful
---
Reminds me of those enemies in castle crashers. The little brown knights.
---
I agree with you, but people need to realize that employee who is responsible for creating models for comestics can't fix lobbies, hitboxes etc... but they could fix for example old legacy.
---
But overall they focus more on new content than fixing old one.
---
I thought so as well until a recent trapper video and he got DS'ed and he predicted exactly what was gonna happen, saying it was an enormous momentum shift all because of the time wasted when it happened, literally 1 min later and 1 gen was left. It was insane. 
---
I mean tunneling a guy for dying light is pretty shitty but you do you
---
Some FNAF looking nightmare fuel.
---
Anime top ten moments before disaster
---
Honestly if a similar fleshed out game comes out with better graphics and coding I think most of us will jump ship. This game has a lot of issues but no competition atm.
---
That’s why I’m a pretty hardcore survivor main.  I’ll play killer for my dailies and once in a blue moon for fun, but I can only do two or three games at most and then I’m done being the killer. 
---
So camping the basement? Ive played tons of killers who do this, hook you basement, check every locker, put three traps near basement, soft patrol the basement and then come back and tunnel the guy off hook. Its boring af 
---
I get its effective but people tend to hate when killer just sit near the hook waiting to rush back the moment a save happens. 
---
The episode used for Myers would give my brother and I nightmares when that came on TV. 
---
Well done, that's pretty pretty.
---
Oh my gosh is that why I haven't been able to hit them with a pallet immediately after they hit me?!
---
You make a really good point, however the reason I put him so low is because of the length of Dream Demon's beam is incredibly short without range add-ons to where you have to be at point blank range before you tag someone. If Freddy had an increase to the base range of his power or even an ultra rare add-on that made DD reach the other side of the map with some penalties, I'd be more than willing to put him in either of the top two tiers.
---
It's not really a camp when i am not near the basement all the time. I am fat away frim it but it's not my fault someone decided to step in a trap or disarm it. And when they do that, what am i supossed to do? Let them go or come for them?
---
With almost 2000h I don't know why you think it's cheated...
---
He might have leveled up most of them just to P3 lvl50 without doing any further bloodweb. That's totally a reasonable result with that playtime.
---
A lot of them aren't even accurate or funny and they reach like a million bajillion upvotes.
---
Is this "Oh, My Killers!" anime I've heard so much? 
---
haha I think (hope) they were joking
---
It’s the point of the perk though
---
I have 2,800h on my main account. I am not that close to getting that much progress. I know many friends with 1-1.5k hours who barely have anything
---
**Where is Amanda the piggy gal?**
---
I try to win, but I feel ya on that bbq stacks, though if I completely stomped them, and decide to show mercy I MIGHT give up that last bbq stack.
---
I know but the perk is shitty and people who play with a generally scumbags 
---
Lucky, for me its monsterous-f***ing-shrine. 
---
Meg has booty? 🙄
---
Meg is my main so she has all perks and is around lvl 200(some more for eventofferings and missclicks). Nea, Feng, Doctor and Trapper have almost all perks too (10-20left). Claudette, Dwight, Kate, Spirit, Myers, Huntress and Hag are beyond L50 too. Cause meh perks and I want them to play or perks/offerings for better achievement-hunting (huntress). 
---
If I'm done with p3-50 all..next step max out all perks. xD
---
Ooooooooh I would adore a proper, cliché haunted mansion map
---
A lore-heavy chapter really would be fantastic 
---
Upvoted for the truth.
---
he is a rich youtuber, replaceing hradware would not be hard, and as far as i know the only way they knew to ban him was because he was streaming himself exploiting glitches with his username visible on screen.
---
If you want to get really triggered by poinless overcomplaining give gamma lunatic a shot since he streams in german and english now.  
---
\- The Survivor has A N Y Perk? - Overpowered REEEEEE
---
\- someone says nurse is too good? - SHE IS BARELY ENOUGH REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
And that every 2 seconds. 
---
I had a huntress down me just to take me to the hatch. Was very sweet of her.
---
I don’t think that grammatically correct. 
---
Nurse and legion are the two outliers because their power actually gives them the tools needed to catch survivors. 
---
Yeah I usually ignore them too. Not because I think I would waste a lot of time chasing them, I probably would, but because they are usually just following you around while you chase another survivor to flashlightspam, flashlightsave and sometimes tbag you at every opportunity. And while they are following you, they can't do gens effectively so by chasing one person you only have two persons on the gens instead of three.
---
Bad suck u uninstall ):&lt;
---
Mainly spite and kind of a message to the killer saying "stop being toxic". Counter intuitive I know
---
You should add in some paragraphs to help others read your post more easily and maybe offer some constructive feedback :) 
---
Hope you get some answers!
---
In order of effectiveness:
---
* Play Nurse or Hag
---
* Ignore them if they want to be chased or are heading to a really good loop (Pig Tree, Magic School Bus, etc.).
---
* Unga Bunga though every pallet, don't stop ever. Run Enduring and/or Spirit Fury for maximum effect, but they aren't necessary.
---
* Try to mindgame them with a combination of switching directions and moonwalking if you have enough cover to do so.
---
Bamboozle from clown could be good for you as Meyers killer. You vault windows faster with it and Bloch the last vaulted for 16 Dec I think.
---
Can you make a tier list of the memes?
---
In a perfect game, sure, but that's not always guaranteed. It depends where people spawn and where the action is. Plus, smart killers will know to cut survivors off and hook smartly. 
---
SPOILERS FOR SCREAM
---
If they do add Ghostface, here is how he should be:
---
110% Movespeed
---
16 meter terror radius
---
And for his power, *The Twist*:
---
*there are two of them*
---
when you queue up to play ghostface, you queue up with another killer who chose ghostface.
---
Know which anime?
---
When that happens keep putting pressure on the gens without getting caught. If two ppl work on one gen and the other two work on the other gens , the killer can only chase and put pressure so much but this requires a team effort
---
x to doubt
---
Played one like this earlier today where i only had one teammate left, and they just hid rotating between 2 lockers because they knew where the hatch was. Took me about 20mins of working the remaining 3 gen's alone just to escape. *THAT'S* a piss off. Would work one 1/4 or so then hop on to another so the killer would spend time searching the areas around each generator. Got spotted every once in a while and have to lose them, meanwhile the teammate wouldn't touch a gen the entire chase. 
---
Freddy is not the worst killer in the game. He's a solid mid tier that needs some small tweaks
---
Hillbilly was also only mistreated... until he snapped
---
Killer power? Teachables????
---
Pig is going to be shit, because none of her perks would help her in this mode
---
We're all debating whether its his mustache, leopard print or tight pants
---
Freddy is absolutely the worst killer in the game, his ability is that he waits to hit a survivor and can see them while asleep. Thats it. Freddy remains the one killer who cant defend hooks whatsoever and struggles to pressure survivors right in front of him. The small time waste to wake up is not that consequential and is way worse than any other ability 
---
Which killers are worse than freddy? 
---
Yeah you should try breaking the post up into paragraphs maybe some bold letters when you are talking about the different gameS. No one is gonna read that long wall of text. Maybe add a TLDR. 
---
You can pickup an awake survivor.....if you couldnt it was bugged or another survivor was healing them
---
I stand erected. Nice drawing, bro.
---
Nice click b8t m8 i r8 8/8
---
Just went back and Tried to fix it, Hope this is better. :)
---
Ok, I managed to read the massive wall and I’ve taken a few things away from it. 
---
1) You say that (in F13th) you would use glitches/exploits if you found the killer to be “mean”. That’s pretty fucked up and it’s honestly considered cheating. Ban worthy in games.  Don’t do that here, it just fuels toxicity. 
---
2) The devs don’t care?  They’re constantly putting out patches, updates, and events. While, bugs may arise, they’re aware and work hard (even if sometimes it doesn’t feel like it) to sort it out. The F13th devs took a goddamn vacation when they released the game completely broken and unplayable on console. A vacation. Acts like this are the reason the game failed. 
---
3) Based on numbers, Behavior has created the standard/model of asymmetrical horror. They don’t plan on losing it anytime soon and even invested a shit ton last year by buying out their publisher. They’re dedicated, and have slowly listened to the community to try to implement changes catering to them that won’t break the game/balance. 
---
I suggest to have faith and leave the toxicity in F13. 
---
The juicy DC. Nothing better
---
Swf, there’s your andwer
---
This. The only thing Clown'so power is consistently good for is chasing. Freddy should be in his spot imo.
---
One has a big brain
---
The person who DCed was a bro about it in postgame, did it for the big meme 
---
As far as the graphics, I play on Low lol. 
---
I played a pig and I went to vault a window and did the animation, but didnt actually vault it and went down as a result. So she picked me up and dropped me until I landed on my feet and we resumed the chase.
---
Then it happened again but instead of taking the hit I avoided it with the window glitch. So I let her down me, cause that way it was fair.
---
"My problem is with game is like This".
---
You don't need apostrophes :)
---
How about making it so a missed swing ends the frenzy?
---
So you mean the whole point of the Killer?
---
This is the first time this has happened to me :') 
---
so many times i've been hit through a window after a fast vault, and the white cars against huntress, they have no hitbox now for some reason, im pretty sure the hitboxes for survivors are just one shape and not multiple shapes.
---
downvoted for claudette prejudice
---
TOO ALL THE SWF WHO ARE NOT TOXIC AS F ... I KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS BUT IF YOU DONT WANT TO BE TOXIC F DO NOT SHARE INGAME INFORMATIONS OVER THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE LIKE KILLER LOCATION TOTEM LOCATION ETC.  THX
---
Nah easy anti cheat is just buggy af in every game that uses it. I have had it kick me from lobbies and saying I could  not be validated before. 
---
Mute button. 
---
They do. If they listened to their community for all things, the game would be a mess and no one play. It’d be a gen simulator. 
---
Turn off or ignore chat. As a killer if the survivors talk after chat besides "gg" 90% of the time its to salt at you or each other. Ignore them. Their opinions of you are worthless.
---
Trapped survivors, please stop panicking and running straight for the nearest Jigsaw box and expect me to ignore you, even though I know exactly where you are. Remember, we get notified when you're rescued and can see where the nearest box is. See also: skill checks, hit them.
---
Breaks my heart to keep running into you, but entity says I gotta kill you.
---
The timer is long enough for you to be rescued from the hook, heal, stealth for a mo, and then make your way round the boxes without shitting your pants. Hell, I usually do a generator before I try to get my traps off.
---
It happens quite a bit, doesn't help that survivors all spawn together now. I always try to the middle gens while the killer is chasing someone else. 
---
Yeah exactly I was working on one and the other 2 were dicking around and I found feng afk i was so pissed XD
---
Freddy has high map pressure and game stall. His lack of instant pressure is made up for by his high tracking and ability to force regression and slower progression if applied constantly
---
Freddy is a killer encouraged to drop chases and whittle down pallets whilst keeping the game in a slog. He benefits more from not camping or tunnelling due to his insane stall power.
---
Worse killers are LF and Trapper easily.
---
Trapper is all rng and has an easy to disable kit, whilst LF has no map pressure or chase power, only hook defence
---
its alright. i think this is an amazing post. I just wanted some piggy gang represent
---
I haven't run into a lot of Leader users, but yeah the past two times I've encountered it as soon as they leave the area the bonus disappears.
---
Hate those players, the worst! 
---
Hmm I didnt know that, I got something too when I turn off my PC says game violation probably from DbD
---
Its the entity. Beware. The next think you know you will be hooking people amd making scrafices. You have been warned. 
---
I was thinking they would work similar to hag traps, and I would also add chests as a trappable object I just didn't think of it at the time
---
Whenever he runs MYC he always sings "Make your choice, make your choice, did you make the right choice? Did you make your choice?" over and over again. 
---
True true, I always go for middle gens even if I'm on top of a gen at spawn I kinda wish they put voice chat even tho most wont use it
---
You cant do that tag and move on thing if survivors spread out and dont waste pallets
---
I get your point, but there are so many cases that people has private profile just because they don't like """"curious"""" people, not because they want to hide a VAC or other comments about a game like DbD.
---
once had someone tell my friend to "go play dora the explorer, b\*tch."
---
Same yeah most players just dont get it and are still just hiding while you get chased
---
With her silent add-on, in a way. xD  
---
Maybe give the " Ch ch ch, ah ah ah" or whatever you wanna hear or say it as he appears near by, his terror radius being low and quickly rising once he appears. Either way giving a "time to go" warning. Then again maybe we would be stepping on Micheal at that point.
---
I enjoy spirit and clown way more than another hillbilly or huntress with iri-heads. Then again, I'm not fond of looping and have much more success with mindgames and hiding, so a silent spirit or clown bottles on a loop don't really bother me.
---
I always play friendly if the match starts with 2 people or DCs bring it down to 2. 3-man games happen so often so I decide not to waste add-ons
---
I see you too, are a man of ~culture~ r/dbdgonewild
---
I said 3 gen is a possibility.
---
Freddy is an amazing killer when players know how to use him. As long as he constantly tags as many people as possible, even as the cost of losing a chase, Freddy can bring the game to a slog which is good for killers. More time and less pallets makes him extremely dangerous 
---
If you play Legion like they're intended or without add-ons they can't put pressure on Survivors or down anyone. You will almost certainly double-pip, but probably only one person will die.
---
If you play Legion using the Moonwalk Exploit and Stab Wounds Study OR using Cold Dirt+Joey's Mixtape OR using Frank's Mixtape almost every chase will end within a minute, and the Survivor stands almost no chance of Escaping.
---
Sounds like you're not losing anything either? Either way that game will suck so doing this would help solve the 'who really DC'd from the match issue'
---
I don't get it tho, Freddy is a completly standard killer, 115% movement speed, 14 meter terror radius, he's just like a Trapper och Myers (when Myers isn't in tier 3). The  7 second window of not being able to hit the survivor can actually benefit you in the way that you can make people waste pallets and get a free hit. Freddy without skill or perks will definetly make him the worst killer, there's no question about it. But a good perk build and good skills, he can easily be up and compete with the trapper and spirit, and as it stands right now, Legion is the worst killer in terms of tier list, unless you use Franks mixtape wich really is f#cked and broken right now, but getting it from the bloodweb isn't all that common. I wanna hear a real argument to as why Freddy is bad, and I don't wanna hear anything about the 7 second window, as that is something that, in my opinion is good.
---
*EXPLODES*
---
This. He easily belongs in "Has some way of tracking them, but it's not reliable".
---
Unless the Survivors forget what generators are, you don't have time to yeet bottles in every corner.
---
My counter meme: [When the generator is almost finished and Claudette runs away because the Killer is coming.](https://cdn.mpasho.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mr-t-time-meme-generator-get-back-to-work-fool-fc0cc7.jpg?x77747)
---
Legit.
---
Dude, its a meme, i know it doesnt ban you, i made that because EAC is a joke of a anti cheat
---
Im not native english speaker so if you could tell me the error, it would help
---
It’s trash. 
---
Stab wounds study and moonwalking is broken 
---
Or the leopard-prints 😝
---
This happends pretty often
---
When the Logo stops animating it's crashed, otherwise some1 else crashed 
---
Maybe instead of giving the bp, would be more effective need less gens to scape.
---
For exemple, three gens for 2 people instead the 5 gens.
---
I agree that doesnt make everyone a cunt. However, you cant deny that killers consider it BM and I personally dont like to do that to other people. I'll tbag the hell out of another survivor to say high, ask for a heal, celebrate, clam chop their face as they get mori'd. I just dont find it necessary to do to try and ruin the killer's game.
---
&gt; legions main weapon is running really fast
---
hey that can be a brutal weapon. imagine legion running so fast, that he rewinds the time until when the survivors parents tried to have some alone time, but they cockblock them, so the survivors never get born.... which basically kills them!
---
STOP GETTING MAD AT ME OR ANY KILLER WHEN YOU TURN A GUARANTEED 1K INTO A 3/4K BECAUSE "EVERYONE NEEDS TO MAKES IT OUT"
---
I feel like I'm getting downvotes for the wrong reason. Also half the comments so far have nothing to do with the post. I'm not complaining about if there are counters or not, I'm just saying the way this mechanics are designed is totally unfun.
---
Any new game mode would bring back so many players 
---
It does literally nothing but give xp man. And there are perks in the game that allow you to heal yourself, save yourslef from a hook, ECT. There's no reason this perk should have no in game utility. 
---
Very biased. Boo-fucking-hoo you sometimes get hit because of the hitboxes. Either fix your internet or better yet just throw down the fucking pallet instead of insisting that you loop it x number of times.
---
I do agree about the game's technical issues like it crashing. Had that happen multiple times in a day now. I guess I'm in the testing lobby thing because I have no problems getting matches at any rank. 
---
The whining about "I get the same Killers over and over!" I find funny. Guess what? At rank 1 I get matched to SWF squads over and over and over. That's not fun either.
---
Bad map design: I'm like "Okay, he's going to point out the infinites and bullshit where you need Bamboozle. Great." He mentions infinites but then whines about certain maps not having enough pallets. Are you fucking kidding me? There's plenty of pallets for you piss-babies. And the piss-baby whines about Bamboozle (a perk mind you) that shuts down garbage like Killer Shack loops. Dude, just throw down your fucking insanely safe pallet and move the fuck on. Stop crying. BTW, Blood Lust got nerfed and Tier 3 Blood Lust is just "meh" ATM. Even with Tier 3 Blood Lust on a 115% movement speed Killer there's still certain loops where you cannot catch them. 
---
Just a fucking video made by a piss-baby for piss-babies so they can all cry together. 
---
Pig is the only killer I haven't leveled up yet
---
Unlucky. - - ZubatLEL probably.

You think you are better than me!? - - Vinc3ntvega probably.

&gt;Devotion 3
---
Hmmmm
---
SERIOUSLY, AT THIS POINT I LOVE HEARING A FLASHLIGHT BECAUSE THAT MEANS SOMEONE ISN'T WORKING A GEN.
---
lmao just stream the game. they literally can't do anything to you anymore.
---
Imagine not spelling right Legion 
---
In that case I would lead the killer to them xD
---
I wasnt. I was trading a teammates death for mine so he could get out the door. He was almost done struggle, I saved him. Gave him a head start then run behind to body block. Clown couldnt get him so he took me instead. Clown then messaged me he admired my altruism and that he would have done the same in my situation.
---
He always scores the nice killers to spare him while we're all getting killed.. I have a collection of screenshots 😂
---
I think I find maybe 1 in 10 games where someone isn't running Decisive Strike. Though that's countered by half the remaining games having 2 or more people running it.
---
But Self Care? Every game, normally on 3 and if not 4 of them.
---
I'm not really fussed playing against either perk to be honest, but they are everywhere.
---
ochido
---
I do upload full vids to youtube :) Or what do you mean? Ps: i love u 2
---
I had one killer knock me out, carry me to the ruin totem, let me cleanse it, then hooked me. Oh well lol
---
I get that but then he can just one shot you, no ability needed. What would I do in that situation?
---
I mean like full matches! ofc it doesnt have to be edited as much like this 
---
Its fills a niche role for farming. Use something else
---
I’ve seen a Michael carry my friend through the whole auto haven map to look for the hatch only to hook him right next to it. We both burst out laughing and messaged the killer saying it was hilarious and he was like “yeah I changed my mind mid way” 😂
---
It would sound better but it's still more towards "Using flashlight is awful!" than actually asking why she got stunned by a flashlight.
---
I like it! Sounds fun.
---
Really nice artwork. You have my upvote!
---
4 survivors can beat most legions if they stay separated, don't heal, and pop those gens.
---
People i never trust  
---
\- Ace wearing leopard print  
---
\- Ace with pink button-up 
---
When people ask what you want in life 
---
The context is she feels betrayed and humiliated by the fact she got flashlight stunned, not that she thinks flashlights are awful.
---
Why Feng?! For me it's the bearded Dwight haha
---
Well, I tried to make something funny, if you didnt find funny, thats your opnion
---
MGG &lt;3 Honesty all of the photos from this photo shoot are a mood
---
Damn I would be too
---
Battle Royale Dead By Daylight
---
Because they want to be seen.
---
Thats the trade off, you get 2x BP but can only use 3 perks, which has its benefits like making you able to play with out relying on your perks.
---
Squats get them fast legged 
---
Oh understandable....
---
You are an idiot sir
---
How could youu 😆
---
Basicaly, battle royale mode-ish (except this time it actualy sounds fun)
---
I ship them
---
Dude bleeding out takes forever. They did that to me once. Never again. 
---
Do you ever look at someone's reddit post and think...
---
What is going on inside their head? 
---
someones been googling "How to survive bear encounter"
---
I fairly certain I've set everything up, but it is still not sending automated messages (for the shrine). How do I set it to auto message? Thank you!
---
The ultimate vault disappearing build would be lithe, dance with me, quick and quiet and lightweight. you should use it
---
Honestly I'll take this influx over the lol legion bad posts. 
---
So you've given up making reasonable points and instead just make jacket statements.
---
Freddy is easily mid tier and doesn't need a rework, just small changes 
---
I think it's really cool! Though I'd say start with a normal map, but have it get smaller as time progresses (maybe like the entity's spikes that block the gates for killers/blood warden). Or standing outside of the allowed radius gives you automatic exposed + notification for the killer. Only the character's teachable perks is a good idea in theory, but I think everyone would just pick Claudette for self-heal. Also the totem mechanic seems a bit complicated, though bloodpoints in exchange for letting the killer know where you are is a good idea in principle.
---
HITBOXES. 
---
That's how r/deadbydaylight works
---
Play what you want TBH. If winning means that much to you just play Nurse
---
Depends on the build and the player (Michael is all about Stealth and, to an extent, Mindgames).
---
IMO he does deserve to be with Billy simply because he's one of the two Killers who can straight up eliminate Survivors with his power.
---
Almost like it's intentional 👀
---
Yeah, it's pretty simple to see that depending on playstyle or add ons they basically are either way too weak or way too strong, they never really sit in the happy medium of "just decent" that's fun to play as and against.
---
Pretty similar to Nurse except that it takes skill to get to the way too strong level with her.
---
I was doing a gen with a person and this nea was being chased and she ran straight to us and put the pallet down when the doctor was about 10m away
---
Man I got 445 hours of probably 75%+ killer and I still get dumpster not all that uncommon. I think I’m in the forever trash category, scottjunds killer video didn’t seem to help much. 0k depips are not very uncommon for me.
---
GRAB ALL THE SHITTY PERKS YOU CAN FIND SO THEY WON'T SHOW UP AGAIN, EVENTUALLY THE GOOD PERKS WILL BE FORCED TO SHOW UP
---
WHAT LEVEL PIG ARE YOU, AND WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
---
Unrelated but I killed three people and afked for about 3 minutes and realised the fourth hadn’t escaped yet. I circled the map 3 times and couldn’t find the hatch. Messaged the survivor, told him to do gens. I went into the basement and I saw a silhouette of a dying survivor on the hook. Was really strange.
---
Eh, I can forgive people who say this.
---
You have to be good at aiming with Huntress (not *that* good with how broken Hotboxes are, but still good) while Clown can just yeet bottles at a Survivor's general area.
---
If someone plays both of them for the first time for an hour each, I can totally understand thinking Clown is better. They're still dead wrong, but I can understand it.
---
I agree with the Tunneling part. I myself get called a tunneler but mostly because of what you said - i hear the audio notification that someone got off the hook, "Oh, i'll go check it out", i think. And when i arrive, the dude that's injured is just hiding behind a rock just 10 meters from the hook and i happen to find him. Alright, what the fuck was your plan, then? Do you think i'll just leave you there and go for the non-injured survivor? Possibly losing a shit ton of time just to find the other one that rescued you, and allow you to heal? No, i won't.
---
Really?  Killers get tilted so easily. I never understand why tbags are considered offensive. To me it's just amusing.
---
To add to this I believe the devs said the scratches are only visible for ~7 of the 10 seconds, making lightweight possibly ~4 seconds.
---
Rip console bois. Can’t even see with 20 FPS while in frenzy
---
&gt;  amazing utility  
---
Meh, the aura reading has so many counters that most of the time it's like not having it.
---
Since it got buffed/nerfed Borrowed Time only protects the rescuee, not the rescuer.
---
Nea is  scarier then the actual killer
---
We don't :D
---
That is amazing and terrifying at the same time :D 
---
Nope. Sorry
---
BT used to cover both the survivor unhooking and the one being unhooked, so killers were left with no good option on who to go after.  It was obnoxious as fuck.
---
Also this meme is about saluting the brave Bill who is saving you from a camping killer (because Bill's perk is BT), then screaming in agony because Bill died to save you (like he did in Left4Dead).
---
Oh I understand ^-^
---
For me I wouldn’t mind any survivor perks if totems had skill checks. The actual game spawns survivors near my totems or right next to a gen. The best times i had was on the game map when it was new and survivors didnt know the map or where to find totems. To get back on point running ruin and getting at least 1 hook takes a lot of anxiety off of me. But the counter play to DS is to dribble avoid the obsession or eat the d strike. 
---
Sometimes I end up playing in shelter woods and in that case I want to die no matter what
---
Playing Myers and found a Claudette cleansing my Ruin totem. She took the time to teabag me furiously rather than simply running off.
---
BAM! EW3! - hooked and no one saved her in time.
---
Feels good.
---
A while. I felt comfortable playing those 2 killers, but I never ever went for any of the adept trophies. So one day I decided I wanted to get those, which meant I had to play other killers as well. Through that experience, I actually realized that some killers are really fun to play as, with the right perks and add-ons. Now I do have favorites, but no mains.
---
I’m not saying you’re bad, but I just want to point out this unfair glitch
---
We. NEED. This. Now
---
Agree but Clown is more fun.
---
The worst thing is when you've used a good offering and this happens. RIP survivor pudding...
---
I would love a new gamemode, especially one that pits survivors against each other, as well as the killer.
---
Makes survivors think there is devour hope, makes them lose their time.
---
No. The Traps are my babies! MY BABIES 
---
Yeah I mean sometimes ds can fuck You over real bad but half the time it really doesn’t do shit and you down them almost instantly again. 
---
Spirit is DEFINITELY number one just stahp
---
Heh. This gave me a good giggle.  
---
Man, I need to rewatch all of EE&amp;E. It's been a while.
---
I feel that. 
---
I'd say Myers is stronger, personally. Having instadown in his base kit and the ability to utilize a ridiculous amount of perks that no one else can is quite something. 
---
You watched the Noob3 vid, we get it. 
---
Meh. Two people escaped it’s not that bad... the Kate could have got to the hatch and it be fair game
---
AS A P3 LEVEL 30 PIGGY, THE BEST WAY IA TO JUST GRIND THROUGH THE PERKS YOU DON'T WANT SO THE ONES THAT ARE DESIRED CAN BE ACHIEVED QUICKER. IT SUCKS, BUT THAT'S HOW THE COOKIE CRUMBLES. GOOD LUCK-
---
THANK YOU FRIEND

Feel free to hmu and teel me whats good and wrong with this video

For some reason I always think "I bet they have Decisive". Usually they do.

Besides that, unless the map is Léry's, I couldn't care less.

dammit now that vine will haunt me for the next weeks

There's nothing besides text in your post.

At least on mobile.

I'm gonna unfold my chair, light the fire and bring some snacks because this is a great camping opportunity
---
(just from having looked at a lot of lv 50 BW) Green and Purple drop rates nearly stable, Yellow and Brown are where you get the most variation. Red is basically every other web or so. 
---
Prestige because you want to, not because you have to! And if you don’t wanna, don’t! Personally, I prestige characters I like to show them love and to get more practice as a babby with no perks. 
---
It is a bit annoying to me but I only faced it once so *shurg*
---
I feel like the music is overpowering the mood that you are trying to set in your video. Setting the mood with some silly music may help while not making the pauses between the audio too long. You can always try to over lap the audio. (Example the duck sound when the killer misses.) 
---
All that does is make legion garbage why even use their power at that point
---
I mean that doesn't matter a whole lot. Leatherface can instadown people too, but I think it's hard not to agree that he's not one of the weaker killers in the game.
---
You could just press on the image and zoom in
---
Well thats it, you're not on my tier list anymore
---
When you are fighting a spirit, there is no ruin, lullaby, third seal, no thrill of the hunt, no indication of devour hope and you know there are at least 2 totems active and you see that one adam trying to cleanse the totem over and over again.
---
(1st time: saw adam on the totem, kept pointing at him and he came off, I think he tought I wanted to heal him, but heartbeat started playing, so we parted ways
---
2nd time: I was being chased by the spirit and I saw adam on the totem again. I just run at him and point at him. I wanted to tell adam not to cleanse the totem, but instead, the spirit just went after the (still injured) adam
---
3rd time: last gen was done, I was opening an exit gate and suddenly the totem breaks. Only a few seconds later, Adam (who was healthy at this point) got downed. There were only 3 people alive and I wasn't saving him, so I just went out. I don't kbow what happened to the last guy, but I'm pretty sure they got out too)
---
Also Hag. All of her 3 perks would be useless
---
eh who really cares i just treat everyone as npcs and i dont have guilt. worka best with killer
---
Nyooms to message :)
---
Of course, optimise the game before this.
---
michael isn't really add-on reliant imo. surely, some add-ons such as scratched mirror make it effortless, but his base stalk is a good claudette finder itself.
---
also freddy should be really up on the list. dream world is way too bright for claudettes, i never struggle finding them. not to mention class photo and nancy's masterpiece, there's no hiding from that. 
---
The difference is that dedicated servers actually affect the PC playerbase
---
op said they've been playing since 2016 soo
---
I mean I have only played this for year and i am a devotion 3 but I guess
---
I agree with this sub on a lot of things but sometimes I believe people complain for the sake of complaining. I’m guilty of doing it sometimes myself. 
---
I love the game and can’t wait to see what they do with it. 
---
Jesus this Idea would be awesome as hell
---
oh i misunderstood then. ive been playing it for a year too and am devotion 5

WHAT'S A GOOD PIGGY BUILD? BEEN MEANING TO LEARN!
---
Executed perfectly 
---
Yeah if somebody have a different opinion then it's definitely because they are shit
---
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD
---
In my experience, it’s more often devour than haunted grounds.
---
He could ha e easily hit one of us
---
That was what I thought after Legion dlc and my achievements. Had only Huntress 24m left..and now....wow.. the new Legion achievement was so stupid and terrible. Hope next will be better!
---
Hope your OBGYN can help get that sand out of your vagina
---
Is Huntress viable at all?
---
Just to be clear on your point, people who play the game, don't cry about killers they don't like, am not a quitter, and play a game the way it is intended  I have sand in my vagina? Buddy this is a mature rated game I think you have 5-7 years left before you hit that 18 year old mark.
---
Great compilation and editing! I really love it
---
But I really have to say that you can't give Legion, Pig or Clown shorter ranges just because they have knives. Yeah it looks ugly in motion, but otherwise they would be too weak
---
the curse being Hex: Haunted Ground
---
Hey if we are taking about builds 
---
I am trying to main huntress
---
My perks are 
---
1. Ruin
---
2. Iron maiden 
---
3. Bbq
---
And what 4th perk should I choose? My nurse is level 1 because I hate spending blood points on a killer which I don't like and except the doctor and cannibal all my killers are level 1 , so I am kinda lost here 
---
Would appreciate some advice on addons too 
---
Another cosplay prop of mine.
---
Again, 3D printed, model made by my boyfriend, printing, paint and special effects by me. :)
---
This took me about 50 hours including printing time :)
---
Maybe because survivors got overnerfed? 
---
This game needs more content, updates every 3-4 month and a few balance patches is too little.. i have 1 -2k hours and ive done everything you can do
---
Well, the go-to build for huntress usually is ruin, BBQ, Nurse's and Whispers. Ruin, Whispers and BBQ are obvious I'd say.
---
 Nurse's is nice because you get a free proc if people don't respect it, but if you don't want to level good ol' Sally, I'd just say get whispers. It really helps with dealing with stealth
---
You should murder someone and get super fast so you are the killer
---
I'm suprised Huntress can't tbag survivors since she clearly does squats everyday.
---
Well they where op for over a year. 
---
You dont experience this because as killer youre the host. It looks completily normal to you. Yes, 2016 killer was super underpowered but now killer is boring because its too easy and survivor is boring because its too hard..
---
I suppose. 
---
Yeah you're probably the 5th guy who told me to run whispers.....   So the thing is ...I am shit with whispers ,I can't use it it doesn't work out for me I can't make out where they are and I end up wasting time 
---
They hit good skill checks every time but keep working while progress is halted.
---
Wraith is a pretty fun/good Killer.
---
What's the purpose of moonwalking?
---
She if flexing Off White Jordans
---
Oh yah the basic design behind this game on how it works is great, 1 person trying to stop 4 others from completing a objective, then added at a slasher-horror game where everyone is dead makes it fun as hell! But your right if someone else took this basic idea and made a working functional game with the same feel me and allot of others will be more than happier to go there and waste are money! Like I said BHVR needs to really start looking at which way it’s gonna take the company and fixing its problems, if not it will end up like Zipper Interactive, look them up and see what happened! 
---
Velma or Fred would have more useful perks.
---
The only thing I can think about Shaggy is like a fucking Scooby snack item, but Velma and Fred can bring some thickness
---
What anime dis?
---
Shit, that's op. And wrong. Good I don't have Legion
---
If I’m not using iron grasp or agitation it’s mildly annoying. If I’m on Lerys or the game then it can actually do some work and can be useful. But for the most part it’s a waste of a perk slot that doesn’t really affect me whatsoever.
---
Doesn't mean ping spikes doesn't exist. You might have 100 ping in the lobby but literally any kind of connection issue can spike it.
---
I've never had a match in dbd where i felt the hits from the killer were BS except when the match were plagued with lag.
---
The only exception to this has been huntress.
---
Oozing so much, to even turn hetero man into at least BI ! XD 
---
Jojos part 3 
---
Well, this is a relief for a scrub like me that didn't see the point in prestiging if it just meant losing all of my shit.
---
Well p3 lvl 50 doesn't mean you have every perk for every character 
---
You're wrong but okay.
---
[This is actually](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/4zv72b/dead_by_daylight_tierlist_v110/) the original thread from September 2016. This game feels so old when i went back to that old thread
---
But most Bill have Borrow Time XD 
---
This shit is so cute 
---
Damnnohtml made a great video about how to counter basic loops it helped me out a lot
---
Offering: 0.3% Power. Shaggy uses his power to reduce the number of hooks to 0
---
Huntress is one of the best killers in the game on PC. On console, aiming is much harder, so she's not as good.
---
It can make it a bit harder to get to a hook due to all the swinging, but usually I have no problems with it. Though I wish it was better.
---
Yeah i think people just have to remember that all killers have the same attack range no matter how short it looks

I was just thinking about it, that’s why I put *Maybe* in each time I was going to put Aric Cells in there
---
I've grabbed a few survivors stuck in walls or trees — down them, grab them, drop them, then run to the other side of the map.
---
My overall goal is to have fun and as I increase in skill I see little fun in ruining it for other people. I know full well how irritating it is to get tunneled, re-hooked and sacrificed 2 minutes into a match.
---
Bullshit happens.
---
Shit your nick gave me the spook as well :D

I think pig is stronger than Freddy

---
Okay makes sense but sometimes I would see someone without hooking them or on a different killer and no obsession. 
---
I play pig so i just hook them and tbag
---
Spitting some hot truth here.
---
The killer will (should?) go through each BP category over the course of a match, whereas survivor BP gain is more or less exclusive to each category.
---
Like if you're getting 8k out of Objective you probably aren't being chased that much.
---
Hello General Reposti
---
For me Billy, Michael and LF are good starts as killers. Claudette for survivor. 
---
Huntress main on PS4, it is very difficult to play these particular killers on console unfortunately because of the controller and frames however if you stick with it, it does become possible to play the only setback is the frames, hopefully we don't get cucked by bhvr and we actually see an optimization fix by summertime. If we do expect to see more players giving them a try especially the nurse because I feel she is who suffers the most of the killers in terms of the shitty frames on console.
---
From the advice I've been given and my experience;
---
Survivor: Meg has good perks for escaping.  Claudette has a great healing set.  Dwight can be a good team player.  Feng has good personal perks for different things. Otherwise it is all personal.
---
Killer: Bubba is a good starter. So are the trifecta of the OG killers. Depending on who they like, you can recommend them killers with a similar game plan. I.E. they like traps? Hag can be a good alternative. They like stealth? Myers is a good pick. They like Tracking? Doctor is great at anti-stealth. It is really their choice.
---
I actually started with Feng Min because it took me forever to get skill checks down and Technician helped me out!
---
I don’t mind them at all but tombstones is where it draws the line for me
---
But legion is good
---
Ooo interesting 
---
Thanks!
---
I'm pretty sure this hasn't been posted before.
---
I do that the other way. Shirtless dies first. 
---
What can I say? I’m just a very lucky guy... I’m sure some of it will rub off on you.
---
thats an interesting list. thrilled to see Freddy not in F
---
Ignore them.  They're being petty.
---
i mean it's situational but i would say i use chainsaw more than m1. it's just a matter of efficiency. chainsaw its a insta down. ofc if they are injured i use m1. it's all about doing things as fast as possible 
---
Yea Trapper is the only killer, i can really only see being F with good addons. even when he runs noed, I don't mind much
---
I had a mori daily with the doctor. Got destroyed and teased for 6 matches. Lost my only ebony mori.
---
Finally I had a yellow mori and the last guy thought it would be a good idea to click his flashlight at me by the gate.
---
Noed + the yellow mori got me my 60k points!
---
My point is, it some latency issues will definitely happen in a multiplayer game designed around melee hits being so important. So you can't be realistically expecting every single issue listed in the video above to be fixed.
---
Some of those issues are horrible tho like being hit by killer 10m away.

1 DS. Zero other "toxic" perks.

1 brown medkit. Rank 15s and a fresh 20.
---
Killer has noed.
---
Every time the killer sacrifices a survivor Shaggy drop kicks the entity and the survivor doesn’t die. 12/10 IGN
---
To be fair, Mikey's P3 mask is intimidating. 
---
if the switch "COULDN'T" run this game it wouldn't be getting ported, the switch may not be as powerful as the xbone and ps4 but this game looks and runs like a 360 game in my opinion and the switch is capable of a lot more than we think it is and i think we may be pleasantly surprised by this port, but i agree with others that starting over from scratch is going to be annoying so I am not completely sold yet. However the switch is fully capable of running the 30fps i believe that, the switch is capable of a lot that hasn't been done yet on the system, its insides are actually quite powerful for what it is. If BHVR would let people transfer accounts from one system to another then this version would probably sell better but i'm pretty sure hell will be sitting under 30 feet of snow before BHVR has any kind of Data transfer or cross play lol
---
They were teabagging all over the place, flashlight spamming and the game ended with 2 gens remaining
---
It certainly is! It was modeled to fit my face perfectly, so maybe I have a small head? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Well I would just rather have my own connection be the reason for those hits, not someone else's. That will hopefully happen with servers.
---
addons make it take longer. and in my opinion if you are gonna use one of the addons, bring either bloody coil or trapper bag.
---
Same
---
I know that feeling. It is so satisfying to se that annoying piece of Nea finally go down. 
---
You prestige for prestige, or perfect camo in some cases.
---
Not sure. It has been over a year since I last had a P3 killer.
---
Yeah but you shodnt have to use an add on just to make a killer viable 
---
i'd like to imagine that this guy slams a pallette so hard into the face of the killer that the pallette breaks instantly and he just falls the fuck over 
---
it is safe but just note that there is risks about it and the devs said if you do get banned for it one day they will not be unbanning 
---
Because if you couldn't disarm his traps, he'd be overpowered as fuck. Basically he'd be just like Hag, except every time a trap was triggered it would be an instant down.
---
Fight people playing the game by playing the game also? 🤔
---
Name me 1 counter to legion (and doing the fucking objectives aint one which he has a counter to) he atill sucks but think about this and you will find out he has 0 counterplay. 
---
Michael does, but they are hard to see through the eyeholes of the mask
---
This can be taken 2 different ways, “baby killer”
---
they were but everyone downvotes anyway
---
Yeah but then the other person would always be at a disadvantage. Lets imagine two situations during the lag in which game sets your connection as a priority:
---
- You are playing killer and on your screen the survivor is right near you, on their screen they are however have run 20 meters away. They'll have a bluetooth hit then
---
- You are playing in a reversed situation as a survivor. Killer will have you blinking like a Nurse on their screen without being able to hit you.
---
What I hope is dedicates servers would eliminate such extreme cases, but a subtler variations will still appear, as there can be only one result of the hit/not hit check that can be defined as a registered for both players. And the game should be fair as possible to everyone, not just to you or just to me. That's why some small shit will unavoidably happen
---
In my opinion, Spirit should be in S, Billy at top of A, and Pig somewhere in B.
---
*^(this post by P3 Claudette gang)*
---
😂😂😂 people only play leatherface for that perk!
---
imagine listing billy as S tier
---
A nice Chase build with vault master
---
Enduring, Brutal strength, Fire up, Bamboozle.
---
And meme builds such as burgering and slow shit 
---
A good Pig is high B tier. Hurts to see my favorite killer in second last tier. But it's probably not too far from the truth of baseline Pigs.
---
By the logic of previous releases, they should drop a teaser today, and then PTB on tuesday, but you never know.
---
Why would I lie? For fake internet points? 
---
Come on, buddy 
---
THERES A PERK (OR OFFERING?) THAT RESETS YOUR TRAPS AUTOMATICALLY BUT IDK WHAT ITS CALLED
---
I didnt say that you shouldnt be able to disarm it would just take more time or something
---
They never give dates, because they never ever hit them.
---
Ah, the times where Iron Grasp was a MUST because all hooks would be permanently sabotaged... loved and hated it.
---
Mike can kill them outright. No hooks, no hits. Just raw sexy murder.
---
I'd say he is more fun- he has more build varieties  that can be played very differently, but not stronger per se.
---
That's more about needing a toolbox to disarm them. Longer disarms would be kinda nice, but the buff I really want to see is being able to carry two traps at once.
---
Don't forget blue hair Nea
---
This happened to my fucking streamer
---
Does Huntress have a big jiggle-physics belly?  
---
No?  
---
**BOOM! DUNKED ON!**
---
No, you should always leave the last generators clumped together. It's tactically sound and will ensure victory for sure, and not that the killer will kill you and your family and your twitch followers.
---
What? I'm not a killer main. Don't be ridiculous.
---
Actually, I can name some:
---
- Having some sort of exhaustion perk. It will just make them loose their Frenzy before they are able to hit you
---
- Break LOS while they're vaulting in Frenzy. I did it lots of times, their FOV is really limited  while in vaulting animation, and without scratchmarks you are boom - gone
---
- Run away as soon as you hear their TR. Yeah, not a fancy one but the best counter to Legion is just to stay away from them. Legion are no Nurse
---
- Mess with spinning after window vaults. This won't work 100%, but sometimes it makes Legion loose their Frenzy if they miss
---
Don't get me wrong, Legion is still shit. It's just that some form of counterplay can be named
---
What’s sadder is that they don’t even need to play the character to get the perk, just level him up. 
---
I don't know, why are you lying?
---
I see... impressive!
---
For me.. its always the P3 Claudette... ive killed every one ive seen
---
I think it's just worth it not to have the extra mouse click telling you the advantages of prestiging every bloodweb.
---
Clown looks like he’s just seen something you never want to dude 
---
C H O N K Y
---
No with correctly done servers that's not gonna happen. Basically the server knows the position of all the players, and that will check if something hit. So if you have good connection you will also see others as they truly are according to the server. 
---
you make it sound like there's only 2 extremes on the spectrum and nothing in between. i never said the game is supposed to be looping swf with flashlights. i dont quite understand what you mean by loop them infinitely because jungle gyms are def not infinites. there's way to play around those, that's a skill set you NEED to have in order to be high level killer imo. it's all about the route you take / the route you make the survivor go, mind gaming the survivor to take the route you want not the ones they please. there's ways to deal with looping , it only takes forever if you allow it to happen. if you are respecting pallets ofc a good survivor will abuse that. that's a skill set you need to develop as a 'normal' killer (trapper, billy, etc etc) which nurse take away completely. sure you have to master blinking, but you dont need to mindgame or play structures right. that's THE challange as a dbd killer (at least for me). i play killer and survivor just as much, rank 1 every month on both, so i'm not saying this as a survivor main that can't deal with this or that. i too deal with all that stuff, such as chasing in god gyms, T/L walls, looping pallets etc etc. i just think if you can skip thru all of those aspects, which are the fundamentals of dbd and that's why those are in the game for survivors to play around those, it's def a gamebreaking ability. 
---
Hard to define, because they can move around based on perks &amp; add-ons a lot more than others.
---
Also meme-tier.
---
how the fuck can she see outta that thing

Technically ultra rares and commons are still in the game you just gotta download a icon mod to show it

Dodge dodge dodge. It's the newest fad. I wonder what's going to happen when the new match making is in effect where everyone loads in at once.
---
"Yare yare daze." - Claudette, probably
---
congrats on wiping a team that had a disadvantage! 
---
imagine throwing the game because a survivor hurt your feelings by performing an action in the game that has no impact on the match whatsoever.
---
What about Jeff. Thiccest girl in the game
---
Wait, isn't that what the current We'll Make It looks like?
---
But why it won't happen with correctly done servers? There's always a delay before the server knows what's going on on your gaming device, and in case with dedicated servers also some delay before it tells you what's going on on gaming devices of other players. You can't set up the servers in such a way that there won't be any delay of in/out
---
Or when an axe from Huntress hits you through a tree trunk wider than you.
---
If you play this game a lot then you should prestige as soon as you reach 50. if you don't prestige and continue putting levels above 50 and then change your mind that's gonna be a lot of wasted bloodpoints.
---
Ugh I really hope not! I’ve been dying for some kind of teaser... I think they’ve released teasers in the past when there wasn’t a dev stream so I dunno we’ll see 
---
*Laughs while covering half the map in pink fog as survivors try and fail to loop everytime*
---
As I said before "I would just rather have my own connection be the reason for those hits, not someone else's." If there are correctly done servers, my connection would be the only reason I would see bs hits.
---
The video doesn't work?
---
Premonition is a must perk for me, I don't understand why it's not popular at all. 
---
I like how that it's right under TREACHERY
---
Omg, you can't even be mad at that, that's too funny 
---
This is so cute :3
---
Often times the survivors see different ping in the lobby than the killer does. It’s quite an annoyance honestly. 
---
I wouldn’t get my hopes up too much, who’s to say it’s not something as simple as “deep wound status will now be applied to after a successful decisive strike”. That seems right up their alley.
---
Well ain't that just a kick in the danger clam
---
Objectively I find it kinda good that prestiging doesn't change the odds, because killers who do prestige already have a lot of hours and don't need the extra advantage of rare addons when they will be pitted against people with way less hours because of the wonderful ranking system
---
But it hella pisses me off that they say that it betters your chances when it doesn't, that's just a barefaced lie which counts on people who wouldn't be prestiging for the outfits but doing so now because of that hope for better addons. For shame, bhvr
---
Thank you for all your hard work OP!
---
Looks real good, even if people dont have the game as a reference it's cool enough on its own for halloween.
---
The whole marketing for "no cure no pay" the US system has for legal concerns is scary as shit. The justice system should be for justice, not for making a quick buck on an injury.
---
Legion is bottom tier.
---
Judging by 2008, he is probably 10-11 years old. Jesus I would've shit my pants that age if I played dbd.
---
It would cause the perk to go from shit tier to like c+ and not in anyway op so why not?
---
Why?
---
Thats the meme. You are saluting the bill that sacrificed themself for you
---
lol i forgot to add the part where the killer main is saying "matchmaking sucks" 
---
If it's a swf there's a good chance you're not throwing by camping, a good chunk of swf try to rescue them.
---
  
---
Anyhow, I don't have to get 4k to enjoy a game. If there's an annoying survivor I consider my game won by making sure he gets sacrificed.
---
I disagree, without addons huntress lacks a lot of the power she has with them, hag on the other hand hardly loses any lethality without addons. 
---
Wraith because most of them at my rank camp
---
Hag because of the teammates not crouching despite having urban evasion
---
Funny how one of my worst survivor memories is a bill unhooking me right when the doctor passes by the hook since he was chasing a claudette that tought it was a good idea to run past the hook. Anyways, I got unhooked, the doctor turned around, smacked me down and bill did not have borrowed time
---
I FIND THE WORST PLACE FOR DEAD ZONES FOR NURSE IS AROUND THE BOAT IN PALE ROSE SWAMP, I'M CONSTANTLY GETTING STUCK AROUND THE ROCKS AND THE EDGE OF THE BOAT THERE AND IT PISSES ME OFF EVERYTIME, FUCK THE SWAMP.
---
When people disconect and I am the killer then I try to help survivors but sometimes they are stupid cunts and they still avoid me. 
---
Clown above hag? Huntress below clown and myers? I don’t know about this one chief. 
---
Without addons clown is kinda meh and Myers without addons is also not something I’d call great. 
---
Fkn hag man, omg its so annoying whens theres like 20 traps in one jungle gym
---
Because ages ago, trapper could trap hooks and camp. It was total aids to play against and his traps took years to disarm. Instead of reverting the newer trap changes, they decided to just reduce the disarm time. Obviously you cant camp trapped hooks anymore, but i guess they never changed it back.
---
oh well trapper is dead anyway
---
Ace already seduced every killer, Entity included
---
because they install a custom version of EAC that doesn't do anything and doesn't trigger Steam's quick validation method
---
EAC is notoriously awful, anybody with the internet can do a quick google search, make a family share account, and start ruining people's fun. You'll get banned after enough people report you but hackers don't care and just make another family share account.
---
we are trying our best please
---
Cursed image
---
Billy. I never survive against him.
---
What's my discount?
---
I hope she still can throw hatchets. Russian thiccness needs her hatchets
---
But Dr. Phil is a Claudette Main, He prefers to go against a clown then a huntress any day
---
Will do! :)
---
Or BHVR can stop being cock-ends and make it so it appears at some point. At this point the conspiracy theories of them not putting on BBQ so people buy the shameful Leatherface dlc, is all but confirmed.
---
I main huntress tho...
---
Those perks kind of clash though if they're the obsession 
---
Clown has less skins than legion, who came out two chapters after him. BHVR pls
---
I don't know why i don't close the game, i just wait it out and load in to a 3/2/1 vs 1 and get one hooked :/
---
Legion used to be my favorite killler, till i realized he's just an edgy guy who got 3 people to become edgy with him and kill people, he's now just meh and I play him every now and then, I'd much rather see some more survivor fan art than killer. I don't dislike killer fan art, its just that 99 percent of the time its all I ever see
---
0/10 no stalking
---
I get why you'd DC in the case of a BS hitbox or lag like in this case. But most of the DCs I get are salty DS users who missed it or just horribly misplayed a loop and DCed on their first down to deny a hook. 
---
Also believe me as someone who plays both sides a lot killers have to deal with similar wonky issues with weird window hitboxes, vaulting, auto-aim etc. that only seems more exacerbated by the last patch. The game's janky as hell for both sides.
---
What an awesome idea for a gamemode. Very well put together and explained, something I think would greatly benefit the game. Good work with this 👍
---
I’m just offering up my guess as to what I think the change will be. The person I was replying to seemed to believe it’s going to be this big change that will get people to stop using it, I really doubt that will be the case. That’s all I’m saying. 
---
Knowing BHVR, it'll turn out to be a buff 
---
*Laughs in toxic Nea*
---
Freddy, legion and the clown.Ughhh really annoying 😭😭😭
---
I think the pig and doc should both be in the C tier.
---
That's what worries me too.
---
Not really.
---
They really should've just kept changes to DS a secret until PTB or close to release. Every survivor main out there will be wanting run the good ol' D Strike while they still can if the changes seem like a nerf.
---
I'm glad they're changing it but saying hey guys get your 4 man ds squad games in fast isn't the best way to lead up to it.
---
He was different. He had a chainsaw flick so if he swung his chainsaw after a sprint, it would still hit you
---
NOED enables that because they have a crutch to fall back on.
---
After DS is nerfed, we pester them to nerf NOED too.
---
7 days gives you enough time to stock shards, for me anyway. 
---
I think they play him for the extra bp’s
---
I guess I just don't get as offended as most of you when a survivor teabags me, I still see it as a dumb thing to get upset about.
---
I hate the Trapper because I pride myself on my looping abilities and Trapper negates that
---
BECAUSE THAT WOULDN’T BE BALANCED. 
---
True lol
---
And the original comment you replied to was joking.
---
Once a week is perfectly fine and fits well with how shards are earned. Don't be entitled 
---
Damn right then I camp them
---
If another studio did this, I would think "Hmmmm how mysterious of them to not stream, they must be cooking something big". But since it's BHVR I'll be kind and just say they are lazy.
---
It helps that Huntress's Hatchets are Broken AF
---
LEGION ISN’T A FUN NOR REWARDING KILLER TO GO AGAINST. 
---
no
---
pls
---
just fix trapper pls
---
"cleansing totems is literally impossible" - a delusional survivor main
---
Thought her elbow was a titty at first
---
PLS tell me you killed him, teabagged him and then ate him.
---
I can generally run every killer but a good trapper. Its very subtle but some trappers know how to herd you towards that trapped gym, window, or pallet loop. I often step in traps. Boo. 
---
Yeah, samesies.
---
DBD IS A P2P GAME. THEY DON’T HAVE SERVERS ITS HOSTED ON YOUR CONNECTION. 
---
Apparently Freddy needs to be extra punished for someone else running Adrenaline so sure why not
---
Shhhhh. You're one with the survivor meta now... Let it envelop you... Your skin is now darker, your clothes bloody as you become the Claudette you were destined to be... All hail the pink flashlight..
---
Words cannot express how much I LOVE this idea. Killer mains don't realise how bad of a grind the game is until they start trying survivor. As a killer, you can have a bad match and have all survivors escape but still get 30k in a lot of situations.
---
Whilst, as a survivor you could get great saves do gens and loop the killer a lot (generally what you'd consider a good game) and get 20k, if you're lucky. I have plenty of games that give me mediocre amounts of BP where I felt I deserved a lot more. This idea not only fixes this problem, but also encourages teamplay, you would want as many alive as possible for the BP rewards. 
---
The sad part is that during double BP i had so much fun because of the BP i was earning. It felt like that should be the amount I was earning in any game tbh 
---
NOED is extremely situational and easily countered.
---
That said a timer on the exposed status would be rational and the speed boost stays permanent 
---
Depends on the nerf. I do want changes but I don’t want them to completely make it useless. Also sorta hoping that sooner or later they will change NOED as well since a lot of us feel it’s the same as DS ik some ppl will disagree and I still think both of them are bad 
---
This short movie was great.
---
「ｓｔａｎｄ」, *"Purple Flashlight"*
---
User, P3 Claudette
---
They are a business after all they do want ppl to buy the dlcs as well and that would only make ppl just wait. Honestly we are even lucky we get the shrine of secrets 
---
Horse face 
---
You should probably have stated "when there's no danger". If the killer is camping/facecamping (which is perfectly fine to do when the gates are open to just secure a kill) you should leave. When the killer has NOED, look for the totem but if you can't find it don't just suicide for the sake of looking morally in the right, you're just giving the killer more kills.
---
If the killer is nowhere nearby the hook but the survivors don't even bother checking and just teabag at the gates, then they can go to hell. But don't expect them to come save you from. the basement against a proxy camp leatherface. 
---
Well, that made me laugh way too much 
---
i hate when that shit happens, last time i got stuck 1 minute in that animation, 2 gens popped during that time.
---
What about a mime skin
---
I played a few months after the release; didn't play too often because of all the bugs but I had my Jake at lvl 40 bloodweb when the cutoff for legacy happened, I'm still sad about that lol; Pretty sure I still have all the moon offerings on my P3 Jake
---
They can’t because Pennywise is licensed
---
Well thats something i can go through.
---
How would his pallet perk effect unrelenting? Like would it match it back to the normal stun or would it overpower it?
---
Awww😞
---
This sounds suspicious but maybe you're right, you seem genuine.
---
Wait, wut? I've been bitching and bitching about DS and this is the first I've heard of actual changes happening. I was just about to ask if there was a stream and saw this post. 
---
Where did OP hear this? And if you made this up then I'll play Freddy with Black Box and Dying Light and Ivory Mori to fuck up someone's game out of spite. I am that kind of dude. 
---
I don't know if that is true, but it honestly wouldn't surprise me at this point. 
---
Noed is less likely to recieve a nerf untill end game is fixed. Because at the moment if the killer doasnt have noed and the end game arrives, there is nothing much you can do to kill survivors.
---
Sorry that it was my first round? Gotta start somewhere, I just started playing this game a bit ago. 
---
You cant on the console itself. You have to download the xbox app.
---
I know :(
---
It is the year of the pig, after all 😂
---
Ya that is true but eh it’s still a pain and rewards bad play but I see what you mean. I do wonder what changes they have planned for after game
---
a bit of hope to keep it fed.
---
KNEW SOMEONE WAS GOING TO COMMENT THAT. REGARDLESS, ITS A HORRIBLE NETWORK EXPERIENCE. THERES NO WAY IN HELL 6 STRAIGHT GAMES GOT DC’D MIDGAME DUE TO MY CONNECTION. 
---
ILL AMEND MY ORIGINAL COMMENT TO SAY FUCK THIS GAME UNTIL THEY GET DECICATED SERVERS
---
Based on the wiki and that picture it's not changed? In the picture the level 3 is a 100% increase and on the wiki a level 3 is a 100% increase. [Link to Wiki about We'll make it.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/We%27ll_Make_It)
---
Wait what’s going on ? Haven’t played DBD for a few days. 
---
They already said they are working on that too... hopefully something to end hatch stand offs.
---
you could argue that the sample size still wasnt big enough to make this really precise. a few lucky unprestiged bloodwebs and a few unlucky prestiged bloodwebs and you get messed up results. 
---
did you subtract the nodes with perks from your total number of nodes? early levels have way less things to unlock, so it kind of falsifies the final result as it implies that every bloodweb is "worth" the same, even though a higher percentage of nodes at lower level cant be "very rare". at least if you try to be scientifically accurate
---
but i guess its safe to say, that prestige doesnt change the drop rate significantly enough to be worth the grind for the higher drop rate. cosmetics and feeling bad about the "wasted" bloodpoints are the only reasons to prestige
---
This community have been complaining about these things for quite some time. Not sure what you are talking about.
---
Glad the bouqetes got removed.
---
I feel... sad. ): 
---
The comunity roadmap is where its announced. The post is gonna drop 14:00 EST.
---
"Chase survivors for a total of 3 minutes as The Nurse"
---
Darn, I was hoping teaser this week/PTB next because I’m off all of next week
---
as a survivor main I thank you with all of my heart lol
---
More prestige levels would be nice. Something similar call of dutys prestige system.
---
And one of those rank 18's having been more then likely a de-ranked survivor having Feng perks as well as a Claudette teachable. Also they are also rank 18 Soo...
---
McLean did confirm P3 does nothing.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/EsteemedHeartlessPeanutBleedPurple
---
That's cool bro just dont come here bragging about beating noobs like it's impressive.
---
Whatever it will be: Know not everyo e will be pleased and alot of hate posts will follow.
---
finally someone captured my good angle
---
Ok that makes it much more fucking impressive.
---
Did you just watermark dr.phil
---
Killer main spotted. 
---
Keep wasting time for on that mister "all survivors are a well oiled machine", NOED is a bad bandait to lack of secondary objectives. Personally I laugh when I walk past multiple of my cleansed totems as killer, no NOED and I'm getting rewarder for it.
---
Ruin is so prominent because it has the POTENTIAL to slow the game down to a pace where killer can win. When you play without ruin you might as well play the sonic drowning music as you play.
---
D-strike is good for noobs because it is training wheels, and it is good for better survivors because it is a free extra chase. That is almost the worst thing that can happen for the killer.
---
The different between ruin and d-strike is Ruin is many people's bandaid fix to a core issue with the game, D-strike is just really exploitable.
---
What’s important is you’ve made sure to let everyone know you’re superior to them by acting a certain way in a video game. 
---
Aren’t I equally a noob if it was my first time though? It’s not like I’ve played killer a lot if at all. Therefore I should I a right to be proud of my first attempt and therefore it was an impressive first time
---
XD
---
trapper through fire and the flames
---
frank pulls out his mixtape and it's just fire and the flames
---
that's it
---
thats the mixtape
---
That's my point, hahah. That pointing it out is enabling/spreading the use of it. I personally don't use the moonwalk glitch, because I don't have enough patience for that.
---
Small frames yes, quieter no. Ace and Tapp are the most quiet survs
---
this power has taken only few before you. use this blessing of the entity to your greatest advantage, my friend.
---
So there is no dev stream again? Last week there wasn't one as well.
---
I approve of your level of immersion.
---
Well not sure but in any case it would be way better than the killer having the advantage even when it's his connection's fault.
---
Huntress has the highest skill cap of all killers imo. I think it is much harder to play an amazing huntress than it is to play an amazing nurse. If you’re bad at the game, then huntress is 0% absolute TRASH. But if you’re bad at the game, you can still get something done with Nurse.
---
Ace doesn't even need deliverance to get off hooks, the entity destroys the hook before anyone can even try XD
---
My only issue with the reasoning is that Myers is totally gimped on certain maps without the right builds. Legit that Hag and Huntress are map dependent, tho.
---
I’ve had this game for over a month but hated playing killer the few times I played so I only played survivor. So yes, it was my like 3rd time as killer and 1st time as the Pig.....
---
The hitboxes are so fucked
---
Damn that clown timing the pallet drop what a boss
---
I mean I can say he’s a good killer but he doesn’t do anything different from any other half decent killer I’ve played against, he just believes he’s so smart for doing things any killer should be. He’s just a popular streamer.
---
As I’ve mentioned, I was a survivor main. I practically never played killer thus I’m a very new player when it comes to being a killer. All I have said is true (also a lot more fluently than yourself)
---
To be fair before Spirit, Huntress was the firm number 3 spot for most people and Spirit is still relatively recent by comparison, it's what was practically burned into memory with how little killers move in tier lists.
---
3 man games should be fixed. They are poorly balanced and it's a waste of offerings, addons and items
---
Killer knocks her  the fuck out and hang her on a hook. Then she flames in post game chat like it is the killers fault she lost because she wanted to troll.
---
I love going into games in huntress and burning yellow or brown map offerings and how people freak out like WHAT IS THAT
---
Agreed. The Haste Effect is too much. 
---
Ugh, I know right 
---
Bubba and Freddy
---
No matter what, I am always awful against Myers.  I have only escaped once against a Meyers and that's because they were repeatedly pressing hit the whole game😂
---
9 times out of 10 my grab animation never works :D
---
I think it's the duration time of the perk. Not sure, I'm not a veteran, couldn't really read the text in the image and didn't fact check
---
Many windows, easy to hide, confusing structure, no open field of view for Nurse and Huntress.
---
I hate boil over because that stupid icon is in the bottom left of the screen for the rest of the match. Otherwise it does nothing. 
---
Pretty much. It's going to be just like when the BNP nerf was announced and everyone ran the fucking things for 2 weeks straight. You were basically forced to dodge lobbies where more than one guy had a toolbox. 
---
I guess I'll use Clown more until the nerf happens. If it happens. 
---
That’s a cool one
---
r/dbdgonewild 
---
I'll just leave this here.
---
Everyone is fucked on corn except billy and clown really.
---
&gt;girls
---
:(
---
I think a totem counter and perhaps a time limit on exposed is all that’s really needed. The counter for sure though. If everyone knows there’s 2 totems left, for example, and they still choose to not bother....it’s fair game. It’s stupid though when you cleanse 2 yourself and have no idea if the other 3 are done.
---
pft i made the same thing a few months ago and i got nothing 4 it. rigged system
---
No way you dodged all the edgy, "toxic" players. I have like 70 messages on xbox.
---
Probably Hag. And it's not even that she's hard to deal with. It's her traps. Turning my camera any time I set one off just completely throws me off sometimes.
---
Better be Dr. Bees
---
Well, you're a cute Huntress, I'll give you that!
---
Another false claim for the game (giving better stuff in the bloodweb).
---
Seeing the nearly static pattern of generation over and over again really hammered in how useless prestige is. I'll still do it because I'm a grindy masochist. Was glad to be of help but man I kept expecting some sort of change or variance but instead it was just counting how the uncommons/commons changed from most webs.
---
Buy leatherface, he and his perks are Worth it
---
lol
---
How in fuck names is the trapper so low and spirit to high?
---
That is really strange
---
I read this in a kermit the frog voice and i feel it might be accurate to the anime.
---
Even knowing this,  I'm probably still only going to prestige each killer once for the free weapon cosmetic but very good post
---
Sorry can’t hear you down there up on my high horse😂
---
It doesn't appear until they hit someone
---
Honnestly, t bags are kind of sad to me, im not getting triggered by them, I just think that people who t bags just forget that they are playing an horror game
---
Tyvm!
---
I partially understand your argument, but at the same time, if you’re driving and the person next to you flips you the bird, do you just ignore them? I mean, maybe, but a lot of people would react in at least some way. It’s moreso the intent to disrespect or upset than just the basic action. 
---
It was hilarious 
---
Excuse me what the fuck?
---
As awful as NOED is, it's only a thing at the very end of the game and if everyone takes out a totem or 2 it very well won't even be a factor.  It ends up becoming a big crutch to prop up most killers in the game that just straight up are dogshit at high ranks against competent groups.
---
As terrible as NOED is it has at least a counter and if you think you encounter it every game just destroy totems as you come across them, you get bloodpoints, killer gets denied a whole perk, win win.
---
DS doesn't have any kind of counter though and ends up buying survivors a TON of time unless you are a good nurse.  Then again a good nurse can just kinda do anything she wants.
---
Actual footage of [NOED](https://twitter.com/savinthebees/status/1079467980717678592?s=21) 
---
I HATE IT WHEN OTHER SURVIVORS ARE TOXIC INGAME AND THEN IN THE AFTER CHAT THE KILLER THINKS IT WAS ME EVEN THOUGH I SAY GG AND STUFF. NOW SOMEONE THINKS I WAS TOXIC AND I WANTED TO SET IT RIGHT SO I ADDED HIM ON STEAM BUT HE ACCEPTED AND JUST SAID STAY SALTY AND IMMEDIATELY BLOCKED ME SO I COULDN'T EXPLAIN.
---
Oh I love Clown's laughs and CSGO twirls.
---
going with the joke doesn't prevent you from being criticized 
---
Looooooooool
---
I quit prestiging once I saw it doesn’t seem to affect much. I got my favorite survivor and killer to P3 all perks and will just work on all perks no prestige for everyone else. As much as I love the game there is no way I’d ever get anywhere close to putting in the hours to fully complete everyone. 
---
I mean yes...I do, at worse I'll think "hmm what did I do?" but will quickly forget about it. It's not like I'll ram my car into him and destroy both our cars just to teach him a lesson.
---
I felt that, god damn.
---
probably because spine chill is way better
---
good ideas, i always thought survival points were overly polarizing
---
I honestly think people forget. Whenever I play him, I usually do fairly well. 
---
His big issue is that he’s so bad, no one really plays him all that much. This means that people never are prepared, and totally forget his strengths (the few that he has). 
---
Personally, when playing survivor, I tend to run premonition. It’s always a godsend against Freddy, and I know it’s not entirely situational due to it working no matter who I play against.  I’ll never forget that week of dominance. 
---
And those kind of teammates are very worthy of respect, I just don't think it's right to judge people for NOT coming back to save someone. Most of the time it's a smart move.
---
^(Also I was making a RE2 reference. :p)
---
Everyone knows Shaggy can only use his powers with his divine voice. No voice acting in DBD = No godlike Shaggy
---
Clown is quite situational, he has amazing down potential at certain areas on all maps but in others he just doesn’t hold the same potential.
---
Myers is quite map dependant as any map with lots of objects are a challenge to deal with against good survivors.
---
Hag is hardly map dependant and is possibly in the top 3 killers for a large amount of them.
---
Huntress is kinda map dependant but she is so good on some of them that I find it hard to put her low on the list only because of the two indoor maps. 
---
Clown and Myers are kinda both survivor dependant. Good survivors will rarely lose to a Myers as it will take him ages to get the chance to snowball and gens will typically be almost fully completed and clown is kinda unreliable for the reasons I explained earlier. 
---
just cleanse totems, its as simple as that
---
Not in my 2 years of playing have I heard someone call it Claw Marks
---
Fool that's exactly what he wants you to think
---
Because he was teabagging on a pallet?
---
I have to ask; did Freddy get his 4k?
---
Trapper and Clown for sure.  A good trapper takes away all the strongest loops and makes you second guess using any given loop.  Clown for a very similar reason.  He greatly cuts your loops short and forces early hits and pallet tosses.
---
Jeff is such a kind soul though!  Literally the most wholesome of the survivors.
---
Depends on if I know the gate is open. If I have a chance to stop a gate from being opened I do that. Plus I care more about the immersion in the game than getting point. Just standing by a hook is boring (not to say I haven't done it before though) none of us are perfect lol.
---
Not really a fan of Susie's mask but Susie is Bae. This looks really good! How well can you see through the cracks?
---
okay, I get it, you made your opinion clear in the last message. I disagree but that's not the point. I don't see these perks used and I don't understand why. 
---
he did!
---
Ranking system explained:  
---
1-4: Sweaty killers in red ranks  
---
5-8: Sweaty killers in purple ranks  
---
9-12: The worst killers (babies) unless rank reset  
---
13-15: Smurfing deranking killers who crush you  
---
16-20: A mix of babies and rank reset
---
I like the sound of that. It's a good name for the bonus. 
---
Loading stalls most often if you're alt+tabbed out and loading any streamed video.  I'm not sure why this co-relates but I've found this to be a significant factor.
---
Just say no to alt+tabbing out during game loading.
---
Wraith, Trapper, and Leatherface tend to attract the 50iq players for reason. They'll tunnel, camp, and have NOED most of the time. 
---
If anything being the obsession lets the killer know "Don't go for that person until I have to because they will just use ds and make my time spent wasted"
---
Oh man you have no idea.
---
Myself and others have had situations where where find and cleanse 4 totems, can't find the last, assume that the other 3 survivors have surely done 1 totem between them but nope, NOED still activates.
---
It’s only like a 5 second stun. If they were hard to get the first time, then just go after someone else.
---
I’m not gonna waste the whole game chasing someone who I can’t catch, catch them and get D-striked, get upset and then chase them again.
---
That’s stupid. 
---
I agree 1000% the survival category needs a rework, I always thought there needs to be more ways of acquiring survival points, such as getting unhooked in the killer’s terror radius should be “Near death escape” or something, or escaping a really long chase should give you survival rather than just boldness.
---
But as a killer main, there is a fair balance in points as the killer has 4 jobs, chasing, hooking, defending gens and preventing escape, it’s a much more stressful role to fill.
---
Survivors on the other hand only worry about doing gens and saving others. A survivor of solo, dies can immediately start another match, putting their point game above others depending on how long the previous match went on for.
---
Survivors also have access to items that can hasten or decelerate a killer’s momentum, I.e flashlights, firecrackers or DS.
---
Neither side of the spectrum is overpowered or underpowered, the game solely depends on SWF, survivor skill level and items &amp; perks in play.
---
NOED isn't situational at all.  If you aren't up against a swf randoms will not take out 5 dulls.  You will get your brainless 1 shot down on at least one survivor everytime.  I face rank 1 Billy's using that babydick crutch.  Trust me with randoms in game there is nothing situational about NOED.
---
I tried my best, daddy ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Im not sure where your getting those numbers from my dude. It only takes less than 16 seconds to heal if the person healing is running some sort of perk, which most people dont in my experience. Plus, even if your numbers are correct Im perfectly willing to spend an extra 15 seconds to not be found immediately. I also dont think Im overestimating at all, especially if you are in the purple ranks. It seems those ranks are the worst for all those cheese strats. 
---
It’s “Stabby” you uncultured swine
---
The problem there is that it still gaurentees a free escape. If they go down near the exit gates or hatch there is literally nothing you can do oter than pick them up and hope that they miss the skillcheck.
---
Interesting - we only have to pay for the new or license killers...
---
I've taken out 4 myself multiple games and still eaten that braindead NOED down from a baby killer at rank 1.  Randos don't take put dulls and killers of all ranks use that crutch now that it insta downs at all levels. 
---
MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA!
---
ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!
---
Yes! I also did the huntress! Thank you so much, I hope I can get into 3D modeling soon because there are so many things i want to build ;-;
---
Idk, I kinda get what you mean but I'm definitely not the one to judge because I post a lot about bought merchandise heh
---
Agreed. It wont get you anything. Unless you have only 1 survivor left,  then proxy camp is acceptable in my opunion
---
I have absolutely no knowledge on this situation. 
---
A good Freddy is an absolute motherfucker to deal with. Most people play Freddy in the worst manner (sleep one and chase them), so his power essentially never gets used in the way it's intended and then they come here and say "lol freddy weak". A good Freddy bounces between targets, has the best tracking, actually utilizes his built-in Ruin, and turns the game into a long grind
---
That's fair. I'm pretty firm in my belief that Spirit is just below Nurse simply because killers that can teleport at will&gt;killers that have to eat pallets.
---
It makes tier lists hard though as top 3 are definitely Nurse, Spirit, and Billy, but the divide between each of them and then the other killers is fairly large. I think Billy is closer to the non-warping killers than he is to Nurse and Spirit though.
---
My opinion would probably put Nurse+Spirit in S, then Billy alone in A, and shift all the others down, if that makes sense.
---
I have to say, as a survivor main I thoroughly enjoy running up to a locker, then stepping around behind it.  When the killer check the locker and doesn't find me, I rotate around the wall, and into the locker while he checks the wall behind the locker. lol
---
not an opinion, actual fact
---
You can’t break a promise made in a stream if there is no stream. 🤫
---
To me personally I have an easier time dodging hatches than that gas bomb. 
---
I would replace Myers with Legion.
---
I see them all the time at rank 1. They always face camp or run tombstone/mori/infinite tier 3 
---
Clown is not neutral friend lmao
---
"Meta" in this context meaning "in the meta-game", i.e. part of the pre-game consideration as to how best counter the opponent. For instance, Hex: Ruin is meta, because survivors typically want to complete the objective of generators as fast as possible and Ruin delays that.
---
That's some Vietnam flashback kind of shit right there.
---
Based on my rank 1 experience, clown mains usually are chill and just play normally.
---
I like the way you think! 
---
Sorry, but if he's NOED camping, Imma just yeet out the gate before its my ass on the hook.
---
The only reason I’m a killer main is because I can get BP much faster.
---
With BBQ 3 I can get 44K+
---
As a survivor I’m getting like 17k average. Depending if I’m tunneled etc. 
---
Especially with everyone waiting for bbq. Shouldve just purchased basement boy and leveled him during the events we just had.
---
Kenneth never asked for this, and yet here he is - somehow in more pain than usual.
---
Legion's style of play is annoying but it doesn't make Legion players gods of toxicity.
---
Thank you! Glad you liked it
---
No hooks but killers get moris. Survivors get bp for staying hidden and get accelerated bp for being in terror radius. This bonus stops once the chase music starts. No noed and no haunted ground. No decisive no deliverance. 
---
Trapper has such potential 
---
Oh, weird, I’ve been at red ranks and I don’t see them facecamp often, but I definitely agree with the OP add ons. I see where you’re coming from now.
---
PLEASE NO 
---
Where is this from?
---
SWF RAGE IN THE POST GAME CHAT CALLING ME A CAMPER WHILE I WAS PLAYING HAG. SAID I SHOULDN'T PLACE TRAPS BY A HOOKED SURVIVOR. MAD BC SOMEONE PLAYS HAG LIKE HAG SHOULD BE PLAYED? ALSO SAID I HAD TOO MANY TRAPS EVERYWHERE... CROUCH=COUNTERPLAY HAG... STOP RUNNING EVERYWHERE? 
---
They face camp me all the time
---
There was a bug where the ultra rare tier of a perk wouldn’t appear in the bloodweb until both lower tiers were already unlocked, which made them ridiculously hard to get. They basically just “downgraded” them to be equal instead of directly fixing the bug lmao 
---
Ah, a "game within a game". Man, language can get really tricky if not 'in the loop' on the lingo of the subreddit.
---
I appreciate the clarification 
---
Be careful, posting Legion videos around these parts. 
---
Id run tinkerer then. That comes useful and noed is just not good on billy. He already has an insta down power. So noed is just overkill. 
---
But you get points for chases
---
/s
---
He was actually trying to dribble Feng. If you watch it slowly you can see the first 2 frames of the pallet save animation after which it cuts to the drop animation. 
---
Ily so much
---
Moonwalking / following Blood is the most toxic thing in the game by far.
---
What actually happens when you die in midair I wonder ?
---
I think this is from iCarly 
---
Clown and Hag are lacking big time in the outfit department. 
---
I like the rework, however...
---
I feel like the true perk that encourages the killer to tunnel you is dying light.
---
Exactly
---
There was something interesting that people started to figure out just before the traps under hook thing got fixed.
---
If you started to unhook with the trap there, you would be forced into the trap and it would snap shut on you as soon as you lost the immunity from unhooking UNLESS the person being unhooked held down m1. If they did, the unhooked person would start disarming the trap before the unhooker lost their immunity which allowed the unhooker to get off the trap without it going off.
---
It was a pretty legit strat. 
---
It is a kill, but it is a really slow one
---
So you dced and screwed your team over? Seems like a DS gamer
---
Will you get to use the addons you have with him if you use it or does it just still give you the base with no perks or addons. I have a few of the plinters I got before I purchased the killers and am just curious
---
You still get the deviousness points for no one escaping but you don't get any points for that person in the sacrifice category (not counting any times you've hooked them before they bled out.)
---
I think I need to start hiding my perks, lol. 
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I see, thank you so much!
---
I don't get why everyone wants shirtless Myers. The memes just are what they are.
---
Nothing says that the change will make it through. They've skipped out on potential changes before.
---
.
---
Well I love them but I think pig is better fot the mindgamd potencial with ambush attack in high ranks. In lower ranks doc is stronger 
---
This happened to me on Monday, twice! I was so useless to my team. I didn't want to DC and put them at a disadvantage (and honestly I didn't want them to think I was a jerk who rage DC'd), so I just kept fucking up a gen until the killer found me and then led him on a chase as long as I could to keep him distracted (since it was literally \*all\* I could do...)
---
A Bill has to do, what a Bill has to do.
---
It’s not your fault if Kate died, it would be Jake’s. The hatch would’ve closed if you hadn’t escaped and then you both would’ve been screwed so it’s fine.

What? Thats wrong. The bug made it so that you'd get ALL the pink ones before getting any of the others. Only first few levels would give you common or uncommon perks, after that, all ultra rares. 
---
Actually get triggered when I drop a pallet, get the stun, and STILL get downed. 
---
Should be one way or the other. Either i get the stun and get away or I get downed. I hate getting downed but still wasting a pallet, there are barely any even without wasting them.
---
yeah dodging ping is fine, i do it as survivor. though I'm quite fair on it, whilst most people only settle for green ping, my limit is 280 which is still really dodgy and annoying but i just suck it up because queue times are gross. 
---
Next level idea; play the killer that can tbag back. Why did I not realize this sooner?
---
lmaoooo that's op af but i hardly used we'll make it back then so
---
yeah i know don't worry it was just a joke to say "imagine billy being s tier" because it was so long ago
---
Kate has a pair of really good perks equipped 100% of the time 
---
I am a mobile user and i feel offended
---
Howdy. I was in the middle of a game and didn't explain myself that well. What I was trying to get at was that the rarity bonuses might be too low to notice, so for most players, the outfit is the point of the prestige. I wouldn't currently recommend grinding the prestige to players only interested in better bloodwebs.
---
you know, you can play them?
---
You don’t understand how random numbers work, do you?
---
I'm not sure if you're a bad nurse but since 85% of the community is I'm going to assume you are and say adept nurse will be a pain in the ass. Adept David too. 
---
So. 5 totems right? Most killers in higher ranks play Ruin, so that’s one down, so 4 left. Most of us by now should know typical totem spawns - I haven’t been playing survivor long and I’m getting the hang of it. Cleansing a totem doesn’t break your chances of winning, it does what they intended. Lengthens the game so it’s not 3 gens popping off the rip in a chase. Sorry but it’s horrible feeling as a killer to see 3 pop in your first chase and it’s boring as a survivor to have it end so easily. While I agree totems aren’t say a “ fun”  objective... but a necessary one. I personally run small game and clear them all so I can help the team in another manner- also fun to sabotage hooks while I’m at it.
---
&gt; I swear this fear of DS is ridiculous. Most of the time someone used that on me, I can down them again in 10 to 15 sec.
---
At rank 20. That's what you forgot to add. Either that or you manage to down them again in 10-15 seconds in fucking fantasy land. No one fucking believes you. No one. 
---
Keep haste, exposed on timer, totem counter
---
very very true! haha
---
This is my opinion. Huntress gets looped easily because of her slow movement speed and Clown can stop looping and he has regular movement speed, so even though Huntress has that extra way to injure survivors making her a strong killer, Clown is up there simply because of that. 
---
So because they are playing with a cosmetic that grants no competitive advantage, you should play in a way that gives you a free win? I love entitled killer players.
---
You mean it will be bugged for 6 months and then fixed right :P
---
Half of This relief om the skill of the killer and Them not being numb in the head. Exhaustion only works if he has been in Firenze for more than half the duration if so the legion is a fucking idiot
---
This way officer, that's the reason we lost ds
---
bully and Teabag against a Huntress? GL
---
Then he D-Strikes you and you chase him for another 10 mins.
---
Yes they do.
---
I play solo and cleasne totems and I've played in 3 person SWF where the solo cleanses totem. This "solos don't cleanse totems!!1!" meme is just a weak excuse 
---
It's not hard to spend a little over a minute cleansing totems
---
Like if you guys are this scared of NOED just fucking do it good goddamn god
---
If you camp the last guy is gonna camp hatch. Very boring for both parties
---
Clown will always get value around vaults and pallets. Myers can get a bad map, but even on a bad map he can EW3 everyone to death. Even when huntress is good she is easy to track with her slow movements and her hum. Hag is torture on any open map.
---
Good survivors will rarely lose period, there is a reason nurse and hillbilly are on top, every other killer is weak.
---
Hatchets are easy to dodge. Huntresses are very predictable.
---
"Gameplay"
---
Shit pressed wrong flair
---
It would make buying a killer for their perks basically worthless, and you could never get shards.
---
Most survivors never learned how to play against freddy. Why do you think he was nerfed like week 1?
---
People still don't know how to play against freddy, but he is so bad it almost doesn't even matter.
---
a change is usually a rework
---
It's both...? 
---
Oh boy am I jealous of you
---
Im not a terrible Nurse. lol I get 4ks consistently when I play her but I'd definitely use top shelf addons to help out. I'd use her all the time but I get tired of her pretty quickly.
---
It's a meme, you dip.
---
Im on ps4 and not to be offensive, there is a lot of brainless killers on console who just camp
---
May have missed it, but is it still one use per game? With the new set up, don't see it being completely crazy to allow it to be used twice, since it's such a limited usability period. 
---
This game doesn't get better at high ranks, in fact is the complete opposite
---
No way -.- The perk is useless now... So now nerf NOED too!
---
So what will the interractions for this perk be with perks like Dying Light? If the original obsession dies, can another survivor with D-strike still become the obsession? If this is the case, could Dying Light potentially be activated multiple times in one game or would the activated Dying Light become deactivated if someone uses D-strike?
---
Probably with the new chapter that comes out in like 3-4 weeks.
---
Changing it from a get out of jail free card to an anti-tunnel perk, I like the idea (though we'll have to wait and see how it turns out in execution). I may actually run it now as a solo survivor. I'm sure I'll be much less frustrated by it as killer now, too. 
---
The fact that the person using it becomes the obsession afterwards is pretty interesting. I wonder how that will synergise with other obsession perks... Dying Light could potentially become useless, not that that's necessarily a bad thing.
---
Imagine disrespecting your mom because you refuse to adapt to a perk change.
---
Is this for real or an attempt at satire?
---
You could have written “no” and saved some time.
---
Random means there is a 1/(number of perks) chance of any given perk appearing. It doesn’t take into account past appearances- there is literally as much of a chance of this happening as of it appearing every two weeks.
---
You think roulette wheels are “due,” don’t you?
---
Discourages tunneling
---
Doesn't punish killer for winning chases
---
This is smart.
---
"After successfully using Decisive Strike, you will immediately become the obsession. This will remove the obsession from any other player, and any perks that refer to the obsession will now refer to you."
---
How does this affect Dying Light?
---
Against most killers the survivors can take a hit and run across damn well half the map in a straight line, and with anyone else alive who can tank hits they can very easily make it to the exit gates.  Unless you are a nurse or billy or something like that then your only option is to hard camp when the gates are opened, you may as well secure that final kill even if it sucks for that guy.
---
Lul are you Rank 10?
---
I can't tell if you're trolling too or just stupid
---
Man the perk is dead.
---
It's 3 seconds stun, down from 4. Enduring makes it non-existant.
---
It's weaker borrowed time now.
---
The game gets better for survivors and worse for killers at higher ranks.
---
It’s poorly done.
---
Fuck off.
---
Ok. I don't normally buy into the whole "crutch perk" thing, but DS may be a crutch perk for you.
---
It's a copypasta.
---
Especially with the new hiding spots, killers just don't know how rough it can be. 
---
I literally spent 2 full minutes looking for a totem... WITH SMALL GAME. Seriously, these new spots are making me waste half the game just to cleanse dulls. It was a massive buff to already powerful perks (ruin, noed) and they just don't realize it because they never play survivor. 
---
It's a meme.
---
Oh well I'm sorry then but it seems that you're one of the good nurses then. My apologies but there is soo many shit nurses. Such as myself 
---
Bubba main are real. We play the game, we may not have as much fun or win like the others but we are here. 
---
sweet
---
Cool now change Freddy and Legion
---
Actually looks like a really nice change for both killers and survivors
---
Too much gen rushing is what causes this. Gens should take 16 minutes each.
---
One use per player per match. So if 4 people run it, they may each use it once.
---
Imagine believing a copypasta
---
People overrate her because of pink heads+belt, thats it. She is also pretty scary when she gets close, but this is not taking into account her absolute lack of map presence because she has below average movement speed and her power doesn't grant her any kind of movement.
---
...it did get reworked
---
MaDe WiTh MeMeAtIc
---
Here's a thought: how will this interact with Dying Light, in the case that the original Obsession is dead?
---
No, players who leave while I'm downed and on my first hook, because then you don't even get to attempt. I hate when that happens.
---
this is awful lmao, what a joke.  Killers cry and get what they want.  Where is the NOED change
---
Really surprised they nerfed it this much, but I doubt this goes through as is. The easy and obvious way around it for killers is to just slug the unhooked guy and wait until the timer runs before picking him up. If there’s only a 60 second window, I think it’s clear the clock needs to stop while the survivor is in dying state, otherwise it’s completely useless.
---
Interesting that Tier 3 is now only 3 seconds. Enduring will help it feel a little bit less painful. Assuming you don't just slug the guy for a minute instead.
---
Your last statement is pretty wrong. Nurse is either top tier, or Freddy tier - purely dependent on player skill. 
---
I think (emphasis on think) that this is a good middle ground. I still think Killer players will complain about it as there aren't too many penalties to using it but it heavily discourages tunneling which is always pretty good in my book. I'm not entirely sure that this fixes anything in regards to camping because someone who gets super pissed at this game will probably just facecamp the very next game after they get hit with this once or twice in another game. Further changes to discourage camping could help with this.
---
So what perk are you hoping they focus on next? Please can it be NOED?
---
When you DS a Killer successfully, you immediately become the Obsession. All Obsession perks now refer to you.
---
Totally not useless, it's just now a great anti-tunneling perk.
---
DS now joins the group of perks that no one uses, ah well perks was clearly promlematic
---
This is a terrible change. Once again nerfing survivors to keep the reddit killers happy. 
---
This renders the perk completely useless. The whole point is to get a second chance when you decide you need it.  Not right after you get unhooked. What if you dont encounter the killer? Wasted perk I guess. The other changes are fine but having it conditionally active for a time frame is ridiculous. 
---
They just changed the spawns like a month ago to make them even harder to find fyi. I still struggle to find some of them even with small game. They should give it the aura reading again, THEN I will stop complaining about totems.
---
Punishes tunneling which survivors always complain about
---
but okay
---
you guys are never happy
---
You’re a 9-year-old aren’t you? 
---
This is actually a good change!
---
Now prepare for the storm of those that think otherwise.
---
My thoughts:
---
They change DS to a perk that now punishes you for going after the guy who got un-hooked and now you can't dribble them and I assume you can't just put them back on the hook if you're a few steps away since they can use it during the pick up. 
---
So new meta: go after the guy who got un-hooked, slug him and go after the rescuer. This might still be fucked during the end game. But this allows actual legit counter play, without being forced to use Clown with Enduring, and still benefits Killers by forcing Survivors to waste time and save the slugged guy. 
---
What confuses me is when they say that when the guy activates DS they are now the Obsession, so how does this interact with other Killer Obsession perks? Because this would make Dying Light even more garbage not unless you have a Mori. Remember Me I assume would just switch the Obsession over. 
---
It sucks that you can't dribble but I'm fairly happy with this. Big question: when is this going to happen? Do we have to wait until the next Killer is out? 
---
If not swf with voice comm Killer has a slight advantage. If swf with voice comme Killer is at disadvantage.  
---
The main issue is with a SWF 4man it's very easy to bully and absolutely abuse his mechanics, more so then any killer in the game.  If it's 2 man groups or somehow all solos (When does that ever happen anymore), then without that communication people can't just run around and abuse the shit out of him.
---
Though also he's going to be weak because he WILL get looped for eternity because he's just an M1 killer without any gimmick that helps in chases.  If you haven't noticed every single bad killer has this problem, if you don't have a tool to help reduce chases or eliminate them altogether you tend to get trash canned by good survivors, as just M1 base killer takes sooooo long to kill someone competent or just plain lucky if they have a particularly dumb house to loop you through.
---
Except Borrowed time relies on someone saving you - this one also works if you unhook yourself.
---
I mean that IS the goal every time I load in, but if you can't kill without camping you don't deserve the kill.
---
I play for fun and points, if I get the win/4k then that's even better.. 
---
If you genuinely bested me for 5 gens it doesn't make me feel any better if I get a camp kill, nor do I get any meaningful points from it
---

---
Either you get bots as teammates or a bad killer. It's extremely rare for the killer to get more than 1 kill in my games. 
---
No sir i do not. But since i wasted your precious time I will allow you to go back to your work on BHVR's rng, try to fool me all you want, i know you care so much because you are the one that designed it. /s
---
#gotthem 
---
He needs to "console" himself after a tough defea
---
You can play legion but thing is
---
1 people dc
---
2 they're shit unless you use Frank's mixtape or moonwalk
---
3 they're unfun for survivors to play against(not me personally but others yes)
---
So basically you have a killer who is unfun for both sides and makes people dc
---
Umm honestly... I like this better than the current variation. I felt kinda bad using it but now it punishes tunnelers / campers solely lol. Love it
---
"Cupboard"
---
No they didn't. It's just used for a different purpose now (punishes camping/tunneling.)
---
Clown? That's surprising
---
&gt; having it conditionally active for a time frame is ridiculous.
---
That's how MYC work and killers never complained about it. 
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If you don't get picked up, the perk remains usable. Only if you succeed or fail a skill check for it does it become disabled. So if you get hooked, unhooked, hooked and unhooked, it's still there for you if you get picked up the second time.
---
Stop, I can only get so erect
---
From what I've read, it doesn't make you the obsession until you use it. 
---
Say there are 3 other survivors on your team, and one of them is the obsession and has the Rancor effect of seeing the killer. Once you stun the killer with DS, the entity claws on the HUD transfer over to your person, and the effect of Rancor and other killer obsession perks affect you instead of the former obsession. 
---
That's how I see it, at least.
---
Right, I get that. But what about other people playing DS? Does this only apply to the first DS used? How does this work if the killer is running an obsession perk that needs to be active from the beginning of the game?
---
Honestly I'm a survivor main but I really like this Change. Now it's there to counter tunneling and would even discourage killer from tunneling. Now you won't feel like an ass for using it. 
---
oof
---
That's actually so good.
---
Only when the killer tunnels is when they get rekt by Decisive Strike. The ability only works for a limited time, so you don't have to worry about DS at the end of the game where you can't play around it anymore.
---
Pretty neat.
---
My thoughts: I think the mechanic of changing obsessions sounds very interesting. I hate obsession perks, and when playing survivor, I hate being the obsession - if someone can d-strike midway through a game and save me from Dying Light, then its fine by me.
---
So now you are forced to run deliverance or be insanely lucky on a regular basis for it to be par with BT? Not to mention the killer can literally slug you for a moment and wait till the perk is taken away. 
---
Hopefully dying light would become deactivated until the new obsession is killed. Ideally dying light will get a rework too, a perk that encourages tunnelling is not a fun perk. 
---
Its one of the best anime series I've ever seen. I hope you enjoy it. 
---
Still having to hit the skillcheck after all that is a bit much
---
&gt; So new meta: go after the guy who got un-hooked, slug him and go after the rescuer.
---
As if this wasn't commonly done already
---
Killer is still going to tunnel. They're just going to slug for 60seconds after the unhook. That or juggle them while they're beside the hook.
---
LOL he's pseudo-balanced! 
---
Iri head has drawbacks to using it. Prayer beads is an addon that's more than fair. Stop complaining about a crutch getting the nerf it needed and just ask for the next change to be NOED
---
This might be a dumb question, but could this potentially make something like Rancor be used more than once in a late game scenario? 
---
Cleanse totems. Literally so easy. Not even a skill check. 
---
This was my thought exactly. Although it doesnt solve getting downed by a camper AT the hook, it's still a neat utility perk now instead of an annoyance. And the swapping of obsessions mid game is a neat idea on top
---
Honestly, I feel like The Doctor is a good killer, but not not GREAT. 
---
So - run BT if you think it's better. Good lord, people are impossible to please. 
---
&gt; Not to mention the killer can literally slug you for a moment
---
I seriously doubt the time will count down if you're in a dying state - most of the other timer based perks are suspended if you're being slugged.
---
I was faster :(

---
&gt; I prefer the perk to has lower stun but not affected by Enduring so I don't have to bring it every game on my Wraith...
---
nah killers should have to weigh the pros and cons and decided whether they should use a perk slot or not
---
What this guy said go here. \^   
---
Didn't see a post up about this yet.
---
Seems like killer mains cried hardest on Reddit. You guys won. I’m quitting.
---
- one less survivor 
---
End of game
---
Rancor just Moro’s someone
---
Picks someone up after unhook 
---
*d-strike*
---
Moris new guy 
---
Ye-heh boi
---
&gt; It’s poorly done.
---
It's a copypasta, don't be salty because you didn't recognize it.
---
I figured that's probably what you were intending to express with that - but you have to admit, taken literally the quote sounded quite amusing ;)
---
Yeah, I got a pretty good feel for playing killer by starting with playing Doc then I moved on to various other killers
---
If you're good enough to run the killer around for over 1 minute, you probably don't need a get-out-of-chase-free card.
---
Lefty is someone who likes his privacy I can tell you that much. Like his role-play is perfect for hiding himself. I'm not surprised one would get banned for it. (Probably you could have talked to his mods about it, they might just be afraid you would keep spreading this info there). And yes Lefty does camp and tunnel if you are black listed or destroy his totem, maybe it's just a coincidence for you. Did you face him many times?
---
Decisive does not affect your chance to be a game start obsession once this implemented.
---
Thats an entire minute of waiting for the DS timer to run out. 90% of the time I see a teammate use DS they can't even extend their chase by 15 seconds, there is no way this will happen like you say simply because it would be worse than eating the DS.
---
How are you going to get better if you never go into hard games
---
Cloak mode, activated!
---
Her side smash move is a flashlight.
---
And survivors complained that the perk was OP, when really it was the only thing keeping killers alive. God thinking back to how much harder I used to have it as a killer main is mind blowing to me, how did I even get into and enjoy this game back then?
---
Trap tunneling is only going for a trapper survivor, not just finding them. I’ll hook em when I see them around.
---
I'd imagine yes. 
---
The devs say the change "is sure to create some interesting situations when combined with other obsession perks".
---
But i want to grind BP for killer while playing as survivor.
---
Bye my dude.  
---
Gen tapping is very slow so you're not a fool.
---
The main issue is that even the people who power through Ruin normally are doing it wrong as well.
---
Most people stay on the gen the entire time even after failing to hit a Great. There's a window there where you can't make ANY progress on the gen but can still get more skillchecks.
---
So you can setback progress by 5-15% in a matter of seconds if you fail to get great on all of those skillchecks with Ruin.
---
Instead you should IMMEDIATELY stand up the second you miss the great and the gen electricutes. Once the electric animation is gone, you can resume working on the gen.
---
This guarantees you don't actively work on the gen when no progress can be made and don't setback progress with more skillchecks as well.
---
It'll get your Ruin gen done faster.
---
Tl;dr - You can't make progress on the gen while that electric animation plays after a failed "Great" with Ruin, so you should stop working on the gen until the animation is over to prevent additional skillchecks that set you back even further.
---
I am planning to do that. I just want to farm bloodpoints, and then play another killer. The entity told me to do that.
---
Survivors: do something about tunneling
---
*devs do something about tunneling*
---
survivors: no not like that
---
&gt; It's 3 seconds stun, down from 4. Enduring makes it non-existant.
---
so now killers have to weight the pros and cons and decide if they want to use a perk slot to counter a one time 3 second stun
---
&gt; It's weaker borrowed time now
---
It still gets you a grasp escape foh BT doesn't
---
&gt; edit: also it punishes you for being able to run the killer around for more than a minute, at least make it pause the timer during chase.
---
Make it work like Pig's traps. Boom done
---
Except it’s not gone, the problem is still there and it even encourages slugging. 
---
While agree it doesn’t need to be equal, i just feel it needs something else, not some of this heal bs that people are posting like wtf, we have perks for that already. It’s a perk that’s supposed to help save people right? Should benefit that in someway, I say giving the unhooked survivor a haste boost just to get them out to try and deter the killer just farming them and letting you actually take the hit.  They keep comparing the BBQ and this because they’re both farm perks and one has practical use while the other just rewards good play. A small buff would be great not to make it meta but make people who run it feel they don’t have an “ empty” slot. 
---
Shaggy is a dead meme
---
Yes, I think we should punish the killer for tunneling one guy over and over instead of applying pressure on the map like someone with a brain.
---
It is weaker borrowed time, bt lets you reset the chase for one more hit. DS is now 3 seconds, with enduring its less than 1,5 seconds. You don't get to gain any meaningful distance with that. With BT you gain distance from the hit speedboost and slow the killer down for the weapon whiping animation.
---
Nice meme, thanks for the giggle.
---
Actually, one time I was playing survivor and the last gen was completed. I saw a dull totem lit up in front of me and I was like hell yeah let's cleanse this bitch! 3 seconds later Myers insta downs me and I die. I expect that my other teammates escape but nope, they all died. That Myers went from 0 kills to 4k in like a minute 
---
I always let Claudettes go, they're precious flowers uwu
---
Quentins go free too if I'm feeling nice, they just need a nap and a snack
---
Yep. I was laughing so hard that they actually found my post on reddit
---
No, Rancor would go dark after it's used to mori
---
I don't disagree with the notion that rarity shouldn't be used to balance fairness but that seems to be the carrot on the stick to keep leveling bloodwebs.
---
Does anyone know when this goes into effect? 
---
Not like this...
---
Not like this.
---
Who needs a syringe or syptic agent anyway?
---
Thank god, you probably sandbagged my ass once
---
-one non-potato survivor
---
It might reduce the sting of getting down by a camper at the hook, in that it activates during the pick up animation - so you can stun the killer, run away and have a chance of escaping, rather than being completely powerless to do anything. 
---
👍
---
No, they aren't. The before mentioned items aren't really balanced either, but the idea is that you're spending a shit ton of bloodpoints to get a one-use item, while perks are a single purchase.
---
Now, if there was an ultra rare survivor add-on that had the effect of DS instead of DS being a perk &amp; cost 7000bp every time you wanted to buy it from your blood-web, I'd be fine with that.
---
It seems as if the "word" is beginning to become bastardized, since "most viable" isn't self referential. Practical, sensible, reasonable are words synonymous with "viable"; "meta" is not. But I guess I'm squabbling over nothing, since meta is technically a prefix, and not originally a "word", so to speak.
---
I think borrowed time is better in every way but thats just me
---
Holy sweet mother of the Entity.  If these changes go through, I might actually play more Killer again, and I'll actually be able to level Laurie without feeling like a piece of human garbage. 
---
Though, the Obsession-Switching thing is definitely a curious idea.  It makes me wonder how it'll impact perks like Rancor or Dying Light, though hopefully DL gets reworked as well.  Regardless I'm just super excited.
---
happiest day of my life playing this game
---
this would be a fine change if there wasnt a timer to how long you could use it 
---
but since all this means is the killer can slug you and leave you on the ground for a minute making your perk wasted its a useless perk now 
---
i disagree, it makes the killer not tunnel you. And you can't dribble now. Also you can take 4 of those in one game if you aren't careful.
---
I think they need to clarify how this affects certain obsession perks, notably rancor (killing multiple survivors) or dying light (just how the fuck is that going to work?).
---
Unbreakable is about to become a lot more useful. 
---
You ignore the fact that it doesn't make it an anti-tunneling perk then?
---
It doesn't punish tunneling if you are any decent at the game, it's useless at that now.
---
Nope you have the 1 minute to be downed and picked back up. Personally I like the change, as the oldest excuse for D-Strike was that it was crunch for bad survivors to get an out of free grasp. This way, the killer gets the hook, and if they are downed again by a mistake they get it D-Strike. Though I think it should be automatic, instead of a skill check, this way it can' be dribbled. Since the most common thing to do now is to simply wait till the time runs out on the crawling person. 
---
Amanda IS an immersed Claudette
---
The very first tier list ive seen was on steam forum, a week after the game launched, and consisted of wraith beeing top tier, followed by trapper and hillbilly beeing last.
---
Lul, its funny to think that wraith was considered op and people cried hard for his nerf, and he was much worse than he is now
---
From crutch to anti-tunnel, good. Now NOED rework! I would also like to see BBQ have the effect of BP gain removed and instead have it passive after game bonus, same with WGLF. 
---
They've changed every other aspect of DS and how it interacts with other perks, so I'd rather ask the devs than assume anything.
---
This is a step in the next direction, something needed to change about the perk.
---
We still need to see this in practice to have a full understanding on how it works and how it will work out in some specific scenarios like end game, moris and other possible situations.
---
I am glad nonetheless.
---
YEEEEES!!    
---
And on top of that it is now an anti-tunnel perk!
---
the 3 second stun is whatever, killers should have no trouble redowning you if for some reason they tunnel that hard 
---
I like it
---
"Succeeding or failing the skill check will disable the perk". You have one more chance to hit it if you don't go second stage on your first hook. Some perks don't get their full worth in all games (balanced landing on maps with few procs, noed when all dull totems are cleansed, blood warden where you don't get a hook after the exit gates are powered, etc). It's a good trade off for the value the perks gives when you do get to utilize it fully. 
---
Indeed, just chasing the specific survivor with a trap contradicts it's purpose. You're basically playing a killer that has a shit version of the wraiths invisibility 
---
It better, rancor would be overused and people would en up with free moris
---
 What? No? Reading comprehension - "Succeeding or failing the Decisive Strike skill-check will disable the perk." You have to actually hit or miss the skill check for it to get turned off, those 60 seconds are merely the time period you have access to that skill check.
---
You don't know if the survivor is running Decisive strike so it would be a waste of time.
---
I'm not sure if I missed on the post or maybe they didn't said: when will these changes be available?
---
Nice. I actually dig this. Still a good perk, but only punishes a killer who tunnels (or helps a very unlucky survivor who instantly runs into the killer again.)
---
It's a screenshot from Big Mouth. That was a former school coach and the line he says before it is "They fired me from the school and now I'm 'Walgreens greeter Coach Steve'."
---
About 4 to 5 times , he def knows who i am , he even said it once 'oh its him' took a green mori for me. Didnt try to get unbanned tbh i just unfollowed him and moved on, i like his idea of stream but it was a no brainer to unfollow him specially because he promotes a toxic playstyle anyway 
---
Tunnelling for moris will still happen tho sadly
---
&gt;Prayer beads is an add-on that's more than fair
---
Gee it sure is fair being pulled off generators or totems with no warning whatsoever
---
When are they going to address NOED? Why do they only focus on nerfing survivor perks? 
---
Ye
---
Dying Light could also theoretically be applied multiple times as well. It's certainly interesting to think about.
---
The fact that they worry about DS, which honestly, I rarely see people use as it is when I play killer (I don't main one or the other, I play Survivor and Killer pretty evenly. Killer feels like easy mode though.) and not NOED is fuckin' nuts. Noed is like having the game play itself, lol. 
---
It used to be aura reading but shorter range. They nerfed it because it was too easy already to find totems but I think it would be a decent buff again. It could end up being useless (other than getting points of course!) or it could be super clutch. 
---
I am not sure but I feel like buffing it would be a decent nerf to NOED without changing NOED itself while also introducing another viable perk to help diversify survivor builds. 
---
I’ve personally played against him 3 times, first time I had no idea what was happening and got face camped, second time we got FUCKING SMOKED. 4K mori’d :( and third was a cake walk. Like some have said he’s easy to deal with as 4swf who loop and bully, which I think is how most killers are rated. They can all do well in rank 1. Just depends on the swf honestly. 
---
If you're able to outrun the killer for more than a minute you are very good, and your team (hopefully) will get a lot of progress done. If anything, it makes it so that when you're unhooked, if the killer finds you, they either have to slug you (which then you either get back up from healing or if they camp your body they waste a ton of time), or pick you up, letting you get to run again. It punishes the killer for going straight for the person who was unhooked, removes dribbling, and still gives you a chance to run. Originally, it was literally "the killer caught me but it doesn't count."
---
Just fuck off meg you stupid silly cunt
---
Noed has a counter, DS had the juggle abuse. 
---
Zap zap motherfucker 
---
&gt;Can’t forget add ons for Myers like one hit + Mori and one hit hachets for huntress, the list goes on with op add ons as well
---
Tombstone add-ons aren't OP if survivors know how to play. 
---
Iridescent Heads are stupid tho. 
---
Ok I don’t want to start an argument as you were right with the first part but can we agree killers have their fair share of unfair stuff?
---
&gt; I may actually run it now as a solo survivor. 
---
Wait, are you saying you only run d-strike on SWF?   
---
That's just wrong...
---
It's a fair question. As a survivor the biggest thing we've gotten in a long time was a legit counter to BBQ and chili. If we're all talking about balance here, if they're going to nerf a perk that rewards bad survivors they need to nerf a perk that rewards bad killers. Tbf, I don't use DS. I just really hate Noed. 
---
If an easy counter to a perk is "leave them alone for a whole minute" then that's you losing the game. Killer's don't have 60 seconds to waste. 3 gens can be popped in 80 seconds while the killer waits a minute to hook the downed guy.
---
Lol bullshit
---
That’s... not how enduring works.....
---
Gen tapping is always slower than just powering through the Ruin itself though
---
&gt; but since all this means is the killer can slug you and leave you on the ground for a minute making your perk wasted its a useless perk now
---
&gt; 
---
As if DS users haven't been running it with Unbreakable. 
---
&gt;I like how you list the two Killers who get fucked by The Game as the Killers who are good on The Game. As someone who plays Legion quite a bit (in b4 half a zillion downvotes) and has been learning Nurse I want to pretty much auto-DC when I see The Game.
---
I stopped reading right there, breh. If you're getting your ass handed on the Game when using Legion and Nurse then you really, really, really and truly suck. 
---
Obsession perks are all about tunneling, tunneling and camping aren't design flaws, the devs encourage them with the perks design.
---
&gt; The fact that they worry about DS, which honestly, I rarely see people use as it is when I play killer
---
Almost all games have a DS in it, usually 2. More than that is really rare tho
---
&gt; I play Survivor and Killer pretty evenly. Killer feels like easy mode though.)
---
survivor is much easier. and killer is not easy mode lmao what rank do you play at? killer goes up against 4 meta load outs
---
and if you never see DS you're at yellow ranks
---
&gt; and not NOED is fuckin' nuts. Noed is like having the game play itself, lol.
---
NOED being successful is entirely dependent on what survivors do
---
1) it can be destroyed before it activates
---
2) really, it's only reliable to get one person. killer only gets more than 1 if survivors play like potatoes 
---
Can't there only be one obsession per match?
---
You are stiupid ...
---
I didn't dislike your coment. It was someone else.
---
It's only good if the killers have op stuff c:
---
Id imagine they will have to rework dying light too. I mean the perk is another example of one that needs to change, it promotes tunneling one guy to death. They clearly are trying to disuade people from doing that
---
"all you have to do is stop healing if the killer is approaching"
---
you do know
---
1) you don't know for sure if the killer has nurse's until they find you when healing the first time. you can avoid this by just assuming they have nurse's but if they don't actually you might waste time trying to hide instead of healing in the nurse's radius
---
2) nurse's has a 28 meter reading range, which is greater than the base range of myers tier 1 ^ 2, the hag, the huntress (excluding the humming), freddy's lullaby and actual radius, spirit, and legion. and with monitor and abuse on, all killers radii are under 28 meters (not to mention pig crouch and wraith cloak make the radius 0 and both killers become harder to see). so how would you know they're approaching unless you physically see them from a range farther than nurse's reading range? they'll almost always be able to catch you out with nurse's before you know that they've seen you
---
Yes, but after the decisive strike change if you use it you become the obsession, taking it away from the original obsession. 
---
Have you seen the surv community or are you new cause every time i see a p3 Claudet squad i can assure you they are going to be toxic
---
Almost all games like six months ago have a DS in it. Hardly anyone runs it these days. 
---
I main David as a survivor. 
---
Pink flashlight don't exist either
---
I think one reason some people like them so much, myself included (Susie best girl), is because of how realistic it is. Sure, the other killers still look mostly human in appearance, but the Legion is the only one outside of Mikey boy who doesn't have something weird with their body going on. IMO it makes them scarier, in so much as DbD can be scary, simply because humans really just are that fucked up sometimes. The entity barely had to change 'em. 
---
lmao
---
whatever you say bub
---
Would've been smoother if you cut the video length in half 
---
Not really,...can still just slug the unhooked guy. Depending how long it takes to down them, you may not even have to wait very long before the timer runs out and you can freely pick them up.
---
As has been said in here, it needs to work like Pigs traps with the clock stopping.
---
Clearly
---
Play a single game with Nurse on The Game and then come back and tell me that.
---
I really like the new perk changes,  I often don't state my opinion on this sub because of the mass hate I'd probably get...  But despite that I think this just balances the perk all together the changing obsession thing is one of the only things I could see people having an issue with pertaining to this. 
---
&gt;Ok I don’t want to start an argument as you were right with the first part but can we agree killers have their fair share of unfair stuff?
---
I don't agree because your list probably contains a lot of stuff that can be easily countered or simply aren't broken from a veteran player perspective.
---
The fact that you complained about those three perks in your first comment makes me question your "list" quite a bit. 
---
Rarity isn't really an argument
---
It's basically proc "ruin game" every 2nd or 3rd bloodweb which you can stack
---
But hes super annoying and he can slow the game down a lot. Usually ppl hate to play against him.
---
I expect to get facecamped or proxy camped by Trapper. They always seem to like my booty. 
---
It's always been 3 seconds?
---
never been there so wanted the rank 1 achievement then probably won't try so hard next rest
---
Me too, pretty good choice for first dlc killer.
---
i agree. i also tried to speed it up and slow it didn’t but couldn’t figure out how
---
Broken as in what exactly?  
---
&gt; Prayer beads is an addon that's more than fair
---
This change makes DS sound like complete dogshit and a waste of a perk slot. The perk has absolutely no use unless you get tunneled off hook by the killer, and you don't know if a killer is going to tunnel until the match has already started. Not to mention there are multiple really strong killer perks (BBQ, Devour Hope, Make your Choice) that are commonly run and inherently discourage you from tunneling people off the hook. Also, there's already a perk that does the same thing that's better - Borrowed Time. So what role is this perk supposed to fill now?
---
Find survivor &gt; Survivor SB's to infinite &gt; Look for other survivor &gt; Find survivor &gt; Survivor SB's to infinite
---
Fun times.
---
Sometimes I would just play Trapper, trap an infinite and then just facecamp anyone that decided to try and run it. Which pretty much every game, especially on Asylum.
---
just put the hatchet down and hit him/her
---
Dribbling isn’t always optimal. 
---
You're making some extreme assumptions here
---
This is the best argument on the clowns side
---
after getting the perks I want and how many bloodwebs ive gone through at level 50 its definitely not worth it for me. The only people I have prestiged is huntress because I rarely used her and did her as a test and I think meg? not too sure. but i think its a waste. so many bloodpoints to get to 50 and then all your perks are gone. i dont think its worth the skins.
---
If you are good enough to keep the killer chasing for a minute after being unhooked, you could also deliberately "lose" the chase at about 50 seconds, get your DS, and restart the chase for another minute.
---
I do, yes 
---
And resilence 
---
The Doctor is annoying to play against. After all, that is literally his sole purpose.
---
Subscribe to pewdiepie 
---
Don't bother with them. Survivor main who will never be pleased and is just mad their crutch is actually game balanced
---
Pretty much 😂
---
I will at least do you the honor of urban evading into the wind
---
There was no point to play killer back then. It was just hell on earth because the survivors had all the power. 
---
I have seen the surv community. I have p3 on most characters and if I  play someone, why should I be automatically labelled as toxic? The only real "toxic" thing survivors can do is tea bag which gives them no advantage. A very small portion of the survivor community is toxic but every killer I see automatically hates any survivor they see. How the fuck does playing a character with a different aesthetic warrant being called toxic? And how do these assumptions lead to someone playing an op killer out of spite? It's pathetic really.
---
Tunneling is also bad for the killer. It’s frustrating for survivors, but horrible for killers. Maybe as long as you kill the original obsession it activates. 
---
Mate, read the perk again but slowly
---
But gas bombs don’t do any damage 
---
You can't use borrowed time in yourself tho, can you?
---
Only smooth enough
---
No it’s fighting toxic people playing the game by playing the game in a toxic manner back.
---
Call it playing fair.
---
&gt; So now you are putting in imaginary scenario
---
holy fuck all of your own arguments in this comment section have been imaginary scenarios
---
fucking goddamn lmfao
---
Because we were masochists.
---
Death is not an escape 
---
I think they will rework it, theyve said before they dont like it and it promotes the killer playing like a dick
---
the good ol days when empathy gave you blood points for altruism. memories 
---
If DS was not that great then why are you all having this huge meltdown?
---
Jokes aside, I don't really care about either of them, tho I do think Clown has better perks, one of them being my favorite, bamboozle
---
I’ve probably used it 3 matches in my 1500 hours. They could completely remove it and I wouldn’t care. I might even be happier
---
It says they're coming in next update
---
getting rank one is worth it if you havent been there before but you will soon relize why myself and other choose not to be high ranked i find it sad that i cant enjoy the game at its highest rank its so stale
---
Dude 15% speed is fucking ridiculous, you’d be like a fucking racecar! Maybe like 7% at tier 3
---
So when is NOED getting reworked then? How about they remove the speed boost to balance it. 
---
Ds never should’ve even been in the game
---
Wait I'm confused are you calling me a salty survivor or are you telling me that salty survivors are angry? I'm confused 
---
It is  sexy ain't it :)
---
After playing so much I just have nothing else to really use the BP for. Maybe for some killer addons, but other than that.. going all in  :D
---
Rest In Piss. 
---
*Well I* ***feel*** *stabby*
---
P3 Claudette.. oh boy. 
---
And, it will works wonder with unbreakable if the slugging become meta.
---
So instead of eating 2/4 DSes because I'm able to juggle the other 2 to nearby hooks, I'll be forced to either slug people to death, facecamp them to death, or eat ALL FOUR.
---
Are you sure this is a nerf?
---
did they remove it? or is it just nerfed af so nobody wants to play with it?
---
[Related.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ahnqfi/its_practically_impossible_to_get_an_8k_in/)
---
Inb4 someone complains about NOED. 
---
Yes, it is the same thing but on the killer side. Yes, here's hoping it's changed. That doesn't mean the DS change is bad simply because it came before a NOED change. 
---
Reasonable, thanks for the input! 
---
Yeah I've heard that's true. 
---
Rank one was just a target for me to aim at really. Once I'm there I'll probably just work on getting everybodys teachables then move on to playing killer I don't really know. 
---
The entity's brother, the ytitne
---
I agree he should have blurred out the names. Thought not doing that was a no no.
---
They've gotta make it through the PTB first.  I'm sure things will go smoothly, but you never know.
---
DS and NOED should be nerfed same patch I agree but DS is a larger issue. Very rarely do good killers run NOED, but everyone who has access to DS and wants to use it does.
---
DBD the destroyer of the Space bar and m1  :D
---
Are they planning a noed rework? Seems unfair to rework ds and leave noed
---
You mentioned community outrage. I'm just letting you know it's already happening lol. 
---
Same here, I rarely ever used it. I'm only sad because of the potential perk builds you could do with it 
---
Okay, but do the people making this joke over and over realize you can spend BP on any killer no matter how you earned it? I've levels survivors mostly from BP earned playing Killer even.
---
Nah, just don't get caught in the first place. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
old legacy used to literally glow in game. Looked absolutely amazing in the dark setting.
---
then they fucked it and now its ugly
---
Sure buddy and I’m pretty sure your the brick wall hereXD try playing some killer against p3 Claudet squad then you will know EnTiTlEd sUrViVoR:)
---
Guess I'll bloodlust
---
Would removing the speed boost really fix it? I doubt it. 
---
Name a more iconic duo: Leatherface (Level 35)
---
Oh, my apologies man. But I expect people will be even angrier tomorrow because more people will see it. Again, sorry for being a little shit 
---
I was literally this Meg today 😂
---
THe problem with DS is that it does not really reward a bad player. Bad player is downed in a short chase, uses DS and is downed few seconds later. DS shines the most with good players that can run away for a minute or more and then whe n you finally get them, they just press the reset button and run away for another minute or more.  
---
The trash survivors that rely on DS are shaking, lmao. I like the changes overall. Anti tunnel. 
---
Inb4 “that’s what you get for using legion xd” posts 
---
Yeah but it wasnt after outplaying or stunning you. You were just standing there. I look at a tbag in that situation as a come on what are we doing here. Also I'm pretty sure you have to blur out peoples gamertag which you didnt do. 
---
So what about people who use STBFL? Now I have to avoid different people throughout the match? I don't want to have to keep track of that.
---
That is true.  Like I responded to another comment : If I started playing DBD right now, I would probably  full prestige one survivor and one killer I liked the most.

I feel like I'm watching myself

#holy shit
---
So does this mean, if there is more then one DS in the game, the obsession related killer perks are better? So like rancor mori-ing more then one person, and play with your food/save the best for last tokens are more available.
---
I like this aspect of the change. Since it was always a pain for killers to deal with more then one DS in a game
---
It means the killer doesn't know if the survivor has ds until they use it
---
I main killer and never saw DS as something to be overly bothered by. 
---
But alright, anyone who says that DS wasn't that bad is a crutch abusing survivor main.
---
In-game they're completely jet black. It confuses me beyond belief.
---
Do killers not already slug? And you don’t have to stand over the body, the rescuer is still around if the guy is downed again immediately. Give a quick chase, if you can’t get him come back and rehook the poor sap who now can’t use his anti tunneling perk. Keep in mind also that 60 seconds is ONLY if the guy is instadowned upon getting saved, it’s the worst case scenario for them. The wait time ticks down for every second the killer spends in chase tunneling the guy. 
---
I simply don’t see any reason why it shouldn’t work like pigs traps.
---
Really love the anti tunnel mechanic. I feel like personally I’m rarely taken out after an unhook and I’m a bit afraid the perk will be difficult to pull off, but I’m glad it doesn’t appear to be as toxic anymore.
---
They won't but I'm sure they'll gladly slug and wait 45-60 seconds for it to drop off before picking someone up.
---
Whats the rework?
---
I play plenty of killer, as I have already mentioned. Do you even read my responses? I go against plenty of p3 Claudettes which I also mentioned. This is exactly what I mean. You are selectively reading my responses and cutting out all the parts where I disprove your points. This is why I'm not gonna argue. You're completely incapable of reason.
---
Good fucking riddance.
---
This is such a killer main sub Jfc 
---
Why can't we just have it be that only one person can have D-strike per match? the risk is that you could possibly lose an entire perk slot, the reward is you get to use d-strike. This fix seems overly complicated and makes the perk lose almost all its appeal. Just give one person d-strike....it's that simple
---
They are grouping you with salty survivors because you are saying that noed crutch should be nerfed because DS crutch got nerfed.
---
If they have Remember Me, they have a new person who can open the gates at normal speed again.
---
https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/editor/97/pi5xn6o68nu3.jpg
---
No.
---
Just make sure the name of the perk stays the same
---
My daily is to do coop action but fuck off
---
Well I have also had very polite p3 Claude I’ve had  lots of them many gg I must just have been toxic so they didn’t have a fun game so they didn’t give ggs
---
Wtf
---
They've changed game mechanics and perk interactions multiple times in the past, bud.
---
I mean, using enduring for DS is a bonus. Enduring is one of the best perks in the game anyway on anybody who doesn't depend on their power in a chase (so anyone with 115 movement speed).
---
You don't want to be respecting pallets anyway, and that combined with spirit fury is already meta on characters like Billy, Myers, Wraith, Bubba, Trapper.
---
Enduring isn't that rare.
---
Still you ignore what I’m saying ,noob3 WAS toxic and set an example for many other survivors to be toxic and you also ignored ochido and the many others ,so pathetic theres no use talking to a idiotic brick wall like you bud
---
It’s a start. I don’t seem them actually fixing it though. 
---
Conversely, it is also extremely painful to never be able to find ruin and have to deal with it for 5 gens, if you even lost that long. 
---
I think survivors hate the exposed more. Personally I think they should make noed give you like 8% speed, 40% decreases successful and unsuccessful attack cooldown. Maybe lower the numbers a bit but in that same concept. Basically 2 pwyf stacks, 8 stbfl tokens and unrelenting 
---
*book of facts meme*
---
It's also a problem for people who use Save the Best for Last. I don't want to have to keep one eye on the HUD all game to see the new person who I have to avoid every few minutes mid-match.
---
Time to find out who the good survivors really are now that their training wheels have been taken away
---
It’s gross now lol, time to remove it.
---
Only thing I’m iffy about it a 60 second timer but I’m looking forward to seeing it 
---
maybe play with your food and rancor will become more viable.
---
Not just that, but one that can counter things like Dying Light, Remember Me and STBFL (the last one just being avoided).
---
If he wants to leave, fine by me. Leave us to use a perk that is in the long run, more useful.
---
I know we do, but I don’t feel like they would “nerf” it that hard
---
I think it’s great, it avoids you getting tunnelled of hook.
---
Totally agree...definite increase in slugging 
---
No. But a legion player.
---
Nah you're fine. And yeah, I expected a huge influx of passive aggressive memes about it more than anything else lol
---
my biggest regret in life is not calling out for work to make the deadline for legacy. So now I'm forever stuck with only legacy 2 dwight...got to p2 level 47 before I had to leave.
---
You might think that's super close and, it is, but not as close as you think since bloodwebs were hell. That's like a little less than half a million bps, and back when point gain was even worse than it is now.
---
if the killer stands there for 60 seconds, then the killer has wasted their time
---
if the killer decides to ignore the downed guy and start a fresh new chase, then they have wasted time again - eventually, they will have to pick up the slugged guy. The missing the window of usage doesn't deactivate the perk, just means you can't use it until you next get unhooked.
---
You can still use the wiggling fingers thing to check if somebody's the obsession. It takes like a millisecond
---
Be sure to talk to your doctor if it lasts for more than 4 hours.
---
Prayer Beads, Franks Mixtape (+ Cold Dirt), Iridescent Heads... what's the counterplay to any of those other than "try to juke the killer as long as you can" which with these addons is only a few seconds if the killer is halfway decent
---
Borrowed time has unlimited uses (you can apply it as many times as you want as long as you have someone to unhook), doesn't make you an obsession, lets you have a speedboost from the hit while slowing the killer down via the whiping blood off the weapon animation. You can intentionally "mess up" and get hit to force the borrowed time to get used and continue the chase, while with DS they will slug you and deny you the chase.
---
Yeah I guess it's weaker, selfish &amp; single use borrowed time now that makes it so you'll get slugged more while the killer camps you. Great rework.
---
Honestly, for all the flak BHVR gets, I *love* that they use this method of design. It's not just important what perks players bring into a trial, but also what perks they *could* be using.
---
That layer of uncertainty perfectly suits a horror game. 
---
I don't know...this food seems to be covered in a bit too much *salt*.

---
Ya that is true I just wished if that was the case it did not need a skill check cause I can see killers just hitting then dribbling just in case but it’s a wait and see thing. 
---
I do agree though, noed needs to be changed quickly if this ds thing goes through. Imo noed is already worse than current state ds bc it can actually make bad killers 4K with ease. Ds doesn’t make a bad survivor good, it just prolongs their death for like 5 seconds
---
the gunshot at the end made me jump 
---
If somebody new becomes obsession because of DS, you will *probably* know as killer that they used DS..
---
Oh, yeah! Nice find. I still can't find any videos of it, though. Only images.
---
Maybe weird wording on my part? I'm a solo survivor since none of my friends play this game, but I don't use DS currently. The new DS seems like it'll be a really useful, strong but balanced perks for solos, which makes a pleasant change since so many perks are better in SWF.
---
I have one brown offering and it weirds me out
---
First change Instant Heal. 
---
Not really tbh I don't really care about both of these perks, I rarely use them but I just thought I'd give my opinion on it as I play both sides and both of these perks suck to come up against 
---
I actually think it helps STBFL
---
Because this is about people i dont trust.
---
⚘
---
The post says "IDENTIFYING COMMUNITY FRUSTRATIONS" however I only see benefits for, of course, the killer. Anyways, I won't complain about that but I feel like at least I should ask, if now DS will help you if you fall for a second time after someone or yourself unhooks you, then why should we bring Borrowed Time? I mean, you have to be unhooked and hit again in order to use DS and that will prevent you from being hooked again. Borrowed Time should do the exact same thing, prevent you from being hooked again after someone or yourself removed you from the hook
---
I was about to buy Laurie for DS and now I’ve got some food for thought. Time to wait for the final iteration and ensuing debate to see if that purchase (or waiting for it in the shrine) is worthwhile.
---
it's not like people put on NOED to specifically punish teabaggers at the exit gate
---
they put on NOED because they know they won't be able to hook anyone all game otherwise
---
Also if ds gets changed and noed doesn't people will be reallyyyyyyyyyyy angry lol
---
Boy i read your comment and you P3 EVERY SURV and have played with p3 Claudets thought you didn’t mention as killer so I assumed you meant as surv since you main surv so my point still stands
---
Game turns into dead memes fighting for their soul. 
---
There’s Franklin’s for that
---
Haha! Yes! Discount time!
---
You’re mind fucking this. 
---
Yeah they got rid of it and made it not needed as the perk is much worse.
---
Thats a decent enough build.
---
Much like the nurse.
---
well than take your upvote.
---
Oh, so its the same except now you just have to get hooked once first? That was already how I would’ve used it lol. Why would anyone waste it on first hook?
---
Nah dude you just set down 1 trap and chase everyone then call her a d tier killer 4head
---
No dude trust me, 4 ds on swf coms is nasty. Can literally fuck your game up soo bad as a killer 
---
Don’t tunnel and you won’t have that issue.
---
You poor thing. You got unhooked and remained on your feet for over a minute. The horror!
---
*Laughs as I camp the pallet and watch your power do nothing*
---
Honestly dude I'm really sorry I feel like a massive dick head 
---
Yeah, I agree. The new DS won't require killers to run Enduring to deal with it, but if a killer is running Enduring it'll make the new DS pretty weak. I want to have a perk that helps me escape from tunnelling and being hook farmed, but if the killer can recover too fast it'll sort of defeat the purpose.
---
This change makes this perk absolutely useless except in niche scenarios
---
If BHVR comes out and says facecamping isn't a reportable offense, there's really no point in bitching about it. Just because it's a strat that you don't agree with doesn't automatically make it wrong and it's got such an easy counterplay. Let them stand there and let the person on the hook die, rush the gens and GTFO. Yeah it sucks for the hooked player but it's better than practically handing the killer a 2-3k by being overly altruistic.
---
What they are saying is that you load in with OoO as the obsession but then someone else uses ds and takes obsession status then you get the perk nerf without you being able to do anything about it.
---
Why are you saying that I main surv? I said i prestige MOST CHARACTERS. Not all survivors. Once again, selective reading at its finest. Keep digging your grave deeper. 
---
&gt;We all encountered those survivors that refuse to get healed by their team
---
I swear to god I unhooked a claudette the other day (big mistake) and I was trying to heal her but she would not stop trying to self-care oh my GOD IT MAKES ME SO ANNOYED JUST LET ME HEAL YOU PLEEEEEAS-
---
&gt;Prayer Beads, Franks Mixtape (+ Cold Dirt), Iridescent Heads... what's the counterplay to any of those other than "try to juke the killer as long as you can" which with these addons is only a few seconds if the killer is halfway decent
---
Good job, you listed two things that I can agree to. 
---
Devs are most likely already worrying about Franks Mixtape and Legion as a whole. Prayer Beads need to be looked at as well but I don't think they are giving much attention to it yet. 
---
Iridescent Heads needs to be changed as well because insta-stuff is just unfun. With that being said, hatchets can still be dodged or at the very least, delayed as much as possible. Have you never dodged hatchets while injured? Is about the same difficulty. 
---
Statistically, killers get 2-3 kills per match. Multiple 4ks in a row isn't unusual but it is less likely, just like repeatedly rolling a 5 or 6 on a d6. It happens, but not all the time. 
---
And I could just smack anybody who used DS that wasn't the obsession again to down them. Now every time they DS me, I have to waste time leaving them and going to find someone else. This doesn't exactly uphold the spirit of being an "obsession".
---
Love the change 
---
It's gonna be like Unbreakable in my opinion. Situational but potentially game changing.
---
But even in its current iteration, if you miss the skill check the perk becomes useless. The only difference is that with this new iteration, you are no longer able to save the perk by purposefully missing the skill check. 
---
Very fucking good
---
You dont get it tho man, $2 is sooo expensive. 
---
Its clearly outside the budget range of PC/Console owners and even worse, if they buy it... who would bitch about it not being in the shrine every week? 
---
Im a big fan of these changes. It goes from a free escape card to an anti-tunnelling card. The obsession change is......interesting.Ill wait to comment when. i see it in action
---
Thank you for the kind words! 
---
When I first read the "Slightly increases the odds of receiving more Nodes of higher rarities on the Bloodweb ." I assumed it would be 
---
p0 - p1 = slightly bigger odds
---
p0 - p2 = moderately bigger odds 
---
p0 - p3  = considerable bigger odds 
---
But.. nope.
---
So you're saying that facecamping is completely fair? What about the person on the hook who doesn't even get to play the game?
---
You can prevent NOED from even triggering.
---
&gt; If they really want to go through with this change, they need to freeze the 60 second timer once the survivor gets downed. 
---
No that would be a **massive** buff to DS considering the skillcheck is going to be made easier, being the obsession doesn't matter for when you can activate it and dribbling is being removed
---
&gt; Killers will just slug the unhooked survivor for x amount of seconds and there will be no reason to ever get d-striked again
---
You can get healed up during that time or crawl away. Or both
---
I can’t Imagine thinking Huntress is top 3 instead of spirit, lmao no way in hell. 
---
Lmfao, who said anything about tunneling? 
---
‘Cause they let you get one-hooked, crouch around the map, and then take hatch. 
---
How?
---
NO! :D   I would go nuts maxing all my killers again D:
---
Some people downvote everyone and everything in this sub, so I've stopped worrying about it! That said I don't know why anyone would downvote me since I don't think I said anything too controversial; I play both sides and feel like these changes are fair. The new version of the perk addresses some complaints from both sides.
---
Yes Ik I’m a killer main, but I rarely run into 4 ds, and when I do half of them are garbage and go down instantly afterward. It doesn’t matter how bad you are as killer, if you have noed you’re gettin a few kills
---
&gt;Perk is shit now and survivors are better off running BT instead
---
BT isn't a perk you can take and get the effect yourself, you can only apply it to other people
---
STOP RELYING ON A KILLER THAT BASICALLY CAMPS FOR YOU TO GET KILLS? 
---
Tea bag a fcking huntress ? Are you smoking?
---
You can be stunned on pickup.
---
It works nothing like the old DS. You won't be able to hook them no matter how close they are to the hook.
---
If your losing 80% of your games how are you rank 2?  
---
Oh wait that’s right.  Survivors DONT have to escape to win! 
---
A lot of people die going for risky saves at the end of the game.  Doesn’t mean killers are OP. 
---
They nerfed 4 DS SWF and survivors are throwing a fit.
---
Okay, but the point is saying an obsession perk that encourages tunneling is somehow bad design misunderstands the entire concept.
---
If the obsession is eliminated or DC’s early you at least have a chance of keeping STBFL up for much longer.
---
Im lost. Technically, wasn’t it always a “defensive” strike? I dont remember a time when you could just walk up to the killer and shank them😂
---
I dont mind not being able to use DS ag the start of the match because I save it until 2nd or 3rd hook, but what is the point/benefit of becoming the obsession after you use DS? It's really the only good obsession perk there is. 
---
The Farming potential for this change is the best part. Team-mate rescues you from hook 10 meters from the killer, you get knocked down 2 seconds later, killer picks you up, you DS and scurry off as the new obsession. If the killer is using STBFL, or PWYF then they now have to avoid you to get the most benefits. If they're running DL, or RM (Rancor if the gates are powered) though, they'll keep focus on you now, which ups the risk of running the perk. Will have to see how it works out in-game first of course.
---
It literally only affects you if you tunnel a survivor. The survivor can’t use the perk unless you’re tunneling them basically.
---
I know that scooby doo did a lot of weird crossover but Michael Myers? Why?!
---
I never said it was a fair strat but its also not condemned by BHVR either. It's a stupid strat on the part of the killer (unless exit gates are open) but if they choose to do it, it's your own fault if you wind up dead instead of counterplaying.  ESPECIALLY if the survivor is running kindred and you can clearly see the killer standing there. Yeah, it sucks, but it's still the killers choice and you'll still probably wind up with more BP if you finish the gens and live rather than try to save them and die. And as someone who plays solo survivor much more often than SWF, I really do not care about sacrificing the person on the hook if it means I get to escape. If it's me on the hook I just deal with it or get sandbagged 99% of the time. Theres always the next game.
---
It’s now an anti tunnel perk, it’ll be amazing late game. 
---
Not at all game changing imo, it’ll only come into play if you’re getting camped/tunneled. I think they should just remove the 60 sec timer and reduce the stun time
---
If you run SWF, stack DS with BT, it's going to be cancer as fuck. Make no mistake, this is a massive buff. Current DS you'll get hit with maybe 2, the other 2 will likely go down close enough to hooks. With this new version, you're forced to either play inefficiently (which means 0-1K at Rank 1) or eat all 4 DSes.
---
&gt;playing with a cosmetic that grants no competitive advantage
---
you cannot deny that p3 claudettes are not invisible when crouched, you gain a major competitive advantage
---
also toxic players tend to gravitate to claudette
---
Ok. I don't want to play this card but please don't call me an idiot when every comment you post is filled with grammatical errors. Also, noob3 set a toxic example a long time ago and ochido got banned so he isn't setting any examples. If anything him being banned discourages people from following in his footsteps. I'm not ignoring what you're saying. READ MY FUCKING RESPONSES and you will see me talk about and disprove every point you make. 
---
I feel stupid myself for even indulging in this shit. Goodbye
---
Counts as a kill and gives much less BP then hook or mori.  Doesn’t give any points to emblems. 
---
You can run deerstalker to see dying survivor auras. You can play Freddy and leave them on the ground sleeping.  Or you can play doctor and make sure they are in tier 3 madness before knocking them down. 
---
Again. NO.
---
I know you want utility, but if WGLF gets buffed all thats going to happen is more hook diving and hook farming, which will lead to more hook camping. 
---
You think you want this, but you dont. Survivor BP gain should he addressed universally, not by buffing the main BP perk survivors have. 
---
If they were to buff WGLF, they should just combine it with the useless No One Left Behind. 
---
That means dropping a perk for deerstalker, makes unbreakable a more attractive for more people other than just the obsession d strike it is now, if you choose to camp a slugged body for 60 seconds is a huge waste of time. 
---
Time for the Deliverance meta!
---
I agree it could be an issue, but you also that high pitched noise when you start chase with your obsession so I would just leave them alone. But yes it would be tedious to have to check your menu every time someone uses DS. 
---
2 words
---
Think of it this way, gen tapping adds 20 seconds to the generator time. You only gen tap if you are bad at skillchecks, since even eating 3 ruin skillchecks will be faster.
---
Prayer beads give you NO WAY of knowing that spirit is coming. She just appears. Please tell me what's the counterplay to that.
---
Yeah exactly which makes it even more pointless when you combine it with the fact that you have 40-60 seconds to be able to use it and can get Moried despite having it equipped. 
---
Oh I said nothing about slugging and leaving. I envision them just standing over them for a minute or until they think it's safe.
---
You can’t dribble with the new changes, read them thoroughly. The skill check triggers during pick up animation.
---
NOED is a perk everyone should be aware of at the start the killer is running.
---
Just feedback for cleansing a dull totem. As soon as any survivor touches it, HEX: No One Escapes Death should pop up for every survivor. 
---
I do wish I prestiged back then. I just was not into DBD enough to care back then. Missed my opportunity as well.
---
They should fix the perk. Survivors who have teabagged at any point during the match suffer the exposed status effect when the last generator is fixed. Any survivor that teabags at the exit gates can be mori’d on the spot. 
---
Like I responded to another comment : If I started playing DBD right now, I would probably full prestige one survivor and one killer I liked the most.
---
I'm r/outoftheloop someone please fill me in on what changed about DS
---
With a reply that ambiguous, you're running the risk of ryan1542 editing their post to "David King is a power-bottom, and Ace and the Hag are seeing each other."
---
Not that I'm complaining, mind you. I'd love to have that canon officially confirmed by BHVR.
---
With this big giant nerf, the "if you fail the skillcheck" should be removed. It's like "wow, I did all that much and I failed, now what". It should work until you succeed, you only have 2 chances to use it, so I think it is too much...
---
It doesn't matter if I "leave them alone" because the obsession can change whenever I go get someone else. This is a huge problem for STBFL.
---
That would be very nice. I still think a totem counter would be the best, and it’s only a QoL change. Won’t hurt the gameplay at all. 
---
Can you guys fix the skating bug, the disconnects/crashing, and low frame rate next? 
---
&gt;but what is the point/benefit of becoming the obsession after you use DS
---
Can be used to get rid of Dying Light and Remember Me as benefits
---
Yes, prayer beads make it so spirit doesn't make any sound, gives you no indicator that she's using her power. She just appears.
---
Its fine cause the legion got big screwed
---
yeah and that's kinda stupid cos if a killer downs you just after you get unhooked, you won't even be able to use ds
---
The rework is a buff.
---
I think you're undervaluing being able to actually use the perk for yourself. That's HUGE imo in solo survivor play. Sure in SWF you and a pal can just run BT and that would obviously be better. But as a solo survivor, you really can't just hope someone has BT. And vs killers will a small TR or the ability to hide their TR, BT might not even proc. If I had the choice between being unhooked with BT or just having DS, I'd obviously choose BT. But you don't always have that choice, so it makes sense that DS is "weaker" since it doesn't rely as heavily on your teammates as BT does.
---
Honestly, I don't think it's proper to compare the new DS to BT at all. The only similarity they have is that they're anti-tunneling perks.
---
Also I don't see how killer's slugging for DS is a really effective counter since they don't know if you have it or not until you use it. Unless all killers are just going to start wasting their time slugging people they down within 60 seconds of being unhooked. Even if they guess right, ~60 seconds is a long time to waste for free objectives.
---
Does the clock keep running while in dying state?
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Ok should killers run the risk of loading in with 3 perks too because of what they like to run?
---
I really don't understand this whole p3 Claudette are invisible argument. I've never had any trouble with it. If I see the red, bloody thing randomly sat in a corner, I smack it. 
---
Obsession perks "Save the Best for Last," and "Play with your Food," are the opposite of tunneling perks, so running the new DS against these actually makes the killer want to avoid you, which makes your game much easier after becoming the new obsession.
---
Seems more like an end game perk now. When the killer is camping, you run up with your borrowed time. Maybe take a hit, unhook, and if he hits you then you got a chance to DS. 
---
Sad part is that it’s only active for 60 seconds so very situational.
---
I still don't know why people compare ds and noed, I use noed because of adrenaline and not ds. If adrenaline and noed were both removed then I wouldn't care about either of them.
---
Survivors like that ruin it for other survivors. I only play solo and I feel like sometimes I get a killer who just got bullied by SWF. So then their sole mission becomes to make the next match as miserable as possible for unsuspecting solo survivors. 
---
Thank you for helping me out!
---
Do you even know what the perk does? 
---
You get a token when you hit someone who *isn't* the obsession. E.G. hitting three other people.
---
Why say this? It's the complete opposite of tunneling. 
---
Once they DS if you're running STBFL you won't chase them anymore for the action speed. Actually, you won't even want to down them after they DS off because you lose 4 tokens immediately...
---
Also it's not really tunneling if I come back to the hook and you're the only person I see. This happens much more than you think. 
---
Sure judging by how this has gone I’m pretty sure you P3 every surv though i will admit I forgot you said MOST CHARACTERS but assumed you meant surv by how stupid your points have been and by how much you are defending surv as if they are ANGELS but still theres no point talking to an entitled survivor 
---
Spirit I find them harder to avoid than legion
---
*Shurg* 
---
I might buy the Halloween chapter now. Previously, the only thing I actually wanted out of it was Myers himself.
---
The stun now happens during the pick up.
---
Stop trying to use my insult against me. It doesn't work when you're the oblivious one😊
---
Exactly. Prayer beads are bullshit. You have to waste a perkslot on the offchance you get the spirit as the killer. Bleh they need to be taken out or nerfed. It's not fun getting hooked when you literally had no idea where the killer was or that they were anywhere near you.
---
The problem with it is the huntress running Iri heads almost always has 3 because of Infantry Belt. Even if you dodge all 3, they'll grab more from a locker and keep throwing them at you. At least when you're injured they need to have the skill to hit you with something at least twice to down you
---
I think the current DS is fine. Being forced to eat all 4 DSes or slug everyone to death sounds WAY more irritating to me.
---
No see, what you are supposed to do is stupidly walk to the other side of the map blind folded for 30 seconds. THEN it’s fair! 
---
Lol I was dead on hook
---
Old ds was much better at punishing tunneling.
---
Also, ghostface mask vs just random white plastic mask
---
How is a survivor camping hatch or open exit gate to secure an escape different from killer camping a survivor to secure a kill?
---
because it's not red and bloody - it's brown and black when you are in a spot with no map lightning. Although, to be fair, usually the immersed Claudettes don't wear P3, they wear the brown slacks to camo in more.
---
Unfortunately, the objects surrounding that thing is also mostly brown/black/dark shades, so you cant see shit. How often do you play killer? 
---
My interpretation of this is that whomever had Object of Obsession before you became the obsession, their perk is still active but now it affects you, as if you had a fifth perk.
---
LMAO
---
That is a good plan! I would do the same if I started playing DBD  right now. I would only prestige my favorite/main survivor and killer.
---
I don't think they have specified if it switches obsessions, we'll need to wait for confirmation from the devs.
---
I don’t think it really makes the perk pointless. Being able to stun the killer is still a pretty powerful ability. Yes, this rework does make the perk weaker, but I feel it’s a necessary change since the perk has been a topic of controversy for so long. 
---
Exactly my point lol it’s annoying
---
Legion. My ethernet cable just disconnects from my PC as soon as I see a Legion. It's really crazy =/
---
Look at the picture again
---
Same :D
---
And where was the counter play to 2+ people using DS. There wasnt any "run enduring" yes because I should totally have to run a perk in every single game I play to counter a swf group running 2+ DS and hope to God they aren't all running brand new part in their toolboxes. Addons aren't an issue perks themselves are and calling for add ons to be nerfed when they dont need to be is ridiculous. You have a counter to prayer beads it's called paying attention. You can tell where they are when grass and corn move
---
Big jiggle-physics Momma thighs. 
---
Write a letter to the devs. 
---
That's true, what I'm suggesting is certainly more impactful and potentially a bit toooooo harsh.
---
After ~700+ hours of killer I really despise NOED. I wouldn't mind it being flat removed but that's not a good change for the game and I know it. 
---
This is an indirect nerf to killer obsession perks. Before the change you could hide that you are running one because DS was in basically every game and so survivors had a much harder time knowing that you are running an obession perk. Now that DS won't create an obsession at the start of the game anymore survivors will have an easier time telling whether or not you are running obsession perks.
---
Oh well at least they made it so it makes sense
---
Don’t you see the date?
---
I dont see anything
---
You have to decide first though
---
It’s probably just me, but NOED makes that final stretch of the game so much more fun in my opinion as a survivor. Now if it activates while you’re already being chased, I see how it’s annoying, but i really don’t see it being that huge of a deal in game.
---
Enduring
---
Its actually less than that. Baby killer wants a moral victory. 3 escapes but hey NOED and camping got a sacrifice. Take that toxic survivors! 
---
I want my DLC money back.
---
I just DC when it comes to Iri head
---
Yeah, Borrowed Time and Unbreakable for the increase in slugging (if the DS clock continues to run while downed) are way more appealing. No reason to run it as it stands, I think they’ll end up changing some stuff though.
---
This change is fantastic for killers st least. Now we’ll know who has DS basically based on hooking them and be able to ignore them. Love this change. So many people complaining on the Facebook post. Games not survivor sided or anything at all 
---
That’s the same repetitive excuse y’all have for why NOED shouldn’t be fixed. It doesn’t matter. You could counter DS too but it still got nerfed to shit. 
---
oh nvm then pretty cool
---
Not using anymore :v
---
it's still better than DS in this state would be. all 4 survivors having BT is better than all 4 having DS. getting hit in BT usually deters a killer from further chasing you + the hit gives you the haste to get extra distance away if they do decide to chase you and there's literally no downside. DS means you get a 3 sec stun, they go after you again and you have the penalty of needing to hit a skill check, only a single 60 second window to activate it, and you become the obsession afterward
---
And now the survivor is pissed off because they got camped? Yeah I guess I could see that but I doubt it. 
---
"You can go play a different game then... Like civilization." -literally the devs
---
I like to think LF killed Claudette and replaced her. 
---
Where's the NOED changes? :)
---
Will they make NOED useless too?
---
&gt;After successfully using Decisive Strike, you will immediately become the obsession. This will remove the obsession from any other player, and any perks that refer to the obsession will now refer to you.
---
So you have to dedicate a perk slot to count it ? You don’t need to do that with noed. 
---
are killer mains happy yet?
---
The clock will definitely not stop, that would be a **massive** buff to DS:
---
- easier skillcheck
---
- doesn't make you the obsession until you use it so killer can't know whether or not you have it (assuming they are not running an obsession perk which is unlikely to begin with because killer obsession perks are ass)
---
- can't dodge the DS by dribbling
---
It seems like the first part will work like borrowed time where you have a limited window of time for the perk to be active. The second part seems to work like the current DS perk where the perk can only be used once. Whether you hit or miss the skill check, it’s your only chance.
---
I have read your comments lol and not once have you spoken about how survivors are toxic and also ochido is banned but people will still continue in his footsteps i assure you.
---
Also goodbye.
---
What if it was replaced by a targeted ranged aoe rather than a single target ability? That was another idea I had before I went with the one in my post. Sort of like the doctors shock treatment but a circular aoe instead. Then the traps could be placed by simply interacting with the objects in question.
---
That's some next level saving right there 
---
Yes, there can only be one Obession during the match, so the Obession will switch from OoO user to DS user
---
And it may or may not help against tunneling. We will just have to see.
---
This. This change is a huge problem for STBFL.
---
What's changing about it? I've seen it mentioned here but not what is changing
---
This. It probably won't deactivate DL or reactivate STBFL because the conditions for the perk were alredy met and the code event/trigger already ran and I doubt the game keeps checking every tick if the obssession has died or not
---
Its an anti tunnelling perk. Its active for 60 seconds after you're unhooked, and is triggered during pickup animation (killer can't juggle you)  
---
Once you use it, you become the obsession
---
Not against smart survivors.
---
He expects Billy to face camp, so obviously lmao
---
Pre game lobby exists.
---
&gt; That's also why Brutal Strength was so important. Some games you literally wouldn't have hooks.
---
I think you mean Iron Grasp here, BS breaks pallets faster
---
What did they do to it
---
Yeah you're right in that case, but don't you think that then it would be better to not change at all? I mean, with the new changes, you have to be hooked once you get down no matter what and the killer can loose a lot of time if you have that combination.
---
In the other hand, what if you are the last survivor alive and you were never hooked? Once you get downed by the killer, you have no change to escape with DS and try to reach the hatch. It's not that big buff if you really analyze it
---
Doctor always tunnels. Legion always tunnels.
---
Now there are some many perks  and it is just way waaaaaay too big of  a grind unless you really want to "100%"  the game.
---
True, but it's being nerfed so hard that it isn't broken anymore, and that's really all most people care about. 
---
Mine is also a joke, but you can’t seem to see that.
---
I once had a game with a Macmillan, Coldwin, Azarov, Game, and me Lery’s as Doc. 3 survivors dc’ed. 
---
YOU are salty
---
Oh I didn’t know about that oops
---
I remember that! I always felt like a god when I did it because the person who unhooked me was always so surprised...
---
Sure entitled survivor😜
---
Haha yeah man things are *totally* different now 
---
Yeah that would be cool, but maybe instead of a circle around him it’s a cone in front 
---
Weird build , bitter murmur ? 
---
I am new to the game and would appreciate advise but I've never seen a huntress with bitter murmur 
---
If you use BBQ and Chili you can get like over 100,000 BP in a single game 
---
It literally makes no sense to play anyone but LF when trying to get BBQ and Chili. Combined with Pudding and other idiots using Streamers and you'll have it in no time.
---
The only similar perk is we're gonna live forever which is much less consistent even if you're a good survivor. 
---
Really? Source? 
---
It's for a completely different purpose now. Instead of a get out of jail free or second chance perk it's an anti tunneling perk.
---
Most killer obsession perks aren’t great though. Also most obsessions will know what’s happening in game. 
---
iirc remember me actually punished you for killing the obsession, where you’d lose half your tokens or smth idk.
---
I hate thats its become a after-hook perk. I virtually never use these, and decisive strike was perfect for a last-surv standing or a on my own build, because LBR you can never reliably always get unhooked by your team mates... I've always been the firmest believer in more anti-killer perks so this could have been a perk all on its own (something to the tune of can't be picked up for 40/50/60 seconds after being unhooked) but not letting it be equipped with D strike. Now it's just going to be a matter of killers going after the unhook-er more, its just changed the focus / tunneling meta &amp; im not happy about it
---
I would say hag, but now that I have urban evasion it’s not so bad. I’m gonna go with nurse.. when they’re good (red ranks gets wild) 
---
it's actually still about the same speed as it is now with BS. It was 40% because the original base speed was much slower than it is now. A while back they raised the base speed, then lowered BS's values accordingly.
---
So you still break the same speed as they did before with BS, but you break faster than they did before without it.
---
Wonder what ping they had 
---
Oh, I didn't notice that. Ty.
---
Ow
---
If you miss an even bigger skillcheck for DS, I don’t think anything can help you there, buddy. 
---
Are you stupid? Enduring is NOT used a ds counter (though it's also useful for that), it's used as an anti pallets perk.
---
Enduring literally has zero cons.
---
As you should, make it as fun for them as it is for you. 
---
I hope they get changed.
---
Oof
---
The problem is, killers wont know a survivor has D-strike until they've been hit with it. No obsession until someone uses their d-strike. So unless EVERY killer slugs EVERY survivor, i doubt this will be a problem
---
I guess now all survivors are going to be running deliverance and D strike. un-hook yourself and then you have d strike to cover you for the 60 seconds while you have the broken status.  
---
Because killer mains cry to much
---
Obligatory remove legion comment 
---
Sad
---
Yeah ! you finally did it, after what ? Now finally kill of this disgusting perk and guess what the trolling toxic digusting suvivor are not gonna be happy with that and complain untill the sunrises in the fog ! 
---
DONT PANDER TO THEM DEVS, JUST DONT ! These "poeple" are to entitled and needs to finally be shut down ! 
---
You still have the uncertainty of whether or not the other survivors are using BT unless you go as 4 man SWF. BT is also less good against killers with low / no terror radius than DS
---
Man it sucks that I learned of this game so late. It seems like a whole other world compared to back then.
---
It's like that with any counterplay
---
Which side is crying on social media right now? Yeah, that's what I thought. 
---
Ah, I miss when small game showed the aura of the trap. Honestly I wish they'd bring that back because I hate spending what feels like a life time trying to pinpoint a trap's location only to find out it's just a totem but oh there was a hag trap in front of it anyways!
---
We call it poutine code tyvm 
---
I have a perk slot that rotates randomly. I could use this sometimes because a lot of killers do tunnel.
---
It will be no issue if you don't tunnel, which is great, the change rewards good players and punishes campers and tunnelers.
---
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. The effect will only proc if you down them within 60 seconds of them being hooked. If you dont wanna eat the DS then don't tunnel. Then you'll get zero DS's.
---
Yeah he is probably the beat first killer to play. He’s easy against baby r20s and starts with lvl 1 bbq with a high likelihood of getting higher levels fairly quick.
---
I strongly believe I was the Feng min 
---
I'm not sure I follow--the obsession mechanic itself was never meant to promote a single playstyle (in this case, tunneling)--it was simply a side-effect of the best obsession perks at the time. The fact that Dying Light promotes killing the obsession as quickly as possible reflects that perk's encouraged style, not the style of the entire obsession mechanic. This chain didn't say it's bad design, it's simply unfun--the flavor of the perk is good, but the execution simply isn't satisfying for some players.
---
You say this as if the killer will know who is running ds, no killer will slug like this it would waste too much time. You have to be an idiot if you think killers would actually wait 40 seconds per hook on the off chance that they have d-strike. Get real man.
---
What did they do to ds?
---
I hope they return those offerings. They were the best, also I'd be able to finally get my trapper to level 50. Since I have a bouquet in his blood web at 49
---
If they're tunnleing you they can either wait out the timer or juggle you to the hook beacuse you're already near it
---
Nooooo
---
Did you not read my original comment?
---
David’s are usually average or decent with their DH. It’s Megs, Claudettes, and sometimes Jakes that botch them.
---
God you're toxic
---
Ah, fair enough.
---
Was looking at a comment like this , I get rekt every time I go against him 
---
I really hope you are serious because someone actually quitting due to a DS change amuses me
---
It just removes the "obsession status" not obsession perks.  You do not gain any new perks by becoming the Obsession.
---
It's like always running calm spirit just in case you go against Doc and want to stop yourself from screaming.
---
I'd use iron will as an example but that perk is actually good outside of spirit.
---
what if you just slug the person until the 60-second timer for the perk runs out?
---
60 seconds is a lot of time, though. Slugging someone because they might or might not have DS means you're giving up your entire map pressure and potentially a generator or two.
---
Did you not see the clip? Thats what happens
---
Much like NOED or every other crutch killer perk.
---
Rank reset to 16-20? Sounds hard
---
There is way less salt in this thread than I expected.
---
So d-strike is basically to ensure a survivor can’t be farmed by their teammates. Am I reading that right? It’s only active for a minute after being unhooked 
---
Well ds rework doesnt allow the killer to know who has ds until its used so that isnt a balance.
---
Most of these characters are scarier tbh. Some of these eps messed me up as a lid 
---
Except that you can't see who has DS until they use it.
---
So are killers gonna slug every down for 60 seconds now on the off-chance that they might have DS?
---
I think not.
---
Fuck yeah
---
Even with more evidence pointing toward the “increased” chances not amounting to much, I think I’m still gonna prestige my first character (David). If for nothing else, just so I don’t feel like I will have wasted bp if I decide I want to prestige him or any future characters down the road.
---
And personally, I was never really turned off by the notion that the increased percentage was effectively negligible. I look at it like luck - even if you increase your luck by 100% that still only equates to an 8% chance to Kobe. Same goes for the chances of that rarer node. 
---
With a baseline % of around 2.5 for the rarest nodes from this study, I wouldn’t expect p3 to give something like a 400% increase. What I would’ve hoped for was a pretty dramatic decrease in common node % that got redistributed to rare or better nodes.
---
Killer doesn't always have the advantage. It feels like there are a lot of conditions for both sides
---
First they came for Decisive Strike, and I did not speak out—
---
     Because I was not a toxic survivor.
---
Then they came for NOED, and I did not speak out—
---
     Because I was not a toxic killer.
---
Then they came for Ochido, and I did not speak out—
---
     Because I like quality content.
---
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me, but i hid in a locker--
---
Because i was Dwight.
---
No, having 4 ds only means you will get punished for camping or tunneling, which is GREAT. Bad players will be punished, good players will be rewarded by not having to deal with ds at all. I mean, if you truly believe you have to camp or tunnel at rank 1 to get 4k, you maybe ain't as good as you think you are. Great changes all around.
---
Then it's poorly worded, because it says "any perks that refer to the obsession now refer to you". Maybe they should have said "any killer perks".
---
I wonder if a 4-stack could use this obsession-switch creatively to intentionally pull obsession off a teammate by sacrificing self at start of match?
---
Now all we need to do is nerf facecamping, tunnelling and noed and see who the good killers are when their cheap kills have been taken away.
---
GIBBYYYY!!!!!!

Probably bc of the godawful grammar and sentence fragments

---
He isn’t, but just as billy mains would play nurse if they were good at her, it takes more skill to play huntress, and there is more room for error.
---
And you can only use it for 60 seconds after getting unhooked, so if the killer doesn't tunnel, DS doesn't exist.
---
You act like Enduring is a dead perk outside of DS.  It was an excellent perk that also happened to soft counter a meta survivor perk.  Now it's an excellent perk that also happens to hard counter a survivor perk.  
---
Enduring is a good enough perk on its own that people would - and do - run it all the time regardless of DS.  3 seconds * (1 - .7) = .9 seconds, and some quantity of that is just the actual part of leaving the killer's shoulder before you can move.  I like most of these changes, but I think the stun nerf may be a step too far.  We'll see how it does once it's actually in game, but I suspect that DS will almost completely vanish within a few weeks and Enduring will become even more meta than it already is.
---
Wait. You actually think that if you get downed, hooked, unhooked, downed again, DS the first time, chased and downed and hooked again and I hooked you should get ANOTHER one? Bruh. Why don’t we add a perk that lets the game play itself for you? 
---
Reminder at Tier 3, you can only use DS 60 secs after unhooking. It’s an anti tunnel perk now. 
---
WOW! they neutered it! lol! 
---
It’s a meme.
---
"May she bless you in blood. Praise!"
---
\-TheEntityLeftHand
---
Why would NOED get reworked...? 
---
Well nurse is god awful on console 
---
Yeah but the obsession doesn't become one UNTIL you use DS. If no one is running and obsession perk no one will show up as an obsession until DS is used. That's why I think NOED still shouldn't show up until someone is hit. 
---
And killers shall rejoice
---
Would they really change NOED, considering they made it so that the exposed effect is on all the tiers a few months ago?
---
If you go down first with Deliverance you wasted a perk slot, if your totems get cleaned you wasted a perk slot, if you run plunderer's and don't get a chest you wasted a slot. It's the risk you take.
---
Honestly it's not that bad it could have been so much worse. At least you can't be dribbled as effectively. It's a little more hook proximity based now I'll just have to see how it works when it comes out. I never did you D-Strike to much anyway if I got caught it was my own fault way better perks to use.
---
Hillbilly can be in the other side of the map and still get to the hook faster than a face camping leatherface lol
---
At least it’s not a one time use unless you miss the skill check.
---
Fun fact: the stunt actor who did that drop broke his ribs. Learned that from an Official Podcast episode with Noah Munk
---
Hopefully everyone uses it from now on (Holy shit, was not expecting to say that about D strike) 
---
I see that as a decent comparison, since both of them are supposed to work against camping and tunneling. 
---
Ds is weaker at it than Bt, so I think it's weaker Bt. It also punishes you for doing well in a chase, as opposed to the old DS.
---
You think these paranoid tunnelers aren't going to start slugging everyone that they tunnel off hook in fear of possibly getting DSd?
---
And it doesn't have to be a full minute. Either way, it's also less fun for both sides, less points for both sides, less gameplay for both sides. 
---
About time. 
---
RIP, Laurie. I wonder how it works lore-wise. Do the survivors just decide not to try to defend themselves anymore, 60 seconds after getting unhooked?
---
I might, but currently I’m running two exhaustion perks and it’s rly fun (balanced and dead hard) 
---
Would you be fine with OG decisive if it were an offering instead?  Because if each survivor runs one, then it would perfectly balance out the killer using an ebony mori, as mori removes a hook state and decisive adds one.
---
Except if you bothered to read it youd know the skillcheck pops up when ur being picked up to avoid juggling 
---
Rewards bad killer play in an unsatisfying way. 
---
I like perks that help you the worse you do, but NOED is entirely too much. 
---
Not having hooks nearby has never prevented killers from dribbling so idk what you’re on about. And if totems can evaporate NOED, i don’t see why a perk like that needs to have a speed boost along with a one hit. 
---
Just like Tbagging at exit gates is a valid way to distract the killer
---
basement trapper mains be like 
---
YUM
---
Quit screwing around with the gates open and just leave already, problem solved. 
---
Off topic, but I’d kill for a Living Dead Doll of one of the original killers.
---
Can you use it after every unhook or just once. That’s the real question.
---
Personally I think it is better for survivors. It allows for them to not be tunneled, and what I interpreted was they no longer have to wiggle to 35 percent. All 4 people can run it, "strategically farm" then all 4 survivors will instantly get that skill check. I think it is great for both killer and survivor but still a very strong perk and not wasted at all. 
---
true maybe just remove the speed boost then
---
it activates after your first unhook
---
&gt;End of game
---
&gt;Rancor just Mori’s someone
---
&gt;Picks someone up after unhook 
---
&gt;d-strike
---
&gt;Moris new guy 
---
&gt;Ye-heh boi

https://imgur.com/a/P80TZvf

True. Forgot about that. I don't like running obsession perks.
---
Welcome-
---
We can't expect them to balance around suicidal morons bud
---
Yikes. Did you even read the text of my comment?
---
Wow
---
wasted perk 
---
Let the sludging doctor come out and play 
---
ALL THE GENERATORS POPPED A MINUTE INTO THE GAME, I DCED BECAUSE HELL NAW TO THAT SHIT
---
Same here! Do tell if your boyfriend uploads it.
---
I'm trying to convince all 7 of my friends to cosplay as Legion in an upcoming convention.
---
That's not true at all, the skill ceiling for survivor gameplay is higher than killer. 4 really good randos &gt; 1 really good killer. I think we're starting to get to the point where some of you feel handicapped without the Discord crutch. 
---
I thought i made it up! ;)
---
Sounds like that is only the case if the person proc ing ds is not the obsession. Pretty sure there is still and obsession picked at beginning of match to whomever applicable. So it's the same assumption it's always been to the original obsession. 
---
NOED but with 4 stacks and each offensive action removes a stack.
---
How about stop using dying light altogether? 
---
You complain about DS in its current state being frustrating for killers but you think it's fun for one survivor to get camped and then tunneled to death because a killer chose a perk that rewards him for doing that? Stop the hypocrisy. 
---
I made this originally, and I didn't realize it existed.
---
Nerf to slugging? I missed that change I think, could you say what the nerf is?
---
How can you tell if they're SWF? I play solo survivor so I'm just curious....Also what is 4k? Sorry I'm new.
---
or just have a teammate unhook you and dont waste 2 perk slots
---
Behavior does not run this subreddit. Go to their official site and submit a ticket. 
---
&gt; The reason this is a massive issue is because you spend your mori to kill the obsession and when that transfers over, you have a wasted mori. It also means you have to tunnel that obsession AGAIN and it’s just a lot of time you could be using to prevent gens.
---
Then, don't tunnel or don't use dying light? 
---
Look, I really like the ds change, play killer/survivor evenly but noed is anything but fair. It's not balanced, it's way too strong actually and causes a lot of frustration and as they explained the resoning for changing ds: 
---
&gt; we had to better understand our players’ irritations towards the perk
---
the same should be done about noed. I want to enjoy both sides, but lately I'm playing 70% killers because survivor is just not fun since they buffed noed causing everyone to use it even if it's tier 1.
---
So hopefully they are working on changing noed too, because it's as frustrating and op as ds.
---
Ok thanks. I am deleting this post now
---
No Mither Meta 4head
---
Dude game balance isn't algebra. They dont have to subtract 3 from both sides to solve for x. If something needs tweaking on survivors they don't have to also tweak something on killer side to balance it.
---
That's just a weird mis-application of the word "balance".
---
Except they aren't obsessed until they DS.
---
Ghost Chain
---
What perks?
---
I think migrating the Obsession to someone else is really weird but other than that it's fine.
---
Lol.
---
New DS changes now make frustration a gameplay mechanic.
---
"Oh, you like stabbing, you little bitch?  Guess Ill be reaming out **your** asshole instead"
---
You literally just could've looked at the picture
---
Because he’s rank 25.
---
&gt; R exploit changes when?
---
Forgive me, I haven't played in a while.  What is this?
---
&gt; Sure. Is not like one had zero counter plays and the other has many.
---
True, that's why if they nerfed a perk which had many counterplays, they for sure should also nerf the one which only has one. 
---
And again, it doesn't matter how strong a perk is, ds wasn't even the stronget survivor perk, the problem people have with it is it's frustrating and not healthy for the game, same goes with noed (which is on top of that also way too OP). And since lately survivors were nerfed patch after patch, sooner or later bhvr will need to also make some changes in their favours. And nerfing noed is a great way to do that.
---
OmG NoED OP PleAzE NErF NoED I nO Do ToTEMs
---
Because unhooking yourself never gets you tunneled.
---
If there's already an obsession, do you steal it off them? Is this gonna muck up things like Remember Me?
---
wow you could heal before the killer hit would finish it's cooldown? that's broken as fuck!
---
Otoh you can early get DL get changed from Claudette hiding somewhere in Utah to tasty shirtless David who has been hooked once already.
---
You have the same effects just standing at the exit gates, minus being toxic.
---
How does it affect stbl? Enlighten me o wise one
---
All my teammates were dead with 4 gens left and I was doing a gen while the killer was coming my way as soon as I popped a gen the hatch spawned next to me.
---
Yea but as a killer, as long as you don't tunnel anyone off a hook, you'll NEVER have to deal with it anymore even if 4 people run it.
---
So it's win/win for Survivors and Killers.
---
Keeps killers from tunneling and keeps Survivors from using DS on them if they don't tunnel.
---
fact - killers who complain about DS are just really bad at chases and cant catch summon 7 seconds after they use it and instead of whining until they got their way they should have just gotten better at the game
---
Thank you for explaining it, I understand now.
---
...no it isn't lmao
---
Using Franklin's and then seeing an instant heal in the post match screen is one of the greatest feelings.
---
glad I surprised you
---
Um....bbq and WGLF both apply an end game bonus already. 
---
Just remove the speed boost and said bad killers that got looped the whole match will still get looped the whole match.
---
"I want to rush my opponent out of the match(and complain on reddit about tunneling) but I don't want there to be any possibility for consequences or any downside to my decisions, what do!?!?"
---
What? 
---
Enduring takes up a killers perk slot so choose wisely.
---
Old DS punished tunnellers and non-tunnellers alike, which is part of the reason it was so busted and needed changing.
---
The new DS change makes it so that it basically only works/procs a new obsession if you tunnel. STBFL promotes not tunneling in the first place (to get more stacks faster), so DS pretty much doesn't exist now for STBFL users.
---
You promise?
---
This is what they work on? Forget jacked up hit boxes,  sounds, vaults, pallet stuns (getting hit at the same time)
---
 Pretty good job so far
---
The obsession change is gonna fuck a lot of shit up.
---
Rancor, remember me, dying light, play with your food. How's all that gonna work out?
---
Will killers lose tokens? Will they keep them? Will 2 people be mori-able? Will dying light transfer.
---
Too many questions, not enough answers. This isn't the rebalance we need.
---
It's a good day to be a killer
---
Oh the childish "nooooo you" ....very mature ... 
---
Did not expect that lol
---
This is actually a great change! It discourages tunneling and doesn't hurt killers that play nice!
---
How bout I uninstall this peice of turd for now.  Sick of the pandering to killers when so much is wrong with this game.  Bad lag makes Dead Hard useless and pallets not drop in time before getting your face smashed in by the killer. Or how about broken ass perks like starting a match already in the dream state with Freddy? Fuck this game Im done.
---
/r/theydidthemath
---
also, get that math out of here - people are too busy over-reacting to bring that logic nonsense into this conversation.
---
Yeah every swf plays like a tournament with 2 instaheals and 2 brand new parts. That absolutely happens very often.
---
It's been a week since I've seen an instant part.
---
Yeah if you're not good at killer and 4 of them combined are better than you then you shouldn't be killing them, no? Would it be fair if you were anywhere decent at killer and they wouldn't be able to win at all? If they play better than you then they deserve to win.
---
You're saying 4v1 like it's an unfair scenario, it's not like every survivor is anywhere close to being as strong as 1 killer. That's the point of this type of game, survivors have strength in numbers while you are strong on your own.
---
You get tons of exhaustion add ons, omegablinks, instasaw and prayer beads the higher you go on the ladder. I suggest you play more survivor and experience it on your own.
---
Does it completely prevent tunneling?  
---
no.
---
Does it discourage it?
---
yes.
---
If you don't run into the killer, you've probably escaped the trial and shouldn't complain about not having to use the perk
---
If you get knocked down and found after 61 seconds - your perk isn't wasted, it just cant be activated until the next time you get dowed. This is a major win for your team, as it means the killer has made no progess for 61 seconds.
---
LMAO that's the best one I've heard yet!
---
gotcha! awesome! I hope you have a lot of fun and get a lot of pictures taken :D
---
Good, dying light promotes bad gameplay so making it worse is a bonus to the ds nerf.
---
Who won the hatch standoff?
---
Can fix the training wheels that killers have too? Massive hitboxes, being rewarded for camping etc?
---
But I mean I only go for awesome saves if I’m running DS, I miss it more than half the time but knowing I have that chance of escape will make me turn back. 
---
I always forget I’m running DS and miss it because I wasn’t paying attention.
---
Y'all be sleepy on my sexy Deliverance, Breakdown, D-Strike, Boil Over meme build &gt;.&gt;
---
Yeah, there is no indicator for DS now. You really think those paranoid tunnelers aren't going to assume you have it and slug you to avoid the possibility of getting DSd?
---
That's the point. It prevents you fron being tunneled after getting unhooked. It's a great change.
---
You can't be dribbled anymore either and the skillcheck is much bigger so it's a near guaranteed escape if you get tunneled.
---
It's a very fair way to do the perk and by no means makes it useless. 
---
Yeah until the third-party chat programs like Discord and PartyChat get accounted for with better balancing, it's a pretty fair complaint that your opponent is using boosts. 
---
I did , I messaged the killer from the Xbox app so the killer thinks I’m messaging from the Xbox  and he hit me so I jumped in :). 
---
That's a good point, but it's kind of another free escape at the end of the game type perk too. I'm not a fan of those perks, but that's more of a personal thing. You can still get tunneled off the hook too, you'll just end up getting slugged. 
---
I don't tunnel anyway, and I like the change the more I think about it since an anti tunnel perk is actually a clever way to combat the issue. 
---
Ok, but what about Dying Light?
---
If the killer has already killed the obsession, proc'd Dying Light, and gets DS'd, does all his hard work in getting Dying Light active go to waste?
---
Honestly myers, but im a baby surv so idrk
---
Yeah, now it's good at neither. Good rework.
---
I meant the effect without these perks. So rework WGLF and remove additional effect from bbq.
---
so I can thank them? will do!
---
You don't have to make yourself sound like a condescending jackass, "bud".
---
************************************
---
Jesus christ dude
---
That's a big brain play, I play on pc so I've never thought of trying something like that but I bet I could figure out a way to do that.
---
Yes, now it's good at neither.
---
You can't avoid getting morid anymore via ds, tunnelers will slug you till they are sure you won't ds you, in most situations you won't even get to use your perk now.
---
Great rework.
---
Sometimes it's so hard to find a lobby that I can even be a nurse xD
---
&gt;What if you don’t encounter the killer? 
---
Free win, I guess. 
---
Makes me think of Striker's X-Ray in MK9
---
? Still no way to avoid it other than leaving someone on the ground lol. And no way to know if it's coming. How is it killers "fault"?
---
Tunellers will probably do.
---
&gt; tunnelers will slug you till they are sure you won't ds you
---
For a full minute? Seems fairly unlikely (and an extremely stupid choice). 
---
&gt; in most situations you won't even get to use your perk now.
---
I don't think you can say this with any confidence until we've actually seen how the perk plays out and affects the meta. Killers won't have any idea whether people are running DS or not, so maybe they'll start slugging like crazy (in which case Unbreakable will become really strong), maybe they'll get hit by it repeatedly and become less tunnel-happy, or maybe the perk will totally suck and need changing again. 
---
The more updates and characters this game gets, the more pointlessly complicated it gets.
---
Time to git gud kids.
---
Na not really every level up for a perk gives it a small boost but not big enough to be significant 
---
I mean, it is bad for remember me because if the obsession is dead, boom, a new obsession to open the door.
---
Alright now how about that NOED rework 
---
I never dodge que if i get a 4 man swf I'm playing I've hit rank 2 and have met the groups you mentioned. As well as the 4 man swf with flashlights and still have yet to have a problem. If I feel really cheeky i run noed against the swf, but i usually just run mad grit and ignore the obsession works like a charm.
---
Interesting, I've never seen a 4-person Decisive Strike group. 2 at max, but it that rarely happens. Maybe just not as much on PS4?
---
Yeah if they're running stbfl or pwyf you just bought yourself immunity
---
So it is only active for 60 seconds after getting unhooked by yourself or a teammate. 
---
So what's stopping the killer from waiting at your dying body? 
---
Why not just take borrowed time? Because right now that perk (which had already been nerfed when it was the best counter to facecamping killers) seems way better now than the new DS.
---
Right now it's like, you get unhooked, the killer is chasing, you can either loop him for 60 seconds, get downed and die, or give up after 30 seconds and hope he doesn't slug you until the timer goes out. 
---
There is no way to use this perk and even if you do use it, which will most likely be after getting farmed by a teammate, it's just going to be like a self-borrowed time sort of thing. A counter to getting farmed and it is easily overshadowed by Borrowed time's effectiveness. With a 3 second stun being the max, enduring makes this perk laughable to take. 
---
You did it killer mains, you killed DS. 
---
DS doesn't cause a surviver to be more likely to be obsession at the beginning of the game anymore but it does mean there will be an obsession in that game. Key point being the obsession is likely not the surv with DS until its been used once 
---
Ochido tried to fuck children. Jacko loved to fuck children. It all lines up with who he admires. I bet he listens to Ignition when he plays his godly PS4 nurse. 
---
Juggling is not really a counter, you’re still ending up wasting more time than if the survivor didn’t have the perk.  It’s more of a semi workaround, and the survivor could still use it on you later to waste even more time than if you hadn’t juggled.
---
Made me snort audibly
---
I don’t have much of an issue with it either but not defying is that lucky from what I’ve seen in this sub
---
- best mindgamer
---
- dcs on first down
---
He needs to pick one :P
---
Toxic manner is shit like t-bagging, hook farming, flash spamming, facecamping. All you're suggesting is that in order to fight people that play as P3 Claudette, because let's face it, it works, you also play the game, using Add-ons and offerings, nothing of what you described is toxic.
---
Was 100% worth it levelling up laurie to lvl 40 like 2 weeks ago
---
Do the totems. I know, it's tough.
---
This was literally just posted hours ago why can't you just wait a day before you steal a meme.
---
Probably Tekashi 69 or Lil Pump with his English skills.
---
Okay here's a scenario for you. I'm playing a high tier killer like Nurse, Billy or Spirit. The survivor I hooked recently is unhooked. I run back, naturally, toward the hook to see if I can disrupt their gameplan. I sadly only find the person who was already hooked, but I'm not here to make them have a good time, so naturally I want to just down them again and get it over with. Boom, I now either have to slug for a minute or get DS'd. It still ALSO doesn't solve the problem of the knowledge of DS, which was one of the biggest things factoring into its power level. Now it works much more akin to Borrowed Time for yourself
---
Name a more iconic duo: D-strike players and DCing
---
No I'm proving a point. If I'm a better killer than them being a survivor why should they get rewarded? It's the same concept for NOED why should a survivor be punished for being better. And you continue to claim add ons aren't fair. If you are shit you're going to die anyway no matter who you face 
---
This isn't that complicated. 
---
&gt;Will killers lose tokens?
---
No, now they need to chase their new obsession to get more though (or avoid them with stbfl).
---
 &gt;Will 2 people be mori-able? 
---
No, just the latest obsession.
---
&gt;Will dying light transfer
---
Only if the original obsession hasn't died yet. 
---
It's funny how many people think it's useless now just because it's not a get out of jail free perk anymore 
---
It is if it’s your last hook which you can no longer save yourself from. 
---
No luck just need to know how to play against it
---
Legend says his French is impeccable. 
---
You basically need to level up survivor with level 50 already about 127 times (implying you have all teachable perks unlocked) which is crazy.
---
wait yes you're a genius 
---
I hope they don’t do that, that takes away the only counterplay.
---
Well unless the person who's unhooking is injured or you're camping, it is a free escape. If you don't tunnel, everyone escapes. If you camp, it's toxic. I suppose NOED could solve that but that perk is lame and I don't enjoy using it. 
---
I like the compromise, trust me, we'll just have to see now how it plays out. Fingers crossed it's better for both sides! 
---
This IS the final iteration.
---
No one will run it. Which I guess was the point. Give killers everything they need. Nerf survivors. 
---
I’ve always been pissed off at decisive strike and I love this rework. It’s basically just punishment for tunneling/helping a hook farmer, which I never really did to begin with, so I’m fine with it. 
---
It's amazing for STBFL, though.
---
Even if you play well you’re not guaranteed to actually do well if you go against good players 
---
bad DL users maybe, you have to consider people who use it non stupidly
---
Wow this sucks! Thanks for ruining another perk due to whining baby killers!
---
So when's NOED getting chopped?
---
If legion is bad, why are people complaining about them if then. 
---
"this guy might stun me for 3 seconds. Better stand here for a minute." 
---
Their update doesn't say any of that though. 
---
It could be common sense answers, but this is bhvr we're talking about.
---
Or you're a Billy and that's just how you were born. 
---
I can't tell you how many post complain about campers/tunnelers, etc. I think this is a good change personally. To each their own of course no disrespect! 
---
My only guess now is that the teaser will be out Tm or it’s a licensed chapter
---
dude i remember this shit lmao i saw it in the guides tab on steam
---
It only works for 60 seconds and then you can't ever use it again if you don't use it in that timeframe. So "strategically farming" won't do anything, especially if the killer doesn't tunnel. DS doesn't exist anymore if  the killer plays their cards right.
---
Look how easy a little critical thinking gets you. But fuck thinking, assume the worst! 
---
I really like these changes and it looks very balanced from both sides of the spectrum. I feel like this will help some of the frustrations in the game on both sides. 8.2/10
---
No that means he is a troll.
---
Thanks, it’s also my Twitter, I had an original one Called anime tiddis bea but it got banned.
---
But the grind tho
---
killers shouldn't complain about this new hook rush meta the devs are pushing? sure lol, first borrowed time, now this, being on the hook is now the safest place to be in the game.
---
Damn right David King is a power btm.
---
Them doing that wastes alot of time. I do agree that this change completely kills the perk but it shouldnt have been in the game to begin with. Now we need to change NOED and make it terrible and janky just like they did to DS.
---
What happens to Dead Obsession perks, do they just stop working?
---
1. I don't lose emblems for camping because you can't camp a hatch.
---
2. 5000 escape points and I keep my item.
---
3. How the hell do you camp an exit gate?
---
In every instance of survivor "camping" you talked about, the killer can do something.. survivor can't do anything about getting camped
---
Same, when I watched the actual movie, I was not expecting it
---
I could be wrong (I usually am lol) but we may even see a drop in DS usage because it's no longer as strong as it used to be. Killers aren't going to want to use enduring just to counter a perk that wont be used as much. People are just assuming the worst case senario is going to be the standard, when it probably wont be. I \*never\* use enduring, and this isn't going to change my mind... I'm used to just eating D Strikes. (Yay, clown!)
---
I dunno, I stopped using NOED at the higher ranks because most survivors rank 5 and up just cleanse all totems by the time the game gets to the end. Most higher rank killers would probably be better served using a different perk instead of NOED.
---
I'll agree that NOED rewards shitty play, but I feel like it also punishes shitty play on the survivor's part. The survivors have all game to get rid of the totems around the map, and in my experience while using NOED, ninety percent of the time, they did.
---
Meanwhile, DS only rewarded you for losing a chase. There was no counterplay to it, save for either dribbling or slugging the obsession all game, and I don't think anyone reasonable considers either of those acceptable ways to play killer.
---
Just once, I think.
---
Damn I wasn’t expecting that. Take my upvote 
---
BuT WhAT AbOuT NOeD?
---
Let them be angry now. This is going to be a top tier perk, especially for solo survivors. I can’t wait to use it in order to climb out of rank reset. 
---
Nope
---
Isn't it..supposed to be? Like, honest here, the killer is supposed to be the one in power. They changed DS from a get out of jail free card to a situational perk that's still just as useful, just nowhere near as ez to pull off. You can still DS a killer right at the exit gate to escape, but with lower stun time and situational usage, you can't just teabag at your easy escape, you gotta run to that gate to avoid being camped. Plus, this also means killers can't dribble anymore, and makes slug perks (tenacity, unbreakable) stronger by proxy.
---
Actually coop action means action like healing someone else, rather than doing an action with another survivor, so gens don’t count.
---
 You're giving him too much credit.   He seemed like a dumb kid Ochido fan.  Trolls require a little bit of intelligence.
---
\-Couple corrections, spies in the shadows was actually functional early on in 2016. Crows could be seen cross map and the ranges weren't implemented this early on for running/walking/crouching. A very experienced killer could track survivors using the crows to great effect if they're up to date on the mechanics. An early killer streamer called Cypher was renowned for crow tracking. 
---
\-At one point in time the survivor coming off the hook could buffer their disarm trap input and save the unhooking survivor. But obviously this only worked in SWF's or high level random groups that met up in a lobby.
---
\-I do not know the specific patch but the killer's grasp escape time changed slightly. If a survivor's sprint burst was inactive and no pallets were around you could drag the survivor to the max distance, force a killer escape and very slowly drag them to a further away hook or basement.
---
\-Calm spirit had that stupid 95% chance to prevent crows from taking off instead of 100%.
---
\-You could combine Sprint Burst + Balanced for 6 seconds of increased speed every 40 seconds. 
---
\-Both windows were open by the bottom generator in asylum creating an easy infinite and atleast 8 pallets existed in the building. A survivor safe-haven.
---
Because your beginning comment was “very mature”.... seriously dude?
---
Aaah, can always tell you've had a good idea when your karma takes a 3-point hit seconds after posting lol.
---
You're doing god's work, downvoters. Def don't leave a comment, whatever you do.
---
Agreed! DL is a tunnel-y mess.
---
I know this is controversial, but I think they should be nerfed into low-tier, if only to shake up the meta. As iconic items within the game, I think they should still be viable, just not meta. Examples:
---
Decisive Strike: Instead of wiggling when in the Killer' grasp, you repeatedly make skillchecks. Evey good skillcheck progresses the wiggle meter by 15%, and every great skillcheck progresses it by 20%. 
---
This means it's not a free recovery/toxic play, but with a sabotage toolbox, it can still be used for escaping just as effectively, with the added bonus of multiple uses.
---
NOED: When the last generator is powered, up to 4 dull totems on the map are lit. Each lit totem prevents 1 random survivor, including dead survivors, from being able to open the exit gates. (Not) Being able to open the gates is represented by a debuff. Thrill of the Hunt does not affect NOED totems.
---
Obviously, this removes the killing power of NOED almost completely. However, it adds a much lengthier objective in which the killer can go through more chases and waste almost all pallets in the game. I chose for it to affect dead survivors because Hex Totems are still easy to spot, and a lot of the time it'd be another Ruin as someone watches a totem become lit. However, it might just be a waste of time if the killer a secured a kill or two already. Hex: Thrill shouldn't affect it for obvious reasons.
---
Good killers won't need to tunnel to win games, so the perk will be useless against them. You won't get to use your perk against good killers. You won't get DSd if you don't tunnel or if you slug them
---
&gt;for a full minute
---
If they tunnel you straight off hook, then yes. If the chase lasted for a while then you can cut that timer by a bit. You will apply more pressure by slugging the DS person for a minute than from getting DSd and having to chase them. It's simply more efficient. 
---
Vs competent players DS is straight up worse now, so overall the value of the perk goes down drastically. Not to mention that you can avoid the whole problem alltogether and get a mori. With the current DS you can at least make the chase longer before you get morid after first hook, now there is nothing.
---
I am glad to see that some people are hopeful about it, but I personaly don't think it will be any good.
---
But that's my point sometimes you get clapped and well sometimes you clap, the only thing that is certain is that the last survivor always knows where the hatch is. I listed situations that I struggle with in the op. There was no need for the DS change in the first place its not a real issue.
---
Yeah that’s the thing about NOED, it’s so odd and just a really crappy perk in general. It’s too niche to balance, I’d rather just have it be removed in general.
---
Dodging questions like I dodge SWF lobbies
---
My guess would be pharmacy and diversion ?
---
Getgood
---
Great point you make there. I like how everyone is saying “Well if you ran the killer for 60 seconds then the killer wasted alot of time!!”....Yeah, if he was tunneling.... like their default state of killer gameplay is tunneling off the hook that the other, correct way wasnt considered.
---
Reddit is going to cheer in joy no matter what. Lets just hope for BHVR to completely destroy NOED and see the reddit killers cry.
---
BHVR might have a lot of bugs, but their logic is usually consistent. 
---
wait what? there's a better way to play the game than rushing 5 gens, ignoring every totem? /s
---
Do SWF! Or maybe in the lobby invite to chat? Normally playing higher ranks even random lobbies are pretty good at totems! 
---
I agree that if it works like RBT and the clock stops in chase or dying state, 60 seconds can definitely be brought down some.
---
It definitely needs to stop cause how can be the perk be called a tunneling counter otherwise. So if the guy manages to last a decent amount of time or even outruns the 60 sec clock altogether, that means he wasn’t tunneled and shouldn’t get his D-strike? Doesn’t make much sense. Clock like must stop in chase. That pretty much ensures that either the unhooked guy gets away (or wasnt even tunnelled to begin with) or was tunnelled and gets to use his perk. Sounds fair to me.
---
I just immediately do a gen, as long as I have a nearby pallet/window/loop ready.
---
I dont think people realize how ridiculously fast gens would go if all 4 survivors start a gen in the beginning of the game. Obviously one person would get found, but then 3 gens would pop as long as that one person is decent in chases.
---
But then every single survivor could have an instant DS (with no warning, to boot) the next time the killer goes after them. No thanks.
---
I mean I'm glad and all about the Nerf because DS was being so Meta I almost felt shamed for not using it.
---
I'm just worried because what Perk will Killer Mains now be able to complain about 🤔 ~~oh wait all of them~~
---
&gt;stiupid
---
Well to answer your 3rd question. I dont know how it is confusing you, but by simply sitting at the gate while other survivors are out there getting hooked or chased and you could help. And the killer can possible secure more sacrifice and hook points. 
---
and rancor too basically
---
So would be interesting now to use DS with Deliverance? 
---
Uhhh....
---
&gt;Rank 3
---
&gt;Swinging at a Dead Hard
---
Umm pick one
---
Rip to mobile users.
---
The hitbox issues may be fixed with dedicated servers - so we have that to look forward too at least
---
Tunneling is the default state of killer from my experiences, sadly.
---
Yeah, lets hope for some changes to the other side.
---
They can definitely fix some things if you do not mind other things getting broken in the process =P
---
Reading is hard? 
---
So mori is now an easy way to counter ds
---
Sounds like they just made SFW even stronger.
---
Four guys with a fully powered Decisive Strike that have voice come that can't be tunneled. GG.
---
Cant answer the second question, but yes, it will steal if off of another person. 
---
If I'm tunneling someone and they use ds it's my own fault then
---
Hitboxes are perfectly fine, netcode and prediction aren't which changes the perception of Hitboxes.
---
But "favor the shooter" probably isn't going anywhere even with dedicated servers
---
I mean, when you dribble the wiggle bar goes up a lot. If you dont have a hook nearby the survivor will wiggle free. Also i never cared for the speed buff when i used the perk. I only use noed in end game builds anyway, with blood warden etc.
---
LMFAO! Thisss!!!
---
I'm fine with that, but I disagree with survivor BP gain buffs. Killers earn as much BP as they do because they're interacting with 4 survivors. BBQ &amp; Chili gets them more, because they're sacrificing a perk slot for it (which, you can say its for the aura reading, but most killers can't actually get across the map fast enough for that information to be useful).
---
I didn't read it saying you can never use it after you get unhooked the first time. I interpreted it as anytime after you are unhooked it is active for 60 seconds unless you have already used it or attempted to and missed the skill check. I am pretty sure you can save it for like your last unhook.
---
Call me Louisville because I'm a slugger now 
---
Nty
---
Not entirely true.
---
Killer's win games by stalling the game out long enough to kill the Survivors, and while Tunneling certainly helps them (via eliminating one of the players and drastically slowing it down), it's not always the most efficient way of doing things.
---
Allowing a survivor to leave to heal (or just slugging them) and then chasing after the second survivor who is full health forces three survivors off of generators, which also drastically slows the game down.
---
I feel like Slugging will become more meta now simply because you can still be DSed for picking up people who were unhooked, and that it all depends how it works for for Obsession perks. 
---
Stop
---
It would be dumb if the time didn't decrease while you're in a chase; you'd be able to get rescued, then kite the killer knowing you can't be picked up. 
---
"Gen rushing doesn't exist, it's my job, every player had fun when the match ended within 5 minutes and we all got 9000 points"
---
Somebody said the devs said it on their twitter, so yeah. One time use.
---
At least hes got good music taste
---
Because I'm a pleeb and was being lazy. Lol
---
lol, I stopped months ago because having 90% escape rate with randoms is boring as fuck, I can have more fun while playing cookie clicker
---
This actually is something fresh and new, might pikcup the game again
---
Cleaning all totems is a waste of time that the survivors have to do even if the killer doesnt have the perk. NOED staying in its current state is far worse than pre work DS staying in the game

time for the hook rush meta, DS (new and improved buffed edition!), Borrowed time (new and improved buffed edition too!), and deliverance, being on the hook is now the safest place to be in the game! wow! amazing!  
---
yes the rework is an unironic buff, change my mind.
---
Rank 1 Survivors still miss DS skill-checks and half of them can't push through Ruin, whats your point?
---
Hitboxes ok? I got video of hatchets literally going around a corner,  not to mention the pallet and window hits 
---
This fixes nothing. 
---
Every perk is useless when someone plays in a particular way. Whats your argument?
---
I dont wanna be slugged? Use unbreakable
---
I dont wanna be hit early in chases? Use sprint burst
---
I dont wanna be tunneled? use the new DS
---
If you get a team that's isn't a bunch of cowards and they work on gens. You can power through gens while the killer Chase's someone. 
---
Well they are trying to fix bugs, balance killers, get new killers, repair past bugs, ban hackers and game breakers, get new and interesting events and continue to make things freash and exciting so they have a bit to work with bud
---
This is actually really cool. It's like an anti-tunnelling perk now. Now if we see a change to Noed i'll probably start playing the game again.
---
The fact that guy thinks Enduring is solely a DS counters shows how bad he is at killer. Probably majorly respects every pallet and bloodlusts at double L walls.
---
DS is the perfect example. Killer wins chase-&gt; gets stabbed so they have to chase again. And sorry but iri heads again have a huge drawback. Yet DS had none and wont have one for another month.
---
This, so much this. They want to be able to do gens as fast as possible, but heaven forbid the killer bring something to slow that shit down.
---
When did it change ? Didnt see any patch notes
---
Ah I misunderstood.
---
&gt;This will remove the obsession from any other player, and any perks that refer to the obsession will now refer to you.
---
I take this to intend that the Dying Light criteria will reset to the survivor with the Obsession status and the perk will become inactive again. But yeah, we'll see
---
Who even uses dying light anymore ? I mean literally who ? People generally use remember me or rancor 
---
I think I read on their twitter it'll be a thing on the next PTB
---
What do you mean by kite the killer? There's nothing forcing the killer to chase the person who has the DS effect applied, and if someone is really following me around just to keep the DS effect, well, that's one person who is wasting his time, not cleansing totems or doing gens. I'm cool with that.
---
You must be SUPER lucky with bloodwebs, because I've only gotten like 5 ebony moris total across all of the killers that I've been leveling up for teachables.
---
No. I complete co-op dailies with gens.
---
But thats why you clear the totem? They want to spice things up by not having it just be an M1 game where you just sit and chill on 3 while 1 runs, it makes you do something else. Which is needed
---
Yeah I did one yesterday and im pretty sure I didnt heal anyone
---
Are you talking about me or the guy that deleted his account?
---
Fuckin hell. 
---
Dying Lighter
---
b-b-but what about NOED!?!?
---
I might unironically try that perk combo I have all of those. Guess I'll just have to wait until the next killer comes out.
---
Your objective is to escape alive, not necessarily rush generators. Sometimes, cleansing dull totems is helpful to that objective.
---
Wow. 😂😂😂😂
---
its a fucking buff, don't people see that?  
---
"so this is how **dbd** dies... with thunderous applause."
---
I'm fairly certain it'll be every unhook, making it usable twice, and making it a pretty good anti-tunnelling perk.
---
Hopefully never. It's a good idea but bad in so many ways.
---
That using rank as justification or qualification for one's game awareness is not a way to validate one's opinions/experiences as more valid than another's.
---
That'd be nice. I'd like to see NOED changed into something that I'd actually want to use as a killer (because for some reason it comes up in ALL my bloodwebs constantly), and I'd like to see it changed into something less intensely frustrating as a survivor.
---
Might be buggy, but damn do I loke the concept
---
I play swf and we cleanse all the totems but they stopped playing due to queue time.
---
And the is no chat on console ;-;
---
Not being a dick to someone who didn't notice one line of dialogue is hard?
---
You're being a douche for the sole purpose of being a douche :\
---
“HO-HO”
---
I tend to walk/run in the wrong direction towards a generator, get spotted by a killer, run around for a bunch, and get downed about five minutes later. From there, I get hooked and watch my teammates crouch about 50 meters away, huddled together, not doing anything. One will eventually get spotted and they all scatter like cockroaches. Usually, by this time, my struggle meter is depleted and I’ll float off into the sky with five generators intact. 
---
Man, I really need a new opening move...
---
Oh shit. Who mad? 
---
Asking to destroy 5 totems every match just so you feel safe because every other killer runs it at tier 1 and 2 now since the change is just time consuming and boring. Especially if you're playing solo, you don't know how many totems your team has cleansed and just have to hope they did the rest or you have to do all 5 by yourself. 
---
now its going to reward unsafe unhooks, killers cannot fight the hook swarm ever again.
---
NOED isn't fun to be on the business end of, but it allows BHVR to turn dull totems into optional objectives and slow matches down without increasing gen repair times and M1 gameplay. Every killer benefits from the existence of NOED even if they don't run it. I've always found these 'discussions' a waste of time, it doesn't matter how salty you get over NOED because it's doing exactly what they want it to do and it isn't going anywhere. It's like trying to debate with a climate change denier; what's even the point? Contrast that with Decisive Strike, which they've been trying to nerf properly for ages.
---
1 DS = 1 gen
---
4 da = 4 gens
---
now sprinkle osme Instaheals, deadhead etc. onto it and you have a free escape every game
---
Noed next 👀👀
---
Yeah I’m gonna go ahead and bet that this won’t become a meta strat.
---
Invite to a party! It's a good way to make friends and maybe educate some newer folks! 
---
Wait, they touched the stun duration? They should've left that alone...
---
Can confirm as this happened to me recently by a trapper
---
I have really big problm with looping Clown I always get too greedy
---
I feel like killers already have enough shit. Was ds not the ONE thing survivors have? As someone who has never used ds, I don't see why we're nerfing it. Sorry.  Not including items like flashlights or and thing that goes kabloowie. 
---
DS is gone. Laurie got a new teachable with the same name and same icon
---
I love this! Finally a nerf ...
---
Get to higher ranks so you don’t play with absolute spastics then? 
---
The dude who deleted his account
---
I’m not trying to be a dick but this happens all the time ha
---
Or fix a mechanic instead of having someone run a perk you made as a bandaid. 
---
No after succeeding or failing the skill check the perk will become disabled. I’m pretty sure that means only one chance
---
From the very beginning of the conversation we were talking about add ons. Then you brought up the idea of DS being an ultra rare.
---
We weren't talking about the perk from the start, don't say that we were.
---
Well I think the plan is to snipe the gen rushers
---
Notes say that it's easier.  
---
* The skill check area will be slightly larger to make it considerably more accessible to those who occasionally struggle with hitting skill checks.
---
Think of it as Most Effective Tactic Available.
---
Getting to the nearest part of the (outermost) wall as fast as possible, and if I'm already there then getting tf away from my teammates if I'm near anyone. I'm a lone wolf. 
---
What are the changes??
---
They did and didn't,  they moved the tier scaling to how long it's active instead of stun duration, so instead of 3/4/5 second stun and 40 second active timer it's 3 second stun with a 40/50/60 active timer
---
Only problem is that it’s still a one time use. So if you get unhook and you don’t go down in 60 seconds you pretty much lose a perk. I wish they would’ve gave it 2 activations instead of 1.
---
Something about the teleporting flexing Bubba makes me die
---
3 seconds isn't very long, especially with the people that run enduring. You won't even cost them more than like ten seconds. I like the changes otherwise though
---
When you're so salty you ragequit and DC from the game for good.
---
Survivors get bloodpoints and NOED can actually be disabled by the survivors.  Killers get neither of those things.
---
I would use discordance for that as it tells you WHILE they're doing the gen , butter murmur gives you aura when the gen is completed
---
"Do swf" Yeah so you can wait 40 minutes for a lobby,  JUST to get dodged. 😂 I think a totem counter is perfectly fair to ask for,  if killers can run a perk to one shot us because they cannot kill everyone before the last gens popped. Like God forbid survivors want something,  killers can only see you when you pop a gen, heal, they hook someone, and whatever else I can't think of. I play as killer,  not the greatest either and usually get a 3k with my worse killer. So yeah. There's that. Before my survior main ass gets attacked. 
---
I think encouraging slugging is a good thing.
---
That is very true
---
Ahh.. the good old days
---
But I'm shy ;-;
---
Killers' Objective: Sacrifice/Kill
---
I will go through with this objective, even at endgame.
---
&gt;Mine is also a joke, but I guess it's kinda misplaced and not as funny to others as it is to me. Oh well, can't win 'em all!
---
FTFY
---
Well DC is a pain in the ass, but Ive lost much more games cause that fucking dead hard or adrenaline than because of DC. I only hate DC when I down this fucking loser wich teabag me all the game and I can not hook him so I let him down.
---
I get that but not being the obsession makes you wiggle 45-30% ( I know my numbers are wrong) and since the hook placement is now closer there is a good chance you wont even ge th to use your DS. When I load in not the obsession, I rarely get to use my DS. If I get the option on the first hook I will take it because chances are if I dont, I wont be able to use the perk. That sucks because i like to save it for end game.
---
This is a THREAD ABOUT THE PERK REWORK, why would you think we weren't talking about the perk?
---
Yes, but you ignore my point.
---
Its a Bad Design choice to nerf something thats weak into useless
---
If you have any knowledge of solo play you know rank almost means nothing. Anything past rank 10 just shows you have time on your hands, and basic knowledge on how to play. It's so easy to pip, almost doesnt require even trying to pip to get to rank 1 for either side. And so, no, getting to a better rank won't make me not play with "spastics". Rank doesnt equal skill at all
---
Nobody said everyone tho, just the people that got recently unhooked. If you tunneled the guy off hook then don't pick him up immediately, that's not that hard to do.
---
Should be maybe next week
---
well 
---
I like this change specifically because it makes it more powerful while also applying counterplay. I think more perks should be like this because it rewards skilled players who are able to take control of the game (both survivors and killers)
---
I imagine using this perk while solo queueing in conjunction with borrowed time and possibly unbreakable would make for an incredibly powerful ultruistic build that still has a good amount of counterplay. Or more importantly. Interesting counterplay that wasn't "ignore the guy with DS"
---
Personally I'm looking forward to not chasing the obsession around until they walks close enough to a hook that I can down them.
---
I hope its comming tomorrow.
---
I think we're gonna have to agree to disagree. I don't see a problem with making perks have prerequisites or ways to play around them. The new DS won't necessarily be great against good killers with a non-cheesy playstyle, and it shouldn't be IMO. Like A Nurse's Calling isn't good against survivors who are smart enough not to heal in your terror radius. If every perk was 100% useful in every situation this game would be stupid, and I can't think of another perk that's like that. The point of perks isn't to give you a win or a straight up second chance, it's to modify your playstyle or help you deal with a part of the game you find problematic. 
---
I do agree with you on moris though, they need to change. I don't use them unless I have a daily and I hate playing against them because there's literally no counterplay. At least Devour Hope makes you earn your kill, ebony moris are just busted. 
---
It's not affiliated with DS, it doesnt HAVE to be changed 
---
It's not but the perk should still be reworked 
---
One p3 Claudet is no problem but what I’m talking about same as this post is when it’s a squad of them which most of them will be tryhard and carry DS,the crutch perks like adrenaline and sprint bursts ,purple flashlights and powerful items like insta heal.Also if i play a regular not OP killer like pig,clown,myers,and trapper without anything powerful like mori or powerful add-ons i and anyone in my position will get fucked also don’t forget the typical t-bag and ggez since most watch ochido. Basically all I’m saying is when you see something like that you got to expect the worst and fight back but just as toxic or bad as them.
---
Majority would disagree as they think DS is OP in end game
---
I mean, it’s not an issue I face often, if ever, but I just don’t think it should be in the game 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Let me guess, you’re that survivor that hides in a locker instead of looking for the hatch because you’re too immersed?
---
Interesting.  though you won’t always get to two hook everyone because the game will fly by because they’re all alive.
---
ALSO LET ME FUCKING RAGE THATS WHAT THIS THREAD IS FOR.
---
I highly believe that hatches now spawn near survivors as gens are done.
---
In theory yes but, all it takes is the killer to update their phone or load a youtube video and boom ur in the red for 25 seconds 
---
I had a huge "WTF MEG!?" moment earlier today. Going up against a Doctor, gens are done, I'm opening an exit, Feng is dead, David is on the shoulder. David gets dropped as the Doctor sees Meg, chases her and downs her. He then takes her to the hook nearest my exit, sees the open door, drops her and charges me, so I escape. Go back into spectate just in time to see the Meg wiggle off the Doctor, hit the ground and sprint bursts towards the door. Go you beautiful bitch you, you are free and clear!
---
She turns around and *tries to blind the Doctor*! He looks away and smacks her just short of the gate, picks her up and hooks her. The worst part? *David found the hatch*! If she had escaped he could've escaped too, but instead the Doctor found him while Meg took her time dying and on the hook he went.
---
Fucking Meg
---
killer main here
---
If the timer didn't decrease in a chase, than that means a killer could get the notification that some one was rescued, sprint over to the hook and only spot the freshly-rescued survivor; They don't know they have DS, so now you can let them chase you around the map secure in the fact that you can't be picked up if they catch you because the timer never decreased. And if they do know you're running Decisive Strike, are they supposed to ignore them and let them heal or something, knowing that starting a chase is pointless? 
---
The 60 second timer not decreasing during chases will cause some issues IMO.
---
Again though, don’t be fixed on the 60 second wait/slug because that’s ONLY if a person is immediately downed upon being unhooked. If a killer races back to the hook and the guy manages to last a little longer, his slug time decreases. Is he still not being tunneled? Should be able to use his perk.
---
Yes, or took away the time limit. If you earn it, you should be able to use it.
---
That's why I, as a solo player, run Small Game and cleanse every dull totem I find.
---
As a killer main, I know exactly ehat perk to complain about next: adrenaline 
---
Dick move
---
If we're being fair they came after noed first, remember before it was a hex and had no counterclaim at all. 
---
Im talking about Dying Light...Its a weak perk right now, unless you can kill the Obsession fast. And this Change to ds weakens Dying Light even more, which is a stupid Design choice
---
My bad sorry !!! 
---
Couldn't agree more then
---
I think the devs are going to break the game doing that. Not like people complain about things being broken, but like actually the game will break.
---
On your screen, on the killers screen you're still at the corner, not behind it, 80 ms is lots (usual ping for dbd) 
---
okay, np :D maybe I just wrote it a bit confusing :)
---
lmao back then there were STILL survivors mains who pushed and fought and argued that "killers are actually the op ones"   
---
heres a quote from that thread  
---
" Because Survivors have so many shit perks while Killers have so many great perks to choose from." 
---
I am 100% fine with that tbh.
---
I'm sure they're going to if for no other reason than they knew there would be too much upsetness otherwise
---
Is your idea that only people on their last hook gets exposed?
---
Where can I find these changes, do you have a link?
---
You'll still take it on pretty much all 115 ms killers to deal with pallets most of the time.
---
They just nerfed tunneling.
---
DS makes it impossible to tunnel somebody off the hook without slugging them for a full minute afterward.
---
No but you’ll play with the tryhards, therefore less chance of noed. 
---
Don’t get so worked up over it man
---
It’s going in the PTB. No guarantee it stays as written. Remember the self care change?
---
It's not a ping issue. That's just an excuse not to fix it they just keep ignoring the game breaking shit in this game and focus on unimportant shit
---
If you miss/hit it once, you can't use it again after your 2nd hook.
---
If a killer gets rewarded for camping, it's because survivors chose to reward them.
---
Man, I miss the pink colored perk icons.
---
Pretty much.
---
The role is being the garbage where it belongs.
---
I'll be slightly more likely to play with tryhards, but again, ranking up doesnt take effort, so there is no need to try hard anyway. And with that same logic, I'm also more likely to go against "try hard" killers, so more of them running noed.
---
The answer is it'll be in the next content patch lol. It'll be up on the PTB first though.
---
Honestly the change is only going to hurt more toxic players. Killers who tunnel get dstriked. Killers who dont tunnel now will never experience dstrike. Survivors who dstrike all the time are now limited. Survivors whl never use it now have a way to prevent tunneling. 
---
All around 10/10 change
---
How? If you become the obsession and you get hit with remember me you are only powering the perk. If you die while the obsession with dying light you only power the perk. I think I may be missing something.
---
Nope, I've been here from the start and you have really no idea how good you have it.
---
Also as a software engineer my self I can most definetly guarantee you that this is a latency issue.
---
And dedicated servers will (hopefully) change very little about it
---
It doesn't reward shitty play, NOED is going to activate whether survivors finished generators in five minutes, or fifteen. It gives the same bonus to bad killers as good ones, your skill level has no bearing on whether NOED activates if survivors deferred totems. 
---
NOED lets you mori people, no more Exposed.
---
There, I balanced it.
---
Can't wait to see what obsession perks are going to break or just not work with this obsession changing shit.
---
My money is on Rancor.
---
New killer/survivor coming out soon, I’d wait to see what sweet or sh*tty perks are gonna be dropped before choosing
---
If ou had seen the game was like when it launched I am shocked the game is BALANCED now. I dont get people "An OP perk got nerfed, killers bias!!!", just because they nerf a bullshit perk doesn't mean anything
---
I don't think any of that is a problem though?
---
1. If you're sprinting over to the hook, you make it sound like you're proxy camping, which is sort of exactly what this is supposed to combat.
---
2. If the dude is just sitting there healing under the hook, he's either wasting time not doing a gen, or you can just walk over to him and.... down him. So what if you can't pick him up, he's down now, go search for his rescuer.
---
3. Again, there's no reason for the killer to chase the freshly rescued survivor. He wants to follow me around and click a flashlight at me, that is fine by me. Kill your whole team while you're at it. Only thing I don't like about this is the 60 second timer, way too long.
---
And you could've always dribbled the obsession. 
---
You know that one asshole in a match that sits on the edge of the stage and doesn't do anything, only to swoop in and win once everyone else has duked it out?
---
Yeah, ya just gave them an official character
---
It looks like an interesting change, definitely will make it into an anti-farm/tunnel perk which is a cool idea.
---
I expect them to hit NOED or Ruin next, though those are really used more to counter certain kinds of gameplay, and aren't just "equip it for a free bonus" kind of thing.
---
;_;
---
Yeah, but I see many convienent spawns that it makes me question that.
---
IMO, they should make the skill check easier now that they’ve nerfed it
---
I mean it’s pretty we’ll know outside the screeching reddit community that ds isn’t an issue and only helps if the survivor is good at looping. 
---
Ahh, leatherface with BBQ, Spirit fury, Enduring, Brutal strength, Award winning chili, Carbo tuning guide and an Ebony mori.
---
dont know why you're sad, they buffed DS
---
Yeah.. I thought that was pretty clear, but I guess not. ~40 people upvoted this thread lmao
---
buffed\*
---
His post history indicates it might be.  At the very least, he’s proficient enough. 
---
Literally just watched that, lmao. “It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity!”
---
I think decisive and sprint burst have both been on there 3 times at least, and once together which I find interesting
---
that's not taking the power away, it's trying to avoid it... NOED has an actual counter. 
---
The "counters" you listed are all not a "sure thing"
---
slugging - gets healed
---
dribbling - ineffective if far from hook/body blockers
---
tanking - rarely works in current game state
---
DO totems = NO NOED
---
Spirit is easily an A tier killer. 110% recommend if you don't already have her
---
Her neutral is "flashlight spam" and her side smash is "failed skillcheck"
---
Her Final smash is t-bagging 
---
I think I played against you lol
---
lmfao you're creating situations out of thin air where you're still the victim. How pathetic 
---
I played quite a bit. I see more of ruins noed than actually killer obsession perks as a player. As a killer who like to 2 hook and BBQ chilli. Gonna love this. Hello to 4 stacks to BBQ and chilli
---
Oh, of course, just cleanse the totem! How could I have not had that revolutionary idea myself. Thank you so much! This will greatly improve my gameplay!
---
Don't say stupid stuff and you won't get sarcastic replies. 
---
I would love to find and cleanse the ruin totem every game just like killers would love for it to last the entire game. Sometimes it doesn't work out like that. 
---
I love that his bone club is his nose trunk too
---
DS is literally being removed against killers who can count to 60
---
9 seconds well spent. Laughed my ass off.
---
Then get as close as you like!*
---
you gotta go into each characters bio to see their perks and check if they got a tick in the perk box
---
You can only use decisive strike 60 seconds after being unhooked (or after performing a kobe). When you decisive strike, you become the obsession. You do the skillcheck while being picked up. Skillcheck success zone increased
---
It's a rare copy pasta, but a good one. 
---
It stops you from being tunneled until you meet a killer who can count to 61 and then down you 
---
Decisive Strike is absoloutly broken and I am still astonished that some people don't see it.
---
I'm sure this will go well
---
r/Shitpostcrusaders OP, It's your time to use the power of cross-posting!
---
1 because I want them to know what is holding the game back and what needs to be fixed and 2 because I still enjoy the game even though it is a shell of what it could be
---
Gens definitely count
---
It is useless now lol
---
Oh now we have proxy camping on top of face camping, I'll make sure to stand in the corner or just go in a straight line till I hit tue edge of the map
---
He asked for Myers not huntress goa 
---
It’s appropriate that Phiphi would be Leatherface
---
I agree, it's just the most frustratibg perk right after decisive strike to get hit with as a killer
---
Total control of a chase (windows, pallets), the ability to do objectives while killer is occupied with someone else, heartbeat and being less visible, communication (swf only), etc. In aggregate, survivors have a much greater ability to dictate how the game goes. 
---
Unless you're up against nurse.
---
Lol "proxy camping"
---
yeah, you might wanna move that d-strike now
---
They recently buffed it, why would they nerf it now?
---
The entire point of the game for survivors is to complete generators quickly. As a killer main completly understand this. If this upsets you I would suggest playing something different or playing as a survivor. 
---
so you dont care because you don't use killer obsession perks... cool?
---
I beg to differ its really not and im astonished how people think otherwise.
---
I... actually love this idea. Good job devs for actually dissecting what is problematic with Decisive Strike and coming up with a solution that solves most, if not all of those problems.
---
Next thing you know killer mains on here will cry about why NOED doesn’t lock survivors into place for 45 seconds.
---
Who doesn’t like popcorn though, I mean really, extra butter too!
---
You have no fucking clue how much effort it takes as a solo to check every single totem especially against a strong killer, do you.
---
"game balance? unacceptable"
---
Yes 4 randoms who can loop decently with good map knowledge can full escape vs anything that is not a Nurse. That is however pretty rare even at rank 1 in my solo survivor experience. I'd say more that around 60% of the games are either 4k or 3k + hatch.
---
What about if slugging the survivor pauses the timer 
---
Evee heard of Obsession perks? No? read my other Comments on this topic.
---
Time to get good, sorry!
---
THE WHOLE CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT THE ADD ONS BEFORE YOU CAME BACK TO DS, maybe that's why?
---
I like the time limit, it's an anti camp-tunnel perk now
---
Um, as a DS main DS has been useless since killers suddenly have 15ft arms, so after this BS change to not make DS continuously useless, can we Fucking Fix the 15ft reach of killers?!
---
Well hurrah for me. As someone who like 2 hooking and BBQ and chilli. Getting 4 stack will get slightly easier. As a killer I rarely run obsession based perks so feelsbad for people who run dying light?  Time for NOED change next?  
---
I have videos of people running over my traps and not getting stuck and videos off hatchets flying through people's bodies and doing jack shit
---
and pallet and window hits are intended 
---
Try using Hex: Ruin to slow the game down... just a lil bit.
---
i like the change to ds, but it really fucks up a lot of other perks. dying light can be useless if someone uses ds right after the first obession dies. object of obsession is a wasted perk slot after someone else uses ds. meh, without changes to those perks i think its a bit silly.
---
The Survivor's shouldn't feel safe until the trial is over. They should never be cocky enough to rub their ass in The Killer's face at the exit, and if they do get that cocky the deserve the insta-down. And either way, most of the time the hex is destroyed almost immediately after the last gen is done, or all the dull totems have been destroyed and it can't even be used. And well I do believe balancing is crucial, The Killer should always be a step ahead of The Survivor's.
---
Last night played a match as spirit 3 dead last one heading to hatch phases walked over there grabbed them within an inch of time luckiest grab of my life haha we had a good laugh as I scared the shit out of him he said
---
Reducing stun to what? 2 seconds? Enduring will make killer's recover from it faster than them just wiggling free. First thing would be to make the stun unaffected by Enduring IF they actually want to punish campers.The time limit could use work, maybe if you enter a chase the time freezes or becomes slowed until you lose them,if you get downed while you have time you can use it next time you get picked up without worrying about the killer waiting out the time.
---
It's getting changed into pretty much an anti-tunneling perk. When you get unhooked, the perk activates for 40/50/60 seconds. When picked up by the killer (skillcheck is bigger and happens during the animation now) succeed a skillcheck to escape the killer's grasp and stun them for 3 seconds. Upon succeeding or failing the Skill Check, the perk deactivates.  
---
Basically, it went from one of the best perks into the game, to a quite situational perk. It'll still be good for endgame saves, sure, but it'll lose a lot of what made it so strong.
---
Quentin, Pharmacy and the fucking pebble. I see you’re a cultured man too.
---
When you go against a p3 Claudet swf you will see. Just saying this out of experience also bring mori:)
---
May i ask what's with the Day X titles?
---
You mean rancor? Because that’s the only one that gets used
---
The drawback of Iri head doesn't make up for the benefit in the slightest, you can down 3 team members without reloading, you can end a chase with one hatchet.
---
Killer wins chase -&gt; killer has a brain and dribbles/slugs for more pressure. You can play around it, you're just assuming that you have to eat the DS every time.
---
I have been posting a new meme reformat every day for the past 13 days. :D
---
Okay let me give you my reasons why it's a broken perk:
---
1. No counterplay. Decisive Strike is a get out of jail for free card. There is nothing besides dribbling that a killer can do to counter it (and even then other survivors can bodyblock for the obsession).
---
2. It stuns the killer for 4 seconds at Tier 3 and that is more than enough time to get to another pallet spot and loop the killer for several more minutes.
---
3. Multiple Decisive Strikes are unexpected and can waste an incredible amount of time for a killer.
---
Just because you see Obsessions that use DS and then get downed a few seconds afterwards doesn't mean that all players do so. There are people playing with decisive strike who are generally super hard to catch and they basically get a free second chance with zero to no effort.
---
It goes into Deviousness, so letting a survivor bleed out will take away at least 700 points from your sacrifice category.
---
I think there’s more issues though with it left as is, such as cases where you were in fact tunneled, but don’t even get to use it because maybe your chase went a decent time or the killer chose to just slug.
---
If it stops in chase, the 60 should definitely be brought down. If the guy just sits there self caring, whack him and take the d-strike. You spent no time actually chasing him, only the time to return to the hook. It would be silly for the survivor to do that I think.
---
Imagine being mad because the survivors best the match too fast. Lolol
---
But cleansing totems is just good gameplay.
---
Dribbling/Slugging the obsession was toxic behavior but felt necessary because of how irritating DS was for killers. 
---
Can you not see the difference between the two counterplays for these perks?
---
"DS CHANGE HAPPENED, HOW ABOUT NOED CHANGES?
---
We aren't planning to change NOED at the moment. We consider that NOED has multiple gameplay counters and is currently in a good place. We do not think of NOED as an equivalent to DS."
---
You arent entirely wrong 
---
3 seconds plus the animation delays before and after.
---
The DS we have now is a 7 or 6.5 second stun at rank 3 from what I heard last time they talked about it. It says 4 seconds, but it's longer for sure because of the animation delay/cooldown. 
---
I used to do this when I suspected the killer has BBQ
---
&gt; Someone gets hooked
---
&gt; Me in locker counting to 5
---
&gt; Step out of locker
---
&gt; Killer chainsaws over, thinking they have an easy catch
---
&gt; I stand to the side behind a rock
---
heheh boy
---
That really doesn't seem to be relevant to the discussion at hand. 
---
I agree - plus, the devs literally say it themselves in the post. 
---
"We aren't planning to change NOED at the moment. We consider that NOED has multiple gameplay counters and is currently in a good place. &lt;B&gt;We do not think of NOED as an equivalent to DS&lt;/B&gt;."
---
*I did not know--*
---
*Because i didnt play back then. But if you downvoted me because of that,* 
---
*i'd decisive strike your ass*
---
i kinda feel like more people will start to use d-strike now 🤔
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
# ALL OF THE ABOVE.
---
***Bow down peasants*** 
---
This^ thank you!!!
---
Cant we just appreciate that they at least did that instead of adding cosmetics? 
---
I'm waiting for the suggestions flair to be changed to shitpost.
---
Any minute now
---
When they changed it, you were getting ALL of the common perks, then ALL of the uncommon, up to ultra rares. It sucked even more cuz you couldn't get any perk of higher rarity untill you got every single one of the previous rarity.
---
Although, thanks to this change, we could see very original, budget perk builds on players who just prestiged or who leveled new characters. 
---
The game was dying for a good while because people playing killer were dropping off like flies due to how shit it is to play killer
---
&gt; Sprint burst, nerf.
---
Are you referring to the exhaustion changes? That was needed game balance. It's absurd that survivors can just get bursts of speed every 40 seconds
---
&gt; Self care, nerf
---
It was a change in the meta because generators go too quickly at high ranks. Something had to be done to slow the game down without just making generators absurdly long so instead they changed the meta to encourage team play and the use of other perks that also provided something else for survivors to do
---
When the game is 4 vs 1, the 1 is going to need more on their side like that
---
&gt; BNP nerf
---
Taking away insta gens what an unfair tragedy
---
&gt; DS nerf.
---
yeah because it's totally fine in a 4 v 1 game to have a direct punishment to the 1 for winning an objective
---
&gt; Trapper, buff. Hag, buff.
---
These were both sorely needed. And Trapper still has absurd issues.
---
&gt; Noed buff.
---
You're not going to agree with this, but making tier 1 and tier 2 viable is not a buff to the perk itself. And perk tiers are ridiculous and should be done away with in general
---
&gt; have so many aura reading perks. 
---
...So do survivors. And counters to killer aura reading. Are you serious right now?
---
&gt; Mori
---
Ebony moris are awful, I'll give you that. Green and yellow are still fine.
---
&gt; devour hope,
---
This is a perk that can be destroyed by survivors and requires the killer to complete their objective and not camp. It's one of the most situational killer perks there is and takes forever to become useful.
---
&gt; ruin
---
Again, survivors can destroy this. It's also not hard to work through ruin and it's necessary against high rank survivors 
---
&gt; blood warden, remember me,
---
Situational end game perks that don't do that much. 
---
&gt; dying light,
---
Cancer that needs to be re-worked, you're right
---
&gt; Insta hatchets, insta chainsaws.
---
chainsaws are fine. hatchets would be fine if the add-ons that increased number of hatchets didn't work with iridescent heads
---
&gt; Survivors now have maybe 6 or 7 viable perks
---
The best killer perks are probably better than the best survivor perks, but survivors have more perks that are generally viable than killers. Don't be silly.
---
And, again, this is a 4 v 1 game. The team with 4 people has a lot of room for mistakes that the killer does not have, so the side that has only one person should be a bit stronger on an individual level.
---
And to end, you can't just list changes and say "nerf/buff" as if tha makes a point. You have to examine the changes from a mechanics/meta perspective, i.e. why did they make this change? what does it accomplish for game play?
---
This is my favorite shit post on this reddit thus far. Got a good laugh out of it.
---
expect the number of people dc'ing when noticing a mori to increase 
---
HAHAHAHHA
---
WHOA!!!!! Has this ever happened to anyone else?
---
I think so.
---
underrated post
---
I main hag so discordance and surveillance are not the best choice. Ill try ruin now with sloppy butcher. With my second main spirit I try ruin with sirveillance now and its going better, but idk if discordance is better than bbq
---
My bad I forgot to add this is for console where it’s not 60fps. But I can see why it’s not used often on pc because skill checks are much easier.
---
Not sure which part I replied puts me in the position that I do not care. It's just I would prefer to see the bright side of it. If one day they decide to Nerf BBQ and chilli and buff killers' obsession perks. I will go hurrah and try something it out. I feels like the game has enough criticism to warrant me not putting mine in. If that offended you I apologise.
---
Nice downvoting instead of trying to think of an actual reply btw :D
---
It was bugged for awhile where only healing co-op would count but they fixed it
---
that shits going to be confusing as fuck what you mean
---
It's not very good at high ranks though,imo because most survivors can hit those skill checks with no problem
---
i seriously doubt you got facecamped 8 times in a *row* but get a swf on any streamers discord and get them to run borrowed rhymes
---
They answered that. There is a FAQ on it below the article..
---
If, at some point in the trial, another player becomes the Obsession, Dying Lights de-buff will be removed as the Obsession is considered alive again.
---
I still have new moon offerings. Hello when can I sell these useless things for BP.
---
Cause it’ll turn in to slugging anyone suspected of having DS for at least a minute if they have previously been hooked. This “ anti tunnelling “ fix just promotes slugging instead. it’s not like the killer is just going to not tunnel someone in to dying state after they got unhooked.
---
stbfl doesnt promote anti tunnel, it just promotes ignoring one person, you can totally still tunnel, in fact I only see this causing tunneling if the obsession goes for a rescue
---
Sorry? You expect some secret? There’s an answer to the issue if you don’t want to look- because it’s not impossible.... that’s on you? Someone posted that the game hasn’t received much change and that stagnation makes people get salty over the slightest things.. and it’s like uh if you don’t want to do the thing that counters the other players play. Don’t play competitive games? 
---
Like run small game, learn totem spots, and check for ruin. If more people tried that instead of Gen jockeying it wouldn’t be that much of a problem.
---
Can't really make cheeky obsession change plays if the killer doesn't tunnel. I love how the killer has the choice to potentially run face first into this perk or not. If the killer doesn't tunnel, DS is a wasted perk slot.
---
they mention the interaction in the link
---
*Dying Light*
---
* The active Obsession has the altruistic action speed bonus while they are alive.
---
* If the active Obsession is killed, Dying Light's de-buff is applied to all remaining survivors.
---
* If, at some point in the trial, another player becomes the  Obsession, Dying Lights de-buff will be removed as the Obsession is  considered alive again.
---
I'm talking about people who have like 400+ hours minimum working their way to P3 killers and getting all perks
---
Additionally, with dribbling being removed DS has literally zero counter plays now. 
---
They said on Twitter u can only use it once
---
i have no idea what this run on sentence is saying. whats the new change? 
---
I guess, just another thing to add to the big fucking list of everything a killer needs to constantly pay attention to in a match
---
Spending an entire minute not appreciably pressuring survivors in exchange for a possible (if they don't get picked up by a teammate) hook on someone who was already injured sounds like an objectively bad play by the killer in nearly every situation where there aren't fewer than 4 total survivors. If the killer is that committed to tunneling this person, this slug play that you keep bringing up means that there's another full minute that the killer has to spend before they successfully tunnel this survivor out of the game. That's an extremely high cost to the killer. A full minute is a really long time to be doing nothing, unless the killer is already at a heavy advantage such that he can afford to give up that time. If the killer is far enough ahead for camping the slug to be viable, I think at that point they have earned the right to trade their time for a guaranteed hook.
---
This is not correct.
---
Was there actually a mike myers special for scooby doo?
---
Will Iron Grasp get a buff to help against the new Decisive Strike? I feel like that would work logically considering you would have a stronger grasp on the Survivor, thus making it harder for them to escape.
---
"The concept of changing the obsession while a match is in progress is something completely new to Dead by Daylight and is sure to create some interesting situations" 
---
Yeah, I'm sure is. Especially for us console plebs. Sure hope that optimization pass comes before this!
---
As someone who didn't ever use DS in the first place, id actually consider using it now because fuck tunnelers
---
Ofc, longer gens are not fun, but they may add a new objective like searching for gens part arround the map in order to fix them. More fun, more thrill and more time for the killer (also new strategies) 
---
Sneaky oink 
---
Yea, I guess I thought there was good potential in the perk.
---
You really can't tunnel. Because then your obsession changes and you gotta waste time leaving them and finding someone else. STBFL's whole thing is gaining stacks, and you don't do that quickly if you tunnel (because you only get one stack off an injured person).
---
you think the change is fine because it doesn't effect you, that's all I got out of your message, i'm not offended its just banter or whatever you call it.
---
Huntress Main here. Please let me shit all over you.
---
Well Discordance is good because it lets you know if 2 or more survivors are working on a gen aka gen rushing.
---
I think it's absurd that we had to wait just about 3 years for this cancer perk to be changed for the better. 
---
I can address those claims pretty easily 
---
1) there is counter play aside from dribbling. When someone has DS they are basically free bait I've seen survivors go through tooth and nail to save the obsession you dont need to pick up the obsession to smack everyone whos near and as long as they stay on the ground that's at least two survivors out of play trying for your attention. If you want a perk with no counter play look at adrenaline there is absolutely nothing i can do to stop the instant heal and speed boost. DS is also really inconsistent ive seen multiple videos and streamers hit DS and nothing happens. 
---
2) the last time i was hit with a ds was about 2 months ago as mentioned before. Before that i cant remember every getting stabbed the 4 seconds doesnt mean anything if they dont get to hit you with it on top that with enduring makes the stun last one second with the bonus of swinging through pallets like there's no tomorrow and thats just one perk that counters DS. You dont actually need any perks to counter DS but you cam use enduring, unnerving presence, mad grit, and if you really dont want to deal with the obsession rancor. It takes some know how and the perk is useless.
---
3) yes multiple of anything is annoying af. But i would argue multiples of adrenaline and dead hard or so much more annoying. And on top of that those two perks dont need you to wiggle to 40% to even be an issue.
---
Survivors bitched and moaned on end for ever about tunneling and now devs reworked a perk so that it no longer punishes the killer for winning a chase and discourages tunneling and survivors are still screaming and crying
---
STBFL is already anti-tunnel. DS is now anti-tunnel, so if you just use STBFL in the best manner (not tunneling to get more stacks quickly), then DS doesn't exist for you.
---
I main a killer honestly. I didn't mean anything I'll no need to get defensive, friend! I wasn't even responding to any of the above- he just simply said randoms don't care about totems so I gave my input to that! 
---
To your point I'm not against a counter by any means. I was just referring to that one part- not anything else really. I have a red ranks killer and my survivor honestly floats around 6-8  I'm not that great @ survivor.  And honestly I've never waited 40 mins or even long for a lobby solo or swf so I'm sorry about your wait times. 
---
A needed one, as well
---
Many killers are whiny manchild who don't deserve to even play killers because they'll just whine at the slightest inconvenience to them.
---
No it isn't 
---
It's good for 3 gens strat and low ranks, but other than that, that's it. The only time I actually use Overcharge is on Doctor,since that's his teachable anyway
---
god damn! 
---
I mean potentially, but only if they down you after an unhook. Lot of killers would just slug ds anyways before.
---
Well the game actually punish facecampers. If your team rush gens, the killer will not take more kills, or even if he does, its a lose for him (not enough bps) 
---
Lol, devour hope being a good perk. Gl getting to 3 tokens
---
Im a killer main. I was ready to leave the game if the DS change wasnt to my liking.  
---
Im glad I waited. This makes DS completely ok.
---
You worked hard to argue a point that can't be argued. Playing killer is super fucking ez. 3ks and 4ks  dont take much work if you know what you're doing. Reaching rank 1 killer takes no skill at all. This game is way more killer sided than ever. Ppl who bitch that got the perks nerfed just dont really know how to play a good killer and/or just bitch and whine when they dont get their way
---
make survivors more op, nice
---
People that defend gen rushing are not allowed to complain about camping and tunneling.
---
The entire point of ds is to have a second wind. If the killer doesn't tunnel. You get a second chance. It's not wasted. It's a mind game. 
---
yawn 
---
Clown gases area to prevent chase after ds, GG
---
Hag: You shall not pass add on, GG
---
Every other killer: Ebony mory GG
---
Well this is just the tip of the yikesburg.
---
It's literally all over reddit, youtube, twitch, and the forums. 
---
This is why they changed the healing meta. So now survivors can either slow down on gens to heal up or they can still power through the gens but also be injured.
---
It's still rough at high ranks and Ruin is essentially required there, however 
---
You don't get to use your perk if you're not tunneled, though. It's a wasted perk slot. You might as well have brought something else.
---
Do you think it could have a potential buff?
---
Go on the killers and press F11
---
Or complete 3 gens vs hit hatchets 4 times... Yeah right same amount of time and effort thank you.
---
Those were already issues with or without ds stop acting like that has anything to with a change. 
---
If you get 3 off gens while 4 are alive you're still losing gens, if you kill someone and then get 3 off gens the game is effectively stalled. You can't realistically occupy 4 survivors, specially with most gens left.
---
Oh, it's no bug
---
If you let survivors get all five gens, it might also be because 25% of your loadout/match preparation was irrelevant up to that exact point in the match. Everyone remembers when we're one-shotted near the exit gate, but it's harder to consider whether we'd have made it to that point  in the first place if the killer could have spotted us healing by running Nurse's Calling instead, or saw us across the map a few times with BBQ, or made you run around looking for Ruin, etc.
---
&gt;Personally, as a killer main, if the game gets to the point where the Exit Gates are powered, it's because I fucked up by chasing one survivor too long, or by not kicking/protecting gens enough. 
---
I don't know if that's a great standard tbh, killers running Blood Warden and Remember Me for instance are geared for end game, they're naturally going to be making less progress earlier in the match, but who's to say that they're not just as effective at killing. 
---
As killer it's our job to kill so don't complain when we re-kill you right off the hook every time you come down
---
Borrowed is shit now t h no one uses it
---
oww...jesus christ that sounds terrible
---
How did they buff 4 ds swf? Each of them can't create a 3rd chase for free now.
---
No Noed rework, break totems please
---
Yea and you don't get to use unbreakable if you don't get downed. Or borrowed time if he gets no hooks. Or deliverance if you die first or get no unhooks. Or self care or dead hard if you don't get hit.
---
Everything in the game is situational. 
---
you said that stbfl promotes anti tunnel anyways so nothing changes, NOW you cant tunnel, because of the change, so your implication that ds doesnt exist anymore doesnt make any sense
---
D-Strike rewards survivors for going down
---
NOED rewards killers for having gens finished
---
1. Cleansing all totems as a solo player is not a valid tactic. If survivors had an in-game UI or a way to communicate then it could be. At the moment, it takes 70 seconds to cleanse every totem, and this does not include the time it takes to actually find the totem. You running Small Game just to counter the possibility of NOED/Team not doing totems/Team doing totems but not finding that last 1 well hidden totem is not a viable counter whatsoever. Instead of doing totems, do gens. There is a reason the meta exists, and why small game isn't there. When the end-game comes around, we use Adrenaline and hope we arent the unlucky one to be found first because thats much more effective.
---
2. This is 100% a nerf to DS, and it is well called for. In an ultimately casual game with competitive elements, second-chance perks should have never been created.
---
Exactly, that's my entire point, lmfao.
---
no it isnt
---
If only doing the wiggle made you invulnerable in DBD too.
---
Lmao, if you use it optimally, it is.
---
Have the rest of your team do gens. As a killer main a killer should not get more than 1k from face camping, maybe 2k if he has NOED. But if he gets 3K or 4K , your team we’re just sorry.
---
"Nerf their abilities and delete them from the game"-I can't tell if this is serious or another shitpost
---
All your suggestions why it's not broken is highly objective and relies on the survivors incapability to hit DS.
---
Letting a survivor on a ground won't hit you with DS but you barely get any benefit of it. No survivor on the hook means way less pressure for the remaining survivors to go for the safe. Going for the safe means going off of gens and that's what a killer wants.
---
"The last time I was hit with DS was 2 months ago". Buddy that's just your point of view, Rank 1 survivors are usually never missing DS unless they are really bad at hitting skillchecks. You didn't tell me a single thing that can prevent the 4 second stun. Enduring, yeah, but that 1 second stun is more than enough for a survivor to get to a new safe pallet spot usually.
---
And how is dead hard an issue for you but DS not? Dead Hard is the most predictable perk in the game, just wait a second while you're chasing them and they use it and then swing. And you should inform yourself better, you need to wiggle to 35% and not 40%.
---
But you're ignoring the fat-ass nerf that comes with those buffs:  
---
* If the killer doesn't tunnel, then DS does absolutely nothing.
---
The FAQ wasn't there when they originally posted the changes. Good to know its been clarified
---
If searching for parts was part of the game, survivors would get destroyed by killers. Obliterated. This is coming from someone who plays more killer than survivor. The game is so far from being balanced for a new objective like you suggest. 
---
DS doesn't exist if you don't tunnel, STBFL used optimally doesn't tunnel, ergo, STBFL users will never be hit with DS. DS doesn't exist anymore for them. 
---
Huh, that's a lot of words that didn't address a single thing I said. That must mean you're right!
---
&gt; You worked hard to argue a point that can't be argued
---
lmfao
---
Then you should easily be able to counter my argument.
---
btw I'm gonna mention real quick that I was very polite to you, so you coming in all rude and sarcastic says a lot
---

---
Help me understand how its a balance, when you DS you become the obsession, so what?
---
I'm super on board with these changes, but I think it's too little too late; DS isn't nearly as big a problem now that enduring is on every build again. That, and there are more pressing issues that we've heard nothing about. 
---
Non-functional windows, auto-aim hitting into walls/missed medium-vault hits, NOED, and the best killer in game right now is the fucking loadscreen. Friendship ended with MLGA, now task manager is my best friend.
---
Who knows though, after another 2 years maybe the devs will get around to it. 
---
This Darth_ dude is wild. I wrote a post politely addressing every point he made then he just ignored it all and wrote a rude comment in response 
---
Sure, anything is possible
---
Okay thats pretty awesome.
---
Shit worked fine months ago, I played both killer and survivor, my ping can be anywhere from 80 to 140, I dodge anything higher. I come back and fucking I'm getting hit through windows after I'm 20 ft away already, I'm getting hit THROUGH pallets, I'm body blocking for a friend and the hatchet flies through ME and hits them still. This is **NOoOoOT** a latency issue. When I DO have latency, it doesn't act like this. Killers and survivors are T posing around the map. It's fucking crazy, but nah let's nerf a perk MOST survivors don't even use anyway and killers have 2 ways to counter to begin with. 
---
There is Unbreakable but think of the mind game mixing DS with No Mither. (No Mither needs changes but who knows when that will happen.) As killer, you know they are gonna get up if you slug but do you risk getting DS'd in the process.   
---
Aside from making Unbreakable, Tenacity, and I guess No Mither potentially stronger, I don't personally see the perk changes as being particularly positive as a whole.
---
ughhhhh work
---
We bring things like adrenaline, or borrowed time, to increase out survival chances in certain situations. Sure you don't always get chased as last gen pops. But it's meta because when you are in that situation, it clutches the game.
---
DS in my opinion is even stronger than it was before with the addition of mind games and killer having much larger risks in tunneling.
---
If that isn't what you want, fine. There's over 50 perks in the game to choose from.
---
But acting like this change is any different than any other perk is silly. 
---
I'll still dodge after the new matchmaking drops, too. Doesn't mean I'll never play against an SWF, just not if I don't have to.
---
&gt;Also this comment is funny since recall you saying something about entitlement above.
---
Why is it funny? I'm not entitled to play against solo players, it's just my preference... doesn't mean that I can't use my leverage to get it. 
---
ughhhhh
---
I thought its been DS since it was introduced and before that it was sprint burst, but, i dont think theres any complaint worth listening to besides them right?
---
Borrowed time only works if the person who saved you is running it, and you have to be in the killers terror radius. It also only works for 15 seconds. This is a full minute of protection from being farmed by the David that decides it’ll be a great idea to come get you while Billy has his saw charged up.
---
They stated that it does count down when slugged 
---
I feel that would be too strong honestly.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/at9488/todays_news_in_a_nutshell/egzilct/
---
I wouldn't consider them equivalents either; NOED is just a demon tier "rank crutch" perk while DS was an easy way to counter bad killers who aren't good at chases.
---
It's not like the game has an unreal amount of safe pallets/ windows anymore. Worst part of D-strike was non-obsession DS.
---
Idk; I was a killer main for a long time before they made it too easy, and months back I never had a problem with DS. It's not nearly as much of a game changer as Unbreakable, Deliverance, or a 4% kobe.
---
No, I dodge SWF lobbies if I suspect it. Lol was that supposed to be controversial of me or something? 
---
I like it but let the killer dribble. Its hard enough to get them that close to a hook
---
OK, but bow you only can get dsed if you tunnel someone and down them less than a minute from them being unhooked, and even then you could slug them for the remaining 10 seconds or whatever. There is great opportunity to avoid ds both by not speedily tunnelling, or by playing somewhat smart if you do.
---
It’s hard, but possible.
---
But it's a latency issue remember? And it's a favor the shooter bullshit. So unless shit is fucked like we've been saying, it's Not latency. 
---
i'm currently neutral on a NOED nerf but the devs said in the FAQ for the d-strike update
---
DS CHANGE HAPPENED, HOW ABOUT NOED CHANGES?
---
We aren't planning to change NOED at the moment. We consider that NOED has multiple gameplay counters and is currently in a good place. We do not think of NOED as an equivalent to DS.
---
so probably will be a while if they nerf NOED at all
---
Git gud
---
I hope they nerf NOED now, the toxic survivor perk nerfed time to nerf one for the killers 
---
It is a fantastic game balance change that also addresses a common, long standing survivor complaint. The only people complaining are ones who never would have been satisfied no matter what
---
Alright, cleanse totems
---
I have to say I find it so strange how Dbd refers to survivors and killers as 'he' or 'him,' even though half of the characters are female
---
When I first saw the 'from the void she kills' trophy I actually thought you had to grab a male survivor because of that description
---
DS and borrowed time would be a nice combo together 
---
This is a huge nerf to DS, the killer can choose to risk it or not, and it gives an extra benefit to such perks like STBFL, PWYF, and MYC.
---
I keep a shitlist of killers who like to facecamp and make a point of avoiding them. Sadly blocking them does nothing so I’m obliged to make the effort to check each time. 
---
Oh dear lord, your idea for NOED. And as a killer main, I don't even use it. It's not hard to cleanse all dull totems so it doesn't activate
---
Lol the timing thing worried me at first but tbh it's perfect. I might even start running it. 
---
same as before, it's just only used it you get farmed off the hook or tunneled. 
---
I mean it is unless you can count to 60 seconds before you redown someone 
---
I just feel like:
---
Free hit huh? ok
---
I bet you eat celery with a spork be quiet.
---
&gt; it’s not like the killer is just going to not tunnel someone in to dying state after they got unhooked. 
---
So your argument if I understand it correctly is that, all killers tunnel and changing this perk will only make them convert to slugging after tunneling. 
---
Doesn't that open up more time to complete generators than the killer dealing with d-strike if they hook after? And hasn't this same problem existed simply without a hook after it to the person that is the obsession due to d-strike?
---
You're worrying that the current play-style for killers will not change due to this rework, and that's the problem?
---
The much easier path for killers is simply not to tunnel, and go after the survivor that unhooked. If you do this, you don't have to wait for the full 60 seconds and don't need to hang around to ensure that the person isn't healed. You also have more healing to be done with this method.
---
Slugging has and always will exist, if this change increases it its going to be by a small amount at best.
---
I don't think they'll change a perk they made have the exposed effect on all three tiers just a few months ago.
---

---
Easy 6 sec swap :) 
---
You're not wrong. I can only go off of my personal experiences heh. 
---
He just wants to make thick in the warm.
---
It really adds to the interaction between ds and dl. Ds made it harder to kill the obsession where dying light made killing them insanely rewarding. Now it's the tunnel perk vs the anti tunnel perk, and just tunnelling someone won't permanently cripple the rest of the teams progress. Gives  you far less reason to camp survivor number 1 to death is survivor 2 can become the obsession and turn off dl
---
I mean if he doesn't risk it you live... If he risks it you waste time and are in the same place you would've been prechange... I don't see where the nerf is? And how is that a benefit to any of those?
---
Exactly. Lately, I've started to feel like DS is only wrong if there were multiple of them. It was honestly one of he only OP things survivors had left - pallet vacuum, double pallets, insta-blinds, insta-gens etc all completely gone. 
---
Yet they're reluctant to touch the killer side of things. Survivor lately has already been pretty unenjoyable. Things like The Legion, Moris being imbalanced, unfun perks like NOED, OP add-ons like Prayer Beads, Omega-blink Nurse, 90-second exhaustion hatchets, etc. 
---
Against fair killers (killers who don't use OP shit or play like an ass), I feel like this change is welcome. But DS was one of many things that don't belong in this game. 
---
Pig ain’t original though.
---
Lol wow killers getting there way again. Shocker, this game has gone down the drain now 
---
Its fine the way it is at least I think so.
---
Unlike Ds, NOED might never come into play as its a late game perk and so could potentially be a waste of a perk slot.
---
If you have a problem with Noed, by equipping small game you are bringing somewhat of a hard counter.
---
And Noed provides a more tense expereince for the surviors, when i finish all 5 gens I feel a wave of reassurance that I'll survive and because of that i will tend to play like a maniac, stealth pretty much leaves my body.
---
But with Noed in play the tension of evading tbe killer continues all the way till the end.
---
Perhaps the speed buff could be changed but then Hope would increase in power like crazy. Its definitely hard to balance this perk
---
True. All good points.
---
You may have.
---
There... *maaay* exist, something of a 5th Column in the World Of The Fog.
---
Maaaaybe... some are... *concerned* about THE ENTITY'S growing power and... flaunting of HIS influence.
---
**SOME**, I dare say, whom *I am not one, occasionally protest HIS power.
---
But gather what you will... meatbag.
---
Don’t worry, my man. In about two weeks time, there will be a new unveiling of a perk called Decisive Strike. Let those farmers YOLO save you. You get tunneled from a hook?  Decisive Strike that camper in the neck and run away like the joyful Meg/Ace/Dwight you are. 
---
The Trapper traps are not latency. Nor are the grab mechanic bugs.
---
*Shut up, moron.
---
if you're going to correct me do it right.
---
Say you kill your dying light. You get d-striked. The obsession would change I'd assume? Then do you still get the DL benefits cause your original obsession was dead or do you have to kill the next person to have it apply again? The whole thing is confusing. It's a great idea but I want more of an explanation on how it'd effect other obsession perks.
---
Oh yeah I’m just talking about before.  Effectively the old DS could be used in both this situation and in any situation.  Now it’s much more limited.
---
spirit 
---
Maybe with the end game rework comming soon
---
Self care isn’t a bad perk
---
&gt; because DS was being so Meta
---
DS is not meta. It's just good for pub stomping bad killers as a survivor who is good at chases.
---
If the survivor can't utilize tiles well, if nothing is learned out of the behaviour of a killer when getting downed first time, if the killer has an iq over 80, DS is a dogshit tier perk.
---
Tbh, I realized that I’ll always get gen rushes. 
---
What I do is pick 3 gens in close proximity and keep those for end game play. 
---
I don’t apply pressure at all to the really far gens because it’s a waste honestly. 
---
Dabbing was so 2017, Jake. 
---
The nerf is, survivors don't get a get out of jail free card anymore, and the killer has the choice to actually tunnel or not. If the killer doesn't  tunnel, you're out a perk slot, live or not. STBFL and MYC both benefit from not tunneling already (STBFL for more stacks more quickly), so this change ensures that they get their usual benefit and effectively never have to worry about DS ever again.
---
There's a lot of factors to take in with dying light.
---
What if your obsession is a stealth god and you never find them until all 5 gens already got completed and you just spent a whole game looking for one guy only to never get any use of dying light?
---
What if your obsession is a good runner and they can run you for a long time and you just wasted a bunch of time going after one person while their friends finished all the gens anyway? 
---
The only "immersion" I concern myself with is the amount of blood I bathe myself with, utilizing the "deposits" former sacrificial lambs offered after their hooking.
---
Meatbag.
---
I tell you what, I've pulled more survivors off gens with Piggy than I have with Myers. Haven't played Spirit, so I wouldn't know about her.
---
Fear the oink.
---
So if you're the last person on the hook, everyone else leaves, then you manage to unhook yourself that means you're effectively immune to being downed as you get a free escape?
---
It’s like saying NOED only lasts 60 seconds long. The whole point of DS is to not get hooked in the first place, or to save it and use it later. If killer doesn’t pursue you after being unhooked, DS is a waste of a slot.
---
Combos perfectly with breakdown
---
So just nerf the bonus BP? And have BBQ being just an aura read? That’s....not great. 
---
Don't really know if this is a very elaborated shitpost or the most passive-aggressive rant I've ever read
---
Amazing what can happen when you don't try to just run meta 2nd chance perks!
---
B-)
---
Give them the Buscemi treatment
---
In the unnerving shitstorm that is today, thank Lord McCote for ThatBrownMonster and his genius meme power. 
---
Thank you!
---
Camping is always a legit strategy. There's no rule against it.
---
If i expereince this i tend to just Dc, i dont play this game seriously at all and if you want to waste 3 minutes of my time by keeping the game hostage then i'll just waste the last 15 minutes of yours
---
The mori one is legit though. Now you have no chance at all to use DS to prolong your chances. Can’t use it on first down, and next down you can’t as you get the mori. I know killers can dribble to prevent that first down DS now, but with this change there’s no chance at all.
---
I saw that comment and that's why I commented. What if I really am that guy, and not a sarcastic comment?
---
Lol I remember widows, it was such a okay movie
---
FTFY.
---
All of your reasoning for saying it is broken is rooted in anger and it shows. Leaving them on the ground is not beneficial? Slugging is a very real strategy and even has dedicated builds for it. And yeah im more than happy to chase a survivor while keeping an eye on the one on the ground. Claiming rank ones are gods at hitting skill checks is absurd that would mean ruin and overcharge would be useless because they would never miss. I told you that a 4 second stun doesnt matter if he doesnt have a chance to use it. And i am sorry i was off by 5% not like it matter when non obsession never get the chance
---
Adrenaline's implication when it's used by a 4 team is scary; ruthless gen rushing
---
But in regular matches, adrenaline is a non-issue
---
So you want a perk that just counters the killer being successful. Got it.
---
Survivors screamed and screamed and screamed about tunneling and now something was done about that and you still scream and scream and scream 
---
No no, you can't just list subjective things, we need specifics. No one is going to agree on what are weak perks, what is unfair or unfun, or playstyles. 
---
I was having the same thoughts but because I am solo and my teammates make crappy saves.
---
ah, thought it was actually in the game... good it doesnt exist.
---
ZA WARUDO
---
I do not understand how worked up people get over these two perks. I 50/50 each side here, and last night was the first time I've seen NOED proc in weeks.  My thought wasn't rage, it was "damn, he got us!".  Have fun with it.  Sometimes the odds are just not in your favor. Embrace it. It's part of what makes the game unpredictable.
---
Source: https://clips.twitch.tv/EnjoyableMushySnailKreygasm
---
It's a nerf because as of right now, DS isn't a situational perk, it's a good choice in *every* loadout against every killer on any map and against any strategy. The best choice. If you're not running DS and your goal is to escape alive, you're handicapping yourself. 
---
You can still slug them if it's not much time lost. Someone has to go and pick them up, which means one person isn't on a generator.
---
Maybe you should have replied to them then
---
this is literally a worse version of borrowed time
---
But no, DS was more important because killers literally can't stop crying over such a little thing.
---
I swear to god, I want to curb stomp the people who thought DS was a more important issue than being unable to play the game, and I want to stomp the fuck out of the killers who direct attention away from the real problems.
---
It means you can get DS if you’re getting tunneled or camped. 
---
WELCOME BACK MY FRIEND!
---
I mean it did affect me positively I guess? The change to ds. I mean you have to a game where there need to be mutipler ds (new version) survivor with a killer that has dying light.  And the killer have to sacrifice the obsession before another survivor trigger the ds. The odds of that happening to what previous ds can do to the killer would be lower I hope? 
---
And it will be awesome for a slight rancor buff I hope?  
---
Plyf and stbfl would be just swapped over after ds is used. Might be a pain for killer slightly for that. 
---
I guess dying light will take a huge hit in very specific case. 
---
Can only hope it's better?  If it's not, the dev probably could revert it back? 
---
Trash at high ranks. Only might work the first time time and that's it
---
Look for a safe gen and stick it like a bee to a sugar mountain. If the Killer comes I'll UE to another dimension if that's what it takes for him to leave and let me finish MY gen.
---
Sometimes if I see a couple teammates doing nearby gens I'll go to the other side of the map to prevent a 3-gen endgame.
---
If it's mildly easier to mori vs a perk just straight up ruining the game. I'll take that trade. 
---
True but as a person who’s been farmed multiple times by Asshole teammates I’d take it over just getting immediately rehooked. If the killers not camping and my teammates have two brain cells to run together they’ll simply make sure the killers not standing on my tits before they unhook me. 
---
Considering how much annoying shit a killer has to throw against survivors, I think like the 3 or 4 things survivors have is not a big deal
---
What? Currently non obsession DS is even more annoying. It waste FAR more of the killer's time and is harder to play around.
---
&gt;Ok, I'll live with the fact that I played the game *like trash*.
---
Start running Enduring. Cut a 3 sec stun down to less than a second. 
---
My opening move is usually to take 2 steps, make eye contact with the killer, and die.
---
This is why I’m a killer main.
---
Your OP is exactly why NOED is not a problem at least in BHVR's eyes. 
---
I'm trash for simply killing someone via camping when I know gates are open?
---
I don’t use DS anyway because it’s too difficult too time, but my brother does he’s pretty good as well I like how it punishes camping and tunnelling but I hope they haven’t made it useless because the way it looks too me now there’s no point anyone running it, and how come they only ever nerf survivor things and not killer? Whenever I see that they’ve needed something it’s always to make it more difficult for survivor
---
N O   M I T H E R   M E T A
---
Thanks for the amazing discussion. Really insightful. Almost as if I wanted my own comment, which would be seen by more people since it would be the first comment in the chain, to which I could see all replies under my comment. 
---
What they did ? I cant find it 
---
Oh no, we have to spend two minutes not rushing gens to avoid this thing that we'd rather rage about! Stay calm and get those totems when you pass them by.
---
I see this post all the time and I'm convinced you are *trying* not to see the point, or talk about something unrelated. He's not calling you or your buddies out for repairing generators you donut, he's commenting on how fast generators can pop.
---
Those are two completely different points, yes? 
---
A smart killer can ALWAYS dribble to a hook. As a killer main I can promise you right now, if I don't want to take the decisive, I won't. That perk is meaningless against me.
---
Even with nonobsession you can feel for the 40% and dribble from there to be safe.
---
This is a huge buff to being nonobsession decisive, its a massive buff to QOL for survivors, and it's a mild nerf to obsession. 
---
You can kill multiple, and dying light gets disabled when theres a live obsession

Copy pasted from the article than apparently no one reads completely 
---
Dying Light
---
The active Obsession has the altruistic action speed bonus while they are alive.
---
If the active Obsession is killed, Dying Light's de-buff is applied to all remaining survivors.
---
True. But lately killer games have been remarkably easy. In theory survivors have a huge edge, but with how a lot of maps are designed and constant tweaks to placement of things, survivors seem to have a rougher time on an individual basis
---
You'er not at all proving what you think you are but go off lmao
---
&gt; The skill check area will be slightly larger to make it considerably more accessible to those who occasionally struggle with hitting skill checks.
---
Hey, maybe No0b3 will actually be able to hit it now /s
---
Stbfl and myc are the literal exact same they were before... This change does nothing to them.
---
And uh yes they do... Did you not read any of my post for the situation break downs? It sounds a lot like you just want to whine. So if you do end up having something with thought behind it. Let me know and I'd love to debate with you. 
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but the devs have said they aren’t changing it for now because they’re happy with it
---
Because people want to bitch endlessly about not having more objectives, but also want to bitch endlessly about having more objectives.. lol  but don't mind me, I'm over here cleansing these totems getting their blood points.
---
All I'm saying is that if a particular comment was your reason for commenting, then maybe engage with that comment. Or be a coward I guess
---
considering that it now only triggers after an unhook it will actually probably be pretty regular to down the d-strike person close to a hook so i think it's reasonable for there to be no dribbling
---
It has an 60 sec timer. 
---
Well lullaby is huntresses only good perk and it’s a totem so it gets broken in the first 2 minutes anyway 
---
That means they did touch the stun duration... seems like the only bad decision they made when changing this perk
---
Is everything okay at home?
---
/r/whoooosh 
---
Yeah, I mean I can just DC in mori games anyway ;)
---
I’m good with the change to DS, but I would never use it unless the clock stops in chases or especially when you are downed.
---
Versatile. He and Jake take turn fucking each other. 
---
Almost everyone I've ever seen bitch about DS has been the type to chase someone out of their league all match and never swap focus/ create map pressure (on even small maps)
---
DS's only utility is pubstomping bad killers. Against any killer with above 80 iq it's a useless perk.
---
They added that after the post but thank you. Michaels perks all a bit more useless now oof. 
---
Oh, I didn't see that? I bet that will be reversed after release.
---
They cover this in the FAQ, if obsession is killed then d strike triggers, the killer must sacrifice the new obsession to get there DL effect back.
---
ah, the last refuge of the person who was bested. Amazing 
---
Camping is camping. Justify it however you want. Just know if you camp you are a ... camper. 
---
The conversation STARTED ABOUT DS.
---
Let's review:
---
&gt;[JasmineOnDiscord](https://old.reddit.com/user/JasmineOnDiscord)Huntress Portrait -4 points 4 hours ago\*   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Man the **perk** is dead.  
---
&gt;It's 3 seconds stun, down from 4. Enduring makes it non-existant.  
---
&gt;It's weaker borrowed time now.  
---
&gt;Noed changes when? Iri-head, prayer beads changes when? Omegablink,  Mixtape, moonwalk exploit changes when? R exploit changes when? :D  
---
&gt;edit: also it punishes you for being able to run the killer around  for more than a minute, at least make it pause the timer during chase.
---
&gt;[imveryfontofyou](https://old.reddit.com/user/imveryfontofyou)Spirit 5 points 3 hours ago   
---
&gt;The  difference between ultra rare add-ons and a **perk** is that you can't run  prayer beads or iridescent heads every frigging round.  
---
&gt;[imveryfontofyou](https://old.reddit.com/user/imveryfontofyou)Spirit 2 points 3 hours ago   
---
&gt;No,  they aren't. The before mentioned items aren't really balanced either,  but the idea is that you're spending a shit ton of bloodpoints to get a  one-use item, while **perks** are a single purchase.  
---
&gt;Now, if there was an ultra rare survivor add-on that had the effect  of **DS instead of DS being a perk** &amp; cost 7000bp every time you wanted  to buy it from your blood-web, I'd be fine with that.
---
Don't try to come at me &amp; say that we weren't talking about perks, because you started talking about perks in this thread about perks, I responded about perks vs add-ons, I literally said add-ons aren't balanced (hence why I'm not going to "make a good argument" for them being balanced), and I continued on about the idea of DS, the perk and what it'd look like if it was on equal footing with the ultra rare add-ons that you mentioned. From the start, my point has been that DS in its current form as an inexhaustible, one-time purchase, sucks.
---
But tbh, this entire discussion is a shitshow. You've been putting a lot of words in my mouth &amp; inferring the wrong meaning from most of my posts and blatantly ignoring the context of the discussion, and I don't know if you're doing it on purpose because there's a specific argument that you want to have, or if our styles of communication are clashing, or what, but it's getting kind of exhausting.
---
It's in the FAQ portion
---
&gt;If, at some point in the trial, another player becomes the Obsession, Dying Lights de-buff will be removed as the Obsession is considered alive again.
---
That's a massive debuff to Dying light. On the other hand it buffs Rancor as it says you can potentially Mori all 4 survivors if each were an obsession.
---
Nerfed a bad perk and buffed a decent perk.
---
Trust me, the mind game of it existing is such a buff to QOL. I think it'll be really good. 
---
Correct. But the killer jcan no longer just assume you have DS if their not running a Ob perk.
---
In my experience, rank 1 survivors are the dumbest idiots in the game who only got Thier rank through grinding but rank 1 killers got there out of skill.
---
So I'd believe this.
---
You can only use it within 60 seconds of being unhooked but the person with ds only becomes obsession after it is used, if someone else does it after you, they are now obsession and you no longer have to reach 35% wiggle.
---
But the big thing is that it is only usable after unhooking for 60 seconds
---
Watching go much Noob3 fam
---
There's a problem if killers *have* to enact a 3 gen strategy 
---
So your issues are not latency, but survivors issues are? Sounds like bullshit killers would say to further buff killers, survivors have issues? "Oh it's just latency, get better internet! LOL!"
---
I mean, I got to rank 1 without using DS.. It's honestly not even needed
---
the FAQ mentions that perks like dying light will deactivate until you kill the new obsession,
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/48455/upcoming-ds-changes-q-a#latest
---
We gather the most asked questions and came up with this Q&amp;A. :)
---
Question for devs: Suppose a match begins and neither the killer nor any of the survivors have any perks that cause obsession, but one of the survivors has DS. Does the match start with an obsession, or is no one considered the obsession UNTIL DS is triggered, causing that survivor to become the obsession?
---
Basically my real question is how does the game handle obsessions? Can a game begin with 0 survivors with the obsession status but one gains the status mid-game, or can you only transfer an obsession status that already exists on a survivor? The second scenario could mean that as killer, if you aren't running any obsession perks, and you see an obsession at the start of the match and you can rule out them running OoO, then this would mean that SOMEONE in the game is running DS. Obviously this doesn't really have the biggest gameplay implications, but it could possibly provide a bit of intel to the killer. Mostly I'm just curious about how the obsession mechanic works under the hood.
---
I've already explained how this change benefits those perks, and have explained my argument two or three times now. Yes, this change benefits them. 
---
Did you read my posts? I don't want to whine, I haven't "whined" once this thread. Reply to me again if you get some reading comprehension and get a grip on what I've repeated over and over thus far.
---
just kidding 
---
But this doesn't directly affect the killer. As a killer, you dom't know someone is using the perk untill you spot them at wich point, the perk is no longer usefull. Adrenaline on the other hand is just very frustrating to be hit by since not only does the person you were potentially about to down get away, they also get an extra life all while entering end game... the moment you're already about to lose as a killer. Not saying it's OP or anything. (Altough I would like it if it only woke you up when you are injured and sleeping instead of waking up and healing. Or maybe healing, but not waking up)
---
No, of course not.
---
The hatchets on both sides are latency. I was not intending to say that hatchets flying through survivors is not latency. 
---
Trapper hit boxes and grab mechanics are not.
---
You know this. Cut it out.
---
That is such a mood omfg
---
I mean... I'm currently in red ranks having never used DS. I wouldn't have called it training wheels personally, that makes it seem like every survivor used/uses it at some point.
---
This. So this.  They keep nerfing survivors into the ground and wont touch the many game breaking bull shit that is on this game. Which is why it might not last throughout the year. 
---
I think Remember Me will still keep its tokens once the obsession switches, which is actually a really good thing for it.
---
Tunneling is a fair strategy, if someone gets unhooked while I’m barely 20 meters away from the hook and all I see is the injured guy he’s going back on the hook.
---
Yeah, it's like how Tinkerer was removed and replaced with a different perk.
---
All the SWF I met are mean and such. Screw them and NOED the hell out of them.
---
Holy shit. I think I'd just uninstall if I had to deal with that. 
---
When do memes and shitposts credit the original source/meme? I obviously do not claim ownership of the original famous comic.  I only added the DbD stuff. 
---
I'm just wondering if you are feeling alright. 
---
We all come across a lot of abnormally upset people on the internet, but sometimes we need to take a step back and realize through this sea of anonymity that we are talking to another human being. I posted a comment and you replied to me with hostility. 
---
There is a reason you are angry, and that reason isn't me. We all have our bad days, so I am just wondering, are you alright?
---
Do you still have the option to just ignore the skill check, without even trying to hit it? Doing that used to let you conserve DS for later in the match.
---
That’s kinda sadistic. A very Freddy thing to do.
---
I agree that DS has needed a change for a while now, and the change is for countering tunneling, but if a killer really just wants to tunnel someone, couldn't they just slug them for a minute and then avoid DS? I feel that if you go down within a minute of being unhooked then the perk should stay active regardless of how long you are on the ground(deactivates if picked up). That way even if they just ride your a@%, you still have a chance to get away.
---
True true true my b that guy just has it happen a lot to him, not a big deal on a subreddit but ig and fb pages have stolen/edited his stuff without credit all the time
---
I have actually noticed that it's nowhere near as bad for killers as it used to be. Also, you get shitloads more bloodpoints which is always nice.
---
Okay lol I'm done with you. Go on with your ignorance XD 
---
I’ve just stopped using it cause 3/5 games i massacre the team before the gens are done
---
I Honestly kind of like the idea that if you've been hooked twice you're exposed, would reward hooking and looking for other survivors. I never use noed because its such a crutch and vs-ing it just cheapens the killers skill, but this would depend on killer actively hooking survivors.
---
 I used to suggest definitely buffing the points for cleansing totems (motivation) or then along the lines that if you found a totem it would light up on your hud until it was destroyed and grey out, so you'd know how many left if say on solo. Noed is counterable but not naturally, it should feel earned for doing extra or on you for not getting all the totems, which is sorta the 2nd objective.
---
Hope there is a change like the ds, which i think i think is actually cool, because like anything the problem is how they're abused, 4 ds is ridiculous, but facing a good killer to only then get hit with noed, is just garbage. Both kill the game's replay-ability. Need to change perks for more situational and earned benefit, not just given regardless of skill or active planning.
---
all I'm saying to you is that you're cowardly for not engaging with the comment you had an issue with.
---
but keep on projecting man. peace 
---
The objective is to do gens. There's no timer to get gens done by, especially with a good looper wasting the killer's time.
---
So is DS still going to make you an auto obsession unless someone else has more or higher tier obsession perks or will it no longer auto start an someone as obsession until they use DS?
---
No. The problem is you're awful at this game as killer if you find gens are being done too fast. You are either unobservant to audio and visual cues that indicates survivors whereabouts or awful at chases. 
---
I only use it because I don’t have surveillance. It basically notifies me at lower ranks when a gen is being touched.
---
You are downvoted for no reason my friend. If everyone would try to do one or two totems each match, that perk wouldn‘t be a problem. 
---
A totem takes only 10 seconds to clear. It‘s not even hard. 
---
And you felt the need to reply with that, why? To have the last word? Pathetic. 
---
It's not meaningless to you because you're still dribbling your obsession. Even if that's all Decisive Strike did, make the killer waste time on every hook and fill up the survivor's struggle meter, it would *still* be a strong perk worth running in a lot of builds. I understand where you're coming from, that a lot of players are freaking out over very little, but it's still going to be a generally less-effective perk than before. 
---
Lol you too bud. 
---
i read it as being that you won't auto start as obsession while using DS and will only get it after using DS
---
Yey I can now hook farm and it isn't a problem 
---
For the obsession, probably. For every other survivor in the game for now on, it's a buff. 
---
Its not licensed this time. Also its going to be the oldest killer in a timeline standpoint.
---
Eh I play console and honestly once you know to expect it Overcharge becomes less of a threat. The only killer I bother using it with is doctor and that’s because I run his distressing/ overwhelming presence build. 
---
Yep, that’s one of Myers’ best parts
---
The perk is now fucking useless
---
Thats impossible to consistently do if you play solo. I do agree, just cleanse the totems but if you are playing solo, it makes it nearly impossible to find all of the totems and to make sure they are all gone before it pops. 
---
Pretty good art.  
---
also the blood looks pinkish...  
---
is that a mother fricking danganronpa reference?! sorry i had to
---
Well, it is a strategy that works, yes, but it's not exactly "fair" to that survivor that has zero control over when they get unhooked. It's a game so I like to make it fun for everyone involved.
---
Obviously some people don't care about the fun of others though, I understand that. It's best just to ignore them.
---
I actually like it a lot, thumbs up!.
---
I think though that if they stick around to heal then that should be punished.
---
DS can now be completely taken out of the game, and NOED can be completely taken out of the game. One promotes not tunneling, and the other promotes spending time off of gens to cleanse totems. They're both fine.
---
Only after u unhook tho :/
---
You know better than to try logic, it never works. He doesn’t want to hear real answers, he wants to hear his answer parroted back for self gratification.
---
Dear god I’m hoping it’s the first
---
They probably should go for NOED next. I personally never really had a problem with either perk, but I understand why most people do. I like one idea someone posted where NOED lost the instadown but gained 40% cooldown reduction on both successful and unsuccessful hits. Still quite strong, but still gives survs a chance to escape it.
---
Hopefully. I’m definitely taking Unbreakable all the time.
---
I really do think though that QOL would be much better for both sides if the clock stopped. For that person who uses the new DS, gets tunnelled off hook, but does well enough in chase that their perk can’t even activate after being downed...it’s going to feel bad. An anti tunneling perk that doesn’t activate despite the fact you were tunneled...sounds like BHVR lol.
---
If DS is a problem to you, maybe you should follow your own advice LOL baby killer ez
---
Without haste, hope would most likely become meta which would mean that a nrw perk would be needed and killers dont have the room for that kind of situational perk ontop of Noed
---
Without, exposed or limited exposure you have a perk thats really active for about 5% of the game which probably wouldn't be worth even looking at
---
Online disinhibition effect. Goodnight.
---
Getting wooshed already sucks for a person e
---
The problem is gens are literally the only objective survivors have beyond cleansing the occasional totems and rescuing their teammates. They need other objectives that offer a big enough reward to make them stop humping generators throughout the game. Hallowed blight was a great example of this. You didn’t need to run ruin because throughout the match, survivors would see a flower and go do that for a minute. 
---
It doesn’t reward the killer for losing, it punishes the survivors for not playing the other objective, the totems. One of the few perks that can be completely invalidated before it can come into play.
---
Then what is the correct answer?
---
Hmm makes sense, ty!
---
I wouldn‘t mind it having more since I‘m not a silly tunneling twat.
---
It‘s a great change. Killers are cured of a plague while survivors get a counter for tunneling. 
---
I love how, even with the snout and the pig ears in clear view, he still mistook her for a survivor.
---
Sorry for changing the topic here but it would help me come to an understanding with you if you told me what changes you would like to see with noed. And yeah I do agree it is kinda bs sometimes but nonetheless it is counterable
---
If you are a filthy tunneler it is a buff...
---
Someone said the devs said it's a one time use on Twitter.
---
Ok let's fuck up adrenaline, balanced landing and self-care too because killers are too sensible for playing against barely usable perks
---
