Ash is a tough boy, he can handle it ;)
---
Ever heard of a rank reset?
---
agree
---

---
you cant change killers to only having to get a 4k, it awards camping and tunneling to guarantee kills, and rn the adept survivor trophies award overly immersed and useless survivors.
---
I‚Äôm a Survivor main for the whole course of the game like legit never played killer one time. One day I just felt like I should play some killer. It amazes me the amount of noise a survivor makes even when they weren‚Äôt even injured. All the killers I play against just don‚Äôt play with sound or are like listening to music or something because the shit they miss is kinda ridiculous.
---
Oh geez. My bad, I don‚Äôt often pay attention to usernamesü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
EVERYONE is OP.  We should just split up the killers and the survivors entirely and just let the survivors repair gens and escape, while the killers kill stationary targets.  That way everyone wins!
---
Toxic killers too!

I did this In a game yesterday.
---
Generators done killer is distracted by picking up a survivor to bring to hook, 3 people left because one disconnected and me and the other survivor were at the gate, I was opening and let the dying survivor get hooked and left the door at 50% the survivor waiting at door with me took over and I rushed the hooked survivor, I then booked it to the door. By then the door was open.
---
So if you have someone to take over opening then let them take over
---
Nah, I‚Äôm a selfish survivor who would leave sooner than going for an end game hook.
---
Even if they did blacklist it and programs similar they would have no method to check to see if it was running outside of directly pulling a list of all processes running on your computer, which it in itself ranges from massively shady to outright illegal in certain countries. Even if they were to do ALL of that people could just use the phone version of discord so yea the point is pretty moot. An interesting idea just practically impossible to enforce.
---
I love it, I love the character design concept also
---
Pro tip for all you PlayStation survivors/killerinos. Sony is pretty strict about toxic behavior and if a survivor or killer starts flaming you report them without replying
---
You're annoying thank you next
---
Thanks man :)

---
Good for you man! Wish i woukd still enjoy it. Well if you can't beat them then join them. Guess ill become a sweaty nea with a toxic purple flashlight.
---
thanks for being the one person willing to discuss   this positively unfortunately i‚Äôm not going to be able to respond, I‚Äôd love to respond all these comments but as you can see, any dissenting opinions even if respectful tends to mass downvoted. to avoid that i‚Äôll just thank you again for being the one person discussing things like a normal human being
---
Holy shit is this 2013 or something
---
I figure if they give a flat buff to Open Handed and rework the luck system to also affect chests and potentially spawn location Ace would be a solid character.
---
2012 called, they want their doge memes back.
---
Well you don‚Äôt play often because it happens all the time I remember I had a hag no no me because I pretended to make a mistake so my friend could get a head on save
---
Just a small correction, the survivor can only see the killers aura when looking in his direction, not at all times.
---
On console dbd comes with doctor and hag
---
No, those act normally. What would that indicate?
---
Adam is perfect
---
Have you seen what they did to Claudette's waves? They look like greasy beach hairsssss
---
Some perks and Myers' addons, the perks are devour hope and rancor
---
idk if you know this but /r/dogelore is pretty alive and well
---
This is like super delayed but the movies and tv series are completely separate
---
Maybe the add-on could be something like
---
-iri
---
-increase range
---
-a charges faster
---
-stops when you hit a survivor
---
-you slow down a LITTLE while swinging the chainsaw (since its charges faster you ll could just get closer and hit someone easier)
---
-changes the chainsaw model
---
Doing essentially nothing. Just actually running around and trying to evade the Killer semi-compitently.
---
The trouble is that because of how hard the community is divided, it‚Äôs hard to make changes that don‚Äôt fuel aggression is the flame war between Killer Mains and Survivor Mains.
---
I friended the survivors I got matched with. This'll make a pretty toxic swf lmao. I found out the killer in the match I was in was new to the game. So I gave him some tips for trapper.
---
Miss Piggy, classic.
---
I'm buying her with shards when I get enough, I don't want to play her a bunch because puking is a tiny bit gross but I want to play her just so I can signal out a survivor and puke on them all game just for the fun of it.
---
You can use Hex: Devour Hope which is a Hag perk. You can use an offering like you just mentioned. You can use the Tombstone addon for Myers. You can use a spirit perk called Rancor. That‚Äôs all I can remember off the top of my head. All of those have requirements you have to meet, but they‚Äôre all pretty straight forward.
---
I never see it any more, which is good
---
If I'm in a game and exits are powered I'm opening that door.
---
How the flying fuck do I know what the hell your swf are doing at the end game? You could be being the most toxic anuses this side of Christmas for all I know and I don't want a part of that. You could be lost/unsure of where exits are/hiding/evading the killer - buying time until the doors are open etc.
---
I'm gonna open one. Cos that way the team know there's at least one open exit. At least one person is safe to leave. If the other three are hanging around a 99% door then you now know I've opened the other one and we're all safe to leave. 
---
Egc was introduced to make the end game more risky. More fun. So yeah open door... Leave. Simples really. Getting Salty that someone started a timer (that slows down when a surv is downed or hooked) and your swf bud or you died in that time is purely no one's fault but your own. This entire game is about choice. You obvs made a bad one, got Salty about it and came here to tell others how to play.
---
How is you game so bright and clear?
---
Noice. üëçüèª
---
Theres no an official responce to the "Deliverance and luck topic", the devs  turn a deaf ear when someone talk about it as a Bug. It's a [steam comunity theory](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1733213724903304520/?fbclid=IwAR1jmulSKo9Cm7oilsVaY7tTjRG3CrZnoTibsaLxDmCfvO3Qpg2yQ2d-ky4), but when you  "attempt to escape" a luck  clover  is  is shown in  HUD.
---
Whatever, it is always possible to add in the perk description "Your chances to unhook yourself in the first phase of sacrifice will be reduced to 0%".
---
You have to be consistent with her vomit, contaminating everything the survivors come in contact with. The wiki says that environmental objects stay infected for 35 seconds so you can use little vomit when infecting gens, totems,, etc. The key is to get them to a point where they have to cleanse. And when they finally do cleanse to immediately re infect them so they can cleanse again. I usually get to a point where all the pools are used up and corrupt purge is automatically ingested. Try to make sure that the amount of vomit spewed on to survivors is large so it speeds up the infection. If you deal with survivors who don‚Äôt cleanse, work on active listening skills because the groaning and moaning of infected survivors give their position away.
---
Get spine chill and walk or crouch away and hide before the killer gets to you. Always look out for the nearest pallet when youre doing objectives so you have a loop to go to if the killer finds you.
---
Unless people just fed him

i was gonna say that but i didn‚Äôt want to seem rude

unhook me, you?

me too tbh but i guess my eyes took notice because of the slur

That really sucks

Ive gotten called a hacker for having nurses like he didnt catch on i tried to tell him read my perks and he just argued with me then i just left
---
Finally!!!
---
This should be pinned

Wow! Incredible! You completely and utterly missed the point of an incredibly simple video in an attempt to justify your shitty toxicity and to devalue his argument because ‚Äúsalty killer!!!1!1‚Äù.
---
but where is nea??
---
Youre doing it to early.  The blind needs to occur after the killers shoulders stop moving
---
Bloodloust is not op its uselles the existence of it dont change no thing for the killer
---
You dont understand the essense of the horror its not  give unlimited power to the killers its about give little power to the victim, they have to know that one mistake its death that is how you have true horror and this game fails in that if the killer have one error and he loost but the surv can do a lot of mistakes and win
---
Karma is a bitch xD
---
I understand the recolor for that, and the addition of it being changed to be a bit shorter made it look a bit better, but by god it looks too thin.  It lost it‚Äôs charm too.  I am glad only about the change to Nea‚Äôs dreads, Kate‚Äôs hair, and Meg‚Äôs long ginger hair.  Jake‚Äôs long hair looks okay, but he looks a bit too spanish for me (not racism, I just don‚Äôt think the look suits Jake)
---
The classic ad hominem
---
Rank reset happens on the 13th of every month. There's a breakdown of it [here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank) - in as simple as I can make it, basically everyone who was the top rank has come down to at least Rank 10, and really the difference between a Rank 1 and a Rank 5 in individual skill isn't THAT much (It's usually a bit of luck or SWFing to Rank 1) So you'll end up with a massive skill variation.
---
Killers can and will experience survive with friends groups of highly experienced players with all meta-perk builds that will basically make fun of you for being new to the game and type 'ez' at the end, more often than not. (Not all SWFs are like this, but a great deal are)S urvivors will experience high ranked killers with meta-perk builds and often lots of Ebony Moris and overpowered add-ons in general designed to get themselves out of that rank asap.
---
Basically your play experience isn't going to be what it was if you were a rank 16 playing in one or two weeks.
---
That's kind of weird that it's like that since I'm still using the same amount of charges and still blinding the killer but beggars cant be choosers all just remember that from now on.
---
The 3 year anniversary
---
First you need to check or guess if they are a SWF then you will proceed to read the other comments to follow the procedure/methods.
---
tunneling isnt ‚Äòbad‚Äô, its just low skill. the point of these achievements being achievements is that you have to put in time, skill, and effort to earn them. if theres a way to ‚Äòcheat‚Äô through these achievements, or theyre so easy everyone can get them, its not much of an achievement. its like a participation trophy. thats why the killer achievements require a double pip - its difficult. you cant get it through tunneling and camping. it requires knowledge of the game and how to actually play.
---
making 4k adept wouldnt change anything, thats why i said you cant do that. you need to make the survivor/killer achievements even, so youd have to change the survivor achievement to needing to double pip as well. this way both sides are rewarded by their skillful, experienced gameplay.
---
You are getting downvoted because no one agrees with you. That doesn't make people disrespectful for doing so.
---
And yes you attacked Tru3 personnally when the post is about the point he is making. If someone is disrespectul that is you.
---
Play huntress if u want a slight challenge to start, she‚Äôs easy to understand and learn, but hard to master effectively. I‚Äôm relatively new too btw, so If u want help i play on PS4 so are welcome to ask :)

......WHEN DID I SAY BLOODLUST IS OP?
---
Ok give me buffs to make the killer scary? Power does not equal terror name one game where it is legit scary online?Also survivors can make mistakes but depends where in a chase they can die on a gen a killer can see them but killers miss a hit they can retry the dark times are over and it is no longer where they make a mistake they‚Äôll lose he‚Äôll the EGC is practically a safety net
---
Huntress said yes to the entity so she wouldn't have to hide her sexuality anymore
---
Does the add ons that increase the time of infection om objects worth playing around with?
---
I was gonna guess Swamp too.  Always start on the very perimeter because it can spawn all the way against the wall in the corner and you need to be pretty close to hear it.  If it's not there it's usually in killer shack, the main building or the double story house.
---
Yea i tab out to.. I typically watch videos while in the lobby/loading

Oh my god, we going to play this game brother? There is a error in your name ‚Äúgamerdood12‚Äù it should be ‚Äúgamer man twelve ‚Äú.

I only like SOME of his content, and it‚Äôs just the fact it‚Äôs the videos that exposed OchiDO for being the garbage he is, editing out the clip where OchiDO got destroyed by Tru3, and only putting in the portion that made him seem godlike, oh, and how he showed OchiDO banned him from commenting because he had a valid point lulz.  I can‚Äôt stand watching his videos after hearing the subscriber audio, I get headaches too easily and that sound destroyed my head when I saw his review on Kate.  Props to him for this clip tho, but I‚Äôd rather all Red Rank Survivors not get prejudiced to being simply ‚Äútbag tbag click click click.‚Äù
---
Can you clean totems?
---
STOP

Im really glad you didnt user link her, her poor sweet soul shouldnt be exposed to this filth.

Are u joking? You have to be kidding right? You've played dead by daylight before right? Not the mobile knockoff game I'm talking about the behavior interactive asymmetrical game dead by daylight. Cause if you have played it, you'd understand.
---
"it would ruin the game because it would encourage people to play the game"
---
Bro this is awesome! I can only imagine how long it took! Truly terrifying
---
This is the reason I started running Distortion. Way too many reveal perks and it‚Äôs hard to know which one each killer is running.
---
Act least I‚Äôm not the only one who calls it scaredy cat
---
Checked your comment history and you‚Äôre not a very positive person. You‚Äôve also complained about spirit before so I just assume troll or really bad at DBD if you can‚Äôt try to counter and just say ‚ÄúToO oP nErF‚Äù
---
I can see a joke about it persisting for 4 hours or longer, consult the doctor or nurse. Although knowing the nurses Mori , that may just make it worse... uh better
---
Prox camp to guarantee survivors death
---
I don't think they're worth it. At low ranks, survivors aren't going to clense anyway. So, infection time doesn't scare them away from that.

*do not let them bleed out*. if they die on the ground you dont get points for their death. instead, focus on one survivor at a time. pick up one survivor and get to a spot you can easily down them again once they wiggle off. open areas or next to a ledge so they fall and stagger work best. hook them dead, rinse, repeat.
---
i enjoyed it.
---
Then it should be unfair to use perks like decisive strike because at the end of the game it promotes slugging so the survivors don‚Äôt escape. Moris arent made to promote tunneling and camping and a good killer won‚Äôt target someone unless they are a threat (if they have object of obsession) Mori‚Äôs are to help endgame killers get a final kill if it took 2 hooks then it would worthless to use over something like rancor, also if a killer uses a mori they should at least know that if they attack everyone they will win more easily then if they focus 1 person
---
I didn't down vote but people are agreeing because it's happened to them.
---
[removed]
---
it was really hard for me to read that title lmao
---
Decisive strike was already nerfed, dude. On top of that, it's sole use now is to attempt to not be tunneled, but Mori stops DS entirely since you're not gonna pick that survivor up again
---
How was I being disrespectful all I said was he generalized a whole group of people in a negative way, that‚Äôs not good for anyone. Lmao people can‚Äôt stand seeing things they don‚Äôt like on this sub
---
Yeah that one and Red Forest are the hardest hatch spawns for me to find usually.
---
It's not only about pipping it's really about getting to enjoy the game with players of your own level and not being kerb checked by every passing Rank 1
---
It can be serve its purpose but it's not with a monthly reset. A fourth of all playtime becomes a shit fest because of the reset. Up those resets to, I don't know, 3 months and it becomes much lower at a twelfth.
---
It‚Äôs funny to come here and see this because I just finished a game where someone 99 the door and it caused two survivors to die when they could have escaped. They chewed out the person who didn‚Äôt open it in the post game chat.
---
I'm proud to be a miss piggy main.

It's horrifyingly sad how accurate this is.
---

---
Few things with this.
---
Firstly, how do you propose his Boomstick and his chainsaw are worked into the game? Y‚Äôknow, without it fucking things up?
---
Secondly, by ‚ÄòBad Ash‚Äô I assume you mean the villain from Army of Darkness? Keep in mind they only have the rights to Ash vs Evil Dead, it‚Äôs not a simple task, getting the license to something.
---
This is masterpiece. The narrative, the wide range of emotions by the actors, and who could forget this twist ending, I love it all.
---
&gt; Ebony Moris are ultra rare offerings and their appearance on bloodwebs conflict with ultra rare add-ons and other ultra rare offerings so they aren't that common.
---
My hag only has 9 mint rags, 5 waterlogged shoes, and 32 Ebony Moris. 
---
Also, if you have the other licensed DLC killers by owning the DLC, you get no splinters for them meaning ultra rare nodes are either gonna be an ultra rare addon or an Ebony. 
---
Billy and Nurse lack Ultra Rares, meaning EVERY BLOODWEB you get at least one Ebony.

I remember that but that was during insta flashlights and pallet stun glitches.

Not gonna lie, a map on a boat would be pretty sick.

I main her alongside spirit and piggy! The plague is like my favorite though, her design is so beautiful in a scary way. This piece looks good, hope to see more from ya in the future! :D
---
My mom said the exact same thing about meg when she started playing.
---
Lol, no. 
---
3 minutes is more than enough time to save a teammate from a hook. 
---
Maybe work on chases if you find that you are getting caught dying when the exits are open.
---
Why does ranked reset happen so much and why does it exist? Like what is the actual point? Like am scratching my head trying to think of a good reason why. Am I just stupid?
---
Take my upvote and keep preaching my guy!
---
People need to be more aware of what their doing in this game. The complaints that are constantly made on these kind of things need to stop.
---
I should do this with my gf I just got her into DBD aswell I wonder what she thinks everything is
---
If you ever decide to pick Nurse up I suggest you watch a YouTube video by ‚ÄúArdetha‚Äù and check out his Nurse guide. By far it was the best guide I‚Äôve come across as I got more things explained compared to all the other guide which just said ‚Äúyou have to learn by muscle memory‚Äù.
---
What's the joke
---
&gt;for no reason
---
Perhaps because the killer wanted to kill?
---
Yes, the game is peer to peer, but it still makes sense.
---
The OP is asking why it takes so long to create a lobby as killer. If you try to start up a killer game, especially around the time of the BP event/Ghostface launch (and even now), it can take several minutes for you to be able to even start a lobby. That's because a remote computer is still required to "introduce" the killer and the survivors. The killer can still host the game, but there are still servers out there bringing the two groups together.
---
When a spot is available, it allows the killer to create a lobby to wait for survivors to join. This does not affect the wait times for the game because if there isn't a spot available, it means that other killers are still waiting for survivors to join their games.
---
Now this may not be EXACTLY how it happens, but it's probably fairly close or representative of the process.
---
Source: am developer who has designed a queueing system between remote clients.
---
... I've been playing the game since it came out and I still call it scaredy cat.
---
Same thing happened to me on the Torment Creek map awhile back.

You‚Äôre delusional for claiming survivors don‚Äôt get nerfs and not even knowing that they nerfed DS. It was a great moment for killer mains so you not even knowing makes me doubt your whole ‚Äúkillers are ignored‚Äù spiel.
---
I agree.
---
2/3 of those things aren't BMing though... it's not the only deterrent. Why can't others see that lmao. Let's not bullshit and claim that people are only avoiding them because they 'make people BM'. They're just not as effective.
---
if someone says camper or tunneler, you know youve done a good job. take it as a compliment
---
Just a tip.  If you're looking to find people to play swf with it helps if you list the platform.  PC Gamers responding to your X Box version ain't gonna be too helpful.
---
I was a nurse main that was AWFUL with huntress, but now I feel comfortable playing her at red ranks. It‚Äôs honestly worth it is what I‚Äôm trying to say, you gotta be ok with losing because winning with huntress has to be the most satisfying thing to me personally. I had plenty of hours in the game so I had General chasing sense but her movement makes you need to get good with hatchets so I watched Huntress mains like Ralph and Umbra and the rest is history. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about perks too much if you‚Äôre intention is learning the killer because then when you get a nice perk set up is like a bonus.
---
That's actually a pretty cool idea.
---
You're not allowed to do it on this page cause some sad guy polices it and reports you so I have to ask what the swf page is
---
Lol
---
3 games in a row i get 3 team mates one with a key all 3 of them just running around from the start of the game to search the hatch... i'm so done with this game
---
‚ÄúsWf iS sO tOxIc‚Äù good plays!!!
---
Sauce?
---
Yeah, you're totally right.  Fuck the 1-2% killers that play someone other than Billy, Nurse, and Spirit.
---
Nothing like waiting 10 minutes to get a killer lobby, another minute for some asshole to decide he's ready, another minute of loading, and then having to start again because someone disconnected while loading.
---
You didnt watch the anniversary stream did you? They have all this planned for upcoming releases. Google dbd road map itll show you :)

---
Ahhhh yeah reddit mods are the fucking worst lol.
---
&gt; they‚Äôll hide before you reveal them resetting the reveal.
---
I think in the closed beta (Which I was in, trapper was the only killer.) the hatch actually DID spawn at roundstart. People could bring a key, find hatch, and all 4 escape for the achievement before a gen is done.
---
If they bleed out do you get points for the kill?
---
Since I know that Michael in Tier 1 is immune to all aura reading perks, I've had this burning question. If someone is running Object of Obsession, would I be able to see them but they're not able to see me due to me being in Tier 1?

im making fun of bhvr

Yikes, you kinda seem like the asshole here, my dude.

You gotta give them credit for the Rift tho.

Butt why are u wet

Lmao how am i the asshole when i got 3 teammates just running around doing nothing with 5 gens still up searching for hatch explain that to me?
---
Yeah you get points for their death.  But you won‚Äôt gets progress towards and emblem.  So you will have less a chance of ranking up if you slug them all really quickly

* Your devotion to the memes of the outerworld has charmed the Entity, and granted you with the ability to replicate it in his domain in a brutal fashion.
---
* Killers can now hide in Lockers. While inside a Locker, the Killer **has no terror radius.**
---
* The killer can exit Lockers normally, or perform an **All-Star Exit.** When an **All-Star Exit** is performed, the beginning of "All-Star" plays, and any survivors in range of the locker are automatically put into the Dying State.
---
* If a Survivor is put into the Dying State by an **All-Star Exit**, the Killer will now emit "All-Star" to anyone within 20 metres for 20 seconds, slowly fading out near the end of the duration. If no survivors are affected, the Killer is stunned for 1.5 Seconds and remains in the locker.

Lauries right arm is stretched a little too far and the chin is a bit pointy for a female character. But nothing is wrong with your art its just my opinion
---
You could've been a tad nicer in explaining to them instead of starting off with "you stupid kids"
---
I did the first 2 games. But if you get 3 games like that in a row it aint funny anymore
---
I think that a DC should result in the entity  immediately sacrificeing them and the killer getting the blood points and perk activation
---
Because you went out of your way to message someone, insult them, and then tell them they've "triggered" you, over a fucking video game.
---
This community needs 1 giant chill pill to share.
---
After that massage they kept searching for like 5 mins. Do i have to say anything else?
---
Pop goes the weasel really helps.  Try to make sure the last few gens are decently close together so you can hook and kick them to regress progress.  Like others have said other perks go with this like discordance or surveillance. 
---
Also knowing when to slug and when to hook to create map pressure is pretty good to know.
---
You ever watched umbra? She‚Äôs a legit huntress who doesn‚Äôt really have any problems in red ranks
---
1) Nobody cares, you don't need to make a vent post on Reddit because someone camped you. Chill the hell out.
---
2) Dude clearly enjoys making people salty, and congrats, you took the bait.

It means yo ass is in danger! You‚Äôre the obsession! Run!
---
I main the fuck out of Trapper, and before I got Ruin on him I primarily ran Sloppy/Brutal/BBQ/Distressing for the extra points and the extra pressure the terror radius increase provides. I'd give up on a chase if they were leading me to a strong jungle gym/pallet area and I had already hit them once, I set up traps around the basement and the generators near it, and I wouldn't leave that area unless I was sure I could catch somebody quickly.
---
Got a guy who was like, prestige 3 Claudette, every perk you'd expect a survivor at high ranks to run, and a flashlight. If he threw a pallet down he'd wait there for me to break it, teabag, and chain blind me if I broke it. He would rapid clickclickclick if I walked around.
---
I spent like, no time chasing him, if I hit him, I let him run away and went back to my generators, I knew I wouldn't catch him before at least two generators went off. 
---
Got at least 2 kills after his mates decided to divebomb basement and got trapped on the way out. End of match, whaddaya know, a rank 4 in a group of rank 11s. "gg ez boring trapper"
---
Yeah, alright buddy. Be glad I don't like playing Nurse and Spirit.
---
Anyone who dislikes this video and its statement out themselves immediately as the exact problem hes targeting.
---
I know this, which is why I tagged it Salt/Rant. I personally believe that there should be more counters to things like this, which I'm sure other people can agree. I don't care about it being bait, I know it is.
---
Being a rank 6 and needing noed...
---
Damn, I've been had. Guess I'll die.
---
So you dont like tru, but you said fuck all about his point, so try using your brain a bit more next time you speak?
---
You're welcome
---
I love it
---
Yeah but if you don‚Äôt run a mori decisive strike is basically a survivor mori after 1 hook you get a free escape from the killers grasp on stealth builds you become unkillable because you let your team do gens then you freely escape no worry. And even though it was needed it is still the strongest perk in the game it‚Äôs sole use is not to avoid being tunneled it‚Äôs got multiple uses that are almost all just to get a free endgame win (if decisive strikes one use is to avoid tunneling the the same can be said about dead hard)
---
The sporty lesbians nerdy girlfriend
---
I dunno. Maybe not call them kids but definitely shit tier teammates honestly
---
Nobody is disputing that camping sucks ass for the person getting camped. What I said is that nobody cares that you're mad you got camped. If everyone made a post every time it happened to them, the subreddit would be oversaturated as shit.
---
And yet, you still decided to fall for the bait.
---
... stop tunneling the guy off the hook and you solved your own problem.
---
&gt;That's what i want changed lol. Im fine with green being from 1 hook, but red meeds to be from 2 hooks. I play survivor and killer at red ranks, so its not like im trying to be biased, but the Ebony Mori does need that change.
---
Mori'ing someone on death hook is kinda pointless unless you can't get that person to a hook. If you have BBQ, hooking that person is a smarter choice. 
---
Ebony Moris used to be way worse anyway, killers could kill you on first down, without requiring hooking. 
---
Perhaps make it so you can only start Mori'ing once all survivors have been hooked at least once (like getting 4 BBQ stack)? or after X hook events.
---
we already have hag and backwater swamp, same thing
---
I always 99 the gate and some rando comes up and opens it
---
EGC allows killers to just down survivors and let the timer hook them for you, DS literally is only a problem if you tunnel.
---
If a killer tunnels it means they are just bad at the game. I don‚Äôt know why people need nerfs for all killers when only those toxic killers are the problems
---
oh you think her puking is gross? just wait until you have to sit in a lobby looking at the left side of her face
---
You're responding to someone else buddy.
---
1. Hag doesn‚Äôt have a lullaby
---
2. Hag isn‚Äôt sexy af

3. All star
---
But just like this comment, youre propping yourself up to be some humble deity yet you contribute absolutely nothing except unwarranted claims, you arent showing you have any want for civil discussion despite claiming so.
---
lmfao can you not read guy? I never said I didn‚Äôt like him. I said he‚Äôs referencing a situation specifically to him and not all people are like that. why does everybody get so triggered over basic discussion. use your fucking brain, triggered little prick
---
And yet, I still made the post. I made this post saying that it shouldn't be a playstyle, I'm only posting something like this once. Yup, I fell for the bait, and you restating that doesn't change my mind.
---
Damn that was hilarious I got a good chuckle
---
They can stand it lol theyre responding to you, you just aren't getting the reaction you think youve earned
---
Sure man big guy
---
Switch over to M1 for struggle and other actions. Mouse buttons always have way more click life than keyboard keys.
---
Hol up, you play on PS4?  I went against a Myers today and I‚Äôm pretty sure he got this achievement against us haha
---
im slow thank u omg
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand
---
Listen this would be cute. However I'm a Christian boy and in the bible it says that satan takes many forms to tempt us and I will not be tempted by the demon known as laurie strode
---
just bait the pallet 9/10 they drop it and if they don't just stab them in the butthole
---
I think the point he is getting at is survivors have a higher chance of acting like dicks if they feel safer in game. If they play a P3 Nurse who can teleport right on top of you and hit you they are constantly worrying about doing the objectives to get out but with weaker killers survivors know they can win so the toxic behaviour comes out. 
---
This doesn't happen every time but anyone who has played killer will have a story that backs up what Tru3 is saying in this video. Heck when I play Nurse on PS4 without fail at least 1 survivor starts clicking and bagging because I am useless at teleporting and hitting people. This puts me off trying to learn her because its not a fun experience, I know I am crap I don't need them rubbing it in lol. This mentality occurs with weaker killers and more so when your at high ranks. It then becomes a vicious circle because it isn't just that you lost as a weak killer its that the survivors rubbed it in and mocked you the whole game making you feel shit, so you turn to a stronger killer and you start to win and kill those pesky t-bagging scamps causing their to be no incentive to play a low tier killer. For someone like Tru3 this is probably worse as he is very competitive so he will stick to what he knows wins, myself I am more casual with my killer and don't care about 4k or double pipping but it still sucks and puts me off playing a weak killer when the response is toxic. Nothing worse than someone messaging you 'ez' when you have deliberatly taken a game easy and just tried to let everyone have fun. 
---
It isn't all survivors fault as some blame has to go to BHVR and how they balance the killers but they are kinda stuck because if they juiced every killer to have the dominance a nurse can display a lot of survivors would probably quit because its too hard, not everyone dedicates the time to the game Tru3 does so I get why they have to balance some stuff towards casual gamers.
---
Hi Meg I'm dad
---
While some killers do need Ruin, there are plenty of Killers that can do fine without Ruin.
---
Thano/Sloppy Legion,people dont realize you dont heal against legion. This slows the game down.
---
Just as an example
---
Alright thanks, i was just pissed
---
As a nea main I agree
---
&gt;Besides that,you can always play without ruin
---
How is he going to 4k at 5 gens left without Ruin?!?! 
---
Baby killers won't be happy until this happens on a regular basis. 
---
Countless times I've killed all survivors with 1 gen left or just the gates to defend. 
---
The match starts when killers give survivors a second objective (unhooking and healing) and depending how good you are, it escalates from there.
---
I saw a game bug out where a Laurie was in a spot she shouldn't of been and she won once her other teammate died, no hatch or door or anything, just as soon as the other survivor died she got the escape. Could of happened to them or they found a key in the match and got the hatch open with it. It won't show up at the end menu if they didn't bring it.
---
It's more like the pack a punched ballistic knife or sekhmets vigor from origins
---
Now do you want a woman with a big booty that screams like a porno star or Jesus incarnate and the chillest Survivor ever. If you want porno screeches then pick Big booty Judy but if you want the literal god incarnate then pick Jesus
---
well i mean if your ruin is getting found that fast, it sounds like your games are already ending within 2 minutes anyway.
---
Get rid of Devour Hope and put on NOED and your complete!
---
"Zoinks, Scoob. Good thing I saw him before he Sawed me!"
---
People say that as a meme, literally nobody with more than 100 hours in this game unironically says all killers are toxic no matter what they do
---
All you have to do is not go after people who just got unhooked, and not tryhard and kill everyone as fast as possible. It's not hard to be a good killer.
---
Can I have both?
---
Well yes but actually no.
---
How in the world do you know what anything is in this game? This looks like something on the Super NES
---
It's fine. I do the same thing when playing after a killer game. A lot of times I'll get a "Wow this dude is playing freddy/billy/spirit this'll be ggez loops" and then after a few minutes it's completely rage filled.
---
My favorite streamers though are the ones that actually try to enjoy the game and don't rage or insult. I always end up jumping in their channel afterwards (normally the next time they stream) to thank them and give them a follow or something.
---
Support non-toxic streams! :)
---
You can easily club the survivors down tho, two killers after one survivor.
---
its just a worse afterpiece as it takes to place and arm while clown can throw it and get the same effect but faster
---
Doctor octopus is my obsession
---
Tires and patches of Trees can be your best friend against LF. When he charges the saw find an area with tight twists and turns as it increases the chance he will bump into something and throw a fit so you can get away. The other thing to do is to not panic throw a pallet when looping him as often a LF will charge the saw when they think you will pallet drop so they can destroy it quick and chase you. If you run through and don't drop the pallet it wastes precious seconds and usually extends your loop so you can keep going, you will have to get good at reading when that Bubba is pissed and will m1 you instead so you then pallet drop and stun them.
---
People complain about a toxic community, this helps fight against that.
---
I love meming with survivors, sometimes I'll be chasing them and they do a silly fuck up (run into a dead end), they just stare at me and do I innocent double tbag while waiting for their death, I'll just stare at them, shake my head and leave lol
---
Not a killer main but do play killer sometimes. I normally fully expect the Claudettes, Davids or Neas to have dead hard. Lauries, Nea and Claudettes normally have DS. I honestly automatically assume most people I play against have Urban Evasion and I'm pretty surprised when I see they're not running it, same with Self Care.
---
And also because of a David I had one day literally named "Anti-hook" I am fearful that the David is running with things that make it hell to hook people.
---
I can usually bait pallets but that‚Äôs after rank reset where i‚Äôm playing with rank 18s at a rank 14 skill level(not impressive but more than enough to get easy 4ks).
---
I would if I had the build, but I havent touched him since he came out
---
Are you really so simple minded that you think because people can work through ruin or cleanse it quickly it‚Äôs a shit perk? It still slows down the game hence why it‚Äôs meta.
---
A ‚Äúshit perk‚Äù is something like Beast of Prey or Unnerving Presence.
---
If Ruin is such a shit perk then why do I typically win these matches? Shouldn‚Äôt it be working against me because of how shit it is?
---
Unlike you I‚Äôll continue to play optimal loadouts because I have nothing to prove.
---
You‚Äôre my favorite kinda killer
---
The rules state the name must be censored, regardless of the situation
---
Just report them. Far more effective way and you won‚Äôt get banned/suspended/whatever from this sub.
---
they don‚Äôt know when they‚Äôre against a mid or low rank killer. i‚Äôve met plenty of mid and low rank killers that played better than red rank killers. doesn‚Äôt happen often but it does happen
---
Fair. I just like them because i‚Äôm bad at ending lops and it is full on anti-loop.
---
Thats me with nurse after getting no kills and teleporting to a survivor on the exit gate and going through the gate and hitting it from the wrong side, safe to say it was very EZ for them lol.
---
If you never tunnel then DS is an useless perk against you. its only usefull against tunnels.
---
I switched struggling to F, so I can pay respect to myself when I don't get saved.
---
Doc was the first killer I tried when I started attempting the killer side of things. This was before I knew how low tier he was, I just thought he looked cool and his power was neat.
---
I am admittedly very bad at this game, so I really cant blame most of my losses on Doc being weaksauce, but I honestly dont like playing any of the higher tier killers so I've already accepted I'm going to lose most games I play killer. That doesnt alleviate the sting from BM survivors, because being bullied when you already know how bad you are while playing a weaker killer is real demotivating. 
---
I love this game, but the toxicity that comes with it from time to time is why I have to take long breaks from it.
---
It's a Freddy dream pallet. I threw the original already
---
If you want em banned, report them to BHVR using BHVR's tools.  The reddit is not part of BHVR.  And naming and shaming is against the rules of the sub, and (if I recall correctly) the rules of reddit as a whole.  The only person you're likely to get banned here is yourself if you're not careful.
---
If you do try it make sure to use one Addon to increase the Feral Frenzy Duration, and the other one is up to you.
---
Regardless,i know the feeling. But at some point it pointless to run Ruin,in red ranks they either ignore it or its gone within a blink of an eye.
---
The Devs are AWARE of the Issue and are trying to improve the Spots with every Patch the throw out.
---
Expect some improvments with the new Patch, Freddy¬¥s Rework
---
ToTs is great, I‚Äôve gotten quite a few masks from them. I‚Äôm super stoked for their 2019 line, the Freddy stuff looks amazing.
---
Obviously this is right cus I call em the same things (except Meg who I just call "fast bitch")
---
I honestly wonder how this dude takes in all the memes.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt be getting them. And the fact that Asylum, Swamp, and Forest got new variations should prove that eventually every map will have five. It might be a while though.
---
Yes i am the god of dbd, but there is no trolling going on here.
---
You might just wan to hide and try using third person to reveal him because he won‚Äôt come out until you‚Äôre either exposed or close to being exposed.
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
They changed the pipping system to emblems, the old system was based on how many kills you got.
---
You dont drop from rank 1 to 20 btw.
---
Not necessarily, no.
---
Considering we're only getting two new maps this year, there's nothing saying we're definitely getting any more variations any time soon.
---
One suggestion on dbd forums is to use GeForce manager and let it optimize the game.  They said they could look around and stuff fine, but as soon as they move, it gets choppy.  That's someone on a laptop with integrated gfx, but still worth a quick try if you have an Nvidia card.
---
This guy always seems supppppper bitter about survivors
---
Rushing generators = Toxic, but rushing kills = not toxic? hmm
---
Begone thot
---
Replace unreleting with ruins
---
I tell you right now, if you camp. you are never gonna get a comment on your profile. because they will escape due to it being a bad tactic. unless theyre solo.
---
Regarding perk theme it‚Äôs a rework, so it‚Äôs supposed to change the rules. Regarding tunneling idk, that‚Äôs something that dying light has always had and I kinda got the inspiration from it
---
Who said you're not allowed to kill survivors until the gates are powered? nobody, dickhead, stop making up a fake argument to strawman. 
---
Start killing people when there are 2-3 generators left, to ensure you don't depip for not getting enough emblem points
---

I‚Äôd say go for Jeff... buuut as a Jeff Main I may be a touch biased. (He‚Äôs the only character in the game who I‚Äôve got P3‚Äôd)
---
Killer brought a Ultra rare ruin 3 I see.
---
I never said it was just because bm, if you see my post carefully my first point is precisely because people don't like to lose.
---
Sloppy is better than ruin, use that instead (depending on what killer you‚Äôre using)
---
&gt;fake strawman quotes, followed by KYS
---
typical 20 hour 4heads. You watch one streamer get bullied and you think you know the game
---
That's a bug? I'm new and have been playing the game for a month, I'm a killer main and have noticed it in every game I have played so far.
---
Yoshikage Kira*
---
Looks at the picture lol, a killer can just stand there and not let anyone though.
---
I just had that happen to me with a Hag. (Only perk was Devour Hope 1, DC'd after it was cleansed a few minutes in.) I also had a Freddy DC as soon as the match started on Ironworks which confused me because he brought a cake + Class Photo and Pill Bottle which are decent addons. He was set to make a ton of BP and just DC'd immediately.
---
Thanatophobia is Plagues best friend, it puts survivors in the position to either deal with 13 more seconds added onto gen repair time, or to cleanse and shave that time back down. Either choice is bad for them. Monitor and Abuse also allows you to get closer to the survivors before they start running away, which in turn enables you to vomit on more of them much easier. Other than those perks you can either go with pursuit perks (Brutal Strength, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Fire up, Bamboozle) or tracking and information perks (BBQ&amp;C, Discordance, Bitter Murmur, Surveillance, Rancor, Stridor etc.) Depending on if you are having more trouble finding the survivors, or catching them. Don't even bother with Nurses Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Coulrophobia, survivors never heal against Plague without cleansing at a fountain making them pointless.  
---
My personal favorite low cost add-on's are the Incensed Ointment (green pot) and Potent Tincture (yellow pot), combined they massively reduce your slowdown when charging and vomiting which allows you to keep up with the target survivor for a quick down once they break. Favorite high cost add-on's are the Severed Toe, Vile Emetic, and Black Incense. Save up on those for the purple and red ranks as no one wants to cleanse at those ranks, and the faster you infect them in the early game, the quicker they start going down. Black Incense in particular is nasty because their choice to not cleanse becomes their downfall by showing you wherever they are on the map at all times. 
---
If you are feeling particularly cruel, you can always put in one of the Apple add-on's, with the Purple necklace, wait until everyone is broken and has already been hooked at least once, and then go get the corrupt purge and go on a red puke rampage for a minute and 20 seconds. Funny side effect of doing this (most of the time from my experience), if they don't DC, they'll panic and start cleansing in order to avoid being downed instantly by her ranged damage.
---
Never forget to puke on gens, chests, items, and totems, but always prioritize the gens first (Fun meme build I once used had max infection time on objects and Franklin's demise, I knocked the item out of their hands, puked on it, and continued the chase. Every time they cleansed they went back to get their lost item and got re-infected by it. That build really only works at low ranks though).
---
Lastly the Iridescent Seal is highly underrated. It has 2 massive downsides: it slows you way down while HOLDING the puke, and it Shortens the time of corrupt purge by 20 seconds. You can compensate for these downsides by using either the purple tablet (increases movement speed while holding corrupt purge) or the purple necklace (ads 20 seconds of time to corrupt purge), But in all honesty I've never had to actually hold the corrupt purge, just charge for a second and release, so I never experienced the full slowdown downside of the add-on. I found that either the Incensed Ointment (faster movement speed while charging, faster Cooldown time) or Rubbing Oil (Faster puke charge rate = longer lasting puke stream for less time spent charging) are great alternatives. With everyone refusing to cleanse, this means that every time a gen pops you surprise attack them with rapid fire red puke. Its a bit niche, but far from useless, and has netted me multiple 4k games in purple and red ranks because no one expects it. 
---
Basic tactics wise, Always get the team infected as early as you can. If they don't cleanse, they are dooming themselves to a game long NOED effect with the bonus of being easier to spot and hear. They Will attempt to gen rush because of this, so it might also be good to bring in Ruin or Pop Goes the Weasel on top of Thanatophobia to slow down their overall gen progress. If they start cleansing, wait until they start cleansing at fountains closer to the center of the map before you start getting corrupt purge, otherwise only grab a corrupt purge during a chase when the survivor leads you to a corrupt fountain. 
---
I hope all of this is helpful to you, and don't be afraid to experiment with other perks and add-on's.
---
Remove NOED, its a great safety net buts also a great trap.
---
Simply,it rewards failure and you cant really learn out of being rewarded for failing.
---
A really nasty and quite effective Build i rund on legion is
---
Thanathophobia and Sloppy.
---
You can kinda choose the two others on your own.
---
You can add Ruin to buy you more time.
---
Or a certain spotting Perk, i often use BBQ and Chillie for the spotting and Bloodpoint bonus.
---
You want to use the best Addon that increases the Feral Frenzy Duration.
---
The Second addon can either be Cooldown,Power recovery, increased mending time or the iridescent Button.
---
You want to find a survivor and hit him with your Power,then if you hear a heartbeat go and try to get that Survivor, rinse and repeat until you dont hear a heartbeat and commit to the chase
---
Why this is so effective?
---
Legion is the best Killer when you want to Injure all the Survivor in a very quick way. 
---
So you usually have around 3-4 Injured Survivors.
---
Thano and Sloppy incredibly decrease the healing time and Self Care is very popular, so they almost heal for a MINUTE.
---
Besides that,some people refuse to heal against Legion however they will suffer the Thano debuff and are a 1 Hit. 
---
Of course this works best on smaller maps.
---
For real lol
---
if you check out his twitter its kinda filled with positive dad joke type memes
---
I think you answered your own question; if there's no reward for rank and no punishment for disconnecting, of course people are gonna DC whenever something annoys them or doesn't go in their favor.
---
I always get crap totem spawns on that map, but I think this is by far the worst one I‚Äôve seen.
---
I feel your pain. I fucking hate the majority of players on PS4 for reasons like this exactly.
---
11 to 15, and now I‚Äôm at 13
---
Claudette is hiding behind that coral in the picture for Tapp
---
3 games in a row you get a teammate with a key looking for the hatch...
---
...doubt.
---
Maybe run Thanatophobia and Pop goes the weasel if you don't trust Ruin?
---
I think Legions best perk is save the best for last (SBFL). You can get lots of stacks on that quickly. If you were to find all the survivors at the beginning that would be like 4 stacks right away because of frenzy hits.
---
The strategy is to stab as many people as you can with one frenzy, obviously avoiding the obsession if you can, and instead of ending your frenzy early while chasing the last one get a second stab in. It wont hurt the survivor at all but it will give you another stack of SBFL. Once you have 8 stacks you can end chases really fast and don't even need to enter frenzy anymore.
---
Infectious fright makes a good pair with a stacked SBFL because after you get a down if anyone is nearby you can start chase immediately and get free map pressure. I also like monitor and abuse so you can get closer before they realize where you are and try to get that first hit really fast when you are fully stacked.
---
So my suggested perk load out would be Save the best for last, Monitor &amp; abuse, infectious fright, (Free slot) But most people would put ruin here.
---
As for add-ons I just like the green add-on for longer frenzy duration, it can be hard to hit a whole group if they spread out properly.
---
Exactly!
---
When I hook you, I'll leave the area to get on other people. It allows for the easy unhook.
---
If I come back through the area in respone to the unhook, and ***you***  are the only person I happen to see, you are getting chased, and subsequently rehooked.
---
Why should I limit my play for the fact that you not adept at getting the f!ck outta dodge and hiding properly? 
---
It's this "Training Wheels" &amp; "Hand Holding" for Survivors that don't motivate them to get better.
---
I mean I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre wrong, I‚Äôm happy rank reset happens as it makes the queue times much shorter lmao
---
You mean making toolboxes not speed up gens?
---
Dude ur amazing - honestly, I hope even tru3 and noob3 change there ideology of ruin is almost neccesary and realize u have had the right gameplan all along with your superior game play mechanics dude
---
I call her lord and savior. I am legally required to say this comment was made by pig gang.
---
For some reason dodge posting is now popular again
---
OhTofu has 5000 hours in the game and is a fantastic killer and survivor he streams and has guides and critiques people's gameplay. Otzdrava   is also great as he always shares what he is going to do and has guides also on his YouTube. For pure enjoyment watch Puppers as he just plays good and has a chill time with his audience.
---
I mean the silver themed outfits like we saw in the posters for the aniversarry. Clown, spirit, Legion (mostly Legion), the PLAG dude, and this.
---
It‚Äôs sad how all of this is true
---
Interesting build, I didn't know Mad Grit was a common perk, I might look into that as well, thanks!
---
Who would the Killer be? Scrappy? Old Man McDuckett?
---
Git gud
---
I don‚Äôt know if Evil Dead is a unknown or underrated franchise. 
---
That sounds wrong, but of course I could be wrong.
---
Mad grit is a legion only perk. Since it was a legion build was thikimg you cold use it.
---
Amanda &lt;3
---
No0b3 monto And Truetalent If you don‚Äôt mind the ranting
---
 Killer speed, hiding red glove u have to guess which side he is coming or leave the pallet, if u want to understand this there‚Äôs 2 options play as killer or look at players like Tru3tal3nt(may have misspelled) he is a educational channel, I play as killer and see him as entertainment. TBH the short side is in the killer‚Äôs side.
---
Ikkkk
---
Give painkiller a try he has a relaxed tone wmd really breaks down the gameplay well.
---
Ok I'll check them out
---
Ohhh! Silly me, I didn't realize ü§£ I see people focus on Discordance and Iron Maiden more and I overlooked the other perk.
---
Another build - discordance, nurses calling, whispers, bbq
---
Good all around build
---
what a fucking great game
---
Evil dead is actually a pretty underrated franchise alot of people don't know about the evil dead movies plus you have to think alot of people that play DBD are generally young and not very old and grew up with the more well known movies(atleast from what I seen) so when people see Ash they probably have no clue what he is from.
---
Lots of the different providers have different routing to get to a particular place, so it's possible. You may also try finding a local VPN and connecting through that and see if it helps.  If you can find one that bell connects to well, then it should bypass any routing issues to dbd servers if that is the issue.
---
Yes it is
---
He‚Äôd probably just start killing her more violently
---
I agree. They should make it so that you need to be on death hook for someone to be Mori‚Äôd
---
This is fantastic, and it's unironically a really cool killer mechanic!

Your rework makes proxy camping and tunneling off hook literally the only way to use the perk. You can‚Äôt hit anyone else....so once you hit the obsession twice hook them...why the hell would you leave the hook area? You‚Äôre just going to try to bait an unhook by proxy camping. I‚Äôm just telling you this is completely the opposite of what the devs are going for now. Sorry but it‚Äôs not good...at all.
---
Well then play survivor, don't be toxic, and be the change you want to see the in the world
---
Either the pig or freddy kreuger
---
Any reasoning?
---
Don‚Äôt quote me or anything, but I‚Äôve heard from a few people that he will be releasing June 23rd. That sounds about right to me, but that isn‚Äôt 100% confirmed. I‚Äôm sure that will include Bill on console as well and a patch.
---
I did actually want to use this build blood webs hate me. I can only get Whispers Lv1 and then it takes ages to find Whispers again ):
---
More like DS, your team mates are the zombies trying to farm you.
---
That would be awesome if that were correct!!
---
You kinda have to deal with that as killer, just like survivors have to deal with disconnects, camping, farming, etc. Both sides have their issues and you just need to learn to play through it like everyone else
---
They never said they were doing that to all the maps. I honestly think you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
\&gt;i was playing on live servers
---
\&gt;public test build
---
i had the same experience, i had to leave a game when i was playing killer because someone was at my door so of course i had to dc, so i came back after i answered which took about 10 mins( i play on xbox btw) but after i came back i had 2 messages on my xbox and the 1st said that i was a punk for dc'ing the 2nd one said ez, but i just ignored it, i also had a game where I was playing my main killer bubba and i slaughtered all of the survivors and one guy messaged me telling me to use a killer that takes more skill, so yeah survivors can be very toxic
---
The pig can put a trap on the person's head when they are in the dying state. They are really good perks for freddy kreuger that make him op, for example he has a add on/perk that can make fake  pallets. He can also teleport to gens.
---
So is this sub being brigaded or something? Why are stonetoss comics being posted and upvoted on an almost daily basis? Why are the moderators not taking action?
---
Damn Laurie Strode, always tempting Christian boys
---
That's some really nice artwork.
---
I can see that too
---
I‚Äôm fairly new but i have a few teachables. Mostly survivor teachables though cause i didn‚Äôt get BBQ from the Shrine like a moron and instead got Ace In The Hole.
---
I had a similar experience a couple of months ago except the last survivor kept jumping into a locker until endgame killed him.
---
The Myers Adept can be tedious, just don‚Äôt give up on it. It took me a few tries, it just takes the right game.
---
what if it's cyclical? neither side likes losing, so one chooses OP shit, the other BMs to piss them off (what else can they do...)
---
This is why I will never get to rank 1 (not to mention I‚Äôm trash at the survivor lol)
---
It depends. 
---
As survivor, I cant tell you the amount of times I've been face camped or farmed.
---
However, I cant tell you the amount of times I've been t-bagged as killer though. 
---
I dont really care either way, since I've given up on caring about winning or losing in this game. However, I dont mind the T-Bagging especially as killer for two reasons. 
---
1.) I tend to 3 or 4k most games, so it ends up not working out for them anyways 
---
2.) I play ghostface, so once I down them, I just T-bag them back.
---
This guy knows r/CODzombies
---
It's generally the same. Killer still get genrushed and Nurse,hillbilly and Spirit are the only ones that are greag at rank one. Nothing has really changed besides self care sucking now and DS only activates against tunnelers. hatches can be closed now and Survivors can open the exit gate when it is closed but they are on 2-3 minute timer until they either leave or die.
---
For some reason this makes me want to fuck Wraith. Weird.
---
How the fuck do two people die from a 99% door? Either they played terribly or they don‚Äôt know that it takes barely a second to open a 99% door.
---
If you like waiting 20 min for lobby...
---
*Jeff*
---
Should be Quentin
---
That‚Äôs why ps4 is the bottom of the barrel
---
In 1 or 2 weeks is when the PTB stuff comes to live survivors with a few tweaks to the stuff obviously
---
That was my first reaction to fucking it up this bad, "This looks like an N64 game"
---
Tell me about it!
---
This literally just needs the hanna barbera sound effects and soundtrack and its perfect xD
---
I‚Äôd say SOON‚Ñ¢Ô∏è but I hear it‚Äôs actually July 23rd don‚Äôt quote me on that and take it with a grain of salt
---
Is there any other kind of Farquad?
---
I feel awful because I gen rushed a wraith and we were always doing gens together, didn‚Äôt even get one hook and couldn‚Äôt find anyone. Tried to give him advise as a rank 1 wraith main.
---
Scrappy would be lowkey broken due to his height

Whatever his views are, i still find this comic funny. Sorry he‚Äôs that way i guess?

I recently bought it. I'm enjoying it a lot! It's a bit confusing at first to work with everything but the game is very fun.
---
I don‚Äôt know? I don‚Äôt watch jojo
---
lol imagine complaining about bt
---
Thats a feels bad man. I beleice that was the first time BBQ was EVER on the shrine and it came out about 2 years ago. At this rate just buy it. I also kind of forgot about that when I was talking about legion perks. I would put that int here somewhere because the bloodpoint bonus is just too good to pass up.
---
Yea yea, Camping on the basement and them crying on postgame cause you got genrush.
---
I think its 100% worth, even if u dont have friends who play its still fun. U should probably wait for a sale tho because there are many DLCs that are really tempting.
---
^^
---
Yeah it doesny really work out for em. If theyre trying to just waste my time ill leave em. But once i do hook em, they just leave. And thats what annoys me.
---
Does it smell and tastes like rotten fish?
---
no
---
Unfortunately, this means that hexes like Huntress Lullaby are going to get even less play than they already do. Not to mention the fact that would damage the role that hexes like Thrill of the Hunt and Haunted Grounds are meant to fill.

Can't tell if you're serious or not but look at the flair
---
I see that it‚Äôs a shitpost, but you listed a lot of actual toxic behaviors, so I am inclined to believe that you actually think bt is toxic
---
Should be able to.do it whenever I want, tbh.
---
There's just not enough people playing. How many people does PC average? 20K? Console I would guess maybe double. That's just not enough people to bother making a whole new game mode, imo.
---
That's because there's 4 survivors per match and only 1 killer per match. It's statistics
---
Survivors that expect to be saved 5 seconds after getting hooked are the same ones who whinge about the killer camping.
---
I really hope he didn‚Äôt go into the N‚Äôs
---
Not even P1 git gud noob. Nah in all seriousness very well cosplayed!
---
Ok, I‚Äôm probably dumb but what does BHVR stand for?
---
true especially for the skillcheck,
---
One word: oink. 
---
You can't go wrong with Amanda. Trap deaths hardly happen depending on your rank, but it keeps Survivors busy and off gens once they're activated. You can use her crouching ability to mindgame Survivors at loops. When you dash, you can fake one way and go another. For me, it almost always ends up in a hit.
---
But I might be biased.
---
Or Myers. Myers is fun too. But I have less to say about him.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it might be because  of messages I‚Äôve had about 300 for quite a bit and it feels way smoother after deleting all of them
---
No it has to the dbd ratatouille it would explain how he plays so well.
---
you gotta put the scent of rotting flesh into account

Yes yes yes. It‚Äôs so good nice job!!
---
Survivor: "Why did you camp?"

Me: "Your teammate followed me to hook, literally ran me around you, and you killed yourself on your first hook..."

Survivor: "Reported"

*you got me on the first half not gonna lie*
---
once every 10 matches always the first person to die
---
With a smile like that, getting Mori'd by her doesn't seem so bad now
---
Scrappy was like a deathclaw at the end of the first live action movie. They could use that.
---
Mad Grit?
---
this is how I got adept freddy. OP speaks the truth!
---
So I run a build like this I like to call the "I love you" build but you bring play with your food along with rancor. Find your obsession get your stacks and then make friends with them. Then when gates are powered betray the trust as hard as possible and Mori the heck out of them. Gets some very interesting msgs over psn.
---
I‚Äôm debating between Myers and Amanda. I can‚Äôt choose which one I want. I‚Äôm not the best stealthy killer so I‚Äôll probably go Myers. Idk tho.
---
Otzdarva tru3talent noob3 and monto are my go to but Paulie Esther and hybrid panda are good for your news in the game
---
I‚Äôm debating between him and Amanda and I can‚Äôt choose which one I want.
---
That's how difficult she is if you use only her 3 base perks. If you run different perks on her she won't be nearly as difficult.
---
I‚Äôm a nicknamed myself lol
---
Myers is definitely more stealth than Amanda. Imo she's the more fun to play. If you have to, roll a die.
---
&gt;generally young and not very old
---
LOL amazing

The 23rd.
---
This is the best most accurate response.
---
Shit I‚Äôm not home
---
This just happened to me, I had a Feng with the trap on as I shut the hatch. The last gen wasn‚Äôt powered, she opened the door and ran out.
---
Sloppy Butcher is in no way better than Ruin. Like at all. Besides, the point of Ruin is just to slow down the first couple of minutes, so survivors can't spawn together all hope on a gen and complete it before you can walk to the other side of the map. Sloppy Butcher is still a great perk, it does slow the game down, it makes tracking easier and it makes survivors less likely to heal, but the reason why Ruin is used in almost every build is because it is unmatched in what it does, which is heavy map wide pressure that is active at the very start of the game.
---
If they lead you to a pallet that is on the other side of a short hazard like a tree log or short wall and the pallet has two directions (left or right only), zap them before you choose a side
---
You can‚Äôt perform actions when zapped by doctor, your character gets stuck screaming. This lasts long enough to switch right after the zap activates to hit them. Works well to counter pallets, even if one is already down.
---
Yea, a move speed buff would never happen. That's 8% extra movement right there, that's stronger than Bloodlust 3.
---
Frank pointing to Julie and Joey, Julie pointing to Frank and Susie, Joey pointing to Susie and Frank/Julie, and Susie pointing to Julie and Joey
---
100% agreed. I have zero idea as to why this is even in the game itself. If the killer DC's, the killer should be punished for it only. Everyone else should either safety pip [if it's in the beginning] or pip [if it's late into the game], but the killer should always de-pip
---
Try ranks 20-10.
---
I had a game last night where we had 1 gen left and 2 of us still alive, I unhooked my Claudette and healed her, we walked with her each other for a moment before we found hatch, we just looked at each other, I was gonna go check for a chest to hopefully find a key and get us both out, before I had a chance she dropped her flashlight, pointed and tbagged at me and then DCed, happened right as the Freddy was putting me to sleep grabbed the light and hopped into hatch. Not all Claudette‚Äôs are bad, just most. (I don‚Äôt endorse the DC but it was a tender moment)
---
Killer, the Ogre
---
Terror radius 10 meters, An instrumental version of all star plays faintly plays when the Ogre is within 32 meters of a survivor
---
Move speed 115%
---
Melee attack, A punch with one of his meaty ogre fists
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Power: The Roar
---
After a second long channel (During which the Ogre moves at 100% speed as he deeply inhales) the Ogre let's out a mighty roar, afflicting anyone within his terror radius with Deafened for 30 seconds, and causing them to scream, revealing their position to the Ogre and being unable to perform any actions for one second.
---
Deafened: All in game audio is muffled and almost silent. You cannot hear the killers terror radius, and skill checks have no audible warning.
---
Perks:
---
Monster, Your mere presence and brute strength fill survivors with fear
---
Whenever you break a pallet or damage a generator all survivors within 16/24/32 meters are deafened for 10/15/20 seconds and scream, revealing their position. 
---
"This is the part where you run away" - -The Ogre
---
Hex Onion
---
Your traps are like onions, with constantly unfolding layers 
---
One trapped hex totem will spawn in the trial, if cleansed by a survivor they will sceam, revealing their position, and be deafened for 15 seconds. 
---
After Hex Onion has been cleansed it will trap another dull totem, increasing the duration of the deafening by 15 seconds this time. 
---
Hex Onion can be transfered up to 0/1/2 times per trial, unless there are no dull totems left upon which it will stop transferring. 
---
"Onions have layers. Ogers have layers... You get it?" -The Ogre 
---
&amp;nbsp
---
All Star (Credit to) 
---
You know how to make a grand entrance, making your presence known to all in the area. 
---
You may hold down the interact key on a locker to get inside of it. While inside a locker your terror radius and red stain are suppressed, and if a survivor gets in the same locker as you they are automatically grabbed and put into the dying state, and you leave the locker. 
---
After hiding in the locker for at least 3/2/1 you may attack to burst out of the locker, rendering it unusable for the rest of the trial, along with damaging and exhausting anyone in front of the locker. 
---
After entering a locker All Star goes on cooldown for 90/75/60 seconds. 
---

Fairly new/still learning, looking for like minded/non-toxic players to group up with in SWF and KWF.  Family man with job, so can‚Äôt game most weekdays. Free most weekends though. Just looking to have fun playing the game with friends.  Thanks and have a great day!
---
I think rank reset was today for all platforms so honestly this week is probably gonna be more toxic than usual. I'm planning on playing survivor until ranks get balanced out and not as toxic but if you plan on playing killer this week best to just ignore people like that.
---
Oh jeez oh no Adam don't get on that train
---
Every month, each players killer and survivor rank resets. If you are above rank 15 as either survivor or killer your rank resets to 20 but if you make it to 15 or lower rank reset only effects you up to rank 15. I can't remember how many "levels" you lose each reset. Idk why but that's the way it is.
---
Well, He is. Newsflash, not everyone actually BMs. And it is not just survivors that do it too. But that is not reddits desired target of today so lets all get on a bandwagon and bash any survivor on sight for alleged toxicity.
---
Don't worry brother. That's just Survivor main things. If they all win, there are no problems the game Is balanced and "ez" at the end of the match, if they lose, it's not their fault, bit it's because the killer played bad. This mentality sucks Just ignore those asshole Who can't even enjoy the game, they can only complain, that's all they're able to do, Just because in the end they know they have 0 skill

I like Tru3 since I discovered him with For Honor, but he does complain a lot and is a bit condescending. He is very good at the game though.
---
There's already a swamp in the game, they just need to make Shrek now and then everything will be perfect! I can't wait to hear a distorted version of All Star in the background as I'm repairing generators in a rundown shack.
---
Claudette is just "I fucking see you, bitch"
---
Poor Micheal...
---
Some survivors are 'harder' because their starter perks give them less of a chance to escape. Meg, for example, is designed as an 'easy' survivor because her perks are excellent for survival. Sprint Burst is one of the most highly used perks in red ranks [ranks 1 - 4], same thing with Adrenaline. She has both, hence her 'easy' ranking.
---
However, every survivor's perks become teachable to all other survivors after level 30. This means that, you can get Adrenaline and Sprint Burst from other survivors so long as you keep leveling Meg. 
---
There are no differences other than that. Males don't run faster and females don't vault faster. Only difference is the perks they start with.
---
I was thinking the same. Only survivors should be able to, otherwise it's unfair. Pleases nerf!
---
Wtf
---
She‚Äôs gay
---
To enjoy while at the same time trying my best.
---
I always try to improve my looping skills and to hit Great Skill checks to ignore a Ruin Totem
---
Just wait until they find out about the Tombstone.
---
Ok...
---
So no explanation then thanks.
---
Yep. Safety pip at a minimum
---
I have some experience on this game and i think you're right
---
Oh yes I've done that before, DC so that somebody else could take the hatch. I got shit on for it by the killer of course but the Nea appreciated it. I was also a Claudette.
---
Try contacting Support.
---
They will help you
---
You don‚Äôt de-pip for when a killer Dc‚Äôs. It shows a de-pip in the match results, yes. But if you look at your actual pips on your rank after returning to the main screen, you will still have the same amount of pips resulting in a safety pip.
---
finally, a killer stronger than the entity
---
I'm very upset that we don't get a groovy whenever he finishes a gen.
---
Thanks.
---
#WHAT NOW?
---
The Creeper, the Phantom Shadow(s), and the Space Kook seem like good candidates.
---
I am spook
---
But flashlights are a liability. At least, that's what a ton of people on the official forums are yelling at me for pointing out blinds are unavoidable while breaking pallets.
---
And at the very least, you CAN stab players blocking.
---
I wish you could get a title at the end of a match as a survivor depending on the pips you get, not just "Sacrificed" or "Escaped", I mean like "Determined Survivor" and "Hopeful Survivor" when you get a Double Pip or Single Pip or "Nervous Survivor" and "Entity Pleased" when you get a Safety Pip or lose a Pip. The killer gets Brutal, Ruthless and Merciless when they do well and Entity Displeased when you don't so I believe survivors deserve it as well.
---
See it's weird because if your toxic it's the worst thing, in the world, but if you're not toxic, it's also the worst thing in the world.
---
Are Quentins really that rare? 
---
Maybe it's because I'm a Quentin Main, but I feel like I see a lot more Sleepy Bois than I do Police Bois.

It's tough, I mean, maybe Sam Raimi could convince him to as it looks like he's going to direct if there's another one in the works. But if he couldn't then I'd understand, it's a hard part to play.
---
Oh le no my butt has been bit by shark with Jaws
---
This hurts me. It do be like that
---
Hah! Perks that increase movment speed are usually come with a rather big drawback.
---
NOED - Can be destroyed
---
Play with your Food - Needs stacks,you have to let someone escape,you lose stacks on offensive actions
---
As you can see they are NOT permanent and you can kinda work around them.
---
Same with Bloodlust,if the Killer starts stacking them,chases quickly end unless you can stun him or make him break a pallet.
---
In short, Permanent increases in Movement speed is way to strong,even if its a small bit.
---
Just watch the difference between looping a 115% MS killer versus a 110% MS Killer. Its HUGE
---
5 mostly.
---
I was in a random SWF group last night and some fivehead wouldn't shut up because I said I rather have an interesting game and potentially lose than stomp killers.  Then he started crying "sO yOu rAtHeR NoT sToMp HuH?!" when we lost because he was a fivehead.

You mean the bug where you get an Error at the end screen and you get kicked out of the score screen etc?
---
Ash has beaten Krueger (although the game doesn't show it) who in terms of power, is by far the strongest killer in the game (once again in lore, not actual gameplay).
---
Did you burn the item out?

*Mission* ***accomplished***
---
That‚Äôs true, I just like it and think it might be a bit underrated

That's absolutely fair though. Nancy was terrible in the remake lmao.

It's the same bug as the one in this post. It used to be a pip update error message but then they changed it to what you see here.

I'm a Jellyfish, what brain
---
This disturbs me 
---
  
---
A lot
---
People have wanted them to get cosmetics for a long time. But BHVR has always seemed reluctant to do so, guess they just finally started to listen.
---
Idk. Its an ok perk imo.
---
Well, i know a friend had that Issue and he didnt get banned for that.
---
So yeah something is obviously fishy here.
---
Pretty sure this is a repost, but still hilarious.
---
This is some NSFW Content...Epic
---
Tombstone?
---
To earn as many points as possible, and preferably, escape.
---
And I quote
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"LET'S GO LESBIANS!"
---
Do you know how often he plays DBD?
---
Cthulhu huntress ALL DAY LONG
---
Oh yeah, it's a repost. Just sharing stuff I find funny since I didn't find this on Reddit
---
I just visit the Sub Reddit, What have I Done...
---
Can you imagine just standing near a locker and then ‚ÄúsomeBODY ONCE TOLD ME‚Äù
---
2 and 6. Im just here to rank up and escape what how that happens varies.
---
I don‚Äôt blame her. It was a valiant effort.
---
I wish I could run into reasonable and thoughtful people like you in this game.
---
Looks real good, I can already feel that face staring into my soul without a terror radius in the basement.
---
Are u playing on ps4? üòÇ
---
Nice job
---
H
---
Well, leatherface was a standalone killer.  One can never be sure what issues were run into with licensing, likenesses, etc.
---
I'll stop you when I see the lie.
---
Crying about downvotes? That‚Äôs a downvote.
---
how so? everyone loses 10 ranks, so you're up against the same level survivors/killers you were before, they dropped back just as far.
---
Hey, at least it‚Äôs his Lv30 teachable. I actually grinded for it the other day, just so I could get it on my P3 Legion. Been maining him since he dropped, even after the nerfs, and it‚Äôs just such a good thing to have on him. People seem to like to bait his Frenzy and drop a pallet at the right second, so you‚Äôll get a ton of free hits running it with Spirit Fury. Run Iridescent Button for easy Spirit Fury procs, and go to pound town.
---
Well the least support could do for me is actually check when in the game I disconnect. If they were to do that they'd see that it's because of the bug and not due to me quitting out.
---
I quit out of games here and there but honestly it's maybe like 1-3 games a week that I quit out of.
---
I trust you,but i wonder how i could help you...
---
You're doing the Entity's work, friend.
---
I‚Äôm not saying you are bad. I hope you didn‚Äôt read what I said wrong. 
---
Not opening the gates is just pointless, there is a lot more benefits to opening than there is not. The problems you described are ones than can be fixed getting better at chases.
---
Motherfucker, better keep away from my chests
---
Feature for short killers in the future; The Entity feels so bad for them that the hooks lean down when the killers try to hook them.
---
Now there's hope for both Chucky *and* Scrappy.
---
Only problem is that it's only enough for 3 kills, and you have to do them all in one evil within 3 state.
---
afaik, BHVR could not add any other cosmetics to licensed characters for a while because they didn‚Äôt own the rights to them. But by negotiating with the people who did, they were allowed to add cosmetics to the characters from Saw.
---
The Ghostface in this game is also considered to be an original character of BHVR‚Äôs aside from the title and mask, so he gets to have at least some cosmetics too.
---
Ach on steam.
---
Yep I did the exact same so that way I don‚Äôt go dead every time I have to struggle.
---
You already ended his career then you went and slid on him
---
This is an Expanded Dong (Feature Length!).  You make me proud, OP.
---
I‚Äôve noticed this on PS4. It was so bad one round that it felt like cheating and I haven‚Äôt played killer since.
---
They did NOT say each realm would be getting 4 additional variations, like OP claims.
---
1. He‚Äôs only available to play on swamp maps.
---
2. Instead of a heartbeat terror radius, it‚Äôs feet stomping.
---
3. Whenever he hits a survivor, he yells ‚ÄúGET Out MY SWAMP‚Äù (can be heard vividly from distance).
---
4. Donkey is wondering the map frantically explaining to survivors non stop how his friend Shrek has gone bad, revealing location of survivors.
---
Legion looks cool doe
---
It looks like something from early second life.
---
You do all the chores? Oh hell yeah
---
https://www.partitionwizard.com/partitionmanager/steam-disk-write-error.html 
---
May be relevant.
---
Ughhhh, I HATE FISH!
---
Last time i tried to help a killer like that, I was told to be fuck off. :(
---
Play hard to find out you just killed some noobs with 1-2 perks each. Relax next game to make it more fair and get blinded constantly and gen-rushed. It sucks but bring your A-game regardless and its not so bad
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just funny cause I got the game recently and wanted to start playing killer so today is the day I decided to start lol.
---
What in the funky fresh hell is that and can it PLEASE stay as far as possible from me?
---
Don't think there's any way you can :(. I just wanted to see if this was the case for anyone else.
---
My ban is temporary so even though it sucks I can at least play again, but even after my ban is lifted I will still probably have this bug that makes the game unfun to play. There's only so much enjoyment you can get out of beating new players.
---
True. The guilt can definitely get to you and make you want to stop playing ( I am playing on PS4 as well). I don‚Äôt want this to become a thing.
---
But is it safe from bullets
---
I havent played a lot of killer, less than  20 hours total, so my experience is limited, but I've found huntress to be my absolute favorite. Im trying not to be a jerk and camp players and such so i try to go for a win that involves not using the hooks at all. Its so satisfying landing a crazy axe throw
---
Where is the teabag option?
---
Yes.  Watch twitch streams, youtube and ask any questions you have here.  
---
Freddy, Leatherface, Pig w/ reverse bear traps (Saw), Ash (Evil Dead), Ghostface, Bill (Left 4 Dead).
---
Or some other ‚Äúhook‚Äù feature
---
Scrappy-Doo has been found dead in Miami
---
awwwww' shes so cute
---
When you wear it some place try doing his dorky bubba jog lol
---
I haven't had a single fucking huntress without iri heads. Testicular torsion surgery was a more enjoyable and fun experience from being wheeled into the operating room with 15/10 agonizing pain to limping around my house for 4 months. 
---
Survivor gameplay I've been tombstoned 5 times, (One of which had a 3man SWF feed him to tier 3 and all DC leaving me to get tombstoned about 2 minutes into the match) encountered 8 Iri Head huntresses. Insta-Saw Ebony Billy, and my entire team calls me trash like jesus fucking christ sorry I'm a potato and don't live up to your Seal Team Six perfectionist fucking standards!
---
As Killer? Nothing but instas, BNPs, etc. I've had a Mori daily for Legion, went through 5 Ivory Mori's and couldn't do it because survivors DC like whiny bitches to screw me out of my Mori.
---
Sorry for ranting but jesus fucking christ is high ranks nothing but "YOUR BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD. YOU DIDN'T DO A SINGLE GEN AND COULDN'T LOOP THE KILLER WORTH SHIT" "LMAO GG EZ GET REKT BABY KILLER" or is this just a side effect of everyone being fired up for rank reset?
---
But why?
---
As stupid as it may sound, have you tried reinstaling, or try to verify the files via steam?
---
Because why the fuck not?

Nope, pc.  Apparently I should switch :p
---
I‚Äôd pay for this
---
"Just differing opinions" is one way to say he's a holocaust denier that believes black people are subhuman.
---
If you managed to get corner trapped by the killer during endgame it‚Äôs probably your own fault, just sayin
---
#oink
---
What art?
---
Unpopular opinion: camping is a good strategy if you‚Äôre a killer. If you‚Äôre a survivor, try to get ONE person to get them, and go away and do a generator, don‚Äôt risk the entire team‚Äôs chances
---
Just some noob survivors who get carried every game
---
How dare you not letting that Wraith hit you after 10 seconds of chasing!!
---
Because apparently m1ing takes more skill than the chainsaw. Makes sense.
---
I AM SPEEEEEDD
---
Btw what does baby "inserit survivor here" mean?
---
This works well vs SWF on the last couple gens as they have the Hero mentality and all fall down
---
Not how it works at all my dude.
---
There is more to the conversation, he said ‚Äúat least I don‚Äôt one shot for my kills‚Äù
---
Sometimes it actually takes a pip. not just visually , even after restarting the game it was still gone.
---
Facts
---
It‚Äôs disappointing to see, and that‚Äôs coming from a Killer main..
---
Feel the same exact thing. Was a killer main fully but instantly after Ghostface came out everyone just started to get really tryhardy and toxic(not saying killers aren't toxic also just less so in my experience).  Im now a survivor main and I'm having a blast however I still play killer every once in awhile if I need bloodpoints or I feel like I'm bored of survivor. Sucks that people can't just have fun and fool around instead of just doing the objective and being immersed 24/7(not saying survivors should just stand still but just get into chases and mess around)
---
Yes, when I‚Äôm not playing dbd I‚Äôm watching monto play dbd
---
Oh, heavens forbid this man for using the killer's ability! Such toxicity!
---
If you threw down a pallet he was on, would he get stunned or stay on top of the pallet
---
I got told I was trash without those addons and I was lucky I had them. Even though I chose to bring them. And I only played the way I did cus I could teleport anything and they would never know where a trap was.
---
in the green ranks yes. everything below (or above i suppose) is just a literal mess.
---
Everyone is a salty noob survivor?
---
Accidentally dead hard into a hay bale.
---
Good times.
---
So you're fine with supporting and giving free advertisement to a known Holocaust denier and someone who pushes anti-Jewish propaganda using these comics? Are your dogshit memes really that important to you? Is your life so bereft that you really needed the 106 upvotes for this?
---
Same level as ‚Äúyou were supposed to give me hatch since I was the last survivor!‚Äù
---
Both sides suck equally some one is either messing around not even trying while people are trying to win  or everyone is just sweating so damn much while you're just messing around and trying to have fun.
---
"well he may be a racist anti-semite who denies the reality of the Jewish Holocaust but basically I like his memes and my tiny amount of upvotes enough that I'll just ignore that"
---
No, just that guy
---
Don't post Stonetoss comics he's a fucking racist and you're a god damn retard if you spread his bullshit propaganda for him for free
---
You watch him when he streams and he seems to delight in it.
---
Looks like a damn piece of pepperoni pizza
---
I love how you guys downvoted me because I asked a question sarcastically üòÇüòÇ
---
Today at the temple place in the Red Forrest, all of us were running through the difference entrances of the central building and we kept coming out in different directions at different times. The killer was pretty confused I'm sure.q
---
Seems like BHVR is making throwable pallets
---
Rip, happened to me on a different thread earlier
---
Same, and Tofu and Tru3 for me aswell
---
Why I switched to killer. Solo survivor is too brutal and lonesome.
---
Clearly reading is very difficult LUL
---
It's so bad. One person I encounter on Xbox at times is always so salty towards me when I play Doctor. Tells me I'm cheating by using a character such as that. The Doctor isn't even the best killer in the game. Mid-tier.
---
Haha it's funny because it's a slur lol epic mayms
---
But that‚Äôs the killers special move. What?! Lmao, sigh. These type of players are real sore losers. Imagine, it‚Äôs something in real life, don‚Äôt play board games with him.
---
Fr, he wants me to play no power Freddy lmao
---
Nasty and Filthy blades for Legion would increase time survivors need to spend mending, there was a bug where the time would increase for every deep cut, rather than just once. So pretty awful to play against, especially vs old Legion
---
nea is the best
---
New DBD Inside out parody looking cool
---
Glad you like it!
---
Unfortunately not a game rip, but I want to live in the timeline where BHVR can get the rights to Shrek
---
Facts. I love when people say the someone is bad after they got beat by a mid to low tier killer
---
Im guessing you watch Tru3 Ta1ent.
---
Oh definitely. I really enjoy playing as her with the right perks as well. Hex: Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel, Thrilling Tremours and Corrupt Intervention has helped me get two-three hooks early in the game.
---
Posting racist comments in r/MGTOW and linking Stonetoss comics and unironically defending it by saying "it's just different views". This person is fucking clown shoes
---
Tbh I can‚Äôt watch Tru, just don‚Äôt like him much, but Farmer John And No0b3 are the shit
---
flair does not check out, mr boyfriend
---
true , happened to me and I disconnected for something irl
---
Early game has to have so much pressure, if not then it‚Äôll be a 5-10 minute game
---
I‚Äôm a rank 6 on both sides but I prefer survivor, I generally play clown or ghostface when I do play killer. But the one time I tried Freddy they gen rushed me within 6 minutes and were out
---
Yeah but I do see a decent amount of Bitter Murmur (kind of a low level / casual player) so right now I'm just fed up with BBQ and hate how much it slows me down when I'm trying to knock out early gens so I'm running Distortion to let me friends know the killer for sure has it and so I don't have to keep jumping in lockers.
---
Jokes on you i don‚Äôt have a pc, xbox, or ps4. I‚Äôm waiting for the switch version ti be good. /s
---
*yeets right into Spirit Fury*
---
I was rank 2 and got reset to 11 and I‚Äôve never been more mad while playing the game so from the position of a high rank fuck this rank reset
---
He saw the Tea Bag and had to nope out of that match.
---
The face could have been rendered better but it doesn‚Äôt look bad. Kinda meh for me but if you like it it‚Äôs your choice.
---
Enable BP gain in tutorial plis
---
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt run devour Hope myself with an insta down killer, when you could easily run something else more beneficial. You could run a mori for the killing portion of devour hope. But to answer the original question no I don‚Äôt think so
---
Accidentally BL into a dropped pallet.
---
BM isn't that common at higher ranks tho so it isn't a problem, my common strategy to counter bbq n chilli is as simple as doing one action for 4 seconds ( such as running in a direction completely opposite to what I'm doing ) then come back after those 4 seconds are up. A lot of killers like to plan on cutting survivors off when they see them running.
---
Jokes on you I don't have enough money to buy DBD
---
Yah I picked it up about 3-4 weeks ago
---
Yah exactly wtf
---
It kinda looks like something you'd see out of a Phoenix Wright game.
---
Jokes on you i don‚Äôt have money. Period.
---
The whole ‚Äúdeafness‚Äù mechanic is really innovative, in the same way that Obsessions are. Vigil could reduce deafness times as well. I want to see it in-game.
---
***HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MAN*** 
---
*Yeets another pallet, but miss*
---
Ok ty will try
---
Yeah just what we need, more swamp maps. Ugh
---
Well it kinda is.
---
Red Ranks are reset to 10 and 11 and for the first few hours will be the only ones or at least the majority of players inhabiting those ranks. Meaning, you are literally facing the same people for the first few hours you were facing before.
---
Granted, only if the matchmaking would not fuck itself over half of the time.
---
he's very big and loud. even uninjured his breathing is so loud a Huntress can hear it within 40 meters as it seems. 
---
and somehow, no idea why, even after MoM nerf i get tunneled as Ash constantly every game no exception (red ranks). i've played him a lot alongside with Jeff (cause he also huge and loud) but only Ash gets much killer hate :c 
---
i'm actually killer main and only ones i tunnel are blendettes (don't confuse with Claudettes) with obvious reasons of deep personal hatred of never having a blendette as a viable team member. but Ash is fine and wasn't out for a long time to have this much hate :c blendettes were trash since very time they've made her black.
---
This is the type of killer i aspire to be. Nice to everyone unless they deserve it.
---
Cunt child, CRY
---
Bearded Jake is the most handsome of them all.
---
Any kind of aura reading perk on her is amazing as you can pounce on it quickly. 
---
Nurse's Calling (Amazing built in perk as a slap build is super effective)
---
Surveillance (Decent for those hard to see gens)
---
BBQ (God Perk, Must Have)
---
Ruin (Not really needed on her, but will give you more time to practice your blinks during games)
---
Discordance (It's alright, there's better perks)
---
Deerstalker (Team Slug)
---
Make your choice (Works great for Nurse as after one blink, she can go 40 meters away and then right back.)
---
The Hair and face is so bad in my opinion it just makes her look like a prostitute that walks up to from a back alley and ask if you got any Heroine.
---
On console Doc is high mid tier, on pc(from what i‚Äôve heard) doc is low mid tier to high low tier.
---
Wow isn't that kinda hateful and pretty judgemental for me disliking a head piece. Doesn't that sound hypocritical.
---
LOL getting downvoted by rank 20 survivors who think billy is op. Against strong survivors who barely make any mistakes billy is looped exactly like any other m1 killer. He punishes survivors for making mistakes but when they make none, he can‚Äôt chainsaw them in loops
---
LMAO, raptor Billy is now canon.
---
Yea some changes are kinda subtle and won't notice it until multiple months or weeks
---
Hey you're on the most controversial of all time post a list, grats!
---
If (generator &lt; 15 meters)
---
      then (spawn somewhere fucking else)
---
Guys I fixed the game
---
Recently got yelled at for using the yellow mori. You know, the one when THE GAME IS OVER.
---
No, she's gorgeous. Get fucked! =)
---
Wat
---
Imagine bringing a green key LUL
---
Well you know the guy is right. She looks like a junkie whore üíÅ
---
That last line got me.
---
Friendly tip, console players are so not used to playing Nurse that sometimes you can just walk at them and that cut back expecting the blink.
---
Oh dear, it seems you‚Äôve seen it

Its like that minigame in Spore where you dance and sing to befriend other creatures.
---
smh imagine liking a girl that hides and blends in instead of a self-confident thicc girl like Jane
---
This is me 100%! I could have the killer literally coming towards me and I will still be cleansing a totem.
---
That's the one I got yelled at for! He was the last guy and got mad. I also did kill him on top of the hatch sooooooo!
---
Why must you call yourself a slut for blood points
---
Daddy issues
---
I mean i main Meg but i don‚Äôt play her counterpart(whichever killer that would be since she isn‚Äôt dlc) i main Legion. Was gonna main Jeff but decided Meg was a better fit with her perks and i didn‚Äôt have to go unlock them just to play Jeff.
---
I can't tell if I'm getting trolled rn or you're being serious and don't realize you're being a hypocrite.
---
I mean, once you get your BBQ stacks you can get maaaannnny more points by continuing to play.
---
You don't automatically "win" the game by getting your 4 stacks, it doesn't take much effort to double your BPs even after your stacks.
---
If you stop playing after your stacks, you will get hardcore BM'd.
---
I love playing killer, but i also love endgame salt üòÇ
---
They both do different things. Depends on your build.
---
That‚Äôs really good! Nice job
---
Rarely. When I tell or show people my perk build they ask "why aren't you running adrenaline?" and that's because a good chunk oh my games don't even make it to the end
---
Well just put on a jockstrap(or dickstrap whatever they're called) and get ready to stick that bad boy into the abyss and see what grabs on to it(never thought I'd ever type that
---
Would you rather risk missing your chainsaw? Or guarantee a down using your m1?
---
I like the passive aggressiveness in you
---
That sounds fine but Keanu Reeves still needs to play the shark.
---
Depends. Are they in a chase?

---
F*** meaning Feng, of course.
---
I've always thought it'd be unrealistic to expect the Devs to try balancing a mode like this in that way. Too many changes.
---
I think the way to do it is pit the killers against each other, making it a 1v1v4. The killers would be able to hurt each other, fighting for hooks. Otherwise killers would be working together, which would make certain strategies like trapper 3 gens too powerful (this mode would need 6 gens I think). Plus having killers fight each other is way cooler.
---
Killers that hit another killer would stun them and knock them back, with progressively more stun until the fourth hit, which kills them for 1 minute, and gives the winner a speed buff until they're back. Hits would heal over time. Maybe survivors could go in the basement to resummon the other killer faster somehow.
---
It would force decisions. Do I down the survivor so they can't escape, or do I let him go to fight the incoming wraith? Imagine watching a killer chasing another killer, while you're working on a gen. It'd be like a Godzilla movie.
---
Man/woman/apache helicopter of culture
---
If you miss the chainsaw that much you shouldn‚Äôt be using that killer? All that running any insta down perks on chainsaw killers are crutches.
---
This community really sucks.
---
Absolutely love this! Wish it was real...how would that work with the women survivors though lol? Raises more questions than answers...
---
That‚Äôs your response?
---
Unrelated but I love your name
---
Do you mean to toxic survivors. He is saying toxic people ruin the game for both sides. It seems like you said in the title all red ranks are toxic
---
This should be a bingo card
---
Guess I don't know how it works for those below rank 1. Bummer for you then.
---
This was me coming back 2 weeks ago, and I'm honestly bored of it now. The only time anyone has escaped in the last 30+ games was me letting them take the hatch. I wish rank didn't go down every month, I know the game and all the maps way too well to be anything higher than purple ranks. The only time rank should go down is if you performed poorly and de-pip.
---
This could have been it, they seemed like they kept trying to glitch somewhere (randomly entering lockers/running into the walls of the map when I'm legion with obvious iron maiden)
---
r/dodgelore
---
Oh dear God, I hate playing against the doctor. My favorite is the hag.
---
Best killer to play Huntress. Least favorite killer to play against doctor, thereby shock is annoying
---
LMAOOO, nono, just in general/before they were captured.
---
I actually laughed at what you said lmao
---
prolly, same applies for jeff too
---
Conversation will turn into survivor item discussion, Then noed, then buffing weak killers, then noed again, then someone else will chime in and take a side, then its back to noed and how trash everyone is. Then we will evemtually just stop responding because it's been 3 days and we have accomplished nothing. Figured id defuse it early. Uh, goodluck in your future games.
---
Let them cope
---
Uh huh.
---
Oh I have noticed this sometimes yeah
---
NIGERUNDAYO
---
Well I now have proof that I'm correct. I submitted another ticket exclaiming the rank update error issue being related to disconnect bans and the same guy who looked at my first ticket about my ban instantly marked my ticket as "solved" despite not putting any sort of reply on the second one. They were in two completely different sections and I did not mention anything about wanting to be unbanned in that second ticket. I created it to just report the bug.
---
The pronunciation is Mith-ur
---
Is this not talking down to people when saying ‚Äú people like you?‚Äù Without the knowledge of my views on the subject? Only assuming you and your views are correct?
---
Its a good artstyle  ! I like it, but the teeth look odd, but that can just be me. I personally dont like the big black frame with shards around the eye, thats my personal taste, nothing against your art, still good !
---
The tar monster, captain cutlers ghost, the cotton candy glob
---
It sucks because for survivor adepts just require you to escape
---
what video game syste?
---
Do I make you feel small?
---
Trapper, Spirit and Nurse
---
Now that ranking up is that harder the monthly penalty should be way lower. You can‚Äôt get to red ranks until you spend a lot of time every month.
---
The Memes, not the MEMES ! Overloaded ! AHhhhhhhhhhhhh....
---
Source?
---
Apparently "mither" isn't actually a word.
---
Well the one i enjoy playing the most would be Wraith, but he isnt that good.
---
Surely there's a way to turn off messages from strangers on Xbox, right?
---
Sound like Mehther , meh-the-r
---
100% the truth right here brother
---
No your ignorance makes me laugh. You talk big but no substance. You try to put words in people‚Äôs mouth to make you feel better about yourself, you speak as if you know everyone‚Äôs opinions and views on something when in all reality you know nothing other than your sad existence of talking down to others to make yourself feel better.
---
Just google it. Bhvr didn't invent the word.
---
Hell yeah this is the good stuff in the back of the shop dude I'll have some üòé
---
Someone messaged me‚Äùyou‚Äôre so bad that you can only use your chainsaw?‚Äù and I‚Äôm like wtf, I guess so
---
One Shock and they all scatter like roaches, in red trainings clothing wearing roaches XD
---
Noob3, puppers and monto are my favorite
---
I'm one of those that likes to try and hook everyone twice and then have fun and meme and let everyone live who hasn't teabagged me at any point.  I've found that piggy with ruin allows me to do this most of the time.  I get a lot of nice messages from people saying they had a fun time and that just makes me smile. Oink

There it is lol.

Me as a survivor: "How did that hit me?" "NOED!?" "He has bbq and noed, what a nerd"
---
Me as a killer: "idk how that hit him but we take those" tbag after a pallet stun? Ok then." "Why is he tbaging, i just killed his friends"

I apologize but I don‚Äôt get Adam‚Äôs picture. Could someone explain it for me please?

Dunno why you bring the devs and their balance decision into the conversation. The main problem with it is different than the one true explains. Its actually the opposite, everyone is thirsty for some spicy new perks. The only perk (MoM) that managed to become meta was nerfed which was certainly needed but it ended up becoming useless and joining the several useless tools survivors have. If anything people bully the devs because they are afraid to give significant buffs (WoO, left behind come to mind). As for the people my point still stands, meta is there because of gameplay mechanics, if they don't change you are encouraged to just genrush and play spirit to win. Toxic people are irrelevant in that regard.
---
Instead of Small Game, I'd say level up Nea and get Urban Evasion if you wanna be sneaky. Or maybe Quick and Quiet from Meg? Idk, I'm a killer main trynna help a survivor out lol
---
Torch.
---
I appreciate the help, good thing I‚Äôve already started leveling up Nea lol, thanks
---
Is that what it is? You don't lose your item if you DC? I didn't know that. I always wondered why people would take the loss on BPs.
---
Unfortunately, stealth is not very reliable in this game from a survivor point of view because killers have so many perks for finding suvivors like bbq and chilli and whispers. The best thing to do is to start learning how to loop , how to use jungle gyms, how to juke etc.... There are tons of guides online to help you learn. A good perk build for that is Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time and a perk of your choice . If you really want to play stealthy,you should use distortion so the killer can't see your Aura with Barbeque and Chilli. I don't play stealthy but it usually doesn't work out for the people that try to in my lobby. Sorry if this wasn't very helpful. Good luck.
---
Are these all the german words u know? üòÇ It doesn't really make any sense üòÇ
---
Favorite player to play against for me is Myers. He‚Äôs the most thrilling. least favorite to play against is the spirit. That bitch annoying lol
---
I knew people who called Hag traps "hexes."
---
Makes for a lot of annoyance when you spend a minute looking for the "hex" that was right in front of where they were hooked.
---
Tru‚Äôs an absolute legend
---
It‚Äôs on game pass. You can get game pass for $1 right now. I‚Äôve been playing it for a month now and I‚Äôve been enjoying it lately. I especially enjoy receiving the salty tears from the survivors each match I play :)
---
Yeah, facecamping hurts alot, it takes 2 mins to die on a hook, and 80 sec for 1 survivor without boost to do a generator. So the time it takes to camp, survivors can do 3 gens, possibly even 4.
---
*BOOOOM*
---
Nein ich kenne mehr und viele, aber ich zerhack schon englisch, da dachte ich mir, ich versuchs mal mit deutsch !
---
Everything is helpful, thank you for your advice üòä
---
When was bbq in last?
---
That's good, though. 4 times as many people need to be playing survivor in theory. Killer needs to be the less attractive role. 
---
People dont play killer for BP, they play killer for fun. And as the old proverb goes, "Killer main, damaged brain."
---
The devs have avoided truly balancing the game due to the fear if community backlash.
---
And they are right to fear that backlash when it in fact happened multiple times already. In complaints, forum spam, or out right review bombing the game over changing a single perk or mechanic. So they tended to wait, and wait.
---
Leading to months or years of a broken meta that shouldn't have lasted for a few weeks at most.
---
I'd say drop Dark Sense but keep Small Game. Replace Dark Sense with something like Borrowed Time so you can help with the safe unhooks. Bond is another good one if you want to keep track of where your teammates are.
---
Sadly, only me and the Nea were smart enough to do that, Claudette got downed trying to p3 her way to the hook. Slugged until Meg died.
---
Thank you üòä
---
honestly it would work pretty decent but most of the time they'll heal up and crouch to get the item back one they realize your trick
---
Jesus Christ it's almost infuriating to see how often this happens to where this post gets made...and is 100% accurate. Solo surviving is just the worst lol.
---
pretty sure that person thought they got stuck on something invisible
---
Ikr took me like 2-3 solid weeks of like 4 hours+ a day just to get there and now I‚Äôm 8 fucking ranks back I hope they realize how detrimental that is to me and other players who don‚Äôt wanna play with brainless idiots. Though, I got to admit, playing killer is a lot of fun right now.
---
Despite us still getting a battle pass when the community had a resounding "NO" when they asked about adding one from a survey.
---
Because most of them do
---
I like Ruin, Discordance or Pop Goes the Weasel, Sloppy and Thanatophobia on him.  If they heal they're screwed and you can maintain heavy gen pressure.  If they don't heal they're screwed because you get to play with reduced repair speed No Mithers.  
---
Power wise it's basically find survivor tag them with frenzy, rotate camera immediately see if someone's nearby if so chase them down and apply frenzy, rinse and repeat.  If noone else is around at that point just stay on your last target cancel ability and down them.  
---
Just be super disciplined with your swings so you don't get knocked out of Frenzy ever.
---
As a Laurie Main she listen's to Chill "Jazz"
---
That hardly matters.
---
I enjoy playing Legion the most, and Legion is on the lower end on literally every Killer tier list.
---
Did the same and I'm much happier
---
In his bio he died protecting someone during a train wreck he was in
---
I'm loving all the Mao Mao meme posts for DBD
---
Been playing mostly survivor recently and if I ever see a killer facecamp I am okay with it as it gives myself or other logical survivors free time essentially finish generators which hurts the players campy behavior as they only get one or two people max.  Whenever I play killer I just hook and move onto the next victim unless I hear them/see them get unhooked immediately after to which I will focus the already hurt survivor.
---
Rare sass lol
---
tbh im not against it as certain maps with billy you'll almost never have a good chance to get a chainsaw down unless the survivor is dumb
---
1,000+ hours in this game and when I play survivor it's only as solo survivor (no friends). This is the most accurate thing I've ever seen
---
Something like this happened to me earlier. Earlier I had a game on the Myers map and the killer was Billy. And the Dwight got hooked and the killer was patrolling the hook in a way went to chase someone then turn around and the Dwight got mad and messaged me and called me a noob because I didn't unhook him even though the killer was patrolling the hook I didn't have borrowed time and I was injured.
---
And I had another game where we up against a ghost face and he always on me so I ended up dying without doing a single gen and the nea dies and says I'm bad luck because they died lol

The fuck parallel universe is this meme from?
---
I mean the survivors and killer working together to get blood points seems kinda weird to me idk
---
Facecamping is a playstyle for people that don't really understand the mechanics of the game very well.  It's kind of like a plan that is the absence of a plan.  Not to mention one that penalizes you in every facet of the game (Bloodpoints, Pip, and honestly fun (other than trolls, who actually enjoys standing in place staring at pixels for minutes at a time?  Go chase, apply gen pressure, do something other than just stand there lol. I promise you playing the game is sincerely more fun and rewarding.
---
I'm actually both types of people.
---
I never play nurse, and I‚Äôm a console player. On a random match that I happened to play nurse, I got an overaltriustic swf, and got adept. Hail mary
---
No thanks.
---
Just my opinion
---
I respect thy decision
---
*past, not passed
---
Watch YouTubers, I like Monto and Zubat.  You should definitely aim for higher ranks but just remember it'll be more important to learn the game than to escape or rank up. You should try to learn how to loop because it's the number one thing that will win you games. Just don't be afraid of the killer and keep playing and try to have fun
---
Also how tf did you reply so fast
---
Favorite:  Console Nurse.  9/10 times it‚Äôs super chill because no one plays Console Nurse and she has no idea what she is doing.  The 1/10 times I play someone good enough to overcome the limitations of the console and play nurse well I feel a fear so genuine and pure that it reminds me that this is ostensibly supposed to be a survival horror game.
---
Least Favorite:  Shape.  Playing against a shape is way more annoying than scary.  Catching sight of that lumbering doucheballoon and having to scamper off like frightened kitten as he slowly plods towards you isn‚Äôt fun, and the fact that he is the most basic bitch killer in the game without his add-ons means that you don‚Äôt have any fun outside the box thinking or strategies to play around, just break LoS until he gets bored of stalking, then loop as you would literally any other killer with no power at all.  But hey, sometimes he has haunted Grounds.  That‚Äôs something... something boring, that is.
---
Same fucking here!
---
Alao, I love to see Killer's face when his Noed doesn't work
---
He shoves them in a locker. IE iron maiden
---
And what's your native language?

---
I used to a facecamp from time to time usually in the Cornfield maps or the Yamakoa map, then I finally got "Pop Goes the Weasel" unlocked on clown and have never facecamped again. The 25% regression on gens is better then standing there losing pips.
---
\- As far as him saying it's a playstayle, he's not wrong, against SWF groups you can practically be sure that there will be a saviour there in 10s. flat so... yeah, it's a valid strategy in some cases. Not to mention once the other survivors swarm the hook the killer doesn't loose ranking points anymore so you actually enable him to stay camping.
---
I‚Äôve tried looping so many times I just can‚Äôt get it right, there‚Äôs been a few times tho where the killer gave up after like 5 seconds tho if that counts üòÇ I‚Äôm not afraid of the killer and I‚Äôll never stop playing, having fun is the main reason I play, I just wanna better myself. Thanks for the youtube suggestions üòä

Pretty sure it isn't mapwide but rather a super large number like old wake up used to be.

I remember when Myers was first new, my buddies and I were playing, and one of them said "It's a Myers.", I was like "ok"
---
Didn't see my buddy leave the gen cuz I was looking towards an exit spot. Friends started laughing their asses off as I got grabbed off the gen and screamed.

---
I actually can't understand how do people fall for this? Everytime I'm the killer and someone goes for this trick It's basically a free hit for me
---
Moro = insta-kill. When the killer kills the survivor with his hands as opposed to killing them with a hook.
---
NOED = No One Escapes Death which is a killer perk that gives the killer a movement speed buff and one hit downs once all generators are completed. Survivors hate it because it rewards the killer for doing poorly at times.
---
Let me know if there are other terms you need clarified.
---
Yikes
---
if it's an ebony mori than everyone can be killed after getting hooked once
---
A Mori is an offering that once a survivor has been hooked once the killer can kill you by there own hand ( murder you on the floor) 
---
NOED is no one escapes death, once all the gens are powered the killer can one shot you. However this is a totem perk so if you cleanse all the totems through the game the perk will not activate if it does activate you have to locate said totem and destroy it to remove NOED
---
But you wont, because i know all you oinkers like a good piece of BACON ! :D **THE BACON** !
---
I think solo players should just receive some map awareness buffs to help close the gap between SWF and solo, let's say butchered version of kindred - if you are solo survivor on the hook, all the other solo survivors see auras of all survivors within 32 meters of you. And/or bond-empathy, where you see other injured solo survivors within 32 meters, something like that.
---
I think that big advantage of SWF is that they don't really need aura reading perks and can stack other, more powerful perks instead. When I play solo, I run at least one awareness perk, sometimes two, but in SWF I'm free to fill all the slots with more second chance perks.
---
As a killer, playing against SWF would still be way harder, but hopefully solo buffs would promote playing solo more? Maybe even introduce small BP boost for playing solo to further help with the issue.
---
you make that sound uncommon.
---
I‚Äôm playing pig rn so I‚Äôm offended
---
It's basically the Saw 3 outfit, but they added the sleeves from 1 to hide the hidden blade.
---
My favorite to play against is Trapper(partially because I know how a Trapper thinks and I laugh when my teammates get trapped by stupidly obvious traps)
---
Least favorite's a tossup between Doctor and Legion.
---
Favorite would probably be Wraith bc the bing bong is fun, least favorite is Huntress and Freddy just because the lullabies are sooooo annoying and irritating to hear over and over again
---
Booty booty booty rocking everywhere.
---
Sht it‚Äôs mine too ü•∫
---
It's one of those perks that is situational, if you see them bring in Flashlights or Toolboxes it's always nice to run Franklin's on almost any Killer. It'll keep them a bit more busy getting their crap back after a chase or unhook, so it buys you time they can't gen rush.
---
What are you doing her then ? Go of reddit and do your job for the fog and kill them xD
---
Billy is a top 3 killer man he barely needs Ruin let alone NOED.
---
Survivor leaves should almost guarantee a black pip and killer dc should guarantee black pip
---
Thank you very much!
---
The only reason everyone immediately resented the battle pass is because "ugh Fortnite did it so it must be bad". Then the details got revealed on stream and suddenly it's pretty good.
---
Would start Billy, or if you have him, go Leatherface for BBQ&amp;Chili
---
AMANDA?! HA HAAA!
---
I was always confused why nearly everyone in post-game chat recognizes Monto. Then you realize they're in Rank 1, and they've probably had half their games with him.
---
It is technically banable unless everyone agrees and no one reports anyone. Now there‚Äôs a limit to how much you can farm tho, as the one not-farmer might just finish the gens and open the gate to force everyone out
---
Dwight is male lesbian
---
Thanks, I was just making sure because a killer just farmed with me and my swf and I was making sure I wouldn't get banned
---
If you're working on a gen with other people and the killer starts approaching, don't just run off the gen immediately.  That's what most people do and the killer will hone in on the first person he sees (the ones who run).  Stay crouched at the gen and continue working on it when you're satisfied that the killer has been distracted.  Now if you're good at running the killer around, by all means, run.  But I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you're not just based on this post (it's ok- I'm not either).
---
Ooooh. R.I.P.
---
2 Surviviors leaving iirc is enough to trigger the killer to depip. 
---
So 2 Surviviors leaving should be a black pip no matter what and killer DC should be a black pip no matter what. I like this idea
---
I only saw someone get actually banned for that once. It was when my friend was streaming and 3 other guys were bodyblocking him to force him to farm with them. He sent the stream video to the devs and they got banned for a week
---
Can't lose with dignity because this game isn't about Survivor vs. Killer, it's Survivor vs. the bullshit this game offers, Lag, hitboxes, and glitches, moris and NOED.
---
Why give a GG if a killer was cheap about it.
---
I'm a killer main, I main Nurse and I get everyone on death hook and let everyone go. No toxicity, no one dies, everyone gets their BP and leaves. This game needs more killers like that. This day and age it's all about me, me, me, me both killers and survivors. We have to take a step back and let EVERYONE enjoy the time.
---
I had a guy recently who went on a full 2 day long rant about me not giving him the hatch when he was last alive. He couldn't fathom that the killer was there to kill him and instead blamed me for doing my job as the killer.
---
Oh now I understand what u mean üòÇ
---
that actually made me smile and chuckle instead of \*pleased nose exhale\*. have an upvote and i will share your meme with this post link rather than just picture. 
---
thank you
---
Literally won‚Äôt change anything. The survivors already have these achievements because they were easy and if they don‚Äôt already have them then chances are they don‚Äôt care and will continue to play how they normally do. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt care either way because I already have them unlocked
---
Yea I'm kind of experienced with looping and I still mess up all the time. Honestly memorizing pallet locations after playing a while really helps too. I also HIGHLY recommend watching Ardetha's survivor coaching videos and probably his survivor gameplay as well. Oh and Ussylis as well.
---
I'm really fucking high rn and this is disrupting my entire psyche.
---
debatable
---
Balanced landing is a life saver. Definitely use it
---
In my one thousand hours, I've never thought to watch a survivor's stream and snipe them. I can't figure out if that makes me a nice guy, or just incredibly stupid
---
Okay I will, maybe when I get a second perk slot. I play with a lot of friends and I like to meme with them.
---
I'm having a blast playing killer currently.  EGC Hatch close mechanic makes 4K so easy now no slugs required anymore.  And not having to worry about Decisive (I always switch targets or am engaged in a new chase after each hook) or MoM (nerfed into uselessness) anymore is glorious.  For me the game feels very good compared to where it's been for killers in the past.  Mixing it up with the lower tier killers with basic addons and still finding a lot of success.  There feels like there is some real flexibility with some of the perk slots too.  Some of the newer perks are feeling quite strong in the Meta.  Absolutely loving Pop goes the Weasel right now.   Killer is in a pretty good spot currently.

While technically against the rules because its teaming, youre not going to get banned for farming.
---
his time line is...interesting to say the least
---
Usually I‚Äôm green when I‚Äôm panicking because I‚Äôve had the killer consistently on my ass and I‚Äôm on hook 3.
---
The reason I‚Äôm in such a situation is because of 
---
Teammates sandbagging the killer onto me
---
Teammates body blocking my escape route
---
intentional or not
---
And then there‚Äôs the purely unavoidable scenarios
---
Killer perfectly tracks me regardless of what I do upon discovering me (we‚Äôre talking seeing through walls levels of finding me, not that they actually see through walls but holy shit... and no, there aren‚Äôt scratches in these events, they just... find me perfectly)
---
Killer finds me beginning of match and there‚Äôs nothing to use to get away or nothing that I can use to hide, no pallets or windows, no walls because I haven‚Äôt gotten to a location with walls yet, no generator to make noise with and hide on the other side of it so the killer can‚Äôt see me because the camera just barely can‚Äôt see below the other side of a generator, no barriers to crouch behind, nothing.
---
You should play a little bit more than ! I recommend spirit Fury and Enduring.
---
How long have y‚Äôall been playing because I feel like you have to know after a week or 2
---
Of those three statements the only one that is debatable is Billy barely needing Ruin which is why I went with that word.  He is one of the few killers in game along with Nurse and Spirit that still feel viable without it but it's a comfort level thing.  Nothing wrong on it one way or the other if you still use Ruin.  
---
Absolutely noone would argue his placement as a top 3 killer and about 99% of players would agree NOED on him is a hit much lol.  Unlimited instadown potential with insane mobility?  You have to be pretty unconfident in your ability to run anything on the man that encourages M1 hits.
---
Even if his views are different his comics made a good format.
---
Take the original icon and edit over it tbh, best way to get dimensions and positioning right

congrats op you made me think about clown boner, I'm gonna go to sleep now
---
We can't help you, send a support ticket.
---
when you repost
---
No and for 4 reasons.
---
1) Knowing if the killer is looking at you is way better than knowing you are looking at the killer. This means all stealthy killers with the exception of tier-1 Myers will have their stealth abilities become utterly useless against you. It's all well and good knowing if the Wraith or pig is passing by your area of the map, but it is far more valuable to know if they are coming for YOU. Also, spinechill is a passive perk. It will always activate if needed whereas Prem only activates once then requires a cooldown.
---
2) During chases and making saves. It's ability to let you know that the killer has lost sight of you during a chase is so valuable. Some times (especially in maps with a lot of walls) it is hard to tell if the killer has lost sight of you in a chase. Premoniton may tell you that the killer is like 20 meters behind you, but that is information you already know so it's useless. Spinechill is like "Its cool man, the killer isn't following you anymore" which gives you an opportunity to heal, hide, or return to a gen without fear of being attacked further. It's especially great against Nurse blinks, Billy sprints, and Spirit phases.
---
3) On top of this it is suprisingly great for saving teammates from the hook. It can be difficult to know when best to save someone if you are finding it hard to get a visual on the killer (ie basement saves, or hospital saves). Spinechill lets you know if the killer is looking/running away from the hooked survivor which gives you the opportunity for the save. It also allows you to recognise that the killer is still there if the killer is using a stealth ability/perk to hide their terror radius. The constantly active affect of Spinechill also allows you to get behind a killers view-cone without them even knowing you are there. 
---
4) You can be rest assured when completing a task (gen, totem, etc) that the killer is not approaching you. The 34m range of spinechill is also larger than any killers terror radius (which can range from 24m-32m). This gives you an early warning system to get out of dodge calmly before the killer rotates to your gen. And yes im sure prem does the same job, but the cool-down of prem is not very reliable and especially in small maps when it would be going off all the time - making it less useful.
---

‚ÄúHell and Back‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat Doesn‚Äôt Kill Me‚Äù or ‚ÄúOnly Makes Me Stronger‚Äù all could be good names for the survivor perk

Don‚Äôt know why they downvote you, you speak the truth.

Spirit and Hag are the strongest DLCs + have good teachables.

Leatherface is dogshit but has the best teachable for killers. 
---
The rest are kinda shit and have mediocre teachables.

Only got into the game last week and am still learning a lot about the perks but before the rank reset I made it to Rank 8 survivor.  For the most part you just want to establish yourself as the more annoying survivor the killer could pick to focus on and they will generally try and kill everyone else first.  As some have already mentioned here you definitely need to learn looping, but often times after you use as much time as possible on one loop it is imperative that you know where the next possible loop or jungle gym is located.  Often times I see people finish a loop and start running off only to realize they do not know the next step to evading the killer, so whenever you are on a generator, walking around, etc just keep your eye out for where pallets and looping spots are located.
---
Furthermore, one thing I have been doing a bit more recently when looping the killer around a pallet (before throwing it down as the idea is to try and hold of on using the pallet until the last second) and I am at full health I will sometimes just take the hit and continue the loop with the extra boost of speed or book it to a better looping location.  Often times I see people throw down the pallet just as they get hit and that honestly is a win in my opinion for the killer as they injured you and destroy the pallet altogether.  So try not to throw down a pallet right away if you are going to get hit, and basically think of whether it would be really bad if you are to get hit by the killer in that moment at full health (Ideally you don't want to be hit at all and this might be something to think about more near rank 10ish).  
---
As the killer I always enjoy really altruistic survivors because sometimes they will immediately come unhook someone just as I left the area to find someone else to hunt down, but since I am not that far away I turn around and locate the recently unhooked survivor to hook them again and bring them another step closer to death with little time in between hooks.  This can be considered tunneling perhaps but if I am going to pick one person to target when I see two people running away from the hook I will pick the injured survivor.  So basically unless you have the perk "borrowed time" to protect teammates you just unhooked from being downed again wait for a minute if possible to save the hooked survivor as this gives you time to repair generators while they are sitting there (assuming this is there first time being hooked).  This is typically the best case scenario because if they are rehooked they will start at the struggling point regardless of how fast you unhooked them the first time.  
---
You probably already know some of this stuff but if not I hope you or someone else finds this post helpful.  Once again I have only been playing for about a week so I do not know all the strategies or completely the top level playing strategies yet but this is my take.  Been watching top tier youtubers playing recently which seems to help me think about how I should play the game better.
---
Aight 'bout to head out
---
Tydetyme, tru3 and hexy :^)
---
Survivor mains perhaps? I don‚Äôt judge, I respect survivor mains for putting up with tunneling and camping.
---
For me it's : Lith, dance with me, lightweight, quick and quiet. Red-rank killers will have little issue finding you if they can still see your scratchmarks - especially spirit.
---
I just find a medkid in-game instead of self-heal but thats just me.

of course provided by r/antifastonetoss and r/stonetossingjuice
---
The key to getting better at looping is knowing the maps. Ohtofu is an excellent player and has map breakdowns on you tube. Don't use dead hard to directly dodge a killer's attack, but instead use it to get safely to a pallet or window if a killer is closing in during a chase. (You can dh and dodge a hatchet even if it goes right through you and you can dh over set bear traps also)
---
You clearly don't play ghostface enough
---
Rancor is a better version of NOED.
---
Why did you bring mgtow in this discussion. It has nothing to do with anything and he just posted a meme
---
What does being immersed mean in this game?
---
Some of them I get, but has he never heard of the movies/killers for Myers and Leather-face?
---
Sucks because half of those perks don‚Äôt work at high ranks but if I could run it now I probably would
---
Because he's sitting here justifying the posting of literal Nazi comics, and one look into their profile shows that they're clearly a racist and misogynist. Those things should be called out. If he's not ashamed that's whatever, but I'm absolutely going to let other people know that he's spreading bigotry on this subreddit and on the site in general
---
Least favorite: Doctor.

Around 2 months ago, if memory serves.

According to the wiki: 
---
*"Dying¬†Survivors can see the¬†Auras of their team mates and vice versa.¬†Dying Survivors can use their team mates' locations to determine whether they should move or attempt to recover."*
---
It says nothing about a range but pretty sure it's infinite. Even of it wasn't though, 8 meters would be nothing and the perk wouldn't worth running. Even with Knockout, the aura reading range is large enough that the increased volume wouldn't help either. Regardless, slugging is kind of a scummy tactic that shouldn't be encouraged to begin with. It's boring for survivors to be forced onto the ground for 4 minutes waiting to bleed out.
---
Well am I the only one to not understand or am I just dumb? üòÇ
---
It really isn't specific to him at all.
---
I wish they could somehow get the rights to Robert Englund Freddy so bad.. but I know it‚Äôll never happen :(
---
Good on you, zvbark.
---
MORI: Offering/perk(devour hope and Rancor)/addon(The Shape Judith's tombstone or tombstone piece) where you can kill a survivor with your bare hands so to speak. For offerings though you need to well offer them before match it will show up as a secret killee ofdering denoting to survivors its probably a mori. Or you can bring devour hope hook survivors five times be out of range each time to get a stack at 5 stacks you can kill, I will say after 3 you get the ability to instadown and it will alert players that you have devour hope. The shape is by far the easiest to do, so what you do is stalk till you reach tier 3 once in tier you can kill instantly unless theyre in a dying state or in a locker. 
---
NOED: No One Escapes Death. Its an endgame perk that allows you to instadown people, along with a 5% speed increase. Now the way to stop NOED is to cleanse totems. If you cleanse all 5 totems you have no fear of noed. Also you can cleanse noed while active as well. NOED is a hot topic due to people feeling its unbalanced. I think its fine but I also cleanse totems. 
---
Feel free to ask any other questions.
---
No its not a valid strategy... Its basically being a dick to the one on the hook and yourself.
---
If the SWF is smart they just go for the gens. You and the facecamped depip.
---
The END
---
The only type of farming that would cause a ban would be constantly farming the same person against their will repeatedly which is essentially grieving and they really need to remove the word farming from the list because this comes up often because new players especially think it's bad and they'll get banned.
---
We have multiple events each year that are basically community farming.
---
I get the people who hides in lockers, and disconnects when they realise what I'm doing. Maybe I'll get it one day.
---
I once saw three tea bag at the exit, said ‚Äúnah, I‚Äôll be in the gas station if you need me‚Äù and proceeded to trap every entrance to the gas station

Suck my dick. Blocked. Won't even see your reply.

"Getting the drop on a survivor for the first hit" what does this mean?
---
If you‚Äôre being messaged stuff like that you know you‚Äôve done your job well and they‚Äôre just salty
---
Damn you were so close, the dead hard is what really got you. 
---
That's just bad luck that the Jane was the "last survivor" right when you downed her

Misogyny.dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women. Wow you are stupid

Good man cuz that's some messed up shiz

Good to know

why‚Äôre you so mad?

If you‚Äôre really into the game I suggest you read the wiki, it‚Äôs extremely helpful and official.

It's Peppa Pig ffs!
---
Such a great player base
---
Balanced landing, Empathy, Adrenaline, and self-care. Itll take awhile get a few of those if you dont have them but that's the perks I use. Empathy so I can get those spicy heal points
---
Me or the other guy? This thread is getting very confusing
---
"calling racists out is bad and you hurt my feelings". If you go on subreddits line MGTOW you are a bad person, feel free to look at the OPs comment history and tell me what YOU think, there are comments being racist and misogynist in the same short sentence
---
Watch TrUTal3NT on Youtube. He explains a lot of neat things regarding pov during chases and knowing when to waste pallets and when not to.
---
Okay man you've commented on a lot and your point is out there. Let the big kids speak now
---
Adrenaline doesn't need a rework survivors earn it by finishing all the gens 
---
Noed needs a rework
---
I always go back to save my team. Or hunt the noed totem, and all that jazz, would rather die trying as its more fun. I never leave selfishly as you say. 
---
However there have been exactly two times since it's integration in the game where egc has either killed me or a team mate. And to be quite honest those moments were awesome. Risky intense and fun. 
---
More often than not having the timer go off has helped me identify that a door is open. Has given me a 50/50 chance of escaping during a chase. Or its allowed me to know that the other door I'm not near is open and my team are there. I've also run to a 99'd door with killer hot on my ass and been downed cos the extra motion to the switch and interacting with it, then running into the exits was just enough to allow that second hit to happen.
---
There are a hell of a lot of variables at play with this. So I can't see how 99'ing a door is any more or less useful than the other reasons to open it. But it's my opinion on this one. 
---
If you wanna 99 every door then that's your prerogative. Same as it is mine to slam that switch and get that door open. 
---
(Also I'm aware not everyone is a toxic swf, I was exaggerating to make the point)
---
I meant farming like tapping a gen then having the killer kick it over and over again and the killer letting us drop pallets on them not farming them off of the hook
---
That's a good idea. They just dangle there by foot until someone comes and lets them down, kicking the pullie system as their kobe method
---
Any killer over any survivor
---
His given name is Kira, his family name is Yoshikage.  
---
Most countries put your given name first.
---
Alright then hag or good looking half of plague
---
Because you come in here acting all self righteous, "oh it's just a joke dude calm down" then as soon as you realized you were basically sticking up for a racist, you walk it back. Next time just keep your words to yourself instead of posting such vapid, feckless garbage
---
Him haha.
---
That sounds exactly like the thing a killer Main would write when dropping pallets with no reason is totally stupid.
---
üëä
---
Cool
---
You can barely type out a coherent comment, but I'm the stupid one lol. MGTOW is a subreddit dedicated to misogyny and generally being a judgemental sad loser. If you enjoy that sub you're almost certainly a brainless dipshit
---
Shaggys mentally deranged cousin sketchy instead of a dog he‚Äôs got a ferret with rabies.
---
Even the cheapest $10 Walmart keyboard will last at least 10m keystrokes before it starts to die, never mind a good solid mechanical keyboard then you're talking 40-50m keystrokes.
---
To put that in perspective.. if pressed a key twice per second no stop 24hrs a day nonstop it would take you over 2 months to hit 10m
---
Also since hook struggling lasts 60 seconds at most and only happens once a match so even if you managed to play 2 minute matches with a full minute of struggle in each match it would take approx 2777 hours to hit 10m at that rate.
---
I already said that im not okay with racism you stupid cuck. But yeah mgtow bad orange man bad, were you mad at a factory mr npc?
---
ok so since i didn‚Äôt realize i was sticking up for someone who supported racism before i looked at the other comments i‚Äôm in the wrong? i‚Äôm not allowed to change my opinion? wow you‚Äôre really really ignorant dude
---
To look like or to do stuff with? LOL
---
Lol where did I ever say i don't know how to loop a Billy?  Nice assumption though.  To say that a good survivor will never ever eat a saw is laughably oversimplistic though.  I've watched hundreds of streamer vids and have watched Billy's saw good survivors.  It does happen lol.  They aren't all potatoes.
---
With "Bad Ash" I'm talking every Ash clone that has ever appeared in the Evil Dead franchise. The most famous one is the Army of Darkness one, sure, but the one from Ash vs Evil Dead season 3 is a good choice too imho.

Lmao sprint and selfcare so scare, fuck you
---
Never seen that before, but that‚Äôs creepy as shit lmao
---
Curious if you‚Äôre implying that you play on Xbox or use the controller on PC

I mean controller on PC is just pro strats everyone knows that
---
What if I run pepto bismol Ace and do chests to curry rapport with the killer and get hatch?
---
J O I N U S
---
Same! Barely got into the game and I was already referring to them by name also. Everybody was so confused ;w;
---
if you had played since release you would have legacy dwight though....

Wait.. you had to explain that surveillance is a perk? What did they think what it is?

Lol camping is only useful when ur fucked up with friends or making clips for CAMPIN WITH LEATHERFACE IMA PISSEMOFF!!!

Btw, "The END" what is this a screenplay? This is the internet, you of all people would know salt mongers don't know the end even if the fell of the fucking cliff ignoring the sign...

The entity watching you
---
Most of the time, when I do that, it‚Äôs honestly an accident or I‚Äôm not really thinking about it. Usually I do it, then immediately regret it lol Some people do it because they think it‚Äôs better if they‚Äôre already dropped but in my case, dropping them on the killer as been my best bet to escape. Dunno why be doing that sometimes
---
damn i just read mad-observer's comment history and it's so funny bc they're just an angry person all the time, like damn dude im so sorry who hurt you LMAO
---
Sometimes they want to hit you with a hammer
---
Imagine Fred as the killer, His mori he pulls your face off like an old rubber mask O.O
---
If you‚Äôre bad then that just makes him worse by default right?
---
Exactly
---
I use controller on pc but my boyfriend makes fun of me for it
---
That‚Äôs the cutest fucken thing I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Its not to late to try
---
I tried to play nurse, even though I'm awful. I didn't get a single hook. Post game everyone was really nice and didn't flame. I've noticed that a lot recently.
---
If everyone was stealthy enough then you wouldn't need chases though
---
Me, a slut for not having to deal with NOED lmao
---
That is probably the answer to annoy you... because let's be honest this whole 4-man team is just there for you right? Stupid shit happens, no need to get your panty's in a twist...
---
I'll admit I'm one of those
---
So by playing dbd and enjoing the community here im hurting women and your feelings? Sorry ;(
---
CHAIN       SAW, I love my hatch grab ‚Äúgotcha bitch‚Äùvideo

That killer fucked you up huh üòÇ you mad as hell coming on all these threads saying the same thing. Go to bed

..Leatherface. Hillbilly. Ghostface. Myers in tier 3. Technically plague if you don't count her power, Trapper if you don't count his Beartraps.
---
..This game is full of characters that can oneshot, and I didn't even touch the factor of perks, and addons. Guy needs a healthy helping of ***git gud.***

Agreed
---
Enjoy the game.
---
Just don't ruin it for others.

Stop hiding, do gens.

*Britishness intensifies*

Mori‚Äôs THANK YOU FOR EXISTING

Oh, thanks
---
Urban evasion and balanced landing definitely, and then which ever other two works best for your play style. I‚Äôm a Nea main and my build is: Urban eveasion, balanced landing, premonition, and dark sense.
---
It does though since if the killer will not get in a chase he will just keep patrolling gens until he finds someone.   If you are a bit more balsy and can get in a chase you give your teammates free time to do generators.

I have that every game. Basically, when a survivor completely dies (gets raised up into the sky) that shade stands where he got downed the last time.
---
Its nice to go trough whole game without seeing someone when they are sitting in a corner
---
Wow you dont say?
---
As a killer main I have to say that it is a great strategy to drop all the pallets as soon as you see them... Every survivor should do it...
---
This is accurate. lol
---
Not everyone watches streamers and YouTube to know this trick.
---
I love and ship them both.
---
Why would a killer perk give survivors a bonus?
---
someone put the x files theme over this
---
I got evil incarnate on my first try. I was lucky the entire group was tbagging a generator wanting to farm points. I just stalked them all at the same time. They tried to run after I killed the first but it was too late lol
---
Don‚Äôt threaten violence or hack, rest is fair game, which is great because I love it when some smart ass thinks he‚Äôs got jokes and I release a savage brutal display of SHIT TALKIN lol,
---
You could just post a pic of someone pulling the plug and it would be the same thing
---
Mmmm yea I want David in my mouth so bad
---
Sounds like they were throwing.
---
Didn‚Äôt say you didn‚Äôt know how to loop. Just saying you might not be as good as you think if you go down to the chainsaw. Any survivor, even streamers, going down to it is based on their mistakes, not on the ability of billy. To say that he isn‚Äôt allowed NOED just because of his instadown ability seems ignorant.
---
Nice !! I‚Äôm currently down to Plague and Ghost Face, but I‚Äôm struggling :(
---
How is M1ing more skilled than chainsawing I will never know.
---
[I was on the other side.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1803447476) I saw the jake, toolboxes, and decided "Shit this might be a saboteam" and when I saw the offerings I knew I made the right choice.
---
nah that's not true
---
Love all you stylin  survivors with your bright ass neon hair and cloths.  So easy to spot
---
yeah... like is there a goal even at this point? 
---
1. to get some points, i dunno, whatever i guess.
---
2. who cares for escaping in 2019?
---
3. i don't mind. holding m1 whole game is not much fun. W is slightly more fun but also eh.
---
4. who in the world would want that?
---
5. is this even possible?
---
6. i mean i guess it's the closest to goal to not get constant tunneling cunts and immersing trash. but also not really cause you have that on every rank.
---
I've been looking forwad to this
---
lmao they are everywhere
---
It's nice to have access to in case you see multiple flashlights or toolboxes in a lobby, but it's not worth consistently using.
---
Ok if I get stuck in the ghetto pallet prison and I don‚Äôt get a vault-escape assist after a minute I dc,
---
Talking about people being overly hidden to where they're basically crouched in the corner of a map doing nothing all game.
---
Plague was difficult I‚Äôm not good with her at all
---
Rip loops.
---
I meet that guy once. He‚Äôs got the best dope.
---
Maybe they binded everything to a key and they automatically drop a pallet down? Or they are just helping the killer and hoping to farm with them when they get 3k.
---
I don't remember tbh, but I took it in a game right before I posted it. So if he was playing then, chances are it's him.
---
Because you don't rise above the pallets
---
This happened to me too, it‚Äôs sooo god damn annoying.
---
just focus on that one next time and ignore the salty ones.. help making this community better!
---
You could get even higher without dcs
---
For the last 3 months, I have been able to play maybe twice a month due to a very exhausting warehouse job and being busy with uni so I am constantly in the low ranks, despite being fairly good in the game. 
---
I can tell you it hasn't made the game too fun when you're an ex-red rank stuck in the yellow ranks. As a killer you have like 4hour queues for a match you win in 2mins with at least one dc. Survivor is especially "fun" when your teammates are complete potatoes and spend most of the match hiding or self caring in the corner and once they get foumd, they waste at least 4 pallets and still manage to get downed in 10secs. Of cpurse if the killer finds me, they get run for a solid while (which is understandable as they have propably just bought the game), after which i get camped or tunneled off a hook. 
---
Been searching for other games to play for a while...
---
Ikr
---
I leveled meg to 50 before I tried paying as killer, now megs only survivor past lvl 3 and every killer is at least 40. I‚Äôm definitely ment to be a killer on here. My spirit build is undefeated still 72 games only 6 survived, 4 auto hatched after 3rd survivor died other was a mercy hatch out of pity
---
&gt;It's no different from the p2p host system.
---
Well, it is different in that the fault of the disconnect will be much more clear.
---
I've always thought the reason that disconnects are not heavily punished right now is because it is possible for the host (not sure about the clients) to cause others to disconnect by dropping too many packets or blocking their connection intentionally.
---
With dedicated servers, I hope BHVR will start to hand out more punishments for disconnecting since the reason can no longer be chalked up to issues connecting to the host.
---
 its just because I copy pasted this one through discord because I fucked up the screenshot I was going to put here
---
He‚Äôs holding back cause he knows if he kills a killer the entity will strike him down.. he‚Äôs waiting until the right moment to save everyone and himself.

DAMN RIGHT LOL.

Random salty survivor: Camper! 1!1!1!1!1!!
---
We don't have proof that he camped, although it's a good strategy to punish excessive altruism
---
some scp type shit
---
I mean if billy wants to waste a perk slot that's fine. I tend to do all the totems in a map just incase, their salt when NOED doesn't go off is worth it.
---
I can just hear the waste saying ‚ÄúGG EZ!‚Äù I hear it speaking to me...
---
But why most killers run like there on God damn teir 3 cocaine anyway
---
They didn't just nerf Remember Me for its potential with Freddy + EGC, it was for EGC in general.
---
That said the nerf was insane and I can't believe they kept it. Why gut the primary use of the perk instead of just nerfing it in that one scenario they thought made it OP? They could have easily just made it not apply during hatch close EGC - like just mak
---
Bloodlust stacks with NOED as well, even worse if you got a tier 3 Myers chasing you, absolute nightmare fuel
---
Yeah I knew what bloodlust was but I didn't know it stacked, jeez that's big scary
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
I am now running sloppy butcher + bloodhound and predator, which makes it easy to track people down. And for the last perk i gotta use NOED  ;D
---
I didn't say I go down to his chainsaw lol.  I'm actually quite good at making them M1 me since I started off the game playing Billy first way back when and know what works against him.  Again bad assumption.  You are tossing out a gross oversimplification of Billy's ability with good survivors.  Copout response too that it is basically nothing but survivor mistakes causing it.  You can say that about anything.  They attempted to juke the saw but failed vs.  The Billy making a good correction and prediction and accurately landing it themself.  Even people that resort to NOED don't typically run it on Billy.  It's overkill with that insane map pressure and skill shot instadown that he has ready at any point.
---
They must have been very lucky i guess
---
You mean from the month of May? or someone called May claiming that they are their backgrounds?
---
For 3 reasons. One is to distract the killer or get the killer to find you individually so you can start a chase. Another is the one everyone is mentioning ‚Äòto make you mad‚Äô. And lastly accidents happen but if it happens multiple times most likely to make you mad
---
it‚Äôs simply ‚Äúthe cat‚Äù for me and my friends (lines like ‚Äúmy cat is blinking, HIDE!‚Äù are very frequentüòÉ)
---
i am offended that you used jane for your urban evasion point
---
People like you remind me why I used to main doc. I'd run Unnerving, Overcharge, Distressing, and either Dying Light, BBQ, Franklins, Coulrophobia, or Sloppy butcher, double calm addons, a jigsaw piece, and just three-gen survivors into submission.
---
Someone mentioned you can run off the ledge to be teleported back to the door, After that you should be able to leave. Couldn‚Äôt tell Wether it was a troll, A guess lacking a question mark or something that‚Äôs been tested though

not soon. we'll have summer event in August though. if it's anything like usual events, you'll be able to get nice bonus points with event offerings.

It's not? Most of the time the hooked survivor's aura is revealed to all survivors, this would make it so that the aura is only revealed to the survivor that was chosen to be the new obsession.

Sadly i didnt try that. I bet I'll come across that bug someday again, then I'll test it
---
i pick n choose when i want to be tho
---
Is it Nea?
---
Yeah too many people take this shit competitively. I remember my first few matches. Just like DayZ/Pubg. My heart was beating so fast! 
---
I love that feeling.
---
Yup
---
That reminds me, Sloppy Butcher is still missing on my legion.
---
tiers?
---
I play killer more than survivor now because I figured if I‚Äôm gonna rage at toxic or bot teammates anyway I might as well be the one killing them
---
Just play another match \^\^ It aint that bad
---
F I N G E R G U N S
---
Dude are you okay
---
Bro calm down, I didnt mean to piss you off we all accept you as our new rank 1 teacher, im going to call up MasterClass and see if they set up a day where you can record a series about how good you are at this game and how you deal with not having a father figure in your life
---
Lol looping isn't hard. Someone who can properly evade a killer altogether wastes far more of the killers time than someone who just hurr sure sprints past them then goes down a minute later
---
I'm so keen for this rework!! Praying to god the devs don't panic nerf him
---
Do they usually put double BPs on halloween/xmas=?
---
Bruh, I main doctor but cant afford hag (let alone the time to level her) and am still waiting for ruin to show up in the store. I cant even get lullaby to show up in his web.
---
Life is pain.
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Sorry not trying to make fun, I thought it was funny
---
I want bp though
---
Tbh I'd really be terrified if I heard feet stomping instead of heartbeat because I have flashbacks from Shrek horror games made in Unity
---
There was All Hallows' Eve event 2017, and then Winter Solstice event on christmas 2017 and 2018.
---
If you think decisive strike is still the strongest perk in the game then idk what to tell you. Maybe you‚Äôre still relatively new to the game but there are far greater perks
---
Stop rubbing my build üòÇ
---
Those comments on your steam page are so stupid. ‚ÄúRuns franklins‚Äù ‚Äúm1 killer‚Äù ‚Äúworst killer in game‚Äù.
---
Hol up
---
And when everyone's toxic, nobody will be.
---
I have a second account on console that I play with low rank friends on and that account cant level up like really
---
As a ‚ÄúToxic Nea‚Äù main, I accept the toxic waste title.

It's fun to sit in the basement all game until someone comes looking for you. Then they die for not just taking the easy win and leaving
---
Same

Why aren't you wearing the mask tho ?
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
Frame rates need to be fixed on Xbox it‚Äôs not even fun sometimes dude
---
choke me mommy nurse

You forgot getting 3 gen'ed
---
Survivors are 100% on a team with one another regardless of if they are swf.
---
It looks like leather face has started vlog channel
---
Good god I swear I can hear your voice through this and you just sound pathetic.
---
with their permission ofc
---
I'll give it a try
---
Camping is only really acceptable once the exit gates are opened, since altruistic survivors lose all brain cells during that period and allow for some juicy downs
---
If someone is playing Bubba I also fully expect them to facecamp, it‚Äôs the only thing he can do unfortunately
---
Interesting lore and such but having remote AI in the game would be buggy as hell knowing behavior, plus he‚Äôd have to be super slow if he had those hounds and such and it‚Äôd be hard to balance. But nonetheless a cool concept. üëçüèª
---
If you‚Äôre at the point where your last resort is to juke the chainsaw then you‚Äôve already made the mistake as a survivor. At that point it is completely up to Billy. My assumption is based on you telling me that you think his one-shot has any reliability to get downs against well prepared survivors. Most Billys don‚Äôt use NOED because they know it doesn‚Äôt help you win when there are better perks to pressure gens and end chases, but to say they can‚Äôt use it is so pretentious.
---
thank youuu
---
I‚Äôm about to go to bed and this is horrifying. I can confidently say you‚Äôre about to haunt my dreams. Thanks... Also nice job üò°
---
i think rank reset is a hit or miss. the only reason i think it doesn‚Äôt work half the time is due to the ranking system. ex: kills are 4 survivors in the first 5 minutes and is rewarded with a de-pip. it sucks that you have to purposely let survivors live for a lot longer than they should when they aren‚Äôt skillful but then there‚Äôs the case when you have 4 good survivors who gen rush you and escape without letting you even score a hook. the idea of rank reset to shuffle the players and make getting to rank 1 a challenge every month is cool but it doesn‚Äôt work most of the time.
---
Rank 20 mentality
---
Honestly this one is so out there I laughed a little
---
The fuck? Are people just expecting M1 killers all the time? Is this how low the community has dropped?
---
I fucking despise playing against the doctor, love playing against Mikey, he‚Äôs so spooky
---
I love playing AS ghostface, and will never play trapper ever
---
My first game ever as a killer, I got put up against low rank survivors. Rip
---
No. People arent saying he is OP. At most they are saying he's A tier. 
---
Please stop this. This is an obvious attempt at karma farming. We're better than that. YOU are better that that...
---
I meet survivors who die to Legion's mend and i can't believe this shit. I was amazed with disappointed when i saw a guy die to it on the other side of the map. This is in green ranks
---
The vast majority of people don't think that Freddy is OP. Other than the false pallets that have limited counterplay other than memorizing every pallet on the map before being slept, he doesn't do anything that other killers can't do better.
---
survivors: dude why is the killer camping wtf? also survivors: staying near the hooked person, obviously waiting for the killer to leave.
---
I find using I'm all ears very effective in certain situations, and if you  are somewhat good with blinks you can get a free hit. They cannot see you (given you're behind a wall with a window) but you see their aura.
---
green ranks are so random. whether i‚Äôm killer or survivor the survivors could be godly or our trash. i played a game of ghost face and had zero chances of using my power because all 4 survivors rushed into my knife.
---
True,but eitherway you'll have a hard time because usually by the time you get tombstone ready there's around 1 gen left
---
Next game against another billy.:
---
Lol noob can't even saw, baby m1illy.
---
Just stop dc'ing, it ruins the game for other people.
---
Yeah its garbage. It you dont boost out of low ranks early enough then you basically cant play solo survivor for the rest of the month. Well you can, but then rather than playing to enjoy the game it feels like you‚Äôre playing to grind yourself out of those ranks.
---
The rank 10-12 arent even that bad to be fair. Not great but they know how tonplay the game. Thats fine. Its when the game matches you with rank 16+ and they literally dont touch gens for most of the game.
---
Billy with noed is rare? I wish. Seems quite common
---
That does not work. I've tried that. I've tried opening the other exit and leaving that way and it doesnt work either. The only way to escape if this happens is the hatch.
---
There is no ranking system in PTB, so there is also no fix for this problem
---
I enjoy that I get to bust out Cannibal for the monthly face harvest from noobs.
---
I don‚Äôt know if they could, since it‚Äôs not an official ghost face mask. Or maybe they could
---
I got ridiculed for waiting 'till this rando died (the other two died) and getting hatch EVEN THOUGH the rando had a kindred and the fucking killer was camping, so why the fuck would I save him when that'd just doom us both? (Btw, the killer was the one talking shit, even though it was his fault I didn't save)
---
I've asked people who do this why they do it. What I was told was:
---
1. "I was trying to draw the killer off a survivor by making noise. I'm a hero!" Why they wouldnt just vault or locker is beyond me...
---
2. "I was trying to heal with a controller and its the same button as pull pallet"
---
3. "For a laugh. I was bored and wanted to bring the killer to you"
---
I know, just imagine though. Your just minding your business doing your generator, your turn around and see that leaning and staring at youüòÇ
---
Same glitch happened to me, I jumped off the map and landed right in front of the killer mid-map lol
---
Lol yeah. Searched it up and Fun World do sell the Stoned Ghost Face Mask. So there‚Äôs a high probability it might be in the game
---
the killer used his power... that has to be toxic bhvr please ban
---
For some people that's not true.
---
Can't reset what you don't have in the first place
---
That's even worse. Wow
---
oink\*
---
You look like mark ruffalo if he was tryna be hella inconspicuous
---
love it
---
I literally don't know how to trigger the SB buff. It happens to me all the time, sometimes rather conveniently, sometimes it kills because after tapping SHIFT the 5th time it still wont trigger in a chase. It's fucked
---
Yeah tbh I wouldn‚Äôt use SB rn because even without bugging it on purpose it can really mess you up

You're the one in the wrong here because you decided to be an asshole about it instead of just educating him

I see you're a man of culture as well

the artwork OP is referencing had a Meg involved so this meme fits perfectly :^)

Some people have a valid reason for disconnecting that‚Äôs the problem, you can‚Äôt just punish someone from disconnecting when their internet plays up or they have to go do something

He said that dead hard was the most powerful exhaustion perk, not that it was OP.
---
Fred's basically already in the game. Trapper.
---
Slender man
---
For context: SOME HITS AFTER WINDOWS AND PALLETS ARE COMPLETE BULLSHIT AND SHOULD BE FIXED ASAP (That's why I put it as Rant, I never know the right flair :c)
---
Let him play killer and he'll might understand
---
No no no, you‚Äôre doing oneshots wrong. Ghost face with devour hope and NOED.
---
I am that one people who too immerset but still does stuff. It's nervous, full adrenalin and sometime messed up, but that just how i enjoy most of the game. 
---
Role playing it, lol.
---
I didnt say to all red rank survivors. I said to all THESE red rank survivors. I know that not every surv is toxic. After all im one of them.
---
So does flashlightijg the killer for no reason
---
So does pallet looping with taunting
---
Which killer were you?
---
she kinda floats over it
---
.
---
The same reason we have the shitty edgy remake Freddy in the game and not the original

When it comes to this game, you're either an asshole or a victim. It about a 65 to 35 percent split.

This is something you read about in a creepy pasta

def not, it's perfectly the way it is.
---
Past couple of days I‚Äôve been going in as the huntress with a pure farm build in the hopes of de ranking. 
---
BBQ - Not really planning on using it but on the off chance I do. That‚Äôs a lot of bloodpoints. 
---
Thrill of the hunt - that‚Äôs a very minor boost to bloodpoints but a boost is better than nothing. 
---
Distressing - not really getting much out of it as I‚Äôm usually stood right in front of my Hex just staring at it. 
---
Beast of prey - again.  It‚Äôs just free bloodpoints but I thought I‚Äôd give my full perk loadout. 
---
I was stood right in the corner of the map. And literally anyone who went towards my totem. I‚Äôd begin charging the hatchet. The moment they‚Äôd get on it.  I‚Äôd let go.  This worked until everyone though body blocking the person with the ranged weaponry they all managed to still be hooked. I continued my plan of not killing any of them. But 2 of them let the end game take them ;-;
---
There was still 2 more dull totems around. But each and every one of them were hell bent on my thrill of the hunt
---
Huntress fhtagn!
---
Killer bloodpoint categories.
---
Ahh i forgot about those. Was thinking it was perks.
---
or those windows which drop down and you're getting hit after you're already all the way down üôÑ
---
Why would anyone DC against Ghostface? O.o He's kinda bad...
---
I‚Äôve been a killer main for a couple of weeks now.  Hopped on survivor last night to do some daily‚Äôs. 
---
My god I have not missed being camped.  So you‚Äôre damn right I teabagged the living hell out of that huntress.
---
That‚Äôs not what a P3 Claudette looks like.
---
it's better than having a 3v1 with 4 gens to do.
---
when there are 3 survivors, one is hooked and the killer isn't camping, there are no survivors working on gens
---
One is hooked
---
One is going for the unhook
---
One is being chased
---
killer will always always win a 3v1 unless he's a potato
---
i think you should wait
---
Surveillance and Q&amp;Q are the only nice perks from the shrine rn but you're better off just leveling up Meg and Pig since they have great perks
---
nah just don't tunnel lol
---
Yeah they feel not dynamic, like vaulting window equals being in the middle of the window even if you already got through it
---
Bruh behavior could only get the rights for the ghostface mask Sydney/shorty too would be a bit out of their budget probably
---
I probably fall into the gens people, but get forcedc into the distract people because i seem to be a killer magnet
---
From someone that has always used the word and phrase, m-eye-ther is the correct pronunciation in this context.

Crouching Claudette
---
Before clicking knew it had to be doing gens, you?
---
i used noed on michael to confuse every person tea bagging me far enough at the gate. 
---
So if they tea bag me for being bad and trying to learn i will f them up and kill them.
---
Idc who you are but if u disrespect me for learning I will hunt you
---
Sandbagging in those terms mean intentionally dragging the team down.
---
Someone give this man gold. It‚Äôs so funny seeing this because sometimes you wi see what‚Äôs people‚Äôs thought process when they do things like this.
---
No, 3 good survivors definitely have a fighting chance. You might not be able to be as bold as usual, but there are ways to play around it
---
Very cool.
---
Last night I was in a game as survivor, everyone disconnected, so it was just me and killer, I'm new so didn't really know what to do with myself. 
---
Went to the exit with the killer, killer downed me then let me crawl away so I could get the achievement :D
---
unpopular opinion: people who do dull totems are wasting time and being useless. They should be doing something useful instead of being a bloodpoint whore

Can we not upvote the ableist version of this comic? And especially one that still has the watermark intact?

"Being immersed" just means crouching and hiding from the killer, generally achieving nothing in thr process. Id much rather they do dulls than absolutely nothing.

---
10 times out of 10 noed still goes off even though someone is doing dull totems when they spot one. More times than not, there are dull totems left. Not worth it compared to the valuable time wasted

I remember them saying that they wanted to add Nancy, but the remake one just didn't feel right. Like it's not Nancy that fans want to see.
---
No. It's garbage
---
Happens to me too, as a survivor and killer.
---
Survivors are abusing it making it unfun to play, so I became survivor main for now, don't play killer unless u wanna wait 3 min and get all possible worst things.

Nobody will complain about the changes that killers need if there is noone who can play killer. EZ fix
---
Same. I always play solo because I am scared of social interaction and I couldn't bear being in a team with the same people for more than one game, not to mention they'd probs want to chat and stuff and that's a big no for me.
---
I'm also considering building the hatch out of EVA foam and bringing it along to my next con.
---
the trick with plague is to use the emetic stuff and just learn red stain mindgames and get lucky.
---
I am absolutely useless in a chase, which is why I hide from the killer rather than run. My speciality is gens and saving + healing, I'm more of a stealthy survivor
---
But I am wearing the ma-...OH. Oh, you old so-and-so. XD
---
No it isn't then it would be written with a y not an i...
---
Awesome!
---
Force dbd to run in true fullscreen. You will have to google how to do its a little complicated but from what i heard it help some people with fps issues.
---
Claudette listens to science and nature podcasts, not music.
---
Fair enough, but the more time you're able to play the more points you'll get to just get more good shit. I think maybe giving a BP bonus to everyone else when someone DCs would be nice too
---
My Q times are long, can be 20 mins sometimes. But not 20 hours!
---
she also has a gunshot wound on her neck, courtesy of jeff denlon from saw 3
---
As a myers main i use this as false sense of security (i always run scratched mirror and stalk movement boosters) so if the survivors do open the gate i just moon walk to the 1 or 2 teabagging the gate and always without fail they walk right up to me crouched moving there head up and down and BANG YOU GOIN ON A HOOK BOY.
---
Imagine an immersed Nea crouching in the corner of the map and suddenly this creepy ass ghost pops in her face. That would be great.
---
You don‚Äôt got no paint thinners though
---
duh spectator mode mains are so sweaty and toxic
---
Why is this post under the controversial category? Everyone is agreeing with you lol
---
Opposite story for me. When I play survivor, my teammates literally hide in lockers the whole game, and try to self unhook then dont struggle. And when I play killer, I get a pure lobby of Baby Megs. I literally dont want play on Rank Reset day.
---
She assumes- according to wiki lore she views them as pieces of meat
---
There are 5 on a map. If you do 5, there will be no more totems left. ggez
---
Link to the original??
---
What is tbh
---
When you play as Trapper, Ghostface, Leatherface, Huntress, etc. why would i want face cosmetics? Its not like the survivors see it or anything
---
Loud screaming doesn't make it funny.
---
45 red brushes? Holy fuck you are ready
---
honestly no I only get chased when I want to get chased but I have a problem where killers stop chasing me and go after someone else
---
fighting salt with salt with salt just makes you salty

Anti Hemotthagic Syringe is just Inspire Aced

It's a T-pose of the survivor with the sacrifice effect on it (the raising up into the sky animation)
---
You mean SWF, no ?
---
Well this is the irony. For those that hard tunnel, it‚Äôs a hinderance but they‚Äôre still gonna get their tunnel eventually and probably only suffer 1, maybe 2 DS.
---
For those who are doing really good and steamrolling the survivors with a lot of momentum they‚Äôre the ones who get punished by DS the most.
---
Had a game the other day. Wraith hooks Laurie. Laurie gets unhooked. Wraith doesn‚Äôt tunnel and gets Claudette. Picks claudette up for the hook, laurie still injured goes in for the flashlight save like an idiot, misses it AND gets hit by wraith as hes carrying claudette, he hooks claudette, goes back to pick up Laurie and she hits him with DS.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I hate lame twats that tunnel right from the get-go too but its kind of sad when in cases like I just described the survivor plays like a moron, goes down and uses DS as a crutch rather than an anti-tunnel perk.
---
That used to happen to me, but for some reason now killers seem dead set on killing me
---

maybe be less altruistic or more stealthy i dunno man what perks do you run?

General Reposti!
---
last week I had a Michael who tier3'ed on a Jake and downed him when his NOED was on. Green ranks btw.
---
No the 3vs1 games were awful. Killer would just camp/tunnel and the other 2 would never get the gens done in time.
---
I want him injured these are terrible things to say to someone over a fucking game

Haha yeah it was. Most of the weird characters on boondocks seem to be based off real people.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cd2cg7/legion_sound_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
he‚Äôs trying to sneak around but he‚Äòs dummy thicc and the clap from his ass cheeks keeps alerting the killer
---
do you also have the bug while playing julie or susie to where at first you have a male voice before getting pallet stunned? (I think that's what fixes it?)
---
Do no boop that merry suicide bomber.
---
It's a common and solid build? I use these perks on my Dwight too.
---
run a  speed perk to lose the killer it would help like lithe or my recommended Balanced Landing; maybe even quiet and quiet to juke when going the same loop multiple laps into a window or locker. Honestly windows is not super helpful once you learn the pallet layout or map grid layout.
---
No, Jane gets "pole dance" attire ;)
---
I haven‚Äôt the faintest idea what this is referencing, but for a second I thought it was the ‚ÄòMy name is Patrick Bateman‚Äô speech from American Psycho.
---
Yes but I don't remember if getting stunned fixed it
---
It's not though. Against good survivors that is. You're not putting any pressure on the map, if you camp 1 hook they'll get 5 gens done and you'll walk out with some 5k points and a 1k.
---
I didn't complete the disarm, which left the trap in his lunge.
---
I think that I pinpointed that as the fix. Either way it's annoying as fuck and breaks the immersion bigtime.
---
a.) Misogyny is bigotry, he never said it was the same as racism.
---
b.) A lot of incels are massively fucking racist too.
---
The infamous "running prove thyself with a toolbox but getting found immediately and running the killer around for 10 minutes"
---
I usually just do gens by myself. It's a bit odd but it feels cool supporting other survivors and helping them get to the endgame.
---
The month, I put the creators in the message
---
For me, I just have a hectic insecurity about my voice. Everyone I talk to says it's a pretty normal voice, but I still cannot shake it and it's prevented me from playing with loads of cool peeps, aha.
---
One of those is not like the others.
---
Think about it, if you hit down the survivor again, you're applying pressure to one survivor only. If you go after the unhooker you're applying pressure to 2(or more) survivors since the unhooked one needs to heal.
---
A nice survivor did warn me about reset. I just wanted to do my daily rituals D: Cause I keep getting killer ones. 
---
And I know. But if I take it seriously when I dont know how to do anything as killer and then do awful Im just gonna feel worse. So its a defense mechanism. Even though I know Id do awfiul trying anyway, I can say "I wasnt trying" and feel a little better. 
---
I really want to learn and get better where I can feel comfortable trying.
---
I hate playing against hillbilly. I don't know why it just feels so unfun.
---
My favorite is probably the new Freddy
---
Noed with myer actually works. When tier 3 ends they think they can safely take a hit so they get bold for unhooks or finding the hatch
---
Have you ever seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
---
People who bitch about NOED on Myers make me wonder if they're ever good enough to *actually* run out of evil per survivor or if they're just talking out their ass and pissy cause they got got.
---
Just give it a TR decrease even without in a chase but make it abit lower
---
I hate it as the killer. So many experienced SWF groups T-bagging me, flashlight clicking and absolutely roasting me in the chat, calling me a baby, a noob killer, dumb m1 killer, literally laughing, calling me a bitch, telling me to go cry and bawl my eyes out, etc. I hate it.
---
As a survivor, it's usually pretty good. There might be some moris but mostly the most annoying thing is the face campers. But still, it's better than when I play killer right after rank reset
---
Awesome plague art I'm a new killer to but she's still really fun to play!
---
I would ask you why but I don't really give a shit, also if it triggered some killermains to downvote than it's at least worth that.
---
Haddonfield is next
---
Agreed. :)
---
Scrubs love that shit
---
I managed to get my Pig adept against a weak team, then I try my Spirit adept, and I face a stack with insta heals, flashlights and DS. I'm just going to wait two weeks to try again (and just hope they fix killer lobby times).
---
I didn't know he was playing the music at the time or actively telling me to drop him, I just did this on a whim and the stars happened to be aligned.
---
Know your playerbase. If the majority suck, then the game has to be balanced enough to include them
---
Do you have the source for the original comic Op? Also ye, we all angry at a videogame, which we play to have fun, ironic
---
Lightborn as a cosmetic
---
Understandable, but keep in mind survivors will not show mercy (unless they're super nice, but that's rare). Its best to try your best and fail and try again instead of just avoiding it. Think about it this way, as a survivor your first few games will go horribly, you'll get camped and die for a lot of games, but the more you play the better you get at avoiding the killer, dealing with camping, etc. Eventually you'll escape and feel great and you'll just keep improving the more you play. Sure you'll die in a few games, but not every match is the same. Playing the nice farming killer is about the same as trying to befriend the killer as survivor. It doesn't work out and you won't really improve that way.
---
So to sum it up. It's better to keep trying and improving, than it is to play passively.
---
Sorry for the long reply

Doctor‚Äôs new ability is quite impressive.

I think she does, but it could just be a random blood stain

There are a lot of players who are fine with just playing together without talking

It's hard to loop a killer when your mate dropped every pallet before :/

I usually don't really think about my voice up until someone says "she" to another teammate. I'm like: *dissociation*. My voice sounds pretty androgynous to me but when I listen to it recorded, I must admit that it's high-pitched as fuck and immediately outs me. I just don't often realise it because my friends refer to me as he/him and as I have already said, I hear my voice as way lower than it is in reality.

I've tried some real-time voice altering programs but the ones that worked were only free trial and I don't have the money to buy the full version. The free ones somehow managed to actually not work in real time. The games I play with voice chat are Deceit and SCP: Secret Laboratory, both on Steam, maybe that's got something to do with some of the programs not working

I'm ready for your body being ready for freddy
---
Balanced, like all things should be.
---
Don't mind rank reset just got to rank 6 first time as the killer but the que times are such bs I only can play few games max a day.
---
Personally I think huntress becomes better than hag after a long time spent playing it. Hag is easier to get in to and more powerful unless you are a very good huntress. Huntress does however have more powerful add-ons.
---
Seriously ? I thought Ruin, Barbecue and Chilli, Enduring and Spirit Fury is the meta build for Billy.
---
You become even more distressed when you realise you can‚Äôt break it
---
Yeah, as I mentioned, I couldn't bear being in a team with the same people for more than one game. I don't like the pressure continuous association with the same people brings. That's why I am fine with seeing a person once in like 3 or 4 months but not more
---
Have you ever seen Panty an Stocking? The style reminds me of that anime
---
Noed=Double tap?
---
I might be stupid here.
---
But if Nancy was the girl at the end of the movie, then this will make sense.
---
Freddy doesn't want to kill Nancy (because of their relationship). It wouldn't make sense for Freddy to want to kill her in the entitys realm.
---
It could also have to do with licensing, somehow. They had the rights to the 2010 remake, so I can't see a problem with Nancy being added.
---
But, I would believe that it is that Quentin, would fit more. Nancy, truth be told, in the 2010 remake, sucked.
---
I might be super wrong with the first theory, but, I literally just sat and chatted with my friend through the entire movie, I didn't really care. It wasn't that good.
---
I just picked up killer and the ranked reset has scarred me I‚Äôm just getting pounded by swf feelsbadman. It‚Äôs actually so discouraging lol.

Ah, a salty survivor main
---
Same. I switch it out occasionally. But usually the first game after switching it out is a killer with a hex build so I immediately regret it.
---
Or just remap it to F
---
So you will pay respects to yourself when you don‚Äôt get saved :D
---
Ok, but Sloppy won't gonna help you against SWF teams who don't heal and gen rush you for Adrenaline.

---
The only perks i can see working for the killer to TRY and stop gen-rushing are RUIN (of course best perk in the game for killers if it lasts for more then 30 seconds) then maybe i could see Pop Goeas The Weasol, but not more. All other perks you can name are perks that are used AFTER getting the person hooked, so after all the chase, and that it's a matter of how good both parties (killer and survivor) are: if the first survivor that you start chasing after is good and has perks that helps him avoid the killer for a lot of time like Dead Hard, Balance landing (on some map), Lithe ecc. i know for a fact that the other survivors will do 2-3 gens while you have hooked the first survivor. (if you say no to this then we are watching different games) Obviusly i'm not that blind to defend this without looking at the other side: of course if the killer is really good usually the chase end with no gens done or mostly one gen done by the other survivors. 
---
But then comes the fun part: let's say the survivors and the killer are evenly skilled and both use the best perks, we can then assume that a chase for a single hook can end up with only 1 gen done. Now if the killer want to actually win the game the right strategy would be to go interrupts the other survivors that are diong gens and let one of the survivors un-hook in the mantime the dude hanging. (that's usually what happens every game if the killer doesn't camp, fuck them shitty campers killer). Now the killer has 2 choice: go after the injured guy that has been just un-hooked (and that is considered tunneling) or go after the guy that is full health. What would a normal person do? Let's say you want to be "fair" (and in my opinion you shouldn't do this cuz it's not fair for the killer) and go after the healthy guy, you then waste again a lot of time chasing against one survivor that has again all the best perks. What happens? you get him and another gen is done. We are 2 hooks and 2 gens done. Let's repeat the same process and what do we get in the end?  You get 5 hooks (spread among all 4 of survivors so you don't kill anyone) and all gens are done. And this only cuz you didn't tunnel. Let's say you tunnel the first hokked guy: you would be at 3 gens done and 1 guy killed, a way better position for the killer.
---
Now all of this was an exaggerated hypothesis i know, but i just wanted to imagine the best possible scenario for both parties.
---
For the perks you can also use Borrowed time for the hooked survivor and that prolong the chase a lot more for the killer giving more time to do the gens.
---
Let me know your point of view after all of this blabbling i've done, so i can see where you disagree and give me your reasons for them pls
---
Lol me too
---
you're telling this to a red rank killer main with Devotion 12, lad

Do you ever heard about joke?
---
Ashy Slashy baybehhhhg
---
I love that you're getting downvoted. Tru makes a good point here but hes glossong over the fact that:
---
"I dont want to be bullied" = "I want to win with the least effort possible, I only have fun when I win."
---
News flash guys... All killers are viable at red ranks, you just have to work a little harder then if you play Billy/Nurse/Spirit. 
---
If you have to play top tier to win, you're not as good as you think you are.
---
Try morphvox free, it's real time and you can search for a cracked version easily.
---
No man, you dont get it. Its not *HIS* fault that he lost. Its the underpowered killer he chose to play. Why put in more time to improve when you can just hit the easy button and play top tier. 
---
The fragile ego killer is never at fault, its the evil OP survivors.
---
I love playing killer now I used to be a survivor main with my friends, idk if I want to go back lol well I like being the killer for a change and trying to challenge my self is fun!

---
Same here! I‚Äôm rank 9 atm and Freddy is the only killer I somehow always lose to. I put it down to bad luck most of the time üòÇ
---
Is that about my first 30 hours as nurse or what? Lol
---
Sad
---
So why are you on this sub?
---
Must suck to be so pathetic.
---
If you need to play Nurse with a mori to win at this game then I honostly dont understand why you even bother playing.
---
Mary lol. 
---
her name is sally.
---
Yesss she is so fun to play
---
actually in DBD ‚Äòsandbagging‚Äô is used when you block another survivor. throwing a pallet in their face, stopping them from getting to a vault, and generally bodyblocking them so they get hit.
---
When you take a photo with watermarks.
---
Exactly. I only play Plague and Wraith and I have fun while doing it. The other killers just don‚Äôt interest me.
---
"Lad" ? You watched Tru3 too much üòÖ.
---
But how satisfying is it when they run past you because they didn't see you.
---
I think huntress could be harder to play at the beginning, you have not to treat her as an M1 killer or you will lose a lot. But if you play her enough you are going win a lot of games and imo it's the funniest killer to play with. Really the satisfaction you gain hitting with a log distance throw or hitting behind a small crack is too much for me.
---
(I'm huntress and wraith main)
---
Don‚Äôt worry i had the the same situation over and over in my first 20 hours on nurse 
---
After some practice you will rekt everyone so fast that you don‚Äôt get a pip
---
idk but I stopped playing for honor completely recently

Frosty eyes give me the "i bet that killer is running noed" look
---
I was thinking of save the best for last instead.
---
Snares are far more effective than pallets when used correctly since they are not reliant on survivors falling. Pallets can easily be countered by playing the memory game which freddy cant do shit about to prevent. A 15% slow for 3 seconds is far from nothing, they prevents loops round pallets and can stop jungle gym and shack looping when placed and played with correctly. They can also assist freddy with general info and can allow him to catch up to a survivor noticeably faster. A 15% slow means freddy is moveing at 130% speed relative to the slowed survivor (as fast as old legion in frenzy), for even three seconds thats nothing to scoff at.
---
Pallets can only however be used when placed before chase, otherwise the survivor will not fall for them if they do at all. I do agree pallets are more fun and are stronger if survivors are unable to counter them, but i find their unreliabilty puts them down greatly.

---
May have been me! I usually run DS and FH for myself, but I always bring We‚Äôll Make It and Borrowed Time for the team!
---
It‚Äôs going to be rough. I started with killer bc survivor was too frustrating then I had some good and bad games. 
---
One game they sabo all the hooks so even if you down someone you can‚Äôt hook them. One game they just body blocked and flashlights everywhere. 
---
A good streamer that has a TON of teaching tutorials while emphasizing it being toxic is HybridPanda. He teaches you perks, how to run the game as killer, what to pay attention to, etc. 
---
The main important thing is to protect and patrol your gens. You‚Äôll always find them there Bc that‚Äôs the only way to get out and end the game. GL HF!
---
What about reducing the timer then. So that if you chase and hook someone else, the ds is already gone, but if you go straight to the unhooked one, you still get punished?
---
mori's are faster than picking up and hooking, people can bodyblock, DS exists, people can sabo.
---
My friend gets pissed everytime we play against a legion and Killer Instinct activates. I always have to remind him that that's how Legion's ability works, and they're not hacking
---
For Honor is just extremly boring and slow imo. I didnt even finish the Tutorial, cause the combat felt so awkward.
---
I've heard about jokes but yours literally had nothing to do with anything
---
This is more likely to happen than that meme lol
---
I hate playing against legion too. Can‚Äôt get anything done with him running around. As long as he stabs a different survivor each time, his feral frenzy kind of resets/gains. It‚Äôs so annoying.
---
Thanks, Farmer John is actually a huge inspiration to me
---
Oh wait i added my comment to wrong post xDDD
---
I would give the edge to Huntress, on paper, because Hag has more direct ways of being counterplayed. Smart survivors will keep harassing her traps, nullifying much of her setting-up progress, and the traps are not too potent in chases if not already set - a survivor can leave the tile while she's setting a trap, allowing other survivors to yet again waste them. And even a trapped tile can be played, if you know where the trap is, which you obviously do if she set it mid-chase. Then there are flashlights and crouching. The only real abuse of a similar level that Huntress can be subjected to is survivors taking advantage of distance against her, which is not always possible, and on some maps barely ever. Her recent lullaby changes have also made that tactic less reliable.
---
In practice, survivors are not often smart or coordinated enough to play around Hag effectively (for a simple example, most random survivors never actively seek out traps to pop while Hag is otherwise occupied - hell, they don't even pop traps they know for a fact are there while Hag is carrying a survivor, i. e. while they are basically guaranteed to be safe), and they mostly play right into her strengths of snowballing off of hooks. Huntress is a lot easier to "understand", and so randoms are at least more conscious of her weaknesses and how to generally play against her, making her a tougher character to play, on average.

I wish it was like final fantasy 14 where all you need to do is buy the license for a platform and just bind it to your account and then you can access it from your account with all your stuff on whatever platform/s you own
---
i thought this was common sense tbh
---
Any killer could have just moved to the side of the survivor and just hit the person who got unhooked. You just got farmed by those people. I don‚Äôt think everyone should look for hex ruin either because that basically halts the entire game. Two people can power through a gen when working together while at least one other person is searching for the hex.
---
I would like to point out it's 24 meters not 32, make your choice is 32.
---
I'd love for this to exist as well along with cross play though I don't think it will for a while. If it does it will come after the dedicated servers are launched. It is a good sign that BHVR is investing in them so late in the games life and speaks to how the game is growing still.
---
Hahahah I laugh so evil right now. Cause I legit (yes downvote me please) tried to get rid of a killer by running to my teammates, using them as a distraction. Because some killers are way too good for me. üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And whenever I do this, I always laugh so evil lol. Makes me laugh even now hahaha ffs.

Was about to say... I don't mind versing Nurses, especially when they're either of middling skill or, if they're actually good and would rather play with their food rather than go for the 1 minute wipe... I'd probably get a bit more luck on ps4 for that part!
---
Yeah that was me lol, I literally just wanted to kill the survivor that left him for dead, but then this happened, I was laughing my butt off when I re-watched his stream.
---
We‚Äôre both salty, take the post into account here

I dont even understand why i cant see them anymore. I used to be good at unfocusing my eyes...

---
Shirtless Freddy
---
Well it really depends on the killer, killers like nurse/hillbilly will make doing gens much harder with their map presence while other killers such as the leatherface will get gen rushed because he just can't keep up.
---
If someone just got unhooked in front of me I would down the hooked person and slug them and then go after the healthy one to ensure that one person has to come help the downed person leaving only one person to do a gen. If they have borrowed time you can just hit them to force them to mend.
---
Even if you were to get gen rushed, you could still potentially use stuff like moris and NOED.
---
Also usually from my experience of playing, hex ruin tends to be the last totem I can never find until at least three people have been hooked.
---
It all boils down to skill really, if the killer does not know his loops then he will get gen rushed due to prolonged chases, there are certain ways killers deal with certain loops like L/T walls and long walls to ensure survivors do not get many loops out of them, if they don't know this its certain they will get gen rushed.

Yes, there was a bug that reset your entire account back in the day.  It didn't get fixed for ages.  If you ever see someone mention thst they "lost their legacy skins", that was from that.  The bug went unfixed for many months, and BHVR still hasn't figured out a way to restore people's legacy skins. 
---
If possible, I'd suggest playing killer for a little bit and seeing if you have the same issues there.  If not, it may be time to buckle down and play that side for a while until the bug is fixed.  It may also be worthwhile to investigate your router stuff and your peer to peer settings in there just to see if the "bug" may be originating there.  Maybe dedicated servers will solve it (and may be what BHVR is waiting for before addressing the bug).
---
It's a randon stock photo I found in the r/wtfstockfotos

---
I tell myself it‚Äôs for NOED, because it is incredibly satisfying when you check their load out afterwards and see what a difference to the game you made, especially when you‚Äôre running Small Game, so you feel some weird responsibility to get all dull totems. 
---
But I really am such a slut for maxing everything out like fuck me up.

I will cleanse totems so that killer can‚Äôt get NOED if were doing bad.

I use hope instead of adren, it's a better counter to no one escapes skill &amp; most pallets are probably gone at end game so it gets me to loops (or vaults/t-walls/anything) faster that still have em.
---
I use billy with noed:) cuz i struggle with chainasw at close range
---
Yeh
---
Yea, I don‚Äôt even know the last time I ran into a billy with NOED. Definitely one of the more rare perk choices for him.
---
Try controller it's much better, you only really wanna go with mouse &amp; keyboard if you wanna get down no speed delay on guards. That's why i play on console, in my opinion, i find PC really slow in comparison. But i play on both so i got used to the speed difference.

Better yet, all of those but the bloodpoints are only awarded to the last survivor to leave the trial.

---
If Tapp were the same height and build as he is in the films, he'd be mistaken for a killer pretty often.
---
It doesn't make you worse, but it can make it seem like everybody you play with/against is worse. If you're used to playing against rank 1-5 players and you get dropped back down to level 20, all of a sudden you could be playing with/against new players who don't know what they're doing.
---
Rank reset is also hard for new  players who could be playing against former high ranked players who dropped back down the ranks and they end up getting wrecked.
---
Hahaha gotta love when things work out like that.

It looked hilarious when we all began to scream at the same time.

I remember hearing that calm spirit is actually detrimental, since it prevents you from screaming, including when you scream on the second phase of the hook, giving you less time to be unhooked.

You will learn so much watching streamer videos on twitch or YouTube.  I've seen a few names bounced around here Monto and Hybridpanda but honestly I'd highly recommend Truetalents YouTube channel.  The thing with Monto is he does almost purely gimmick build videos many of which rely on NOED and rare addons and Panda while a very nice guy simply isn't a particularly good killer.  True has an insane amount of videos for every killer and goes out of his way midgame to Breakdown mindgame and anti-loop techniques as he does them.  He does a great job explaining things that are insanely helpful to new players.  He uploads like 14 new ones a day or some ridiculous shit lol.  I've watched most of the leading content creators over the years but his are what I found the most helpful for helping to develop my killer game.
---
I remember trying to search for a cracked version of that earlier but I'll try again today. It's a solid software
---
Rank reset doesn't fully "reset" you though. A former red rank would have been placed around rank 10-12. The 16-20 range is almost exclusively for new players, even after reset.

After you hit a survivor, they get a brief period of invulnerability. I had this happen to me when I hot a survivor and they ran right over a trap

You can easily pip with moris. If you hook everyone once before you start using a mori odds are you‚Äôll get enough emblem points to pip.

This is assuming your in green ranks or below, which most are after rank reset

God the other day I was playing on Ironworks and I was chasing this brightly colored Meg through the Ironworks loop. I hit her as she vaults the window and I can fucking *see her brightly colored hair peeking out of the other side of the window* as I vault. (To say nothing of the fact that I can hear her loud-ass Meg pain noises.) I vault the window and of course she tries to slow vault behind me. Immediately turn around and grab her.

I dunno, after finally playing the Saw video game I'm kinda glad we got Tapp. Also one of the devs commented on a Paulie Esther video awhile back and said that originally it was intended to be Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) but it didn't work out for whatever reason so they went with Tapp instead
---
The two loudest survivors in the game. Jeff has better perks and Asthma so I would pick him. Both are dummy thicc though.
---
Got a nord hillbilly Yesterday and because of trash hit boxes he hit me but the game didn't recognize the hit so i escaped. He stood still for a while looking at me After that bullshit hit and i thought he was gonna dc. In the end i got out and everyone insulted him for having nord on Billy.
---
I feel you, I'm trying to learn the game right now as well. Every game I'm getting matched with people who have been playing for years, I learn nothing cause I'm just getting styled on every game, then after each game, people are just being toxic assholes.   
---
This whole rank reset thing is garbage, they should at least have a new player lobby system, or casual game mode, where new players can finally actually learn the game. Or better yet, why not have placement matches at the start of each month? So at least new players can try and get matched with people on their level quicker and hopefully be able to learn the game, before getting turned off by how harsh this game is on new players.  
---
Seriously, how the fuck am I mean't to do anything against a whole team of survivors with full perks, when I',m just a baby killer with fuck all who hasn't even had enough time to learn how to do anything.

Mouse 1 occasionally doesn't register. Killers won't attack/survivors won't repair generators until repeated clicking. This does not happen to me in any other game (e.g. Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Subnautica)/when I use the mouse when I'm not playing games, so I'm inclined to believe it's dbd's fault. 
---
I'll be getting a new mouse in about a week's time, and then I can see if the problem persists, but until then playing killer is pure frustration (survivor is somewhat doable). If anyone else has a similar problem/knows the cause, some help would be much appreciated.
---
NO, I FUCKING WANTED DETECTIVE MATTHEWS SO BAD ;-; but I still think Tapp wasn‚Äôt the best choice considering he wasn‚Äôt really a long term character so he lacked personality and didn‚Äôt really feel like an iconic saw character where as strahm or Matthews were more identifiable characters
---
I dress my Feng according to my rank, so green outfit for green ranks, purple for purple and that red lunar dress seems appropriate for red ranks. ;)
---
I think it's an underrated perk. Not just for totems for traps too. Especially at higher ranks when everyone has ruin and noed.

When people can accept the fact that a piece of the pie is luck, they'll be less salty when things don't go their way.
---
Use a controller then. You don't need a mouse and keyboard for the game.
---
So far I played the gen teleportation helps in chases more than the fake pallets/traps do.
---
you can run any perks you want, but if you run NOED you suck and should stay at high ranks like the noob you are
---
yeah it's rough, i've been playing for almost a year now and I still feel like I'm just getting worse and worse no matter what I do.
---
You assume a survivor can always make it to a loop before he's already chainsaw sprinting. If the loop is a part of a jungle gym ie window, with a pallet close by there's always that risk of getting sawed before he can start the loop and make it hard for him to chainsaw w/o instasaw.
---
"Rank 20 survivors" aren't the only ones that think Billy is strong(not BROKEN, strong). Just about every red rank killer streamer I've seen who has a fundamental understanding of how red rank survivors play say Billy is strong. The only thing that beats him is Nurse and(debatably) Spirit.
---
well I dont have a Controller, as I only play on PC
---
Adrenaline is godtier in SWF or otherwise higher ranks where survivors are much more orginized. I agree in rank 10 or above it's almost trash tier.
---
I don‚Äôt think it is. Even if it was, Netflix don‚Äôt own it. Why would that even be a thing?
---
Excited for Laurie‚Äôs cosmetics! Oh wait.
---
OOTL but how did Dwarf Keanu meme started?
---
That doesn't excuse yourself from getting one. An Xbox wired controller are cheap to get alongside PS4 controllers as well.
---
NOED, Devour Hope, Haunted Ground, and Rancor with speed limiter. Everything EXCEPT the chainsaw is an instant down. They'll never see it coming.
---
I have been playing since just before legion(so not that long) and i barely played killer until about a week or two ago.
---
Ok, makes sense. Hope you're having fun at least!
---
I have been! It‚Äôs honestly a wonderful game and i can usually get friends to go on at least once if i try hard enough, which just makes it better.
---
PC, ps4 or xbox?
---
I say make it where you see the hatch from 16m away or make it kinda like directional perk where if you're looking towards the hatch it'll be lit up, or make it where you can hear it farther away
---
He correctly responded to a completly different argument
---
We did it guys normal gameplay no more
---
Yeah that would work too and it might even be better than my ideaüòÇ
---
Uhhh...not to my knowledge. I don‚Äôt think any killer can mori without a perk like devour hope or an add on like Myers tombstone or an offering. That sounds odd...
---
But I could be wrong.
---
I want this!!!!!
---
Me and my friends call her "Country Bi".
---
Spooky space kook as dbd next killer.
---
I do love me some Bloodpoints.  
---
I've stopped caring about my rank - I care about Bloodpoints.   And I've found that it upsets me so much more when I get like 6k BP from a bad game.  lol.  
---
MY BLOODPOINTS.
---
I thought it might have been serious, because someone else also mentioned Wraith.
---
I reported him after the match because I looked it up and found nothing on being able to Mori without some kind of offering or perk.
---
What does ‚Äùy‚Äù mean?
---
This is honestly the creepiest thing I've seen in a long time.
---
make it a licensed characters perk then nerf it two weeks after release
---
To see them aliens
---
Good, fuck you. Toxic POS.
---
Thank you. That really clears things up. :)
---
Vigilantes might have been a better word for it. Cause I mean, I do it, I don't consider it toxic, I guess I'm trying to appeal to both sides here
---
It's really satisfying, until the totem breaks right when the Killer passes you. Then all the sudden you have a  Killer running at you like a heat seeking missile.
---
Just happened to me again... My Swf (8,4,10,15) against a rank 19 killer. We don't even play toxic, we just get out as fast as possible.
---
Bamboozle on Nurse.
---
That only happens 8/10 times üòÇ
---
Really just a dumb Billy with no reaction time LUL
---
That strat will work until purple ranks, everything above (meaning red) will anticipate it and won't get baited by it. You'll just lose your map pressure if you use it in a chase. Especially since atm you can't tell which direction you'll be facing post-teleport.  
---
What will work in every rank though is if you know a surv is on a gen, you can walk there and when you're getting closer, fake teleporting. They will primarely watch the gen and not their surroundings, giving you the ability to have them running straight into your hands. Ofc rank 1's will anticipate that too at some point, but that opens up mindgames. Combine with tinkerer for even better mindgames.
---
Well, first they point the flashlight at his face. Then, they turn the flashlight on. After a couple of seconds, the killer will be blinded.
---
Sounds like your friend, and my friend, would get along.
---
watch good players like trutalent to get a better idea of how the game works at higher ranks
---
We've also been asking for other weak killers to be buffed and for survivors to have more to do for years now. Instead, they're working on Head On and adjusting BP gains for survivors.
---
The Freddy rework is great, but it took a looong time for them to get there. Not to mention that this is just a shitpost.

No, you're just a basic fucking loser. Fuck off.
---
I desire Freddy with some sick shades
---
The fuck you part cracked me üòÇüòÇ
---
you are wrong
---
No, the game is Survivors vs Killer. Killers are actively punished for letting survivors go, and are granted extra points if none escape. It's up to each side to make the game enjoyable for themselves. You shouldn't try to ruin the experience for someone else, but you sure as hell dont have to play differently to not annoy the other side.
---
I‚Äôm talking about people who say that killers are way too op, just because they were killed by a ghost face because they were outplayed. Those kind of people are the complainers I‚Äôm talking about.
---
"I can look at myself naked"
---
Dude I'm going to be so slutty on those totems once the update happens
---
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. He's one of the villians.
---
~~Jokes aside you'd be surprised how many Killers will automatically assume you have Borrowed Time if you go for a stupidly risky unhook. The great irony of Borrowed is that since it's so common a lot of Killers just automatically assume you have it.~~
---
As a Feng main I agree
---
Sure, buddy! We al know people that argue against an actual dictionary are always right, right?  
---
Well this is the internet, so why am I even surprised...
---
but you have to rely on that boldness to use the perk effectively, still: if it works, its pretty fun. I used to put devour hope on michael and got accused of hacking with infinite tier 3 even though I don‚Äôt have the addon.
---
Hahaha I love rank reset
---
"Fuck you" Lmfao. Good one.
---
They don't work on gens even when they know you're being chased
---
Hey, somebody put a good explanation on here.  I can admit when I'm wrong
---
Tell him to make more please.
---
You just gotta git gud
---
I actually had a flashlight and teabagged a legion, they have a video but i have no contact info from them to get it.
---
Calm the fuck down, Jesus
---
From 2016 up until about 4 months ago I was using a 680 to play dbd. I unlocked fps, turned off vsync blah, blah. However in the game user settings folder the biggest help was changing effects level from 3 to 0. It got me an extra 15 fps and kept me above 60 on medium resolution 100% without making the game look like garbage. Also, running afterburner and setting a decent fan curve prevented any throttling and stuttering I was experiencing also. (I have a 2080 now and I just keep it on ultra still with a fan curve, gpu usage is always at 83%)
---
If I see a key Franklin's gets equipped.
---
Why not? Even if you get pulled out of it you might get lucky and pull a free hit off because of the lack of terror radius
---
Now, I‚Äôm not an evolutionist, but I feel it would be a good example of ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù taking its course.
---
10/10 Perfect!Bonus points for teabagging at legion mains too!
---
I'm fine with the way they work, just not how common they are on the bloodweb. I can go 20 bloodwebs without getting party streamers, but I see a red Mori pretty much every web. It's ridiculous.

---
Do you play on PS4? Cause this may have been me accidentally killing the Feng a month ago.
---
You just said something and immediatly after it dissagreed with your own statement. Just let them play how they want. If they are in red ranks with NOED, they still deserve to be in red ranks, it's a perk and they are allowed to use it.
---
I thought I was doing a pretty gud job, so far
---
you look like Mark Ruffalo

*as quietly as possible* Im new to the sub, what does sweaty mean? Tryhard?

No, I don't think I will. Fuck off.

Because weebs

Yo, you should definitely try Pop Goes The Weasel with his rework. Apparently it's pretty good!

Long life to Miss piggy our lord and savoir, best killer. Also Amanda is bae

Yo I do the same thing! But my friends dont know they just don't...

With the mid chapter update!

Meme: Exists
---
u/TuckzyBoi : Here is my story hope you guys like it.
---
July 23rd, I think?
---
It really should take in to account hours played to calculate regression and minimum cap.
---
Like a player with 2k hours should cap at 10 no matter how much they DC or how many seasons they don't play. 
---
A player with 6k+ plus hours should never be regressed beyond 6.
---
Xbox. I plan on getting a pc soon though so i can at least play the PTB.
---
Surprised the killer didn‚Äôt DC honestly
---
Consider this: Dwight being a switch
---
I find it funny how people put ".TTV" in their name and then complain about being stream sniped. Like dude, if you're going to advertise your stream to everyone, your basically asking to get stream sniped.

I appreciate it

Have you heard of bbq&amp;chili on the nurse? Pretty op and underplayed /s

even when i look down at their scratch marks i still lose them
---
This is super fkn cute. I love that side smile.
---
*laughs in Doctor*
---
Nice! Thanks!
---
borrowed time isn‚Äôt a good perk unless you use it right tbh, it gives survivors an excuse to farm each other
---
Where did they say this?
---
Could be great!
---
Sad thing is that‚Äôs reality
---
Gotcha. I was in a SWF a month ago and accidentally did this to a friend of mine because I thought the leatherface was done with his power. I still haven't lived this one down.
---
I did see Myers several times with NoED. It always causes great confusion in me.
---
I also saw people claiming on reddit that running NoED on Myers is a mind game
---
You're right about learning the directions, one could do that. We'll see after he's released and how he changed until then, atm I'm not convinced that using it for securing a hit in a chase is worth it in most cases, simply because of its long cooldown. I'll defintely try to use it here and there, but I'm not expecting it to work often.
---
I mean.  I see that happen often.   So why not. 
---
I guess I went over board in saying. ‚ÄúRelatable‚Äù
---
All perks are subject to change, licensed or not
---
Deviation 12? My god have you been playing since release?
---
Thanks feng

It would be nice if we could get a better look at the weapon, even if it is secondary to the outfit.

Hag+MYC is pretty disgusting. I don't see many Hags in my games though.
---
That awkward moment where every bit of shrapnel flies between her severed body parts, except for the bits that lodge in her other shoulder. Then she drops you and moris you cuz you a bitch.
---
Ikr, rank 20s were the reason Freddy was originally nerfed. :(
---
well, good luck cleansing totems if you play with randoms cause its going to be one hell of a ride
---
Surveillance + Overcharge. 
---
Lets you actually pressure gens.  With repeated kicks and missed skill checks you can actually regress gens, and when the surv's DO hit the check, they dont expect the killer to still return immediately.
---
Great on Pig and Ghostface to get the jump on survivors with dash/stalk. Lots of free hits.
---
Birb
---
&gt;Ignore the David/Hag kiss.
---
I can't!
---
You're dead wrong in your tracks- Billy's chainsaw is easy as fuck to juke on bad Billys and very fun to bait out at pallets, but good Billys are scary as fuck. They will still get a chainsaw at shack or any common tile if they know their timing on corners and reach for the windows. Not to mention Billy's chainsaw isn't meant to get you a chainsaw every time, but the threat of it allows you to make survivors behave certain ways, get zoned out, take free hits.
---
Good survivors will force Billy into an M1 killer, but good survivors also understand they aren't running against a Wraith. They still very much have to consider the instadown threat, and know where billy can catch distance
---
Thanks? Why pray?
---
Doesn't matter. Fuck you too. That's all this game is anymore.
---
I'd just make Left Behind so you could re-open the hatch like you open the gate - maybe throw some difficult skill checks in (in fairness to the killer).

Play on PS4, then there's no text channel for them to bitch on.

Okay, I saw a lot of odd complains on this subreddit but wtf is wrong with the rank reset?

PC users literally have to use easyanticheat. Idk if you don't play on pc and just have no idea, or...

no, Devotion was introduced a year ago with the Clown.
---
I run hex haunted groud rofl, try again
---
petrified oak is a trash offering in the first place, even when there‚Äôs four it doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference haha
---
Yeah, honestly, people who still run NOED suck ass
---
Good name
---
It's pretty frustrating to see all the twitch streamers underestimate his teleport so much, they only use it to Pop the Weasel after hooking someone, whilst completely relying on his Dream Pallet. Although I wish the cooldown at the start of the match and in general would be decreased from like 45 seconds to 40, and give him viability in the endgame as well.
---
why would I buy a console Controller, just to play a PC Game, I *might* enjoy
---
/s my dude
---
Tier 4 madness
---
I have to give the edge to Huntress personally. Hag's power can be totally be countered once she has been identified huntress not as much
---
well I agree that NOED is overly used by killers that need it or endgame builds, or builds in general ( insta down or random perk wheels ) I have seen people use it for a few other reasons (not many perks, wanting to try it out, etc.) My point here is: it‚Äôs a perk you should consider as danger if you are not sure about the perks of the killer you are playing against. And also I understand the frustration of getting your game ‚Äúruined‚Äù by NOED, but I never took facecamping into account for my argument. Sure its hella unfun, but the killer can do whatever he wants and use the perks he wants, just as the survivors. That is how it is and trust me, I hate that playstyle as much as you do, but it exists. Then I usually mention in the endgame chat that the facecamp was pretty mean, but I don‚Äôt insult the killer for it. Because sgain: As far as the killer‚Äôs skill cap (configured by his playsryle, addons, perks and game sense) goes, he makes the rules.
---
For me it's swf too.
---
I hate it when lazy developers inject memes or quotes into their game that don't make any fucking sense. It's just stupid.
---
I mean the question is that will the ability trigger because of the survivor that the killer is carrying into the basement?
---
ahahahahahüòÇüòÇ
---
We don‚Äôt need Ted, the clowns just John Wayne gacey minus the children
---
It might be because he is or has a similar mental disability or disorder. 
---
Watch the movies or read up on his story.
---
no problem, I love making these
---
It's unfortunate that the only and best solution is to become numb to what people say.
---
I‚Äôm kinda new so this was big for me but I‚Äôm finally getting good at looping and looped a Ghostface for about 2 gens :)
---
I feel like huntress players almost always camp
---
I gotta wonder if you can slide across the pallets and maybe knock the killer out of it, since it is a hit/hurt box?
---
NOED and haunted grounds are not remotely the same thing, one gives you +5% speed + exposed status until the totem is cleansed, the other gives the exposed status for 60s. You‚Äôll still get looped dumbass
---
He has AirPods, he cant hear us oh no oh god
---
I got the achievement with a skeleton key so that may work
---
What game is this? I‚Äôve never played anything else than dbd
---
Aw man, Super Freddy suuuucks.
---
there it is, the insults. AGAIN: My point is, that NOED is a perk that exists within the game and there is no reason whatsoever to insult people who run it. The argument ‚ÄúYou are a terrible kiler, oh my god you need noed to win‚Äù is based purely on frustration. Sure the perk is known to be used by not so good killers in order to clutch, but it is a valid perk to use. Saying Noed is a perks for dickheads is like saying as a killer that thing like insta heals or ds are for people who cannot win otherwise. Everything is valid within the game, every side is using tools in order to accomplish their objective, be so cheeky and mean. Spraying salt in the endgame chat because you lost to a perk/item/addon just shows your frustration and that you like to bring yourself and others down because if a ingame mechanic. Of course I understand the frustration and the anger, but there is no reason to insult the killer/survivor and be nothing but a dick at the end if the game.
---
Not even close, that free haste and insta-down on EVERYONE? Beter than just being able to kill one guy
---
The threat of the chainsaw will get you kills, but he is right. I can link a vod of arguably one of the best billys in the world getting absolutely shit on multiple rounds in a row by top tier survivors who know how to run. The threat of the chainsaw means that survivors have to stick to cover and take M1s when on other killers they could have sponged a hit in the open to get distance, but very rarely do you get the opportunity to utilize the chainsaw for an instant down.
---
Using a macro has improved my quality of life so much

I always use small game personally. Without it I feel naked.
---
You joke, but I would actually use a Shirtless (Chest Of Souls) Freddy cosmetic because [it looks wicked](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/bH0AAOSwL1RcvyW-/s-l640.jpg). BHVR pls.
---
That‚Äôs a lag switch if I ever saw one.
---
&gt; allows stealth to be a truly viable playstyle at rank 1
---
Unless you're playing in like brazilian servers, stealth is totally unviable at rank 1. Any killer worth their salt can hear you through walls (they play volume cranked up and can hear very light breathing/ grass rustling) on top of running perks like whispers or BBQ. If you're immersed and you successfully hide like 1 time they know not to bother, cause by the endgame you'll either yoink hatch or be downed instantly in a chase the moment you're found.
---
&gt;People just get pissy because you die
---
I mean, *the* most fun and interesting matches I've ever had almost always involve me dying, or going out on a limb against a killer I fully understand the behaviour of and seeing just how much I get how they play.
---
NOED is just flat out boring because if the killer finds mileage out of it, they flat out don't understand fundamentals of chases or gen pressure. Yeah it can be fun to loop them till kingdom come, but then comes the point they hook you in basement endgame cause there's no playing around their speedboost without shitloads of pallets still left up, and your teammates go "Nope, not dealing with basement NOED" and leave, or stick around to try and do stupid saves because "fuck this killer for running NOED let's see if we can pull something off"
---
This got me. Have a upvote.
---
make them easier to put down as currently they just refuse to be put down sometimes
---
increase the range at which you can put them down a bit
---
increase the slow to 20%
---
Save The Best For Last is seriously underrated for M1 killers. Great on Freddy, Leatherface, Trapper etc.
---
Yeah, just imagine how scary this game would be, if they added something like "watchers of the entity" and it would be like shadow people just watching you from behind a rock or a tree and if you get closer they would just disappear.
---
Freddy is weak against loops
---
She looks like a thumb
---
Save The Best For Last is seriously underrated for M1 Killers, I combo it with Rancor.
---
"Psst. Hey kid, ya want some hexes?"
---
You didn‚Äôt play civilization, that‚Äôs why
---
You can get it on killer try a red killer add on
---
What happened to Ash? I haven't played in a bit so I didn't know his perks changed
---
Maybe if I get around to it!
---
What was the PSN of this person? I just went against a t-bagging Claudette that DC'd as soon as she was hooked and she had the same profile picture. I'm really curious if it is the same one lol.
---
BHVR is getting pretty sneaky
---
I love this it is one of the reasons i play hag. "Mint Rag"
---
Again as a survivor I agree that its an annoying perk that pisses me off but give a killer a way to stop gen rushing besides Ruin cause I always seem to find ruin in the first 2 minutes of a match. Survivor is way too easy now days cause I simply do dull totems when I see them, and gen rush. So a killer can maybe get a down by the time we pop two gens. My swf can seriously bully killers to the point one of us dies simply cause the killer camped him because he got 1 down by the time we did 3 gens. 80 seconds for a gen solo with good skillchecks. (not accounting for great skill checks which are super common at red ranks)  two hits around a strong loop can take about a minute, minute and a half? somewhere around there. Or god forbid the killer shack and the god pallet. Unless a survivor is really bad, or the killer is nurse or spirit, a survivor could loop for minutes. My record was 5 minutes, though that was during rank reset and it was a leatherface who kept revving his chainsaw. Rank ranks are insanely punishing. Chase a survivor, well lose a up to three gens in the first two minutes. My point isnt that I like the perk, its the only way to get a kill against a gen rushing SWF without being toxic and camping or tunneling them.
---
Top right üòç
---
Closing chat is always an option btw.
---
I died to his second Mori.
---
The Entity: ‚Äúwait, thats illegal.‚Äù‚Äô
---
At rank 12 yeah, Adrenaline isn't gonna see much mileage.
---
At rank 1 with just like 3 people who mildly know how to loop and coordinate which gens to pop, it's without question in top 3.
---
Idk what other 10 perks you have on that list, unless you're one of those gamers who run any combination of sprint burst/ self care/ urban evasion near rank 1.
---
i could have sworn they did, it must have been the survivor logic in me LOL
---
BHVR: Let me see what you have
---
Bill: A ***~~KNIFE~~***  *GUN!*
---
BHVR: NO!
---
It's a zero time healthstate, just like Adrenaline. That extra hit you can tank lets you put extra distance between the killer and your entire team scrambling for exits or strong tiles
---
Thought you were Joe Russo for a sec.
---
Poor running guy :D
---
There is also a cap to the distance between hooks. You will never see hooks touching the edges of the map.
---
not if the survivor with borrowed time is already injured and goes down instantly
---
Granny needs some love too
---
Well it's rank reset right now, so not having to deal with red ranks. It's super fun right now haha.
---
Yeah for a while I ran dead hard + hope cause in regular matches I'm still pretty much running an extra health state, and against NOED I can actually use dead hard since adrenaline didn't cuck my exhaustion
---
went against a Billy who face camped be because I "was too laggy" (even though I was dodging his chainsaws fairly) and later in the game he had NOED. 
---
Then he tried to defend himself, but there is nothing redeemable about face camping someone you outplayed you and using NOED.
---
Capitalise and punctuate. Capitalise and punctuate! How hard is this to do?! My girlfriend who is studying linguistics on Oxford would kick some ass if she went on Reddit and saw all the comments like this one. Not using correct capitalison and punctuaction makes you look juvenile and your comment spammy. So please, remove it before further embarrassementüòÇ.
---
Sure, but that's on the guy saving- people getting the BT effect will kind of understand "hey I have to tank the hit"
---
I dont really feel like it i, I rather focus on get all the perks on my killers as quickly as I can
---
well his mettle of man perk was really good at first. if you took 3 hits from a killer the next hit that would put you in the dying stat would not work so essentially it gave you an extra hit 
---
with the downside is that it only worked once and if you healed yourself after using it then your aura would be exposed to the killer for the rest of the match so the killer would always know where you were. 
---
but people complained like they did with DS so the devs destroyed that perk like they did DS 
---
now it only works if you take 3 hits for someone else which is much harder to pull off and not as useful
---
If you're buying characters only for blatantly overpowered perks with the expectation that they will never be balanced then that's on you.
---
lol No, it's survivor vs internet connection, get real. Most of the bullshit hits are because of lag and stupid hitboxes. It's lag when you get hit 2 steps after a vault and BHVR blames it on the Host to divert any blame for their stupid mechanics.
---
yeah, it gives new survivors an excuse to farm each other which i said in my original comment haha
---
Playing devil‚Äôs advocate here: neither side is going to be happy. On the other end, not all players are like this. Honestly, play survivor to think like a survivor and killer will be no problem. I don‚Äôt camp, proxy or do anything that ignites trash talking. It‚Äôs all because I know what their next move is. Just don‚Äôt become part of the problem. There‚Äôs no need to retaliate. Have fun :)
---
Mettle of man got nerfed after a lot of red rank killers complained about it. It was would make safe unhooks and protection hits add stacks. Which was good as the killer could notice and then counter play. It then got nerfed again, to only protection hits, which half the time don‚Äôt even register, so it‚Äôs pretty much unusable without an extremely precise set of events lmao
---
As a survivor main I'm sorry. I'm not toxic in any way and I don't condone the people who are obnoxious or rude.
---
Is... Is it still black-face if it's a literal black person's face?
---
So fucking true
---
Wait is that why I could pick the doctor?
---
This better be fucking real.
---
Oh that's dumb. I'm a killer main and I never had issues with the OG MoM. I just smacked em again lol
---
sorry lol, i just see survivors farm me all the time because they have BT and it gets annoying
---
I run that on my Hag. Lets me get in close enough for a free hit most of the time!
---
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.
---
Yeah nothing funnier than unnecessary swear words... you could have at least bothered to censor it. There are kids on this website. Just recently my daughter saw a disgusting comment on Reddit with an incredible amount of swear words and she asked me what they meant. I had to tell her to go to bed and I took her phone away for a couple of months. All because some selfish person couldn't control themselves. Not only that swearing is annoying and makes me downvote you but it's also sinful. So people should really think carefully before the next time they swear profusely. Your comment wasn't **that** bad but you should still remove it.
---
What are you confused about? It‚Äôs a quote from spongebob that they changed up a bit. It‚Äôs distinct ad not obvious that‚Äôs what makes it funny when you see it.

Nurse and Nea, Doctor and Feng, Hag and Ace and Huntress and David are all free on console.
---
Fuck no. 
---
You‚Äôd see three blink nurse versus four survivors every game. It would be the worst game for esports, without question.

Making a big ass comment on a very short, and innocent comment makes you look like an asshole! :)

Welcome to Reddit

kids on a subreddit for an M rated game. Chuh
---
Okay...
---
Another PC exclusive :(
---
That's a really messed up way of looking at anything.
---
Killers: fucking gen rush survivors
---
Also killers: how dare these survivors try to play in a way other then gen rushing
---
Only a Rank 15, just looking to get better :) PS4 US: CompPlease-_-
---
Good bait.
---
It's a troll, pls don't take him seriously.
---
Just ignore them. They are a troll. (I think? Or just really, really sad considering their posts)
---
Holy shit Wesley didn't expect to see you in dbd, keep up the good work sir.
---
I see this a lot when survivors get sacrificed.
---
Ah, the famous Wesley Ford, the troll that seems to be everywhere on Reddit and get's everyone mad
---
Yes
---
Capitalison and punctuaction
---
Get ready to rank up the social links of your fellow survivors! ‚ô•
---
\-Give them Items!
---
\-Take hits for them!
---
\-Emote with them!
---
\-Or be toxic and have your friendship stuck in a rut!
---
Level up the Arcana of your fellow survivors to gain special benefits and perks!
---
And get ready to face the palace of the "Entity"! And the fearsome Persona's that dwell within!
---
They will either kill you...or you may befriend them!
---
You must be tired after the match... Let's go to the campfire!
---
You seem fun
---
This isn‚Äôt even good trolling.

Plague with Play With Your Food and Thanatophobia ^_^
---
Honestly would love this character being in.
---
I obviously know this is a meme but having skill checks as a mouse button and struggling with the scroll wheel is 1000x better than the space bar
---
What the fuck
---
It depends, for cosmetic purposes only really. It's supposed to make better things show up on your bloodweb but I haven't really seen any difference there.
---
Adrenaline allows you to just ignore healing for the rest f the game if there are 3 or fewer gens left. It's a crazy strong perk.
---
Give it up folks, einstein over here has something to say. What's that buddy? Wha- A grammatical error?!? WHAT?!? B... Bu... That can't be possible! Surely not! A GRAMMAR MISTAKE? IN MY SIGHT?!?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cd509f/glitch_with_keyboard/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Oh it wasnt against you, the guy im referring to started this small thread saying that you should stay in high ranks if you run NOED. Im a rank 1 survivor and I rarely see a 4 kill now days. I was being sarcastic saying that our only counters to killers makes you noob like apparently this guy thinks NOED does. I simply think gen rushing is such a strong strat nowdays because in a perfect game, we all spawn separate and each start a gen, and the killer finds one of us in the first minute and gets looped for a minute before finally downing the survivor. By the time he hooks him, that has been 80 seconds of three people sitting on gens. (not accounting for great skill checks which are hit about 60% of the time at rank 1.) soooo one hook and three gens done. NOT A SINGLE COUNTER BESIDES RUIN! Like even then, you wasted like another 2 minutes finding the totem. So thats time for another hook. 2 hooks in the time it takes to do 3 gens. Now again, this is a perfect scenario but has happened plenty of times for my and my SWF group. I've spawned directly next to the ruin totem before and finished that off in the first 30 seconds of the match. Like how is that fair? There should be another way to keep a hex totem on the map or prevent it from being cleansed so early or at the very least add a mechanic that makes it slower to repair gens for the first couple minutes of a match.
---
For killers I'd say no , unless you're a collector and want all cosmetics otherwise it's not worth it on killer in my personal opinion as the chances of better add ons in the bloodweb is not noticeable
---
Idk.
---
But then I have no free arms with which to skrrt and hit the dab.
---
It‚Äôs the epic funny man with his cool copypasta you guys.
---
You say that like it's a bad thing.
---
I mean, yeah, most of the times, the extra hit doesn't get them to the next loop, and even when it does, it doesn't matter, since perks have purposes
---
I'm sorry are there other reasons to buy survivors other than their perks?
---
What's the original source of this image?
---
Replace Spirit Fury with Rancor and that should be good until you get more perks.
---
As trapper I see it all the time when resetting traps
---
Iron Maiden on Nurse. 
---
I loop the killer near my friend while she has Stakeout and Spine Chill.
---
I meant drawing and not dreaming also I meant mine and not man
---
Cause it‚Äôs me favorite perk
---
[Huh...](http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/KpnNFksPmWwyk/giphy.gif)
---
Nice man
---
how does spine chill help? like how should you react when it goes off (i‚Äôm big survivor noob)
---
Does myers count as insta down?
---
If its active for more than 2 seconds ......run
---
To touch on your third point, there needs to be punishment. Being able to wildly swing is idiotic. The frames aren‚Äôt the problem if they‚Äôre missing every first swing.
---
Really? I hated shangri-la soo much. People shit on tranzit but I think it wasn't as bad as Shangri-la. It was soo small, had no training spots and the Easter egg was impossible (its the only one I didn't do in all of zombies). The only thing I like about it is the wonder weapon
---
okay i never knew if it was better to try &amp; hide or run. thank you for helping!
---
If it is flickering the killer probably isn't coming your direction but if it's solid then dip out. It also counters all the stealthy killers except Myers in tier 1.
---
August i think
---
This is the roadmap.

---
It helps alot if the killer is a the scream or myers
---
No, wtf xD
---
Bruh, bubbha needs that shit the higher rank you go and if myers is counted as an insta down killer, he has no mobility bruh.
---
Replace Spirit Fury with Rancor and replace Haunted Ground with Deerstalker or NOED.
---
Tetris
---
BABY MEG
---
I meant to ask in the scariness factor
---
You can‚Äôt. I tried that multiple times and it didn‚Äôt work, so I eventually gave up and used an instaheal.
---
Because you like the look/story of the character. As a killer myself, I would never buy a new killer just for an overpowered perk even on the same tier as BBQ. I only get them if their overall playstyle appeals to me.
---
Why, too easy or too hard
---
It‚Äôs almost like the website is 17+
---
Lol the disconnection on their team. Rough, what happened with that?
---
Wake the fuck up Entity, we got survivors to sleep.
---
been browsing for almost 2 years now, and somehow i'm still seeing the same stuff every day.
---
Yeah I understand. Gives the survivor more counterplay and the opportunity to actually juke the killer but it can be really really punishing especially on console. Again, I don't mind it and don't consider it a big problem. Rarely do I miss a swing.
---
If you already have borrowed time, left behind, or unbreakable in a given character, said character will keep the perks. However, the perks will not show up on future bloodwebs until you acquire the teachables from bill.
---
Every damn time
---
How do you find every subreddit? Lol
---
Nah Xbox
---
Wouldn't it be august?
---
How so? Imo it's more messed up looking at this as a pay to win game ehere you're entitled to buy a set of broken perks that can never change
---
I don't know, it just doesn't feel the same. I really hated that they removed the original perks. I also did not like the elixir system and think the gobblegum system was way better. The wall guns are also super expensive and I'm not a fan of the guns in general
---
Surveillance, especially on stealth killers or on killers with mobility.
---
They all tried to bully me.
---
When I downed somebody they all tried to be sneaky with their flashlights and I downed 3 of them and let the other go (or the game would end to soon)
---
but one of them just dc
---
Since the event I‚Äôve been getting killer matches in less than a minute (pc)
---
It's only taking me like 2 minutes per game. I'm on PS4 though if that makes a difference
---
Yup, that's Meg all right. You should add the Deathgarden mask! :)
---
God you guys are gullible falling for such an obvious bait.
---
Killers are a different story imo, i've bought two killers because killers at least have different powers, survivors are just different skins.
---
Tournaments already exist, you can check them out on yt. As for esports, if Rainbow can go then so can DBD.
---
Are those all Megs?
---
We get content drops every 3 months, with occasional paragraphs inbetween. The devs have confirmed this. We got Ghostface in June, a full chapter in September, a solo killer chapter in December, and a full chapter in March.
---
A shame it wouldn't happen, because getting Ice-T as a survivor would be lit. While there's no hope in Hell Leprechaun would get in, I'd love if some other goofy, dumb horror movie character made it in. Dead By Daylight: The Silent Night, Deadly Knight chapter!

[Fuck you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO_U9Jceps)
---
It's insane that people disconnect on good killers and then call killers babies when they use killers other than the top 3. It's actually pathetic.
---
There's no way in hell this is cosplay, its too good to be true.
---
On your place I would or instantly leave or just try to ignore it.. I started playing Spirit yesterday I am rank 20 played other killers only few times. I played like 9 games with her everybody escaped nobody got ever hooked and everybody called me trash. The sixth game I hooked 2 survivors and since than started patroling every game. Because it is not something bad. It is a really effective tactic. Because they have a chance of rescuing the hooked survivor just gotta be patient and smart. So I patroled the seventh game and a dude writed on my steam account that I am camper. I just deleted it and moved on. On the eight game I killed 3 survivors and one escaped. They started calling me a noob and camper even that I patroled. And my last game with Spirit like 20 minutes ago. I ended killing 3 survivors one crawled out. They all said gg and said it was really fun game for them. Then I realized that I should really ignore what people think of me. Because when Im bad they call me trash. But when I become good they call me noob or camper. So there isnt any point of being mad or sad cause of it. And as you can see in my last game there are still people that arent like this :)
---
Too hard imo
---
I want Keanu Reeves as a killer, he would suffocate survivors just like Nurse cuz hes BREATHTAKING
---
Yeah it sucks ass to lose the entire ff gauge because you missed an attack due to frame rate drops
---
I mean,  its no tiny hat.
---
That‚Äôs how clown looks at me after i looped him around his Bamboozled window
---
Some sacrifice perks would be cool , maybe not out right killing the killer but stunning him or something
---
Damn assassin's creed looks lit
---
Not always. If you want to put it that way, plague could be counted and hell no she shouldn't be.
---
Some achievements are bugged atm. I have the trophy for prestige 3-50 but never got the hit prestige 3 one. Even prestige another character to 3 and won't unlock. (Characters were Bubba and Feng if it helps any)
---
It's a lot easier to rank up at that rank meaning someone at 15 can get to 11 fairly quick, especially with killers quickly ranking up.
---
Haha, I'll take that as a compliment, thanks :)
---
I don't think the devs said they are doing a solo killer in December I watched the whole stream day of.
---
And if there isn't a chapter in august and the mid chapter patch comes out this month presumably that means that next month would be the next chapter.
---
Jesus its nearly impossible to do that nowadays!  
---
I started on Rank 10 after the rank reset and all I got so far a premade tryhard groups that do perfect 360's and bodyblock and loop the hell out of every map.  
---
I mean I still kill most of them but it's impossible to play without proper perks equipped.
---
I had this happen to me, and it did let me grab them after I damaged them and caught them in a vault. Which unstuck me
---
the problem is that they knew MoM will be a problem, they just nerfed DS before it and MoM is like DS on meth.
---
Thank you!
---
That dont work for traps.
---
But aren‚Äôt the survivors who got reset to 15 also facing good killers that were at rank 7? So they can‚Äôt rank up quick?
---
If it were up too me i'd get ghostface full price and than wait for a sale to get Micheal and Freddy.
---
Had this situation where a Bill got put in basement and clown just body blocked the stairs the stairs with insidious. Me and the other 2 survivors ran off and did the gens and escaped, even with NOED crutch.
---
Bill asked why we didn‚Äôt rescue him (I assume he thought clown went away due to insidious) and clown said ‚Äúno skill. All survivors know to do is loop, and they can‚Äôt save anyone. Pussies, go KYS.‚Äù like, dude, you body blocked the stairs with insidious. We‚Äôre gonna do gens because we‚Äôre not blind and stupid enough to take the hit to run down stairs, then get trapped by how fat you are.
---
I hate that  you're actually right.
---
EVERYONE IGNORE HIM HE JUST WANTS ATTENTION
---
Honestly I started playing Legion post rework regularly since the cheese was removed and I play on PS4.  The frames aren't much of an issue anymore with the engine update from several months back.  All it takes is discipline.  I don't take the swing until I know for a fact it'll connect.  And if they juke like a headless chicken I must take a step back and let them juke into my hit.  I don't really like the whole blame console thing for my misses.  Your friends simply lack deeeeeseeeeeplin.
---
He's ability needs to be reworked as a whole because it wastes so much time. The community would probably riot if anything about him was reverted.
---
To many RNG elements too.
---
Myers is the best out of the three. 
---
Freddy is getting reworked soon so nobody is really sure how he‚Äôll perform in the main game. 
---
And Ghostface can be fun yet frustrating. I‚Äôd say GF is the worst out of the three once Freddy gets reworked. 
---
If you want fun it doesn‚Äôt really matter, just find whatever one fits your playstyle.
---
Well, the BP caps, so using anything to get more just feels bad when you hit that.
---
Will we get the L4D cosemetics with him?
---
They literally did, my dude, but whatever. 
---
It's not coming in August, but hype yourself up for nothing, I guess.
---
EVERYONE IGNORE THIS FUCKER HE JUST WANTS ATTENTION
---
Yeah there's alot of quality put into the trailers.
---
*Shut up, Wesley!*
---
I mean it probably worked on me a few times before i noticed it. Once you‚Äôve seen it once, then it‚Äôs easy to check for.
---
It's snooze ville for you because you're actively looking for a reason not to enjoy the clip, probably based on the comment section. It was way too close and tbh I thought they had it, but like someone commented on one of my earlier posts, hatch takes way too long to spawn after a sacrifice. But yeah, that's the gist of it. That other guy knew what my mindstate was lol they were not escaping ME! (unless they did, in which case...)
---
I also love unlicking perks!
---
Bit off topic. But I play 2 games as survivor then 2 as killer and keep alternating. Keeps the bloodpoints steady and your game knowledge fresh.
---
Yes in Naruto it's call rasen shuriken
---
Props to the survivor, had this happen to me a week or two ago and all I got was a survivor trying to blind me with the flash light the entire time. I do hate that this glitch is back again though.
---
Key note that the other argument possibly missed.
---
*Ghostface can tbag back*
---
Due to matchmaking, rank 1‚Äôs will very rarely play with rank 10s. Thanks to the reset, a rank 10s post reset can now play with all the shitters.
---
80% of the time it works every time
---
Powerful Survivor Main energy here.
---
I remember that guy who would drop all nearby pallets before starting to work on generator.
---
Bill would have a pipe bomb
---
Ill answer for him, yes
---
The rank 10 player is still a rank 1 player though? Because everyone got reset
---
Devour Hope only reveals exposed on non-insta down attacks, so you can mask the effect and protect the totem a little longer if your killer has an insta-down
---
well it is yes and no it is easy you can pull that off on average billy but good billies who can curve .-. they are scary too scary
---
I love quick and quiet on surv with either dance with me and lithe or head on. I also like I'm all ears on huntress. She can really benefit from 6 seconds of aura reading mid chase.
---
Killers make a huge leap in skill from purple to red. Especially because the killers begin to tryhard.
---
Yeah it would. I wrote out a survivor concept for the character he played as well, if you wanted to check it out.
---
Survivor toxicity: A multitude of unnecessary actions taken to deliberately spite the Killer.
---
Killer toxicity: Wanting to confirm a kill or as many hits as possible and being moderately inconsiderate about it.
---
Chat notwithstanding, ofc.
---
I just skimmed the video and checked a couple threads that covered the stream and nothing on that solo killer chapter.
---
Do you honestly not get the joke?
---
Nope.
---
Oh, that is insta heart attack
---
Myers.
---
No I dumb
---
I fack yuw mofew on top of yuw chests fight me uwu  
---
 tag me to uwuize comments uwu
---
Anyone who thought MoM wasnt gonna be nerfed deserved to lose their money.
---
The game has evolved a lot since then, the attacks werr pretty slow but as people adjusted they've sped up a lot.
---
And ive been playing with Keubaord and mouse since Day 1 on the game and I play pretty well, all depends on which you like more.
---
But I would suggest giving it another try (perhaps in PvP bc the story mode still uses the old attacks, and the training it puts you in is MUCH different than actual PvP)
---
"just hit them again LOOOOOOLLLLL"
---
So would Myers.
---
I think so, yeah. If you're playing on console too even though nurse and huntress are free you still have to download them from the console's store
---
Spirit is the best purchasable character in the game. 
---
A good Ghostface setup is
---
BBQ - RUIN - PGTW - SPIRIT FURY
---
As much as I love the novelty of solo queue without comms, IIRC devs said they would look into adding them eventually and really they need to because the discrepancy between swf and solo is too high. A cool idea that loses its value once you see how shitty it can be in-game. A good medium would even be localized voice chat instead of global, but something needs to change.
---
So they should keep a blatantly broken perk as it is because idiots who have no foresight wasted literally 5 bucks on it?
---
‚Äúfuck you‚Äù -feng min 
---
ah yes, a wise quote.
---
Its probably gonna be Demogorgon or Hellraiser, but as for what I personally want, that would be The Creature of the Black Lagoon
---
switch it up sometimes, kill 'em with kindness, a simple thanks or ty - and you will literally be a great human while completely killing their whole negative vibe.  If they follow up with more toxicity, you then ignore it, and internally just wish the best for them.  You just created your own good karma like an alchemist.  :}
---
I got it in the shrine that one time thank god lol
---
Lol and crawling away and hiding as claudette in the corner is? As if urban evasion and spined chill are enough. A good killer will find you anyway or will come some seconds later back. If you are experienced in playing offensive, you can take his time until 2-3 gens are already finished.
---
Then learn decisive? Killers are forced to level Hag all the way to 35 to have a chance to win games so it's fair for both sides.
---
The dumb thing is that it's Ash. If you're not going to add combat mechanics that really change the game and finally shake things up, don't insult Ash by adding him. At least Bill was stealthy sometimes, but Ash's main weapons are a shotgun and chainsaw.
---
It's funny to me because I play a ton of killer and receive next to no salt.  I don't camp or tunnel.  If I get a message post game it's more likely to be a gg than anything.  I saw you mention patrolling hooks and gen rushing.  I think this is your problem.  It sounds like you proxy which will cause salt as well as gen rushing since if you're choosing to spend your time protecting a kill rather than pressuring gens and applying pressure on the other survivors they have nothing to do other than to simply plow through the gens you're giving them.  
---
If you want less salt and to improve your killer play in one swoop, hook, leave to patrol gens and initiate a new chase.  Try and always keep them having to save someone else off a hook it will pull them off the gens.  Pop Goes the Weasel is awesome for this playstyle.  More bp's, easier pip and way less salt.
---
Pretty standard
---
Spirit Fury is Worthless without Enduring + Spirit has no real use for it; youre better off runnign Deerstalker or Spies instead.
---
If the killer opens the gate themselves, They're onto something.
---
The corn was never a problem for me until they updated the engine or whatever they did. Now I can't see jack fuckin shit.
---
Ah yes, I recognise is now
---
Console players get Spark of Madness and Flesh &amp; Mud for free. Huntress and Nurse are free for everyone and IMO dont count as DLC
---
you can‚Äôt tank it though if the survivor is already down after unhooking you
---
Lol you remind me of one of those old guys from the Muppets
---
Perhaps
---
Objectively speaking no. 
---
It's a thing you do for completionism/fun/just something to do because progression is nice.
---
Maybe I don't want to spend $8 on a DLC and waste who knows how many Bloodpoints on the Bloodweb just to deal with a problem that should be fixed at its core instead of making paid workarounds?
---
Are you fucking stupid the game is like 17-18+
---
Thank you feng, very cool!
---
Oh no, the "survivors are too weak" squad found my both sides of the game are already balanced comments.
---
I didn't say anything about that, if you're replying to my comment, please reply to my comment.
---
Alright thanks! Could I sub spirit fury for the third seal? Or would that not be good?
---
Cool now can they do something about body blocking
---
So why should killers have to and not survivors? Borrowed time is also a anti tunnel perk and is available on console for a base teachable.
---
Oh, fuck shit, bitch, damn cocksucker
---
Pussy, asshole, cunt
---
Mother fuckin' dirty whore, shat onto my lunch
---
Piss cunt, damn bitch, suck my dick
---
Jesus Harold Christ
---
Shit bitch, cocksucker, Goddamn motherfucker, pussy, asshole cunt
---
Spine chill works on stealthy killers that don't have a heartbeat. It can also warn you if a nurse or Billy is about to come zooming in your direction. Very superior to premonition IMO bc spine chill has no cool down as well.
---
The blindness effect of the third seal is very weak and doesn't make it worth a counterable hex. Spirit fury is for your anti pallets so ghostface can get closer during chases.
---
This is the Meg cosplay I made for Animecon in the Netherlands. I didn't have enough time to make the belt and suitable pants, but since I spent my time behind a stall with my legs never visible I figured it wouldn't matter too much.
---
I got recognized a couple of times and got some pictures taken, which was fun :)
---
It's still a rank drop that increases the higher up you were. Maybe Rank 10s have a chance against red ranks, but 18s getting dumpstered by 10s (or higher, if it's a SWF with some players at 20) is cruel and inhumane treatment.
---
this looks like a remastered version of Meg lol very well done
---
Nah, I would probably compare a ranger medkit with Botany Knowledge to quick revive, since the insta heal effect is closer to the ballistic knives pap
---
\&gt; I'm sorry are there other reasons to buy survivors other than their perks? 
---
this implies it's justified to not gut blatantly overpowered perks.
---
Why do you think they didnt go with increased wiggling progression in the first place? It is the **very** obvious solution to the problem. Do you think it was just a dev wanting to be clever or do you see any reason behind this?
---
Looks really good, I appreciate the attention to detail. Cosplaying these guys is more than just the clothes, the cuts and bruises really sell it hard.
---
Nice work!
---
Seriously, that part made it perfect. Also love that it‚Äôs by tiny little Feng

That's some impressive mental gymnastics my dude

Because the ranks are collapsed, meaning both are present, but the SWFs won't have bad randoms.

It has shown up on the shrine of secrets for anyone to purchase for free numerous times.  Stop being dramatic.

I just got rancor'd like an idiot I am. I was like 'Why am I seeing auras, did someone bring key with killer aura addon?'. Then it hit me.
---
Yup.
---
Do you even read bro
---
Not arguing who's better, arguing that Myers has an insta down whereas Plague does not.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main, so keep in mind I am a bit bias to what I‚Äôd like the perk to be... That being said, i think it would be better to be a direct counter to the killer perk that makes wiggling progression harder (can‚Äôt remember its name). I think a 15/20/25 speed boost or 20/25/30 speed boost to wiggle progression is reasonable. I do agree with the above guy about 50% being a bit much, even with the hooks as frequent as they are, there‚Äôs been enough times I‚Äôve almost gotten out of the killer grasp that it‚Äôd be nearly impossible for a killer to hook a survivor reasonably if you upped it to 50%. I had no idea u til your explanation that the perk worked in that way...
---
Mettle of Mann was certainly not a broken ass perk. Even as killer, I found that it wasn't that big of a deal to go against. It worked, for me and at most, twice a match.
---
First, you gotta pray to the entity that no one is running smallgame and that you get a good totem spawn 
---
All I can say is be good at applying constant pressure, the few times I get full tokens with DH are the games where a survivor is being unhooked as I‚Äôm downing someone else, you can‚Äôt let them have time to search for your totem
---

---
i think one gives sacrifice points and the other gives deviousness.
---
It was certainly a broken ass perk, made playing the game a lot more hellish for how much it was used. I'd go as far to say that it was far more annoying than the old DS

I have 8 survivors P3 and there‚Äôs next to no difference in blood web imo, and I have sacrificed some good builds on favourite players just for the bloodied clothes, only for them to be useless at P3 because I had all perks unlocked and it was a roulette.
---
Without Ruin for sure.  All Ruin will do is cause them to look for hexes.  Your best bet at pulling off a Devour Hope play is for it to come out of nowhere as a complete surprise.  The Game Map is phenomenal for Devour because of the totem spawns.

This sub existed for 2 years? Damn
---
It's better for your first high level killer to make him a good BP grinder so you can level everything else up in an easy way. Later when you got more high levels you can if you want his bloody gear. Technically it's supposed to make rarer items appear on the bloodweb as well, but that is debatable...
---
With how they balance the game sometimes, it definitely feels like it
---
NOED is the hex perk "No One Escapes Death", and Tunneled is if you like lets say get unhooked and the killer ignores all the other survivors and goes for you right away
---
Noed is a killer perk far as i know. Aint played in a while. And tunneling is a way some killers like to play.
---
Uh this is so good it doesn‚Äôt look real :/
---
I‚Äôve covered entity‚Äôs, you know?

Wait..... it‚Äôs a wraith..... *without Noed?*
---
You can‚Äôt use a flashlight in tier three madness as far as I know.  If you use the add ons that change the shape of the shock you can get survivors to tier three madness pretty fast right?  I feel like pig or wraith would have been a better example for this.

---
Or maybe justifying broken mechanics with "the other side has to deal with it so it's fair" is not a good mentality? The speed of generators is a problem too and I really hate how basically every single new Killer has a perk that either directly (Thrilling Tremmors, Corrupt Intervention, Pop Goes the Weasel) or indirectly (Discordance, Rancor, Surveillance, Fired Up) relates to generators being done too fast.
---
The last Killer who didn't have a perk with the word "Generator" in its description was Leatherface. There are a total of **two** Killers in the game who don't have perks that directly make Generator control easier in some way (Wraith and Leatherface)
---
For starters, a trap would still work on that "period of invincibility" and secondly it isn't a period of invincibility at all, it's a speed boost. It does NOT give you i-frames, you just move quickly. The reason a chainsaw doesn't work on a sprint bursting survivor is because the game for some reason forces you to swing the chainsaw despite you not being in range to actually get the hit because they're moving so quickly (in other words, it really shouldn't do that). The only boost that gives you i-frames is dead hard.
---
The only time it was really make or break for the outcome of a game was in the gates. People talk about it like it had a timer and could happen 15 times per game.
---
i ignore tbagging as killer but flashlight spamming?  buddy a whole new world‚Äôs in for you.  i don‚Äôt bother camping of course but i just make sure they‚Äôre match isn‚Äôt fun at all.  farm off the hook, let crawl away, nod head when downing, etc.  just stuff that isn‚Äôt gamebreaking just annoying to deal with.
---
Not at all.

Oh
---
If you really want to fuck with them throw on Thrill instead of Spirit Fury.  They'll assume you're running Devour Hope and will keep launching themselves at your hexes slowing the gen repairs.  You can probably get downs from totem pulls and even if they manage to take one out it'll probably just be hour haunted which you'd have a head start on heading towards for an easy down.
---
Not quite sure but i think it has something to do with focusong on one survivor. I think someone else might be able to explain it better than me.
---
Wow that's awesome!
---
Why not? I'm feeling adventurous today.
---

youre right but It‚Äôs sad this sub went to shit because people are afraid of any sort of discussion. they say they‚Äôre not, which is hysterical because the mass downvote any opinion they don‚Äôt like. I miss the way this sub was years ago so I‚Äôll deal with the downvotes. rip opinions lol
---
I had a SWF Squadette team with flashlights... Needless to say I brought Franklin's Demise and a Pink Mori! You got to pay it forward... I removed 4 toxic flashlights from this game, your welcome!
---
the number of times ive seen people badmouth someone for noed while simultaneously running adrenaline is ridiculous.
---
Yeah, again, sorry. Was jumping to conclusions without actually doing my research...
---
whoa this looks amazing!!! you did a really good job!
---
I *used* to be toxic, then I went into *rehab* to *not* be toxic, and now I‚Äôm *not* toxic, and haven‚Äôt butt-danced in

:)
---
Stealthy Survivor is basically a bad survivor.
---
I know because for ~1.5 years I played this way. But really it means you can't loop and you can't use up the Killer's time. Good Killers will easily spot you and, since you can't run whatsoever, you will die fast. 
---
Whereas learning to loop was hard at first, it definitely improves your skill level and your competency as a Survivor. 
---
With the natural noise Survivor makes too, experienced Killers can spot you easily. It's much better to avoid stealth and go for a safe loop.
---
If you're experienced, you ruin new players' fun and vice versa.
---
no I run houdini plus bt instead of LW most of the time bc that give me the most use. I tend to run 2 or 3 loops before I use the gimmick and dissappear. it's just that I used to run adrenaline and 99% of the time it gave me nothing extra (either wasn't getting chased or wounded and the SB is useless if you're not being chased so I started thinking what other perk I can get the most use out of and so far that has been BT since it counters noed bc people apperantly refuse to do dull totems
---
Play nice if they do, return the favor and play dirty if they don't. Skip the after game chat and just quee for a new match. There's a lot of assholes on the survivor side and you just got to learn to live with it cause the game dynamics are what they are and so is the (survivor-) playerbase. PS. I loved Evolve too and it's a shame what happened to it.
---
i simply said ‚Äúhow can a survivor flashlight click the doctor‚Äù (you can‚Äôt use a flashlight in tier 3 madness), and i‚Äôm getting downvotes because tru3 used a poor example.
---
Umm that's why everyone buys leatherface, for bbq and chili nobody actually really plays him... so your comment is dumb... that's the only reason to buy a character is if they have good perks.. because at the end of the day survivors are only skins and perks are all shareable.
---
If I'm getting mileage out of NOED, I actually don't need to lay down pressure. It means YOU need to cleanse more totems or leave quicker.
---
If someone brings a gun to a streetfight, they don't give a fuck if you care. They came to win, not get your approval. So crying isn't doing anything for you. So instead, try preparing for it, since killers have to alter their play around your perks and they at least complain about it a lot less. 
---
Detective's Hunch, Small Game, a Map with Red Twine. All these work quite effortlessly against a perk that gives you the entire game to counter it.
---
yep a trade is not a succes
---
Use what perks you want to use
---
Thanks, I guess i should not tunnel than. I used that play style cuz' it worked but I mean if it's toxic ok
---
What?
---
and then you have people who use the sweatiest build against new player on rank reset
---
yep, see [this](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68065/bookmark-cosmetic-reveal-mid-chapter-3-0-0)
---
Tunneling in my opinion is okay if its their last hook, cause like at that point its just going for the weak link, which is just a good strat
---
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it

Nice strawman

Yeah seriously. It really bugs me when I see someone ask if it's "okay" to use a certain perk build or add-on mix. If it helps you win then go for it, don't let Survivor "rules" influence your decision.
---
but when survivors win they straight up bully the Hunter by keeping them stunned for 60 seconds straight
---
I was going to make a Survivor one as well.
---
Hopefully they fix this. They should either get hit, OR throw the pallet. Both doesn't make semse and eastes pallets.
---
cuz exploiting bugs isn't very nice, but in this case i agree with you
---
it‚Äôs a repost from when this was the meta
---
Plnety of people play LF though.
---
Why not? You like them being skins?
---
yeah meant more in the sense glitch happens and i try to leave, killer says im exploiting bugs but i just want out of this thing.
---
RJ Macready conformed?
---
People aren't going to like me saying but "They are all nice and legal tactics!" their pain is your gain as a killer!
---
\- I think Caligula said it best when he uttered the words: "Oderint Dum Metuant"
---
Now im never gonna be able to play clown again without thinking about this
---
fucking 10/10
---
It's good. I don't know for certain either, but Meyers is basically an unstoppable force. I've only watched the first movie and they do all kinds of shit to him there but he refuses to die. Apparently that only happens on Halloween day, but I'm also not 100% on that.
---
Also, saying  no body does it for the survivors is dumb. Maybe you dont, but you shouldn't and cant speak for everyone
---
I always feel bad for thess guys. Lol. I played last night and the survivors are all struggling then dying 10 seconds after being on the hook.
---
Original poster deleted their comment but something else I want to say:
---
&gt;We know bodyblocking while carrying a Survivor is annoying so we added the perk Mad Grit to counter bodyblocking!
---
&gt;And what if I don't have Mad Grit?
---
&gt;LOL GET CUCKED SHITHEAD GIVE US MORE MONEY
---
Only problem is that would encourage survivors to hide and try to get the hatch. Nothing is worse than whrn you are looping the killer with 1 gen left and you get hooked to realize your teammate was hiding.
---

Yes Michael is the best and if someone says otherwise they're wrong

I‚Äôm getting my popcorn for this one, it‚Äôs gonna be a good comment read.
---
What gender is that?
---
also use a med kit and you have 5 perks now
---
Try finding the one hooked when you cant see them get hooked.
---
People without it would rescue him before you would even have a clue about where he may be
---
It's actually a ponytail, when you see the back of it.
---
I run stake out on tapp and it's honestly one of the most fun perks in the game with urban evasion.
---
NOED = No One Escapes Death
---
Tunneling = Pretty much being an ass and only going for one person even if they've just been unhooked
---
thank you freddy, i was too lazy to explain it myself
---
Then all the Dwights with their repair speed will get tunneled first
---
He means adding in a licensed character that doesn't just run, Ash fights back and he had dope perks on release until they were nerfed into the ground
---
I feel you, granted the perk selection for their toon is limited still.  I just cannot stand that perk as a killer because it teaches the absolute worst habits which are hard to break.  Complete lack of gen pressure and poor decision making in general in regards to chasing.  I'd recommend anything else in its place simply to promote developing their killer play.
---
he's not the best killer but he is fun and can have a lot of variety because he has some of the best add ons in the game
---
Instead of Claudette‚Äôs getting tunnled first because they‚Äôre harder to see
---
Legions killer instinct isn‚Äôt based off of terror radius since the ‚Äòrework‚Äô
---
I would pay money to NOT have the last Clown in game.
---
What the fuck? Three hits and a two unhooks for one safe hit? What are you on?
---
Oh really? I didn‚Äôt know that lol oops
---
insert ‚Äúwhy are you boo‚Äôing me? I‚Äôm right.‚Äù
---
Meg Main Big Brain
---
How about we can equip "super perks", but in order to equip that you need 1 "negative" perk equipped.
---
so either 4 normal, 2 normal 1 good 1 bad, or 2 good 2 bad.
---
Super perks would be much stronger than an usual perk, since not only you have 1 less perk, but you also get a negative one.
---
Why stop at 2 when you can get 4?
---
Don‚Äôt you normally do that throughout the match anyway?
---
Oh well
---
Winner
---
Solid mid tier killer who is fun to play and has what may be the widest selection of killer addons in the game some of which promote completely polar opposite playstyles.  Also his Save the Best for Last teachable is among the best and most underrated perks in the game.
---
That‚Äôs sad but I was being chased by the killer and I had the hatch close on me the second I got to it then I couldn‚Äôt escape through the gate. My death that match was inevitable
---
But you still get an escape- you just swap spots
---
If you're about to go into second state it's DEFINITELY worth the swap.
---
He‚Äôs a lot of fun, different types of add on builds make him awesome
---
Same reason low rank survivors talk trash and blame their teammates every time they lose, they fail to see things any way but their extremely narrow view. 
---
In the case of high rank survivors bullying lower ranks, its because they'd rather play against sub par competition and pretend they are the best rather than going against the best and having to face the reality that they are not as good as the thing they are.
---
You have to use Boil Over in enclosed narrow areas and with knowledge where hooks are. 
---
A good map for it is Lery's with all the doorways obstacles in the rooms.
---
Me and my friend both used Boil Over effectively. I escaped once and he escaped twice. On his first attempt escape, the killer was in a room and when he was trying to take my friend out, I bodyblocked the door so he would have to hit me.
---
Due to the walls around and the increased sway in struggling, the killer swong 3 times and missed all those times on me when I just stood still.
---
Yes the L4D cosmetics will come with Bill as well
---
he throws gas bottles, hence the Gasenshuriken
---
It reminds me of Captain Spauling and in a fan lol
---
is this an oc image or did someone else make it? either way good meme
---
Survivors are gonna piss their pants when they get a ruin check and they see that hex
---
Damn that needs a buff
---
Running selfcare in 2019... omegalul that's a huge waste of time and huge waste of a perk spot... I hate playing with people who use it.. they're selfish stupid players.
---
I‚Äôve also had this happen to me, but I was on the Temple of Purgation map.
---
I am having the same issue, as killer I will chase and then just not be able to attack. Very frustrating, lost several games due to this, it happens like every third swong for me. I've noticed it's always when something is happening: bloodlust kicking in, they use dead hard, a gen pops, etc.
---
Haha fuck them time to face camp and tunnel
---
Dude such disappointment.  I expected a meme but all I saw was a babykiller trashcamp a survivor to death.  Also I know for a fact you didn't bm to deserve it.  Nobody in the history or survivor has ever ran technician and teabagged a killer midchase lol.
---
That Actually is fucking amazing, but Dead Rising 2s on par with Dead rising 1 tbh
---
You obviously just have your moms money to waste.. I'm not buying a killer/survivor because of the way they look.
---
They should do a Wild West skin pack because every character got some kind of Wild West variation
---
what‚Äôs anniversary
---
Good rebuttle..  lmao
---
The anniversary event that just happened a few weeks ago. With the gruesome gateaux and the new firecrackers.
---
Ah that good old POS that doesn't save a hooked character when the killer is on another survivor and then get 7k BP for a hatch escape. And you laugh with the Billy? I was crying with the Jake... well I guess people are different!
---
Sounds like someone got morid today
---
you don‚Äôt like to old man frank?
---
I think it would be better if each survivor had something unique that gave a BP bonus, as opposed to actually giving them a buffed ability. So for example, Jake gets extra BP for hook sabo, or Claudette gets extra BP for healing others (but she doesn‚Äôt heal any faster)
---
Imagine disconnecting while seeing the killer. Or better ‚Äî while exiting the gates. Or When saving somebody from the hook. A true master mind plan
---
That‚Äôs the greatest ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù of all time.
---
I like this idea the best actually keeps the options open and also can cue the killer as to how you‚Äôre gonna play without actually locking you into any specific play style
---
trying out new tricks thought It‚Äôd be cool to do it in front of a David and some other guy
---
Not bad! I like the joke. The masking was pretty rough and honestly missing for quite a lot of it though. It was hard to figure out what was happening with the quick camera work behind all the images flying around.
---
Auto-tracking objects is good to get the base path going, but it's not always accurate for a final product. Don't be afraid to slow down playback a little and go over the object paths to make sure they line to properly. The eye is really good at discerning when things don't line up properly, and that can make it difficult to watch from the viewers perspective.
---
As I said, do really like the joke though. I'm glad to see you trying out editing and putting together creative memes. Keep it up!
---
If it can down survivors, it has no counterplay and is cancer.
---
If it can't down survivors, it's a garbage power.
---
I‚Äôm getting many Danny devito vibes
---
He just gets back up
---
I honestly thought this was a source filmmaker still from the thumbnail. Great job!
---
Bye! Hope you feel better and get to play it again someday.
---
wraith should be dwight main persona, they bot dissapear
---
Every time I run a med kit without selfish care, the killer brings Franklins.
---
Sure, fair enough. Wraith can also get dicked on tons of bad map gen.
---
You'd be surprised just how much mileage Wraith can get in seemingly bad circumstances- really good killers know how to do M1 chases well and stomp out tiles/ zone people out into a down. (and what to do once they got that pressure)
---
Aw its Rigby
---
"No! Don't do it Ace!"
---
"I'm here for you. There's No One Left Behind..."
---
If you‚Äôre going sweaty tryhard, there‚Äôs no reason not to run NOED. It‚Äôs just that strong lol.
---
Actually no, I‚Äôm not
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Answering for me was unnecessary, especially because you were wrong
---
Yes? They are just learning the game and getting used to the horror aspect. It's not like him getting chased, downed, and hooked is gonna save you anything. He will be down in .2 seconds because he doesnt know how to loop and the killer will be back on you. 
---
If you enjoy fucking over your teammates then sure, do it, still toxic tho.
---
SPRINT BURSTO
---
I just switched to playing survivor. This happened my very first match back.
---
One gen left, two teammates dead, and I get hooked for the first time. My last teammates aura lights up and I see he just stands completely still. Of course I see his character in the post game chat .5 seconds after and it says he escaped.
---
I think he's referring to how adding characters like Ash and Bill, who are some serious badasses in their own universes, creates a weird disconnect between how they're portrayed in DBD vs in their own media. I mean, Ash kills freaky monsters all the time, and Bill dealt with shit like [this](https://readcomiconline.to/Comic/Left-4-Dead-The-Sacrifice/Issue-1?id=108947&amp;readType=0#15) on a regular basis. Making them be just as helpless as the other survivors just feels ridiculous.
---

hi.
---
Yes, Q&amp;Q only removes the audio cue so Scratchmarks will still be visible.
---
The map was small but that is what made it challenging and required alot of practice. You had one kind of training spot after the first door on the left but it was kinda tricky. Plus you had PHD flopper and fun elemantal zombies. But regarding the easter egg, it‚Äôs fairly easy but it just required 4 players. Overall I like the map and remember first time playing it and loving the way it looked in the jungle.

How could you do such a thing!

*Laughs in former console player*
---
Hey.
---
when are they gonna announce the finalists for the design your own cosmetic as well as the winners for the other contests? they said "shortly" for both but it's been nearly 2 weeks
---
How about remove the timer on ds and make it that if you are the first one to get picked up after being unhooked then you can use it. Completely reworked into anti-tunneling. Otherwise you would just have to remove the perk.
---

BT triggers me even when I play survivor, it allows players to do most stupid saves in the west
---
This must be a console bug. It‚Äôs happened to me too and I‚Äôm on PS4.
---
Still would of been better if it was Bill.
---
I want chromeskull in, as well as Cordell. I think pennywise could work. I don‚Äôt think any characters from Cabin in the Woods could work though.
---
If you run toward a locker with Q&amp;Q the scratch marks will still be visible around it so if it‚Äôs a smart killer they would know you went into it usually doesn‚Äôt work most of the time (from my experience about 8/10 times it doesn‚Äôt fool them)
---
That's what I've taken to doing as killer. I'll throw a quick gg, maybe scan survivor ranks, and leave. I dont even bother looking at perks or items. No conversations or discussions about the game.
---
I use, sorry. But I admit that is more of a tool to sense the killer's terror radius. I also equip i th on my Meg.
---
Super fun, definitely try him. Has a lot of potential playstyles thanks to his addons, and most survivors have a good time playing against him. Probably the most balanced killer in the game imo
---
Playing killer who isn't Nurse or Spirit against survivors who know they are power role ruins my experience as well...
---
Not only, but conveniently a totem is right next to it as well, and guess what the entity prefers to spawn a Hex totem on... That totem.

Jeepers creepers wont ever be added. People would take issue with it.
---
It was such a fun game, if only they didn't DLC bomb the game at launch, was so fun after it went F2P
---
I think he means if you stand in front of a locker or walk to one and then fast vault into it if that leaves scratch marks
---
You could try body blocking the survivors if possible, gives you time to rev the chainsaw, or just start to rev it when you are really close to a survivor (within hitting distance) as it's harder for them to evade you if you're directly behind them. Hope this helps.
---
Everything okay? Hopefully you are good and might return someday to the game
---
No worries i'm aware there are good survivors out there that aren't toxic post game. Sadly the few are more vocal than the majority.
---
Ill give it a shot!

I don‚Äôt really know about that but I think it would

Pair with dance with me and quickly jump in a locker and jump out to make the killer waste time checking the locker.

No such thing as tunneling. If I have been hooked twice or once &amp; reached struggle, I expect the killer to come after me. One down, three to go. It is good strategy to identify the weakest looper &amp; get them out of the match.
---
Face camping is bad but patrolling an area isn't camping. For example, if a killer is running bbq then hooks and sees no one, why would the killer run 100 meters from the hook? Obviously everyone but Dwight is within 40 meters.
---
Some matches a killer just gets drug around the map. Between hook blocks, DS, OoO, flashlight blinds, group chat SWF. The game leans heavy to the survivor. I expect to be face camped if 5 gens are done and a gates open if im the only one on the hook. People who complain either a) arent very good or b) get upset cuz they were outplayed.
---
BTW, it shouldn't require a perk to stop hook blocking. Killer should automatically get a no cool down hit when 3 survivors take turns blocking the hook.

The survivor counter to NOED is the killer not running it?  Flawless logic right there.
---
And as for reorienting your build to counter something, killers do that all the time. Survivors do gens? Killers run Ruin. Survivors loop? Killers run Enduring. 
---
Besides, you already alter your build for killers. You equip BT for campers and DS for tunnelers. You equip Unbreakable for sluggers. Just because the perks I suggested aren't the most meta of meta, doesn't mean you should disregard them.
---
And you blamed the killer for winning with NOED saying they shouldn't be getting use out of it? That responsibility falls on the survivors. If they want to avoid it, CLEANSE it. The killer doesn't stop you.
---
Cleansing is boring? Sure. Not MORE boring then doing gens. Cleansing isn't viable? You're dead wrong. That is LITERALLY how you get rid of a hex. There is no other way.
---
And if you don't want players to use the "shitty excuse" of just cleansing, then don't use the excuse that a killer doesn't need it if they applied pressure better. Not everyone has Ruin. And even if theu do, it gets cleansed, because that's how totems work. Besides, the killer can't pressure everyone. One chase means 3 survivors are doing gens.
---
Literally every one of your points are weak and shallow. And at the end of the day, it's a video game. As long as no one is cheating, you and I are both allowed to do whatever we want. If you lose to me using a perk you don't like, learn to play against it, or don't play, because I and everyone else, are perfectly allowed to KEEP using it.
---
2nd to last kate is my fav
---
What issue?
---
but.. you hear the killers terror radius
---
The creator is pedo and still owns the rights so he would recieve money for it.
---
What movie is it?
---
hey um so whats up the girl in the 2nd row with the many mouths? 
---
where is she from lol
---
i haven't seen Franklin in a looong time. you can switch last second . it's not like it's a key or something.  also if a killer brings Franklin instead of an actual perk that's a plus for everyone
---
Yeah thats what I ended up doing
---
I wish I was a streamer so I could see what my face looked like. 
---
The worst part to me is the killer wasn't even aware the Entity gave her a free pass in exchange for my pride.
---
Sometimes with the gen's sound and other suvivors grunts it's quite hard. And many times I have to play it without sound because I share a bedroom.
---
I will main freddy if we get The New Nightmare freddy
---
Sugarplum fairy from cabin in the woods
---
Leatherface should get more faces. Since we got more surivors
---
ok yes thanks i knew she was familiar
---
In the remake, Nancy didn‚Äôt really do anything. It felt more like Quentin was the main character, since he did more relating to the issues with Freddy. He knew more about the situation and came up with the plans to get freddy and initiated most of the research behind freddy and stuff. The film had a huge issue with writing the characters, and most of them seemed stiff and unlikeable.
---
He can just steel Adams hair
---
Fuck ochido
---
Tru. Less work lol
---
ahh understandable. I used to use it to counter ruin, but then I learned to hit Great Skillchecks
---
Eh, I'd rather have some fun than be sweaty. But to each their own.
---
I know very little about horror movies and I was wondering, who's the guy in the No tier?
---
Atleast you CAN grind for perks from jake
---
How do you people not understand this? It's not like you're forced to play Jake, you just have to pour BP into him.
---
The Babadook
---
It's okay very few know the Gingerdeadman. And for a good reason
---
I feel cheap though switching shit in at the last second, but I do agree med kit is a better way to go than self care.
---
Ye I would not like to only see meta survivors being played
---
Oh well, thanks for the tip
---
just dont...
---
but seriously legion is mid tier and easy to counter, he is just annoying to deal with, you mend and you get stabbed again
---
legion requiers you to tunnel the survivor to just hook them so... idk i think you should go for higher tier killers like spirit, nurse and hag
---
i like how the suicidal perk blongs to the asian girl XD
---
Okay yeah, the name says it all about why he's in the No tier XD
---
Dead by Duolingo

on steam store page lol

I mean fair but for the sake of the meme it would make more sense
---
RedPhoenix Boom was with me. And SpaceMagic Dude. Phoenix was supposed to be on the hook rescue. We were in chat to save the random while I work on gen since he had been juking him all game already. If you hadn't noticed, we needed 1 more gen. He accidentally got hit with the chainsaw. If I was the killer, I would have slugged him and run back to the hook expecting the hook rescue. Phoenix forgot He was on death-hook so when I heard the sacrifice sound I ran off the gen to get the guy in hopes Billywas far enough away and couldn't dash back without obstacle. Hillbilly came right back and I was watching for the opening or when he would leave far enough to unhook and hide. 
---
The hatch HAPPENED to appear between the random and myself and the Billy clearly saw the hatch. If I was the killer, I would have been circling the parameter knowing the last guy would be coming for the rescue or hatch. I have caught many survivors around the cornor near hatch. I would have allowed the false sense of opening to make the survivor think he can get the rescue in and then take them both down because they wouldn't have gotten far. I hadnt seen the hatch, I was on the boat, so in bad no plan of hatch squatting. 
---
We didn't know it was there so the original play was the get the guy off the hook, heal, and finish gen while Billy runs to look for me since that guy was on death-hook and I could have run him through the tiles. 
---
So, excuse me where we didn't think the best play was to unhook the survivor in front of Hillbilly and have him chainsaw us both so the killer can win. He would have closed the hatch so no crawl escape and even if he didn't, the crawl distance was too great even with Tenacity before hooking either of us. 
---
I get that you can't hear the chat in this video but dick comment is dick comment. They all said "just get the hatch, its not worth it".
---
I play killer when my friends are offline so I'm playing my hand while I figure what what my opening is to make which play. 
---
So, ignorance is bliss and thank you for your input.
---
Honestly killers use the meta perks more than survivors do.
---
This is coming from a killer main do not attack me please.
---
It's one of the biggest issues with Dead by Daylight's balance. There are so many problems with this game that instead of actually fixing they just make perks to "counter" them.
---
BrickyOrchid talks about it in his ["Problems with Dead by Daylight's Meta" video.](https://youtu.be/Axy2RP_Xvd0) He basically says everything that I could say and also talks about a lot of other problems with the game. Even though the video is old it's still pretty accurate.
---
yes because annoying people is "good work"
---
Ever since I saw it on the forum, I've been gunning for them to add the "Red Riding Hood" Kate lol.
---
LMAAAAAAAAO
---
oh thx
---
Probably were wondering how the killer always knew when they got back on a gen. I‚Äôve been running Surveillance on my Huntress because I just prestiged and don‚Äôt have much on her now, but you‚Äôd be surprised how many people I‚Äôve caught multiple times because they keep getting back on the same gen. Then I‚Äôm called a camper, of course, but that‚Äôs beside the point lol
---
I just think it's funny that he knows the exact wrong thing to say in every situation, it's like a gift.
---
I agree with him on not being much of a spirit fury person. Is it really that good? If so ig I can give it a try!
---
F‚Äôs in the chat
---
i played him once at like rank 15 and all the survivors dc'd and one said he isn't fair or fun to go against lol... so there's a little anecdote
---
STOP TALKING!!!!
---
I‚Äôm a simple human I see cat I upvote
---
I'm also running surveillance a lot üòÇ it's a pretty good perk after they changed it üëç
---
this isn't the ptb
---
Why? Cause fuck em thats why
---
Plague is not hard to run to 4K unless you lack  a brain. You can easily set yourself up well with a situational Plague build
---
PREACH THE HOLY WORD! BBQ IS OVERRATED! USE PERKS YOU THINK THAT ARE BAD JUST TO TEST THEM!
---
Ok so what would be ‚Äúbad things‚Äù to do in survivor
---
i woulde been too confused to even try to hit you. i react slowly
---
I will admit that things like generator speed, camping / tunneling, three gen strats, and other problems are not just a "change X to fix Y" problem. If they were they would've been fixed by now. But I really hate how a lot of these problems just get a perk bandaid slapped onto them as Behavior states "you have a perk to counter it so problem solved. :)"
---
A lot of perks that exist to fix broken mechanics (notibly the likes of Mad Grit and of course Decisive Strike) are pretty much built upon how effective the tactic they counter is. Mad Grit is trash cause only overly-altruistic SWF teams bodyblock, Decisive is meta because tunneling is so effective.
---
I got into it half a year before they went F2P. In my opinion it was the best time to play it. They just had a couple of balancing issues, everything else was top notch. F2P was a nice idea but they changed the gameplay too much and had to cut away half of the content because of that. Yeah the devs were to blame and the publisher crazed from the "potential" dlc sales. But it was also deeper than that. The game was too smart and demanding for the average  gamer. I had a couple of friends who i could play the game with but when you went in with a couple of randoms , anything could happen. Voicecom and coordination or lack of it made or broke a lot of the matches. And a lot of players would or could not understand that. When the teamplay worked though... few games have ever come close to the feeling i got when me and my team took down a challenging monster player. Hell, sometimes i lost after a hard fight, and even that felt like time well spent. Evolve at it's best was great, and in the end i'm just happy that i got to experience it.
---
With any p3 character, unused perk slot grants 25% bp bonus.
---
It's bugged right now. The first person to go down while or after the exit gates are powered usually doesn't make the timer go slower. I've seen it slow down sometimes but not all the time so I don't know what causes the bug.
---
&gt; Mained killer for a year and stopped Checks flair
---
I still play Wraith. Other killers are a bit too easy or boring, but I do enjoy Huntress/ Billy/ Hag. I like getting better at M1 chases and using what I know. I don't go for kills but almost every game (easily at least 80%) I hook everyone 3 times before gates are powered.
---
&gt;Ok lol but the first method you gave of playing is not fun for survivors at all
---
Exactly.
---
&gt;And I‚Äôm sure majority of killer mains wouldn‚Äôt find that fun either
---
That's why the "2 kills = fair game" thing doesn't sit well with me.
---
8 hooks on the other hand I'd consider a win/ fair game.

i think a vampire themed killer would be possible but yea it most definitely wouldnt be dracula himself
---
i'm sure he was, didn't even had time to type my laughter
---
Basically it was shit. Horrible unprofessional hosts that noone knew, that were not knowledgeable about the game at all. Large amounts of lag that caused unfair outcomes in many matches. Almost every big game was just nurse and 4 clauds. The decision of the winners of the competition was very controversial and honestly bullshit due to poor explanation of the rules. It basically ended up being one of the worst things that has happened in this game's lifetime that literally noone in the community liked.
---
This is just as toxic or more lmao.
---
youd have to be against an idiot for them to run straight into a gen though lol. i dont see this being useful after hes out and ppl know how to play against him.
---
You‚Äôre in good company here - I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. Some survivors just try to preach a BS moral code that killer‚Äôs have to abide by or be labeled as tunneling assholes. Ultimately it‚Äôs just salty survivors taking out their frustration on the other team because they don‚Äôt want to own the fact that they messed up
---
No but if your dead in hook you can sacrifice yourself for a boost for teammates or something
---
‚Äútake 16 protection hits in a trial to activate this perk‚Äù

Yeah, i commented that in another post in this subreddit and got downvoted to oblivion üôÑ

yea i always assume a Billy has NOED. even in red ranks

Will do

yeah that makes more sense

*Entity Displeased*

Guess the sex and win a prize.

I guess so

Shirtless freddy
---
Hes not actually the same as ghostface and can provide less stress in terms of getting an exposed effect
---
Very worth it if you enjoy a stalker killer too
---
Can Doctors power down survivors, nurse, Clown, Freddy, Plague, Pig, Hag, Wraith. Are all they grabarge too?
---
Yo chucky would be really funny
---
I use my own money and they are part of the killer dlcs anyway
---
‚ÄúWow toxic killer mains lmfao‚Äù I say as I casually equip an instaheal with adrenaline, balanced landing and urban evasion without skipping a beat
---
it either lets the survivor win the chase or buy their team more time to do gens. there are also instances where it helps the survivor escape - for example if the hatch or exit gate is close by. no matter what happens (unless u miss the skill check), its a win/win
---
reminds me of the claudette that opened the locker i was in, on purporse when i only stayed in it for literally less than 10 seconds just to avoid the killer.
---
Some people don't have enough time to grind points for characters they won't play? Not everyone has a lot of free time.
---
On Ghostface, remembering the pallet stun nerf now, not really. His built in thrilling tremors is good, or haunted grounds to scare them from doing hexes
---
1. Nurse, Clown, and Hag's powers literally can down survivors.
---
2. Yes. The rest of those are garbage.
---
I mean to be fair the only reason this happened was because the Nea was stupidly teabagging at powered.
---
If you're going to do something stupid like that and waste a pallet then you should be punished for it
---
I'd love to see Hannibal tho
---
I'm sure many survivors run the same perks too (wouldn't know personally) but lordy is it boring to vs killers with the same perks every match. Made my friend group stop playing as often as we were. Just passing that feedback / reasoning on because I think the game needs to focus on survivors being a more appealing choice, as there needs to be much more players on that side simply from a queue time perspective.
---
Threads like this turn into killer circle jerks fast because hey, you're all in queue ;P
---
Don't worry you saw the error of your ways. Just kneel down inside the basement with an offering and your sins shall be cleansed.
---
Ah shit -_-
---
gg ez bhvr
---
The shining guy would be literally perfect.
---
I can't help but laugh at some of the buff survivor posts I find on the web. I mean damn if I didn't know any better I'd think they want a 100% chance of escape.
---
I do not agree with this.
---
With the new Freddy his main power is teleporting to gens and for the rest he is just an m1 killer.
---
The dreampallets only work on survivors who do not pay attention and do not even think about using it in rank 1 against a sfw.
---
The snares are ok at best.
---
The new Freddy is very much like a faster hag but with a shitty power.
---
Teleporting to gens is the best thing in his kit but that has a large cooldown and only works on not completed generators.
---
So at that point you can just better use the hillbilly.
---
I hope they change the traps/dream pallets since I do not see Freddy being played in higher ranks.
---
Wait, no don‚Äôt go this game needs people like you
---
I could see it work with hex ruin and a mori too
---
Is that a dead meat reference?
---
Ardetha‚Äôs got a Nurse guide right [here](https://youtu.be/EfnmZvK4l88).
---
I WANT THE PIN HEAD SO MUCH
---
what was the post chat like lol
---
Seriously the best guide ever.
---
I remember playing Wraith and getting that exact location. Once there was only one gen left, the last two were right by each other and it was fucking battle to finish one of them. I'm certain that they could finish it right under my nose of any of them knew that gen was there.
---
My statement was more of a troll statement. Survivors don‚Äôt escape 100% of the time. 
---
They escape a lot but not 100%. I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúcan‚Äôt reliably get past the tracking‚Äù means. 
---
Your job isn‚Äôt to juke them, it‚Äôs to run loops and structures efficiently.
---
There no way right now unless you haven‚Äôt played in a while. There was an update where the killer load out is hidden until the match ends.
---
nothing because he instantly left
---
I think every dc should count as a sacrifice tbh.
---
You‚Äôre**
---
It‚Äôs always the Feng/Nea with these exact cosmetics. At this point I just don‚Äôt say anything back and let them do the talking. It pisses them off even more when you don‚Äôt say anything. ;)
---
I don't think Penny wise is too similar to the Clown. They added leather face and he is the inspiration for the hillbilly. Chainsaw weapon, hammer weapon, and messed up face. Plus clown throws toxic bottles and Penny wise is like a fucking demon lol
---
I have no clue. Just found it and used it
---
‚ÄúWe have improve the totem placement‚Äù
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night mate!  
---
You believe that is it grants you solace...
---
Btw, you say those other names like they should mean anything to me... Neither is it their fault that you ditched your team for a hatch escape.
---
What a loser, I‚Äôd def have messaged him lol
---
Obligatory&gt;&gt; *Pretty good job so far..*
---
So what, you can purposely waste the killers time because you lost the game?
---
Excited for shirtless Myers! Oh wait.
---
You‚Äôre right, that may be an issue
---
I know it was a troll statement but I put the discussion flair on this post and I'd like to discuss the details. I mean I can be completely out of the killers attack and still get hit. I guess the real question I want to know is the game balanced around SWF v Killer? Am I wasting time, energy,  and patience rolling with randoms?
---
Yeah man sabo'ing hooks is sooo toxic. 
---
Sorry I forgot you're only allowed to criticize survivor behavior on this sub. When survivors complain about something a killer does, they are just entitled.
---
When a killer complains about something a survivor does its totally justified because survivors are sooo OP and the killer is just playing the way he wants.
---
I'll make sure to add "sabo'ing hooks" to "things survivors arent supposed to do" in entitled killers handbook. Ill put it right next to bringing a flashlight, doing gens, using perks, and looping pallets.
---
The EGC is there for that very reason.
---
every rank reset I always let one person live
---
Yep.
---
That sounds real stupid if ya ask me. (In terms of solo survivor, in terms of survive with friends this is very good and I‚Äôm ok with this)
---
Perhaps they can update it so only survive with friends players can‚Äôt see it or if there‚Äôs a survive with friends team in the match, that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs invisible?
---
I wonder if we are ever gonna see him or Vigo...
---
It would be cool though that the Entity warps one of their minds and makes them a killer... I mean how long can you endure madness before you succumb, right?
---
What does that have to do with this at all?
---
No they dont. None of those powers do anything on their own. They require the player to do something.
---
Cool man
---
No you nerfed a perk into an anti tunneling perk
---
Doctor let me and dwight escape after he chased us around and electrocuted us
---
I mean you can message the players in the game load outs. Which I‚Äôve received, so this just seems like it doesn‚Äôt need changing.
---
Still, you're not playing the game, as such, the game told the killer to end said game
---
As a killer main I can say this isn‚Äôt wasting my time, he still has a chance, a slim one sure but a chance.
---
good survivors force m1 -&gt; noed gets value because the billy is forced to m1
---
Damn I thought this was one of those high quality renders. Nice!
---
(I don‚Äôt get it, can you please explain it)
---
So I drew an island and I drew "An island" *n*ext to it, then it's a bad drawing? How about you actually critisize his drawing?
---
Yeah, but imagine if they removed that system and you tried playing Doctor who doesn't give madness to survivors in the locker
---
Breathtaking üòç
---
WhEN yOu WAnT tO gEt uP, yOu nEeD a liTTle REvivE...
---
I don‚Äôt think in that case it‚Äôs fine either. I mean you can message the players in the game load outs. Which I‚Äôve received, so this just seems like it doesn‚Äôt need changing. There is no way for a killer to know anything but item they bring in.
---
I use BBQ primarily for the BP gain. I don't even use the aura reading that much or forget that it is a thing, but every time I am not running BBQ I feel like I'm playing "wrong" because I willfully deny myself additional easy Bloodpoints.
---
I mean that's not a bad idea but if they do that, they're going to have to balance it out on the other side, like increase generator times. They also have to change a lot of maps in the game, since a lot of maps have incredibly stupid structures like the disturbed ward middle, shelter woods since it sometimes barely spawns any pallets,Haddonfield and in general make maps smaller since most maps in the game are huge, making victory for killers with no map control (which is like, 95% of killers) almost impossible. (I know map design is completely unrelated to what we are talking about and I'm sorry for bringing it up but man a lot of maps in this game tilt me to no end)
---
&gt;Like we have a public test build: why the fuck can't shit get fucking publicly tested?
---
This. Things that get put in the ptb don't necessarily have to end up on live servers, I don't see a problem with testing some ideas out and seeing what the community thinks of it.
---
&gt;Behavior's development time is so slow it makes Half Life 3's development look like one of those fast-forwarded life cycle videos on the nature channel.
---
That made me laugh
---
(btw, are they even developing half life 3? just curious)
---
He did, however, he specifically said in the post that he stayed in the locker out of spite.
---
I like to think that I know how the devs balance this game. 
---
It‚Äôs fairly hard to balance things because four good survivors will always beat one good killer, if that killer isn‚Äôt Nurse and sometimes spirit. 
---
One good survivor can win the game for his team if the killer doesn‚Äôt break off them in a chase. Even four good randoms can beat one good killer. 
---
Doing gens aren‚Äôt hard and they don‚Äôt take long that long. Maps are survivor favored. Killers can‚Äôt afford to make any mistakes the higher they climb. And sometimes it‚Äôs downright impossible for a killer to actually win a game. 
---
Once dedicated servers come, survivors are getting a pretty big buff.
---
I mean they both survive serious throat injuries.
---
Whilst Tapp dies trying to save a family and apprehend the person who he thinks is the jigsaw killer.
---
Strahm dies because he didn't listen to the tape
---
"If the player doesn't do anything these powers can't down people"
---
What flawless logic.
---
Yes, if we're going by the logic of what the killer is like if they're AFK, Nurse is indeed unlikely to win games.
---
It's not like the only killer who can injure/down survivors without doing anything is Trapper with double pink add-ons.
---
He instantly left too. Outplayed dummy
---
80% of my playtime is on survivors and only recently have I picked up killers. I have noticed FAR MORE toxicity coming from survivors. You also twisted my words because you know you're wrong and I'm right. Running 4 of those offerings and 99ing every hook is toxic. Just sabotaging is a mechanic of the game, whatever that's fine but this is an example of an EXTREME.
---
This game is far too easy for survivors because no matter what the killer is always at a disadvantage(unless there's a dc). If you facecamp you're a scumbag but 2 gens can be done in that time or the survivor can get rescued by BT. If you tunnel then you run the high risk of getting looped, palleted and tbagged. As it stands now gens are done way too fast and the killer doesn't feel threatening most of the time. Yes killers are at fault sometimes but survivors are more toxic 95% of the time. I wouldn't be surprised if you pallet loop at killer shack with a 22 clickity clack flashlight and tbag. Go bitch somewhere else dude.
---
I think hitboxes are like this for the feeling of the hit and not the visual
---
There been multiple times where I can guarantee I hit someone but the game lags at the last second to give them ultra instinct and just phase through my attack (I know UI doesn‚Äôt let the user phase through hits but dodge them but it‚Äôs the best summary I had)
---
Sorry for that second paragraph having nothing to do with your comment I‚Äôm just upset about how bad internet survivors can cause me to miss someone right in front of me, doesn‚Äôt mean killers are free from being cause of lag though, killers cause lag too and it sucks
---
How about "Good skillchecks don't exist" (Only the great skillcheck area appears) but you get double match xp for those bloodshards.
---
NOED gets no value. If 5 gens are done, you're a shit Billy.
---
The devs have commented on this very thing. The crows are not your friend. The crows are the Entity's minions and the killer's allies. They're there to help them, not you.
---
Excuse you?
---
Into the sea!
---
I mean that wouldn't work considering after the first film Gordon had been working with John the entire time
---
Idc what *you* did. If you need to explain the drawing then obviously it's a bad drawing. Kinda like a joke. If you have to explain the joke it was never funny. You know, like your life. harharhar. Take your virtue signaling soy tears somewhere else.
---
Always make sure to report them
---
Idk TBH putting in too many perks causes the problem of diluting the bloodweb. How about have a modifier added to existing perks where your 4th perk slot gets the modifier active as long as one of the other 3 is a negative perk?
---
That fact you replied to my post with this garbage is fucking hysterical.
---
I sure am glad the irony isnt lost on you.
---
noed gives survivors the exposed status which means they'll go down in one hit, and if they force an m1 then you'll be able to take them down immediately. that gives value because instead of having to hit them twice you hit them only once.
---
I was doing a daily with the plague and after i caught this random my barbeque propped and off in the distance i could see 3 survivor auras all crouch marching towards me, we had a good farming game
---
I honestly think the ranking system is to blame. I aim for 2k's and try to 2-hook everyone before starting any kills. I temper my gameplay accordingly, but it can be disheartening to get slapped with an Entity Displeased. My idea of a successful game is if I get 25k+ points regardless of kills. 
---
I wish there was more emphasis put on having fun instead of winning. I feel like neither side really has the time to enjoy the game if they want a reliable chance of winning. I would love for more gameplay elements and perks that create interesting decisions. Lately killer and survivor perks have revolved around taking away options instead of creating difficult choices. I'd like to see a lot more risk/reward scenarios added.
---
Tldr; Sorry this kinda turned into a weird ramble, but essentially I don't blame players for how they act, I blame the game for pushing players into certain playstyles.
---
**cha cha real smooth**

Yeah the saw franchise is all over the place lol. I think they should just make it like legion with multiple jigsaw killers
---
I'm a fan of this.
---
The thing is though: you didn't lose the game when NOED activates. The game is still going. Plus, when you have an endgame build together with Blood Warden or something similar, including NOED is not about "having lost the game" it's about giving survivors a false sense of security, which is a nice tactic itself.  
---
This is not even going into the topic of just cleansing it away.
---
Got it the first day he came out. He has solid perks honestly
---
Yea I do but it seems like nothing really happens
---
Hahahahahahha! Right?! Btw, I love the colors of your perks and add ons
---
Predator would be really cool but would be either too close to wraith or huntress.
---
"Why don't you feel shitty like I told you have to for running perk X?! Now I am going to insult your RANK, ha! That will teach you!"
---
Sounds like the perfect rebuttal :)
---
What‚Äôs the max haste effect percentage? Highest i remember is like 7 I think. The killer is already slightly faster than you and NOED gives 5% so I don‚Äôt see it as better than AND
---
I can agree with this. As survivor I actually tend to see more variety. SC is far less common now. At high ranks it‚Äôs simply a detriment with how much time it wastes.
---
Adrenaline is probably the most popular survivor perk I see now.
---
I don‚Äôt even see UE nearly as much.
---
Just when you thought you were gettin away! You silly bitch.
---
Yeah his funny moments series are the only vids of his i watch. Theyre pretty good, since most of them are submitted by others you dont even need to hear his voice that much.
---
Have I just stepped back into the hell that is Modern Warfare 2?
---
Yessssss! He is sooooo much fun. There a ton of different builds you can use with him and the grabs are awesome!
---
I had never seen it either until yesterday
---
I mean that also really wouldn't work as they would have to change the entire pig backstory.
---
Legions backstory specifically stated it took all four of them not just one.
---
The pigs backstory specifically states it just took Amanda it even gives a bit of explanation about her reaction to first being in the entity's realm.
---
Every killers fear.
---
Thank you but i didn¬¥t draw them myself \^\^
---
Sometimes in a 2/4 remaining 1/4 currently hooked scenario, the free player will sit on the hatch and wait out the hook timer so they can escape easily.
---
Short answer: It's just what this game does to people. A cycle that always continues. 
---
People don't want to play sweaty or against someone sweaty all the time. Let's be honest, everything that's used at high ranks is bullshit. Everything that has become meta in this game had one thing in common: The other side couldn't do shit against it. That's not fun to play against, so people decide to de-rank to have a more pleasant experience. Then they possibly have a shitty match against a sweaty killer who deranks too, and they decide the next, more newer killer has to pay for it.
---
This has been going on for 3 years, I don't think it will change in the near future. The game's fundamentals would have to be changed drastically, and we all know that won't happen.
---
Wow this is great!
---
Pff seriously?
---
 I'm just patiently waiting until one faithful day they announce a my bloody valentine chapter and when that happens I'm going to main the fuck of Harry Warden. He is so highly requested they have no reason not to add him.
---
Ideal state of balance for killers is that they could kill two people in an average match. But throwin solo queues and SWF into the mix, and it's really impossible to balance it perfectly.
---
I feel like as a survivor, I should be dying sliiiightly more than ... half the time maybe. On average.
---
The Djinn would be boss to have in the game. I didn't see Angela from Night of the Demons here so she is another. Gwenyth Paltrow is another killer just would take ages to Die in game to her.
---
Why do you think I stopped using it? üò≠
---
I get what you're trying to say: "Hey you can do without the perk if you improve."  
---
But the flipside of this is: "Hey you can improve, still use the perk, and be even stronger."  
---
I don't get the hate for NOED, really don't, not as a killer player and not as a survivor player. Plus, in a world where everyone and their nanny uses adrenaline (or even coordinated adrenaline), NOED is a viable counter when the match hasn't gone so well up until that point.
---
I didn't last game only because they were standing on the hatch and I was Freddy. Idk if they forgot I can close it or were returning to the game after a hiatus but they felt safe since I had to put them to sleep. I stood there and they weren't jumping in so I slammed it shut and you could tell they were confused and then I killed them lol. So 99% of the time I do
---
i think nothing but ikd
---
Same here, getting stomped by rank 12 killers as a rank 18 newbie really doesn't help me learn the ropes, and it gets very boring. Not to mention they all pick the sweatiest possible builds. More half of my games have been against Spirit and Billy, whom i can't possibly counterplay properly as a complete noob. Hell, i still haven't even managed to learn how to loop properly, don't pit me up against these kinds of people with these kind of killers.
---
But the match is ended. You'll squeeze out one extra kill.
---
Pallets are gone. If you're chasing a healthy survivor, and #5 popped, they're not gonna have a pallet to stop you from chainsawing. Unless of course you resigned to following them to a cancerous building with enough windows to stall you till a gate is opened.
---
The egc exists solely to keep the game from running longer than it needs to, by staying in a locker I am not holding the game hostage or causing a delay. 
---
*you're just mad that I have an opinion*
---
Ok, but Feng Min is Chinese.
---
I'm glad that we agree that I'm wrong and you have 2 functioning neurons.
---
I've been saying Pinhead would be an absolutely awesome killer.
---
Question
---
Does the timer end at the left properly or is the timer slightly off? Got entitied a full second before the timer would have hit end. Even the killer didn‚Äôt know why and they knew the endgame collapse pretty well
---
It would be nice to see them both in a upcoming chapter
---
you need to censor the name (Rule 3)
---
I sure don't
---
it‚Äôs all good, i just really like the art lmao
---
If he spawns as a Survivor on the title screen,  he may say a voice line then, too. It's happened to me a couple times on PS4.
---
American Psycho, the guy in the pic is Christian Bale
---
I honestly can get what your saying. I mean it's makes perfect sense I don't necessarily play TO win I just like to be altruistic. That is where my fun comes from. In fact my idea of a good game is anything above 10-12k points. I'm fine with getting downed or trade hooked as long as my team is being productive.
---
**We CaN dAnCe ThRoUgH tHe DaNgEr**
---
you wont need to run away to a door with noed and you can guarantee that the chase there will end in a hook rather than gambling at the doors
---
Anybody else remember the tourney they had where the people that one were lag switching nurses? Lol
---
God why are you people so stiff? I literally put a laughing emoji emptying it‚Äôs a joke
---
&gt;You depip with 8k objective points, 200 altruism points, 1k boldness and a boring fucking match.
---
In these cases: when a match has been going this badly you probably still got more out of it due to NOED, so it worked. Another problem why so many killer players are defending the perk is that it is used to ridicule them and their playstyle. This is especially true for new killers who might not even have anything better in their bloodweb. If the group of survivor players who routinely say things like "noob", "crutch perk", "you suck" etc. would simply hold their horses for a minute, the NOED 'problem' wouldn't escalate so much.  
---
I've met quite some killer players who use it out of spite just because they have been so aggressively attacked for using it, even when they were obviously new to the game. So at least in part, the wide spread of NOED is a homecooked 'problem'.
---
Look at reply
---
Ghostface is still fine and his lean detection is bugged
---
"I don't have arguments or an elaborate opinion so FUCK YOU random internet guy lol"
---
Since we‚Äôre on survivors let‚Äôs switch to killers
---
Huntresses is furry lesbian
---
Ahahahahaha he was big mad üòÇ
---
It was an accident but I wasn‚Äôt gonna waste the mori
---
If you go off of the saw franchise itself it makes tons of sense. The backstory wouldnt be a hard edit just say the entity took other jigsaw killers.
---
Adrenaline just gives you a speed boost, the health state gained doesn't matter if the killer has NOED so if i'm running Dead Hard with Hope i essentially have 2 health states. And 107% vs 118% is better than 100% vs 118% :)
---
**me like when people scream from Zappy zaps**
---
gonna be real with you chief if im death hook anyways and i can just pull out a grenade to stun the killer for 5 seconds instead of watching that fuckn hook animation for the 800000th time then ill take that any day of the week
---
I'm just going by your logic saying legion's power cant down survivors man
---
it is in the game mech to tunnel/camp. don't get me wrong I hate tunneling too. but if the killers tunnel you. the killer won't apply pressure on gens so your time is most likely to win. I always run barrow time and advise other players to run that perk as primary slot to make the tunnelers whine at end chat
---
I run that sometimes actually most of the time I run that survivor build
---
That's sucks. Luckily I was playing swf and my friend talked me through what I couldn't see. It was like playing the game on hard mode
---
Just gonna have to have more asians

I don't give a fk about your opinion, there is reason why those crows are there. Facts.
---
The joke in my original post is that killers complain that gens get done too fast, but when survivors try to do sonething else (like bring a sabo squad) killers still complain. 
---
Its a joke you dumb motherfucker. 
---
The fact you responded with essentially a copy pasta complaining about toxic survivors, without a hint of irony, shows how fucking dense you are.
---
Jesus chirst this sub.
---
I think I'll have Ruin, BBQ and also um... The Enduring + Spirit Fury bundle
---
And now the salty survivor has as well. You have to censor the names of other gamer tags.
---
Looks good
---
Dunno what those 3 are even doing except Bill running away but it looks god.
---
Who in the absolute fuck is going to be "caught off guard" by a generator exploding in blood that will or will not have a guy walking out of a pool of blood right next to it

Something taste bitter....

It ain't the coffee. So it must be you.
---
Yeah, the cat knows what's cool.
---
I don‚Äôt even play killer, but this is too much.
---
Funny thing is that it didn't matter. You had max BP.
---
It goes for everyone: Talk shit, get hit.
---
That sounds like a decent way to get a lot of points. You SHOULD get a lot of points for sacrificing yourself, but I'm not sure how I like players intentionally killing themselves to stun the killer for a good length of time.
---
Survivors just have more options in my opinion. Everyone has a favorite exhaustion perk, it's not always Dead Hard. Then you have D.Strike, Unbreakable, Borrowed Time, Bond for solo players, the ever-popular but not-meta Plunderer's and Ace in the Hole. There isn't a single perk, not even Adrenaline, that is as often used as BBQ and Ruin.
---
Basically, killers only have two perk slots and that's a problem. Something needs balancing. Other perks need to be buffed, or those two need to be nerfed.
---
Yeah, big problem. I wonder why you have to double pip as killer, but as survivor you only have to escape ü§î
---
Urban Evasion is garbage.
---
Yeah
---
Its a joke. 
---
But yeah, i forgot you cant criticize killer behavior on this sub. So my bad. Hope i didnt shatter too many fragile egos.
---
I understand, use prayer beads
---
Yay!
---
I've been called racial slurs multiple times. Had a guy DC because I was playing nurse and then go on my account on Steam and talk shit on every single screenshot I had. Keep in mind I have like 250 fucking screenshots.
---
So the killer is the host, so naturally any 50/50 scenarios will go towards the killer. And every single small win gives momentum, especially if you get them injured. Sometimes a killer will also ‚Äújoke‚Äù the game and get a very undeserved hit. 
---
However, most 50/50 scenarios are when a killer just barely hits them, or hits them right as they drop the pallet or sometimes at a window. With dedicated servers coming, the killer will (probably) lose these 50/50 scenarios which in turn takes away momentum. Assuming they don‚Äôt fuck the servers up or anything weird doesn‚Äôt happen of course. 
---
Obviously we‚Äôd need to play on these new servers for a while to determine anything, but I‚Äôm not too hopeful for killers.

Poor hex spawns? Haunted grounds. Other poor hex spawns? Small Game.
---
I agree! Lol but just like you said there usually is no in between you either have your allies gen rushing or all 3 of them trying to save the same person at 5 gens. It's strange but despite its balancing issues I still love it. Only so many good horror games out there.
---
You don't *need* kills on bad games though. If they can outplay you playing fair, just let them go, they earned it. Why MUST you get the kill?
---
And that's not considering the fact that in any scenario where a 5th gen pops you should be downing whoever you're chasing as Billy *anyway*. NOED would only make it probably a chainsaw rev amount of time quicker.
---
You can tell he plays CS:GO by the colourful vocabulary
---
I once managed to get three t-bagging Neas right by the exit as Bubba.
---
Well, it makes sense. Survivors have way more options. Killers have one job, and there's almost objectively one best way to do it, with a bit of flex depending on which Killer.
---
IT is as powerful as the entity. It'd be a stupid addition.
---
Child rapist.
---
Well there are some, it really depends on the topic though! Not every statement is political, but there will always be \*political statements\* about a certain topic.  
---
Like, how I think that danish dry blue cheese is far superior to french camembert or brie. Fight me!
---
Freddy's got moves
---
There power has no effect to down but thats not the point. 
---
Legion can get a free easy first hit, gets tracking from that hit, can then stall and make them waste time to mend or down, and can go acorss the map at a rapid pace and can avoid loops at the same time .
---
Your just a bad playter. Also, Doctor as a bad killer means you really dont know shit
---
Imagine telling someone to kill themselves over a video game. You're fucking pathetic.
---
I agree. When I play killer I normally get either 4K playing against complete potatoes or I meet a really good SWF and get no kills at all. Seldom anything in between...
---
Tbh it can be that way on both sides, but so far with the way my games are going when I don't run ruin/noed I don't blame killers for running those perks.
---
You mad?
---
That version of tunneling (going after an unhooked played) is thinking like a pack of wolves and going for the weaker prey and not an asshole approach. Blame the teammate for rescuing you at a bad time
---
‚ÄúBut campers!‚Äù
---
Tell your pals to gen rush to punish the killer for his current choice.
---
‚ÄúHe still won‚Äôt leave..‚Äù
---
You lost, oh well, move on. There‚Äôs more fun to be had in other games, my good friend!
---
That‚Äôs b/c it‚Äôs extremely hard to play w/o them at red ranks. You can run no perks on survivor and be completely fine
---
Rozen zijn rood, droog veen heet turf,
---
Freddy OP, pls nerf
---
There are 16 killers now. You could play a lot and rarely see him because of that factor alone. Your own personal experience does not define reality for everyone else.
---
Fair enough I mean it does have to be balanced for both sides. I mean I feel like I die about half the time.. But then again I rarely play SWF so that's just a random's luck. Would you believe me if I said dying can be fun?
---
make it so he wears dwight's glasses
---
This looks so REAL i feel like that photo filter does a lot tho
---
\&gt; They're literally failing at their only job as killer   
---
I read this a lot of times but no one seems to be able to tell me: why?
---
Their only job is to hook survivors and it's counted a win if they get at least 2 AFAIR. So even after they have "won" and the other two survivors are opening the gate, they could still get use out of NOED, without "failing at their job".
---
Would love for the miner to be a killer, but any ideas for his power?
---
Nice family photo
---
Trapper would be like really bitch you have a grenade how‚Äôd you even bring it here
---
That's been happening w my games every time I face her now
---
It's no link tho, I uploaded it directly to the reddit server. That's weird.
---
My favorite is whenever I catch one messing around at the gate and then trigger blood warden. Idk how many times I‚Äôve went from having 0-1k to 4k because of that.
---
NOED
---
no one escapes death
---
As long as the hex totem associated with this perk isn‚Äôt destroyed, you one shot all survivors when the exit gate are powered
---
I don't buy characters for perks. I buy characters to have them and because I like the game. Your point is valid for survivors but most of the time they're included with a killer, anyway.
---
It's from a song called &lt;&lt;Baby I'm Yours&gt;&gt;. In this scene he says &lt;&lt;you were the clock that was ticking in my heart&gt;&gt;
---
Dude, that's an infinite :o
---
I‚Äôm a killer main and when I play survivor any killer makes me crap my pants
---
with killers like freddy who have little pressure that‚Äôs not possible.  doctor, nurse, and billy apply lots of map pressure but freddy, pig, etc, can‚Äôt apply map pressure, and therefore can‚Äôt stop gen progression even if they guard generators.  with pig she has her traps, at least.
---
This shit happened yesterday I got told I was tunneling when they would unhook right in front of me
---
I only have BBQ and chili on one killer cause it never drops in bloodweb for me, no reason why it just doesn‚Äôt.

happens to a lot of killers.  it‚Äôs OchiPedo‚Äôs number 1 glitch he loves to put in his montages

You just have a habit of making assumptions based upon your own opinions and saying any other rationale is dumb, don't you? I'm gonna guess you're 13? Any older than that and you're just sad.
---
Other player was injured, not hooked...so he was waiting on the hatch for the other guy to get killed so he could escape, instead of helping.
---
Are you talking about ptb freddy or live freddy?
---

---
How do the Universal Classic Monsters not fit the tone of the game when we already have an ancient Mesopotamian Priestess in the game? The Mummy would have the exact tone.
---
An I wouldn't count animal killers that are at least humanoid in appearance out, seeing as how our next chapter is most likely going to be a Stranger Things chapter. Pumkinhead and the Xenomorph are possible. 
---
IMHO, between now and next December I foresee the following killers having a great chance in showing up:
---
* Demogrogon (Stranger Things)
---
* Candyman (Candyman)
---
* Valak (The Conjuring)
---
All three are popular and would tie into recent films or TV shows. 
---
I'd also give these killers a small chance of showing up:
---
* Xenomorph (Alien)
---
* Dracula (Dracula)
---
* Pinhead (Hellraiser)
---
* The Tall Man (Phantasm)
---
* Cordell (Maniac Cop)
---
* Pumkinghead (Pumkinhead)
---
* Chucky (Child's Play)
---
* Sadako (Ring)
---
All are popular but each have issues holding them back. Xenomorph and Chucky would require more work than your average killer. Pinhead is owned by the same company as Scream and considering what happened with Ghostface it's not a guarantee he's obtainable. The Tall Man, Pumkinhead, and Cordell are all a bit too niche. Sadako would require dealing with a Japanese company and I'm not sure Behaviour has any Japanese-speaking staff among the high level employees who deal with liscnened content. Dracula is iconic but does Universal have a need or want to advertise him? 
---
I'm not touching video games as the OP's tier list doesn't. But if I did Resident Evil has a good shot of getting in. The R3 remake will come out next year and Capcom has done crossovers with non-Japanese companies before. Resident Evil even had a crossover event with PBUG of all things.
---
 Hmm I don‚Äôt understand (I‚Äôm a little new here).

Hey, that's what you think about it, if it gets rid of people that are practically braindead then I don't mind them doing it

I actually had a whole SWF yell at me for camping when all 3 of them were In a 20 meter radius around the one guy I had hooked. Like where else do you want me to go?

Haha I can manage to speak a little bit. When my fathers cousins kids whom are German were 5 years old we could hold a conversation. Now they are 9 I think. So now they can speak German to me and with some processing I‚Äôll understand, but I can‚Äôt answer them. But lucky me they are pretty good at understanding English.
---
My pwrsonal alternative to ruin is the overcharge and pgtw combo  but that's 2 perk slots and you have to play so sweaty you fall off your chair.
---
I'm getting facecamped again by that same killer
---
Have you considered trying to engage people in conversation when a question post or discussion post gets posted? 
---
I have discussions with people quite often.
---
Perks that are meant for immersed players are garbage in my view but I can't tell you how to play. It just seems weird to list that alongside Adrenaline and Balanced Landing as overused survivor perks.
---
they are working on some story event stuff
---
You know, i wonder, how the game would look like if the suggestions of all the salty players got eared and became impossible for them to keep blaming it
---
Ik but does meg have a penis
---
One thing all killer need to have in mind, anything is toxic by the eyes of a enraged survivor, even playing the game (found this on some posts around here)
---
One reason to clean totems is if the killer has noed, once the last generator is finished it will transform a dull totem, if any remain, into noed.
---
Another reason is if the killer has thrill of the hunt, each totem that hasn't been cleansed makes cleansing totems slower, so if you cleanse all the dull totems you'll cleanse the hex totems quicker. Then the killer will have less time to get to the hex totem before you cleanse it.
---
Otherwise dull totems don't have any power, they just give you some boldness (?) Bloodpoints for cleaning them, which is going to be buffed in the next update I think.
---
So satisfying
---
Honestly the community has been getting super toxic lately.  Last game I played, I was the pig and got called a tunnler despite not at all tunneling. I just kept running into the same dumbasses who didn't understand how to run away. What you did was fine, a decent strategy to bait out the last guy, but it seems the survivors will pretty much find something to complain about if they don't win. Best to take what is said with a grain of salt. As long as you aren't purposely being a dick it is fine.
---
Hey dude fuck you what‚Äôs your fucking problem? You should NEVER refer to someone as ‚Äúit‚Äù that‚Äôs so fucking shitty
---
It would be nice if the devs made their own killer again. Last non-licesenced killer was the plague, so hopefully they follow the pattern of OC killer, then licensed killer.
---
The classic sneaky beaky
---
Just kidding, I stopped playing after this.
---
I literally can not count how many times this has happened. I‚Äôve actually had a few suggest that it was either an actual rule, or what I‚Äôd have done if I were ‚Äúgood‚Äù to run straight to the other side of the map after hooking someone. 
---
They especially don‚Äôt seem to like that I almost always take the opportunity to slug as many of them as possible.
---
Defiantly me when I play SWF
---
Well, that happens when you play killer.
---
If you play survivor, the totem seems to be in the killer's ass, because it's nowhere to be found.
---
Ochido himself is not the brightest DBDtuber

This was the case, injured dude was Scooby-Doo-ing my ass over a generator that was 95% finished when I lost him, so I started patrolling the other generators and caught this guy. In his defense he might have been fixing the nearby generator and hid when he heard my heartbeat, but he sure was staring intently at the hatch.

You could have said absolutely anything to show how salty and how much of a crybaby you are about a fucking add on, yet you want people to kill themselves to have ‚Äúless braindead‚Äù people in this world???
---
Imagine being that fucking mad over an ADD ON in a VIDEO GAME. You‚Äôre a troll and it‚Äôs ugly. 
---
I bet you talk like this in real life too and that‚Äôs disgusting. Seek professional help immediately.. Talking all hard behind a screen, you ain‚Äôt shit for that.
---
Yeah good shout. I love the way death garden has character individual power. However one character in particular has become meta due to specific power and perks. I want to play the others but makes little to no sense to do this as the one character is much much better.
---
While I agree Prayer Beads is cancer, sincerely you can get fucked for telling anybody to kill themselves especially over a video game.  That crosses a major line and honestly just makes you look too pathetic for words.
---
&gt; And this is *very* boring for the killer
---
Boring **if** you don't know how to counter it or what you should do at them

Uninstall the game, it‚Äôs not good for your health.

Do what you want to do. I laugh when salty survivors message me

oof

I wonder why it's not showing DbD on the "coming soon" tab of the nintendo shop. There's games on there like shield and sword that aren't being released until November. I'm kinda hoping this isn't some foreshadowing that it's not gonna pan out and they pull the plug.

1 hook, 1 down, 5 gens still up? This match could be over.

God damn you guys with great ideas that will unfortunately never be added in

I love playing Freddy, to me he doesn‚Äôt need a buff but maybe in higher ranks he does.
---
Oh man, so many people, ay ay ay ay, so much salt, far worse than I could imagine! "Kill yourself", "Brain dead". Man oh man did you guys take every word I said literal without any consideration that I might not have been as serious as you thought I was. Am I considering that some people with actually mental issues might take this serious? Well yes, but actually no. "Hold up, this guy on the internet indirectly told me to go kill myself for that thing I used the other day, lemme just go commit suicide now".  
---
Come here, gimme mote downvotes now.
---
Depending on the killer, those perks are necessary to ever apply enough pressure. Killers like nurse and hag and spirit can get away with not running the classic BBQ/Ruin/Enduring/Spirit Fury because they have map pressence and counter loops with their power. They arent Wraith, they dont need Enduring Spirit Fury to do it for them.
---
Honestly we are pretty much at it more or less.  They could so a thing here or there for certain maps like Haddonfield but overall I think killers are in a very good spot.  The players who still feel powerless still at this point in the games balance simply haven't learned how to play optimally yet.
---
In this scenario, why do you even care? If the EGC was endinf you were going to be sacrificed anyway, and give BP to the killer.
---
But one thing is bothering me, if EGC was ending, how you got crows so fast. You sure you werent hinding for longer than what you told us?
---
BTW, out of spite...
---
This makes me wanna use it even more now. Just to piss you off
---
If she gets some more cosmetics that differentiate her, cause as of right now she's just a genderswapped Frank. Joey and Susie on the other hand have distinct looks
---
the hook animation glitch is only glitch I experienced that didn‚Äôt result in a WTF. 
---
But the exit gate glitch I saw was fucked up. a crawling survivor clearing containing a fire that draws you in like a mesmerized moth to a bug zapper. Flames won‚Äôt kill you but they will teleport you 4 meters away from the killer. Who‚Äôs just standing still chillin. After the 4-5 second ‚Äúuhh. D          Did I take acid &amp; forget?... reactions made by this particular killer (Pig) he slapped on a face raper trap but end game collapse ended it shortly after
---
Well other people are more competitive and do care about those things. There's no reason to feel bad about playing the game and trying to win. That's all the post is trying to say.
---
Got abit heated this one, Can't really blame my teammates. I went to heal the Meg in anticipation of helping out the other guy not realising that the nurse wasn't chasing her. Noed is to blame
---
I got those trophies using devour hope on hag actually. Although this was at lower ranks with pretty inexperienced survivors. I guess I got lucky with a good totem placement.
---
Best advice is to keep trying. You'll get it eventually. If not you can always get paired with a friendly swf group that you can just ask to please let you mori them all
---
Always.
---
Every killer has a hidden perk that allows them to carry it on their back
---
Jacket, shoes, pants, shirt color, hair color...
---
It should just be called martyrdom
---
Easy peasy kill me pleasey.
---
Looks pretty similar, actually
---
Why do you think barely anyone runs decisive anymore? It does the exact same thing it used to do, but they made it way more situational
---
The less use you get out of a perk the more situational and worse overall it is
---
But they can do something about unfun mechanics.
---
Lets be real, Survivors dont have much options either. They have the same amount as killers. Theres the two classic perks (BBQ/Ruin...Dead Hard or BL/Adrenaline) and then two flex spots depending on the killer you‚Äôre playing or the killer the survivor wants to counter. 
---
Most killers have to choose enduring spirit fury. There are some that dont need to run those perks because their power counters loops, so they can afford to run Monitor, Whispers, Nurses, MYC or Haunted grounds. And then survivors can pick two perks on what they want to counter. Spine Chill, Iron Will, Decisive, Borrowed or Unbreakable.
---
The Empress represents femininity, Motherhood, harmony and luxury, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs Laurie. That‚Äôs why I said Jane should be the Empress as her perks and look represent that.
---
You're right but there's currently too many original killers that aren't in the game for them to start making ones that are similar, in my opinion at least.
---
In my experience it's a terrible idea to run to your hex totem right when the game starts. There have been SO many games where I find a hex by watching where a killer with ruin goes first or comes from. Better to leave it to chance than to lead the survivors right to it. In your case, considering how you said you don't even get a chance to check the totem, it just sounds like bad luck.

Get more points based of off how much you have left to live ect, and it could be a boost for teammates or something Instead of a stun
---
Woah I thought it was really Meg in the thumbnail! Awesome!
---
Google.
---
This terrible meme has nothing to do with killers using overpowered add ons or a mori, so you bringing up insta heals makes no sense.
---
Urban Evasion is garbage and Balanced Landing is only toxic if they brought a Haddonfield offering solely to exploit balanced landing.
---
He didn't like tea so he took you to camp.
---
If survivors actually got enough bloodpoints and didnt have to dedicate a 4th perk slot to get stacks with no other benefit, killer queue times would be shorter.
---
RIP
---
nobody cares about your feelings on the internet, quit crying and man up scub
---
Sloppy butcher/nurses calling allows you to slow down the game and catch many survivors self caring in a corner

Meg:  ‚ÄúHoly shit, you‚Äôve got like, 10,000 pallets here!‚Äù
---
Pallet salesman:  ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôve got a lo-‚Äù
---
Meg:  ‚ÄúHow the hell am I supposed to defend myself with so few pallets?!  Are you trying to waste my time, sir?‚Äù
---
Pallet salesman:  ‚Äú...‚Äù
---
It honestly wouldnt change anything. Killers would just replace ruin with another meta perk since you gave them ruin for free.
---
I played him a lot pre rework, did really well with him. The rework didn't suit how I play so I dropped him
---
Lol what
---
I know they're trying to be nice but it always rubs me the wrong way when the killer is very obviously going easy on us or putting us back on our feet after a group slug. I just want to play the game to its natural conclusion. If we lose, we lose, and that's alright, and our feelings won't be hurt if you kill us all. That's your objective.
---
If he were to somehow lose the rights it might be fine though. 
---
That said short of him dying I doubt he‚Äôll lose the rights.
---
If not mistaken, the entity feeds on hope of a survivor. After they lose hope, they either just get discarted and disappear, or become killers with the entity influence over them.
---
I think there was a entry where benedict said he was starting to lose hope.
---
Oh thats very cool! any good page or link?
---
Removing tunneling isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfixing the game‚Äù tunneling is part of the game. I hate it, you hate it, but they can‚Äôt remove it, so we gotta rely on our team to safe in hook us. Otherwise da, is a great perk to wast time if the killer wants to tunnel.
---
Julie is so underrated, she deserves more love
---
Is Jason Not on Here?
---
what can they do to fix tunneling though?
---
Xenomorph would be fucking sick.
---
I really like your map change idea. I actually used to hate both swamp maps but after their changes I hate them a lot less, especially pale rose.
---
Changes that buff one side depends on how much it affects the other, like for example I mentioned tunneling because winning in high ranks against good survivors without at least a little bit of tunneling is almost impossible unless you're a God nurse. If they removed tunneling and kept generator times and maps untouched then a big problem would arise. However I agree that sometimes buffs to one side does not mean that the other also needs buffs (ebony mori changes and vacuum pallets are ones that come to mind)
---
I really wish that the devs find some way perfect fair way to completely kill camping and Tunneling, remove dumb tiles, make maps smaller and increase generator times. If they do that then we will enjoy the game a lot more and have much less to complain about.
---
also rip half life
---
Join r/PerksByDaylight, people post their custom perk icons, you can ask if they can send you downloads for them and look up a tutorial on hos to properly replace each perk
---
If you dont run Enduring+Spirit Fury, you will get steamrolled by survivors who dont cleanse and just run around extending loops even further with dead hard.
---
Identity V is getting a collab with Persona 5 and it's so exciting to see how the skins will look like, but this looks so awesome and wish dbd would do collabs as well
---
they clearly need a buff ASAP
---
+ i don't want to be that person, but you shouldn't post the artwork of an artist if you don't know who made the art tbh
---
That's how games with perks in it work. Some are better than others. I would happily run a full set of BP perks but BBQ is the best of them and I wouldn't really care if it never had the aura aspect. As most people will tell you, Ruin sucks ass to use but it's the best we have. Until they make something just as good and less of a make-or-break perk, then we gotta use it.
---
Thanks man! weird, it says the reddit doesnt exist
---
I'd cry
---
K-killers cant b-be toxic though! Y-you probably flashlight blinded him once and deserved it anyways!
---
Oh I don't think my having an issue with certain actions of certain immature people in this community is indicative of my emotional age lol
---
Perhaps I'm wrong but I don't believe killers who can't handle a premade group should even really play this game. Solely based on the fact that it is how a ton of people like to play this game: with friends. So anyone expecting to go into a match against 4 randoms at any given time and leaving a lobby when they get 4 people in the lobby at the same time makes them a weak minded pussy. If they can't handle that sort of thing, then they shouldn't be playing this game.
---
That's all I was trying to say. Sorry if you weren't able to gather that from what I said originally. My mistake.
---
New on comunity and too entertained looking through it to search for backstory, so can someone explain to me?
---
I have him mid tier and I will have a logical debate on this with anyone who disagrees.
---
That‚Äôs what I said
---
This is the true ‚Äú DS 2.0 ‚Äú
---
I still don't know wtf does noed even do
---
Because Killers overall have less chances for variety.  4 Survivors tend to run 4 perks mean to counter any meta playstyle, while Killers have to pick either the 4 best perks overall, or spend time mixing perks to see what works in 99% of the situations.
---
As long as BBQ gives double bp, it's gonna be used a ton. I'd love to use other 'detection' perks, but losing out on 20-30k bp every game stacks up really fast.
---
Julie outfit is basic, Susie ate her whole look up.
---
I cry :(
---
And Sloppy Butcher on the side
---
Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúlol what‚Äù you know that it‚Äôs shitty
---
Fuck noed dude this guy is literally playing the strongest killer in the game but still need a fucking crutch
---
I've revealed ghostface while running and looping
---
The person behind her.
---
Just looking...
---
Again, it's not about losing. I can have fun even in losses (even though everyone wants to win, of course).
---
This "play with the low tier to be skilled" mentality just doesn't make sense to me, maybe because I come from fighting games mentality; you're supposed to not just play to win but play at the most optimal way to do so lol.
---
I don't get the sarcasm? I mean, there are tons of games that I lose because I did bad plays or calls. I don't see how this is an issue seeing that winning or losing is not even in the conversation, really.
---
And you can believe me or not, but there are games with low tier killers that you just can't win (the win condition in this case being 3k, not pipping, which you can disagree).
---
I do play both sides, got to both in red ranks, so take that as you will.
---
As a killer, if any Dwight ever does something like that or is being playful, I can never kill him
---
Well, you can't do anything else lol
---
BBQ also encourages not camping, so I don't see why people hate it
---
I like his content, too. I find it hilarious when survivors do meme builds like him and laugh with me at the end of the round, but hate when people unironically do meme builds.
---
I honestly think hitboxes are shit on purpose to help killers
---
The joys of Rank reset
---
Just had a game with a French guy. Up against the nurse and all my "team-mates" DC'd the second they were hooked when we were 2 gens in. I got found so we farmed each other for points. He let me have 2 more gens, I let him blink into me, grab me, break gens, break a couple of pallets then he gave me the hatch (even though I offered him the hook so he didn't de-pip). Fair play to him!
---
It‚Äôs very common on PS4
---
Xenomorph would be so damn cool. I‚Äôll never hold my breath for that one but I think Pinhead is a real possibility.
---
Ahh okay. I did hear about that but wasn't sure what it was really about since I've only had the game for some months.
---
When my ban expires I'll try out killer and see if the error persists. I'll call up my ISP and see if there's any issues with packets or any of the like. If neither of those do anything to fix it then I'm probably just better off refunding the game because it's not fun going up against people who are way below your skill level and having the chance to get banned again.
---
He told me he is making it rn
---
In my experience it isn‚Äôt an anti tunnel perk, it‚Äôs an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm invincible against the killer for a minute‚Äù perk
---
You gotta make sure your character is facing him, not just the camera. I get plenty of long range detection on Ghostface unless he‚Äôs peeking because that‚Äôs the counter to being detected.
---
because it gets stale to play against the same perks (nearly) every match. IMO a lot of perks need to be rebalanced on both sides, to spice the meta up.
---
If you just stood there in front of him staring at him on the hook that's kind of an asshole move but that team really needed someone with borrowed time or DS or insta heal
---
At the end of the game tho theres not much you can do but at least try to search the surrounding area for survivors going for an unhook
---
Well lots of people complained about different objectives so that's most likely why we got the basicness of it .
---
How wide is the ‚Äúcharacter is facing him‚Äù aspect?
---
Not funny hopefully he reported you all
---
Swamp next to the fap shack. Yeah it is a weird one.
---
well it¬¥s possible that you were very toxic this whole game wich made the billy so mad that he taunts you. I mean survivors like to bm at every single pallet with fucking teabag shit so i understand when killers sometime wanna bm aswell. And this wasn¬¥t good gameplay at all it was very unexpected for the billy so i dont think that any of us would havew reacted properly in this situation. Just saying \^\_\^
---
Bruh this is too good I thought this was a render.
---
I had a streamer facecamp me because I flashlighted her at every pallet
---
I can't believe someone would actually facecamp while streaming, I wasn't surprised she had like no views
---
Don't use it then
---
For?
---
-"must not be named"
---
-immediately names him after
---
I dont know whats happening
---
The persons custom outfit is literally just a typical leather jacket white shirt pants combo . The person doesn't have the shaved head the logos on the shirt etc lol.
---
Oh golly not bbq. What will I dooo.
---
hatch time
---
Yeah I hate it when all of us survivor mains are branded as toxic because the toxic people 
---
If I AM toxic and I tag or whatever, I don't get mad if I'm camped or something. I was toxic, and I got what I asked for. That's that. GG. 
---
Tbagging and clicking is one thing, telling people they're trash is another. I've tried playing killer myself and all the toxicity I hear about (which I've only experienced like twice) makes me anxious every time I play (even when I farm)
---
Just had this scenario with someone on PC. Two of us left. 3 gens left and I found a red key in a box. SSYRAX hid in a locker for about 2:30 while a billy chased me around (I was already injured too). I eventually got hooked and didn‚Äôt struggle after I couldn‚Äôt jump off. This person then slammed lockers and TBagged at the killer when he grabbed my key and found the hatch. 
---
SSYRAX you suck
---
I was cloaked doing laps around the area surrounding his hook, looking for any trace of the other guy because he had disappeared into the frickin corn to heal.  i stood in front of him for maybe three seconds because i got a discord message notif, but other than that I was making sure to keep moving to check exits and whatnot.
---
Peter: God, do atheists go to hell?
---
God: No.
---
Peter: What about people who use their team as bait and leave them to die in DBD?
---
God: Straight to hell. To the bottom of hell. To the boiler room of hell. Sometimes I take em out, let em think everything's gonna be ok, then I put em right back in.
---
Peter: Good, that makes me happy.
---
Yeah I honestly think that while Decisive Strike's intention was good it's delivered really poorly. I rarely ever see DS used as intended ~~in large part because I don't tunnel~~ and most of the people who use it either run up to me and teabag me as soon as they're unhooked or loop me until their time reaches 45 seconds before standing perfectly still and letting me down them.
---
Rabbit-Clown looks like he would beat my ass.
---
This power would be better for pennywise
---
If it's part of the game why do Killers win without tunneling?
---
It's a problem that needs a solution.
---
Lol for what?
---
&gt;I have often suggested that Borrowed Time or Decisive Strike should be a baseline effect for a few seconds after a Survivor is unhooked, just to stop hard tunneling or ranged camping by Killers like Spirit / Nurse / Huntress / Hag. What pisses me off is that there are so many options that Behavior refuses to even *try.* Like we have a public test build: why the fuck can't shit get fucking publicly tested?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cd5ocl/dont_balance_the_game_just_make_perks_instead/ets4uek/
---
Just instaexit the game after if it bothers you enough to affect your enjoyment. I play killer 99% of the time and since I've gotten better and less likely to engage in what could even be misconstrued as camping/tunneling most people either dont say anything or are nice/just say gg. 
---
Some people are just dicks though. If someone says some dickhead shit I usually just say "lol gg" or "sorry you feel that way bud" and leave game before they can respond.
---
I have to add though, the thing that always makes it better is when the killer realises the shitty move your ‚Äúteammate‚Äù takes and leaves you alone to carry on chasing them. Like, thanks for the fair play pal. You can catch me when I deserve it.
---
Again with the goddamned leaks.
---
I was watching a stream once (the streamer was fucking around in a SWF) and the killer was facecamping. The killer was a streamer and he said he facecamps to be toxic. no idea how he had anyone in chat
---
pretty much
---
I went through a stint where I stuck insidious and noed on my Nurse and facecamped as much as possible. I think it was healthy for my enjoyment of the game honestly. I'd recommend it just so you can embrace their salt. It feels good to tell someone "you know what? I did camp you, and you died for it. I am allowed to do that, and you cannot stop me by screaming at me or posting on my steam profile."  
---
Sometimes it can be really cathartic to do stuff like that. Does it maybe hurt some peoples' enjoyment even if they weren't toxic pieces of shit, yeah. But you play how you want to play. Being "nice" doesn't stop those toxic players from saying horrible things to you, so why bother?  
---
There's a lot of people who say camping *because* of that toxicity only contributes to the problem, but I'm not advocating camping people and then telling them you're going to use their IP address to find them in real life and harass them. I'm not even advocating saying mean things back. There is no excuse for that behavior, and I think it's crazy that anyone thinks cyberbullying is okay if it's not someone playing how you like to play against
---
So you buy them just to have to say "oh look I have all of these survivors/killers"? Nahhh I want good perks lol
---
Other way. I'll have uhhhh, self-care, decisive, dead hard and uhhhhhhhhh mettle of man
---
Maybe a few seconds of increased speed after a stab would help, I find myself not having enough speed to catch up to a second target. It would be nice if the screen darkening for the frenzy cooldown was a little lessened too, it borders complete blindness on some maps.
---
I also think maybe allowing *1* miss during Frenzy would be fine, with this games buggy hitreg you just get screwed over sometimes
---
Your response was like you hit them with that DS.
---
Meta survivors would quickly arise due to the lack of balancing that the dead by daylight team would actually put into play. The development team is very small so it would take a while for improvements to come through quickly, leading to enraged killers and/or survivors
---
Dengue ran out of ammo in the plane
---
*I must go, my people need me.*
---
If we try that logic in another game it doesn't work. Watch. Say you're down 3-1 in a hockey game. 1.5 minutes left. NOED is the equivalent of getting an extra man on the ice without having to pull your goalie. The winning team has a much harder time compensating in the end game. And you got the extra man through no other reason than the winning team beating you throughout the rest of the game. I get it, we can just clear totems. The reality is that it's not always easy to find the dam thing, and you also run the risk of haunted grounds. There's conscious decisions made about not getting random totems sometimes.
---
Literally see him maybe 3 to 4 times a month.. hes not that great of a killer, most just camp for the memes...
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Yeah, I actually had two people hide from me on Lery's for nearly 30 minutes.
---
My matches are fine until I use a BP offering and actually equip tools or meds.  Then I'm instantly found, downed, and camped to death by the killer.
---
Survivor: *is toxic* Killer: *is toxic in return* Survivor:  : O
---
This post is not attacking you lol
---
A real "man" doesn't need insults to bring his points across. But hey - who am I to deny you your 5 Minutes of internet fame? Be a MAN, man!  :D
---
if it helps I‚Äôve been actually left to die on my first hook when I‚Äôm not being camped about 4 times today
---
He right tho
---
I love the fact that I get this.
---
It's not you having an issue that makes you come across that way. It's your choice of words. :-)  
---
No harm done though!
---
I‚Äôd fucking love a Xenomorph killer
---
You are not allowed to win, it's written right here in the survivor rulebook. See, killer cannot win
---
Best I've had was against an almost definite SWF team. They opened gates, I'm getting shit on all game and hook one of their friends. Every one of the remaining three try to unhook the guys and bodyblock me from hitting him... as Leatherface. I chainsawed and sacrificed three, but the fourth had unbreakable, bailed on his closely hooked friends and escaped. I was so pleased after they bullied me all game.
---
Shrine takes way to long... look how often bbq comes out ? Once a year... I just buy killers when they have their 50% off sale..   I legit bought ash for MoM and I loved using that perk. But now that they nerfed it, its upsetting and I use not one of his perks anymore a complete waste of money.
---
If you don't appreciate people being called pussies that's on you tbh. Doesn't mean it isn't true.
---
It‚Äôs usually billy and leather face. Both with insidious builds.
---
I use to strictly run meta perks but after watching Monto a bit I've decided to try fun builds to see what happens and how I fare. Made the game 10x more fun, I don't escape as often but I Pip significantly more often and have much more fun
---
probably
---
Wraith doesn't have a choice really, its needed
---
I've had that happen too. Both are annoying. When I solo if someone is almost at second stage I immediately go to get them because I have no idea if they're being camped or if someone is going to get them.
---
Im rank 10 and I do fine with him
---
I think people are forgetting this. Sure you may not always win the Chase after using ds but you can potentially by a lot of time for your team to do gens and if everyone has ds it can easily win the game for survivors
---
Put pennywise higher up
---
Not entirely true, if EAC detects it they will ban you, although it is a very small chance.
---
When you think it can‚Äôt get worse but he starts typing n i...
---
I mean what else am I supposed to run? Fuckin Lightborn, Franklins, Unnerving, and Overcharge?!? Don‚Äôt blame the players, blame the dipshit devs for not shaking the meta ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Lol like why even comment? You just sound like a prick man
---
Preeteens that did in fact have the shining
---
I'll take a large BBQ, a serving of Ruin, Nurse's to drink, and a side of Tinkerer on a Billy platter, thanks!
---
People can also win in fighting games without using special moves or specific frame lock combos some people hate. Doesn't make it a problem. You just sound salty as fuck.
---
Because IT'S strength and weakness was belief. Where the entity gets its power from hope.
---
Oh they both typed it multiple times I just screenshotted a small amount
---
Well I mean, it's a perk that has a mechanic that's just being properly used by players, it's not the player's fault for using the perk mechanic casually, you can go to the devs for that.
---
lol looking at you bringing in logic.
---
We are not talking about another game though, are we?
---
Grow up. The internet is full of this stuff. If you can't handle that, you shouldn't be on it. Also they'd probably get upset if you called them a she and it was a he, so quite frankly "it" is more gender neutral.
---
That's a lot of assuming there man. Just saying :)
---
True but I don't think the idea that it won't get balanced quickly enough should be a catalyst in there never being any change. Cos then you've got yourself a doomed game in the long run. Also there's plenty of meta's now, I don't think the status quo would really change in that regard.
---
Wait who is Pennywise similar to?
---
We don't have a shapeshifter yet.
---
How this repost has so many likes? This meme is atleast 1 year old
---
For tracking wins could be something like identity v 5v5 mode
---
A team of 4 survivors and a killer agains another.
---
The team with the most escapes win.
---
I would remove only offerings and let addons on the play, since they change your playstyle. You can say tombstone myers would be OP, but i saw a lot of SWF winning against this, so imagine in a competitive af scenario.
---
BTW Survivors must be in a group for this to work (just like in idv's 5v5 mode)
---
Put a ban phase were a killer ban perks, i think maybe 2 is good enough, and survivors can each ban a killer or a perk.
---
But most important of all, we would need NO BUGS or exploits
---
Probably a lot can be upgraded on what i said, so feel free to say whatever you want, any ideas are welcome
---
Stop trying to justify toxic behaviour from killers I see that all the time on this subreddit, theres so many times were killers are assholes for no reason at all.
---
Being grossly overweight =/= thicc
---
Last breath, of flesh and mud, spark of madness, and a lullaby for the dark are all free on console so yes
---
I'd love if they would just Double the BP for everyone by default and make WGLF do something else, and even without the double BP, BBQ is still a good perk, but it wouldn't be on EVERY SINGLE KILLER.
---
maybe, I guess I‚Äôll see in a few days 
---
until then I‚Äôm mostly playing Billy and thinking of trying Spirit soon
---
The devs said quite a while ago that they were going to fix this very issue when they buffed Freddy, but it's here and they've done nothing about it. Hello?? Devs???
---
I have been wanting a Pinhead killer for about a year now, So let's hope one day

SSYRAX:  Why do i hear Mortal Kombat movie theme music
---
&gt;This is a problem when you need a 4-1 ratio on survivors to killers.
---
Not really. The killer is supposed to be strong, but alone. The survivors are meant to be weak, but gain their strength through numbers. That's what an asymmetrical horror game means in this context.
---
People don‚Äôt know what tunneling means anymore
---
Well, still a repost without crediting the original creator
---
Devs are poopoo in their brain, not the player's fault, again.
---
Insta heals have given killers PTSD when it comes to med kits though..
---
"I think we did a pretty good job so far"
---
Yeah it goes both ways and toxicity just breeds more toxic behaviors.
---
I just got it today. Been trying since I got the game and only need him and nurse lol. I feel your pain he's so useless when you're trying to get points a certain way. I got it with the purple 2 extra traps and the dying state upon freeing add-ons. And it was on lerys. He sucks cause I got hag and Freddy with a DC but get a 4k with trapper and still only get ruthless.
---
I love seeing douchebags get dealt with like this. Killers complain about tbagging but do stuff like that ugh. #justice
---
Not bad. I could see a zombie as the killer, which could infect survivors in some way.
---
The sad part is a bought ash 2days before the nerf. I didn't even use MoM once
---
They‚Äôre too busy ‚Äútrying civilization‚Äù ya know? Stop giving them such a hard time xD

Cod Tac

His old power literally hurt him. And it had almost no purpose. He was always an M1 killer.
---
He was not fun to play as or to play against.
---
i was literally defending the killer because everyone here was making fun of him so it doensn¬¥t make sense what you say. Dont get pissed but any post on the internet. I was calmly reminding that you should always look at both sides, either survivor and killer thats it. I didn¬¥t justify anythinig. This is unfortunately the most toxic game besided LoL that i know and you can see that behaviour in reddit aswell wich is very sad. I want that both the killer and the survivior should start respecting themselves and stop with that BM from both sides. I got bullied by killers a lot of times and the same goes for when i play killer that survivors always go to safe pallets, dance around them and teabagging when ever they have time for it. Unfortunately i think people will never behave and always be assholes ingame...

They did say something about it in one of the streams, and some of the newly leaked cosmetics look like they are summer skins, so I think so, probably in August or something

Am I the only one who wants a lovecraftian chapter? Gimme a shivering mound with tentacles and a thousand thousand eyes

Or in this case, miss the hit

Speed limiter killers don't bother me though. If you're challenging yourself by playing with a handicap, then good for you. I will still play to win because that's what makes it a fun challenge. I played speed limiter no M1 Bubba and had a blast, survivors played normally and didn't go easy on me. Had fun, there were no bad manners.
---
I don't believe any of the proposed changes would really detract from this though - and the end goal is decreasing queue times not making it so the survivors can beat up the killer like Friday 13th heh
---
Hannibal Lector would be the shit. We already know what his mori would be.

I love this racoon

Didn't see the rest of your comment btw. 
---
Addressing that last part:
---
If you *know* with certainty that you *will* have an swf group 9 times out of 10 and that's just the way the game is, then you should just stop playing the game rather than dodging. Swf is a thing for a reason. If anything, maybe perk balance needs to be addressed and seen as the main issue rather than the fact that someone might enjoy playing this game with their friends. Which first of all, I would argue that playing with your friends cooperatively is a rewarding experience that most people actively seek out in their video games (see any multiplayer game ever). 
---
The issue is, swf should not give a noticable advantage through the perk choices available to them. I think it's pretty clear that adrenaline is a pretty big issue. Along with things like BBQ and ruin, it takes the keys away from someone who should be in the driver's seat in a given situation. Those types of perks just really force the opposing party to change the entire way they approach the game which I just don't believe is healthy for the game. But yeah the mere ability to play with friends certainly should not be seen as an issue in any game. This game especially.
---
wait is this real? i haven't played DBD in awhile
---
wheres your penis
---
seems normal to me.
---
You ever hear of two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right?
---
Against a half decent team, when the exit gates are powered the game is over. This is fair because the killer couldn‚Äôt properly apply enough pressure or defend gens properly.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between an endgame build and just NOED. An endgame build cripples your early game power in favor of endgame power which is balanced. NOED single-handedly can shift the balance of endgame by itself. That‚Äôs not balanced.

I doubt it, they probably haven't even finalised the winner yet.
---
Besides, she's likely coming with Jeff's skin
---
I agree with a semi organized team it is difficult to play sometimes impossible well coordinated teams.
---
Not true, let all your teammates die and get hatch
---
&gt;no pre game chat
---
Impossible, that‚Äôs like the origin of 30% of the memes posted here. It‚Äôs the lifeblood of this community.
---
I can almost always get at least 3 tokens when I use DH on the pig.  Since she has a power that slows the game down it helps. I ussually run DH, I.A.E., BBQ, Pgtw or nurses
---
As I've said, to each their own.
---
Trash Panda loves you 2
---
Now do the fucking GEN
---
If I die, but provided a good service or sacrificial run to my team/had a good chase, yeah.
---
Hex: Ruin is a shit perk imo because its so luck based with totem spawns and you‚Äôll rely on it too much
---
*i mean i guess its kinda powerful but i wouldnt use it unless you‚Äôre using a perk build that needs as much time as possible even if it means relying on luck, like tombstone fragrant tuft of hair myers*
---
I was referencing the guy who would go and shit talk through messaging outside the game, not OP
---
Wait for rank reset to get back to normal, also idk if it‚Äôs just PS4, but killers can find survived very easily atm as they can see survivors through generator and object auras, so early game someone‚Äôs guaranteed to be found. This isn‚Äôt intentional though and is just a bug.
---
I don't care for the Area 51 meme but this is genuinely great.
---
I think this skin at least inspired the idea of this skin.  i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the overall winner, but the inspiration for another skin.
---
Fucking beautiful.
---
Oh I get it... ^Truck
---
I just realised how strong would be Legion if he could down injured people with Feral Frenzy, his power would finally be more than a "first hit".
---
Yeah. Real sorry bout that, forgot there were two kinds of blindness. Since I recall it correctly now I can say you‚Äôre right, it is a good trade off, again sorry for that. I tend to forget stuff that some people name the same thing sometimes, ya get what I mean? Anyway here‚Äôs an upvote for your trouble.
---
100% of players complaining about the nerf don't play high rank killer.
---
Like the dumb dumb above that just said "oh dur hur I just hit them again!"
---
Like yeah dude, i'm glad you're okay with your rank 15 survivors.
---
It's a really stupid fucking comment to be fair
---
What do prayer beads do anyway?
---
Ok you do what you wanna do
---
Me: "ok, rank reset, so I'll 2 hook everyone and let them scape."
---
Also me: "YOU JUST FARMED THAT BABY DWEET? GUESS YOU 4 WILL DIE"
---
What rank are you?
---
You say that but the amount of times a survivor reveals me when I‚Äôm looking at them, but I get no stalk off. because they have a millimeter of extra view, so when they hide behind a wall they‚Äôre character can apparently reveal me, but I can‚Äôt stalk them when I‚Äôm in the same position.
---
Getting downvoted by survivor mains while posting on reddit. Name a more iconic duo.
---
It was mostly shit but "top 10 mysterious gasses that will make you say" was hilarious.
---
Actually, it would. Survivors are meant to be just skins. Nothing more, nothing less. The passive idea would go against that entirely. People want to play a build they like on a survivor that they like the look of. They wouldn't be able to do that anymore with the passive idea. 
---
&gt;I find this argument flawed however, because it just doesn‚Äôt feel as good for your gameplay to be so strongly dictated entirely by another party.
---
Again, the killer is meant to be the power role. Not the survivors. The killer should (at least to a certain extent) dictate how the match goes.
---
&gt;Number one, you‚Äôd actually get to queue and play (lol).
---
And this is a benefit, how? Queues should be fixed on their own, not given a band-aid because of survivor passives now being a thing. This sounds more beneficial to survivors than killers. 
---
On top of all that, this doesn't fit the 80's slasher movie theme the devs are going for. The survivors are meant to be powerless humans trying to cope and survive against a murderous, supernatural monster who wants nothing more than to kill them.
---
Just because one person was acting like a dick doesn't mean you should too
---
I see him way more often than that.
---
I also play him in my regular rotation.
---
Doubt it would matter when there is tons of hooks within spitting distance of each other anyway.
---
Rank 5 killer and Rank 7 survivor
---
It is a good rebuttal you dumb fucking whorebag. He's 100% right.
---
Praise the Lord ü§£ü§£ how long do you think it will take

Freddy‚Äôs a pedo too ya know

Increases action speed by 5% for a duration of 60 seconds after a safe hook rescue or protective hit
---
Freddy killed kids not touched them
---
You make no sound while phase walking... that is my favorite thing to do as spirit because it‚Äôs so funny to see people instantly get jump scared lmao

Wait don't you have to blur names? I posted post game chat earlier and got flamed for not doing it :'c

Worse killer....is probably wraith now.
